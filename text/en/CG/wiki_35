<text>Windows NT 3.1 is the first major release of the Windows NT operating system developed by Microsoft, released on July 27, 1993. It marked the company&#x27;s entry into the corporate computing environment, designed to support large networks and to be portable, compiled for Intel x86, DEC Alpha and MIPS based workstations and servers. It was Microsoft&#x27;s first 32-bit operating system, providing advantages over the constrictive 16-bit architecture of previous versions of Windows that relied on DOS, but retaining a desktop environment familiar to Windows 3.1 users.

Windows NT began as a rewrite of the OS/2 operating system, which Microsoft had co-developed with IBM but failed to gain much traction against Unix, with vendor Sun Microsystems dominating the market for powerful desktop workstations. For several reasons, including the market success of Windows 3.0 in 1990, Microsoft decided to advance Windows rather than OS/2 and relinquished their OS/2 development responsibilities. By extending the Windows brand and beginning NT at version 3.1, like Windows 3.1 which had established brand recognition and market share, Microsoft implied that consumers should expect a familiar user experience. The name &quot;Windows NT&quot; (&quot;New Technology&quot;) advertised that this was a re-engineered version of Windows.

First publicly demonstrated at Comdex 1991, NT 3.1 was released in 1993 in two editions: Workstation and Advanced Server. When Windows NT premiered, their sales were limited by high system requirements, and a general lack of 32-bit applications to take advantage of the OS&#x27;s data processing capabilities. It sold about 300,000 copies before it was succeeded by Windows NT 3.5 in 1994. On December 31, 2000, Microsoft declared Windows NT 3.1 obsolete and stopped providing support and updates for the system.

Windows NT 3.1 was the first version of Windows to use 32-bit flat virtual memory addressing on 32-bit processors. Its companion product, Windows 3.1, used segmented addressing and switches from 16-bit to 32-bit addressing in pages.

== Development history ==
The origins of Windows NT date back to 1988, where Microsoft had a major foothold on the personal computer market due to the use of its MS-DOS as the operating system of IBM PC compatibles. Nathan Myhrvold, who had joined Microsoft after its acquisition of Dynamical Systems Research, identified two major threats to Microsoft&#x27;s monopoly—RISC architectures, which proved to be more powerful than the equivalent Intel processors that MS-DOS ran on, and Unix, a family of cross-platform multitasking operating systems with support for multiprocessing and networking. While the widespread use of Unix was hindered by the need to adapt programs for each individual variant, Bill Gates believed that the combination of a Unix-like operating system with RISC processors could be a market threat, prompting the need for Microsoft to develop a &quot;Unix killer&quot; that could run on multiple architectures. Myhrvold wanted to develop a new system that would run on RISC workstations and Intel chips and multiprocessing computers. Gates had also hired Dave Cutler from Digital Equipment Corporation to assist in developing the new operating system; Cutler left DEC after the cancellation of the PRISM architecture and its MICA operating system, and agreed to join Microsoft on the condition that he be able to bring a number of staff members from his team at DEC with him. Cutler arrived at Microsoft in October 1988, and began working on the development of the operating system in November.

The operating system was first developed as a revised version of OS/2, an operating system Microsoft had jointly developed with IBM. While OS/2 was originally intended to succeed MS-DOS, it had yet to be commercially successful. The OS was to be designed so it could be ported to different processor platforms, and support multiprocessor systems, which few operating systems did at that time. To target the enterprise market, the OS was also to support networking, the POSIX standard, and a security platform compliant with the &quot;Orange Book&quot; standards; which would require the OS to be a multi-user system with a permission framework and the ability to audit security-related events.

Both Microsoft and IBM wanted to market an operating system that appealed to corporate &quot;enterprise software&quot; customers. That meant greater security, reliability, processing power, and computer networking features. However, since Microsoft also wanted to capture market share from Unix on other computing platforms, they needed a system design that was more portable than that of OS/2.

To this end, Microsoft began by developing and testing their new operating system for a non-x86 processor: an emulated version of the Intel i860. Alluding to the chip&#x27;s codename, &quot;N10&quot;, Microsoft codenamed their operating system NT OS/2. DEC preemptively sued Microsoft, alleging that they stole code from MICA for use in the new operating system. In an out-of-court settlement, Microsoft agreed to make NT OS/2 compatible with DEC&#x27;s Alpha processor.

The development team originally estimated that development would be complete within 18 months. By April 1989, the NT OS/2 kernel could run inside the i860 emulator. However, the development team later determined that the i860 was unsuitable for the project. By December they had begun porting NT OS/2 to the MIPS R3000 processor instead, and completed the task in three months. Senior Microsoft executive Paul Maritz was targeting a release date in 1992, but the development schedule was uncertain. The company was eager to silence naysayers who speculated that NT wouldn&#x27;t be on the market until 1994, and had planned to present the new OS at COMDEX in 1990.

=== As Windows NT ===
In May 1990, Microsoft released Windows 3.0, a new version of its MS-DOS-based Windows desktop environment. Windows 3.0 sold well, and the resulting shift in Microsoft&#x27;s marketing strategy eroded their partnership with IBM—who wanted Microsoft to concentrate solely on developing OS/2 as its primary platform as opposed to building their future business around Windows. Users and developers were unsure of whether to adopt Windows or OS/2 due to these uncertainties (a situation magnified by the fact that the operating systems were incompatible with each other at the API level), while Microsoft&#x27;s resources were also being drained by the simultaneous development of multiple operating systems. In August 1990, as a response to the popularity of Windows 3.0, the NT OS/2 team decided to re-work the operating system to use an extended 32-bit port of the Windows API known as Win32. Win32 maintained the familiar structure of the 16-bit APIs used by Windows, which would allow developers to easily adapt their software for the new platform while maintaining a level of compatibility with existing software for Windows. With the shift to a Windows-like architecture, the operating system&#x27;s shell was also changed from OS/2&#x27;s Presentation Manager to Windows&#x27; Program Manager.

Due to these changes, NT was not presented at COMDEX 1990 as was originally planned. Neither the general public nor IBM knew about the transformation of NT OS/2 into &quot;Windows NT&quot; at the time. Although the companies did agree to a revised partnership where IBM and Microsoft would alternate developing major versions of OS/2 instead of collaborating on each version, IBM eventually learned of Microsoft&#x27;s Windows NT plans in January 1991, and immediately ended the OS/2 partnership. IBM would solely develop OS/2 2.0 (as was planned under the amended version) and all future versions, without any further involvement from Microsoft.

In October 1991, Windows NT received its first public demonstration at COMDEX. In an effort to ensure software taking advantage of Windows NT was available upon its release (scheduled for late-1992), Microsoft also distributed a 32-bit software development kit to selected developers in attendance. The demonstration was positively received; PC Magazine called Windows NT &quot;the modern reinvention of the operating system&quot;, but at the same time claimed that it was unlikely that the promised backward compatibility would be kept for the final release. In March 1992, Microsoft also released Win32s, which would allow Windows 3.1 to have partial compatibility with Windows NT programs for the purposes of developing software optimized for the platform.

At Microsoft&#x27;s Win32 Professional Developers Conference in June 1992, Windows NT was demonstrated running on x86 and MIPS processors, while a beta version of Windows NT and an updated development kit were also made available. Concurrently, Microsoft announced a new version of its SQL Server product for Windows NT; Unix vendors feared that the software could be a killer app that would affect the market share of Unix systems. Concerns were also raised over NT&#x27;s memory usage; while most computers of the era shipped with 4 megabytes of RAM, 16 MB was recommended for NTs. Due to the high cost of RAM at the time, critics thought that its high system requirements could affect the sales and adoption of Windows NT. Steps were taken to reduce its memory usage through methods such as paging.

Microsoft began releasing public beta builds of NT in October 1992, and a month later at COMDEX, a presentation focusing on third-party software for Windows NT was held. The final pre-release version of NT was released in March 1993, alongside the unveiling of the server version, &quot;LAN Manager for Windows NT&quot;. Although its stability and performance had improved, there were still fears that the OS could be released in an unfinished state or delayed further into 1993.

By extending the Windows brand and beginning NT at version 3.1, like Windows 3.1 which had established brand recognition and market share, Microsoft implied that consumers should expect a familiar user experience yet re-engineered.

=== Release ===
Windows NT 3.1 and Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server (so numbered to associate them with Windows 3.1) were released on July 26, 1993. At first, only the x86 and MIPS versions shipped; the DEC Alpha version followed in September. Microsoft sold the workstation version for , and the server version for . Ostensibly, the server price was meant to be a promotional discount offered only during the first six months of sale, but they never raised the retail price to the listed one—. 250 programmers wrote 5.6 million lines of code; the development cost . In the last year of development, the team fixed more than 30,000 bugs.

During the product&#x27;s lifecycle, Microsoft published three service packs: Service Pack 1 was released on October 8, 1993; Service Pack 2 followed on January 24, 1994; and Service Pack 3&#x27;s release date was October 29, 1994. The service packs were distributed on CD-ROM and floppy disk, and also through bulletin board systems, CompuServe, and the Internet. Microsoft terminated support for the operating system on December 31, 2000. Support for Windows NT 3.1 RTM (without a service pack) ended on January 8, 1994. Service Pack 1 support ended on April 24, 1994, and finally, Service Pack 2 support ended on January 29, 1995, only 1 year after general availability.

Windows NT 3.1 was localized into various languages. Besides English, it was available in Dutch, French, German, Japanese, Spanish and Swedish. The version for workstations, but not Windows NT 3.1 Server, was additionally available in Danish, Finnish, Italian, Norwegian and Portuguese.

== Operating system goals ==
Cutler set three main goals for Windows NT. The first goal was portability: in contrast to previous operating systems, which were strongly tied to one architecture, Windows NT should be able to operate on multiple architectures. To meet this goal, most of the operating systems, including the operating system core, had to be written in the C programming language. During the planning phase it was clear that this would cause Windows NT to have higher memory consumption than all previous operating systems. Besides the graphics system and parts of the networking system, which were written in C++, only parts of the operating systems which required direct hardware access and performance critical functions were written in assembly language. These parts were isolated so that they could easily be rewritten when porting the operating system to a new architecture.

The second goal was reliability: The system should no longer crash due to a faulty application or faulty hardware. This way, the operating system should be made attractive for critical applications. To meet this goal, the architecture of Windows NT was designed so that the operating system core was isolated and applications could not access it directly. The kernel was designed as a microkernel and components of the core were to run atop the kernel in a modular fashion; Cutler knew this principle from his work at Digital. Reliability also includes security, and the operating system should be able to resist external attacks. Mainframes already had a system where every user had their own account which was assigned specific rights by the administrator, this way, users could be prevented access to confidential documents. A virtual memory management was designed to thwart attacks by malware and prevent users from accessing foreign areas of memory.

The third goal was called &quot;personality&quot;: The operating system should be able to run applications designed for various operating systems, such as Windows, MS-DOS and OS/2 applications. The Mach kernel followed a similar concept by moving the APIs to components which operated in user mode as applications, these could be changed and new ones could be added. This principle was applied to Windows NT.

Despite all these goals, the performance of the operating system was optimized where possible, by adapting critical sections of the code to fast execution speed. To improve networking performance, large parts of the networking system were moved to the operating system core.

Windows NT was designed as a networking operating system. In this branch, Novell had a lead with its product &quot;NetWare&quot;, mostly because of a lack of competition, and Microsoft failed to develop a product which could challenge NetWare&#x27;s lead. Cutler hoped to gain additional customers with a reliable networking operating system. Bill Gates already dominated the market of desktop operating systems with MS-DOS and Windows and hoped to do the same in the networking market with Windows NT. He especially hoped to find a market in the emerging number of servers, while at the same time he did not expect a success in the desktop market until 1995.

Therefore, Windows NT was positioned as a high-end operating system in an interview with the product manager David Thacher. It was not designed to replace Windows 3.1 completely, but it should rather supplement Microsoft&#x27;s product palette with an operating system for critical applications. The expectations were 10% to 20% among all Windows sales and a market share of 10% in the high end market, which amounted to one million copies.

== Features ==
=== Architecture ===
While Windows NT 3.1 uses the same graphical user interface as Windows 3.1, it was developed anew. The operating system is not DOS-based, but an independent 32-bit operating system; many concepts were taken from Cutler&#x27;s previous operating system, VMS. The architecture of Windows NT takes some ideas of the client–server model, like the modular structure and the communication between the modules. System resources like memory, files or devices are viewed as objects by the operating system, which are all accessed in the same way through handles and which can in this way be secured against unauthorized access.

The operating system was designed for multiprocessor systems; it supports preemptive multitasking and can make use of threads to run multiple processes in parallel. Using symmetric multiprocessing, the processing usage is evenly distributed among all available processors. The inter-process communication in Windows NT 3.1 is designed around networks; two newly introduced functions, Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and Network DDE, an extension of Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), facilitate the access and data exchange between processes running on different computers inside a network.

The operating system is designed to combine certain elements of a monolithic kernel and a microkernel; nowadays this is most often referred to as a hybrid kernel. The hardware abstraction layer represents the lowermost layer and isolates the operating system from the underlying hardware to make it easy to port the operating system to other platforms. The kernel running atop only has very basic functions like interrupt management and processor synchronization. All other functions of the operating system core are handled by modules which operate independently from one another and can be swapped without affecting the rest of the operating system.

Positioned above the operating system core are the subsystems. There are two types of subsystems: one are the &quot;integral subsystems&quot;, which perform important operating system functions. One such subsystem is the security subsystem, which handles the logon process and monitors the security of the system. The other type of subsystem is the &quot;environment subsystem&quot;, which exposes the operating system functions to applications via application programming interfaces. The base subsystem is the 32-bit subsystem which runs 32-bit applications written for Windows NT. Windows NT applications can only run on one platform, and must be recompiled for every platform. The 32-bit subsystem also contains all output functions, including the Graphics Device Interface (GDI), so all other subsystems have to call the 32-bit subsystem to be able to output text or graphics. Other subsystems contained in Windows NT 3.1 are the POSIX subsystem, which supports POSIX-compatible applications built for Windows NT, and, in the x86 version only, the OS/2 subsystem, which allows command-line based OS/2 1.x applications to run.

The Virtual DOS Machine (VDM) is sometimes also viewed as a subsystem, but is, strictly speaking, a normal 32-bit Windows application. It manages applications originally built for DOS. Built on top is Windows on Windows (WoW), which allows applications built for 16-bit Windows operating systems like Windows 3.1 to run. On x86 computers, the virtual DOS machine uses the virtual 8086 mode to run DOS applications directly, on RISC computers, an emulator licensed from &quot;Insignia Solutions&quot; is used which emulates a 80286 processor. However, not all DOS and 16-bit Windows applications can be run on Windows NT 3.1 due to various limitations, one of them being the inability of applications to directly access the hardware. As well, VxD files sometimes needed by applications cannot be used with Windows NT 3.1. While pure DOS applications are run in separate memory spaces, 16-bit Windows applications have to share one memory space. While this is done due to compatibility reasons with applications which depend on this ability, like Schedule+ and Microsoft Mail, it also means that 16-bit Windows applications only run in cooperative multitasking. A faulty 16-bit Windows application is in this way able to cause all other 16-bit Windows applications (but not Windows NT itself) to crash.

=== System ===
Windows NT 3.1 provides a boot manager called NTLDR which is loaded during the startup process of the operating system on x86-based computers. It allows a multiboot setup of multiple instances of Windows NT 3.1, as well as MS-DOS and OS/2 1.x. NTLDR is not used for the RISC versions because the RISC computers&#x27; firmware provides their own boot manager.

Every user has to log on to the computer after Windows NT 3.1 is booted up by pressing the key combination Ctrl+Alt+Del and entering the user name and password. All users have their own user account, and user-specific settings like the Program Manager groups are stored separately for every user. Users can be assigned specific rights, like the right to change the system time or the right to shut down the computer. To facilitate management of user accounts, it is also possible to group multiple user accounts and assign rights to groups of users.

Windows NT 3.1 introduced the new NTFS file system. This new file system is more robust against hardware failures and allows assignment of read and write rights to users or groups on the file system level. NTFS supports long file names and has features to accommodate POSIX applications like hard links. For compatibility reasons, Windows NT 3.1 also supports FAT16 as well as OS/2&#x27;s file system HPFS, but does not support long file names on FAT file system (VFAT). This was added in Windows NT 3.5.

Designed as a networking operating system, Windows NT 3.1 supports multiple network protocols. Besides IPX/SPX and NetBEUI, the TCP/IP protocol is supported allowing access to the Internet. Similar to &quot;Windows for Workgroups&quot;, files and printers can be shared and the access rights and configuration of these resources can be edited over the network. When a network printer is installed, the required drivers are automatically transferred over the network, removing the need to manually install the drivers for every computer. The Remote Access Service (RAS) allows a client from outside the network to connect to the network using a modem, ISDN or X.25 and access its resources. While the workstation allows one RAS connection at a time, the server supports 64.

Windows NT 3.1 supports the then-new Unicode standard, a character set which allows multiple languages to be displayed. This facilitates localization of the operating system. All strings, as well as file and folder names, are internally processed in Unicode, but the included programs, like the File Manager, are not Unicode aware, so folders containing Unicode characters cannot be accessed. For demonstration purposes, a Unicode typeface called &quot;Lucida Sans Unicode&quot; is shipped with Windows NT 3.1 even though it is not installed by default. The previous code pages are still supported for compatibility purposes.

The Windows registry, introduced with Windows 3.1, is a central, hierarchical configuration database designed to allow configuration of computers over the network and to replace the commonly-used text-based configuration files, like INI files, AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS. Using the undocumented registry editor, the Windows registry can be viewed and edited by the user.

The &quot;Advanced Server&quot; is designed to manage the workstation computers. It can function as a Domain controller, where all users and groups as well as their rights are stored. This way, a user can log on from any computer in the network, and users can be managed centrally on the server. Trust relationships can be built to other domains to be able to exchange data cross-domain. Using the replication service, files like logon scripts can be synchronized across all computers on the network. The Advanced Server supports the AppleTalk protocol to allow connections to Macintosh computers. Hard drives can be combined to RAIDs in Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server, the supported configurations are RAID 0, RAID 1 and RAID 5.

=== Included programs ===
Windows NT 3.1, for the most part, comes with 32-bit versions of the components featured in Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups. However, it also included applications specifically aimed at the needs of Windows NT, like the User Manager, the Performance Monitor, the Disk Administrator, the Event Viewer and the &quot;Backup&quot; application. The &quot;Advanced Server&quot; contained further, server-specific administration tools. Because Windows NT 3.1 is not DOS-based, a new 32-bit command-line processor, called CMD.EXE was included which was compatible with MS-DOS 5.0. For compatibility reasons, Windows NT 3.1 shipped with a few 16-bit applications, like Microsoft Write or EDLIN.

Windows NT 3.1, being an all-new operating system for which no previous drivers could be used, includes a wealth of drivers for various common components and peripherals. This includes common SCSI devices like hard drives, CD-ROM drives, tape drives and image scanners, as well as ISA devices like graphics cards, sound cards and network cards. The PCI bus, however, is expressly not supported. Windows NT 3.1 supports an uninterruptible power supply.

Windows NT 3.1 could be installed either by using the CD-ROM and a provided boot disk, or by utilizing a set of twenty-two 3.5&quot; floppies (twenty-three floppies for &quot;Advanced Server&quot;). Windows NT 3.1 could also be installed over the network. A coupon was included that made it possible to order a set of twenty-seven 5.25&quot; floppies (or twenty-eight floppies for &quot;Advanced Server&quot;). Compared to the floppies, the CD-ROM contained additional drivers and applications.

== System requirements ==
Windows NT 3.1 supports multiple platforms: Aside from the x86 architecture, it runs on computers with DEC Alpha or MIPS (R4000 and R4400) processors.

Minimum system requirements on x86 systems include a 25 MHz 80386 processor, at least 12 megabytes of memory, 75 megabytes of hard drive space, and a VGA graphics card. RISC systems require 16 megabytes of memory, 92 megabytes of hard drive space, and a CD-ROM drive. The &quot;Advanced Server&quot; edition requires an 80386 processor with 16 megabytes of memory and 90 megabytes of hard drive space. On RISC systems, 110 megabytes of hard drive space is needed.

Windows NT 3.1 supports dual processor systems, while the &quot;Advanced Server&quot; edition supports up to four processors. Due to an error in the processor detection routine, Windows NT 3.1 cannot be installed on Pentium II or newer processors. Microsoft never fixed the problem, but unofficial patches are available.

== Reception ==
Windows NT 3.1 sold about 300,000 copies in its first year. The hardware requirements were deemed to be very high at that time; the recommended system requirements of a 486 processor with 16 megabytes of memory were well above the average computer&#x27;s configuration, and the operating system turned out to be too slow to use. 32-bit applications which could have used the capabilities of Windows NT 3.1 were scarce, so users had to resort to the old 16-bit applications; however, these ran slower than on Windows 3.1. Estimates in November 1993 counted only 150 Windows NT applications. Common types of software, like office suites, were not available for Windows NT 3.1. During the development of the operating system, the API calls were changed so 32-bit applications built on the 1992 pre-release version of Windows NT 3.1 could not be run on the final version. This affected software such as Microsoft Visual C++ 1.0 and Microsoft Fortran PowerStation.

RISC systems with Windows NT 3.1 had an even bigger disadvantage: even though they were more powerful than x86 systems, almost no 32-bit applications or drivers were ported to these platforms. 16-bit applications ran much slower under RISC systems because of the 80286 emulation compared to x86 systems which could run 16-bit applications natively, and DOS and 16-bit applications which depended on 386 calls could not be run at all on RISC systems.

However, not all reception was negative; the multitasking capabilities of the operating system were rated positively, especially compared to Windows 3.1. Compared to the size of the operating system, the installation turned out to be very easy, even though installing from floppies was a very time-consuming task. The &quot;Advanced Server&quot;, intended to be the successor to the unsuccessful LAN Manager product, was technically much superior to its predecessor, and only failed to gain success because it shared the same problems with its workstation pendant, such as the low performance running 16-bit applications. The &quot;Advanced Server&quot; provided a financial advantage for large networks because its price was not dependent on the number of clients, unlike its competitor Novell NetWare.

With Windows NT, Microsoft entered a market it could not previously address and which was mostly dominated by Unix, Novell NetWare and OS/2. A test performed by the InfoWorld magazine in November 1993, where the networking capabilities of several operating systems were tested, showed that Windows NT 3.1 was seriously lacking in inter-client communication: it could only connect to its own server via NetBEUI; attempts to connect to Unix, NetWare and OS/2 all failed because no client software was available. For the &quot;Advanced Server&quot;, only their own client, the Macintosh and, if only limited, OS/2 were able to connect to the server.

Even though the operating system&#x27;s actual success was only moderate, it had a huge lasting impact. Developers of Unix derivations for the first time strived to standardize their operating systems, and Novell was so concerned about its market share that it bought a Unix vendor. Manufacturers of microprocessors hoped to use the portability of the new operating system to increase their own sales, and thus ports of Windows NT were announced for various platforms, like the Sun SPARC architecture and the Clipper architecture. It was recognized that Windows NT would dominate the desktop market as soon as the hardware became powerful enough to run the operating system at an acceptable speed. Eight years later, Microsoft would unify the consumer-oriented Windows line (which had remained MS-DOS based) with the NT line with the October 2001 release of Windows XP—the first consumer-oriented version of Windows to use the NT architecture.

<text>Windows NT 3.5 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed by Microsoft and oriented towards businesses. It was released on September 21, 1994, as the successor to Windows NT 3.1. One of the primary goals during its development was to improve the operating system&#x27;s performance. As a result, the project was codenamed &quot;Daytona&quot;, after the Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. Windows NT 3.5 was succeeded by Windows NT 3.51, released in 1995. Support and updates for Windows NT 3.5 was ended by Microsoft on December 31, 2001.

==Features==
Windows NT 3.5 comes in two editions: &quot;NT Workstation&quot; and &quot;NT Server&quot;. They respectively replace the &quot;NT&quot; and &quot;NT Advanced Server&quot; editions of Windows NT 3.1. The Workstation edition allows only 10 concurrent clients to access the file server and does not support Mac clients.

Windows NT 3.5 includes integrated Winsock and TCP/IP support. (Its predecessor, Windows NT 3.1, only includes an incomplete implementation of TCP/IP based on the AT&amp;T UNIX System V &quot;STREAMS&quot; API.) TCP/IP and IPX/SPX stacks in Windows NT 3.5 are rewritten. NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) support as a compatibility layer for TCP/IP was introduced as also the Microsoft DHCP and WINS clients and DHCP and WINS servers.

Windows NT 3.5 can share files via the File Transfer Protocol, and printers through the Line Printer Daemon protocol. It can act as a Gopher, HTTP, or WAIS server,&lt;ref name=&quot;TCP/IP in Windows NT 3.5&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and includes Remote Access Service for remote dial-up modem access to LAN services using either SLIP or PPP protocols. &quot;Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit&quot; includes the first implementation of Microsoft DNS.

Other new features in Windows NT 3.5 include support for the VFAT file system, Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) version 2.0 and support for input/output completion ports. Microsoft updated the graphical user interface to be consistent with that of Windows for Workgroups 3.11. NT 3.5 shows performance improvements over NT 3.1, and requires less memory.

==Limitations==
A lack of drivers for PCMCIA cards limited NT 3.5&#x27;s suitability for notebook computers.

To install Windows NT 3.5 on a computer that has a sixth-generation or later x86 processor, one has to modify files on the installation CD-ROM.

==Reception==
In July 1995, Windows NT 3.5 with Service Pack 3 was rated by the National Security Agency as complying with Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) C2 criteria.
== Source code ==
In May 2020, the full source code for the second release candidate build (build 782.1) of Windows NT 3.5, along with source code for the original Xbox, leaked onto the Internet.

<text>Windows NT 3.51 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed by Microsoft and oriented towards businesses. It is the third version of Windows NT and was released on May 30, 1995, eight months following the release of Windows NT 3.5. The most significant enhancement offered in this release was that it provides client/server support for inter-operating with Windows 95, which was released almost three months after NT 3.51. Windows NT 4.0 became its successor a year later. Mainstream support for Windows NT 3.51 Workstation ended on December 31, 2000, and extended support ended on December 31, 2001, while Windows NT 3.51 Server mainstream support ended on September 30, 2000, followed by extended support on September 30, 2002. Both editions were succeeded by Windows NT 4.0 Workstation and Windows NT 4.0 Server, respectively.

==Overview==
The release of Windows NT 3.51 was dubbed &quot;the PowerPC release&quot; at Microsoft. The original intention was to release a PowerPC edition of NT 3.5, but according to Microsoft&#x27;s David Thompson, &quot;we basically sat around for 9 months fixing bugs while we waited for IBM to finish the Power PC hardware&quot;. Editions of NT 3.51 were also released for the x86, MIPS, and Alpha architectures.

New features introduced in Windows NT 3.51 include PCMCIA support, NTFS file compression, replaceable WinLogon (GINA), 3D support in OpenGL, persistent IP routes when using TCP/IP, automatic display of textual descriptions when the mouse pointer was placed on toolbar buttons (&quot;tooltips&quot;) and support for Windows 95 common controls.

In view of the significant difference in the kernel base, Windows NT 3.51 is readily able to run a large number of Win32 applications designed for Windows 95. More recent 32-bit applications will not work, as the developers have prevented their application from working with any Windows version earlier than Windows 98, and also because some applications do not work properly with the older Windows NT 3.51 interface.

Despite this, Microsoft in their application releases muddied the issue, releasing 32-bit versions of Microsoft Office right up to Office 97 (the last version of Microsoft Office supported on NT 3.51), but relying upon 16-bit versions of Internet Explorer technology from versions 3.0 to 5.0. Web browsers based on and including Firefox were operable up to version 2.0.0.22, released in April 2009; they required a few manual file updates to work without compromising browsing security.

Windows NT 3.51 is the last of the series to be compatible with the Intel 80386 processor.

===NewShell===
On May 26, 1995, Microsoft released a test version of a shell refresh, named the &quot;Shell Technology Preview&quot;, and often referred to informally as &quot;NewShell&quot;. This was the first incarnation of the modern Windows GUI with the Taskbar and Start menu. It was designed to replace the Windows 3.x Program Manager/File Manager based shell with Windows Explorer-based graphical user interface. The release provided capabilities quite similar to that of the Windows &quot;Chicago&quot; (codename for Windows 95) shell during its late beta phases; however, it was intended to be nothing more than a test release. There was a second public release of the Shell Technology Preview, called &quot;Shell Technology Preview Update&quot; made available to MSDN and CompuServe users on August 8, 1995. Both releases held Windows Explorer builds of 3.51.1053.1. The preview program provided early feedback for the &quot;Shell Update Release&quot;, the next major Windows NT version with the new interface built-in, which was released in July 1996 as Windows NT 4.0.

=== Updates ===
Five Service Packs were released for NT 3.51, introducing both bug fixes and new features. Service Pack 5, for example, fixed issues related to the Year 2000 problem.

==Hardware requirements==

Supported EIDE addressing schemes include logical block addressing (LBA), ONTrack Disk Manager, EZDrive, and extended cylinder-head-sector (ECHS).

<text>Brassington is a village and civil parish in the Derbyshire Dales district of Derbyshire, 16 miles north west of Derby. The parish had a population of 573 at the 2011 census.

The name, spelled &quot;Branzingtune&quot; in the Domesday Book, is thought to mean &quot;Brand&#x27;s people&#x27;s place&quot;. Most of the houses in the village are built of local limestone, and most are 200 or 300 years old; there are 20th-century houses at the south end of the village.

The oldest dated house, named Tudor House since the late 19th century, was built in 1615. It is located on Town Street () and was an inn until 1820, when it was bought by the parish and was used as a workhouse until 1848. There were 15 inmates at the 1841 census, but the number rose considerably in 1845, when the Brassington Poor Law Union was wound up and Brassington joined the new Ashbourne Union. The Brassington workhouse, augmented by the nearby George and Dragon pub, served the new union while a new workhouse was built in Ashbourne. The workhouse could hold 130 inmates. The house has been a private house since 1848, and its owner in the 1890s added the words Tudor House to its 1615 datestone. This has the initials of Thomas Westerne, its builder, and his wife Anne.

The Norman church, repaired and enlarged in the 19th century, stands on the north side of the steep valley in which the village lies. There were formerly three Nonconformist chapels, two of which are now closed and one demolished. The former Congregational chapel, at the northern entrance to the village, is now the village hall; the Primitive Methodist chapel, built by its members in 1834 above the church on the hillside, is a private house; the Wesleyan Reform chapel, at the west end of the village, was demolished in 2007. A house built on the site incorporates a plaque formerly set high on the chapel&#x27;s frontage and a brass commemorative plate. In addition to the village hall, a meeting place was provided in the 1990s by a British Legion building in the village centre. There are two pubs, the Olde Gate (where Bonnie Prince Charlie’s soldiers were billeted on their march to London and some of the oak beams came from ships of the Spanish Armada) which has a 1616 datestone and a largely 19th-century interior, and the Miners Arms, which was modernised thirty years ago, and which was once the venue for the manor court and the lead miners&#x27; Barmote Court. The school was built in 1872, after the passing of the 1870 Education Act, and is now a primary school.

In addition to agriculture, which still provides employment for a few villagers, Brassington was for centuries dependent on lead mining. The rough ground to the east, west and north has the hillocks and hollows of hundreds of abandoned mines; there are also remains of the miners&#x27; buildings on some of the sites. There is current employment in the village in heavy goods transport, steel fabrication and furniture manufacture, though most of the villagers are employed elsewhere. Until recently, there was no shop, but in July 2014 the village became the second in the UK (after Clifton, Derbyshire) to have a &#x27;Speedy Shop&#x27; installed by local business Villagevending.com. The shop sells a range of essentials and other items using an automatic retailing machine styled like a traditional shop. There are bus services to Ashbourne and Wirksworth.

The nearby Harboro&#x27; Rocks and Rainster Rocks are dolomitic limestone outcrops. Harboro&#x27; Rocks has a history of mining lead and baryte. Harboro&#x27; Cave is a natural cavern which was occupied as far back as the Ice Age and it is a Scheduled Monument. The remains of a Romano-British settlement at Rainster Rocks is also a protected Scheduled Monument.

The Limestone Way long-distance footpath passes close to the village.

<doc id="984892" wikidata="Q294914" url="?curid=984892" title="Eugene Sawyer">
<text>Eugene Sawyer Jr. (September 3, 1934January 19, 2008) was an American businessman, educator, and politician. Sawyer was selected by the Chicago City Council as the 53rd Mayor of Chicago, Illinois after the sudden death of then–mayor Harold Washington. Sawyer served for the remainder of the term, from December 2, 1987 until April 24, 1989. A member of the Democratic Party, Sawyer was an alderman, and the second African-American to serve as mayor of Chicago.

==Early life and career==
Born to Bernice and Eugene Sawyer Sr. in Greensboro, Alabama, the oldest of six children, Sawyer spent summer vacations in Chicago with his aunt during his childhood. Sawyer attended Alabama State University, where he joined the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He graduated from Alabama State in 1956 with bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry. He had a brief stint as a chemistry and mathematics teacher in Prentiss, Mississippi, before moving to Chicago to do laboratory work in 1957. Shortly after moving to Chicago, Sawyer took a job in Chicago’s Department of Water, where he worked from 1959 until 1971. While working for the city&#x27;s water department, Sawyer became involved with the Sixth Ward Regular Democratic organization and the Young Democrats (YD) through family friends, becoming the organization president and financial secretary in October 1968.

==Chicago Alderman (1971–1987)==
In February 1971, Sawyer was elected Alderman of Chicago&#x27;s 6th ward. By 1987, he was the longest-serving black alderman on the Chicago City Council. The sudden death of Mayor Harold Washington created a vacancy at city hall. With David Duvall Orr serving as interim mayor, the city council met to select a permanent successor as mayor. Washington&#x27;s supporters in the city council split, with some supporting Alderman Sawyer, but most voting for Timothy C. Evans. The City Council elected Sawyer mayor in a tumultuous and lengthy meeting. Having received the majority of votes from the council’s white aldermen, Sawyer faced accusations of &quot;selling out&quot; to the white community, which led to protests from Evans’ supporters.

==Mayor of Chicago (1987–1989)==
It is an urban legend that Sawyer&#x27;s inauguration as mayor occurred in the parking lot of a closed restaurant at North and Bosworth Avenues at 4:01 am on December 2, 1987, in an effort to avoid public demonstration. In fact, he was sworn in at the Chicago City Council chambers. He was soft-spoken, which led to local media to refer to him as &quot;Mr. Mumbles&quot;, or &quot;Mayor Mumbles&quot;.

Sawyer enacted Washington&#x27;s budget for the 1988 fiscal year. In January 1988, Sawyer was able to get the council to approve legislation that broke the taxi monopoly in the city, something which Washington had been unable to do.

Despite the division surrounding his selection, Sawyer pushed several initiatives through the city council, including the installation of lights at Wrigley Field and the Clean Indoor Air Ordinance, which banned indoor smoking. Building on groundwork laid under Mayor Washington, Sawyer championed the Human Rights Ordinance, passed in 1988, to protect individuals against discrimination. This was the first Chicago city ordinance to assert the rights of gay and lesbian Chicagoans.

Sawyer helped spur private development of land surrounding O&#x27;Hare International Airport.

Sawyer reached an unprecedented four-year agreement with the firemen&#x27;s union.

In 1989, Sawyer ran for election in his own right. In the Democratic primary election, Richard M. Daley, the son of the late mayor Richard J. Daley, defeated Sawyer, taking 57% of the vote to Sawyer’s 40%.

===Approval ratings===
Sawyer was less popular a mayor than his predecessor, Washington, but still enjoyed a respectable approval rating. Nevertheless, polling showed that Chicagoans had doubt in Sawyer&#x27;s leadership capabilities: a 1988 &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; poll showed that 55% of residents did not think of Sawyer as being &quot;strong, decisive, and independent&quot;, and 54% did not think he was an &quot;effective leader&quot;.

==Retirement and death==
After losing the mayoral contest, Sawyer lost his reelection bid for Democratic committeeman of the 6th Ward and subsequently retired from politics. After retiring from politics, he became involved in business again. Sawyer was also an active member of the Vernon Park Church of God in Chicago&#x27;s Pill Hill neighborhood.

In 1998, Sawyer suffered a stroke.

Sawyer died at age 73 on Saturday, January 19, 2008, at approximately 11 PM after a series of strokes and other health setbacks over the previous month. Public viewing for Sawyer took place on January 25 and his funeral took place on January 26 followed by burial at Oak Woods Cemetery, where Harold Washington is buried. Sawyer&#x27;s mayoral papers are available as the Eugene Sawyer Collection at Special Collections department of the Chicago Public Library located in the Harold Washington Library.

==Personal life==
Sawyer was married to Veronica Smith-Sawyer from September 7, 1996 until his death. From 1955 until 1984, Sawyer was married to Eleanor Taylor. Together, they had three children; sons, Roderick and Shedrick, and a daughter, Sheryl Sawyer McGill. Roderick followed his father into politics. In 2011, Roderick Sawyer was elected as 6th ward alderman, the same post which his father had held.

<text>Thomas Richard Fogerty (November 9, 1941 – September 6, 1990) was an American musician, best known as the rhythm guitarist for Creedence Clearwater Revival. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.

==Biography==
Tom Fogerty was born in Berkeley, California, United States. He began singing rock and roll in high school. He and his younger brother, John, had separate groups. Tom&#x27;s band, Spider Webb and the Insects (which featured Jeremy Levine of the Seeds), signed a recording contract with Del-Fi Records but broke up in 1959 before releasing any records. The Blue Velvets—a group led by John—began backing Tom. Eventually Tom joined the band, and the group recorded three singles (with Tom on lead vocals) for Orchestra Records in 1961 and 1962. By the mid 1960s, the group had been renamed The Golliwogs and were recording with Fantasy Records, with Tom and John sharing lead vocal duties. In 1967, the band was again renamed—this time to Creedence Clearwater Revival—and John had become full-time lead singer and primary songwriter. During the few years of the life of CCR, Tom sang backing vocals and wrote songs, but only one of his songs from when CCR was named the Golliwogs (&quot;Walking on the Water&quot;) was re-recorded and chosen to be put on CCR&#x27;s debut album. This lack of vocal and songwriting opportunity, along with festering, long-standing animosity with his brother, led him to leave the band in early 1971, after finishing the recording of &quot;Pendulum&quot;.

After leaving the band, Fogerty began performing and recording as a solo artist. He had minor hits like &quot;Goodbye Media Man&quot;, &quot;Cast The First Stone&quot;, &quot;Joyful Resurrection&quot;, and &quot;B.A.R.T&quot;. He remained with Fantasy Records and his 1971 solo debut album, &quot;Tom Fogerty&quot;, reached No. 78 on the Billboard 200 chart. In 1971 and 1972 Fogerty played rhythm guitar in the Saunders-Garcia band, mostly in Bay Area clubs. On his follow-up album, &quot;Excalibur&quot;, Jerry Garcia and Merl Saunders played on the sessions. Stu Cook and Doug Clifford (CCR&#x27;s former bass guitarist and drummer) as well as John Fogerty performed on the 1974 follow-up album, &quot;Zephyr National&quot;. The song &quot;Mystic Isle Avalon&quot; features a complete reunion of CCR though John Fogerty recorded his parts separately. It was the only song that John played on and the last time all four members of CCR would play on the same studio album.

Cook and Clifford also backed Tom on his fourth LP release of 1974 titled &quot;Myopia&quot;.

Throughout the rest of the 1970s and 1980s, Tom Fogerty continued to record, both solo and as part of the group Ruby.

Later, Tom re-signed with Fantasy. At the October 1980 reception for Tom&#x27;s marriage to Tricia Clapper, all four members of CCR reunited and performed for the first time in a decade. They took the stage once more for a final time at a school reunion three years later. Tom Fogerty lived in Scottsdale, Arizona, for the remainder of his life.

==Death==
Fogerty died of tuberculosis on September 6, 1990. In the time leading up to his death, Fogerty suffered from AIDS, which his family believed he contracted from a blood transfusion he received while undergoing back surgery. 

Fogerty was survived by his second wife Tricia Clapper and six children.

<doc id="984901" wikidata="Q399612" url="?curid=984901" title="Julian Sidney Rumsey">
<text>Julian Sidney Rumsey (April 3, 1823 in Batavia, New York – April 20, 1886 in Chicago, Illinois) served as mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1861–1862) as a member of the Republican Party.

==Early life==
Rumsey was born on April 3, 1823 in Batavia, New York.

==Early career==
Rumsey arrived in Chicago on July 28, 1835, to work at Newberry &amp; Dole, a shipping company owned by his uncles. For many years he worked as a clerk at the firm. When Mr. Newberry retired from the firm, Rumsey and his brother George became partners at the firm, which became Dole, Newberry &amp; Co. Prior to the Rumseys becoming partners, the company had been focused solely and transporting freight. However, soon after they became partners the company began to focus on purchasing grain, operating out of a small warehouse on the North Side of the city. In September 1939, the firm sent the first-ever shipment of grain made in Chicago (2,900 bushels cosigned to Black Rock, New York). In 1852 Dole retired, and the firm, which for a time thereafter became known as Rumsey Brothers. The firm thereafter focused exclusively on the grain commission business. Later, Henry Towner joined as a partner and the firm was renamed Rumsey Brothers &amp; Co, a name it would hold for decades thereafter. Rumsey remained in the grain business for the rest of his life.

Rumsey was a charter member of the Chicago Board of Trade, and remained a continuous member from its founding until his death. At the time of Rumsey&#x27;s death, the only living charter member who had similarly maintained uninterrupted membership was Marcus C. Stearns. In 1859, he was elected president of the board of trade. As president, he implemented bold changes, which included obtaining a new charter for the board as well as putting in place a modernized system of grain inspection and grading. The latter achievement earned him the title of the &quot;Father of Grain Inspection.&quot; His efforts to implement strict inspection standards helped to give Chicago a strong reputation among American grain markets.

==Political involvement in the lead-up to the Civil War==
Rumsey always took an interest in national and state politics, but had never been a major shaker in politics nor an office-seeker. However, he became more active amid the lead-up to the Civil War. He was an acquaintance of Abraham Lincoln (president-elect of the United States), and at this time regularly visited Lincoln in Springfield, Illinois to consult with him during Lincoln&#x27;s presidential transition.

In this time period, he became an executive member of the Union&#x27;s first War Finance Committee, and also served as a member of the central committee of the Illinois Republican Party.

==Mayoralty==
In 1861, Rumsey was elected mayor of Chicago, defeating Democratic nominee Thomas Barbour Bryan. During the mayoral campaign, the Civil War officially broke out. Rumsey did much to arouse the enthusiasm of his fellow citizens in favor of the preservation of the Union. At the mass meeting in Metropolitan Hall a few days after the Battle of Fort Sumter, Rumsey delivered a stirring address. Neither Rumsey nor his opponent had been personally interested in becoming mayor, with each being reluctantly drafted into candidacies.

Rumsey was sworn in as mayor on May 6, 1861.

As mayor, Rumsey required all Chicagoans to take an oath of loyalty.

Rumsey&#x27;s mayoralty ended on May 5, 1862, when he was succeeded in office by Democrat Francis Cornwall Sherman, who had won election in that year&#x27;s election.

==Post-mayoralty==
At the time of the Panic of 1873 he was president of the Corn Exchange National Bank.

After the Great Chicago Fire, Rumsey served as Cook County treasurer from 1871 through 1873.

In 1869, he founded the Illinois Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

==Personal life==
In 1848, Rumsey married the daughter of John B. Turner (Northwestern Railway president), with whom he had many children.

==Death==
Rumsey died on April 20, 1886 of progressive paresis that occurred after a short period of illness. He is buried in Graceland Cemetery.

He was survived by his widow and nine surviving adult children (three sons and six daughters).

==Memorials==
Rumsey Avenue, which runs NE/SW between the intersections of 87th St. &amp; Pulaski and 85th St. &amp; Hamlin, on Chicago&#x27;s far Southwest Side, is named for him.

<text>John Blake Rice (May 28, 1809 – December 17, 1874) was an American male actor, theatrical producer and politician. He served as the mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1865–1869) as a member of the Republican Party.

==Early life and career==
Rice was born in Easton, Maryland, and made his acting debut in Annapolis in 1829. His first professional role was as Uncle Barnwell in George Lillo&#x27;s &quot;The London Merchant&quot;. He toured up and down the East Coast, as well as in the West Indies. While living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he married into a local theatre family. By 1839, he moved his family to Buffalo, New York, where he managed a theatre during the summers. In winter, he managed a theatre in Albany.

Rice arrived in Chicago in 1847 to work as an actor and entertain the politicians at the River and Harbor Convention, Chicago&#x27;s first national convention. He decided to stay and establish a permanent theater, called Rice&#x27;s Theater. On July 30, 1850, in the middle of Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s opera &quot;La Sonnambula&quot;, a fire broke out in the theater. Rice addressed the crowds, saying &quot;Sit down. Do you think I would permit a fire to occur in my theater?&quot; The crowd sat, but a prompter stage-whispered to Rice that the theater was on fire and panic ensued. The theater was destroyed, and he lost about $4,000. When a benefit only raised $60, he left Chicago for Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Rice returned to Chicago in 1851 and built a new theater, entirely of brick. He hired James McVicker to serve as manager, and was active in the theater until 1857.

==Mayoralty==
In 1865, near the end of the Civil War, Rice ran for mayor of Chicago as a very conservative Republican. Aided by the end of the war and the subsequent assassination of Abraham Lincoln only days before the election, Rice won easily.

Rice was sworn in as mayor on May 3, 1865.

As mayor, Rice was anti-labor, and he vetoed a plan to enforce an eight-hour work day. This veto led to a spontaneous demonstration on May 1, 1867, by workers which led to the international May Day observance. The City Council eventually overrode his veto.

Rice and the City Council were connected with graft, prostitution and gambling.

Rice was reelected in 1867.

Rice was defeated in his bid for a third term by Roswell B. Mason in 1869. Rice&#x27;s mayoralty ended on December 6, 1869, when he was succeeded Mason.

==Congressional career==
Rice was elected to represent Illinois&#x27;s 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives in 1872. While serving in the House, he died from liver cancer on December 17, 1874, in Norfolk, Virginia. He died on December 17, 1874, in a home he constructed in Norfolk, Virginia. Rice had been in ill health for some time, even before his election to congress, but refused medical treatment. He was survived by his widow and five daughters. He had not sought re-election in 1874, and his death soon after the election raised issues about whether Illinois Governor John Beveridge was required to appoint a replacement to complete his term. In the end, Bernard G. Caulfield won a special election to complete the term, after having already been elected to succeed Rice. Rice was buried in Chicago&#x27;s Rosehill Cemetery.

<text>Harvey Doolittle Colvin (December 18, 1815 – April 16, 1892) was an American politician. Colvin is best remembered for his stint as mayor of Chicago, Illinois from 1873 to 1875 as a member of the People&#x27;s Party, a pro-liquor factional offshoot of the Republican Party centered in that city.

==Early life==
Harvey Doolittle Colvin was born December 18, 1815, in Herkimer County, New York.

==Political career==
Immediately prior to serving as Chicago&#x27;s mayor, Colvin served as the city&#x27;s treasurer. In the 1873 Chicago mayoral election, he ran against acting mayor Lester L. Bond and won with 60% of the vote. Colvin was sworn as mayor on December 1, 1873. His campaign was supported by political boss Michael Cassius McDonald. One month after taking office as mayor, Colvin was met with a mass demonstration at City Hall when more than 12,000 unemployed workers marched for jobs and relief. The crowd dispersed after being promised the city would provide relief when an alderman offered to buy them food throughout the winter if the city would reimburse him.

Colvin&#x27;s administration repealed a Sunday ban on liquor sales which his predecessor, Joseph Medill and Bond supported. In 1874, Colvin&#x27;s administration was rocked by allegations of patronage and a scandal in the city treasurer&#x27;s office. The Chicago Fire of 1874 destroyed 812 buildings and was so destructive that the Chicago Board of Underwriters refused to issue insurance policies unless Chicago reformed its fire department. A settlement was reached in which the city would require more construction using brick or stone, increase the size of the water mains, and move the lumberyards outside the city.

David Allen Gage, the City Treasurer of Chicago, was $507,704 short in the city&#x27;s accounts. He was indicted, but was acquitted. When Monroe Heath assumed the mayoralty after Colvin he discovered that the city had $5.5 million in uncollected taxes.

When the city council called for elections following the adoption of the Cities and Villages Act of 1872 in 1875, they left the office of mayor off the list of offices for the election. Despite this, Thomas Hoyne ran for the office and was elected. Colvin, however, refused to vacate the office and retained the title and position of mayor despite Hoyne&#x27;s inauguration, partly due to the support of the city comptroller.

In 1876, a state judge ordered a special election be held later in the year. Monroe Heath, the Republican candidate beat his two rivals, James J. McGrath of the Democratic Party, and Mark Kimball of Colvin&#x27;s now discredited People&#x27;s Party. Heath was sworn in as Colvin&#x27;s successor on July 24, 1876.

==Death and legacy==

Colvin died in Jacksonville, Florida on April 16, 1892. His body was buried in Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago.

==Biography==
===Early years===

John A. Roche was born in Utica, New York on August 12, 1844. He served as an apprentice to his brother for three years. He stayed in business for a long time, and had but a high school education. He was a firm believer in education and mentions this in his inaugural address.

===Move to Chicago===

In 1867, he moved to Chicago to do business. He married Emma H. Howard in 1871.

He represented Cook County in the Illinois House of Representatives for one term in 1876.

In 1887, he was the Republican nominee for mayor. He won against the Socialist candidate, Robert L. Nelson in a race that lacked a Democratic Party nominee. People admired him for his assertive and straightforward nature and history of business.

===Retirement===
After retiring, he focused his attention once again on business, and became manager and vice president of the Crane Elevator Company. In 1893 he was elected president of the Lake Street Elevated Railroad Company. He then died on February 10, 1904, one hour after a meeting, from uremic poisoning. He was buried in Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago.

<text>DeWitt Clinton Cregier (June 1, 1829 - November 9, 1898) was an American engineer and politician. He served as Mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1889–1891) for the Democratic Party.

==Early career==
Cregier worked as an engineer with the City of Chicago, and was awarded, in 1875, and in 1876, , both for fire hydrants. The latter was a combination drinking fountain, fire hydrant, and watering basin for animals. The Cregier hydrant is widely seen in old photographs of Chicago.

Cregier was also Master Mason, presided as Worshipful Master of Blaney Lodge No. 271, A.F. &amp; A.M. of Illinois for eight years, and served as Grand Master of Illinois in 1870–1871. D.C. Cregier Lodge No. 81 in Wheeling, Illinois, is named after him. He was a fifth great-grandson of Martin Cregier, first Burgomaster of New Amsterdam.

Cregier served as the chief engineer of the Chicago water system, and subsequently as Chicago&#x27;s Commissioner of Public Works during the first mayoralty of Carter Harrison Sr. Cregier came into conflict with Harrison when Cregier&#x27;s own ambition to someday become mayor became apparent.

==Political career==

In the 1887 Chicago mayoral election, the city&#x27;s Democratic Party tried nominating him, but he declined their nomination. Ultimately, no Democrat would run in the election.

Cregier won the 1889 Chicago mayoral election as the Democratic Party nominee, defeating incumbent Republican mayor John A. Roche. Cregier was sworn in as mayor on April 15, 1889.

As mayor, Cregier, alongside former Illinois Central Railroad president Edward Turner Jeffery and businessman Thomas Barbour Bryan, delivered the presentation for Chicago&#x27;s successful bid to the fifteen member United States Senate committee that decided what location would be awarded the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition.

Cregier lost his bid for reelection in the 1891 Chicago mayoral election. He had first seen Carter Harrison Sr. challenge him for the Democratic nomination. Cregier was able to win renomination over Harrison, as the local Democratic political machines had supported Cregier as they found him to be even more accommodating to them than Harrison had been. However, he lost the election in a four-way race, featuring Carter Harrison Sr. as an independent Democrat, Hempstead Washburne as the Republican nominee, and Elmer Washburn as the &quot;Citizens&quot; nominee. Cregier placed second, losing to Republican nominee Hempstead Washburne.

Cregier&#x27;s tenure as mayor ended on April 27, 1891.

In the 1893 Chicago mayoral election, Cregier ran as the nominee of the new &quot;Citizens Party&quot;, but received little support.

He died at his home in Chicago on November 9, 1898, and was buried at Rosehill Cemetery.

==Legacy==
In October 2011, a biography of Cregier entitled: &quot;The New York Orphan Who Built Chicago&quot; subtitled: &quot;The Story of DeWitt Clinton Cregier A 19th-Century American Engineering Genius&quot; was published, written Gloria Cregier Emma, one of Cregier&#x27;s last surviving two grandchildren.

<text>Hempstead Washburne (November 11, 1851April 13, 1918) was a Republican attorney and politician from Illinois who served as Mayor of Chicago from 1891 to 1893. He was the son of United States Secretary of State Elihu B. Washburne.

==Early life and career==
Hempstead Washburne was born in Galena, Illinois on November 11, 1851, and attended Maine&#x27;s Kents Hill School. He studied at the University of Bonn in Germany, and graduated from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1874. In 1875, he completed supplemental legal education at Union College of Law (now Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law).

Washburne practiced law in Chicago. In 1880 he was appointed master in chancery for the Superior Court of Cook County. In 1885 he was elected Chicago city attorney. He was reelected in 1887, but declined to run again in 1889.

==Mayoralty==
In 1891, Washubrne was elected as mayor of Chicago, defeating Democratic incumbent DeWitt Cregier in a four-way race which also included former mayor Carter Harrison Sr. (running as an independent Democrat) and Washburne&#x27;s own cousin once-removed Elmer Washburn. Washburne was sworn in as mayor on April 27, 1891. As mayor, he presided over development of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. He did not seek reelection 1893, and was succeeded as mayor by Democrat Carter Harrison Sr. on April 17, 1893.

Washburne&#x27;s final act as mayor was to submit vetoes of two ordinances that the council had already passed, one which served the interests of the Midland Elevated Railway (which stockbroker James R. Keene held significant stake in) and another which would have granted the Hygeia Springs Company permission to supply water into the city. (which would have advanced controversial project by Wisconsin businessman James C. McElroy to pipe water from the famed springs in Waukesha, Wisconsin to the grounds of the world&#x27;s fair). Similarly, Harrison immediately submitted his own vetoes of these ordinances immediately after delivering his inaugural address. All vetoes were sustained.

==Later life and career==
After leaving the mayor&#x27;s office, Washburne resumed practicing law, and became active in several business ventures. He also stayed active in government by serving on Chicago&#x27;s civil service commission. He suffered a stroke and died in Chicago on April 13, 1918. He was buried at Graceland Cemetery.

==Family==

In 1883, Washburne married to Annie M. Clarke (1856-1939), a stage actress and the daughter of a prominent Chicago banker; they were the parents of four children.

<text>Elford Albin &quot;Al&quot; Cederberg (March 6, 1918 – April 17, 2006) was a politician from the U.S. state of Michigan.
==Biography==
Cederberg was born to dairy farmers Albin and Helen (Olson) Cederberg in Bay City, Michigan; his father and maternal grandparents were immigrants from Sweden. He attended public schools and Bay City Junior College from 1935 to 1937.

He entered the United States Army in April 1941, was commissioned as second lieutenant in July 1942, became a captain in 1943, and was assigned to the 83rd Infantry Division. He participated in the Normandy invasion, and fought in France and Germany during World War II. He was decorated with five campaign battle stars and the Bronze Star. After the war, he was manager of Nelson Manufacturing Company of Bay City from 1946 to 1952, and was mayor of Bay City from 1949 to 1953.

In 1950, Cederberg unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Roy O. Woodruff in the Republican Party primary election for the U.S. House of Representatives in Michigan&#x27;s 10th congressional district. Woodruff did not seek the nomination in 1952 and Cederberg won the Republican primary. He went on to win the general election to the 83rd Congress and was subsequently re-elected to the twelve succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1953, until his resignation December 31, 1978. Cederberg voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He became the ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Committee. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1978 to the 96th Congress, losing to Democrat Donald J. Albosta.

==Personal life==
After the end of his term in Congress, Cederberg lived in Alexandria, Virginia and was a consultant for United Technologies, RCA, and Grumman Aircraft. He moved to Florida in the late 1990s. Cederberg died of heart and kidney ailments in The Villages, Florida at the age of 88 and was interred in Elm Lawn Cemetery of Bay City. He was survived by two children from his first marriage; Tom Cederberg and Marilyn Warner. His first marriage to Arlene Munro Cederberg (1916–2001) ended in divorce. His second wife, Marguerite Kletchka Cederberg, whom he married in 1958, died in March 2006.

<text>George Bell Swift (December 14, 1845July 2, 1912; buried in Rosehill Cemetery) served as mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1893; 1895–1897) for the Republican Party. He was selected to replace the assassinated Carter Harrison III on a temporary basis as mayor pro tem in 1893 and lost a bid for election as mayor later that year. He was elected mayor when he ran in 1895.

==Early life and career==
Swift was born in Cincinnati, Ohio to Samuel W. Swift and Elizabeth Swift (born Bell). His family moved to Galena, Illinois when he was young. By his teenage years, the family was living in Chicago. Prior to serving as mayor of Chicago, Swift served two terms as an alderman from the 11th Ward (one term from 1879 to 1881 and one term from 1892 until 1894 (the latter of which he was serving during his acting mayoralty in 1893). From 1887 to 1889, he was the city&#x27;s Commissioner of Public Works.

Swift was a proponent of the City Beautiful movement.

==Acting mayoralty==
After the assassination of Carter Harrison III, the Chicago City Council selected Swift to serve as pro tempore in a heated meeting on November 4, 1893. As mayor pro tempore, Swift would be the city&#x27;s acting mayor, serving until a new mayor would be elected. Swift was sworn in as acting mayor on November 9, 1893. The following month, he lost the special election to fill the remainder of Harrison&#x27;s term, being defeated by Democrat John Patrick Hopkins. Hopkins took office as mayor on December 27, 1893, ending Swift&#x27;s acting mayoralty.

==Mayoralty==
In 1895, Swift was elected mayor of Chicago, defeating Democratic nominee Frank Wenter by a broad margin. Swift was sworn in as mayor on April 8, 1895.

Swift declined to seek reelection in 1897, and was succeeded by Democrat Carter Harrison IV on April 15, 1897.

<text>John Patrick Hopkins (October 29, 1858October 13, 1918) was American politician who served as the 35th mayor of Chicago from 1893 to 1895. A member of the Democratic Party, Hopkins was the first of nine Irish American Catholic mayors of Chicago.

Hopkins was a close friend and a political ally of Roger Charles Sullivan.

==Early life==
Hopkins was born October 29, 1858, in Buffalo, New York.

==Career==
Because his brothers and father died when Hopkins was still young, he became a provider for his family. His first job at a foundry as a boy. He later worked in Buffalo&#x27;s grain elevators.

In 1879, he moved to Chicago with his mother and sisters.

He worked for some times at the Pullman works. From 1883 to 1885 he served as a paymaster for Pullman interests.

In 1888, he founded the Started the Arcade Trading Co. in 1888, which later became the Secord and Hopkins Co.

Hopkins forged a career in Democratic politics.

===Mayoralty===
Hopkins was elected the 1893 Chicago mayoral special election, which was held after the assassination of mayor Carter Harrison Sr.

At 35 years of age when he took office, Hopkins became the youngest mayor the city had ever had.

His tenure was marred by numerous scandals, criticisms, and shortcomings. This included incidents of political corruption in the city, such as the Ogden Gas Scandal, rampant public gambling that drew the ire of the Chicago Civic Federation, an indecisive response by Hopkins to the Pullman Strike that was assailed by Republican press outlets. Additionally, the misappropriation of significant amounts of campaign contributions by Hopkins had upset many in the Chicago Democratic party, including those who belonged to the party&#x27;s former Harrison faction.

Hopkins did not seek reelection in the 1895 Chicago mayoral election

===Post-mayoralty===

Hopkins died of the Spanish flu on October 13, 1918, in Chicago. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois.

==Personal life==
Hopkins never married.

<text>Burrow Hill Cider Farm is a cider farm in Somerset, England at the base of Burrow Hill overlooking the Somerset Levels.

It has views of most of South Somerset on clear days. The cider is made in traditional vats and uses age old traditional methods of production. Every October is &quot;Apple Day&quot; when the apples are harvested from locally owned orchards.

In 2003 the company won the NFU Great British Food Award. 

==Cider Bus==
Burrow Hill Cider has a &#x27;Cider Bus&#x27; at the Glastonbury Festival selling a variety of cider-based drinks, including Hot Spiced Cider.

==Somerset Cider Brandy== 
Somerset Cider Brandy is an apple brandy that has been in written records as far back as 1678. A modern version was first produced by Burrow Hill in 1987. It reportedly became the first legal distillery in Somerset for 150 years, when, in 1989, the farm received the first full cider-distilling licence ever issued by the UK&#x27;s HM Customs and Excise.

<text>Tseng Laboratories, Inc. (also known as Tseng Labs or TLI) was a maker of graphics chips and controllers for IBM PC compatibles, based in Newtown, Pennsylvania, and founded by Jack Hsiao Nan Tseng.

==History==
===1983–1995===
Founded in 1983, Tseng Labs&#x27; first product was designed to allow IBM PCs to run the CP/M Operating System. When an OEM deal for that product was cancelled, TLI introduced a combination multifunction and graphics, called Ultrapak, which upgraded IBM PC and XT-compatible computers with some features of an IBM AT. Ultrapak also foreshadowed Tseng Labs penchant for enhancing graphics - by providing IBM Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) and Hercules Graphics Card (HGC) compatibility along with their own special 132 column text modes. These extended text modes created a successful niche for TLI - the cards were popularly used by corporations for PCs that also emulated mainframe terminals that displayed 132 columns. The UltraPAK Short (a graphics-only version of UltraPAK) was the base design for the DFI MG-150, which was reported to be the best selling MDA/HGC compatible card of all time.

Future Tseng products continued to push beyond mere IBM compatibility. ColorPAK - the company&#x27;s CGA-compatible product - offered &#x27;high resolution&#x27; 400 line graphics in 1985. The EVA and EVA/480 products of 1986 were the first recorded instances of a graphics chip company extending the IBM register set. EVA products enabled 130 more lines of graphics (640x480) than IBM EGA, as well as advanced features like hardware accelerated windowing, panning, and zooming.

Tseng migrated from a retail/commercial board supplier to OEM sales of their chips. Ultimately, Tseng Labs VGA controllers were found in PCs from major system and board companies including Compaq, Dell, IBM, NEC, STB Systems, Diamond Multimedia and several major Taiwanese add-in brands.

Tseng&#x27;s best-known products were the Tseng Labs ET3000, Tseng Labs ET4000 and Tseng Labs ET6000 VGA-compatible graphics chips, which were highly popular between 1990 and 1995 (the era of Windows 3.x). The company&#x27;s ET4000 family was noteworthy for unusually fast host-interface (ISA) throughput, despite a conventional DRAM framebuffer.

TLI was responsible for many breakthroughs in graphics common in today’s mainstream including extended register sets, packed pixel 8, 15, 16, and 24-bit color modes, the first local bus graphics designs, the first integrated local bus controller, and Image Memory Access (IMA)- a high-speed asynchronous input for video or graphics into the display buffer.

Using IMA bus, Tseng created the category of mainstream motion video accelerator with a series of video image processing circuits, branded VIPeR. VIPeR chips provided relatively high quality live and computer generated video. The chips were used in on high-end video solutions from companies like Matrox and Jazz Multimedia. Competitors integrated less elegant algorithms inside their mainstream graphics controllers - a trend Tseng followed with its latter generation of chips.

===1995–1998===
Tseng was a victim of the graphics card shakeout of the mid-1990s, losing market share to S3 Graphics and ATI Technologies.
Tseng was especially late to integrate a RAMDAC into its product-line, not succeeding until the ET6000. In the later years of the ET4000&#x27;s lifetime, the lack of an integrated RAMDAC severely hurt Tseng&#x27;s competitiveness.

Struggling to source adequate supplies of memory for their updated cards, and lacking the funds to complete development of a modern integrated 3D engine (the ET6300), the board decided to abandon plans to ship a next generation part, and chose instead to preserve the cash pile, and seek a buyout instead.

This strategy eventually resulted in the company’s engineers and graphics expertise being purchased by ATI (now a part of AMD) in December 1997. Tseng&#x27;s management chose to use the proceeds of the sale, along with the existing cash reserves, to invest in a start-up, and merged the company with pharmaceutical company Cell Pathways in 1998. The latter was acquired by OSI Pharmaceuticals in 2003.

<text>Josiah Burchett (c.1665 – 2 October 1746), of Hampstead, Middlesex, was a British naval administrator and Whig politician, who sat in the English and British House of Commons between 1705 and 1741. He was Secretary of the Admiralty in England, a position he held for almost fifty years from 26 September 1694 to 14 October 1742. In addition to his administrative duties, he was the author of the first general history of the Royal Navy, published in 1720 and based on official Admiralty records.

==Early life==
Burchett was probably the eldest surviving son of John Burchett of Sandwich and his second wife Katherine. He married on 24 December 1695, Thomasine Honywood, daughter of Sir William Honywood, 2nd Baronet.

==Career==
Burchett was clerk to Samuel Pepys, the English civil servant famous for his diary from about 1680. He fell out of favour with Pepys in about August 1687, but gained the respect and favour of Lord Admiral Edward Russell, and in June 1691 he was appointed Russell&#x27;s secretary. In this role he alternated between active service when Russell was at sea and employment at the Admiralty Board. In September 1694 he was appointed Secretary of the Admiralty and served continuously until he retired at age 76.

Burchett served on Russell&#x27;s flagship, the 100-gun HMS &quot;Britannia&quot;, at the battle of Barfleur in 1692 during the War of the Grand Alliance. In 1693 he became the Deputy Judge Advocate of the Fleet, replacing Samuel Pepys in that office.

Burchett was returned as a Whig Member of Parliament for Sandwich and as a member of the &#x27;Court Group&#x27; at the 1705 English general election. He remained MP until the 1713 British general election. He was then returned in 1721 continuing as a member for 20 years.

Using official reports received by the Admiralty, Burchett wrote the &quot;Memoirs of Transactions at Sea during the War with France&quot;, which was published in 1703 by the Queen&#x27;s Printer, Edward Jones. In 1720 he published the lengthy book &quot;A Complete History of the Most Remarkable Transactions at Sea&quot;, which was reissued in 1995 by John Hattendorf of the U.S. Naval War College. This 1720 book was the first general naval history published in the English language. This book was published by the printing firm J. Walthoe under royal licence of King George I of Great Britain and was clearly based on the official reports received in the Admiralty. Burchett&#x27;s &quot;A Complete History of the Most Remarkable Transactions at Sea&quot;, along with Thomas Lediard&#x27;s 1735 &quot;The Naval History of England&quot;, has become a key source of naval history of that era.

Burchett&#x27;s first wife died in 1713, leaving him with a son and one surviving daughter and a property at Hampstead. He married secondly on 22 July 1721, Margaret Arris, widow of Captain Robert Arris. Following her death in 1740, he married on 10 June 1740, his third wife Isabella Wood, widow of Mr. Wood, and daughter of John Robinson, MP.

==Later life and legacy==
Following his retirement with a pension of £800 p.a. Burchett spent his last years at Hampstead, where he died on 2 October 1746. His widow, who died in 1756, received a pension of £100 p.a.

Since he held the office of Secretary of the Admiralty, the key administrator of the Royal Navy, longer than any other person and had extensive official correspondence and Admiralty papers that have been preserved, his books and writings are relied upon by maritime and naval war historians. Unlike his predecessor Samuel Pepys, Burchett left no known diary or private papers. He died at age 80 at Hampstead near London.

Most of his savings were spent on a collection of about 312 paintings. The &quot;Entire and Genuine Collection of Pictures of Josiah Burchett, Esquire&quot; was auctioned by Christopher Cock from his house in the Great Piazza, Covent Garden on 6–9 April 1747. The sale included works by Kneller, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Rembrandt and Rubens.

<text>Fred A. Busse (March 3, 1866 – July 9, 1914) was the mayor of Chicago, in the U.S. state of Illinois, from 1907 to 1911.

==Biography==
Early in his career, Busse worked as a bailiff. He was one of the bailiffs in the courtroom of Judge Theodore Brentano during the high-profile murder trial of Patrick Eugene Prendergast (who assassinated Mayor Carter Harrison III).

Busse became a local Republican leader, first elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1894 and again in 1896. In 1898, Busse was elected to the Illinois State Senate. He then served as Illinois state treasurer beginning in 1902. In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed him postmaster of Chicago, a political position at that time (see USPS History). He won the 1907 election for mayor against Democratic incumbent Edward F. Dunne. In business, Busse had been Secretary and Treasurer of the Northwestern Coal Company until 1905.

===Mayor of Chicago===
Busse was elected mayor of Chicago in 1907.

Busse was sworn-in as mayor on April 15, 1907.

Busse&#x27;s mayoral tenure is noted for its extensive corruption and presence of organized crime in the city. Busse had connections and was a political ally with a number of organized crime figures. Busse&#x27;s inaction in the face of growing popular concern led to the formation of several organizations opposed to crime and desirous of cleaning up the city government. Busse&#x27;s image was used by at least one brothel owner to promote her business. While reform, both political and moral, was beginning to appear Chicago, Busse noted, &quot;They don&#x27;t need anyone sleuthing around after me. They can always get me any evening at J.C. Murphy&#x27;s saloon, Clark Street and North Avenue.&quot; By 1907, pressure was strong enough that Busse was forced to appoint a vice commission, although the commission didn&#x27;t issue a report until Busse was out of office.

As mayor, Busse was a strong supporter of the Plan of Chicago. He and the City Council established a 328-member Chicago Plan Commission in order to realize the plan.

Busse ultimately lost his bid for reelection in 1911 to Democrat Carter Harrison IV, and was succeeded by Harrison on April 17, 1911.

===Death===
He died on July 9, 1914, of valvular heart disease at 48 in Chicago, Illinois. He was buried in Graceland Cemetery.

<text>William Emmett Dever (March 13, 1862 – September 3, 1929) was an American politician. He was the mayor of Chicago from 1923 to 1927. He had previously served as a judge and before that an alderman. As an alderman and judge he would work to become the Democratic candidate for mayor for over two decades.

Born in Massachusetts but moving to Chicago in young adulthood, William Dever became an alderman and prominently supported municipal ownership of mass transit. He was a member of the Dunne wing of the local Democratic party.

As mayor, he focused on reform and infrastructure during his tenure. Later he would turn his attention to the enforcement of Prohibition despite his personal opposition to it. Such enforcement was initially effective, but indifference from government at other levels limited its efficacy and the lower amount of alcohol increased violence among bootleggers, souring Chicagoans&#x27; view on it. Losing to William Hale Thompson in 1927 over the issue, he is the last Democratic nominee in a partisan Chicago mayoral election to lose. Never in particularly good health, he retired from politics after the election and would die of pancreatic cancer two years later.

==Early life==
Dever was born in Woburn, Massachusetts and entered his family&#x27;s leather tanning business when he was fifteen. He left Woburn in 1882 and moved to Boston, where he was based while he traveled on tannery business for two years. During this time Dever met Katherine E. Conway and they married in 1885. The two would go on to adopt two sons during their marriage. When Kate noticed an ad stating that leather tanners could make good money in Chicago, the couple moved west.

Upon arriving in Chicago in 1887, Dever got a job working at a leather tannery on Goose Island and he also began taking law courses at night at the Chicago College of Law. Upon his graduation in 1890, Dever opened his own law practice.

==Aldermanic career==
Dever ran for alderman in 1900, but was defeated. He was encouraged by Graham Taylor to run again for alderman, and, in 1902, was elected alderman of the 17th Ward. Dever was elected as a steadfast supporter of municipal ownership of the city&#x27;s streetcar services amid the Chicago Traction Wars. He would maintain this position throughout his aldermanic tenure, and continue it into his later mayoralty.

Dever was regarded as an &quot;honest&quot; alderman. He had a clean voting record and was frequently endorsed by the Municipal Voters League in his runs for reelection.

Dever became one of the most influential aldermen during the first mayoralty of Carter Harrison IV Dever got heavy buzz as a potential Democratic mayoral candidate in 1905, but did not run. Dever became a key ally of pro-municipal ownership mayor Edward Fitzsimmons Dunne, who was elected in 1905. While affiliated with the Dunne wing of the Democratic Party as an alderman, Dever was on good terms with the Harrison and Sullivan wings.

In 1906, Dever faced an atypically challenging race for reelection. In retaliation for his vote in support of raising saloon license fees, saloons in his ward raised beer prices and told patrons that the new &quot;Dever tax&quot; was to blame. Active campaigning on his part and strong support from Mayor Dunne secured Dever reelection with a comfortable margin.

In 1906, Dever ran in the inaugural election of the Municipal Court of Chicago. To provide for staggered future elections, the race saw separate elections divided by the duration of terms, with separate elections being held for sets of two-year, four-year, and six-year seats. Dever ran in the race for the six-year seats. Low turnout in these judicial races coupled with the spoiler effect of William Randolph Hearst (who was engaged in a brief feud with Dunne Democrats) running his own Independence League slate hurt Democratic chances. Dever received 94,380 votes, the most of any Democratic candidate for the Municipal Court. However, he placed 20,000 votes behind the last Republican in the six-year field. He had received more votes than Ferdinand L. Barnett, a Republican candidate to a two-year seat who had received only around 90,000 votes. This led some to contend that Dever should be seated to a two-year seat in his place, arguing that holding separate elections for the different durations had been unconstitutional. Dever rejected the effort to seat him in place of Barnett, feeling that it was fueled by prejudice against Barnett (an African American), and therefore refused to challenge Barnett&#x27;s appointment to the court.

In 1907, Dever ran to fill the vacancy on the Superior Court of Cook County left after Judge Joseph E. Gary&#x27;s death in office. This election was to a partial term of four years. With Dunne&#x27;s support, he received the Democratic nomination. Dever tied his candidacy to Dunne&#x27;s re-election effort in the coinciding mayoral election and to the municipal ownership/traction issue. His Republican opponent was William H. McSurely. McSurely refused to take a stance on the traction issue, due to the fact that the court might soon review the Settlement Ordinances. Dever lost by a margin of roughly 13,000 of the nearly 340,000 votes cast, a result mirroring that of the coinciding mayoral race.

In the spring of 1908, Dever ran a spirited race against seven candidates in the Democratic primary for Cook County state&#x27;s attorney. He was supported by the Dunne wing of the party. Dever&#x27;s key opponents were Sullivan wing candidate J.J. Kern (former State&#x27;s Attorney) and Harrison wing candidate Maclay Hoyne. Kern won the primary with 28% of the vote, defeating Dever (who came second) by several thousand votes.

During Dever&#x27;s 1910 aldermanic reelection campaign, Stanley H. Kunz, political boss of the neighboring Sixteenth Ward and Chicago&#x27;s most prominent Polish American politician, slated prominent Polish American lawyer Stanley Walkowiak to primary Dever in an effort to expand Polish American political influence in the city. Dever narrowly won this primary. After this, Kunz initially attempted to get the Republicans to replace their nominee, C.J. Ryberg, with a Polish American colleague of his, before instead deciding to have Walkowiak run as an independent. Dever was backed by Carter Harrison IV, Edward F. Dunne, J. Hamilton Lewis, John Traeger, Joseph Le Buy (president of the Polish Businessmen&#x27;s Democratic Club), the Chicago Commons caucus, and the Municipal Voters League. Dever won with 2,692 votes (44%) to Walkowiak&#x27;s 1,886 (31%) and Ryberg&#x27;s 1,483 (25%).

==Judicial career==
Dever had been considering running for mayor in the then-upcoming 1911 Chicago mayoral election before being slated by Roger Charles Sullivan on the Democratic ticket for Superior Court of Cook County in the 1910 elections. It took some persuading for Sullivan to convince Dever to run for judge. Dever was elected, resigning from City Council to assume his judgeship.

Dever declined calls to run for mayor in 1915.

In 1916, due to the duration of a trial of William Lorimer for misappropriation of funds and conspiracy to defraud, which lasted two months before reaching acquittal, Dever had only three weeks to run a reelection campaign. Nevertheless, he won handily. Dever was re-elected receiving more than 98,000 votes. 

Several months into his third term on the Cook County Superior Court, Dever was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Appellate Court. and served two partial terms on the Appellate Court, eventually becoming its presiding judge. Despite serving on the Appellate Court, Dever officially remained a judge of the Cook County Superior Court, and was re-elected in 1922. After being elected mayor, he resigned from the Cook County Superior Court on April 14, 1923 and also resigned from the Appellate Court. Jesse Holdom won a special election to finish Dever&#x27;s unexpired term on the Cook County Superior Court.

Dever was assigned the initial case against those involved in the Black Sox Scandal. The arraignment began in February 1921. In March 1921, Dever rejected the prosecution&#x27;s motion to indefinitely postpone proceedings and set a prompt peremptory trial date. This resulted in Robert E. Crowe, the Cook County state&#x27;s attorney, opting to instead administratively dismiss the charges (nolle prosequi) and opted instead to present the case to a grand jury again for new indictments, to buy more time to put together a case and gather evidence. The new trial instead landed before judge Hugo Friend.

==Mayoralty==
===1923 mayoral election===

In 1923, Democratic party boss George E. Brennan selected Dever as having the best chance of defeating the incumbent, Mayor William &quot;Big Bill&quot; Thompson. Dever ran on a reform platform and Thompson withdrew from the race, with Republicans instead nominating Arthur C. Lueder, who was easily defeated by Dever.

===Mayoral term===
Dever was sworn in on April 16, 1923.

====Transit====
Early into his mayoralty, Dever had begun making plans to improve the city&#x27;s public transit, which he had previously made a central issue in his mayoral election campaign. A longtime advocate for municipal ownership (an issue which had been a hot-button topic in Chicago, particularly during the Chicago Traction Wars), Dever initiated negotiations to purchase Chicago Surface Lines and the Chicago Rapid Transit Company, making them city owned-and-operated services. Dever began also formulating plans for transit expansions and the construction of a subway.

====Prohibition and crime====
In the autumn of 1923, the focus of Dever&#x27;s administration shifted. On September 7, 1923, a shootout occurred took place at a South Side cafe between two rival groups of rum runners, killing one man. A week later the same two groups had another shootout, killing two people. He saw these shootings as an alarm that the city&#x27;s bootlegging situation had become an epidemic.

Dever himself opposed Prohibition; he was a &quot;wet&quot; Democrat. However, he observed that bootleggers had been making under-the-table payments to public officials and law enforcement, thereby corrupting the government. Also, while he disagreed with the policy of Prohibition, it was his personal philosophy that disregard for one law could foster an erosion in the regard of other laws. Because of his resolution to uphold the law, Dever became nicknamed &quot;Decent Dever&quot; by the press.

Dever launched a major law-enforcement campaign to crack-down on bootlegging. The media labeled his war on bootleggers as the &quot;Great Beer War&quot;. By the end of the year, within only one hundred days of the inauguration of this effort, Chicago was being hailed as the &quot;driest&quot; city in the nation.

Dever&#x27;s &quot;Great Beer War&quot; had earned him immense national recognition. Some national media sources speculated he might be a potential dark horse candidate for president of the United States. At the 1924 Democratic National Convention he received serious discussion as a potential vice-presidential nominee. By the end of 1924, media sources discussed him as a serious contender for the Democratic nomination for president in 1928.

As Chicago began to dry up, gangs of bootleggers had come into greater competition with one another. By early 1925, this led to the eruption of a massive gangland war. While the vast majority of Chicagoans opposed Prohibition, they had initially supported his tactics to enforce the law. However, subsequent to the onslaught of severe gang violence, the public quickly soured on it. His tactics had also only been partially successful. While he had succeeded in organizing a city government which was largely committed to enforcing the law, other governments and their agencies, such as the county government, were still permissive towards bootlegging. Additionally, certain ward politicians and police captains were still making under-the-table deals with gangs.

While Chicago acquired a reputation as a &quot;crime capital&quot;, a survey by Andrew A. Bruce (whose findings were unveiled in January 1927), contrarily, found that Chicago had no more crime than twenty other American cities the study looked at (including Kansas City, Los Angeles, Memphis, and St. Louis).

====Infrastructure====
Dever&#x27;s term in office saw many improvements to the city&#x27;s infrastructure, including the completion of Wacker Drive, the extension of Ogden Avenue, the straightening of the Chicago River and the construction of the city&#x27;s first airport, Municipal Airport.

====Schools====
As mayor, Dever generally kept the Chicago Board of Education independent from political interference. This was in contrast to Dever&#x27;s predecessor, William Hale Thompson, under whose previous mayoralty the schools had been tarnished by politics and fraud.

Early into his mayoralty, Dever appointed seven new members to the Chicago Board of Education. The Dever-shaped school board sought to find a superintendent that would strengthen the educational authority of the office, cut fiscal waste, and improve educational standards. On January 9, 1924, the board voted to appoint William McAndrew as the superintendent of Chicago Public Schools.

On December 5, 1926, in a surprise move, Mayor Dever broke his neutrality amid a school board dispute, he sided with Alderman Leo M. Brieske&#x27;s position that it would be preferable to see McAndrew replaced with a new superintendent. Dever declared that he believed the superintendent should instead be a native Chicagoan, declaring, &quot;I am heartily in accord with Alderman Brieske&#x27;s stand that Chicagoans should fill Chicago offices. We have plenty of capable persons at home, without bringing in outsiders&quot;. McAndrew remained superintendent, however.

On March 28, 1927, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that, 

=== 1927 mayoral election ===

Dever ran for re-election in 1927 against &quot;Big Bill&quot; Thompson, who defeated him by 83,000 votes.

Dever&#x27;s term as mayor ended April 18, 1927.

==Later years==
Dever went on to serve as a vice-president of a local bank, but took a leave of absence and died of cancer in 1929. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois.

<text>Frank J. Corr (January 12, 1877 – June 3, 1934) was an American politician. Corr served as the 45th mayor of Chicago, Illinois. Corr&#x27;s term was as acting mayor from March 15, 1933, following the assassination of Anton Cermak until April 8, 1933. Corr was a member of the Democratic Party.

==Biography==
Corr was born in Brooklyn, New York, and his family moved to Chicago in 1889. He graduated from Chicago-Kent College of Law in 1899. Corr was admitted to the bar, and practiced in Chicago.

In 1902, Corr was appointed assistant corporation counsel for Chicago. Although he briefly left that position to become a law partner to Judge Walter T. Stanton, he returned to the counsel&#x27;s office during the administration of Mayor William Dever. During this time, he became active in ward politics and, in 1931, was elected alderman of Chicago&#x27;s 17th Ward.

Corr was in his second term as alderman when Cermak was assassinated in March 1933. Though he was not interested in the position, probably because of ill health and the limits placed on the interim mayor&#x27;s powers, Corr yielded to the entreaties of Democratic Party leader Patrick Nash, who wanted an interim appointee to serve until a permanent replacement could be selected. Nash promised Corr that he would not have to serve an extended term and the city council then elected Corr to serve as acting mayor until the Illinois General Assembly authorized the council to appoint a permanent replacement. The city council vote was won by Edward Kelly. During Corr&#x27;s brief administration, his bodyguards killed a nineteen-year-old burglar when they heard a commotion at a hotel near Corr&#x27;s house. As Acting Mayor, Corr lacked the ability to sign tax warrants, limiting salary payments for city and school employees. When five aldermen traveled to Hot Springs, Arkansas, Corr followed them to bring them back to Chicago to ensure that his replacement could be elected quickly.

At the time of his death, Corr was serving as alderman and running uncontested for election as judge of the circuit court. With his death the night before the election, he was replaced on the ballot by Cornelius J. Harrington. He was buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery.

Corr&#x27;s father, Frank V. Corr, died four weeks before Corr.

<text>Edward Joseph Kelly (May 1, 1876October 20, 1950) was an American politician who served as the 46th Mayor of Chicago from April 17, 1933, until April 15, 1947.

Prior to being mayor of Chicago, Kelly served as chief engineer of the Chicago Sanitary District during the 1920s.

==Early life and career==
Born to Stephen, a police officer and Helen (née Lang) Kelly, he was the first of five Chicago mayors from Bridgeport of Chicago&#x27;s South Side. He did not complete grammar school but entered the labor force at age ten.

Kelly was the chief engineer of the Chicago Sanitary District in the 1920s. He was sponsored by Patrick Nash, the owner of a sewer-contracting company that did millions of dollars of business with the city.

==Political career==
===President of the South Park Commission===
In March 1924, Kelly became president of the South Park Commission. Upon his election he declared the end to an era of &quot;Deenen Republicans&quot;, a faction of South Side Republicans allied with Robert R. McCormick which had lost control of the South Park Commission in the March 1924 municipal elections.

He presided over the completion and opening of Soldier Field, which was built and operated by the South Park Commission.

Kelly organized many public ceremonies and events hosted by the venue. He made the venue the site of fundraisers and other events for charities and organizations which were supported by the Democratic Party.

===Mayor of Chicago (1933–1947)===

Following the assassination of Mayor Anton Cermak, Kelly was hand-picked by his friend, Patrick Nash, Chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party, to be the Democratic-backed candidate in the City Council&#x27;s vote on a successor for Cermak. Together, Kelly and Nash built one of the most powerful, and most corrupt, big city political organizations, called the &quot;Kelly-Nash Machine&quot;.

Kelly was Mayor of Chicago during the 1933–34 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair (Century of Progress) which took place during the Great Depression which included the successful playing of the first official Major League Baseball All-Star Game; Kelly initiated for holding a major sport event for the fair to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. Kelly was famous for banning Nelson Algren&#x27;s 1942 book &quot;Never Come Morning&quot;, a novel, from the Chicago Public Library; the ban remained in force for decades due to the outcry by Chicago Polonia upon its release.

From 1945 until 1947, Kelly served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors.

In 1937, the city received a grant and loan from the Works Progress Administration to begin construction on subways, with a groundbreaking being held December 17, 1938 for the city&#x27;s first subway. The WPA funding would only partially cover the total cost of the subway (ultimately working out to 3/4 of the total cost). Kelly was also able to obtain WPA financing for projects such as a refurbishment of Midway Airport and roadway improvements.

In 1945, the National Education Association released a report on Chicago Public Schools that issued deep condemnation of the politicization of its administration and of unethical practices by its leadership. In response to this, in March 1946, North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools threatened to revoke its accreditation of the city public high school. On April 1, 1946, Mayor Kelly created an advisory committee to address the problems in the Chicago Public Schools. The committee was led by Henry Townley Heald, and Kelly pledged that he would follow the recommendations that the committee would issue. The committee approved a majority decision on June 18, 1946, which made recommendations to change the laws dictating the administration of Chicago Public School and called for the resignations superintendent of Chicago Public Schools William Johnson and the entirety of the Chicago Board of Education. Kelly accepted all of the recommendations of the committee except their recommendation that the entire school board resign. However, in the wake of this controversy, many school board members did resign. The individuals to fill the vacancies were selected through recommendations issued by the advisory committee led by Heald. Ultimately, McCahey would retire from the board in May 1947. Kelly&#x27;s successor, Martin Kennelly, would keep the practice of having a screening committee recommend individuals to be appointed to the Chicago Board of Education.

During Kelly&#x27;s tenure, the city was finally able to unify public transit with the establishment of the Chicago Transit Authority.

===End of tenure===
In 1947, Kelly acquiesced to the Cook County Democratic Party&#x27;s decision to slate a candidate with reform credentials for mayor of Chicago, and was succeeded by Martin H. Kennelly.

Kelly was serving as Democratic National Committeeman from Illinois at the time of his death.

==Death==
Kelly died in 1950 at age 74 and was interred in Calvary Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois.

<doc id="984944" wikidata="Q29290" url="?curid=984944" title="Silver halide">
<text>A silver halide (or silver salt) is one of the chemical compounds that can form between the element silver (Ag) and one of the halogens. In particular, bromine (Br), chlorine (Cl), iodine (I) and fluorine (F) may each combine with silver to produce silver bromide (AgBr), silver chloride (AgCl), silver iodide (AgI), and four forms of silver fluoride, respectively.

As a group, they are often referred to as the silver halides, and are often given the pseudo-chemical notation AgX. Although most silver halides involve silver atoms with oxidation states of +1 (Ag+), silver halides in which the silver atoms have oxidation states of +2 (Ag2+) are known, of which silver(II) fluoride is the only known stable one.

Silver halides are light-sensitive chemicals, and are commonly used in photographic film and paper.

==Applications==

===Light sensitivity===

Silver halides are used in photographic film and photographic paper, including graphic art film and paper, where silver halide crystals in gelatin are coated on to a film base, glass or paper substrate. The gelatin is a vital part of the emulsion as the protective colloid of appropriate physical and chemical properties. The gelatin may also contain trace elements (such as sulfur) which increase the light sensitivity of the emulsion, although modern practice uses gelatin without such components.

When a silver halide crystal is exposed to light, a sensitivity speck on the surface of the crystal is turned into a speck of metallic silver (these comprise the invisible or latent image). If the speck of silver contains approximately four or more atoms, it is rendered developable - meaning that it can undergo development which turns the entire crystal into metallic silver. Areas of the emulsion receiving larger amounts of light (reflected from a subject being photographed, for example) undergo the greatest development and therefore results in the highest optical density.

Silver bromide and silver chloride may be used separately or combined, depending on the sensitivity and tonal qualities desired in the product. Silver iodide is always combined with silver bromide or silver chloride, except in the case of some historical processes such as the collodion wet plate and daguerreotype, in which the iodide is sometimes used alone (generally regarded as necessary if a daguerreotype is to be developed by the Becquerel method, in which exposure to strong red light, which affects only the crystals bearing latent image specks, is substituted for exposure to mercury fumes). Silver fluoride is not used in photography.

When absorbed by an AgX crystal, photons cause electrons to be promoted to a conduction band (de-localized electron orbital with higher energy than a valence band) which can be attracted by a sensitivity speck, which is a shallow electron trap, which may be a crystalline defect or a cluster of silver sulfide, gold, other trace elements (dopant), or combination thereof, and then combined with an interstitial silver ion to form a silver metal speck.

Silver halides are also used to make corrective lenses darken when exposed to ultraviolet light (see photochromism).

===Chemistry===

Silver halides, except for silver fluoride, are very insoluble in water. Silver nitrate can be used to precipitate halides; this application is useful in quantitative analysis of halides. 689-703 The three main silver halide compounds have distinctive colours that can be used to quickly identify halide ions in a solution. The silver chloride compound forms a white precipitate, silver bromide a creamy coloured precipitate and silver iodide a yellow coloured precipitate.

Some compounds can considerably increase or decrease the solubility of AgX. Examples of compounds that increase the solubility include: cyanide, thiocyanate, thiosulfate, thiourea, amines, ammonia, sulfite, thioether, crown ether. Examples of compounds that reduces the solubility include many organic thiols and nitrogen compounds that do not possess solubilizing group other than mercapto group or the nitrogen site, such as mercaptooxazoles, mercaptotetrazoles, especially 1-phenyl-5-mercaptotetrazole, benzimidazoles, especially 2-mercaptobenzimidazole, benzotriazole, and these compounds further substituted by hydrophobic groups. Compounds such as thiocyanate and thiosulfate enhance solubility when they are present in a sufficiently large quantity, due to formation of highly soluble complex ions, but they also significantly depress solubility when present in a very small quantity, due to formation of sparingly soluble complex ions.

===Archival use===
Silver halide can be used to deposit fine details of metallic silver on surfaces, such as film. Because of the chemical stability of metallic silver, this film can be used for archival purposes.

<text>Shout Records is a record company founded by songwriter and record producer Bert Berns in 1966.

==History==
Bert Berns was a founding father of the New York Uptown Soul genre, with rhythm and blues and soul music making up the vast majority of his body of work. Berns experienced enormous success with the establishment of his Bang Records label in 1965, with pop and rock acts such as The McCoys, Neil Diamond, and Van Morrison dominating its roster of artists. Looking to return to his original passion for rhythm and blues, Berns established Shout Records as a subsidiary of Bang Records to be an exclusive home for R&amp;B and soul music.

Berns had immediate success with Freddie Scott on Shout, with the single &quot;Are You Lonely For Me Baby&quot; reaching number one on the R&amp;B charts. A number of artists ranging from Jimmy Radcliffe to The Exciters released records on Shout. Berns&#x27; final Shout sessions with Erma Franklin resulted in &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;, which was rising up the charts when Berns died from heart failure on December 30, 1967.

Fernandez has been working full time as an Access Coordinator since April 2022. Fernandez was hired by Casarotto Ramsay &amp; Associates in 2023 as an agent to represent, train and develop talent, supporting all those with access requirements across the film, television and theatre industries.

<doc id="984948" wikidata="Q492211" url="?curid=984948" title="Martin H. Kennelly">
<text>Martin Henry Kennelly (August 11, 1887 – November 29, 1961) was an American politician and businessman. He served as the 47th Mayor of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois from April 15, 1947 until April 20, 1955. Kennelly was a member of the Democratic Party. According to biographer Peter O&#x27;Malley, he was chosen as mayor by a scandal-burdened Democratic machine that needed a reformer on top of the ticket. Kennelly was a wealthy businessman and civic leader, active in Irish and Catholic circles. As a long-time opponent of machine politics he accepted the nomination on condition the machine would not pressure him for patronage and that he did not have to play a leadership role in the party. This gave him a non-partisan image that satisfied the reform element. As mayor he avoided partisanship and concentrated on building infrastructure and upgrading the city bureaucracy. He worked to extend civil service; he reorganized inefficient departments. The city took ownership of the mass transit system. He obtained federal aid for slum clearance and public housing projects and for new expressways construction. At his death, Mayor Richard J. Daley, the party leader who defeated Kennelly in a bitter primary battle in 1955, called him, &quot;a great Chicagoan who loved his city&quot; and ordered City hall flags placed at half-mast.

==Early life==
Kennelly was born in Chicago&#x27;s Bridgeport neighborhood, the youngest of five children. He served in the Army during World War I with the rank of captain. After the war he returned to Chicago and entered the moving and storage business, and lived on the north end of Lake Shore Drive (5555 North Sheridan Road).

==Early career==
He was the founder and first president of Allied Van Lines, an alliance that united independent local moving and storage companies under a single brand. A contemporary of Marshall Field&#x27;s, a prominent Chicago retailer, Kennelly&#x27;s moving company got the contract for Chicago&#x27;s Field Museum of Natural History. After retiring, he was involved in social and civic affairs. He was the head of the Chicago chapter of the American Red Cross during World War II.

==Mayor of Chicago==

When the city administration of Edward J. Kelly was threatened with defeat by corruption, scandal and Kelly&#x27;s liberal integrationist policies (Kelly notably had said that African-Americans were free to live anywhere in the city) the Cook County Democratic Party Machine responded by slating Kennelly as a reform candidate. Kennelly returned to the Bridgeport neighborhood and ran for mayor from an apartment in the predominantly Irish American working-class community of his childhood. Kennelly was elected in 1947, receiving 920,000 (59%) votes defeating Republican Russell Root. Kennelly oversaw early milestones in the effort to establish a greater degree of self-government for the city of Chicago, creating a Chicago Home Rule Commission in 1953 to study ways for the city to obtain home rule and establish a new city charter. Kennelly proved to be too independent and reform-oriented for his regular Democratic Party sponsors and was dumped by the party bosses at the 1955 endorsement slating in favor of Richard J. Daley. Daley soundly defeated Kennelly in the 1955 Democratic Primary and went on to win the general election.

In 1952 and 1953, Kennelly served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors.

==Death==
Kennelly died from heart failure on November 29, 1961, at age 74, and was interred at Calvary Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois.

<doc id="984952" wikidata="Q176111" url="?curid=984952" title="De Havilland Heron">
<text>The de Havilland DH.114 Heron is a small propeller-driven British airliner that first flew on 10 May 1950. It was a development of the twin-engine de Havilland Dove, with a stretched fuselage and two more engines. It was designed as a rugged, conventional low-wing monoplane with tricycle undercarriage that could be used on regional and commuter routes. A total of 149 were built; it was also exported to about 30 countries. Herons later formed the basis for various conversions, such as the Riley Turbo Skyliner and the Saunders ST-27 and ST-28.

==Design and development==
In the closing stages of the Second World War, the aircraft manufacturer de Havilland began development of a new small twin-engined passenger aircraft, the DH 104 Dove, intended as a replacement for the earlier Dragon Rapide and which soon proved to be successful. As a further development, the company basically enlarged the Dove; the fuselage was lengthened to make room for more passengers or freight, and the wingspan was increased to make room for two more engines. The Heron was of all-metal construction, and was laid out as a conventional design; the resulting aircraft could use many of the parts originally designed for the Dove, thus simplifying logistics for airlines using both types.

The emphasis was on rugged simplicity to produce an economical aircraft for short- to medium-stage routes in isolated and remote areas which did not possess modern airports. The Heron was designed with a fixed undercarriage and Gipsy Queen 30 engines, which lacked potentially unreliable reduction gearboxes and superchargers.

The Heron prototype registered to the de Havilland Aircraft Company, Hatfield, UK, as &quot;G-ALZL&quot; undertook its first flight with Geoffrey Pike at the controls on 10 May 1950. The aircraft was unpainted at the time, and after 100 hours of testing was introduced to the public on 8 September 1950 at the Farnborough Airshow, still glistening in its polished metal state. By November, the prototype had received its formal British Certificate of Airworthiness and had flown to Khartoum and Nairobi for tropical trials.

The prototype was then painted and fitted out as a company demonstrator, and was tried by British European Airways in 1951 on its Scottish routes. Following the successful completion of the prototype trials as a regional airliner, series production of the Heron began. The first deliveries were to NAC, the New Zealand National Airways Corporation (later part of Air New Zealand).

Basic price for a new Heron in 1960 was around £60,000, minus radio.

==Operational service==
The first Heron, Series 1A suffered deficiencies, as NAC soon discovered. First, the aircraft was generally underpowered. Its quite heavy engines (weighing about each), had an output of only each. By comparison, later modifications or rebuilt aircraft had as much as 50% more power (in the case of the Saunders ST-27). Unlike the Dove, the Heron came with a fixed undercarriage and no nosewheel steering, which simplified maintenance, but reduced top speed. Secondly, the lightweight aluminium alloy wingspars were prone to constant cracking due to the heavy loading on the wing caused by the overweight engines and rough landings on unpaved runways. NAC resolved this by replacing the aluminium spars with heavier steel spars, reducing the performance of the Heron Series 1A (re-classified 1B) to uneconomic levels for the services required of them in New Zealand. NAC disposed of them in 1957.

After 51 Series 1 aircraft had been built, production switched to the Series 2, featuring retractable landing gear, which reduced drag and fuel consumption, and increased the top speed marginally. The 2A was the equivalent of the 1A, the basic passenger aircraft while the 1B and its successor the 2B had higher maximum takeoff weight, the 2C featured fully feathering propellers, the Heron 2D had an even higher maximum takeoff weight, while the Heron 2E was a VIP version.

In service, the Heron was generally well received by flight crews and passengers who appreciated the additional safety factor of the four engines. At a time when smaller airliners were still rare in isolated and remote regions, the DH.114 could provide reliable and comfortable service with seating for 17 passengers, in individual seats on either side of the aisle.

With its larger fuselage, passengers could stand up whilst moving down the aisle and large windows were also provided. Baggage was stored in an aft compartment with an additional smaller area in the nose. A few peculiarities appeared; passengers who filled the aft rows first would find that the Heron gently &quot;sat down&quot; on its rear skid. Pilots and ground crews soon added a tail brace to prevent the aircraft from sitting awkwardly on its tail.

Performance throughout the Heron range was relatively &quot;leisurely&quot;, and after production at de Havilland&#x27;s Chester factory ceased in 1963, several companies, most notably Riley Aircraft Corporation, offered various Heron modification kits, mainly related to replacing the engines, which greatly enhanced takeoff and top speed capabilities. Riley Aircraft replaced the Gipsy Queens with horizontally-opposed Lycoming IO-540 engines. 


One U.S. airline that carried out Riley-type conversions at their Opa Locka Airport, Florida, engineering facility was Prinair, of Puerto Rico, which replaced the Gipsy Queens with Continental IO-520 engines. Prinair also considerably stretched Heron 2 &quot;N574PR&quot; to allow extra passengers to be carried.

Connellan Airways also converted its Herons, using Riley kits. When available aircraft reached the end of their service lives, the engine conversions gave the elderly airliner a new lease of life as a number of examples were converted in the 1970s and 1980s including &quot;N415SA&quot;, a Riley Heron still flying in Sweden as of 20 May 2012 and a Riley Turbo Skyliner, tail number &quot;N600PR&quot; currently registered in the United States (this example appeared in the 1986 movie Club Paradise).

The most radical modification of the basic Heron airframe was the Saunders ST-27/-28, that changed the configuration as well as the &quot;look&quot; of the whole aircraft with two powerful turboprop engines replacing the lethargic four-engine arrangement, a stretched fuselage, the shape of the windows changed and the wingtips squared instead of rounded.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 18 April 1955, Union Aéromaritime de Transport F-BGOI, crashed into Kupe Mountain, Cameroon. 12 out of 14 passengers and crew died in the crash.
* On 7 November 1956, Braathens SAFE LN-SUR, crash-landed in heavy snow on the mountain Hummelfjell in Tolga, Norway. The pilot and one passenger were killed, whilst the remaining crew and passengers survived. The Hummelfjell accident was Braathens SAFE&#x27;s first fatal accident. The probable cause was unusually heavy icing. 
* On 28 September 1957, British European Airways G-AOFY, on an air ambulance flight, crashed on approach to Glenegedale Airport, Islay, in bad weather. The three occupants, two crew and one nurse, were killed. The pilot did not appreciate that the aircraft had rapidly lost height whilst he was making a visual half circuit to land.
* On 15 November 1957, Aviaco EC-ANZ crashed into a mountain close to the airport at Son Bonet Aerodrome in bad weather after the pilot made a navigation error at the end of a flight from Barcelona Airport. All six people on board were killed. 
* On 19 February 1958, Gulf Aviation G-APJS, on a ferry flight from Bahrain to England via Athens International Airport, crashed into a mountain near Rome after a navigational error, killing all three people on board. 
* On 14 April 1958, Aviaco EC-ANJ, crashed into the sea off the coast of Barcelona Spain after it was forced to make a sudden avoidance manoeuvre to prevent a mid-air collision. All 16 passengers and crew were killed in the crash.
* On 10 December 1958, a DH.114 1B registered as PK-GHP was written off at Jakarta.
* On 14 October 1960, Itavia I-AOMU crashed on Mount Capanne, Italy killing all 11 on board. Bad weather may have played a role in the accident.
* On 17 August 1963, Fujita Airlines JA6159 crashed just after takeoff into Mount Hachijō-Fuji, Hachijōjima, Japan; the accident killed all 19 passengers and crew in the worst disaster suffered by the de Havilland Heron.
* On 27 January 1968, Air Comoros F-OCED flight hit the runway at Moroni, Comoros and overran the runway then crashed into the sea. 15 passengers and crew died but one person survived the accident.
* On 5 March 1969, Prinair Flight 277 from Charlotte-Amalie, United States Virgin Islands to San Juan, Puerto Rico crashed into a mountain in the Fajardo, Puerto Rico area, killing all 19 on board.
* On 26 May 1970, Aero Servicios HR-ASN stalled in turbulent conditions on approach to Toncontín International Airport, killing all six people on board.
* On 24 June 1972, Prinair Flight 191 crashed near Ponce, Puerto Rico while trying to land, killing five people out of 20 passengers and crew. The cause was pilot error.
* On 23 October 1975, VH-CLS performing Connair Flight CK1263 crashed in a cane field at Holloways Beach after a missed approach to Cairns Airport, Queensland, Australia during a storm. The three crew and eight passengers were all killed.
* On 24 July 1979 PrinAir crashed on takeoff from Saint Croix-Alexander Hamilton Airport (STX) killing 8 of the 21 onboard including both pilots. The crash was attributed to the aircraft being 1060 pounds over max takeoff weight and significantly out of the rear CG limit. It was reported that the ground crew did not provide proper information to the crew for weight and balance purposes. It was also reported the aircraft was observed with the front nose bouncing up and down off the ground as the aircraft taxied for takeoff.
* On 27 December 1986, DQ-FEF operated by the Fijian airline Sunflower Airlines crashed short of runway 21 of Nadi International Airport after its right flaps jammed in flight. 11 of the 14 people on board were killed.

<text>Eamon Michael Ryan (born 28 July 1963) is an Irish former Green Party politician who served as Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and Minister for Transport from June 2020 to January 2025, and was Leader of the Green Party from May 2011 to June 2024. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin Bay South constituency from 2016 to 2024, and previously from 2002 to 2011 for the Dublin South constituency. He previously served as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources from 2007 to 2011. On 18 June 2024, he announced that he was stepping down as leader of the Green Party. He retired from politics after the 2024 general election.

==Early and personal life==
Ryan was born in Dublin in 1963 and raised in Dundrum, where he continues to live with his family. He was educated at Gonzaga College and University College Dublin, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree. He was manager of the UCD Marketing Development Programme from 1985 to 1986, and following three years of emigration and unemployment in 1989, he founded Cycling Safaris, a company which organises cycling holidays in Ireland and Europe. He married the author and journalist Victoria White in 1998 and they have four children.

==Political career==
He first held political office in 1998, when he was co-opted to Dublin City Council, taking up the seat previously held by John Gormley. He topped the poll at the 1999 local elections in the Rathmines local electoral area. From 1995 to 2002, he served on the advisory committee of the Dublin Transport Office. At the 2002 general election, he was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Green Party TD for the Dublin South constituency. He served as Green Party Spokesperson for Transport, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources during the 29th Dáil.

In 2003, Ryan protested against the use of Shannon Airport by the U.S. military for transport of combatants and arms, in violation of Ireland&#x27;s neutrality.

He announced on 13 September 2004, that he intended to seek his party&#x27;s nomination to be a candidate in the 2004 presidential election. However, when it was announced that the incumbent, Mary McAleese, was seeking a second term he withdrew. His campaign was also hit by his admission of cannabis use, an illegal drug.

===First term in government (2007–2011)===

Ryan was re-elected to the Dáil at the 2007 general election held on 24 May. On 13 June, the Green Party voted in favour of entering into a coalition government with Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats at a special party convention. Ryan was appointed to the cabinet by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources when the 30th Dáil sat the following day.

As Minister, he stated his priorities would be to improve upon the changes underway in the Irish energy sector, with strong emphasis on aiding the adaptation of renewables and building retrofitting. He also aimed to enhance communications infrastructure where Ireland had fallen behind other countries. During his period in office, installed wind capacity in Ireland doubled, and by 2010 the average daily energy derived from renewable sources (as a percentage of total demand) had increased to 17%, peaking at 42%. He also committed Ireland to the European Super Grid programme in 2009 and announced major government investment in marine energy research projects. Government schemes were expanded for home energy retrofitting as uptake increased, the National Broadband Scheme was completed, a Broadband for Schools Scheme launched, and a national electric vehicle and chargepoint initiative was announced in conjunction with the ESB Electric Ireland and Peugeot Citroën, which was subsequently implemented by the new government.

In response to the Corrib gas controversy, the environmental activist organisation Shell to Sea and its spokesperson Maura Harrington, criticised Ryan for joining Fianna Fáil in coalition as the terms of the programme for government did not include a reversal or renegotiation of the proposed gas pipeline and refinery at Broadhaven Bay, County Mayo. Before entering into government, Ryan supported the aims of the Shell to Sea campaign and attended their protests. Ryan was also criticised by Shell to Sea for failing to launch an independent review of the decision, as stipulated by the Green Party in a motion passed at their annual convention in 2007.

Ryan resigned as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on 23 January 2011, when the Green Party withdrew from government. The following day he helped broker an agreement with Fine Gael and the Labour Party which ensured the passing of the 2011 Finance bill, prior to the holding of the general election on the 25 February 2011. He lost his seat at election, receiving 6.8% of the vote.

===Green Party leader in opposition (2011–2020)===
He was one of three candidates to contest the subsequent Green Party leadership election of May 2011. He was elected leader on 27 May 2011, succeeding John Gormley. The party had no representation in the Oireachtas when he became leader.

In 2012, he became an associate with E3G working on an assessment of the development potential of the North Seas Offshore Grid Initiative in a project which was supported by the European Climate Foundation and the Children&#x27;s Investment Fund Foundation. In 2013, he organised two climate gatherings which brought international climate experts to Ireland to examine what new narratives are needed to increase public support for action on the climate issue.

He was the Green Party candidate in the Dublin constituency at the 2014 European Parliament election, but was not elected. He was elected a TD for the Dublin Bay South constituency in the 2016 general election, alongside deputy leader Catherine Martin who secured a seat in Dublin Rathdown. The Greens&#x27; return to the Dáil following their wipeout in 2011 was the first time in Irish election history that a political party had been able to survive losing all their TDs.

In 2019, Ryan called for wolves to be reintroduced to Ireland. Fine Gael rejected this suggestion, with Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht Josepha Madigan responding that her department had no plans to reintroduce wolves into the country, saying that doing so would do damage to farming. He reiterated the following January that he would like to see them introduced in his lifetime. Also in 2019, comments he made on car use in rural Ireland which were published in an article by &quot;The Irish Times&quot; was criticised online. The newspaper also stated that Ryan suggested that a village of 300 people needs just 30 cars to operate. In the article, Ryan stated people could walk to a pick-up point or cycle. Responding to the article, the party took issue with the headline, and in a statement said the original headline (&quot;You don&#x27;t need to own a car to live in rural Ireland&quot; - Green Party T.D&#x27;) had caused “a flood of online fury – and rightly so, because a suggestion like that would be ridiculous and impractical”.

In February 2020, the Green Party had its best election result in the general election of that year, with the party increasing its representation in the Dáil to 12 TDs. Ryan was re-elected in the Dublin Bay South constituency, topping the poll with 22.4% of the first-preference votes.

In March 2020, in a speech in a debate on responses to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, he made comments on growing food in the event of a supply crisis that went viral online, saying, &quot;we&#x27;ll have our salads ready to go!&quot; In June 2020, he was criticised online, particularly by Green Party councillors, for his use of the phrase &quot;you nigger&quot; when quoting director Sean Gallen on his experiences of racism. Gallen himself said that Ryan&#x27;s intentions were &quot;really good&quot; as he tried &quot;to bring up this big issue of racism within an Irish context&quot;. Ryan publicly apologised the same day as the speech.

===Second term in government (2020–2024)===
On 27 June 2020, following 139 days of negotiations, the members of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party all voted in favour of entering government together as a coalition. There had been concern that the proposal would not be accepted by the Green members, as the proposal required that it pass with 66% of the members in favour it. However, in the end, 76% of the Green Party membership voted in favour of the deal. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; journalist Pat Leahy described the vote to enter government as &quot;vindication&quot; for Ryan&#x27;s leadership of the party and suggested it would strengthen his hand in the subsequent Green Party leadership contest. Green Party rules require a leadership election within 6 months of a general election in Ireland. Ryan sought re-election, and Deputy Leader Catherine Martin also contested the position, leading to the 2020 Green Party leadership election. Ryan was considered to represent the moderate &quot;Old Guard&quot; who were in favour of entering government while Martin was considered to represent younger, more radical Green party members apprehensive about working with Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. On 23 July 2020, Ryan was re-elected as Green Party leader, defeating deputy leader Catherine Martin by 994 votes (51.24%) to 946 (48.76%).

On entering the government, Ryan was appointed as Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and Minister for Transport. He commissioned the building of nine new gas-fired power plants to prevent the risk of electricity shortages.

In June 2021, Ryan received the Green Leader Award.

On 17 December 2022, he was re-appointed to the same positions following Leo Varadkar&#x27;s re-appointment as Taoiseach. On 9 April 2024, the same occurred following Simon Harris&#x27; appointment as Taoiseach.

On 18 June 2024, following a poor showing for the Green Party in local and European elections, he announced that he was stepping down as leader of the Green Party and would not contest the 2024 general election.

<doc id="984958" wikidata="Q65359" url="?curid=984958" title="Renate Müller">
<text>Renate Müller (26 April 1906 – 7 October 1937) was a German singer and actress in both silent films and sound films, as well as on stage.

One of the most successful actresses in German films from the early 1930s, she was courted by the Nazi Party to appear in films that promoted their ideals, but refused. Her sudden death at the age of 31 was initially attributed to epilepsy, but after the end of World War II, some commentators asserted that she was in fact murdered by Gestapo officers, others that she committed suicide. The true circumstances of her death remain unknown.

==Life and career==

Born in Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria, Germany, Müller entered films in 1929 in Berlin, and quickly became popular. A blue-eyed blonde, she was considered to be one of the great beauties of her day, and, along with Marlene Dietrich, was seen to embody fashionable Berlin society. She starred in more than twenty German films, including &quot;Viktor und Viktoria&quot; (1933), one of her biggest successes, which was remade decades later as &quot;Victor Victoria&quot; with Julie Andrews. After making &quot;Sunshine Susie&quot; (1932) in England, she returned to Germany and was delayed by anti-German French officials for a short time in Paris. The incident was used by Dennis Wheatley as a basis for his short story, &quot;Espionage&quot;. The story and a short discussion of the incident are included in Wheatley&#x27;s short story collection &quot;Mediterranean Nights&quot;.

With the rise of the Nazi Party, Müller came to be regarded as an ideal &quot;Aryan&quot; woman, and, particularly in light of Dietrich&#x27;s move to Hollywood, was courted and promoted as Germany&#x27;s leading film actress.

==Death==

When Müller died suddenly, the German press stated the cause as epilepsy. However, it was later revealed that she had died as a result of a fall from a hotel (or hospital) window. According to Channel 4 documentary &quot;Sex and the Swastika&quot;, aired in February 2009, she jumped from a Berlin hospital window where she was being treated for a knee injury or drug addiction.

Officially described as a suicide, it was theorised that she took her own life when her relationship with Nazi leaders deteriorated after she showed unwillingness to appear in propaganda films. She was also known to have been pressured to end a relationship with her Jewish lover, but had refused. Near the end of her life, she became addicted to morphine and abused alcohol. Witnesses also recalled seeing several Gestapo officers entering her building shortly before she died. It has been asserted that she was either murdered by Gestapo officers who threw her from a window, or that she panicked when she saw them arrive and jumped. The true circumstances surrounding her death remain unclear.

According to Uwe Klöckner-Draga in his book &quot;Renate Müller – Ihr Leben ein Drahtseilakt&quot;, on 3 April, Goebbels wrote in his diary: &quot;Renate tells me her tale of woe. She is a sick woman.&quot; On the 6th, he mentioned that she had been interrogated in a very dishonourable way, and on 25 June: &quot;Renate Müller! I help her.&quot; At the end of September – according to her sister Gabriele – Renate was drunk and sitting on a window sill when she lost her balance.

Müller&#x27;s life and death were portrayed in the 1960 film &quot;Sweetheart of the Gods&quot;.

<doc id="984959" wikidata="Q491938" url="?curid=984959" title="Michael A. Bilandic">
<text>Michael Anthony Bilandic (February 13, 1923January 15, 2002) was an American Democratic politician, judge, and attorney who served as the 49th mayor of Chicago from 1976 to 1979, after the death of his predecessor, Richard J. Daley. Bilandic practiced law in Chicago for several years, having graduated from the DePaul University College of Law. Bilandic served as an alderman in Chicago City Council, representing the eleventh ward on the south-west side (Bridgeport neighborhood) from June 1969 until he began his tenure as mayor in December 1976. After his mayoralty, Bilandic served on the Illinois Appellate Court from 1984 until being elected to the Illinois Supreme Court in 1990. He served on the state supreme court until 2000, and was the court’s chief Justice from 1994 to 1997.

==Early life and career==
Bilandic was born in Chicago to Croatian immigrant parents Mate &quot;Matthew&quot; and Milka &quot;Minnie&quot; Bilandžić) from southern Croatia. Bilandic studied at De La Salle High School and graduated in 1940. Bilandic joined the United States Marine Corps during World War II in 1943, serving as first lieutenant until 1945. After his time in the Marine Corps, Bilandic returned to school; receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree from St. Mary&#x27;s University of Minnesota in 1947. After college, Bilandic returned to Chicago and became involved in political work. Bilandic began working in the city&#x27;s eleventh ward was asked by then–committeeman Richard J. Daley to aid the Democratic party in 1948. In 1951, Bilandic later received his Juris Doctor degree from DePaul University College of Law.

==Chicago City Council (1969–1977)==
Bilandic officially began his political career after being elected alderman of the city&#x27;s eleventh ward in the 1969 election, succeeding Matthew J. Danaher and taking office on March 11, 1969.

==Acting mayoralty (1976–77) and special election victory==

After Mayor Richard J. Daley died in office on December 20, 1976, Wilson Frost argued that as president pro tempore of the City Council he had automatically become the acting mayor. As such, he would have been the first African American to serve as mayor. However, much of the city council disputed Frost&#x27;s claim. After nearly a week of closed-door negotiations, a compromise was struck among councilors in which the city council would vote to name Bilandic to serve as acting mayor for approximately six months until a special election could be held to choose a mayor filling out the remaining two years of Daley&#x27;s unexpired term. This came with the agreed understanding that Bilandic would not run as a candidate in the special election. Other aspects of the compromise that resulted in Bilandic becoming mayor had included the council voting to name Frost the chairman of the council&#x27;s powerful Finance Committee, a position with real power as opposed to the primarily ceremonial role of president pro tempore. This served to appease African American aldermen. The compromise also included satisfying the city&#x27;s grouping of Polish American aldermen by naming Casey Laskowski (a member of the council&#x27;s Polish American bloc) to serve in the newly-created role of vice mayor. The new vice mayor position was created in aims of clarifying the mayoral succession process in the future by creating a position that would be the first-in-line to serve as an interim successor in instances of mayoral vacancy. 

On December 28 (eight days after Daley&#x27;s death), Bilandic was approved by the City Council to serve as acting mayor. No other candidates challenged him. While the vote was preceded by fiery debate, Dick Simpson and Martin J. Oberman were ultimately the sole alderman to cast dissenting votes on Bilandic&#x27;s appointment. At the same meeting that it appointed Bilandic, the council also voted for the other aspects of the compromise: naming Frost as chairman of the finance committee, Vrdolyak as president pro tempore, and Laskowski as vice mayor. Despite that he would not run in the special election, one mere week after becoming acting mayor Bilandic reneged on this promise and declared that he would be amenable to running if he was drafted to do so. Bilandic ultimately ran. Still enjoying a honeymoon period as acting mayor, he received a popular mandate to assume Daley&#x27;s mantle. In the Democratic&#x27;s primary election, he won 51.1% of the vote, handily defeating challengers Edward Hanrahan, Anthony Martin-Trigona, Roman Pucinski, Ellis Reid and Harold Washington. In the June 7 general election, Bilandic was elected mayor with 77.4% of the vote, defeating Dennis H. Block (the Republican nominee), as well as Dennis Brasky (the Socialist Labor nominee) and Gerald Rose (the U.S. Labor nominee). Bilandic delivered his inaugural address and took office on June 22, 1977.

==Mayoralty (1977–79)==
While initially popular, Bilandic&#x27;s term as mayor would prove to be short and difficult. 

A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Bilandic as the twenty-first-worst American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993.

===Labor strikes===
While he was mayor, Chicago faced several labor disputes including a gravediggers and cemetery owners&#x27; strike and a threatened strike by members of Lyric Opera of Chicago. The Chicago Butcher&#x27;s Union worked to stop stores from selling fresh meat after 6 p.m., but Bilandic managed to work out a settlement. Bilandic also had to face social unrest in June 1977 when an FALN bomb exploded in City Hall and started a two-day riot among the Puerto Rican community. Bilandic oversaw the creation of ChicagoFest, a food and music festival held on Navy Pier. The Chicago Marathon had its first running in 1977 and Bilandic participated, finishing with a time of 4 hours. A runner himself, Bilandic arranged to have five miles of unused equestrian paths along the lakefront converted to running paths.

===Blizzard of 1979===
During January 1979, a blizzard struck Chicago and effectively closed down the city, dropping a total of twenty-one inches of snow over a two-day period. The city&#x27;s slow response to the debilitating storm was publicly blamed on Bilandic. Additionally, as part of attempts to deal with the storm, Bilandic ordered Chicago &#x27;L&#x27; trains to bypass many intermediate stops, particularly affecting black neighborhoods on the South Side of the city, and angering that large voter base.

=== Urban development ===
In November 1978, Bilandic unveiled a broad $7.4 billion five-year public works plan to reshape much of the city. These plans included the construction a new State of Illinois office building on the site occupied by shuttered Sherman House Hotel. This would ultimately be realized with the construction of the James R. Thompson Center.

=== 1979 Democratic primary loss ===
Bilandic sought re-election in 1979, and was challenged in the Democratic primary by the former longtime city consumer affairs department head Jane Byrne, who Bilandic had fired in 1977. Bildanic&#x27;s candidacy was dragged down by dissatisfaction with the city&#x27;s handling of the recent snowstorm, as well as other issues. Many Republicans crossover voted in the Democratic primary against Bilandic in hopes of delivering a defeat to the Democratic machine that had dominated Chicago politics for decades. Byrne&#x27;s challenge was also boosted by the endorsement of Reverend Jesse Jackson. Additionally, many North Side and Northwest Side voters supported Byrne against Bildanic because they were angered by the Cook County Democratic leadership&#x27;s slating of only South Side and Southwest Side candidates for the citywide offices (mayor, clerk, and treasurer) in its endorsements ahead of the primary. Bilandic very narrowly lost the primary, winning 49% to Byrne&#x27;s 51%. Byrne went on to win the general election with a record-setting 82% of the vote, becoming Chicago&#x27;s first female mayor.

==Judicial career==
Following his term as mayor, Bilandic was elected to the Illinois Appellate Court in 1984, and then the Illinois Supreme Court in 1990, where Bilandic served until 2000. From 1994 until 1996, Bilandic served as the Illinois chief justice. 

== Personal life and death ==
On June 1, 1977, Bilandic married Chicago socialite Heather Morgan in a ceremony officiated by Chicago&#x27;s Archbishop John Cardinal Cody. Bilandic and Morgan had a son, Michael M. Bilandic Jr., born in 1978.

On January 15, 2002, Bilandic died from heart failure and was interred in St. Mary&#x27;s Cemetery in Evergreen Park, Illinois.

<doc id="984962" wikidata="Q497044" url="?curid=984962" title="Buenos Aires Underground">
<text>The Buenos Aires Underground (), locally known as Subte (), is a rapid transit system that serves the area of the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The first section of this network (Plaza de Mayo–Plaza Miserere) opened in 1913, making it the 13th earliest subway network in the world and the first underground railway in Latin America, the Southern Hemisphere, and the Spanish-speaking world, with the Madrid Metro opening nearly six years later, in 1919. As of 2023, Buenos Aires is the only Argentine city with a metro system.

Currently, the underground network&#x27;s six lines—A, B, C, D, E, and H—comprise of routes that serve 90 stations. The network is complemented by the Premetro line, and the Urquiza suburban line, with 17 more stations in total. Traffic on lines moves on the left because Argentina drove on the left at the time the system opened. Over a million passengers use the network, which also provides connections with the city&#x27;s extensive commuter rail and bus rapid transport networks.

The network expanded rapidly during the early decades of the 20th century; by 1944, its main routes were completed, with the addition of its newest line occurring as late as 2007. The pace of expansion fell sharply after the Second World War. In the late 1990s, expansion resumed at a quicker pace, and four new lines were planned for the network. Despite this, the network&#x27;s expansion has been largely exceeded by the transportation needs of the city and is said to be overcrowded. As of 2015, two modernisation plans have been presented: City of Buenos Aires law 670, proposing the creation of 3 new lines (F, G, and I), and the PETERS plan, wherein 2 lines are created and the I line is postponed for future expansion, plus several other route amendments. Since 2019, there are no expansions under construction, for the first time in half a century.

The entire network was nationalised in 1939, remaining in state hands and operation until the mid-1990s, when it entered into a concession model. The previously state-operated lines were offered as 20-year concessions to interested private parties; the two complementary lines were also included in this privatisation, and all were operated by Metrovías from 1995 to 2021, though the network and rolling stock remain the property of the City of Buenos Aires.

In December 2021, &quot;Emova Movilidad S.A.&quot; took over the concession of the Buenos Aires Underground for 12 years. Emova is also part of the Roggio Group, associated with former operator Metrovías.

==History==
The &quot;Subte&quot; opened in 1913, becoming the 13th underground system in the world, as well as the first in Latin America, the Southern Hemisphere and the Hispanophone world, followed by the Madrid Metro in 1919. The creation of the underground was part of a number of other urban transformations. A system of public water and sewage was first completed in 1886 and expanded in the subsequent decades, and many streets were paved as part of this same urban renewal. 

The underground network was originally built and operated by three separate private companies and later nationalised in 1939. In 1952 it was absorbed by a unified state administration, in 1963 it became the property of a newly founded company, which changed hands in 1979. The Subte then entered into a concession model in the mid-1990s through which private sector parties were to submit bids to execute investment plans &quot;designed and funded&quot; by the state, while implemented by the concessionaire. All the Underground lines, along with the Urquiza Line and Premetro were offered as 20-year concessions to interested private parties. By 1995, Metrovías took over the Subte under a $395 million plan.

===Early days===


Discussions on the need to build an underground transportation system in Buenos Aires began in the late nineteenth century, alongside the tramway system, which was one of the most extensive in the world at the time. The first trams appeared in 1870, and by about 1900 the system was in a crisis exacerbated by the monopolisation of the lines, which had concentrated under the ownership of fewer companies during the electrification of the system.

In this context, the first proposals for the building of an underground system were made, along with requests for government grants: first, in 1886, and several more in 1889. However, the Ministry of Interior (&quot;Ministerio del Interior&quot;, in Spanish) denied the city administration the power to license building in the city&#x27;s subsoil and for this reason, subsequent drafts were submitted directly to this ministry. In 1894, when it was decided to construct the Congress building in its present location, the underground idea was revived, since it would shorten the travel time between the Casa Rosada and the Congress. In 1896 Miguel Cané, former mayor of Buenos Aires (1892–1893), expressed the need to build an underground railway similar to the one in London

There were numerous proposals at the time to build an electric aerial tramway, with one such line to go down the Avenida de Mayo. One proposal was the 1889 &quot;Le Tellier&quot; proposal, which envisioned multiple lines running along the city&#x27;s wider avenues with the trams moved using cables and would hang from steel rails fixed to steel and iron posts positioned in intervals. The lines would take 24 months to build, and construction would commence 3 months after their approval by the Argentine National Congress, a decision which was ultimately not taken, favouring instead an underground tramway.

The first Underground line was opened on 1 December 1913 and was built by the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company (AATC), which had been given permission to build in 1909. That line was made up of one of the existing sections of Line A, linking the stations of Plaza de Mayo and Plaza Miserere. 170,000 passengers took part in the line&#x27;s first trip. On 1 April 1914 the line was to expand to Río de Janeiro station and on 1 July was extended to Primera Junta Station.

In 1912, the Lacroze Hermanos company won a concession to build another Underground line. The company was a competitor to the Anglo-Argentine company, operating tramways in Buenos Aires as well as the Buenos Aires Central Railway, which later became part of the Urquiza Line. Construction began in 1927, and this line became Line B when it was inaugurated on 17 October 1930. During 17–18 December, 380,000 passengers travelled on the line&#x27;s then 32 cars. The line was originally intended to continue above ground, with the current Federico Lacroze station to be the central terminal of the Buenos Aires Central Railway (today the General Urquiza Railway), however nowadays the overground service forms part of the Urquiza Line instead.

By the 1920s, the Argentine government was dissatisfied with the lack of progress the AATC (which enjoyed a near-monopoly on the city&#x27;s tramways by this point) had made in expanding the rest of the network and thus revoked its right to build any more lines in 1930, seeking instead another company to do so. By this point, the AATC had only built 48 metres of what is today Line C, a line which would link two of the city&#x27;s most important rail terminals (Constitución and Retiro) together. In 1933 a third company, the Hispano-Argentina Company of Public Works and Finances (&quot;Compañía Hispano–Argentina de Obras Públicas y Finanzas (CHADOPyF)&quot;, in Spanish) began construction of the other Underground lines. Line C&#x27;s first section, Constitución railway station-Diagonal Norte, was inaugurated on 9 November 1934 by Agustín P. Justo, then President of Argentina.

CHADOPyF opened Line D in 1937, from Catedral through Tribunales; with Line E following later in 1944, from Constitución to San Juan y Urquiza, later joining with Boedo station. By this point the advent of the Second World War had slowed expansion significantly, but the network was in length with each of the three companies – unusually for an underground network – continuing to run their respective lines, which were financed entirely with private capital, unlike the country&#x27;s railways which had been largely dependent on subsidies.

===Nationalisation===
The entire network was centralised and nationalised in 1939 under the management of the Transport Corporation of Buenos Aires (CTCBA) and the lines were given their current lettered naming scheme, from A to D in the order in which the lines were opened. In 1952, the CTCBA was absorbed by the Buenos Aires Transport General Administration (AGTBA), and in 1963, the administration was dissolved and the underground network became the property of the &quot;Subterráneos de Buenos Aires&quot; company (SBA).

In the early years of nationalisation, interchanges were provided between the lines previously belonging to the three different companies that built them (AATC, CHADOPyF and Lacroze) since previously only the CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) had formal connections between them. However, the rate of expansion of the network during this period had slowed considerably and only one station was opened during the 1970s.

Four different long-term expansion proposals were put forward between 1964 and 1991 which all proposed adding numerous lines to the network as well as extending the existing ones. Given the political instability characteristic of Argentina during this time, none of these proposals came to fruition, though aspects of them have been incorporated into contemporary expansion plans. One additional proposal put forward in 1973 saw the unification of the city&#x27;s commuter rail lines through tunnels and incorporated into the Buenos Aires Underground, and while this was also shelved, it was included in the Red de Expresos Regionales proposal.

During the 1960s and 70s, efforts were primarily concentrated on Line E, which was re-routed from its terminus at Constitución to the centre of the city at the Plaza de Mayo in an attempt to boost passenger figures, something which proved to be successful. The segment was opened by president Arturo Illia in 1966 and Spain offered CAF-General Eléctrica Española trains in order to cancel part of the debt it had accrued with Argentina; trains which continue to serve on the line today. The line was extended westward to José María Moreno in a project that began in 1969 and opened in 1973.

In 1979, SBA became &quot;Subterráneos de Buenos Aires Sociedad del Estado&quot; (SBASE) under Buenos Aires mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore of the National Reorganisation Process military junta. After a long period of stagnation, the Underground began to be expanded again with Lines B and E within the scope of these plans, though only the extension of Line E was commenced and completed before the transition to democracy where expansion was once again stalled. During this time, four Premetro feeder lines were planned leading out from the western termini of Lines D and E as well as one in Puerto Madero, however only Line E2 was completed in 1987 and these plans were scrapped in 1994 when operation of the Underground changed hands.

===Privatisation===
In 1994 the operation of the network was privatised, along with the country&#x27;s railways, and is now managed by Metrovías. SBASE (as part of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires) maintained ownership of the network, its rolling stock, and infrastructure, and administers its expansion and budget. One cosmetic change carried out in the 1990s under private operation was the re-assignation of the colours of the lines, with Lines B and D switching colours, Line C changing from purple to blue and Line E changing from yellow to purple. The change of colours was also accompanied by a standardisation of the network&#x27;s signage to match the new schemes.

In 2012, the role of Metrovías was lessened to simply operating the lines, while maintenance of infrastructure became the responsibility of SBASE. The relationship between Mauricio Macri&#x27;s mayoral administration and Metrovías became increasingly strained, with the Government of Buenos Aires issuing multiple fines to the operator. The relationship was further strained in 2013 when Metrovías&#x27; 20-year concession ended and has since been renewed on a year-by-year basis, leaving the door open for a state-run or mixed operation. Among the public, privatisation has proved unpopular, with a survey carried out in 2015 indicating that 82% of passengers would like the Underground to be operated by the state instead of a private company.

In more recent years, Line A and Line B have been extended westwards, adding a total of 4 stations to each line between 2003 and 2013. During the same period, Line H was opened 2007, making it the first completely new line on the underground since Line E, excluding the Premetro. There have also been significant modernisations of infrastructure, signalling systems, stations and the network&#x27;s rolling stock.

The current contract expired on 31 December 2019 with bids put forward by:
*Keolis in partnership with Transport for London and Eduardo Eurnekian&#x27;s Corporación América
*Metrovías in partnership with Deutsche Bahn
*RATP Group
==Network and services==

The network comprises six underground lines, labelled &quot;A&quot; to &quot;E&quot; and &quot;H&quot; and which are further identified by different colours, covering a total route length of and serving 90 stations. There is also one surface Premetro &quot;P&quot; line with an additional 17 stations. Daily ridership was approximately 1.11 million in 2015. With the current usage patterns, the entire system is overstretched, and during weekdays overcrowded and with insufficient services. An expansion programme is underway, and it is expected to enlarge the network to in the future. Similarly, new rolling stock has been incorporated across lines since 2013 to improve capacity and the last of the current orders are set to arrive in 2016 and followed by further orders of new rolling stock, which is expected to increase ridership figures to 1.8 million by 2019. 

Annual ridership in 2019: 321 296 964.Annual ridership in 2020: 73 650 077.

===Fares and operating times===
Prior to 2024, standard fares cost AR$125 per trip on the Subte, regardless of travelled distance. After 20 trips, the fare is discounted 20%; after 30 trips, 30%, and after 40 trips the fare is discounted 40%. The Premetro has a flat rate of AR$43.75. Fares have been increased multiple times due to devaluation of the Argentine Peso. While tokens have been used in the past, at present riders use contactless cards called SUBE, which are rechargeable with multiple forms of payment. Previously, single or multi-use paper cards with a magnetic strip (called Subtepass) were used, however, these were phased out of the system in May 2016, opting instead only to use the digital cards, with the exception of some retired, disabled and student cards. In 2024, fares were raised to AR$574, an increase of 360%, as part of austerity policies introduced by President Javier Milei.

Trains run from 05:00 until 23:00, every 3–4 minutes, for all lines except Line H which has a frequency of around 6 minutes. Under modernisation plans commenced in 2013, service frequencies increased to an average of one train every 2 minutes 20 seconds by 2019.

Trains originally ran until 01:00 am, but following the privatisation of the service through concession to Metrovías, the company established an earlier closing time of 23:00 in 1994 to carry out works on the lines. This change was only meant to be temporary, but was never reverted even after the works were completed. There have been numerous petitions as well as a campaign by the City Ombudsman to extend services to 1:30 am on weekdays and 3:00 am on Fridays and Saturdays. These proposals have been rejected by Subterráneos de Buenos Aires, which stated in 2015 that the reduced schedule is needed in order to carry out infrastructure modernisation works across all the lines while they are closed.

The Subte operations are radio-controlled and monitored remotely from the Metrovías Central Operations Post (PCO in Spanish). There 24 operators have been monitoring four of the six subway lines (lines C and H have separate monitoring) since 2001. As of 2015, last formations arrive at their respective terminals at approximately 11:30 pm, where maintenance and cleaning operations take place until about 4:00 am.

=== Premetro===
The PreMetro line E2 is a tramway feeding Line E. The Premetro line opened in 1987. It carries approximately 2,300 passengers daily and is also run by Metrovías. In 2015, SBASE began making plans to refurbish and rebuild many of the stations, including a brand-new central terminal, as part of a plan to modernise the network, with the intent of increasing the amount of rolling stock in circulation. By the end of 2015, the Intendente Saguier terminal had been refurbished, though other works on the line were delayed.

The Premetro was originally intended to include a number of feeder lines to the Underground network, including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina&#x27;s transition to democracy from the military junta and then the privatisation of the railways, which was a difficult time economically for the country, and only Line E2 was built. New Premetro feeder lines have been proposed in recent years, however, the role of the network has given way to the new Metrobus network which covers many of the same routes originally intended for the Premetro.

=== Urquiza Line ===
Línea Urquiza (in English: Urquiza Line) is a suburban electric commuter rail line originally designed to be part of the Underground system as part of Line B and operated by the Underground operator Metrovías. As a result, it has similar characteristics to Line B, using third rail electrification and standard gauge as opposed to the broad gauge used in the Buenos Aires commuter rail network. It runs from the Federico Lacroze terminus in the &quot;barrio&quot; of Chacarita, to General Lemos terminus, Campo de Mayo in Greater Buenos Aires. The line is completely at grade (ground-level) and uses third rail current collection. It operates 20 hours a day, 7 days a week at 8-to-30-minute intervals. The Urquiza Line transported 15 million passengers in 2013.

Originally the line was planned to run into the centre of Buenos Aires through a long tunnel. But when the tunnel was finally built in 1930, it ended up as Line B. The access ramp still exists and is in use today, but for maintenance and storage purposes rather than for passenger services. The Urquiza Line itself opened in 1948, so suburban passengers travelling on the Underground&#x27;s Line B have to transfer to the Urquiza Line at Federico Lacroze station, named after its builder, about from the city centre.

== Stations and connections ==

&quot;Stations are listed from East to West or North to South. Stations in gray have yet to open. Stations in bold are the current termini. Small interchange icons indicate interchanges under construction&quot;

===Ghost stations===

There are four ghost stations on the Buenos Aires Underground, two on Line A and two on Line E. The Line A stations – Pasco Sur and Alberti Norte – were closed in 1953 since stations in that part of the line were grouped very closely together and having fewer stops improved the line&#x27;s frequency. Pasco Sur remains in very good condition, while Alberti Norte was converted into an electrical substation.

The Line E stations were closed in 1966, after the line was re-routed from Constitución railway station (where it connected with Line C) closer to the centre of the city, leaving the San José vieja and Constitución stations out of the network, a move which tripled traffic on the line. The two stations have subsequently been used as workshops and storage areas.

At one point it was considered that the two former Line E stations and tunnels should be used for Line F since the line&#x27;s southern terminus would be there and that part of the route would be roughly similar to the old Line E. However, it was eventually decided that the line should use new tunnels in that section due to its sharp curves.

== Expansion plans ==
There have been several plans to expand the Underground system. The Underground&#x27;s routes are said to spread out like &quot;branches of a tree&quot; from the Plaza de Mayo, something Miguel Delibes described as &quot;restrictive&quot;. Current expansion efforts seek to not necessarily go through Plaza de Mayo by creating more north–south lines and moving termini away from the city centre. An expansion plan was approved in the year 2000 under Law 670 and has seen the creation of Line H, as well as the extensions of Line A and Line B westwards. In 2015, an alternative plan has been proposed which would make numerous amendments to the Law 670 plan. As of 2024, no new stations have been added to the network since 2019, and both the 2000 and 2015 expansion plans remain incomplete.

=== Expansions in the 2010s ===

 Line H&#x27;s extensions to the north from Corrientes to Plaza Francia, serving intermediate stations at Córdoba, Santa Fe and Las Heras, and south from Hospitales with stations at Nueva Pompeya and Sáenz, were initiated with ground-breaking ceremonies on 17 January 2012. Since then, following concerns that the construction of Plaza Francia station would damage the natural beauty of the area surrounding the Recoleta Cemetery, the station was relocated to Facultad de Derecho next to the University of Buenos Aires&#x27;s faculty of law, with the change delaying the opening of the station until 2018. Cordoba and Las Heras were opened in December 2015, while Santa Fe opened in mid-2016, providing the line with a connection to Line D. The 20 new Alstom trains to serve the expected increase in passenger numbers as a result of the connection with Line D began arriving in the country in 2015.

=== Planned lines ===

The future expansion outlined in Law 670 would see the addition of three new lines. These lines&#x27; routes have already been approved by the Legislature of the City in Law 670. 39.3 km will be added to the network, expanding it to about 97 km in total length and providing several stations with various interchanges. This will also create new north–south routes, resulting in an appropriate network to avoid the city centre. If built, the new lines would mean that more than two million inhabitants of Buenos Aires (accounting for about 70% of the city centre&#x27;s population) will live within 400 metres of a metro station. The new lines will run between 56 new stations.

 Line F will run from Barracas to Plaza Italia in Palermo and will include 16 new stations. The planned route length of this line is 10.8 km. Construction was due to begin in 2020, once the northern extension of Line H is complete, and as originally planned, the line would have automatic trains and platform screen doors.

 Line G will connect Retiro and Caballito/Villa Crespo; 12.5 km long with 15 new stations. Originally, construction was due to start in 2012–2013, however city legislators opposed the turnkey construction proposed by Chinese firms since the total cost would have been 30% higher than if it was done with local companies. After this, it was decided to prioritise the other construction projects in the network.

 Line I will run Parque Chacabuco to Ciudad Universitaria with 18 new stations. The route length is 12.6 km. The future of this line (which had the lowest priority in the expansion plans) is currently uncertain since it has been proposed that a Metrobus line be built instead, which would follow the same trajectory as the line.

===PETERS plan===

In October 2015, the city of Buenos Aires together with the Inter-American Development Bank presented a 150-page plan for the Underground called the Strategic and Technical Plan for the Expansion of the Subterranean Network (&quot;Plan Estratégico y Técnico para la Expansión de la Red de Subtes&quot;, or PETERS), highlighting past expansion efforts and the need to adapt plans to the current needs of the city. In this version of the Underground, Line I is cancelled while Line G takes a different route through the centre of the city terminating at Constitucion railway station after going through the neighbourhood of San Telmo, rather than through Retiro railway station. Other changes include a &quot;Retiro Norte&quot; node where lines F and H terminate, rather than at Plaza Italia and Retiro respectively, while Line E is extended to Plaza Italia from Retiro – a segment which in the original plan was part of Line F. In these plans, Line C is extended both northwards in a loop to Retiro bus station and southwards to the Buenos Aires Belgrano Sur Line railway station minor terminal.

Such plans are subject to approval by the Buenos Aires City Legislature and would mean the annulment of many of the existing expansion plans outlined in Law 670. Some criticisms include the failure of the PETERS plan to account for the extension of the Belgrano Sur Line to Constitucion railway station, meaning that Line C&#x27;s extension to the minor Buenos Aires terminal would be redundant, and that the Retiro Norte node would also be made redundant by the planned Red de Expresos Regionales commuter rail tunnels which are to link the three major railway terminals of the city.

==Modernisation of existing lines==

Much of the modernisation in recent years has centred around the Underground&#x27;s rolling stock, with large scale renewals and refurbishments of existing fleets, in particular on Lines A and H. Along with this came the construction of new underground workshops and storage areas on lines A, H and E, as well as the expansion of the existing facilities on Lines B and D.

In September 2015, the president of SBASE highlighted plans for the 2015–2019 period for the Underground at a conference with other South American mass transit operators in Brazil. One of the largest changes to be made during this period was the upgrading of signalling systems on all lines, with the exception of Line E. Lines A and B were to receive Automatic Train Operation systems, replacing their ATS and ATP systems respectively, whilst lines C, D and H were to receive Communications Based Train Control systems. The implementation of these systems was already under way on Lines C and H as of September 2015, and was due to be completed on other lines before 2019. Line D was also to receive platform screen doors along with the CBTC system.

Other works to be carried out during this period include the improvement of disabled access in older stations, new ventilation systems on lines B, C and D, improvements in electrification (such as replacing overhead lines and substations) on lines A, B, C and D and the replacement of 14 km of track on Lines C and E. The total investment in this period for these new projects was set at US$1.34 billion.

===Stations===

Starting in 2007, the network&#x27;s stations began to receive technological updates ranging from Wi-Fi to interactive terminals. Through &quot;BA-WIFI&quot; (the citywide free internet service), passengers can use internet free of charge across all stations and aboard trains, though this has been delayed on Line A due to complications surrounding the line&#x27;s age. There are also several &quot;digital spaces&quot; across the network and in its commercial galleries where seating areas are provided, along with recharging stations for mobile devices.

There has also been widespread cosmetic changes to stations, including the restoration of historical murals, the incorporation of new artwork and improving the lighting. The renovations on Line B have been met with criticism for destroying parts of the line&#x27;s historic heritage, which dates back to the 1930s. The appearance of the network&#x27;s signs has also been changed and the new signs have been gradually replacing the old ones since November 2014.

==Rolling stock==
The Buenos Aires Underground has had among the longest serving and most varied rolling stock in the world, in part due to the network having been originally built and operated by three different companies in its early years, causing incompatibilities between the lines. The network began with uniform rolling stock, with the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company Anglo-Argentine Line A using La Brugeoise cars (with the exception of a few UEC Preston cars), the three CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) using Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein &amp; Koppel stock and Lacroze&#x27;s Line B using Metro-Cammell cars. However, as the lines were expanded and passenger numbers increased, more rolling stock was needed, which made the network less uniform, particularly with regard to the problematic Line B, which used a different electrification system and measurements from the other lines. Line B also became the first line of the network to receive second-hand rolling stock in 1995.

===2010s fleet upgrades===
Since then there have been moves towards greater modernisation and standardisation, with large purchases of new rolling stock from companies such as Alstom and China CNR Corporation, as well as smaller orders of second hand rolling stock, which the government of the City of Buenos Aires claims are temporary measures while those lines are modernised to be able to incorporate more modern rolling stock. Such stock has been acquired from Tokyo, Nagoya, and Madrid. From 2013 to 2019, 468 new cars arrived while 232 received refurbishment, bringing the average age of the fleet to 22 years in 2016, down from 34 in 2014.

The network&#x27;s oldest cars – the La Brugeoise cars – were retired in 2013, while its historically most widely used cars – the Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein &amp; Koppel cars – were to be retired in 2015, though this was pushed back to June 2016 following delays on the opening of Santa Fe station on Line H. While there has been much movement of rolling stock, often in a &quot;hand-me-down&quot; manner from higher frequency lines to less used lines (the primary recipient being Line E), the transition to newer models has gone fairly smoothly, despite shortfalls in some lines following extensions. The Fiat-Materfer cars have been the primary stand-ins while the new trains arrive, though this role has also been filled by the Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein &amp; Koppel cars, delaying their retirement.

Though Line A ran on a different voltage to the rest of the network, it was converted to the 1500 V used on the rest of the network when the 200 Series trains began to arrive. On the other hand, Line B has traditionally been the most troublesome of the network given its different voltage and the fact that it uses third rail electrification as opposed to the overhead lines used on the rest of the network, making it in effect a separate entity not capable of sharing its stock with other lines. Presently this line uses 1950s rolling stock acquired from Tokyo&#x27;s Eidan 300/400/500/900 series Marunouchi Line, along with CAF 5000 and CAF 6000 stock acquired from Madrid which are to replace the aging Eidan stock. The line, along with its remaining third rail stock, is being converted to overhead lines at 1500 V, after which the entire network will be standardised.

==Culture and heritage==

The Buenos Aires Underground has historically been characterised by murals and other artistic works in its stations, making it a kind of museum throughout the system. These works, and a number of complete stations, are considered part of the cultural heritage of the city and several of them were declared National Historic Landmarks in 1997.

===National patrimony===
Line A is renowned for having kept its original 1913 rolling stock running on the line up until 2013, making them the oldest underground carriages in commercial service in the world at the time. They were built by La Brugeoise, et Nicaise et Delcuve, a Belgian rolling stock manufacturer established in the city of Bruges, between 1913 and 1919. Entirely made of wood, they were originally designed to run as underground as well as tramway cars, but they were adapted in 1927 to their current style for underground service only.

In March 2013, La Brugeoise subway carriages were replaced by new Chinese 200 Series rolling stock, just 11 months prior to their 100th anniversary on the line. The original rolling stock has since been maintained, some in exhibition and some being converted to 1500 V to run tourist services on the line. During the festivities of the 100th anniversary of the underground on 1 December 2013, many restored La Brugeoise trains circulated Line A and there was a symphonic orchestra at Plaza de Mayo station as well as free rides for the entire city in order to mark the event. Throughout the week that followed, there were also numerous displays and events across the different lines of the Underground. As of 2017, there were plans to preserve and run some of the cars a few times each year for special events.

Currently, the Polvorín Workshop – originally inaugurated along with Line A – is being transformed into a museum to display artefacts and the former rolling stock of the Underground. The workshop also serves as the headquarters for the Association of Friends of the Tramway and many of the Underground&#x27;s historical artefacts are stored there, such as the wooden UEC Preston &quot;palace cars&quot;, which also make appearances on Line A during special occasions such as anniversaries and even the inauguration of president Raúl Alfonsín in 1983, where he and other officials were transported from the National Congress to the Casa Rosada using these cars.

=== Artwork and exhibits ===

The network has over 390 artworks by over 170 artists across its stations, ranging from historic murals to modern art. Styles also vary, from mosaic to fileteado, sculpture and installation pieces. Many stations are decorated with intricate ceramic tile work, some of which date back to 1913 when the Underground first opened its doors. Featured artists include painters and reproductions by Quino, Molina Campos, Raúl Soldi, Rodolfo Medina and Jorge Schwarz. In addition, they provide spaces for music and theatre events, including an underground iteration of the Pepsi Music Festival on Line H.

====Line A====
The oldest line on the network has maintained its original appearance from 1913 and 1914 on the Plaza de Mayo – Primera Junta segment following restoration works in 1988 for the 75th anniversary of the line and again in 2007. These older stations feature no advertisements, but instead have recreations of original advertisements from the early 20th century. The Line&#x27;s newest segment, which runs from Puán to San Pedrito, displays more modern artworks, such as those by Uruguayan artist Guillermo Roux at San José de Flores station.

====Line B====
In Tronador – Villa Ortúzar station there are 18 stained glasses that refer to the history of the Villa Ortúzar neighbourhood, where the station is located. In Los Incas – Parque Chas station there are murals related with different Pre-Columbian era civilisations are exhibited. In 2015, SBASE faced criticism for its incorporation of new artworks in multiple stations on the line. Many of these artworks were painted directly over tiles dating back to the 1930s when the line was opened by the Lacroze company, while others were completely removed and destroyed.

====Line C====
From Constitución to Diagonal Norte, the line features murals of Iberian landscapes created by Spanish artists such as Ignacio Zuloaga and Fernando Álvarez de Sotomayor y Zaragoza, which date back to the time of the line&#x27;s opening by CHADOPyF. General San Martín station includes photographic reproductions of the Museo de la Ciudad (City Museum) activities, photographic reproductions and images of the Plaza San Martín and photographic reproductions of streets and building of the South zone of the city.

====Line D====
The line&#x27;s murals on its original Catedral – Palermo route date back to 1937 and 1940, and began to be restored in 2013. These include murals by Argentine artists Benito Quinquela Martín in Plaza Italia station. There are also numerous showcase exhibits in its newer stations, with a series of ceramic reproductions by Raúl and Daniel De Francisco in Juramento station, ceramic reproductions of four murals made by Raúl Soldi in José Hernández station and showcases exposing works made in the Ceramic School No.1 in Olleros station Congreso de Tucumán station was the network&#x27;s first &quot;museum station&quot; and holds numerous exhibits, among them busts of key political and cultural figures in Argentine culture and history such as Jorge Luis Borges and Manuel Belgrano displayed in glass enclosures in its platform walls.

====Line E====

Some modern murals on the line include an homage to the 1996 Argentine film &quot;Moebius&quot; at San José station. The film used the line for its primary filming locations and the murals depict scenes from it. Recently opened Correo Central station has received an award from the Association of Structural Engineers in Argentina for the quality and creativity of the work.

====Line H====
The newest line on the Underground has many Hermenegildo Sábat mural reproductions related to tango in all stations. Its numerous stations depict different tango singers and poets relating to the neighbourhoods in which they are situated. Santa Fe station was renamed to Santa Fe - Carlos Jáuregui in 2017, in honour of LGBT rights activist Carlos Jáuregui.

===Graffiti===
Graffiti on the Buenos Aires Underground became particularly prevalent in the late 2000s and early 2010s, and by 2013, four out of every five cars on the network had some degree of graffiti. By January 2015, all the painted cars had been cleaned by night-time cleaning teams using a product specially developed for SBASE that allowed the removal of graffiti without damaging the livery of the cars. Cleaning the 410 vandalised cars had cost the City of Buenos Aires AR$ 10.25 million pesos, while a coat of anti-graffiti paint has been applied to the cars to make future cleaning easier using alcohol.

SBASE, along with the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police, has adopted a zero tolerance policy on graffiti in the Buenos Aires Underground, imposing fines ranging from AR$400–6000 and up to 30 days community service, the culprits often being made to clean the cars they vandalised. Increased vigilance from over 500 police officers, as well as close to 300 CCTV cameras, have aided in decreasing new acts of vandalism by 85% in 2014, with a further decrease of 50% in 2015 after security was intensified.

Painted cars were often worked on by organised groups in a &quot;whole car&quot; (graffiti jargon for covering the entire visible surface of the vehicle) manner, severely reducing visibility from inside the cars. Numerous arrests have been made on these groups which often consist of foreign nationals from countries such as Chile, Germany and France; two German nationals and a Chilean national were arrested in January 2016. One high-profile arrest of such a group saw four Argentines detained in 2015 after vandalising a 200 Series train on Line A. Their houses were subsequently raided, uncovering a vast collection of stolen Subte paraphernalia as well as documented evidence of their activities in the form of videos and photographs.

According to &quot;Clarín&quot;, people from across the world have visited Buenos Aires with the sole purpose of &quot;bombing&quot; (painting cars in a clandestine manner), while competition among different groups exists in the form of greater points being earned for painting newer cars or the level of danger experienced. In most cases, the people involved are university educated and with stable employment. In January 2016, a group called &quot;Soketes Calcetines&quot; was discovered to be offering tourists graffiti tours of the Underground, giving them a chance to paint cars for a fee. The group documented their activities and uploaded them to YouTube in order to promote the business, which has been subsequently shut down with its members arrested.

===In popular culture===
The Buenos Aires Underground is featured in the 1996 science-fiction film &quot;Moebius&quot;, directed by Gustavo Mosquera. In the film, the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of an underground train are investigated by a topologist. The film is based on the short story &quot;A Subway Named Mobius&quot;, which takes place in the Boston Subway.

Other films with scenes shot in the Underground include &quot;Highlander II: The Quickening&quot;, &quot;Focus&quot; and &quot;The Official Story&quot;.

In Ricardo Piglia&#x27;s 1997 novel &quot;Plata Quemada&quot;, the bank robber protagonists enjoy riding the underground regularly. In Ernesto Sabato&#x27;s novel &quot;On Heroes and Tombs&quot;, Fernando, one of its main characters, develops a paranoia with blind people in the underground.

One of Jorge Luis Borges&#x27; earlier editorial jobs was for &quot;Urbe&quot;, a promotional magazine for the underground system, which was privately owned at that time. In the magazine, he wrote several articles on sci-fi topics under various pseudonyms.

Line B and some of its stations feature heavily in the 2013 Argentine point-and-click adventure game &quot;Reversion: The Meeting&quot;.

&quot;El Eternauta&quot; is a science fiction comic book created by Héctor Germán Oesterheld and Francisco Solano López in 1957. The story is about an alien invasion in Buenos Aires. Part of the action takes place at the Plaza Italia station, as the heroes try to use the tunnel to escape from the aliens, and successfully exploit the weakness of the alien leader to kill him. The comic book, published in the 1950s, made reference to the &quot;Canning&quot; station, a former name of the Scalabrini Ortiz station.

<text>The Disability Rights Commission (DRC) was established by the British Labour government in 1999. At that time, the DRC was the UK&#x27;s third equality commission alongside the Commission for Racial Equality and the Equal Opportunities Commission. Its chairman from 2000 to 2007 was Bert Massie.

The DRC was charged with reviewing the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and recommending its amendment. It had rights of investigation and enforcement of disability legislation, and was responsible for advising employers on how to secure equal acceptance of disabled employees in the workplace. The DRC replaced an earlier and weaker body, the National Disability Council, established by the Conservatives in the 1990s.

The passing of the Equality Act 2006 means that in October 2007, the DRC was replaced by a new Equality and Human Rights Commission with powers across all equality law (race, sex, disability, religion and belief, sexual orientation and age).

The DRC was a non-departmental public body (NDPB) of the Department for Work and Pensions. Its head office was in Manchester city centre with other offices in central London, Cardiff and Edinburgh.

<doc id="984982" wikidata="Q6707527" url="?curid=984982" title="Lyda Roberti">
<text>Lyda Roberti (née Pecjak; May 20, 1906 – March 13, 1938) was an American singer and stage and film actress. (According to the opening credits of &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1936,&quot; Lyda is pronounced LEE-duh.)

==Early years==
Born in Warsaw, then part of Imperial Russia, Lyda Roberti was the daughter of a German father (a professional clown surnamed Pecjak) and a Polish mother. As a child she performed in the circus as a trapeze artist and bareback rider. She had an elder brother, Robert, also born in Poland, and a younger sister, Manya. 

To escape the upheaval in Russia after the Communist revolution in 1917, the Pecjak family settled in Shanghai, China, where Lyda earned money as a dancer in the Carlton café. Eventually, she saved enough money to pay her passage to the United States, where she performed in vaudeville in both San Francisco and Los Angeles.

== Career ==
Roberti made her Broadway debut in &quot;You Said It&quot; in 1931 and, with its success, became an overnight sensation. During her run with the show, she was nicknamed &quot;Broadway&#x27;s preferred Polish blonde&quot;. Historian Edward Jablonski found that &quot;much of her appeal to the audiences at the time was due to her Polish accent&quot; and cited instances when her pronunciation of certain consonants would &quot;stir audiences to gales of laughter.&quot; 

In 1932, she was signed to Paramount Pictures, where she appeared in Edward F. Cline&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Million Dollar Legs&quot; (1932) as &quot;Mata Machree, The Woman No Man Can Resist&quot;, a Mata Hari-type spy hired to undermine the President of Klopstokia (played by W.C. Fields) in his efforts to secure money for his destitute country. 

In 1933, she performed in two more Broadway musicals: the short-lived &quot;Pardon My English&quot; and the much more successful &quot;Roberta&quot;. Throughout the 1930s, she played in a string of films. Her sexy but playful characterizations, along with the accent she had acquired during her years in Europe and Asia, made her popular with audiences. In 1936, Roberti replaced Thelma Todd in several films after Todd&#x27;s death.

==Personal life==
On June 25, 1935, Roberti married aviator Bud Ernst in Yuma, Arizona. They separated one year later but secretly reconciled in January 1937 and remained together until her death.

Roberti struggled with health issues for most of her life, mainly related to her heart. In the spring of 1935, she underwent surgery for heart and appendix issues. In 1936, she was forced to withdraw from &quot;Wives Never Know&quot; owing to an unnamed illness. A series of heart attacks forced her to curtail her workload in 1937.

==Death==
On the night of March 13, 1938, Roberti suffered another severe heart attack. Dr. Myron Babcock unsuccessfully administered heart stimulants, and Roberti died at age 31 with husband Ernst at her bedside. Her funeral two days later drew 400 people, including many of her Hollywood colleagues.

According to her friend and co-star Patsy Kelly, Roberti died from a heart attack while bending to tie her shoelace. In an interview with Leonard Maltin for &quot;Film Fan Monthly&quot;, Kelly said, &quot;As a child, her father was in the circus, and he used to throw her on bareback, and we never knew it had affected her heart, and one day – boom!&quot;

Roberti is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

<doc id="984992" wikidata="Q335304" url="?curid=984992" title="Mahākāśyapa">
<text>Mahākāśyapa () was one of the principal disciples of Gautama Buddha. He is regarded in Buddhism as an enlightened disciple, being foremost in ascetic practice. Mahākāśyapa assumed leadership of the monastic community following the &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the First Buddhist Council. He was considered to be the first patriarch in a number of Early Buddhist schools and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the Chan/Zen tradition. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a &quot;guarantor of future justice&quot; in the time of Maitreya, the future Buddhahe has been described as &quot;both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast&quot;.

In canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mahākāśyapa was born as Pippali in a village and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named Bhadra-Kapilānī. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was ordained as a monk, named &quot;Kāśyapa&quot;, but later called &quot;Mahākāśyapa&quot; to distinguish him from other disciples. Mahākāśyapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his robe with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the Buddhist teaching. He became foremost in ascetic practices and attained enlightenment shortly after. He often had disputes with Ānanda, the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing Ānanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.

Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward Ānanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mahākāśyapa stood for, emphasizing monastic discipline and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of Ānanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mahākāśyapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha&#x27;s &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot;, to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a lineage of patriarchs of Buddhism.

In many post-canonical texts, Mahākāśyapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of meditation and suspended animation, which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called Kukkuṭapāda, until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several cults and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mahākāśyapa and Gautama Buddha&#x27;s robe, which covered Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mahākāśyapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mahākāśyapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.

== In early Buddhist texts ==
In the Early Buddhist Texts of several textual traditions, a dozen discourses attributed to Mahākāśyapa have been compiled in a distinct section within several collections of texts. In the Pāli tradition, this is part of the collection called the &quot;Saṃyutta Nikāya&quot;, and in Chinese Buddhist texts, the collection is called the &quot;Saṃyukta Āgama&quot;. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mahākāśyapa, numbered Taishō 2:99 and 2:100. The Chinese &quot;Ekottara Āgama&quot; also contains a passage that runs parallel to the Pāli &quot;Saṃyutta&quot;, T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mahākāśyapa, and another passage about him and the monk Bakkula. Finally, there are also Vinaya texts from the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition about Mahākāśyapa in the Tibetan language.

=== Early life ===

Pāli accounts relate that Mahākāśyapa was born Pippali in a &quot;brahmana&quot; family in a village called Mahātittha, in the kingdom of Magadha, present-day India. His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Sumanādevī. His body had some of the thirty-two characteristics of a Great Man (; ), which in Buddhism are seen as the characteristics of a future Buddha. From his youth onward, he was inclined toward living a spiritual life rather than marrying, but his father wanted him to wed. To send his father on a wild goose chase, he agreed to marry but then produced a perfect golden statue of a woman, and asked his father to find him a woman that matched the statue. Four copies of the image were taken throughout the country to find the right woman. A &quot;brahmin&quot; from Kapila had a daughter called Bhadra-Kapilānī (), who had no interest in a family life either. However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family. When she approached the image, however, people noticed that the image appeared ugly compared to her. Her reputation of beauty spread, and soon after Pippali&#x27;s family learned about her, she was offered in marriage to Pippali.

Next, in the Pāli version of the story, the two exchanged letters to indicate their lack of interest, only to find their letters intercepted by their parents and being forced to marry anyway. In the Mūlasarvāstivāda version of the story, however, Pippali went to visit Bhadra, and without revealing his identity, told her that her future husband would be a bad choice for her, because he had no interest in sensual pleasures. She replied she also did not care for such matters, whereupon he revealed that he was her future husband. Both versions relate that the two agreed to marry and to live celibately, to the chagrin of Pippali&#x27;s parents.

Pippali is depicted in the Pāli version as very wealthy, using much perfume and possessing much land and chariots. Later, in the Pāli version, Pippali and Bhadra saw animals eating each other on the fertile fields as they were plowed by their workers. The sight brought pity and fear to them, and they determined to live mendicant lives instead, and leave the agricultural business behind. In the Mūlasarvāstivāda version, it was the pitiful sight of the workers instead which brought Pippali to leave his lay life. The two went their separate ways, as not to grow any attachment to each other, and to prevent gossip and disrepute.

=== Meeting the Buddha ===
Shortly after that, Pippali met the Buddha, was struck with devotion when seeing him, and asked to be ordained under him. Thenceforth, he was called &quot;Kāśyapa&quot;. As he ordained him, the Buddha gave three directives to practice: Kāśyapa should develop a &quot;lively sense of fear and regard&quot; towards his fellow monastics, regardless of their status; Kāśyapa should attentively listen and practice the teachings of the Buddha (; ); and he should live in mindfulness.
When the two met, (or in some versions, some time later) Mahākāśyapa exchanged his fine and expensive robe with that of the Buddha, a robe made of rags. The exchange came to be seen as a gesture of great respect the Buddha had made. It was unprecedented, and a sign that Mahākāśyapa would preside over the First Council after the Buddha&#x27;s demise. Texts from different traditions suggest that only a person with the great merit as Mahākāśyapa would be able to wear the robe. The only reason the robe was highly valuable was that it had been worn by the Buddha. In itself it was not valuable, because it came from the lowest source, that is, a female slave&#x27;s corpse discarded in a charnel ground. This also echoed an earlier exchange that took place after the Buddha&#x27;s Great Renunciation, when he swapped his lay robes with a hunter in the forest. Finally, the fact that it was a rag-robe contributed to the ascetic identity of the figure of Mahākaśyapa.

Throughout cultures, &quot;inalienable possessions&quot;, often textiles, were symbols of authority and continuity in a family. Gautama Buddha giving his robe to Mahākāśyapa in the latter&#x27;s early monastic years demonstrated a deep sense of respect for this disciple. Mahākāśyapa was seen to safeguard this robe to pass on to the future Buddha. Thus, the robe came to represent a passing on of the transmission of Buddhist teachings, and Mahākāśyapa became a symbol of the continuity of the Buddha&#x27;s dispensation. In this context, the rag-robe was also associated in several Asian cultures with gestation, birth, rebirth, impermanence and death.

=== Monastic life ===
The Buddha exhorted Mahākāśyapa that he should practice himself &quot;for the welfare and happiness of the multitude&quot; and impressed upon him that he should take upon himself ascetic practices (, ). Accordingly, Mahākāśyapa took upon him the thirteen ascetic practices (including living in the wilderness, living only from alms and wearing rag-robes) and became an enlightened disciple (&quot;arahat&quot;) in nine days. He was then called &#x27;Kāśyapa the Great&#x27; (), because of his good qualities, and to distinguish him from other monks with the same name.

Mahākāśyapa was one of the most revered of the Buddha&#x27;s disciples, the renunciant par excellence. He was praised by the Buddha as foremost in ascetic practices () and a foremost forest dweller. He excelled in supernatural accomplishments (; ) and was equal to the Buddha in meditative absorption (; ). He is depicted as a monk with great capacity to tolerate discomfort and contentment with the bare necessities of life. In one discourse found in the Pāli and Chinese collections, the Buddha advised Mahākāśyapa that having grown old, he should give up ascetic practices and live close to the Buddha. Mahākāśyapa declined, however. When the Buddha asked him to explain, Mahākāśyapa said he found the practices of benefit to himself. He also argued he could be an example for incoming generations of practitioners. The Buddha agreed with him, and affirmed the benefits of ascetic practices, which he had himself praised for a long time. A second discourse found in the Pāli and two Chinese collections has Mahākāśyapa meet the Buddha as he was wearing simple rag-robes and, according to the Chinese versions, his hair and beard long. Other monks criticized Mahākāśyapa for not looking appropriate when meeting his master. The Buddha responded by praising Mahākāśyapa, however. In the Chinese versions, the Buddha even went so far as to allow Mahākāśyapa to share his seat, but Mahākāśyapa politely declined. When Mahākāśyapa fell ill once, the Buddha went to visit him and reminded him of his efforts in practicing the Buddhist teaching.

=== Relation with Ānanda ===

Mahākāśyapa and Ānanda were fellow disciples of the Buddha. Ānanda was the Buddha&#x27;s close attendant. Mahākāśyapa is often depicted in the early texts as acting critically toward Ānanda. For example, one time Mahākāśyapa chastised Ānanda in strong words, criticizing the fact that Ānanda was travelling with a large following of young monks who appeared untrained and who had built up a bad reputation. According to the early texts, Ānanda&#x27;s role in founding the &quot;bhikṣunī&quot; (nun) order made him popular with the &quot;bhikṣunīs&quot;. Ānanda often taught them, often encouraged women to ordain, and when he was criticized by Mahākāśyapa, several &quot;bhikṣunīs&quot; tried to defend him. Another time, shortly after the passing away of the Buddha, Mahākāśyapa gave a teaching to &quot;bhikṣunīs&quot; in the presence of Ānanda, to which one &quot;bhikṣunī&quot;, called Sthūlanandā (), responded by criticizing Mahākāśyapa. She felt it inappropriate that Mahākāśyapa should teach in Ānanda&#x27;s presence, whom she thought of as the superior monk. Mahākāśyapa asked whether Ānanda agreed with her, but he dismissed her as a foolish woman. Then Mahākāśyapa proceeded to have Ānanda admit that the Buddha publicly had acknowledged Mahākāśyapa for numerous attainments. Sri Lankan scholar Karaluvinna hypothesizes that Mahākāśyapa did this to dispel doubts about his role as leader of the &quot;saṃgha&quot; (; monastic community). In a similar event, Mahākāśyapa reprimanded Ānanda for not taking responsibility for his pupils. In this case, Sthūlanandā heavily criticized Mahākāśyapa for doing so, and accused him in a hateful rush for having been an adherent of a non-Buddhist religious sect. In some accounts, she even undressed herself in front of him to insult him. He tried to convince her that he was a legitimate disciple of the Buddha but to no avail. Shortly after, she left the nun&#x27;s life.

According to Indologist Oskar von Hinüber, Ānanda&#x27;s pro-&quot;bhikṣunī&quot; attitude may well be the reason why there was frequent dispute between Ānanda and Mahākāśyapa. This disputes eventually led Mahākāśyapa to charge Ānanda with several offenses during the First Buddhist Council, and possibly caused two factions in the &quot;saṃgha&quot; to emerge, connected with these two disciples.

In general, Mahākāśyapa was known for his aloofness and love of solitude. But as a teacher, he was a stern mentor who held himself and his fellow renunciates against high standards. He was considered worthy of reverence, but also a sharp critic who impressed upon others that respect to him was due. Compared to Ānanda, he was much colder and stricter, but also more impartial and detached, and religion scholar Reiko Ohnuma argues that these broad differences in character explain the events between Mahākāśyapa and Ānanda better than the more specific idea of pro- and anti-&quot;bhikṣunī&quot; stances. Pāli scholar Rune Johansson (1918–1981) argued that the events surrounding Mahākāśyapa, Ānanda and the &quot;bhikṣunīs&quot; prove that in Buddhism, enlightened disciples can still be seen to make mistakes. Going against this, however, Buddhist studies scholar Bhikkhu Analayo hypothesizes that Mahākāśyapa chose to teach Ānanda to abandon favoritism and left the &quot;bhikṣunīs&quot; for Ānanda himself to deal with.

=== Teacher and mentor ===

Pāli texts state that the Buddha regarded Mahākāśyapa as his equal in exhorting monks to lead active and zealous lives, and the Buddha praised him for his capacity to instill faith in lay people by teaching. Karaluvinna believes that the Buddha may have been grooming Mahākāśyapa for his later role as leader of the &quot;saṃgha&quot;. In the Saṃyutta discourses featuring Mahākāśyapa in the Pāli and its Chinese parallels, Mahākāśyapa is raised as an example of teaching doctrine from a pure and compassionate intention. Religion scholar Shayne Clarke argues that the aloof and austere ascetic as he is presented in most texts does not provide a complete picture. Anālayo notes that he did take an active concern in community matters, spent time teaching doctrine and persuaded fellow monastics to practice asceticism. This is also shown in his role as leader of the First Council. The Sanskrit &quot;Mahākarmavibhaṅga&quot; states that Mahākāśyapa carried out important teaching work, and was able to bring Buddhism to the people in the northwest, starting with Avanti.

However, because of his stern tone of teaching and his being selective in people to teach, his teaching style came under criticism by other monks and &quot;bhikṣunīs&quot;: he was not popular, especially among &quot;bhikṣunīs&quot;. This caused him to gradually withdraw from teaching, Anālayo argues. Such an ideal of an enlightened disciple with ascetic values, as depicted in Mahākāśyapa and in a more extreme form in the disciple Bakkula, could reflect sentiments and inclinations among some groups of early Buddhists.

Clarke argues that the image of Mahākāśyapa as a detached ascetic was the way he was &quot;branded&quot; by the early Buddhists to the public in general. Studying Mūlasarvāstivāda texts of monastic discipline, Clarke points out that there is also an &quot;in-house&quot; perspective on Mahākāśyapa, which shows that he interacted with his former wife turned &quot;bhikṣunī&quot; frequently to mentor her. Shortly after Mahākāśyapa became ordained under the Buddha, he met his former wife Bhadra, who had joined an order of naked ascetics led by Nirgrantha Pūraṇa (). She was regularly targeted for rape by her fellow ascetics, however. Mahākāśyapa pitied her and persuaded her to become ordained as a Buddhist &quot;bhikṣunī&quot; instead. Nevertheless, she was still harassed often, but now only when going outside. Since this happened when Bhadra went out in villages to obtain alms, Mahākāśyapa requested the Buddha&#x27;s permission to daily give half of the alms food he had gained to her, so she did not need to go out anymore. His actions came under criticism, however, from a group of monks called the Group of Six, as well as Sthūlanandā. Although these monastics were known for their misbehavior, Clarke thinks their criticism was probably indicative of &quot;the general monastic ambivalence toward those of an ascetic bent&quot;. Writing about Sthūlanandā, Ohnuma says that Sthūlanandā went against the idea of detachment and renunciation as generally advocated in early Buddhist monasticism, which is why she hated Mahākāśyapa and Bhadra. She expressed criticism of Mahākāśyapa often, even when he did not act with typical ascetic detachment. Regardless, Mahākāśyapa continued to guide his former wife and she attained &quot;arhat&quot; () afterwards. In a poem attributed to her, she praises her ex-husband&#x27;s gifts, shared vision of the truth and spiritual friendship. Mahākāśyapa did not mention her in his poems, though.
Mahākāśyapa was sometimes consulted by other leading monks on points of doctrine. After some teachers from non-Buddhist sects asked the elder Śāriputra about the unanswered questions, he consulted with Mahākāśyapa as to why the Buddha had never given an answer to these questions. At another occasion, Śāriputra consulted him about developing efforts in the practice of Buddhist teachings. Mahākāśyapa was also Śroṇa-Koṭikarṇa&#x27;s () teacher and friend of the family, and later his &quot;upādhyāya&quot; (). He taught the &quot;Aṭṭhakavagga&quot; to him, and later Śroṇa became well known for the recitation of it.

Another aspect of Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s role as teacher was his compassion for the poor. Numerous accounts describe how he went out of his way to give impoverished donors the chance to give to him and support him in his livelihood. Such donors would typically provide him with secondhand food, which in the culture of Brahminism at the time was considered impure. By receiving food from these donors, Mahākāśyapa was considered a field of merit for them, or, in other words, an opportunity for them to make merit and &quot;vanquish their bad karma&quot;. In one case, he sought out a very poor woman who was at the end of her life, just to give her an opportunity to give a little. At first she did not dare to because she felt the food&#x27;s quality was too low, but when Mahākāśyapa kept waiting, she eventually realized he had just come for her, and gave. Religion scholar Liz Wilson argues that these accounts of generosity have been influenced by pre-Buddhist beliefs of Vedic sacrifice, in which the sacrificer and the sacrificed are connected, and the offering contains something of the person offering. By giving something of themselves, the donors acquire a new self, and purify themselves by means of the monastic recipient. In one account, a leprose person accidentally lets her finger fall off in a bowl of food she is offering. Mahākāśyapa accepts and consumes the offering anyway. Further, Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s choice for poor people to make merit is further amplified by having supernatural or extraordinary donors like deities or a wealthy merchant compete with the poor, and Mahākāśyapa accepting only the poor as donor. In one discourse, he even advises other monastics against visiting &quot;high-born families&quot;. The poor donors making an offering to Mahākāśyapa thus become empowered with a high status and power through their merit-making. Wilson surmises, &quot;[t]he perfect donor, in Mahakassapa&#x27;s eyes, is the donor who has the least to give...&quot;.

Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s insistence on accepting offerings from the poor and refusing those from high-standing or supernatural donors was part of the anti-establishment character with which Mahākāśyapa is depicted. This also includes his long hair and beard. In one text, Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s refusal of high-profile donors led to the Buddha issuing a rule that donations must not be refused.

=== Final respects to the Buddha ===

According to the early Pāli discourse about the Buddha&#x27;s last days and passing into Nirvāṇa (), Mahākāśyapa learnt about the Buddha&#x27;s &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; (; death and attainment of final Nirvāṇa) after seven days. He was resting from a journey with a following of monks when he met an &quot;ājīvika&quot; ascetic who was carrying a flower from a coral tree which originated from heaven. He asked him about the flower, and it turned out that the entire area of Kuśinagara (), where the Buddha had died, was covered in it. According to some Tibetan sources, however, Mahākāśyapa knew of the Buddha&#x27;s death because of an earthquake. In the Pāli texts, Mahākāśyapa then rushed back from the Pāva Mountain to arrive in Kuśinagara seven days later. But in the Tibetan texts, Mahākāśyapa was concerned that King Ajātaśatru might die of shock when he heard of the Buddha&#x27;s death. He therefore warned a &quot;brahmin&quot; who worked at the court, who was able to prevent the king from dying. Only then did he proceed to Kuśinagara.

It turned out the Malla people from Kuśinagara had attempted to light the funeral pyre of the Buddha but were unable to. Pāli accounts state that the monk Anuruddha explained to them that deities prevented the funeral pyre from being lit until the arrival of Mahākāśyapa, although sixth-century Chinese Buddhist texts say it was the spiritual power of the Buddha instead which caused the delay. The accounts continue that Mahākāśyapa paid &quot;deep and tender homage&quot; at the Buddha&#x27;s feet. The Buddha&#x27;s feet miraculously emerged from the coffin, in which the Buddha&#x27;s body was enshrouded with many layers of cloth. As soon as he had finished, the pyre lit spontaneously, although in some versions, Mahākāśyapa lit the pyre himself in the traditional Indian role of the eldest son.

Buddhologist André Bareau (1921–1993) regarded the episode of Mahākāśyapa learning of the Buddha&#x27;s &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; and his lighting of the pyre as an embellishment that was inserted by authors of monastic discipline over the fifth, fourth and third centuries BCE, to emphasize the person of Mahākāśyapa. Bareau reasoned that Mahākāśyapa did not attend the Buddha&#x27;s cremation in the original version, and that Mahākāśyapa could have taken a route of just a few hours via Pāva to Kuśinagara. Regardless, the story of the delay and of Mahākāśyapa eventually lighting the funeral pyre indicates how much Mahākāśyapa was respected, as he was regarded as the most important heir to the Buddha&#x27;s dispensation.

=== First Buddhist Council ===
==== Narratives ====

When the Buddha had attained &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; (death), and when Mahākāśyapa was reportedly 120 years old, the number of disciples that had once met the Buddha or had attained enlightenment was shrinking. Some monks, among them a monk called Subhadra (), expressed satisfaction that they could now do as they pleased, because their teacher the Buddha was no longer there to prohibit them from anything. Some Chinese and Tibetan texts state that there was &quot;doubt and consternation&quot; among many disciples. The Sanskrit &quot;Aśokavadāna&quot; and the Chinese &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra&quot; say that many enlightened disciples wished to stop teaching, leave the world behind and attain &quot;paranirvāṇa&quot;. This alarmed Mahākāśyapa, and he successfully attempted to stop his fellow disciples from leaving the world. To record the Buddha&#x27;s discourses and preserve monastic discipline, Mahākāśyapa set up the First Buddhist Council. According to the texts, the First Buddhist Council was held in a cave called Saptaparṇaguhā in Rājagṛha (, present-day Rajgir), which was the site of many Buddhist discourses. In the first rains retreat (, ) after the Buddha had died, Mahākāśyapa called upon Ānanda to recite the discourses he had heard, as a representative on this council. There was a rule issued, however, that only &quot;arhats&quot; were allowed to attend the council, to prevent bias like favoritism or sectarianism from clouding the disciples&#x27; memories. Ānanda had not attained enlightenment yet. Mahākāśyapa therefore did not yet allow Ānanda to attend. Although he knew that Ānanda&#x27;s presence in the council was required, he did not want to be biased by allowing an exception to the rule. The Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition adds that Mahākāśyapa initially allowed Ānanda to join as a sort of servant assisting during the council, but then was forced to remove him when the disciple Anuruddha saw that Ānanda was not yet enlightened.

Nevertheless, that night, Ānanda was able to attain enlightenment. When the Council began the next morning, Mahākāśyapa questioned Upāli, to establish the texts on monastic discipline for monks and &quot;bhikṣuṇis&quot;. Ānanda was consulted to recite the discourses and to determine which were authentic and which were not. Mahākāśyapa asked of each discourse that Ānanda listed where, when, and to whom it was given. Then the assembly agreed that Ānanda&#x27;s memories and recitations were correct, after which the discourse collection (, ) was considered finalized and closed. In some versions of the account, the Abhidharma () was also standardized during this council, or rather its precursor the &quot;Mātṛka&quot;. Some texts say it was Mahākāśyapa who reviewed it, and other texts say it was Ānanda or Śāriputra. During the recitations, one problem was raised. Before the Buddha&#x27;s &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot;, he had mentioned to Ānanda that, if required, minor rules could be abolished after his passing. Now the question remained what the Buddha had meant when he said &quot;minor rules&quot;. The monks present at the council discussed several possibilities, but it was not resolved. To prevent disrepute of the &quot;saṃgha&quot; and criticism from non-Buddhists, Mahākāśyapa opposed to abolish any rules of discipline. After the council, Mahákáyapa attempted to have the monks Gavāmpati and Purāṇa approve the results of the council, but both preferred not to give their opinion about the matter.

During the same council, Ānanda was charged for an offense by Mahākāśyapa and other members of the &quot;saṅgha&quot; for having enabled women to join the monastic order. Besides this, he was charged for having forgotten to request the Buddha to specify which offenses of monastic discipline could be disregarded; for having stepped on the Buddha&#x27;s robe; for having allowed women to honor the Buddha&#x27;s body after his death, which was not properly covered, and during which his body was sullied by their tears; and for having failed to ask the Buddha to continue to live on. Ānanda did not acknowledge these as offenses, but he conceded to do a formal confession anyway, &quot;... in faith of the opinion of the venerable elder monks&quot;.

==== Historicity ====
The most well-known version of the First Council is that of Mahākāśyapa being the head. However, texts of the Sarvāstivāda, Mūlasarvāstivāda, and Mahīśāsaka traditions relate that this was Ājñāta Kauṇḍinya () instead, as Kauṇḍinya was the most senior disciple. Buddhologist Jean Przyluski (1885–1944) argued that the earliest accounts placed Kauṇḍinya at the head of the &quot;saṃgha&quot;, and that originally, Mahākāśyapa was a conventional figure, with no administrative or leading role. However, because of his unquestioned ascetic saint-like reputation, Mahākāśyapa came to replace Kauṇḍinya&#x27;s role as leader during the cremation and the First Council. Przyluski&#x27;s theory has been criticized, however, on the grounds that it is difficult to maintain that the three textual traditions he mentioned are the oldest. Still, Bareau argued that the incident with Subhadra leading to Mahākāśyapa summoning the council is a later insertion, though early enough to be found in all traditions of early Buddhist texts. He believed it was the authors of texts of monastic discipline that inserted it shortly after the Buddha&#x27;s passing away, at the end of the fifth century BCE, to glorify Mahākāśyapa.

Tradition states that the First Council lasted for seven months. However, many scholars, from the late 19th century onward, have considered the historicity of the First Council improbable. Some scholars, such as Orientalist Ivan Minayev (1840–1890), thought there must have been assemblies after the Buddha&#x27;s death, but considered only the main characters and some events before or after the First Council historical, and not the council itself. Other scholars, such as Bareau and Indologist Hermann Oldenberg (1854–1920), considered it likely that the account of the First Council was written after the Second Council, and based on that of the Second, since there were not any major problems to solve after the Buddha&#x27;s death, or any other need to organize the First Council. On the other hand, archaeologist Louis Finot (1864–1935) and Indologist (1901–1935) thought the account of the First Council was authentic, because of the correspondences between the Pāli texts and the Sanskrit traditions. Orientalist Louis de La Vallée-Poussin (1869–1938) and Indologist Nalinaksha Dutt (1893–1973) thought it was historical, but in the form of a simple recitation of discipline (, ; according to Dutt, in order settle the &quot;minor rules&quot;) not a complete council with a full review of the discourses. Indologist Richard Gombrich, following Bhikkhus Sujato and Brahmali&#x27;s arguments, considers that the Council &quot;makes good sense&quot;. They argue that the Council was historical, because all the known versions of monastic discipline relate it. Some of those, such as the Theravāda discipline, do not include the recitation of the Abhidharma in their account, even though it was an important part of their identitythis shows the historical nature of the accounts.

Indologist Erich Frauwallner (1898–1974) noted that in the earliest Buddhist discourses little mention is made of Mahākāśyapa, especially when compared to Ānanda. However, in the accounts about the First Council, Mahākāśyapa appears very prominent, whereas Ānanda is humbled and given far less credit. Frauwallner argued this points at &quot;a deep reaching modification and revaluation of the tradition&quot; concerning the position of these two figures. On a similar note, Buddhist studies scholar Jonathan Silk remarks that the earliest Chinese translations hardly mention Mahākāśyapa. Ray argues there is a difference in this between Pāli texts and texts from other early schools: the Pāli version of Mahākāśyapa is a much more ordinary person, depicted with far less supernatural powers and moral authority than in texts such as those from the Mūlasarvāstivāda discipline and in the &quot;Mahāvastu&quot;. Although there are some Pāli texts that do emphasize forest renunciation, these are fragmented elements that stand in stark contrast with Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s general role in the Pāli history of the monastic establishment.

Von Hinüber, Przyluski and Bareau have argued that the account of Ānanda being charged with offenses during the council indicate tensions between competing Early Buddhist schools, i.e. schools that emphasized the discourses and schools that emphasized monastic discipline. These differences have affected the scriptures of each tradition: e.g. the Pāli and Mahīśāsaka textual traditions portray a Mahākāśyapa that is more critical of Ānanda than that the Sarvāstivāda tradition depicts him, reflecting a preference for discipline on the part of the former traditions, and a preference for discourse for the latter. Analyzing six recensions of different textual traditions of the &quot;Mahāparinibbāna Sutta&quot; extensively, Bareau distinguished two layers in the text, an older and a newer one, the former, fifth century BCE, belonging to the compilers that emphasized discourse, the latter, mostly fourth and third century BCE, to the ones that emphasized discipline; the former emphasizing the figure of Ānanda, the latter Mahākāśyapa. Buddhologist André Migot (1892–1967) argued, too, that the oldest texts (fifth century BCE) mostly glorify Ānanda as being the most well-learned (, ); a second series of newer texts (fourth century-early third century BCE) glorify Mahākāśyapa as being eminent in discipline (, ); and the newest texts (mid third century BCE) glorify Śāriputra as being the wisest (, ). Mahākāśyapa was mostly associated with the texts of monastic discipline, during the fourth century until early third century BCE when Buddhism was prominent in Vaiśālī. Bareau, Przyluski and Indologist I. B. Horner (1896–1981) therefore argued that the offenses Ānanda were charged with were a later interpolation. Scholar of religion Ellison Banks Findly disagrees, however, because the account in the texts of monastic discipline fits in with the &quot;Mahāparinibbāna Sutta&quot; and with Ānanda&#x27;s character as generally depicted in the texts. Minayev thought the charges were an ancient tradition, because they are not usually the material of legends, because the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang (602–664) reported a &quot;stūpa&quot; (; a memorial mound or monument) that was erected in memory of the event, and because the ambiguity about what constitutes major and minor rules would have been typical for that period.

Expanding on the theory of the two factions, Przyluski noted that the figure of Ānanda represents Buddhism in an early form, whereas Mahākaśyapa represents a Buddhism that had undergone reform. Ānanda represents a &quot;religion of love&quot;, whereas Mahākaśyapa represents &quot;a rough ascetic spirit&quot;. Migot interpreted Ānanda&#x27;s figure as a devotionalist form of Buddhism focused on the guru, replaced by Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s established monasticism with less focus on devotion.

Although the Buddha did not appoint a formal successor, Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s leading role and seniority effectively made him the head of the &quot;saṃgha&quot; during the first twenty years after the Buddha&#x27;s &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot;. After the passing away of the Buddha and his close disciples Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana, he had become the most influential figure in the Buddhist order. In the Early Buddhist Texts, Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s death is not discussed. This is discussed in post-canonical texts, however.

In many Indian Sanskrit and East Asian texts, from as early as the second century CE, Mahākāśyapa is considered the first patriarch of the lineage which transmitted the teaching of the Buddha, with Ānanda being the second. One of the earliest motifs of a tradition of patriarchs is that of the Five Masters of the Dharma (), found in Sanskrit texts from the second century CE, including the &quot;Aśokāvadāna&quot; and the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot;, and many archaeological findings. This tradition may in itself be based on early Buddhist accounts about the First Council, but further expanded on the idea of the preservation of the teachings. The accounts about the Five Masters seems to derive not so much from a concern about the transmission of the teaching though, but rather a concern regarding the absence of the Buddha himself. The texts gave the Masters of the Dharma each a similar role and charisma as the Buddha, or, as Buddhist studies scholar John S. Strong puts it, &quot;all, in a sense, Buddhas in their own time&quot;. This fit in with the concept of inheritance in ancient India, in which a son would not only inherit his father&#x27;s possessions, but also his position and identity. Several early Buddhist schools would expand on the idea of the Five Masters of the Dharma, including the Sarvāstivadins, the Mūlasarvāstivādins and the Sthāviras, each of which extended the list to include their own masters as patriarchs.

There is an account dating back from the Sarvāstivāda and Mūlasarvāstivāda textual traditions which states that before Mahākāśyapa died, he bestowed the Buddha&#x27;s teaching on Ānanda as a formal passing on of authority, telling Ānanda to pass the teaching on to his pupil Śāṇakavāsī (; Śāṇakavāsin or Śāṇāvasika). Mahākāśyapa made a prediction that later would come true that a lay person called Śāṇakavāsī would make many gifts to the &quot;saṅgha&quot; during a feast. After this event, Ānanda would successfully persuade him to become ordained and be his pupil. Later, just before Ānanda died, he passed the teaching on to his pupil as Mahākāśyapa had told him to. Ray notes that Mahākāśyapa is depicted here as choosing not only his successor, but also the successor of his successor, which emphasizes the preeminent position that Mahākāśyapa was seen to have.

Buddhist studies scholars Akira Hirakawa (1915–2002) and Bibhuti Baruah have expressed skepticism about the teacherstudent relationship between Mahākāśyapa and Ānanda. They have argued that there was discord between the two, as indicated in the early texts. Hirakawa has further hypothesized that Mahākāśyapa and Ānanda were co-disciples, with the same teacher being Gautama Buddha, so there would be no need for a transmission between the two. East Asian religion scholar Elizabeth Morrison cites a tract by the Zen scholar Qisong (1007–1072) about the tradition of patriarchs in Buddhism. He noted the problem of a transmission between co-disciples who are not master and student. He resolved the problem by comparing Mahākāśyapa and Ānanda to siblings who inherit according to birth order. Responding to Hirakawa&#x27;s arguments, Silk further argues that the unilinear nature of the transmission made it impossible for both Mahākāśyapa and Ānanda to receive the transmission from the Buddha, so Ānanda had to receive the transmission from Mahākāśyapa instead.

=== Preserving the Buddha&#x27;s relics ===
The fifth-century commentary to the &quot;Dīgha Nikāya&quot; relates that after the Buddha&#x27;s &quot;paranirvāṇa&quot;, Mahākāśyapa was concerned that the Buddha&#x27;s remains or relics would become too dispersed, since they were now divided in eight portions. He gathered the portions of the Buddha&#x27;s relics, by requesting them from the families who had preserved them, though he left a token amount of relics with the families. With the help of King Ajātaśatru, he then preserved them in an underground chamber called the &quot;shrine for the eighty disciples&quot; to the east of Rājagṛha. Because of the name, Southeast Asia scholar François Lagirarde raises the question whether this chamber may also have been intended for the burial of relics of foremost disciples, but Strong interprets that it was a ruse: the whole operation was done in secrecy because Mahākāśyapa feared for the safety of the Buddha&#x27;s relics. Later, according to post-canonical Buddhist texts such as the Theravāda &quot;Paṭhamasambodhi&quot;, the remains thus enshrined in one place were taken out and divided by emperor Aśoka (268–232 BCE) throughout India in 84,000 portions. Instead of the relics being hid away somewhere, they were now accessible to the population at large.

The earliest accounts have Mahākāśyapa merely visit and pay his respects to each of the eight portions of the relics; later accounts have him gather the relics as well. There is a parallel here with the First Council, in which Mahākāśyapa gathered the entire body of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings (; ) in one place, as he is depicted gathering the Buddha&#x27;s remains (Sanskrit and ) in one place. Still, there may be a historical basis to the motif of the single place with the Buddha&#x27;s relics. Przyluski and Bareau have argued on textual and other grounds that the Buddha&#x27;s relics were originally kept in one single place, in a sepulcher (Przyluski) or a &quot;stūpa&quot; (Bareau).

=== Awaiting Maitreya ===
==== Accounts ====
Post-canonical Sanskrit texts such as &quot;Avadānas&quot;, as well as the travelogues of medieval Chinese pilgrims, numerous Chinese translations, and Southeast Asian vernacular texts, relate Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s death. Some of the earliest of these are a Chinese translation from the fourth century CE and the &quot;Aśokavadāna&quot;, which is dated to the second century CE. They state that Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s body was enshrined underneath the mountain Kukkuṭapāda ( Gurupādaka, in Magadha) where it remains until the arising of the next Buddha, Maitreya ().

A Thai text relates that Mahākāśyapa knew through his meditation that he was about to die and attain &quot;paranirvāṇa&quot; on the next day. The day after, he informed his pupils of his death and taught them, then went for alms, wearing the robe he had received from the Buddha. In the texts on discipline from the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition, it says he also went to pay his respects to the Buddha&#x27;s relics. In several texts, he attempted to visit King Ajātaśatru, but the king was asleep. Mahākāśyapa then cleaned the monastery, and proceeded to Kukkuṭapāda, the place of burial he had selected. He gave a final teaching to the lay people, and performed supernatural accomplishments.

Having settled in a cave there in the middle of three peaks, he covered himself in the robe he had received from the Buddha. The texts then state he took a vow that his body would stay there until the arriving of Maitreya Buddha, which is an uncountable number of years. His body would not decay in that time, but become visible and disintegrate in the time of Maitreya Buddha. Though Mahākāśyapa died after the vow, his body remained intact according to his resolution. The three mountain peaks then closed in on the body. Later, King Ajātaśatru heard about the news of Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s passing, and fainted of grief. He wanted to visit Mahākāśyapa once more. Ānanda and King Ajātaśatru went to the mountain, which slightly opened, just enough for the two to see Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s body. In the Mūlasarvāstivāda discipline and the &quot;Aśokāvadāna&quot;, the king wanted to cremate the body, but Ānanda told him it would remain until the time of Maitreya Buddha. When they left, the mountain closed up again. Later, emperor Aśoka would also visit the mountain with the monk Upagupta, after the latter took him to see the &quot;stūpa&quot; of the Buddha&#x27;s disciples.

The accounts then continue that in the future, in the time of Maitreya Buddha, the mountain opens upon his visit, in &quot;the way a &quot;cakravartin&quot; opens a city gate&quot;. However, people in Maitreya Buddha&#x27;s time are much taller than during the time of Gautama Buddha. In one text, Maitreya Buddha&#x27;s disciples are therefore contemptuous of Mahākāśyapa, whose head is no larger than an insect to them. Gautama Buddha&#x27;s robe barely covers two of their fingers, making them marvel how small Gautama Buddha was. Eventually, in several accounts, Maitreya Buddha takes Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s body in his hands, explains to his pupils what great person he was, and sees the body miraculously burn in his hands, according to Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s vow. But in the well-known account of Xuanzang, as well as the Tocharian &quot;Maitreyasamitināṭaka&quot; and other accounts, Mahākāśyapa is alive and waiting in his &quot;cavern of meditation&quot;, until the time of Maitreya: he hands over the robe to Maitreya Buddha explaining who it is from, and expresses his joy at having met two Buddhas. He then hovers in the air, displays supernatural accomplishments that are reminiscent of Gautama Buddha, and bursts miraculously into flames. In the Mūlasarvāstivāda discipline and the &quot;Aśokāvadāna&quot;, the account ends with Maitreya Buddha&#x27;s disciples attaining &quot;arhat&quot;, as the encounter has caused their pride to be humbled.

==== Cults and practices ====

The Kukkuṭapāda Mountain was identified by traditional authors with several places in North India, and some of these places had become famous place of pilgrimage and cult by the time the Chinese pilgrim Faxian (337–422 CE) and later Xuanzang visited. These pilgrimage places, featuring depictions of Mahākāśyapa, have been connected by Buddhist studies scholar Vincent Tournier with an aspiration to be born in Maitreya&#x27;s following.

In sixth-century Chinese steles, Mahākāśyapa is often depicted waiting for Maitreya Buddha in the cave, cloaked in the robe and a hood. He is given a role as successor of the Gautama Buddha. Buddhist studies scholar Miyaji Akira proposes that Mahākāśyapa waiting in the cave became the basis of a theme in Korean Buddhist art featuring monks meditating in caves. Korean studies scholar Sunkyung Kim does point out, however, that similar motifs can already be found in earlier Buddhist art, showing Buddha Gautama sitting. The story of Mahākāśyapa awaiting Maitreya Buddha had an important impact in Japan, up until early modern times. Jikigyō (1671–1724), the leader of a chiliastic religious movement, locked himself in his monastic cell to starve to death, and have his mummified corpse meet with Maitreya Buddha in the future.

With regard to South- and Southeast Asia, the interest in the relationship between Maitreya and Mahākāśyapa spread to Ceylon during the reign of Kassapa II (652–661) and Kassapa V (929–939). They most likely honored Mahākāśyapa for his role in the Abhidharma recitations at the First Council. Kassapa V identified with Mahākāśyapa () and aspired to be reborn with Maitreya as well. Presently, the account of Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; is not widely recognized in dominant Buddhist traditions in Thailand, but Lagirarde raises the question whether this is only a recent development. It is still a common belief among the Thai that the body of a very pure and venerated monk will not decompose.

==== Scholarly analysis ====

In the early texts, Mahākāśyapa is depicted as the keeper of the Buddhist teaching during the First Council; in the story of him awaiting Maitreya Buddha this role is extended. In some early Chinese texts, Mahākāśyapa is seen stating to Ānanda that all devotees present at the &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; of the Buddha Gautama will be reborn in Tusita heaven and meet Maitreya; in the story of the cave this association with Maitreya is further extended. Since the end of Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s life after the First Council was not discussed in the early texts, his demise, or the postponement thereof, naturally gave rise to legends.

Tournier speculates that the story of Mahākāśyapa resolving that his body endure until the next Buddha is a &quot;conscious attempt to dress the &quot;arhat&quot; in a &quot;bodhisattva&quot; (Buddha-to-be) garb&quot;. On a similar note, Strong argues the story shows sentiments that are at the root of the &quot;bodhisattva&quot; ideal, and may have led to the idea of the Eighteen Arhats () that &quot;postpone&quot; their death to protect the Buddhist teaching till the arrival of Maitreya. Indologist Padmanabh Jaini argues that the story was created by the Mūlasarvāstivādins to connect Maitreya Buddha to Gautama Buddha, through a line of transmission. In this, they may have been influenced by the Indo-Greeks and Persians, who ruled the area where the Mūlasarvāstivādins lived. Historian Max Deeg raises the question, however, that if Jaini is correct, why no traces of an early development of the legend can be found. Silk also hypothesizes that the story was developed by Mahāyāna authors to create a narrative to connect the two Buddhas physically through Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s &quot;paranirvāṇa&quot; and the passing on of the robe. Lagirarde notes, however, that not all Āgama sources insist on connecting the two Buddhas. Furthermore, Pāli, Thai and Laotian sources do not mention the passing on of the robe, yet the meeting is still narrated as significant. Silk also notes that the Sanskrit texts the &quot;Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra&quot;, the &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitōpadeśa&quot; and the &quot;Divyāvadāna&quot; contain the story of Mahākāśyapa under the mountain, and do not mention the robe of the Buddha at all. But in every version of the account there is a physical connection between Gautama Buddha, Mahākāśyapa and Maitreya Buddha. He concludes that Mahāyāna authors used Mahākāśyapa as a way to legitimize the Mahāyāna teachings, by affirming that there were more authentic teachings which had not yet come.

Translator Saddhatissa, and with him Silk, argue that there is no equivalent account about Mahākāśyapa waiting in the cave that can be found in the Pāli tradition apart from a single reference in a post-canonical text. But Lagirarde points out that the reference found by Saddhatissa and Silk (called the &quot;Mahāsampiṇḍanidāna&quot;, which Saddhatissa dates to the twelfth century) does indicate the story was known in the Pāli tradition. Lagirarde also lists several later vernacular texts from Theravāda countries that mention the account, in the Siamese, Northern Thai and Laotian languages. Indeed, Silk himself points at a Pāli sub-commentary to the &quot;Aṅguttara Nikāya&quot; which mentions that Mahākāśyapa retreated at age hundred twenty in a cave close to where the First Council was held. He would dwell there and &quot;make the Buddha&#x27;s teaching last for 5000 years&quot;. The First Council itself was held in a cave too, and it may have led to the motif of Mahākāśyapa waiting in a cave. Furthermore, in some canonical Pāli texts Mahākāśyapa talks about the decay and disappearance of the Buddhist dispensation, which may also have been a foundation for the story.

=== In Mahāyāna discourses ===
In general, Sanskrit texts often mention Mahākāśyapa. Silk argues that Mahāyāna polemicists used Mahākāśyapa as an interlocutor in their discourses, because of his stern conservative stance in the early texts and opposition of innovation, and his close association with Gautama Buddha. This fit with the conservative ideas on Buddhist practice among the early Mahāyāna authors, and the need to legitimize Mahāyāna doctrine, surrounding them with an aura of authenticity.

==== In Chan Buddhism ====

Mahākāśyapa has a significant role in texts from the Chan tradition. In East Asia, there is a Chan and Zen tradition, first recounted in &quot;The Jingde Record of the Transmission of the Lamp&quot; (), which is a 1036 genealogical record about Chan Buddhism. According to this tradition, Mahākāśyapa once received a direct &quot;transmission&quot; from Gautama Buddha. Chan and Zen purport to lead their adherents to insights akin to that mentioned by the Buddha in the &quot;Flower Sermon&quot; () given on the Vulture Peak, in which he held up a white flower and just admired it in his hand, without speaking. All the disciples just looked on without knowing how to react, but only Mahākāśyapa smiled faintly, and the Buddha picked him as one who truly understood him and was worthy to be the one receiving a special &quot;mind-to-mind transmission&quot; ().

Thus, a way within Buddhism developed which concentrated on direct experience rather than on rational creeds or revealed scriptures. Chan therefore became a method of meditative religion which seek to enlighten people in the manner that Mahākāśyapa experienced: &quot;A special transmission outside the scriptures, directly pointing at the heart of man, looking into one&#x27;s own nature.&quot; This transmission was then purportedly passed on by the Buddha to Mahākāśyapa, who then passed it on to a long list of Indian and Chinese patriarchs, eventually reaching Bodhidharma (5th or 6th century CE), who brought Chan Buddhism to China, and passed it on to Huike (487–593 CE). The Jingde Record took the passing on of the robe from Buddha Gautama to Mahākāśyapa to refer to a secret transmission of Chan teachings, within the specific Chan lineage.The story of the Flower Sermon was also recorded in later texts, between the 11th and 14th centuries. At least one of these texts was probably written to defend the authenticity of the Flower Sermon, which was even questioned in Chan circles. Eventually, the story became well known among both Buddhist monks and Chan-oriented literati. It was incorporated as a meditative topic in the 1228 Chan text &quot;The Gateless Barrier&quot; (), in which the Buddha confirmed that the mind-to-mind transmission was complete. Although the Flower Sermon&#x27;s main point is to depict a wordless special transmission &quot;outside the teaching&quot;, the tradition was defended and authorized through Buddhist scripture.

The Flower Sermon event is regarded by modern scholars as an invention, but does provide insight into the philosophical concerns and identity of Chan Buddhism. Since Chan Buddhism values the direct transmission from the teacher&#x27;s mind to that of the student, more so than scriptures, the unbroken lineage of patriarchs is an important part of the tradition. Moreover, whereas in many Buddhist traditions it was recounted that Mahākāśyapa would pass on Gautama Buddha&#x27;s robe to Maitreya Buddha, in Chan a different tradition developed, in which Mahākāśyapa passed on the robe to the next patriarch Ānanda, and so on through a list of Indian and Chinese patriarchs. Some Chan masters, such as Dōgen (1200–1253), did believe that this robe would eventually be passed forward to Mahākāśyapa and eventually Maitreya.

As Japanese Buddhist texts saw the transmission of Gautama Buddha&#x27;s robe as a symbol of birth and gestation, similarly, the flower in the Flower Sermon was seen as a symbol of death and cremation. Besides the Flower Sermon, the appearance of the Buddha&#x27;s feet when Mahākāśyapa pays his final respects, as well as the Buddha sharing his seat with Mahākāśyapa are also considered mind-to-mind transmissions.

=== Values ===

Being one of the most well-known disciples of the Buddha, Mahākāśyapa embodies the highest ideals of early Buddhist monasticism. Buddhist studies scholar Asanga Tilakaratne points out that Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s ascetic and austere values and dislike for women on the one hand, and Ānanda&#x27;s active, city-dwelling values and support for women on the other hand, are two sides of the spectrum than can be seen throughout the history of Buddhist monasticism. Monastic vocations and monastic orders tend to be along these two ends of the spectrum, with compassionate engagement on the one hand, and dispassionate detachment on the other hand. This can be traced back to these two disciples. Specifically, the Theravāda tradition has been influenced much by the model of Mahākāśyapa. In some early Theravāda texts about Mahākāśyapa, the values of forest renunciation are contrasted with that of settled monasticism. Renunciation in the forest is considered superior, and settled monasticism is considered a deterioration of the holy life.

Przyluski and several other scholars have argued that in the early texts, Mahākaśyapa represents ascetic and &quot;brahmin&quot; values. The ascetic values are seen in the account in which Mahākaśyapa refuses to give up ascetic practices, going against the advice of the Buddha. Such refusal was highly unusual for a disciple of the Buddha. The &quot;brahmin&quot; values can be observed from the account of the accusations leveled against Ānanda, which appear to be based more on &quot;brahmin&quot; values than violations of monastic discipline. Both these &quot;brahmin&quot; and ascetic values, as represented by the figure of Mahākaśyapa, would lead to strong opposition to the founding of the &quot;bhikṣunī&quot; order in early Buddhism. The ascetic values Mahākāśyapa represented, however, were a reaction to less austere tendencies that appeared in early Buddhism at the time.

Ray concludes that the texts present Mahākāśyapa in different ways. Mahākāśyapa assumes many roles and identities in the texts, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a &quot;guarantor of future justice&quot; in the time of Maitreya. Indologist C.A.F. Rhys Davids (1857–1942) stated he was &quot;both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast&quot;. His figure unites the opposites of established monasticism and forest renunciation, and &quot;transcends any particular Buddhist group or set of interests&quot;. Drawing from Przyluski&#x27;s textual criticism, Ray argues that when Mahākāśyapa replaced Kauṇḍinya as the head of the &quot;saṃgha&quot; after the Buddha&#x27;s passing away, his ascetic saint-like role was appropriated into the monastic establishment to serve the need for a charismatic leader. This led him to possess both the character of the anti-establishment ascetic, as well as that of the settled monastic governor.

=== Eldest son of the Buddha ===

In Abhidharma texts of several Buddhist schools, the fulfilment of Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s vow in the mountain Kukuṭapada is connected to a vow Gautama Buddha took to prevent his body from being cremated before Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s arrival at his teacher&#x27;s cremation grounds. Buddhist studies scholar Gregory Schopen analyzes several post-canonical Buddhist texts and concludes that in both instances, a vow is taken based on psychic powers, which is then shown to be effective after the death of the person with those psychic powers. Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s psychic powers are needed for his role in the texts as the one who preserves the Buddha&#x27;s dispensation. Indeed, later Buddhist texts depict Mahākāśyapa as the eldest son of the Buddha, who leads both the funerals of his father and, as his heir, presides over the First Council. Eventually, he came to be seen as the first teacher after the Buddha and as the beginning of a lineage of teachers. This conceptualization is found within several Buddhist schools, including the Theravādins and the Mahāsaṅghikas. Indeed, Theravāda sees him as a sort of &quot;Father of the Church&quot;.

=== Historical lineages ===
Furthermore, Mahākāśyapa is described in the Pāli commentary to the &quot;Dīgha Nikāya&quot; as the person responsible for the preservation of collection that was the precursor to the &quot;Saṃyutta Nikāya&quot; and the &quot;Saṃyuktaka Āgama&quot;. In both the Nikāya and Āgama version of this same collection, therefore, a great deal of attention is given to him, and Tournier thinks it possible that the lineage of teachers preserving this collection, probably originating from the Sthāviras, also conceived themselves as preservers of Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s legacy. This is also reflected in the language used in inscriptions from the Sinhalese monk Mahānāman (5th–6th century CE) and in later texts used in the Sinhalese tradition, which both connect Mahānāman&#x27;s lineage with that of Mahākāśyapa, and also that of the future Buddha Maitreya. However, some Pāli sources indicate that Mahākāśyapa was part of the lineage of the &quot;Aṅguttara Nikāya&quot; reciters instead.

One of the early Buddhist schools, the Kāśyapīyas (), was founded by Mahākāśyapa, according to scholars Paramārtha (499–569) and Kuiji (632–682). Other traditional scholars have argued instead it was another Kāśyapa, who lived three centuries after the Buddha. When the differences between the early Buddhist schools grew more prominent, the Mahāsaṅghikas affiliated themselves with the figure of Mahākāśyapa, and claimed him as their founder and patron-saint. They presented themselves as more orthodox than other schools, such as Theravāda.

=== In art and culture ===

In Buddhist art, depictions of Mahākāśyapa have &quot;left an indelible mark&quot;. He was depicted in &quot;paranirvāṇa&quot; scenes as a reassurance that Gautama Buddha&#x27;s dispensation would not be lost; he was depicted next to Maitreya Buddha as an anticipatory vision of the future. The scene in which he paid his final respects to the Buddha became a well-known depiction in Buddhist art, and Strong has argued that it may have led to the cult of the Buddha&#x27;s footprints.

In Chinese art, Mahākāśyapa is usually depicted with a long beard and hair. Buddhist studies scholar Mun-Keat Choong hypothesizes that these depictions found their way back in at least one Chinese Buddhist discourse, the discourse in which Mahākāśyapa is criticized for looking inappropriate. This may have been the work of the translators. In Mahāyāna iconography, Mahākāśyapa is often depicted flanking the Buddha at the left side, together with Ānanda at the right. The two disciples have been very popular in art depictions since the time of Greco-Buddhism, and Migot argued that the tradition of Mahākāśyapa and Ānanda being the Buddha&#x27;s two main disciples was older than that of the tradition of Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana, because in the &quot;Mahāparinibbāna Sutta&quot; only the former pair features, and the traditional explanation for this that Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana did not outlive the Buddha seems unconvincing. In Chan temples, the image of Mahākāśyapa is often placed in a central position, being the first patriarch of the tradition. In the history of Mahāyāna Buddhism, as the rag-robe asceticism of Mahākāśyapa contributed to his legendary figure and the legitimation of the Mahāyāna creed, rag-robes became an icon in East Asian Buddhism. The Buddha&#x27;s disciples and founders of East Asian Buddhism were often depicted in them. When &quot;fukudenkai&quot; sewing groups were founded in Japan in the early twentieth century, to introduce sewing robes for monastics as a spiritual practice, they often referred to the early Buddhist account of Mahākāśyapa receiving the rag-robes from the Buddha. &quot;Fukudenkai&quot; practitioners usually use second-hand clothes to sew the rag-robes, just like in the time of the Buddha.

In May 2022, Sushant More, a botany researcher from Mumbai, Maharashtra discovered a new plant &quot;Lepidagathis mahakassapae&quot; endemic to the state and named it after Mahākāśyapa, following the Pāli spelling of his name.

More than 50,000 people use the terminal daily, making it the tenth-busiest railroad station in North America and the sixth-busiest in the New York area. It is also the second-busiest railroad station in New Jersey, behind only Newark Penn Station, and its third-busiest transportation facility, after Newark Liberty International Airport and Newark Penn Station.

The rail and ferry terminal buildings were constructed in 1907 by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, a former Class 1 railroad. In 1930, Thomas Edison was at the controls for the first departure of a regular-service electric multiple-unit train from Hoboken Terminal to Montclair. In 1973, the terminal building was added to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places.

Hoboken Terminal is considered a milestone in American transportation development, initially combining rail, ferry, subway, streetcar, and pedestrian services. Later, bus and light-rail services were added to the terminals. Another feature of the terminal&#x27;s design is the terminal&#x27;s 225-foot (69 m) clock tower. The tower was replaced by a radio tower that stood for more than half a century, until being removed in June 2006, when it was replaced with a new clock tower modeled after the original.

== History ==
=== 19th century ===
The site of the terminal had been used since colonial times to link Manhattan Island and points west. In 1811, the first steam-powered ferries began called Hoboken Ferryboats service under John Stevens, an inventor who founded Hoboken. In 1889, due to several complaints through &quot;The New York Times&quot;, changes were made to the service such as bigger boats for passengers, and more trips.

The coming of the railroads brought more and more travelers to the west bank of the Hudson River. Cuts and tunnels were constructed through Bergen Hill to rail–ferry terminals on the west bank of the river and the Upper New York Bay. The first of the Bergen Tunnels under Jersey City Heights was opened in 1877 by the Morris and Essex Railroad, which was leased by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&amp;W).

=== 20th century ===
The facility that was in the place of the Hoboken Terminal caught fire and burned down in 1905 after the &quot;Hopatcong&quot;, a ferry docked at the terminal, caught fire at midnight, which spread to the original facility. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad decided to build another large terminal since they had more than enough funds. The new facility was planned by William Truesdale, who worked to modernize the DL&amp;W railroad. The rail and ferry terminal buildings were constructed in 1907 by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJ/NRHP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the railroad opened the second parallel tunnel. Both tunnels are still used by NJ Transit. The tubes of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad, forerunner of PATH, were extended to Hoboken Terminal upon its opening. The first revenue train on the new line ran from the terminal on February 26, 1908.

In 1930, Thomas Edison was at the controls for the first departure of a regular-service electric multiple unit train from Hoboken Terminal to Montclair. One of the first installations of central air-conditioning in a public space was at the station, as was the first non-experimental use of mobile phones.

In 1914, George A. Cullen, the Passenger Traffic Manager for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, stated that Hoboken Terminal handled more than 17 million railroad passengers and 18 million additional ferry passengers.

In 1942, the clock tower of the terminal was removed to reclaim the copper to use in World War II. After the war, Hoboken suffered another blow when automobile and air travel rose to prominence at the expense of the railroads. Amtrak started operating in 1971, and by then intercity services by the then merged Erie and DL&amp;W railroads stopped operating out of Hoboken. The final train between Hoboken and Chicago departed the night of January 5, 1970, and arrived on January 6 in Chicago&#x27;s Dearborn Station.

Despite the difficulties of the railroad industry, which culminated in bankruptcy for many railroads through the 1970s, the terminal has always been an essential link for New York-bound commuters, which saved it from the threat of demolition. The popular disapproval of the razing of the nearby Pennsylvania Station in 1963, (and its replacement by Madison Square Garden and a new Penn Station below ground level) may have also helped Hoboken Terminal&#x27;s survival.

Numerous streetcar lines (eventually owned and operated by the Public Service Railway), including the Hoboken Inclined Cable Railway, originated and terminated at the station until bustitution was completed on August 7, 1949.

At the peak of intercity rail service, five passenger terminals were operated by competing railroad companies along the Hudson Waterfront. Of the five, Hoboken Terminal is the only one still in active use. Those at Weehawken (New York Central), Pavonia (Erie Railroad), and Exchange Place (Pennsylvania Railroad) were demolished in the 1960s, while the one in Jersey City (Central Railroad of New Jersey) was partially restored and is now part of Liberty State Park.

In October 1956, four years before its merger with the DL&amp;W to form the Erie Lackawanna Railway, the Erie Railroad began to shift its trains from Pavonia Terminal to Hoboken. The final Erie trains to be moved to Hoboken, in 1959, were from the Northern Branch. In October 1965, on former Erie routes, there were five trains each weekday to Wanaque/Midvale on the Greenwood Lake branch, three to Nyack on the Northern Branch, three to Waldwick via the Newark Branch, two to Essex Fells on its Caldwell Branch, two to Carlton Hill on the former Erie Main Line, and one to Newton on the Sussex Branch. All those trains were dropped in 1966.

Ferry service from the terminal to lower Manhattan ended on November 22, 1967, due to declining ridership and revenues. It resumed in 1989 on the south side of the terminal and moved back to the restored ferry slips inside the historic terminal on December 7, 2011.

In 1973, the terminal building was added to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places. The PATH station&#x27;s platforms were lengthened in 1987 to allow the station to accommodate eight-car trains.

In 1990, the New Jersey Historic Preservation Bond Program gave a grant of $400,000 towards repairs and restoration of the Terminal. In 1991, another grant of $300,000 was given. The money was used towards repairing the ferry terminal&#x27;s roof and clerestory.

In 1999, the New Jersey Devils&#x27; proposed to build an arena atop the Hoboken Terminal, which would be on the Hudson waterfront. The proposal never went through.

=== 21st century ===

On August 14, 2003, amid the Northeast blackout of 2003, PATH and NJ Transit Rail Operations were unable to operate anywhere, including Hoboken Terminal. Commuters from New Jersey used the NY Waterway ferry to Hoboken Terminal as an alternative, and passengers said it was so packed it caused concern. Operations of PATH and NJ Transit trains resumed the morning of August 15 with the use of diesel trains.

Access to the Region&#x27;s Core (ARC) was a proposed commuter-rail project to add new rail tunnels under the Hudson River, but the plan was canceled in 2010. In 2013, the New Jersey General Assembly passed a resolution supporting the extension of New York City Number 7 subway into Secaucus as a cheaper alternative to the proposed ARC tunnel. The plans never went through despite the idea being revived as possibly being a part of, or along with, the Gateway Project, which also proposes new tunnels, and bridges over the Hudson River.

A renovation that lasted from 2005 to 2009 demolished and rebuilt walls to resemble their original appearance; the terminal&#x27;s clock tower was rebuilt as well along with the original neon-lit Lackawanna sign.

The station was badly damaged during Hurricane Sandy on October 29, 2012. A storm surge inundated the facility; the water rose as high as in the PATH tunnels. Daytime PATH service to midtown Manhattan was restored on December 19. The waiting room reopened in January 2013, while extensive repairs were still in progress. Pre-Sandy service patterns were gradually restored by March 1, 2013.

As of 2017, the station was the ninth-busiest railway station in North America.

On October 5, 2022, officials broke ground on Hoboken Connect, a projected five-year project to renovate the Terminal and its immediate vicinity. The plans call for erecting a 20-story commercial building at 5 and 23 Hudson Place and a 27-story, 389-unit residential building on Observer Highway. Planned improvements to Warrington Plaza include movable seats and modular structures for public use. The ferry terminal will be renovated to add retail space and bicycle storage on the ground floor, while commercial space on its second floor will be constructed to house either transport functions, or tenants such as markets, eateries, or areas for arts and culture. In March 2024, the NJ Transit board awarded a $211 million contract to Schiavone Construction for the construction of six tracks and three platforms, as well as a $2 million contract to Voestalpine Railway Systems Nortrak for trackwork. NJ Transit and LCOR agreed to a ground lease for the Hoboken Connect site in March 2024, and work began that May.

In October 2024, the PANYNJ announced that the PATH station at Hoboken Terminal would be closed for most of February 2025 so the tracks, platforms, and four staircases could be replaced.

=== Accidents ===
In December 1985, an NJ Transit train crashed into the concrete bumper at Hoboken Terminal, injuring 54. The 1985 crash was said to have been caused by a lubricant that had been applied to the tracks to test train wheels.

In May 2011, a PATH train crashed into a bumper block at Hoboken Terminal, injuring 34 people; the Port Authority said the train came in too fast.

On the morning of September 29, 2016, an NJ Transit train crashed through a stopblock and into the concourse of the station, killing one person and injuring more than 110 people. Tracks 10 through 17 were reopened on October 10, 2016, with most remaining tracks reopened a week later. The pedestrian concourse reopened on May 14, 2017. Track 6 reopened for service in June 2017 and Track 5 reopened for service sometime around September 2018. The planning for permanent repairs to the concourse roof and supports were ongoing during this time. Permanent repairs and renovations began in March 2019 and were completed by the end of 2019.

== Design ==
Hoboken Terminal is considered a milestone in American transportation development, initially combining rail, ferry, subway, streetcar, and pedestrian services, in one of the most innovatively designed and engineered structures in the nation, with bus and light-rail service added in the ensuing decades. The terminal was also one of the first stations in the world to employ the Bush-type train shed, designed by and named for Lincoln Bush of the DL&amp;W, which quickly became ubiquitous in station design. The terminal building was designed by architect Kenneth M. Murchison in the Beaux-Arts style. The structure is made of concrete, copper, stone, steel, and wrought iron. The complex has 14 tracks for NJ Transit trains, which are located entirely above the water.

The station is unusual for a New York City area commuter railroad terminal in that it still has low-level platforms, requiring passengers to use stairs on the train to board and alight. The &quot;Long Slip Fill and Rail Enhancement&quot; project is anticipated to add three high-level accessible-accessible platforms to the south side of the terminal. The project will modify the Long Slip, which is a former barge canal adjacent to the Hoboken Terminal Yard. This is to eliminate it as a conduit for flood water.

The terminal&#x27;s clock tower was designed by architect Kenneth Murchison and originally built with the terminal. Its copper cladding was intended to provide a dramatic decorative effect. By the post-World War II period, this patina had been lost to wind erosion and was removed in about 1950 following a storm. The tower was replaced by a radio tower that stood for more than half a century, until being removed in June 2006, when it was replaced with a new clock tower modeled after the original, down to the same copper cladding, albeit with a more modern steel and aluminum infrastructure. The second tower includes a clock with diameter faces and copper letters, which spell out &quot;LACKAWANNA&quot;, whose fiber optic technology allows them to be lit from dusk to midnight.

The large main waiting room features floral and Greek Revival motifs in tiled stained glass by Louis Comfort Tiffany set atop bands of pale cement. The terminal exterior extends to over four stories and has a copper-clad façade with ornate detailing. It is said the copper used for it is leftover from the Statue of Liberty. Its single-story base is constructed of rusticated Indiana limestone. A grand double stair with decorative cast-iron railings within the main waiting room provides an entrance to the upper-level ferry concourse.
== Services ==
=== Commuter rail ===
Hoboken Terminal is the terminus and namesake for NJ Transit&#x27;s Hoboken Division, which consists of commuter rail lines in northern New Jersey.
* Bergen County Line
* Main Line
* Meadowlands Rail Line (event service)
* Pascack Valley Line
* Montclair-Boonton Line
* Morristown Line and Gladstone Branch of the Morris and Essex Lines
* Port Jervis Line
* Raritan Valley Line (one inbound morning weekday train only)

Access to other NJ Transit rail lines is available at Newark Penn Station (which also serves Amtrak), Secaucus Junction, or Newark Broad Street.

=== Rapid transit ===
PATH trains provide 24-hour service from a three-track underground terminal located north of the surface platforms. Two routes are offered on weekdays during the day, and one route is offered on late nights, weekends, and holidays. Entrances are from the main concourse or street, below the Hudson Place bus station with both an elevator and stairs. Travel to Newark Penn Station always requires a transfer, as does weekday service to Journal Square Transportation Center.

=== Light rail ===
Hoboken Terminal is the terminus for two of the three Hudson-Bergen Light Rail routes. Light rail platforms are located south of Track 18 and the terminal building.

=== Ferry ===

Ferry service is operated by NY Waterway to Brookfield Place Terminal daily, as well as Pier 11/Wall Street and West Midtown Ferry Terminal on weekdays. The ferry concourse has five slips, numbered 1–5. Slips 1 and 5 are generally used for ferries heading to West Midtown, Slip 2 is generally used for Wall Street ferries, and Slip 3 is generally used for Brookfield Place ferries.

=== Bus service ===
Ten routes operated by New Jersey Transit Bus Operations serve Hoboken. Lanes 1-5 are underneath the covered &quot;Hoboken Bus Terminal&quot; adjacent to Track 1, while Lane 6 lies at the curb adjacent to the main commuter rail concourse.

Route departs from Lane 1 for Jersey City, route departs from Lanes 2 and 3 for the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan, and routes depart from Lane 4 for American Dream Meadowlands in East Rutherford or Nungessers. Routes depart from Lane 5 for Weehawken or Union City, and routes departs from Lane 6 for Lakewood, , or Old Bridge.

=== Former named trains ===
== Environs and access ==

Though the passenger facilities are located within Hoboken, large parts of the infrastructure that supports them are located in Jersey City. The Hoboken/Jersey City line cuts across the rail yard at a northwest diagonal from the river to the intersection of Grove Street and Newark Street. It is at this corner that Observer Highway begins running parallel to the tracks and creating a de facto border for Hoboken. Motor vehicle access to the station is extremely limited. At the eastern end of Observer Highway, buses are permitted to enter their terminal. Other vehicles are required to do a dog-leg turn onto Hudson Place. This street (designated CR 736) is the only one with motor vehicle traffic adjacent to the station. In 2009, pedestrian access to the terminal from the south was made possible with the opening of a new segment of the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway.

== In media ==
The station has been used for film shoots, including &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;, &quot;The Station Agent&quot;, &quot;The Curse of the Jade Scorpion&quot;, &quot;Julie &amp; Julia&quot;, &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot;, Rod Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Downtown Train&quot; video (1990) and Eric Clapton&#x27;s video for his 1996 single &quot;Change the World&quot;.

<doc id="984997" wikidata="Q1360069" url="?curid=984997" title="Alfred Domett">
<text>Alfred Domett (20 May 18112 November 1887) was the fourth premier of New Zealand, a close friend of the poet Robert Browning and author of the epic poem &quot;Ranolf and Amohia, a South Sea Day Dream&quot;. Born in England, he emigrated to New Zealand in 1842 and remained there for a further thirty years, holding many significant political posts.

==Early life==
Domett &quot;is said to have been born on 20 May 1811&quot; at Camberwell Grove, Surrey, and records show he was baptised on 4 November 1812 at Bermondsey; the sixth child and fourth son of Nathaniel Domett, a ship-owner. He entered St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, but left the university in 1833. Domett spent 1833 to 1835 travelling in the United States, Canada and the West Indies. Spending the winter of 1833 in Upper Canada, he gained some experience in surveying and conveyancing. Returning to England, he entered at the Middle Temple on 7 November 1835, and was called to the bar on 19 November 1841.

==Emigration to New Zealand==
Domett emigrated to Nelson, New Zealand, on the &quot;Sir Charles Forbes&quot;, departing Gravesend on 1 May 1842 and arriving in Nelson on 22 August with 187 settlers. The following year, a broken leg possibly saved his life as it prevented him from accompanying Captain Arthur Wakefield (1799–1843), the founder of the Nelson settlement and a younger brother of the New Zealand Company&#x27;s principal architect Edward Gibbon Wakefield (1796–1862), to a confrontation with local Māori beside the Wairau River. On 17 June 1843, Wakefield, twenty-one other settlers, and four Maori were killed in the Wairau Affray.

The aftermath of the Wairau incident resulted in the emergence of Domett as a public figure in Nelson. Governor Fitzroy investigated the affray and concluded that while the Māori who killed those who surrendered needed rebuking, the fault actually lay with the New Zealand Company. A public meeting held by angered settlers, asked Domett to take their case to the Colonial Secretary in Auckland where he said that the Company&#x27;s claim to the land had been valid and that Pākehā killed were &quot;innocent victims to Māori savagery&quot;. In response to the Secretary&#x27;s reply that under the Treaty of Waitangi, Te Rauparaha was entitled to deny the sale of the land, Domett rubbished the Treaty, questioned the &quot;rights of the aborigines to land, of the capabilities of what they cannot avail themselves&quot; and suggested that the colonists should gather their forces together and defeat the natives.

He was editor of the &quot;Nelson Examiner&quot; from c. 1843 to 1845 and was again editor, briefly, in 1857. He published a supplement to the paper concerning the Wairau Affray in 1843, and continued to write occasional contributions for that paper. Published in London was a &quot;Petition to Parliament for the recall of Governor Fitzroy, together with a Narrative of the Wairau Massacre. 8vo. 1844–46.&quot; Domett&#x27;s experience of representing the wishes of local settlers in the aftermath of what is now called the Wairau Affray, made him a critic of the policies of Fitzroy, but his &quot;masterly&quot; petition is seen as an even greater criticism of local authorities.

Domett married a widowed schoolteacher, Mrs Mary George of Wellington, on 3 November 1856. She had two sons, John (Johnny) George who joined the Colonial Forces and was killed during Te Kooti&#x27;s War, at the Battle of Te Pōrere near Tongariro, and James George. In his epic poem “Ranolf and Amohia”, Domett speaks of his stepson John as “young, kindly, chivalrous&quot;. Alfred and Mary had a son, Alfred Nelson Domett.

==Publications==
During his tenure as Colonial Secretary of New Munster, which he held from 1848 to 1853, Domett published the extensive &quot;Statistics of the province of New Munster, New Zealand, from 1841 to 1848&quot;, in which he revealed his vision of &quot;a free, secular and compulsory elementary education for the colony&#x27;s children&quot;.

In June 1850 he published &quot;The ordinances of New Zealand passed in the first ten sessions of the General Legislative Council, A.D. 1841 to A.D. 1849&quot;, which had required extensive sorting of ordinances from the 1840s.

In his free time, he devoted himself to completing the poetic epic Ranolf and Amohia, which was published in London in 1872. A small volume of poems appeared in 1877. He continued to adjust Ranolf and Amohia. In 1883, a revised edition of Ranolf and Amohia was printed with the subtitle &quot;A dream of two lives&quot;, indicating the sustained bicultural conception, albeit from a Victorian and British-educated point of view, of this poetic project.

==Poetry==

Domett&#x27;s first volume of poetry was published in 1832. Another book of poems, the &quot;more technically proficient&quot; &quot;Venice&quot;, appeared in 1839. Domett contributed poems to &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, one of which, &quot;A Christmas Hymn&quot;, attracted some attention locally. During the ten years he lived in London, he became the intimate friend of Robert Browning, of whose poem &quot;Waring&quot; he is the subject. In that poem, Browning expresses regret for Domett&#x27;s sudden disappearance from London, and speaks of Domett with emotion: &#x27;How much I loved him, I find out now I&#x27;ve lost him&#x27;. In the poem Browning asks what has become of his friend, but believes he will achieve much in far-off lands:

 ...so I saw the last
 Of Waring! ... Oh, never star
 Was lost here but it rose afar!

An account of the friendship between the two men appeared in &quot;The Contemporary Review&quot; for January 1905, by W. H. Griffin. Thereafter, with the approval of Browning&#x27;s son, Frederic G. Kenyon edited correspondence between and relating to Browning and Domett, after the 1904 auction purchase of the letters by Reginald Smith, head of publishing firm Smith Elder and Co.

The epic &quot;Ranolf and Amohia, a South Sea Day Dream&quot; (1872, new edition 1877), includes details of both European and Māori life, and is by far the best known of his works. &quot;Flotsam and Jetsam&quot; (1877) is dedicated to Browning. He continued to write poetry all his life, in the style of rhyming panegyrics such as An Invitation, with its allusions to the sub-tropical flora and threatened inhabitants of countries such as New Zealand:

 And if weary of mists you will roam undisdaining 
 To a land where the fanciful fountains are raining 
 Swift brilliants of boiling and beautiful spray 
 In the violet splendour of skies that illume 
 Such a wealth of green ferns and rare crimson tree-bloom; 
 Where a people primeval is vanishing fast, 
 With its faiths and its fables and ways of the past: 
 O with reason and fancy unfettered and fearless, 
 Come plunge with us deep into regions of Day—Come away—and away! –

Decadent poet Ernest Dowson was his great-nephew.

==General Assembly Library==
While Ranolf and Amohia has been the object of both critical scrutiny (chiefly for its prolixity), and post-colonialist analysis (of its 19th-century colonialist values), Domett&#x27;s legacy in the literary history of New Zealand was the founding of a library of exceptional scope. Domett&#x27;s involvement in the founding of the General Assembly Library cannot be overestimated. William Gisborne, who later (1881) favoured widening access to non-parliamentarians, described him as the &#x27;father&#x27; of the library. The &quot;Encyclopedia of New Zealand&quot; emphasises his importance in establishing one of the finest libraries of its time, &quot;both in the selection of the collection and in its organisation and classification&quot;, laying foundations &quot;for the successful development of that institution.&quot; Domett is, therefore, a founder not only of the General Assembly Library, but, also of the National Library of New Zealand. In 2008, Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives Margaret Wilson cited the role of the General Assembly Library &quot;in the creation&quot; of that 1965-established institution.

==New Zealand politics==


After immigrating to New Zealand, Domett filled several important administrative posts, Colonial Secretary for New Munster Province in 1848, and secretary for the colony in 1851. During his tenure, he urged &quot;a legislative check to large, speculative land holdings&quot;.

In February 1854, Domett took up the position of Commissioner of Crown lands and resident magistrate in the Ahuriri district of Hawke&#x27;s Bay. During his time in Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Domett played a principal part in naming Napier after General Sir Charles James Napier, GCB (1782–1853), who led the military conquest of Sindh in India in 1843, and the streets of Napier after other men whom he admired in British Indian history and after various poets and literary figures.

In 1855, Nelson residents elected Domett to the House of Representatives and in September 1856, he was appointed commissioner of Crown lands in Nelson.

Thereafter he was the fourth Premier of New Zealand from 1862 to 1863. He represented the electorate of Nelson, first as the &quot;Town of Nelson&quot; 1855–1860 and then &quot;City of Nelson&quot; 1860–1866 (retired). As electorates at this time returned multiple members, Domett shared representation of Nelson with Edward Stafford, who had also served as Premier. Domett was a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council from 19 June 1866 until 3 July 1874, when his membership ceased as he had returned to the country of his birth for his final years.

During his tenure in office, Domett brought about the moving of New Zealand&#x27;s capital from Auckland to Wellington in 1865. In November 1863 he moved a resolution before Parliament that &quot;it has become necessary that the seat of government... should be transferred to some suitable locality in Cook Strait.&quot; His movement was carried, but many reference books and parliamentary papers of the inchoate General Assembly Library (known officially after 1985 as New Zealand Parliamentary Library), were lost in a shipwreck during removal from Auckland to Wellington. 

While Premier during the Waikato war, Domett urged for the confiscation of all lands of Waikato and Taranaki tribes suitable for settlement and took the position that to enforce this would require increased military presence to &quot;cut down the towering notions of savage independence so long nursed by the Maoris&quot;. One biographer suggested that despite advocating for secular education and establishing the General Assembly Library, &quot;[h]is political legacy in New Zealand is mixed...[because of his]... punitive views on the native question and his prosecution of widespread land confiscation&quot;.

Domett became a CMG in 1880.

==Later life and death==
Domett retired in 1871 and he and Mary returned to England. He died in Kensington, close to Central London, on 2 November 1887.

<text>Pterocarya, often called wingnuts in English, are trees in the walnut family Juglandaceae. They are native to Asia. The botanic name is from Ancient Greek (&quot;pteron&quot;) &quot;wing&quot; + (&quot;karyon&quot;) &quot;nut&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Pterocarya&quot; are deciduous trees, 10–40 m tall, with pinnate leaves 20–45 cm long, with 11–25 leaflets; the shoots have chambered pith, a character shared with the walnuts (&quot;Juglans&quot;) but not the hickories (&quot;Carya&quot;) in the same family.

The flowers are organized in male and female catkins in the same tree. Therefore the species is monoecius. The seed catkins when mature (about six months after pollination) are pendulous, 15–45 cm long, with 20–80 seeds strung along them.

The seeds are a small nut 5–10 mm across, with two wings, one each side. In some of the species, the wings are short (5–10 mm) and broad (5–10 mm), in others longer (10–25 mm) and narrower (2–5 mm).

===Species===
There are six species. 
Another species from China, the wheel wingnut with similar foliage but an unusual circular wing right round the nut (instead of two wings at the sides), previously listed as &quot;Pterocarya paliurus&quot;, has now been transferred to a new genus, as &quot;Cyclocarya paliurus&quot;.

===Hybrids===
*&quot;Pterocarya × rehderiana&quot; - (&quot;P. fraxinifolia&quot; × &quot;P. stenoptera&quot;).

===Uses===
Wingnuts are very attractive, large and fast-growing trees, occasionally planted in parks and large gardens. The most common in general cultivation outside Asia is &quot;P. fraxinifolia&quot;, but the most attractive is probably &quot;P. rhoifolia&quot;. The hybrid &quot;P. × rehderiana&quot;, a cross between &quot;P. fraxinifolia&quot; and &quot;P. stenoptera&quot;, is even faster-growing and has occasionally been planted for timber production. The wood is of good quality, similar to walnut, though not quite so dense and strong.

<text>Major General David Lanyon Lloyd Owen, (10 October 1917 – 5 April 2001) was a British soldier and writer. During the Second World War he commanded the Long Range Desert Group.

==Early life and military career==
Born in Hampton, in the county of Middlesex, England, on 10 October 1917, David Lloyd-Owen was the son of Captain Reginald Charles Lloyd-Owen. He was educated at Winchester College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Upon passing out from the latter, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment (West Surrey) on 27 January 1938. He was with the 2nd Battalion of his regiment, then commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Ross, in Palestine during the Arab revolt. Among Lloyd Owen&#x27;s fellow officers in the battalion was Michael Forrester, another future major general. He later served in the Western Desert from 1939 to July 1941, during the Second World War, when he joined the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG).

==Second World War==
Lloyd Owen took part in a number of operations, including the SAS raid on Tobruk in August/September 1942, which earned him the Military Cross. He was wounded in an air raid on the LRDG base at Kufra in October 1942 and nearly lost an arm. He rejoined the LRDG in February 1943, when they underwent training in Lebanon before being sent to the Aegean.

Lloyd Owen took command of the LRDG at the end of 1943 after the death of his predecessor Jake Easonsmith during the Battle of Leros. He based himself at Bari in southern Italy from which he mounted a successful raid on Corfu and staged operations in the Dalmatian islands and Yugoslavia. In September 1944, he was parachuted into Albania at night. Shortly after landing he fell 30 ft into a ravine and severely damaged his spine.

Despite being in continual pain, Lloyd Owen directed special forces operations in the mountains for the next three months. Eventually he was evacuated to Italy, was successfully operated on, and told not to return to his former activities. He managed to bluff his way past a medical board and returned to Albania, although this time by boat. The LRDG was eventually disbanded in June 1945. For his leadership in the Balkans, Lloyd Owen was awarded the Distinguished Service Order that year.

==Post-war==
After the war, Lloyd Owen had various appointments in Britain, including a period on the staff at Sandhurst. In 1952, he was appointed Military Assistant to the High Commissioner in Malaya. He then commanded the 1st Battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment from 1957 to 1959. In the early 1960s he led the 24th Infantry Brigade Group in Kenya and was then, from 1966 to 1968, General Officer Commanding (GOC), Cyprus District. From 1968 to 1969 he was GOC, Near East Land Forces and, from 1969 to 1972, president of the Regular Commissions Board. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1954 and Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1971.

Lloyd Owen wrote two books about his experiences – &quot;The Desert My Dwelling Place&quot; published by Cassell in 1957 and again by Panther Books the following year, and later &quot;Long Range Desert Group 1940–1945: Providence Their Guide&quot;, republished by Leo Cooper/Pen and Sword Books in 2001.

==Personal life==
Lloyd Owen married Ursula Barclay (known as Ursie) and had three sons; Michael, Piers and Christopher.

<text>The New Zealand grebe (Poliocephalus rufopectus), also known as the New Zealand dabchick or weweia, is a member of the grebe family endemic to New Zealand.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Poliocephalus rufopectus&quot; is an aquatic diving bird in the grebe order.

&quot;Poliocephalus rufopectus&quot; (G.R.Gray) was originally described by the English ornithologist George Robert Gray as &quot;Podiceps rufopectus&quot; G.R.Gray, 1843 (in subgenus &quot;Poliocephalus&quot;). The type specimen was collected by British botanist and scientific collector Andrew Sinclair in New Zealand. &quot;P. rufopectus&quot; is one of two species in the genus &quot;Poliocephalus,&quot; with the other being the hoary-headed grebe (&quot;Poliocephalus poliocephalus&quot;) which is native to Australia.

== Description ==
The New Zealand grebe has dark brown plumage, a small black head with fine silver feathers, a black pointed bill and characteristic yellow eyes. It grows to about , and weighs about . Non-breeding individuals have a paler plumage and females tend to be a bit lighter, smaller and have a slightly shorter bill than males.

== Distribution and habitat ==
This grebe species inhabits mainly shallow freshwater lakes, ponds and sheltered inlets.
Currently it is found mainly in the North Island, where it is well distributed on the coastal lakes of the West coast from North Cape to Pukekohe and from Taranaki to Paraparaumu, as well as on ponds of the Volcanic Plateau, Gisborne, Hawkes Bay and the Wairarapa. 
Formerly this species was also present in the lowland lakes of the South Island, but underwent a rapid decline, for unknown reasons, in the 19th century – the last regular breeding record in the South Island was in 1941. In 2012 a pair bred near Takaka for the first time in recent history.

== Behaviour ==
These freshwater diving birds usually fly only at night, whilst during the day, they are always found in the water, swimming on the surface and frequently diving to feed. Thus, if they are in danger or get disturbed at daytime they do not flee by flying, but swimming or diving away. During autumn and winter, they are found forming flocks, while during the breeding season they are mostly seen in monogamous pairs. They show aggressive territorial behaviour towards intruders and the otherwise silent species give short calls throughout the breeding season and when in danger.

== Diet ==

Their diet consists mostly of aquatic insects and their larvae, as well as small molluscs such as freshwater snails. Bigger prey such as fish and freshwater crayfish are sometimes eaten too. Thus, their bill, being short and pointed, is adapted to their mainly invertebrate diet. They catch their prey during dives and feeding underwater or pick it from the water surface.

== Breeding ==
The breeding season is from June to March. On average 2–3 eggs are laid and incubated 22–23 days by both female and male, in a nest. The nest is mostly made out of surrounding vegetation, including floating plant material. Hatched chicks are precocial, although being flightless for the first few weeks they can swim and dive. Both parents assist in rearing and feeding their young for up to 70 days after hatching. Until the adult plumage develops, the chick has irregular striped markings on head and neck and the bill is black.

== Conservation ==
This species is endemic to New Zealand and is nowadays only found in the North Island. In 1994, the IUCN classified the New Zealand grebe as Endangered, but due to conservation actions including habitat management, its population has recently increased to around 1,900–2,000 birds and was reclassified as Near Threatened in 2016, and to least concern in 2022. Human activity currently has a net benefit as artificial habitat, including farm dams and ponds formed for stock water supplies, increases the area of occupation for the grebes. So, although the population is still quite small it is thought not to be in decline anymore.

<doc id="985021" wikidata="Q7611940" url="?curid=985021" title="Steve Berra">
<text>Steve Berra (born May 10, 1973) is an American professional skateboarder and director, and is also the cofounder/co-owner of the skateboarding website The Berrics.

==Early life==
Berra grew up in both Nebraska and Missouri and he explained in 2007 that his family was poor: &quot;I was considered poor when I was growing up. I didn&#x27;t have a phone.&quot; Berra was bullied at school for skateboarding and struggled as a student, with Berra stating that he &quot;was the kid who everybody assumed was a complete lost cause.&quot; It was at the age of 14 years that the isolated Berra, who had a small number of friends at the time, decided that a professional skateboarding career was his aspiration.

==Skateboarding career==
In pursuit of his skateboarding career, Berra relocated to southern California, US when he was 18 years old and lived with skateboarding legend Tony Hawk. Hawk provided guidance to Berra regarding the skateboarding industry and advised, &quot;You have to look at skating as fun. But it&#x27;s not a career,&quot; due to the subculture&#x27;s marginal status at the time.

Berra&#x27;s first sponsor was Blockhead, which led to his experience with the &quot;Blockhead House&quot;, where he met fellow skateboarder Jason Dill. He then moved onto the 101 skateboard brand, owned by Natas Kaupas, and he has since stated that &quot;I didn&#x27;t have a good time on 101&quot;. Before Kaupas could assign Berra the status of a &quot;professional&quot; team rider, Berra quit 101 and joined Tony Hawk&#x27;s Birdhouse company. While with Birdhouse, the 23-year-old Hawk was a mentor figure to Berra, leading to Berra&#x27;s initial forays into acting. In 1992, Berra left Birdhouse and since admitted that his departure was due to being &quot;young, misunderstood, and silly&quot;. Several months later, Berra joined the Foundation team, skating in the company&#x27;s 1993 video &quot;Super Conductor Super Collider&quot;.

In 1998 Berra returned to Birdhouse to create the skateboarding video &quot;The End&quot;. In one of the notable scenes in the movie, Berra&#x27;s death is simulated in a decapitation scene (filmed with the aid of a dummy).

Shortly after the release of &quot;The End&quot; Berra once again left Birdhouse and joined Alien Workshop, alongside Dill and professionals such as Josh Kalis and Rob Dyrdek.

In 2003 Berra struggled with severe ankle pain that prevented him from skating for most of the year and he underwent reconstructive surgery in January 2004. Footage of Berra entering ankle surgery is featured in the DVS Shoes (formerly DVS Shoe Co.) video, &quot;Skate More&quot;, a production that he managed to film a full part for.

Berra has been featured in MTV shows &quot;Rob &amp; Big&quot; and &quot;Rob Dyrdek&#x27;s Fantasy Factory&quot;. Season 2, Episode 6 of &quot;Rob &amp; Big&quot; revolves around the Tampa Pro professional skateboarding contest, whereby Berra and Dyrdek engage in a US$5,000 bet to &quot;up the ante&quot; of the competition. In Season 2, Episode 8 of &quot;Rob Dyrdek&#x27;s Fantasy Factory&quot;, entitled &quot;The Berrics vs. Fantasy Factory&quot;, Dyrdek&#x27;s Fantasy Factory skate park crew competes against The Berrics crew.

As of 2013, Berra regularly appears on the website venture The Berrics that is co-owned with professional skateboarder Eric Koston. As of March 2013, Berra is no longer a member of the Alien Workshop team and his sponsors are DC Shoes, Grizzly Griptape, Skullcandy, and The Berrics.

==The Berrics==
The Berrics concept was primarily conceived by Berra, who enlisted close friend, Koston, to invest in the premises that contains the training facility. Located in Los Angeles, U.S., the facility&#x27;s name is an amalgamation of the pair&#x27;s individual names: Berra + Eric = Berrics. In 2009, skateboarding journalist, Chris Nieratko, gained entrance to the skate park and its cardinal rule: &quot;You have to film while you&#x27;re skating The Berrics.&quot; The footage is later posted on The Berrics website, TheBerrics.com. TheBerrics.com grew to become one of skateboarding&#x27;s most popular websites in only several months: &quot;In January, the site had more unique visitors than sites for all of the major skateboarding magazines, and ESPN.com&#x27;s action sports page, according to comScore, a market research firm.&quot;

The website features a range of weekly, regular, and special features, including &quot;Weekendtage&quot;, &quot;Bangin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Battle at the Berrics&quot;, &quot;Field Ops&quot;, and &quot;Off the Grid&quot;. Berra has also used the website to feature colleagues and friends from the fields of film, advertising, and music.

==Perspectives on skateboarding==
Berra is well known for his public opinions on skateboarding, and in a February 2013 interview with &quot;Jenkem&quot; magazine he explained his view on the status of the skateboarding industry at the commencement of the second decade of the 21st century:

The economy is a huge challenge. There is only so much money in our industry and it is a very, very, very small industry. Skateboarding may mean everything to you and I and whoever is reading this but we are a small industry with a few examples of companies that have breached into the &quot;real&quot; world and sometimes give us the impression that we are bigger than what we are. There is a vast difference between the sales of Element and the sales of Expedition. The Berrics obstacles have been trying to get people to understand that things have changed, the world has changed, the skater and the consumer have changed. So… it was either we start it, Eric and I, or Google does.

Berra also explained the manner in which the industry is often misperceived and how the economic conditions in the U.S.—at the time of the &quot;Jenkem&quot; interview—have affected the culture of skateboarding:

We&#x27;re all squirrels fighting for the same nuts in the worst economy in 100 years and everyone has it tough right now. I don&#x27;t think people outside the industry understand that. I think a lot of these people who criticize the industry definitely don&#x27;t understand that. They see these pillars of the skateboarding world and they equate them to the pillars of other worlds that are much bigger than ours not knowing that some are one bad month from closing their doors. Skateboarding companies are skin and bones operations. Popularity does not mean wealth in this industry.

==Directing==
In the winter of 2006, Berra began his role as director of &quot;The Good Life&quot;, a film that he also wrote the screenplay for. Starring Mark Webber, Zooey Deschanel, Bill Paxton, Harry Dean Stanton, Chris Klein, Patrick Fugit, Drea de Matteo and Donal Logue, &quot;The Good Life&quot; was described by Berra in the following manner: &quot;... it had been my ‘other woman’ for many years, but because of my commitments as a professional skateboarder I couldn&#x27;t pursue it 100%.&quot; The film, described as &quot;a coming-of-age tale set in Lincoln, Nebraska, portrayed as a grim town of vacant lots, shuttered buildings, sidewalk drug dealers and deep poverty, all accented by overcast skies&quot;, premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and garnered a positive reception.

Following the commencement of a new chapter of the Berrics project in early 2013, whereby a new premises was officially opened and the website was reconstructed, Berra has collaborated with professional skateboarder Paul Rodriguez on numerous projects, such as the Network A series &quot;LIFE&quot; and a Mountain Dew commercial entitled &quot;Progression&quot;.

==Acting==
Berra has maintained an interest in acting since the age of 18. He was a series regular on the short-lived Fox drama &quot;413 Hope St.&quot;, portraying Quentin Jefferson, a young man infected with HIV. Berra has also held brief roles in the television shows &quot;Felicity&quot; and &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;, as well as a minor role in the 1999 film &quot;Anywhere but Here&quot;.

Since the age of 18, Berra has juggled his interests in skateboarding and acting, although he maintains that skateboarding has always been his primary passion.

==Personal life==
Prior to the launch of the Berrics website, Berra explained the impact of Scientology upon his life:

Well, it&#x27;s just helped me as an individual. I understand life much better and when you understand life, you have an easier time understanding other aspects of it, skateboarding included. I don&#x27;t claim to be perfect, far from it in fact, but I at least have the self awareness to know that and see upon where I can improve, see where I&#x27;ve been the architect of my doom. Scientology has enabled me to really look at who I am, what I am doing and put myself in check if it I get too crazed. The best way I can further help people understand it is by telling them to actually go and buy a book. It&#x27;s what I did.

As of August 15, 2013, Berra has not been filmed with his two children on the Berrics, or any other media, but he responded to a fatherhood question in 2009 in the following manner:

It&#x27;s tough [being a father] sometimes because you go through a lot of heartbreak as a kid and then when you think you&#x27;ve grown out of it, you have a child of your own and you go through it all over again. You also have expectations that are sometimes unrealistic, you have heartache with them not liking you, you have heartache as a result of their heartache, but on the flipside you have this indescribable joy and connection with another person that you just don&#x27;t have with anyone else and you have a real sense of achievement and pride when they turn out to be an extraordinary individual.

Steve Berra claims to have never drunk alcohol, smoked cigarettes or taken other recreational drugs.

<doc id="985025" wikidata="Q5498292" url="?curid=985025" title="Frederick Locker-Lampson">
<text>Frederick Locker-Lampson (May 29, 1821 – May 30, 1895) was an English man of letters, bibliophile and poet.

== Overview ==
He was born at Greenwich Hospital. His father, who was Civil Commissioner of the Hospital, was Edward Hawke Locker, youngest son of the Captain William Locker who gave Nelson the memorable advice &quot;to lay a Frenchman close, and you will beat him.&quot; His mother, Eleanor Mary Elizabeth Boucher, was a daughter of the Revd. Jonathan Boucher, vicar of Epsom and friend of George Washington.

After a desultory education, Frederick Locker began life in a colonial broker&#x27;s office. Soon he obtained a clerkship in Somerset House, whence he was transferred to Lord Haddington&#x27;s private office at the Admiralty. Here he became deputy-reader and precis writer. In 1850 he married Lady Charlotte Bruce, daughter of the Lord Elgin who brought the famous marbles to England, and sister of Lady Augusta Stanley. After his marriage he left the Civil Service, in consequence of ill-health.

In 1857 he published &quot;London Lyrics&quot;, a slender volume of 90 pages, which, with subsequent extensions, constitutes his poetical legacy. &quot;Lyra Elegantiarum&quot; (1867), an anthology of light and familiar verse, and &quot;Patchwork&quot; (1879), a book of extracts, were his only other publications in his lifetime.

In 1872 Lady Charlotte Locker died. Two years later Locker married Miss Hannah Jane Lampson, the only daughter of Sir Curtis Miranda Lampson, Bart., of Rowfant House, Sussex, and in 1885 he added his wife&#x27;s surname to his own to form a new family surname, Locker-Lampson. He died at Rowfant on 30 May 1895 and is buried in Worth churchyard near Crawley, Sussex.

He had five children: Eleanor by his first wife, and Godfrey, Dorothy, Oliver and Maud by his second. Eleanor married first Lionel Tennyson, younger son of the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson, and after his death married the writer and Liberal politician Augustine Birrell.

== Literary and bibliophilic legacy ==
Chronic ill-health debarred Locker from any active part in life, but it did not prevent his delighting a wide circle of friends by his gifts as a host and raconteur, and from accumulating many treasures as a connoisseur. He was acquainted with practically all the major literary figures of the age, including Matthew Arnold, the Brownings, Carlyle, Dickens, George Eliot, Leigh Hunt, Ruskin, Tennyson, Thackeray and Trollope. He was also a mentor to the illustrator artists Randolph Caldecott and Kate Greenaway.

He was a noted bibliophile and one of the foremost exponents of the &quot;Cabinet&quot; style of book collecting. He catalogued his own collection of rare books, first editions, prints and manuscripts in a volume named after his family home in Sussex, the &quot;Rowfant Library&quot; (1886). An &quot;Appendix&quot; compiled by his elder son, Godfrey, was published in 1900. The Rowfant Club, a Cleveland-based society of book collectors, is named after his home.

As a poet, Locker belongs to the choir who deal with the gay rather than the grave in verse, with the polished and witty rather than the lofty or emotional. His good taste kept him as far from the broadly comic on the one side as his kind heart saved him from the purely cynical on the other. To something of Prior, of Praed and of Hood he added qualities of his own which lent his work distinction in no wise diminished by his unwearied endeavour after directness and simplicity.

== Biographies ==
A posthumous volume of his memoirs, entitled &quot;My Confidences&quot;, appeared in 1896. In &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; (1902) William James wrote of the &#x27;amiable&#x27; personality shown in this book: &quot;This is a complex, a tender, a submissive, and graceful state of mind. For myself, I should have no objection to calling it on the whole a religious state of mind, although I dare say that to many of you it may seem too listless and half-hearted to merit so good a name.&quot;
&quot;Frederick Locker-Lampson: A Character Sketch&quot;, which includes a selection of his letters, was composed and edited by his son-in-law, Augustine Birrell in 1920. This gives an interesting idea of his personality and literary connections as well as notes on his book collection.

<doc id="985026" wikidata="Q2363568" url="?curid=985026" title="Popski's Private Army">
<text>Popski&#x27;s Private Army, officially No. 1 Demolition Squadron, PPA, was a unit of British Special Forces set up in Cairo in October 1942 by Major Vladimir Peniakoff who was a Belgian Jewish officer of Russian extraction. Popski&#x27;s Private Army was one of several raiding units formed in the Western Desert during the Second World War. The squadron also served in Italy, and was disbanded in September 1945.

No. 1 Demolition Squadron was formed specifically to attack Field Marshal Rommel&#x27;s fuel supplies, in support of General Montgomery’s offensive at El Alamein, at the suggestion of Lieutenant-Colonel John Hackett. The unit became operational on 10 December 1942 as an 8th Army Special Forces unit. After the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) and the Special Air Service (SAS), PPA was the last and smallest of the three main irregular raiding, reconnaissance, and intelligence units formed during the North African Campaign.

Actor Christopher Lee, who served as an RAF intelligence officer during the Second World War was attached as liaison officer to this unit.

== Background ==
When the Second World War broke out, the 42-year-old Peniakoff applied to serve in the Royal Air Force, and the Royal Navy, but was rejected. He was accepted by the British Army, and assigned to garrison duties as an Arabic-speaking junior officer in the Libyan Arab Force (LAF). Not satisfied, Popski left his post and formed the Libyan Arab Force Commando (LAFC), a small group of British and Libyan soldiers who operated behind the lines in the Jebel Akhdar area of Cyrenaica.

On his return to Cairo in the middle of 1942, Peniakoff was invited to join a Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) raid in the area he had just left. In doing so, he learned much about German and Italian procedures, but also lost his left little finger to an Italian bullet. He was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for his previous intelligence reporting and petrol dump raiding while leading the LAFC for three months behind enemy lines, and for the operation with the LRDG. While he was away, the LAFC was disbanded. He was given the nickname &quot;Popski&quot;, from a &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; cartoon character, by Captain Bill Kennedy Shaw (the LRDG&#x27;s Intelligence Officer) because his signallers had problems with the name &quot;Peniakoff.&quot; In fact, Popski was born of Russian Jewish parents who had emigrated to Belgium, although he was educated in Britain; Willet&#x27;s book on Popski includes many interviews with his Jewish family.

==Formation, and initial actions==

Shortly after this No. 1 Demolition Squadron was formed, the smallest independent unit of the British Army at 23 men all-ranks. The original officers of the unit were three friends who had served together in the Libyan Arab Force: Popski, Robert Park Yunnie and Jean Caneri.

Lieutenant Colonel John Hackett, who co-ordinated British raiding operations, asked Peniakoff to give the new unit a cover name, but vacillated. The unit&#x27;s name ultimately came from Hackett&#x27;s exasperation at Popski&#x27;s delay: &quot;You had better find a name quick or we shall call you Popski&#x27;s Private Army&quot;—&quot;I&#x27;ll take it&quot;.
PPA was unusual in that all officer recruits reverted to lieutenant on joining, and other ranks reverted to private. The unit was run quite informally: there was no saluting and no drill, officers and men messed together, every man was expected to know what to do and get on with it, and there was only one punishment for failure of any kind: to be immediately returned to unit. It was also efficient, having an unusually small headquarters.

Events proceeded rapidly; the Germans and Italians were expelled from Egypt and Libya shortly after PPA became active. A joint LRDG-PPA patrol discovered the gap in the mountains that let Bernard Montgomery launch an outflanking move around Erwin Rommel&#x27;s defense at the Mareth Line. The PPA was also among the first elements of Eighth Army (moving west) to link up with the British First Army and American II Corps (advancing east) in Tunisia in early 1943. Many PPA raiding and reconnaissance operations were carried out around the time of the Battle of Kasserine Pass, including taking the surrender of 600 Italians.

The summer of 1943 was spent in Algeria and Tunisia recruiting and training new volunteers from the LRDG, SAS, Commandos and Royal Armoured Corps for the fight in Italy, bringing the unit&#x27;s size up to about 35 all ranks, with two fighting patrols and a small HQ. For a short while PPA experimented with using 1st Airborne Division&#x27;s gliders to deliver them and their jeeps behind the Axis lines in Sicily, but their part in that operation was cancelled at the last minute.

==Italy==
In September 1943 an advance patrol of PPA sailed to Taranto on board the and headed inland, where they discovered the hitherto unknown weakness of the German 1st Parachute Division opposing 1st Airborne. As a result of this success Popski was allowed to increase the size of PPA to 80 all ranks; throughout the Italian Campaign about 100 men were actually deployed at any one time.

Three fighting patrols, each of 18 men in six jeeps, and one Tactical HQ patrol of four jeeps were formed and given great autonomy. Each jeep was armed with .50in and .30in machine guns, giving the patrols immense firepower for their size. The men trained hard for amphibious, mountain and parachute operations, demolition and counter-demolition, reconnaissance and intelligence gathering.

They were deployed in many roles, often clandestine, and for several months even operated as regular front line troops, holding a sector of the Allied front line, badly depleted after the withdrawal of forces for the D-Day landings in Normandy, nipping around in their jeeps to fool the Germans into believing that they were opposed by much larger units.

Several operations used DUKWs or small landing craft called RCLs (manned by 7 Royal Engineers who became known as &quot;Popski’s Private Navy&quot;) with sapper John Francis Dobinson to sail up the Adriatic and get behind the German front line, escorted by the Royal Navy’s Coastal Forces.

Throughout the bitter winter weather and fighting of 1944 and 1945 PPA undertook their operations ahead of regular forces, in support of British, Canadian, Indian and Polish armoured, infantry and commando units. They located targets for the Allied Air Force, chased Germans out of rear-areas, saved bridges, captured many prisoners and guns, and accepted the surrender of the entire German garrison at Chioggia.

At various times PPA worked alongside other secret units such as the LRDG, SAS, No. 1 Special Force (SOE), Phantom, ‘A’ Force and Office of Strategic Services. Along the way they adopted many strays, including Russian, Italian and German POWs, Italian regulars and partisans, both royalist and communist.

Popski was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in November 1944, during joint operations (such as “Porterforce”) with the 27th Lancers and Italian partisans of the 28th Garibaldi Brigade, to liberate Ravenna. Shortly afterwards he lost his left hand to a German rifle-grenade.

At the end of the war Popski’s Private Army sailed some of their jeeps on RCLs to Venice, where they drove around St. Mark&#x27;s Square, the only wheeled vehicles ever to have been there. The unit was disbanded four months later on 14 September 1945, after hunting for Himmler, disarming Italian partisans and discouraging Josip Broz Tito’s partisans from encroaching on Austrian and Italian territory.

By this time PPA personnel had gained between them a DSO, a Distinguished Conduct Medal, 6 MCs, 10 MMs, and 14 Mentions in Despatches; King George VI had personally requested an account of the unit’s exploits.

<doc id="985028" wikidata="Q7758020" url="?curid=985028" title="The Prayer of Jabez">
<text>The Prayer of Jabez: Breaking Through to the Blessed Life is a book by Bruce Wilkinson published in 2000 by Multnomah Books as the first book in the &quot;BreakThrough&quot; book series. It is based on the Old Testament passage 1 Chronicles 4:9–10:

In the book, Wilkinson encourages Christians to invoke this prayer for themselves on a daily basis:

The book became an international bestseller, topping the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list and selling over nine million copies by 2002.

The book has also been criticized and compared to the prosperity gospel.

== Background, popularity, and impact ==
Wilkinson, a pastor, had preached sermons on the topic and in 2000 asked Multnomah Books to publish his pocket-sized &quot;Prayer of Jabez&quot; prior to the National Day of Prayer. The book sold a record eight million copies in its first year of publication and was the bestselling nonfiction book of 2001. It was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller List for 94 weeks. &quot;The Prayer of Jabez&quot; received the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association Gold Medallion Book of the Year award in 2001.

The prayer, after being popularized by the book, &quot;found its way into...House committee hearings on Capital Hill&quot; by 2001. Wilkinson was invited to the National Day of Prayer by President George W. Bush the same year.

==Derivative works and merchandise==
The popularity of the original book has led its publisher, Multnomah Press, to extend the line to a number of derivative works targeted at niche audiences, as well as to offer the books in audio and video formats. They also authorized a wide array of official &quot;Prayer of Jabez&quot; merchandise including key chains, mugs, backpacks, Christmas ornaments, scented candles, mouse pads and a framed artist&#x27;s conception of Jabez himself. A line of jewelry was introduced in 2002.

*A musical companion, &quot;The Prayer of Jabez Music ... A Worship Experience&quot; (ForeFront Records)
*&quot;The Healing of Jabez&quot; by John W. Mauck (Credo House Publishers, ) was published in 2009.

==Criticism==

&quot;Jabez&quot;&#x27;s approach has been critiqued by both Christian and secular media. Some Christian critiques have compared it to the Pentecostal prosperity gospel, and state that it suggests that God will obey people&#x27;s wishes. Critics including &quot;Forbes&quot; and &quot;The Christian Century&quot; have made references to Santa Claus, commenting on the book&#x27;s apparent &quot;Santa-fication of God&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Newsweek&quot; argued Wilkinson &quot;has turned this prayer into a Christian mantra&quot;.

Some, such as evangelical author Berit Kjos, have taken issue with the form of the prayer, citing Jesus&#x27; admonition against &quot;vain repetitions&quot; in . 

The Prayer of Jabez became very popular within sections of the fundamentalist Pentecostal Christian movement, particularly in churches associated with the New Apostolic Reformation, Kingdom Now theology, Dominion theology, Five-fold ministry thinking and other parts of the Spirit-filled Christianity movement.

The concept was critiqued by &quot;The Christian Century&quot; as &quot;markedly individualistic and insulating&quot;. A 2001 review in &quot;The&quot; &quot;New Republic&quot; referred to the book as &quot;in many ways, the ultimate anti-self-help book&quot; in that it encourages readers to rely entirely on God as there is &quot;&quot;no&quot; inner power or strength that we must struggle to tap.&quot;

Several works critiquing the Prayer of Jabez have been released. &quot;The Mantra of Jabez: A Christian Parody&quot; by Douglas M. Jones (Canon Press, ) was published in 2001. &quot;The Cult of Jabez... and the falling away of the church in America&quot;, a book alleging an unbiblical premise of Wilkinson&#x27;s book, reached as high as number 77 on Amazon&#x27;s top 100 books list in 2002. &quot;The Jabez you Never Knew: Hebraic Keys to Answered Prayers&quot;, by Norm Franz, was written to give a historic perspective on the account of Jabez, and to criticize the original work for its emphasis on rote prayer. The recording artist Derek Webb said that his controversial song &quot;Wedding Dress&quot; was written after he saw Wilkinson speak about &quot;The Prayer of Jabez&quot;. The Ceili Rain satirical song &quot;Gold God&quot; takes issue with this concept (if not the book) as well, noting the God who &quot;expanded my territory&quot; is &quot;like a Visa card&quot;.

<text>Page One Records, established in 1966, was the UK independent record label, owned by the producer/manager, Larry Page.

They were involved in a court case in July 1967 with The Troggs.

The label, which was co-founded by Page and Dick James, released hits from The Troggs, Vanity Fare and Plastic Penny, as well as numerous failed attempts by Page himself to obtain his own hit record. In the US, the label was distributed by Bell Records.

As the label faded, Page went on to found Penny Farthing Records.

<text>Sergey Gennadiyevich Nechayev (; – ) was a Russian anarcho-communist, part of the Russian nihilist movement, known for his single-minded pursuit of revolution by any means necessary, including revolutionary terror.

Nechayev fled Russia in 1869 after having been involved in the , who disagreed with some actions of Nechayervites. Complicated relationships with fellow revolutionaries caused him to be expelled from the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association. Arrested in Switzerland in 1872, he was extradited back to Russia where he received a twenty-year sentence and died in prison.

== Early life in Russia ==

Nechayev was born in Ivanovo, then a small textile town, to poor parents—his father was a waiter and sign painter. His mother died when he was eight. His father remarried and had two more sons. They lived in a three-room house with his two sisters and grandparents. They were ex-serfs who had moved to Ivanovo. He had already developed an awareness of social inequality and a resentment of the local nobility in his youth. At the age of 10, he had learned his father&#x27;s trades—waiting at banquets and painting signs. His father got him a job as an errand boy in a factory, but he refused the servant&#x27;s job. His family paid for good tutors who taught him Latin, German, French, history, mathematics and rhetoric.
Aged 18, Nechayev moved to Moscow, where he worked for the historian Mikhael Pogodin. A year later, he moved to Saint Petersburg, passed a teacher&#x27;s exam and began teaching at a parish school. From September 1868, Nechayev attended lectures at the Saint Petersburg University as an auditor (he was never enrolled) and became acquainted with the subversive Russian literature of the Decembrists, the Petrashevsky Circle and Mikhail Bakunin among others as well as the growing student unrest at the university. Nechaev was even said to have slept on bare wood and lived on black bread in imitation of Rakhmetov, the ascetic revolutionary in Nikolay Chernyshevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;What Is to Be Done?&quot;.

Inspired by the failed attempt on the Tsar&#x27;s life by Dmitry Karakozov, Nechayev participated in student activism in 1868–1869, leading a radical minority with Pyotr Tkachev and others. Nechayev took part in devising this student movement&#x27;s &quot;Program of revolutionary activities&quot; which stated later a social revolution as its ultimate goal. The program also suggested ways for creating a revolutionary organization and conducting subversive activities. In particular, the program envisioned composition of the &quot;Catechism of a Revolutionary&quot;, for which Nechayev would become famous.

In December 1868, Nechayev met Vera Zasulich (who would make an assassination attempt on General Fyodor Trepov, governor of Saint Petersburg in 1878) at a teachers&#x27; meeting. He asked her to come to his school where he held candlelit readings of revolutionary tracts. He would place pictures of Maximilien Robespierre and Louis Antoine de Saint-Just on the table while reading. At these meetings, he plotted to assassinate Tsar Alexander II on the 9th anniversary of serfdom&#x27;s abolition. The last of these student meetings occurred on 28 January 1869, where Nechayev presented a petition calling for freedom of assembly for students.

== Geneva exiles ==
In January 1869, Nechayev spread false rumors of his arrest in Saint Petersburg, then left for Moscow before heading abroad. He tried to get Vera Zasulich to emigrate with him by declaring love for her, but she refused. He sent her a letter claiming to have been arrested. In Geneva, Switzerland, he pretended to be a representative of a revolutionary committee who had fled from the Peter and Paul Fortress and won the confidence of revolutionary-in-exile Mikhail Bakunin (who called him &quot;my boy&quot;) and his friend and collaborator Nikolai Ogarev. Bakunin saw in Nechayev the authentic voice of Russian youth which he regarded as &quot;the most revolutionary in the world&quot;.

Nechayev, Bakunin and Ogarev organized a propaganda campaign of subversive material to be sent to Russia, financed by Ogarev from the so-called Bakhmetiev Fund which had been intended for subsidizing their own revolutionary activities. Alexander Herzen disliked Nechayev&#x27;s fanaticism and strongly opposed the campaign, believing Nechayev was influencing Bakunin toward more extreme rhetoric. However, Herzen relented to hand over much of the fund to Nechayev which he was to take to Russia to mobilise support for the revolution. Nechayev had a list of 387 people who were sent 560 parcels of leaflets for distribution April–August 1869. The idea was that the activists would be caught, punished and radicalized. Amongst these people was Zasulich, who got five years exile because of a crudely coded letter sent by Nechayev.

== &quot;Catechism of a Revolutionary&quot; ==
In late spring 1869, Nechayev wrote the &quot;Catechism of a Revolutionary&quot;, a program for the &quot;merciless destruction&quot; of society and the state. The main principle of the revolutionary catechism—the ends justify the means—became Nechayev&#x27;s slogan throughout his revolutionary career. He saw ruthless immorality in the pursuit of total control by church and the state and believed that the struggle against them must therefore be carried out by any means necessary, with an unwavering focus on their destruction. The individual self is to be subsumed by a greater purpose in a kind of spiritual asceticism which for Nechayev was far more than just a theory, but the guiding principle by which he lived his life, claiming: 

The book was to influence generations of radicals and was re-published by the Black Panther Party in 1969, one hundred years after its original publication. It also influenced the formation of the militant Red Brigades in Italy the same year.

== Return to Russia ==
Having left Russia illegally, Nechayev had to sneak back to Moscow via Romania in August 1869 with help from Bakunin&#x27;s underground contacts. On the way, he met Hristo Botev, a Bulgarian revolutionary. In Moscow, he lived an austere life, spending the fund only on political activities. He pretended to be a proxy of the Russian department of the Worldwide Revolutionary Union which did not exist and created an of a secret society called People&#x27;s Reprisal Society () which issued the magazine &quot;People&#x27;s Reprisal&quot; (). He claimed that the society had existed for quite some time in every corner of Russia. He spoke passionately to student dissidents about the need to organise. Marxist writer Vera Zasulich (whose sister Alexandra sheltered him in Moscow) recalls that when she first met Nechayev, he immediately tried to recruit her, telling her about his plans:
:I felt terrible: it was really painful for me to say &quot;That&#x27;s unlikely...,&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t know about that...&quot; I could see that he was very serious, that this was no idle chatter about revolution. He could and would act – wasn&#x27;t he the ringleader of the students?... I could imagine no greater pleasure than serving the revolution. I had dared only to dream of it, and yet now he was saying that he wanted to recruit me, that otherwise he wouldn&#x27;t have thought of saying anything... And what did I know of &quot;the people&quot;? I knew only the house serfs of Biakolovo and the members of my weaving collective, while he was himself a worker by birth.

Many were impressed by the young proletarian and joined the group. However, the already fanatical Nechayev appeared to be becoming more distrustful of the people around him, even denouncing Bakunin as doctrinaire, &quot;idly running off at the mouth and on paper&quot;. One &quot;Narodnaya Rasprava&quot; member, I. I. Ivanov, disagreed with Nechayev about the distribution of propaganda and left the group. On 21 November 1869, Nechayev and several comrades beat, strangled and shot Ivanov, hiding the body in a lake through a hole in the ice.

The body was soon found and some of his colleagues arrested, but Nechayev eluded capture and in late November left for Saint Petersburg, where he tried to continue his activities to create a clandestine society. On 15 December 1869, he fled the country, heading back to Geneva. This incident was fictionalised by writer Fyodor Dostoevsky in his anti-nihilistic novel &quot;Demons&quot; (published three years later) in which the character Pyotr Stepanovich Verkhovensky is based on Nechayev.

== Downfall ==
Bakunin and Ogarev embraced Nechayev on his return to Switzerland in January 1870, with Bakunin writing: &quot;I so jumped for joy that I nearly smashed the ceiling with my old head!&quot;. Soon after their reunion, Herzen died (21 January 1870) and a large fund from his personal wealth became available to Nechayev to continue his political activities. Nechayev issued a number of proclamations aimed at different strata of the Russian population. Together with Ogarev, he published the &quot;Kolokol&quot; magazine (April–May, 1870, issues 1 to 6). In his article &quot;The Fundamentals of the Future Social System&quot; (&quot;Glavnyye osnovy budushchego obshchestvennogo stroya&quot;), published in the &quot;People&#x27;s Reprisal&quot; (1870, no. 2), Nechayev shared his vision of a socialist system which Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels would later term barracks communism.

Nechayev&#x27;s suspicion of his comrades had grown even greater, and he began stealing letters and private papers with which to blackmail Bakunin and his fellow exiles should the need arise. He enlisted the help of Herzen&#x27;s daughter Natalie. While not clearly breaking with Nechayev, Bakunin rebuked Nechayev upon discovery of his duplicity, saying: &quot;Lies, cunning [and] entanglement [are] a necessary and marvelous means for demoralising and destroying the enemy, though &quot;certainly not&quot; a useful means of obtaining and attracting new friends&quot;. Bakunin then threatened Nechayev with breaking relations with him, writing:

The General Council of the foremost left-wing organisation, the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association of 1864–1876, officially dissociated themselves from Nechayev, claiming he had abused the name of the organisation. After writing a letter to a publisher on Bakunin&#x27;s behalf, threatening to kill the publisher if he did not release Bakunin from a contract, Nechayev became even more isolated from his comrades. Bakunin continued to write privately to Nechayev, proposing that they continue to work together.

In September 1870, Nechayev published an issue of the &quot;Commune&quot; magazine in London as the Second French Empire of Napoleon III collapsed. Hiding from the Okhrana, he went underground in Paris and then in Zürich. He also kept in touch with the Polish Blanquists such as Caspar Turski and others. In September 1872, Karl Marx produced the threatening letter (which Nechayev had written to the publisher) at the Hague Congress of the International at which Bakunin was also expelled from the organisation.

On 14 August 1872, Nechayev was arrested in Zürich and handed over to the Russian police. He was found guilty on 8 January 1873 and sentenced to twenty years of &quot;katorga&quot; (hard labor) for killing Ivanov. This was effectively a death sentence, since nobody survived twenty years in the Peter and Paul Fortress. While locked up in a ravelin of the fortress, Nechayev managed to win over his guards with the strength of his convictions and by the late 1870s was using them to pass on correspondence with revolutionaries on the outside. In December 1880, Nechayev established contact with the executive committee of the People&#x27;s Will (Narodnaya Volya) and proposed a plan for his own escape. However, Narodnaya Volya abandoned the plan due to its unwillingness to distract the efforts of its members from attempting to assassinate Tsar Alexander II, which they achieved only in March 1881.

Vera Zasulich, who ten years earlier had been among those investigated for Ivanov&#x27;s murder, heard in 1877 that the head of the Saint Petersburg police, General Trepov, had ordered the flogging of Arkhip Bogolyubov, a young political prisoner. Though not a follower of Nechayev, Zasulich felt outraged at Bogolyubov&#x27;s mistreatment and at the plight of other political prisoners. On 5 February, she walked into Trepov&#x27;s office and shot and wounded him. In an indication of the popular political feeling of the time, a jury found her not guilty on the grounds that she had acted out of noble intent.

In November 1882, Nechayev died in his cell. Despite his personal courage and fanatical dedication to the revolutionary cause, Nechayev&#x27;s methods (later called &quot;Nechayevshchina&quot;) were viewed to have caused harm to the Russian revolutionary movement by endangering clandestine organizations. Historian Edvard Radzinsky suggests that many revolutionaries have successfully implemented Nechayev&#x27;s methods and ideas, including Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.

== Influence ==
Nechayev&#x27;s theories had a major influence on other Russian revolutionaries, like Pyotr Tkachev and Vladimir Lenin. He was the first to bring the theme of the professional revolutionary in Russia. Lenin&#x27;s brother Aleksandr Ulyanov was part of an organization which based its program on Nechayev&#x27;s. Lenin stated that Nechayev was a &quot;Titan of the revolution&quot; and that all of the communist revolutionaries must &quot;read Nechayev&quot;. Many critics inside and out of the Soviet Union labelled his version of revolutionary socialism the one that was taking place in the Soviet Union itself, with Soviet politicians after the Stalin era admitting this themselves many times. He also influenced later generations of Russian revolutionary nihilists. He was rehabilitated by some Soviet historians during Stalin&#x27;s time. In the third edition of the &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; (1969–1978), Nechayev is described as follows: &quot;Possessing great personal courage and fanatically devoted to the revolutionary cause, Nechayev acted using methods unacceptable for a revolutionary and brought great harm to the Russian revolutionary movement.&quot;

The murder of Ivanov was the initial inspiration for Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;Demons&quot;. The character of Pyotr Stepanovich Verkhovensky, an organizer of a revolutionary group, was inspired by Nechayev and the ideas in &quot;Catechism of a Revolutionary&quot;. The character of Shatov in the novel was partially based on Ivanov.

On June 15, 1926, Whistle Bottling Company of Johnsonburg, Pennsylvania, registered &quot;Spic and Span&quot; trademark No. 214,076 — washing and cleaning compound in crystal form with incidental water-softening properties.

The modern cleaner was invented by housewives Elizabeth &quot;Bet&quot; MacDonald and Naomi Stenglein in Saginaw, Michigan in 1933. Their formula included equal parts of ground-up glue, sodium carbonate, and trisodium phosphate; though trisodium phosphate is no longer part of the modern formula out of a concern for environmental damage from phosphates making their way into waterways. Stenglein observed that testing in her house made it spotless, or &quot;spick and span&quot;. They took the k off &quot;spick&quot; and started selling the product to local markets. From 1933 to 1944, both families helped run their &quot;Spic and Span Products Company&quot;. On January 29, 1945, Procter &amp; Gamble, a major international manufacturer of household and personal products based in Cincinnati, Ohio, bought Spic and Span for $1.9 million. On August 30, 1949, Procter &amp; Gamble registered the &quot;Spic and Span&quot; trademark (soluble cleaner, cleanser, and detergent).

The product was advertised in many soap operas, serving as the main sponsor of &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; for two decades.

The brand, along with Comet, was acquired by Prestige Brands in 2001. In 2018, Prestige Brands sold the brand to KIK Custom Products Inc. Procter &amp; Gamble retained the rights to market the brand to the professional (non-home-consumer) market in the United States.

==Usage==
The powdered form must be mixed in water to use. A liquid version is also available. Although considered all-purpose, it is &quot;not recommended for carpets, upholstery, aluminum, glass, laundry, or mixing with bleach or ammonia&quot; as written on product label.

==Etymology==
The product was named from the older phrase &quot;spick and span&quot;.

The phrase &quot;span-new&quot; meant as new as a freshly cut wood chip, such as those once used to make spoons. In a metaphor dating from at least 1300, something span-new was neat and unstained.

Spic was added in the 16th century, as a &quot;spick&quot; (a spike or nail) was another metaphor for something neat and trim. The British phrase may have evolved from the Dutch &quot;spiksplinter nieuw&quot;, &quot;spike-splinter new&quot;. In 1665, Samuel Pepys used &quot;&quot; in his famous diary. The &quot;clean&quot; sense appears to have arisen only recently. The term is completely unrelated to the modern epithet &quot;spic&quot;.

<text>A safelight is a light source suitable for use in a photographic darkroom. It provides illumination only from parts of the visible spectrum to which the photographic material in use is nearly, or completely insensitive.

==Design==
A safelight usually consists of an ordinary light bulb in a housing closed off by a coloured filter, but sometimes a special light bulb or fluorescent tube with suitable filter material or phosphor (in fluorescent tubes) coated directly on the glass is used in an ordinary fixture. More recently LEDs, which have a relatively narrow spectral bandwidth, are becoming more popular.

Differently sensitised materials require different safelights. In traditional black-and-white photographic printing, photographic papers normally are handled under an amber or red safelight, as such papers typically are sensitive only to blue and green light. Orthochromatic papers and films are also sensitive to yellow light and must be used only with a deep red safelight, not with an amber one. Panchromatic films and papers, nominally sensitive to the entire spectrum, sometimes have a region of minimum in their range of sensitivity that allows the careful use of safelight confined to that part of the spectrum. For example, Kodak Panalure panchromatic paper is tolerant of limited exposure to light filtered through a Kodak 13 Safelight Filter. Other panchromatic materials must be handled only in total darkness.

Many photosensitive materials used in technical and industrial applications, such as photoresist, are sensitive only to blue, violet, and ultraviolet light and may be handled under a brighter yellow safelight. Low-pressure sodium vapour lamps sometimes are used in larger industrial darkrooms. They emit nearly monochromatic light at 589 nm (yellow), to which the materials are insensitive; as a result they can be extremely bright while still &quot;safe&quot;.

The word &quot;safe&quot; in &quot;safelight&quot; is relative, as in most cases, a sensitised material eventually will be affected by its safelight if exposed to it for an extended length of time.

<doc id="985064" wikidata="Q1060241" url="?curid=985064" title="Viva Las Vegas">
<text>Viva Las Vegas is a 1964 American rock and roll musical film directed by George Sidney, written by Sally Benson, choreographed by David Winters, and starring Elvis Presley, Ann-Margret, Cesare Danova, William Demarest and Nicky Blair. Set in Las Vegas, Nevada, the film is about two competing race car drivers who also compete for the same girl.

The film&#x27;s theme song &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; (written by Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman) did well on the year&#x27;s record sales and has since become a theme song for the titular city.

The film is regarded by Elvis fans and film critics as one of Presley&#x27;s best films, and it is noted for the real-life on-screen chemistry between Presley and Ann-Margret.

&quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; was a hit at film theaters, as it was No. 14 on the &quot;Variety&quot; entertainment trade magazine&#x27;s year end box office list of the top-grossing films of 1964.

==Plot==
Lucky Jackson (Elvis) goes to Las Vegas, Nevada to participate in the city&#x27;s first annual Grand Prix Race. However, his race car, an Elva Mark VI, is in need of a new engine to compete in the event.

Lucky raises the necessary money in Las Vegas, but he loses it when he is shoved into the pool by the hotel&#x27;s young swimming instructor, Rusty Martin (Ann-Margret). Lucky then has to work as a waiter at the hotel to replace the lost money to pay his hotel bill, as well as enter the hotel&#x27;s talent contest in hopes of winning a cash prize sizable enough to pay for his car&#x27;s engine.

During all this time, Lucky attempts to win the affections of Rusty. His main competition arrives in the form of Count Elmo Mancini (Cesare Danova) and his Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta. Mancini attempts to win both the Grand Prix and the affections of Rusty. Rusty soon falls in love with Lucky, and immediately tries to change him into what she wants.

==Cast==
==Production==
George Sidney later said &quot;that was one of those cases where we had no script and we had a commitment. Originally it was something about an Arabian or something... But we turned it around and we wrote the script in about eleven days... We changed the whole thing and decided to do it in Las Vegas.&quot;

In March 1963, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer president Robert O&#x27;Brien announced &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; would be one of 20 films made at the studio the following year. By May, Ann-Margret signed to co-star. She was paid $15,000 a week over ten weeks. &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; was filmed during the summer of 1963, before production of Presley&#x27;s film &quot;Kissin&#x27; Cousins&quot;, but was released after &quot;Kissin&#x27; Cousins&quot; in the summer of 1964.

In Great Britain, both the film and its soundtrack were sold as &quot;Love in Las Vegas&quot;, since there was another, different film called &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; that was being shown in British cinemas at the same time that Presley&#x27;s was released.

The chemistry between the two stars was genuine during filming. Presley and Ann-Margret began an affair, and this received considerable attention from film and music gossip columnists. This reportedly led to a showdown with Presley&#x27;s worried girlfriend Priscilla Beaulieu. (Elvis and Priscilla married in 1967.) In her 1985 book &quot;Elvis and Me&quot;, Priscilla Presley describes the difficulties that she experienced when the gossip columnists erroneously &quot;announced&quot; that Ann-Margret and Presley had become engaged to be married.

In her memoirs, Ann-Margret refers to Elvis Presley as her &quot;soulmate&quot; and stated: &quot;We felt there was a need in &#x27;The Industry&#x27; for a female Elvis Presley.&quot;

In addition, the filming of &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; reportedly produced unusually heated exchanges between the director, film veteran George Sidney, and Presley&#x27;s manager, Colonel Tom Parker, who was not credited as a &quot;Technical Advisor&quot; in the film&#x27;s credits.

The arguments reportedly concerned the amount of time and effort allotted by the cinematographer, Joseph Biroc, to the song and dance numbers that featured Ann-Margret, ostensibly on the orders of the director. These scenes include views of Ann-Margret&#x27;s dancing taken from many different camera angles, the use of multiple cameras for each scene, and several retakes of each of her song-and-dance scenes.

David Winters, the film&#x27;s choreographer, was recommended for the job by Ann-Margret, who was his dance student at the time. This was Winters&#x27;s first job as a choreographer. The film presents a set of ten musical song-and-dance scenes.

Because the film went over budget, Parker would slash budgets for all remaining films in Presley&#x27;s career.

Little Church of the West, the oldest wedding chapel in Las Vegas, is the location used in the closing scene.

The scene where Presley sings &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; is performed in one single unedited shot, the only known example of such a technique in Presley&#x27;s film career.

The film also includes a scene (Lucky and the Count looking for Rusty) with the showgirls of the Folies Bergere at The Tropicana Hotel Las Vegas.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed $9,442,967 at the box office, earning $5 million in U.S. theatrical rentals.

===Critical===
For his role in &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;, Elvis Presley received a third place prize 1965 Laurel Award for best male performance in a musical film. &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; was also the 1965 Laurel runner-up in the category of the best musical of 1964. Ann-Margret was praised for her on screen chemistry with Elvis, as she nearly stole the film from him.

Some critics in 1964 were lukewarm about &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;, such as one for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who wrote: &quot;&quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;, the new Elvis Presley vehicle, is about as pleasant and unimportant as a banana split.&quot; However, many others deduced the reasons why many members of the North American public liked the movie so much. &quot;Variety&quot; stated in its review: &quot;Beyond several flashy musical numbers, a glamorous locale, and one electrifying auto race sequence, the production is a pretty trite and &#x27;heavyhanded&#x27; affair&quot;. Critical reaction notwithstanding, &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; has become one of Elvis Presley&#x27;s most popular and iconic films.

Contemporary reception for the film has been positive. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 87% based on 30 reviews. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Ann-Margret keeps Elvis on his toes and together they elevate &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; into a naughty and rockin&#x27; mild delight.&quot; &quot;Filmink&quot; argued Ann-Margret &quot;had so much energy and pep that she had blown her previous three male co-stars off screen, but Elvis could match her. He was the best on-screen partner she ever had, and she was his. It’s the most purely entertaining Elvis movie ever, a complete delight and it’s unbelievable they were never teamed again.&quot;

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; – Nominated
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s Greatest Movie Musicals – Nominated

<text>Folgers Coffee is a brand of ground, instant, and single-use pod coffee produced and sold in the United States, with additional distribution in Asia, Canada and Mexico. It forms part of the food and beverage division of The J.M. Smucker Company. Folgers roasts its coffee in New Orleans.

==History==
&quot;J.A. Folger &amp; Co. were established in 1850 as Wm. H. Bovee &amp; Co&quot;

The precursor of the Folger Coffee Company was founded in 1850 in San Francisco, California, as the Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. The founding owner, William H. Bovee, saw an opportunity to produce roasted and ground coffee ready for brewing. Before that, Californians had to purchase green coffee beans, and roast and grind them on their own. To help build his mill, Bovee hired J. A. Folger as a carpenter. Folger had arrived from Nantucket Island at age 15 with his two older brothers during the California Gold Rush. In the 1850s, kerosene became a cheaper alternative to whale oil, Nantucket&#x27;s dominant business. Many Nantucket ships were re-purposed to instead bring coffee from South America to San Francisco. After working at Bovee&#x27;s mill for nearly a year, Folger had saved enough money to buy part of the company, and went to mine for gold. He agreed to carry samples of coffee and spices, taking orders from grocery stores along the way. Upon his return to San Francisco in 1865, Folger became a full partner at Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. In 1872, he bought out the other partners and renamed the company J.A. Folger &amp; Co.

In 1861, James Folger married. He and his wife had four children, and two of the children worked for the family business. In 1889, Folger died, and his oldest son, James A. Folger II, became president of J.A. Folger &amp; Co at the age of 26.

In the 1900s, the company began to grow dramatically due primarily to a salesman named Frank P. Atha. Atha sold coffee in the California area, but proposed to James Folger II that he open and manage a Folgers Coffee plant in Texas. The company grew exponentially after Atha opened the Texas plant.

Under the mid-20th century leadership of Peter Folger, the brand became one of the principal coffee concerns in North America. In 1960, the construction of a Folger Coffee Company plant in New Orleans was started due to new shipping routes from Central America. Procter &amp; Gamble acquired Folger&#x27;s in 1963 and removed the apostrophe from its name. During P&amp;G&#x27;s ownership, Folgers became the number one coffee brand in America.

On August 9, 1969, company heiress Abigail Folger was stabbed to death in Los Angeles as part of the Manson Family&#x27;s Tate–LaBianca murders.

P&amp;G announced in January 2008 that Folgers would be spun off into a separate Cincinnati-based company but reversed itself that June and announced Folgers would be acquired by the end of 2008 by The J.M. Smucker Company. Utilizing a rare financial technique called a Reverse Morris Trust, Smucker purchased Folgers in November 2008 and made it a subsidiary, whose products lead the $10 billion USD at-home retail coffee category.

Folgers also produces and sells non-instant coffee products.

==Brands==
Folgers established brand colors, included on their logo, were traditionally a moderately dark red background with white lettering. The white or grey lettering is still used, with a green background signifying decaf and a black background signifying their Noir dark roast.

==Advertising==

Folgers is promoted with the slogan &quot;The best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup!&quot; It is well associated with a jingle featured in almost every advertisement since 1984, with lyrics by Susan Spiegel Solovay and Bill Vernick, and music by Leslie Pearl. Over the years it has been rearranged and performed by many famous musicians, such as Richie Havens, Randy Travis, Bonnie Tyler, Paul Stanley, Aretha Franklin, and Rockapella.

From 1965 to 1986, Folgers was known for television ads involving &quot;Mrs. Olson&quot;, a Swedish neighbor played by Virginia Christine who invariably recommended a cup of Folgers coffee for the characters in the commercial.

Folgers promoted their instant coffee in the 1970s and early 1980s ads which took the viewer inside various &#x27;high-end&#x27; restaurants while a voice-over (by Bryan Clark) whispered to the viewer that they&#x27;ve secretly switched the coffee used at the restaurant with Folgers, and watched the restaurants&#x27; patrons to see if they could tell whether or not they noticed the difference.

One Folgers television ad from 1985, &quot;Peter Comes Home For Christmas,&quot; became particularly associated with the Christmas holidays. A college student returns home, apparently on Christmas Day. His younger sister is the first one to greet Peter, helping him make the Folgers. The smell of freshly brewed coffee awakening his parents and alerting them to their son&#x27;s arrival. The Cunningham &amp; Walsh spot aired yearly until 1998, then in edited form in 2004 and 2005.

In the mid-1980s Folgers became a NASCAR sponsor. After a trial season with the Joe Ruttman-driven and Larry McClure-owned Chevrolet in 1985, Folgers expanded its sponsorships.

In 2006, the advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi created a viral advertisement, popularly known as &quot;Happy Mornings&quot;, in which a large group of cheerful singers and dancers appear at sunrise as the sun itself to wake people up.

In 2009, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi created a holiday ad, &quot;Coming Home&quot;, wherein a man reunites with his teenage sister at their parents&#x27; home after volunteering in West Africa. The ad quickly went viral, and has been criticized for perceived sexual tensions between the siblings.

In 2014, the brand celebrated the 30th anniversary of the famous jingle.

==Building==
The brick, five-story Folger Coffee Company Building at 101 Howard in San Francisco, California is the former headquarters of Folgers. It is listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places. The building still has a sign saying &quot;The Folgers Coffee Company&quot; on one corner.

On August 2, 2011, the Folger Building was purchased by the University of San Francisco, marking a return to the university&#x27;s roots in downtown San Francisco.

==In popular culture==
In the 1998 film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, after one of the protagonists dies, their ashes are transported to the Pacific Ocean in a Folgers coffee can because the cheapest urn is deemed too expensive. The film has become a cult classic, and at least one person has cosplayed as a can of Folgers during a fan event.

In the 1991&quot; Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Library&quot;, Jerry is challenged by Lt. Bookman (played by Philip Baker Hall) on why there is no instant coffee available for guests to his apartment: &quot;You buy a jar of Folger&#x27;s Crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you forget about it. Then later on when you need it, it&#x27;s there. It lasts forever. It&#x27;s freeze-dried. Freeze-dried crystals.&quot;

The November 16, 1991 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; had a sketch that parodied the &#x27;high end restaurant&#x27; commercials from the 1970s and 1980s, showing a customer (Chris Farley) violently losing his temper upon being informed that he was given another company&#x27;s coffee blend instead of the restaurant&#x27;s usual blend.

In The Big Bang Theory episode &quot;The Earworm Reverberation&quot; (S9, E10) Sheldon Cooper puts Folgers Coffee in Leonard Hofstadter&#x27;s Coffee as a prank.

<text>The CRASH-B Sprints World Indoor Rowing Championships (CRASH-B Sprints) was the world championship for indoor rowing, raced over a distance of 2,000m. The regatta is sponsored by Concept2, and raced on their C2 rowers. Originally held in Harvard&#x27;s Newell Boathouse, the regatta moved in turn to the Malkin Athletic Center, the Radcliff Quadrangle Athletic Center, MIT&#x27;s Rockwell Cage, Harvard&#x27;s Indoor Track Facility, the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center, Boston University&#x27;s Agganis Arena, and in 2019, to the Boston University Track and Tennis Center. The regatta is held in late February each year.

Competitors are 12 years old and up, including adaptive categories. In 2019 there was an age group for 90–94 years old.

The race was started in 1980 by a group of US Olympic and World Team rowers. The CRASH-B Sprints are officially sponsored by Concept 2. Originally, the acronym for the race, C.R.A.S.H.-B., stood for the Charles River Association of Sculling Has-Beens. It was later changed to the Charles River All-Star Has-Beens. The racing format has evolved over the history of the event. Now, all athletes race a single distance of 2,000 meters. Previously, the regatta involved multiple heats, finals, and longer distances (2,500 meters, 5 miles, and 6 miles).

==Winners==

*The fastest time of the day occurred in the Men&#x27;s Heavyweight ages 40–49 category, in which Graham Benton won in a world record (for that category) time of 5:48.3.

<text>District courts are a category of courts which exists in several nations, some call them &quot;small case court&quot; usually as the lowest level of the hierarchy. 

These courts generally work under a higher court which exercises control over the lower court and supervises it. 

==Americas==

===United States===
In the United States federal courts, the United States district courts are the general trial courts. The federal district courts have jurisdiction over federal questions (trials and cases interpreting the Constitution, Federal law, or which involve federal statutes or crimes) and diversity (cases otherwise subject to jurisdiction in a state trial court but which are between litigants of different states and/or countries). There are 89 federal districts in the 50 states. United States district courts also exist in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands. In total, there are 94 U.S. district courts. Decisions from these courts are subject to review by one of the 13 United States court of appeals, which are, in turn, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States.

Some states maintain state courts called &quot;district courts.&quot; In Florida, the Florida District Courts of Appeal are intermediate appellate courts. In Texas, the Texas District Courts are trial courts of general jurisdiction, hearing all felony and divorce cases, election controversies, and many civil matters. The Hawaii State District Courts, and those in Alaska, New York, and Kentucky, to name a few, are courts of limited jurisdiction.

==Asia and Oceania==
===Australia===

District court is the name given to the intermediate court in most Australian states. They hear indictable (serious) criminal offences excluding treason, murder and, in some states, manslaughter. Their civil jurisdiction is also intermediate, typically being for civil disputes where the amount claimed is greater than a $75 000 but less than $750 000. The limits vary between Australian states. In Victoria, the equivalent court is called the County Court. Below them are the magistrates&#x27; courts, known as the Local Court in New South Wales. Above them are the state supreme courts.

===China===
===Cyprus===

The District Courts are courts of first instance for civil matters (except those which are dealt with by special courts) and criminal cases involving prison sentences of five years of less. There are six such courts.
===Hong Kong===

The District Court in Hong Kong, established in 1953, has limited jurisdiction in both civil and criminal matters. With effect from 1 December 2003, it has civil jurisdiction to hear monetary claims up to HK$1 million or, where the claims are for recovery of land, the annual rent or rateable value does not exceed HK$240,000. In its criminal jurisdiction, the court may try the more serious cases, with the main exceptions of murder, manslaughter and rape. The maximum term of imprisonment it may impose is seven years. There are one Chief District Judge and 30 District Judges, among which three district judges sit in the Family Court and two district judges sit in the Lands Tribunal as Presiding Officers.

===India===

The district courts of India are presided over by a judge. They administer justice in India at a district level. These courts are under administrative and judicial control of the high court of the state to which the district concerned belongs.

===Indonesia===

The district courts of Indonesia are part of public courts for all cases non-related to religion, constitutions or military matters. The decisions of guilt or innocence are made by a panel of three judges led by a chair judge.

===Israel===

The district courts in Israel serve both as the appellate courts and also as the court of first instance for some cases (e.g. real estate or IP). In criminal matters, they try cases where the accused faces a penalty of at least seven years imprisonment. As of 2007, there are six district courts:
*Jerusalem
*Tel Aviv
*Haifa
*Nazareth
*Central Region (Lod)
*Beersheba

===Japan===

Japan has 50 district courts, one in each of the 47 prefectures&#x27; capitals, and one in the three cities of Hakodate, Asahikawa and Kushiro on Hokkaido. They are the first court level for most civil and criminal cases. Most cases are held with one judge.

===New Zealand===
The District Court of New Zealand deals with all criminal matters other than murder, manslaughter and specified offences such as treason. The court can also hear civil claims up to $350,000. District courts were called magistrates&#x27; courts until 1980.

===Pakistan===

The district courts of Pakistan are presided over by a senior judge. They administer justice in Pakistan at a district level. These courts are under administrative and judicial control of the high court of the province to which the district concerned belongs.

==Europe==

===Austria===
Austria has some 200 district, or local, courts, which decide minor civil and criminal cases.

===Denmark===
Denmark consists of 24 judicial districts, each being served by a district court (Danish: &quot;byret&quot;, literally meaning &quot;town court&quot;). Each district court serves one or more of the country&#x27;s 98 municipalities, except that Copenhagen Municipality is divided between two district because of its size. Before 2007, when the number of municipalities was reduced from 271 to 98, there were 82 district courts.

The two high courts (the Eastern and Western) serve as courts of appeal.

===Finland===
: &quot;See also Judicial system of Finland&quot;

Finland has 27 district courts, which deal with criminal cases, civil cases and petitionary matters. Since December 1, 1993 these have been called &quot;käräjäoikeus&quot; in Finnish and &quot;tingsrätt&quot; in Swedish. Each court is headed by the Chief Judge and other District Judges. In certain cases, the district court may also have lay judges. The cases are handled and resolved either in a session or in chambers. In simple cases decisions can be made by notaries.

===Germany===
Germany has 115 regional courts (&quot;Landgerichte&quot;), which are superior to the local courts (&quot;Amtsgerichte&quot;) and below the higher regional courts (&quot;Oberlandesgerichte&quot;).

===Iceland===
The district courts are the lowest judicial level in Iceland. There are eight courts operating in separate districts, the District Court of Reykjavík, the District Court of Reykjanes, the District Court of Western Iceland, the District Court of the Westfjords, the District Court of Northwest Iceland, the District Court of Northeast Iceland, the District Court of East Iceland and the District Court of South Iceland. The courts handle all cases in their first instance. Subject to conditions, cases can be appealed to a higher court, ultimately the Supreme Court of Iceland whose conclusions are final.

===Ireland===
The District Court in Ireland was established in 1924. The court handles civil claims of up to €15,000 and summary criminal trials (minor offences tried by a judge alone where the maximum penalty is 12 months on indictment in the Circuit Court and the granting of licences for the sale of alcohol.

===Norway===

The Norwegian &quot;tingrett&quot; deals with criminal and civil cases. The term &quot;tingrett&quot; was introduced in 2002, and replaced the previous terms &quot;byrett&quot; and &quot;herredsrett&quot; as designations for district courts.

===Poland===
===Sweden===
In Sweden, there are 48 district courts (); Tingsrätt is also used to describe such courts in Finland and Norway. While relatively recent creations in their current form, the term &quot;tingsrätt&quot; refers to the &quot;ting&quot; (&quot;thing&quot;), the ancient term for governing assemblies in these and other Nordic and Germanic countries, where disputes would be brought up to be settled. The specific term &quot;tingsrätt&quot; was used for courts already in 17th century Sweden, but was later discontinued. It&#x27;s the court of first instance; dealing with criminal cases, some civil law disputes and a number of non-contentious matters. Private cases against decisions by the public authorities are generally handled by the &quot;tingsrätt&quot; or the &quot;förvaltningsrätt&quot; (administrative court), depending on the authority in question.

In 1971, the &quot;tingsrätt&quot;″s became the district courts of Sweden, replacing the previous distinction between &quot;rådhusrätt&quot; in larger cities and the &quot;häradsrätt&quot;″s for the assize courts of Sweden in other parts of the country. Later reforms have substantially reduced the number of these courts from around 100 to currently (2014) 48.

Appeals against a district court are made to the appellate court ().

===United Kingdom===

====Scotland====
District courts were introduced in 1975 as replacement for the burgh police courts; they dealt with the most minor crimes. They were run by the local authorities. Each court comprised one or more justices of the peace (lay magistrates) who sat alone or in threes with a qualified legal assessor as convener or clerk of court.

They handled many cases of breach of the peace, drunkenness, minor assaults, petty theft, and offences under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982.

District courts operated under summary procedure and could not impose a fine in excess of £2,500 or sentence an offender to more than 60 days in prison. In practice, most offences were dealt with by a fine.

District courts in Scotland were abolished and replaced with justice of the peace courts under the provisions of the Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007. The justice of the peace courts are managed by the Scottish Court Service. Responsibility for the courts was transferred from the local authorities in a rolling programme of court unification which concluded in February 2010. District courts were replaced by JP courts in sheriffdoms as follows:

*Sheriffdom of Lothian and Borders, 10 March 2008
*Sheriffdom of Grampian, Highlands and Islands, 2 June 2008
*Sheriffdom of Glasgow and Strathkelvin, 8 December 2008
*Sheriffdom of Tayside, Central and Fife, 23 February 2009
*Sheriffdom of North Strathclyde, 14 December 2009
*Sheriffdom of South Strathclyde, Dumfries &amp; Galloway, 22 February 2010

Page first founded Page One Records with Dick James in 1966, but left the company in 1969 to start a new label. He bought the name of another company Penny Farthing to use it for his label, and located the headquarters on Tilney Street.

Penny Farthing Records had its first success with their second single released in 1969, which was &quot;Venus&quot; by the Dutch group, Shocking Blue. 

In 1970, Penny Farthing Records released the single, &quot;Sister Simon (Funny Man)&quot; PEN 738, by the UK group Heatwave (later known as The Sensations). While the a-side received airplay, the funky b-side, &quot;Rastus Ravel&quot;, was well received in the clubs. Both songs were written and produced by John Edward for Instant Sound Productions. The single featured Maggie Stredder and Jean Ryder of The Ladybirds with Doris Troy as back-up singers. The group was a regular on the BBC Radio Terry Wogan, Dave Cash, Jimmy Young and Radio 1 Club shows. In 1970, Killing Floor&#x27;s second album, &quot;Out of Uranus&quot;, was released on Penny Farthing Records.

The former Honeybus bassist, Colin Hare, released an album &quot;March Hare&quot; on Penny Farthing in 1971, which was not a commercial success. It was re-released through Hare&#x27;s own Runfast label in 2004.

Daniel Boone&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful Sunday&quot; (written by the singer) and released in 1972, was a staple of early 1970s disc jockeys. Picked up by the Japanese TV show &quot;Beautiful Sunday&quot; some ten years later, this song was re-popularized in Japan. Page also recorded Daniel&#x27;s wife (Lesley) Lelly Boone, but with no success despite an appearance on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

In 1971, Larry Page also signed up Johnny Pearson and released a stream of easy listening albums, the last of these being released in 1982. Pearson is notable as being the pianist and arranger behind British studio outfit Sounds Orchestral. The Johnny Pearson Orchestra&#x27;s track, &quot;Sleepy Shores&quot;, was a No. 8 hit in the UK Singles Chart for Penny Farthing in 1971, and an album of the same name was released the following year.

Page also recorded The Barron Knights, whose comedy records had some UK chart success. However, Page&#x27;s attempts to turn them into a mainstream pop group failed. He eventually resorted to the flop &quot;The Ballad of Frank Spencer&quot;. Even his attempt to record them under another name – Philly Dog – did not produce the desired hits.

Paul Da Vinci, the voice on The Rubettes hit &quot;Sugar Baby Love&quot;, turned to Penny Farthing immediately after this song made the UK no. 1 slot. The resulting &quot;Your Baby Ain&#x27;t Your Baby Anymore&quot; sold modestly.

Page One Records stalwarts The Troggs were persuaded to join Penny Farthing but their label debut, Page&#x27;s attempt at the Beach Boys hit &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; with Reg Presley&#x27;s vocals, did not produce sizeable sales.

Penny Farthing also recorded an early album by Raymond Froggatt. However, most of the company&#x27;s revenue was gained from Germany, where their solo artist signing Kincade had a number of minor hits, including &quot;Dreams Are 10 A Penny&quot;, &quot;Big Hand For Annie&quot; written by John Carter. Carter, writing under a number of different names, also had hits with Penny Farthing in the early 1970s.

Page formed Rampage Records as a successor for Penny Farthing in 1978.

<doc id="985083" wikidata="Q133103" url="?curid=985083" title="Pilgerodendron">
<text>Pilgerodendron is a genus of conifer belonging to the cypress family Cupressaceae. It has only one species, Pilgerodendron uviferum, which is endemic to the Valdivian temperate rain forests and Magellanic subpolar forests of southern Chile and southwestern Argentina. It grows from 40 to 54°20&#x27; S in Tierra del Fuego, where it is the southernmost conifer in the world. It is a member of subfamily Callitroideae, a group of distinct Southern Hemisphere genera associated with the Antarctic flora.

&quot;Pilgerodendron&quot; is very closely related to the New Zealand and New Caledonian genus &quot;Libocedrus&quot;, and many botanists treat &quot;P. uviferum&quot; within this genus, as &quot;Libocedrus uvifera&quot; (D.Don) Pilg. It is also a taxonomical synonym for &quot;Libocedrus tetragona&quot; (Hooker). The species is known locally as ciprés de las Guaitecas (after the Guaitecas Archipelago), and elsewhere by its scientific name, as pilgerodendron. The genus is named after Robert Knud Friedrich Pilger.

&quot;P. uviferum&quot; is a dioecious, slow-growing, narrowly conical evergreen tree that grows from 2–20 m in height, with a trunk up to 1.5 m in diameter. Taller specimens and wider trunks (reportedly up to 3 m in diameter) are known to have existed before it was overexploited. The leaves are scale-like and arranged in decussate pairs, with each leaf equal in size, giving the shoots a square cross-section (unlike the &quot;Libocedrus&quot; species, where pairs of larger leaves alternate with pairs of smaller leaves, giving a somewhat flattened shoot). The seed cones are 5–12 mm long and 4–6 mm broad, with four scales, two sterile basal scales and two fertile scales; each scale has a slender spine-like bract, and each fertile scale has two winged seeds 3–4 mm long. The pollen cones are 5–10 mm long and 2 mm broad, with 12–20 scales.

It is found in the evergreen coastal lowland forests along the Pacific coast of southern Patagonia, in association with the broadleaf evergreens &quot;Nothofagus betuloides&quot; and &quot;Drimys winteri&quot;. It is also found in open stands in sheltered bogs farther inland, where it is often locally dominant, and ranges as far as the eastern slopes of the Andes in southwestern Argentina. Forest dominated by &quot;Pilgerodendron&quot; are known as cipresales. The forests are common in the southern half of Chiloé Island where occupy many of flattish areas. At the northern end of its range it is found in association with &quot;Fitzroya cupressoides&quot;. The northernmost natural stands are found in 39°50&#x27; in the vicinity of the city of Valdivia. The conservation status of &quot;P. uviferu,&quot; in the far north of its natural distribution is poor, being fragmented by exotic plantations, threatened by livestock and having been decimated by lumberjacks and wildfires in the past. It has also been planted along the northern part of the Pacific Coast of the United States.

At present much &quot;Pilgerodendron uviferum&quot; grow in the Andes and in the Chilean Coast Range. However, during the interstadials of the region&#x27;s last glacial period, &quot;P. uviferum&quot; grew in lowland areas such as the Central Valley, where it is now absent. Remaining lowland populations are thought to be relicts that have survived the warmer climate of the Holocene.

The wood of &quot;P. uviferum&quot; is yellow-reddish and has a distinct spicy-resinous smell, and is highly resistant to decay, which has made it very valuable as a source of timber for building construction in its native range. Much of its original lowland habitat has been cleared for this and other reasons. Due to over-exploitation, the species is now much scarcer than formerly, and is accordingly listed under CITES Appendix I, meaning commercial international trade is prohibited. &quot;P. uviferum&quot; is considered threatened by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre and vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
==History==
Indigenous sea-faring nomads of the Chono and Kawésqars groups used &quot;Pilgerodendron uviferum&quot; as firewood as well as wood for rows(oars?), boats and houses. During the Antonio de Vea expedition (1675–1676) Spanish explorers visited the Guaitecas and Chonos archipelagoes where the tree grew noticing the similarity to the &quot;cypresses of Spain&quot;.

Historically the wood was used to make railway sleepers, but eventually became popular for use as timber in all types of construction. In the 1860s, Felipe Westhoff was one of various businessmen who exported &quot;Pilgerodendron uviferum&quot; north to Chilean and Peruvian ports. Westhoff, who was based in Ancud, came initially as an agent of Ferrocarril Central Andino in Peru to purchase sleepers but soon became an independent businessman.

The town of Melinka was established in 1860 during the &quot;Pilgerodendron&quot; boom. This was the first permanent settlement in the Guaitecas Archipelago. After Westhoff&#x27;s retirement in the 1870s, Ciriaco Álvarez, a native of Chonchi, rose as the most prominent &quot;P. uviferum&quot; businessman in the area, and was dubbed &quot;The King of Pilgerodendron&quot; (). Many of the wooden structures in settlements of the southern Chilean archipelagos are built largely from &quot;P. uviferum&quot; wood.

Foraging by southern pudu is thought to be detrimental for the regeneration of burned forests of &quot;Pilgerodendron uviferum&quot;.

<doc id="985085" wikidata="Q335984" url="?curid=985085" title="John Widgery, Baron Widgery">
<text>John Passmore Widgery, Baron Widgery, (24 July 1911 – 26 July 1981) was an English judge who served as Lord Chief Justice of England from 1971 to 1980. He is principally noted for presiding over the Widgery Tribunal on the events of Bloody Sunday.

==Early career and war service==
Widgery came from a North Devon family which had been living in South Molton for many generations. His father, Samuel Widgery (died 1940), was a grocer and house furnisher; his mother Bertha Elizabeth, née Passmore, was Samuel&#x27;s second wife, belonged to a landowning family (Grilstone, Bishop&#x27;s Nympton, Devon) and served as a local magistrate. An ancestor had been a gaoler. Widgery attended Queen&#x27;s College, Taunton, where he became head prefect.

He was admitted as a solicitor in 1933 after serving as an articled clerk, but instead of going into practice, he joined Gibson and Welldon, a well-known firm of law tutors. He was an effective lecturer in the years leading up to World War II while he was also commissioned into the Royal Engineers (Territorial Army) in 1938, having joined as a sapper. As a searchlight officer, in 1940 he transferred to the Royal Artillery. Widgery participated in the Normandy landings. By the end of the war he had an OBE, the Croix de Guerre (France), and the Order of Leopold (Belgium), and had reached the rank of brigadier. Widgery was an active freemason.

==Barrister==
After demobilisation Widgery changed to another branch of the legal profession as he was called to the bar by Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1946. He gathered a reputation for being a fast talker, and eventually came to specialise in disputes over rating and town planning, where his methodical approach and self-control were useful attributes. In 1958 he was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel, the first such award given to a post-war barrister.

Widgery became a High Court judge in 1961, receiving the customary knighthood. As a judge he did not draw attention to himself and his judgments tended not to include any comments which were pithy, memorable or quotable. However, his calmness produced judgments which were generally regarded as fair and humane. One example cited in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography was his justification for limiting damages for economic loss in &quot;Weller v Foot and Mouth Disease Research Institute&quot;, a judgment handed down in 1966. Widgery headed several inquiries during his term.

==Appellate courts==
He received promotion to the Court of Appeal in 1968, but had barely got used to his new position when Lord Parker of Waddington (who had been Lord Chief Justice since 1958) announced his retirement. There was no obvious successor and Widgery was the most junior of the possible appointees. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, chose Widgery largely on the basis of his administrative abilities. On 20 April 1971 he was created a life peer taking the title Baron Widgery, &quot;of South Molton in the County of Devon&quot;.

==Widgery Tribunal==
Shortly after assuming office, Widgery was handed the politically sensitive job of conducting an inquiry into the events of 30 January 1972 in Derry, where soldiers from Parachute Regiment had shot and killed 13 civil rights marchers, an event commonly referred to as Bloody Sunday (a 14th person died shortly after Widgery&#x27;s appointment). Widgery heard testimony from the soldiers, who claimed they had been shot at, while the marchers insisted that no one from the march was armed. Widgery produced a report, published in April 1972 that took the side of the soldiers. Widgery put the main blame for the deaths on the march organisers for creating a dangerous situation where a confrontation was inevitable. His strongest criticism of the soldiers was that their &quot;firing bordered on the reckless&quot;.

The Widgery Report was accepted by the British government but met with a mixed reception in Northern Ireland; loyalists supported the report but Irish republicans, particularly those from the Bogside and Creggan areas, criticised Widgery&#x27;s findings. The British government had acquired a level of goodwill in Northern Ireland due to its suspension of the Stormont Parliament, but that was said to have disappeared when Widgery&#x27;s conclusions were published. Grievances with Widgery&#x27;s findings in Northern Ireland lingered and the report remained contentious as the Northern Ireland peace process advanced in the 1990s.

In January 1998, on the eve of the 26th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced a new inquiry, criticising the rushed process in which Widgery failed to take evidence from those wounded on Bloody Sunday and did not personally read eyewitness accounts. The resulting Bloody Sunday Inquiry lasted 12 years before the Saville Report was published on 15 June 2010. It overturned the findings of the Widgery Report, finding that soldiers present on Bloody Sunday had lied about their actions and had falsely claimed to have been attacked. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described the Saville Report as &quot;[turning] the Widgery report on its head by exonerating the victims and delivering a damning account of the conduct of soldiers.&quot; The inquiry led British Prime Minister David Cameron, on behalf of the United Kingdom, to formally apologise for the &quot;unjustified and unjustifiable&quot; events of Bloody Sunday in 2010.

==Lord Chief Justice==
Widgery ruled in the case &quot;R v Commissioner of Metropolitan Police, ex parte Blackburn&quot; on the duty of the Crown to prosecute. The case was described as follows: &quot;A and B are alleged to have committed a crime. A is charged with the crime, convicted and sentenced. B is not charged. At the trial of A there is evidence which suggests that B may have committed or been a participant to the crime. Can the prosecution be compelled to prosecute B?&quot; In 1968, the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of Widgery, Melford Stevenson and Daniel Brabin issued judgment that &quot;to prosecute must indisputably be a matter of discretion&quot;, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.

Widgery also ruled on the Crossman diaries case when the government attempted to suppress the publication on the grounds of confidentiality. He made it clear during the case that he felt Crossman had &quot;broken the rules&quot;, but ultimately refused to grant an injunction preventing publication. In criminal cases, Widgery became concerned by an increasing number of cases resting on weak identification evidence. He declared in 1974 that misidentification was &quot;the most serious chink in our armour when we say British justice is the best in the world.&quot; In March 1976, Widgery dismissed the first appeal by the Birmingham Six in respect of the Birmingham pub bombings.

==Personal life==
In 1948, Widgery married Ann, daughter of William Edwin Kermode, of Peel, Isle of Man.

==Later years and death==
His later years in office were marred by persistent ill health and mental decline. In &quot;Private Eye&quot; it was claimed that &quot;he sits hunched and scowling, squinting into his books from a range of three inches, his wig awry. He keeps up a muttered commentary of bad-tempered and irrelevant questions – &#x27;What d&#x27;you say?&#x27;, &#x27;Speak up&#x27;, &#x27;Don&#x27;t shout&#x27;, &#x27;Whipper-snapper&#x27;, etc.&quot;. He resisted attempts to get him to resign until the last moment, in 1980. For at least 18 months previously he had not been in control of either his administrative work or his legal pronouncements, he would fall asleep in court, and it soon became apparent that he was suffering from dementia. He died two days after his 70th birthday, in 1981.

In Jimmy McGovern&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;Sunday&quot;, which portrayed the events of Bloody Sunday and subsequent inquiry, Widgery was portrayed by Michael Byrne.

<doc id="985089" wikidata="Q72332" url="?curid=985089" title="Willow Creek Community Church">
<text>Willow Creek Community Church is an Evangelical nondenominational multisite megachurch based in the northwestern Chicago suburb of South Barrington, Illinois. It was founded on October 12, 1975 by Dave Holmbo and Bill Hybels, who was its longtime senior pastor. Willow Creek has seven locations in the Chicago area; their Spanish-speaking congregations, Willow Español, meet at South Barrington and South Lake in Lincolnshire campuses.

In 2018, the church&#x27;s entire senior leadership and elder board resigned, admitting to having mishandled abuse allegations against Hybels. Steve Gillen, the longtime pastor of the church&#x27;s North Shore campus, was named interim senior pastor in August 2018. In January 2020, it was announced that Gillen would step down in March and that the two candidates who were being considered for the role of senior pastor had been &quot;released&quot; from the search process. Dave Dummitt became senior pastor in June 2020.

According to the ECFA, the church&#x27;s income was nearly $60 million in 2018, $53.2 million in 2019, and $42 million in 2020.

==History==

Willow Creek Community Church started when Bill Hybels and Dave Holmbo were inspired by the success of the South Park Church&#x27;s youth ministry, Son City, of which they were both leaders (Holmbo had invited Hybels to work with him a few years earlier), and aspired to start a church that used relevant biblical teaching, music, and drama. On October 12, 1975, the church met for the first time, renting Willow Creek Theater in Palatine, Illinois. Gilbert Bilezikian was Hybels&#x27; theological mentor. Bilezikian has been &quot;credited with Willow Creek’s inclusion of women in its highest levels of leadership&quot;. In 1977, the church purchased in South Barrington to build its own building. The first service was held in the new building in February 1981. Since then, the building has been doubled in size and the property expanded to . In 2004, it inaugurated a new 7,200-seat auditorium on the same campus.

In September 1978, Bill Hybels learned that Willow Creek&#x27;s co-founder Dave Holmbo &quot;had been involved in a pattern of behaviour that threatened the stability of the staff member&#x27;s personal life and the integrity of the rest of the staff&quot;. He shared this with the elders, who decided to keep it secret from the entire church, and allowed Dave to stay in ministry provided he sought professional counselling and submitted to accountability and monitoring from the elders. In September 1979, the elders confronted Dave with his &quot;ongoing pattern of behaviour and his apparently unrepentant spirit&quot;. Co-founder Dave Holmbo then resigned from his position. This resignation was presented to the church as due to &quot;differing philosophies of ministry&quot;. This cover-up led to an uproar, and over the next 6 months, multiple board members and nearly half the staff left. Insiders came to call this time &quot;The Train Wreck&quot;.

In 2015, the weekly attendance was 25,000 people.

On April 10, 2018, following allegations of sexual abuse, Bill Hybels announced his immediate early retirement as senior pastor of the church; he had previously planned to retire in October of that year. Hybels, who denied the allegations, received a standing ovation from the church upon making this announcement. In August 2018, Steve Gillen—the longtime pastor of the church&#x27;s North Shore campus—was chosen as interim senior pastor. 

In November 2018, CBS News listed Willow Creek Community Church as the fifth largest megachurch in the United States with about 25,743 weekly visitors.

In January 2020, it was announced that Gillen would step down in March and that the two candidates who were being considered for the role of senior pastor had been &quot;released&quot; from the search process. In April 2020, the Elder Board of Willow Creek named Dave Dummitt as the new Senior Pastor.

 the church averaged 18,000 attendees each weekend at seven locations. 

According to a church census released in 2023, it claimed a weekly attendance of 7,740 people. 

==Misconduct allegations and resignations==
On March 23, 2018, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; published an article detailing allegations of sexual misconduct by former Senior Pastor Bill Hybels spanning decades, including a prolonged affair with a married woman, though this was retracted by the woman herself. The &quot;Tribune&quot; wrote that elders of Willow Creek had conducted an internal review of Hybels&#x27; behavior which led to no findings of misconduct, leading to the resignations of at least three leaders of the Willow Creek Association’s board over what they believed to be an insufficient inquiry. All accusations have been denied by Hybels.

Hybels had planned to retire in October 2018 to focus his energy on the Willow Creek Association. On April 10, 2018, Hybels announced that he was moving forward his retirement date effective immediately and stated that he did not want to be a distraction to the church&#x27;s ministry. He also announced he would leave the board of the Willow Creek Association and would no longer lead Willow Creek’s Global Leadership Summit.

On April 21, 2018, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;Christianity Today&quot; reported more misconduct allegations not included in the initial investigation. Church elders received reports of other unwanted sexual comments and advances by Hybels that not been previously investigated by the elder board. The elders indicated they would seek wise counsel and work with experts to investigate the allegations, developing a collaborative process.

On August 5, 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported extensively documented allegations of sexual misconduct against a tenth reported victim that were not included in any previous investigations or reports. Co-lead pastor Steve Carter resigned the same day. The entire elder board and co-lead pastor Heather Larson resigned on August 8, 2018 following a joint apology for mishandling the investigation.

On August 13, 2018, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported the church had paid $3.25 million to settle two lawsuits over child sexual abuse by a church volunteer. Despite the settlements, the church denied any negligence in the two cases.

In September 2018, Willow Creek Community Church and Willow Creek Association announced the formation of what they called an &quot;Independent Advisory Group&quot; to investigate the numerous allegations against their founder. &quot;Religion News Service&quot; reported in December 2018 that the alleged misconduct and admitted mishandling of the allegations had led to a $3 million budget shortfall for 2018, the elimination of 50 full-time positions, a 9% reduction in attendance across all the church&#x27;s campuses, and a reduction in attendance of at least 15% at its main South Barrington Campus.

A six-month independent review of the allegations against Hybels, conducted by four evangelical leaders engaged for that purpose and completed in February 2019, found Hybels&#x27; accusers credible.

In January 2020, the church announced that co-founder Gilbert Bilezikian had &quot;engaged in inappropriate behavior&quot; after a long time church member alleged he had sexually assaulted her a number of times between 1984 and 1988. Bilezikian denied the accusations and said the church had &quot;violated the Bible&#x27;s teaching on dealing with accusations against fellow Christians.&quot; The Elder Board of Willow Creek stated that it had restricted Bilezikian from serving within the church when allegations were brought against him in 2010; in 2015, however, he was honored as a &quot;living legend&quot; of the church. In January 2020, the Elder Response Team asserted that Bilezikian had been restricted from serving in the church, but added that he had continued to teach and serve in various capacities because &quot;the restriction was not adequately communicated&quot;. In May 2020, Bilezikian filed a defamation lawsuit against the church.

==Willow Creek Association==
In 1992, the Willow Creek Association was founded. The WCA develops training and leadership conferences and resources for its member churches. The Willow Creek Association is often confused with Willow Creek Community Church, or mistaken for a denomination. However, it is a distinctly separate organization which has close affiliations with Willow Creek Community Church.

Since 1995, Willow Creek Association has held an annual leadership summit. Speakers at the summit have included President Bill Clinton.

The scandal involving Bill Hybels led to a 36% reduction in revenue for the Willow Creek Association between 2017 and 2018.

<doc id="985090" wikidata="Q7712013" url="?curid=985090" title="The 99p Challenge">
<text>The 99p Challenge is a spoof panel game originally broadcast on BBC Radio 4. The show is presented by Sue Perkins and features a selection of regular panelists such as Armando Iannucci and regular writers Kevin Cecil, Andy Riley, Jon Holmes and Tony Roche. Panelists are given silly tasks by Perkins (in a manner not dissimilar to those given on &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t A Clue&quot; by Humphrey Lyttelton) and are awarded pence for being funny. The player with the most money at the end of the show is given the chance to win 99p. It has been shown in some episodes that the gamble is compulsory, even if the winner has amassed a fortune of more than 99p in the game.

This is the second version of the panel game that was previously transmitted by BBC Radio 4 in 1998 as &quot;King Stupid&quot;. It was then hosted by William Vandyck and featured much the same line-up of comedians and satirists. The contestants were awarded points instead of pence.

==Transmission dates and cast list==
Series of the show continue to be repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra.

== Theme tune ==
The show&#x27;s theme is an excerpt from Alexander Borodin&#x27;s opera &quot;Prince Igor&quot;. The show ends with Nena&#x27;s &quot;99 Luftballons&quot;. After the panellists are introduced, a brief snippet of Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;O Fortuna&quot; from &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; is played.

<doc id="985091" wikidata="Q659096" url="?curid=985091" title="Patek Philippe">
<text>Patek Philippe SA () is a Swiss luxury watchmaker and clock manufacturer, located in the Canton of Geneva and the Vallée de Joux. Established in 1839, it is named after two of its founders, Antoni Patek and Adrien Philippe. Since 1932, the company has been owned by the Stern family in Switzerland and remains the last family-owned independent watch manufacturer in Geneva. Patek Philippe is one of the oldest watch manufacturers in the world with an uninterrupted watchmaking history since its founding. It designs and manufactures timepieces as well as movements, including some of the most complicated mechanical watches. The company maintains over 400 retail locations globally and over a dozen distribution centers across Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania. In 2001, it opened the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva.

Patek Philippe is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious watch manufacturers in the world. As of July 2023, among the world&#x27;s top ten most expensive watches ever sold at auctions, nine were Patek Philippe watches. In particular, Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime Ref. 6300A-010 currently holds the title of the most expensive watch (and wristwatch) ever sold at auction (US$31 million/27 million CHF), while Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication, the world&#x27;s most complicated mechanical watch until 1989, currently holds the title of the most expensive pocket watch ever sold at auction (US$24 million/21 million CHF).

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The company traces its origins to the mid-19th century, when Polish watchmaker Antoni Patek and his Czech-born Polish business partner Franciszek Czapek formed &quot;Patek, Czapek &amp; Cie&quot; in Geneva on 1 May 1839 and started manufacturing pocket watches. The two eventually separated due to disagreements, and the company was liquidated on 18 April 1845. At that point, Czapek founded &quot;Czapek &amp; Cie&quot; on 1 May 1845 with a new partner, Juliusz Gruzewski. Subsequently, Patek was joined by French watchmaker Adrien Philippe, the inventor of the keyless winding mechanism (although this had been discovered previously by Abraham Louis Breguet but not patented by him), and continued the watchmaking business with a new company, &quot;Patek &amp; Cie&quot;, beginning on 15 May 1845&quot;.&quot;

On 1 January 1851, the company&#x27;s name was officially changed to &quot;Patek, Philippe &amp; Cie&quot;. In the same year, Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom acquired a keyless pendant watch at the Great Exhibition in London. The watch was embellished with rose-cut diamonds set in the pattern of a bouquet of flowers. The Queen had another exclusive Patek Philippe timepiece, to be worn pinned to clothing. This watch was suspended from a diamond and enamel brooch. In 1868, Patek Philippe created the first Swiss wristwatch for Countess Koscowicz of Hungary.
In 1875, Adrien Philippe commissioned a watch that he later gave to his daughter Louise as a wedding present, which is known as the only wristwatch dating back to be owned by either Patek or Philippe. This historical watch is known as “The Watchmaker’s Daughter” and was auctioned in 2023 by the descendants of Adrien Philippe. The watch was purchased most probably by the Patek Philippe Museum though this is not confirmed and may be owned by a private collector. The wedding between Louise Philippe and Joseph Antoine Bénassy where the watch was presented is noted as the wedding that helped Patek Philippe survive the founding generation by providing the company with a successor to Antoni Patek.

In March 1877, Antoni Patek died at the age of 65, but his only son, Léon Mecyslas Vincent Patek, did not join the business. As a result, Joseph Antoine Bénassy-Philippe, one of Adrien Philippe&#x27;s sons-in-law, succeeded to Antoni Patek&#x27;s position. In 1887, the cross of one of the four Military Orders of Spain, the Order of Calatrava, became the registered company logo of Patek Philippe as a sympathetic allusion to the still-extant order of Catholic knights that fought the Muslims in the Crusades. In 1891, the 76-year-old Adrien Philippe handed over his position in the business to his youngest son, Joseph Emile Philippe, together with François Antoine Conty. Adrien Philippe died in January 1894.

=== Company restructuring ===
1901 saw the transformation of Patek Philippe into a joint-stock company, &quot;Ancienne Manufacture d&#x27;horlogerie Patek, Philippe &amp; Cie, Société Anonyme,&quot; initiated by J. A. Bénassy-Philippe and Joseph E. Philippe. Still being run as a family business, Patek Philippe then had seven shareholders, five of whom formed the board of directors with J. A. Bénassy-Philippe being the chairman. Joseph E. Philippe&#x27;s son later joined the company, and he was the last offspring of the founders in the business. In 1915, Albert Einstein ordered a gold pocket watch from Patek Philippe; in that year, he completed his Theory of General Relativity.

The Stern family of Switzerland has owned Patek Philippe since 1932, when Charles Stern and Jean Stern acquired the company during the Great Depression. The Stern brothers&#x27; company, &quot;Fabrique de Cadrans Sterns Frères&quot;, had been a business partner of Patek Philippe as its supplier of watch dials. In 1935, Patek Philippe was brought to American markets by New York-based &quot;Henri Stern Watch Agency&quot;, where it was sold as a sister brand alongside Universal Genève.

In 1958, Henri Stern, the son of Charles Stern, became the president of Patek Philippe. Alan Banbery, who previously designed Universal&#x27;s &quot;Compax&quot; movements and worked as a horologist for London&#x27;s Garrard &amp; Co, would take on the position of Director of Sales in 1965 and later authored official reference books on vintage Patek Philippe pocket watches and chronographs.

=== Recent developments ===
In 1993, Philippe Stern, the son of Henri Stern, became the president of the company. He initiated the publication of the twice-a-year &quot;Patek Philippe Magazine&quot; in 1996, which is reserved for the watch owners and has received contributions from various prominent writers including Nobel Laureates Gao Xingjian and José Saramago. 

In 2009, Philippe Stern&#x27;s son, Thierry Stern, took over the reins from his father. In 2010, the company produced 40,000 timepieces and, according to Thierry Stern, it produced 58,000 pieces in 2017. In 2018, the number went up to 62,000, and in order to maintain quality and exclusivity, Patek Philippe would only slowly increase the number of timepieces produced each year (by 1-3 percent per year) but with a ceiling. Currently, the company is an active member of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry FH.

Since the 2000s, Patek Philippe timepieces have repeatedly fetched high prices in auctions worldwide. As of 2023, among the world&#x27;s top ten most expensive watches ever sold at auctions, nine were Patek Philippe watches. Among the top 58 most expensive watches sold at auction (over 2 million US dollars), 46 are Patek Philippe watches. A small part of the demand for auction pieces is driven by Patek Philippe themselves, as they are purchasing in the auction market to add to the collection of the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva.

== Motto and slogan ==
One of Patek Philippe&#x27;s company slogans is &quot;You never actually own a Patek Philippe. You merely look after it for the next generation.&quot; The slogan was introduced when the company launched its &quot;Generations&quot; campaign in 1996.

== Watch manufacturing ==
Patek Philippe manufactures its own watch components. Like other Swiss manufacturers, the company produces mostly mechanical movements with automatic or manual winding mechanism, but has also been producing quartz watches. In fact, Patek Philippe was one of the twenty Swiss watch companies that founded the &quot;Centre Electronique Horloger&quot; and collaboratively developed the first Swiss quartz movements, such as the Beta 21 movement (1969) which was used by several manufacturers in their watches. In 1950s, the company even produced a prototype for a mechanical digital wristwatch, Ref. 3414.

Patek Philippe popularized complications such as perpetual calendar, split-seconds hand, chronograph, and minute repeater in mechanical watches. In 2009, the company announced that all of its future mechanical timepieces would be imprinted with the &quot;Patek Philippe Seal&quot; which requires a precision of -3/+2 seconds per day for diameters no less than 20 mm and -5/+4 seconds per day for diameters less than 20 mm, surpassing the highest industry standard of watch manufacturing and thus abandoning the &quot;Geneva Seal.&quot;

In December 2018, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) released a report assigning environmental ratings for 15 major watch manufacturers and jewelers in Switzerland. Patek Philippe was given the lowest environmental rating as &quot;Latecomers/Non-transparent&quot;, suggesting the manufacturer has taken few actions addressing the impact of its manufacturing activities on the environment and climate change.

* On November 11, 2014, the Henry Graves Supercomplication was sold at Sotheby&#x27;s Geneva Auction for a record-breaking US$23.98 million (CHF 23,237,000), becoming the most expensive watch ever sold at auction and held the title until November 9, 2019. The Supercomplication was made in 1933 for the prominent banker Henry Graves Jr. The ultra-complicated pocket watch (having 24 complications) was the result of Graves&#x27; friendly horological competition with James Ward Packard. After Graves&#x27; death, the watch was held by his daughter, and then by his grandson until 1969, when it was sold to Seth G. Atwood who kept the watch in his renowned &quot;Time Museum&quot; in Rockford, Illinois until 1999. The watch was auctioned for the first time at Sotheby&#x27;s in December 1999 for a record-breaking US$11 million to Sheikh Saud Bin Mohammed Bin Ali Al-Thani of the Qatari royal family.
* On November 12, 2016, a Patek Philippe Ref. 1518 in steel took the title as the most expensive &quot;wristwatch&quot; ever sold at auction (until October 2017). Sold through Phillips&#x27; Geneva auction house, the watch fetched a final price of US$11.14 million (CHF 11,002,000). This was the first time that a steel-case Ref. 1518 (only four were made in steel) went for auction; in fact, this piece was the first of the four steel Ref. 1518 manufactured, which features a chronograph and perpetual calendar.
*On November 9, 2019, Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime Ref. 6300A-010 became the most expensive watch ever sold at auction, fetching US$31 million (CHF 31,000,000) in Christie&#x27;s Geneva auction.
*On December 11, 2021, Patek Philippe Nautilus Ref. 5711 with Tiffany blue dial set a new world record for any wristwatch sold online, realizing US$6.5 million in Phillips New York auction.
*On April 25, 2022, a likely unique Patek Philippe Ref. 2499 – featuring a rare pink-gold case, and even rarer signature on its center subdial from Gobbi, the Milan watch dealer – sold at Sotheby&#x27;s in Hong Kong for $7.68 million (HKD 60,265,000), setting a new record as the most expensive Ref. 2499 ever sold at auction.

=== Calatrava wristwatch ===
In 1932, Patek Philippe launched the first Calatrava model Ref. 96, which was designed by English horologist David Penney who was influenced by the Bauhaus art movement in Germany. Originally, the Stern brothers, soon after they acquired Patek Philippe in 1932, introduced the Calatrava to help the company pass through the Great Depression smoothly.

The original Calatrava Ref. 96 was in production for more than 40 years, and its successor models include Ref. 2526, Ref. 3520, Ref. 5196 and so on. Known for its simple and elegant design, the Calatrava wristwatch has been a flagship model of Patek Philippe since its introduction. Notably, the &quot;Calatrava Cross&quot; has been company&#x27;s logo since 1887.
=== World Time wristwatch ===
Patek Philippe World Time (&quot;Heures Universelles&quot;) collection was introduced in 1939, with Ref.1415 being the first model. The &quot;World Time&quot; complication is able to show the time for all 24 time zones on the same watch and was invented by Swiss watchmaker Louis Cottier in 1931. Cottier&#x27;s invention attracted several watchmaking companies, while Patek Philippe was the first company to introduce a series of World Time wristwatches after forging a partnership with Mr. Cottier. The successors to Ref. 1415 include Ref. 2523, Ref. 5230, Ref. 5531 (with minute repeater), and so on.

As of 2018, Patek Philippe World Time collection (Ref. 1415, Ref. 2523) holds 6 spots among the 58 world&#x27;s most expensive watches sold at auction (over 2 million US dollars), with the world record being 4.027 million US dollars (6,603,500 CHF) made at Antiquorum&#x27;s Geneva auction on April 13, 2002.
=== Nautilus wristwatch ===
In 1976, Patek Philippe introduced the Nautilus collection after deciding it was time to produce an exclusive sport watch with finishes of the highest quality. The first model was Ref. 3700 and was made of steel. It was designed by Swiss watchmaker Gérald Genta, who previously designed the Royal Oak collection for Audemars Piguet, and was released by Patek Philippe during the quartz crisis in the hope that it would help re-attract people&#x27;s attention to high-end Swiss mechanical watches.

The Nautilus collection played a key role in Patek Philippe&#x27;s overall marketing strategy as it had to refresh the brand image while perpetuating tradition. The target was represented by dynamic business managers of the new generations. The Nautilus wristwatch has become one of the most popular collections from Patek Philippe, and the Ref. 5711 &amp; 5712 models, which the company introduced in 2006 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the collection, are among the most popular models.

=== Aquanaut wristwatch ===
In 1997, Patek Philippe introduced the Aquanaut collection, marking a departure from their traditional dress watches. The Aquanaut was designed as a luxury sports watch for a younger generation of watch enthusiasts, featuring a contemporary and sporty aesthetic alongside the refined craftsmanship that Patek Philippe is known for.

The first Aquanaut model, the Ref. 5060A, was crafted from stainless steel and equipped with a black dial and a black rubber strap. This signature rubber strap, a first for Patek Philippe, was composed of a new composite material designed for durability and comfort. The Aquanaut collection has grown to encompass a variety of models in stainless steel, rose gold, and white gold, with additional complications like chronograph and travel time functions.

The Aquanaut has become a highly successful collection for Patek Philippe, known for its blend of sportiness, luxury, and everyday wearability.

=== Perpetual calendar chronograph ===
Patek Philippe perpetual calendar chronograph was introduced in 1941, with Ref. 1518 being the first model. On November 12, 2016, a Ref. 1518 in steel became the most expensive wristwatch ever sold at auction (until October 2017), fetching a record-breaking US$11.14 million (11,002,000 CHF) in Geneva (through Phillips&#x27; auction house).

As the successor, Ref. 2499 is widely considered to be one of the greatest watch models in the world. Historically, only 349 pieces of Ref. 2499 were made from 1950 to 1985 - around 9 pieces each year. Over the course of 35 years, four series of Ref. 2499 were introduced, exerting a strong influence on the watch designs of many other renowned watchmakers. As of June 2019, Ref. 2499 holds eleven spots among the 59 world&#x27;s most expensive watches sold at auction (over 2 million US dollars) and at least 18 pieces of Ref. 2499 have been auctioned for more than 1.5 million US dollars, with the world record being 3.880 million US dollars (3,915,000 CHF) made at Sotheby&#x27;s Geneva auction on November 13, 2018. The successors to Ref. 2499 include, in chronological order, Ref. 3970, Ref. 5970 and Ref. 5270.

=== Sky Moon Tourbillon ===

Patek Philippe Sky Moon Tourbillon wristwatch was introduced in 2001, with Ref. 5002 being the first model. The wristwatch has two dials and contains 12 complications including tourbillon, minute repeater, sky chart, and moon phase &amp; orbit. In 2013, the company introduced the second model of Sky Moon Tourbillon, Ref. 6002, also with 12 complications. The new model took 7 years of research and development, while the engraving on each piece alone took more than 100 hours.

Sky Moon Tourbillon was the most complicated wristwatch from Patek Philippe until 2014. It is estimated that only 3 - 5 pieces are made each year, and the price for each piece is over US$1.2 million. However, every purchase of the piece requires an application from the buyer and has to be approved by Patek Philippe President Thierry Stern. On October 2, 2018, a Sky Moon Tourbillon 6002G was auctioned by Poly Auction in Hong Kong, fetching US$2.707 million (HKD 21,240,000), making it one of the most expensive watches ever sold in auction.

===150th anniversary edition===
In 1989, Patek Philippe created Calibre 89, then the most complicated mechanical watch ever made, for its 150th anniversary. Calibre 89 holds 33 complications, including the date of Easter, time of sunrise, equation of time, sidereal time, and many other indicators. 1,728 unique parts allow sidereal time, a 2,800 star chart, and more. In addition, Calibre 89 is able to add a day to February for leap years while leaving out the extra day for every 100 year interval.

Only four pieces of Calibre 89 were ever manufactured by Patek Philippe, with one in white gold, one in yellow gold, one in rose gold, and one in platinum. The yellow-gold and the white-gold Calibre 89 were sold at auctions by Antiquorum in 2009 and 2004, respectively, and both watches currently rank among the top ten most expensive watches ever sold at auction, with final prices over 5 million US dollars.

=== 175th anniversary edition ===
In 2014, Patek Philippe introduced the Grandmaster Chime Ref. 5175, the most complicated wristwatch ever built by the manufacturer (with 20 complications, but no tourbillon), to celebrate its 175th anniversary. Only seven pieces of Ref. 5175 were created, with one permanently residing in the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva. The sale price for each of the other six pieces was 2.5 million CHF (2.6 million US dollars).

In 2016, Patek Philippe introduced the Grandmaster Chime Ref. 6300, succeeding the Grandmaster Chime Ref. 5175. Ref. 6300 also has 20 complications, including grande sonnerie, minute repeater, and alarm with time strike (but without tourbillon), with the sale price over 2.2 million US dollars. The purchase of each piece requires an application from the buyer and has to be approved by Patek Philippe President Thierry Stern.

=== Cubitus wristwatch===
In 2024, Patek Philippe introduces a new collection called Cubitus, presenting an exclusive interpretation of the “casual chic” style.

<text>William Hybels (born December 12, 1951) is an American church figure and author. He is the founding and former senior pastor of Willow Creek Community Church in South Barrington, Illinois, one of the most attended churches in North America, with an average attendance of nearly 24,000 as of late 2018. He is the founder of the Willow Creek Association and creator of the Global Leadership Summit. Hybels is also an author of a number of Christian books, especially on the subject of Christian leadership.

Hybels was slated to retire from his position at Willow Creek in October 2018; however, he resigned in April 2018 after allegations of sexual misconduct were made against him. Although Hybels has denied all allegations, an independent review found the allegations to be credible.

==Early life and education==

Hybels was born and raised in Kalamazoo, Michigan. He is Dutch-American and grew up participating in the Christian Reformed Church in North America. Hybels&#x27;s father was an entrepreneur in wholesale produce whose work ethic was the model for his son. In a 2006 interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, he pointed to an experience at a Wisconsin summer camp as a teenager that crystallized his understanding and personal embrace of Christian belief. Hybels holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Biblical Studies from Trinity International University, near Chicago.

==Willow Creek Community Church==
In the early 1970s, Hybels was studying at Trinity International University (then called Trinity College) when Gilbert Bilezikian, a lecturer, challenged the class about an Acts 2-based church. Hybels was captivated with the vision and abandoned his business aspirations for ministry.

In 1971, Hybels—then serving as youth pastor at South Park Church in Park Ridge, Illinois—started a youth group with friend Dave Holmbo called &#x27;Son City&#x27;. Modern music, dramatic skits and multimedia were combined with Bible studies in relevant language, and the group grew from 25 to 1,200 in just three years.

After 300 youth waited in line for a service in May 1974, Hybels and other leaders began dreaming of forming a new church. They surveyed the community to find out why people weren&#x27;t coming to church. Common answers were reported to be: &quot;church is boring&quot;, &quot;they&#x27;re always asking for money&quot;, or &quot;I don&#x27;t like being preached down to.&quot; These answers shaped the group&#x27;s approach to the new church.

On October 12, 1975, the group held its first service at Willow Creek Theater in Palatine, Illinois. One hundred and twenty-five people attended the service. The rent and other costs were paid for with 1,200 baskets of tomatoes, sold door-to-door by 100 teenagers. Hybels spoke on &quot;New Beginnings&quot;. Within two years, the church had grown to 2,000.

Challenges in 1979 led to a recommissioning of the church&#x27;s vision to be broader and deeper than before. Hybels apologized for the example of his relentless schedule and overemphasis on grace. &quot;We&#x27;ve set up all our leadership structures and goals to grow a full functioning Acts 2 community, as opposed to just an evangelizing machine that doesn&#x27;t drive the roots down deep and do all the other things it&#x27;s supposed to do.&quot;

In 1981, the church moved to its current location in South Barrington. By 2000, six services were being held each weekend for 15,000 attendees in a building. Starting in 1998 Hybels acted as a spiritual advisor to then-President Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. In 2004, a new Worship Center was opened. With a capacity of more than 7,000, the state-of-the-art auditorium is one of the largest theaters in the United States. In 2017, the church averaged 25,000 attendees per week, making it the eighth largest church in America, according to Outreach 100. In September 2018, Religion News Service reported attendance was down 9% across all campuses, following scandal involving founder Bill Hybels and resignation of the entire senior leadership team.

On July 1, 2010, Hybels introduced President Barack Obama for a speech on immigration reform.

Hybels was not heavily involved in the church&#x27;s day-to-day operations between mid-2006 and 2008. Gene Appel served as lead pastor of the South Barrington Campus from mid-2006 until Easter 2008. Appel&#x27;s role allowed Hybels the ability to serve a more direct role in the Willow Creek Association.

==The Global Leadership Summit==
Hybels started the Global Leadership Summit (hosted by the Global Leadership Network (GLN) (rebranded from Willow Creek Association in 2018)) in 1995 as an annual training event for leaders to sharpen their skills. The summit telecasts live from the campus of Willow Creek Community Church, with 118,000 people watching via livestream at host sites across the U.S. in 2018, and hundreds of thousands more later watching via video in countries around the world. The Summit lost more than 100 host sites and tens of thousands of viewers in 2018 following the Hybels&#x27; scandal.

==Misconduct allegations and resignation==

On March 23, 2018, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; published an article detailing allegations of sexual misconduct by Hybels spanning decades. The article reported that Hybels had engaged in a prolonged affair with a married woman; however, this allegation was retracted by the woman herself. The &quot;Tribune&quot; wrote that the elders of Willow Creek had conducted an internal review of Hybels&#x27; behavior which led to no findings of misconduct; following this report, at least three leaders of the Willow Creek Association board reportedly resigned their posts because they believed the inquiry to have been insufficient. All accusations have been denied by Hybels.

Hybels had planned to retire in October 2018 to focus his energy on the Willow Creek Association. On April 10, 2018, Hybels announced that he was resigning, effective immediately, stating he did not want to be a distraction to the church&#x27;s ministry. He also announced that he would leave the board of the Willow Creek Association and would no longer lead Willow Creek&#x27;s Global Leadership Summit.

On April 21, 2018, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;Christianity Today&quot; reported further misconduct allegations which were not part of the initial investigation. In response, the Willow Creek elders stated their intent to examine reports regarding &quot;allegations that have not been previously investigated by the Elder Board&quot;. The elders said they would seek wise counsel and work with experts, developing a collaborative process.

Despite its initial denial and defense of Hybels, the Willow Creek Board of Elders released a statement on May 9, 2018, as part of their second investigation into allegations against him; the statement indicated that the Board &quot;[does] not believe the stories were all lies or that all the [accusers] were colluding against him.&quot;

On August 5, 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published allegations from a former employee of Hybels, who alleges that he repeatedly sexually harassed and assaulted her in the 1980s, including fondling her breasts and obtaining oral sex. The complainant only came forward after hearing of the other allegations against Hybels, but crucially had contemporaneous evidence of her allegations from people in whom she confided at the time. Hybels denied the allegations.

On August 7, 2018, Steve Carter, one of the two lead pastors who would have taken over leadership at Willow Creek and who had publicly defended Hybels on two prior occasions, tendered his resignation, citing the untenable position he was in given the church&#x27;s inadequate attention to the matter once Hybels&#x27; history of misconduct became known. The following day, on the eve of the Global Leadership Summit, Heather Larson, the other lead pastor, also resigned, and the members of the elder board all stated they would step down by the end of the year. Steve Gillen, lead pastor of Willow Creek&#x27;s North Shore campus, assumed interim leadership. The church undertook a process to replace the elder board, and announced on January 19, 2019, that a new elder board had been installed.

In March 2019, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that a six-month independent review by four evangelical leaders found the misconduct allegations against Hybels to be credible. The reviewers asserted that were Hybels still pastor at Willow Creek, disciplinary action would be required.

In January 2020, the church announced that Hybels&#x27; mentor, Gilbert Bilezikian had also engaged in &quot;inappropriate behavior&quot; after a church member alleged he had sexually assaulted her over a number of years.

<text>Giorgio Armani S.p.A. (), commonly known as Armani, is an Italian luxury fashion house founded in Milan by Giorgio Armani which designs, manufactures, distributes and retails haute couture, ready-to-wear, leather goods, shoes, accessories, and home interiors. Among others, Armani licenses its name and branding to Luxottica for eyewear and L&#x27;Oréal for fragrances and cosmetics. It is considered Italy&#x27;s third-biggest fashion group behind Gucci and Prada.

In addition to the couture line Armani Privé, Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani are the company&#x27;s ready-to-wear lines that show at Milan Fashion Week. Selling at lower prices are Armani Collezioni, Armani Exchange and Armani Jeans.

==History==
Armani and his partner, architect Sergio Galeotti, founded Giorgio Armani SpA in 1975, reportedly on money from the sale of Armani&#x27;s Volkswagen.

Armani signed a license with Gruppo Finanziario Tessile (GFT) in 1978. The company also entered into a manufacturing and distribution license with Simint in 1991 when the company launched A|X Armani Exchange. By 1993, the Armani name was represented by 23 licensees and two large joint ventures in Japan.

By the 1990s, the company&#x27;s strategy was to cancel licenses and take production in-house in a bid to exert more control over quality and distribution. Manufacturing arrangements later brought back in-house include the acquisition of Antinea (1990), Simint (1996) and Intai (1998). In 2000, after buying factories from GFT, Armani formed a joint venture with Zegna for the production and distribution of the Collezioni men&#x27;s collection. Armani also increased to 85 percent of its share in the joint venture in Japan with Itochu.

In 2001, Armani commissioned architect Tadao Ando to transform an old Nestlé chocolate factory in Milan&#x27;s Savona/Tortona area into the company&#x27;s headquarters.

Also in the early 2000s, Armani opened five megastores designed by Massimiliano and Doriana Fuksas, starting with the opening of the Armani/Manzoni store in Milan in 2000, which carries all of the company&#x27;s brands. Other such venues are in Hong Kong (Armani/Chater House, opened in 2002), Munich (Armani/Fünf Höfe, opened in 2003), Tokyo (Armani/Ginza Tower, opened in 2007) and New York City (Armani/Fifth Avenue, opened in 2009).

In 2002, Armani announced a new joint venture with the shoe manufacturer I Guardi, as part of a strategy of bringing manufacturing under its control. Beginning in 2007, the company teamed up with Samsung to develop a line of high-end electronic goods.

In 2007, Giorgio Armani confirmed to &quot;Reuters&quot; that he had been approached by Beiersdorf in 2005 about a potential merger but had since been too distracted by other projects to pursue that option. In 2016, he confirmed he had established the Giorgio Armani Foundation which, while aiming to fund social projects, is also to &quot;safeguard the governance assets of the Armani Group and ensure that these assets are kept stable over time.&quot; As part of his succession plan, the foundation will own an undisclosed stake in the company, with the rest going to his family. By 2017, the company was seen as a prime candidate for a stock market listing. In 2021, Giorgio Armani ruled out merging with either LVMH or Kering and reportedly also ruled out an offer by Stellantis to acquire a minority stake.

In February 2020, Armani was the first fashion brand to decide to close its runway shows to the public amid the beginning COVID-19 pandemic, holding the event without an audience. By March 2020, all of its Italian production plants started producing single-use medical overalls.

In 2021, luxury yacht maker The Italian Sea Group announced that Giorgio Armani SpA would invest in the company&#x27;s IPO at the Italian Bourse.

Despite promising to suspend investments in Russia, Giorgio Armani continues to operate in the country amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While the brand held a silent Milan Fashion Week show in February 2022 as a &quot;sign of respect&quot; for Ukraine, it has not reduced its activities or signaled plans to exit the Russian market. This ongoing presence has drawn criticism as international sanctions target Russia for its aggression and the killing of civilians in Ukraine. Giorgio Armani is among several European companies that remain operational in Russia, sparking questions about their ethical and corporate responsibilities during the conflict.

The &quot;Armani&quot; label also consists of a furniture and home collection called &quot;Armani/Casa&quot;. While the Italian word &quot;casa&quot; usually means &quot;house&quot;, its usage here instead means &quot;at home&quot;. Giorgio Armani launched his interior design collection in 2000 with a flagship store opening in Milan, Italy the same year. When Armani was asked about why he wanted a furniture line, Armani said that he wanted &quot;people to design their own private home&quot;. &quot;Designing this furniture and home collection helped me to stimulate my creative and artistic vein&quot;, Armani said. Critics responded very positively to the &quot;Armani/Casa&quot; label calling the style &quot;simply elegant, a little retro with Ethno elements&quot; to it. A lot of critics also liked the fact that there are only a &quot;few ornaments&quot; used but with &quot;artistic detail&quot; which seems to have a &quot;tremendous effect on the style and furniture&quot; itself.

Armani collaborates with &quot;Rubelli&quot; and the &quot;Molteni&quot; Group to build the home collection. As the &quot;Architectural Digest&quot; reported in February 2012, &quot;Armani/Casa&quot; includes state-of-the-art kitchens, sold under the &quot;Armani/Dada&quot; name – a partnership with &quot;Molteni&quot; Group, as well as luxurious fabrics produced in collaboration with &quot;Rubelli&quot;. &quot;Armani/Roca&quot; is a partnership with Roca, which provides Giorgio Armani with bathroom furniture and accessories. The sub-label consisting of variegated products is sold in 183 independent &quot;Armani&quot; stores as well as selected retailers throughout the world.

&quot;Armani/Casa&quot; is used in the &quot;Armani&quot; hotels, equipped John Mayers New York City apartment and decorated the scenes for the 2013 film &quot;Paranoia&quot;.

As part of a restructuring in 2017, Armani Casa – alongside Giorgio Armani Privé – was folded into Giorgio Armani.

===Armani/Dolci===
Confectionery is also under the &quot;Armani&quot; name. The brand was established in 2002. For the creations and collections, &quot;Armani&quot; collaborates with the Italian chocolate manufacturer &quot;Guido Gobino&quot;.

&quot;Armani/Dolci&quot; sells chocolates, jams, honey, tea, shortbread biscuits, sugar and pralines. The brand is mostly part of other &quot;Armani&quot; stores but has an independent boutique in Taichung, Taiwan. In total, 152 stores sell &quot;Armani/Dolci&quot; products.

Over the years, Armani created various limited &quot;Armani/Dolci&quot; products to celebrate special occasions. For example, Armani designed chocolate Easter eggs, heart-shaped boxes with red, pink and lilac chocolate truffles for Valentine&#x27;s Day, as well as a Ramadan collection for the Muslim holiday featuring refined colors of Islamic art and no alcohol. In addition, &quot;Armani/Dolci&quot; sells special delicate collections for Christmas and its significant anniversaries.

The Armani/Dolci brand is well received by both critics and the public.

===Armani/Fiori===
The Giorgio Armani label also has a florist under its name, called &quot;Armani/Fiori&quot;. The exclusive floral service has been active since 2000 in major independent flower boutiques and other &quot;Armani&quot; stores around the world.

The flowers used for the &quot;Armani/Fiori&quot; arrangements come mostly from the Netherlands. The label uses a large selection of orchids, as well as exotic and tropical flowers alongside more traditional flowers such as hydrangeas, roses and peonies. Each collection is personally designed by Giorgio Armani himself as he wants to transport an &quot;Asian feel&quot;. In addition, &quot;Armani/Fiori&quot; offers decorative elements like vases, flowerpots, candles and lanterns. For the collections, Armani uses precious materials like alabaster, black marble, and lacquered wood in the shape of cylinders, cubes, and rhomboids. Giorgio Armani also designed special floral arrangements for occasions like Valentine&#x27;s Day and spring collections. The label&#x27;s floral arrangements are used in the &quot;Armani&quot; hotels.

===Armani/Hotels===
Giorgio Armani and Emaar Properties PJSC signed an agreement in 2005 for Emaar Properties PJSC to build and operate at least seven luxury hotels and three vacation resorts under the &quot;Armani&quot; name. Armani would be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the interior design and style of the hotels. The &quot;Armani&quot; Hotel was opened in Burj Khalifa on April 27, 2010, comprising the bottom 39 floors of the supertall skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It has 160 guest rooms and suites, and 144 residences. Giorgio Armani also designed the interiors of the &quot;Armani&quot; Residences, also within the skyscraper, and its specially designed line of products from the &quot;Armani/Casa&quot; home furnishings collection and the &quot;Armani/Fiori&quot; flower arrangements. The &quot;Burj Khalifa Armani Residences Road Show&quot; toured Milan, London, Jeddah, Moscow and New Delhi. The London event was housed in the Armani Casa Showroom in New Bond Street.

The second club opened in 2011 in Milan. The hotel is located in a palazzo on Via Manzoni in the heart of the city.

=== Armani/Privé Club ===
Armani operates two luxury clubs under the Armani/Privé name in both Milan and Dubai. According to its website, &quot;Armani/Privé prides itself on primely located clubs at the cutting edge of the city&#x27;s nightlife scene, setting the bar high by attracting internationally acclaimed resident DJs that play the latest beats to a carefully selected crowd, sipping on signature cocktails.&quot;

=== Luggage ===
In 1994, Giorgio Armani signed a license agreement with Redwall to produce and distribute bags and small leather luggage products for the Borgonuovo, Giorgio Armani Collezioni and Emporio Armani lines. In 2008, Giorgio Armani launched its Luxury Traveller Collection of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s handcrafted luggage.

=== Jewelry ===
In 2019, Giorgio Armani Privé Haute Jewellery made its debut in New York. The same year, Giorgio Armani presented its first high jewelry collection. The 2022 &quot;Josephine&quot; collection, inspired by Joséphine de Beauharnais, incorporated paisley motifs with chalcedony and grey diamonds. His fine jewelry has since been worn by celebrities, including Sophia Loren, Brie Larson, and Brooke Shields, at high-profile events.

== Social responsibility ==
In 2006, Emporio Armani became a partner of the global Product Red initiative, founded by Bono and Bobby Shriver to fight AIDS in Africa. In 2011, the Acqua For Life project was launched, in collaboration with Giorgio Armani Parfums, Green Cross International, and UNICEF: for every bottle of Acqua di Giò sold, $1 is donated, up to $50,000, to the UNICEF &quot;UNICEF Tab Project&quot;, which aims to provide clean water to children in African countries. Finally, in conjunction with the Cannes Film Festival in 2012, an important collaboration with J/P HRO (Haitian Relief Organization) was launched.

The Armani fashion house was one of the first to support international guidelines for a concept of sustainable fashion at the social and environmental level, starting to work on a production system that can protect the health of the planet, focusing on the production of garments that can be durable over time.

In 2020, Giorgio Armani was awarded the &quot;Fashion Dresses Peace&quot; award, a public recognition awarded to authoritative figures who have distinguished themselves for their commitment to inclusion or against discrimination and racism, promoted by the African Fashion Gate social promotion association.

In 2020, Giorgio Armani donated a total of €2,000,000 to several Italian hospitals (Luigi Sacco, San Raffaele and Institute of Oncology hospitals in Milan, Spallanzani in Rome, Humanitas Gavazzeni in Bergamo, Guglielmo di Saliceto in Piacenza, Versilia in Lido di Camaiore) and to the Civil Protection to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and converted its production facilities into facilities for the production of disposable gowns.

==Sponsoring and philanthropy==
In 2015, Armani opened Armani/Silos, an exhibition space in Milan that has in the past staged solo exhibitions of Larry Fink (2017), Sarah Moon (2018), Paolo Ventura (2018), Tadao Ando (2019) and Peter Lindbergh (2020).

Armani Beauty has been a major supporter of the Venice Film Festival since 2018 and was the event&#x27;s main sponsor in 2019. On 2021, Armani introduced a new special award for the Festival, the &quot;Audience Award - Armani beauty, Orizzonti Extra&quot;. In that edition, one of the brand&#x27;s sponsor actresses was Laura Haddock, who took part in the campaign created by Harper&#x27;s Bazaar and ORBIS Production.

Also in 2019, A|X Armani Exchange became the first fashion brand to debut in the world of e-sports — professional multiplayer video game competitions — when it sponsored the Italian team Makers for the 2019–20 season.

Among others, Armani designed suits for Italy&#x27;s delegations to the 2009 FINA World Aquatics Championships and the 2012 Summer Olympics as well as for the country&#x27;s national football team at the UEFA Euro 2020. Since 2021, the company has been a sponsor of the Scuderia Ferrari, supplying formal attire and travel wear to the Ferrari team&#x27;s management, drivers and technicians to be worn at official events and during transfers linked to Formula One&#x27;s Grand Prix international races. The company also makes kits for Serie A football side Napoli under its EA7 brand. On the basket side, is the title sponsor and kit supplier of Olimpia Milano and from the 2023 -2024 season also became the official kit supplier of Blu Basket 1971.
At the ATP Tour circuit, Armani dressed so many professional players like Simone Bolelli, Fabio Fognini and Lorenzo Sonego.

==Sustainability==
Armani banned animal fur in 2016 and signed in the &quot;Fashion Pact&quot; with other major industry players to address climate change in 2019. In 2021, the Group enhanced its Sustainability Department by employing a Group Director and launching a new sustainability strategy based on the three pillars &quot;People, Planet, Prosperity&quot;. The Group has defined concrete objectives within the company and along the entire value chain, in line with the ESG approach (Environmental, Social, Governance) and with the objectives of the Fashion Pact joined in 2019. They have launched sustainable capsules with yarns and fabrics made of materials such as recycled polyester and organic cotton. Moreover, they communicated their commitment to no longer using angora wool starting from the 2022-23 Autumn/Winter season.

==Controversy==
In 1999, the &quot;New York Times&quot; and others raised concerns about a generous donation made by Giorgio Armani SpA to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York shortly before the museum announced that it would pay homage to Armani himself with a major retrospective of his work.

In a 2014 report, Greenpeace publicly criticized Armani and other luxury brands after having found traces of chemicals that can pollute waterways in children&#x27;s clothing and shoes; in response, the company committed to abolishing all chemicals that could cause environmental damage to production sites by 2020. Also in 2014, Giorgio Armani SpA paid 270 million euros to Italian tax authorities to settle a dispute over payments from the group&#x27;s subsidiaries abroad.

In 2015, Giorgio Armani Corp&#x27;s former general counsel Fabio Silva filed a $75 million lawsuit in the New York Supreme Court against the company, accusing it of discriminating against him because of his Mexican origins and firing him for having cancer.

On July 17, 2024, the Italian competition authority, Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM), announced the launch of an investigation into Armani and Dior. The probe aims to determine whether these companies potentially misled consumers regarding their labor practices and supply chain management. Prosecutors claim to have discovered workshops on the outskirts of Milan where mostly illegal immigrant workers sold products to Armani as well as Dior for a fraction of their retail price.

<doc id="985100" wikidata="Q250252" url="?curid=985100" title="Flaming Star">
<text>Flaming Star is a 1960 American Western film starring Elvis Presley, Barbara Eden, and Steve Forrest, based on the book &quot;Flaming Lance&quot; (1958) by Clair Huffaker. Critics agreed that Presley gave one of his better acting performances as the mixed-blood &quot;Pacer Burton&quot;, a dramatic role. The film was directed by Don Siegel and had a working title of &quot;Black Star&quot;.

The film reached number 12 on the box-office charts.

It was filmed in Utah and Los Angeles, as well as in Wildwood Regional Park in Thousand Oaks, California. A road near Wildwood in Thousand Oaks has been named Flaming Star Avenue after the movie.

==Plot==
Pacer Burton is the son of a Kiowa mother and a Texan father working as a rancher. His family, including a half-brother, Clint, live a typical life on the Texan frontier. Life becomes anything but typical when a nearby tribe of Kiowa begin raiding neighboring homesteads. Pacer soon finds himself caught between the two worlds, part of both, but belonging to neither.

==Cast==

* Elvis Presley as Pacer Burton
* Barbara Eden as Roslyn Pierce
* Steve Forrest as Clint Burton
* Dolores del Río as Neddy Burton
* John McIntire as Sam &quot;Pa&quot; Burton
* L. Q. Jones as Tom Howard
* Douglas Dick as Will Howard
* Richard Jaeckel as Angus Pierce
* Rodolfo Acosta as Buffalo Horn
* Karl Swenson as Dred Pierce
* Ford Rainey as Doc Phillips

==Production==
===Development===
The film was based on Clare Huffaker&#x27;s novel &quot;Flaming Lance&quot;, which was published in 1958.

Film rights were purchased by 20th Century Fox and Nunally Johnson was assigned to write the script. It was originally titled &quot;The Brothers of Flaming Arrow&quot;, then &quot;Flaming Lance&quot;. In May 1958, Fox announced that a film version would start shooting the following month. Johnson later recalled that the studio &quot;said they couldn&#x27;t make it because it would cost too much for a Western and a Western couldn&#x27;t get in as much as it would cost, something like that.&quot;

Huffaker was asked to make rewrites. &quot;I took two weeks rewriting the script and only ten days of the book,&quot; he said. &quot;I hate to say it, but in rewriting the script, I think it makes a better story than my original.&quot;

Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando were originally slated to play the brothers before Fox decided to cast Presley in the lead role. Presley&#x27;s previous film, &quot;G.I. Blues&quot;, had been a success at the box office and had led to one of his best-selling albums. Determined to be taken seriously as an actor, though, Presley asked for roles with fewer songs.

&quot;Physically he&#x27;s right,&quot; said producer David Weisbart, who had produced Presley&#x27;s first film, &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;. &quot;His Army training and the athletic interests he picked up there have left him in superb condition. He probably always was graceful... but now his grace is trained and refined and developed. What&#x27;s more his slight Mississippi accent is no problem in a film set in West Texas.&quot;

Director Don Siegel shot tests with Presley wearing dark contact lenses, but decided that they detracted from Presley&#x27;s acting too much and discarded them.

Fox insisted on the addition of four songs. &quot;We aren&#x27;t courageous enough to present him without any songs at all,&quot; said Weisbart. &quot;We&#x27;ve spotted them [the songs] where they&#x27;d come in naturally,&quot; said Weisbart. &quot; At a frontier party, at an encampment, and during a horseback ride over the plains.&quot;

Fox wanted a theme song, so Huffaker changed the title to &quot;Black Star&quot;, which he felt would be more fitting for a song than &quot;Flaming Lance&quot; would be. He concocted an old Indian legend about a black star. &quot;It was OK to change the title and have a song written about a star,&quot; he said.

Presley recorded a theme song, but it was later rerecorded as &quot;Flaming Star&quot;, using the same words and melody.

&quot;Flaming Star&quot; was initially to include four songs. Siegel wished that Presley not appear &quot;professional&quot; in those scenes: &quot;He should have an awkwardness and an absence of the Presley mannerisms.&quot; Eventually, Presley demanded that two songs be removed, leaving just the title song and a short number at the opening birthday party scene. Despite Presley&#x27;s aforementioned desire to make films with fewer songs, this would be the last of his films to have a minimal number of songs until the 1969 release, &quot;Charro!&quot;, coincidentally his next western, had only a title song featured.

Johnson was contacted when abroad by Huffaker, who had written the original novel. He told Johnson that Presley was cast and wanted know if Johnson objected to Huffaker having credit on the script. &quot;I&#x27;d always objected to that, but I couldn&#x27;t say no to the guy,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;He didn&#x27;t do anything, as he admitted. I was wondering what in God&#x27;s name they would do with Elvis Presley in this. All they did was put in a kind of a hoedown dance and Presley sang a song at the opening and then they went right on into the picture.&quot;

===Shooting===
Filming started in August 1960. Parts of the film were shot in Delle, Lone Rock, and Skull Valley in Utah. Filming also took place at Rancho El Conejo in Thousand Oaks, California.

Barbara Steele, originally signed to play the love interest, was replaced during filming by Barbara Eden after studio executives decided that Steele&#x27;s British accent was too pronounced, though Steele claims that she had quit.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was released only one month after &quot;G.I. Blues&quot;, but did not achieve the same degree of box-office success, reaching number 12 on the &quot;Variety&quot; box-office survey for the year.

===Critical receptions===
The film received generally positive reviews, with a few critics lauding Presley&#x27;s performance and noting his improvement as an actor. A. H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film as &quot;an unpretentious but sturdy Western that takes the time, the place and the people seriously.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called the plot &quot;disturbingly familiar and not altogether convincing, but the film, attractively mounted and consistently diverting, will entertain and absorb the audience it is tailored for.&quot;

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; graded it &quot;Very good,&quot; calling Presley &quot;believable&quot; and John McIntire &quot;a powerful figure.&quot; Charles Stinson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; appraised the film as &quot;standard for its type — the half-breed tragedy — but done well enough to head a program double bill.&quot; Stinson wrote of Presley that &quot;he seems to be improving noticeably with every film. He has, of course, rather a distance yet to go to dramatic power and polish. But &#x27;Flaming Star&#x27; and &#x27;G.I. Blues&#x27; are a long way up from &#x27;Jailhouse Rock.&#x27;&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; criticized the film for &quot;flat, one-syllable dialogue&quot; and &quot;ruthless predictability,&quot; though he found some of the outdoor shots &quot;handsome.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that although the film &quot;never really gets beyond the comic-strip weepie stage,&quot; director Siegel &quot;has managed to communicate considerable excitement through flashes of imaginative cutting and handsome composition, notably in the first Indian attack, and in some realistically staged fight, chase and battle passages ... But Siegel&#x27;s main achievement is his direction of Elvis Presley, still basically not an actor, but no longer a joke as a screen personality. Given the full, virile build-up, he plays the half-breed with a brooding presence that is surprisingly effective.&quot;

Johnson eventually saw the film and said he &quot;liked it very much.&quot; He thought Siegel &quot;did a first-rate job and also Presley did.&quot;

Quentin Tarantino later called the film &quot;a truly great &#x27;50s Western, and maybe the most brutally violent American Western of its era.&quot;

===Effect on some African countries and territories===
According to an Associated Press report from Johannesburg dated May 31, 1961, South Africans were initially not permitted to see the film. The government, which had strict laws to keep the races separate, banned the picture that same day because Presley &quot;played the son of an American Indian woman and a white man.&quot; A day later, 20th Century Fox appealed, convincing the South Africa Board of Censors to lift the ban as long as it would not be shown to the country&#x27;s indigenous population. The film then opened to segregated theaters, starting in Durban in early June. However, it was permanently banned in cinemas in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, as colonial government officials in those British territories were concerned that the movie could reignite racial tensions in the aftermath of the recent Mau Mau uprising.

===Artistic legacy/Andy Warhol silkscreens===

A publicity still from the film was used by Andy Warhol to create several silkscreens, among them numerous versions of &quot;Single Elvis&quot;, &quot;Double Elvis&quot;, &quot;Elvis x 2&quot; 
and &quot;Elvis I and I&quot;, as well as an &quot;Eight Elvises&quot;, and at least four &quot;Triple Elvis&quot; paintings, an &quot;Elvis 4 Times&quot; and the largest, &quot;Elvis Times Eleven&quot;, which is currently housed at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. Sales generated by at least 11 of these silkscreens through auction houses or in private sales are, as of May 13, 2021, in excess of $380 million.

==Home media==
The film was released on videocassette by Key Video in February 1985 as part of the release of 11 videos to mark the 50th anniversary of Presley&#x27;s birth. It has also been released internationally on DVD and Blu-ray disc.

<text>At least 218 companies have manufactured hard disk drives (HDDs) since 1956. Most of that industry has vanished through bankruptcy or mergers and acquisitions. None of the first several entrants (including IBM, who invented the HDD) continue in the industry today. Only three manufacturers have survived—Seagate, Toshiba and Western Digital (WD)—all of which grew at least in part through mergers and acquisitions.

<doc id="985103" wikidata="Q571587" url="?curid=985103" title="Traffic ticket">
<text>A traffic ticket is a notice issued by a law enforcement official to a motorist or other road user, indicating that the user has violated traffic laws. Traffic tickets generally come in two forms, citing a moving violation, such as exceeding the speed limit, or a non-moving violation, such as a parking violation, with the ticket also being referred to as a parking citation, or parking ticket.

In some jurisdictions, a traffic ticket constitutes a notice that a penalty, such as a fine or accumulation of “points”, has been or will be assessed against the driver or owner of a vehicle; failure to pay generally leads to prosecution or to civil recovery proceedings for the fine. In others, the ticket constitutes only a citation and summons to appear at traffic court, with a determination of guilt to be made only in court.

==Australia==
In Australia, traffic laws are made at the state level, usually in their own consolidated Acts of Parliament which have been based upon the Australian Road Rules.

===New South Wales===
Traffic tickets are known as Traffic infringement notices (TIN&#x27;s) in New South Wales. Transport for NSW maintains a database of all registered holders of a driver&#x27;s licence in NSW, including the driver&#x27;s traffic history and registered motor vehicles.
* Owner issued infringements
Transport for NSW maintain a number of fixed, and mobile, speed cameras and red light cameras across the State. The State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO) manages the processing and issuing of traffic tickets detected and issued by these devices. These tickets are deemed to be &#x27;owner onus&#x27; tickets with the vehicles registered owner deemed liable unless they nominate another driver via statutory declaration.
* Driver issued infringements
These are generally issued &#x27;on the spot&#x27; by a police officer although there are other authorised officers that can issue traffic infringements such as Transport for NSW heavy vehicle inspectors and Traffic Commanders. The infringement notice is written on three carbonised pieces of printed paper, known as Part A, B and C. Part A is the original and is sent to the State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO) by the issuing officer when they return to the station, Part B stays in the infringement book for accountability and Part C is given to the accused person at the scene or via post. Infringement notices issued by Councils or Commercial Clients by way of electronic handheld devices still have as associated application for details provided on a copy of the Part A, to be made available for perusal if required.

In New South Wales, all Traffic infringement notices (TIN&#x27;s) and Parking Infringement Notices (PIN&#x27;s) are part of the Self-Enforcing Infringement Notice Scheme (SEINS). This scheme aims to minimize Court time for people who wish to plead guilty. The accused person can either elect to pay/part pay the infringement by way of a number of online means or through Australia Post, this can be found on the ticket. If the Accused person pays the infringement, they are deemed to have pleaded guilty and any demerit points will be deducted from their driver&#x27;s licence. Matters only go to Court if the accused person elects to have the matter heard at Court.

If the accused person wishes to plead not guilty, they fill the reverse side of Part C out and mail it to the State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO). Once this is done, a Court date is set for hearing before a Magistrate and the officer is notified. The officer creates a brief of evidence and provides this to the Court and the accused person, this contains a copy of Part A, which includes the facts of the matter i.e. observations and contemporaneous notes, including description of vehicle, and whether or not any photographs of an offending vehicle have been taken. Quite often, an officer will indicate that they have taken only (1) photograph of a vehicle then, when a matter is defended in court and the prosecution provide a brief of evidence with anything up to 4-5 extra photographs this can lead to some of the photographs being excluded as evidence because there is no indication to show on the Part A that they were taken at the time of the offence.

Upon being issued a traffic infringement, or parking infringement notice, (in person or to a vehicle) an accused person will generally receive a penalty reminder notice in the mail approximately 28 days later, if the fine remains unpaid.

Under the Fines Act of 1996 (NSW) Time for service of penalty reminder notices by post, is (7) days unless it is established that it was not served within (7) days. A due date for payment of Penalty Reminder notices under this Act is (21) days after it is served. Generally from the date of an offence approximately (28) days is given, after which time of the due date they will then have approximately an additional 21 days in which to take action, and finalise the matter. This includes (7) to allow for service, and (14) days for action to be taken.

If the fine is not actioned by the due date on the penalty reminder notice, an enforcement order will be issued and additional costs apply. If the enforcement order remains unpaid further enforcement action can follow, which may include suspension of the persons driver licence and/or vehicle registration, restrictions on conducting business with Transport for NSW, garnisheeing of wages, property seizure order or a community service order and additional fees.

==Canada==
===Outline of traffic offences===
In Canada, most traffic laws are made at the provincial level. However, some serious violations are criminal offences, contrary to the federal Criminal Code. Both levels of government may deal with different aspects of the same misconduct. For example, drinking and driving may be a criminal offence of driving while impaired, or driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. At the same time, most provinces have laws specifying administrative penalties for driving with a blood alcohol level which does not exceed the criminal blood alcohol level of .08, in particular for newly licensed drivers.

Each province maintains a database of motorists, including their convicted traffic violations. Upon being ticketed, a motorist has a chance to plead guilty or not guilty with an explanation. The motorist or their representative must attend the court for the town or city in which the violation took place to do so.

If the motorist pleads not guilty, a trial date is set and both the motorist, or a lawyer/paralegal representing the motorist, and the ticketing officer, are required to attend. If the officer fails to attend, the court judge will often find in favour of the motorist and dismiss the charge, although sometimes the trial date is moved to give the officer another chance to attend. In some provinces, officers are now paid time and a half to attend traffic proceedings. The court will also make provisions for the officer or the prosecutor to achieve a deal with the motorist, often in the form of a plea bargain. If no agreement is reached, both motorist and officer, or their respective representatives, formally attempt to prove their case before the judge or Justice of Peace, who then decides the matter.

If the motorist pleads guilty, the outcome is equivalent to conviction after trial. Upon conviction, the motorist is generally fined a monetary amount and, for moving violations, is additionally given demerit points, under each province&#x27;s point system. Jail time is sometimes sought in more serious cases such as racing or stunt driving.

=== The Demerit Point System in Ontario ===
In the province of Ontario, drivers who are convicted of certain driving related offences result in demerit points recorded onto their driving records. It is commonly misconceived that drivers actually &quot;lose&quot; points due to convictions for certain traffic offences. In fact, a driver begins with zero demerit points and accumulates demerit points for convictions. Demerit points stay on a driver&#x27;s record for two years from the original offence date. If a driver accumulates enough points, a suspension/loss of licence can occur.

For a fully licensed driver in Ontario, the accumulation of six demerit points results in a &quot;warning&quot; letter. At nine points, the driver is scheduled a mandatory interview to discuss their record and give specific reasonings as to why the licence should not be suspended. If a driver fails to attend this meeting, their licence may be automatically suspended. At 15 or more points, a driver&#x27;s licence will be suspended for 30 days. Surrendering a licence to the Ministry of Transportation is mandatory at this stage; failure to surrender the licence may result in a suspension/loss for up to two years.
==Ireland==
In the Republic of Ireland, a traffic ticket (which is mailed out to the driver) is in the form of a notice alleging that some crime – traffic offences are all criminal offences – has been committed, but stating that if a payment of a certain amount is made to the Garda Síochána within 28 days, or the amount increased by 50% is paid within 56 days, the driver will not be prosecuted for the alleged offence. Some tickets carry penalty points as well as the fine.

==Scandinavia==

Most of Scandinavia determines some traffic fines based on income. For example, Finland&#x27;s system for calculating fines starts with an estimate of the amount of spending money a Finn has for one day, and then divides that by two. The resulting number is considered a &quot;reasonable&quot; amount of spending money to deprive the offender of. Then, based on the severity of the crime, the system has rules for how many days the offender must go without that money. For example, driving about 15 mph over the speed limit results in a multiplier of 12 days. Most reckless drivers pay between $30 and $50 per day, for a total of about $400 or $500. In 2002, a Nokia executive was fined the equivalent of $103,000 for driving at 75 km/h (47 mph) in a 50 km/h (31 mph) zone on his motorcycle. Estonia (across the Baltic from Scandinavia) is experimenting with a &quot;time out&quot; in lieu of fines: the motorist waits at the side of the road for 45 minutes or an hour.

==United States==


In the United States, most traffic laws are codified in a variety of state, county and municipal laws or ordinances, with most minor violations classified as infractions, civil charges or criminal charges. The classification of the charge depends on the violation itself as well as the jurisdiction, with infractions, civil charges and criminal charges relating to different standards of proof, trial rules and punishments.

===Traffic violations===
What constitutes a &quot;minor violation&quot; or infraction varies, examples include non-moving violations, defective or improper vehicle equipment, seat belt and child-restraint safety violations, and insufficient proof of license, insurance or registration. A trend in the late 1970s and early 1980s also saw an increased tendency for jurisdictions to re-classify certain speeding violations as civil infractions. In contrast, for more &quot;serious&quot; violations, traffic violators may be held criminally liable, accused of a misdemeanor or even a felony. Serious violations tend to involve multiple prior offenses, willful disregard of public safety, death or serious bodily injury, or damage to property. A frequently used penalty is a fine, and this is ordinarily a fixed amount of money, instead of being an amount of money determined based on the facts of each individual case.

===Contesting a ticket===
If the motorist wishes to contest a traffic infraction, a hearing can be set by the court upon proper request. The hearings are before a magistrate or judge depending on the state or city. Hearing dates may potentially be adjourned, and witnesses or police officers may be subpoenaed to appear in court.

At any point after the issuance of a ticket, a motorist may retain an attorney to represent them in a traffic infraction. Retaining or consulting an attorney may be beneficial to the motorist because an attorney would better understand how to contest an infraction in any given state or municipality. Attorneys may offer full representation in court, taking a case from inception to disposal and potentially appeals, although it may be possible for a defendant to retain a lawyer to discuss legal options, identify important defenses, and determine a defense strategy without hiring the lawyer to provide in-court representation.

The motorist may be given the opportunity to schedule a hearing for a time at which the subpoenaed ticketing officer is unable to attend. If the officer or representative fails to attend the trial for a civil infraction, the trial court may adjourn the hearing to a date upon which the officer is able to appear or, particularly if good cause is not shown for the officer&#x27;s absence, the court judge may dismiss the charge.

Although each judge, state, county or municipality handle contested hearings a little differently, the court may make provisions for the prosecutor to achieve a deal with the motorist, often in the form of a plea bargain that may reduce the impact from that which would be incurred from pleading guilty without attending court. If no agreement is reached, and the prosecutor feels it is worth his time to charge the motorist, both motorist and officer, or their respective representatives, formally attempt to prove their case before the judge, who then decides the matter.

In some states and for criminal traffic violations, the judge may also order a jury trial, in which case a jury will hear arguments from both sides, and then consider the facts in the case and render a verdict. The motorist may, for example, put forward a reason their alleged violation was justified, such as to &quot;get out of the way of an ambulance or avoid a collision with another motorist&quot;, and call into doubt the level to which the officer recalls the specific details of the situation among the many tickets they have issued.

In Washington state, there is a local option for courts to permit a decision on written statements, without the officer&#x27;s live appearance in court. California offers a procedure in which both the officer and the ticketed driver may appear in writing, through a Trial by Written Declaration.

Some states permit challenging a traffic infraction through a written statement instead of appearing in court. For example, California&#x27;s Vehicle Code Section 40902 permits individuals to obtain a trial by written declaration instead of making an in-court appearance.

===Driving records===
Each state&#x27;s Department of Motor Vehicles or Bureau of Motor Vehicles maintains a database of motorists, including their convicted traffic violations. Upon being ticketed, a motorist is given the option to mail into the local court or the court for the jurisdiction in which the violation is alleged—a plea of guilty, not guilty or nolo contendere within a certain time frame (usually ten to fifteen days, although courts generally provide leniency in this regard). Additionally, the motorist can request a mitigation hearing, which acknowledges that the driver is guilty of a moving violation, but is requesting a hearing with a judge to reduce the fines associated with the ticket.

If the motorist pleads guilty, the outcome is equivalent to a conviction after the hearing. Upon conviction, the motorist is generally fined a monetary amount and, for moving violations, is additionally assessed a penalty under each state&#x27;s point system. If a motorist is convicted of a violation in a state other than the state in which the motorist is registered, information about the ticket is relayed in accord with state policy and agreements between the two states, including the Non-Resident Violator Compact. If the ticket information is not abstracted to the state in which the motorist is licensed, then the record of the conviction remains local to the state where the violation took place.

===Ticket fixing===
The practice of ticket fixing by police officers is a recurring source of controversy in the United States. Police officers in many jurisdictions surreptitiously cancel tickets as a &quot;professional courtesy&quot; to the friends and family of other police officers. This practice is not legal in most jurisdictions, but enforcement is often lax, leading to periodic scandals.

==Ticket superlatives==
There are many competing claims as to the first speeding ticket ever issued depending whether the claim goes by the first traffic violation or the first &quot;paper ticket&quot; ever issued. Great Britain may have the earliest claim with the first person to be convicted of speeding, Walter Arnold of East Peckham, Kent, who on 28 January 1896 was fined for speeding at in a zone. He was fined 1 shilling plus costs. A New York City cab driver named Jacob German was arrested for speeding on May 20, 1899 for driving 12 miles per hour on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. In Dayton, Ohio, police issued a &quot;paper ticket&quot; to Harry Myers for going twelve miles per hour on West Third Street in 1904.

Another early speeding ticket was issued in 1910 to Lady Laurier, the wife of Wilfrid Laurier, Prime Minister of Canada, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, for exceeding the 10 miles per hour speed limit.

The fastest convicted speeder in the UK was Daniel Nicks, convicted of on a Honda Fireblade motorcycle in 2000. He received six weeks in jail and was banned from driving for two full years. The fastest UK speeder in a car was Timothy Brady, caught driving a 3.6-litre Porsche 911 Turbo at on the A420 in Oxfordshire in January 2007 and jailed for 10 weeks and banned from driving for 3 years.

The most expensive speeding ticket ever given is believed to be the one given to Jussi Salonoja in Helsinki, Finland, in 2003. Salonoja, the 27-year-old heir to a company in the meat-industry, was fined 170,000 euros for driving 80 km/h in a 40 km/h zone. The uncommonly large fine was due to Finnish speeding tickets (when excess speed is considerable) being relative to the offender&#x27;s last known income. Salonoja&#x27;s speeding ticket was not the first ticket given in Finland reaching six figures.

<doc id="985106" wikidata="Q1873600" url="?curid=985106" title="The Now Show">
<text>The Now Show is a British radio comedy programme on BBC Radio 4, which satirises the weekly news from 1998 to 2024. The show is a mixture of stand-up, sketches and songs hosted by Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis. It features regular appearances by Jon Holmes, Laura Shavin (earlier series had Emma Kennedy, or occasionally Sue Perkins, for the female voices), a monologue by Marcus Brigstocke, and music by Mitch Benn, Pippa Evans or Adam Kay. Later series feature a wider range of contributors.

Most episodes feature a special guest, including Robin Ince, Rory Bremner, Dave Gorman, Simon Munnery, Al Murray, Andy Zaltzman, Paul Sinha, Richard Stilgoe, Dr Phil Hammond, Barry Cryer, John Finnemore, Andy Parsons, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton, Grace Petrie, Sarah Kendall and Francesca Martinez. Jon Culshaw featured on the 2004 and 2005 Christmas editions and also starred in the 2008 Christmas edition. Guests have also stood in for absent cast members.

The series was a successor to the early 1990s topical comedy show &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot;, in which Punt and Dennis were a key part, although its origins lie with the short-lived &quot;Live on Arrival&quot; from 1988. The programme first aired on 26 September 1998. Repeats of &quot;The Now Show&quot; are now aired on BBC Radio 4 Extra.

In early series each episode was introduced by Burt Kwouk announcing “The Now Show” in an increasingly shrill voice on the word “show”. This tradition continued with Hugh Dennis doing the honours.

In October 2016, long-running cast member Jon Holmes reported that he had been fired because &#x27;the BBC want to recast with more women and diversity.&#x27;

In March 2024 it was announced that the spring 2024 series would be its last, with Punt and Dennis presenting a new BBC radio 4 show RouteMasters.

The show concluded on the 19th of April 2024.

==Broadcast and podcast==
The programme is recorded in front of a studio audience on the Thursday evening before the Friday broadcast. On Friday 22 July 2005, &quot;The Now Show&quot; was broadcast without a studio audience due to the attempted 21 July 2005 London Bombings. The show&#x27;s then regular venue, The Drill Hall was close to the site of one of the failed bomb attacks and had been cordoned off by police; as such the show had to be recorded in the Radio 4 studios at Broadcasting House. Hugh Dennis opened the show with the words &quot;with us are Laura Shavin, Jon Holmes, Marcus Brigstocke and Mitch Benn... and no audience&quot;.

The 18th series, running from April to May 2006, was the first Radio 4 comedy series to be made available on podcast, as part of a trial, or to be downloaded directly from the BBC Radio 4 web page, both for seven days after broadcast. The podcast had some of the music (from outside sources) cut because of restrictions due to artist royalties (although a new joke was inserted in place of the music, such as &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;ll be over in a minute&quot;, or rants about the BBC&#x27;s lawyers), although the complete show could still be heard for seven days after the broadcast on the BBC&#x27;s listen again feature. This podcast was the fourth most popular podcast in August 2006, according to Schott&#x27;s Almanac. However, due to the end of the trial, the 22nd series, running from June to August 2007, was not available for download. The podcast returned, as part of the &quot;Friday Night Comedy&quot; podcast, alternating with &quot;The News Quiz and Dead Ringers&quot;.

==&quot;The Vote Now Show&quot;==
A version of the show entitled &quot;The Vote Now Show&quot; has been broadcast in the run-up to the 2010, 2015 UK general elections and 2017 UK general elections. The format is broadly the same, incorporating many of the show&#x27;s regular performers and an additional political guest interviewed by Punt and Dennis. The episodes are more frequent than usual and the programme is transmitted at 11pm on the day of recording, so it can incorporate that day&#x27;s campaign news to make it more topical. The first series had three programmes a week on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, in 2015 it was twice weekly (Mondays and Fridays). Clips of politicians are more likely to feature, as the broadcasting restrictions for House of Commons footage do not apply to election events.

==&quot;The Now Show 2012 Live&quot;==
During the London 2012 Olympics a similar run of six live programmes based on the ongoing events entitled &quot;The Now Show 2012 Live&quot; was broadcast.

==Reception==
&quot;The Now Show&quot; was voted as the &quot;Best British Radio Panel Show/Satire&quot; for 2008 in &quot;The Comedy.co.uk Awards&quot;.

In March 2009, Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis were criticised for comparing the planned comeback of 1980s pop star Michael Jackson with that of the IRA.

==Books and merchandise==
Punt and Dennis, together with Holmes and other cast members, published two books, &quot;The Now Show Book&quot; and &quot;The Now Show Book of World Records&quot;.

A collection of four episodes of the series from 2002 were released on CD and audio cassette on 29 July 2002. A further collection of highlights from the 2004–2005 series was released for download through Audible.com and iTunes.

<text>A time sink (also timesink), time drain or time-waster is an activity that consumes a significant amount of time, especially one which is seen as a wasteful way of spending it. Although it is unknown when the term was coined, it makes an analogy with heat sink.
==In video games==
In massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), time sinks are a method of increasing the time needed by players to do certain tasks, hopefully causing them to subscribe for longer periods of time. Players may use the term disparagingly to describe a simplistic and time-consuming aspect of gameplay, possibly designed to keep players playing longer without significant benefit. Time sinks can also be used for other gameplay reasons, such as to help regenerate resources or monsters in the game world.

===Negative connotations===
Many players consider time sinks to be an inherently poor design decision, only included so that game companies can increase profits. For example, one Slashdot article describes time sinks as &quot;gameplay traps intended to waste your time and keep you playing longer&quot;. In most games, boring and lengthy parts of gameplay are merely an annoyance, but when used in subscription-based MMORPGs, where players are paying recurring fees for access to the game, they become a much more inflammatory issue. Game designers must be prudent in balancing efforts to produce both involving gameplay and the length of content that players expect.

Time sinks are often associated with hardcore games, though whether this is a positive or negative association depends on the context.

===Trade-offs===
Implementing time sinks in a video game is a delicate balancing act. Excessive use of time sinks may cause players to stop playing. However, if not enough time sinks are implemented, players may feel the game is too short or too easy, causing them to abandon the game much sooner out of boredom. A number of criteria can be used to evaluate use of time sinks, such as frequency, length, and variety (both of the nature of the time sink and the actions taken to overcome it). What is considered a good balance depends in part on the type of game in question. Casual games are often expected to have less in the way of time sinks, and hardcore games to have more, though this is not a hard and fast rule.

== General term ==

A time sink is an enjoyable but time-wasting activity.

Some parents call video games a waste of time, while some introverts call parties a waste of time, making the term highly subjective; even sleeping could be considered a time sink. Some time sinks become popular and are therefore not as commonly referred to as a time sink.

More examples of time sinks include watching a sports game, spending time at a bar, spending a day at the beach, day-long spa treatments, and camping in the woods.

A time sink generally has a negative connotation but it can be a more neutral term. MMORPGs are known for time-wasting activity. However, the genre of incremental games use waiting as a core feature. Players of such games can take pleasure in repetitive and easy tasks.

<doc id="985127" wikidata="Q2834675" url="?curid=985127" title="Alexis-Vincent-Charles Berbiguier de Terre-Neuve du Thym">
<text>Alexis-Vincent-Charles Berbiguier de Terre-Neuve du Thym or better known as M. Berbiguier (1765 – December 3, 1851) was a French author and demonologist who may have had psychosis. He was born, and died, in Carpentras in Southern France, and was the heir to an estate, which he used to finance the publication of his unusual memoirs. He is remembered chiefly for his lengthy autobiography, &quot;Les farfadets ou Tous les démons ne sont pas de l&#x27;autre monde&quot; (&quot;The Imps; or, All the demons are not from the other world&quot;), originally published in three volumes between 1818 and 1820. The book was handsomely illustrated by a series of lithographs whose originals were sketched by Berbiguier himself.

==Struggle with the &quot;farfadets&quot;==
This autobiography recounts Berbiguier&#x27;s lifelong struggle with &quot;farfadets&quot;, &quot;imps&quot; or &quot;goblins&quot;. He relates that these imps harassed him persistently ever since his unfortunate encounter with two &quot;sibyls&quot;, or fortune tellers, whom he consulted in an idle moment in his youth. For this sin, he was delivered into the hands of impish tormentors. The imps continued to follow Berbiguier through several lengthy stays in Avignon and Paris. The chief imp among his tormentors was named Rhotomago; Rhotomago&#x27;s immediate superior was Beelzebub himself. He alleged that he received, and answered, written correspondence from all of these Hellish dignitaries.

By research and experiment Berbiguier determined a number of herbal and other remedies that had the power to keep the imps in check. He wrote his book, he relates, to reveal his struggles and his methods to the world. In an eloquent if presumptuous dedication, he addresses himself to:
A TOUS LES EMPEREURS, ROIS, PRINCES, SOUVERAINS DES QUATRES PARTIES DU MONDE

&quot;Sires,&quot;

&quot;Pères des peuples, qui représentez sur la terre de Dieu de Paix et de consolation, qui est dans le ciel, réunissez vos efforts aux miens pour détruire l&#x27;influence des Démons, Sorciers et Farfadets, qui désolent les malheureux habitants de vos Etats. Vous voyez à vos pieds le plus infortuné des hommes; les tourments auxquels je suis en lutte depuis plus de vingt-trois ans sont les plus beaux titres que je puisse avoir à un de vos regards paternels.&quot;

&quot;Ah ! Il y a déjà longtemps que les persécutions diaboliques des Farfadets auraient eu un terme sur la terre, si quelqu&#x27;un de vos sujets avait eu le courage de vous les dévoiler. C&#x27;est pour les démasquer que je vous dédie mon ouvrage; vous ne serez pas insensibles à mes tourments, vous les ferez cesser dès qu&#x27;ils vous seront connus.&quot;

::TO ALL THE EMPERORS, KINGS, PRINCES, AND SOVEREIGNS OF THE FOUR PARTS OF THE WORLD

::Milords,
::Fathers of nations, you who represent the heavenly God of peace and consolation on earth, unite your efforts to my own to destroy the power of Demons, Witches, and Imps, that devastate the unhappy dwellers of your countries. You see at your feet the most unfortunate of men; the torments with which I have struggled for these twenty-five years are the best titles that I can bear before your paternal gaze.
::Ah! The diabolical persecutions of the Imps would have long since been ended on Earth, had one of your subjects had the courage to reveal them to you. It is in order to unmask them that I have dedicated my work to you, that you may not be heedless to my torments, and that you will work to end them now that they are known to you.

The autobiography relates Berbiguier&#x27;s struggles with the imps. He was able to capture some of them, and confine them in bottles. Sulphur and thyme were two odours he found were effective to repel them. The book tells of an adventure he had with firefighters during a sojourn in Paris, where he attracted the alarmed notice of neighbours by burning sulphur to keep the imps at bay. Notwithstanding his efforts, the imps continued to tempt and torment him. The title &quot;de Terre-Neuve du Thym&quot; was self-bestowed; it means &quot;of the New World of Thyme,&quot; and shows his hope that revealing his methods will renew the world and purge it of impish influences. He also bestowed upon himself the style &quot;Le Fléau des Farfadets&quot;, &quot;the Scourge of the Imps.&quot;

==Psychiatric interpretation==

As a result of these activities, he eventually was committed to the Hospice de la Salpêtrière under the care of Dr Philippe Pinel, a pioneer of psychotherapy; he was eventually released. Pinel was unable to achieve much for him, and appears in the book as a servant of the imps. An ultimate improvement in Berbiguier&#x27;s mental state may be indicated by a report that he attempted to round up and destroy the surviving copies of his book, which as a result are quite scarce.

==Literary interpretations==
Raymond Queneau and André Blavier considered Berbiguier to be a &quot;fou littéraire&quot;, a &quot;literary madman,&quot; or rather, the literary equivalent of outsider art in France. Théophile Gautier used Berbiguier as a model for his fantastic story, &quot;Onuphrius; ou les vexations fantastiques d&#x27;un admirateur d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot;, and Gustave Flaubert similarly consulted Berbiguier&#x27;s work for his tale of &quot;Bouvard et Pécuchet&quot;.

<text>Hubert von Luschka, born Hubert Luschka (July 27, 1820 in Konstanz – March 1, 1875 in Tübingen), was a German anatomist. He lent his name to several structures, including the foramina of Luschka, Luschka&#x27;s crypts, Luschka&#x27;s joints, and Ducts of Luschka. His name is also associated with Luschka&#x27;s law, an anatomical rule concerning location of the ureters.

Luschka began studying medicine, initially pharmacology, in 1841 at the University of Freiburg and the University of Heidelberg. In 1845 he became an assistant to Louis Stromeyer in Freiburg, then moved in 1849 to the University of Tübingen, where he was a lecturer and associate professor until being appointed a full professor of anatomy in 1855. A manuscript copy of lectures on surgical anatomy that he gave in Tübingen forms part of the Manchester Medical Manuscripts Collection held by special collections at the University of Manchester with the reference MMM/23/211. He gained a noble title and began using &quot;von&quot; in his name in 1865.

His work particularly concerned the need for anatomy to be connected in a practical manner to medicine and surgery. His &quot;Anatomie des Menschen in Rücksicht auf das Bedürfnis der praktischen Heilkunde&quot; (1862–69; &quot;Human Anatomy in Consideration of the Needs of Practical Medicine&quot;) aimed to provide such a link. He promoted the use of anatomical information in surgery, for example to manipulate internal organs using long needles before cutting the body open, and was one of the first to conduct detailed research on normal corpses (rather than only diseased or anomalous ones), publishing a series of detailed books covering specific aspects of anatomy, such as the nerves of the hands and the blood vessels of the brain.

<text>Groschen (; from &quot;thick&quot;, via Old Czech &quot;&quot;) is the (sometimes colloquial) name for various coins, especially a silver coin used in parts of Europe including France, some of the Italian states, England, and various states of the Holy Roman Empire. 

The word is borrowed from the late Latin description of a tornose, a , in English the &quot;thick denarius of Tours&quot;. Groschen was frequently abbreviated in old documents to &quot;gl&quot;, in which the second character was not an &quot;L&quot; (12th letter of the alphabet), but an abbreviation symbol; later it was written as &quot;Gr&quot; or &quot;g&quot;.

== Names and etymology ==
The name was introduced in 13th-century France as &#x27;, lit. &quot;thick penny&quot;, whence Old French &#x27;, Italian &#x27;, Middle High German &#x27;, Low German and Dutch &#x27; and English &quot;groat&quot;. In the 14th century, it appeared as Old Czech &#x27;, whence Modern German &quot;&quot;.

Names in other modern languages include:
* 
* Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, Belarusian, Ukrainian: грош
* Czech, Slovak, Serbo-Croatian: &quot;groš&quot;
* 
* 
* 
* 
* (&quot;&quot;)

The Arabic, Amharic, Hebrew, Greek and Turkish names for currency denominations in and around the territories formerly part of the Ottoman Empire derived from the same Italian origin.

== History ==
=== Middle Ages ===
Names like &quot;groschen&quot;, &quot;grossus/grossi&quot;, &quot;grosso&quot;, &quot;grossone&quot;, &quot;grosz&quot;, &quot;gros&quot;, &quot;groš&quot;, &quot;groat&quot;, &quot;Groten&quot;, &quot;garas&quot; etc. were used in the Middle Ages for all &quot;thick&quot; silver coins, as opposed to &quot;thin&quot; silver coins such as &#x27; or pennies. Historically it was equal to between several and a dozen &#x27;.

In the German-speaking world, the groschen was usually worth 12 pfennigs; many regional (small) groschen e.g. &quot;Neugroschen&quot;, &quot;Groten&quot; (plural: Grote) in northern Germany, English: groat, &quot;Mariengroschen&quot;, &quot;Grösch(e)l&quot; were worth between 2½ and 10 pfennigs. The later &quot;Kreuzer&quot;, a coin worth 4 pfennigs arose from the linguistic abbreviation of the small &quot;Kreuzgroschen&quot;.

The groschen was first introduced into the Holy Roman Empire in 1271 by Duke Meinhard II of Tyrol in Merano. It was originally a solid coin of pure silver, larger than the denarius which was no longer valid. In essence, it took the place of a variety of the older &quot;pfennigs&quot;, whose silver purity had inflated their value over the centuries. According to one source, the city of Trier is said to have struck groschen-like, thick pfennigs as early as 1104, which were then followed in 1300 by the Bohemian groschen from Kuttenberg. The new coin soon inspired other &#x27;mint lords&#x27; (&quot;Münzherren&quot;) and was given, not least for reasons of economic necessity, a higher face value in the Early Renaissance period. Upper Italian coins of multiple pfennig value in the High Middle Ages were similarly called &quot;Grossini&quot; (cf. also &quot;Schilling&quot;).

The 1286 Tyrolean example (above right) weighs , it is marked with &quot;ME IN AR DVS&quot; (for &quot;Meinhard&quot;) and a Double Cross (obverse), and with &quot;DUX TIROL&quot; and the Eagle of Tyrol (reverse).

In 1328 Emperor Louis IV, the Bavarian, authorised Count Adolf VI of Berg to mint torneses in Wipperfürth. The oldest groschen in the area that is now modern Germany were minted there until 1346.

Following the example of the Tours &quot;Grossus&quot;, the Prague groschen or groš was minted in Kuttenberg and, around 1338/1339, the Meissen groschen in Freiberg&#x27;s National Mint in the Margraviate of Meissen. Both coins gained national importance and had a strong influence on German coinage. &quot;Groschen&quot; valued at 12 pfennigs were common. The Polish groschen or &quot;grosz&quot; was worth only half as much – 6 pfennigs – and was commonly used in Silesia as a &quot;grosch(e)l&quot; or &quot;gresch(e)l&quot; worth just to 3 pfennigs.

The &#x27;prince&#x27;s groschen&#x27; (&quot;Fürstengroschen&quot;) set a record in terms of the devaluation of the Meissen groschen. When this groschen was introduced in March 1393, its value was 23 of a Rhenish guilder. In 1406, the devaluation of these coins reached its peak: 53 groschen were now equal to 1 Rhenish guilder.

The groschen was minted during the Middle Ages in the following areas:

* Tirol (from 1271)
* England (from 1279, the groat)
* Bohemia (from 1300, the Prague groschen, later adopted by most of the Central European countries)
* Poland (from 1367, the Cracow, of silver, an equivalent of 12 denarii)
* Moldavia (from the reign of Petru I, 1375–1391)
* The type was also minted during various times in the Duchy of Luxembourg, such as the 22 millimetre gros produced from 1418 to 1425 under John III the Pitiless, Duke of Bavaria, bearing slightly varying inscriptions of &quot;IOAH DVX BAVAR Z FILIVS&quot; on the obverse, and &quot;MONE NOVA LUCE BURS&quot; on the reverse.

=== Early modern period ===

Later the tradition of was dropped in most states while others continued to mint only coins smaller than the original coin. In Poland for example, from 1526 these included coins of , 1 , , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 . Their weight steadily dropped to of silver and since 1752 they were replaced by copper coins of the same name.

In Germany, the name &#x27; (both singular and plural) replaced &#x27; as the common name for a 12 coin. In the 18th century it was used predominantly in the northern states as a coin worth of a (equal to of a ). In the 19th century, a new currency system was introduced in which the , often under a new name to distinguish it from the old, was worth of a or . This began in 1821 in Prussia, where the coin was called the (Sgr) and was worth 12 pfennigs. Saxony followed in 1840 with the (ngr), also of a thaler, but subdivided in 10 (new) pfennigs. Silesia and Bohemia introduced the white groschen (&quot;Weissgroschen&quot;) in 1821 at the same time as Prussia. Frederick William III of Prussia could not yet decide on the consistent introduction of the decimal system. In order to be able to distinguish his new pfennig&#x27; from the old ones, they were called &quot;Pfenninge&quot;.

The last German &quot;Kurantgroschen&quot; (regarding the simple face value) were issued in the Kingdom of Saxony in 1827 and 1828, and in the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1837 based on a monetary standard, the &quot;Konventionsfuß&quot;, of the state, according to which the silver contained in 320 groschen was equal to the weight of a Cologne Mark (233.856 grammes).

An exception in relation to the value of thaler coins is the series of &#x27;butterfly coins&#x27; (&quot;Schmetterlingsmünzen&quot;) in the Electorate of Saxony. All these coins only show their value in groschen; the usual abbreviation for groschen used in the everyday correspondence being used for the denomination on the coins. Likewise, the abbreviation for groschen used in the written word was stamped on the Electoral Saxon golden &quot;Reichsgulden zu 21 Groschen&quot; of 1584. In this case, it was probably intended to express the fact that it is a coin of account (&quot;Rechnungsmünze&quot;). Another special case is the &quot;Kipperthaler&quot;, on which the value in groschen (or &quot;Kreuzer&quot;) is also stamped to circumvent the Imperial Minting Ordinance (&quot;Reichsmünzordnung&quot;). Also interesting are thalers, which were minted in denominations of 28 and 24 groschen without differences in design and size. For example, the 24 groschen &quot;Hosenbandtaler&quot; were also coins of account, which is sometimes not recognized.

Following German unification and decimalisation, with 100 pfennigs to the mark, the groschen was replaced by the 10 coin and remained a nickname for the 10 coin until the introduction of the euro. For the same reason, the name &quot; (sixer) remained in use regionally for the half- coin, 5 s.

There is a Beethoven rondo for piano, opus 129 (1795) entitled &quot; (literally &quot;The Rage Over the Lost Groschen&quot;, but known as &quot;Rage Over a Lost Penny&quot;).

== Modern currencies ==

In recent times, the name was used by three currencies in circulation:

* In Poland, a &#x27; (plural: &#x27; or &quot;, depending on the number) is a part of a 
* In Austria, a &#x27; (plural: &#x27;) was a part of a &quot; (1924–38 and 1945–2001)
* In Turkey, a &quot;kuruş&quot; is a 1/100 part of &quot;lira.&quot;

Likewise, in Germany groschen remained a slang term for the 10 pfennig coin, thus a part both of the (West German) Deutsche Mark and the East German mark. The word has lost popularity with the introduction of the euro, although it can still be heard on occasion, especially from older people.

The Ukrainian and Belarusian common word for money, &quot;&quot;, derives from the word &quot;grosh&quot;.

In Bulgaria, the &quot;&quot; (Cyrillic: ) was used as a currency until the lev was introduced in the 19th century.

In Palestine during the British Mandate, a &quot;grush&quot; was a coin with a hole in it, valued at part of a pound (ten mils). It was named after an Ottoman coin. When the pound was replaced by the &quot;lira&quot; after Israeli statehood in 1948, the name was transferred to a coin (no longer with a hole) worth of a lira (ten perutot, later one agora). The name persisted for a while after the lira was replaced by the &quot;shekel&quot; in 1980 (one new agora, worth ten old agorot), but it gradually lost its standing as the name of a certain coin. Now it is slang for a very small value.
Austria introduced the groschen in 1924 as the subdivision of the . It was restored, along with the , in 1945 and continued in use until the introduction of the euro in 2002.

<text>Norfolk &amp; Norwich Festival is an arts festival held annually in Norwich, England. 

It is one of the oldest city festivals in England, having been held since 1824 and tracing its roots back further to 1772. It was initially conceived as a fundraiser for the Norfolk &amp; Norwich Hospital. For most of its history was a purely classical musical festival which saw performances by many famous artistes, composers and conductors. In recent years the festival has moved away from this focus, and has diversified to include a variety of circus, performance, contemporary music, dance, visual arts and children&#x27;s events.

Today Norfolk &amp; Norwich Festival is an arts organisation based in Norwich, England which is primarily responsible for the eponymous international arts festival held annually each May, with events also held throughout the wider county of Norfolk. The Festival organisation works on creative learning schemes across Norfolk with support from Arts Council England and Norwich and Norfolk councils and has received funding to become a &quot;bridge organisation&quot; for Arts Council England from 2012.

==Origins==

The festival was established as a triennial event in 1824 to support the ongoing construction of the Norfolk &amp; Norwich Hospital, and grew out of earlier musical fundraisers for the hospital dating back as far as 1772 including the annual performance of an oratorio at Norwich Cathedral.

In its early days, the festival was mainly held in St. Andrew&#x27;s Hall and St Peter Mancroft. These events consisted primarily of oratorios and other large scale choral works performed by the Norwich Festival Chorus, then 300 strong. Noted premieres from this time included &quot;The Last Judgement&quot; by the German Romantic composer and conductor Louis Spohr. (See list of oratorios, 19th Century)

==20th century==

The triennial festival continued to develop a reputation throughout the Victorian and Edwardian period, but was suspended during the First World War, being revived under the patronage of Norwich&#x27;s first female Lord Mayor, Ethel Colman in 1923.

It saw the premieres of significant classical works including Edward Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Sea Pictures&quot; in 1899 (sung by Clara Butt), E. J. Moeran&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody No. 2&quot; for the 1924 centenary concert (based on a Norfolk folksong), Frank Bridge&#x27;s &quot;Enter Spring&quot; in 1927, Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;&quot; in 1930, Arthur Bliss&#x27;s &quot;Morning Heroes&quot; also in 1930 and Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Our Hunting Fathers&quot; in 1936.

An oft-recounted story from the 1936 festival is of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s intervention to stop the orchestra mocking the 22-year-old Britten&#x27;s work. Vaughan Williams told them they were &quot;in the presence of greatness&quot; (referring to the young composer) and that if they did not want to play Britten&#x27;s work they would not play his (Vaughan Williams was premiering his own &quot;Five Tudor Portraits&quot; at the same festival).

As a musical festival, it also attracted prestigious musical directors including Sir Henry Wood, Sir Thomas Beecham, Sir Malcolm Sargent, Norman Del Mar and Vernon Handley.

The festival became an annual event in 1989 following an agreement with directors of Festival Norwich (FN). FN was started in 1986 as the first annual festival of arts and music in Norfolk devoted to organising a wide range of activities embracing art, music and industry in Norfolk. The directors of the Triennial were approached with the proposal that FN would run for two consecutive years with the Triennial continuing every third year. However, the Triennial decided that it should be an annual event itself and it was agreed that in this case FN would cease functioning after only three years. 
Under the direction of Marcus Davey, now director of The Roundhouse in London, the scope of the festival was changed from classical music to cater for a larger variety of music, theatre, dance and other visual arts. As part of the widening of the festival&#x27;s scope, a new art initiative called &quot;First Norfolk and Norwich Festival Visual Arts Week&quot; was begun in 1994, which has now evolved into Norfolk &amp; Norwich Open Studios, an open gallery event.

==21st century==

A significant change in 2001 was the moving of the festival from October to May. From 2004 to 2010 it was under the direction of Jonathan Holloway, now Artistic Director of the Melbourne Festival in Australia. During the years Jonathan was Artistic Director and Chief Executive of the Norfolk &amp; Norwich Festival, audiences increased by 1,000%, turnover more than quadrupled and the Festival took over delivery of Creative Partnerships in Norfolk, part of the UK flagship creativity in schools programme.

Composers who visited the Festival during this period include Philip Glass, Ute Lemper, Michael Nyman, John Cale and Laurie Anderson, Terry Riley, Ray Davies and David Bedford have also performed at the festival.

The 2010 programme featured the Michael Clark Company, 7 doigts de la main, Ontroerend Goed, Nofit State Circus, Circus Ronaldo and Forced Entertainment (amongst others) and 2011 featured Artichoke&#x27;s &quot;Dining with Alice&quot;, Chouf Ouchouf, Mariano Pensotti, Mariza and Kronos Quartet among others. Recent musical commissions include Dan Jones&#x27;s &quot;Music For Seven Ice Cream Vans&quot;. Holloway was succeeded by William Galinsky, formerly the organiser of the Cork Midsummer Festival in Ireland. In October 2017, it was announced that Daniel Brine would be taking over as Festival Director.

2020 saw the festival go on hiatus caused by COVID-19 pandemic and will return in 2021.

==Creative partnerships and bridge schemes==
The Festival was the main East Anglian participant in the creative learning schools&#x27; programme, working with 49 Norfolk schools. The Creative Partnerships scheme has been cut by the government, but from 2012/13 the Festival will receive a total of £1.35 million annually from Arts Council England to enable it to become a bridge organisation for developing arts opportunities for children and young people, acting as a bridge between the arts and education sectors.

<text>François Magendie (6 October 1783 – 7 October 1855) was a French physiologist, considered a pioneer of experimental physiology. He is known for describing the foramen of Magendie. There is also a &quot;Magendie sign&quot;, a downward and inward rotation of the eye due to a lesion in the cerebellum. Magendie was a faculty at the College of France, holding the Chair of Medicine from 1830 to 1855 (he was succeeded by Claude Bernard, who worked previously as his assistant).

In 1816 he published &quot;Précis élementaire de Physiologie&quot; which described an experiment first illustrating the concept of empty calories:
:I took a dog of three years old, fat, and in good health, and put it to feed upon sugar alone...It expired the 32nd day of the experiment.

His most important contribution to science was also his most disputed. Contemporaneous to Sir Charles Bell, Magendie conducted a number of experiments on the nervous system, in particular verifying the differentiation between sensory and motor nerves in the spinal cord, the so-called Bell–Magendie law. This led to an intense rivalry, with the British claiming that Bell published his discoveries first and that Magendie stole his experiments. The intensity of this scientific rivalry perhaps can only be compared to that between Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke.

Magendie was also a notorious vivisector, shocking even many of his contemporaries with the live dissections that he performed at public lectures in physiology. Richard Martin, an Irish MP, in introducing his famous bill banning animal cruelty in the United Kingdom, described Magendie&#x27;s public dissection of a greyhound, in which the beast was nailed down ear and paw, half the nerves of its face dissected then left overnight for further dissection, calling Magendie a &quot;disgrace to Society.&quot; There was a belief among British physicians, even those who defended animal experimentation, that Magendie purposely subjected his experimental animals to needless torture. A Quaker once visited him, questioning him about vivisection; according to Anne Fagot-Largeault&#x27;s inaugural lesson at the College of France, he responded with much patience, argumenting the reasons of animal experimentation. Besides drawing sharp criticism from contemporaries in both Britain and France, Magendie&#x27;s methods were later criticized by, among others, Charles Darwin and Thomas Henry Huxley.

Colin White credits to Magendie the earliest version of the phrase &quot;Lies, damned lies, and statistics&quot;. While arguing against using blood-letting to treat fever, and confronted with statistical numbers he believed to be manufactured, Magendie stated: &quot;Thus the alteration of the truth which is already manifesting itself in the progressive form of lying and perjury, offers us, in the superlative, the statistics.&quot;
