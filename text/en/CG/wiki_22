<text>Naturalistic observation, sometimes referred to as fieldwork, is a research methodology in numerous fields of science including ethology, anthropology, linguistics, the social sciences, and psychology, in which data are collected as they occur in nature, without any manipulation by the observer. Examples range from watching an animal&#x27;s eating patterns in the forest to observing the behavior of students in a school setting. During naturalistic observation, researchers take great care using unobtrusive methods to avoid interfering with the behavior they are observing. Naturalistic observation contrasts with analog observation in an artificial setting that is designed to be an analog of the natural situation, constrained so as to eliminate or control for effects of any variables other than those of interest. There is similarity to observational studies in which the independent variable of interest cannot be experimentally controlled for ethical or logistical reasons.

Naturalistic observation has both advantages and disadvantages as a research methodology. Observations are more credible because the behavior occurs in a real, typical scenario as opposed to an artificial one generated within a lab. Behavior that could never occur in controlled laboratory environment can lead to new insights. Naturalistic observation also allows for study of events that are deemed unethical to study experimentally, such as the impact of high school shootings on students attending the high school. However, because extraneous variables cannot be controlled as in a laboratory, it is difficult to replicate findings and demonstrate their reliability. In particular, if subjects know they are being observed they may behave differently than otherwise. It may be difficult to generalize findings of naturalistic studies beyond the observed situations.

<text>It Happened Here (also known as It Happened Here: The Story of Hitler&#x27;s England) is a 1964 British black-and-white war film written, produced and directed by Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo, who began work on the film as teenagers. The film&#x27;s largely amateur and independent production took some eight years, using volunteer actors with some support from professional filmmakers.

&quot;It Happened Here&quot; shows an alternative history in which the United Kingdom has been invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II. The plot follows the experiences of an Irish nurse working in England, who encounters people who believe collaboration with the invaders is for the best, while others are involved in the resistance movement against the occupiers and their local collaborators. The film&#x27;s title is an allusion to Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s 1935 novel &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;.

==Plot==
===Setting===
The film opens with the statement: &quot;The German invasion of Britain took place in 1940 after the retreat from Dunkirk.&quot; After months of fierce resistance and brutal reprisals, the occupying forces manage to restore order, largely suppressing the resistance movement. However, due to continued fierce fighting between Soviet and German forces in the Ural Mountains, most German troops are eventually removed from Western Europe to reinforce the Eastern Front. As a result, the garrisoning of Britain is largely carried out by local collaborationist volunteers and auxiliaries in the German Army and the SS.

England appears to be governed by the British Union of Fascists; the followers are referred to as &quot;Blackshirts&quot;, wear uniforms with the Flash and Circle, and a framed portrait of Oswald Mosley appears in a government building, alongside one of Adolf Hitler. Meanwhile, the United States, having entered the war, stations its Seventh Fleet off Ireland. The Americans begin bombing raids on the southwest coast of England, as well as supplying men and equipment to a resurgent partisan movement.

===Story===
Set in 1944–1945, the story focuses on an apolitical Irish district nurse, Pauline. Following an upsurge in partisan activity in her area, she is forcibly evacuated from her village by the Germans and their collaborators and witnesses an attack on German forces by a group of British partisans, during which a number of her friends from the village are killed in the crossfire. The attack (and more particularly the deaths) influences her subsequent views and decisions.

She is evacuated to London, where she reluctantly becomes a collaborator, joining the medical wing of the Immediate Action Organisation (IAO), a quasi-paramilitary medical corps, and is re-trained as an ambulance attendant. Although at first reluctant and intent on remaining apolitical, Pauline begins to show the effects of fascist indoctrination in her behaviour. It is a reunion with old friends (an antifascist doctor and his wife) that gives Pauline pause, and when she subsequently discovers they are harbouring an injured partisan, she reluctantly agrees to help.

Gradually Pauline learns more about the impacts of the German occupation, and she sees her friends arrested. The discovery of her association with the antifascist couple by her superiors in the IAO leads to her demotion and transfer to another part of the country. She welcomes the move at first, as her new job appears to have less of the paramilitary trappings. However, Pauline discovers that she has unwittingly taken part in a forced euthanasia programme and killed a group of foreign forced labourers who had contracted tuberculosis.

The film ends with Pauline being arrested after protesting and refusing to continue; but before she can be put on trial, she is captured by the resurgent British Resistance and agrees to work for them as they fight to liberate the country with the help of arriving American troops. In the finale, Pauline tends a group of wounded partisans while, out of her view, a large group of soldiers from the &quot;Black Prince Regiment&quot; of the British Legion of the Waffen-SS who had surrendered are summarily shot.

==Production==
The film was directed by Kevin Brownlow, who later became a prominent film historian, and Andrew Mollo, who would later become a leading military historian. Brownlow developed the concept of the film when he was 18 years old, in 1956. He turned to Mollo, a 16-year-old history buff, to help him with the design of costumes and sets. Mollo was intrigued by the project, and became his collaborator. The film was in the making for the next eight years.

&quot;It Happened Here&quot; was shot in black and white on 16 mm film, giving it a grainy newsreel appearance, though no actual stock footage was used. Most of the equipment used in the production was borrowed. The audio quality and lighting on the opening reel are rather poor, which makes the dialogue difficult to follow for the first few minutes. The scenes set in Salisbury in the earlier part of the film were photographed and edited by Peter Watkins. Stanley Kubrick, who was intrigued by the project, donated film stock from &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; to Brownlow to help him finish the film. Veteran wartime BBC radio announcers Alvar Lidell and John Snagge gave their services free to voice reconstructed newsreels and radio broadcasts. Support was also given by director Tony Richardson, who helped to pay for the final production.

The film had an estimated cast of 900, all volunteers, with several professional actors among them Sebastian Shaw and Reginald Marsh. A number of the extras in the film were members of British science fiction fandom, and a portion was previewed at a science fiction convention in Peterborough. Many of the British fascists in the film were themselves former members of the British Union of Fascists, and similarly, German ex-servicemen portrayed SS and Wehrmacht soldiers and airmen. The key role of Pauline, a nurse evacuated from Salisbury to London, was played by Pauline Murray. The film was partially shot in Grim&#x27;s Dyke. Though the cast was almost entirely amateur, &quot;It Happened Here&quot; helped to launch the career of its cinematographer, Peter Suschitzky, who went on to work on such films as &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;It Happened Here&quot; premiered in September 1964 at the Cork Film Festival and was shown one month later at the German Mannheim International Film Week. Some Jewish groups protested against the inclusion of seven minutes of footage of a British fascist speaking against the Jews and for euthanasia, claiming the inclusion of this material gives a platform to unapologetic neo-Nazis despite the film&#x27;s strongly anti-Nazi theme. In response, this was cut from the original release, though it was restored thirty years later, after Brownlow regained the rights to the film.

==Reception==
After eight years of production, the film&#x27;s initial release was stormy. Many people were upset by the idea that the villains in the story were not just the Nazis but their British collaborators. The film seemed to be saying that fascism can rise anywhere under the right circumstances, and that people everywhere could fall under its spell.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The acting by unfamiliar people is beautifully natural and restrained, particularly that of Pauline Murray in the principal role. Through her human and subtle generation of an ungrudging sympathy, one becomes involved in her dilemma and is caught up all the way in the despair, uncertainty and terror of her experiences.&quot;

===Awards===
* 1964: International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg, Preis der Volkshochschul-Jury (Prize of the Adult Education Center&#x27;s Jury)
* 1966: National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, Top Ten Films

==&quot;How It Happened Here&quot;==
In 1968, Brownlow published the story of the making of the film under the title &quot;How It Happened Here&quot;. The book (new edition published March 2007, by UKA Press, ) describes the making of the film &quot;It Happened Here,&quot; and the subsequent reception that the film received. In addition to explaining how two teenage boys made a feature film, it also explores the social issues raised by the movie. The book contains almost 100 pictures, mostly stills from the film, and an introduction by David Robinson.

<doc id="980446" wikidata="Q7965159" url="?curid=980446" title="Walter Hook">
<text>Walter Farquhar Hook (13 March 1798 – 20 October 1875), known to his contemporaries as Dr Hook, was an eminent Victorian churchman.

He was the Vicar of Leeds responsible for the construction of the current Leeds Minster and for many ecclesiastical and social improvements to the city in the mid-nineteenth century. His achievements, as a High Churchman and Tractarian in a non-conformist city are remarkable. Later in life, he became Dean of Chichester.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Hook was born the son of James Hook, FRS and his wife Anne Farquhar, daughter of Sir Walter Farquhar MD, in London on 13 March 1798, and educated first at Blundell&#x27;s School in Tiverton, Devon, then Winchester College, and Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated in 1821. He obtained his MA in 1824, and his BD and DD in 1837. On taking Holy Orders in 1822, he served first as a curate at his father&#x27;s church, St Mildred&#x27;s Church, Whippingham on the Isle of Wight, later as vicar at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Moseley, Birmingham, and, in 1828, vicar of the Holy Trinity Church, Coventry. He married Anna Delicia, (1811 – 5 April 1871) daughter of Dr John Johnstone of Birmingham on 4 June 1829 and they had several children. One daughter, Charlotte Jane Hook, married William Stephens, who went on to be Dean on Winchester from 1895 to 1902.

===Leeds===
His support for the ideals of the Tractarians exposed him to considerable criticism, but his &quot;simple manly character and zealous devotion to parochial work gained him the support of widely divergent classes&quot;, according to the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

Leeds invited him to be its Vicar in 1837. The city was expanding as one of the seats of the early Industrial Revolution, in which non-conformists played a large part. The established church in the city was a minority denomination and dissenters were even elected as churchwardens. In 1842 the elections produced a slate of Chartist churchwardens.

Hook rebuilt his church, using the church rate levied by the city authorities; this was in the face of objections from non-conformists. He went on to drive through the division of Leeds into 21 parishes, each with its own church. He accepted a reduction in his income and moved to a smaller parsonage, under a deal meaning that ground-floor seats of parish churches in Leeds were bought by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, rather than allowing pew rentals

Hook fostered the building and support of some 30 schools. His interest in the education of children was contentious at the time, before the Education Acts of the late nineteenth century. His insistence on the necessity of education, and the duty of society to provide it, to some extent, was not what some of his richest parishioners believed.

The minster remains as a physical legacy of Hook&#x27;s work, being a significant early High Church Gothic revival design.

===Chichester===
Hook left Leeds to take up the Deanery of Chichester in 1859. He was appointed honorary chaplain of the Chichester-based 1st Administrative Battalion, Sussex Rifle Volunteer Corps, on 13 August 1864. He died 20 October 1875 and was buried in Mid Lavant, a small village near Chichester.

==Honours==

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1862 as someone &quot;Eminent as a Divine. Author of the Lives of the Archbishops of Canterbury, of The Ecclesiastical Biography, Church Dictionary &amp; several other works.&quot;

A memorial to Hook was built in the Leeds Parish Church, and in 1903 a statue was erected to him in City Square, in the company of a select few other leading fathers of the city. What is now All Souls&#x27; Church, Blackman Lane in Leeds was built by public subscription as the Hook Memorial.

His son in law William Stephens dedicated his 1896 book &quot;Memorials of the South Saxon See and Cathedral Church of Winchester&quot; to his memory.

<doc id="980450" wikidata="Q2738955" url="?curid=980450" title="United States national cricket team">
<text>The United States men&#x27;s national cricket team is the team that represents the United States in international cricket. The team was formerly organized by the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA), which became an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1965. In June 2017, the USACA was expelled by the ICC due to governance and financing issues, with the U.S. team being temporarily overseen by ICC Americas until a new sanctioning body was established. In January 2019, associate membership was officially granted to USA Cricket.

A U.S. representative team participated in the first international cricket match, played against Canada, in 1844. For a century and a half, the U.S. national team seldom played against other national teams. It played mostly against Canada (in the annual Auty Cup), or against visiting teams from other countries.

The United States made its international tournament debut at the 1979 ICC Trophy in England; it has since missed only two editions of the tournament (now known as the World Cup Qualifier). After winning the 2004 ICC Six Nations Challenge, the team qualified for the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, playing its first two One Day International (ODI) matches. In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between the United States and other ICC members after January 1, 2019, have the T20I status. The first T20I to be played by the United States was scheduled against the United Arab Emirates in March 2019.

In the World Cricket League, the U.S. finished fourth in the 2019 Division Two tournament, losing a third place playoff to Papua New Guinea, a match which was designated as an ODI (and thus became the United States&#x27; third-ever ODI match, 15 years after their last). This fourth-place finish was sufficient to earn the country a place in 2019–22 ICC Cricket World Cup League 2, in which all the team&#x27;s matches would carry ODI status. The team&#x27;s first domestic ODI series began on September 13, 2019, hosting Papua New Guinea and Namibia.

==History==

===Beginnings===

Cricket was played throughout the Thirteen Colonies during the period of British America in the early 18th century. Cricket further grew in the 18th century. It is understood from anecdotal evidence that George Washington was a strong supporter of cricket, participating on at least one occasion in a game of wicket with his troops at Valley Forge during the American Revolution. John Adams was recorded as saying in Congress that if leaders of cricket clubs could be called &quot;presidents&quot;, there was no reason why the leader of the new nation could not be called the same.

In 1844, the United States participated in the first international cricket match. This was played against Canada at the St George&#x27;s Cricket Club Ground, Bloomingdale Park, New York. This first international sporting event was attended by 20,000 people and established the longest international sporting rivalry in the modern era. Wagers of around $120,000 were placed on the outcome of the match. This is equivalent to around $1.5 million in 2007.

Sides from England toured North America (taking in both the U.S. and Canada) following the English cricket seasons of 1859, 1868 and 1872. These were organized as purely commercial ventures. Most of the matches of these early touring teams were played &quot;against odds&quot;, that is to say the home team was permitted to have more than eleven players (usually twenty-two) in order to make a more even contest.

===Decline===
In spite of cricket&#x27;s popularity in the 18th and early 19th centuries, the game was supplanted by baseball in the 1850s and 1860s. As interest in baseball rose, the rules of that game were changed slightly to increase its popularity. For example, easily manufactured round bats were introduced to contrast the flat bats of cricket.

Another reason for cricket&#x27;s decline in popularity may be that in the late 19th century American cricket remained an amateur sport reserved for the wealthy while England and Australia were developing a professional version of the game. As cricket standards improved with professionalism elsewhere in the world many North American cricket clubs stayed stubbornly elitist. Clubs such as Philadelphia CC and Merion abandoned cricket and converted their facilities to other sports.

By 1900, baseball was dominant numerically and culturally in the United States. In addition, when the first international body for the sport, the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC) was formed in 1909, membership was restricted to countries in the British Empire. This undercut the popularity of cricket outside the empire and reduced momentum to professionalize cricket in the United States. Whether a more open ICC would have maintained or increased the momentum remains an open question, however. Regardless of its cause, the game did not flourish in the United States the way it did in the British Empire. From the 1880s until the outbreak of World War I, cricket in the U.S. was dominated not by a truly national team, but by the amateur Philadelphia cricket team, which was selected from clubs in cricket&#x27;s American stronghold – the Philadelphia metropolitan area.

A tour of North America by the Australians in 1913 saw two first-class games (both won by the tourists) against a combined Canada–U.S. team.‌

===Philadelphian cricket===
The Philadelphian cricket team was a team that represented Philadelphia in first-class cricket between 1878 and 1913. Even though the United States had played the first international cricket match against Canada in 1844, the sport began a slow decline in the country. This decline was furthered by the rise in popularity of baseball. In Philadelphia, however, the sport remained very popular and from the end of the 19th century until the outbreak of World War I, the city produced a first class team that rivaled many kids in the world. The team was composed of players from the four chief cricket clubs in Philadelphia–Germantown, Merion, Belmont, and Philadelphia. Players from smaller clubs, such as Tioga and Moorestown, and local colleges, such as Haverford and Penn, also played for the Philadelphians. Over its 35 years, the team played in 89 first-class cricket matches. Of those, 29 were won, 46 were lost, 13 were drawn and one game was abandoned before completion.

Arguably, the greatest American cricketer ever played for Philadelphia during this period. John Barton King was a very skilled batsman, but really proved his worth as a bowler. During his career, he set numerous records in North America and at least one first-class bowling record. He competed with and succeeded against the best cricketers in the world from England and Australia. King was the dominant bowler on his team when it toured England in 1897, 1903, and 1908. He dismissed batsmen with his unique delivery, which he called &quot;the angler&quot;, and helped to perfect swing bowling in the sport. Many of the great bowlers of today still use the strategies and techniques that he developed. Sir Pelham Warner described Bart King as one of the finest bowlers of all time, and Donald Bradman called him &quot;America&#x27;s greatest cricketing son.&quot;

On June 28, 1913, the Philadelphians played the last first-class game on the mainland for more than 90 years. Games were played in the US Virgin Islands in the interim, which is considered as part of the West Indies by the ICC. The team had played an American national side 6 times between 1885 and 1894. The United States team won one of these matches, lost two, and earned a draw in three. Cricket remained a minor pastime in the United States until the mid-1960s, when ICC reforms allowed associate members to join.

===Status from 1965===
In 1965, Clifford Severn made his U.S. debut at 39, alongside his young brother Winston, in a two-day match against Canada at Calgary&#x27;s Riley Park as part of the longest running international rivalry in international cricket, now known as the Auty Cup. A year later in the return contest at the C. Aubrey Smith Field in Los Angeles, the USA won by 54 runs.

In 1965, the Imperial Cricket Conference changed its name to the International Cricket Conference. In addition, new rules were adopted to permit the election of countries from outside the Commonwealth. This led to the expansion of the conference, with the admission of Associate Members, including the United States. Today cricket is played in all fifty states.

The U.S. have played in every edition of the ICC Trophy, though they didn&#x27;t pass the first round until the 1990 tournament in the Netherlands. They reached the plate final of the 1994 tournament, but opted not to play due to prior travel arrangements. They finished twelfth in 1997.

===21st century===

====2000–09====

The U.S. finished sixth in the 2001 ICC Trophy, their best performance to date. They have also played in every edition of the ICC Americas Championship, winning in 2002.

In 2004, the United States cricket team played a first-class match as part of the first ICC Intercontinental Cup. The matches against Canada and Bermuda were the first in many years. The team won the ICC 6 Nations Challenge beating Scotland, Namibia, the Netherlands, and the UAE on net run rate by 0.028 of a run.

Winning the ICC Six Nations meant that they qualified for the ICC Champions Trophy 2004 in England. Here the U.S. played their first One Day International match against New Zealand at The Oval on September 10, 2004.

The U.S. side was beaten by New Zealand and lost to Australia in the tournament, as well.

The 2005 ICC Trophy represented a chance for the U.S. to re-establish themselves on the world stage and qualify for the 2007 World Cup. A poor showing saw them finish at the bottom of their group, with four losses and a match abandoned due to rain from their five group fixtures. This failure robbed the USA of the prize of full One Day International status on offer to the World Cup qualifiers. This failure was compounded on August 9, 2005, when the ICC removed the U.S. from the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup after legal disputes prevented them from naming a squad.

The United States made their return to international cricket in August 2006 when they participated in Division One of the ICC Americas Championship in Canada. They finished second in the five team tournament.

In 2007 the United States were to visit Darwin, Australia to take part in Division Three of the ICC World Cricket League. A top two finish in this tournament would have qualified them for Division Two of the same tournament later in the year. However, amid internal disputes over the constitution of the USACA, the team was forced to withdraw after the ICC suspended the USACA in March 2007. The dispute was resolved in early 2008, and the suspension was lifted on April 1 of that year.

The team&#x27;s reinstatement permitted them to enter the World Cricket League in Division Five for 2008 in Jersey. The team made it through the Group Stage tied for first in their division with a 4–0–0 record (one match abandoned), but lost both their semi-final match with Jersey and their third-place play-off with Nepal.

====2010–2015====

The U.S. finished second in the 2010 Division Five after losing the final against Nepal and won promotion to 2010 Division Four. They continued their climb in more emphatic style by finishing first in 2010 Division Four, demolishing Italy in the final. They were promoted to 2011 Division Three where they took last place and were relegated to 2012 Division Four. There they finished in second place, and were promoted back to 2013 Division Three. They remained in Division Three after finishing in third place, but were relegated after finishing fifth in 2014 Division Three.

====2015 suspension====

On June 26, 2015, the ICC again suspended USACA, this time because an ICC review &quot;had expressed significant concerns about the governance, finance, reputation and cricketing activities of USACA&quot;. This suspension does not impact the National Team playing Matches, but instead cuts off ICC funding and stops USACA from being able to approve any events held in the United States (although the ICC can still approve events held in the United States). This suspension will be upheld until USACA can show the ICC that &quot;conditions relating to governance, finance and its cricket activities&quot; have improved.

In the 2016 World Cricket League Division Four, the United States finished second with a 3–2 record and was promoted to Division Three for 2017. In the 2017 Division Three competition, the U.S. finished fourth, with a 2–3 record. The third place match was rained out and finished with no result. The United States remained in Division Three.

====2017–2023: Transition to USA Cricket, Cricket World Cup League 2====
On June 22, 2017, at the ICC Annual Conference in London, the ICC Full Council voted unanimously to expel the USACA over governance and finance issues, following a Board recommendation in April, and a recent Dispute Resolution Committee hearing before Michael Beloff, which concluded in June 2017. In January 2019, a new sanctioning body known as USA Cricket was officially admitted by the ICC as a new associate member.

After beating Singapore in the final match of the 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Three, the United States were promoted to the Division Two for the first time. In April 2019, after finishing in the top 4 of the 2019 Division Two tournament, the United States qualified for the 2019–22 ICC Cricket World Cup League 2—which offers an opportunity to advance to the 2022 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. All matches in the Cricket World Cup League 2 are played in the One Day International format.

As of 2019, all ICC members were granted Twenty20 International (T20I) status. The United States made its T20I debut on March 15, 2019, against the United Arab Emirates at the ICC Academy Ground in Dubai.
In November 2021, Ireland announced that it would play a five-match limited overs series against the United States in December 2021, leading into its ODI series against the West Indies in January 2022. This marked the first time that the United States had ever hosted a bilateral series with a Test nation. The series began with two T20Is; after a slow start, a high-scoring partnership of Sushant Modani and Gajanand Singh bolstered the team during the second half of its innings, contributing to a total haul of 188 runs. With Ireland falling short by 26 runs, the United States achieved its first-ever victory in an international match against a Test nation.
Ireland split the T20I series in the second match; batting first, the team was bowled out at 150, but the United States fell short in their innings by nine runs. The series was expected to continue on with ODI matches. However, on December 28, 2021, the entirety of the ODI series was cancelled after multiple postponements due to COVID-19 issues.

In December 2022, following its tour of Namibia, USA Cricket announced that Jagadeesh Arunkumar had been released as head coach of the men&#x27;s national team.

==== 2023–present: T20 World Cup, World Cup League 2 ====
The United States took part in the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier Play-off. They qualified for the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier by defeating Jersey by 25 runs, making it their first appearance in the ICC World Cup Qualifier since 2005.

Following a 4-0 whitewash of Canada in April, the United States played the Bangladeshi cricket team in a 3-game T20I series for first time. The United States won the first match of the series by 5 wickets, their first victory against Bangladesh across all formats, before securing their first series victory against a full member team in the second match by 6 runs.

The games were played as preparation ahead of their debut at the 2024 T20 World Cup, which the United States co-hosted alongside the West Indies. In their debut World Cup game, the United States defeated rivals Canada by seven wickets. During their second match on June 6, the Americans upset heavily favored Pakistan in a Super Over for their second win of the tournament. The United States&#x27; shock defeat of Pakistan brought about widespread media exposure and also sparked optimism about the win potentially reflecting a &quot;cricket transformation&quot; in the U.S.

The team&#x27;s final group stage match against Ireland was rained out with no result, with both teams therefore receiving one point. The result ensured that the United States would clinch a second-place finish in their group and advance to the Super 8s (at the expense of Pakistan, Canada, and Ireland), and also automatically qualify for the 2026 Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup as a result.

On February 18, 2025, during a 2024–2026 Cricket World Cup League 2 match against Oman in the 2025 Oman Tri-Nation Series, the United States achieved the lowest total successfully defended in a men&#x27;s ODI, with 122 runs.

==Captains==

Eight players have represented the United States as captain. The first American captain was Anil Kashkari, who was reprised of his role in 1979.

Richard Staple was the first American captain to captain the side in a One Day International (ODI), which occurred in 2004. After Staple retired in 2005, Steve Massiah took over his role as captain. However, Sushil Nadkarni captained the American side during the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier.

In October 2013, Neil McGarrell was named U.S. captain in a 15-man squad for the 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in the UAE. McGarrell had played four Tests and 17 ODIs for West Indies between 1998 and 2001. He made his debut for U.S. in 2012 against Canada and takes over from Steve Massiah who had captained for seven years.

In 2016, Steven Taylor was named as captain of the team, he led the U.S. to WCL Division four title on home soil in Los Angeles. Later when the U.S. failed to progress from Division three, he stepped down as captain to accept a professional contract with the Jamaica Scorpions. He had earlier captained the team in the 2013 Auty Cup against Canada, he was chosen as a stand-in captain for unavailable Steve Massiah.

In October 2018, Saurabh Netravalkar took over as captain of the team, after Ibrahim Khaleel was sacked. Khaleel was elected captain in 2017 and under his captainship USA won Auty Cup after a long gap.

In October 2021, Monank Patel took over as T20I and ODI captain from Saurabh Netravalkar.

In May 2024, Monank Patel was named as a captain in USA squad for 2024 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup Tournament. Patel was injured during a group stage match, and Aaron Jones took over the captaincy for the rest of the tournament.

<doc id="980466" wikidata="Q1545761" url="?curid=980466" title="Grevillea">
<text>Grevillea (), commonly known as spider flowers, is a genus of about 360 species of evergreen flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. Plants in the genus &quot;Grevillea&quot; are shrubs, rarely trees, with the leaves arranged alternately along the branches, the flowers zygomorphic, arranged in racemes at the ends of branchlets, and the fruit a follicle that splits down one side only, releasing one or two seeds.

==Description==
Plants in the genus &quot;Grevillea&quot; are shrubs, rarely small trees with simple or compound leaves arranged alternately along the branchlets. The flowers are zygomorphic and typically arranged in pairs along a sometimes branched raceme at the ends of branchlets. The flowers are bisexual, usually with four tepals in a single whorl. There are four stamens and the gynoecium has a single carpel. The fruit is a thin-walled follicle that splits down only one side, releasing one or two seeds before the next growing season.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Grevillea&quot; was first formally described in 1809 by Joseph Knight from an unpublished manuscript by Robert Brown. Knight gave the spelling &quot;Grevillia&quot;, corrected by Brown in 1810 to &quot;Grevillea&quot; in &quot;Transactions of the Linnean Society of London&quot;. The genus was named in honour of Charles Francis Greville, an 18th-century patron of botany and co-founder of the Royal Horticultural Society.

===Species===
There are over 380 species which are endemic to Australia. 15 other species are endemic to areas outside Australia. Ten of these are endemic to New Caledonia, while &quot;G. elbertii&quot; and &quot;G. papuana&quot; are endemic to Sulawesi and New Guinea respectively. Two other species, &quot;G. baileyana&quot; and &quot;G. glauca&quot;, occur in both New Guinea and Queensland.

==Distribution and habitat==
Grevilleas grow in most habitats, although few grow in alpine areas, in swamps or saline soils. Most species are endemic to Australia but four species grow in New Guinea, (&quot;G. papuana&quot; is endemic), ten are endemic to New Caledonia and one species (&quot;G. elbertii&quot;) is endemic to Sulawesi in Indonesia.

==Ecology==

===Pollination===
Many animals rely on the pollen and nectar from grevilleas as a source of food, in particular, insects and birds. Generally, the insect-pollinated species tend to be white, whereas the bird-pollinated species are varying shades of red, pink and other bright hues.

;Birds
Most species of grevillea appear well-adapted to pollination by birds. Many of these species produce brightly-coloured inflorescences and produce large quantities of nectar. The most prominent avian pollinators of grevilleas are the honeyeaters, in which almost all species which coexist with grevilleas have been observed feeding from and pollinating them. Parrots such as lorikeets which have special adaptations for nectivory are also likely pollinators of grevilleas.

; Insects
Insects such as beetles, flies and bees are important pollinators of many species of grevillea. The insect-pollinated species tend to have smaller, more fragrant flowers than bird-pollinated species as a way to attract their preferred pollinators, as insects are more drawn to fragrances than birds are. The flowers of these grevilleas are usually white or cream in colour (though may also be brightly coloured) and appear during the summer months to coincide with the population increase of many insects.

Scarab beetles are attracted to the smell of nectar and species such as the white plume grevillea (&quot;G. leptobotrys&quot;) appear to be mainly pollinated by these and other beetles.

===As an invasive species===
Some species of grevillea have become naturalised outside of their native distribution, thus becoming invasive. The most notable of which being &quot;G. robusta&quot;, also known as silky oak. Native to eastern Queensland and far northern New South Wales, it has been introduced to other parts of Australia and around the world. It has become an environmental weed in other parts of Australia and has been introduced to numerous other countries including New Zealand, French Polynesia, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Hawaii and Florida in the United States, where it is regarded as invasive.

Other species such as &quot;G. banksii&quot; have also been introduced well outside of their native range as ornamental plants and may regarded as invasive.

==Conservation==
The International Union for Conservation of Nature currently has 331 species of grevillea on the IUCN Red List, with 119 or more than 35% being in a threatened category (Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable). 30 of those species are listed as Critically Endangered, meaning they face an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. Some of these species include Caley&#x27;s grevillea (&quot;G. caleyi&quot;), Woolly cluster grevillea (&quot;G. eribotrya&quot;), Foote&#x27;s grevillea (&quot;G.&quot; &quot;calliantha),&quot; Tumut grevillea (&quot;G. wilkinsonii&quot;) and in New Caledonia, Lanterne rouge d’Unia (&quot;G. vuniana&quot;).

The Australian Government &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; lists 45 species and 11 subspecies as being in a threatened category.

The main threats to grevillea species include habitat clearing for roads, mining, housing, agriculture and grazing, altered fire regimes and competition with both invasive and native species.
==Toxicity==
Some commonly cultivated grevilleas including fuchsia grevillea, (&quot;G. bipinnatifida&quot;) &quot;G. banksii&quot; and related cultivars and hybrids contain toxic cyanide. The greatest concentration of cyanoglucosides is found in the flowers, immature leaves, immature seeds and seedlings.

Species including &quot;G. banksii&quot; and the common cultivar &quot;Grevillea&quot; &#x27;Robyn Gordon&#x27; are responsible for allergic contact dermatitis as they contain pentadecylresorcinol (adipostatin A) and tridecylresorcinol, also known as grevillol. These compounds are chemically similar to urushiol, a compound which causes skin rashes and is found in poison ivy and other members of the &quot;Toxicodendron&quot; genus.

==Uses==

===Use in horticulture===
Many species of grevilleas are popular garden plants, especially in Australia but also in other temperate and subtropical climates. Many grevilleas have a propensity to interbreed freely, and extensive hybridisation and selection of horticulturally desirable attributes has led to the commercial release of many named cultivars. Among the best known is &#x27;Robyn Gordon&#x27;, a small shrub up to high and wide which can flower 12 months of the year in subtropical climates. The cultivar &#x27;Canberra Gem&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

They can be grown from soft tip cuttings from December–March (in the Southern Hemisphere) or fresh seed. Many harder-to-grow species can be grafted onto hardy rootstock such as &quot;Grevillea robusta&quot;.

There is an active Grevillea Study Group in the Australian Native Plants Society for people interested in grevilleas, both for uses in horticulture and for conservation in the wild.

===Traditional Aboriginal use===
In Australia, many Aboriginal peoples utilise grevilleas for a wide variety of uses, including food, medicine, tools and ceremonial purposes. 

Seeds from some species are used as food, such as from the prickly plume grevillea (&quot;G. annulifera&quot;) of Western Australia and rock grevillea or djamudu (&quot;G. heliosperma&quot;) by the Bardi people of the Northern Territory.

The most common and widespread use of grevillea as food among Aboriginal Australians is consuming the nectar. Although some grevillea flowers contain toxic compounds, some species such as &quot;G. eriostachya, G. juncifolia&quot; and &quot;G. pteridifolia&quot; of northern and western Australia and &quot;G. lanigera&quot; of south-eastern Australia are used. Flowers are either directly chewed and sucked or entire inflorescences are soaked in water to create a sweet, sugary drink.

===Colonial furniture===
A grevillea wood veneer was used on a Pembroke table, a small table with two drawers and folding sides, made in the 1790s for Commissioner of the Royal Navy, Sir Andrew Snape Hamond. The timber from which the veneer was made, referred to as &#x27;beef wood&#x27;, was sent from Port Jackson by Surgeon-General John White, who arrived in the new penal colony of Australia with the First Fleet. This table is in the collection of the National Museum of Australia in Canberra.

<doc id="980475" wikidata="Q417922" url="?curid=980475" title="CR gas">
<text>CR gas or dibenzoxazepine (chemical name dibenz[&quot;b&quot;,&quot;f&quot;][1,4]oxazepine, is an incapacitating agent and a lachrymatory agent. CR was developed by the British Ministry of Defence as a riot control agent in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A report from the Porton Down laboratories described exposure as &quot;like being thrown blindfolded into a bed of stinging nettles&quot;, and it earned the nickname &quot;firegas&quot;.

In its effects, CR gas is very similar to CS gas (&quot;o&quot;-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile), but twice as potent, even though there is little structural resemblance between the two. For example, 2 mg of dry CR causes skin redness in 10 min, 5 mg causes burning and erythremia, and strong pain. Water usually amplifies the pain effect of CR on skin. CR aerosols cause irritation at concentrations of 0.2 mcg/L, becoming intolerable at 3 mcg/L. The of CR through air inhalation 350 mg·min/L.

==Physical properties and deployment==
CR is a pale yellow crystalline solid with a spicy odor. It is slightly soluble in water and does not degrade in it. CR is usually presented as a microparticulate solid, in the form of suspension in a propylene glycol-based liquid. Contrary to its common name, it is not a gas but a solid at room temperature.

The dibenz[b,f][1,4]oxazepine moiety is present in the typical antipsychotic drug loxapine, but, unlike CR, loxapine is not reactive and is not an irritant. CR was first synthesised in 1962.

CR can be delivered either as an aerosol or a solution in water, making it able to be used in water cannons, smoke grenades, or handheld spray cans. For smoke it is usually fired in canisters (LACR) that heat up, producing an aerosol cloud at a steady rate.

==Effects==
CR gas is a lachrymatory agent (LA), exerting its effects through activation of the TRPA1 channel. Its effects are approximately 6 to 10 times more powerful than those of CS gas. CR causes intense skin irritation, in particular around moist areas; blepharospasm, causing temporary blindness; and coughing, gasping for breath, and panic. It is capable of causing immediate incapacitation. It is a suspected carcinogen. It is toxic, but less so than CS gas, by ingestion and exposure. However, it can be lethal in large quantities. In a poorly ventilated space, an individual may inhale a lethal dose within minutes. Death is caused by asphyxiation and pulmonary edema.

The effect of CR is long-term and persistent. CR can persist on surfaces, especially porous ones, for up to 60 days.

==Treatment==
While CS can be decontaminated with a large amount of water, use of water may exacerbate the effects of CR. Skin contaminated with CR gas may become extremely painful in contact with water for up to 48 hours after contamination.

Medical treatment is mostly palliative. The contaminated clothing has to be removed. The eyes and skin can be washed, the eye pain can be alleviated with medications.

==Use==
===Egypt===
During the 2011 protests against the military government in Egypt, Egyptian security forces allegedly used CR gas in addition to the more commonly used, less debilitating CS gas. One protester described the gas as making him feel &quot;as if your eyes are about to fall out; then you have trouble breathing, and you lose your sight&quot;. Egyptians used yeast as a treatment for CR side effects on skin. Mohammed ElBaradei also confirmed via Twitter that &quot;tear gas with [a] nerve agent&quot; is being used in Tahrir Square.

The only gas that has been identified by human rights organizations in protests &quot;is CS tear gas, typically used by police forces to disperse crowds,&quot; stated Egyptian journalist Farida Helmy. Egyptian use of CR gas has not been corroborated according to Human Rights Watch.

===France===
People occupying an area in Notre-Dame-des-Landes against an airport project suspect the use of CR gas by French Police and Army in April 2018.

===Northern Ireland===
It started being available in police and army supplies, as a water cannon additive and as spray cans, in 1973 and was at least still so in 1981.

Republican groups in Northern Ireland have alleged that British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary units used CR gas against Republican prisoners in the 1970s. Additionally, there are British military documents now declassified and in the public domain held in the records of the UK Ministry of Defence at the National Archives, London, that suggest that the British Army did deploy and use CR gas in Northern Ireland.


===Philippines===
CR tear gas was used in suppression of the mutiny in Makati that was led by Sen. Antonio Trillanes. The tear gas was fired in the building and all the people in the building including reporters were affected.

===South Africa===
In the late 1980s, CR was used in the townships in South Africa. It caused some fatalities, in particular among children.

===Sri Lanka===
The Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka, an insurgent group in Sri Lanka used CR gas against government forces that were on an offensive to flush and defeat these insurgents during September 2008. Its use hindered the army&#x27;s progress but ultimately proved ineffective in preventing the army from overrunning their positions.
This is one of the first few cases of insurgents using CR gas as an insurgent weapon.

===Turkey===
In the June 2013 protest against the Turkish government, Turkish police allegedly used CR gas on protesters in Istanbul. Doctors in a makeshift first aid post in a Mosque judged it as such.

===Ukraine===
In Ukraine, CR gas is commonly used by special forces against demonstrators. Gas is packed in a form of spray cans &quot;Cobra 1&quot;. For example, gas has been used on a demonstration dedicated to the Ukraine Independence Day (24 August 2011). Also massive gas usage has been documented during demonstrations against Language Law Draft in Kyiv on 3 and 4 July 2012.

<doc id="980481" wikidata="Q2718849" url="?curid=980481" title="Don Pendleton">
<text>Donald Eugene Pendleton (December 12, 1927 – October 23, 1995) was an American author of fiction and non-fiction books, best known for his creation of the fictional character Mack Bolan, which have sold hundreds of millions of copies worldwide since the character&#x27;s 1969 debut. Since 1980 the Bolan adventure-espionage books were written by other authors under the Pendleton name, and initially under Pendleton&#x27;s editorial guidance. 

Other works include the &quot;Joe Copp, Private Eye&quot; series of six novels, the &quot;Ashton Ford, Psychic Detective&quot; series of six novels, and nonfiction books. He collaborated on several books with his wife, Linda Pendleton, including their popular nonfiction book, &quot;To Dance With Angels.&quot; His earlier writings in the 1960s include mysteries, sci-fi, and futuristic books. Pendleton wrote several early books under the pseudonyms Dan Britain and Stephan Gregory.

==Biography==
Don Pendleton served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, in all theaters of the war. He enlisted fraudulently at the age of 14 in 1941 and his enlistment ended in November 1947. He returned to active duty in 1952, during the Korean War, and served until 1954. He worked as a telegrapher for the Southern Pacific Railroad until 1957, and then as an air traffic control specialist for the Federal Aviation Administration. In the 1960s, he worked for Martin Marietta on the Titan missile program. He later served as an engineering administrator at NASA during the Apollo missions. Pendleton also worked on the C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft program.

At the age of 40 he started a creative writing correspondence course, but never completed it, instead turning in his first manuscript and selling it to a publisher. He is credited with creating the genre of action-adventure novels. He died in 1995, at age 67.

==Writings==

===Executioner series (1969–1980)===

The best-selling &quot;Executioner&quot; series made the men&#x27;s action-adventure genre popular in the late 1960s and 1970s, and Pendleton was known as &quot;the father of action adventure&quot;, a term he coined. Pendleton&#x27;s novels revolved around Sergeant Mack Bolan&#x27;s one-man war against the Mafia, beginning with &quot;War Against the Mafia&quot; (1969) and ending with &quot;Satan&#x27;s Sabbath&quot; (1980), after which Pendleton licensed the rights to his &quot;Executioner&quot; characters to the Harlequin publishing group.

In the pulp tradition, Pendleton&#x27;s Mack Bolan, a former United States Army sergeant and Vietnam War veteran, was larger than life, responsible for killing hundreds of mobsters over the course of Pendleton&#x27;s 38 novels. Like many pulp characters, Bolan left a trademark &quot;calling card&quot; — in his case, a marksman&#x27;s medal.

After 15 Executioner novels, Pendleton became involved in a legal battle with the publisher, Pinnacle Books, over ownership of the series. Pinnacle had the next entry, &quot;The Executioner #16: Sicilian Slaughter,&quot; written by William Crawford under the pseudonym &quot;Jim Peterson&quot;. Pendleton ignored &quot;Sicilian Slaughter&quot; and wrote The Executioner #17: &quot;Jersey Guns,&quot; as a sequel to #15, &quot;Panic in Philly,&quot; under a contract with New American Library. The contract was ultimately voided by the terms of his settlement with Pinnacle and he returned to Pinnacle for 21 more novels.

====Spin-offs (1980–present)====
Since 1980, &quot;The Executioner, Mack Bolan&quot; books and spinoffs - Able Team, Phoenix Force, Stony Man, and Mack Bolan - have been written by Harlequin&#x27;s team of writers. The Harlequin Gold Eagle books moved Bolan into a fight against terrorism, in whose course he was given the cover identity of &quot;Colonel John Macklin Phoenix.&quot; Since 1980, Harlequin has produced new novels, and the writer&#x27;s name is mentioned on the copyright page as a provider of &quot;a contribution&quot; to the work, pushing the number of &quot;Mack Bolan&quot; novels into the hundreds; all of them bear the byline, &quot;Don Pendleton&#x27;s Mack Bolan.&quot;

===Joe Copp, Private Eye series (1987–1992) ===
Pendleton&#x27;s other enduring series was the Joe Copp, Private Eye novels, told in the first person by 6&#x27;3&quot;, 260 lb. Joe Copp, a private investigator. The novels were formulaic hardboiled detective fiction, always opening in the middle of the story, with Copp pursuing a variety of criminals, with the story then flashing back to the beginning to describe how Copp got into his current predicament. The Joe Copp series of six hardcover novels often had over-the-top action moments reminiscent to those found of Mickey Spillane&#x27;s Mike Hammer. The books were first published in hardcover by Donald I. Fine and then released in paperback by Harper.

===Ashton Ford, Psychic Detective series (1986–1988)===
The first book of Don Pendleton&#x27;s Ashton Ford, Psychic Detective series, &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, was published in 1986 by Warner Books. The Ashton Ford character is a former naval officer and spy, skilled in cryptology and able to see into the future.

==Adaptations==
Numerous rumors of upcoming film treatments of the Executioner series have circulated over the years. It was announced August 2014 that Shane Salerno, Hollywood producer and screenwriter, had optioned the Executioner novels for a film franchise.

Spider-Man writer Gerry Conway (who went on to become a show runner on Dick Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; series) has acknowledged that his creation of Marvel&#x27;s Punisher character was directly inspired by Pendleton&#x27;s Executioner, in perhaps the most blatantly direct adaptation (or less politely, &quot;lift&quot;) of Pendleton&#x27;s character. Originally conceived as a villain for the Spider-Man comic book series, the character proved incredibly popular and the costumed version of the Executioner that became a comic book hero has taken Pendleton&#x27;s original idea to comic-book-ridiculous extremes in comics, cinema and television, all carefully sidestepping any issues of creative ownership.

<text>The COSMAC VIP (1977) was an early microcomputer that was aimed at video games. Essentially, it was a COSMAC ELF with a supplementary CDP1861/CDP1864 video display chip. For a price of US$275, it could be purchased from RCA by mail order. It came in kit form, and had to be assembled. Its dimensions were 22 × 28 cm, and it had an RCA 1802 processor; along with a crystal clock operating at 1.76 MHz. It had 2 KB (2048 bytes) of RAM, which could be expanded to 4 KB on board, and 32 KB via an expansion slot. Its 5V DC CDP18S023 power supply had an output of 600 mA. I/O ports could be added to connect to sensors, interface relays, an ASCII keyboard, or a printer.

The machine connected to either a video monitor or to a TV with video input or by means of an external RF modulator. The VIP used a CDP1861/CDP1864 video display chip to generate the video output, and sound could be played using its integrated speaker. It had a 100 bytes per second cassette tape interface as well. Programs could be loaded into RAM from tapes, and vice versa. It also had a hex keyboard for input, which had 16 keys spanning the hex digits 0 to F. LED indicators were used to display power status and tape input; a third LED along with an on-board beeper were activated by the CPU&#x27;s 1-bit &quot;Q&quot; register. A run/reset switch was used to start user programs or the operating system, respectively.

A simple 4-kilobit (512-byte) operating system was built into its ROM. It allowed one to type in programs using its hex keyboard, show memory contents on its display (step through the bytes of RAM), and view the values of the processor registers. The ROM monitor was accessed by holding the &quot;C&quot; key while switching from Reset to Run. The COSMAC VIP was shipped with 20 video games, which were programmed in CHIP-8. CHIP-8 was an early interpreted programming language that was used on this machine and other early microcomputers, such as the Telmac 1800. The video games that were provided came as a list of instructions that had to be typed in by the user.

The COSMAC VIP was created by Joseph Weisbecker of the RCA Laboratories in New Jersey. His daughter Joyce created some of the games included with it. RCA sold a $39 version of Tiny BASIC on an expansion board.

A VIP II version was designed, bundling the VIP with several expansion cards and selling it in fully assembled form. Marketing materials from 1979 refer to a 1980 release, but this never occurred. Several years later the VIP II was equipped with a ROM containing a terminal program and sold as a portable terminal device under the name RCA VP 3000.

<text>Phillip Earl Niblock (October 2, 1933 – January 8, 2024) was an American composer, filmmaker, and videographer. In 1985, he was appointed director of Experimental Intermedia, a foundation for avant-garde music based in New York with a parallel branch in Ghent, Belgium.

==Early life and education==
Niblock was born in Anderson, Indiana on October 2, 1933 to Herbert and Thelma Niblock. He attended Indiana University and graduated with a BA in economics in 1956. He served a brief stint in the U.S. Army after graduating, and in 1958, he moved to New York, where he worked as a photographer and filmmaker. Much of this activity centered around photographing and filming jazz musicians and modern dancers. An epiphany occurred while riding a motorcycle in the Appalachian Mountains. Niblock was climbing a grade behind a slow-moving diesel truck when the revolutions of both vehicles&#x27; engines nearly synchronized. &quot;The strong physical presence of the beats resulting from the two engines running at slightly different frequencies put me in such a trance that I nearly rode off the side of the mountain.&quot;

==Career==
Niblock&#x27;s first musical compositions date from 1968. Unusually, even among the avant-garde composers of his generation, he had no formal musical training. He cited the musical activities of New York in the 1960s (and occasional memorable performances, such as the premiere of Morton Feldman&#x27;s &quot;Durations&quot; pieces) as a stimulus. All of his compositions were worked out intuitively rather than systematically. His early works were all done with tape, overdubbing unprocessed recordings of precisely tuned long tones played on traditional instruments in four, eight, or sixteen tracks. Since the late 1990s his music has been created with computer technology, notably with Pro Tools on a Macintosh computer. His later works are correspondingly more dense in texture, sometimes involving as many as forty tracks.

Niblock also made a number of films and videos, including several in a series titled &quot;The Movement of People Working&quot;. The series was filmed primarily in rural environments in many countries and regions of the world (China, Brazil, Portugal, Lesotho, Puerto Rico, Hong Kong, the Arctic, Mexico, Hungary, the Adirondacks, Peru) between 1973 and 1991. The films look at everyday work, frequently agrarian or marine labor, and are notable for their stark realism, consistent use of long takes, limited camera movement, and striking juxtaposition of non-fiction content and vivid colors. These scenes of the movement of human manual labor are treated abstractly without explicit anthropological or sociological commentary. As in his music, Niblock counters the static surface of the work with an active, varied texture of rhythm and form achieved by the bodies in motion within the frame; this is what Niblock considered to be the ultimate subject matter of his films.

Niblock&#x27;s music and performances have been staged at various art institutions, including the Kitchen, the Museum of Modern Art, the World Music Institute at Merkin Hall, and Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts. In early 2013, his diverse artistic career was the subject of a retrospective exhibition entitled &quot;Nothin’ but Working&quot;, curated by Mathieu Copeland and realised in partnership between Circuit (Contemporary Art Centre Lausanne) and Musée de l’Elysée, Lausanne. The retrospective toured in 2015 and 2016 as &quot;Phill Niblock, Working for a Title&quot; to Dům umění, Dům pánů z Kunštátu in Brno, Czech Republic. A catalogue devoted to Niblock’s wide intermedia art, &quot;Phill Niblock, Nothing but working&quot;, written and edited by Mathieu Copeland was published in 2023 by Verlag der buchhandlung Walther und Franz Koenig.

He taught at the College of Staten Island, a CUNY school, from 1971 to 1998.

==Music style==
Niblock&#x27;s music is an exploration of sound textures created by multiple tones in very dense, often atonal tunings (generally microtonal in conception) performed in long durations. The layering of long tones only very slightly distinct in pitch creates a multitude of beats and generates complex overtone patterns and other fascinating psychoacoustic effects. The combination of apparently static surface textures and extremely active harmonic movement generates a highly original music that, while having things in common with early drone-based Minimalism, is utterly distinct in sound and technique. Niblock&#x27;s work continues to influence a generation of musicians, especially younger players from a variety of musical genres.

Niblock&#x27;s compositional process usually begins with recordings of single, absolute tones played by a specific musician, with the breathing and attack and decay edited out; these single tones are then layered, creating a monumental, continuous sound. Collaborations with such musicians were crucial to his composing life, and the range of musicians with whom he worked include David Gibson, in the cello works of the 1970s; Petr Kotik, Susan Stenger, and Eberhard Blum, on &quot;Four Full Flutes&quot;; Rafael Toral, David First, Lee Ranaldo, Thurston Moore, Susan Stenger, and Robert Poss on &quot;Guitar Too, for Four&quot; (G2,44+1x2); Ulrich Krieger, Carol Robinson, Kaspar T. Toeplitz, and Reinhold Friedl, on &quot;Touch Food&quot;; Dave Soldier and the Soldier String Quartet on &quot;Five More String Quartets, Early Winter&quot;; and many others. In the last decade of his life he produced several works for orchestra: &quot;Disseminate&quot;, &quot;Three Orchids&quot; (for three orchestras), &quot;Tow for Tom&quot; (for two orchestras), and &quot;4 Chorch + 1&quot;, the latter a commission for the Ostrava Music Days 2007 for chorus and orchestra with solo baritone (Thomas Buckner). The premieres of all these works were conducted by Petr Kotik.

In performance, live musicians may play, wandering through the audience changing the sound texture through reinforcement of or interference with the existing tunings. Simultaneously, Niblock generally accompanied performances by presenting his films and videos (often those from &quot;The Movement of People Working&quot; series, or computer-driven, black-and-white abstract images floating through time). These performances fell into two types: (1) an installation of several hours&#x27; duration, with the music pieces played consecutively, with a long loop of several hours of work before repetition, and with multiple images that are shown simultaneously; or (2) a performance, with several simultaneous works of music and film, usually lasting between one and three hours. In these performances Niblock generally projected three (or more) film images simultaneously, on large screens three to four meters wide. The films are 16 mm and color. The music was produced from stereo or quad tapes, with four or more speakers in the corners of the space. His later video pieces were played individually or with several simultaneously, using large video monitors.

==Experimental Intermedia Foundation==
In 1968, Niblock became an artist-member of Elaine Summers&#x27; Experimental Media, frequently hosting live music events for the foundation from his Chinatown loft, which were attended by musicians like Arthur Russell, John Cage, and David Behrman. In 1985, Niblock became the director of the Experimental Intermedia Foundation, a position he held until his death in 2024. Niblock received a 1994 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award and a 2014 Foundation for Contemporary Arts John Cage award. He was the producer of music and Intermedia presentations at EI since 1973 (about 1,000 performances) and the curator of EI&#x27;s XI Records label. In 1993, he opened a house with window gallery at Sassekaai 45 in Ghent, Belgium, and, in 1997, the coordinating committee—Phill Niblock, Maria Blondeel, Zjuul Devens, Lieve D&#x27;hondt, and Ludo Engels—founded a Belgian organization, the Experimental Intermedia v.z.w., Ghent. 

Phill Niblock&#x27;s music is available on the XI, Moikai, Mode Records, and Touch labels. A double-sided DVD of films and music, lasting nearly four hours, is available on the Extreme label.

==Death==
Niblock died at hospital in New York City on January 8, 2024, from heart failure.

<doc id="980492" wikidata="Q5157226" url="?curid=980492" title="Compukit UK101">
<text>The Compukit UK101 microcomputer (1979) is a kit clone of the Ohio Scientific Superboard II single-board computer, with a few enhancements for the UK market - notably replacing the 24×24 (add guardband kit to give 32×32) screen display with a more useful 48×16 layout working at UK video frequencies. The video output is black and white with 256 semigraphic characters generated by a two kilobyte ROM. It has no bit-mapped graphics capability. The video is output through a UHF modulator, designed to connect to a TV set.

== History ==
The UK101 design was published in &quot;Practical Electronics&quot;, a popular hobbyists magazine at the time. The August, September, October and November 1979 issues carried the four parts of the article, by Dr. Anthony A Berk. Later issues of the magazine contained information on modifications and additions to the machine, including a series of articles on building an expansion unit.

Kits of parts for building the machine were available from Compukit Ltd. / CompShop Ltd. of 14 Station Road, Barnet, Hertfordshire. It is thought that around 5000 kits were produced.

== Description ==
=== Processor ===
The Compukit UK101 is powered by a 6502 microprocessor CPU running at 1 MHz, and is equipped with up to 8 kilobytes of RAM using 2114 static RAM chips of 1024×4-bit. An additional memory-mapped 1 KB of RAM is used for the video display. It has the 8K Microsoft BASIC interpreter stored in ROM. In addition to Basic, a 6502 machine code monitor (2K bytes) is built into ROM. It allows programming by entering sequences of 6502 opcodes. Later a two-pass assembler was available which allows the use of assembly language.

Although the 6502 has two interrupt input pins (NMI and IRQ), neither is used by the UK101.
=== Display ===
The UK101 has a 16-row, 48-column memory-mapped character semigraphics display, with each character taking up 8x8 pixels with an aspect ratio of about 1:2 (corresponding to an effective resolution of 384x128). All scrolling and character output functions are handled by firmware. In the original ROMs, the output functions were rudimentary and did not include a clear-screen function. CPU access to video memory causes noticeable glitches (known as &quot;snow&quot;) on the screen.

=== Keyboard ===
The keyboard of the UK101 is located on the main PCB, and comprises a matrix of keyswitches. The matrix is interfaced to the CPU via two 8-bit I/O ports, and is polled by firmware in the machine&#x27;s ROMs. One key is a latching type, the shift-lock key. When supplied as a kit, the keyboard was assembled by the purchaser from a bag of switches and keytops.

The keyboard ports are located at address DF00 (hex), or 57088 (decimal). BASIC programs typically poll for real-time keyboard input by using the codice_1 and codice_2 commands at that address. Because the keyboard lacks any way to generate an interrupt, it is not possible to implement a typeahead buffer. The keyboard matrix also lacks any diodes at the intersections of the matrix. This leads to problems when reading certain combinations of keys pressed simultaneously. The matrix was designed to allow only the shift, control and shift-lock keys to be pressed simultaneously with another key. The keyswitches themselves were originally manufactured by Cherry.

=== Program Storage ===
In common with other home computers of the time, software can be saved and loaded on standard cassette tapes. The UK101 uses the Kansas City standard tape format. I/O is managed by a Motorola 6850 ACIA. This allows a full RS-232 port to be implemented, with the addition of a few extra components and minor modifications to existing jumpers on the board.

=== Compared to the Superboard ===
Although very similar to the Ohio Scientific Superboard II, the Compukit UK101 differed from that machine in a few places:

# Video display of the UK101 works at UK frequency and resolution.
# RF output is UHF (channel 36) to suit domestic TVs in the UK.
# Power supply is located on the main PCB and accepts UK 240v AC mains input, via an external 9v AC transformer.
# Display improved to 16 lines of 48 characters per line.
# Memory increased to 8 KB.

However, similarities in the PCB layout make it clear that this machine is a clone. The people involved with the modifications were Chris Cary and Bill Wood.

== Expansion ==
The 40 pin expansion socket opened up the world to the UK101. One could attach a dual floppy disk controller (5.25&quot;) and a memory expansion card (40K max) to allow faster and reliable save/load of programs/data.

A sound card became available, built around the General Instrument AY-3-8910, which together with a Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA) WDC 65C21 chip, gave the UK101 audio abilities.

The UK101 floppy disk interface utilised a PIA to control the floppy disk drive stepper motor and another ACIA to serialise the data written to the disk.
A disk operating system was used to provide file storage capability but this resided in RAM and so reduced the available program space.
Typically single or double sided 40 track floppy drives could be supported.

The power consumption of an expanded UK101 could require up to 5 Amps at 5.0Vdc (25 Watts), so heat dissipation and power supply de-coupling were common challenges. Compare with a modern ARM microcontroller with similar capability at 0.5 Watts.

<text>Paige O&#x27;Hara (born Donna Paige Helmintoller; May 10, 1956) is an American actress, singer, and painter. O&#x27;Hara began her career as a Broadway actress in 1975 when she portrayed Della in &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot;. In 1991, she made her motion picture debut in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, in which she voiced the film&#x27;s heroine, Belle. Following the critical and commercial success of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, O&#x27;Hara reprised her role as Belle in the film&#x27;s three direct-to-video follow-ups, &quot;Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas&quot; (1997), &quot;Belle&#x27;s Magical World&quot; (1998), &quot;Belle&#x27;s Tales of Friendship&quot; (1999), and for cameo appearances in &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot; (2018) and &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot; (2023).

==Early life==
O&#x27;Hara began acting at the age of four, attending acting classes in her home state of Florida. It was not until she was 12 years old that she developed an interest in singing and enrolled in a performing arts high school. O&#x27;Hara cites American actress and singer Judy Garland as one of her idols.

==Career==
===Broadway and stage===
O&#x27;Hara made her first appearance on the Broadway stage as Della in &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot; in 1975. She was later play Ellie May Chipley in the revival of &quot;Showboat&quot; in 1983 starring Donald O&#x27;Connor. She repeated the role for the Houston Grand Opera&#x27;s 1989 production and continued with them when the show was moved to the Cairo Opera House in Egypt. Continuing her legacy as Ellie, she also sang the part on the 1989 Grammy-nominated recording of the musical with Jerry Hadley, Frederica von Stade, and Teresa Stratas, conducted by John McGlinn on the Angel EMI label. Her other American stage credits include the title role in &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; (Broadway and national tour) and Ado Annie in a national tour of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; directed by William Hammerstein. In 1995, she joined the Broadway production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, where she played the role of Fantine.

Internationally, O&#x27;Hara has played the role of Nellie Forbush in &quot;South Pacific&quot; (Australia).

In April 2011, O&#x27;Hara played the role of Judy Garland in &quot;From Gumm to Garland: JUDY, The Musical&quot; at the Tempe Center for the Arts in Tempe, Arizona.

===Transition to film and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;===
A longtime fan of Walt Disney Pictures, O&#x27;Hara auditioned for &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; at the age of 35 after reading about the film in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In Season 2 of &quot;The Legend of Prince Valiant&quot; (which starred her &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; co-star Robby Benson), O&#x27;Hara had a recurring role as Princess Aleta (who was later promoted to queen). Benson&#x27;s character Prince Valiant fell in love with Aleta at first sight.

O&#x27;Hara also starred as Venus in the BBC&#x27;s recorded broadcast of the live presentation of Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot; and in tribute to her Belle character from &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, she portrayed Angela, a character in a fictional soap opera, for Disney&#x27;s 2007 live-action/traditional 2-D animated film &quot;Enchanted&quot;.

For her work as Belle, O&#x27;Hara was honored with a Disney Legend Award on August 19, 2011.

O&#x27;Hara was replaced by Julie Nathanson as the official voice of Belle in 2011, since her voice has aged over time. Despite this, she has reprised the character on two subsequent occasions: the 2018 film &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot; and the 2023 short &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;. She continues to paint Belle for Disney Fine Art and also does promotional appearances for Disney. In 2016, O&#x27;Hara appeared at numerous special screenings of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in honor of the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary. She also appeared as a librarian in the TV special &quot;Beauty and the Beast: A 30th Celebration&quot;.

==Personal life==
In May 1980, O&#x27;Hara married actor Lew Resseguie (May 3, 1932 - June 30, 2019). They met in 1979 while performing in &quot;Fiorello!&quot; at Paper Mill Playhouse. They later divorced.

O&#x27;Hara is married to actor, Michael Piontek. They wed in 1990.

She is Catholic.

<doc id="980505" wikidata="Q647559" url="?curid=980505" title="Goalball">
<text>Goalball is a team sport designed specifically for athletes with a vision impairment. Participants compete in teams of three, and try to throw a ball with bells embedded inside it into the opponents&#x27; goal. The ball is thrown by hand and never kicked. Using ear–hand coordination, originating as a rehabilitation exercise, the sport has no able-bodied equivalent. Sighted athletes are also blindfolded when playing this sport.

Played indoors, usually on a volleyball court, games consist of twelve-minute halves (formerly ten-minute halves) with a three-minute half-time. Where there is a tie, golden goal overtime occurs in the form of two three-minute periods (and a second three-minute half-time). If the tie persists, a paired shootout (&#x27;extra throws&#x27; and &#x27;sudden death extra throws&#x27;) determines the winner. Teams alternate throwing or rolling the ball from one end of the playing area to the other, and players remain in the area of their own goal in both defence and attack. Players must use the sound of the ball to judge its position and movement. Eyeshades allow partially sighted and blind players to compete on an equal footing. Eyepatches may be worn under eyeshades to ensure complete coverage of the eye, and prevent any vision should the eyeshades become dislodged.

The International Blind Sports Federation (), founded in 1981 and responsible for a range of sports for blind and partially sighted people, is the official governing body for the sport.

==History==

Goalball was originally devised in 1946 by Hans Lorenzen, an Austrian, and Sepp Reindle, a German, as a means of assisting the rehabilitation of visually impaired World War II veterans.

Goalball gradually evolved into a competitive game during the 1950s and 1960s. It was eventually nominated as a demonstration sport at the 1972 Summer Paralympics in Heidelberg, West Germany, and became a Paralympic Games sport at the 1976 Summer Paralympics in Toronto. The sport&#x27;s first world championship was held in Austria in 1978.

In 2011, the long-standing IBSA Goalball Subcommittee sought to separate from IBSA and form a new international body, the World Goalball Association. IBSA responded by appointing a new committee.

, there were 81 competing nations, and 270 international referees.

== Essentials ==
=== Court and ball ===
IBSA goalball rules require the field of play to be long by wide. Goals span the width of the pitch. The court is divided into six even sections, . At either end, just in front of the goal, is the team area. Beyond that is each team&#x27;s landing zone. The middle two sections are collectively referred to as the neutral zone.

The lines of the court are made by placing tape over lengths of twine. This makes the line both visual (for officials) and tactile (for players). The team area and landing zone, including the boundary, goal lines and high-ball lines, are always marked in this way. Furthermore, the team area has six hash marks (three at the front, one on either side, and one on the goal line) to assist with player orientation.

The ball weighs and has eight holes and contains several noise bells. The ball&#x27;s diameter is around . A non-official ball of about has also been produced by several companies for use by younger players. At the Paralympic level, the ball has been measured leaving the hand in excess of . Despite this, through training and some padding, there are very few injuries.

=== Officials ===
For competitive games, the following set of officials are on the court:

*referees (2) — Each referee remains along the sideline at one half of the court. One referee is &#x27;table-side&#x27;, the other &#x27;off-table side&#x27;.
*goal judges (4) — Positioned to the side of each goal edge, the goal judge raises their hand to confirm to the referee when a ball crosses the goal line. Goal judges are also crucial to the game&#x27;s speed since they retrieve a ball going off court and drop it at the side hash mark of the team area so play can resume.
*ten-second timers (2) — Keep track of the time between when a defending player contacts the ball and when the ball is thrown, calling &#x27;10 second&#x27; penalties when applicable. The role was expanded in the 2018 rule changes to include watching for eyeshade and illegal coaching penalties.
*scorer — This technical official keeps track of the number of time-outs and substitutions taken by a team and, as the term suggests, keeps score.
*game timer and back-up timer — Usually, as with a basketball scoreboard, the period&#x27;s time counts down to zero. It is stopped and started by the referee&#x27;s whistle. A back-up timer is used in case of power failure to the venue.

===Players===

Each team has three players on the court at a time, with one to three substitute players on the bench.

At an international level, including the Paralympic Games, the competition is divided into two categories, male and female. At other levels, this is a matter for the local organising committees. For example, in the United Kingdom, at the three levels of competition (novice – regional, intermediate – regional (north and south), and elite – national level), teams may be mixed sex.

There are three standard positions to play: centre, right wing and left wing. While there is typically no official designation, players often have a position they are best at or prefer, though some players will play any of the three and players are free to change position during a match with no prior announcement (and may do so for tactical reasons).

The centre player is the player most responsible for defence. The player typically lines up at the centre orientation mark at the front of the orientation area (the line forward of the goal post), further forward than the wings which helps to avoid collisions between players diving towards the direction of the ball. Other defensive arrangements are possible, but less common. The centre player is the most defensive position simply because the player is able to move both to the left and right to defend, covering a greater proportion of possible attacking shot lines. The centre player may also be the defensive coordinator.

The left and right wingers generally line up at the end of the orientation marks from the respective sidelines, at the orientation mark. Their main defensive responsibilities are keeping the ball out of either corner of the goal, though they also defend towards the centre. Typically, the wingers are the main offence because there are some advantages to the angles of shots possible from their positions. This also allows the centre player to reserve their energy for defence, though the centre player may also have an offensive role.

=== Scoring ===

A goal scores one point, and is scored when the ball completely crosses the goal line. The team with the higher score at the end of regulation time is the winner. If regulation results in a tie, two three-minute overtime periods are played, for a golden goal (first goal concludes the game). If no goal is scored during overtime, penalty throws and sudden death penalty throws are taken. Should a goal difference of ten be reached, a mercy is called and the leading team is declared the winner.

== Game play and etiquette ==

The game relies heavily on the sense of hearing instead of sight, so all outside noise, including cheering, clapping, chanting or ringtones from cellphones, is prohibited. The crowd is therefore repeatedly reminded to remain silent, and referees preface their call &quot;Play!&quot; with &quot;Quiet, please!&quot;. Coaches cannot speak whilst the ball is in play, and so cannot influence the game.

Players, regardless of the degree of vision, wear blackened-out eyeshades which allow no light in, to ensure fairness. Fully-sighted individuals may play the sport while wearing eyeshades.

=== Beginning of play ===

The team winning the coin toss usually starts with the ball.

=== Offence ===

To score, a player must roll or bounce the ball down the length of the court, past the opposing defenders, and into the opponents&#x27; goal. Typically, the player with the ball will stand, orient themselves using the tactile lines, sounds from teammates, and/or the crossbar of their own goal. The player will then stride forward, lean low, and roll or side arm the ball down the court.

The ball must hit in the player&#x27;s own landing zone, and anywhere in the neutral zone. So long as it hits each zone, the style of throw is entirely up to the player in question. Many players will take several strides and release the ball as close to their own high ball line as possible, leaning low to ensure a legal throw. Some players will throw after spinning, transferring the momentum of the spin into additional velocity. Others are able to throw the ball so that it will bounce just once in each of the required zones. Most elite players are effective when using multiple types of throws.

=== Defence ===

The defending players stay within the team area, generally in somewhat staggered positions to avoid collisions. When they hear the other team throw the ball, they &#x27;lay out&#x27;, that is slide on their hips and stretch their arms above their heads and extend their legs in order to cover as much distance as possible. The objective is simply to keep the ball from getting past with whatever part of the body the player can get in front of it.

Some players prefer to block the ball with their chests and absorb the impact. Others like to block with their legs so the ball will roll up their bodies into their hands. Regardless of method, the players will always try to make themselves as long as possible to block the greatest area.

==Rules==

===Infractions===

Infractions are generally punished by the loss of possession to the other team.

* Premature throw – Throwing the ball before the official has called &#x27;play&#x27;.
* Ball over – The ball rebounds off a defending player, the crossbar or goalposts, and crosses back over half-court.

===Penalties===

A penalty throw may be awarded for:

*Ten second penalty – A team takes more than ten seconds to throw the ball back over the centre line.
*Delay of game – This can be caused by many different things. A coach reporting the wrong numbers for substitutions, a team not arriving in time for the coin toss that precedes the game, or too many or too few players taking the court.
*Illegal defence – This is called if a defender makes contact with the ball while no part of the body is touching the team area.
*Short ball – The ball fails to reach the opponent&#x27;s team area when thrown. 
*High ball – The ball does not touch the thrower&#x27;s landing zone when thrown. 
*Long ball – The ball does not touch the neutral zone when thrown.
*Eyeshades – Touching eyeshades without permission.
*Unsporting conduct – This can be a variety of things, from arguing with an official to pounding the floor and swearing
*Noise – Unnecessary noise by the offensive team that prevents the defence from tracking the ball while the ball is travelling down the court.
*Illegal coaching – Coaching from the bench during play or after an official has said &#x27;Quiet please&#x27; with intentions of continuing or starting play. From 2006, rules allowed coaching from the bench during an official time-out.

In a penalty situation, a single player is required to defend the entire goal for one throw. The player chosen is determined by the penalty. For instance, a high ball or illegal defence penalty is defended by the player who committed the penalty. On the other hand, an illegal coaching penalty is defended by a player chosen by the coach of the throwing team (previously the last recorded thrower of that team).

==Official rules==

The official rules for the sport are provided on the IBSA website. Rules may be adjusted every four years.

Referees may be internationally certified under a structured scheme, from IBSA Goalball Level 1 to Level 3. Goalball world championships and Paralympic tournaments are called by Level 3 referees. Participating countries may also have a national referee scheme.

Changes over time have seen regulation period halves increase from seven, to ten, to the present twelve minutes. Team staff were limited to when coaching could occur, but now it is after any whistled stoppage in play. Rules such as step-over and third-time throw have been removed. The ball must be thrown back towards the opposition goals within ten seconds from contact. In 2014, this was extended to reaching the centre line to ensure a quicker delivery. Eye patching was introduced under the eye shades to reduce cheating.

==Competitions and events==
Goalball is a sport played at the Paralympic Games. During the Games, male and female teams are eligible to compete following various selection requirements. The number of participating teams has changed over the decades, but for the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, this was reduced from ten to eight teams per division by the International Paralympic Committee. Competition is open to sighted persons to national level, but for international IBSA-sanctioned tournaments, athletes must have a visual impairment classification of B1, B2, or B3.

The IBSA World Goalball Championships has been held every four years, since 1978. A youth world championships was introduced, and the Fifth IBSA Goalball World Youth Championships were run in Budaors, Hungary, in July 2017, the first outside of the U.S. state of Colorado.

Diving as part of defensive skills has been used as a training activity for (sighted) sports teams. Professional teams trying goalball have included the Boston Bruins ice hockey, Queensland Fire cricket, and Seattle Sounders FC association football teams.

== In popular culture ==

In 2006, the animated series &quot;Bernard&quot; produced a three-minute clip, featuring Eva the penguin introducing the titular polar bear to goalball.

In 2018 and 2024, the sport was featured in the anime &quot;Ani x Para: Anata no Hero wa Dare desu ka&quot;, in the fourth and eighteenth episodes. In both episodes, the characters of another anime played a match of goalball: in the fourth, and &quot;Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun&quot; in the eighteenth. 

Goalball was featured in episodes 10–12 of the 2020 Japanese anime, &quot;Breakers&quot;, where Paralympic sports are featured, originally planned to promote the 2020 Summer Paralympics.

<text>In the mathematical field of graph theory, a cubic graph is a graph in which all vertices have degree three. In other words, a cubic graph is a 3-regular graph. Cubic graphs are also called trivalent graphs.

A bicubic graph is a cubic bipartite graph.

==Symmetry==
In 1932, Ronald M. Foster began collecting examples of cubic symmetric graphs, forming the start of the Foster census. Many well-known individual graphs are cubic and symmetric, including the utility graph, the Petersen graph, the Heawood graph, the Möbius–Kantor graph, the Pappus graph, the Desargues graph, the Nauru graph, the Coxeter graph, the Tutte–Coxeter graph, the Dyck graph, the Foster graph and the Biggs–Smith graph.

Tutte classified the symmetric cubic graphs by the smallest integer number &quot;s&quot; such that each two oriented paths of length &quot;s&quot; can be mapped to each other by exactly one symmetry of the graph. He showed that &quot;s&quot; is at most 5, and provided examples of graphs with each possible value of &quot;s&quot; from 1 to 5.

Semi-symmetric cubic graphs include the Gray graph (the smallest semi-symmetric cubic graph), the Ljubljana graph, and the Tutte 12-cage.

The Frucht graph is one of the five smallest cubic graphs without any symmetries: it possesses only a single graph automorphism, the identity automorphism.

==Coloring and independent sets==
According to Brooks&#x27; theorem every connected cubic graph other than the complete graph &quot;K&quot;4 has a vertex coloring with at most three colors. Therefore, every connected cubic graph other than &quot;K&quot;4 has an independent set of at least &quot;n&quot;/3 vertices, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of vertices in the graph: for instance, the largest color class in a 3-coloring has at least this many vertices.

According to Vizing&#x27;s theorem every cubic graph needs either three or four colors for an edge coloring. A 3-edge-coloring is known as a Tait coloring, and forms a partition of the edges of the graph into three perfect matchings. By Kőnig&#x27;s line coloring theorem every bicubic graph has a Tait coloring.

The bridgeless cubic graphs that do not have a Tait coloring are known as snarks. They include the Petersen graph, Tietze&#x27;s graph, the Blanuša snarks, the flower snark, the double-star snark, the Szekeres snark and the Watkins snark. There is an infinite number of distinct snarks.

==Topology and geometry==
Cubic graphs arise naturally in topology in several ways. For example, the cubic graphs with &quot;2g-2&quot; vertices describe the different ways of cutting a surface of genus &quot;g ≥ 2&quot; into pairs of pants. If one considers a graph to be a 1-dimensional CW complex, cubic graphs are &quot;generic&quot; in that most 1-cell attaching maps are disjoint from the 0-skeleton of the graph. Cubic graphs are also formed as the graphs of simple polyhedra in three dimensions, polyhedra such as the regular dodecahedron with the property that three faces meet at every vertex.
An arbitrary graph embedding on a two-dimensional surface may be represented as a cubic graph structure known as a graph-encoded map. In this structure, each vertex of a cubic graph represents a flag of the embedding, a mutually incident triple of a vertex, edge, and face of the surface. The three neighbors of each flag are the three flags that may be obtained from it by changing one of the members of this mutually incident triple and leaving the other two members unchanged.

==Hamiltonicity==
There has been much research on Hamiltonicity of cubic graphs. In 1880, P.G. Tait conjectured that every cubic polyhedral graph has a Hamiltonian circuit. William Thomas Tutte provided a counter-example to Tait&#x27;s conjecture, the 46-vertex Tutte graph, in 1946. In 1971, Tutte conjectured that all bicubic graphs are Hamiltonian. However, Joseph Horton provided a counterexample on 96 vertices, the Horton graph. Later, Mark Ellingham constructed two more counterexamples: the Ellingham–Horton graphs. Barnette&#x27;s conjecture, a still-open combination of Tait&#x27;s and Tutte&#x27;s conjecture, states that every bicubic polyhedral graph is Hamiltonian. When a cubic graph is Hamiltonian, LCF notation allows it to be represented concisely.

If a cubic graph is chosen uniformly at random among all &quot;n&quot;-vertex cubic graphs, then it is very likely to be Hamiltonian: the proportion of the &quot;n&quot;-vertex cubic graphs that are Hamiltonian tends to one in the limit as &quot;n&quot; goes to infinity.

David Eppstein conjectured that every &quot;n&quot;-vertex cubic graph has at most 2&quot;n&quot;/3 (approximately 1.260&quot;n&quot;) distinct Hamiltonian cycles, and provided examples of cubic graphs with that many cycles. The best proven estimate for the number of distinct Hamiltonian cycles is formula_1.

==Other properties==

The pathwidth of any &quot;n&quot;-vertex cubic graph is at most &quot;n&quot;/6. The best known lower bound on the pathwidth of cubic graphs is 0.082&quot;n&quot;. It is not known how to reduce this gap between this lower bound and the &quot;n&quot;/6 upper bound.

It follows from the handshaking lemma, proven by Leonhard Euler in 1736 as part of the first paper on graph theory, that every cubic graph has an even number of vertices.

Petersen&#x27;s theorem states that every cubic bridgeless graph has a perfect matching.
Lovász and Plummer conjectured that every cubic bridgeless graph has an exponential number of perfect matchings. The conjecture was recently proved, showing that every cubic bridgeless graph with &quot;n&quot; vertices has at least 2n/3656 perfect matchings.

==Algorithms and complexity==
Several researchers have studied the complexity of exponential time algorithms restricted to cubic graphs. For instance, by applying dynamic programming to a path decomposition of the graph, Fomin and Høie showed how to find their maximum independent sets in time 2&quot;n&quot;/6 + o(&quot;n&quot;). The travelling salesman problem in cubic graphs can be solved in time O(1.2312&quot;n&quot;) and polynomial space.

Several important graph optimization problems are APX hard, meaning that, although they have approximation algorithms whose approximation ratio is bounded by a constant, they do not have polynomial time approximation schemes whose approximation ratio tends to 1 unless P=NP. These include the problems of finding a minimum vertex cover, maximum independent set, minimum dominating set, and maximum cut.
The crossing number (the minimum number of edges which cross in any graph drawing) of a cubic graph is also NP-hard for cubic graphs but may be approximated.
The Travelling Salesman Problem on cubic graphs has been proven to be NP-hard to approximate to within any factor less than 1153/1152.

<doc id="980517" wikidata="Q2302403" url="?curid=980517" title="Tag Team Wrestling">
<text>Tag Team Wrestling, known as in Japan, is a wrestling arcade video game developed by Technōs Japan and released in 1983. The arcade version was published by Data East both in Japan and North America, but only the North American version mentions the name Data East in-game. It was ported to the Apple II, Commodore 64, IBM PC, and the Famicom/NES.

==Gameplay==
In the original game, the player controls a professional wrestling tag-team, two identical wrestlers with black hair, orange trunks and brown boots named Sunny and Terry (Jocko and Spike in the U.S. version) who must defeat a couple of masked wrestlers known as the Heel Team (Mad Maulers in the U.S. version): one of them a skinny wrestler with an orange mask and boots and white trunks, the other a fat wrestler in a black mask and tights with white boots. The player&#x27;s team must continually beat the Heel Team in order to win trophies and maintain gameplay. After the tenth match, the player&#x27;s team is designated the world champions and must keep playing in order to maintain their title. In the event of the Heel Team winning or tying a match, the game is over.

The player is provided with a joystick and two buttons: a &quot;select&quot; button and an &quot;action/pin&quot; button. The player uses the joystick to move Sunny or Terry around the ring, where they must make contact with the member of the Heel Team (in the first match, the skinny wrestler from the Heel Team starts, then the fat one in the second, and it continues that way from there on in, as does with the player&#x27;s wrestlers). Upon making contact with the opposing wrestler, the two wrestlers will immediately grapple. The player then releases the opposing wrestler by pulling away, then grappling again, waiting for the &quot;Action&quot; command to flash onscreen. Due to being one of the earliest professional wrestling video games, Tag Team Wrestling has a limited number of wrestling moves and characters. Moves and counters are performed through the use of a real-time, menu-based action-reaction fighting module. After engaging in a grapple with the &quot;Action&quot; command flashing, players quickly scroll through a menu and choose a maneuver to perform.

This means that the player has an advantage over the opponent, and must utilize the &quot;select&quot; button to go over the list of wrestling moves provided, and then the &quot;action&quot; button to choose the desired move. The player has 3 seconds to choose the desired move, or else the opposing wrestler will gain an advantage over the player&#x27;s wrestler and execute their own move. If the Heel Team wrestler in the ring has not been grappled with in a while, they will enter their &quot;red&quot; mode: The wrestler will turn all red and, moving at twice the normal speed, attack the player&#x27;s wrestler in the ring with an immediate advantage. In this situation, the player can only tag out with the &quot;Action&quot; button (if the wrestler is weakened and the tagged-in wrestler is strong enough to withstand the attack) or keep away from the Heel Team wrestler until their &quot;red&quot; phase runs out.

The wrestling moves the player may execute (when the &quot;Action&quot; command flashes) consist of:

Nutter - a headlock (200* - 300 points)

Straight Jab, Karate Chop (300* points)

Kick (200* - 300 points)

Rabbit Killer - jumping kick to the back of the opponent&#x27;s head (800 - 900* points)

Body Slam (500 - 700* points)

Drop Kick (500 - 700* points)

Pile-driver* (600 points)

Brain Buster* (800 points)

W. Lariat* (1,000 points)

Rear Drop* - German suplex (600 points) - if executed when the opponent (the skinny Heel Team wrestler) is considerably weakened, it will count as a pin

Cobra Twist* - also known as the &quot;Abdominal Stretch&quot;, a submission move: if executed on the skinny Heel Team wrestler after he has lost most of his energy, the wrestler will submit (the words &quot;Give Up!&quot; will flash on screen) and the player will win the match. If executed while the skinny wrestler is too strong, the fat Heel Team wrestler will interfere, running into the ring and pounding the player&#x27;s wrestler until he releases his opponent. This is the only case in which one wrestler will interfere for another.

All of these wrestling moves can be executed on the skinny Heel Team wrestler. The ones marked with an asterisk (*) cannot be used against the fat Heel Team wrestler. If the player attempts any of these moves on him, the fat wrestler will simply counter it and nail the player&#x27;s wrestler with his own move.

Once a wrestler is considerably weakened (usually via 3 or more major wrestling moves), they will try to tag out with their tag team partner, who will enter the ring at full strength. While being tagged-out, the wrestler will slowly begin recharging his energy. If a weakened wrestler isn&#x27;t able to tag out in time and has lost too much energy, they will fall over, leaving them vulnerable to a pin (executable by the &quot;Action/Pin&quot; button). If a wrestler still has strength left, they will throw the pinning opponent off them, the player executing this move by shaking the joystick and hitting the &quot;Action&quot; button.

If a wrestler executes a move on another wrestler too close to the ring ropes, they may end up knocking their opponent, or themselves, out of the ring entirely. In this situation, the on-screen scene will change from an upper-view of the ring to a side-view. The wrestler who has been knocked out has a count of 20 to re-enter the ring to avoid being counted out. Often, in the situation where the player&#x27;s wrestler has been knocked out of the ring, the opposing wrestler will follow them in order to execute one of the 4 moves allotted in the given situation. The first three moves are similar to The Straight Jab and The Karate Chop, the fourth, The Corner Bar, causes the wrestler executing the move to bash his opponent&#x27;s head into the ring post. As inside the ring, the execution of these moves depend upon the &quot;Action&quot; command flashing to determine who has the advantage. The purpose of these moves is to hopefully keep the wrestler from re-entering the ring in time and be counted out. The instant a player&#x27;s wrestler re-enters the ring, the on-screen scene immediately cuts back to the original one.

In some situations where the player&#x27;s wrestler is knocked out of the ring, a spectator, an odd man in a turban sporting a goatee will come running out of the cheering crowd, attack the player&#x27;s wrestler with some hard blows to the head, then storm off, thus making it take longer for the player&#x27;s wrestler to re-enter the ring. This person is most likely the Heel Team&#x27;s manager, especially since the fat Heel Team&#x27;s wrestler waves at the man whenever this occurs, although this has never been confirmed. The player&#x27;s wrestler(s) have no defense against this character, except to hopefully re-enter the ring before the man reaches them.

Points are scored by the type of moves executed against one&#x27;s opponent, as indicated above. Point scores with an asterisk (*) indicate the number of points scored if move is executed against the fat Heel Team wrestler. In addition, the player earns points by the amount of time it takes to end the match. For example, a match lasting only 30 – 40 seconds will give the player a bonus of 8,000 points, where a 40 - 50 second match will be worth 6,000 points, 50 second - a minute long match will be 5,000 points, and so forth. Sunny and Terry each earn their own individual scores for their time in the ring; these points are added together for the player&#x27;s full score.

In the NES version, two professional wrestling tag-teams, the Strong Bads and the Ricky Fighters, battle against each other in tag-team action, or a single player competes in a series of tournaments to win ever larger trophies. Each of the four characters has a unique move that can only be used against one other rival wrestler.

== Reception ==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Tag Team Wrestling&quot; on their January 15, 1984 issue as being the top-grossing new table arcade cabinet of the month. It later topped Japan&#x27;s table arcade game charts in February 1984.

==Ports and related releases==
In 1984, the arcade game was ported to the Apple II, Commodore 64 and IBM PC in the United States by Quicksilver Software and published by Data East. U.S. Gold released Quicksilver&#x27;s ports in Europe for the IBM PC in 1986 and the Commodore 64 in 1987.

Arguably, the most well known port is the Family Computer/Nintendo Entertainment System version created in 1986. The development of this port was a joint venture between Data East (for graphics &amp; sound) and Sakata SAS (for programming). It was published in Japan by Namco as on April 2, 1986. In North America, this version was released on October the same year by Data East for the NES, keeping the &quot;Tag Team Wrestling&quot; title. This was Data East&#x27;s first title for the NES and one of the earliest third-party video games for the console in North America.

<doc id="980538" wikidata="Q2733487" url="?curid=980538" title="Ali al-Hujwiri">
<text>Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Uthman al-Jullabi al-Hujwiri (; -1072/77), known reverentially as Data Sahib (), was an Islamic scholar and mystic who authored , the earliest treatise on Sufism in the Persian language. Born in the Ghaznavid Empire, al-Hujwiri is believed to have contributed &quot;significantly&quot; to the spread of Islam in South Asia through his preaching.

Al-Hujwiri is venerated as the primary saint of Lahore, Pakistan by the Sufis of the area and his tomb-shrine, known as the Data Darbar, is one of the most frequented shrines in South Asia. Currently, it is Pakistan&#x27;s largest shrine &quot;in numbers of annual visitors and in the size of the shrine complex,&quot; and, having been nationalized in 1960, is managed today by the Department of Awqaf and Religious Affairs of the Punjab. The mystic himself remains a &quot;household name&quot; in the daily Islam of South Asia. In 2016, the Government of Pakistan declared 21 November to be a public holiday for the commemoration of the commencement of Ali Hujwiri&#x27;s three-day death anniversary.

==Background==
He migrated to Punjab from Afghanistan and brought the light of Islam to a land where majority of the people were Hindus. Ali Hujwiri was born in Ghazni, in present-day Afghanistan, in around 1009 to Uthman ibn Ali or Bu Ali. As is common with Sufi saints, his father was a direct descendant of Al-Imam Hasan ibn Ali. His genealogical chain supposedly goes back eight generations to Caliph Ali.
According to the autobiographical information recorded in his own &quot;Kashf al-maḥjūb&quot;, it is evident that Ali Hujwiri travelled &quot;widely through the Ghaznavid Empire and beyond, spending considerable time in Baghdad, Nishapur, and Damascus, where he met many of the pre-eminent Ṣūfīs of his time.&quot; In matters of jurisprudence, he received training in the Hanafi rite of orthodox Sunni law under various teachers. As for his Sufic training, he was linked through his teacher al-Khuttalī to al-Husrī, Abu Bakr al-Shibli (), and Junayd al-Baghdadi (). For a short period, the mystic is believed to have lived in Iraq His brief marriage during this period is said to have been unhappy. Eventually, Ali Hujwiri settled in Lahore, where he died with the reputation of a renowned preacher and teacher. After his death, Ali Hujwiri was unanimously regarded as a great saint by popular acclaim.

==Views==
===Companions of Muhammad===
====Abu Bakr====
Ali Hujwiri described the first caliph of Islam Abu Bakr () as &quot;the Greatest Truthful,&quot; and deemed him &quot;the leader (&quot;imām&quot;) of all the folk of this Path.&quot; Eulogizing Abu Bakr&#x27;s piety, Ali Hujwiri praised him for how &quot;he gave away all his wealth and his clients, and clad himself in a woolen garment, and came to the Messenger Muhammad &quot; and stated elsewhere that he &quot;is placed by the Sufi shaykhs at the head of those who have adopted the contemplative life.&quot; In conclusion, Ali Hujwiri stated: &quot;The whole sect of Sufis has made him their patron in stripping themselvesan of worldly things, in fixity, in an eager desire for poverty, and in longing to renounce authority. He is the leader of the Muslims in general, and of the Sufis in particular.&quot;

====Umar====
Al-Hujwiri described the second caliph of Islam Umar () as one &quot;specially distinguished by sagacity and resolution,&quot; and said that &quot;the Sufis make him their model in wearing a patched garment and rigorously performing the duties of religion.&quot; He further praised Umar for his &quot;very exalted station&quot; in combining a life of worldly duties with intense and consistent spiritual devotion.

====Uthman====
Regarding the third of the Rightly Guided Caliphs of the early Islamic community, Uthman (), al-Hujwiri stated that the &quot;Sufis take Uthman as their exemplar in sacrificing life and property, in resigning their affairs to God, and in sincere devotion.&quot;

====Ali====
With respect to the fourth of the Rightly Guided Caliphs of Islam, Ali (), al-Hujwiri stated: &quot;His renown and rank in this Path were very high. He explained the principles of Divine Truth with exceeding subtlety... Ali is a model for the Sufis in respect to the truths of outward expressions and the subtleties of inward meanings, the stripping of one&#x27;s self of all property either of this world or of the next, and consideration of the Divine Providence.&quot; He also approvingly cited Junayd of Baghdad&#x27;s saying: &quot;Ali is our Shaykh as regards the principles and as regards the endurance of affliction.&quot;

=== Family of Muḥammad (صلی اللہ علیہ و سلم) ===

====Hasan====
Regarding the grandson of Muhammad and son of Ali, Hasan ibn Ali (d. 670), Ali Hujwiri described him as one &quot;profoundly versed in [spiritual truths]&quot; and as one of &quot;the true saints and shaykhs&quot; of the Islamic community.

====Husayn====
With respect to the younger grandson of Muhammad and son of Ali, Husayn ibn Ali (d. 680), Ali Hujwiri emphatically declared: &quot;He is the martyr of Karbala and all Sufis are agreed that he was in the right. So long as the Truth was apparent, he followed it; but when it was lost, he drew the sword and never rested until he sacrificed his dear life for God&#x27;s sake.&quot;

====Jafar al-Sadiq====
Ali Hujwiri described Jafar al-Sadiq (d. 765), the great-grandson of Husayn, as one &quot;celebrated among the Sufi shaykhs for the subtlety of discourse and his acquaintance with spiritual truths.&quot;

====Muhammad al-Baqir====
Regarding the grandson of Husayn, Muhammad al-Baqir (d. 733), Ali Hujwiri stated: &quot;He was distinguished for his knowledge of the abstruse science and for his subtle indications as to the meaning of the Quran.&quot;

====Zayn al-Abidin====
Ali Hujwiri praised Zayn al-Abidin (d. 713), the son of Husayn, for being of &quot;the character of those who have attained perfect rectitude.&quot;

===Doctors of law===
====Abu Hanifa====
Regarding Abu Hanifa (d. 767), the traditionally recognized founder of the Hanafi school of orthodox Sunni jurisprudence, Ali Hujwiri stated: &quot;He is the Imām of Imāms (lit. &#x27;Leader of Leaders&#x27;) and the exemplar of the Sunnis.&quot;

====Ahmad ibn Hanbal====
Regarding Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855), the traditionally recognized founder of the Hanbali school of orthodox Sunni jurisprudence, Ali Hujwiri stated: &quot;He was distinguished by devoutness and piety, and was the guardian of the Traditions of the Messenger. Sufis of all sects regard him as blessed. He associated with great shaykhs ... his miracles were manifest and his intelligence sound. The doctrines attributed to him today by certain anthropomorphists are inventions and forgeries; he is to be acquitted of all notions of that sort. He had a firm belief in the principles of religion, and his creed was approved by all the theologians... He is clear of all [the slander] that is alleged against him.&quot;

===Law and jurisprudence===
As a Sunni Muslim, Ali Hujwiri believed it was a spiritual necessity to follow one of the orthodox schools of religious law, being himself a staunch follower of the Hanafi school of orthodox Sunni jurisprudence. As such, Ali Hujwiri condemned as &quot;heretics&quot; all those who espoused mystical doctrines without following all the precepts of the religious law (&quot;sharīʿah&quot;). He further denounced all those &quot;who held that ... when the Truth is revealed the Law is abolished&quot;. For Ali Hujwiri, then, all true and orthodox mystical activities needed to take place within the boundaries of the religious law.

===Dancing===
According to Ali Hujwiri, purely secular dancing &quot;has no foundation either in the religious law of Islam or in the path of Sufism, because all reasonable men agree that it is a diversion when it is in earnest, and an impropriety when it is in jest&quot;. As such, he censured &quot;all the traditions cited in its favour&quot; as &quot;worthless&quot;. As for the legitimate ecstatic experiences of some Sufis, whose bodies convulsed when their &quot;heart [throbbed] with exhilaration and rapture&quot; on account of their intense love of God, Ali Hujwiri declared that these movements only outwardly resembled dancing and opined that &quot;those who call it &#x27;dancing&#x27; are utterly wrong. It is a state that cannot be explained in words: &#x27;without experience no knowledge&#x27;.&quot;

===Poetry===
Ali Hujwiri deemed it lawful to listen to virtuous poetry, saying: &quot;It is permissible to hear poetry. The Messenger heard it, and the Companions not only heard it but also spoke it.&quot; Due to these reasons, he censured those who &quot;declare that it is unlawful to listen to any poetry whatever, and pass their lives in defaming their brother Muslims.&quot; Regarding the hearing of secular poetry, however, Ali Hujwiri&#x27;s opinion was far stricter, and he deemed it &quot;unlawful&quot; to hear poetry or love-songs that enticed the hearer to carnal desires through detailed descriptions &quot;of the face and hair and mole of the beloved.&quot; In conclusion, he stated that those who regarded the hearing of such poetry &quot;as absolutely lawful must also regard looking and touching as lawful, which is infidelity and heresy.&quot;

===Saints===
Ali Hujwiri supported the orthodox belief in the existence of saints. As such, he stated: &quot;You must know that the principle and foundation of Sufism and Knowledge of God rests on sainthood, the reality of which is unanimously affirmed by all the teachers, though every one has expressed himself in a different language.&quot; Elsewhere, he said: &quot;God has saints whom He has specially distinguished by His Friendship and whom He has chosen to be the governors of His Kingdom and has marked out to manifest by His Actions and has peculiarly favored with diverse kinds of miracles and has purged of natural corruptions and has delivered from subjection to their lower soul and passion, so that all their thoughts are of Him and their intimacy is with Him alone. Such have been in past ages, and are now, and shall be hereafter until the Day of Resurrection, because God exalted this community above all others and has promised to preserve the religion of Muhammad... The visible proof [of Islam] is to be found among the saints and the elect of God.&quot;

==Works==
===&quot;Kashf al-maḥjūb&quot;===

Ali Hujwiri is perhaps most famous for writing what has been described as &quot;the earliest formal treatise on Ṣūfism in Persian,&quot; the &quot;Kashf al-maḥjūb&quot; (&quot;Unveiling of the Hidden&quot;). The work presents itself as an introduction to the various aspects of orthodox Sufism and also provides biographies of the greatest saints of the Islamic community. The &quot;Kashf al-maḥjūb&quot; is the only work of Ali Hujwiri that has remained until today. Egyptian Sufi scholar Abul Azaem has translated this work into Arabic.

===Other works===
Reynold Alleyne Nicholson provided a short list of Ali Hujwiri&#x27;s writings (all of which are lost aside from the &quot;Kashf al-maḥjūb&quot;), which included, amongst others, the following unpreserved works: 
# &quot;Dīwān&quot; (&quot;Songs of Hujwirī&quot;), a collection of the saint&#x27;s poems.
# &quot;Minhāj al-Dīn&quot; (&quot;The Way of the Religion&quot;), a work containing: (i) a detailed account of those companions of Muhammad whom Ali Hujwiri deemed the precursors of the Sufis; and (ii) a full biography of the executed 10th-century mystic Mansur al-Hallaj (d. 922).
# &quot;Asrār al-khiraq wa &#x27;l-ma&#x27;ūnāt&quot;&#x27;, a work on the woolen, patched garments worn by the Sufis of his time.
# An untitled work explaining the meaning behind the mystical sayings of Mansur al-Hallaj.
# &quot;Kitāb al-bayān li-ahl al-&#x27;iyān&quot;, a treatise on the orthodox interpretation of the Sufic ideal of Fana.

Of other books written by Sheikh Ali Hujwiri:
# &quot;Kashf al-Asrār&quot;, a short Persian treatise on how to fully adopt the path of Tasawwuf, translated with in-depth commentary by El-Sheikh Syed Mubarik Ali Shah El-Gillani.

== Assessment and legacy ==
Mu&#x27;in al-Din Chishti stayed at al-Hujwiri&#x27;s mausoleum and quoted a tribute to him as a narration; &quot;Ganj Bakhsh-e-Faiz-e-Alam Mazhar-e-Nur-e-Khuda, Na Qasaan-ra Pir-i Kamil, Kamilaan-ra Rahnuma.&quot; Al-Hujwiri is believed to have contributed &quot;significantly&quot; to the spread of Islam in South Asia through his preaching, with one historian describing him as &quot;one of the most important figures to have spread Islam in the Indian subcontinent.&quot;

In the present day, al-Hujwiri is venerated as the main saint of Lahore, Pakistan by the traditional Sunni Muslims of the area. He is, moreover, one of the most widely venerated saints in the entire South Asia, and his tomb-shrine in Lahore, popularly known as Data Darbar, is one of the most frequented shrines in South Asia. At present, it is Pakistan&#x27;s largest shrine &quot;in numbers of annual visitors and in the size of the shrine complex,&quot; and, having been nationalized in 1960, is managed today by the Department of Awqaf and Religious Affairs of the Punjab. The mystic himself remains a &quot;household name&quot; in the daily Islam of South Asia. In 2016, the Government of Pakistan declared 21 November to be a public holiday for the commemoration of the commencement of al-Hujwiri&#x27;s three-day death anniversary.

<doc id="980539" wikidata="Q6192239" url="?curid=980539" title="Jif (peanut butter)">
<text>Jif (sometimes printed as JIF) is an American brand of peanut butter made by The J.M. Smucker Company, which purchased the brand from Procter &amp; Gamble in 2001.

In 1955, Procter &amp; Gamble bought Big Top peanut butter and its manufacturing facilities in Lexington, Kentucky from William T. Young. In the ensuing years, the company reformulated and rebranded it to compete with Skippy and Peter Pan. P&amp;G named its product Jif, used oils other than peanut oil in its hydrogenation process, and sweetened the recipe, adding sugar and molasses. The new product was publicly announced in April 1956, as tests of the product began in select markets. In 1981, Jif became the largest peanut butter brand in the United States, a position it held at least through 2008.

== Advertising ==
In 1958, the brand rollout in the U.S. involved a heavily publicized house-to-house distribution of free sample jars from special trucks emblazoned with the then Jif mascot, the &quot;Jifaroo&quot;, a blue kangaroo. An early slogan was &quot;Jif is never dry; a touch of honey tells you why.&quot; Early advertising also emphasized the beveled edge of the jar base, meant to make it easier to get the last bit of Jif out of the corner. For many decades, TV commercials for the product ended with the tagline, &quot;Choosy mothers choose Jif&quot;, and, in the 1990s, &quot;Choosy moms choose Jif.&quot; From 1998 to 2000, there was a musical jingle that accompanied many Jif ads, which used the lyrics, &quot;Moms like you choose Jif, choose Jif!&quot;

== Manufacturing ==
The original &quot;Creamy&quot; and &quot;Crunchy&quot; style Jif peanut butters both made their nationwide debut in 1958. In 1974, &quot;Extra Crunchy Jif&quot; was introduced, followed in 1991 by &quot;Simply Jif&quot;, a peanut butter variant with low sodium and less sugar than regular Jif. &quot;Reduced Fat Jif&quot; was introduced three years later in 1994.

There are 9 different kinds of Jif Peanut Butter:

* Creamy
* Extra Crunchy
* No Sugar Added Creamy
* Simply Jif Creamy (low sodium and sugar)
* Omega-3 Creamy
* Reduced Fat Creamy
* Natural Creamy
* Natural Honey Creamy
* Natural Crunchy
Jif is also available in a three-pack and an eight-pack of 1.5-ounce individual servings of Jif peanut butter, sold under the name &quot;Jif to Go&quot;. In 2014, Jif introduced a peanut butter-flavored breakfast cereal (manufactured under license by Kellogg&#x27;s).

On May 7, 2012, Jif announced a new line of hazelnut spreads, to be produced in Chocolate and Mocha Cappuccino flavors.

Jif also makes almond butter and cashew butter.
All variants of Jif are produced at a facility in Lexington, Kentucky, which is the largest peanut butter production facility in the world, and a smaller facility in Memphis TN whose products were not affected by the 2022 recall.

==2022 recall==
On May 20, 2022, their peanut butter products which were manufactured in their Lexington, Kentucky plant were recalled in the US and Canada due to potential salmonella contamination. The J.M. Smucker Company estimated a loss of $125 million as a result of the 2022 recall. On July 19, 2022, a class-action lawsuit was filed against J.M. Smucker Co. over the contaminated peanut butter.

As of July 27, 2022, 21 people in 17 states had fallen ill after consuming Jif peanut butter.

<text>It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll is the 12th studio album by English rock band the Rolling Stones, released on 18 October 1974 by Rolling Stones Records. It was the last album to feature guitarist Mick Taylor; the songwriting and recording of the album&#x27;s title track had a connection to Taylor&#x27;s eventual replacement, Ronnie Wood. &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; combines the core blues and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll–oriented sound with elements of funk and reggae. &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; reached number one in the United States and number two in the UK.

Though it was not as successful as their prior albums, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; was an important transitional album for the Rolling Stones. Following the departure of long-time producer Jimmy Miller, the album was self-produced by guitarist Keith Richards and singer Mick Jagger under the pseudonym &quot;The Glimmer Twins&quot;. Taylor, bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts played on most of the tracks, while frequent collaborators Ian Stewart, Nicky Hopkins, and Billy Preston contributed additional instrumentation. The album featured the first appearance of percussionist Ray Cooper, who would continue to work with the Rolling Stones into the 1980s.

The title track was recorded separately from the rest of the album. The basic rhythm track had been laid down by members of the Faces, including Wood and drummer Kenney Jones, during a jam session with Jagger, David Bowie, and bassist Willie Weeks. Jagger liked the song so much that he brought the basic track to Richards, who added some guitar overdubs, and after some polishing, it was put on the album as-is. In 1975, the band began auditioning guitarists including Jeff Beck, Wayne Perkins, Harvey Mandel and Rory Gallagher as possible replacements after the departure of Taylor, while recording the next studio album, &quot;Black and Blue&quot; (1976).

==History==
Work began on &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; following the Rolling Stones&#x27; autumn 1973 European tour. Production began in November at Munich, Germany&#x27;s Musicland Studios. According to guitarist Keith Richards, &quot;We were really hot (off the road) and ready just to play some new material.&quot; The recording sessions were attended by Belgian painter Guy Peellaert, who Mick Jagger invited to do the album cover after seeing his work in the book &quot;Rock Dreams&quot;, which featured illustrations of various rock musicians such as the Rolling Stones. Peellaert eventually painted the band as &quot;rock deities&quot;, descending a temple staircase, surrounded by young girls and women worshiping them in Grecian clothing. The cover bears a very strong resemblance to Henri Gervex&#x27;s painting, &quot;The Coronation of Nicolas II&quot; (1896). The artist refused to sign a deal of exclusivity, and in 1974 provided the album art for David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;.

===Recording===
The album was at first developed as a half-live, half-studio production with one side of the album featuring live performances from the Stones&#x27; European tour while the other side was to be composed of newly recorded cover versions of the band&#x27;s favourite R&amp;B songs. Covers recorded included a take of Dobie Gray&#x27;s &quot;Drift Away&quot;, Jimmy Reed&#x27;s &quot;Shame Shame Shame&quot;, and the Temptations&#x27; &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot;. Soon the band began working off riffs by Richards and new ideas by Mick Jagger and the original concept was scrapped in favour of an album with all-new material. The cover of &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot; was the only recording to make the cut, while the &quot;Drift Away&quot; cover is a popular bootleg.

&quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; marked the Stones&#x27; first effort in the producer&#x27;s chair since &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;, and the first for Jagger and Richards under their pseudonym &quot;The Glimmer Twins&quot;. On the choice to produce, Richards said at the time:

&quot;I think we&#x27;d come to a point with Jimmy (Miller) where the contribution level had dropped because it&#x27;d got to be a habit, a way of life, for Jimmy to do one Stones album a year. He&#x27;d got over the initial sort of excitement which you can feel on &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; and &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;. Also, Mick and I felt that we wanted to try and do it ourselves because we really felt we knew much more about techniques and recording and had our own ideas of how we wanted things to go. &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; hadn&#x27;t turned out as we wanted to – not blaming Jimmy or anything like that... But it was obvious that it was time for a change in that particular part of the process of making records.&quot;

Starting with this release, all future Rolling Stones albums would either be produced by themselves or in collaboration with an outside producer.

Most of the album&#x27;s backing tracks were recorded first at Musicland; solo vocals were recorded later by Jagger, about whom Richards would say, &quot;he often comes up with his best stuff alone in the studio with just an engineer.&quot;

The song &quot;Luxury&quot; showed the band&#x27;s growing interest in reggae music, while &quot;Till the Next Goodbye&quot; and &quot;If You Really Want to Be My Friend&quot; continued their immersion in ballads. Seven of the album&#x27;s 10 songs crack the four-minute mark, a feature that would come to be disparaged during the rising punk rock scene of the late 1970s.

Ronnie Wood, a long-time acquaintance of the band, began to get closer to the Rolling Stones during these sessions after he invited Mick Taylor to play on his debut album, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Own Album to Do&quot;. Taylor spent some time recording and hanging out at Wood&#x27;s house, The Wick. By chance, Richards was asked one night by Wood&#x27;s wife at the time, Krissy, to join them at the guitarist&#x27;s home. While there, Richards recorded some tracks with Wood and quickly developed a close friendship, with Richards going as far as moving into Wood&#x27;s guest room. Jagger soon entered the mix and it was here that the album&#x27;s lead single and title track, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll (But I Like It)&quot;, was first recorded. Wood worked closely on the track with Jagger, who subsequently took the song and title for their album. The released version of this song features Wood on 12-string acoustic guitar.

&quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; was Mick Taylor&#x27;s last album with the Rolling Stones. Similar to receiving no writing credits on the Stones&#x27; previous album, &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot;, Taylor reportedly had made songwriting contributions to &quot;Till the Next Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Time Waits for No One&quot;, but on the album jacket, all original songs were credited to Jagger/Richards. Taylor said in 1997:

&quot;I did have a falling out with Mick Jagger over some songs I felt I should have been credited with co-writing on &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;. We were quite close friends and co-operated quite closely on getting that album made. By that time Mick and Keith weren&#x27;t really working together as a team so I&#x27;d spend a lot of time in the studio.&quot;

Taylor&#x27;s statement contradicts Jagger&#x27;s earlier comment concerning the album. Jagger stated in a 1995 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview about &quot;Time Waits for No One&quot; that Taylor &quot;maybe threw in a couple of chords&quot;.

Alongside the usual outside contributors, namely Billy Preston, Nicky Hopkins and unofficial member Ian Stewart, Elton John sideman Ray Cooper acted as percussionist for the album. Several songs were finished songs and overdubs and mixing were performed at Jagger&#x27;s home, Stargroves, in the early summer of 1974.

==Release==
The lead single, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll (But I Like It)&quot;, was released by Rolling Stones Records on 26 July 1974, with the catalogue number RS 19114 and &quot;Through the Lonely Nights&quot; as the B-side. Despite the familiar sound, it surprised many by failing to reach the top 10 in the United States (although it did reach the top 10 in the UK). With its sing-along chorus, it has become a staple at Rolling Stones concerts. The B-side &quot;Through the Lonely Nights&quot; (later included on the album &quot;Rarities 1971–2003&quot;) dates back to the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; sessions as well as the track &quot;Short and Curlies&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; appeared three months later on 18 October 1974, with the catalogue number COC 59103. The band&#x27;s cover of &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot; was released as the second single in the United States only, with the catalogue number RS-19302 and &quot;Dance Little Sister&quot; as the B-side; it also became a top 20 hit. Its parent album appeared in October with brisk initial sales, reaching number two in the UK (breaking a string of number-one albums that stretched back to 1969&#x27;s &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;) and number one in the United States, where it eventually went platinum.

Instead of immediately touring to promote the album, the band decided to head back into the Munich studios to record the next album, to Taylor&#x27;s disappointment and subsequent resignation from the band. A tour didn&#x27;t happen until the following summer in the United States, the ‘Tour of the Americas &#x27;75’, with future member Ronnie Wood taking Taylor&#x27;s place on guitar.

The title track became a permanent staple of the band&#x27;s live setlist, but apart from some performances of &quot;Ain’t Too Proud to Beg&quot; and &quot;If You Can’t Rock Me&quot; on the Licks Tour, none of the other tracks have been performed since 1977. As of 2023, &quot;Till The Next Goodbye,&quot; &quot;Time Waits For No-One,&quot; &quot;If You Really Want To Be My Friend&quot; and &quot;Short and Curlies&quot; had never been played live.

In order to promote the album, music videos were filmed for several of the songs. The most commonly seen video from the album was the one for &quot;It’s Only Rock’n’Roll (But I Like It),&quot; featuring the band (in U.S. Navy sailor suits) playing in a tent, which gradually fills with soap bubbles (Taylor, Watts and Wyman are all featured in the video but did not play on the actual recording). Videos were also filmed for &quot;Ain’t Too Proud to Beg&quot; and &quot;Till The Next Goodbye.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Initial reviews for &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; were mixed. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Jon Landau called &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; &quot;one of the most intriguing and mysterious, as well as the darkest, of all Rolling Stones records.&quot; Rock critic Lester Bangs disparaged the album in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, much like &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot;, saying, &quot;The Stones have become oblique in their old age, which is just another word for perverse except that perverse is the corniest concept extant as they realized at inception... &quot;Soup&quot; was friendly and safe. I want the edge and this album doesn&#x27;t reassure me that I&#x27;ll get it, what a curious situation to be stuck in, but maybe that&#x27;s the beauty of the Stones, hah, hah, kid? This album is false. Numb. But it cuts like a dull blade. Are they doing the cutting, or are we?&quot; Arthur Levy of &quot;Zoo World&quot; also gave a mixed assessment. While he enjoyed the album more with each listen, he felt it was mixed poorly and that certain tracks, such as &quot;&#x27;Till the Next Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Time Waits for No One&quot;, were evidence that the band were starting to feel the effects the last couple of years had on their music. Numerous reviewers felt the closing track, &quot;Fingerprint File&quot;, was stylistically different from the rest of the album and didn&#x27;t belong.

On the other side, &quot;NME&quot; voted the album as the second best album of the year. When comparing the album to its predecessor, John Morthland of &quot;Creem&quot; gave &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; a positive review, calling it one of the best albums of the year. Although he called the title track &quot;lame&quot;, he considered the songs and the band&#x27;s performance significantly better than &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot;, writing, &quot;they sound like a &quot;band&quot; of interacting members playing songs that they care about, rather than faceless session men layin&#x27; down some tracks&quot;. Similarly, Greg Shaw of &quot;Phonograph Record&quot; considered the record to be better than its predecessor, but felt there was a pervading &quot;nonchalance&quot; throughout the album: &quot;A certain amount of thought and care is put into each song, but not enough to weight it down or divert anyone&#x27;s attention from the groove.&quot; However, Shaw writes that the album as a whole is cohesive, ultimately calling it &quot;the best party album in years&quot;.

Retrospectively, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic felt the record was uneven, but overall considered the songs and performances an improvement over &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot;. In 2020, Steve Sutherland of &quot;Hi-Fi News&quot; similarly called the album the band&#x27;s &quot;riposte&quot; but agreed its overall quality lacked cohesiveness.

==Legacy==
Author James Hector added that &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; was a definitive turning point for the band. &quot;The album marked the band’s decisive entry into a comfortable living as rock&#x27;s elder statesmen. From this point on, their youth culture importance vanished, and there would be few musical surprises in the future.&quot; Hector concluded with &quot;On &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;, the band had become what they imagined their mass audience desired them to be. They were wrong.&quot;

In 1994, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records, in 2009 by Universal Music, and once more in 2011 by Universal Music Enterprises in a Japanese-only SHM-SACD version. The 1994 remaster was initially released in a Collector&#x27;s Edition CD, which replicated in miniature elements of the original vinyl album packaging.

Two different versions of &quot;Luxury&quot; exist. A shorter version (4:30) is included on the early CD version from 1986, while the 5:01 version was originally released on vinyl in Europe, and on the 1994 and 2009 CD remasters. The difference is the shorter version starts the fadeout 30 seconds earlier, and thereby missing the short guitar solo at the end.

<doc id="980541" wikidata="Q6192235" url="?curid=980541" title="Jif (lemon juice)">
<text>Jif is a brand of natural strength lemon juice prepared using lemon juice concentrate and water, whereby the concentrate is reconstituted using water. After reconstitution, it is packaged and marketed. It is sold in the United Kingdom and Ireland by Unilever. Jif is used as a flavourant and ingredient in dishes, and as a condiment. Two tablespoons is around the equivalent of the juice of one lemon. The product has a shelf life of six months.

Jif is packaged in lemon-shaped squeezable containers and in bottles. Development of the plastic container began in the 1950s; it was one of the original blow moulded containers used for food applications. Jif brand lemon juice was established in 1956.

The &quot;Jif Lemon case&quot; occurred in the 1980s, when the US company Borden introduced lemon juice packaged in a similar container to the UK. Reckitt &amp; Coleman sued Borden for passing off. The case was settled in 1990 for Reckitt &amp; Coleman.

Jif is sometimes used on pancakes, and was marketed from 1985 to be used on pancakes for Shrove Tuesday, with the slogan &quot;Don&#x27;t forget the pancakes on Jif Lemon Day&quot;.

==Formulation==

Jif is prepared from reconstituted lemon concentrate and water as primary ingredients, and is formulated to be the same strength as natural lemons. The concentrate is reconstituted using water. The product contains the food preservative E223 (sodium metabisulphite). Jif has a shelf life of six months. Two tablespoons is the equivalent of the juice of one lemon.

===Nutrition information===
A 5 ml serving size of Jif provides 1 kcal (kilocalorie) of energy and 0.1 grams of carbohydrate.

===Uses===
Jif is used as an ingredient and flavourant in dishes and foods, and as a condiment, such as on pancakes. It may be used to add flavour to salads, sauces, fish and seafood, among other foods. It can be used in recipes that require or recommend the use of lemon juice.

==Packaging==

Aside from its plastic, lemon-shaped containers containing 55 ml of juice, usually known as &quot;jiffy lemons&quot; or &quot;jif lemons&quot;, Jif lemon juice is also sold in bottles. The plastic container is a squeeze pack container, whereupon squeezing the container releases juice from its nozzle. Jif containers were embossed with the brand name &quot;Jif&quot; in 1956, the same year the company came into existence. Contemporary Jif containers have the phrase &quot;Jif real lemon juice&quot; embossed on the side of the squeeze pack.

The Jif plastic containers were originally made from polythene, and were one of the original and first blow moulded containers used for food applications. The plastic containers served to replace glass bottles used to package lemon juice. The plastic container was the brainchild of Edward Hack, and the container&#x27;s design was undertaken by Bill Pugh, the chief plastics designer at Cascelloid. In its development, Pugh carved a core made of wood, covered it with fresh lemon peel to give it a realistic texture, and then cast a plaster mould. This led to the realistic-looking container that significantly resembles a lemon.

Some sources have stated that similar plastic lemon packaging existed in Italy at the time of the end of World War II, prior to the time of the packaging design in the United Kingdom.

==History==

===Hax, Realemon and ReaLem brands===
Edward Hack developed the original idea and model of lemon juice being contained inside lemon-shaped and coloured packaging in the 1950s. The product was then designed and produced by Cascelloid Ltd. Hack presented Cascelloid with a fresh lemon he acquired at Covent Garden, upon which to base the plastic container. Hack had performed significant searches at several markets to find an optimal model. Cascelloid stated that Hack reviewed and evaluated the entire inventory of lemons at Fortnum and Mason&#x27;s, Selfridges, Harrods and Covent Garden, the latter of which involved examining three cases of lemons that contained around 300 lemons in each case. Stanley Wagner had been brought up in the wholesale fruit business, his father having a very substantial company in Spitalfields Market. Bill Pugh, the chief plastics designer at Cascelloid, based in Leicester, and former Royal Air Force pilot, created a prototype of the blown lemon-shaped plastic shaped container based upon Hack&#x27;s idea sometime in the 1950s, as well as other types of blown containers. Pugh experimented with the initial design until he was satisfied with its appearance. This plastic lemon product was then used for Hax lemon juice. Edward Hack, Ltd. produced and marketed Hax brand squeezable plastic lemon containers filled with two ounces of Sicilian lemon juice. Per Edward Hack, Ltd., the juice was unfiltered, had no water added to it, and contained a preservative to prevent spoilage. Retailers could purchase the product in packs of six bags that contained 12 squeeze packs each, totalling 72 units. Upon introduction to the marketplace, Hax juice and the plastic lemon design received some press coverage. The Hax logo used on Hax lemon juice dates back to at least 1935, at which time it was used in advertisements for Hax brand iodine pencils and Hax brand aspirin.

The plastic lemon container and the idea of marketing lemon juice in this manner was also undertaken independently by Stanley Wagner, a businessperson in the frozen food industry, and also a former Royal Air Force fighter pilot. Wagner&#x27;s plastic lemon was produced by Shipton, a plastics company. Wagner was with the company Coldcrops, Ltd., which produced Realemon. The Realemon trademark was developed and used for a lemon juice product based upon reconstitution in the 1940s. Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax lemon juice was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped container, with Coldcrops following shortly thereafter with their own design. It is of intrigue to some that both Pugh and Wagner were both former Royal Air Force pilots.

Over the course of a ten-month period from mid-1955 to early 1956 more than six million of the plastic juice lemons were sold by Coldcrops. This initially began under the brand name &quot;Realemon&quot;, and then after an objection by the then Board of Trade, the name was changed to &quot;ReaLem&quot; and marketed with the slogan &quot;juice in a jiffy&quot;. The Board of Trade objected because it was perceived that Coldcrops was possibly passing off their product as the Realemon brand from the United States. During this same time period, Hax was marketing tomato ketchup and brown sauce in custom-shaped plastic containers, for use on restaurant tables. After a long argument about plastic containers, the two companies agreed that they would not compete with one-another, and Coldcrops took the marketing rights for plastic lemons under the ReaLem brand. Coldcrops would market ReaLem lemon juice and agreed to not enter other plastic container markets.

===Jif brand===
Reckitt and Colman approached Stanley Wagner to buy Coldcrops, and after a very long negotiation a deal was concluded. A letter from Barclays Bank dated 21 June 1956 reads &quot; Dear Mr Wagner, I have pleasure in enclosing two copies of the Draft for £... credited to your account, which the Bank will be pleased if you will accept as a souvenir of this most successful transaction&quot;. The deal transferred ownership of the packaging and concept from Coldcrops to Reckitt &amp; Coleman, and the new Jif-brand lemon juice was launched in 1956. All parties were delighted, Stanley Wagner with a substantial sum of money, for those days and a large profit from the six million lemons that had been sold, Reckitt&#x27;s even more so because the negotiating team had permission to pay far more for the business than they were able to achieve. Lemon farmers in Sicily were also pleased, because the demand had increased for Sicilian lemon juice, which was largely a by-product of Sicilian lemon oil production. For many years, whilst producing lemon oil, Sicilians had found little use for the juice. Now there was a rapidly growing market for their near-waste product. In 1970, Jif continued to be prepared with lemon juice from Sicily. Later on, Unilever acquired the Jif brand in 1995 for the price of £250m, when it purchased Colman&#x27;s of Norwich.

At the time of Jif&#x27;s product launch in 1956, it was marketed with the tagline &#x27;Real lemon juice in a Jif&#x27;. In 1956, Jif was the sole brand of lemon juice packaged in a squeeze pack container in the United Kingdom. The new Jif brand used the packaging developed by Shipton Plastics, ( a manufacturer of telephone casings), quite independently of Hack and Cascelloid, developing the plastic lemon for ReaLemon whilst Cascelloid were concentrating on tomato ketchup containers. 
===Competitors===
The U.S. company Borden acquired the rights to the ReaLemon brand of lemon juice in the United States in 1962 when it purchased the ReaLemon-Puritan Company for around $12.4 million. ReaLemon had begun production in the U.S. in the 1930s.

Sales of ReaLemon realized successful profits in Europe in 1975, at which time Borden expanded into the United Kingdom market, purveying a 250 ml bottle of lemon juice. By 1980, ReaLemon comprised around 25% of the U.K. lemon juice market. In response to this competition, Reckitt &amp; Coleman began producing Jif in 150 ml- and 250 ml-sized bottles. Borden then began making plans to market ReaLemon in a lemon-shaped package that was similar to Jif&#x27;s packaging. This resulted in a lawsuit initiated by Reckitt &amp; Coleman against Borden, based upon the notion that ReaLemon was attempting to copy Jif&#x27;s packaging in attempts to mislead consumers, by passing off their product as Jif.

The case became known as &quot;The Jif Lemon case&quot;, and was settled in 1990 in the Court of Appeal. It was ruled that a sufficient public recognition of Jif&#x27;s packaging was existent, which created an established reputation for the brand. The ruling stated that consumers would be &quot;likely to believe that the ReaLemon was a Jif Lemon when they saw it on a supermarket shelf.&quot; The ruling in Reckitt &amp; Colman&#x27;s favour occurred even though Reckitt &amp; Colman did not register the plastic lemon packaging.

==Marketing==
Jif is sometimes used on pancakes. An advertising campaign introduced the catch-phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t forget the pancakes on Jif lemon day,&quot; in reference to Shrove Tuesday, which is also referred to as Pancake Day. The campaign and slogan was devised by Reckitt and Colman&#x27;s advertising agency, Foote Cone and Belding. The Jif lemon-shaped packaging aligned Jif with the consumption of pancakes on Shrove Tuesday in consumers&#x27; minds, creating a strong link between the product and Shrove Tuesday. Jif and pancakes is a popular combination on Shrove Tuesday. In 2000, over 80,000 Jif lemons were being produced per day to meet consumer demand for Pancake Day, beginning five weeks prior to Pancake Day. This occurred despite fresh lemons having greater availability during this time compared to other time periods. The adverts were shown throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s decades on television screens in Ireland and United Kingdom.

<doc id="980546" wikidata="Q773214" url="?curid=980546" title="Jitte">
<text>A is a blunt melee weapon that was used by police in Edo-period Japan (1603–1868). In English-language sources, it is sometimes incorrectly spelled jutte, such as in Ikkaku-ryū juttejutsu.

==History==
In feudal Japan, it was a crime punishable by death to bring a sword into the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s palace. This law applied to almost everyone, including the palace guards. Due to this prohibition, several kinds of non-bladed weapons were carried by palace guards. The jitte proved particularly effective and evolved to become the symbol of a palace guard&#x27;s exalted position.

In Edo-period Japan, the jitte was a substitute for a badge, and it represented someone on official business. It was carried by all levels of police officers, including high-ranking samurai police officials and low-rank samurai law enforcement officers (called &quot;okappiki&quot; or &quot;doshin&quot;). Other high-ranking samurai officials carried a jitte as a badge of office, including hotel, rice and grain inspectors (&quot;aratame&quot;). The jitte is the subject of the Japanese martial art of &quot;jittejutsu&quot;.

==Description and technique==

Jitte may have a small point or blade attached to the hilt (&quot;tsuka&quot;) and hidden in the main shaft (&quot;boshin&quot;). Jitte could be highly decorated with all manner of inlays and designs or very plain and basic depending on the status of the owner and the jitte&#x27;s intended use. Jitte could range in length from around 12 to over 24 in (). The modern jitte has a main shaft of about long, which ends in a blunt point (&quot;sentan&quot;), and a one-hooked tine (&quot;kagi&quot;) of about long starting just above the hilt. A popular misconception is that the &quot;kagi&quot; is used to catch a sword. It could possibly be used for this purpose, but the hook&#x27;s proximity to the hand would make it rather dangerous; a more likely use for the hook would be to capture and arrest the blade after blocking it with the &quot;boshin&quot;. The &quot;kagi&quot;″s more common use is to hook into clothing or parts of the body like the nose or mouth, or to push into joints or other weak points on the body. It also could be used to hook the thumb while holding the weapon backwards, to allow different techniques such as punches and blocks, similarly to a sai. The jitte can also be used in much the same manner as other short sticks or batons, to strike large muscle groups and aid in joint manipulation.

==Parts of the jitte==
*, the main shaft of the &quot;jitte&quot; which could be round or faceted. The &quot;boshin&quot; of most &quot;jitte&quot; were iron, but some were made from wood.
*, the hook protruding from the side of the &quot;boshin&quot;. &quot;Jitte&quot; may have more than one &quot;kagi&quot;, with some &quot;jitte&quot; having two or even three &quot;kagi&quot;.
*, the ring or loop at the pommel of the &quot;tsuka&quot;. A cord or tassel could be tied to the &quot;kan&quot;. Also note its &#x27;skull cracker&#x27; design.
*Kikuza (&quot;chrysanthemum seat&quot;): if the &quot;kagi&quot; is attached to the &quot;boshin&quot; through a hole in the &quot;boshin&quot;, the protrusion on the opposite side is called a &quot;kikuza&quot;.
* Koshirae. &quot;Jitte&quot; can occasionally be found housed in a sword-type case hiding the &quot;jitte&quot; from view entirely. This type of &quot;jitte&quot; can have the same parts and fittings as a sword, including &quot;seppa&quot;, &quot;tsuba&quot;, &quot;menuki&quot;, &quot;koiguchi&quot;, &quot;kojiri&quot;, &quot;nakago&quot;, &quot;mekugi-ana&quot; and &quot;mei&quot;.
*, the blunt point of the main shaft of the &quot;jitte&quot;.
* Tsuba, a hand guard present on some types of &quot;jitte&quot;.
*, the hilt of the &quot;jitte&quot;, which could be wrapped or covered with various materials, or left plain.
*, the wrapping on the hilt (&quot;tsuka&quot;). Materials such as ray skin (&quot;&quot;), leather, and cord were used.

==Other jitte types and similar weapons==
*&quot;Hachiwara&quot;
*&quot;Karakuri jitte&quot;
*&quot;Marohoshi&quot;
*&quot;Naeshi&quot; or &quot;nayashi&quot; &quot;jitte&quot; have no hook or &quot;kagi&quot;.

<doc id="980547" wikidata="Q2723933" url="?curid=980547" title="Tom Bergeron">
<text>Thomas Raymond Bergeron (born May 6, 1955) is an American television personality, comedian, and game show host, best known for hosting &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; from 1994 to 1997, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; from 1998 to 2004, &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; from 2001 to 2015, and &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; from 2005 to 2019 as well as being an anchor on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; from 1997 to 1998 and a cohost on the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2008. 
==Early life and career==
Bergeron was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts, the son of Adrian Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; Bergeron Jr. (1934–2015) and Mary Catherine “Kay” Costello (1933–2016). Bergeron is of French Canadian and Irish descent. While being interviewed on the Howard Stern Show, Bergeron revealed when he was 17 years old he interviewed Larry Fine and Moe Howard of the Three Stooges after contacting the nursing home Larry was living in.

His first job in broadcasting was as a disc jockey at local radio station WHAV, in his home town of Haverhill, Massachusetts. He became a popular radio DJ in the Seacoast area of New Hampshire in the early 1980s on Portsmouth&#x27;s WHEB, where he played comedy records along with music and offbeat interviews. His popularity led to additional TV and radio auditions.

One of his first jobs on television was as host of a local game show, &quot;Granite State Challenge&quot;, on New Hampshire Public Television (produced at NHPTV flagship station WENH-TV). He moved to the Boston market in February 1982, joining WBZ-TV as a general on-air personality. His early roles at the station included being a contributor on &quot;Evening Magazine&quot; (1982–1987), and hosting brief informational and show preview segments known as &quot;4 Today&quot;, every 30 minutes during WBZ&#x27;s daytime lineup (1983–1987). In 1984, he landed the hosting spot on &quot;Lottery Live&quot;, the nightly drawings of the Massachusetts State Lottery games. By January 1987, while still working in these roles, Bergeron added &quot;People Are Talking&quot; to his duties. He replaced outgoing host Buzz Luttrell on the early afternoon talk show, where he gained even more popularity. While Ron Cantera took over as host of &quot;4 Today&quot; (until its cancellation in 1988), Bergeron remained lottery host until drawings moved to WNEV-TV in August 1987. Bergeron additionally served as the original host of WBZ&#x27;s weekend morning teenage discussion series &quot;Rap-Around&quot; from 1987 to 1989.

By the early 1990s, Bergeron was seen as a solid figure in Boston television, and WBZ continued to capitalize on his talents by featuring him on WBZ Radio. It was there he had an early-morning radio show called &quot;The Tom Bergeron Show&quot;. When &quot;People Are Talking&quot; ended a successful 13-year run in June 1993, Bergeron remained on WBZ-TV as commentator and lifestyle reporter for the station&#x27;s expanded hour-long noon newscast. In early 1994, Bergeron briefly surfaced as a morning host on Boston&#x27;s soft-rock station WMJX (&quot;Magic 106.7&quot;), which was only a short commute to WBZ&#x27;s studios for his work on the noon news.

Bergeron credits a portion of his success as a television personality to his more than 35 years of regularly practicing Transcendental Meditation. He discussed his meditation practice on &quot;10 Percent Happier with Dan Harris&quot; and &quot;The Fifth Dimension: A Mindfulness Podcast&quot;.

===National television work===
From 1994 to 1997, Bergeron co-hosted the morning show &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; on FX and later re-titled &quot;Fox After Breakfast&quot; when the show moved to the Fox Network.
 In 1997, Bergeron joined ABC, where he served as a guest host for &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.

Bergeron was the host of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; from 1998 to 2004, a role for which he won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host in 2000.

In February 2001, he became the new host of the ABC series &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;. In March 2014, Bergeron announced on Twitter that he would not be hosting &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; after season 25. Bergeron&#x27;s final episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; aired May 17, 2015. He was replaced by Alfonso Ribeiro.

In June 2005, he began hosting the reality series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, also on ABC. For his work on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, he received nine Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Competition Program, winning the award once in 2012. On July 13, 2020, Bergeron announced he had been let go from the series ahead of its 29th season in a message posted on Twitter. 

On September 20, 2008, Bergeron co-hosted the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards alongside Heidi Klum, Jeff Probst, Ryan Seacrest, and Howie Mandel. The five were selected to host in recognition of their nominations in the inaugural category of Outstanding Host for a Reality or Competition Program.

In 2020, Bergeron competed in the third season of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Taco&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bergeron has been married to Lois since 1982 and has two daughters.

In 2009, Bergeron published his autobiography &quot;I&#x27;m Hosting as Fast as I Can!: Zen and the Art of Staying Sane in Hollywood&quot;.

<doc id="980548" wikidata="Q8035203" url="?curid=980548" title="World's Biggest Gang Bang">
<text>The World&#x27;s Biggest Gang Bang is a pornographic film staged in a Hollywood studio starring Annabel Chong and billed as her having sex with 300 men. In reality, the participants were far fewer than advertised. They are said to have engaged with Chong in a total of 251 sex acts. The event was organized by pornographic film director John T. Bone.

The resulting video, released in 1995, is one of the highest-grossing pornographic films ever. The record attempt caught the attention of film director Gough Lewis and Chong became the subject of his documentary &quot;&quot;. Lewis&#x27;s documentary was a hit at the Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.

==Synopsis==

The event begins with a few interviews with some of the participants. Annabel Chong arrives later and is greeted by the event director. Bone briefs Chong on the format and then gives a briefing to the rest of the participants. The footage cuts to an interview Chong gives to the press. Ron Jeremy (host of the event) introduces the fluff girls and commences the gang bang. Chong, changed into a gown, emerges from a side entrance and climbs onto the stage. The stage, built to look like a Roman playground, has a bed in the middle; the setting was intended to allude to the orgy of Roman empress Messalina. Bone, using a loudspeaker, calls for the first five participants. Chong engages in sex acts with the participants for five to ten minutes until the next group is called. Chong had insisted on the use of condoms for the event, but those of the men who were professional performers were allowed to participate without using them.

==Criticism==
Criticism was levied against the producers of &quot;The World&#x27;s Biggest Gang Bang&quot; for the level of risk Chong unknowingly exposed herself to. There was no requirement for the men to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases other than AIDS. It later emerged that they had not provided proof of testing negative for HIV – contrary to what Chong had been led to believe. A number of men participated without the use of a condom.

A seeming failure to pay Chong also attracted criticism. The movie is one of the highest-grossing pornographic films, but as alluded to in the documentary &quot;&quot;, Chong was never paid the US$10,000 she was promised, and apparently did not receive any money at all from the video.

<text>The Marble Faun: Or, The Romance of Monte Beni, also known by the British title Transformation, was the last of the four major romances by Nathaniel Hawthorne, and was published in 1860. &quot;The Marble Faun&quot;, written on the eve of the American Civil War, is set in a fantastical Italy. The romance mixes elements of a fable, pastoral, gothic novel, and travel guide.

==Characters==
This romance focuses on four main characters: Miriam, Hilda, Kenyon, and Donatello.

Miriam is a beautiful painter with an unknown past. Throughout the novel, she is compared to many other women including Eve, Beatrice Cenci, Judith, and Cleopatra. Miriam is pursued by a mysterious, threatening man who is her “evil genius” through life. Hilda is an innocent copyist. She is compared to the Virgin Mary and the white dove. Her simple, unbendable moral principles can make her severe in spite of her tender heart. Miriam and Hilda are often contrasted.

Kenyon is a sculptor who represents rationalist humanism. He cherishes a romantic affection towards Hilda. Donatello, the Count of Monte Beni, is often compared to Adam and is in love with Miriam. Donatello amazingly resembles the marble Faun of Praxiteles, and the novel plays with the characters’ belief that the Count may be a descendant of the antique Faun. Hawthorne, however, withholds a definite statement even in the novel’s concluding chapters and postscript.

==Composition and publication history==
After writing &quot;The Blithedale Romance&quot; in 1852, Hawthorne, who was then approaching fifty, was granted a political appointment as American Consul in Liverpool, England, which he held from 1853 to 1857. In 1858, Hawthorne and his wife Sophia Peabody moved the family to Italy and became tourists for a year and a half. In early 1858, Hawthorne was inspired to write his romance when he saw the Faun of Praxiteles in the Palazzo Nuovo of the Capitoline Museum in Rome.

Hawthorne began the manuscript and intended to complete it at the family home, The Wayside, in Concord, Massachusetts. Instead, he returned to England, where he would remain until July 1860, and entirely rewrote the book. On October 10, 1859, he wrote to his American publisher James T. Fields that his wife enjoyed what she had read thus far and &quot;speaks of it very rapturously. If she liked the author less, I should feel much encouraged by her liking the Romance so much. I likewise (to confess the truth) admire it exceedingly, at intervals, but am liable to cold fits, during which I think it the most infernal nonsense.&quot; Sophia wrote to her sister Elizabeth Peabody that her husband&#x27;s reaction was typical: &quot;As usual, he thinks the book good for nothing... He has regularly despised each one of his books immediately upon finishing it.&quot;

Hawthorne struggled with a title for his new book. He considered several, including &quot;Monte Beni; or, The Faun: A Romance&quot;, The Romance of a Faun&quot;, Marble and Life; a Romance&quot;, &quot;Marble and Man; a Romance&quot;, and &quot;St. Hilda&#x27;s Shrine&quot;. The book was published simultaneously in America and England in late 1860; the title for the British edition was &quot;Transformation: Or the Romance of Monte Beni&quot;. The alternate title was chosen by the publishers and was used against Hawthorne&#x27;s wishes. Both titles continue to be used today in the U.K. Encouraged to write a book long enough to fill three volumes, Hawthorne included extended descriptions that critics found distracting or boring. Complaints about the ambiguous ending led Hawthorne to add a postscript to the second edition.

==Critical response==

Ralph Waldo Emerson called the novel &quot;mush&quot; but James Russell Lowell was pleased with it and praised it as a Christian parable. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow privately wrote that it was a &quot;wonderful book&quot; but that it had &quot;the old, dull pain in it that runs through all of Hawthorne&#x27;s writings&quot;. Reviews were generally favorable, though many were confused by the ending. William Dean Howells later wrote: &quot;Everybody was reading it, and more or less bewailing its indefinite close, but yielding him that full honor and praise which a writer can hope for but once in his life.&quot; Friend and critic Edwin Percy Whipple noted that, even if Hawthorne had written nothing else, &quot;The Marble Faun&quot; would qualify him as a master of English composition. John Lothrop Motley wrote a long private letter to Hawthorne full of effusive praise:

==Influence==
*&quot;The Marble Faun&quot; has been cited as an influence on H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot;.
* &quot;A Marble Faun&quot; is also the title of a book of poetry published in 1924 by William Faulkner.

==Adaptations==
In 1977 the novel was adapted into a three-part Italian miniseries, produced by RAI and directed by Silverio Blasi.

The novel was adapted into an opera with music by Ellen Bender and a libretto by Jessica Treadway, completed in 1996.

<text>Robert Varkonyi is an American poker player, best known for winning the Main Event of the 2002 World Series of Poker. 

==Early life==
Varkonyi first started playing poker as an undergraduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

After his graduation in 1983 (with degrees in EECS and from the MIT Sloan School of Management), he was an investment banker in Brooklyn, New York for a number of years before beginning to play tournament poker.

==Poker career==
Varkonyi is most well known for winning the 2002 World Series of Poker Main Event, taking the $2 million prize. In the final hand, Varkonyi&#x27;s defeated Julian Gardner&#x27;s on a board of , resulting in Varkonyi&#x27;s full house defeating Gardner&#x27;s flush.

In the WSOP Main Event the following year, Varkonyi was at the televised feature table, playing in defense of his championship. Two-time world champion Doyle Brunson was also featured at the table for a while. Later in the broadcast, 1998 world champion Scotty Nguyen was also at the feature table and they played several hands together. In the 2003 World Series of Poker, Varkonyi&#x27;s chance of a repeat championship was dashed when his met Nguyen&#x27;s .

He cashed in the main event in 2007, finishing in 177th place in a field of over six thousand players, winning $51,398.

<doc id="980565" wikidata="Q1702920" url="?curid=980565" title="Jonas Bronck">
<text>Jonas Bronck (alternatively Jonas Jonsson Brunk, Jonas Jonasson Bronk, or Jonas Jonassen Bronck) (around 1600 – 1643) was a settler in the Dutch colony of New Netherland after whom the Bronx River, and by extension, the county and New York City borough of the Bronx are named.
==Origin==
Different theories account for Bronck&#x27;s origin. The official historian of the Bronx, Lloyd Ultan, has adopted the theory that Bronck came from Sweden. The Bronx County Historical Society and other publications followed suit.

A number of sources published in the early 20th century identify Bronck as Swedish, an idea espoused by A. J. F. van Laer, archivist at the New York State Library. &quot;&quot;, winner of the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for History, also parenthetically claims Bronck as a Dane. A 1908 publication portrays Bronck as a Mennonite who fled the Netherlands to Sweden because of religious persecution. In a 1977 pamphlet commemorating the founding of the borough a publication of the Bronx County Bar Association states that it &quot;is widely accepted that Bronck came from Sweden, but claims have also been made by the Frisian Islands on the North Sea coast and by a small town in Germany&quot;.

In 1981, the Manx-Svenska Publishing Co. released a now out-of-print 19-page pamphlet, &quot;The Founder of the Bronx&quot;, authored G. V. C. Young O.B.E., after he had conducted research in the Netherlands, Sweden, and New York. Young reported that he examined crucial references: Bronck&#x27;s betrothal certificate dated June 18, 1638, and Bronck&#x27;s document of guarantee from April 30, 1639. The theory of Bronck&#x27;s Swedish origin fundamentally rely on Young&#x27;s interpretations of three key words found in these Dutch-language documents and that Jonas Bronck&#x27;s relative Pieter Bronck was born in 1616 in Jönköping, Sweden. In conjunction with John Davidson of Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands and Eva Brylla from the Ortnamnsarkiv in Uppsala, Sweden, the archival texts were transcribed from their traditional script. Young states that Bronck&#x27;s middle name Jonsson means that his father&#x27;s first name was Jonas (excluding the Faroe reverend Morten Bronck) and further that the words referring to Bronck&#x27;s birthplace and spelled &quot;Coonstay&quot; and &quot;Smolach&quot; speaks for that it is most likely that &quot;Coonstay&quot; was Komstad in Jönköping county and that &quot;Smolach&quot; was a misrecording of Småland, the province in which Jönköping is located. Young concludes Jonas Bronck was born circa 1600 in Komstad, Småland, a historic province of Sweden. This farm or small village was at this time inhabited by Jon Nilsson and his wife Marit Brunk who could be Jonas Bronck&#x27;s parents or other relatives. The New York Times cites Sävsjö the seat of Sävsjö Municipality in Jönköping County, Sweden, of which Komstad was part.

==Marriage==
On June 18, 1638, Bronck signed his banns of marriage as Jonas Jonasson Bronck. This patronym indicated that his father&#x27;s name was Jonas, which supports the theory of Swedish origin. He and his Dutch wife, Teuntje Joriaens, married at the New Church in Amsterdam on July 6, 1638.

==Immigration to New Netherland==
Jonas Bronck&#x27;s decision to relocate from Europe was prompted by a number of factors.

During the late 1630s, events in both Holland and America induced significant changes in the governance of New Netherland, territory controlled by the Dutch West India Company (WIC) between the Delaware and Connecticut rivers, and north along tidewaters of the Hudson. At its heart was the trading facility of New Amsterdam on the southern tip of Manhattan Island.

Following the spectacular collapse of the Tulip mania in 1637, Holland&#x27;s government contemplated the idea of taking control of New Netherland from the company and using the colony for resettlement of individuals impoverished by failed tulip bulb speculations. There also was vexation over the West India Company&#x27;s failure to develop New Netherland much beyond its original function, facilitating the fur trade. By contrast, English enclaves in the region were rapidly expanding in territory, population, and viability.

New Amsterdam&#x27;s inhabitants then numbered only about four hundred, a count that hardly had increased during the previous decade. Company properties in the colony showed signs of physical neglect and conditions of law and order were less than ideal. Faced with possible government expropriation, the company appointed Willem Kieft as director of New Netherland with a mandate to increase the territory&#x27;s population and vitality. Arriving in 1638, Kieft promptly purchased additional Lenape lands in the environs of Manhattan and encouraged private settlement by enterprising colonists of diverse backgrounds. It also liberalized the previous Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions so that settlers were no longer encumbered with excessive responsibilities to the WIC. Previously, most real estate and commercial activity in New Netherland had been under its direct control.

These vicissitudes did not escape Bronck&#x27;s notice. He was among the first to recognize promising opportunities, and along with various emigrants from Europe he crossed the Atlantic to settle in New Amsterdam&#x27;s hinterlands. Vriessendael and Colen Donck were established around the same time.

In the spring of 1639, Jonas Bronck and a party of other emigrants, including his good friend, the Dane Jochem Pietersen Kuyter, departed the Dutch port of Hoorn on the Zuiderzee. In addition to passengers and crew, their ship, &quot;De Brandt van Troyen&quot; (&quot;Fire of Troy&quot;), was laden with numerous cattle. On June 16, the vessel was seen in the harbor of New Amsterdam.

==Site of homestead==

Bronck and Kuyter navigated up the East River to land that was within the territory of the Siwanoy and Wecquaesgeek groups of Wappinger who inhabited it at the time of colonialization. It is said that Bronck wrote of his new home: &quot;The invisible hand of the Almighty Father, surely guided me to this beautiful country, a land covered with virgin forest and unlimited opportunities. It is a veritable paradise and needs but the industrious hand of man to make it the finest and most beautiful region in all the world.&quot; Kuyter chose land on the west bank on the island of Manhattan; Bronck settled on the mainland. Teuntje and Jonas Bronck&#x27;s house was built by a promontory at the juncture of the Harlem River and the Bronx Kill across from Randalls Island and was constructed like &quot;a miniature fort with stone walls and a tile roof&quot;. Bronck&#x27;s farmstead consisted of approximately , which being a religious man, he named Emaus. (Emmaus, according to the New Testament, is where Jesus appeared before two of his followers after his resurrection.) The site is in present-day Mott Haven, about 1,000 feet south of Bruckner Boulevard and 500 feet east of the Willis Avenue Bridge, on a tract (at approximately ) now part of the Harlem River Intermodal Yard, through which runs the Oak Point Link.

==Relations with Lenape tribes==
On April 22, 1642, a peace treaty was signed at Bronck&#x27;s homestead between Dutch authorities and the Wecquaesgeek sachems Ranaqua and Tackamuck. This event is portrayed in a painting by the American artist John Ward Dunsmore (1856–1945).

On February 23, 1643, Director of New Netherland William Kieft launched an attack on refugee camps of the Weckquaesgeek and Tappan. Expansionist Mahican and Mohawk in the North (armed with guns traded by the French and English) had driven them south the year before, where they sought protection from the Dutch. Kieft refused aid despite the company&#x27;s previous guarantees to the tribes to provide it. The attacks were at Communipaw (in today&#x27;s Jersey City) and Corlaers Hook (lower Manhattan) in what is known as the Pavonia Massacre. The slaughter led to retaliation and attacks on many settlements outlying New Amsterdam, including some in what is now the Bronx, such as that of Anne Hutchinson. It is unknown if Bronck&#x27;s death was related to the skirmishes.

==Last testament==
Saturday May 6, 1643, not long after Jonas Bronck&#x27;s death, his widow Teuntje Joriaens, together with Peter Bronck, conducted a formal inventory of the Bronck farm which was then known as Emaus. This procedure was conducted in the presence of the Rev. Everardus Bogardus, pastor of the First Reformed Dutch Church of New Amsterdam and Bronck&#x27;s friend Jochem Pietersen Kuyter. According to official records of the State of New York, the latter two were identified as guardians of Bronck&#x27;s widow. (In June 1643 Teuntje remarried. She and her new husband, Arent van Curler, soon thereafter departed for Beverwyck, a settlement on the North River near Fort Orange.)

The inventory lists contents of the farm Bronck and his family had built in the wilderness during the period of less than four years following his arrival in America. Buildings on the property were a stone house with a tile roof, a barn, two barracks for farm employees, and a tobacco house. The tally of Bronck&#x27;s livestock was 25 animals of various kinds, plus an uncounted number of hogs, said to be running in nearby woods.

During the early 1640s, it was not uncommon for Bronck&#x27;s New Amsterdam contemporaries to identify themselves on legal documents with graphic marks that also were symbols of illiteracy. By contrast, Jonas Bronck&#x27;s personal library provides evidence he was literate in four languages, suggesting his education might have been as high as university level. His library was an impressive archive for its time and place, and is regarded as the earliest for which there is a detailed account in the colonial records of New York.

The following materials were listed in the inventory of Bronck&#x27;s library: one Bible, folio; Calvin&#x27;s Institutes, folio; Bullingeri, Schultetus Dominicalia, (Medical); Moleneri Praxis, (Moral and Practical Discourses), quarto; one German Bible, quarto; Mirror of the Sea (Seespiegel), folio; one Luther&#x27;s Psalter; Sledani, (History of the Reformation), folio; Danish chronicle, quarto; Danish law book, quarto; Luther&#x27;s Complete Catechism; The Praise of Christ, quarto; Petri Apiani; Danish child&#x27;s book; a book called Forty Pictures of Death, by Symon Golaert; Biblical stories; Danish calendar; Survey (or View) of the Great Navigation; a parcel of eighteen Dutch and Danish pamphlets by various authors; seventeen books in manuscript, which are old; and eleven pictures, large and small.

==Bronck&#x27;s becomes Bronx==
Bronck&#x27;s farm, a tract of , known as the biblical Emmaus, Bronck&#x27;s Land, and then just Broncksland, or simply Bronck&#x27;s— covered roughly the area emanating from general vicinity of Willis Avenue and 132nd Street in the Bronx in what, today, is Mott Haven.

Following Bronck&#x27;s death, and the dispersion of the few settlers, the tract passed through the hands of successive Dutch traders until 1664, when it came into the possession of Samuel Edsall, (who also had acquired a large tract on the North River known as the English Neighborhood), who held it until 1670. He sold it to Captain Richard Morris and Colonel Lewis Morris, at the time merchants of Barbados. Four years later, Colonel Morris obtained a royal patent to Bronck&#x27;s Land, which afterward became the Manor of Morrisania, the second Lewis (son of Captain Richard), exercising proprietary right.

Despite Bronck having lived there for only four years, the area was known as &quot;Broncksland&quot; through the end of the 17th century. The current spelling came into use in 1697.

==Descendants and relations==
Pieter Bronck also was known as Pieter Jonasson Bronck. Given the relative closeness in age and same father&#x27;s name indicated by the patronym (Jonas was born about 1600, Pieter, born in 1616 in Jönköping, Sweden) it has been claimed that Pieter was a nephew or cousin to Jonas Bronck, and not a son as had been surmised. This would however in both cases mean that Jonas Bronck or his father Jonas have had a living brother with identical name, something which is unheard of in Scandinavian naming. They might instead have been brothers, as an age difference of 16 years among even full siblings is far from unlikely. Still he has been described as the &quot;poorer cousin&quot;, and is believed to have emigrated to Beverwijck in the Hudson Valley circa 1650. The Pieter Bronck House is a registered historic place in Coxsackie, New York. The American poet William Bronk reported that he was a descendant of Pieter Bronck. The American biophysicist (and president of Rockefeller University) Detlev Bronk claimed to have been a Bronck descendant, but no evidence of lineage to Pieter&#x27;s line was ever found or indicated.

==Legacy==

A mural at the Bronx County Courthouse depicting Bronck&#x27;s arrival was created in the early 1930s by James Monroe Hewlett.

===Namesakes===

The town of Tórshavn, the capital of the Faroe Islands, has a street bearing the name Jónas Broncksgøta (Jonas Bronck&#x27;s Street). One theory holds that Jonas Jonsson Bronck was born ca. 1600, son of a Lutheran minister, Morten Jespersen Bronck, and was raised in Tórshavn. That Jonas Bronck&#x27;s middle name would in this case be Mortensen, not Jonsson, speaks against this theory. The Faroe family may have originated from the Norwegian district of Elverum. (At the time, the Faroe Islands were part of a political entity also comprising Iceland, Greenland, Denmark and Norway.) In 1619 the younger Bronck went to school in Roskilde, Denmark, and eventually made his way to Holland.

The Jonas Bronck Academy and Public School 43 Jonas Bronck are located in the Bronx. A local brewery produces Jonas Bronck Beer.

=== Jonas Bronck Center===
There is a Jonas Bronck Center in Sävsjö, Sweden. where a celebration of the 375th anniversary of Jonas Bronck&#x27;s settlement of the Bronx took place in August 2014. The celebration was mainly the idea of Brian G. Andersson, the former commissioner of the New York City Department of Records and Information Services, a specialist in Bronck&#x27;s genealogy, a founding director of the center, and a Bronxite of Swedish origin.

<doc id="980573" wikidata="Q7070689" url="?curid=980573" title="Nuyorican movement">
<text>The Nuyorican movement is a cultural and intellectual movement involving poets, writers, musicians and artists who are Puerto Rican or of Puerto Rican descent, who live in or near New York City, and either call themselves or are known as Nuyoricans. It originated in the late 1960s and early 1970s in neighborhoods such as Loisaida, East Harlem, Williamsburg, and the South Bronx as a means to validate Puerto Rican experience in the United States, particularly for poor and working-class people who suffered from marginalization, ostracism, and discrimination.

The term Nuyorican was originally used as an insult until leading artists such as Miguel Algarín reclaimed it and transformed its meaning. Key cultural organizations such as the Nuyorican Poets Café and Charas/El Bohio in the Lower East Side, the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater, Agüeybaná Bookstore, Mixta Gallery, Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, El Museo del Barrio, and El Maestro were some of the institutional manifestations of this movement. The next generation of Nuyorican cultural hubs include PRdream.com, Camaradas El Barrio in Spanish Harlem and Piragua Art Space on the lower east side of Manhattan. Social and political counterparts to those establishments in late 1960s and 70s New York include the Young Lords and the ASPIRA Association.

== Charas/El Bohio ==

=== History ===
Puerto Rico&#x27;s history and culture in the Lower East Side, known to much of its Puerto Rican community as Loisaida, is long and extensive. From early 1400s to the end of the 1800s, Puerto Rico had slavery and was dutiful to the Spanish Crown. With granted autonomy from Spain in 1897, Puerto Rico was allowed to elect and print their own currency for a year as a territory. In 1898, The United States seized control over the territory. Being a sugar cane and coffee dependent nation allowed for the United States to intervene and rule Puerto Rico politically and economically, with no intention of giving Puerto Ricans citizenship. In 1910, the American government grew fearful of an uprising. In order to keep Puerto Rico under control from being independent, the United States imposed U.S. citizenship, never consulting the actual people who resided in Puerto Rico. Since the United States only allowed or the production of sugarcane the people started to go hungry, leaving them with no choice but to leave the island in search for a better life in the United States. Puerto Ricans began to migrate to places like New York City, specifically to Puerto Rican enclaves, such as the Lower East Side, San Juan Hill, and Spanish Harlem, creating a new identity, culture, and way of life.

With the formation of neighborhoods and culture, arose a Latin American gem formerly the P.S. 64 school building. The building was renamed Charas/El Bohio Community Center, repurposed, and appropriated into Puerto Rican immigrant life. CHARAS/El Bohio was a cultural center established in 1977. The center was built with the intention of revitalizing Loisaida, to encourage Latino pride and community action, to preserve the neighborhood and protect those still living there. The building, formerly PS 64, was abandoned by the Department of Education and taken over and remodeled by Adopt-A-Building. Much of the funding to renovate the building was provided by federal grants or directly from the City. CHARAS moved into the building shortly after, followed by the El Bohio Corporation. CHARAS was the continuation of the Real Great Society, and was spearheaded by Chino Garcia and Armando Pérez.

Chino Garcia and Armando Pérez were and are two of many founders and collaborators of CHARA/ El Bohio Community Center. More importantly they helped form many artists in the 1960s. They renovated classrooms into art studios and rehearsal rooms. This influenced the demographic of the Lower East Side profusely. The original organization was built in 1964 with the intention of helping youth gang members use their skills and ideals for positive use by encouraging business development and educational programs. CHARAS was also involved actively in urban ecology, developing many of the LES community gardens. El Bohio was more artistically based, hosting cultural performances and providing a space for Latino artists to showcase their work and celebrate Latino culture through the arts.

=== Conflicts and controversies ===
Despite massive community efforts to save the building, CHARAS/El Bohio faced numerous obstacles presented by Mayor Giuliani and Councilmember Antonio Pagán, which ultimately led to their losing of the building in the late 1990s to Gregg Singer, a developer who has been attempting to demolish the building and build high rise dorms for nearly 20 years. His efforts have been repeatedly halted by CB3, who made the building a NYC landmark shortly after he began to destroy moldings of almost a hundred years of age. The landmarking of PS 64 was an immediate reaction to the beginning of Singer&#x27;s process of demolishing the building. The involvement of CB3 is especially significant, as the board grew involved after a number of Latin Kings went to them pleading for assistance in saving the building. The two groups formed an unlikely alliance in an attempt to preserve the space, and were together successful in saving it as a historic landmark, thus halting Singer&#x27;s attempts at demolition and reconstruction. PS 64 was home to a number of different organizations. Besides CHARAS (formerly the Real Great Society) and El Bohio, the building was also occupied by artists and activists who rented out studio space, an art gallery, numerous art programs and afterschool programs for students, and other artistic programs and organizations centered around music, dance, and theater. Many of the activists and artists involved in the creation and preservation of the cultural space were former or active gang members, specifically members of the Latin Kings and Queens, looking to work within their communities and foster positive change. In April 1999, CHARAS cofounder Armando Perez was found murdered outside his wife&#x27;s home in Queens a death which many presume was gang related, though there was no evidence found to corroborate this theory. At the time of his death, Perez had been deeply involved in the fight to save PS 64 from Gregg Singer.

=== Present day ===
In 2017, Mayor de Blasio announced that he would be buying back PS 64 from Singer, and making efforts to revert the building back to a community center. The likelihood of this occurring was immediately shot down by Singer, who made a statement following Mayor de Blasio&#x27;s claiming he had no intention to sell the building. How Mayor de Blasio will respond is not yet known. Though perhaps one of the more powerful political leaders, he was not the first to make public attempts to retrieve the building. Councilwoman Rosie Mendez has shown open opposition to Singer during her time as councilwoman, an attitude which is held by current city councilwoman Carlina Rivera. When Rivera&#x27;s campaign was endorsed by the Villager, the author of the endorsement article discussed seeing Rivera as a teenager at a protest to save the community center when it was first lost. She has been a continuous threat to Singer since. During Rivera&#x27;s campaign, Singer distributed literature around the Lower East Side promoting three of Rivera&#x27;s rival candidates, encouraging the community to vote for any candidate besides Rivera. Despite his efforts, he must now attempt to work with Rivera, as she poses one of his greatest obstacles. Although Singer originally proposed a demolition of the building and the development of a twenty-story dorm building, his proposals have continuously been rejected by Community Board 2, as the demolition of the building coincides with the policies for construction on a landmarked building. A more recent proposal produced by Singer shows the building in its original form, remodeled only slightly, but still acting as a dorm building for college students. As of November 2017, community activists were advocating the city Department of Buildings to void the original sale of the building to Singer and to reacquire the building 

==Literature and poetry==

The Nuyorican movement significantly influenced Puerto Rican literature, spurring themes such as cultural identity, civil rights, and discrimination. The Nuyorican Poets Café, a non-profit organization in Alphabet City, Manhattan, founded by Miguel Piñero, Miguel Algarín, and Pedro Pietri. Prominent figures include poets Giannina Braschi, Willie Perdomo, Edwin Torres (poet), Nancy Mercado, and Sandra María Esteves. Later voices include Lemon Andersen, Emanuel Xavier, Mariposa (María Teresa Fernández), Bonafide Rojas and Caridad de la Luz (La Bruja), as well as non-Latino poets including Dael Orlandersmith, Paul Beatty, Carl Hancock Rux Cheryl Boyce Taylor
and Saul Williams. Current organizations include The Acentos Foundation originally based in the Bronx, New York City which publishes poetry, fiction, memoir, interviews, translations, and artwork by emerging and established Latino/a writers and artists four times a year through The Acentos Review, and Capicu Cultural Showcase based in Brooklyn, New York City.

==Music==
Nuyorican music became popular in the 1960s with the recordings of Tito Puente&#x27;s &quot;Oye Como Va&quot; and Ray Barretto&#x27;s &quot;El Watusi&quot; and incorporated Spanglish lyrics.

Latin bands who had formerly played the imported styles of cha-cha-cha or charanga began to develop their own unique Nuyorican music style by adding flutes and violins to their orchestras. This new style came to be known as the Latin boogaloo. Some of the musicians who helped develop this unique music were Joe Cuba with &quot;Bang Bang&quot;, Richie Ray and Bobby Cruz with &quot;Mr. Trumpet Man&quot;, and the brothers Charlie and Eddie Palmieri. Subsequently, Nuyorican music has evolved into Latin rap, freestyle music,
Latin house, salsa, Nuyorican soul and reggaeton.

The development of the Nuyorican music can be seen in salsa and hip hop music. Musician and singer Willie Colón shows this diaspora in his salsa music by blending the sounds of the trombone, an instrument popular in the New York urban scene, and the cuatro, an instrument native to Puerto Rico and prevalent in salsa music. Furthermore, many salsa songs address this diaspora and relationship between the homeland, in this case, Puerto Rico and the migrant community, New York City. Some see the positives and negatives in this exchange, but often the homeland questions the cultural authenticity of the migrants. In salsa music, the same occurs. The Puerto Ricans question the validity and authenticity of the music. Today, salsa music has expanded to incorporate the sounds of Africa, Cuba, and other Latin American countries, creating more of a salsa fusion. In addition, with the second and third generations of Nuyoricans, the new debated and diasporic sound is hip hop. With hip hop, Nuyoricans gave back to Puerto Rico with rappers like Vico C and Big Pun, who created music that people in both New York and Puerto Rico could relate to and identify with. Other notable Puerto Ricans who made contributions to hip-hop were DJ Disco Wiz, Prince Whipper Whip, DJ Charlie Chase, Tony Touch, DJ Johnny &quot;Juice&quot; Rosado (Public Enemy/producer), Tego Calderon, Fat Joe, Jim Jones, N.O.R.E., Joell Ortiz, and Lloyd Banks. Currently, groups like Circa &#x27;95 (PattyDukes &amp; RephStar) are continuing the traditions as torchbearers of the Nuyorican hip hop movement. Thus the musical relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico has become a circular exchange and blended fusion, as embodied in the name Nuyorican.

==Playwrights and theater companies==
Spanish-language Puerto Rican writers such as René Marqués who wrote about the immigrant experience can be considered as antecedents of Nuyorican movement. Marqués&#x27;s best-known play &quot;The Oxcart&quot; (&quot;La Carreta&quot;) traces the life of a Puerto Rican family who moved from the countryside to San Juan and then to New York, only to realize that they would rather live a poor life in Puerto Rico than face discrimination in the United States. Puerto Rican actress Míriam Colón founded The Puerto Rican Traveling Theatre in 1967 precisely after a successful run of &quot;The Oxcart.&quot; Her company gives young actors the opportunity to participate in its productions. Some of PRTT&#x27;s productions, such as Edward Gallardo&#x27;s &quot;Simpson Street&quot; concern life in a New York&#x27;s ghettos. Other theater companies include Pregones Theater, established in 1979 in the Bronx and currently directed by Rosalba Rolón, Alvan Colón-Lespier, and Jorge Merced.

Playwrights who pioneered the Nuyorican movement include Pedro Pietri, Miguel Piñero, Giannina Braschi, Jesús Papoleto Meléndez, and Tato Laviera. Piñero is the acclaimed playwright with &quot;Short Eyes&quot;, a drama about prison life which received a Tony Award nomination and won an Obie Award. Candido Tirado and Carmen Rivera, Obie Award-winner for her play La Gringa; and Judge Edwin Torres wrote &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot;.

Currently, spaces such as B.A.A.D. (the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance), established in 1998 by the dancer and choreographer Arthur Aviles and the writer Charles Rice-González in the Hunts Point neighborhood of the Bronx, provide numerous Nuyorican, Latina/o, and queer of color artists and writers with a space to present and develop their work. Other theater groups use the theaters at the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center in Loisaida for their events.

==Visual arts==
The Nuyorican movement has always included a strong visual arts component, including arts education. Raphael Montañez Ortiz, an important conceptual artist and activist, established El Museo del Barrio in 1969 as a way to promote Nuyorican art. Painters and print makers such as Rafael Tufiño, Fernando Salicrup, Marcos Dimas, and Nitza Tufiño established organizations such as Taller Boricua as a way of centering Puerto Rican artistic traditions. In photography, the group En Foco was instrumental in showcasing a distinctly Puerto Rican view of life in the U.S. and the island.

The 1970s and &#x27;80s were a key period for the rise of Nuyorican art. Graffiti-inspired artists such as Jean-Michel Basquiat and Al Diaz achieved great recognition for their work. Installationists Antonio Martorell and Pepon Osorio created environments that brought together traditional aesthetic practices with political and social concerns. Also significant was painter Juan Sánchez (b. 1954), who produced a body of work that acknowledged global struggle while remaining rooted in the Puerto Rican/Nuyorican experience. His paintings and prints are held in the collections of museums such as El Museo del Barrio, the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

The era saw collaborations across cultural genres. Writers and poets such as Sandra María Esteves and Nicholasa Mohr alternated and complemented their prose and lyrical compositions with visual images on paper. At other times, experimental artists such as Adál Maldonado (also known as Adál) collaborated with poets such as Pedro Pietri. During this time, the gay Chinese American painter Martin Wong collaborated with his lover, Miguel Piñero; one of their collaborations is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 

A newer generation of artists has likewise continued to explore Puerto Rican themes in their work. Among them are painters, muralists and conceptual artists such as James De La Vega, Jorge Zeno, Miguel Luciano, Miguelangel Ruiz, Sofia Maldonado and Soraida Martinez. Gallerists, curators, and museum directors such as Marvette Pérez, Yasmin Ramírez, Deborah Cullen, Susana Torruella Leval, Judith Escalona, Tanya Torres, and Chino Garcia have helped Puerto Rican and Nuyorican art gain recognition.

==In popular culture==
* The life of Nuyorcan movement poet Miguel Piñero was portrayed in the 2001 Hollywood production &quot;Piñero&quot;, directed by Leon Ichaso and starring Benjamin Bratt in the title role. In the film, Piñero&#x27;s love life, with both men and women, is depicted, including with his protégé Reinaldo Povod. The relationships are secondary to the life of the writer as an individual, as the movie shows a non-chronological portrayal of Piñero&#x27;s development as both a poet and a person. The movie blends visual and audio segments shot in short, music/slam poetry videos with typical movie narratives to show Piñero&#x27;s poetics in action.

<text>James Glen Cummings (born April 12, 1944) is a farmer and former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 2007, and was as a cabinet minister in the government of Gary Filmon.

The son of James William Cummings and Lillian Grace McDonald, he was born in Neepawa, Manitoba, and was educated at Neepawa Area College. Before entering provincial politics, he was a school board chair and trustee in the Beautiful Plains School Division, and worked as a farmer. He also sat on the executive of the &quot;Beautiful Plains Agricultural Society&quot; for twelve years. In 1969, he married Heather Lynne Harvey.

In the provincial election of 1986, Cummings was elected as a Progressive Conservative in the rural riding of Ste. Rose, defeating New Democrat Gary Anderson by 3735 votes to 3020. The NDP won the election, and Cummings became a member of the parliamentary opposition.

The Progressive Conservatives won the provincial election of 1988, and Cummings was re-elected in Ste. Rose by an increased margin (with the Liberals overtaking the NDP for second place). When Gary Filmon was sworn in as Manitoba&#x27;s Premier on May 9, 1988, Cummings became Deputy Premier and Minister of Municipal Affairs with responsibility for administration of the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation Act and the Jobs Fund Act. On April 21, 1989, he was shifted out of Municipal Affairs and was made Minister of the Environment, while retaining his other positions.

Cummings was easily re-elected in the provincial election of 1990, in which the Progressive Conservatives won a majority of seats. He was removed as Deputy Premier on February 5, 1991, while retaining his other positions. In the provincial election of 1995, he defeated NDP candidate John Morrisseau by 3762 votes to 2341.

Following a cabinet shuffle on January 6, 1997, Cummings was made Minister of Natural Resources, with responsibility for the Natural Resources Development Act. He retained this position until 1999, when Filmon&#x27;s Tories were defeated by the NDP under Gary Doer in a provincial election.

Cummings retained his own seat in the 1999 election, defeating NDP candidate Louise Wilson by 3871 votes to 3293. He returned to the opposition benches, and served as his party&#x27;s family services critic. In 2002, he called for a financial bailout of the Manitoba Métis fishing industry.

In the 2003 election, he defeated NDP candidate John Harapiak by over 1400 votes, despite the poor showing of the Progressive Conservative party elsewhere in the province. In the buildup to this election, Cummings was a leading proponent of the PC party&#x27;s plan to remove education taxes from residences and farmland. He remains a leading voice in the party&#x27;s parliamentary caucus.

In 2004, Cummings endorsed Steven Fletcher for election to the federal House of Commons. He did not run for re-election in 2007.

<text>Peter David Shore, Baron Shore of Stepney, (20 May 1924 – 24 September 2001) was a British Labour Party politician and Cabinet minister, noted in part for his opposition to the United Kingdom&#x27;s entry into the European Economic Community. He served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for over 30 years, from 1964 to 1997.

His idiosyncratic left-wing nationalism led to comparison with the French politician Jean-Pierre Chevènement. He was described in an obituary by the Conservative journalist Patrick Cosgrave as &quot;Between Harold Wilson and Tony Blair, the only possible Labour Party leader of whom a Conservative leader had cause to walk in fear&quot; and, along with Enoch Powell, &quot;the most captivating rhetorician of the age&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, Shore was the son of a Merchant Navy captain and was brought up in a middle-class environment. He attended Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool and, from there, went to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, to read History as an exhibitioner, where he was a member of the Cambridge Apostles, a secret society with an elite membership. During the later stages of World War II he served in the Royal Air Force, spending most of his time in India.

==Political career==
He had specialised in political economy during part of his degree and joined the Labour Party in 1948. He spent the 1950s working for the party and, after two unsuccessful Parliamentary contests at St Ives in 1950 and Halifax in 1959, he was appointed as Head of the Labour Party&#x27;s Research Department and took charge of the renewal of party policy following its third successive defeat in 1959. Shore was only briefly a follower of Hugh Gaitskell; his adherence to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament from 1958 led to a breach in relations for several years.

He became close to Harold Wilson after Wilson had been elected as party leader, and was the main author of the Labour Party manifesto for the 1964 general election. At the last minute, he was selected to fight for the safe seat of Stepney in the election, which he easily won.

After only a short spell on the backbenches, Wilson chose Shore to be Parliamentary Private Secretary, responsible for liaising between the Prime Minister and Labour MPs, though Denis Healey termed him &quot;Harold&#x27;s lapdog&quot;. Shore was responsible for drafting the 1966 and 1970 election manifestos. Shore&#x27;s job as Wilson&#x27;s PPS kept them in close contact and in August 1967, Shore became a member of the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.

===In government===
This Department had been created by Wilson to undertake long-term planning of the economy. Shore declared immediately his belief in state-controlled economic planning, together with the regulation of prices and wages. Early in 1968, the responsibility for prices and incomes was transferred to another department. The Treasury had never approved of the creation of the Department for Economic Affairs and began reasserting its influence, depriving it of any significant power. The department was wound up in October 1969. At the same time, Shore sided with those in cabinet who were opposed to Barbara Castle&#x27;s White Paper, &quot;In Place of Strife&quot;. In a conversation with Richard Crossman at the time, Wilson was frustrated with Shore: &quot;I over-promoted him. He&#x27;s no good&quot;.

Shore was retained in the Cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio and Deputy Leader of the House of Commons. He played a key part, behind the scenes, in planning the Labour Party&#x27;s unsuccessful 1970 general election campaign. In opposition, Shore was appointed as spokesman on Europe, taking the lead in opposing Edward Heath&#x27;s application to join the European Economic Community. Shore had already become convinced that membership of the EEC would be a disaster because it would stop the British government from taking necessary economic action. However, due to organisation by pro-EEC Labour backbenchers, Heath was able to steer his policy successfully through Parliament.

===EEC===
When Wilson returned to government in 1974, Shore was appointed as Secretary of State for Trade. His term in office was dominated by the renegotiation of the terms of British membership of the EEC, a pledge contained in the Labour manifesto as a preparation for a national referendum on membership; this compromise had reunited the Labour Party on the issue. Shore participated in the discussions without believing that any new terms would be acceptable, and during the referendum, he joined with other anti-EEC politicians in opposing membership.

The results of the 1975 Referendum, giving a two-to-one majority in favour of remaining a member of the EEC, damaged Shore along with the other &#x27;dissenting ministers&#x27;. His inclination to support an autarkic economy ruled him out of consideration as a new Chancellor of the Exchequer, but Shore was moved to Secretary of State for the Environment by new Prime Minister James Callaghan in 1976. This move was a promotion but involved him in considerable political controversy. He called on local authorities to cut spending and waste, and criticised the trade unions representing local authority staff for failure to support modernisation. Shore also launched a campaign to revitalise the inner cities of Britain.

===Nuclear deterrent===
Shore became a fervent advocate of the British nuclear deterrent for the last three decades of his life, but in 1958 he had been an active member of CND. In his 1966 book &quot;Entitled to Know&quot;, he was critical of the Nassau Agreement with the United States under which Britain&#x27;s nuclear submarines were, except in a national emergency, permanently assigned to NATO. Regarding dependence on NATO as limiting Britain&#x27;s freedom of action, Shore negatively compared Britain&#x27;s nuclear strategy to that of France:

Shore had always been implacably opposed to any suggestion of British participation in the Vietnam War, both as PPS and in Cabinet he had encouraged Wilson to distance himself more explicitly from American foreign policy. By the mid-1970s, while continuing to condemn American foreign policy in Vietnam and Chile, he had become more supportive of NATO and the United States.

===Labour leadership candidate===
When the Labour Party went into opposition in 1979, Shore was made Shadow Foreign Secretary, having recanted on his previous support for CND. He was persuaded to stand as a candidate in the election of a new party leader in November 1980 by Michael Foot, who thought he was the best-placed soft-left candidate to defeat Denis Healey. &quot;The Times&quot; branded him the initial favourite. However, Shore came bottom of the poll with 32 votes when Foot was himself persuaded to stand. Foot then made him Shadow Chancellor where his support for interventionist measures met with Foot&#x27;s approval; party policy also became opposed to EEC membership, which suited Shore well. In the early 1980s, Shore&#x27;s patriotic tendencies were again evident when he first of all strongly opposed the Conservative Government&#x27;s attempts to hand over the Falkland Islands to Argentina, then supported Margaret Thatcher over the Falklands War of 1982.

===Shadow Cabinet===
He fought for the leadership again after Foot resigned, but obtained a dismal vote of 3%, being unsupported by any Constituency Labour Party. Shore served as Shadow Leader of the House of Commons for four years under Neil Kinnock but his influence with the leadership was negligible and he was not re-elected to the Shadow cabinet in 1985. He stood down from the front bench in 1987 and thereafter served on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, devoting himself to European Union questions. Edward Pearce wrote in his &quot;Guardian&quot; obituary of Shore that &quot;he had now become a right-wing figure, cluckingly approved of by Conservatives&quot;.

Tony Blair selected him as a senior Labour statesman as his nominee for the Committee on Standards in Public Life when it was set up in 1994.

===Backbenches, retirement and death===
After several attempts in his constituency party to deselect him, he finally stood down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, and in the dissolution honours he was made a life peer, being created Baron Shore of Stepney, of Stepney in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets on 5 June 1997. 

In contrast to Pearce&#x27;s assertion that Shore had become a &quot;right-wing figure&quot;, Chris Mullin quoted Shore in 1997 as saying: &quot;I still believe in state intervention, a good measure of equality, full employment.&quot; Mullin described Shore as alienated from New Labour and quoted his criticism: &quot;I like Tony Blair. I think he is probably right about wanting to put a certain distance between the party and the unions, but I&#x27;m offended by New Labour&#x27;s constant repudiation of our past.&quot;

His book &quot;Separate Ways&quot; (2000) advocated a multi-speed Europe, with some countries as merely associate members, so as to allow the centre to forge a political union at its own pace.

== Personal life and death ==
On 27 September 1948, Shore married Dr Elizabeth Catherine Wrong, daughter of the Canadian historian Edward Murray Wrong. Known as Liz, she was the Deputy Chief Medical Officer of England from 1977 to 1985, and in this role and later positions she championed women&#x27;s career progression in medicine. They had two daughters, Thomasina and Tacy, both retired teachers, and two sons, Crispin, who is Professor of Social Anthropology at Goldsmiths, University of London, and Piers, who died in 1977.

On 12 July 2001, Lord Shore collapsed in the House of Lords shortly after speaking in a debate on monetary policy. He received resuscitation and was taken to St Thomas&#x27; Hospital. He died there from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease on 24 September 2001, aged 77.

<text>Tape is a 2001 American camcorder drama film directed by Richard Linklater and written by Stephen Belber, based on his play of the same name. It stars Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Uma Thurman. The entire film takes place in real time.

==Plot==
The entire film is set inside a Lansing, Michigan motel room. Vince, a drug dealer and volunteer firefighter who lives in Oakland, California, rents the room in his hometown to support his old high school friend&#x27;s entry into the Lansing Film Festival.

His friend, documentary filmmaker Jon Salter, joins Vince in his motel room and the two reminisce about their high school years. At first, the two are happy to see one another, but friction soon develops. Eventually, they get on the subject of Amy, Vince&#x27;s former girlfriend. It appears that, while they dated for some time, Vince and Amy never had sex. However, after or at the point when their relationship had ended, Amy slept with Jon.

Vince claims Amy had told him that Jon had raped her. Vince becomes obsessed with, and eventually succeeds in getting a verbal confession from Jon. Immediately after Jon&#x27;s admission, Vince pulls out a hidden tape recorder that had been recording their whole conversation, much to Jon&#x27;s horror. Vince then tells Jon that he has invited Amy to dinner, and that she will be arriving shortly.

Amy does arrive and, even though all three of them feel awkward, they begin to talk. Amy explains that she is now an assistant district attorney in the Lansing Justice Department. Eventually, the three discuss what actually happened between Jon and Amy that night at the party, 10 years in the past.

Jon asks Amy&#x27;s forgiveness for raping her, but Amy claims that the encounter was consensual, leading Jon to believe that she is in denial or is toying with him. After Jon becomes annoyed that Amy is refusing to accept his apology, Amy calls the police. She asks for a squad car to pick up one person in possession of drugs (Vince), and one for “sexual misconduct” (Jon). After concluding her phone call, Amy warns the men that they only have about four minutes to make a run for it.

In order to prove to Amy that he is truly remorseful, Jon decides to stay and wait for the police. Vince, realizing that there is nowhere for him to run, flushes his narcotics down the toilet and destroys the tape containing Jon&#x27;s confession. Soon after, Amy reveals that she didn&#x27;t really call the police and leaves.

==Cast==
* Ethan Hawke as Vince
* Robert Sean Leonard as Jon Salter
* Uma Thurman as Amy Randall

==Critical reception==
The reviews of the film have been generally favorable; it currently holds a 77% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 100 collected reviews, the critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Tape&quot;&#x27;s stagebound feel is balanced by the engrossing psychodrama of its storyline, which allows a committed cast to shine.&quot; It has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100 on Metacritic.

Film critic Roger Ebert said &quot;&quot;Tape&quot; made me believe that its events could happen to real people more or less as they appear on the screen, and that is its most difficult accomplishment&quot; and gave this film three and a half out of four stars, concluding that &quot;for audiences they are stimulating; for other filmmakers, instruction manuals about how to use the tricky new tools.&quot;

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;incisive&quot; and praised the cast for giving &quot;the most psychologically acute performances of their film careers&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A- and wrote &quot;in &quot;Tape&quot;, Ethan Hawke releases his inner actor, and it&#x27;s a kick to see.&quot;

<text>The Dominican Revolutionary Party (, PRD) is a political party in the Dominican Republic. Traditionally a left-of-centre party and social democratic in nature, the party has shifted since the 2000s toward the political centre. The party&#x27;s distinctive color is white. Traditionally, the party has two presidents: the &quot;Titular President&quot; and the &quot;Acting President&quot; (and actually, a sort of Vice-President); until 2010 the presidents and the Secretary-General were proscribed to run for any elected office.

The party was founded in 1939 by several Dominican expatriated exiles living in Havana, Cuba, led by Juan Bosch. It was then established in the Dominican Republic on 5 July 1961. It was the first Dominican party based on populist and democratic leftist principles and an organization based on mass membership. Bosch was elected president in 1962 in what is generally believed to be the first honest election in the country&#x27;s history. Bosch later left the party in a dispute over its ideological direction and founded the Dominican Liberation Party on 16 December 1973.

The PRD has won the presidency three other times—in 1978 (Antonio Guzmán), 1982 (Salvador Jorge Blanco) and 2000 (Hipólito Mejía).

At the legislative elections, on 16 May 2002, the party won 41.9% of the popular vote and 73 out of 150 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 29 out of 31 seats in the Senate of the Dominican Republic. Its candidate at the presidential election on 16 May 2004, Hipólito Mejía, won 33.6% of the votes, failing to win a second term.

In the 16 May 2006 legislative elections, the party formed together with its traditional opponent, the Social Christian Reformist Party, and others the Grand National Alliance, that won 82 out of 178 deputies and 10 out of 32 senators. The Dominican Revolutionary Party led the alliance, however, winning about 60 seats in the chamber of deputies and 6 in the Senate.

The party has been criticized for involvement in corruption, allowing right-wing paramilitary groups to operate from its soil for attacks launched into Haiti, and for becoming an increasingly conservative party serving the interests of transnational capital over the poor majority. The last PRD president, Hipólito Mejía, has been especially criticized for supporting the Iraq War.

<doc id="980612" wikidata="Q1269399" url="?curid=980612" title="Dysuria">
<text>Dysuria refers to painful or uncomfortable urination.

It is one of a constellation of &quot;irritative&quot; bladder symptoms (also sometimes referred to as lower urinary tract symptoms), which includes nocturia and urinary frequency.

==Diagnosis==
The clinician should also look for physical findings of fever, rash, direct tenderness over the bladder area, and joint pain. Physical findings of increased temperature, increased pulse, low blood pressure in the presence of dysuria can indicate systemic infection. Urological obstruction due to stone or tumor can result in findings of hematuria, decreased urination, and bladder spasms. All these physical findings should be looked for carefully while obtaining history. History regarding recent sexual activity is crucial.

Urinalysis is the most useful test to start the work up in a patient of dysuria. Urinalysis positive for nitrite carries a high predictive value of a positive urine culture. Also, urine dipstick showing leukocytes as equal predictive value as the presence of nitrites. When both are present, the predictive value goes even higher. If the patient only has leukocyte esterase or bacteria in the urine, then dysuria may suggest that the patient probably has urethritis.

==Differential diagnosis==
This is typically described to be a burning or stinging sensation. It is most often a result of a urinary tract infection. It may also be due to an STD, bladder stones, bladder tumors, and virtually any condition of the prostate. It can also occur as a side effect of anticholinergic medication used for Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

===Drugs and irritants===
* Chemical irritants, e.g., soaps, tampons, toilet papers
* Drugs, e.g., Cyclophosphamide, Ketamine
* Capsaicin consumption, e.g., habanero peppers

===Genital===
* Benign prostatic hyperplasia (male)
* Endometriosis (female)
* Prostatic cancer (male)
* Prostatitis (male)
* Vaginitis (female)

===Urinary tract===
One of the most common causes of dysuria is urinary tract infection. Urinary tract infections are more common in females than in males due to anatomical differences between them. Females have a comparatively shorter and straight urethra, whereas males have a longer and curved urethra. In females, bacteria can reach the bladder more easily, as they have less distance to travel. Most urinary tract infections are uncomplicated.
* Chlamydia
* Cystitis
* Hemorrhagic cystitis
* Kidney stones
* Malignancy, i.e., bladder cancer, prostatic cancer, or urethral cancer
* Prostatic enlargement, i.e., benign prostatic hyperplasia (male), prostatic cancer
* Prostatitis (male)
* Pyelonephritis
* Sexually transmitted disease
* Trichomoniasis
* Urethral stricture
* Urethritis
* Urinary schistosomiasis
* Urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by bacterial infection

===Other===
* Diverticulitis
* Hypotension
* Mass in the abdomen
* Reactive arthritis
* Acute intermittent porphyria
* Hereditary coproporphyria
* Variegate porphyria

<doc id="980624" wikidata="Q3021544" url="?curid=980624" title="Northern root-knot nematode">
<text>Northern root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne hapla) is a species of vegetable pathogens which produces tiny galls on around 550 crop and weed species. They invade root tissue after birth. Females are able to lay up to 1,000 eggs at a time in a large egg mass. By surviving harsh winters, they can survive in cold climates (hence, the name, Northern).

== Hosts and symptoms ==
&quot;Meloidogyne hapla&quot; (Northern root-knot nematode) has a wide host range. It is polyphagous and affects over 550 crops and weeds. It feeds on many agricultural and horticultural plants (vegetables, fruits, ornamentals), but few grasses or cereals. A list of known hosts can be found at the bottom of this page.

Symptoms can be seen in the roots, leaves, and the overall growth of the infected plant. In roots, there may be stunting, wilting, and the formation of abnormal growths called galls. Galls are usually small and spherical and are situated near many small roots. They are formed when the nematode enters the root and releases chemicals to enlarge root cells, on which they feed. The roots become defective and therefore cannot transport water and nutrients properly. The end result is stunted, wilted, and yellowing plants (characteristic of nutrient deficiency) and a decreased yield. Severity of the symptoms depends on nematode population density and host plant species and cultivar. As the number of nematodes increase in the area, the number and size of root galls increase as well. Each crop responds to &quot;Meloidogyne hapla&quot; differently. Carrots typically undergo severe forking with galling of the roots, lettuce have beadlike galls, and grasses and onions have small and barely noticeable galls and symptoms. In potato tubers (special stems), brown spots will appear on areas of the tubers where the females have laid their eggs.

If a field has a patchy distribution of symptoms, it usually indicates the presence of nematodes. Most nematodes are not usually distributed uniformly in the soil. To correctly identify &quot;Meloidogyne hapla&quot;, the infected plant should be sent to a lab for a proper diagnosis. One common method is perineal pattern analysis where the perineum of the female nematode (area between the anus and the vulva) is examined for a specific pattern in ridges and annulations. Another common method is analyzing isozyme (different variations of the same enzyme produced by different genes) electrophoretic profiles using esterase and malate dehydrogenase.

== Disease cycle ==
Northern root-knot nematodes go through six stages in their life cycle (egg stage, four juvenile stages, and then adulthood). They first survive the winter as eggs in the soil. The first juvenile stage occurs while in the egg. When the eggs hatch—usually when the soil temperature is 18 °C—the nematode is in its second juvenile stage, and will start to find, enter, and infect plant roots. The males are able to move freely and leave the root after they become adults, while the females stay sedentary and feed on cells next to the vascular system&quot;.&quot; Eventually, the females grow to the point where a portion of their bodies pop out of the root surface so that pearly white bodies can be seen. They then start laying thousands of eggs in egg masses outside the root. The life cycle takes about three to four weeks and therefore the population can grow very fast&quot;.&quot;

Depending on the host and the soil temperature, the life cycle of &quot;Meloidogyne hapla&quot; can be between 17 and 57 days. Nematodes in cooler regions usually have longer life cycles. Eggs may remain inside root tissue or may be released into the soil matrix and survive for up to one year.

== Management ==
&quot;Meloidogyne hapla&quot; are one of the most destructive nematodes in agriculture. They are difficult to control due to their wide host range and high rate of reproduction. However, using a combination of control practices, known as integrated pest management plant (IPM), has been proven to be effective. Depending on the control method being utilized, different parts of the root-knot nematode disease cycle is disturbed.

=== Cultural control ===
Before planting, one method of control is to leave the land fallow (empty for a duration), soil kept bare, cultivated, and weed controlled for 4–6 months to expose the nematodes to the sun to dry and starve to death. Another control that can be done before the planting season is the use of cover crops such as sudangrass and marigolds which produce chemicals toxic to nematodes. They also stabilize topsoil and improve soil quality which in turn increases microbial competition in the soil. Rotation of nonhost crops (grasses, corn, barley, wheat, oat, rye, asparagus, onions) can also reduce nematode populations.

During growth, soil amendments and maintenance are very important. Adding manure, compost, and organic matter improves soil quality to again increase microbial competition as well as allow the plants to grow stronger and be able to withstand nematode infestation. Controlling weeds can prevent additional hosts. At harvest, if there are infected plants, they should be destroyed and not composted to prevent further contamination.

After harvest, the collecting of crop remains should be destroyed, and soil should never be moved.

=== Chemical control ===
A wide range of chemicals have been used to control &quot;Meloidogyne hapla.&quot; This includes both fumigants (methyl bromide, metham sodium, chloropiocrin), and liquids and granules (fenamiphos, oxamyl, furadan). However, many of these are overly toxic and are now restricted or banned.

=== Organic control products ===
There are several OMRI (Organic Materials Reviews Institute) products in the market, but none show any significant effectiveness against Northern root-knot nematodes.

=== Biofumigation ===
Some species of the plant genus &quot;Brassica&quot; can be used as effective biofumigants against the Northern root-knot nematode, however, they can interfere with the effectiveness of biological controls within the IPM.

=== Biological control ===
&quot;Meloidogyne hapla&quot; can be controlled using their natural enemies. Common biological controls of nematodes are fungi and bacteria. Some fungi use mycelial traps or sticky spores to catch nematodes while other fungi parasitize eggs and females. Bacteria consume juvenile nematodes by attaching and penetrating the cuticle.

=== Resistant varieties ===
There are no known resistant varieties as of now.

<text>Meeting for Sufferings is an executive committee of Britain Yearly Meeting, the body which acts on behalf of members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Great Britain and the Crown Dependencies. It has about 200 members who meet five times a year to make decisions when the Yearly Meeting is not in session.

== History ==

Meeting for Sufferings was originally established to assess the persecution of Friends and attempt to obtain redress. Morning Meeting, a now-obsolete body of London Quakers, agreed in October 1675 to commission certain local Friends to meet four times a year for this purpose. Their efforts were mainly directed towards the suffering of imprisoned Quakers, but they also lobbied Parliament to reduce the burden of tithes and oaths. (The refusal of Friends to take oaths, based on Jesus Christ&#x27;s words &quot;Swear not at all&quot; (Matthew 5:33 – 37), caused great difficulties with the government and courts.) Smaller weekly meetings, which continued until 1798, helped to push this process forward.

In the eighteenth century, the Meeting began to broaden its interests, campaigning against the slave trade; a Slave Trade Committee between 1783 and 1792 helped prepare the way for the Slave Trade Act 1807. Other legislative successes included the Affirmation Acts, which allowed Quakers to avoid oath-taking; however, attempts to put forward a &quot;Quakers Tithes Bill&quot; were fruitless.

The beginning of the nineteenth century saw a renewed interest in contact with other Quaker groups around the world, especially in continental Europe, Calcutta, and southern Africa. Even so, Meeting for Sufferings remained a London-based body until the expansion of the railways allowed Quakers from more remote parts of the country to participate. The larger membership meant that even more subcommittees could form, covering administration, libraries, and printing; and lobbying against gambling, opium and war.

It was not until 1898 that women were allowed to join the Meeting. Although the Society of Friends was egalitarian in many other respects, the participation of women in &quot;meetings for business&quot; - as opposed to &quot;meetings for worship&quot; - had been contentious since its beginning. Founder George Fox&#x27;s model was a middle way between exclusion and total inclusion: men and women were to have separate meetings for business, communicating by the passing of messages. The perceived benefit of this system was that it made it easier for wives to have different opinions from their husbands. When as in London the male membership was unusually wealthy and powerful, female interests often went unheard. (All meetings now have mixed membership.)

During the twentieth century, Meeting for Sufferings absorbed various other powerful bodies, including the old Morning Meeting in 1901. It came under the direct authority of the Yearly Meeting as part of a process of normalisation of Quaker institutions. The subcommittees of the two Meetings merged, and in 1965 Meeting for Sufferings was given the role of appointing their members. In return, it had to become more representative, drawing its membership directly from the monthly meetings (the basic unit of Quaker organisation) rather than quarterly meetings (larger assemblies of several monthly meetings).

Meeting for Sufferings is subordinate to Yearly Meeting, which ratifies its minutes and has overall constitutional authority.

== Structure ==

Most members are appointed by Yearly Meeting, based on nominations put forward by each monthly meeting or by Meeting for Suffering&#x27;s own standing committees. It may also co-opt a few members on its own initiative. Members normally serve a three-year term. The table below shows the role of the relevant committees that provide members, as of 1999.

Various officers of Yearly Meeting, and staff employed by Meeting for Sufferings, also attend.

== Meeting for Sufferings Committee ==

A special subcommittee recommends policies and budgets for the main Meeting, including the Yearly Meeting budget. It also carries out oversight of Meeting for Sufferings on behalf of Yearly Meeting.

It has twelve members, all drawn from Meeting for Sufferings; each year, four are replaced. No member may serve for more than two terms (six years).

== Changes in the early 21st century==
Britain Yearly Meeting implemented a number of constitutional changes in 2006. Among these was the appointment of a small body of Trustees, who took over some of the functions of Meeting for Sufferings in January 2007.

Since this time, the work of the meeting is five-fold;
* Being a worshipping community
* Receiving information from other parts of Britain Yearly Meeting
* Making decisions
* Helping other parts of Britain Yearly Meeting
* Informing Friends about its work

<text>Jīvaka (also referred to as Jiva) was a sister of a king of Kucha, and later a Buddhist nun.

Jīvaka was a princess of Kucha (in Central Asia) in the early fourth century C.E. She was the sister of the King who introduced her to Kumārāyana, a noble Kashmiri who came from Kashmir to China to study further. After two or three years they returned to Kashgar, renounced his fortune to become a Buddhist monk and thus stopped in Kucha on his journey. However, after meeting Jīvaka, Kumārāyana and she were married. 
Jīvaka is said to have possessed great talent and keen perception and understanding. According to the &quot;Collection of Records concerning the Tripitaka&quot;, she &quot;had only to glance over a written passage to master it, had only to hear something one time to be able to repeat it from memory.&quot; 
Combining their great talents, Jīvaka and Kumārāyana produced a son, Kumārajīva. When he was just seven, he had already memorised many Buddhist texts, and Jīvaka herself joined the Tsio-li nunnery north of Kucha. Two years later, when her son was nine, Jīvaka took him where they stayed for a year. Finally, they travelled to Turpan before returning home to Kucha. As Kumārajīva grew up Jīvaka the two are said to have become more distant, with Jīvaka supposedly relocating to Kashmir. Kumārajīva became a noted Buddhist scholar and translator.

<doc id="980631" wikidata="Q6292257" url="?curid=980631" title="José Francisco Peña Gómez">
<text>José Francisco Peña Gómez (6 March 1937 – 10 May 1998) was a politician from the Dominican Republic. He was the leader of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), a three-time candidate for president of the Dominican Republic and former Mayor of Santo Domingo. He is considered, along with Joaquín Balaguer and Juan Bosch, as one of the most prominent Dominican political figures of the 20th century.

== Early life ==
Born to María Marcelin, a Haitian woman, and Oguís Vincent, a Haitian immigrant, on March 6, 1937, in Mao, Dominican Republic, Peña Gómez was adopted as an infant by Simón Pichardo and Andrea Rodríguez de Pichardo, a Dominican family, when his parents had to flee to Haiti (where they died) in order to save their lives as the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo enacted the Parsley Massacre against Haitians that same year. In later years, Peña Gómez’ opponents would use his Haitian ancestry against him.

Peña Gómez received a BA-equivalent degree from the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo (UASD) in 1966 before going on to higher studies at the Sorbonne in Paris.

== The April Civil War and Exile ==
Since 1961, Peña Gómez became a supporter of Juan Bosch, then leader of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). Bosch won the presidential elections of 1962, the first democratic president in 32 years, but his government was ousted in a military coup on 25 September 1963. In 1965, Peña rose to political prominence as he went on Radio Santo Domingo and called for a popular insurrection against the military coup and a return of Bosch. U. S. President Lyndon Johnson ordered a military invasion to prevent what he feared was a possible communist movement within the country.

== Leadership of the P.R.D. ==

In December 1973, Bosch formed the Dominican Liberation Party (P.L.D.). Under Peña&#x27;s leadership, the P.R.D. won the presidential election in 1978 (Antonio Guzmán) and 1982 (Salvador Jorge Blanco), and he himself was Mayor of Santo Domingo from 1982 to 1986. His period is mostly remembered for the creation of the &quot;Plaza Güibia&quot; (Güibia Plaza), on the seaside boulevard and plantation of ornamental trees in mayor Santo Domingo city avenues.

In 1990, Peña ran for the presidency, coming in third behind Balaguer of the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC) and Bosch of the PLD.

By 1994, the PRD was solidified and motivated, and Peña was once again the party&#x27;s standard-bearer in the presidential election. Even by Dominican standards, the 1994 campaign was violent and dirty. Peña lost to Balaguer in an extremely tight election marred by numerous irregularities. A number of Peña supporters showed up to vote only to discover their names had vanished from the rolls. Peña called a general strike which was widely supported by his followers. After international protest, an investigation was mounted that raised grave concerns about the poll&#x27;s legitimacy. The electoral board did not know the total number of registered voters, and the voting lists distributed

at polling stations did not match those given to the parties. The investigation also revealed that about 200,000 people had been removed from the polls. After intense negotiations, Balaguer announced that he would leave office prematurely in 1996 after serving seven terms in power.

In the 1996 poll, Peña won the first round of voting but fell short of the majority needed. In the second round of voting, Leonel Fernández, a lawyer representing the PLD, won a narrow victory due to an alliance between the PLD with Balaguer&#x27;s PRSC.

== Vice-President of Socialist International ==
As Vice President of the Socialist International, José Francisco Peña Gómez worked closely with the organization&#x27;s leadership, including its President, Willy Brandt. His tenure was marked by active participation in key initiatives and strategic discussions aimed at strengthening the social-democratic movement in Latin America and worldwide.

Peña Gómez collaborated with prominent political figures such as Bruno Kreisky, François Mitterrand, Olof Palme, Mário Soares, and Felipe González.

Throughout his work, he also engaged with distinguished

leaders, including Bettino Craxi (Italy), Anker Jørgensen (Denmark), Lionel Jospin (France), Kalevi Sorsa (Finland), Joop den Uyl (Netherlands), as well as Léopold Senghor (Senegal) and Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Egypt).

For 15 years, Peña Gómez chaired the Socialist International Committee for Latin America, playing a key role in shaping its agenda and supporting democratic transformations in the 

region.

== Personal life ==
Peña Gómez married four times, the first time with Julia Idalia Guaba Martínez. The children are as follows: Lourdes Fátima, Luz del Alba “Luchy”, José Francisco “José Frank”, and Francisco Antonio “Tony” Peña Guaba.

During his second marriage with Ana Rosa Meléndez (who was Director of the Museum of Modern Dominican Art), they adopted María Rosa, the daughter of a domestic worker, who at birth had been abandoned in the public maternity hospital in Santo Domingo.

His fourth and last marriage was to Peggy Cabral, daughter of the Dominican writer Manuel del Cabral. Peña had nine children in total.

==Final years==

Peña Gómez died on May 10, 1998, in Cambita Garabitos, San Cristóbal, 6 days before the mayoral elections of Santo Domingo, in which he was running.

Peña Gómez was one of the most popular leaders in recent political history in Dominican Republic, especially among the poor masses.

Being a key political figure until his death, the main Dominican Republic international airport was renamed from &quot;Aeropuerto Internacional Las Américas&quot; to &quot;Aeropuerto Internacional Las&quot;

&quot;Américas José Francisco Peña Gómez&quot;.

==Legacy==

In honor of José Francisco Peña Gómez, a monument stands proudly in the capital city of Santo Domingo, symbolizing his enduring legacy and profound impact on the Dominican Republic and beyond.

A metro station and an International Airport in Santo Domingo is named in honor of Peña Gómez.

A street in Higüey is named in honor of Peña Gómez.

Сommemorative bust has been erected in Puerto Rico, supported by the Dominican community.

== José Francisco Peña Gómez Institute ==

The José Francisco Peña Gómez Institute is an educational and research center dedicated to preserving and promoting the legacy of José Francisco Peña Gómez. The institute focuses on advancing the principles of democracy, social justice, and human rights through educational programs, leadership training, and policy research.

The institute serves as a hub for academic dialogue and civic engagement, offering workshops, seminars, and conferences on topics such as good governance, social inclusion, and sustainable development. It plays a key role in empowering young leaders, providing them with tools and knowledge to actively participate in political and social processes.

<text>Kumārāyana (also Kiu-mo-yen) was a Buddhist monk. Kumārāyana renounced his wealth to become a Buddhist monk. He left India, crossing to the Pamirs in order to spread the teachings of Buddhism to the countries east of Central Asia, namely China.

Probably from Kashmir, Kumārāyana never made it to eastern China for on his journey he stopped in Kucha, where the king, respecting Kumārāyana&#x27;s eminence and wisdom wanted him to discontinue his journey, and stay in Kucha to become a royal priest.

In order to persuade Kumārāyana to stay in Kucha, the King introduced him to the wisest woman in Kucha, his sister Jīvaka. Jīvaka was coveted by many suitors for her great talents intellectual abilities. However, upon meeting Kumārāyana, Jīvaka was moved and they fell in love with each other. They married and combined their great talents. Though, they are mainly known in Buddhist history for the deeds of their son named Kumārajīva who, largely under Jīvaka&#x27;s guidance, went on to become an erudite Buddhist scholar and translator. One of his more well-reputed translations was that of the Lotus Sutra.

<doc id="980657" wikidata="Q8410" url="?curid=980657" title="Gang bang">
<text>A gang bang is a sexual activity in which one person is the central focus of the sexual activity of several people, usually more than three, sequentially or simultaneously. The term generally refers to a woman being the focus; one man with multiple women can be referred to as a &quot;reverse gang bang&quot;. The term has become associated with the porn industry and usually describes a staged event wherein a woman has sex with several men in direct succession. Bukkake is a type of gang bang, originating in Japan, that focuses on the central person being ejaculated upon by male participants.

==Practice==
The largest gang bangs are sponsored by pornographic film companies, and recorded, but a gang bang is not unusual in the swinger community. It is more often considered to have multiple men and one woman, while a so-called &quot;reverse gang bang&quot; (one man and many women), which can be seen in pornography. Female-on-female and male-on-male gang bangs also happen.

Gang bangs are not defined by the precise number of participants, but usually involve more than three people and may involve a dozen or more. When the gang bang is organized specifically to culminate with the (near) simultaneous or rapid serial ejaculations of all male participants on the central man or woman, then it may be referred to by the Japanese term bukkake.

By contrast, three people engaged in sex is normally referred to as a threesome, and four people are normally referred to as a foursome. Gang bangs also differ from group sex, such as threesomes and foursomes, in that most (if not all) sexual acts during a gang bang are centered on or performed with just the central person. Although the participants of a gang bang may know each other, the spontaneity and anonymity of participants is often part of the attraction. Additionally, the other participants normally do not engage in sex acts with each other, but may stand nearby and masturbate while waiting for an opportunity to engage in sexual activity.

==Pornography==

Though there have been numerous gang bang pornographic films since the 1980s, they usually involved no more than half a dozen to a dozen men. However, starting with &quot;The World&#x27;s Biggest Gangbang&quot; (1995) starring Annabel Chong with 251 partners, the pornographic industry began producing a series of films ostensibly setting gangbang records for most consecutive sex acts by one person in a short period.

These kinds of films were financially successful, winning AVN Awards for the best-selling pornographic films of their year; however, the events were effectively unofficiated and the record-breaking claims often misleading. Jasmin St. Claire described her &quot;record&quot;, purportedly set with 300 men in &quot;World&#x27;s Biggest Gang Bang 2&quot;, as &quot;among the biggest cons ever pulled off in the porn business&quot;, with merely about 30 men &quot;strategically placed and filmed,&quot; only ten of whom were actually able to perform sexually on camera.

<doc id="980661" wikidata="Q7053760" url="?curid=980661" title="North American Debating Championship">
<text>The North American Debating Championship is one of the two official university debate championships of North America. It is sanctioned by the national university debating associations in the United States and Canada, the American Parliamentary Debate Association and the Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate. It has been held each winter on an alternating basis between the United States and Canada since 1992. The host university arranges all judging and is not allowed in the competition. The most frequent hosts have been the University of Toronto and McGill University, which have each hosted the championship three times. Bates College, Cornell University, Johns Hopkins University, and Queen&#x27;s University have each hosted twice. This tournament, often abbreviated as NorthAms, is not to be confused with the North American Universities Debating Championship, abbreviated as NAUDC, which is hosted separately in the fall of each year as a British Parliamentary Style tournament. The two events are coordinated such that each is hosted by a different country, the United States or Canada, in a given year.

The most recent iteration was held by the Odette School of Business in January 2025. The current North American champions are from the University of Chicago.

==Results==
Since 1992, the most successful university overall has been Yale University with nine championship victories, including three of the last four. Following it is the University of Toronto with seven wins. After that, Princeton University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University and McGill University have two championships each, and no other university has won more than once.

No team has ever repeated as the top team at the championship. Five individuals have won the top team award twice. Most recently, Matthew Song won in 2022 and 2024, representing Yale University. Matthew Wansley of Yale University won back-to-back championships from 2005 to 2007. Prior to that, Nathan MacDonald and Robert Silver won first together for the University of Western Ontario in 1997–1998, then MacDonald for the University of Guelph in 1998–1999, and Silver for the University of Ottawa in 1999–2000. Three people have won the top individual debater award twice: Casey Halladay of the University of Ottawa in 1997–1998 and 1999–2000, Rory Gillis of Yale University in two consecutive years from 2004 to 2006, and Kate Falkenstien of Yale in two consecutive years from 2010 to 2012.

==North American Public Speaking Championship==
Every year from 1992 to 2001, and biannually from 2003 to 2007, individual public speaking was also an event at the championship. It was run as a parallel tournament, with a grand public speaking final before the final round of debate. After 2007, it was discontinued as APDA had shortened debating tournaments and discontinued public speaking as a regular event at US tournaments. No individual ever repeated as North American Public Speaking Champion. McGill University and the University of Ottawa each had three public speaking champions, the most of any university.

<text>The Pioneer anomaly, or Pioneer effect, was the observed deviation from predicted accelerations of the &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; spacecraft after they passed about on their trajectories out of the Solar System. The apparent anomaly was a matter of much interest for many years but has been subsequently explained by anisotropic radiation pressure caused by the spacecraft&#x27;s heat loss.

Both &quot;Pioneer&quot; spacecraft are escaping the Solar System but are slowing under the influence of the Sun&#x27;s gravity. Upon very close examination of navigational data, the spacecraft were found to be slowing slightly more than expected. The effect is an extremely small acceleration towards the Sun, of , which is equivalent to a reduction of the outbound velocity by over a period of ten years. The two spacecraft were launched in 1972 and 1973. The anomalous acceleration was first noticed as early as 1980 but not seriously investigated until 1994. The last communication with either spacecraft was in 2003, but analysis of recorded data continues.

Various explanations, both of spacecraft behavior and of gravitation itself, were proposed to explain the anomaly. Over the period from 1998 to 2012, one particular explanation became accepted. The spacecraft, which are surrounded by an ultra-high vacuum and are each powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), can shed heat only via thermal radiation. If, due to the design of the spacecraft, more heat is emitted in a particular direction by what is known as a radiative anisotropy, then the spacecraft would accelerate slightly in the direction opposite of the excess emitted radiation due to the recoil of thermal photons. If the excess radiation and attendant radiation pressure were pointed in a general direction opposite the Sun, the spacecraft&#x27;s velocity away from the Sun would be decreasing at a rate greater than could be explained by previously recognized forces, such as gravity and trace friction due to the interplanetary medium (imperfect vacuum).

By 2012, several papers by different groups, all reanalyzing the thermal radiation pressure forces inherent in the spacecraft, showed that a careful accounting of this explains the entire anomaly; thus the cause is mundane and does not point to any new phenomenon or need to update the laws of physics. The most detailed analysis to date, by some of the original investigators, explicitly looks at two methods of estimating thermal forces, concluding that there is &quot;no statistically significant difference between the two estimates and [...] that once the thermal recoil force is properly accounted for, no anomalous acceleration remains.&quot;

==Description==
&quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;11&quot; were sent on missions to Jupiter and Jupiter/Saturn respectively. Both spacecraft were spin-stabilised in order to keep their high-gain antennas pointed towards Earth using gyroscopic forces. Although the spacecraft included thrusters, after the planetary encounters they were used only for semiannual conical scanning maneuvers to track Earth in its orbit, leaving them on a long &quot;cruise&quot; phase through the outer Solar System. During this period, both spacecraft were repeatedly contacted to obtain various measurements on their physical environment, providing valuable information long after their initial missions were complete.

Because the spacecraft were flying with almost no additional stabilization thrusts during their &quot;cruise&quot;, it is possible to characterize the density of the solar medium by its effect on the spacecraft&#x27;s motion. In the outer Solar System this effect would be easily calculable, based on ground-based measurements of the deep space environment. When these effects were taken into account, along with all other known effects, the calculated position of the Pioneers did not agree with measurements based on timing the return of the radio signals being sent back from the spacecraft. These consistently showed that both spacecraft were closer to the inner Solar System than they should be, by thousands of kilometres—small compared to their distance from the Sun, but still statistically significant. This apparent discrepancy grew over time as the measurements were repeated, suggesting that whatever was causing the anomaly was still acting on the spacecraft.

As the anomaly was growing, it appeared that the spacecraft were moving more slowly than expected. Measurements of the spacecraft&#x27;s speed using the Doppler effect demonstrated the same thing: the observed redshift was less than expected, which meant that the Pioneers had slowed down more than expected.

When all known forces acting on the spacecraft were taken into consideration, a very small but unexplained force remained. It appeared to cause an approximately constant sunward acceleration of for both spacecraft. If the positions of the spacecraft were predicted one year in advance based on measured velocity and known forces (mostly gravity), they were actually found to be some closer to the sun at the end of the year. This anomaly is now believed to be accounted for by thermal recoil forces.

==Explanation: thermal recoil force==
Starting in 1998, there were suggestions that the thermal recoil force was underestimated, and perhaps could account for the entire anomaly. However, accurately accounting for thermal forces was hard, because it needed telemetry records of the spacecraft temperatures and a detailed thermal model, neither of which was available at the time. Furthermore, all thermal models predicted a decrease in the effect with time, which did not appear in the initial analysis.

One by one these objections were addressed. Many of the old telemetry records were found, and converted to modern formats. This gave power consumption figures and some temperatures for parts of the spacecraft. Several groups built detailed thermal models, which could be checked against the known temperatures and powers, and allowed a quantitative calculation of the recoil force. The longer span of navigational records showed the acceleration was in fact decreasing.

In July 2012, Slava Turyshev &quot;et al.&quot; published a paper in &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; that explained the anomaly. The work explored the effect of the thermal recoil force on Pioneer 10, and concluded that &quot;once the thermal recoil force is properly accounted for, no anomalous acceleration remains.&quot; Although the paper by Turyshev &quot;et al.&quot; has the most detailed analysis to date, the explanation based on thermal recoil force has the support of other independent research groups, using a variety of computational techniques. Examples include &quot;thermal recoil pressure is not the cause of the Rosetta flyby anomaly but likely resolves the anomalous acceleration observed for &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;.&quot; and &quot;It is shown that the whole anomalous acceleration can be explained by thermal effects&quot;.

==Indications from other missions==
The Pioneers were uniquely suited to discover the effect because they have been flying for long periods of time without additional course corrections. Most deep-space probes launched after the Pioneers either stopped at one of the planets, or used thrusting throughout their mission.

The Voyagers flew a mission profile similar to the Pioneers, but were not spin stabilized. Instead, they required frequent firings of their thrusters for attitude control to stay aligned with Earth. Spacecraft like the Voyagers acquire small and unpredictable changes in speed as a side effect of the frequent attitude control firings. This &#x27;noise&#x27; makes it impractical to measure small accelerations such as the Pioneer effect; accelerations as large as 10−9 m/s2 would be undetectable.

Newer spacecraft have used spin stabilization for some or all of their mission, including both &quot;Galileo&quot; and &quot;Ulysses&quot;. These spacecraft indicate a similar effect, although for various reasons (such as their relative proximity to the Sun) firm conclusions cannot be drawn from these sources. The &quot;Cassini&quot; mission has reaction wheels as well as thrusters for attitude control, and during cruise could rely for long periods on the reaction wheels alone, thus enabling precision measurements. It also had radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) mounted close to the spacecraft body, radiating kilowatts of heat in hard-to-predict directions.

After &quot;Cassini&quot; arrived at Saturn, it shed a large fraction of its mass from the fuel used in the insertion burn and the release of the &quot;Huygens&quot; probe. This increases the acceleration caused by the radiation forces because they are acting on less mass. This change in acceleration allows the radiation forces to be measured independently of any gravitational acceleration. Comparing cruise and Saturn-orbit results shows that for &quot;Cassini&quot;, almost all the unmodelled acceleration was due to radiation forces, with only a small residual acceleration, much smaller than the Pioneer acceleration, and with opposite sign.

The non-gravitational acceleration of the deep space probe &quot;New Horizons&quot; has been measured at about sunward, somewhat larger than the effect on Pioneer. Modelling of thermal effects indicates an expected sunward acceleration of , and given the uncertainties, the acceleration appears consistent with thermal radiation as the source of the non-gravitational forces measured. The measured acceleration is slowly decreasing as would be expected from the decreasing thermal output of the RTG.

==Potential issues with the thermal solution==
There are two features of the anomaly, as originally reported, that are not addressed by the thermal solution: periodic variations in the anomaly, and the onset of the anomaly near the orbit of Saturn.

First, the anomaly has an apparent annual periodicity and an apparent Earth sidereal daily periodicity with amplitudes that are formally greater than the error budget. However, the same paper also states this problem is most likely not related to the anomaly: &quot;The annual and diurnal terms are very likely different manifestations of the same modeling problem. [...] Such a modeling problem arises when there are errors in any of the parameters of the spacecraft orientation with respect to the chosen reference frame.&quot;

Second, the value of the anomaly measured over a period during and after the Pioneer 11 Saturn encounter had a relatively high uncertainty and a significantly lower value. The Turyshev, et al. 2012 paper compared the thermal analysis to the &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; only. The Pioneer anomaly was unnoticed until after &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; passed its Saturn encounter. However, the most recent analysis states: &quot;Figure 2 is strongly suggestive that the previously reported &quot;onset&quot; of the Pioneer anomaly may in fact be a simple result of mis-modeling of the solar thermal contribution; this question may be resolved with further analysis of early trajectory data&quot;.

==Previously proposed explanations==
Before the thermal recoil explanation became accepted, other proposed explanations fell into two classes—&quot;mundane causes&quot; or &quot;new physics&quot;. Mundane causes include conventional effects that were overlooked or mis-modeled in the initial analysis, such as measurement error, thrust from gas leakage, or uneven heat radiation. The &quot;new physics&quot; explanations proposed revision of our understanding of gravitational physics.

If the Pioneer anomaly had been a gravitational effect due to some long-range modifications of the known laws of gravity, it did not affect the orbital motions of the major natural bodies in the same way (in particular those moving in the regions in which the Pioneer anomaly manifested itself in its presently known form). Hence a gravitational explanation would need to
violate the equivalence principle, which states that all objects are affected the same way by gravity. It was therefore argued that increasingly accurate measurements and modelling of the motions of the outer planets and their satellites undermined the possibility that the Pioneer anomaly is a phenomenon of gravitational origin. However, others believed that our knowledge of the motions of the outer planets and dwarf planet Pluto was still insufficient to disprove the gravitational nature of the Pioneer anomaly. The same authors ruled out the existence of a gravitational Pioneer-type extra-acceleration in the outskirts of the Solar System by using a sample of Trans-Neptunian objects.

The magnitude of the Pioneer effect formula_1 () is numerically quite close to the product () of the speed of light formula_2 and the Hubble constant formula_3, hinting at a cosmological connection, but this is now believed to be of no particular significance. 
In fact the latest Jet Propulsion Laboratory review (2010) undertaken by Turyshev and Toth claims to rule out the cosmological connection by considering rather conventional sources whereas other scientists provided a disproof based on the physical implications of cosmological models themselves.

Gravitationally bound objects such as the Solar System, or even the Milky Way, are not supposed to partake of the expansion of the universe—this is known both from conventional theory and by direct measurement. This does not necessarily interfere with paths new physics can take with drag effects from planetary secular accelerations of possible cosmological origin.

===Deceleration model===
It has been viewed as possible that a real deceleration is not accounted for in the current model for several reasons.

====Gravity====
It is possible that deceleration is caused by gravitational forces from unidentified sources such as the Kuiper belt or dark matter. However, this acceleration does not show up in the orbits of the outer planets, so any generic gravitational answer would need to violate the equivalence principle (see modified inertia below). Likewise, the anomaly does not appear in the orbits of Neptune&#x27;s moons, challenging the possibility that the Pioneer anomaly may be an unconventional gravitational phenomenon based on range from the Sun.

====Drag====
The cause could be drag from the interplanetary medium, including dust, solar wind and cosmic rays. However, the measured densities are too small to cause the effect.

====Gas leaks====
Gas leaks, including helium from the spacecraft&#x27;s radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) have been thought as possible cause.

===Observational or recording errors===
The possibility of observational errors, which include measurement and computational errors, has been advanced as a reason for interpreting the data as an anomaly. Hence, this would result in approximation and statistical errors. However, further analysis has determined that significant errors are not likely because seven independent analyses have shown the existence of the Pioneer anomaly as of March 2010.

The effect is so small that it could be a statistical anomaly caused by differences in the way data were collected over the lifetime of the probes. Numerous changes were made over this period, including changes in the receiving instruments, reception sites, data recording systems and recording formats.

===New physics===
Because the &quot;Pioneer anomaly&quot; does not show up as an effect on the planets, Anderson &quot;et al.&quot; speculated that this would be interesting if this was &quot;new physics&quot;. Later, with the Doppler shifted signal confirmed, the team again speculated that one explanation may lie with new physics, if not some unknown systemic explanation.

====Clock acceleration====
Clock acceleration was an alternate explanation to anomalous acceleration of the spacecraft towards the Sun. This theory took notice of an expanding universe, which was thought to create an &quot;increasing&quot; background &#x27;gravitational potential&#x27;. The increased gravitational potential would then accelerate cosmological time. It was proposed that this particular effect causes the observed deviation from predicted trajectories and velocities of &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;.

From their data, Anderson&#x27;s team deduced a steady frequency drift of over eight years. This could be mapped on to a clock acceleration theory, which meant all clocks would be changing in relation to a constant acceleration: in other words, that there would be a non-uniformity of time. Moreover, for such a distortion related to time, Anderson&#x27;s team reviewed several models in which time distortion as a phenomenon is considered. They arrived at the &quot;clock acceleration&quot; model after completion of the review. Although the best model adds a quadratic term to defined International Atomic Time, the team encountered problems with this theory. This then led to &quot;non-uniform time in relation to a constant acceleration&quot; as the most likely theory.

====Definition of gravity modified====
The Modified Newtonian dynamics or MOND hypothesis proposed that the force of gravity deviates from the traditional Newtonian value to a very different force law at very low accelerations on the order of . Given the low accelerations placed on the spacecraft while in the outer Solar System, MOND may be in effect, modifying the normal gravitational equations. The Lunar Laser Ranging experiment combined with data of LAGEOS satellites refutes that simple gravity modification is the cause of the Pioneer anomaly. The precession of the longitudes of perihelia of the solar planets or the trajectories of long-period comets have not been reported to experience an anomalous gravitational field toward the Sun of the magnitude capable of describing the Pioneer anomaly.

====Definition of inertia modified====
MOND can also be interpreted as a modification of inertia, perhaps due to an interaction with vacuum energy, and such a trajectory-dependent theory could account for the different accelerations apparently acting on the orbiting planets and the Pioneer craft on their escape trajectories. A possible terrestrial test for evidence of a different model of modified inertia has also been proposed.

====Parametric time====
Another theoretical explanation was based on a possible non-equivalence of the atomic time and the astronomical time, which could give the same observational fingerprint as the anomaly.

====Celestial ephemerides in an expanding universe====
Another proposed explanation of Pioneer anomaly is that the background spacetime is described by a cosmological Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric that is not Minkowski flat. In this model of spacetime manifold, light moves uniformly with respect to the conformal cosmological time whereas physical measurements are performed with the help of atomic clocks that count the proper time of observer coinciding with the cosmic time. This difference yields exactly the same numerical value and signature of the Doppler shift measured in the Pioneer experiment. However, this explanation requires the thermal effects be a small percentage of the total, in contradiction to the many studies that estimate it to be the bulk of the effect.

==Further research avenues==
It is possible, but not proven, that this anomaly is linked to the flyby anomaly, which has been observed in other spacecraft. Although the circumstances are very different (planet flyby vs. deep space cruise), the overall effect is similar—a small but unexplained velocity change is observed on top of a much larger conventional gravitational acceleration.

The Pioneer spacecraft are no longer providing new data (the last contact was on 23 January 2003) and other deep-space missions that might be studied (&quot;Galileo&quot; and &quot;Cassini&quot;) were deliberately disposed of in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn respectively at the ends of their missions. This leaves several remaining options for further research:

* Further analysis of the retrieved Pioneer data. This includes not only the data that was first used to detect the anomaly, but additional data that until recently was saved only in older, inaccessible computer formats and media. This data was recovered in 2006, converted to more modern formats, and is now available for analysis.
* The &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft to Pluto is spin-stabilised for long intervals, and there were proposals to use it to investigate the anomaly. It was known that &quot;New Horizons&quot; would have the same problem that precluded good data from the cruise portion of &quot;Cassini&quot; mission—its RTG is mounted close to the spacecraft body, so thermal radiation from it, bouncing off the spacecraft, will produce a systematic thrust of a not-easily predicted magnitude, as large or larger than the Pioneer effect. However, it was hoped that despite any large systematic bias from the RTG, the &#x27;onset&#x27; of the anomaly at or near the orbit of Saturn might be observed. 
* A dedicated mission has also been proposed. Such a mission would probably need to surpass from the Sun in a hyperbolic escape orbit.
* Observations of asteroids around may provide insights if the anomaly&#x27;s cause is gravitational.

==Meetings and conferences about the anomaly==

A meeting was held at the University of Bremen in 2004 to discuss the Pioneer anomaly.

The Pioneer Explorer Collaboration was formed to study the Pioneer Anomaly and has hosted three meetings (2005, 2007, and 2008) at International Space Science Institute in Bern, Switzerland, to discuss the anomaly, and discuss possible means for resolving the source.

<text>Three Worlds is a lithograph print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher first printed in December 1955.

&quot;Three Worlds&quot; depicts a large pool or lake during the autumn or winter months, the title referring to the three visible perspectives in the picture: the surface of the water on which leaves float, the world above the surface, observable by the water&#x27;s reflection of a forest, and the world below the surface, observable in the large fish swimming just below the water&#x27;s surface.

Escher also created a picture named &quot;Two Worlds&quot;.

<text>Rusape is a town in eastern Zimbabwe.

==Location==
It is located in Makoni District in Manicaland Province, in northeastern Zimbabwe. It lies approximately , by road, southeast of Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe. Rusape is situated on the main road (Highway A-3), between Harare and Mutare, approximately , further southeast of Rusape. Rusape sits at an altitude of , above sea level.

==Overview==
Rusape is a large, sprawling town that has not quite reached city status. As is typical of Zimbabwean towns, Rusape has areas of low and high density population. The main high density area close to the town is &quot;Vengere&quot; township. Other suburbs have also been built since Independence in 1980. &quot;Mabvazuva&quot; to the east of town, and Tsanzaguru further out by the lakeside. Mabvazuva literally translates to &quot;where the sun rises&quot; (the East). There is also a new fast growing medium density suburb far east sprawling into the farmlands which is called &quot;Magamba Township&quot;. Tsanzaguru is home to much of Rusape&#x27;s golden history. The name Tsanzaguru is derived from the Rozvi meaning of a big, rocky and tall hill from which the Rozvi were known to have wanted to build to the moon from there. They are said to have wanted to bring the moon to the King&#x27;s Zunde Ramambo as a gift. It is from this background that all Chiefs countrywide have their badges designed in a circular form resembling the circular dream moon that the Rozvi wanted to bring their King. Typically noticeable in the surrounding region are the kopjes, msasa trees, occasional tobacco farms and the sometimes densely crowded rural resettlement villages.

Rusape&#x27;s main piped water supply is from the purpose-built Rusape Dam, which was built on the Rusape River. The river runs in a northwest to southeast direction on the town outskirts. It is such a big river that the dam was planned with the eastern lowveld sugar-growing areas in mind. Ideally, Rusape dam was to be a reservoir for irrigation in areas deep down around Triangle and Chiredzi since it pours out into the Save River to the semi-arid regions.

==History==
&quot;Rusape&quot; was derived from &quot;rusapwe&quot; which means &quot;may it never dry&quot;, with reference to the ever-flowing waters of the Rusape River, adjacent to the town. Because there are no other perennial streams in its vicinity, it would be a disaster if the river dried. The settlement began in 1894 with the establishment of a British South Africa Company post on the Rusape River. A village grew around the post and, during the First Chimurenga in 1896, the village was attacked by Chief Mangwende. At &quot;Gwindingwi&quot;, during the early days, Chief Chingaira Makoni was beheaded by the British in front of his subjects after his death by firing squad and his head taken to England.

During World War II, over 700 Polish refugees, mostly women and children, escaping from Soviet-occupied Poland, were admitted in Rusape. In 1946, the refugee camp was closed, and the Poles were relocated to Gatooma, from where they were eventually repatriated to Europe.

==Climate==


==Population==
The town of Rusape has expanded southward, to include the high density area of &quot;Vengere&quot; and northward to include the low density development known as &quot;Silverbow&quot;. According to the 1982 Population Census, the town had a population of 8,216. This rose to 13,920 in 1992. In 2004, the population of Rusape was estimated at 29,292. The National Population Census of 2012 in Zimbabwe recorded a population of 30,316 for the town on 17 Augustus 2012. Former Zimbabwean Cricketer Kevin Curran hails from Rusape.

THE GOSPEL OF GOD CHURCH

Is located in the Gandanzara area near Dziruni shops on a hilltop called Dandadzi, the church was founded by Johane Masowe And was established in 1932.

==Rusape Controversies==
Improper Sale of Council Properties
Rusape Town Council has been accused of selling municipal properties without following proper tender processes. A Harare-based developer was awarded property rights under unclear circumstances, and tenants occupying the affected properties were given sudden eviction notices without prior consultation or relocation plans. 

The council justified these sales by citing financial distress and alleged bankruptcy; however, alternative solutions to protect affected tenants were not considered. On December 9, 2024, tenants were instructed to renew their leases, only for the council to cancel approximately 50 of these leases just ten days later. This abrupt reversal has caused widespread distress among local businesses and residents.

=== Muungwe Royal Estate Concerns ===
The Muungwe Royal Estate housing development has raised concerns due to its proximity to the flood-prone Rusape River. Critics argue that the estate’s location poses a risk to residents, yet the development has proceeded with minimal oversight.

Former MP Themba Mliswa has publicly condemned the developers for misleading the public regarding his alleged involvement in the project. Additionally, reports indicate that some of the developers behind Muungwe Royal Estate have a history of fraudulent activities, leading to calls for stricter regulatory scrutiny.

=== Failure to Fulfill Financial Obligations ===
Rusape Town Council has defaulted on several financial commitments, leading to the repossession of crucial municipal vehicles, including fire and refuse trucks. These vehicles were initially financed through tenders, but due to non-payment, they have been seized, raising questions about the council’s financial mismanagement.

Rather than resolving these financial issues through responsible budgetary measures, the council has resorted to selling historic town properties, some dating back to the 1930s.

=== Non-Payment of Employee Salaries ===
Over 90 Rusape Town Council employees have reportedly gone 14 months without receiving their salaries. This has raised concerns over labor rights violations and the town&#x27;s financial management practices.

In contrast, a former town secretary dismissed years ago, has allegedly received $200,000 in back pay, highlighting a misallocation of funds that has further fueled public outrage.

=== Past Corruption Scandals with No Accountability ===
Rusape Town Council has been implicated in multiple corruption scandals, with little to no accountability. One such case involved a $500,000 land corruption scandal that remains unresolved, with no action taken against those responsible.

The continued pattern of alleged corruption and mismanagement has eroded public trust in the local government.

=== Severe Service Delivery Failures ===
Rusape residents frequently experience severe service delivery failures, including prolonged water shortages and inconsistent refuse collection. This is particularly concerning given that the town is located near a man-made dam, and residents continue to pay municipal rates.

The Ministry of Local Government Commission visited Rusape in early 2025 to assess the town&#x27;s readiness for an upgrade to municipal status. However, critics argue that the town lacks the basic services necessary for such an upgrade, including reliable water supply, employee salaries, and proper municipal governance.
The Rusape Concerned Residents Trust Controversy

The Rusape Concerned Residents Trust, a WhatsApp group allegedly created to represent local interests, has been accused of operating as a propaganda tool for the Rusape Town Council. Critics claim that instead of advocating for residents, the group primarily defends council actions and censors dissenting voices.

Many residents believe that the platform is being used to silence those raising legitimate concerns about corruption, financial mismanagement, and service delivery failures. The extent of the group&#x27;s ties to local government officials remains a topic of debate within the community.

<text>Black and Blue is the thirteenth studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released on 23 April 1976, by Rolling Stones Records.

This album was the first record after former guitarist Mick Taylor quit in December 1974. As he had done the previous time the Stones were between second guitarists in 1968, Keith Richards recorded the bulk of the guitar parts himself, though the album recording sessions also served as an audition for Taylor&#x27;s replacement. Richards said of the album that it was used for &quot;rehearsing guitar players, that&#x27;s what that one was about.&quot; Numerous guitarists showed up to auditions; those who appeared on the album were Wayne Perkins, Harvey Mandel, and Ronnie Wood. Wood had previously contributed to the title track from the &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; album, and became a temporary touring member of the Stones in 1975 and official member in 1976. The Stones rhythm section of bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts appear on nearly all tracks, and frequent collaborators Nicky Hopkins and Billy Preston play keyboards on most of the album, with percussionist Ollie E. Brown also appearing on about half of the tracks. The album was the second to be self-produced, credited to &quot;The Glimmer Twins&quot;, a pseudonym used by Jagger and Richards for their roles as producers.

&quot;Black and Blue&quot; showed the band blending their traditional rock and roll style with heavy influences from reggae and funk music. Only one single from the album, &quot;Fool to Cry&quot;, had any significant chart success, and reception to the album was mixed. The album received a few positive reviews at the time of release, though many reviewers found it mostly forgettable, and tended to rank it very low compared to prior Stones releases. Retrospective reviews from more recent publications such as AllMusic have been kinder to the album, with critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine stating that the album&#x27;s &quot;being longer on grooves and jams than songs&quot; ended up being &quot;what&#x27;s good about it&quot;.

==History==
The Rolling Stones returned to Munich, Germany, in December 1974—where they had recorded their previous album &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;—and began the recording of their new album at Musicland Studios, with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards (as the Glimmer Twins) producing again. With a view to releasing it in time for a summer 1975 Tour of the Americas, the band broke for the holidays and returned in January in Rotterdam, Netherlands, to continue working—all the while auditioning new guitarists as they recorded. Among the hopefuls were Steve Marriott, Harvey Mandel, Wayne Perkins, Peter Frampton, Robert A. Johnson and Ronnie Wood (although only Mandel, Perkins and Wood&#x27;s guitar work would appear on the finished album). Guitar heroes Rory Gallagher and Jeff Beck both went over for a jam with the band &quot;just to see what was going on,&quot; but both declined interest in joining the group, happy with their solo careers. Jeff Beck stated that, &quot;in two hours I got to play three chords – I need a little more energy than that.&quot; Beck&#x27;s jamming with the Stones remains unreleased to date, but is available on bootleg recordings. With much work to follow, it was decided to delay the album for the following year and release the &quot;Made in the Shade&quot; compilation instead. &quot;Cherry Oh Baby&quot; (which was a cover version of Eric Donaldson&#x27;s 1971 reggae song) would be the only song from the upcoming album sporadically played on the 1975 &quot;Tour of the Americas&quot;.

Following the conclusion of the tour, the band went to Montreux, Switzerland, in October for some overdub work, returning to Musicland Studios in Munich in December to perform similar work. After some final touch-ups, &quot;Black and Blue&quot; was completed in New York City in February 1976. That month the Stones flew to Sanibel Island Beach on Sanibel Island, Florida, to be photographed by fashion photographer Hiro for the album cover art.

Stylistically, &quot;Black and Blue&quot; embraces hard rock with &quot;Hand of Fate&quot; (solo by Wayne Perkins) and &quot;Crazy Mama&quot;; funk with &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; (solo by Harvey Mandel); reggae with their cover of &quot;Cherry Oh Baby&quot; (Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards weaving guitars); and blues with &quot;Melody,&quot; featuring the talents of Billy Preston – a heavy contributor to the album. Musical and thematic styles were merged on the seven-minute &quot;Memory Motel,&quot; with both Jagger and Richards contributing lead vocals to a love song embedded within a life-on-the-road tale.

While all the album&#x27;s songs except &quot;Cherry Oh Baby&quot; were officially credited to Jagger/Richards as authors, the credit for &quot;Hey Negrita&quot; specifies &quot;Inspiration by Ron Wood&quot; and &quot;Melody&quot; lists &quot;Inspiration by Billy Preston&quot;. Bill Wyman would later release a version of &quot;Melody&quot; with his Rhythm Kings, crediting Preston as author. &quot;Melody&quot; is based on &quot;Do You Love Me&quot; by Billy Preston and Bruce Fisher, from Preston&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Everybody Likes Some Kind of Music&quot;. The only song to include both session players Wayne Perkins and Harvey Mandel is Memory Motel where Perkins plays acoustic, Mandel electric, but without a guitar solo.

Two extra tracks recorded in the Rotterdam sessions were later released on 1981&#x27;s &quot;Tattoo You&quot;: &quot;Slave&quot; and &quot;Worried About You&quot; (guitar solo by Wayne Perkins).

==Release and reception==
Released on 23 April 1976 – with &quot;Fool to Cry&quot;, a worldwide top 10 hit, as its lead single – &quot;Black and Blue&quot; reached No. 2 in the UK and spent an interrupted four-week spell at number 1 in the United States, going platinum there.

The album was promoted with a controversial billboard on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood that depicted the model Anita Russell, bound by Jagger under the phrase &quot;I&#x27;m &quot;Black and Blue&quot; from the Rolling Stones – and I love it!&quot; The billboard was removed after protests by the feminist group Women Against Violence Against Women, although it earned the band widespread press coverage.

===Critical reception===
Critical view was polarised. According to writer Bud Scoppa, some critics were bewildered by the album, while others dismissed it for its dissimilarities to &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; (1972), which by then had become regarded as the group&#x27;s best work. Author Gary J. Jucha describes the mixed critical reaction as typical of &quot;most progressive albums by an established recording artist.&quot;

Lester Bangs wrote in &quot;Creem&quot; that &quot;the heat&#x27;s off, because it&#x27;s all over, they really don&#x27;t matter anymore or stand for anything [...] this is the first meaningless Rolling Stones album, and thank God&quot;. However, Robert Christgau commended the band for taking musical risks, and singled out &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; and &quot;Fool to Cry&quot; for particular praise before concluding: &quot;diagnosis: not dead by a long shot&quot;. He also felt that the album represents the Stones&#x27; biggest exploration of black rhythms and styles since &quot;December&#x27;s Children&quot; (1965). Bill Cosford of &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; highlighted the record as a musical departure for the band, writing: &quot;&quot;Black and Blue&quot; is not a rock album. It is a sampler, of sorts, a musical term paper. In it the Stones examine the several influences on pop music today: salsa, disco, reggae. By and large, they do so superbly. But in committing themselves to exercises in musical formulae as tight as these, the Stones attach their music to styles subject to rapid eclipse.&quot;

Retrospectively, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the album for being &quot;longer on grooves and jams than songs&quot;, which he felt was inevitable as it was recorded while the Stones auditioned a replacement for Taylor, and for profiling the band&#x27;s musical chemistry. He felt that &quot;groove and sound&quot; characterise the record, generally eschewing straight rock songs for reggae, funk and disco excursions that &quot;sound like integral parts of the Stones&#x27; lifeblood&quot;. Bud Scoppa of &quot;Uncut&quot; described the record as an &quot;unlikely triumph&quot;, with the groove-oriented material and guesting &quot;hotshot musicians&quot; combining for strong performances, &quot;expertly brought out by the ultra-dry sonics of engineers Glyn Johns and Keith Harwood&quot;. He wrote: &quot;Forty-one minutes of super-tight, bone-dry, hi-fi rock and soul, &quot;Black and Blue&quot; is one of the Stones&#x27; most underrated albums – the only Stones LP to focus primarily on feel rather than subject matter.&quot;

Less favourably, &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; contributor Peter Shapiro wrote that following the addition of Wood to their line-up, the Stones slowly transformed into &quot;caricatures of the worst rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll excesses&quot;, adding that on &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, the group &quot;tried to answer LeRoi Jones&#x27;s comment that white people were &#x27;the keepers of last year&#x27;s blues&#x27; by appropriating contemporary funk and reggae stylings, with mixed results.&quot; Colin Larkin of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; wrote that the album &quot;showed the group seeking a possible new direction playing variants on white reggae, but the results were less than impressive.&quot; Similarly, Martin C. Strong of &quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot; noted that the record saw &quot;[Wood] brought into the fold and a half hearted attempt at reggae stylings&quot;. In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, &quot;Black and Blue&quot; is described as a &quot;nearly song-free&quot; album which works best on the sincere ballads &quot;Fool to Cry&quot; and &quot;Memory Motel&quot; and &quot;the silly but shitkicking cowboy tale &#x27;Hand of Fate&#x27;.&quot;

In 2000, &quot;Black and Blue&quot; was ranked at number 536 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

===Legacy===
In 1977, Keith Richards said that the album &quot;wasn&#x27;t very good – certainly nowhere as good as &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;&quot;, though he reappraised the record in 1984. Mick Jagger offered his assessment in the 1990s: &quot;It was a bit of a holiday period. I mean, we cared, but we didn&#x27;t care as much as we had, not really concentrating on the creative process.&quot; Mick Taylor praised the album in a 1979 interview.

In 1994, &quot;Black and Blue&quot; was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records, again in 2009 by Universal Music, and once more in 2011 by Universal Music Enterprises in a Japanese-only SHM-SACD version. The 1994 remaster was initially released in a Collector&#x27;s Edition CD, which replicated in miniature many elements of the original gatefold album packaging.

<doc id="980683" wikidata="Q2919468" url="?curid=980683" title="Belvedere (M. C. Escher)">
<text>Belvedere is a lithograph print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher, first printed in May 1958. It shows a plausible-looking belvedere building that is an impossible object, modelled after an impossible cube.

==Imagery==
In this lithograph, Escher uses two-dimensional images to depict objects free of the confines of the three-dimensional world. The image is of a rectangular, three-story building. The upper two floors are open at the sides, with the top floor and roof supported by pillars. From the viewer&#x27;s perspective, all the pillars on the middle floor are the same size at both the front and back, but the pillars at the back are set higher. The viewer also sees by the corners of the top floor that it is at a different angle than the rest of the structure. All these elements make it possible for all the pillars on the middle floor to stand at right angles, yet the pillars at the front support the back side of the top floor while the pillars at the back support the front side. This paradox also allows a ladder to extend from the inside of the middle floor to the outside of the top floor.

There is a man seated at the foot of the building holding an impossible cube. He appears to be constructing it from a diagram of a Necker cube at his feet, with the intersecting lines circled. The window next to him is closed with an iron grille that is geometrically valid, but practically impossible to assemble.

==Influences==
The woman about to climb the steps of the building is modeled after a figure from the right-hand panel of Hieronymus Bosch&#x27;s 1500 triptych &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;. This panel is individually titled &quot;Hell&quot;; a portion of it was recreated by Escher as a lithograph in 1935.

The ridge in the background is part of the Morrone Mountains in Abruzzo, that Escher had visited several times when living in Italy during the 1920s and 1930s.

==Legacy==
In 2012, Prof. Gershon Elber of Israel&#x27;s Technion University, using specially designed CAD software and a 3D printer, created a 3D model of Belvedere and other impossible Escher structures, viewable only from one angle.

<text>Key Club International, also called Key Club, is an international service organization for high school students. Key Club International is the high school branch of the Kiwanis International family, classified as a Service Leadership Program and more specifically as a Kiwanis Youth Program. Many Key Clubs are sponsored by a local Kiwanis club.

The organization was started by California State Commissioner of Schools Albert C. Olney and vocational education teacher Frank C. Vincent, who worked together to establish the first Key Club at Sacramento High School in California on May 7, 1925. Female students were first admitted in 1977, ten years before women were admitted to the sponsoring organization, Kiwanis International.

Key Club International began a 100-day countdown celebration leading up to the 100th anniversary in 2025 with celebratory events throughout the country prior to International Convention.
==History==

===Origin===
In 1924, the local Kiwanis Club decided to attempt to begin a service club at the Sacramento High School, and the school principal supported the idea and began searching for students willing to start the club. In May 1925, a group of boys at Sacramento High School held their first club meeting. 

===Inclusivity===
Female students were first allowed to join in 1977 (52 years after the founding of the organization). This occurred ten years before adult women were permitted to join the parent (sponsoring) organization, Kiwanis International. 
In 1980, the first females were elected to the Key Club International Board. Lisa Cross and Renee Wetstein were elected as Key Club International Trustees. In addition, the first African American was elected to serve on the International Board. Greg Broussard was elected as Key Club International vice-president. In 1996, Craig Melvin was elected as the first African-American president of Key Club International. The 2019 Key Club International Convention&#x27;s House of Delegates voted to change all references of gender-specific pronouns (i.e., he/him/his or she/her/hers) to the neutral they/them/their pronoun set throughout all of the organization&#x27;s bylaws. During the same session, the delegation passed a resolution to change the phrase &quot;&quot;...my nation and God...&quot; to &quot;...my nation and world...&quot;&quot; in the Key Club Pledge; the Kiwanis Youth Programs Board of Directors, directed by the International Guidebook to review any votes from the House of Delegates, approved the changes.

===Present===
Key Club International is composed of 32 organized Districts with an additional District in formation (Western Canada). Key Club International is currently in 38 countries. As of 2020, Key Club International includes 229,652 members and 4,841 paid clubs.

Key Club International itself employs three full-time staff members and utilizes the services of nearly 120 additional specialists employed by Kiwanis International—all are employed at Kiwanis International headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana.

==Activities==
Key Club offers a range of services to its members: leadership development, study-abroad opportunities, vocational guidance, college scholarships, a subscription to the Key Club magazine, and liability insurance.

In 2002 Key Club officially adopted &quot;caring, character building, inclusiveness, and leadership&quot; as the core values of the organization.

The organization maintains partnerships with UNICEF, AYUSA Global Youth Exchange, the March of Dimes, and Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Telethon. Through the partnership with UNICEF, a major initiative was launched in 1994 to address HIV/AIDS education and prevention in Kenya.

===Theme of the Major Emphasis===
At Key Club International&#x27;s first convention in 1946, the organization began to branch out internationally.

&quot;Children: Their Future, Our Focus&quot; is Key Club International&#x27;s Major Emphasis theme. Officially, any project conducted by members or clubs that serve needy children locally or globally is considered a project of the Major Emphasis. The three preferred charities of Key Club International are paramount to the organization&#x27;s success in serving children. These are the U.S. Fund for UNICEF, March of Dimes, and Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals. Key Clubs contribute to a global organizational total of more than 12 million hours of hands-on service and millions of dollars donated to the aforementioned partners and other programs.

Recently, the Kiwanis International has dedicated itself to eliminating the risk of Maternal/Neonatal Tetanus (MNT) from the face of the earth. The disease plagues mothers and newborns in 40 countries worldwide, and while an effective vaccine has been developed, MNT claims nearly 100,000 lives each year. As part of the Kiwanis International mission to end MNT, Key Club International has pledged all proceeds from its members&#x27; Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF projects to the $110 million funding gap the Kiwanis International Foundation is working to correct.

====Service Initiative====
The Service Initiative is a program encouraging hands-on service to children aimed towards a common goal. It is changed every two years by the International Board of Trustees.

The 2004–2006 Service Initiative was &quot;Child Safety: Water, Bike and Car Safety&quot;, where Key Clubbers participated in different educational events to try to spread safe habits to prevent accidental deaths.

The 2006–2008 Service Initiative was &quot;High Five for Health&quot;. It is aimed at reducing childhood obesity and fighting a rising trend that appears to increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease.

The 2008–2010 Service Initiative is &quot;Live 2 Learn&quot;. It is focused on 5-to-9-year-old youth, with the main goals of promoting education and building literary skills.

In 2011, the Service Initiative concept was abolished by a vote of the Key Club International Board. It was decided that the freedom of selecting any project in keeping with the theme of &quot;Children: Their Future, Our Focus&quot; would allow for greater success for member clubs and their dedications to service.

===Key Club Week===
During the first full week of November, known as Kiwanis Family Month, Key Clubs worldwide celebrate Key Club Week. In seven days, Key Clubs are encouraged to grow and serve through themed days like &quot;Show Your K in Every Way&quot;, &quot;Konnect the Ks&quot;, &quot;Kudos to the Key Players&quot;, and more. The week has been designed to become the organization&#x27;s primary membership drive worldwide with the belief that more members will translate to more service and further goals of adolescent support worldwide.

=== Colors ===
The official colors are blue, gold and white.   
* Blue means unwavering character
* Gold means service
* White means purity

==Structure and governance==
The Key Club District organization is patterned after the original Florida District and its parent Kiwanis Districts. These organizations hold their own annual conventions for fellowship, to coordinate the efforts of individual clubs, to exchange ideas on Key Clubbing, and to recognize outstanding service of clubs or individuals with appropriate awards.

Key Club exists on more than 5,000 high school campuses, primarily in the United States and Canada. It has grown internationally to the Caribbean nations, Central and South America, and most recently to Asia and Australia. Clubs exist in Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Canada, Cayman Islands, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, Ecuador, England, Germany, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Hungary, Italy, Jamaica, Malaysia, Martinique, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Panama, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, St. Lucia, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, the United Arab Emirates and the United States of America.

Key Club International is an organization of individual Key Clubs and is funded by nominal dues paid by every member. Offices/positions are most often elected (or otherwise appointed by elected officers) and are held by high school students aged 14–18 years old. 

===International===
Key Club International encompasses all clubs within the 33 organized Districts and in foreign countries that are not included in any specific District. Key Club International is led by the International Board of Trustees, which is typically composed of the International President, International Vice-President, and 11 International Trustees (Trustees being assigned to three Districts and also assigned to serve on various committees within the board). Furthermore, the International Council is composed of the International Board, as well as the District Governor from each of the 33 organized Districts. International Board members are elected at the annual international convention, also known as ICON.

The 2022-2023 International committees include the Executive committee, which focuses on bylaws and policies, proposals for the Kiwanis Youth Programs Board, International Competition, the Strategic Plan, and more; In addition, the global relations committee has a heavy focus on growth abroad, supporting international districts, and nondistricted/district-in-formation club communication. 

Finally, the programs and partners committee aim to connect Key Club International with other branches of the K-family, bridge the gap between KCI and our service partners, and to shape annual programs.

===District===
A Key Club District is normally defined by state or nation and tends to match a similar Kiwanis District. Each District is chaired by a Governor, elected by delegates to an annual convention. The District is divided into Divisions which tend to, but do not necessarily match Kiwanis Divisions.

Each District and District-in-Formation is led by a group of students comprising the District Board of Trustees. The Executive District Board commonly includes the Governor, Secretary, Treasurer (or Secretary-Treasurer), and Editor. Along with these positions, the Illinois Eastern Iowa District has a Statistical Secretary. Each District Board also includes one Lieutenant Governor per Division to serve the geographically smaller areas. Whereas one Governor may oversee the operations of an entire District (often the size of one or more states in the United States or a nation in the Caribbean), Lieutenant Governors oversee areas typically including 4–15 clubs. All officers are elected by the students they serve.

==== Governor (District Governor) ====
The District Governor is the highest-ranking student leader in a District and represents the District at all international events. Responsibilities include overseeing the District Board and ensuring the District&#x27;s progress in its practical and fundraising goals.

==== District Secretary ====
The District Secretary&#x27;s primary responsibilities include maintaining records for a District (meeting minutes, monthly report forms, etc.).

==== District Treasurer ====
The District Treasurer&#x27;s primary responsibilities include preparing financial reports for a District, including but not limited to information about the progress of the District&#x27;s Key Clubs in dues payment, and sending dues notifications to Key Clubs throughout the year.

==== District Secretary-Treasurer ====
The District Secretary-Treasurer&#x27;s primary responsibilities are those of the District Secretary (maintaining records for a District) and District Treasurer (preparing financial reports and sending dues notifications). Districts without both a District Secretary and District Treasurer often opt for a District Secretary-Treasurer.

==== District Bulletin Editor ====
The District Bulletin Editor&#x27;s primary responsibility is to produce at least two major District publications to be sent to all Key Clubs in the District.

==== District Webmaster ====
The District Webmaster&#x27;s primary responsibility is to maintain the website for the District.

===Division===
Districts are divided into multiple smaller geographic regions which are typically called Divisions. Each Division is made up of several clubs and is usually led by a single Lieutenant Governor.

==== Lieutenant governor ====
A lieutenant governor (LTG) is elected to lead and represent a single division in a district. The lieutenant governor serves as a liaison between individual high school clubs in their division and the district board. In addition to fulfilling the responsibilities of a Key Club member, lieutenant governors must also visit each of the clubs they serve, publish a monthly divisional newsletter, hold regular division council meetings or officer council meetings, collaborate with other lieutenant governors to organize training conferences, and keep in contact their with clubs, district executive board, and Kiwanis counterparts. A lieutenant governor may initiate community service projects to help the members of the division become more involved. A lieutenant governor may choose to create a division leadership team to delegate some of these responsibilities.

The lieutenant governor is responsible for oversight of, on average, 4–15 high school Key Clubs. Depending on the procedures and bylaws of their respective district, one of the lieutenant governor&#x27;s duties may be planning an election near the end of their term to determine their successor.

The lieutenant governor&#x27;s role on the district board is to act as a representative of their governing division. Lieutenant governors make up the majority composition of the district board, with over sixty members in some larger districts. Changes and adoption of policies are debated by the board and can be approved by a simple majority vote.

===Clubs===
Individual Key Clubs are the foundation upon which Key Club International is built; they are the direct or indirect beneficiary of all policy initiatives within Key Club International. The following are officer positions that Key Club International offers handbooks for: club president, club vice president, club secretary, club treasurer, club bulletin editor, and club webmaster. 

Financially, every Key Club member pays $7 to Key Club International and up to $7 to their District through dues, depending on the District (for a total of up to $14). Club dues are paid through Kiwanis International&#x27;s Membership Update Center. Key Clubs are assigned statuses by Kiwanis International indicating the timeliness of club dues submission, as shown in the following diagram:

==Elections==
Key Club is one of the only internationally structured high school organizations led by high school students. There are four distinct levels in the organization&#x27;s leadership hierarchy: International, District, Division, and Club. Some districts also have their divisions clustered in another optional structure called a Region, though this is not a standard part of a general district structure.

=== International ===
International officers are elected at the &quot;International Convention&quot; (ICON) each summer during the meeting of the &quot;House of Delegates&quot;.

In caucusing sessions held prior to the house of delegates, no more than two international president (IP) and international vice president (IVP) candidates and no more than 14 international trustee (IT) candidates are nominated for election. While only 11 positions for trustee are available, 14 are nominated for election; organization bylaws dictate that the minimum number of trustee candidates on the ballot “...shall not be less than the number to be elected plus one and not more than the number to be elected plus three...” notwithstanding cases of dual nomination of president or vice president candidates where the minimum number could increase up to 16.

During international elections, district-endorsed candidates (no more than 2 from each district) for IP, IVP, and IT caucus in district-based rooms, sharing their platform and taking questions. After caucusing, Key Club members nominate 14 to proceed to the house of delegates. This number may be reduced if dual nomination for an IP or IVP candidate is considered. At the house of delegates, the international president, vice president, and 11 trustees are elected to the board by delegate votes. 

Each club present at the convention can send no more than two delegates to the house of delegates where, in addition to any resolutions or bylaw amendments to be considered, the international president, vice president, and trustees are elected. The current international board, all district governors, and all immediate past district governors are delegates at large, meaning they can vote independent of their club.

=== District ===
District-level positions are often elected at annual district conventions (typically held in March or April), where Key Club members, advisors, Kiwanis members, and guests are in attendance. Activities often include forums and workshops facilitated by district board members; awards and recognition ceremonies; a Governor&#x27;s ball or banquet; a less formal dance; a keynote speaker; and several general sessions for remaining convention business. Caucuses, or questioning periods, are held to elect the new district officers (governor, secretary, treasurer, editor, webmaster, lieutenant governor, etc.) for the upcoming service year.

Many districts name or brand their conventions differently in order to best reflect event goals. For example, a district convention is referred to as &quot;District Leadership Conference&quot; in the Missouri-Arkansas district, &quot;District Educational Convention&quot; in the New England district, &quot;District Leadership Training Conference&quot; in the New York district, &quot;District Convention/Leadership Conference&quot; in the Pennsylvania district and &quot;District Education and Leadership Conference&quot; in the Florida district.

=== Region ===
A region may consist of multiple divisions, but they are not a construct of Key Club International bylaws. There are no internationally defined positions at the regional level. Implementations of regions may vary between districts that utilize them. 

=== Division ===
Lieutenant Governors are typically elected at either a division level or at a district convention, though this varies depending on each district&#x27;s bylaws. Division elections may also include divisional committees or other leadership roles, again varying by each district&#x27;s own bylaws or preferences.

=== Club ===
The president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, bulletin editor and webmaster (or technology-associated position) of the club should be elected each year in February. While not taking office until May, the intent of the early election is to allow for role-based shadowing and knowledge-transfer from existing officers over to officers-elect. In between club elections and the date that officers-elect assume their positions, there are district conferences or conventions where future officers can be trained and advised on how to best work in their upcoming role.

The webmaster has different duties depending on the District they hail from. The webmaster is typically responsible for creating, updating, and maintaining the district&#x27;s website.

<doc id="980688" wikidata="Q2311027" url="?curid=980688" title="Spiral approach">
<text>:&quot;See also spiral model&quot;, a software development approach.

The spiral approach is a technique often used in education where the initial focus of instruction is the basic facts of a subject, with further details being introduced as learning progresses. Throughout instruction, both the initial basic facts and the relationships to later details are repeatedly emphasized to help enter into long-term memory. This principle is somewhat similar to the inverted pyramid method used in writing news stories, and the game 20 questions.

Jerome Bruner proposed the spiral curriculum as a teaching approach in which each subject or skill area is revisited at intervals, at a more sophisticated level each time. First, there is basic knowledge of a subject, then more sophistication is added, reinforcing principles that were first discussed. This system is used in China and India. Bruner&#x27;s spiral curriculum, however, draws heavily from evolution to explain how to learn better, and thus it drew criticism from conservatives. In the United States classes are split by grade — life sciences in 9th grade, chemistry in 10th, physics in 11th. The spiral teaches life sciences, chemistry, physics all in one year, then two subjects, then one, then all three again to understand how they mold together. Bruner also believes learning should be spurred by interest in the material rather than tests or punishment, since one learns best when one finds the acquired knowledge appealing.

<doc id="980697" wikidata="Q320121" url="?curid=980697" title="World Student Christian Federation">
<text>The World Student Christian Federation (WSCF) is a federation of autonomous national Student Christian Movements (SCM) forming the youth and student arm of the global ecumenical movement. The Federation includes Orthodox, Protestant and Catholic students.

Together with the YMCA and the YWCA, WSCF has as a foundational document, the Paris Basis. WSCF&#x27;s aims include &quot;to call members of the academic community to faith in God, to discipleship within the life and mission of the Church and to help them strive for peace and justice in and among nations.&quot; At one point &quot;the evangelisation of the world in this generation&quot; was seen as the main aim. Throughout its history the Federation has brought students together across theological and cultural boundaries and provided training and opportunities. For over a century WSCF has supplied leaders to the Church, the ecumenical movement and the Christian left, governments and social movements.

Together the WSCF and SCM provide a context for young Christians from all churches and nations to meet. The motto of the WSCF is &quot;&quot;—&quot;that they all may be one&quot; ().

==History==
WSCF was formed at a meeting of student leaders from ten North American and European countries in 1895 at Vadstena Castle, Sweden. The founders included John R.

WSCF was the first international student organisation. Together with YMCA and YWCA, it is among the oldest extant youth movements. WSCF is known in French as FUACE——and in Spanish as FUMEC—.

Forces affecting WSCF have been:
* the rise of the ecumenical movement,
* the turbulence of the 1960s student movements,
* the mid-twentieth century shift in balance of power from liberal to evangelical Christianity,
* the shift in balance of influence within Christianity between the developed and the developing world,
* the pressures of maintaining unity across the spectrum of Christianity

Notable leaders of the WSCF have included:
* John R. Mott
* Nathan Söderblom
* Willem Visser &#x27;t Hooft
* Philip Potter
* Alan Brash

The WSCF newsletter &quot;Federation News&quot; started in 1921 and is published twice a year. The WSCF journal &quot;Student World&quot; was begun in 1908 but has had a broken history of publication.

==Purpose==
The mission and vision statement of the WSCF is:
* The WSCF is a global community of Student Christian Movements committed to dialogue, ecumenism, social justice and peace.
* the mission is to empower students in critical thinking and constructive transformation of our world by being a space for:
** Prayer and celebration
** Theological reflection
** Study and analysis of social and cultural processes and
** Solidarity and action across boundaries of culture, gender and ethnicity.
* Through the work of the Holy Spirit, the WSCF is called to be a prophetic witness in church and society. This vision is nurtured by a radical hope for God’s Reign in history.

WSCF&#x27;s founder, the Methodist layman and YMCA worker John R. Mott (1865-1955), promoted Protestant unity in 1895 as an organization joining youth from all Protestant churches to dedicate themselves to the &#x27;evangelization of the world in this generation.&#x27;&quot; 

==Structure and activities==

===WSCF globally===

The General Assembly (GA) is the highest decision making body of the Federation. WSCF&#x27;s GA is held approximately every four years. Recent assemblies have been held in Montreal, Canada, Chiang Mai, Thailand, Beirut, Lebanon, and Yamoussoukro, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire.

The GA is made up of representatives from all affiliated and associated movements. The GA reviews the previous four years, plans for the next four years and elects the Executive Committee, Chairperson, Vice-Chairpersons, Treasurer and General Secretary.

The 35th GA was held in Bogota, Colombia from February 27 to March 5, 2015.

The Executive Committee and staff (General Secretary and Regional Secretaries) co-ordinate the Federation&#x27;s activities between General Assemblies. The Executive Committee has met in Chiang Mai, Thailand, Porto Alegre, Brazil and Alexandria, Egypt.

The General Secretary is based in the Inter-Regional Office (IRO) in Geneva, Switzerland. The IRO is in the Ecumenical Centre which also houses the World Council of Churches, the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, the Lutheran World Federation, the Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance, the Conference of European Churches, Ecumenical News International, Action by Churches Together International, and many other organisations.

The IRO organises the General Assembly and Executive Committee, the IRO staff is the secretariat for WSCF&#x27;s endowment &quot;The Centennial Fund&quot;. The IRO administers WSCF&#x27;s income, salaries and fundraising and co-ordinates global WSCF programmes, the IRO administers the Ecumenical Assistance Programme, the Universal Day of Prayer for Students, produces &quot;Federation News&quot; and &quot;Student World&quot; maintains contact with national movements and &quot;Senior Friends&quot; and organises WSCF representation at meetings of the United Nations, UNESCO, World Council of Churches and other organisations.

===WSCF Regions===
Until the 1960s, the WSCF was centralized in Geneva. This shifted in 1972, when the Federation divided into six regional offices with Geneva remaining as an inter-regional office. Each region has a regional secretary, officers and a committee made up of representatives from the national movements in the region. Each region has its own programmes and publications. The regions nominate students to participate in global WSCF programmes and other activities. Each region has two representatives on WSCF&#x27;s global Executive Committee. The six regions are Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America and Caribbean, Middle East, and North America. The regional offices are in Nairobi, Hong Kong, Trento, Buenos Aires, Beirut and New York.

===National Student Christian Movements===
WSCF&#x27;s ecumenical work operates at a national level through the Student Christian Movement (SCM). Each national SCM has ties to the ecumenical bodies such as the World Council of Churches, and other national ecumenical organizations such as the National Council of Churches in Australia and the Christian Conference of Asia.

Whilst national SCMs may vary considerably, they have tended to foster liberal and progressive religious and social views amongst university students. This resulted in conflicts with evangelical student groups, such as those affiliated to the parachurch International Fellowship of Evangelical Students.

National SCMs include the Student Christian Movement of Great Britain, Student Christian Movement of the Philippines, Student Christian Movement of Canada, and Indonesian Christian Student Movement.

<doc id="980704" wikidata="Q61482" url="?curid=980704" title="Nikolaus Federmann">
<text>Nikolaus Federmann (, ) (c. 1505, Ulm – February 1542, Valladolid) was a German adventurer and conquistador in what is modern-day Venezuela and Colombia. He is a significant figure in the history of Klein-Venedig (1528–1546), the concession of Venezuela Province that Charles I of Spain granted to the Welser banking family and the foundation of Santafe de Bogotá.

== Life ==
Nikolaus Federmann was born in Ulm (Baden-Württemberg) around 1505. In 1529, he was sent to Santo Domingo by the Welser family of Augsburg, who had signed an agreement to explore the territory of Venezuela. As an agent of the Welser family, Federmann took settlers and miners from Seville to Coro in Venezuela in 1529 and 1530. Upon his arrival the governor Ambrosius Ehinger appointed him as his deputy. On 30 July 1530 Federmann became responsible for the colony of &quot;Little Venice&quot; (&quot;Klein Venedig&quot;). Governor Ehinger temporarily handed over authority to Federmann, because he had to go Hispaniola for health reasons.

Without the authorisation of the Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo, Federmann undertook an expedition in September 1530 in the northern river basin of the Orinoco, searching for the &quot;South Sea&quot; (the Pacific), with 110 foot soldiers, 16 mounted soldiers, and 100 natives. However, he did not achieve his goal to open a new trade route to Asia. On 17 March 1531 he returned to Coro with 5,565 pesos of gold. Because of the unauthorized expedition, the governor Ehinger banished Federmann to Europe for a period of four years.

When he returned to Augsburg, he wrote &quot;Indianische Historia. Ein schöne kurtzweilige Historia Niclaus Federmanns des Jüngern von Ulm erster raise&quot; (published in 1557).

=== Expedition in La Guajira ===
Leaving from Coro in Paraguaná, Federmann left for the present-day territory of La Guajira, in northernmost Colombia. One of his goals was to secure the pearls that can be found in the Caribbean waters at the coast, and one version of history has it that he founded Riohacha in 1535. However, Federmann did not secure native divers to search for pearls, and his mission to found a city he wanted to call &quot;Ulma&quot;, after his place of birth Ulm, failed. Federmann returned to Coro after reaching Cabo de la Vela in February 1536 without having founded a settlement on the Caribbean coast of La Guajira.

=== Foundation of Bogotá ===

From Coro, he traveled along the eastern edges of the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes, through the Llanos and, following the salt trade route, he encountered the eastern part of the Muisca Confederation. Their realm had already been largely conquered and occupied by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, who considered the arrival of another conquistador unpleasant. Together with Sebastián de Belalcázar, Federmann re-founded the city of Bogotá on 27 April 1539. Jiménez de Quesada had failed to fulfill the official requirements of the Spanish Crown concerning the founding of a settlement when he attempted to establish a first Bogotá on 6 August 1538. The three leaders of the conquest expeditions; Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, Sebastián de Belalcázar and Federmann, met in Bosa and agreed to travel back to Spain to ask for compensation for their exploration for the Spanish Crown. Gonzalo assigned his brother Hernán Pérez de Quesada as interim governor of the New Kingdom of Granada and chose the first mayor and council for the capital. The chaplain of the team of Federmann, Juan Verdejo, was named priest. Most of the soldiers of the expeditions of Federmann and De Belalcázar decided to stay in Bogotá, reinforcing the troops of De Quesada. Without having found &quot;El Dorado&quot;, ten years after his arrival in the New World, in mid May 1539, Federmann returned to the Caribbean coast, to sail to Spain from Cartagena. The work &quot;Epítome de la conquista del Nuevo Reino de Granada&quot; reports they arrived in Spain in November 1539, when the Spanish King was crossing France to reach Flanders.

=== Back in Europe ===
In Europe, Federmann was intercepted by the Welser family, who accused him of breaching his contract and suppressing funds. The Welser family demanded a remuneration of 100,000 ducats in emeralds and 15,000 ducats in gold. Since Federmann could not pay, he spent weeks in an Antwerp prison. Federmann tried to defend himself in court, first in Ghent and finally in Valladolid before the Council of the Indies. He filed counter-lawsuits, accusing the Welser family of evading taxes and acting against the interests of the Spanish king. On 19 October 1541 Federmann finally agreed to a settlement. The Welser family abandoned their financial revendications, and Federmann ceded the property rights of his lands in New Granada.

Accused by the Welser family of unfaithfulness, and suspected of being a Lutheran by the Inquisition, Federmann died in February 1542 in prison in Valladolid.

<text>Sophia Amelia Hawthorne ( Peabody; September 21, 1809 – February 26, 1871) was an American painter and illustrator as well as the wife of author Nathaniel Hawthorne. She also published her journals and various articles.

==Life==

===Early life===
Sophia Amelia Peabody was born September 21, 1809, in Salem, Massachusetts, and named after two of her aunts. Peabody&#x27;s father was the dentist Nathaniel Peabody, while her mother was the strong Unitarian Elizabeth Palmer. She had three brothers; her sisters were Elizabeth Palmer Peabody and Mary Tyler Peabody Mann, later Horace Mann&#x27;s wife. Her sister Elizabeth educated Sophia, focusing on geography, science, literature and both American and European history; eventually, she learned to read in Latin, French, Greek and Hebrew; she knew some German, as well.

Sophia&#x27;s health had been questionable since infancy, and she was an occasional invalid. One possible cause was a fashionable treatment her dentist father prescribed for her teething pains that included mercury. In later life, she was a frequent user of calomel and opium to relieve her pain and migraines. When doctors pronounced Sophia had no discernible illness, she sought the &quot;rest therapy&quot;. She left for Cuba on December 4, 1833, with her sister Mary.

===Courtship===
Sophia first met Nathaniel Hawthorne through her sister, Elizabeth. When the author came to visit once, Elizabeth is said to have reported, &quot;He is handsomer than Lord Byron!&quot; When she urged Sophia to come downstairs to meet him, she laughed and said, &quot;If he has come once he will come again&quot;. After meeting her, Nathaniel wrote the tale &quot;Edward Randolph’s Portrait&quot;, which included an artist character inspired by Sophia Peabody named Alice Vane.

Sophia had originally objected to marriage, partly because of her health. They became secretly engaged by New Year&#x27;s Day, 1839.

Sophia gave two of her paintings to Hawthorne in 1840 on the first anniversary of their engagement. &quot;Hawthorne valued the paintings so much that he hid them behind curtains to enjoy when he was alone&quot;.

===Marriage and family===
A wedding was scheduled for June 27, 1842, but was postponed when Sophia fell ill. On July 9, 1842, five years after first meeting, she and Nathaniel were married at 13 West Street in Boston, the Peabody bookstore where Margaret Fuller held some of her &quot;conversations&quot;. The day before, Nathaniel wrote to James Freeman Clarke asking him to oversee the ceremony. &quot;I am to be married to Miss Sophia Peabody tomorrow; and it is our mutual desire that you should perform the ceremony&quot;, he wrote. Both were considered relatively old for marriage (she was 32 and he was five days past his 38th birthday), but the coupling proved happy for both of them. Immediately after their wedding, they rented and moved into The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts. The next day, Hawthorne wrote to his sister, Louisa: &quot;We are as happy as people can be, without making themselves ridiculous, and might be even happier; but, as a matter of taste, we choose to stop short at this point.&quot; Together the couple etched their impressions of their new married life in the glass of a window in the study using Sophia&#x27;s diamond ring:
Man&#x27;s accidents are God&#x27;s purposes. Sophia A. Hawthorne 1843
Nath Hawthorne This is his study
The smallest twig leans clear against the sky
Composed by my wife and written with her diamond
Inscribed by my husband at sunset, April 3, 1843. In the Gold light.
SAH

On their first wedding anniversary, Nathaniel wrote to Sophia: &quot;We were never so happy as now—never such wide capacity for happiness, yet overflowing with all that the day and every moment brings to us. Methinks this birth-day of our married life is like a cape, which we have now doubled and find a more infinite ocean of love stretching out before us.&quot;
The Hawthornes&#x27; first child was born March 3, 1844, after a difficult 10-hour delivery. They named her Una, a reference to &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; by Edmund Spenser, to the disapproval of many family members. Sophia wrote in her journal, &quot;It was a great happiness to be able to put her to my breast immediately and I thanked Heaven I was able to have the privilege of nursing her.&quot; John L. O&#x27;Sullivan served as her godfather and gave her a Newfoundland dog named Leo when she was two months old. Nathaniel wrote that fatherhood brought &quot;a very sober and serious kind of happiness&quot;, and the family began to worry about money. Sophia also had a recurrence of her migraines after Una&#x27;s birth.

The family was soon kicked out of the Old Manse, left with only 10 dollars. They moved in with family on Herbert Street in Salem while Nathaniel awaited a government job appointment. In March, 1846, Sophia moved to 77 Carver Street in Boston to be closer to family and Dr. William Wesselhœft while pregnant with her second child. The couple&#x27;s son Julian was born in Boston on May 22, 1846. His father wrote of the news to a sister, &quot;A small troglodyte made his appearance here at ten minutes to six o&#x27;clock this morning, who claims to be your nephew&quot;.

The family moved to Lenox, Massachusetts, and it was there, in a red farmhouse they rented, that Sophia gave birth to her third child, Rose. Two months prior to giving birth, Sophia claimed she instinctively knew it would be a girl and chose the name Rose. She was born on May 20, 1851, about a month after the publication of &quot;The House of the Seven Gables&quot;. Sophia went into labor early, before the midwife could arrive; Rose was delivered with the help of Sophia&#x27;s father.

Few of Sophia&#x27;s letters from her courtship and early marriage survive. In June 1853, Nathaniel alludes to the destruction of his letters in his journal: &quot;I burned great heaps of old letters and other papers, a little while ago, preparatory to going to England. Among them were hundreds of Sophia&#x27;s maiden letters&quot;.

The Hawthornes raised their children in a positive environment and did not believe in harsh discipline or physical punishment. Hawthorne in 1862 praised his wife: &quot;She is the most sensible woman I ever knew in my life, much superior to me in general talent, and of fine cultivation.&quot; Sophia had a close friendship with Annie Adams Fields, wife of the publisher James T. Fields. In 1863, Sophia wrote to her, &quot;You embellish my life.&quot;

Nathaniel Hawthorne died in May 1864, and Sophia was given the news by her sister, Elizabeth Peabody, who had been informed by Franklin Pierce. Pierce, a close friend of Hawthorne, had been at the author&#x27;s side when he died in his sleep. Sophia wrote about her husband&#x27;s death to Annie Fields: &quot;My darling has gone over that Sapphire sea, and these grand soft waves are messages from his Eternal Rest.&quot; She moved to England four years later in 1868 with her three children.

===Later life, death, burial, and reburial===
After her husband&#x27;s death, Sophia threatened to sue publisher James T. Fields for not paying enough in royalties from book sales. Fields blamed his recently deceased business partner William Ticknor for promising &quot;to pay the highest rate of copyright it ever paid&quot; but that no written contract existed. The two agreed to a compromise as, Sophia said, she preferred &quot;peace to pence&quot;.

Sophia became ill in February 1871, diagnosed with &quot;typhoid pneumonia&quot;. She had difficulty breathing and was cared for by her daughters before dying on February 26. She was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London on March 4. Una wrote to Julian that their mother&#x27;s grave was &quot;on a sunny hillside looking towards the east... We had a head and footstone of white marble, with a place for flowers between, and Rose and I planted some ivy there that I had brought from America, and a periwinkle from papa&#x27;s grave. The inscription is—&quot;Sophia, wife of Nathaniel Hawthorne&quot;.&quot;

Una died in September 1877 at the age of 33 and was buried alongside her mother in Kensal Green. Julian Hawthorne went on to be a moderately successful author writing about his father and other miscellaneous works. He died in 1934. Rose went on to found the Roman Catholic order of nuns, the Dominican Sisters of Hawthorne, based in Hawthorne, New York, where she died in 1926.

Care for the graves of Sophia and Una fell to this organization. When the grave sites were in need of costly repair, it was suggested the remains be moved to the Hawthorne family plot in Concord, Massachusetts. In June, 2006 the two were re-buried alongside Nathaniel in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. A funeral was held for the family&#x27;s descendants with representatives from the Dominican Sisters, and a public ceremony was held at The Old Manse to mark the occasion.

==Artwork==

Sophia Hawthorne was a writer and a painter. Hawthorne&#x27;s art began to evolve steadily after studying drawing in 1824; she further explored this discipline under the tutelage of Francis Graeter, the illustrator of Lydia Maria Child&#x27;s &quot;Girl&#x27;s Own Book&quot;. By 1832, Hawthorne was painting regularly—at first reproducing copies of existing artworks, and later executing landscapes of her own volition. 
 In a letter to her sister Elizabeth in 1832, she wrote:

Sophia Hawthorne&#x27;s artistic endeavors were hampered not only by the restrictive expectations placed upon women of the Victorian era, but also due to the objections of her husband who attempted to &quot;colonize Sophia&#x27;s talents, allowing her to hold the brush in order to paint &quot;his&quot; inner life rather than her own.&quot;

Sophia briefly studied sculpture with Shobal Vail Clevenger and produced a bas-relief medallion portrait of her dying brother George Peabody and, shortly thereafter, a similar work of Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x27;s dead brother Charles. Later, she tutored her daughter Rose in art.

During their courtship, Sophia created an illustration for Nathaniel&#x27;s tale &quot;The Gentle Boy&quot;. After completing it, Sophia asked him if it looked like the main character, Ilbrahim. He answered, &quot;He will never look otherwise to me&quot;. The story was republished with Sophia&#x27;s illustration as &quot;The Gentle Boy: A Thrice Told Tale&quot; in December 1838, subsidized by a Salem hostess named Susan Burley. The book was dedicated to Sophia, inscribed: &quot;To Miss Sophia A. Peabody, this little tale, to which her kindred art has given value, is respectfully inscribed by the author&quot;. When Nathaniel moved to Boston, Sophia painted two landscapes to decorate his apartment. On January 2, 1840, he wrote to her, &quot;You cannot think how much delight those pictures are going to give me... I never owned a picture in my life.&quot; He later asked her to illustrate a reissue of his children&#x27;s book &quot;Grandfather&#x27;s Chair&quot;.

He was the Founding Director of the Mowat Centre in 2009, a Canadian public policy think tank at the University of Toronto. He had previously served as a deputy minister in the Ontario Government and was a professor of Political Science at Queen’s University.

He is currently a visiting professor at Toronto Metropolitan University in Toronto after announcing his decision to leave the federal government in February 2020. He is also a Senior Advisor with Boston Consulting Group&#x27;s Global Public Sector Practice. He lives in Toronto with his wife, Kirsten Mercer, a lawyer and a partner at Goldblatt Partners, and their two children.

==Early life==
Mendelsohn grew up in Montreal, Canada. He graduated from West Hill High School, a public school in the Notre-Dame-de-Grace neighbourhood. He received a B.A. in political science from McGill University and a Ph.D. in political science from l’Université de Montréal. While attending university, Mendelsohn was president of the McGill Debating Union and the Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate, and won the award for Top Speaker at the 1987 Canadian National Debating Championship and the third place speaker award at the World Championships at Fordham University in 1986.

== Academic career ==
Mendelsohn joined the Department of Political Studies at Queen’s University in 1992, following a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of British Columbia. He taught courses and published in the areas of Canadian Politics, quantitative research methods, public opinion and data analysis, democratic institutions, federalism, political communications and elections.

During his time at Queen’s, he was the chief architect of the Portraits of Canada survey conducted for the Centre for Research and Information on Canada, designed the survey for the Globe and Mail’s New Canada Project and served as the Director of the Canadian Opinion Research Archive.

== The Mowat Centre ==
Matthew founded the Mowat Centre in February 2009 in the School of Public Policy &amp; Governance at the University of Toronto with $5M in seed funding from the Government of Ontario. The Mowat Centre had a mandate to advance evidence-based policy solutions relevant to Ontario and informed by issues facing the province.
By 2014, the Mowat Centre had 30 staff members and an annual operating budget of $2.5M, consisting of $900,000 in government and the rest in private funding. It was closed in 2018, three years after Mendelsohn’s departure, attracting media attention. The Munk Centre at the University of Toronto continues to maintain the Mowat Centre website.

== Public Service Career ==

=== Ontario Government ===
Mendelsohn was recruited by Premier Dalton McGuinty and Cabinet Secretary Tony Dean to head up the Democratic Renewal Secretariat in 2004. The main accomplishment of the DRS was the establishment of the Citizens’ Assembly on Electoral Reform. The Assembly was followed by a referendum on a proposal for a Mixed Member Proportional electoral system. The conduct of the referendum was widely criticized as being stacked against change, and the proposal went down to defeat.

Mendelsohn became Ontario’s Deputy Minister of Intergovernmental and International Affairs in 2005.

=== Federal Government ===
Mendelsohn led the polling unit for the Privy Council Office in the aftermath of the 1995 referendum, supporting federal efforts to pass the Calgary Declaration recognizing Quebec’s unique place in Canada, the Social Union Framework Agreement and the Supreme Court Reference on Quebec’s right to secede and the subsequent Clarity Act, outlining the obligations on the part of governments should Quebecers vote to secede from Canada. 

Mendelsohn was appointed the first Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet for Results &amp; Delivery in February 2015. Mendelsohn’s appointment was controversial because he had worked on the Liberal platform.

Mendelsohn’s work became closely associated with Sir Michael Barber’s “Deliverology” approach when Barber and Mendelsohn appeared at the Trudeau government’s first cabinet retreat. Mendelsohn continued to appear at all cabinet retreats, outlining the government’s progress on meeting it commitments.

In November 2017, the government released a public tracker reporting on its progress on mandate letters. Many editorialists were critical of the enterprise, finding the language too bureaucratic and disagreeing with some of the characterizations of whether commitments had been met or not. Mendelsohn himself dismissed these criticisms, insisting that tracking mandate letter commitments was an important part of transparency and accountability. 

During his time in Ottawa, he was identified as one of the most powerful people in the government and referred to as ‘the policy guru’ while being the person responsible for ensuring the Government delivered on its campaign manifesto.

== Justin Trudeau Campaign ==
Mendelsohn took a leave from the Mowat Centre during the spring of 2015. Following the election campaign, he was appointed to Justin Trudeau’s transition team and was involved in Cabinet selection and responsible for penning most of the Ministerial Mandate Letters.

== Community Service and Volunteer Work ==
Mendelsohn has served on many not-for-profit boards, including the United Way Toronto, Civix, Civic Action, and Farm Radio International. He also served as the Chair of the Board for the Council of the Great Lakes Region. Mendelsohn was a founding member of the Banff Forum, speaking at the first two annual meetings and serving on the program committee. He is a certified member of the Institute of Corporate Directors.

<text>Stanley Todd Swift (born April 8, 1966), is a British-Canadian poet, screenwriter, university teacher, editor, critic, and publisher based in the United Kingdom.

==Background==

Swift was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and raised in Saint-Lambert, Quebec. He received a B.A. in English from Concordia University (Montreal) and an M.A. and Ph.D. in Creative and Critical Writing from the University of East Anglia. During his undergrad years he was President of CUSID and one of the top-ranked university debaters of his time. 

Swift is credited at IMDb with being the story editor for anime cult series &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and working on dozens of TV writing assignments for companies like HBO, Fox, Paramount and the CBC. He is the author of nine full collections of poetry; his &quot;Selected Poems&quot; is from Marick Press, USA. He is also an anthologist and editor. His poems have appeared in journals such as &quot;Poetry&quot;, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;Poetry London&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

From 2004-2012 he was Oxfam Great Britain&#x27;s Poet-in-residence. Swift has been a tutor with The Poetry School. He was Senior Lecturer in Creative Writing at Kingston University, England 2006–2013, having previously lectured at Budapest University (ELTE), London Met, and Birkbeck. He has taught at the University of Glasgow. From 2005 Swift has run the literary blog &quot;Eyewear&quot; and since 2012 has been director and publisher of the indie press Eyewear Publishing, founded in 2012. From 2017–2018 he was Visiting Scholar/ Writer-in-residence for Pembroke College, Cambridge, England.

In May 2019 he was nominated for the post of Oxford University professor of poetry, a contest which was won by Alice Oswald.

Eyewear Publishing merged with Black Spring Press in 2019 where Swift now holds the position of Director of Publishing.

==Controversies==

In July 2018, following an interview with the president of the writers&#x27; union the Society of Authors, controversy arose concerning potentially unfair template contracts which they had received, which limited Eyewear Publishing authors from seeking help from the society as neutral moderators in disputes. Swift stated that the contracts were negotiable and the particular clause could be removed if requested. 

In September 2018, feminist organization published an account by poet KC Trommer detailing alleged business disagreements with Swift and Eyewear Publishing.

After he was nominated for Oxford University professor of poetry, poets Claire Trévien and Aaron Kent issued a joint statement calling Swift unsuitable for the role due to &quot;various accounts of his behaviour available with a simple Google/Twitter search, including the Bookseller’s report on his contracts.&quot;

<doc id="980718" wikidata="Q6694021" url="?curid=980718" title="Lowest safe altitude">
<text>In aviation (particularly in air navigation), lowest safe altitude (LSALT) is an altitude that is at least 500 feet above any obstacle or terrain within a defined safety buffer region around a particular route that a pilot might fly. The safety buffer allows for errors in the air by including an additional area that a pilot might stray into by flying off track. By flying at or above this altitude a pilot complies with terrain clearance requirements on that particular flight leg.

== Australian definition ==

* The minimum LSALT is 1500 feet.
* LSALT is 1360 feet above the highest terrain where any obstacle thereon is less than 360 feet above the terrain, or there is no charted obstacle.
* LSALT is 1000 feet above the highest obstacle which is greater than 360 feet above the terrain…………

For example, if there is an obstacle at 200 feet above terrain of 2500 feet, LSALT is 2500 feet (terrain height) + 1360 feet (clearance height), for an LSALT of 3860 feet; if there is an obstacle at 450 feet above terrain of 3600 feet, LSALT is 4050 feet (obstacle height) + 1000 feet (clearance height), or an LSALT of 5050 feet.

The differences in the clearance heights for obstacles is due to the potential for unreported obstacles up to 360 feet which are not marked on maps or charts.

The determination of which is the highest obstacle along the flight path depends on the method of navigation (radio navigation aid, dead reckoning or area navigation systems) and on the flight rules (instrument or night VFR)

==FAA definition==
In the United States in particular, the Federal Aviation Administration calls this concept the minimum safe altitude (MSA), and is defined within the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR):
# &quot;Anywhere&quot;: an altitude allowing a safe emergency landing without undue hazard to person or property on the ground;
# &quot;Over Congested Areas&quot;: an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal distance of less than 2,000 feet; 
# &quot;Over Unpopulated Areas&quot;: an altitude of 500 feet AGL;
# &quot;Over Open Water or Sparsely Populated Areas&quot;: an altitude allowing for a linear distance greater than 500 feet from any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure;
# &quot;Helicopters&quot;: If without hazard to persons or property on the surface, an altitude lower than in definitions 2, 3, and 4 above, provided in compliance with any routes or altitudes specifically prescribed for helicopters by the FAA.

===IFR flights===
There are two restrictions on altitude which are important to IFR flight planning:
# Minimum reception altitude (MRA), an altitude which must be maintained across a flight segment (i.e. between two navigation radio transmitters) in order to assure reception of the required radio signals at all portions of that segment.
# Minimum obstacle clearance altitude (MOCA), an altitude which provides a predetermined vertical clearance from known obstacles within a predetermined corridor along the specified flight segment.
For a published procedure, the greater of these two altitudes is the altitude which must be adhered to during that segment, and is called the Minimum Enroute Altitude (MEA). However, on an IFR en route chart, an asterisk appears next to the MOCA if there is also a MRA on that part of the route that uses a significantly higher altitude. One may choose to fly the lower MOCA altitude, but must keep in mind navaid reception is unlikely. One may do this if utilizing GPS and does not require navaids to navigate and would like the lower altitude. 

These altitudes are listed as &quot;MSL&quot; on IFR planning charts, and are thus the altitudes which would be indicated on the aircraft&#x27;s barometric altimeter.

====Area minimum altitudes====
On Canadian IFR High- and Low-Level charts, area minimum altitudes (AMA) are published for quadrangle areas, which provide a buffer beyond the VFR maximum elevation figure. The AMA is the lowest off-airway altitude to be used under instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) that will provide a minimum vertical clearance of 1,000 feet (AGL), or in designated mountainous terrain 2,000 feet above all obstacles located in the area specified, rounded up to the nearest 100 foot increment.

=== VFR flights===

Since VFR flights are not necessarily conducted on straight lines between ground-based radio navigation transmitters, the altitude restrictions for IFR flights are not applicable. Instead, a VFR flight can be conducted using pilotage, watching landmarks to determine position and desired direction. In this situation, the &quot;minimum reception altitude&quot; becomes moot, and the over-riding concern is for obstacle clearance.

Pilotage in the United States is usually accomplished with the use of sectional charts, which show the ground with considerable accuracy, both for terrain levels and for man-made objects. The charts are marked with World Geographic Reference System or GEOREF grids, and at the center of each grid square a number shows the elevation (MSL) of the highest obstacle within that grid (the maximum elevation figure or MEF). Thus a pilot is alerted of how high he must fly while traversing that grid to assure clearance of all possible obstacles. Then it is up to the pilot to select a cruising altitude which will provide the required clearance above those obstacles.

On sectional charts, man-made obstacles less than 200 feet in height may not be shown.

<doc id="980723" wikidata="Q749412" url="?curid=980723" title="Drimys">
<text>Drimys is a genus of seven species of woody evergreen flowering plants, in the family Winteraceae. The species are native to the Neotropics, ranging from southern Mexico to the southern tip of South America. They are primitive dicots, associated with the humid temperate Antarctic flora of the Southern Hemisphere, which evolved millions of years ago on the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana. Members of the family generally have aromatic bark and leaves, and some are used to extract essential oils.

==Species==
Seven species are currently accepted.
*&quot;Drimys andina&quot; (syn. &quot;D. winteri&quot; var. &quot;andina&quot;) – southern and central Chile and adjacent Argentina
*&quot;Drimys angustifolia&quot; – southern Brazil
*&quot;Drimys brasiliensis&quot; – eastern and southern Brazil, northeastern Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia
*&quot;Drimys confertifolia&quot; – Juan Fernández Islands
*&quot;Drimys granadensis&quot; – southern Mexico south to Peru
*&quot;Drimys roraimensis&quot; – southern Venezuela and northern Brazil, possibly western Guyana
*&quot;Drimys winteri&quot; – southern and central Chile, southwestern Argentina

&quot;D. confertifolia&quot; is endemic to the Juan Fernández Islands, 670 km off the Chilean coast, where it forms a dominant tree in the tall lowland forests and lower montane forests of the islands.

The genus formerly included a number of species from Australasia, including Tasmanian pepper &quot;(D. lanceolata)&quot;. Recent botanical studies have led to a growing consensus of botanists to split the genus into two, with the Neotropical species remaining in genus &quot;Drimys&quot;, and the Australasian species classified in genus &quot;Tasmannia&quot;.

<text>A freezie or a freeze pop is a water-based frozen confection similar to an ice pop. It is made by freezing flavored liquid such as sugar water, fruit juice or purée inside a plastic casing or tube, either round or flat. Freezies come in sealed plastic tubular wrappers and conform to the shape of the wrapper when frozen to serve; as such, they do not need to be stored cold. They also do not need to be frozen as solidly as an ice pop and can have a consistency similar to that of a slushie. Freezies are sold in a variety of flavors, including cherry, orange, lemon-lime, watermelon, cream soda, blue raspberry and grape.

== Name ==
Freezies go by a variety of different names in different regions. The name freezie itself is most commonly used in Canada. Other regional names include freeze pop, freezer pop and Icee in the United States, ice pole and ice pop in the United Kingdom, icy pole in Australia, sip up and Pepsi ice in India, penna-cool in Trinidad and ice candy in the Philippines. Names used in non-English speaking countries include bolis in Mexico and Colombia, polo flash in Spain, chup or marciano in Peru, chup-chup, sacolé, dindim and geladinho in Brazil, shlukim () in Israel, and aiskrim Malaysia in Malaysia.

The name of the prominent brand of freezies is also commonly used as a generic term for freezies in the region. Examples include Otter Pops, Fla-Vor-Ice and Pop-Ice in the United States, Zooper Dooper in Australia, and Mr. Freeze in the United Kingdom and Canada.

== History ==
The first brand to introduce the concept of freezies to the United States was Pop-Ice, which was acquired by Jel Sert in 1963. six years later in 1969, Jel Sert launched its own brand of freezies called Fla-Vor-Ice, which quickly gained popularity and became the company&#x27;s best-selling brand. Otter Pops was founded in the 1970s and grew to dominate the west coast freezie market. In 1996, the company was acquired by Jel Sert, making Jel Sert the largest supplier of freezies in the United States.

In Canada, freezies have been made by Kisko under the Mr. Freeze brand since 1977 when the company started producing them in the Toronto region after the business was relocated from Kingston, Jamaica. In the UK and Ireland, an unrelated brand called Mr. Freeze has been sold since 1966.

== Brands ==
The freezies market is composed of many prominent regional brands with no brands having a large global reach. In the United States, prominent brands of freezies include Fla-Vor-Ice, Otter Pops, Pop-Ice, all three of which are made by Jel Sert. Other prominent brands include Mr. Freeze, produced by Kisko, in Canada, the unrelated Mr. Freeze produced by Calypso Soft Drinks Ltd in the British Isles, Zooper Dooper in Australia, Bon Ice in Mexico, Calippo in the British Isles and Australasia and Polaretti in Italy.

<doc id="980745" wikidata="Q1753547" url="?curid=980745" title="Hypotonia">
<text>Hypotonia is a state of low muscle tone (the amount of tension or resistance to stretch in a muscle), often involving reduced muscle strength. Hypotonia is not a specific medical disorder, but a potential manifestation of many different diseases and disorders that affect motor nerve control by the brain or muscle strength. Hypotonia is a lack of resistance to passive movement, whereas muscle weakness results in impaired active movement. Central hypotonia originates from the central nervous system, while peripheral hypotonia is related to problems within the spinal cord, peripheral nerves and/or skeletal muscles. Severe hypotonia in infancy is commonly known as floppy baby syndrome. Recognizing hypotonia, even in early infancy, is usually relatively straightforward, but diagnosing the underlying cause can be difficult and often unsuccessful. The long-term effects of hypotonia on a child&#x27;s development and later life depend primarily on the severity of the muscle weakness and the nature of the cause. Some disorders have a specific treatment but the principal treatment for most hypotonia of idiopathic or neurologic cause is physical therapy and/or occupational therapy for remediation.

Hypotonia is thought to be associated with the disruption of afferent input from stretch receptors and/or lack of the cerebellum’s facilitatory efferent influence on the fusimotor system, the system that innervates intrafusal muscle fibers thereby controlling muscle spindle sensitivity. On examination a diminished resistance to passive movement will be noted and muscles may feel abnormally soft and limp on palpation. Diminished deep tendon reflexes also may be noted. Hypotonia is a condition that can be helped with early intervention.

==Signs and symptoms==
Central hypotonia accounts for 60 to 80% of all hypotonia in infants. Hypotonic patients may display a variety of objective manifestations that indicate decreased muscle tone. Motor skills delay is often observed, along with hypermobile or hyperflexible joints, drooling and speech difficulties, poor reflexes, decreased strength, decreased activity tolerance, rounded shoulder posture, with leaning onto supports, and poor attention. The extent and occurrence of specific objective manifestations depends upon the age of the patient, the severity of the hypotonia, the specific muscles affected, and sometimes the underlying cause. For instance, some people with hypotonia may experience constipation, while others have no bowel problems.

===Floppy baby syndrome===
The term &quot;floppy infant syndrome&quot; is used to describe abnormal limpness when an infant is born, affecting limbs, trunk, and head. Such condition may appear immediately after birth or during early life as inability to maintain proper posture during movement and rest. In severe cases, hypotonic infants have difficulty feeding, as their mouth muscles cannot maintain a proper suck-swallow pattern, or a good breastfeeding latch.

===Developmental delay===
Children with normal muscle tone are expected to achieve certain physical abilities within an average timeframe after birth. Most low-tone infants have delayed developmental milestones, but the length of delay can vary widely. Motor skills are particularly susceptible to the low-tone disability. They can be divided into two areas, gross motor skills, and fine motor skills, both of which are affected. Hypotonic infants are late in lifting their heads while lying on their stomachs, rolling over, lifting themselves into a sitting position, remaining seated without falling over, balancing, crawling, and sometimes walking. Fine motor skills delays occur in grasping a toy or finger, transferring a small object from hand to hand, pointing out objects, following movement with the eyes, and self-feeding.

Speech difficulties can result from hypotonia. Low-tone children learn to speak later than their peers, even if they appear to understand a large vocabulary, or can obey simple commands. Difficulties with muscles in the mouth and jaw can inhibit proper pronunciation, and discourage experimentation with word combination and sentence-forming. Since the hypotonic condition is actually an objective manifestation of some underlying disorder, it can be difficult to determine whether speech delays are a result of poor muscle tone, or some other neurological condition, such as intellectual disability, that may be associated with the cause of hypotonia. Additionally, lower muscle tone can be caused by Mikhail-Mikhail syndrome, which is characterized by muscular atrophy and cerebellar ataxia which is due to abnormalities in the ATXN1 gene.

===Muscle tone vs. muscle strength===
The low muscle tone associated with hypotonia must not be confused with low muscle strength or the definition commonly used in bodybuilding. Neurologic muscle tone is a manifestation of periodic action potentials from motor neurons. As it is an intrinsic property of the nervous system, it cannot be changed through voluntary control, exercise, or diet.

:&quot;True muscle tone is the inherent ability of the muscle to respond to a stretch. For example, quickly straightening the flexed elbow of an unsuspecting child with normal tone, will cause their biceps to contract in response (automatic protection against possible injury). When the perceived danger has passed, (which the brain figures out once the stimulus is removed), the muscle relaxes and returns to its normal resting state.&quot;

:&quot;...The child with low tone has muscles that are slow to initiate a muscle contraction, contract very slowly in response to a stimulus, and cannot maintain a contraction for as long as his &#x27;normal&#x27; peers. Because these low-toned muscles do not fully contract before they again relax (muscle accommodates to the stimulus and so shuts down again), they remain loose and very stretchy, never realizing their full potential of maintaining a muscle contraction over time. &quot;

== Cause ==
The most common cause of central hypotonia in newborns is hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Brain malformations and inborn errors of metabolism account for 13% and 3% respectively. Causes that affects the central nervous systems are: chromosomal disorders, inborn errors of metabolism, cerebral dysgenesis, and trauma to the brain and spinal cord. Metabolic causes includes: glycogen storage disease type II, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, mitochondrial disease, Zellweger syndrome, Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome, and congenital disorder of glycosylation. Metabolic disorders in infants are usually presented with various other features such as dysmorphic feature, seizures, encephalopathy, biochemistry profile apart from hypotonia.

== Diagnosis ==

The approach to diagnosing the cause of hypotonia (as with all syndromes in neurology) is first localization. The physician must first determine if the hypotonia is due to muscle, neuromuscular junction, nerve, or central cause. This will narrow the possible causes. If the cause of the hypotonia is found to lie in the brain, then it can be classified as a cerebral palsy. If the cause is localized to the muscles, it can be classified as a muscular dystrophy. If the cause is thought to be in the nerves, it is called hypotonia due to polyneuropathy. Many cases cannot be definitively diagnosed.

Diagnosing a patient includes obtaining family medical history and a physical examination, and may include such additional tests as computerized tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, electroencephalogram (EEG), blood tests, genetic testing (such as chromosome karyotyping and tests for specific gene abnormalities), spinal taps, electromyography muscle tests, or muscle and nerve biopsy.

Mild or benign hypotonia is often diagnosed by physical and occupational therapists through a series of exercises designed to assess developmental progress, or observation of physical interactions. Since a hypotonic child has difficulty deciphering their spatial location, they may have some recognizable coping mechanisms, such as locking the knees while attempting to walk. A common sign of low-tone infants is a tendency to observe the physical activity of those around them for a long time before attempting to imitate, due to frustration over early failures. Developmental delay can indicate hypotonia.

MRI Brain is used to rule out structural malformations in the brain or metabolic disorders. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging is used to detect metabolic disorders.

== Treatment ==

The outcome in any particular case of hypotonia depends largely on the nature of the underlying disease. In some cases, the underlying cause is treatable. But in general, treatment comprises providing supportive care with rehabilitation services, nutritional and respiratory support.

Along with normal pediatric care, specialists who may be involved in the care of a child with hypotonia include developmental pediatricians (specialize in child development), neurologists, neonatologists (specialize in the care of newborns), geneticists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech therapists, orthopedists, pathologists (conduct and interpret biochemical tests and tissue analysis), and specialized nursing care.

If the underlying cause is known, treatment is tailored to the specific disease, followed by symptomatic and supportive therapy for the hypotonia. In very severe cases, treatment may be primarily supportive, such as mechanical assistance with basic life functions like breathing and feeding, physical therapy to prevent muscle atrophy and maintain joint mobility, and measures to try to prevent opportunistic infections such as pneumonia. Treatments to improve neurological status might involve such things as medication for a seizure disorder, medicines or supplements to stabilize a metabolic disorder, or surgery to help relieve the pressure from hydrocephalus (increased fluid in the brain).

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke states that physical therapy can improve motor control and overall body strength in individuals with hypotonia. This is crucial to maintaining both static and dynamic postural stability, which is important since postural instability is a common problem in people with hypotonia. A physiotherapist can develop patient specific training programs to optimize postural control, in order to increase balance and safety. To protect against postural asymmetries the use of supportive and protective devices may be necessary. Physical therapists might use neuromuscular/sensory stimulation techniques such as quick stretch, resistance, joint approximation, and tapping to increase tone by facilitating or enhancing muscle contraction in patients with hypotonia. For patients who demonstrate muscle weakness in addition to hypotonia strengthening exercises that do not overload the muscles are indicated. Electrical Muscle Stimulation, also known as Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) can also be used to &quot;activate hypotonic muscles, improve strength, and generate movement in paralyzed limbs while preventing disuse atrophy&quot;. When using NMES it is important to have the patient focus on attempting to contract the muscle(s) being stimulated. Without such concentration on movement attempts, carryover to volitional movement is not feasible. NMES should ideally be combined with functional training activities to improve outcomes.

Occupational therapy can assist the patient with increasing independence with daily tasks through improvement of motor skills, strength, and functional endurance. Speech-language therapy can help with any breathing, speech, and/or swallowing difficulties the patient may be having. Therapy for infants and young children may also include sensory stimulation programs. A physical therapist may recommend an ankle/foot orthosis to help the patient compensate for weak lower leg muscles. Toddlers and children with speech difficulties may benefit greatly by using sign language.

<text>Shuman Ghosemajumder (born 1974) is a Canadian technologist, entrepreneur, and author. He is the former click fraud czar at Google, the author of works on technology and business including the Open Music Model, and co-founder of TeachAids. He was chief technology officer for Shape Security, which was acquired in 2020 for $1 billion by F5, where he became head of artificial intelligence. He is the co-founder and CEO of Reken, an AI cybersecurity startup.

==Early life==
Ghosemajumder was born in Stuttgart, West Germany and grew up in London, Ontario, Canada. He attended London South Collegiate Institute, where he was elected student council president. He earned a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Western Ontario, where he attended after receiving a Canada Merit Scholarship Foundation award as one of the top fifteen students in the country. While in university, he was the North American Public Speaking Champion and president of the Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate. He earned an MBA from the MIT Sloan School of Management. He also earned a brown belt in Goju-Ryu karate.

==Career==
Early in his career, he created the first real-time collaborative graphic design application as a software engineer at Groupware. He was later co-founder of a software development firm, and a management consultant with McKinsey &amp; Company and IBM.

Ghosemajumder worked at Google from 2003 to 2010, where he led product management efforts for protecting their advertising services, worth US $20 billion in annual pay per click revenue, against click fraud. He was one of the early product managers for AdSense, led the launch of Link Units and AdSense for Feeds, and was part of the team that launched Gmail. He was the recipient of two Google Founders&#x27; Awards for significant entrepreneurial accomplishments.

He left Google in 2010 for TeachAids, a non-profit educational technology start-up spun-out of Stanford University, which he had co-founded and where he was chairman. In 2012, he joined Shape Security, which was acquired by F5 in 2020. In 2024, he founded Reken, a startup to combat generative AI-enabled fraud, raising $10 million in seed funding.

==Works==
He is co-author of &quot;CGI Programming Unleashed&quot; (Macmillan, , 1997) and a contributing author to &quot;Crimeware&quot; (Symantec Press, , 2008). His master&#x27;s thesis proposed the Open Music Model, which predicted the use of music subscription services.

In 2011, he was included on the MIT150 list, as one of the top innovators from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<text>Hugh Duncan Lunn (born 1941 in Brisbane, Queensland) is an Australian journalist and author.

==Writing career==

===Early journalism===
Lunn served his journalism cadetship with &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot;. Upon completing his cadetship, he worked overseas for seven years. During 1967 and 1968 he covered the Vietnam War for Reuters. In 1969 Lunn reported on the Act of Free Choice in West Papua while as Reuters correspondent in Indonesia.

On returning to Australia he became Queensland editor of &quot;The Australian&quot;. Over the course of the next two decades Lunn was in turn sacked and re-employed 
by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s newspaper a number of times. Finding himself without employment at the age of 47, he began to pen a memoir about his childhood.

===Author===
Lunn is now famous in Queensland for a number of autobiographical books: in June 2009 he was voted a Queensland Icon as one of 15 &quot;influential artists&quot; in the state&#x27;s history in a list of 15 which included the Bee Gees, Geoffrey Rush, Powderfinger and David Malouf. The best known of his memoirs is &quot;Over The Top With Jim&quot;. Published in 1989, it became the biggest-selling non-fiction book in Australia for 1991. It tells the story of his Brisbane childhood and his friendship with Jim Egoroff and Ken Fletcher. After reading the book Egoroff is said to have visited Lunn and threatened to &quot;punish you for your sins&quot;.

In 1994, A sandstone carving by Brisbane artist Dr. Rhyl Hinwood was erected on the University of Queensland campus to celebrate the publication by UQP of several of Lunn&#x27;s national bestsellers.

In 2015, Lunn was inducted as a Fellow of the Queensland Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Lunn is famous for coining the phrase &quot;there is no such thing as an ex-Queenslander&quot;, which he first used when in November 1979 when discussing with Senator Ron McAuliffe, President of the QRL, on a 90-minute plane trip from Brisbane to Canberra, the viability of a State of Origin series.

In 2019, three off-Broadway performances of The State of Origin Musical! – written by Hugh Lunn with comedian and composer Gerry Connolly – were performed at The Princess Theatre in Annerley Road, Wooloongabba, a stage on which Hugh had debuted as a tap-dancer, 70-something years earlier.

<doc id="980792" wikidata="Q5536568" url="?curid=980792" title="George B. McClellan Jr.">
<text>George Brinton McClellan Jr. (November 23, 1865November 30, 1940), was an American politician and historian. He was elected as the 93rd Mayor of New York City, serving from 1904 to 1909. He was the son of Civil War general George B. McClellan, who was an 1864 Democratic presidential candidate, and ultimately the Democratic nominee in that presidential race.

==Life and career==
McClellan, known to his family as &quot;Max&quot;, was born in Dresden, Kingdom of Saxony, where his parents were visiting. He went to school in Trenton in New Jersey – where his father was Governor – and later Saint John&#x27;s School in Ossining, New York. From 1885 to 1888 he served in the New York Army National Guard. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree at Princeton in 1886 and his Master of Arts in 1889. Princeton, Fordham University, and Union College later each gave him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws.

After graduating, he engaged in reportorial and editorial work at the &quot;New York World&quot; and other newspapers. In 1892 he was admitted to the bar. He served for some time as secretary and treasurer of the New York and Brooklyn Bridge.

===New York City politics===
In 1892, McClellan was elected president of the Board of Aldermen of New York City for the following two years, and for a part of 1894 he served as acting mayor. His success and popularity enabled him in 1894 to be elected as a United States Congressman (as a Democrat), a position he held until resigning when elected mayor of New York in late 1903.

In Congress, McClellan was a prominent member of the Ways and Means Committee. While in Congress he strongly opposed the war with Spain in 1898, and supported President McKinley&#x27;s efforts to find a compromise. A conservative, McClellan spoke in favor of the gold standard, an issue that divided the fiscally conservative from the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party, although he avoided committing himself on the subject in the campaign of 1896 when he supported William Jennings Bryan, a leading silverite.

===Mayor of New York City===
In November 1903, McClellan defeated the sitting mayor, Seth Low (independent Fusion), for a two-year term. He was re-elected in 1905, after the restoration of four-year mayoral terms. The party did not nominate him in 1909 for a third term. 

He is notable in the history of movie censorship for canceling all moving-picture exhibition licenses on Christmas Eve 1908, claiming that the new medium degraded the morals of the community and that celluloid film was an unacceptable fire hazard.

On October 27, 1904, the Interborough Rapid Transit, New York City&#x27;s first subway, opened. McClellan was to start the first train at the City Hall Station, and then hand it over to an IRT motorman. However, he was enjoying himself so much that he refused to give up the controls until the train reached 103rd Street Station.

===U.S. Presidential candidacy===
McClellan ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 1904, receiving 3 votes on the first ballot at the Democratic National Convention.

==Later career==

Throughout his political career, McClellan remained interested in education and in 1906 he was named honorary Chancellor of Union College. At Princeton he delivered the Stafford Little lectures on public affairs (1908–1910), served as university lecturer (1911–1912) and was subsequently 
appointed a professor of economic history.

McClellan served in World War I, entering the Army as major assigned to the Ordnance Department in May 1917. He was honorably discharged in May 1919 with the rank of lieutenant colonel.

==Personal life==

McClellan married Georgiana Heckscher on October 30, 1889.

McClellan died on November 30, 1940, one week after his 75th birthday, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

He is best known for his role as showrunner and executive producer of the television series &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Third Watch&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;Southland&quot;, &quot;Shameless&quot;, &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot;, and &quot;American Woman&quot;, as well as the miniseries &quot;Maid&quot; and the 2024 series &quot;&quot;. He was the developer of the series &quot;Shameless,&quot; which ran for 11 seasons, from 2011 to 2021, on Showtime. His company, John Wells Productions, is currently based at Warner Bros. studios in Burbank, California. He served twice as president of the Writers Guild of America, West (1999-2001 and 2009-2011), and currently serves on the board of governors of the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund (MPTF).

== Early life ==

Wells was born in Alexandria, Virginia, the son of Marjorie Elizabeth (née Risberg) and Llewellyn Wallace Wells, Jr., an Episcopalian minister. He has English, Irish, Scottish, Swedish, and Norwegian ancestry. Wells graduated from the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama in 1979. (A studio theatre at Carnegie Mellon University now bears his name.) While a student at CMU, he became one of the earliest actors to work at City Theatre, a prominent fixture of Pittsburgh theatre.

==Career==

===Television===
In 1986, Wells’s company, John Wells Productions (originally John Wells &amp; Friends) began a longstanding relationship with Warner Bros., one of the most successful television producers in the world.
He was a producer on the film &quot;Nice Girls Don&#x27;t Explode&quot; (1987), joined the writing staff of the short-lived CBS drama series &quot;Shell Game&quot; in 1987, and began writing for television with an episode of &quot;CBS Summer Playhouse&quot; (entitled &quot;Roughhouse&quot;) in 1988.
====&quot;China Beach&quot;====
Also in 1988, he was hired as a producer for the second season of the ABC drama series &quot;China Beach.&quot; The show was created by John Sacret Young and William Broyles, Jr. and focused on combat medics in the Vietnam War. Wells wrote five episodes for the show’s second season and both episodes of the two-part season finale, &quot;The World&quot;.

In 1989, Wells was promoted to supervising producer of the third season of &quot;China Beach&quot; and wrote three of that season’s episodes. In 1990, he returned as a co-executive producer of the show’s fourth (and final) season, and was involved in writing 11 of that season’s episodes, including the series finale.

In his time working on &quot;China Beach&quot;, Wells worked frequently with producer/director Mimi Leder, and she directed six of the episodes he wrote. &quot;China Beach&quot; also marked the start of Wells&#x27;s working relationship with casting director John Frank Levey, editors Randy Jon Morgan and Jacque Toberen and directors Rod Holcomb and Fred Gerber.

====TV movies====
In 1992, Wells co-wrote the teleplay of &quot;The Nightman&quot;, helping to adapt it into a television film from the radio drama by Lucille Fletcher. It tells the story of a young man moving into a hotel that is run by a mother and daughter. Wells was also the film’s co-executive producer; it was directed by Charles Haid. 

That same year, Wells wrote and executive-produced another television film: &quot;Angel Street&quot;, a project that reunited him with several members of the &quot;China Beach&quot; team, including director Rod Holcomb, editor Jacque Toberen, and casting director John Frank Levey. That telefilm was followed by a series, on which Wells continued as an executive producer. He also wrote the screenplay for &quot;Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story&quot;; that project was produced in 1996 and starred Martin Sheen and Moira Kelly.
====&quot;ER&quot;====
In 1994, Wells executive-produced the pilot of the NBC medical drama &quot;ER&quot;, created by novelist Michael Crichton. It was directed by Rod Holcomb (one of Wells’s frequent collaborators), and edited by Randy Jon Morgan (who had edited several &quot;China Beach&quot; episodes), with John Frank Levey serving as a casting director (as he had for &quot;China Beach&quot;).

When the pilot was picked up and the show became a series, Wells served as show runner and head writer. He was credited as an executive producer for all 15 seasons of the series and served as the show runner for the first six seasons. He hired &quot;China Beach&quot; writer Lydia Woodward as a supervising producer and writer. &quot;China Beach&quot; director Mimi Leder also became a supervising producer and regular director. &quot;ER&quot; marked the start of Wells longstanding collaboration with producer/director Christopher Chulack and music composer Martin Davich.

Wells wrote five episodes of the first season and he and the producers were nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series at the 1995 ceremony for their work on the first season. The season was nominated for 23 Emmy Awards and won 8 in total. Wells and Michael Crichton won a Producers Guild of America Award at the 1994 ceremony. Wells and Crichton also received an honorable mention at the Wise Owl Awards in the Television and Theatrical Film Fiction category.

Wells remained show runner for the second season in 1995. He hired his &quot;China Beach&quot; colleague Carol Flint as a co-executive producer for the second season. Wells wrote four more episodes for the second season and he and the producers won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series at the 1996 ceremony for their work on the second season. Wells was also nominated for a Humanitas Prize (in the 60-minute category) and an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for the episode &quot;The Healers&quot;.

Wells remained the head writer for the third season in 1996 and wrote three episodes. Wells and the producers were nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series at the 1997 ceremony for their work on the third season. Wells was again nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for the episode &quot;Faith&quot;.

He continued in the same capacity for the fourth season in 1997 and wrote two further episodes. Wells also made his television directing debut with his screenplay &quot;Carter&#x27;s Choice&quot;. Wells and the producers were nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series at the 1998 ceremony for their work on the fourth season.

Wells returned as head writer for the fifth season in 1998. He wrote both parts of the two-part episode &quot;The Storm&quot; and also directed the first part. Wells and the producers were once again nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series at the 1999 ceremony for their work on the fifth season. Wells stood down as show runner after the fifth season but remained an executive producer and major creative force behind the series. In the 1999–2000 TV season his company Wells productions launched two new series &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;Third Watch&quot;.

Woodward took over as show runner for the sixth season but Wells wrote &quot;The Peace of Wild Things&quot; and wrote and directed &quot;Such Sweet Sorrow&quot;. Wells and the producers were once again nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series at the 2000 ceremony for their work on the sixth season but lost out to Wells&#x27;s other show &quot;The West Wing&quot;. Wells was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for his work on &quot;Such Sweet Sorrow&quot;. He was also nominated for the 2000 PGA Vision Award for his work on &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Third Watch&quot; and &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

Wells continued to write for the seventh season and contributed to two episodes. Wells was nominated for a Humanitas Prize for his work on &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot;. Wells and the producers were once again nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series at the 2001 ceremony for their work on the seventh season and were again beaten by Wells&#x27;s other series &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

For the eighth season Wells wrote two episodes, including the penultimate episode &quot;On the Beach&quot; which featured the departure of longterm cast member Anthony Edwards. Wells was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for his work on &quot;On the Beach&quot; at the 2002 ceremony. He was also nominated for a further Humanitas Prize and a Writers Guild of America (WGA) Award at the 2003 ceremony for the episode.

For the ninth season Wells wrote the final episode &quot;Kisangani&quot;.

He returned in fall 2003 to write three episodes. Wells was again nominated for a Humanitas Prize, this time for his work on &quot;Makemba&quot;.

He continued to handle Carter&#x27;s storylines for the eleventh season and wrote the penultimate episode &quot;Carter est Amoureux&quot; and directed the finale &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; which marked the departure of Noah Wyle (who played Carter) from the starring cast.

For the twelfth season Wells co-wrote the premiere episode. Wells served solely as an executive producer and director on the thirteenth and fourteenth seasons, directing one episode in each season.

He returned as a writer for the fifteenth and final season and wrote and directed the episode &quot;Old Times&quot; which featured several past starring cast members including Noah Wyle, George Clooney, Julianna Margulies, and Eriq La Salle.

When &quot;ER&quot; ended in 2009, Wells had written 31 episodes, and directed 7.

====&quot;Trinity&quot;====
Wells Productions also produced &quot;Trinity&quot;, a short lived NBC family drama focusing on an Irish-American family in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen. Wells served as an executive producer and writer for the series but it was cancelled after only nine episodes due to low ratings. The series won an Emmy Award for composer Martin Davich&#x27;s music. Davich also worked on &quot;ER&quot;. The show starred John Spencer, Tate Donovan and Kim Raver. It also featured Third Watch actors Bobby Cannavale, Skipp Sudduth, and Molly Price.

====&quot;Third Watch&quot;====
Wells co-created &quot;Third Watch&quot; with ex-Chicago police officer Edward Allen Bernero. Wells worked as show runner on &quot;Third Watch&quot; for its first three seasons and served as an executive producer throughout its six-season run. The series focused on emergency services workers across a single shift in New York. The first season began in 1999. Wells and Bernero co-wrote the pilot episode &quot;Welcome to Camelot&quot;.
Wells also wrote the first-season episodes &quot;Sunny, Like Sunshine&quot;, &quot;This Band of Brothers&quot;, &quot;Spring Forward, Fall Back&quot;, and the first-season finale &quot;Young Men and Fire&quot;.

Wells wrote four second-season episodes the premiere entitled &quot;The Lost&quot;, &quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Requiem for a Bantamweight&quot;, and the finale &quot;...and Zeus Wept&quot;. Wells directed the second-season episode &quot;True Love&quot;.

Wells wrote a further four episodes for the third season in 2001 – &quot;September Tenth&quot;, &quot;After Time&quot;, &quot;Adam 55-3&quot;, and &quot;Two Hundred and Thirty-Three Days&quot;. Bernero took over as show runner after the third season and Wells remained attached as an executive producer until &quot;Third Watch&quot; ended in 2005 but did not write any more episodes.

====&quot;The West Wing&quot;====
Wells took over as show runner of &quot;The West Wing&quot; in 2003 for the fifth season. He ran the show for three seasons until its conclusion in 2006.

====&quot;Southland&quot;====
During the 2008 to 2009 television season Wells developed &quot;Southland&quot; for NBC. The series was created by Ann Biderman. It follows detectives and patrol officers in the titular area of Los Angeles. Wells returned as an executive producer for the second season in fall 2009 and co-wrote the season premiere &quot;Phase Three&quot; with Biderman. NBC canceled the series while the second season was in production but the episodes were picked up and aired by TNT.

TNT renewed the series for a third season and Wells remained an executive producer and writer. He again co-wrote the season premiere &quot;Let It Snow&quot; with Biderman. He also wrote the teleplay for the season finale &quot;Graduation Day&quot; from a story by his ex-assistant Heather Zuhlke.

====&quot;Animal Kingdom&quot;====
Wells was a producer, writer and director on the TNT crime drama &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot; from 2016 to 2022. He received a writing credit on five episodes and directed 10 episodes, including the pilot and the series finale.

====&quot;Shameless&quot;====
In 2009, Wells began work on an American adaptation of the British series &quot;Shameless&quot;. Originally commissioned by HBO, the project moved to competing network Showtime, where it debuted in January 2011.

Starring William H. Macy as an alcoholic single father of six children, &quot;Shameless&quot; was the best performing first-year drama in Showtime&#x27;s history. &quot;Shameless&quot; has run for 11 seasons.

In June 2019, Wells signed an overall deal to stay at Warner Bros. Television with two more shows in the works: &quot;Heart of a Lion&quot; from Showtime and &quot;My Ex-Life&quot; for Apple TV+.

He was slated to produce the pilot for the psychological thriller &quot;Red Bird Lane&quot; for HBO Max. However, the streamer ultimately chose not to move forward with the project. Wells is currently working on a pair of dramas from Warner Bros. Television: &quot;Ke Nui Road&quot; and the anthology series take on the book &quot;Things That Make White People Uncomfortable&quot; for HBO Max.

On April 28, 2023, it was announced that Fox has given a straight-to-series order for &quot;Rescue: HI-Surf&quot;. The serie was co-produced by Wells and Fox Entertainment. Wells serves as an executive producer and will direct the first two episodes of the series. It was created by Matt Kester, who also serves as a writer. The series will premiere in the 2024–25 season. In April 2024, Fox place the show a seven-episode back order. The series premiered on the channel in September 2024.

In April 2023, MGM+ ordered ten episodes of the series &quot;The Emperor of Ocean Park&quot; based on Stephen L. Carter&#x27;s best-selling novel of the same name, with Sherman Payne as the writer and Damian Marcano set to direct. The series stars Grantham Coleman, Forest Whitaker and Tiffany Mack. It premiered on July 14, 2024.

Wells serves as an executive producer on the medical drama series The Pitt for the streaming service Max.

===Film===

====&quot;The Company Men&quot;====
Wells made his directorial debut with the film drama &quot;The Company Men&quot;, starring Ben Affleck. The film was scheduled for release in the fall of 2010 but premiered earlier at the Sundance film festival. After the Sundance screening, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said, &quot;Wells has made, for his first film, a tough movie and certainly not a commercial one. This displays the kind of guts he always brought to his television work, which one can only hope continues on in other future film projects.&quot;

====&quot;August: Osage County&quot;====

His second film, &quot;&quot; (2013), which he directed from a script by Tracy Letts, stars Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, and Ewan McGregor. The Weinstein Company released the film in December 2013. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards® including Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role (Streep) and Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role (Roberts).

====&quot;Love and Mercy&quot;====

He next produced &quot;Love and Mercy&quot; the critically acclaimed biopic about the Beach Boys, starring Paul Dano, John Cusack, Paul Giamatti and Elizabeth Banks. The film originally premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2014.

====&quot;Burnt&quot;====
Wells directed the cooking drama film &quot;Burnt&quot;, previously titled &quot;Chef&quot; and &quot;Adam Jones&quot;, in which Bradley Cooper starred as a Paris chef named Adam Jones. Sienna Miller co-starred, along with Omar Sy, Emma Thompson, Daniel Brühl, Alicia Vikander, and Lily James.

<doc id="980794" wikidata="Q5362131" url="?curid=980794" title="Eliza Forlonge">
<text>Eliza Forlong (1784–1859) was an Australian pioneer who played a large part in introducing Merino sheep to south-east Australia.

She was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on 21 October 1784. She was the daughter of Alexander Jack who was a teacher, and his wife Jean, née Mackinnon.

In 1804, Eliza married John Forlong (Forlong or Furlong), a Glasgow wine merchant. By the mid 1820s, four of her six children had died from tuberculosis. The two surviving sons were William Forlonge (b. 1813) and Andrew (b. 1814). John Forlonge decided to move the family to the warmer climate of Australia.

Aware that fine wool from Merino sheep in Saxony, Germany was bringing the highest prices, the Forlonges went to Leipzig to study methods of sheep rearing and wool preparation. Their expertise was enhanced by the use of an instrument to measure wool. Eliza made three trips (of several months each).

In 1828-30 Eliza walked through Saxony buying sheep. She selected the best fine-wool Merinos and drove them to Hamburg for shipping to Great Britain. In 1829, the sheep came to Hobart, Van Diemen&#x27;s Land with son William in the ship &quot;Clansman&quot; and John moved the sheep to Kenilworth Station (), near Campbell Town, Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. In January 1831, Eliza, John and Andrew arrived in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land on the ship &quot;Czar&quot; with the rest of the sheep and joined John. Eliza was also an accomplished golfer in Scotland and her skills were widely known amongst the golfing fraternity.

The farm they established was called &quot;Winton&quot; at Kirklands (), also near Campbell Town. They built sheep houses in the Saxon style, wells, a farmhouse and outbuildings.

Never content with the size and situation of their land grants, the family conducted an &quot;epistolary war&quot; with colonial officials. In April 1834, in an attempt to influence English authorities, Eliza, her husband, John and son, Andrew went back in the ship Norval to Great Britain. John died there in November 1834.

William Forlonge sold Kenilworth and part of their flock in 1838 to the Taylor family.

In the late 1830s, William and Andrew Forlonge moved to the Port Philip District (then a part of New South Wales, but later part of the colony of Victoria). William married John&#x27;s niece Marion Templeton. Eliza lived with William and his family at Woodstock, Merri Creek, near Whittlesea. After some years squatting, Andrew went back to Scotland where he married. They moved to the United States of America and unknown to many people, moved back to England for the last 20 years of his life.

In the early 1850s, William bought the lease of Seven Creeks station from Barnes and Holland near Euroa. Eliza ran the house and managed station affairs in the frequent absences of William and his wife.

Alfred William Howitt, an Australian anthropologist, explorer and naturalist, described her as &quot;one of the pleasantest and most energetic ladies I have ever met with&quot;.

Eliza died at Euroa on 5 August 1859.

In recognition of Eliza&#x27;s contribution to the Australian wool industry and her golfing prowess in Scotland, an annual golf event, &quot;The Eliza Forlonge Memorial Golf Challenge&quot;, is held in December each year at the Euroa and Strathbogie Golf Clubs. Both Golf Clubs are in the vicinity of the Seven Creeks Station and the event serves as a reminder of Eliza&#x27;s contribution to the wool industry and promotes the role of women in golf.

==Recognition==

*In 1933, Eliza&#x27;s part in introducing Victoria&#x27;s first fine-wool Saxon Merinos is commemorated, in a gravestone memorial (Coordinates: -36.843703, 145.624385) on Forlonge Memorial Road, Euroa, Victoria. It is a slab of granite in the shape of a wool pack.
*In 1940, a sundial (Coordinates: -41.928483, 147.494817) was erected in Campbell Town, Tasmania commemorating Eliza Forlong.
*The Farmers&#x27; Arms Hotel Museum at Euroa includes rooms in an old building at Seven Creeks called &quot;Eliza Forlonge Cottage&quot;.
*Eliza was one of the chief characters in a semi-historical novel &quot;Saxon Sheep&quot; by Nancy Adams, a great-granddaughter of Janet Templeton.
* A commemorative mural by Tom Thompson is mounted at Sydney Institute of TAFE, Ultimo, New South Wales.
* In 2013, a statue of Eliza was erected at Campbell Town, Tasmania.

<doc id="980795" wikidata="Q6750212" url="?curid=980795" title="1990 Manitoba general election">
<text>The 1990 Manitoba general election was held on September 11, 1990 to elect Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) of the Province of Manitoba, Canada. It was won by the Progressive Conservative (PC) Party, which took 30 out of 57 seats. The New Democratic Party finished second with 20, while the Liberal Party fell from 21 to 7.

==Background==
The 1990 election took place against the backdrop of the failed Meech Lake constitutional accord, which sought to clarify Quebec&#x27;s position within Canada. The accord, which was signed in 1988, required passage by the federal government and the ten provincial governments before June 23, 1990 to become law. Although Manitoba Premier Howard Pawley had approved the accord in 1987, his government did not bring it before the legislature before their surprise defeat in 1988.

Pawley&#x27;s replacement, PC leader Gary Filmon, was less inclined to support the deal, and requested that certain aspects be re-negotiated before his government would grant approval. After some reluctance, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney allowed re-negotiations with all provincial Premiers, and convinced Filmon to introduce the accord to the Manitoba legislature shortly before the scheduled deadline. Liberal leader Sharon Carstairs and NDP leader Gary Doer were also willing to support the revised deal.

Some members of Doer&#x27;s caucus still opposed the accord, however. When it was put before the legislature, NDP MLA Elijah Harper refused to grant unanimous leave for emergency debate, on the grounds that the deal did not recognize the position of aboriginals in Canada&#x27;s constitutional framework. Harper, the first indigenous member of the Manitoba legislature, was strongly supported by aboriginal leaders such as Phil Fontaine and Ovide Mercredi, and continued his protest in the legislature during the following weeks. With assistance from former parliamentary clerk Gord Mackintosh, Harper was able to delay the legislative process until the accord simply could not be passed on time. Harper became a national celebrity, and polls showed that most English-speaking Canadians supported his stand.

Ironically, Gary Filmon&#x27;s Tories may have benefitted from Harper&#x27;s actions. Filmon was a long-time opponent of the accord, and was a fairly tepid supporter even after the renegotiated compromise was reached. Subsequently, Filmon used the accord&#x27;s failure to highlight differences between himself and Mulroney, who was becoming increasingly unpopular as Prime Minister.

==Issues==
Filmon&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives made the fewest promises of any major party. Their platform called for an end to abuse of the elderly in retirement homes, environmental initiatives, and low-cost economic development. They proposed to cut the size of the Winnipeg City Council, and vowed not to raise taxes.

The Liberals focused on economic issues, promising a major investment in job training, research and development, and business support. They also proposed to cut the Winnipeg Council, create government grants for tourism and adult education, and restore Tory cuts to health and other programs.

The NDP platform focused on workers&#x27; concerns, the environment, preventive health programs and housing. They supported an increase in the minimum wage, affirmative action programs, and laws which would make it expensive to shut down plants in Manitoba. They also promised not to raise taxes, and opposed the sale of Manfor Ltd., a Crown corporation owned by the Province of Manitoba.

==The campaign==
A poll published in the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; indicated that the NDP were the most trusted party on economic issues, followed by the Tories. The NDP were still damaged from their poor showing in the 1988 election, however, and began the campaign in third place. The struggle for government initially appeared to be between the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives.

The Liberals ran a weak campaign, however, and were overtaken by the NDP after a strong performance from Gary Doer in the leaders&#x27; debate. Doer further increased the NDP&#x27;s standing in the last weeks of the campaign by highlighting the connections between Filmon and the Mulroney government on a number of issues. The NDP&#x27;s return to official opposition status was regarded as a major development after their near-collapse in 1988.

==Opinion polls==

==Results==
The Tories continued their dominance in Manitoba&#x27;s rural south, winning every seat in the region. They also won 13 of 31 seats in Winnipeg and a few ridings to the city&#x27;s immediate north, enough to provide the party with a majority of two.

The NDP won 11 seats in Winnipeg, and swept the province&#x27;s north. They also won four seats in the mid-northern region, and retained Brandon East, their lone southern riding outside of Winnipeg.

All seven seats retained by the Liberals were in Winnipeg, mostly in the centre and northwest of the city. With few exceptions, many of the centre-left voters who had voted Liberal in 1988 switched back to the NDP.

1 &quot;Before&quot; refers to standings in the Legislature at dissolution, and not to the results of the previous election. These numbers therefore reflect changes in party standings as a result of by-elections and members crossing the floor.

He was a Judge of the Mississippi Circuit Court for the Fifth Judicial District from 1947 to 1950. He was a justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court in 1950. He was Mississippi Attorney General from 1950 to 1956. He was the 52nd Governor of Mississippi from 1956 to 1960. He was a Member of the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1960 to 1964. He was in private practice in Choctaw County, Mississippi from 1960 to 1965.

===Little Congress===

During his service with Congressman Ford, in Washington, D.C., Coleman made a name for himself by challenging and defeating another young southern congressional staffer, future President Lyndon B. Johnson, for Speaker of the Little Congress, a body that Johnson had dominated before Coleman&#x27;s challenge. Coleman and Johnson became lifelong friends.

==Gubernatorial service==

Coleman became the Governor of Mississippi in 1956 as a moderate candidate in a campaign where he promised to uphold segregation. As Governor, he befriended Democratic presidential candidate, Senator John F. Kennedy, but set up the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission. When Clennon Washington King, Jr. attempted to integrate the University of Mississippi, Coleman went to Oxford to prevent King&#x27;s matriculation and fulfill his promise of segregation of all schools. He objected to being called a moderate by his critics, preferring to characterize himself as a &quot;successful segregationist&quot;.

==Unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign==

In his subsequent campaign for governor in 1963, Coleman lost the Democratic nomination to Paul B. Johnson, Jr., a son of a former governor. Segregationist Johnson painted Coleman as a racial moderate and friend of the Kennedy administration. Paul Johnson&#x27;s campaign staff charged that during the 1960 presidential campaign Coleman had allowed Kennedy to sleep in the Governor&#x27;s Mansion in the bed formerly used by the late Governor and United States Senator Theodore Bilbo. Johnson went on to defeat the Democrat-turned-Republican Rubel Phillips in the 1963 general election, which presented Mississippi voters with a new-at-the-time opportunity to choose between candidates of different parties.

==Federal judicial service==

President Kennedy offered Coleman various posts, including United States Secretary of the Army and United States Ambassador to Australia, but Coleman declined.

Coleman was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson on June 22, 1965, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated by Judge Benjamin Franklin Cameron. Even though controversy erupted over his pro-segregation positions such as his opposition to Blacks voting, he was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 26, 1965, and received his commission on July 26, 1965.

He served as Chief Judge from 1979 to 1981. He assumed senior status on May 31, 1981. His service terminated on January 31, 1984, due to his retirement.

==Post judicial service and death==

After his retirement from the federal bench, Coleman returned to the private practice of law in Choctaw County and also farmed until he suffered a severe stroke on December 11, 1990. He died on September 28, 1991, in Ackerman.

==Honor==

J. P. Coleman State Park, a state park in Mississippi, is named after him.

==Personal==

Coleman&#x27;s grandson, Josiah D. Coleman is a justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court.

<text>Staples Canada ULC, operating as Staples (Bureau en Gros in Quebec), is a Canadian retail sales company owned by Sycamore Partners. Staples was founded by Leo Kahn and Thomas G. Stemberg. Since 2017, Staples Canada has operated independently from Staples&#x27; U.S. retail and U.S. business-to-business (B2B) operations.

==History==
The Business Depot Ltd. was founded by Jack Bingleman in 1991, with Staples as a substantial investor, opening Business Depot stores in Canada. The American counterpart acquired the Canadian company in 1994. 

The company would operate in English-language markets under the co-branding &quot;Staples Business Depot&quot;, although stores in the Greater Toronto Area initially continued to operate under the &quot;Business Depot&quot; banner. The presence of Business Depot resulted in trademark issues when competitor Office Depot expanded into Canada: in 1993, Staples obtained an injunction preventing the Office Depot name from being used in Ontario, and thus its stores were operated under the name &quot;The Office Place&quot; instead. The two companies reached a settlement in May 2001, allowing Office Depot to begin using its name on store brand products in Ontario in September 2001, and on store signage in June 2002.

In 2008, Staples acquired Corporate Express. In February 2015, Staples announced its intent to acquire Office Depot (which had also recently merged with Grand &amp; Toy owner OfficeMax); on December 7, 2015, both the Competition Bureau and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission announced that they would move to block the merger under antitrust grounds.

In 2017, Staples was acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners for $6.9 billion. Under the new owner, Staples Inc. was split into three &quot;independently managed and capitalized&quot; entities; Staples Canada serves as one of these entities, alongside Staples North American Delivery and Staples U.S. Retail.

In December 2018, Staples Canada unveiled a new logo, and the new slogan &quot;Work. Learn. Grow&quot;. The rebranding was accompanied by a new store concept, which first launched in Montreal and at its 375 University Avenue flagship store in Toronto. They feature demo areas with curated selections from various product lines (including pens, paper, journals, and consumer electronics), the &quot;Solution Shop&quot; for print and marketing services, and the latter featuring &quot;Staples Studio&quot; co-working areas and an auditorium-style &quot;Spotlight&quot; theatre (which can be rented for sessions and events). With the new concept, Staples Canada began to position itself as &quot;the working and learning company&quot;.

In January 2024, Staples Canada began to participate in a pilot project by the Ontario provincial government to relocate some ServiceOntario locations (which provide government services such as vehicle licensing) from standalone bureaus to kiosks within retail stores. Two Walmart Canada stores are also participating in the pilot. Taxpayer money is being used to cover associated renovations, at an estimated cost of $1.75 million; the Ontario NDP questioned the Doug Ford government&#x27;s decision to enter into a taxpayer-funded sole-source contract with an American-owned corporation to deliver government services.

<doc id="980807" wikidata="Q199551" url="?curid=980807" title="Lake Urmia">
<text>Lake Urmia is an endorheic salt lake in Iran. The lake is located between the provinces of East Azerbaijan and West Azerbaijan in Iran, and west of the southern portion of the Caspian Sea. At its greatest extent, it was the largest lake in the Middle East. It is the sixth-largest saltwater lake on Earth, with a surface area of approximately , a length of , a width of , and a maximum depth of .

By late 2017, the lake had shrunk to 10% of its former size (and 1/60 of water volume in 1998) due to persistent general drought in Iran, but also the damming of the local rivers that flow into it, and the pumping of groundwater from the surrounding area. This dry spell was broken in 2019 and the lake is now filling up once again, due to both increased rain and water diversion from the Zab River under the Urmia Lake Research Programme.

Lake Urmia, along with its approximately 102 (former) islands, is protected as a national park by the Iranian Department of Environment.

==Names and etymologies==
Richard Nelson Frye suggested an Urartian origin for the name, while T. Burrow connected the origin of the name Urmia to Indo-Iranian &quot;urmi-&quot; &quot;wave&quot; and &quot;urmya-&quot; &quot;undulating, wavy&quot;. A more likely etymology would be from Neo-Aramaic (Sureth) spoken by the shrinking number of the ancient Christian population of the nearby city of Urmia, consisting of &quot;ur&quot; meaning &quot;city,&quot; and &quot;mia&quot; meaning &quot;water.&quot; Together, the &quot;water city&quot;, what Urmia city is: a city on the waters of the eponymous lake. The name could also derive from the combination of the Assyrian Aramaic words &quot;Ur&quot; (; a common name for cities around Mesopotamia, meaning &quot;city&quot;) and &quot;Mia&quot; (), &quot;City of Water&quot; referring to the city nearby.

Locally, the lake is referred to in Persian as &quot;Daryâče-ye Orumiye&quot; (), in Azerbaijani as &quot;Urmu gölü&quot; (). The traditional Armenian name is &quot;Kaputan tsov&quot; (), literally &quot;blue sea&quot;. Residents of Shahi Island refer to the lake in Azerbaijani as &quot;Daryā&quot; (, meaning &quot;Sea&quot;).

Its Old Persian name was &quot;Chichast&quot;, meaning &quot;glittering&quot;, a reference to the glittering mineral particles suspended in the water of the lake and found along its shores. The Greeks called it &quot;Spauta&quot; (Σπαῦτα), and also it was probably the same as the &quot;Μαρτιανὴ λίμνη&quot; of Ptolemy.

==Archaeology and history==

Yanik Tepe is a prehistoric site on the east shore of Lake Urmia, that has been excavated in the 1950s and 1960s by C. A. Burney. This area has been settled as far back as 6000 BC. There&#x27;s a large group of sites south of Lake Urmia that have been excavated. They include Dalma Tepe, Teppe Hasanlu, and Geoy Tepe. Hajji Firuz Tepe may have been the earliest of these sites.

Se Girdan kurgans are located on the south shore of Lake Urmia. Some of them were excavated in 1968 and 1970 by O. Muscarella. They have now been redated to the second half of the 4th millennium, although originally they were thought to be much younger.

One of the early mentions of Lake Urmia is from Assyrian records of the 9th century BCE. There, in the records from the reign of Shalmaneser III (858–824 BCE), two names are mentioned in the area of Lake Urmia: &quot;Parsuwaš&quot; (i.e. the Persians) and &quot;Matai&quot; (i.e. the Mitanni). It is not completely clear whether these referred to places or tribes, or what their relationship was to the subsequent list of personal names and &quot;kings&quot;. But the Matai were Medes and linguistically the name &quot;Parsuwaš&quot; matches the Old Persian word &quot;pārsa&quot;, an Achaemenid ethnolinguistic designation.

In the last five hundred years the area around Lake Urmia has been home to Azerbaijanis, Kurds, Persians, Assyrians, and Armenians. The Assyrian of Urmia they speak Northeastern Neo-Aramaic dialects and are religiously diverse, adhering to the East Syriac churches (mostly to the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church), and Protestantism.

==Chemistry==
The main cations in the lake water include Na+, K+, Ca2+, Li+ and Mg2+, while Cl−, SO, HCO are the main anions. The Na+ and Cl− concentration is roughly four times the concentration of natural seawater.

The lake is divided into north and south, separated by the Urmia Lake Bridge and its associated causeway, which was completed in 2008. The bridge provides only a gap in the embankment, allowing little exchange of water between the two sections. Due to drought and increased demands for agricultural water in the lake&#x27;s basin, the salinity of the lake has risen to more than 300 g/L during recent years, and large areas of the lake bed have been desiccated.

==Ecology==

===Palaeoecology===
===Modern ecology===
Based on the latest checklists of biodiversity at Lake Urmia in 2014 and 2016, it is home to 62 species of archaebacteria and bacteria, 42 species of microfungi, 20 species of phytoplankton, 311 species of plants, five species of mollusca, 226 species of birds, 27 species of amphibians and reptiles and 24 species of mammals (47 fossils have been recorded in the area).

Lake Urmia is an internationally registered protected area as both a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and a Ramsar site. The Iranian Department of Environment has designated most of the lake as a national park.

A recent drought has significantly decreased the annual amount of water the lake receives. This in turn has increased the salinity of the lake&#x27;s water, reducing its viability as home to thousands of migratory birds, including flamingo populations. The salinity has particularly increased in the half of the lake north of the Urmia Lake Bridge.

By virtue of its high salinity, the lake no longer sustains any fish species. Nonetheless, Urmia Lake is considered a significant natural habitat of Artemia, which serve as food source for the migratory birds such as flamingos. In early 2013, the then-head of the Iranian Artemia Research Center was quoted that &quot;Artemia urmiana&quot; had gone extinct due to the drastic increases in salinity. However this assessment has been contradicted, and another population of this species has recently been discovered in the Koyashskoye Salt Lake at the Crimean Peninsula.

===Falling level and increasing salinity===

The lake is a major barrier between Urmia and Tabriz, two of the most important cities in the provinces of West Azerbaijan and East Azerbaijan. A project to build a highway across the lake was initiated in the 1970s but was abandoned after the Iranian Revolution of 1979, leaving a causeway with an unbridged gap. The project was revived in the early 2000s, and was completed in November 2008 with the opening of the Urmia Lake Bridge across the remaining gap. The highly saline environment is already heavily rusting the steel on the bridge despite anti-corrosion treatment. Experts have warned that the construction of the causeway and bridge, together with a series of ecological factors, will eventually lead to the drying up of the lake, turning it into a salt marsh, which will adversely affect the climate of the region.
Lake Urmia has been shrinking for a long time, with an annual evaporation rate of . Although measures are now being taken to reverse the trend, the lake has shrunk by 60% and could disappear entirely. Only 5% of the lake&#x27;s water remains.

On 2 August 2012, Muhammad-Javad Muhammadizadeh, the head of Iran&#x27;s Environment Protection Organization, announced that Armenia had agreed to transfer water to counter the critical fall in Lake Urmia&#x27;s water level, remarking that &quot;hot weather and a lack of precipitation have brought the lake to its lowest water levels ever recorded&quot;. He added that recovery plans for the lake included the transfer of water from Eastern Azerbaijan Province. Previously, Iranian authorities had announced a plan to transfer water from the Aras River, which borders Iran and Azerbaijan, but the 950-billion-toman plan was abandoned due to Azerbaijan&#x27;s objections.

In July 2014, Iran President Hassan Rouhani approved plans for a 14 trillion rial program (over $500 million) in the first year of a recovery plan. The money was supposed to be used for water management, reducing farmers&#x27; water use, and environmental restoration. Several months earlier, in March 2014, Iran&#x27;s Department of Environment and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) issued a plan to save the lake and the nearby wetland, which called for spending $225 million in the first year and $1.3 billion overall for restoration.

Starting in 2016, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and Urmia Lake Restoration Program (ULRP) signed up to a project funded by the Government of Japan entitled &quot;An Integrated Programme for Sustainable Water Resources Management in the Lake Urmia Basin&quot; to support ULRP in its goal to restore Lake Urmia. The project set out a multi-disciplinary framework covering several key interrelated areas and aims to have five outputs: 1. An advanced water accounting (WA) system for the entire Lake Urmia basin; 2. A drought management system based on risk/vulnerability assessment and preparedness response for the basin; 3. A socio-economic livelihood programme with viable and sustainable alternatives to current agricultural activities upstream of the lake to reduce water consumption significantly while maintaining the income and livelihood of affected communities; 4. An integrated watershed management (WM) programme; A capacity development programme to strengthen stakeholders at different levels.

The Silveh Dam in Piranshahr County should be complete in 2015. Through a tunnel and canals it will transfer up to of water annually from the Lavin River in the Little Zab basin to Lake Urmia basin.

In 2015, president Hassan Rouhani&#x27;s cabinet approved $660 million for improving irrigation systems, and steps to combat desertification.

In September 2018, A working group tasked with reviving Lake Urmia has started to grow two types of plants to save the region from salt particles. The two plants are &quot;Nitraria&quot; or Karadagh and &quot;Tamarix&quot; or Shoorgaz, which are planted on the land of Jabal Kandi village in Urmia County, to slow down the wind that brings with itself the salt particles.

===Environmental protests===
The prospect that Lake Urmia might dry up entirely has drawn protests in Iran and abroad, directed at both the regional and national governments. Protests flared in late August 2011 after the Iranian parliament voted not to provide funds to channel water from the Aras River to raise the lake level. Apparently, parliament proposed instead to relocate people living around Urmia Lake.

More than 30 activists were detained on 24 August 2011 during an iftar meal. In the absence of a right to protest publicly in Iran, protesters have incorporated their messages into chants at football matches. On 25 August, several soccer fans were detained before and after the Tabriz derby match between Tractor Sazi F.C. and Shahrdari Tabriz F.C. for shouting slogans in favor of protecting the lake, including &quot;Urmia Lake is dying, the Majlis [parliament] orders its execution&quot;.

Further demonstrations took place in the streets of Tabriz and Urmia on 27 August and 3 September 2011. Amateur video from these events showed riot police on motorcycles attacking apparently peaceful protesters. According to the governor of West Azerbaijan, at least 60 supporters of the lake were arrested in Urmia, and dozens in Tabriz, because they had not applied for a permit to organize a demonstration.

The effect of climate change on the lake, has been extensively covered by an Iranian photojournalist Solmaz Daryani.

Lake Urmia had approximately 102 islands. Shahi Island was historically the lake&#x27;s largest. However, it became a peninsula connected to the eastern shore when the lake level dropped.

Shahi Island is the burial place of both Hulagu Khan (one of Genghis Khan&#x27;s grandsons) and of Hulagu&#x27;s son Abaqa. Both khans were buried in a castle above cliffs along the shore of the island.

==Basin rivers==
Lake Urmia is fed by 13 permanent rivers and many small springs, as well as rainfall directly into the lake. Nearly half the inflow comes from the Zarrineh River and Simineh River. There is no outflow from the lake so water is only lost through evaporation.

==In popular culture==
Lake Urmia was the setting of the Iranian film &quot;The White Meadows&quot; (2009).

== Urmia Lake Research Programme ==
Urmia Lake Restoration Program (ULRP) is run by Sharif University of Technology with the following goals:

* Documenting the experiences and lessons learned from the cooperation of the academic community in various stages of studying and implementing solutions to a national environmental challenge in the country.

<doc id="980813" wikidata="Q4596037" url="?curid=980813" title="1 in 60 rule">
<text>In air navigation, the 1 in 60 rule is a rule of thumb which states that if a pilot has traveled sixty miles then an error in track of one mile is approximately a 1° error in heading, and proportionately more for larger errors. The rule is used by pilots with many other tasks to perform, often in a basic aircraft without the aid of an autopilot, who need a simple process that can be performed in their heads. This rule is also used by air traffic controllers to quickly determine how much to turn an aircraft for separation purposes.

The rule is based on the small-angle approximation (which states that, for small angles, sin &quot;θ&quot; ≈ &quot;θ&quot;, where &quot;θ&quot; is in radians), along with the fact that one radian (which is about 57.3°) is close to 60°. In reality a 1 mile in 60 error is 0.96°, and the rule becomes increasingly inaccurate for larger errors. But since even a skilled pilot cannot manually fly with better than about 2° accuracy, and winds are constantly varying, the rule remains useful for most realistic situations.

This rule of thumb is incredibly powerful in the aviation environment. It states that for each degree off (or displacement) over a distance of 60 nautical miles (NM), it will result in 1 NM off course. It can be applied in various areas of interest when flying, and is easily remembered. This proves to be valuable in many different scenarios, en route navigation, approach, and even on vertical profiles.

The math behind this shows that this method is not entirely accurate, with roughly a 5% error, but the rule&#x27;s objective is to get workable numbers in a dynamic environment, and it fits this purpose quite well. Here is the breakdown:

A circle of 60 NM radius has a circumference of:

:2 x 60 x π = 376.99 NM

376.99 divided by 360° produces:

:376.99/360 = 1.047 NM (off by 4.7%)

This rule is therefore very good approximation.

As a coincidence, 1 NM is about 6,000 feet (6,076.1 feet) so we can use the 60:1 rule for this too. For a 1 degree shift at 1 NM, there are about 100 feet of offset.

This becomes very useful for estimating or correcting vertical speed settings and flight path angles (FPA) during climb, descent, or approaches.

If a gradient in % is required, the numbers work out with the same rule:

:1% over 1 NM ≈ 60&#x27;

It is also useful to find out the lateral deviation from a given VOR course or radial: Each dot on a VOR indicator represents 2° of deviation, or 200&#x27; per dot per DME.

There are other applications to this rule. One such application is time drift.

An hour is equal to 60 minutes, and a minute is equal to 60 seconds, so some other relationships between angle and time can be observed.

== Examples ==
If a pilot is flying a leg of 120 miles and finds after traveling 60 miles that he is two miles to the right of track, then a correction of 4° to the left (2° to fly parallel to the intended track and another 2° to bring him to his target) will bring him to his destination.

If a pilot is flying a 120-mile leg and finds after 30 miles that he is two miles left of track, then he has flown 4° left of his intended track, i.e.

:2 × 60/30

left of track. Changing the heading four degrees right will now bring him to parallel the intended track. At that point he still has 90 miles to his next waypoint. He is thus two miles to the left of that and thus the waypoint is 4/3 of a degree (2 × 60/90) to the right, or approximately 1° right. The pilot then adds these two to get 5° and flies 5° right of his previous heading.

One can also use the 1 in 60 rule to approximate distance from a VOR, by flying 90 degrees to a radial and timing how long it takes to fly 10 degrees (the limit of the course deviation indicator). The time in seconds divided by 10 is roughly equal to the time in minutes from the station, at the current ground speed.

<text>Apohaqui ( ) is an unincorporated community in Kings County, New Brunswick, Canada. It is located on the Kennebecasis River at the confluence of the Millstream River extending approximately from Foxhill to a kilometre east of Riverbank Cemetery on both sides of the Kennebecasis, so that it resides in both Sussex and Studholm parishes on the south and north, respectively. 

Apohaqui is home to the Apohaqui Elementary School, Apohaqui Recreation centre and Jones Memorial Park, and Apohaqui Community Church.

==Local Administration==
Apohaqui north of the river resides in the local government district of Butternut Valley, whereas areas to the south reside in the rural district of Kings.

A special service area on the south side delineates properties taxed to help fund the Apohaqui Millstream Recreation Council which operates community facilities on the north side of the river.

==History==
Called Studville at first for Major Gilford Studholme, and later when parish lines were laid out became known as Studholm.

Studholm became a station on the European and North American Railway and was renamed Apohaqui by the railway management. 

The name Apohaqui may originate from the Maliseet word . It may also relate to a Wolastokiyik name for junction of two streams.

The Mi’kmaq settled in the Maritime region about 2500 years ago. They shared what is now New Brunswick with the Wolastokqiyik (Maliseet), who settled along the Saint John River. The Wolastokqiyik made extensive use of this river system to travel, hunt and fish. It is said that they would cover amazing distances by portaging in their canoes. Unlike the Mi’kmaq, who often moved their camps, the Wolastokqiyik built permanent villages. Here they grew corn, beans and squash. Their closest encampment was in Apohaqui, a neighbouring village of Sussex.
The Maliseet people traveled the Millstream and Kennebecasis Rivers in canoes and lived in the village on the low banks opposite the junction of these rivers. For many years since, others found tools and arrow heads used by the Maliseet people.

Major Studholm, in command of Fort Howe, welcomed the Loyalists in 1783 and helped them settle in Saint John and surrounding areas including Apohaqui.
Major Studholm died in 1792 and was buried in an unmarked grave on a hill in Apohaqui. He had no heirs and it was believed he was quite wealthy. People thought that his money was buried beside his grave and his ghost guards it safely. Treasure-seekers dug in the dead of the night in search of the major&#x27;s gold but were frightened by the major carrying his treasure on his ghostly horse.

In the early 19th century, Archibald McDonald started the first school in Apohaqui in a room of a house. He opened his school early in the morning and closed at sundown six days a week. In 1868, the first Apohaqui School was built (this building is now a home).

For high school students to go to school, they had to catch the train to Sussex (this train station is now used as an exhibition building at the 8th Hussars Sports Centre in Sussex).
In the winter, the students would walk to the school trustee&#x27;s house to ask for a half-day holiday to go skating. In the summer the children would swim in the river.
Many people in Apohaqui worked at Jones mill.

The original Jones Brothers Store was built in the 1870s but burned in 1893. The fire burned many important buildings in Apohaqui. The Jones Store was rebuilt.

==Notable people==

It is the hometown of former premier of New Brunswick Frank McKenna and former mayor of the city of Saint John Norm McFarlane.
Apohaqui is located in southern New Brunswick, about 60 kilometres east of Saint John.

<doc id="980822" wikidata="Q1239957" url="?curid=980822" title="Donald J. Albosta">
<text>Donald Joseph Albosta (December 5, 1925 – December 18, 2014) was an American farmer, businessman, and politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. He served three terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1979 to 1985.

Most notably, he was chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service&#x27;s Subcommittee on Human Resources when it investigated the leaking of Jimmy Carter&#x27;s briefing papers prior to the key debate of the 1980 U.S. presidential election. This scandal later became known as Debategate. His chief of staff was Charles Ehrlich who he hired after Ehrlich had worked for an Indiana congressman for 2 years.

==Education and early career==
Albosta was born in Saginaw, Michigan, and attended Saginaw and Chesaning public schools. He graduated from Chesaning Agricultural School, and attended Delta College in Bay City.

He served in the United States Navy, was a farmer, owner, and developer of Misteguay Creek Farms. He served as Albee Township Trustee and was associate director of the Saginaw County Soil Conservation District.

==Political career==

A Democrat, he was Saginaw County Commissioner from 1970 to 1974 and served in the Michigan State House of Representatives from 1974 to 1976, representing the 86th District. In 1976, he first ran for the United States House of Representatives in Michigan&#x27;s 10th congressional district losing to longtime incumbent Al Cederberg. His chief of staff was Charles Ehrlich who he hired after Ehrlich worked for an Indiana congressman for 2 years. Ehrlich worked for Albosta for 6 years serving as his chief of staff for the last 2.

Tenure in the House of Representatives

Albosta sought a rematch against Cederberg in 1978. In a major upset, he narrowly defeated Cederberg to become the first Democrat to represent this district in 84 years. He was reelected twice, serving from January 3, 1979, to January 3, 1985.

As a member of the Public Works and Transportation Committee, among others, Rep. Albosta offered amendments that improved the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, popularly known as &quot;Superfund&quot; including a provision requiring the Center for Disease Control to study the health histories of victims of exposure to hazardous substances in an effort to determine the effects of that exposure or the epidemiology of diseases related to exposures such as those that had inspired Albosta to run for Congress after he led the successful investigation and redress efforts in the wake of the spill of PBBs in cattle feed in Michigan.

Debategate

Albosta was also chair of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Human Resources which conducted an investigation into the Unauthorized Transfers of Nonpublic Information During the 1980 Presidential Election which published its findings in May 1984 in Committee Print 98-12.

The investigation revealed that the Reagan Campaign included three committees or groups devoted to monitoring and addressing the situation of the hostages held by Iran during the period preceding the 1980 Presidential election, which collectively referred to the potential release of the hostages before the November election as the &quot;October Surprise&quot;. Some observers and later investigations by others concluded after the release of the hostages shortly after President Reagan&#x27;s inauguration that the presidential campaign of Ronald Reagan orchestrated delaying the release of U.S. hostages held by Iran until after the election.

The Albosta Subcommittee Report also confirmed that the Reagan campaign received, copied and used &quot;a pilfered copy&quot; of President Carter&#x27;s debate briefing book, and related materials from the National Security Council, the term &quot;pilfered&quot; being used by Michigan Republican Congressman David Stockman in a statement on October 28, 1980, describing how he had used the book to prepare candidate Reagan for the debate with President Carter, to a group of about 65 people, according to newspaper reports of Rep. Stockman&#x27;s speech printed in the Elkhart Truth and Dowagiac Daily News on Wednesday, October 29. The controversy became known as Debategate.

During the investigation, William Casey, then-director of the CIA who had been Reagan&#x27;s campaign director, said that the person who delivered the leaked briefing books to him was Paul Corbin, a former aide to Robert F. Kennedy and a disgruntled Ted Kennedy supporter. The subcommittee&#x27;s final report in 1984 reported on scores of interviews with Reagan&#x27;s former campaign staff and others. It did not conclusively identify the specific individuals within the Carter White House who may have provided the briefing books, but did interview several who may have done so, reported that some witness statements were not entirely candid and seconded the finding of United States District Court Judge Harold Green that the Reagan Administration was required by the Ethics in Government Act to appoint an independent counsel or special prosecutor to conduct an investigation and determine whether to seek an indictment against any of the high-level presidential appointees who had knowingly received and used the stolen White House briefing book in violation of the law. Attorney General Ed Meese declined to appoint an independent counsel.

End of political career

In the late summer of 1984 Rep. Albosta cosponsored a bill introduced by Rep. John LaFalce to provide compensation for victims of hazardous substances. This did not play well with the Dow Chemical Company, headquartered in Albosta&#x27;s district in Midland, Michigan. Executives and board members of Dow Chemical urged their employees and retirees to oppose Rep. Albosta and he was very narrowly defeated in November by future state Attorney General Bill Schuette. Albosta sought a rematch against Schuette in 1986; he won the Democratic primary, but lost the general election in another close race and retired from politics.

==Retirement and death==
He was a resident of St. Charles, Michigan. His daughter, Christine C. White, was appointed in March 2003 as the Director of Agriculture Policy for the Michigan Department of Agriculture. Albosta died on December 18, 2014, in St. Charles, Michigan, where he lived.

<text>The World Universities Debating Championship (WUDC) is the world&#x27;s largest international debating tournament and one of the largest annual international student events. WUDC is held in the British Parliamentary format (involving four teams of two people in each debate).

Each year, the event is hosted by an institution selected by the World Universities Debating Council. The current 2025 world champions are Madeleine Wu &amp; Ryan Lafferty from Dartmouth College.

==History==
===Predecessor tournaments===
The Trans-Atlantic University Speech Association held tournaments in London (1976 and 1978) and at McGill University, Montreal, in 1977. Chicago was to hold a tournament in 1979 but this was postponed and then abandoned. A &quot;World Debating Festival&quot;, sponsored by Honeywell was held in Sydney in 1978. The TAUSA event attracted mostly Northern Hemisphere tournaments, the Honeywell was largely Southern Hemisphere. The first competition was hosted in Glasgow and convened by debaters at the Glasgow University Union.

==Format==
The championship is usually held in the days following the 25th of December, since many of the institutions attending from the Northern Hemisphere where the championship originated take vacations at this time. Although many countries that do not celebrate Christmas have become participants at the competition, the timing has remained the same. In most recent years, the nine preliminary rounds of the tournament have been held over three days from 29 to 31 December, with the elimination rounds being held on 2 January and the Grand Final on 3 January.

In recent years, the championship has varied from about 150 to 400 teams, depending on the capacity of the host institution. With judges and organisers, this involves 500 to 1,000 participants in all.

The competition involves nine preliminary rounds, which become &quot;power-paired&quot; as the tournament progresses, matching the strongest-performing teams against each other. Two teams form the &quot;government&quot; (&quot;proposition&quot; in the UK and North America) and two the &quot;opposition&quot; in each debate room. The process of scoring and pairing these teams is known as &quot;tabbing&quot;. The scoring of teams is done by judges, most of whom are students or former students from the competing institutions, who return &quot;ballots&quot; with their scores to the adjudication team, led by a Chief Adjudicator who is assisted by one or more deputies. The deputies are not members of the host institution.

The nine preliminary rounds are followed by a &quot;break&quot; at which the teams proceeding to elimination rounds are announced. This is traditionally done on New Year&#x27;s Eve, although this is subject to the timing of the tournament. In the current tournament format, the top 16 teams from the preliminary rounds proceed to the octofinal round. The teams ranked 17–48 also break into a partial double octofinal round, and the winning teams from this round join the teams ranked 1–16 in the octo-finals. While preliminary rounds are usually judged by three to five judges, the break rounds are judged by panels of five, semifinal judged by panels of seven and the finals by panels of nine.

Separate breaks are announced for the English-as-a-second language (ESL) and English-as-a-foreign language (EFL) team competitions, for the individual public speaking competition, and the &quot;World Masters&quot; tournament which is participated in by judges (most of whom are no longer students) representing the countries where they studied or of which they are citizens. In addition, a comedy competition is also open to all participants in Worlds.

==Governance==
The World Universities Debating Council consists of representatives of every country that competes at the World Universities Debating Championship. Each country selects one council delegate (the national debating association president, or selected from the participants at Worlds). The council is responsible for setting the rules and awarding the right to host the championships.

A Worlds Committee is elected to discuss issues during the year as Council only meets at the championships itself. This Committee consists of a mix of elected officers and regional representatives from Africa, the Americas, Australia and New Zealand, Continental Europe and the Middle East, and the British Isles (referred to in debating as Islands of the North Atlantic thought more politically acceptable than British Isles).

The Council formerly operated not unlike the United Nations Security Council, with seven nations holding &quot;charter member status&quot; – the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. A two-thirds majority of these countries was required for changes to the championship&#x27;s constitution, irrespective of how the general vote was tallied. However, as the number of non-charter nations attending grew, many fielding far more teams than some of the upper tier, and the championship began being hosted outside the Charter nations, pressure grew for the distinction to be eliminated.

The modern championship grants voting strength of between one and four votes per country, based on numbers of institutions attending recent championships. To allow for fluctuations in participation due to the financial difference in attending championships nearer or further in succeeding years, nations lose or gain their voting strength gradually.

The current chair of the council and the committee is Xavier Konynenburg from the University of Melbourne.

== Notable controversies ==
=== Thailand WUDC 2020 ===
There was concern over the public debate of Hong Kong in the Open Grand Final motion. This led to walk-outs during the debate, including 30 Chinese students and teachers. After the live-stream, all recordings of the debate were deleted, but the motion was still present on the tabulation software. Many participants had names removed from the public record retroactively once the competition was over. The organizing committee claims this was done to respect participants&#x27; privacy and denies pressure from any national body or representative.

=== Cape Town WUDC 2019 ===
Accusations of racism were made against members of the organising committee over treatment of participants. On the last day of the competition and just before the Open Grand Final was to begin, an organised protest took place and disrupted the event. Rather than delay the Open Grand Final, speakers and judges were relocated to an undisclosed room and the debate took place in private. This action was the subject of further controversy due to perceived undermining of an anti-racist cause.

=== Chennai WUDC 2014 ===
This tournament is notable for several controversies. This included &quot;tracking registration payments, to issues with getting participants visas, allocating hotel rooms, picking participants safely up from the airport, toilet paper disappearing, insufficient food provision, and dangerous dirt bike socials&quot;. Discontent among judges who had been offered payment in return for participation resulted in strike threats, jeopardizing the 7th round of the tournament. There were also complaints from Pakistani participants of detention by Indian immigration authorities.

<text>The Hammond River is a tributary of the Kennebecasis River in New Brunswick, Canada. It runs approximately in southern Kings County along the border of Saint John County. It rises in the Caledonia Highlands near the rural community of Hammondvale and runs in a westerly direction to its junction with the Kennebecasis River. Near the mouth of the river, at the rural community of Nauwigewauk, the river is joined by a short tributary draining Darlings Lake.

The Hammond River is one of the few rivers in the world that still has spawning Atlantic salmon. It was named for Andrew Hamond, Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia from 1781 to 1782, who owned land in the area.

<text>The abacus system of mental calculation is a system where users mentally visualize an abacus to carry out arithmetical calculations. No physical abacus is used; only the answers are written down. Calculations can be made at great speed in this way. For example, in the Flash Anzan event at the All Japan Soroban Championship, champion Takeo Sasano was able to add fifteen three-digit numbers in just 1.7 seconds.

This system is being propagated in China, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan. Mental calculation is said to improve mental capability, increases speed of response, memory power, and concentration power.

Many veteran and prolific abacus users in China, Japan, South Korea, and others who use the abacus daily, naturally tend to not use the abacus any more, but perform calculations by visualizing the abacus. This was verified when the right brain of visualisers showed heightened EEG activity when calculating, compared with others using an actual abacus to perform calculations.

The abacus can be used routinely to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; it can also be used to extract square and cube roots.
