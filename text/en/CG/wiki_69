==Early life==
Clay was born in Streatham, London on 18 September 1946, the son of a professional soldier in the British Army&#x27;s Royal Engineers. The family settled in Kent, where Clay became interested in acting, performing at the Medway Little Theatre Club.

==Career==
He had roles on TV in episodes of &quot;Ask Mr. Pastry&quot; (1961), &quot;ITV Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Pocket Lancer&quot; (1961), and &quot;Tales of Mystery&quot;. He made his film debut with &quot;These Are the Damned&quot; (1962) and could be seen in &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, &quot;William&quot;, &quot;Sergeant Cork&quot;, and &quot;Drama 61-67&quot;. He studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).

Clay appeared in several West End theatre productions.

He returned to films with &quot;The Night Digger&quot; (1971), a horror film with Patricia Neal and was in episodes of &quot;Take Three Girls&quot;, &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;, and &quot;Love Story&quot;.

Clay had the starring role of Charles Darwin in &quot;The Darwin Adventure&quot; (1972) and was in &quot;William: The Life, Works and Times of William Shakespeare&quot; (1972). He was cast in several of Laurence Olivier&#x27;s Old Vic productions and during the 1970s came to be regarded as one of British theatre&#x27;s most promising actors. At the National Theatre he played Aumerle in &quot;Richard II&quot;, Giovanni in &quot;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot; (directed by Roland Joffe), Nugget in &quot;Equus&quot;, a Jumper in &quot;Jumpers&quot; (directed by Peter Wood), Rocca in &quot;Saturday Sunday Monday&quot; (directed by Franco Zeffirelli), Young Seward in &quot;Macbeth&quot; (directed by Michael Blakemore) and Acaste in &quot;The Misanthrope&quot;. Blakemore also directed him in the part of Young Inna in &quot;Arturo Ui&quot; at Nottingham Playhouse, where Clay acted several roles in Jonathan Miller&#x27;s production of King Lear. He played Hastings in Clifford Williams&#x27;s world tour of &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;. &quot;The Misanthrope&quot; led Clay to the United States, where he also played this role on Broadway in 1975. On the West End stage, Clay was Maurice in &quot;Flint&quot; (Criterion Theatre) and Trigorin in &quot;The Seagull&quot; (Cambridge Theatre). 

He appeared in &quot;In This House of Brede&quot; (1975) with Diana Rigg and played Alan in the 1976 version of &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, alongside Peter Firth. Clay was in &quot;Terror of Frankenstein&quot; (1977) then did &quot;Saturday Sunday Monday&quot; (1978) with Laurence Olivier.

In 1981 he gave his most widely seen screen performance, as Lancelot in the 1981 film &quot;Excalibur&quot;. He followed it playing the title role in &quot;The Search for Alexander the Great&quot; (1981). He appeared in Just Jaeckin&#x27;s film version of D.H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; (1981), playing Mellors, and in Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot; (1982), the latter reuniting him with Diana Rigg, his co-star in &quot;The Misanthrope&quot;. Director of &quot;Evil&quot; Guy Hamilton said &quot;I was looking for someone like Stewart Granger or Michael Rennie - handsome, dashing, physical, romantic. Nick has it all. A fine sense of timing, the right looks and a good physique.&quot;

For TV Clay was in &quot;The Agatha Christie Hour&quot; (1982), in an adaptation of &quot;In a Glass Darkly&quot; then &quot;Russian Night... 1941&quot; (1983), &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1984).

Clay continued working regularly on stage and appeared in a number of made-for-television films and miniseries. In 1984 he played Mike Preston in the &quot;Hammer House of Mystery and Suspense&quot; episode &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;.

Later appearances included &quot;The New Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;Zorro&quot;, &quot;Kavanagh QC&quot;, &quot;Shine on Harvey Moon&quot;, &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Shanghai 1937&quot;, &quot;Bugs&quot;, &quot;Highlander&quot;, &quot;Psychos&quot; and playing Lord Leo in the 1998 TV miniseries &quot;Merlin&quot; starring Sam Neill. 
His final screen appearance was in Roger Ashton-Griffiths&#x27; short film &quot;And Beyond&quot;. Later theatre work included &quot;Design for Living&quot; (1995).

In the latter years Clay taught drama at &quot;The Actors&#x27; Centre&quot; and the &quot;Academy of Live and Performing Arts&quot;, and also worked in association with the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, generally in the role of promoting the organisation, or providing advice to acting students.

<text>Sisters in Crime (SinC) is a writing organization focused on increasing equity and inclusion for women crime writers within the publishing industry. The group has 4,500 members in 60+ regional chapters worldwide, offering networking, advice and support to mystery authors. Members are authors, readers, publishers, agents, booksellers and librarians bound by their affection for the mystery genre and their support of women who write mysteries.

== History ==
Events leading up to the formation of Sisters in Crime included a conference at Hunter College on Women in the Mystery Genre in 1986, at which Sara Paretsky spoke on growing use of graphic sadism against women in mysteries; a letter by Phyllis Whitney to the Mystery Writers of America, pointing out that women were not being nominated for awards; an initial meeting of interested women at the October 1986 Bouchercon World Mystery Convention in Baltimore convened by Sara Paretsky; and a meeting at Sandra Scoppettone&#x27;s loft during the annual Edgars week, at which the organization was formed.

At the 1987 Boucheron in Minneapolis, SinC established a steering committee with Sara Paretsky as its first president. The following year, the organization held its first election, during which Nancy Pickard became the group&#x27;s first elected president. Organization membership was open to all writers, including unpublished authors, librarians, booksellers, and other women involved with the genre. 

In its early years, SinC faced backlash and discrimination from critics who accused the organization of being &quot;anti-men&quot;, and argued that there was not a need for an organization focused on women crime fiction writers. Nevertheless, SinC continued to organize and gain new members. In the late 1980s, local chapters of SinC began to form around the United States, with the first chapter organized in Los Angeles in 1988. By 2017, the organization had fifty-two chapters, throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe. The group also connects members across geographic boundaries through &quot;Support and Information Groups&quot; (SIGs). 

In 1997, SinC joined the Authors&#x27; Coalition of America (AC), to support international copyright distributions of members&#x27; work. This achievement took place under the leadership of SinC president Annette Meyers, and is recognized as a turning point for the organization which had minimal funding and financial resources until this point. In 2010, SinC established the &quot;We Love Libraries!&quot; Program, a grant program providing book-buying funds to American libraries, and the &quot;We Love Bookstores&quot; program which provides funds to local bookstores. The organization also provides academic research grants, emergency grant programs to support writers in times of financial struggle, and numerous webinars and write-in events. The organization also has its own podcast, &quot;Sisters in Crime Writers&#x27; Podcast&quot;, a biannual journal &quot;SinC Bulletin&quot;, and an online merchandise store. 

In an effort to better acknowledge the diversity of SinC membership and welcoming writers of different backgrounds and identities, the organization has revised its mission statement several times to be more inclusive. The organization also publishes &quot;Frankie&#x27;s List&quot;, an ongoing reference list of published African American crime writers and other authors from historically marginalized communities. 

The current Sisters in Crime mission statement reads:
To combat discrimination against women in the mystery field, educate publishers and the general public as to inequities in the treatment of female authors, raise the level of awareness of their contributions to the field, and promote the professional advancement of women who write mysteries.&quot;SinC also runs an annual monitoring project (Sisters in Crime Monitoring Project Report) to evaluate national and regional publishing trends within the crime genre with the goal of tracking crime publications written by women.

== Leadership ==
SinC leadership includes a board consisting of an executive council, coordinators and staff. Sitting SinC presidents have a tradition of passing down white seal stuffed animal known as &quot;Sealine&quot;, initially purchased by former president Susan Dunlap to highlight the organization&#x27;s &quot;innovation, humor, and outspokenness&quot; and to become a contrasting symbol for SinC&#x27;s anti-corporate focus, and their goal of combatting discrimination in the genre. Sealine wears a necklace made of keychains associated from each president, a tradition started by former president Kate Grilley.

<text>Oscar Ivar Levertin (17 July 1862, Norrköping – 22 September 1906) was a Swedish poet, critic and literary historian. Levertin was a dominant voice of the Swedish cultural scene from 1897, when he started writing influential high-profile essays and reviews in the daily paper &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot;.

From 1899 until his early death in 1906 he also occupied the first Chair of literary history at the University of Stockholm, in which role he published extensive studies, particularly in Swedish 18th century literature.

==Overview==
In his own short story collections in the 1880s, Levertin first aligned himself with the Naturalist school of fiction of which August Strindberg was the most prominent member. In 1888, however, the previously unheard Swedish romantic poetic voice of Verner von Heidenstam&#x27;s &quot;Vallfart och vandringsår&quot; changed Levertin&#x27;s stylistic ideals. Levertin and Heidenstam published together a pamphlet attacking the Naturalist style in 1890, and even though Levertin was never to abandon his scientific and materialist view of history (something that sets him off from other poets of his generation), his literary energies were thenceforth channelled into poetry of a romantic, exotic and historical character. Together with Heidenstam&#x27;s work, Levertin&#x27;s first collection of poetry, &quot;Legender och visor&quot; (&quot;Legends and Songs&quot;) (1891), sparked an 1890s Swedish fashion for historical, particularly &quot;medieval&quot;, literature. Unlike Heidenstam&#x27;s and much other Swedish poetry of the 1890s, &quot;Legender och visor&quot; is free from Swedish nationalism, drawing on many European as well as Middle Eastern sources. This volume remains highly regarded today, though no longer widely read. Poems from it, including the ballad &quot;Flores och Blanzeflor&quot;, remained set texts in Swedish schools into the 1970s.

==In culture==
Levertin is depicted as Olof Levini in Hjalmar Söderberg&#x27;s 1912 novel &quot;Den Allvarsamma Leken&quot; (&quot;The Serious Game&quot;).

Its torpedo tubes were fitted to the bow and stern, and it could carry twenty torpedoes. Its complement was sixty-one crew members.

==Service history==
&quot;Acheron&quot; took part in the Coronation Review of the Fleet to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. It carried out &#x27;General Naval Service&#x27; around the UK until the end of 1964. A geomagnetic storm in February 1956, during solar cycle 19, interfered with radio communications and prompted a search for the submarine after it lost radio contact. From August to December 1959, It took part in a cruise to South Africa and Pakistan.

It was decommissioned and broken up in 1972 at the yard of J Cashmore of Newport.

<text>HMS &quot;Thermopylae&quot; (P355) was a T-class submarine in service with the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy. So far she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name &quot;Thermopylae&quot;, after the Battle of Thermopylae.

== History ==
Thermopylae was laid down on 26 October 1943 at Chatham Dockyard, and launched on 27 June 1945.

Commissioned after the end of the Second World War, she had a relatively quiet career. She immediately joined the 3rd Flotilla based in the Holy Loch. On 15 January 1950 she ran aground on Stevenson Rock, off Skerryvore, Inner Hebrides. In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

She remained in service until December 1968 when she was put on the sale list. She was broken up at Troon during 1971.

<text>Opeongo Lake is a lake in the Saint Lawrence River drainage basin in the geographic townships of Bower, Dickson, Preston and Sproule in the Unorganized South Part of Nipissing District in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. It is the largest lake in Algonquin Provincial Park and the source of the Opeongo River. The lake&#x27;s name comes from the Algonquian word &quot;opeauwingauk&quot; meaning &quot;sandy narrows&quot;.

It has three arms, North, East and South, joined by narrows into a Y shape. The total area is , the average depth and the maximum depth . The primary outflow is the Opeongo River at the southeast tip of Annie Bay on the East Arm, controlled by the Opeongo Lake Dam, which flows via the Madawaska River to the Ottawa River.

A store with camping supplies and dock, Algonquin access point 11 and the Harkness Laboratory of Fisheries Research are located on Sproule Bay at south end of South Arm and are all accessible from Ontario Highway 60. Consequently, the lake is a popular starting point for canoe trips into the interior of the park.

Opeongo lake was to have been the endpoint of the Opeongo Line, one of a series of settlement roads built to open up this section of the province. It was the endpoint of the Whitney and Opeongo Railway, used for logging operations until the 1920s. Portions of this route now form part of Ontario Highway 60 and the access road connecting the lake to Highway 60.

<doc id="995498" wikidata="Q1503789" url="?curid=995498" title="Ukrainian cuisine">
<text>Ukrainian cuisine is the collection of the various cooking traditions of the people of Ukraine, one of the largest and most populous European countries. It is heavily influenced by the rich dark soil () from which its ingredients come, and often involves many components. Traditional Ukrainian dishes often experience a complex heating process – &quot;at first they are fried or boiled, and then stewed or baked. This is the most distinctive feature of Ukrainian cuisine&quot;.

The national dish of Ukraine is red borscht, a well-known beet soup, of which many varieties exist. However, (boiled dumplings similar to pierogi) and a type of cabbage roll known as are also national favourites, and are a common meal in traditional Ukrainian restaurants. These dishes indicate the regional similarities within Eastern European cuisine.

The cuisine emphasizes the importance of wheat in particular, and grain in general, as the country is often referred to as the &quot;breadbasket of Europe&quot;. The majority of Ukrainian dishes descend from ancient peasant dishes based on plentiful grain resources such as rye, as well as staple vegetables such as potato, cabbages, mushrooms and beetroots. Ukrainian dishes incorporate both traditional Slavic techniques as well as other European techniques, a byproduct of years of foreign jurisdiction and influence. As there has been a significant Ukrainian diaspora over several centuries (for example, over a million Canadians have Ukrainian heritage), the cuisine is represented in European countries and those further afield, particularly Argentina, Brazil, and the United States.

<text>Hendrik Marsman (30 September 1899 – 21 June 1940) was a Dutch poet and writer. He died while escaping to Great Britain, when the ship he was sailing on, the &quot;&quot;, either suffered a fatal engine-room explosion, or was torpedoed by a German submarine which mistook &quot;Berenice&quot; for another vessel.

==Biography==

Marsman studied law and practised in Utrecht, but after 1933 he travelled in Europe and devoted himself to literature. Under the influence of the German Expressionists, Marsman made his literary debut about 1920 with rhythmic free verse, which attracted notice for its aggressive independence.

In the biography of Hendrik Marsman on the website of the Charley Toorop is mentioned as one of the women who had a relationship with Marsman before he married in 1929 his wife Rien Barendregt.

The collection Verzen (1923; &quot;Verses&quot;) expresses an antihumanist, anti-intellectual rebelliousness, which the poet called &quot;vitalism.&quot; As editor of the periodical De Vrije bladen (&quot;The Free Press&quot;), he became in 1925 the foremost critic of the younger generation. His next collection of verse appeared in 1927 with the English title Paradise Regained and was greeted as a major artistic achievement. Another cycle, Porta Nigra, dominated by the idea of death, appeared in 1934. His last book of verse, Tempel en kruis (1940; &quot;Temple and Cross&quot;), an autobiographical account of the poet&#x27;s development, reaffirms humanistic ideals. After obtaining a Portuguese visa in Bordeaux, France, on June 18, 1940 from the Consul-General Aristides de Sousa Mendes, Marsman boarded a ship bound for England. He drowned three days later when the ship sunk after an explosion in the English Channel. His wife survived as the only passenger.

His poetry is vitalistic and expressionistic, and (fear of) death, as a metaphor for defeat in life, is a recurring theme. His &quot;Herinnering aan Holland&quot; (&quot;Remembrance of Holland&quot;): &quot;&quot; (&quot;Thinking about Holland, I see broad rivers slowly moving through endless lowlands&quot;). In 2000, the Dutch people chose this as the &quot;Dutch Poem of the Century.&quot;

== Awards ==
*1927 - (Amsterdam Award) for &quot;Paradise regained&quot;
*1936 - for &quot;Porta Nigra&quot;

== Death ==
Hendrik Marsman died on board the ship &quot;S.S. Berenice&quot; that sunk in the Bay of Biscay in the early morning of 21 June 1940.

The ship had set sailing from Bordeaux and sank in the North Sea. Different accounts exist on what might have sunk the &quot;S.S. Berenice&quot;.

The narrative according to the National Library of the Netherlands, that keeps an archive on Hendrik Marsman, goes like this:In the early morning of 21 June 1940 &quot;S.S. Berenice&quot;, sailing from Bordeaux, sank in the North Sea due to an explosion in the engine-room and not, as the persistent rumour goes, as the result of a well-aimed German torpedo.On a website dedicated to German submarines (U-boats) the sinking of the &quot;S.S. Berenice&quot; by the German submarine U-65 is detailed to the minute, although with some leeway for controversy: the U-boat might have accidentally; due to fog; attacked the &quot;S.S. Berenice&quot; confusing it with another ship: the &quot;Champlain&quot;.

&quot;According to the [log] of U-65, they sighted a big steamer, identified as Champlain (28.124 grt), at 5.45 hours, which was shadowed until 7.35 hours, when the U-boat lost contact in fog. A short time later the ship was sighted again and attacked with a spread of three torpedoes at 8.17 hours. Allied sources reports that the Champlain went to the bottom after being damaged by an air laid magnetic mine off La Pallice at 09.30 hours on 17 June. In knowledge of these sources, the torpedo report of U-65 claims the Champlain as his own success, but date, time and position are well fitting with the loss of the Berenice.&quot;

After presenting by email a librarian of the Royal Dutch Library with the rather confusing stories regarding the &quot;S.S. Berenice&quot; this reply was received:According to the biography of the poet Marsman by Jaap Goedegebuure [...] it took Dutch historians 45 years to establish that the Berenice was not hit by a torpedo from the U65. An attack one day later was confused with the explosion on the Berenice. Source for the biography on this matter was a 1986 history of Dutch merchant shipping by historian Karel Bezemer (). In Holland the U-boat-attack on the Berenice is considered to be a persistent myth, stimulated by his widow and admirers of the poet who wanted his death to be more heroic.The only surviving passenger was Marsman&#x27;s wife Rien Barendregt. She was saved because at the time of the explosion she was on deck serving breakfast while wearing a life jacket and the explosion threw her overboard. She told captain Groenhof of the boat (&quot;Nettie&quot;) that picked her and the few survivors up about her husband [that] &quot;He could no longer hold on&quot;. The article in the Dutch newspaper &quot;Trouw&quot; that covers the history of the boat &quot;Nettie&quot; goes under the suggestive title &quot;Marsman kon niet meer op ms &#x27;Nettie&#x27; wachten&quot; which translates as &quot;Marsman could no longer wait for the ship &#x27;Nettie&#x27;&quot;.
According to the same article (in Dutch) no manuscript or body was recovered after the explosion.

In poems including &quot;Vrees&quot; (&#x27;Fear&#x27;), describing &quot;the moment that the bullet won&#x27;t miss&quot;, &quot;Zinkend ship&quot; (&#x27;Sinking ship&#x27;), &quot;De Overtocht&quot; (The Passage [by boat]) some see signs of Henrik Marsman predicting his own moment of dying and his fear &quot;&quot;dat de dood het einde niet is&quot; (&#x27;that dead is not the end&#x27;)&quot;. In &quot;&quot;Verzet&quot; (&#x27;Resistance&#x27;)&quot; Marsman pictures the last moments of a dying man using his last grain of energy to fight off a priest holding a crucifix in front of him with the kick and the scream &quot;&quot;Mijn zonden gaan mee in Mijn graf&quot; (&#x27;My sins go with me in My grave&#x27;)&quot;.

An on-line published biography (in Dutch) mentions six poems that seem to predict the way Marsman died. 
Only a verse of the poem &quot;&quot;Maannacht&quot; (&#x27;Moon Night&#x27;)&quot; is used there as illustration.

<doc id="995510" wikidata="Q326249" url="?curid=995510" title="Hangzhou Bay Bridge">
<text>Hangzhou Bay Bridge () is a long highway bridge with two separate cable-stayed portions, built across the mouth of Hangzhou Bay in the eastern coastal region of China. It connects the municipalities of Jiaxing and Ningbo in Zhejiang province.

Construction of the bridge was completed on June 14, 2007, and an opening ceremony was held on June 26, 2007. The bridge was opened to public May 1, 2008, after a considerable period of testing and evaluation. The bridge shortened the highway travel distance between Ningbo and Shanghai from to and reduced travel time from 4 to 2 hours. At in length, Hangzhou Bay Bridge was among the ten longest trans-oceanic bridges.

It is not to be confused with &quot;Outer Hangzhou Bay Bridge&quot;, a project under study which would ring the bay islands between Shanghai and Ningbo. An official name does not yet exist, hence the terminology clash.

==History==
The bridge across the Hangzhou Bay was the subject of various feasibility studies for over a decade before the final plans were approved in 2003. An earlier plan placed the bridge further east, closer to the mouth of the bay, which provided an even shorter travel distance between Ningbo and Shanghai. Under this plan, the bridge would begin in the north from Jinshan, a suburb of Shanghai. The government of Shanghai rejected the plan and focused on building the -long Donghai Bridge from Shanghai to its off-shore port at Yangshan in the mouth of the bay. The Shanghai government sought to feature Yangshan as the chief port on China&#x27;s east coast and refused to allow a cross-bay bridge to be built on its territory, which would improve access to the Port of Ningbo at Beilun. The Zhejiang Provincial Government was forced to build the bridge further to the west on entirely Zhejiang territory. The Hangzhou Bay Bridge connects Cixi, a local-level city that is part of Ningbo Municipality, with Haiyan, a county in Jiaxing Municipality. The Hangzhou Bay Bridge has significantly shortened driving distance between Ningbo and the Yangtze River Delta region and improved the competitiveness of the Beilun Port.

==Structural description==

The Hangzhou Bay Bridge is of the cable stayed bridge form. This form was chosen for this project because of the strength of the cable stayed bridge in adverse conditions. The bridge was constructed in the Qiantang River and Yangtze River Deltas and Hangzhou Bay, which all experience some of the highest tidal bore forces on the planet. The location of the bridge is also prone to earthquakes, as well as extremely high winds during typhoon season. The bridge form and construction material selections were based on strength against all the different forces the bridge would face.

Many bridges use concrete piles to support the deck but the Hangzhou Bay Bridge took a different approach and used steel piles. This choice was made based on the fact that the steel piles would be much stronger against corrosion from the extremely high tidal forces in the bay. Using the steel piles instead of the concrete piles also made the bridge far more constructible especially in the extremely difficult working conditions that they would be facing. It is not strange to see waves in the bay reaching 25 feet tall. In these conditions it would be almost impossible to construct the bridge without the use of some new construction technology and vehicles. During the construction of the bridge two massive cranes were used, one being 2,200 tons and the other being 3,000 tons. These heavy duty cranes were used to transport massive girders from the shore to the part of the bridge where they would then lift it and put it into place. The steel piles used were also transported using these cranes.

The load paths in this structure are somewhat easy to follow. The gravity load on the bridge as well as the rest of the loading on the deck such as cars are the easiest to follow which is further explained in the qualification as structural art section. The loads on the bridge due to the extreme tides are somewhat difficult to read, but they are clearly accounted for. The steel piles are the structural supports that resist the tidal loads. The piles are driven deep into the sea bed to reduce the movement on them. Having a small moment or force causing bending in the piles keeps the bridge upright. The steel is extremely strong against corrosion and are therefore the best material that could have been used in the piles.

When looking at the loading due to wind loads on the bridge the main portion that is important to analyze is the main spans. Because the two main spans are relative short the wind loading is insignificant. The wind loads however would be accounted for due to the outward bend of the towers that support the tension cables. This theory of widening the bottom of towers was first used by Gustav Eiffel when constructing the Eiffel Tower. The bent shape is very good at transferring the wind load to the base supports of the structure.

==Challenges==
Because of the many difficulties facing such a tremendous build, almost 600 experts spent nearly a decade designing the bridge. Even after nearly a decade of design, studies, and planning, many different challenges were encountered, the first being the challenge of offshore construction. As a solution, several parts of the bridge had to be completed on land and then transported to the area for which they were built. Some components that were constructed using this process were piers, box girders (bridge panels), and even the bridge foundations.

Another construction challenge involved the weather in the region. Wang Yong, chief director of the Hangzhou Bay Trans-Oceanic Bridge Construction Command Post, described the bridge as being built &quot;in the world&#x27;s most complicated sea environment, with one of the three biggest tides on Earth, the effect of typhoons and the difficult content of the sea soil.&quot; Erosion of materials and cracking and bubbling of any concrete components became a large problem. To combat bubbling and eventual holes, engineers used a cloth-covered template over the concrete. This would improve the color and density of the pieces, making them both more aesthetically pleasing and sturdier. To reduce cracking, engineers used low-strength early-stretching technology when constructing box girders. This technology involves casting (molding) the girder, or bridge panel, letting it harden for no more than three days, and then squeezing it before it reaches its full density. This gives the girder more room to stretch after the bridge is constructed, preventing cracks in the concrete over time.

The third major challenge faced by designers and engineers was an area of toxic methane gas that was discovered roughly 50 meters underground below the location of the bridge. No drilling could be completed before the gas pressure was alleviated. To do this, steel pipes measuring 60 cm in diameter were inserted into the ground, slowly releasing the methane six months prior to drilling.

==Service Center==

A service centre called Land between the Sea and the Sky (Chinese: 海天一洲, Pinyin: hǎi-tiān yī-zhōu) is built in the middle of the bridge. This centre consists of shopping/exhibition/parking/restaurant facilities, a hotel and a lookout tower which serves as a tourist attraction from where to enjoy a bird&#x27;s eye view of the bridge and the ocean. The service centre is built on an island, which is a platform resting on piers to avoid obstructing the sea current in the bay.

The service centre was slightly damaged in a fire on March 23, 2010, but opened to tourists on December 19, 2010.

<text>Kim John Carr (born 2 July 1955) is an Australian former politician who served as a Senator for Victoria between 1993 and 2022. Representing the Labor Party, he was a minister in the Rudd and Gillard governments.

Carr is a graduate of the University of Melbourne, and before entering politics worked as a schoolteacher and political staffer. He was appointed to the Senate in 1993, filling a casual vacancy, and was made a member of the shadow ministry after Labor&#x27;s defeat at the 1996 election. Carr held a variety of portfolios in the Labor governments between 2007 and 2013. He was considered a leader of the Labor Left faction in Victoria until 2016 when he formed the Industrial Left, a breakaway mini-faction comprising nearly all of Carr&#x27;s union allies. He became the most senior senator and thus father of the senate in 2019, retaining the title until his retirement in 2022.

==Early life==
Carr was born on 2 July 1955 in Tumut, New South Wales. His father was a boilermaker, working on the Snowy Mountains Scheme. The family moved regularly when he was a child, living at a caravan park in Gladstone, Queensland, for a period. He attended Moreland High School in Coburg, Victoria, where &quot;a history teacher fuelled his interest in politics by slipping him copies of socialist literature to read at home&quot;.

Carr studied history at the University of Melbourne, completing a Bachelor of Arts with honours and a Master of Arts, and later a Diploma of Education. He joined the Labor Party in 1975. He was a secondary school teacher for nine years before becoming a political staffer for Victorian government ministers Joan Kirner and Andrew McCutcheon.

==Parliamentary career==
Carr was elected to the Senate at the March 1993 election, and was due to take his seat on 1 July. When retiring Senator John Button resigned before the expiry of his term, however, Carr was appointed to the resulting casual vacancy on 28 April. Following his maiden speech, in which he described the opposition as pursuing &quot;inhumane policies&quot;, he was accused by Liberal Senate leader Robert Hill of breaking a parliamentary convention around the content of maiden speeches. By 1994, he was regarded as the leader of the Victorian Left faction.

Carr became a Shadow Parliamentary Secretary in March 1996 in addition to being the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate until his election to the Opposition Shadow Ministry in November 2001. He was Shadow Minister for Science and Research from then until October 2004. He was also Shadow Minister for Industry and Innovation from July 2003 to October 2004. He has been Shadow Minister for Public Administration and Open Government, Shadow Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Reconciliation and Shadow Minister for the Arts October 2004 to June 2005, when he was appointed Shadow Minister for Housing, Urban Development, Local Government and Territories. He is one of five voting Victorian members of the party&#x27;s National Executive.

Carr was a leading figure in Labor&#x27;s left faction in his prime. His influential position within the party has attracted substantial criticism from factional opponents, Carr was then described by colleagues as &quot;ruthless&quot;, &quot;calculating&quot; and a &quot;headkicker&quot;.

After the Labor&#x27;s victory in the 2007 federal election, the new Prime Minister Kevin Rudd appointed Carr as Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, and he was sworn into office by Governor-General Michael Jeffery on 3 December.

Carr was re-elected in the 2010 election and retained his portfolio of Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research in the Second Gillard Ministry, which was sworn in on 14 September 2010. He was dropped from the cabinet on 12 December 2011, amid speculation that it was due to his links with former prime minister Kevin Rudd. He remained in the outer Ministry however, as Minister for Manufacturing and Minister for Defence Materiel.

In the Ministerial reshuffle of 2 March 2012, Carr was appointed as Minister for Human Services. Carr resigned his ministerial portfolio on 22 March 2013 after he supported an unsuccessful attempt to reinstall Kevin Rudd as Labor Leader.

Following a subsequent successful leadership spill in which Gillard was defeated, Rudd appointed Carr as the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, and Minister for Higher Education and member of Cabinet in the Second Rudd Ministry.

After Labor lost government in the 2013 federal election, Carr was allegedly &quot;responsible for shifting a small but significant number of parliamentary numbers&quot; to install Bill Shorten as party leader ahead of Anthony Albanese. He continued to be appointed to Shorten&#x27;s shadow ministry. Carr became increasingly &quot;estranged&quot; from the Labor Left faction and in 2016, following the July federal election, the faction did not nominate Carr for the shadow ministry. In response, Carr formed his own mini-faction, the Industrial Left, which was recognised by Shorten&#x27;s Labor Right, allowing him to remain in the shadow ministry.

Carr had been regarded as a longstanding political rival of Albanese. When Albanese became party leader in 2019, Carr announced he would not be nominating for Albanese&#x27;s new shadow ministry.

As the 2022 federal election approached, Carr was facing a preselection challenge to remain on the party&#x27;s Senate ticket for Victoria. It was reported in early March 2022 that he had lost the support of unions in the Industrial Left faction and was set to miss out on the Senate ticket. He had initially wanted to fight to remain in the Senate. However, following the recent death of fellow Senator Kimberley Kitching and &quot;determined urgings&quot; from his children, he announced on 27 March 2022 that he decided to retire at the election, citing health reasons.

<doc id="995520" wikidata="Q741033" url="?curid=995520" title="Evil Under the Sun">
<text>Evil Under the Sun is a work of detective fiction by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club in June 1941 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company in October of the same year.

The novel features Christie&#x27;s detective, Hercule Poirot, who takes a holiday in Devon. During his stay, he notices a young woman who is flirtatious and attractive, but not well liked by a number of guests. When she is murdered during his stay, he finds himself drawn into investigating the circumstances surrounding the murder.

==Plot summary==
Hercule Poirot takes a quiet holiday at a secluded hotel in Devon, and notices attractive former actress Arlena Marshall flirting with Patrick Redfern, despite the fact both of them are married to other people. One morning, Arlena heads out for a private rendezvous at Pixy Cove; everyone initially assumes she has gone to meet Redfern, but he emerges from the hotel looking for her moments later. He and Miss Emily Brewster row around the island and find Arlena lying dead. A later examination by the local police surgeon reveals she has been strangled.

Both Poirot and the investigating officer, Inspector Colgate, interview the possible suspects about their movements during the morning. Poirot learns that Emily Brewster was nearly hit by a bottle thrown from one of the guest rooms, while the hotel chambermaid recalls hearing someone running a bath at noon. Poirot also notes the aroma of Arlena&#x27;s perfume inside a hidden cave near Pixy Cove.

Looking for similar cases, Poirot learns of the strangulation of Alice Corrigan; she was found by a local teacher, at a time for which her husband Edward had an alibi. Poirot is supplied with a photo of both Corrigan and the teacher; later, he invites most of his suspects to a picnic, at which he secretly observes their behaviour and tests their reaction to heights. Following the picnic, Arlena&#x27;s stepdaughter Linda attempts suicide with Christine Redfern&#x27;s sleeping pills. Poirot reveals that Linda has been experimenting with voodoo, and believed her &quot;spells&quot; killed her stepmother, whom she hated and mistrusted.

Bringing together the suspects, Poirot denounces Patrick and Christine Redfern for Arlena&#x27;s murder. Arlena had been killed to prevent her husband from learning that Patrick had conned most of her fortune away. The murder was well-planned to falsify the time of death; while Christine was at Gull Cove with Linda, she set Linda&#x27;s watch forward twenty minutes, asked for the time to set her alibi, then returned the watch to the correct time. Afterwards, Christine returned to her room and applied fake suntan makeup, which she concealed from sight, before tossing the bottle out the window, where it inadvertently landed right next to Miss Brewster. Sneaking down to Pixy Cove via a long ladder the hotel had fixed there for tourists, Christine made certain Arlena saw her; Patrick had instructed Arlena to hide should his wife turn up before their rendezvous. Once Arlena was deep in the cave, Christine impersonated the dead body to fool Brewster, who immediately left to get help while Patrick remained behind. After Brewster&#x27;s departure, Christine rushed back to the hotel to remove the makeup. Patrick then called an unsuspecting Arlena out and strangled her.

Poirot reveals that Christine lied about having a fear of heights, as she easily traversed a suspended bridge during the picnic. Linda&#x27;s attempt at suicide was also provoked by Christine. As further proof, Poirot reveals that the photo from the Surrey Police identifies Patrick as Edward Corrigan, who killed his wife Alice, and Christine as the teacher who evidently claimed to have found the body before the murder actually had been committed. With the case closed, Poirot reassures Linda she did not kill Arlena and predicts she &quot;will not hate (her) next step-mother&quot;, as her father has rekindled a romance with his childhood sweetheart.

==Literary significance and reception==
The verdict by Maurice Willson Disher in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; of 14 June 1941 was positive: &quot;To maintain a place at the head of detective-writers would be difficult enough without the ever increasing rivalry. Even Miss Christie cannot stay there unchallenged though she has a following which will swear her books are best without reading the others. Unbiased opinion may have given the verdict against her last season when new arrivals set a very hot pace; but &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot; will take a lot of beating now.&quot; After summarising the plot, Disher concluded: &quot;Miss Christie casts the shadow of guilt upon first one and then another with such casual ease that it is difficult for the reader not to be led by the nose. Everybody is well aware that any character most strongly indicated is not a likely criminal; yet this guiding principle is forgotten when Miss Christie persuades you that you are more discerning than you really are. Then she springs her secret like a land-mine.&quot;

In &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; of 19 October 1941, Isaac Anderson wrote, &quot;The murder is an elaborately planned affair – a little too much so for credibility, in view of the many possibilities of a slip-up somewhere along the way – but Poirot&#x27;s reasoning is flawless, as it always is. &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot; adds another to the already long list of Agatha Christie&#x27;s successful mystery tales.&quot;

Maurice Richardson in a short review in the 8 June 1941 issue of &quot;The Observer&quot; said, &quot;Best Agatha Christie since &quot;Ten Little [Indians]&quot; – and one can&#x27;t say much more than that – &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot; has luxury summer hotel, closed-circle setting, Poirot in white trousers. Victim: redhead actress man-mad. Smashing solution, after clouds of dust thrown in your eyes, ought to catch you right out. Light as a soufflé.&quot;

&quot;The Scotsman&quot; of 3 July 1941 spoke of the &quot;surprising discoveries&quot; in the book&#x27;s solution and said, &quot;All of these the reader may best be left to encounter for himself in the assurance that the quest will prove as piquant as any this skilful writer has offered.&quot;

E.R. Punshon in &quot;The Guardian&quot; of 26 August 1941 briefly summed up the plot in a eulogistic piece which began, &quot;Is it going too far to call Mrs. Agatha Christie one of the most remarkable writers of the day?&quot;

Robert Barnard: &quot;The classic Christie marital triangle plot set in West Country seaside resort, with particular play on the alikeness of sunbathing bodies, and dead ones. Possibly overingenious and slightly uncharacterised.&quot;

==References to other works==
The plot is taken from the short story &quot;The Blood-Stained Pavement&quot;. There are also some vague similarities to the Christie short story &quot;Triangle at Rhodes&quot;, which was first published in the US in &quot;This Week&quot; magazine in February 1936 and in the UK in issue 545 of the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot; in May 1936, and included in the collection &quot;Murder in the Mews&quot; (US title: &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Mirror&quot;) one year later.

The character of Colonel Weston had originally appeared in &quot;Peril at End House&quot; and makes reference to that case upon his first appearance, in Chapter 5. Minor character Mrs Gardener is herself an admirer of Poirot&#x27;s exploits and refers to the case of &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; in Chapter 1 of this novel.

The title refers to Ecclesiastes 6:1, which reads, &quot;There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy upon humankind.&quot; (New Revised Standard Version of the Bible) Ecclesiastes 6:2 continues, &quot;those to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that they lack nothing of all that they desire, yet God does not enable them to enjoy these things, but a stranger enjoys them. This is vanity; it is a grievous ill.&quot;

==Media adaptations==
===Radio===
John Moffatt starred as Poirot in a 1998 five-part BBC Radio 4 adaptation directed by Enyd Williams with a cast that included Iain Glen as Patrick Redfern, Fiona Fullerton as Arlena Marshall, Robin Ellis as Captain Marshall, Wendy Craig as Mrs Gardener, George Baker as Colonel Weston, and Joan Littlewood as Miss Brewster.

===1982 film===

The novel was adapted into a film in 1982, and was the second film to star Peter Ustinov as Poirot, after his debut in the same role in the 1978 film &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;. His co-stars included Maggie Smith, Diana Rigg, Denis Quilley, Roddy McDowall, James Mason, and Sylvia Miles.

===Television===
====&quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;====
An adaptation of the novel was made for &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; in 2001, starring David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. Filming for this episode mainly took place at the Burgh Island Hotel, Devon, a location which was inspiration for the original novel and &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;.

====French adaptation====
The novel was adapted as a 2019 episode of the French television series &quot;Les Petits Meurtres d&#x27;Agatha Christie&quot;.

===Video game===
On 17 October 2007, The Adventure Company released a PC game adaptation of the book, which features actor Kevin Delaney as Hercule Poirot. This version includes the character of Captain Hastings as the player-character; as a game, Poirot re-creates the story, but allows Hastings to step into Poirot&#x27;s shoes and solve the mystery as he would.

<doc id="995521" wikidata="Q2783150" url="?curid=995521" title="Scottish Renaissance">
<text>The Scottish Renaissance (; ) was a mainly literary movement of the early to mid-20th century that can be seen as the Scottish version of modernism. It is sometimes referred to as the Scottish literary renaissance, although its influence went beyond literature into music, visual arts, and politics (among other fields). The writers and artists of the Scottish Renaissance displayed a profound interest in both modern philosophy and technology, as well as incorporating folk influences, and a strong concern for the fate of Scotland&#x27;s declining languages.

It has been seen as a parallel to other movements elsewhere, including the Irish Literary Revival, the Harlem Renaissance (in the USA), the Bengal Renaissance (in Kolkata, India) and the Jindyworobak Movement (in Australia), which emphasised indigenous folk traditions.

==Beginnings==
The term &quot;Scottish Renaissance&quot; was brought into critical prominence by the French Languedoc poet and scholar Denis Saurat in his article &quot;, which was published in the &quot; in April 1924. The term had appeared much earlier, however, in the work of the polymathic Patrick Geddes and in a 1922 book review by Christopher Murray Grieve (&quot;Hugh MacDiarmid&quot;) for the &quot;Scottish Chapbook&quot; that predicted a &quot;Scottish Renascence as swift and irresistible as was the Belgian Revival between 1880 and 1910&quot;, involving such figures as Lewis Spence and Marion Angus.

These earlier references make clear the connections between the Scottish Renaissance and the Celtic Twilight and Celtic Revival movements of the late 19th century, which helped reawaken a spirit of cultural nationalism among Scots of the modernist generations. Where these earlier movements had been steeped in a sentimental and nostalgic Celticism, however, the modernist-influenced Renaissance would seek a rebirth of Scottish national culture that would both look back to the medieval &quot;makar&quot; poets, William Dunbar and Robert Henryson, as well as look towards such contemporary influences as T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and D. H. Lawrence, or (more locally) R. B. Cunninghame Graham.

The turn of the 20th century saw the first stirrings of a new era in Scottish arts and letters. As writers such as George Douglas Brown railed against the &quot;Kailyard school&quot; that had come to dominate Scottish letters, producing satiric, realist accounts of Scottish rural life in novels like &quot;The House with the Green Shutters&quot; (1901), Scots language poets such as Violet Jacob and Marion Angus undertook a quiet revival of regionally inflected poetry in the Lowland vernacular. The aforementioned Patrick Geddes would continue his foundational work in town and regional planning, developing the triad &quot;Place - Work - Folk&quot; as a matrix for new thinking about the relationships between people and their local environments. In the realm of visual arts, John Duncan would refine his Celtic myth inspired Symbolist painting to include an increasing emphasis on collage and the flatness of the image. In architecture and the decorative arts, the towering figures of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Glasgow Four would give Scotland its very own &quot;school&quot; of modern design and help create the &quot;Glasgow style&quot;. Scotland in the early 20th century was experiencing an efflorescence of creative activity, but there was not yet a sense of a particular shared movement or an overt national inflection to all of this artistic effort.

==Literary renaissance==
It was not until the literary efforts of Hugh MacDiarmid that the Scottish Renaissance can properly be said to have begun. Starting in 1920, C. M. Grieve (having not yet adopted his nom de plume of Hugh MacDiarmid) began publishing a series of three short anthologies entitled &quot;Northern Numbers: Being Representative Selections from Certain Living Scottish Poets&quot; (including works by John Buchan, Violet Jacob, Neil Munro, and Grieve himself). These anthologies, which appeared one each year from 1920–22, along with his founding and editing of the &quot;Scottish Chapbook&quot; review (in the annus mirabilis of Modernism, 1922), established Grieve/MacDiarmid as the father and central figure of the burgeoning Scottish Renaissance movement that he had prophesied. By about 1925, MacDiarmid had largely abandoned his English language poetry and began to write in a kind of &quot;synthetic Scots&quot; known as Lallans, that was a hybrid of regional Scots dialects and lexicographical artifacts exhumed from &quot;Jamieson&#x27;s Dictionary of the Scottish Language&quot;, often grafted onto a Standard English grammatical structure. His poetic works included &quot;A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle&quot; (1926). This had an electrifying effect on the literary landscape of the time.

Other writers soon followed in MacDiarmid&#x27;s footsteps and also wrote in Lallans, including the poets Edwin Muir (1887–1959) and William Soutar (1898–1943), who pursued an exploration of identity, rejecting nostalgia and parochialism and engaging with social and political issues. Some writers that emerged after the Second World War followed MacDiarmid by writing in Scots, including Robert Garioch (1909–1981) and Sydney Goodsir Smith (1915–1975). The Glaswegian poet Edwin Morgan (1920–2010) became known for translations of works from a wide range of European languages. He was also the first Scots Makar (the official national poet), appointed by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004. Alexander Gray was an academic and poet, but is chiefly remembered for his translations into Scots from the German and Danish ballad traditions into Scots, including &quot;Arrows. A Book of German Ballads and Folksongs Attempted in Scots&quot; (1932) and &quot;Four-and-Forty. A Selection of Danish Ballads Presented in Scots&quot; (1954).

The Scottish Renaissance increasingly concentrated on the novel, particularly after the 1930s when Hugh MacDiarmid was in isolation in Shetland and its leadership moved to novelist Neil Gunn (1891–1973). Gunn&#x27;s novels, beginning with &quot;The Grey Coast&quot; (1926), and including &quot;Highland River&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Green Isle of the Great Deep&quot; (1943), were largely written in English and not the Scots preferred by MacDiarmid, focused on the Highlands of his birth and were notable for their narrative experimentation. Other major figures associated with the movement include George Blake (1893–1961), A. J. Cronin (1896–1981), Eric Linklater (1899–1974) and Lewis Grassic Gibbon (1901–35). There were also a large number of female authors associated with the movement, who demonstrated a growing feminine consciousness. They included Catherine Carswell (1879–1946), Willa Muir (1890–1970), Nan Shepherd (1893–1981) and most prolifically Naomi Mitchison (1897–1999). All were born within a fifteen-year period and, although they cannot be described as members of a single school, they all pursued an exploration of identity, rejecting nostalgia and parochialism and engaging with social and political issues. Physician A. J. Cronin is now often seen as sentimental, but his early work, particularly his first novel &quot;Hatter&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1931) and his most successful &quot;The Citadel&quot; (1937) were a deliberate reaction against the Kailyard tradition, exposing the hardships and vicissitudes of the lives of ordinary people, He was the most translated Scottish author in the twentieth century. George Blake pioneered the exploration of the experiences of the working class in his major works such as &quot;The Shipbuilders&quot; (1935). Eric Linklater produced comedies of the absurd including &quot;Juan in America&quot; (1931) dealing with prohibition America, and a critique of modern war in &quot;Private Angelo&quot; (1946). Lewis Grassic Gibbon, the pseudonym of James Leslie Mitchell, produced one of the most important realisations of the ideas of the Scottish Renaissance in his trilogy &quot;A Scots Quair&quot; (&quot;Sunset Song&quot;, 1932, &quot;Cloud Howe&quot;, 1933 and &quot;Grey Granite&quot;, 1934), which mixed different Scots dialects with the narrative voice. Other works that investigated the working class included James Barke&#x27;s (1905–58), &quot;Major Operation&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Land of the Leal&quot; (1939) and J. F. Hendry&#x27;s (1912–86) &quot;Fernie Brae&quot; (1947).

The parallel revitalisation of Gaelic poetry, known as the Scottish Gaelic Renaissance, was largely due to the work of Sorley Maclean (Somhairle MacGill-Eain, 1911–96). A native of Skye and a native Gaelic speaker, he abandoned the stylistic conventions of the tradition and opened up new possibilities for composition with his poem (&quot;Poems to Eimhir&quot;, 1943). His work inspired a new generation to take up (the new poetry). These included George Campbell Hay (, 1915–1984), Lewis-born poets Derick Thomson (, 1921–2012) and Iain Crichton Smith (, 1928–98). They all focused on the issues of exile, the fate of the Gaelic language and bi-culturalism.

==Art==
The ideas of a distinctive modern Scottish art were expressed in the inter-war period by figures including Stanley Cursiter (1887–1976), William McCance (1894–1970), William Johnstone (1897–1981) and J. D. Fergusson (1874–1961). Stanley Cursiter was influenced by the Celtic revival, post-impressionism and Futurism, as can be seen in his &quot;Rain on Princes Street&quot; (1913) and &quot;Regatta&quot; (1913). He went on to be a major painter of the coastline of his native Orkney, director of the National Gallery of Scotland and proposed the creation of a National Gallery of Modern Art in 1930. Fergusson was one of the few British artists who could claim to have played a part in the creation of modernism and probably played a major part in the formulation of MacDiarmid&#x27;s thought. His interest in machine imagery can be seen in paintings like &quot;Damaged Destroyer&quot; (1918). He co-operated with MacDiarmid on the journal &quot;Scottish Art and Letters&quot; and MacDiarmid quoted extensively from his work.

William McCance&#x27;s early work was in a bold post-impressionist style. After World War I he moved to London with his wife, fellow student Agnes Miller Parker (1895-1980), where he joined the same circles as Fergusson, vorticist Wyndham Lewis (1882-1957) and nationalist composer Francis George Scott. Under these influences his work became increasingly abstract and influenced by vorticism, as can be seen in &quot;Women on an Elevator&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Engineer and his Wife&quot; (1925). William Johnstone (1897–1981) was a cousin of F. G. Scott and met MacDiarmid while a student at Edinburgh. He studied cubism, surrealism and was introduced to new American art by his wife the sculptor Flora Macdonald. He moved towards abstraction, attempting to utilise aspects of landscape, poetry and Celtic art. His most significant work, &quot;A Point in Time&quot; (1929–38), has been described by art historian Duncan Macmillan as &quot;one of the most important Scottish pictures of the century and one of the most remarkable pictures by any British painter in the period&quot;.

Other artists strongly influenced by modernism included James McIntosh Patrick (1907–98) and Edward Baird (1904–49). Both trained in Glasgow, but spent most of their careers in and around their respective native cities of Dundee and Montrose. Both were influenced by surrealism and the work of Bruegel and focused on landscape, as can be seen in McIntosh Patrick&#x27;s &quot;Traquair House&quot; (1938) and more overtly Baird&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; (1934). Before his success in painting, McIntosh Patrick gained a reputation as an etcher. Leading figures in the field in the inter-war period included William Wilson (1905–72) and Ian Fleming (1906-94).

==Drama==
Playwrights associated with the Scottish Renaissance include Robert McLellan, Robert Kemp and Alexander Reid. Much of McLellan&#x27;s early work was first produced by the Curtain Theatre in Glasgow. His first success came in 1936 with Curtain&#x27;s production of his comedy, &quot;Toom Byres&quot;, set at the time of the Border reivers. This was followed in 1937 by &quot;Jamie the Saxt&quot;, featuring James VI in his prime. This latter production, with Duncan Macrae in the title role, is generally regarded as the one which confirmed McLellan&#x27;s reputation as a comic dramatist of substance in Scots. The production of another historical Scots comedy, &quot;The Bogle&quot;, was delayed by the Second World War, eventually being staged as &quot;Torwatletie&quot; by Glasgow Unity Theatre in 1946. A radio production of his verse play &quot;The Carlin Moth&quot; was broadcast in the same year. McLellan had written &quot;The Flouers o&#x27; Edinburgh&quot; (1947) in the expectation that it would be produced by the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow but the play was rejected by James Bridie, who was concerned about its overtly nationalist reading of Scottish history. It was given its first production by the Unity Players and a radio production was broadcast in 1951. It was produced by the Gateway Theatre Company in its 1954-55 season, and again in August 1957 as its Edinburgh International Festival production.

Robert Kemp pioneered the translation of existing dramatic works into Scots. His &quot;Let Wives Tak Tent&quot;, a rendering into Scots of Molière&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Ecole des femmes&quot;, was first produced at the Gateway Theatre in 1948, with Duncan Macrae in the lead role. In the same year, his adaptation of David Lyndsay&#x27;s &quot;Ane Pleasant Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis&quot; was staged at the Church of Scotland&#x27;s Assembly Hall as part of the Edinburgh International Festival. Together with Lennox Milne and Tom Fleming, Kemp founded the Gateway Theatre Company in 1953, taking on the roles of Chairman and resident playwright. &quot;The Laird o&#x27; Grippy&quot;, his adaptation of John Galt&#x27;s novel &quot;The Entail&quot; was staged at the Gateway in 1955, with John Laurie in the title role.

While McLellan&#x27;s most successful plays were set in the distant historic past, Alexander Reid preferred a half-mythic milieu. His two best-known plays are &quot;The Lass wi&#x27; the Muckle Mou&quot; (1950), which drew on the legend of Thomas the Rhymer, and &quot;The Warld&#x27;s Wonder&quot; (1953), about the mathematician and reputed magician Michael Scot. The Lass wi&#x27; the Muckle Mou was first staged at the Glasgow Citizens Theatre in November 1950. It was adapted as a television drama, first broadcast by the BBC on Tuesday 6 October 1953. &quot;The Warld&#x27;s Wonder&quot; was produced at the Gateway in the autumn of 1958.

Victor Carin, who became director of productions at the Gateway in 1963, contributed to the expansion of Scottish theatre&#x27;s repertoire of works in translation. &quot;The Hypochonriack&quot;, his translation into Scots of Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Imaginary Invalid&quot;, was performed by the Gateway Company during his first season in that role.
His second translation, &quot;The Servant o&#x27; Twa Maisters&quot;, translated from Carlo Goldoni&#x27;s &quot;The Servant of Two Masters&quot; was the Royal Lyceum Theatre Company&#x27;s debut production in 1965.

Sydney Goodsir Smith&#x27;s most successful contribution to the drama of the Scottish Renaissance was &quot;The Wallace&quot;. Initially broadcast on radio in a BBC production by Finlay J. MacDonald on 30 November 1959, it was first staged at the Kirk&#x27;s Assembly Hall in a production by Peter Potter as part of the 1960 Edinburgh International Festival. The play was revived by the Scottish Theatre Company in 1985.

==Music and dance==

The ideas of the Scottish Renaissance were brought to classical music by Francis George Scott (1880–1958), MacDiarmid&#x27;s former teacher, who set to music several of the poet&#x27;s works. Lancashire-born Ronald Stevenson (b. 1938) collaborated with Scott and both wrote in twelve-tone technique. Stevenson developed a musical idiom derived from Scottish music, creating settings of folk songs including concertos for his instrument, the piano (1966 and 1972). He also adapted work by Scottish Renaissance poets such as MacDiarmid, Sorley Maclean and William Soutar. The influence of Dmitri Shostakovich (1906–1975) was evident in the initials used in his large-scale piano work &quot;Passacaglia on DSCH&quot; (1963).

Robin Orr (1909–2006) and Cedric Thorpe Davie (1913–1983) were influenced by modernism and Scottish musical cadences. The influence of modernism can also be heard in the work of Erik Chisholm (1904–1965) in his &quot;Pibroch Piano Concerto&quot; (1930) and the &quot;Straloch suite for Orchestra&quot; (1933) and the sonata &quot;An Riobhan Dearg&quot; (1939). In 1928 he founded the Scottish Ballet Society (later the Celtic Ballet) with choreographer Margaret Morris, the long term partner of J. D. Fergusson. Together they created several ballets, including &quot;The Forsaken Mermaid&quot; (1940). He was also instrumental in the foundation of the Active Society for the Propagation of Contemporary Music, for which he brought leading composers to Glasgow to perform their work.

==Decline and influence==

Although many of the participants were to live until the 1970s and later, the truly revolutionary aspect of the Scottish Renaissance can be said to have been over by the 1960s, when it became eclipsed by various other movements, often international in nature.

The most famous clash was at the 1962 Edinburgh Writers Festival, where Hugh MacDiarmid denounced Alexander Trocchi, a younger Scottish writer, as &quot;cosmopolitan scum&quot;, and Trocchi claimed &quot;sodomy&quot; as a basis for his own writing. This is often seen as a clash of the generations, although it is rarely reported that the two writers corresponded with each other later, and became friends. Both were controversialists of sorts.

The Scottish Renaissance also had a profound effect on the Scottish independence movement, and the roots of the Scottish National Party may be said to be firmly in it.

The revival in both of Scotland&#x27;s indigenous languages is partly drawn from the renaissance.
==Major figures==

Other people connected with the Scottish renaissance, not mentioned previously, are listed below.

Note: These figures were not all contemporaries of the first generation of Scottish Renaissance writers and artists who emerged in the 1920s and 1930s. However, most did become involved with the movement in some form through interactions with figures such as Gunn or MacDiarmid, even if at a slightly later date.

<text>Hedley Grant Pearson Chapman (born 27 April 1949) is an Australian politician.

Born in Adelaide, South Australia, Chapman was educated at Prince Alfred College and the University of Adelaide and worked as a marketing executive in the oil industry and a self-employed management consultant prior to gaining Liberal Party pre-selection for the federal Division of Kingston in the House of Representatives leading to his election in Malcolm Fraser&#x27;s 1975 landslide win. In the 1980 election, Chapman held Kingston by 358 votes and served in the House of Representatives until his defeat at the 1983 federal election.

Chapman expressed opposition to the development of the Franklin River Dam. After visiting the area he said: &quot;It is a superb area. The visit reinforced my view that it would be a travesty if the dam went ahead.&quot;

Chapman unsuccessfully sought preselection for the new seat of Mayo in 1984, and unsuccessfully contested the state electorate of Fisher at the 1985 state election, but returned to federal politics in 1987 as a member of the Australian Senate representing South Australia.

He was defeated at the 2007 election when he was third on the SA Liberal ticket but only two Liberal candidates were elected.

In September 2010, Chapman was elected unopposed as President of the Liberal Party of Australia (South Australian Division) and was re-elected unopposed in 2011 and 2012.

== Personal life ==
Chapman is the joint-owner of the long-term lease over Wallerberdina Station, which is one of three properties short-listed for the prospective development of nuclear waste storage facility in South Australia.

<text>A no-frills or no frills service or product is one for which the non-essential features have been removed to keep the price low. The term &quot;frills&quot; originally refers to a style of fabric decoration. Something offered to customers for no additional charge may be designated as a &quot;frill&quot; – for example, free drinks on airline journeys, or a radio installed in a rental car. No-frills businesses operate on the principle that by removing luxurious additions, customers may be offered lower prices.

Common products and services for which no-frills brands exist include budget airlines, supermarkets, vacations and used vehicles.

==Supermarkets==
No-frills supermarkets are recognisable by their store design and business model.
*They do not decorate aisles. Prices are given on plain labels.
*Queueing at the checkout is relatively common, as staffing levels reflect average demand rather than peak demand. At actual peak times, customers often have to wait.
*Shopping bags are charged for, as they are seen as a frill. Thus many shoppers bring reusable shopping bags, buy shopping bags at a low fee, put their shopping in the cardboard boxes that the products originally came in, or put it directly in their shopping cart; customers must bag their own purchases. 
*They somewhat employ the Pareto principle when choosing which goods to offer, meaning that in most supermarkets, 20% of products on sale account for 80% of what customers buy. Therefore, they only stock the most commonly sold products.
*They take credit cards, cash, debit cards and/or mobile payment apps.
*Hours are 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily, although some stores are open 24 hours.
*They often do not sell branded items, except in the case of special purchases, which are almost always at a discounted price. Instead, they sell generic or private label products.
*Some products are sold in different sizes.
*The shopping carts have a coin-operated slot, to ensure that the trolleys are kept on site.
*They usually lack a butcher shop, bakery or deli counters, thus meat, and cold meats are sold precut in chilled vacuum packs.
*Unlike regular supermarkets which have separate teams of staff for the shop floor, the back warehouse, doing the cleaning and dealing with the clerical work, no frills supermarkets instead have a single multi-tasking team of workers dealing with all aspects of supermarket work.
*No in-store background music, although some use satellite radio.

Examples of no-frills supermarket chains include:
*Dia and Ed are all part of the Dia Group, which is in turn part of the Carrefour Group. (Brazil, Spain)

American supermarket chain Pathmark used &quot;No Frills&quot; as a house brand.

==Automobiles==

In the United States, a no-frills automobile model typically has a minimum of convenience equipment, a less powerful engine and spartan trim.

Frequently, these models represent the lowest-priced version of a larger selection of more lavishly equipped and trimmed models of that same car. Often, the less-expensive models are sold with a manual transmission and have a shorter options list. Early 1950s American examples include the Chevrolet 150 and Kaiser-Frazer Henry J. These were larger cars than those produced in the US in the 1940s gasoline rationing period by Crosley, who shut down in 1952.

One of the more famous no-frills cars was the Studebaker Scotsman, which was on sale from 1957 to 1959. These cars came with a low-grade cloth-trimmed front seat and contained only a driver&#x27;s side sun visor, minimal soundproofing, no door armrests and painted trim (in lieu of chrome trim); even routine convenience items, such as a cigarette lighter and dome light were not present. Buyers were allowed to buy only a low-cost heater and a few other trim and convenience items from a short options list; a radio was not offered as an option on this model (unlike Studebaker&#x27;s more expensive models).

During the 1960s and early 1970s, American automakers offered several trim levels of full-sized models (each having a different name), with a price-leading no-frills versions. Examples included the Chevrolet Biscayne, Ford Custom 500, and Plymouth Fury I. While ostensibly targeted toward fleet buyers and business customers where luxury is not a concern, these cars were also available to private customers. While many of these cars were typically sold with the standard six-cylinder or basic V-8 engine with the standard three-speed manual transmission, many of these price-leading models were also available with the full range of engines and transmissions, including those that were performance-oriented, unlike the later no-frills models that had restricted performance options. Additionally, marketing brochures typically extolled the virtues of these economy models, pointing out such features as durable and easy-to-care for upholstery with wide color availability, beauty in styling despite minimal exterior trim adornment, and features shared with more luxurious models such as suspension and ride quality, engine and transmission availability, and standard safety and convenience features—all available even for budget-conscious buyers.

By the late 1960s, a vast majority of all price-leading models were built and sold with V-8 engines and automatic transmission, as consumer needs were changing, and were even being built and sold with luxury comfort and convenience features once seen only on the higher-priced model lines, including air conditioning and power steering. Only a small handful of base model vehicles were sold with the basic six-cylinder/three-speed manual transmission powertrain, without optional extras. By the early 1970s, Plymouth, Ford and Chevrolet had switched to all V-8 engine/automatic transmission powertrains for the full-sized model lines. With customers turning more to volume models that were better trimmed, upholstered and equipped (even with price a primary consideration), the Big Three dropped their Spartan-trimmed price-leading models, such as the Chevrolet Biscayne and Ford Custom, or relegated them completely to fleet sales only.

During the gasoline crisis of the 1970s, many American automakers began offering no-frills models on their compact lines of cars (such as the Ford Pinto MPG, and Plymouth Duster &quot;Feather Duster&quot;). As before, these models usually had spartan trim (vinyl seats with rubber floor covering); fewer convenience items than the more expensive models (e.g., no cigarette lighter); lighter-weight components (such as aluminum on various engine, body and suspension components); and a manual transmission.

Most no-frills cars are sold to fleet buyers, such as taxi companies or police departments. However, these models are generally available to cost-conscious private customers whose primary concerns were price, fuel economy and basic low-cost transportation.

The concept of a no-frills car in the European market was common in the 1950s with cars such as the Ford Abeille or the Citroën ID Normale. The Dacia Logan is an example of a recent no-frills car in Europe. Another example is Fiat Albea.

In Argentina and Brazil, the no-frills category takes a considerable share of the new car market. Examples of cost cuts in base versions include:

* very little or no soundproofing
* low quality plastics
* substitution of rubber on the dashboard to cheaper (rough) plastic
* spring-based instead of acceleration-based seatbelt retraction mechanisms
* no seatbelt height or seat height adjustment
* no anti-lock braking systems or airbags, except where required by law
* no steering wheel adjustments
* cheaper paint processes
* facelifted models instead of new generations such as Volkswagen Santana, Fiat Palio, Fiat Uno, Volkswagen Kombi, Volkswagen Citi Golf, Chevrolet Corsa
* cast iron cylinder heads and engine blocks
* no lambda sensor
* retrofitting old generation components (older, less efficient engines, platforms, dashboard components) on a European designed vehicle: Ford Fiesta, Fiat Idea, Fiat Punto, Vauxhall Meriva, Volkswagen Polo
* no lamps on the lateral direction lights or remotion of the lateral direction lights at all (meaningless)
* single-piece plastic bumpers; any grills are designed by placing indentations on the plastic
* low-quality springs on the suspension, compensated by a taller and harder adjustment
* less maintenance on the tools used to build the vehicles
* smaller and more restrictive catalytic converters

In some markets, often in the developing world, very aggressive forms of no-frills cars may be available. For example, the supermini and city cars sold in the Mercosur markets, such as the Chevrolet Celta, Chevrolet Corsa, Fiat Uno, Fiat Palio, Ford Ka and Volkswagen Gol tend to be noisy and feature cost cuttings like:

==Airlines==
No-frills airlines are airlines that offer low fares but eliminate all non-essential services, such as complimentary food, in-flight entertainment systems, and business-class seating. A no-frills airline will typically cut overhead by flying from more remote airports (with lower access charges) and by using a single type of aircraft. Aircraft cabin interiors may be fitted out with minimum comforts, dispensing with luxuries such as seat-back video screens, reclining seats and blinds; some airlines choose to carry advertising inside the cabin to increase revenue. Should meals be served, they must be paid for in full.

Some airlines also extend the definition of &quot;frills&quot; to include standard services and conveniences; for example, a no-frills airline may charge passengers an additional fee for check-in luggage, using airport check-in desks, or even providing wheelchairs.

== Rail services ==
Based on the no-frills airline model, the recent liberalisation of rail licensing in Europe has brought about a no-frills budget rail travel industry. Examples include; 

* Ouigo (France) - Operated by SNCF
* Ouigo Spain - Operated by SNCF
* Avlo (Spain) - Operated by Renfe
* Lumo (UK) - Operated by FirstGroup
* Izy (France / Benelux) - Offered by Thalys
* FlixTrain (Germany / Sweden) - Open access operator

==Hotels==

Another example of a type of no frills service is lodgings. In more extreme circumstances, the line between a hotel and a hostel is blurred due to the removal of amenities. Notable no-frills chains include Motel 6, Econo Lodge, Tune Hotels, Ibis Budget, HotelF1, easyHotel and Zip by Premier Inn.
Features of no-frills hotels rooms are that themselves are smaller and more spartan in trim. Examples and cases included with Zip rooms are twice as small (8.5 m2) as standard Premier Inn rooms. (20 m2), beds in Econo Lodge are put on boxes, so to make cleaning easier and with many Ibis Budget hotels, the reception is only opened at limited hours. Most no frills hotels don&#x27;t have door keys, instead they use either inexpensive swipe-keys or digital door locks. Many of them have no pictures on the walls, baths in the bathrooms or excessive furniture like minibars, fridges or dressing tables. Bedding is limited to pillows and duvets. Some like Tune and easyHotel even go as far as putting advertisements on the walls and in case of Zip some rooms even having no windows, instead having a sunlight-powered light box.

Like no frills airlines which charge people for seat reservations and food, no frills hotels themselves charge extra for any superfluous extras like non-basic TV channels, breakfasts; which themselves are just limited to a continental style, tea-and-coffee making facilities, Wi-Fi internet, daily maid service; normally cleaning the room is only done when the guest leaves, and toiletries and supplement towels.
The Finnish hotel chain Omenahotelli lacks reception. Room bookings are handled online only. Instead of a physical key, hotel customers receive a digital door code. Omenahotelli guests usually spend their entire hotel stay without meeting any hotel employees.

==Holiday==
No-frills holidays are holidays which, like no-frills airlines, do not include unnecessary services such as:

* in-flight meals
* travel representatives
* transfers between the airport and the hotel
* entertainment
* luxury accommodation

Such holidays usually have a simple fare scheme, in which fares typically increase during peak seasons, and also as more people sign up for the holiday. This rewards early reservations, and is known as &quot;yield management&quot;.

Examples of no-frills holiday companies are:

* Just, part of the Thomson/TUI group
* Qbic, low-cost design hotels

==Gyms==

Compared to regular fitness gyms, there has been a growing number of no frills gyms. No frills gyms are significantly different from regular gyms in the amenities offered. The ways in which these differ are:

* No reception: everything like registration and booking classes is done online.
* No fitness classes, or fitness classes are available at a supplementary cost on top of regular monthly membership fees. 
* No swimming pool, hot tub, sauna, solarium or beauty spa, due to the cost of running such facilities, e.g., needing to have a staff member there at all times and frequent cleaning.
* No café or relaxation room, drinks and snacks are available through vending machines. 
* Most of the fitness machines are self-powered, rather than electrically powered thus cutting down of power costs and running costs.

Examples of no frills gyms are easyGym, Fit4less and PureGym in the UK, Basic-Fit in Benelux and France, and McFit in Germany.

==Filling stations==

In the Netherlands and other European countries, a no frills filling station refers to unattended filling stations consisting solely of self-service pumps that only support pay at the pump. They do not include any other facilities on-site, and service is provided via a phone line. If there is a problem, drivers are to call a hotline using an on-site telephone for assistance.

Notable chains includes Dutch chains Tango, Q8 Easy, TinQ, Firezone, Esso Express &amp; Shell Express, and the Austrian chain Diskont.

==Gaming systems==
A few Nintendo gaming systems have model revisions that strip out non-essential features, such as the Wii&#x27;s Wii Mini, the Game Boy Advance&#x27;s Game Boy Micro and the Nintendo Switch&#x27;s Switch Lite.

==Others==
Other examples of no-frills companies include: cinemas (easyCinema), bus companies (easyBus, Magic Bus (Stagecoach), Eastern), food ranges (Tesco Value, Walmart/Asda SmartPrice), mobile phone companies (easyMobile, Telmore), and marketing (low-cost marketing).

<text>Viewtiful Joe 2, known in Japan as is a 2004 beat &#x27;em up game developed by Clover Studio and published by Capcom for the GameCube and PlayStation 2. The game&#x27;s story begins where the original &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; left off, with the beginning of an alien invasion of Movieland by a villainous organization called &quot;Gedow&quot;. The group is led by an unseen being known as the &quot;Black Emperor&quot;, whose proclaims his goal to collect the special Rainbow Oscars, seven statuettes which contain the &quot;power of the happy ending&quot;. Straight from their previous adventure, superhero Viewtiful Joe and his girlfriend Sexy Silvia quickly charge themselves with stopping Gedow&#x27;s evil plans.

Very similar to its predecessor, &quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot; is a combination of 2D and 3D cel-shaded graphics with action, platforming, and beat &#x27;em up gameplay elements. Using either of the characters Viewtiful Joe or Sexy Silvia, the player must utilize &quot;VFX Powers&quot; in order to battle enemies and solve puzzles. An integral part of the gameplay, these special abilities include being able to slow down, speed up, zoom into, or replay the onscreen action. Also akin to the original game, &quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot; sold modestly but garnered considerable praise from critics due to its stylish graphics and gameplay.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot; is a 2D beat &#x27;em up which combines side-scrolling and platforming. The player takes control of either of the characters Joe or Silvia to complete tasks within each stage, such as defeating enemies and bosses, and solving puzzles. Within Movieworld, Joe has &quot;VFX Powers&quot; such as Slow (similar to bullet-time), Mach Speed, and Zoom at his disposal to defeat the enemy. He is joined by girlfriend Silvia, who has also acquired VFX powers. However, Silvia has &quot;Replay&quot;, which allows her to record and repeat an event three times in succession, instead of Joe&#x27;s Mach Speed. The Replay power must be used wisely, as although it allow the player to do three times the amount of damage on an enemy, being hit while using it will incur three times the amount of damage to the player.

During the game, the player utilize a gameplay mechanic called &quot;Viewtiful Switch&quot; in order to swap between Joe and Silvia at any time. The two characters share both their amount of health and the VFX meter. Holding the switch button down for a certain amount of time enables the two player characters to use a special attack involving the transformable robot Six Machine. At intervals between stages, V-Points can be spent to purchase new moves for either Joe or Silvia, or to improve their existing powers, which includes making Joe&#x27;s Mach Speed more effective or upgrading Silvia&#x27;s Desperados. V-Points can additionally be spent to give the player more maximum health, add extra lives, or be used to buy power-ups such as the VFX Turbo Charger, which slows the drainage of the VFX Gauge.

Aside from the main game, &quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot; also contains an optional gameplay extra called the &quot;36 Chambers of Viewtiful&quot;, a series of stages which test the player&#x27;s skills. The objectives include defeating a set number of enemies or scoring a number of V-Points within a time limit, and dodging an onslaught of swords without dying.

==Plot==
The plot of &quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot; continues immediately from the ending of the previous game. Having just saved Movieland, Viewtiful Joe and his girlfriend (and new partner) Sexy Silvia learn from Captain Blue that the world will be threatened twice more. Joe and Silvia leave Captain Blue&#x27;s space station to attend to an alien invasion from the forces of Gedow. The leader of Gedow, the Black Emperor, suddenly attacks Captain Blue and turns him into a statue called a &quot;Rainbow Oscar&quot;, one of seven in a set that represents Movieland&#x27;s power of the happy ending. With their power, the Black Emperor intends to conquer Movieland.

Cast off to &quot;the fringes&quot; of Movieland by Gedow, Joe and Silvia fight their way through a prehistoric film and defeat the Tyrannosaurus rex soldier, Big John. Joe and Silvia obtain a Rainbow Oscar from Big John just as Joe&#x27;s father Jet arrives in the theater and demands that they come back to the real world and clean up the mess they made. Silvia manages to convince Jet to help them rescue Captain Blue, and Jet agrees by setting up new films for her and Joe to journey through in search of the Rainbow Oscars.

Joe and Silvia continue their battle against Gedow through an adventure film in an ancient temple, where a narcoleptic golem named Flinty Stone guards the second Rainbow Oscar, and then journey into a futuristic film where Gedow&#x27;s top scientist Dr. Cranken and his creation Cameo Leon reveal the Black Emperor&#x27;s plan to combine the Oscars with an evil reel of celluloid called the Black Film. Later, Joe&#x27;s rival Alastor interferes during a samurai movie and tries to steal the spotlight. Jet changes films after Alastor is defeated, but unwittingly puts on the Black Film and sends its evil into Movieland, which also transforms Alastor into a murderous beast. After Joe defeats Alastor a second time, Jet destroys the Black Film.

With four Rainbow Oscars, Joe and Silvia are sent to a movie that takes place in the frozen mountains, where Frost Tiger (brother of Fire Leo, a boss from the previous game) protects the fifth Oscar and demands that Joe prove his inner strength in order to be worthy of it. Though successful, Joe&#x27;s victory is short-lived when he is fooled by an impostor Silvia into giving Gedow the Oscars. Faced with his disastrous mistake, Joe and Silvia return to the original &quot;Captain Blue&quot; movie where they encounter Dr. Cranken again. The mad scientist reveals the impostor Silvia as Miss Bloody Rachel, a shapeshifting android programmed to destroy the heroes. As Rachel transforms into the previous bosses to fight back, Joe and Silvia attempt to reason with her by introducing the concept of a heart to her programming. Slowly, Rachel begins to understand and eventually chooses to side with the heroes. After Joe and Silvia finish off Dr. Cranken for good, Rachel gives them the sixth Rainbow Oscar.

The final movie, a science-fiction film set in deep space, is where the Black Emperor and the last Rainbow Oscar reside. When confronted by the heroes, the Black Emperor throws a fully restored Black Film onto the projector and uses its added power to summon his giant robot Dark Kaiser. Joe and Silvia summon their own &quot;Six x Six Majin&quot; to destroy Dark Kaiser and recover the last Oscar, but Jet suddenly appears in the movie and steals all seven. Revealing a Black V-Watch on his wrist, Jet transforms into the Dark Emperor and thanks Joe for giving him the Oscars, then infuses their power into himself to become Jet Black, the Dark Hero.

Now able to use his Movieland powers in the real world, Jet Black crashes the Viewtiful Awards Ceremony, leaving Joe and Silvia powerless to stop him. As they put up a futile effort to fight back, the crowd starts cheering for Joe and Silvia, which gives them the power to transform and ultimately defeat Jet Black. Captain Blue is restored to normal and reveals that Jet was his best friend and cinematographer, but had found the Black Film one day and became entranced by its power and that of the Rainbow Oscars. In the end, it is revealed that all Jet really wanted was to prove himself as a hero to his own son Joe.

As Joe and Jet reconcile, a dark castle appears in the distance, heralding the arrival of Captain Blue&#x27;s last foreseen threat. Jet explains that the secret of the Black Film and his Black V-Watch lies within the castle, as well as an enemy unlike any other. Undeterred by Jet&#x27;s ominous warning, Viewtiful Joe and Sexy Silvia strike a pose as they set out to save the world once more.

==Development==
&quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot; was developed by &quot;Team Viewtiful&quot;, a part of Capcom&#x27;s subsidiary Clover Studio. The game was produced by Atsushi Inaba and directed by Masaaki Yamada. Hideki Kamiya, the director of the original &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot;, contributed to the storyline scenario of the sequel. At the time, Kamiya was signed on as director of &quot;Ōkami&quot;, but he wanted to write the story of &quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot; to ensure continuity. Kumiko Suekane once again supervised the character designs, and and Sayaka Morita co-composed the game&#x27;s soundtrack. Suleputer released the soundtrack on a double album titled &quot;Viewtiful Joe + Viewtiful Joe 2 Original Soundtrack&quot; in Japan on December 22, 2004, which includes the musical scores from both games.

Development on &quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot; began in the August 2003, shortly after the release of the first &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; on the GameCube. The game was officially announced by Capcom on April 21, 2004. Despite Inaba&#x27;s statement that he does not like to create sequels, he said that he did want to create another &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; game to include several elements that they could not fit into the original game. Inaba also noted that the team took into account the difficulty of the first game and attempted to make &quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot; accessible to both casual and hardcore gamers. The GameCube and PS2 versions were developed simultaneously and feature the same content. In early previews of the game, Silvia and Joe were shown onscreen fighting at the same time, hinting at cooperative gameplay. This feature was later dropped. When the Replay VFX Power was announced, Inaba was asked if any other VFX Powers would be included in the final game. He answered, &quot;In terms of adding more -- there simply aren&#x27;t enough buttons on the controller&quot;.

During the game&#x27;s release in North America, Capcom and IGN held the &quot;Be More Viewtiful! Sweepstakes&quot;, a contest in which entrants could win merchandise including either version of the game, a t-shirt with an &quot;HMD&quot; design, a skateboard, and a &quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot; strategy guide by BradyGames. A desktop LCD clock was also released by Capcom during the game&#x27;s North American debut. A demo of &quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot; featured on North American PS2 preview discs made news when it was reported that playing the demo would cause a bug to completely erase all data on any inserted memory cards. Sony Computer Entertainment of America issued an apology and gave those affected a choice between several lesser-rated, previously released titles.

==Reception==
Reviews for &quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot; were generally positive. The GameCube and PS2 versions hold GameRankings scores of 85% and 84% respectively. Metacritic currently lists the respective versions at 86 and 85 out of 100. IGN ranked it as the 89th best PlayStation 2 game. The staff felt that it was an example of a quality sequel.

&quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine gave the GameCube version of &quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot; a 28 out of 40 and gave the PS2 version a 27 out of 40. IGN gave a rating of 9.0, citing the game&#x27;s deep and satisfying gameplay, and that &quot;all sequels should be this good&quot;.

During Capcom&#x27;s fiscal year 2004, &quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot; sold 270,000 copies in North America and 80,000 copies in Japan. The game sold poorly in United Kingdom, failing to enter the 40 top-selling games during its week of release in the region. Although the ending for &quot;Viewtiful Joe 2&quot; suggests an immediate continuation to the plot of the series, a &quot;Viewtiful Joe 3&quot; has not been produced. Two spin-off games (&quot;Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble&quot; and &quot;Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble!&quot;) were released in 2005. Clover Studio was dissolved in 2007 and all its intellectual properties defaulted to Capcom. Many of Clover&#x27;s key members including Inaba and Kamiya formed the third-party developer PlatinumGames that same year. Capcom has stated that they have no plans to continue with the &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; series. Kamiya has expressed interest in finishing the story of the series, however unlikely that may be.

<doc id="995538" wikidata="Q144879" url="?curid=995538" title="Beilun, Ningbo">
<text> (; Wu: &quot;Poh-len Chiu&quot;) is a district of Ningbo in Zhejiang province, China. It is dominated by Beilun port, an international port of the easternmost edge of the southern coast of Hangzhou Bay. It primarily services the regional city of Ningbo. Beilun district has 380,000 permanent residents and 850,000 residents. Beilun district has a land area of 615 square kilometers, a sea area of 258 square kilometers and a coastline of 150 kilometers. It is the largest sea area and the longest coastline area within the jurisdiction of Ningbo city.

==Beilun port==
Originally a small fishing town, the presence of a deep sea lane with year-round minimum depth of 17 meters stretching along the coast of Beilun motivated the Chinese Government to build one of the nation&#x27;s largest deep sea port here. The port is further protected from storms by the mountainous islets of Zhoushan just off the coast of Beilun.

14.31 billion yuan has been invested in the Beilun port. With the completion of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge in 2008, Beilun is set to receive increased volumes of international freight and be more closely tied to the metropolis of Shanghai. It has been proposed that Beilun port be managed by the Shanghai port authority. Swift and dangerous undersea currents in Shanghai contribute to an inefficient port that costs the city a great deal to keep open, and even then it is often only usable during high tide. Beilun is also home to a small free trade zone that has a concentration of manufacturers focused on vacuum formed packaging and an older plant that manufactured window air conditioners for Fedders.

Guodian Beilun Power Station, one of the world largest coal power stations, is installed in Beilun&#x27;s Xinqi town, and managed by the national SOE China Guodian Corporation. Built in two phases, starting in 1988 with a loan from the World Bank, with main equipment imported from France and Japan.

== Geology ==
Beilun district is one of the six municipal districts in Ningbo city. Beilun district stands on the coast of the east China sea. Approximately 62 CPC central committee and state leaders have visited the district for inspection and guidance.

About 7000 years ago the area that now makes up the Beilun district was underwater with only the Tiantai mountains such as Taibai mountain and Lingfeng mountain visible. As the tides ebbed the land was gradually revealed and the peoples living in the area built ponds to block the tide and enclosed the sea area to set up land and improve the landscape. The regional landform of Beilun district is mainly characterized by hills and plains in the northwest and the middle, and hills in the southeast. It was separated by the Lingfeng mountain, thus, west of the mountain is the Changshan plain and east of the mountain is the Chaiqiao plain.

The area is intertwined with water sources such as the Xiaolijiang, Yan, Tai, and Lujiang rivers, which originate from the southwest Shan &#x27;ao, a piece of flat land in a mountain range, and flow through two plains. Beilun district belongs to a subtropical Marine climate, which is mild and humid, four distinct seasons, fog days less and frost-free period. It has abundant rainfall, the average annual precipitation is about 1310 mm and the average annual temperature is about 16.7°C.

<doc id="995544" wikidata="Q7324825" url="?curid=995544" title="Richard Colbeck">
<text>Richard Mansell Colbeck (born 5 April 1958) is an Australian politician. He has been a Senator for Tasmania since 2018, representing the Liberal Party, and served a previous term in the Senate from 2002 to 2016. Colbeck served as the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services and Minister for Sport in the Second Morrison Ministry from December 2020 until May 2022, when the Albanese ministry was appointed. Previous to this, he was the Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Youth and Sport since May 2019.

Colbeck was first elected at the 2001 federal election, and was a parliamentary secretary in the Howard government. Colbeck served as the Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Investment and the Minister for Tourism and International Education in the Turnbull government from 2015 to 2016, but was defeated at the 2016 election. He returned to the Senate following a recount after Stephen Parry was disqualified during the parliamentary eligibility crisis.

Colbeck is a member of the Moderate/Modern Liberal faction of the Liberal Party.

==Early life==
Colbeck was born in Myrtleford, Victoria, and was educated at Devonport Technical College. He was a building estimator and supervisor, managing director and proprietor of a building consultancy before entering politics.

In his early years, Colbeck gained qualifications in Small Business Management; Technology (Building); and Carpentry and Joinery Trade and Proficiency. He was an apprentice carpenter and joiner between 1977 and 1979; a trainee estimator and supervisor 1977–79; and manager 1979–84. Between 1984 and 1989 he was a building estimator and supervisor; and managing director and proprietor of building consultancy from 1989.

From 1993 to 1996, and from 1998 to 2000, Colbeck served as the president of the Devonport Chamber of Commerce. From 1998 to 2001, he was a member of the board of directors of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI). From 1999 to 2002, he was an Alderman of the Devonport City Council.

==Political career==
On 4 February 2002, Colbeck was appointed to the Senate by the Governor of Tasmania under section 15 of the Constitution, to fill the casual vacancy caused by the retirement of Senator Jocelyn Newman. He had already been elected to the Senate at the 2001 federal election, to a term beginning on 1 July 2002. He was re-elected in 2007.

Colbeck was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in October 2004. In January 2006 he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration. With the defeat of the government led by John Howard in 2007, he was appointed to the shadow ministry as Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Health. He was shifted to the role of Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in September 2008. In September 2010, Colbeck was appointed Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Fisheries and Forestry and Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Innovation, Industry and Science by the new opposition leader Tony Abbott. Abbott nominated Colbeck for appointment to the Abbott Ministry as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture following the 2013 federal election.

Following the 2015 leadership spill that saw Malcolm Turnbull replace Abbott as prime minister, Colbeck was appointed as the Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Investment and the Minister for Tourism and International Education in the First Turnbull Ministry from September 2015 to July 2016.

At the 2016 federal election, Colbeck was demoted to fifth place on the Liberal Senate ticket. He blamed factional opponent Eric Abetz for his failure to win a higher position on the ticket. He polled an unusually high below-the-line tally, attributed to a strong &quot;personal vote&quot;, but nonetheless lost his seat. Colbeck unexpectedly returned to the Senate in February 2018, after Senate President Stephen Parry was caught up in the parliamentary eligibility crisis. The Court of Disputed Returns conducted a recount and declared Colbeck elected.

Colbeck is considered to belong to the moderate wing of the Tasmanian Liberals, and supported Malcolm Turnbull during the 2018 leadership spills; he was reportedly the only Tasmanian Liberal not to sign the petition calling for a second spill. In the new Morrison Ministry, he was appointed Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources. Prior to the 2019 federal election he was preselected in first place on the Liberals&#x27; Senate ticket and was re-elected.

After the election, Colbeck was appointed Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Youth and Sport in the Second Morrison Ministry. Between August and September 2020, Colbeck was criticised for his handling of COVID-19 outbreaks in aged care facilities in Victoria, resulting in the deaths of 350 aged care residents as of late August 2020. There were calls by the Labor opposition for Colbeck to be sacked as aged care minister. In September 2020, Colbeck was also censured by the Senate by 25–21 votes for failing to take responsibility for a &quot;crisis in the aged care sector&quot;, but he was defended by the Prime Minister who said that the majority of the sector was unaffected during the pandemic. In December 2020, his aged care portfolio was subsequently passed to health minister Greg Hunt, with Colbeck continuing as Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services and Minister for Sport. He held these portfolios until May 2022, following the appointment of the Albanese ministry.

During Colbeck&#x27;s tenure as sport minister, Sport Integrity Australia was created in 2020 as a replacement for the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority. A new National Sports Tribunal was also created as the avenue for appeals, replacing the role of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Colbeck called for the International Shooting Sport Federation to remove Russian billionaire Vladimir Lisin as its President.

<text>The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UT Chattanooga, UTC, or Chattanooga) is a public university in Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States. It was founded in 1886 and is part of the University of Tennessee System.

==History==

UTC was founded in 1886 as the then-private and racially exclusive Chattanooga University, which was soon merged in 1889 with the Athens-based Grant Memorial University (now Tennessee Wesleyan University), becoming the Chattanooga campus of U.S. Grant Memorial University. In 1907, the school changed its name to University of Chattanooga. In 1964 the university merged with Zion College, which had been established in 1949 and later became Chattanooga City College. In 1969 the University of Chattanooga joined the UT system and became the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.

The University of Chattanooga Foundation Inc. is a private corporation, created in 1969, that manages the university&#x27;s private endowment.

==Administration==
UTC uses the semester system, with five optional &quot;mini-terms&quot; in the summer. The leadership of the campus rests upon the chancellor, who answers to the UT System President. The university is currently headed by Chancellor Steve Angle.

===Leadership===

The following people have had the post of President or Chancellor at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC). Prior to 1969, the institution was known as the University of Chattanooga (1907–1969), U.S. Grant University (1889–1907), and Chattanooga University (1886–1889). At the time of UTC&#x27;s establishment in 1969, the name of the leader became chancellor instead of president.

==Academics==
Chattanooga is best known for its nationally ranked Business program, Engineering, Nursing, English, Chemistry, Accounting, Psychology, Music, and Education departments. The university offers over 140 undergraduate majors and concentrations, and over 50 undergraduate minors. Chattanooga also offers nearly 100 graduate programs and concentrations, including a highly ranked master&#x27;s program in Industrial and Organizational Psychology and PhD programs in Computational Engineering and Physical Therapy. In an effort to expand the horizons of its student body, UTC recently began an exchange program with Kangnung National University of Kangnung, South Korea.

==Research==
SimCenter is UTC&#x27;s computational engineering and simulation center. In November 2005, SimCenter was listed as the 89th most powerful supercomputer by Top500. On November 20, 2007, the university announced the center has been named a National Center for Computational Engineering. More recently, The SimCenter provided the academic research for a new source of alternative energy unveiled by Bloom Energy Corporation in Sunnyvale, California.

The Clinical Infectious Disease Control Research Unit is a research interest group composed of UTC faculty, students, and local partners. Members of the CIDC have had their research published in peer-reviewed journals, as well as presented at professional meetings and conferences. More information on their current projects and recent events can be found on UTC&#x27;s website. 

==Campus==
The university is served by CARTA bus routes 4, 7, 10, 14, 19, and 28. Route 14 only operates on weekdays during fall and spring terms, when the university is session. The route runs on and off the campus on McCallie, Houston, Vine, Douglas, Fifth, and Palmetto Streets. A recent extension serves Third, O&#x27;Neal, and Central Streets, as well as Erlanger Hospital, and a large parking lot at Engel Stadium. All students showing valid university identification cards (MocsCards) ride for free on all CARTA routes, year-round.

===Patten Chapel===
Patten Chapel is one of the busiest sanctuaries in Chattanooga. Mostly weddings and memorial services are held there. A bride&#x27;s room has been prepared and is always ready. Reserving the chapel should be done around a year in advance as its popularity sees events almost every weekend. Wedding receptions are not hosted at the chapel.

===Lupton Hall===
Formerly the Lupton Memorial Library, Lupton Hall, named for T. Cartter and Margaret Rawlings Lupton, was constructed in 1974 to replace the aging John Storrs Fletcher Library (which has since been restored and renamed Fletcher Hall). As of 2005, the library&#x27;s collection includes nearly 2 million items, including the Fellowship of Southern Writers archives. In early 2008 the university was granted funding to build a new library.

The university broke ground in 2010 for the new $48 million library. Construction was completed on the UTC Library in January 2015.

Following the opening of the new UTC Library, Lupton Hall began renovations in 2018. Opening to students and faculty in 2020, Lupton&#x27;s entire 116,000 square feet of available space had been gutted and rebuilt to include student centers, academic departments under the College of Arts and Sciences, various classroom spaces, and a new on-campus restaurant, &#x27;Freshens&#x27;.

==Athletics==
Chattanooga&#x27;s colors are navy and old gold; their men&#x27;s teams and athletes are nicknamed Mocs, and women&#x27;s teams and athletes are Lady Mocs. Chattanooga athletics teams compete in NCAA Division I (FCS for football) in the Southern Conference (SoCon) and have been ranked as a national top 100 athletic program by The National Association of Collegiate Director&#x27;s of Athletics (NACDA) in the Division I Learfield Sports Director&#x27;s Cup.

;Basketball

Chattanooga&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball program has been among the best in the Southern Conference since joining the league in 1977–78. The Mocs have won 10 SoCon Tournament titles, tied for first all-time with former member West Virginia and Davidson, 10 regular-season league championships prior to the change to the division format in 1995 and seven division titles for 27 totals titles. In 1997, led by coach Mack McCarthy and Chattanooga native Johnny Taylor, the Mocs made a run to the Sweet 16 as a No. 14 seed, beating Georgia and Illinois before falling to Providence. Before making the move to Division I, Chattanooga won the Division II National Championship in 1977. In July 2008, the team was ranked number 48 on the ESPN list of the most prestigious basketball programs since the 1984–85 season.

The Mocs won the SoCon tournament once again in 2009. Defeating the College of Charleston Cougars 80–69 in the championship game on their home court at the McKenzie Arena, the Mocs punched their ticket to the NCAA tournament, their first since 2005.

Jimmy Fallon from &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; chose the Mocs as his team of choice going into the 2009 NCAA tournament. The Wednesday night (March 18) show included a live Skype chat with Head Coach John Shulman, as well as representatives of the pep band and cheerleading squads made in studio. Fallon&#x27;s house band The Roots wrote and performed an ode to Shulman titled, &quot;The Don Juan of the SoCon&quot; and Shulman and his six seniors (Nicchaeus Doaks, Zach Ferrell, Kevin Goffney, Khalil Hartwell, Stephen McDowell and Keyron Sheard) made an in-studio appearance following their tournament game with UConn.

The Lady Mocs are the most successful women&#x27;s basketball program in Southern Conference history with 15 regular season titles since 1983–1984, 10 consecutive conference championships at the end of 2008–2009 and 14 overall conference championships.

;Golf
The men&#x27;s golf squad won its third consecutive Southern Conference trophy and finished 18th in the NCAA Championships in 2009.

In August 2012, UTC golfer Steven Fox won the U.S. Amateur Championship.

Women&#x27;s golf posted a 3.46 team GOA in the spring while advancing to the NCAA Division I finals in just the second year of the program since disbanding in the mid-1980s.

;Softball
The Mocs’ softball team has won 11 regular season titles and 10 SoCon Tournament Championships. They have also made 7 NCAA tournament appearances.

;Wrestling
Chattanooga is home to the only NCAA Division I wrestling program in the state of Tennessee. The Mocs&#x27; wrestling team has won 8 of the past 9 Socon title&#x27;s since the 2012–2013 academic year.

;Football

The team plays in the Southern Conference (SoCon) in Division I FCS (formerly I-AA). Hall of Famer Terrell Owens played wide receiver for the Mocs from 1992 to 1995. The team won three-straight SoCon championships from 2013 to 2015. They play in Finley Stadium, which hosted the NCAA Division I Football Championship from 1997 to 2009.

In 2021, the team fired its offensive line coach, Chris Malone, for a social media post that was derogatory about Georgia and Civil Rights leader Stacey Abrams.

==Athletic venues==
* Chamberlain Field – (1908–1997)
* Finley Stadium – (1997–present)
* Maclellan Gymnasium and natatorium – (Gym opened 1961; natatorium opened 1968)
* McKenzie Arena – (1982–present) aka the Roundhouse, due to its circular shape and the city&#x27;s association with the railroad industry.

==University nickname==
The school&#x27;s athletic teams are called the Mocs. The teams were nicknamed Moccasins until 1996. (The origin of the name is uncertain; however, Moccasin Bend is a large horseshoe-shaped bend in the Tennessee River directly below Lookout Mountain.)

The mascot has taken on four distinct forms. A water moccasin was the mascot in the 1920s, and then a moccasin shoe (known as &quot;The Shoe&quot;) was used as the school&#x27;s mascot at times in the 1960s and 1970s. From the 1970s until 1996, the mascot was Chief Moccanooga, an exaggerated Cherokee tribesman.

In 1996, the Moccasins name and image were dropped in favor of the shortened &quot;Mocs&quot; and an anthropomorphized northern mockingbird, in accordance with the state bird, named &quot;Scrappy&quot; dressed as a railroad engineer. The school&#x27;s main athletic logo features Scrappy riding a train (a reference to Chattanooga&#x27;s history as a major railroad hub and to the song &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot;). The mascot takes its name from former football coach A. C. &quot;Scrappy&quot; Moore.

==Fight song==
The fight song for UTC is &quot;Fight
Chattanooga&quot;.

==Band==
The marching band is referred to as the &quot;Marching Mocs&quot; and performs at all home games.

<text>Jacinta Mary Ann Collins (born 4 September 1962) is a former Australian politician who served as a Senator for Victoria from 1995 to 2005 and again from 2008 to 2019. She represented the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and was the party&#x27;s deputy leader in the Senate from June to October 2013. Collins was a parliamentary secretary in the Gillard government and Minister for Mental Health and Ageing in the second Rudd government. She retired from politics prior to the 2019 federal election and accepted an appointment as national executive director of the National Catholic Education Commission on 18 February 2019.

==Early life==
Collins was born on 4 September 1962 in Altona, Victoria. She grew up in the suburb of Ashwood in Melbourne. She holds the degrees of Bachelor of Arts from Monash University and Bachelor of Social Work from La Trobe University.

Collins worked for the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees&#x27; Association (SDA) from 1980 until her appointment to the Senate in 1995, initially as a social welfare and research officer and then as national industrial officer for five years. She was a delegate to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) national congress from 1983 and was elected to the ACTU council in 1993.

==Political career==

Collins first entered parliament as a Senator for Victoria in 1995. She was appointed to the Senate to fill a casual vacancy caused by the death of Olive Zakharov. At the time, Collins was the only Victorian female Labor representative.

From October 1998 to November 2001, Collins was Parliamentary Secretary to the Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations and Employment, Training and Population. In 2003, she was named Shadow Minister for Children and Youth.

At the 2004 election, she lost her Senate seat to Steve Fielding of the Family First Party. In 2006 she was preselected for the number one spot on the Labor ticket in Victoria for the 2007 federal election, replacing Senator Robert Ray, who did not contest the election.

Collins was elected, and her term was due to start on 1 July 2008 when Ray&#x27;s term expired. However, he resigned on 5 May 2008 and she was appointed to the casual vacancy. She was sworn into the Senate later that month.

Collins was promoted to the Second Gillard Ministry as the Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations on 14 September 2010. In March 2012, she became the first woman to be appointed Manager of Government Business in the Senate following the retirement of Senator Mark Arbib.

On 26 June 2013, following the return of Rudd as leader, Collins was elected Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate by her parliamentary colleagues. She replaced Senator Penny Wong, who was elevated to Senate leader. This was the first all-female Senate Government leadership team.

Collins was active on many Senate committees, including: 
* Chair of the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee
* Chair of the Economics References Committee
* Chair of the Privileges Committee

===Views===
Collins was known for her social conservatism, including opposition to assisted reproductive technology for lesbians and single women, opposition to the use of human embryos in medical research, and opposition to same-sex marriage.

==Post-politics==

In January 2019, Collins announced that she would not contest the next election, citing &quot;family health issues&quot; for her decision to quit politics. She resigned from the Senate on 15 February 2019, and was announced as the new head of the National Catholic Education Commission on the same day. She commenced her role on 18 February 2019.

In 2023, Jacinta was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Notre Dame Australia for her contribution to public life and education.

==Personal life==
Collins has two children with her husband Daryl, a train driver. She was one of the first female MPs allowed to carry an infant on the floor of parliament.

Collins&#x27; first child was born from an unplanned pregnancy when she was 19 years old. The child was placed for adoption.

<doc id="995553" wikidata="Q7343038" url="?curid=995553" title="Robert Collier, 1st Baron Monkswell">
<text>Robert Porrett Collier, 1st Baron Monkswell, (21 June 1817 – 27 October 1886) was an English lawyer, politician and judge.

==Background and education==
He was the eldest son of John Collier, a merchant of Plymouth, formerly a member of the Society of Friends and MP for that town from 1832 to 1842.

Robert Collier was born in 1817, and was educated at the grammar school and other schools at Plymouth till the age of sixteen, when he was placed under the tuition of Mr Kemp, subsequently rector of St James&#x27;s, Piccadilly, London.

He went to Trinity College, Cambridge, and while there wrote some clever parodies, and published a satirical poem called &#x27;Granta&#x27;. Ill-health compelled him to abandon reading for honours and to quit the university, to which he only returned to take the ordinary B.A. degree in 1843. Already a politician, he made some speeches at Launceston in 1841 with a view to contesting the borough in the Liberal interest, but did not go to the poll, and he was an active member of the Anti-Corn Law League and addressed the meetings in Covent Garden Theatre.

==Career at the bar==
He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in Hilary term 1843, and joined the Western Circuit and Devonshire, Plymouth, and Devonport sessions. His first important success was a brilliant defence of some Brazilian pirates at Exeter in July 1845; the prisoners were, however, condemned to death, and the judge (Baron Platt) refused to reserve a point of law on which Collier insisted. Collier hurried to London and laid the matter before the Home Secretary (Sir James Graham) and Sir Robert Peel. Both ministers appear to have been convinced by Collier&#x27;s argument, and on 5 August, it was announced in both Houses of Parliament that Baron Platt had yielded. The subsequent argument before all the judges in London of the point taken at the trial resulted in the grant of a free pardon to Collier&#x27;s clients.

On his next visit to Exeter he had nineteen briefs. Local influence and wide practical knowledge gave him a good practice, and he was an excellent junior.

==Political career==
He was appointed recorder of Penzance, and in 1852 he was returned to Parliament for Plymouth, in the Liberal interest, and retained the seat till he became a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
Lord Cranworth made him a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1854. After a keen rivalry with Montague Edward Smith, afterwards a judge, for the foremost place, he obtained the lead of the circuit and kept it for many years
In 1859, he was appointed counsel to the Admiralty and Judge-Advocate of the Fleet. It was his opinion in favour of detaining the Confederate rams in the Mersey that Mr Adams, the American minister, submitted in 1862 to Lord John Russell, and, although too late to prevent the &quot;CSS Alabama&quot; going to sea, it was afterwards adopted by the law officers of the Crown.

He had spoken frequently and with good effect in Parliament, especially on trade with Russia in 1855, but chiefly on legal topics; and when, on Sir William Atherton&#x27;s retirement in October 1863, Sir Roundell Palmer became Attorney-General, Collier&#x27;s appointment as Solicitor-General, (receiving the customary knighthood) in succession to him was somewhat unexpected. He filled the office, however, with success until the Liberal government resigned in 1866, and in December 1868 he became Attorney-General, and in the next year he had the conduct of the Bankruptcy Bill in the House of Commons. He was, while Attorney-General, appointed Recorder of Bristol, but resigned the appointment at once in deference to the wishes of his constituency.

==Appointment to the Judicial Committee==
In 1871, to enable the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, to overtake its arrears of colonial appeals, an act was passed providing for four paid judgeships, two of which were to be held by judges or ex-judges of the English bench. To none could one of the law officers be appointed. One of these two judgeships was accepted by Montague Smith. The other was offered to and refused by three English judges, and a fourth having intimated that he would refuse it if offered, Lord Hatherley, the Lord Chancellor, thought it unseemly to hawk the appointment about any further.

It was imperative that the vacancy should be at once filled, and Collier agreed to relieve the government in this difficulty. To give him the necessary technical qualification, he was first appointed to the Privy Council, on 3 November 1871. Lord Hatherley then arranged for his appointment to a vacant puisne judgeship in the Common Pleas, on 7 November 1871. Here he sat a few days only; three judgments of his are, however, reported. Though a writ was made out appointing him a serjeant, it was never executed in open court, nor was he a member of Serjeants&#x27; Inn. Then, on November 23, 1871, Gladstone appointed him to the vacancy on the Privy Council.

No doubt was cast either on his fitness for the place or on his personal conduct in accepting it; but a controversy, very damaging to the government, arose out of the appointment. Lord Chief Justice Cockburn and Chief Justice Bovill protested against it as contrary to the spirit of the act, and on 15 February 1872, Lord Stanhope made a motion in the House of Lords condemning it, which was lost only by two votes. A similar motion in the House of Commons was lost by only twenty-seven.

Collier held this post until his death, and the task of giving literary shape to the judgments of the Privy Council was frequently committed to him. In 1885, he was created a peer, as Baron Monkswell, of Monkswell in the County of Devon, taking his title from Monkswell, a small property in Devonshire.

==Works==
He published a treatise on the Railways Clauses Acts, 1845; another on Mines in 1849; a letter to Lord John Russell on the &#x27;Reform of the Common Law Courts,&#x27; 1851, 2nd ed. 1852; and a translation of &#x27;Demosthenes de Coronâ&#x27; in 1875.

It was chiefly in painting, of which he was passionately fond, that he was distinguished.
As a young man he drew very clever caricatures in the H.B. manner.
When solicitor-general he painted in St. James&#x27;s Park, and he exhibited frequently at the Royal Academy and Grosvenor Gallery, especially pictures of the neighbourhood of Rosenlaui, Switzerland, where he spent many vacations.

==Family==

Collier married in 1844 Isabella Rose (1815–1886), daughter of William Rose of Woolston Heath. near Rugby. Both Collier and his son John were keen painters. In c1880, Collier had a new home built at 7 Chelsea Embankment, including artists&#x27; studios. 

After her sudden death in April 1886, in failing health, he went to the Riviera, and died at Grasse on 27 October 1886. He was buried in London on 3 November. His grave lies on the east side of the main path from the north entrance to the central colonnades in Brompton Cemetery in London.

He was succeeded by his son Robert, a barrister, who graduated in the first class of the Cambridge law tripos, 1866, and held the post of conveyancing counsel to the treasury; his son John, was a well-known artist; and his daughter Margaret, Mme. Galettidi Cadilhac, wrote both &quot;Our Home by the Adriatic&quot; and &quot;Prince Peerless&quot;, a fairy tale.

==Arms==
==Judicial decisions==
In 1873, Collier gave the decision for the Judicial Committee in &quot;R v Coote&quot;, the first Canadian constitutional law case decided by the Judicial Committee under the British North America Act, 1867. Collier upheld the power of the province of provinces to give fire commissioners the power to compel witnesses to testify in inquiries into fires.

<doc id="995557" wikidata="Q842324" url="?curid=995557" title="Indie pop">
<text>Indie pop (also typeset as indie-pop or indiepop) is a music genre and subculture that combines guitar pop with a DIY ethic in opposition to the style and tone of mainstream pop music. It originated from British post-punk in the late 1970s and subsequently generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Compared to its counterpart, indie rock, the genre is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. In later years, the definition of &quot;indie pop&quot; has bifurcated to also mean bands from unrelated DIY scenes/movements with pop leanings. Subgenres include chamber pop and twee pop.

==Development and characteristics==
===Origins and etymology===

Both &quot;indie&quot; and &quot;indie pop&quot; had originally referred to the same thing during the late 1970s, originally abbreviations for &quot;independent&quot; and &quot;popular&quot;. Inspired more by punk rock&#x27;s DIY ethos than its style, guitar bands were formed on the then-novel premise that one could record and release their own music instead of having to procure a record contract from a major label. According to Emily Dolan, indie is predicated on the distorted music of the Velvet Underground, the &quot;rebellious screaming&quot; of early punk, and &quot;some of rock&#x27;s more quirky and eccentric figures&quot;, such as Jonathan Richman. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Nitsuh Abebe identifies the majority of indie as &quot;all about that 60s-styled guitar jangle&quot;. The Monochrome Set&#x27;s early singles were so heavily influential to indie pop band the Smiths that Johnny Marr stated without them, the Smiths would not have existed.

Indie pop was an unprecedented contrast from the gritty and serious tones of previous underground rock styles, as well as being a departure from the glamour of contemporary pop music. Distinguished from the angst and abrasiveness of its indie rock counterpart, the majority of indie pop borrows not only the stripped-down quality of punk, but also &quot;the sweetness and catchiness of mainstream pop&quot;. Music critic Simon Reynolds says that indie pop defines itself against &quot;charting pop&quot;. Abebe explains:

Despite their relatively minor commercial success (their third album was sardonically titled &quot;They Could Have Been Bigger than the Beatles&quot;), the Television Personalities are highly regarded by critics and have been widely influential, especially on the C86 generation. Reynolds has said that &quot;what we now know as indie music was invented in Scotland,&quot; with reference to the emergence of Postcard Records in 1979. However, some have posited that the concept of indie music did not crystallise until the late 1980s and early 1990s. Brisbane band the Go-Betweens were an early influential indie pop band, releasing their first single &quot;Lee Remick&quot; in 1978. American indie pop band Beat Happening&#x27;s 1985 eponymous debut album was also influential in the development of the indie pop sound, particularly in North America. In the early 1990s, English indie pop influenced and branched off to a variety of styles. The US, which did not have as much of a scene in the 1980s, had many indie pop enthusiasts by the mid 1990s. Most of the modern notion of indie music stems from &quot;NME&quot;″s 1986 compilation &quot;C86&quot;, which collects many guitar bands who were inspired by the early psychedelic sounds of 1960s garage rock.

Names that indie pop fans use for themselves are &quot;popkids&quot; and &quot;popgeeks&quot;, and for the music they listen to, &quot;p!o!p&quot;, &quot;twee&quot;, &quot;anorak&quot; and &quot;C86&quot;. Abebe says that the Scottish group the Pastels typified the &quot;hip end of &#x27;anorak&#x27;: Their lazy melodies, lackadaisical strum, and naive attitude transformed the idea of the rock band into something casual, intimate, and free from the pretense of cool&quot;.

===Record labels===
Following on from the aforementioned Postcard Records, in the UK, Bristol-based Sarah Records became the archetypal indie pop record label. They began releasing 7&quot; singles in 1987 by bands with overt feminist and left wing principles that made &quot;sweet pop&quot;.

In the US, Beat Happening&#x27;s Calvin Johnson founded K Records in Olympia, Washington, and later labels like Slumberland and Harriet encouraged the genre&#x27;s spread across the country.

===Disputed significance of &quot;C86&quot;===
Everett True, a writer for &quot;NME&quot; in the 1980s, believes that &quot;C86&quot; was not the main factor behind indie pop, arguing that Sarah Records was more responsible for sticking to a particular sound, and that: &quot;C86 didn&#x27;t actually exist as a sound, or style. ... I find it weird, bordering on surreal, that people are starting to use it as a description again&quot;.

Bob Stanley, a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; journalist in the late 1980s and founding member of pop band Saint Etienne, acknowledges that participants at the time reacted against lazy labelling, but insists they shared an approach: &quot;Of course the &#x27;scene&#x27;, like any scene, barely existed. Like squabbling Marxist factions, groups who had much in common built up petty rivalries. The June Brides and the Jasmine Minks were the biggest names at Alan McGee&#x27;s Living Room Club and couldn&#x27;t stand the sight of each other. Only when the Jesus and Mary Chain exploded and stole their two-headed crown did they realise they were basically soulmates&quot;. Manic Street Preachers bassist Nicky Wire remembers that it was the bands&#x27; very independence that gave the scene coherence: &quot;People were doing everything themselves - making their own records, doing the artwork, gluing the sleeves together, releasing them and sending them out, writing fanzines because the music press lost interest really quickly.&quot;

Many of the actual &quot;C86&quot; bands distanced themselves from the scene cultivated around them by the UK music press - in its time, &quot;C86&quot; became a pejorative term for its associations with so-called &quot;shambling&quot; (a John Peel-coined description celebrating the self-conscious primitive approach of some of the music) and underachievement.

==Related genres==
===Twee pop===
Twee pop is a subgenre of indie pop that originates from &quot;C86&quot;. Characterised by its simplicity and perceived innocence, some of its defining features are boy-girl harmonies, catchy melodies, and lyrics about love. For many years, most bands were distributed by Sarah Records (in the UK) and K Records (in the US).

 is a Japanese style from the 1990s that was embraced by indie pop enthusiasts, partly because many of its bands were distributed in the United States through major indie labels like Matador and Grand Royal. Out of all the Japanese groups from the scene, Pizzicato Five was the closest to achieving mainstream success in the US.

===Chamber pop===

Chamber pop is a subgenre of indie pop that features lush orchestrations. Heavily influenced by Brian Wilson and Burt Bacharach, the majority of Louis Phillipe&#x27;s productions for él Records embodied the sophisticated use of orchestras and voices that typified the style, whilst the Divine Comedy were the most popular chamber pop act of the Britpop era.

<text>Azua () is a province which is collectively one of the thirty-two provinces of the Dominican Republic. It is divided into 10 municipalities (the same as Santiago) and its capital city is Azua de Compostela. It is bordered by the provinces of La Vega to the north-east, San José de Ocoa and Peravia to the east, Barahona and Baoruco to the west and San Juan to the north-west. To the south, Azua has a significant coastline of the Caribbean Sea. Azua is known for its diverse geography and climate, with the southern part of the province having an arid climate that is not the typical tropical-like that is found in other parts of the Caribbean.

==Geography==
The southern part of the province is located in the Llanura or Llano de Azua (also known as the &quot;Plena de Azua&quot;), a coastal plain surrounded by mountains that act as barriers to the water-laden winds so that the lower parts of the province are very arid.

Azua had the Sierra de Ocoa, which is the southern end of the Cordillera Central, the tallest mountain range in the caribbean. In the northern half of the province is also the Cordillera Central. In the southwest, on the border with the Barahona and Baoruco provinces, are the Martín García and Neiba mountain ranges.

==Municipalities and municipal districts==
The province as of 20 June 2006 is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot; – D.M.) within them:
*Azua (Azua de Compostela)
**Barreras (D.M.)
**Barro Arriba (D.M.)
**Clavellina (D.M.)
**Emma Balaguer Viuda Vallejo (D.M.)
**Las Barias-La Estancia (D.M.)
**Las Lomas (D.M.)

Conroy was born in Ely, Cambridgeshire in the United Kingdom. His parents both worked at an air force base, where his mother Jean worked as a radar technician and his father Bill as a sergeant. In December 1973 the Conroys moved to Canberra, Australia, where he attended Daramalan College. He obtained a Bachelor of Economics at the Australian National University in Canberra. His involvement in student politics was minimal, although he helped organise a rally against student fees.

==Politics==

After university, Conroy worked as an advisor to Ros Kelly and Barry Jones. He moved to Melbourne to pursue a political career where he met Robert Ray, and served for a time as Superannuation Officer with the Transport Workers Union and as a City of Footscray councillor. He was appointed to the Senate in 1996 when Gareth Evans resigned to contest a seat in the Lower House. In October 1998, Conroy joined the Opposition Shadow Ministry and in 2001 became Deputy Opposition Leader in the Senate. He was Shadow Minister for Trade, Corporate Governance and Financial Services from 2003 to 2004, and became Shadow Minister for Communications and Information Technology in October 2004.

Conroy is a leading member of the Labor Right and was criticised in early 2006 by members of the Labor Left and Simon Crean for working for the replacement of several long-serving MPs with new members, including Bill Shorten, Richard Marles, Mark Dreyfus, Nathan Murphy and Matt Carrick. After Simon Crean&#x27;s win in the Hotham pre-selection, where Conroy supported Martin Pakula for the position, Crean attacked Conroy repeatedly, calling on him to resign his position as Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.

In April 2009, Conroy faced criticism after he made comments disparaging the ISP iiNet&#x27;s defence in a Federal Court case against a number of film studios and Channel Seven. Opposition spokesmen described the comments as prejudicial. After iiNet won, Conroy said it was disappointing the two sides had ended up in court. In February 2010, he admitted using his influence to have a former Labor politician Mike Kaiser, take the position of Government Relations and External Affairs Executive with the National Broadband Network. Kaiser was previously forced to retire from the Labor party due to electoral fraud. Also in February 2010, he was reported to have spent some time while on holiday with Kerry Stokes weeks before cutting licence fees that are charged to free-to-air networks, including Stokes&#x27; broadcasting Seven Network.

In June 2010, Conroy was criticised by SAGE-AU for &quot;misinformation that verged on fear-mongering&quot; when he suggested Google street view cars could have captured internet banking details in their recording of wireless network traffic, as these are generally exchanged over secure HTTPS connections. In March 2013, he introduced six media reform bills, one of which would have been the establishment of a Public Interest Media Advocate, a government organisation set up to regulate the previously self-regulated media in Australia. After announcing there would be no discussion over the bills, and that they would be passed or failed as a package, he backed down, allowing negotiation with parties who held the balance of power in the senate. The content of the bills were largely condemned by media. Ultimately, only two of the six bills passed, and at that the least controversial ones. Should he have introduced the 7 bills, the controversy may have been surpassed.

===Portfolio===
Conroy was Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy in the First Rudd, First Gillard and Second Gillard Ministries. The NBN roll out was dogged with delay and cost blowouts in his time as minister. In that role, he was responsible for internet censorship, the National Broadband Network, and the proposed switch to digital television as a complete replacement for analogue. In May 2010 he was appointed as a founding member to a new United Nations commission, the Broadband Commission for Digital Development.

==== Internet censorship ====
Conroy faced severe criticism over his Internet censorship policies from various groups. While initially promoted as a way to block child pornography, the censorship policy has been extended to include legal material traditionally refused classification by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (now known as the Australian Classification Board), including sites depicting drug use, crime, sex, cruelty, violence or &quot;revolting and abhorrent phenomena&quot; that &quot;offend against the standards of morality&quot;. On 19 March 2009 it was reported that ACMA&#x27;s blacklist of banned sites had been leaked online, and had been published by WikiLeaks. About half of the list was child-porn related; the remainder included sites dealing with legal porn, online gambling, euthanasia, Christianity and fringe religions; sites belonging to a tour operator, dentist and animal carers were also listed. Conroy described the leak and publication of the blacklist as &quot;grossly irresponsible&quot; and that it undermined efforts to improve &quot;cyber safety&quot;. In June 2009 he was named &quot;Internet villain of the year&quot; at the 11th annual Internet industry awards in the UK, for &quot;individuals or organisations that have upset the Internet industry and hampered its development – those whom the industry loves to hate.&quot;

In December 2009 &quot;Internet pranksters&quot; registered the domain name stephenconroy.com.au which was swiftly removed by auDA raising concerns about auDA&#x27;s political neutrality and the further potential for suppression of political speech after the proposed mandatory Internet filter is legislated.

In May 2010, Conroy was accused of deliberately misrepresenting iiNet&#x27;s position with regards to the new internet filter. His department could also not say where he obtained other figures from, such as how he believes that 85% of ISPs support the new filter.

In September 2012 Conroy stated:

==Resignation from Parliament==
Stephen Conroy foreshadowed his resignation from parliament in a tabled speech on 15 September 2016; he resigned on 30 September 2016.

On 25 October, a joint sitting of the Victorian Parliament appointed Kimberley Kitching as his replacement.

==Career after politics==
In December 2016 it was announced that Conroy would be head of a new industry body for the gambling industry, Responsible Wagering Australia, backed by bookmakers CrownBet, Sportsbet, Betfair, Unibet and Bet365. In 2017, he joined Sky News Australia as a political commentator.

In 2023 Conroy became the Independent Chairman of the Australian Professional Leagues, the organisation responsible for administration of the A-Leagues professional soccer competitions.

==Political positions==
Conroy is a Roman Catholic and socially conservative. While he voted against the abortion drug RU486 in a conscience vote, he has claimed not to have taken a conservative position on all issues:

&quot;I think the point I made was that while I would prefer there to be a parliamentary framework for the RU486, I think it was, debate, if the actual issue was before Parliament I would probably vote for the distribution of the pill. People often say, oh no Steve&#x27;s a conservative Catholic, but they won&#x27;t ever find on my voting record something that backs that up. I voted against the Northern Territory&#x27;s euthanasia legislation. I voted for some of the cloning debate. So I voted in, I like to consider the issues on their merits and I voted what some would characterise as conservatively and some would characterise as progressively on a number of issues.&quot;

When a bill seeking to legalise same-sex marriage was debated by the Senate in 2012, Conroy was one of 11 Labor Senators to vote against the legislation. By the time of Conroy&#x27;s resignation, Labor Party policy supported same-sex marriage and bound its MPs to vote in favour of legislation from the end of the 2016–19 parliamentary term.

==Personal life==
Conroy and his wife, Paula Benson, have one daughter.

He was a national volleyball representative as a teenager and was the President of Volleyball Victoria from 2004 to 2019.

<doc id="995576" wikidata="Q5002896" url="?curid=995576" title="Butterfingers (Australian band)">
<text>Butterfingers are an Australian rap rock group from Brisbane, Queensland. Most of their releases are on their own label, Valley Trash Records. They are currently signed to New World Artists.

==History==
The group was formed when lead vocalist &#x27;Evil&#x27; Eddie Mark Jacobson booked himself in for a gig at The Zoo, a bar in Brisbane, without a band or any intentions of performing solo. The venue held Jacobson&#x27;s booking to him, and a backing band was assembled featuring DJ/percussionist Olly Thomas, bassist Dave Crane, and drummer Damien Green.

Their first two singles &quot;Everytime&quot; and &quot;I Love Work&quot;, reached No. 38 and No. 15 respectively in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2003.

Their next single &quot;Yo Mama&quot; also receiving airplay on Triple J with the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Breakfast at Fatboys&quot;, on its national release, 3 May 2004, awarded Triple J &#x27;Album of the Week&#x27;. The album debuted at No. 15 on the ARIA Album charts and was also nominated for the &#x27;Best Independent Release&#x27; at the 2004 ARIA Music Awards &quot;Yo Mama&quot; charted at No. 17 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2004. In October 2004 Butterfingers scored a Guest Programming spot on rage.

In March 2005 Butterfingers aligned themselves with Festival Mushroom Records through a licensing deal between FMR and Valley Trash, the bands in-house label. Their first (and last) co-release was in June 2005 with the release of the single, &quot;Figjam (Fuck I&#x27;m Good, Just Ask Me)&quot;. The song peaked at No. 50 and in October 2005, &quot;Figjam&quot; was nominated for &#x27;Best Urban Release&#x27; at the 2005 ARIA Music Awards. &quot;Figjam&quot; and the preceding single, &quot;Jesus I Was Evil&quot; (a Darcy Clay cover) charted at No. 11 and No. 69 respectively in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2005.

The band released a new album, &quot;The Deeper You Dig...&quot; on 27 May 2006, which peaked at No. 14 on the album chart. A single from the album, &quot;Get Up Outta the Dirt&quot;, was released on 3 June 2006. The single peaked at No. 36, and charted at No. 83 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2006.

In June 2007 the band won an APRA award - &#x27;Most Performed Urban Work&#x27; for &quot;Get Up Outta the Dirt&quot;. The group then released &quot;Nothin Much Happens&quot; as a single in October 2007, which landed on Triple J&#x27;s &quot;hit list&quot; of songs receiving medium to high rotation. A music video was produced for this song and was played on &quot;jtv&quot;, and on &quot;rage&quot;, and also &quot;Video Hits&quot;.

With the band on a presumed hiatus, lead vocalist Eddie Jacobson began performing with Brisbane-based punk band, SpitFireLiar. Jacobson also went on to a solo single under the name Evil Eddie, entitled &quot;Queensland&quot;.

Jacobson&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Welcome to Flavour Country&quot;, was released in November 2012.

Butterfingers announced their reformation, alongside releasing a new single &quot;Big Night Out,&quot; in March 2017.

They then went on tour to celebrate the 15-year anniversary of &quot;Breakfast at Fatboys&quot; in 2019, supported by Fresh Violet.

The band released a new album, &quot;Bad News&quot;, in April 2020.

<text>William O. Wooldridge (August 12, 1922 – March 5, 2012) was a United States Army soldier and the first Sergeant Major of the Army.

Wooldridge served on active duty from 1940 to 1972. His military career spanned two wars and 14 campaigns, during which he was twice decorated for gallantry in action. He was sworn in as the first Sergeant Major of the Army on July 11, 1966.

==Early life==
William Wooldridge was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and grew up in Texas. He enlisted in the United States Army at Fort Worth, Texas on November 11, 1940.

==Military career==
Wooldridge served first with Company F, 23rd Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division. In December 1941 he was assigned to detached service with the British forces in Iceland. The following year, he was released from detached service and assigned to Company K, 26th Regiment, 1st Infantry Division when it arrived in England. He served with his division throughout World War II in an infantry rifle company, being promoted through the ranks to first sergeant. Wooldridge landed on D-Day as a squad leader (sergeant).

Wooldridge was awarded the Silver Star for gallantry at the Battle of Aachen in Germany in October 1944. He also received a Purple Heart for injuries in this battle. He was awarded a second Silver Star for gallantry during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, while serving as a platoon sergeant.

Wooldridge returned to Fort Sam Houston, Texas in May 1945. In October he was assigned to the Pacific Theater. After attending the 1st 3 Graders Course, Oahu Officer Troop and Staff School, at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, he was assigned to Headquarters, Eighth United States Army, South Korea as a member of the occupation forces. In July 1948 Wooldridge was assigned as a platoon sergeant in the 26th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, at Bamberg, Germany. He was promoted to first sergeant in Company K, 26th Infantry, 1st Infantry Division, in 1950.

In May 1954, Wooldridge returned to the United States as first sergeant of Company G, 3rd Infantry, at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. He rejoined the 1st Infantry Division as first sergeant of Company D, 26th Infantry at Fort Riley, Kansas in December 1955. On December 20, 1956, he was appointed sergeant major of the 3rd Battalion, 26th Regiment. He left Fort Riley as sergeant major of the 2nd Battle Group, 28th Infantry Regiment, for duty in West Germany in December 1958, and became the 24th Infantry Division&#x27;s sergeant major in March 1963.

Wooldridge returned to the 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley as sergeant major of the 1st Brigade in February 1965. In June 1965 he was selected by the division commander, Major General Jonathan O. Seaman, as the division sergeant major. The next month he deployed with the division&#x27;s advance party to South Vietnam. He served as division sergeant major until his selection as the first Sergeant Major of the Army in July 1966.

===Sergeant Major of the Army===
Wooldridge was chosen for the important new position of Sergeant Major of the Army from thousands of candidates. He served as Sergeant Major of the Army until September 1968. He is credited with improving the status of the non-commissioned officers by convening the first Major Command Sergeants Major Conference and recommending the Non-commissioned Officer Candidate Course, the Sergeants Major Academy, the Command Sergeant Major program, and a standardized non-commissioned officer promotion process. Wooldridge and General Harold K. Johnson, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, worked together as an effective professional team. He came to revere Johnson, calling him &quot;the finest officer I ever served with in my life&quot;.

After serving as Sergeant Major of the Army, Wooldridge returned to South Vietnam as sergeant major of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV). He is the only Sergeant Major of the Army to return to field duty after serving in the top enlisted position.

Wooldridge&#x27;s appointment was recorded in the Congressional Record of the 89th Congress Vol. 112, No. 110.

===Controversy and PX scandal===
In 1969, while command sergeant major of MACV, Wooldridge was accused in a congressional inquiry of fraud and corruption related to the military club system, amounting to more than $150 million annually. The inquiry found that then United States Army Provost Marshal General, Carl C. Turner had ignored Wooldridge&#x27;s earlier theft and AWOL offenses that were notified to him at the time of Wooldridge&#x27;s appointment as first Sergeant Major of the Army was announced in late 1966. Turner was later accused of having covered up an attempt by Wooldridge to smuggle 8-9 cases of liquor aboard General Creighton Abrams&#x27; KC-135 jet in April 1967. In late 1967 Turner ordered the United States Army Criminal Investigation Division that Wooldridge&#x27;s name be removed from the list of soldiers being investigated into irregularities at the Non-commissioned officer (NCO) club at Fort Benning. Turner was also accused of having suppressed the &quot;Augsburg File&quot; which detailed the corruption of Wooldridge and other NCOs of the 24th Infantry Division in Augsburg, West Germany in the early 1960s. The subcommittee concluded that Turner had given Wooldridge and his associates immunity from investigation and &quot;was grossly negligent in the performance of his official duties.&quot; 

Wooldridge together with American businessman William J. Crum arranged to have Sergeant William Higdon appointed as custodian of the NCO club system at Long Binh Post in November 1967. Higdon testified that between then and July 1968 Crum paid him a total of approximately US$60,000 of kickbacks from the slot machine operations. In August 1968 Wooldridge brokered a deal between Crum and Maredem Inc. (a company owned by Wooldridge, Higdon and Sergeant Hatcher, the custodian of the 1st Infantry Division NCO clubs) under which Maredem would have the monopoly on snack items in the NCO clubs while Crum would have the monopoly on slot machines. Maredem wanted to take control of all operations, but it recognized that Crum was too powerful and was capable of paying larger kickbacks than Maredem.

In 1973 the Department of Justice and Wooldridge reached an agreement whereby Wooldridge pleaded guilty to accepting stock equity from Maredem.

Wooldridge had earlier been awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal, but it was revoked following this episode. In June Collins and Robin Moore&#x27;s novel &quot;Khaki Mafia&quot;, a fictional character in a criminal cartel is based on Wooldridge in South Vietnam.

==Later life==
Wooldridge died in El Paso, Texas, on March 5, 2012, at the age of 89. He is buried at Fort Bliss National Cemetery in Section A, Lot 56.

<text>Livid was an Australian alternative rock music festival held annually from 1989 to 2003. Created by Peter Walsh and Natalie Jeremijenko, the original idea of showcasing both the arts (Natalie) and music (Peter) in the one event was standardised as late as October/early November from 1991 until 2003. While it has never been officially cancelled, no festivals have been held since 2003 and neither the organisers or promoters have announced any intention to restart Livid in the future.

Headline artists for the festival&#x27;s most recent dates included Linkin Park, the White Stripes and Yeah Yeah Yeahs in 2003, Powderfinger and Oasis in 2002, and Butthole Surfers, Billy Bragg and Ash in 2001.

The festival began in 1989 with a 1500-strong audience at the University of Queensland in Brisbane. Its growing popularity saw it move to Davies Park in the Brisbane suburb of West End and later the RNA Showgrounds. Until the establishment of the Homebake festival in 1995, Livid was the only major Australian rock festival apart from the Big Day Out. In 1990, the Livid festival became the first of the recent &quot;touring&quot; festivals when it was held at Harold Park Paceway in Sydney&#x27;s Glebe. This event was infamous for the non-appearance of Red Head King Pin, whom (it was said by the promoters) refused to come out of the toilet in his hotel to appear. An &quot;ad hoc&quot; band consisting of members of the Go-Betweens and other musicians reappeared to attempt to quell the crowd. In 2002, the festival attempted a national move and held events in Sydney and Melbourne. Despite the reasonable success of this move, Livid was now in direct competition with Sydney&#x27;s Homebake festival and the nationwide Big Day Out, and citing a &quot;scarcity of headline acts on this year&#x27;s international festival touring circuit&quot;, the event&#x27;s promoters announced that the show would not he held in 2004. Livid has not been held since, despite initial promises that it would return in 2005.

State Library of Queensland contains an archive of Livid Festival including posters, t-shirts, CDs and epherma

<doc id="995596" wikidata="Q5918659" url="?curid=995596" title="How to Live on 24 Hours a Day">
<text>How to Live on Twenty-four Hours a Day is a short self-help book &quot;about the daily organization of time&quot; by novelist Arnold Bennett. Written originally as a series of articles in the London &quot;Evening News&quot; in 1907, it was published in book form in 1908. Aimed initially at &quot;the legions of clerks and typists and other meanly paid workers caught up in the explosion of British office jobs around the turn of the [twentieth] century&quot;, it was one of several &quot;pocket philosophies&quot; by Bennett that &quot;offered a strong message of hope from somebody who so well understood their lives&quot;. The book was especially successful in the US, where Henry Ford bought 500 copies to give to his friends and employees. Bennett himself said that the book &quot;has brought me more letters of appreciation than all my other books put together&quot;.

In her book &quot;The Self-Help Compulsion: Searching for Advice in Modern Literature&quot;, Harvard academic Beth Blum argued that &quot;Bennett&#x27;s essays on the art of living mount a challenge against modernism&#x27;s disdain for the crude utilitarianism of public taste&quot; and saw Virginia Woolf&#x27;s hostility to Bennett as &quot;defined, in part, as an inspired rebuttal of Bennett&#x27;s practical philosophies&quot;. In a 2019 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Cal Newport recommended &quot;How to Live on Twenty-four Hours a Day&quot; as an inspiration for anyone embarking on a program of &quot;digital decluttering&quot;.

==Philosophy==
In the book, Bennett addressed the growing number of white-collar workers that had accumulated since the advent of the Industrial Revolution. In his view, these workers put in eight hours a day, forty hours a week, at jobs they did not enjoy, and at worst, hated. They worked to make a living, but their daily existence consisted of waking up, getting ready for work, working as little as possible during the workday, going home, unwinding, going to sleep, and repeating the process the next day. In short, he did not believe they were really living.

Bennett addressed this problem by urging his readers to seize their extra time and make the most of it to improve themselves. Extra time could be found at the beginning of the day, by waking up early, and on the ride to work, on the way home from work, in the evening hours, and especially during the weekends. During this time, he prescribed improvement measures such as reading great literature, taking an interest in the arts, reflecting on life, and learning self-discipline.

Bennett wrote that time is the most precious of commodities and that many books have been written on how to live on a certain amount of money each day. He added that the old adage &quot;time is money&quot; understates the matter, as time can often produce money, but money cannot produce more time. Time is extremely limited, and Bennett urged others to make the best of the time remaining in their lives.

==Advice==
In the book, Bennett offers the following advice:
* View the 24-hour day as two separate days, one encompassing the 8-hour workday and the other a 16-hour personal day to be accounted for and utilized.
* Train your mind daily to focus on a single thing continuously for an extended period, 50 minutes in his &quot;average case&quot; example.
* Reflect on yourself.
* Claim 90 minutes each evening for three evenings a week, to start with. More time can be found, but Bennett recommends starting small instead of attempting a large enterprise and failing.
* Those 90 minutes can be claimed in the evening, in the morning, on the train to and from work, or other time that is not put to good use. He recommends evenings for most people, but it depends on one&#x27;s schedule.
* Use that 90 minutes to improve yourself. Over the course of weeks and months, the knowledge gained in those chunks of time will add up to a significant amount.
* Literature is not the only means of self-improvement. Other reading can be very beneficial, including learning more about your business, learning about the &quot;causes and effects&quot; of things, and learning about history and philosophy.
* He does not recommend reading novels for self-improvement. He highly recommends poetry, especially verse novels, such as Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;.

==Warnings==
Bennett also warns against:
* Becoming a prig and insisting others follow the same improvement programme—he says that it is enough to worry about your own improvement.
* Becoming a slave to your programme. You should be flexible enough to allow other things in your life. At the same time, it must be rigid enough to actually be called a programme. Finding that balance between rigidity and flexibility is not easy, Bennett says.
* Being rushed and constantly worrying about what one has to do next, which he said is like living in a prison. He says, &quot;The evil springs not from persisting without elasticity in what one has attempted, but from originally attempting too much, from filling one&#x27;s programme till it runs over. The only cure is to reconstitute the programme, and to attempt less.&quot;
* Failing at the beginning of the enterprise, which &quot;may easily kill outright the newborn impulse towards a complete vitality, and therefore every precaution should be observed to avoid it. The impulse must not be over-taxed. Let the pace of the first lap be even absurdly slow, but let it be as regular as possible.&quot;

==Chapters==
The book includes the following chapters:
* The Daily Miracle
* The Desire to Exceed One&#x27;s Programme
* Precautions Before Beginning
* The Cause of the Trouble
* Tennis and the Immortal Soul
* Remember Human Nature
* Controlling the Mind
* The Reflective Mood
* Interest in the Arts
* Nothing in Life is Humdrum
* Serious Reading
* Dangers to Avoid

<text>Air Burkina [[S.A. (corporation)|SA]] is the national airline of Burkina Faso, operating scheduled services from its main base at Ouagadougou Airport to one domestic destination, Bobo-Dioulasso, as well as regional international services to Togo, Benin, Mali, Niger, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Senegal and Ghana. From 2001 to 2017, the airline was majority owned by an AKFED/IPS consortium, but is now back in government ownership, with reports that a new investor is being sought.

== History ==
The airline was established on 17 March 1967 under the name Air Volta, while the country was called the Republic of Upper Volta. The airline was renamed Air Burkina in 1984, following the country&#x27;s name change to Burkina Faso. It was originally part owned by the Burkinabé government, part by Air France and part privately held. It purchased its first aircraft, an Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante, in 1978, and added a second, a Fokker F28, in 1983.

Over the years, the airline has had serious debt problems, reaching a deficit of one billion CFA francs in 1992 (approx. €1,500,000). In part to address its debt problem, the Burkina Faso government privatised Air Burkina on 21 February 2001, transferring 56% of the shares to the AKFED/IPS consortium, part of the Aga Khan Development Network. At that time, the government retained 14% of shares. In 2001, following Air Burkina&#x27;s privatisation and the liquidation of Air Afrique, the airline&#x27;s debt had largely been alleviated and it was predicting an annual revenue of around 3.5 billion CFA francs (more than €5 million).

The company saw a general strike in 2002, when workers demanded a 25% wage increase. In the resulting conflict, the director-general of Air Burkina was forced to resign. 

In August 2013 press reports said that the majority shareholder, AKFED &amp; IPS, will be called in for talks by the government after its most recent Council of Ministers meeting resolved to discuss the airline&#x27;s financial state. According to the Burkinabé Ministry of Infrastructure &amp; Transport, a report presented to the government claimed the Burkinabé national carrier &quot;faces a difficult financial and economic situation.&quot; In May 2017 it was announced that the government had taken over the management of Air Burkina, following the signing of a contract of management cessation with AKFED, with the sale of shares to be made at a symbolic franc. There were also reports that a new investor was being sought.

In October 2020, a transfer agreement was signed between the State of Burkina Faso and the American company African Global Development (AGD) as part of a new privatization effort for Air Burkina.

==Corporate affairs==
===Shareholders===

<doc id="995602" wikidata="Q3277803" url="?curid=995602" title="Mahmoud Guinia">
<text>Mahmoud Guinia (, and rarely or ; also spelled Gania, Guinea or Khania; 1951 – 2 August 2015) was a Moroccan Gnawa musician, singer and guembri player, who was traditionally regarded as a Maâllem (), i.e. master. The family name is Gania, which also was the spelling in the passport of the artist.

He recorded for both domestic and foreign labels, and collaborated with numerous western musicians.

==Life==
Mahmoud Gania (or Guinia) was born in 1951 in the city Essaouira on the Atlantic coast. He was the second son of the master of Gnawa music, Maâllem Boubker Gania (1927–2000) and the famous clairvoyant and &quot;moqaddema&quot; A&#x27;isha Qabral. His brother Mokhtar Gania - as well as his late brothers Abdellah Gania and Bilal &quot;Lahcen Zitoune&quot;- is a gnawa Maâllem too, and their sister Zaida Gania - and the late Jmeia Gania - is another moqqaddema. Mahmoud Guinia was married to Mallika Al Machhour from Marrakech, with whom he had two sons and a daughter.

His family of both the father&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s sides came from present day Mali, as well as Mauritania. They were employed as soldiers in the sultan&#x27;s army and did not descend from slaves like so many others. They are regarded as the main representatives for the style of Essaouira, the Saouiri style.

Maâlem Mahmoud Gania (or Guinia) died after a lengthy illness on 2 August 2015.

His sons continue the tradition of the Saouiri style, notably Maâllem Houssam Guinia the youngest son, who is a rising star. His oldest son, Hamza Gania is a dancer and krakeb &amp; tebel (ganga) player and works as a civil servant in Essaouira, while his daughter, Bouchra Gania is a student.

==Works==
Mahmoud Guinia released numerous recordings, which not all have been well documented. In the 1970s Moroccan music label Fikriphone released records of both live Lila ceremonies and studio sessions. In the following decades it was followed by Tichkaphone, whose materials were distributed in France by Sonodisc, and Agadir&#x27;s La Voix El Maarif. There are also many cassettes released in Morocco.

The most famous western release, &quot;The Trance Of Seven Colors&quot;, was co-produced by Bill Laswell and Eric Rosenzveig in 1994 and featured the American saxophone player Pharoah Sanders along with family members of Mahmoud&#x27;s ensemble including his brothers Mohktar and Abdellah. The ensemble included Abdellah &quot;Gambori&quot; Ahkaraz, now a maâlem and hadj from Essaouira as well. The Black Mluks was recorded and produced by Eric Rosenzveig in Montreal in 1992 at Radio Canada and released on P-Vine Records in Japan. Upon returning to Morocco with the master tapes, Mahmoud Gania sold the Moroccan rights to the cassette label Le Voix El Maarif (LVEM) who released it as El Maaleem Mahmoud Gania - Soiree Au Canada (&quot;Maleem&quot; was a misspelling of the word Maâlem meaning Master in Arabic on behalf of Bill Laswell and the Axiom label, which stuck with many in the West for years, believing that it was an actual first name). The recordings were part of the first trip Maâlem Mahmoud Guinia and his ensemble made out of Morocco, to perform at the Festival Musiques et Traditions du Monde, the 350th Anniversary of the City of Montreal.The group at this time consisted almost entirely of his brothers, nephews and other family members. It was a legendary group. 

Later and for the rest of his life his two sons would play with their father from they were very small, culminating at the final concert at the annual gnawa festival in his native Essaouira in May 2015, when a very ill Maâllem Mahmoud Gania after an impressive concert handed his guimbri over to his young son, Maâlem Houssam Gania, who - together with younger brother Maâlem Mokhtar Gania - is considered his musical and spiritual heir.

Another notable release, &quot;The Wels Concert&quot;, with Peter Brötzmann and Hamid Drake, was recorded at Wels&#x27;s 1996 Music Unlimited festival. The Shaman of the Sahara music recordings were released in 2001 with Maâllem Mahmoud Guinia in collaboration with Tata Guinness, Victor Vidal Paz and various Indonesian musicians.

In September 2017 his final studio recordings (recorded in 2013 at Plein Les Oreilles studios in Casablanca with producer Ali Faraoui) were released on double vinyl by UK record label, Hive Mind Records. The remastered album is titled &quot;Colours of the Night&quot;. In 2020, Hive Mind issued a second Gania album titled &quot;Aicha&quot;.

<doc id="995618" wikidata="Q1700130" url="?curid=995618" title="John Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale">
<text>John Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale (18 August 1748 – 16 January 1830), known as Sir John Mitford between 1793 and 1802, was an English lawyer and politician. He was Speaker of the House of Commons between 1801 and 1802 and Lord Chancellor of Ireland between 1802 and 1806.

==Background==
Born in London, Mitford was the younger son of John Mitford (died 1761) of Exbury, Hampshire,
 and Philadelphia, daughter of Willey Reveley of Newton Underwood, Northumberland. The historian William Mitford was his elder brother. He was educated at Cheam School and studied law at the Inner Temple from 1772, being called to the bar in 1777.

==Career==
Having become a barrister of the Inner Temple in 1777, Mitford wrote &quot;A Treatise on the Pleadings in Suits in the Court of Chancery by English Bill&quot;, a work reprinted several times in England, Ireland, and America. He was made a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1789.

In 1788, he became Member of Parliament for the borough of Bere Alston in Devon, and in 1791 he successfully introduced a bill for the relief of Roman Catholics, despite being himself a committed Anglican. In 1793 he succeeded Sir John Scott as Solicitor-General for England (receiving the customary knighthood at the same time), becoming Attorney General six years later, when he was returned to parliament as member for East Looe in Cornwall.

In 1794, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

In February 1801, Mitford was chosen Speaker of the House of Commons and sworn of the Privy Council. Exactly a year later, he was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland and raised to the peerage as Baron Redesdale, of Redesdale in the County of Northumberland. Being an outspoken opponent of Catholic Emancipation, Redesdale was unpopular in Ireland. He had little support from his own colleagues: he was the subject of scurrilous attacks by &quot;Juverna&quot;, who was later discovered to be a senior judge, Robert Johnson, who was convicted of seditious libel and forced to resign from the Bench as a result. In February 1806, Redesdale was dismissed on the formation of the Ministry of All the Talents.

Although Lord Redesdale declined to return to official life, he was an active member of the House of Lords on its political and its judicial sides. In 1813, he secured the passing of acts for the relief of insolvent debtors, and became an opponent of the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts and other popular measures of reform.

==Family==
Lord Redesdale married Lady Frances Perceval, daughter of the 2nd Earl of Egmont, an Anglo-Irish peer, and sister of Prime Minister Spencer Perceval, in 1803. He took the additional name of Freeman in 1809 by royal licence on succeeding to the estates of his relative Thomas Edwards-Freeman (the heir of a previous Lord Chancellor of Ireland,
Richard Freeman). Lady Redesdale died in August 1817. Lord Redesdale survived her by thirteen years and died at Batsford Park, near Moreton-in-the-Marsh, Gloucestershire, in January 1830, aged 81. He was succeeded in the barony by his only son, John, who was created Earl of Redesdale in 1877.

<doc id="995629" wikidata="Q76719" url="?curid=995629" title="Timo Glock">
<text>Timo Glock (; born 18 March 1982) is a German racing driver, who competed in Formula One between and . 

Glock raced in Formula One for Jordan, Toyota, Virgin and Marussia, finishing 10th in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in both and , amongst three podium finishes.

After leaving Formula One at the end of the season, Glock became a factory driver for BMW in the 2013 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, achieving his first DTM podium at the Red Bull Ring, and a first win at the season finale at the Hockenheimring.

==Early career==
Born in Lindenfels, West Germany, Glock began his motorsport career in 1998 at the age of 15. He won several karting championships as well as the BMW ADAC Formula Junior Cup in 2000 and the Formula BMW ADAC Championship in 2001. In his first German Formula Three Championship season in 2002, he finished third in the standings en route to rookie of the year honours. In 2003, he competed in the Formula Three Euroseries, winning three races and scoring three other podium finishes, which were enough to place him in fifth position in the Championship.

==Formula One==
===Jordan (2004)===
Glock was signed as Jordan Grand Prix&#x27;s test driver for the 2004 Formula One season and made his Formula One debut at the Canadian Grand Prix replacing Giorgio Pantano, who had a contract dispute with Jordan. He finished 11th, but inherited 7th following the disqualification of the Williams and Toyota cars and thus scored two points on his debut.

He finished the season with Jordan, taking over from Pantano for the last three races. Glock&#x27;s sponsorship with Deutsche Post helped bring back the colours of DHL to Jordan.

==Champ Car==

===2005===
In 2005, Glock shifted his career to the United States, racing in the Champ Car World Series with Paul Gentilozzi&#x27;s Rocketsports team. His best finish was second place at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve at the Molson Indy Montreal in Canada, where he was defeated by Oriol Servia. In the closing laps of the race Glock twice retained the lead over Servia by missing the track&#x27;s final chicane. As the rules require drivers who gain or retain a position by driving off the racing surface to give way, Glock was asked to move over by Champ Car officials, and let Servia take the lead. Glock obliged midway through the final lap, giving him enough time to try to take the lead back, but to no avail. Glock finished 8th in the final season points standings and won the Champ Car World Series&#x27; Rookie of the Year award.

==GP2==

===2006–2007===

In 2006, Glock raced in Europe in the GP2 Series, the level immediately below Formula One. He started with the midfield BCN Competicion team, gaining average results. In mid-season, however, he moved to the front-running iSport team and after a string of improved results finished fourth in the drivers&#x27; standings, also winning an award for &quot;most improved driver&quot; in the series. In he tested an F1 car again for BMW Sauber, which led to him being signed in December as the team&#x27;s second test driver for .

Glock was also re-signed for 2007 by iSport and won one feature race and four sprint races on his way to the championship. Following the serious crash of regular Formula One BMW driver Robert Kubica in Canada, it was speculated that Glock might take over the drive. However, the team instead chose its lead test driver Sebastian Vettel. Vettel&#x27;s drive as a fill-in helped him get a full-time racing seat with the Toro Rosso team later in the season, starting at the Hungarian Grand Prix, and Glock was then promoted to the main test and reserve driver for BMW.
==Return to Formula One==

===Toyota (2008–2009)===
====2008 season====

After winning the GP2 Series in 2007, Glock was connected to several F1 teams. He signed a contract with Toyota F1, though still under a test driver contract with BMW, which led to the dispute being brought before the Contract Recognition Board. In November, the CRB ruled that Glock was free to race for Toyota in and shortly afterwards Glock signed a three-year contract to replace Ralf Schumacher at Toyota. He scored his first points of 2008 in the Canadian Grand Prix, finishing 4th ahead of Felipe Massa&#x27;s Ferrari. Glock qualified a career-best fifth at the Hungarian Grand Prix, and finished the race in second place. At the Singapore Grand Prix, Glock finished 4th, one of his best of the season.

====Infamous season finale moment====
In the final race of the 2008 season, the Brazilian Grand Prix, Glock was seventh with a few laps to go when rain started covering the track. Glock remained on the track with dry-weather tyres, while most of the other drivers, including championship contender Lewis Hamilton, opted to pit for wet tyres. The decision to stay out moved Glock up the order, ahead of Hamilton on track. Starting the final lap, Glock was fourth but was struggling on his dry-weather tyres as the rain intensified. He was passed by Toro Rosso&#x27;s Sebastian Vettel and McLaren&#x27;s Lewis Hamilton in the final corners. Hamilton regained fifth place to win the 2008 Drivers&#x27; Championship and eclipsed rival Felipe Massa by one point, while Glock trailed behind in sixth. The incident led to significant backlash from many Brazilian fans who were in support of Massa, insinuating Glock was at fault for Hamilton&#x27;s win. Glock revealed years later that he and the Toyota team members had a police escort them off the country to protect him from further abuse. During live ITV coverage of the race, commentator Martin Brundle shouted &quot;Is that Glock going slowly?&quot; during Hamilton&#x27;s overtake on him, which would become an internet meme.

Glock finished the 2008 championship in tenth position, with 25 points, behind teammate Jarno Trulli.

====2009 season====

After being in the top 10 in all three practice sessions in Australia, Glock qualified 6th on the grid. However, the rear wing of his (and teammate Trulli&#x27;s) Toyota was deemed to be too flexible and thus illegal, and his time was cleared and he started 19th. During the race, he worked his way through the pack to finish in 5th place. However, after the race, Lewis Hamilton was disqualified and stripped of his 4th-place finish, and Glock was promoted to 4th. A week later in Malaysia, he qualified 5th, but started 3rd after penalties to both Sebastian Vettel and Rubens Barrichello. At the start of the race, Glock slipped to 8th, but an inspired tyre choice as the rain started, coupled with precise driving, saw Glock finish in 3rd when the race was ended early on lap 32.

Consecutive seventh places for Glock in the rain in China, and in the dry in Bahrain had given him a total of 12 points for the season, although these finishes came in contrasting ways. In China he qualified 14th, not making it out of Qualifying 2, whilst in Bahrain he qualified 2nd, led the race in the first stint, but he had a poor second stint on hard tyres which forced him to battle his way back to seventh by the end of the race. Glock earned his second podium of the season when he finished 2nd behind Lewis Hamilton at the Singapore Grand Prix after qualifying in 6th. The race began well when Glock passed Alonso and was given a place by Mark Webber who was forced to let Alonso overtake. Late in the race Glock seemed set for 3rd place until Nico Rosberg crossed the white line exiting the pits, earning him a drive through penalty and allowing Glock to easily take 2nd place.

In qualifying for the 2009 Japanese Grand Prix, Glock crashed heavily at the last corner and was airlifted to hospital with a leg injury. As he was not fit to race, Jarno Trulli was the only driver representing Toyota. On 11 October 2009, Toyota confirmed that its test driver Kamui Kobayashi would make his race debut in the Brazilian Grand Prix, as Glock had suffered further complications from his accident, resulting in a cracked vertebra and he would not be guaranteed to be fit in time to race in Brazil and Abu Dhabi. Toyota pulled out of F1 at the end of 2009, leaving an uncertain future for Glock.
===Virgin (2010–2011)===

Glock&#x27;s future for a time appeared uncertain, but on 17 November new team Manor Grand Prix announced that he had signed for them and would be their lead driver for the 2010 and 2011 seasons. It seemed as though Glock would partner Polish driver Robert Kubica at Renault, but following Renault&#x27;s decision to announce whether it will take part in Formula 1 for 2010, Glock chose an option where he will be guaranteed a drive although the car might be less competitive. Manor became Virgin Racing in November 2009 and that Glock&#x27;s former GP2 rival Lucas di Grassi would become his teammate. Glock started the 2010 season with three successive retirements in Bahrain, Australia and Malaysia. In addition, he failed to start the Chinese Grand Prix due to engine failure; This was despite good qualifying performances which saw him out-qualify all of the new teams&#x27; drivers in Bahrain and regularly start higher than his teammate Di Grassi. The Spanish Grand Prix was where he recorded his first finish for the team, and his first finish of the season with 18th place. Glock&#x27;s best result of the season saw him finish in 14th in Japan, the team&#x27;s best result of the year.

In 2011, Jérôme d&#x27;Ambrosio joined Glock at the team, where he failed to start the .

On 24 July 2011, it was announced that Glock had signed a 3-year extension to his current contract, committing him to Virgin until 2014.

===Marussia (2012)===

The team was renamed as Marussia F1 for the 2012 season and he would partner his third teammate in his three years at the team, French rookie Charles Pic. Marussia were forced to pull out of pre-season testing after failing a crash test for rear impact but eventually they passed allowing Glock to compete in the opening race. Glock started the 2012 season strongly by finishing 14th in Australia which equaled his highest ever finish with the Virgin/Marussia team. Glock came 17th in Malaysia, and then scored two consecutive 19th-place finishes in China and Bahrain. Furthermore, he finished 18th in the , before he achieved 14th again in Monaco and retired from the race with a brake malfunction.
Glock withdrew from the after contracting a stomach bug. However, he was fit in time for the where he finished 18th, and he followed that up with 22nd at his home Grand Prix. It was reported at the Hungarian Grand Prix that a feud was brewing between Glock and his teammate after Pic blocked him during qualifying. Glock finished the race 21st after battling with Michael Schumacher and Pedro de la Rosa. Glock finished 15th at Spa after a collision with Pastor Maldonado. He suffered no damage and finished ahead of his teammate as they battled in the final stages of the race while also getting lapped by other cars. At Monza, he finished 17th after sustaining front wing damage after colliding with Vitaly Petrov in the second corner of lap 1.

However, at Singapore, he produced his best result for Marussia, finishing in 12th place after a faultless performance. This crucially pushed Marussia into 10th place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, due to a better non-points finishing record. In Japan Glock was up to 11th by the second lap after two first corner incidents, however he finished 16th. In Korea he finished 18th, and in India he came 20th after another battle with Michael Schumacher. He encountered Schumacher again in Abu Dhabi and let him pass to overtake Heikki Kovalainen who was in the crucial 12th place needed to demote Marussia to 11th in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. In São Paulo, he was running strongly and ahead of the Caterhams until he was hit by Jean-Éric Vergne. He claimed this &#x27;destroyed his race&#x27; with Petrov ultimately passing Charles Pic to take 10th spot for Caterham in the championship. Glock finished the season 20th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship; his best yet for the Virgin/Marussia team.

For the 2013 season he was due to remain with Marussia and partner Max Chilton who would have been his fourth teammate in four years at the team, however on 21 January 2013 it was confirmed that Glock had left Marussia by mutual consent. Glock was supposed to be replaced by Luiz Razia, but due to funding issues Razia&#x27;s contract was terminated prior to the start of the season. He would ultimately be replaced by Jules Bianchi.

==DTM==

Glock switched to the DTM in 2013, signing for BMW. In his third race he scored his first points and podium with third place. He would not score any more points until the final race of the season at Hockenheim, where he won his first DTM race of his career.

==Porsche Supercup==
In 2004 Glock made his Porsche Supercup debut for the Porsche AG Team for a one-off start at the Nürburgring finishing 6th in Race 1 and 7th in Race 2. In 2023 Glock returned as a guest driver for Porsche Motorsport in the number #911 at the Hungaroring and Monza finishing his first race in 19 years in 15th scoring a point but was not eligible due to being a guest driver. And in Monza finishing 9th. He returned in 2024 once again for Dr.Ing h.c. F. Porsche AG again in the number #911 driving in the round at the Red Bull Ring finishing 18th.

== Broadcasting career ==
Glock joined the German television broadcaster RTL as a pundit on its coverage of Formula One from 2018 to 2020. Since 2021, he has worked as an analyst for the pay-TV broadcaster Sky Sport after the broadcaster obtained exclusive broadcasting rights for Formula One in Germany.

==Personal life==
Glock lives in Switzerland with his wife, German model Isabell Reis. She travels the world with him during the season. Glock and Reis are neighbours and close friends with former Caterham F1 driver Heikki Kovalainen and his British wife Catherine Hyde.

<text>Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, sold under the trade names Bactrim, Cotrim (a short form of the British Approved Name, Co-trimoxazole) and Septra, among others, is a fixed-dose combination antibiotic medication used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. It consists of one part trimethoprim to five parts sulfamethoxazole. It is used to treat urinary tract infections, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin infections, travelers&#x27; diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, and cholera, among others. It is used both to treat and prevent pneumocystis pneumonia and toxoplasmosis in people with HIV/AIDS and other causes of immunosuppression. It can be given orally (swallowed by mouth) or intravenous infusion (slowly injected into a vein with an IV).
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 143rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole generally kills bacteria, by blocking the microorganisms&#x27; ability to make and to use folate.

=== &quot;Pneumocystis jirovecii&quot; pneumonia ===
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is the medicine most commonly used to prevent &quot;Pneumocystis jirovecii&quot; pneumonia (PCP) People who get &quot;Pneumocystis&quot; pneumonia have a medical condition that weakens their immune system, like HIV/AIDS, or take medicines (such as corticosteroid, monoclonal antibody and immunosuppressants) that reduce the body&#x27;s ability to fight bacterial and viral infections. People with HIV/AIDS are less likely to get &quot;Pneumocystis&quot; pneumonia as a result of antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, &quot;Pneumocystis&quot; pneumonia is still a substantial public health problem. Most of what is scientifically known about &quot;Pneumocystis&quot; pneumonia and its treatment comes from studying people with HIV/AIDS.

The only notable nonsusceptible organisms are &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, the mycoplasmae and &quot;Francisella tularensis&quot; (the causative organism of tularaemia).

=== Pregnancy and breast feeding ===
Its use during pregnancy is contraindicated, although it has been placed in Australian pregnancy category C. Its use during the first trimester (during organogenesis) and 12 weeks prior to pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially malformations associated with maternal folic acid deficiency (which is most likely related to the mechanism of action of co-trimoxazole) such as neural tube defects such as spina bifida, cardiovascular malformations (e.g. Ebstein&#x27;s anomaly), urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot in epidemiological studies. Its use later on during pregnancy also increases the risk of preterm labour (odds ratio: 1.51) and low birth weight (odds ratio: 1.67). Animal studies have yielded similarly discouraging results.

It appears to be safe for use during breastfeeding as long as the baby is healthy.

=== Babies ===
Its use in those less than 2 months of age is not recommended due to the risk of adverse side effects.

== Adverse effects ==
Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, rash, and diarrhea. Severe allergic reactions and &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection may occasionally occur. Its use in pregnancy is not recommended. It appears to be safe for use during breastfeeding as long as the baby is healthy.

== Contraindications ==
Contraindications include the following:
* Known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim, sulphonamides or any other ingredients in the formulations
* Pregnancy
* Severe liver failure, marked liver parenchymal damage, or jaundice.
* Serious haematological disorders and porphyria (due to the sulfonamide component of the preparation).
* Severe chronic kidney disease (CrCl &lt;15 ml/min) where repeated measurements of the plasma concentration cannot be performed
== Interactions ==
Its use is advised against in people being concomitantly treated with:
* ACE inhibitors like captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril, and ramipril due to the potential for additive hyperkalaemic effects
* Prilocaine — additive risk of methaemoglobinaemia
* Antiarrhythmics like amiodarone (increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias) and dofetilide (increased risk of QT interval prolongation)
* Antibacterials like dapsone (increases plasma levels of both drugs), methenamine (increased risk of crystalluria) and rifampicin (as it may lead to an increased plasma level of rifampicin and lower plasma levels of trimethoprim)
* Anticoagulants like warfarin and acenocoumarol — anticoagulant effects of either drug is potentiated by this combination
* Sulfonylureas — effects enhanced
* Phenytoin, half-life of phenytoin is increased
* Antifolates like pyrimethamine, proguanil and methotrexate increase the risk of associated side effects like bone marrow toxicity, folic acid supplementation should be considered. A significant risk of megaloblastic anaemia exists with doses of pyrimethamine in excess of 25 mg/wk.
* Antivirals, more specifically, lamivudine (increased plasma concentrations of lamivudine), zalcitabine (increased plasma concentrations of zalcitabine) and zidovudine (increased risk of haematological reactions)
* Procainamide and/or amantadine may have their plasma concentrations increased bilaterally or unilaterally.
* Clozapine and other antipsychotics — increased risk of haematological side effects
* Nucleoside analogue antineoplastics like azathioprine and mercaptopurine — increased risk of haematological toxicity
* Digoxin — increase in digoxin levels in a proportion of elderly patients
* Diuretics — elderly patients receiving thiazide diuretics are at a heightened risk for developing thrombocytopaenia while on co-trimoxazole
* Ciclosporin — patients who have received a kidney transplant and are receiving co-trimoxazole and ciclosporin concomitantly are at an increased risk of having a reversible deterioration in their kidney function.
* Spironolactone — concurrent use can increase the likelihood of hyperkalemia, especially in the elderly. The trimethoprim portion acts to prevent potassium excretion in the distal tubule of the nephron.
* Potassium aminobenzoate — effects of sulfonamides (like Sulfamethoxazole) inhibited.
* Laboratory tests — trimethoprim and sulfonamides have been reported to interfere with diagnostic tests, including serum-methotrexate and elevated serum creatinine levels, also urea, urinary glucose and urobilinogen tests.
=== Overdose ===
Likely signs of toxicity include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Mental depression
* Confusion
* Thrombocytopenia
* Uremia
* Bone marrow depression
* Loss of appetite
* Colic
* Drowsiness
* Unconsciousness
The recommended treatment for overdose includes:
* Administration of activated charcoal
* Stomach pumping
* General supportive measures
* Haemodialysis, which is moderately effective in clearing co-trimoxazole from the plasma.
* Calcium folinate treatment in cases of blood dyscrasias
* Forcing oral fluids
Alkalinisation of the urine may reduce the toxicity of sulfamethoxazole, but it may increase the toxic effects of trimethoprim.

== Pharmacology ==
The synergy between trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole was first described in the late 1960s. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole have a greater effect when given together than when given separately, because they inhibit successive steps in the folate synthesis pathway. They are given in a one-to-five ratio in their tablet formulations so that when they enter the body their concentration in the blood and tissues is roughly one-to-twenty — the exact ratio required for a peak synergistic effect between the two.

Sulfamethoxazole, a sulfonamide, induces its therapeutic effects by interfering with the &quot;de novo&quot; (that is, from within the cell) synthesis of folate inside microbial organisms such as protozoa, fungi and bacteria. It does this by competing with &quot;p&quot;-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the biosynthesis of dihydrofolate.

Trimethoprim serves as a competitive inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), hence inhibiting the &quot;de novo&quot; synthesis of tetrahydrofolate, the biologically active form of folate.

Tetrahydrofolate is crucial in the synthesis of purines, thymidine, and methionine which are needed for the production of DNA and proteins during bacterial replication.

The effects of trimethoprim causes a backlog of dihydrofolate (DHF) and this backlog can work against the inhibitory effect the drug has on tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis. This is where the sulfamethoxazole comes in; its role is in depleting the excess DHF by preventing it from being synthesised in the first place.

Co-trimoxazole was claimed to be more effective than either of its components individually in treating bacterial infections, although this was later disputed.

<text>Wofford College is a private liberal arts college in Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States. Founded in 1854, it is one of the few four-year institutions in the southeastern United States founded before the American Civil War that still operates on its original campus. The campus is a national arboretum.

Wofford was founded with a bequest of $100,000 from Benjamin Wofford, a Methodist minister and Spartanburg native who sought to create a college for &quot;literary, classical, and scientific education in my native district of Spartanburg.&quot; The college&#x27;s Main Building is the oldest structure on campus and was designed by the noted Charleston architect Edward C. Jones. In 1941, the college was awarded a chapter of the honor society Phi Beta Kappa, and the Beta of South Carolina chapter was the first at a private college in South Carolina.

==Wofford College Historic District==

The Wofford College Historic District consists of the Main Building, which was designed by Edward C. Jones in the Italianate style, and six two-story brick residences. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Construction of the Main Building began in 1852, and the first classes were held in the fall of 1854. The Wofford campus is designated as a national arboretum.

==Endowment==

During the Civil War, the endowment was invested in Confederate bonds and other securities, which became worthless by the end of the war.

In February 2021, Jerry Richardson, alumnus and founding owner of the Carolina Panthers, donated $150 million to the college&#x27;s endowment, which, according to Wofford statements, exceeds $400 million.

==Academics==
The academic year consists of a four-month fall semester, a one-month January term called the Interim, and a four-month spring semester.

===Faculty===
136 full-time faculty teach at the college, 92 percent of whom have earned a doctorate or equivalent terminal degree. The FTE faculty-to-student ratio is 1:11.

===Majors and minors===
Wofford offers academic majors in a variety of areas including 27 majors.

The college also offers pre-professional programs in teacher education (secondary certification), dentistry, medicine, law, ministry, engineering, and veterinary science. The college&#x27;s Army ROTC program was established in 1919.

===Interim program===
The Interim program is designed to provide students with opportunities to gain new experiences outside the realm of traditional academics and allows students to become involved in departments outside their academic majors. Interims generally fall into one of four categories. In the most common type, students enrol in faculty-proposed projects on campus. These projects range from participation in theatre to pottery, knitting, and short story writing. Students may elect to enrol in internship projects that are supervised by faculty but involve working off-campus in legal, medical, dental, congressional, corporate, or non-profit settings. Students may propose independent research projects under the supervision of a faculty sponsor. Finally, faculty-led travel projects take groups of students and professors to study in other parts of the United States or in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, or Australia. Recent travel projects have included studies in England and Ireland, South Africa, Peru, Brazil, Belize, Vietnam, China, and Japan.

===International programs===
The college&#x27;s Office of International Programs helps students select from over 200 study abroad programs in 59 countries. Wofford consistently ranks in the nation&#x27;s top ten in the Institute of International Education Open Doors Survey, which is based on comparing the number of students earning credits abroad in a given year to the number of students in the graduating class. Wofford&#x27;s 2009 score was 93%, compared to the Lincoln Commission national average of 9% of graduates earning credits abroad. The college has had six Fulbright English Teaching assistantships in the past four years as well as two Rotary Ambassadorial Scholarships. In 2012, Rachel Woodlee was selected as Wofford&#x27;s sixth Rhodes Scholar.

===Reputation and rankings===
Wofford is tied for 59 of 199 in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s list of the best national liberal arts colleges.

&quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Wofford 190th out of the top 500 rated private and public colleges and universities in America for the 2024-25 report. Wofford was also ranked 43rd among liberal arts universities and 45th in the south.

==Athletics==
The Wofford Terriers compete in NCAA Division I in the Southern Conference. Wofford&#x27;s colors are old gold and black. The school mascot is the Terrier. In the 2010 NCAA Division I graduation success report, 9 of 13 Wofford teams posted GRS scores of 100, the highest available mark. For the past 16 years, the Carolina Panthers have made their summer training camp home at Wofford. The Shrine Bowl of the Carolinas (a high school all-star football game) is played at Wofford&#x27;s Gibbs Stadium. Boss, a Boston Terrier, is the mascot for Wofford&#x27;s teams.

==Student life==
Wofford offers a self-contained environment (93% of students live on campus). The Village apartment-style housing for the senior class was a 2008 &quot;Dorm of Distinction&quot; as chosen by &quot;University Business Magazine&quot;.

===Student organizations===
Students participate in various service, pre-professional, religious, social, and other student organizations. Student publications at the college started with a literary magazine first published in 1889. The student newspaper, the &quot;Old Gold and Black&quot;, is published every other week; the yearbook is called &quot;The Bohemian&quot;. Delta Phi Alpha, the national collegiate German honorary society, was founded at Wofford, as was the National Beta Club, an honorary society prominent in American high schools.

In 1941, the college was awarded a chapter of the academic honor society Phi Beta Kappa. This was the first chapter at a private college in South Carolina.

===Service learning===
Wofford has a variety of student service organizations on campus, including the Bonner Scholars, and ONE.

===Fraternities and sororities===
Around half the student body is said to participate in Greek life.

===Diversity===
In each of the years from 1901 through 1904, two women graduated from Wofford. In 1964, Wofford became the first private college in South Carolina to desegregate voluntarily with the admission of Albert Gray.

<doc id="995636" wikidata="Q1962728" url="?curid=995636" title="Course (navigation)">
<text>In navigation, the course of a watercraft or aircraft is the cardinal direction in which the craft is to be steered. The course is to be distinguished from the &quot;heading&quot;, which is the direction where the watercraft&#x27;s bow or the aircraft&#x27;s nose is pointed.
The path that a vessel follows is called a track or, in the case of aircraft, ground track (also known as &quot;course made good&quot; or &quot;course over the ground&quot;). The intended track is a route.

== Discussion ==


For ships and aircraft, routes are typically straight-line segments between waypoints. A navigator determines the &quot;bearing&quot; (the compass direction from the craft&#x27;s current position) of the next waypoint. Because water currents or wind can cause a craft to drift off course, a navigator sets a &quot;course to steer&quot; that compensates for drift. The helmsman or pilot points the craft on a &quot;heading&quot; that corresponds to the course to steer. If the predicted drift is correct, then the craft&#x27;s track will correspond to the planned course to the next waypoint. Course directions are specified in degrees from north, either true or magnetic. In aviation, north is usually expressed as 360°. Navigators used ordinal directions, instead of compass degrees, e.g. &quot;northeast&quot; instead of 45° until the mid-20th century when the use of degrees became prevalent.

<text>Cycling at the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]] in Athens, consisted of 31 events in two disciplines, track cycling and road cycling. Track cycling took place at the Olympic Velodrome, and road cycling at Vouliagmeni.

==Classifications and events==
*B 1–3: Visually impaired athletes; these cyclists used tandem bicycles, with an able-bodied rider in the front seat
*LC 1–4: Lower limb and other locomotor disabilities graded by severity; unlike most Paralympic classes, higher numbers here indicate more severe conditions
*CP 1–4: Athletes with cerebral palsy or a similar disability; 1 and 2 used tricycles, 3 and 4 used bicycles
*HC A, B &amp; C: Hand-using athletes, graded according to their degree of paraplegia or quadriplegia; these cyclists used handcycles

Track events consisted of:
*Individual pursuit
*Time trial
*Individual sprint, covering three laps of the track
*Team sprint, with teams of three

Road events consisted of endurance races and time trials. In the endurance road races, athletes with cerebral palsy cycled for a minimum of 15 kilometres, while men with visual impairment covered 120 kilometres. In the time trials, the distances were the same for each classification.

<text>Friedrichstraße, or Friedrichstrasse (see ß; ) (lit. &quot;Frederick Street&quot;), is a major culture and shopping street in central Berlin, forming the core of the Friedrichstadt neighborhood and giving the name to Berlin Friedrichstraße station. It runs from the northern part of the old Mitte district (north of which it is called Chausseestraße) to the Hallesches Tor in the district of Kreuzberg.

This downtown area is known for its expensive real estate market and the campus of the Hertie School of Governance. Due to its north-southerly direction, it forms important junctions with the east-western axes, most notably with Leipziger Straße and Unter den Linden. The U6 U-Bahn line runs underneath. During the Cold War it was bisected by the Berlin Wall and was the location of Checkpoint Charlie.

==Overview==

As central Berlin&#x27;s traditional shopping street, Friedrichstraße is three blocks east of the parallel Wilhelmstraße, the historic heart of the old government quarter () until 1945.

Friedrichstraße was badly damaged during World War II and only partly rebuilt during the division of Berlin. The section in West Berlin was partly rebuilt as a residential street; in the late 1960s, the remains of the former Belle-Alliance-Platz at the end of the Friedrichstraße, renamed Mehringplatz, were completely demolished and replaced with a concrete housing and office development designed by Hans Scharoun. Despite its central location, this area remains relatively poor.

In the East Berlin section, plans were put into place to widen the street to four lanes as was done to the Leipziger Straße; the Hotel Unter den Linden (demolished 2006) and the original Lindencorso (demolished 1991) were the only structures built during this time with the wider profile of the street in mind. The Grand Hotel Berlin, East Germany&#x27;s top 5-star hotel, was built across from the Hotel Unter den Linden in 1987. Further plans were drawn up for a rebuilding of the street, and construction was well underway at the time of German reunification in 1990, when the East German Plattenbau-based construction was stopped and subsequently demolished; only a few buildings that were already complete and occupied were spared. The completed Berlin Casino building located at the corner of Leipziger Straße was torn down in 1994.
Friedrichstraße was rebuilt in the 1990s, and at the time it was the city&#x27;s largest construction project; work continues north of Friedrichstraße station. From 1992 until 1996, construction works took place for a six-building, $800 million, multi-use complex developed by Tishman Speyer, among others. The buildings have a city-imposed height limit of about 100 feet. A number of well-known architects contributed to the plans, including Jean Nouvel, who designed the Galeries Lafayette department store (&quot;Quartier 207&quot;); Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners, who planned &quot;Quartier 206&quot;; and Oswald Mathias Ungers, who created &quot;Quartier 205&quot;. Philip Johnson created parts of the American Business Center at Checkpoint Charlie, a $751 million five-building complex of offices, shops and apartments developed by Ronald Lauder and Central European Media Enterprises. The redevelopment received mixed reviews.

During the Cold War and division of Berlin, the Friedrichstraße underground station, despite being located in East Berlin, was utilized by two intersecting West Berlin S-Bahn lines and the West Berlin subway line U6. The station served as a transfer point for these lines, and trains stopped there, although all other stations on these lines in East Berlin were sealed-off ghost stations (), where trains passed through under guard without stopping. At Friedrichstraße station, West Berlin passengers could transfer from one platform to another but could not leave the station without the appropriate papers. The section of the station open to West Berlin lines was heavily guarded and was sealed off from the smaller part of it serving as a terminus of the East Berlin S-Bahn and as a station for long-distance trains.

In 2020, a section of Friedrichstraße was closed off for motorized traffic during a five-month trial period with the intent to revitalize urban space.

<text>The Matobo National Park forms the core of the Matobo or Matopos Hills, an area of granite kopjes and wooded valleys commencing some south of Bulawayo, southern Zimbabwe. The hills were formed over 2 billion years ago with granite being forced to the surface; it has eroded to produce smooth &quot;whaleback dwalas&quot; and broken kopjes, strewn with boulders and interspersed with thickets of vegetation. Matopo/Matob was named by the Lozwi. A different tradition states that the first King, Mzilikazi Khumalo when told by the local residents that the great granite domes were called madombo he replied, possible half jest, &quot;We will call them matobo&quot; - an Isindebele play on &#x27;Bald heads&#x27;.

The Hills cover an area of about , of which is National Park, the remainder being largely communal land and a small proportion of commercial farmland. The park extends along the Thuli, Mtshelele, Maleme and Mpopoma river valleys. Part of the national park is set aside as a game park, which has been stocked with game including the white rhinoceros. The highest point in the hills is the promontory named Gulati (1,549 m; ) just outside the north-eastern corner of the park.

Administratively, Matobo National Park incorporates the Lake Matopos Recreational Park, being the area around Hazelside, Sandy Spruit and Lake Matopos.

The national park is located within the southern Africa bushveld ecoregion.

==History==

The national park is the oldest in Zimbabwe, established in 1926 as Rhodes Matopos National Park, a bequest from Cecil Rhodes. The original park borders extended well to the south and east of the current park. These areas were redesignated for settlement as part of a compromise between the colonial authorities and the local people, creating the Khumalo and Matobo Communal Lands. The park area then increased with the acquisition of World&#x27;s View and Hazelside farms to the north.

The current name Matobo reflects the correct vernacular pronunciation of the area.

The Matobo Hills were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003. The area &quot;exhibits a profusion of distinctive rock landforms rising above the granite shield that covers much of Zimbabwe&quot;.

==Features==
===Flora===

The Matobo Hills is an area of high botanic diversity, with over 200 species of tree recorded in the national park, including the mountain acacia, wild pear and the paperbark acacia. There are also many aloes, wild herbs and over 100 grass species. Many types of rare endemic plants have been recorded.

===Fauna===
Matobo National Park has a wide diversity of fauna: 175 bird, 88 mammal, 39 snake and 16 fish species. Game include white rhinos, sable antelopes, impala and leopards. The park contains the world&#x27;s densest population of the latter, due to the abundance of hyrax, which make up 50% of their diet. The game park in the west has been restocked with white and black rhinos, the former from KwaZulu-Natal in the 1960s and the latter from the Zambezi Valley in the 1990s. It has been designated as an Intensive Protection Zone for the two species, as well as hyenas, hippopotami, giraffes, zebras, wildebeests and ostriches.

Matobo National Park contains the highest concentration of black eagles, and breeding pairs of these birds, worldwide.
A limnological research centre has operated since 1950 at Maleme Dam and researched species such as the yellow-fish, &quot;Barbus mattozi&quot;.

===Geography and geology===

The Matobo Hills are composed entirely of granite, making up the Matopos Batholith. The granite weathers into fantastic shapes, such as the balancing rocks known as &quot;Mother and Child Kopje&quot;. Between the granite mountains, narrow valleys form. These are often swampy valleys known as dambos or vleis, due to runoff from the whaleback mountains. These valleys form the headwaters of the Maleme, Mpopoma and Mtsheleli rivers, and the source of the Thuli River is just east of the park.

===Archaeological, historical and cultural sites===
San (Bushmen) lived in the hills about 2,000 years ago, leaving a rich heritage in hundreds of rock paintings. There are over 3,000 registered rock art sites, with the main periods of painting being between 320 and 500 C.E.. In the many crevices and caves, clay ovens and other historic artefacts have been found, and various archaeological finds date back as far as the Pre-Middle Stone Age, around 300,000 B.P. The following major sites have been developed for tourist access:

&quot;Bambata Cave&quot; is a major archaeological site, located in the west of the national park, north of the game park on the Kezi-Bulawayo road. The frieze includes elephants, giraffes, warthogs, tsessebe and mongoose.

&quot;Inanke Cave&quot; has the most extensive paintings, located in a remote cave accessible by a three-hour hike from Toghwana Dam. Along the route of the hike is an Iron Age furnace.
&quot;Nswatugi Cave&quot; contains friezes of giraffes, elephants and kudu. Access is from Circular Drive, west of Maleme Dam. A human skeleton was found here dating 42000 BC belonged to Middle Stone Age.

&quot;Pomongwe Cave&quot;, near Maleme Dam, was damaged by a preservation attempt in 1965, where linseed oil was applied to the paintings. Archaeological digs within and downslope of the cave revealed 39,032 stone tools, several hearths, with the main fire-making areas were in the centre of the cave floor. Bone fragments showed that hyrax formed a major part of the meat component of the diet of early human inhabitants of the cave, which also included tortoise, baboons and larger game animals. The oldest material on the site is probably pre-Middle Stone Age.

&quot;White Rhino Shelter&quot; is a small site near Gordon Park, on the main tarred road through the park. The frieze includes the outline of large rhinos, which is said to have inspired the re-introduction of the species in the 1960s.

The grandeur and stillness of the hills has contributed to their hallowed reputation, especially to the Shona and Ndebele people. Many rituals and other religious activities are performed in the hills. Before the colonial era, it was the headquarters of the spiritualist oracle, the Mlimo.
The hills were the scene of the famous indaba between white settlers and Ndebele leaders in 1896—the Second Matabele War, known in Zimbabwe as the First Chimurenga—which ended with the assassination of the Mlimo by Frederick Russell Burnham, the American scout, in one of the Matobo caves. Upon learning of the death of the Mlimo, Cecil Rhodes boldly walked alone and unarmed into this Ndebele stronghold and persuaded the impi to lay down their arms. During the indaba it was also in these hills that Robert Baden-Powell, the &quot;Founder of Scouting&quot;, first learned woodcraft, the fundamentals of scouting, from Burnham. Today much of the pottery and artifacts found on cave floors and most of the clay grain bins in the hills are remnants from the 1896 rebellion era. There are other reminders too - bronze plaques dotting the area mark the sites of armed forts or brief skirmishes.
Cecil Rhodes, Leander Starr Jameson, and several other leading early white settlers, including Allan Wilson and all the members of the Shangani Patrol killed in the First Matabele War, are buried on the summit of Malindidzimu, the &#x27;hill of the spirits&#x27; -- this is a great source of controversy in modern Zimbabwe as this is considered a sacred place by nationalists and indigenous groups. This mount is also referred to as the World’s View. (Not to be confused with the World&#x27;s View, Nyanga).
Mzilikazi is also buried at Matopos Hill. 

A memorial shrine, erected by the Memorable Order of Tin Hats (MOTH), an organization that seeks to commemorate the sacrifice of Rhodesian servicemen and women during World War One and World War Two, can be accessed in the Park.

==Accommodation and camping==
===Maleme Camp===

This is the main camp in the centre of the park, and hosts the park headquarters. All accommodation is self-catering. There are eighteen lodges and six chalets, the former fully equipped and the latter with communal ablutions and without crockery or cutlery. Three of the lodges, Imbila, Black Eagle and Fish Eagle, offer views over the Maleme Gorge. Imbila Lodge offers a higher standard of luxury with ensuite bathrooms and teak furniture. Camping and caravan sites are situated along the eastern shores of Maleme Dam.

===Mtsheleli Camp===

Located in the south, this camp offers campings and caravan sites.

===Mwesilume Camp===

Located on Circular Drive, west of Maleme Dam, this camp offers campings and caravan sites.

===Toghwana Camp===

Located in the east, this camp offers campings and caravan sites.

===Arboretum Camp===

===Sandy Spruit Camp===

Located in the east of Lake Matopos Recreational Park, this camp offers campings and caravan sites.

===Lake Matopos Camp===

Located in the north of Lake Matopos Recreational Park, this camp offers campings and caravan sites.

===Privately operated camps and sites===

The Boy Scouts Association of Zimbabwe operates a camp called Gordon Park, in the north of the Mtsheleli Valley. Gordon Park is a 115 ha lease from the Parks and Wildlife Management Authority and is maintained as far as possible close to natural conditions. In addition to camping sites for Scout Troops there is a small cottage. The Girl Guides Association of Zimbabwe maintains a camp site at Rowallan Park, in the north of the Mtsheleli Valley.

Big Cave Camp is a privately owned camp, bordering the Matobo National Park. The Camp offers four star accommodation in seven granite under thatch lodges and separate camping facilities elsewhere on the property. Activities on offer include game drives, game walks, bird watching, tours to famous rock art galleries, as well as tours to Rhodes Grave. The Big Cave property is approximately , and is ideal for walking and birdwatching. Facilities include a natural rock pool for swimming, the &quot;Leopards Lair&quot; bar and dining area which incorporates a huge granite boulder into the building, as well as separate library area.

Camp Amalinda and Matobo Ingwe Lodge are commercial lodges.

==Tourism==
===Access===

By road from Bulawayo: Take Robert Mugabe Way in the city centre; this turns into Matopos Road which continues south some 30 km to the park boundary. This is a two-lane tarred road. A single lane tarred road continues to Maleme Dam and Rest Camp. The remaining roads in the park are gravel or earth, but suitable for most vehicles. However, access to Toghwana Dam during the rainy season may require four wheel drive.

The park can also be reached from Gwanda: taking the Thuli-Makwe road towards Kezi and turning north on the main Kezi-Bulawayo road.

===Game viewing===

Some game can be seen throughout the park, with regular sightings of white rhino, sable antelope and impala. However, the best viewing is to be had in the 105 km2 Game Park, in the west of the national park. The game park, also known as Whovi or Hove Wild Area was established with animals translocated from the border areas of Hwange National Park. It has been restocked with white and black rhinos. Other animals to be seen include sable antelope, giraffe, zebra, impala, wildebeest and ostrich. On rare occasion in the late afternoon to early evening visitors, can be lucky enough to spot leopard, with many nights being disturbed by the ruckus of baboons screaming due to leopard attacks. There are two game viewing hides.

===Hiking===

With its scenery, climate and safe environment, Matobo has a number of hiking trails. Shorter hikes and walks include:
* Lakeside walk, Maleme Dam, from Fish Eagle lodge
* Mount Pomongwe, near Maleme Camp
* Maleme Camp to Pomongwe Cave rock paintings

Longer hikes include:
* Climbing mount Shumbashawa, near Gordon Park
* Climbing Nyahwe mountain
* Hike from Toghwana Dam to Inanke Cave and rock paintings.

Accompanied hikes, with an armed game scout are available from Maleme Rest Camp

===Running===

The &quot;33 miler road race&quot; is run annually in the park.

===Trail riding===

Supervised horse trails are arranged by the Parks and Wildlife staff. There are two routes:
* From Maleme Camp and visiting scenic locations in the Maleme valley and environs.
* From Whitewater Office into the game park for game viewing.

===Fishing===

The many dams in the park allow for pleasant fishing, notably for &quot;Tilapia&quot; and bass. Bass were stocked into seven of the parks dams from the research station at Maleme Dam. The park entry fee includes a fishing license.

===Boating===

Boating is possible on the larger dams, such as Maleme, Mtshelele, Toghwana and Lake Matopos. Privately owned boats are permitted subject to approval of the parks&#x27; officials.

==In popular culture==

A Zimbabwean cheese has been named &quot;Matopos&quot;, after the hills.

The name of the park has been used twice in films: According to director Stéphanie Machuret, the title and landscape in her 2007 film &quot;Matopos&quot;, about a traditional healer, were inspired by the park. The name was also used for the fictional Democratic Republic of Matobo in the film &quot;The Interpreter&quot;.

<text>A tallboy is a piece of furniture incorporating a chest of drawers and a wardrobe on top. A highboy consists of double chest of drawers (a chest-on-chest), with the lower section usually wider than the upper. A lowboy is a table-height set of drawers designed to hold a clothes chest, which had been the predominant place one stored clothes for many centuries. 

==Details==
Whereas the chest of drawers in its familiar form contains three long and two short drawers, the highboy has five, six, or seven long drawers, and two short ones. It is a very late 17th-century development of the smaller chest. The early examples are walnut, but by far the largest portion of the many that have survived are mahogany, this being the wood most frequently employed in the 18th century for the construction of furniture, especially the more massive pieces. Occasionally the walnut at the beginning of the vogue was inlaid, just as satinwood varieties were inlaid, depending for relief upon carved cornice-mouldings or gadrooning, and upon handsome brass handles and escutcheons.

The tallboy was the wardrobe of the 18th century, but it eventually gave place to the modern type of wardrobe, which, with its sliding doors, was speedily found to be not only capacious as its predecessor but more convenient of access. The topmost drawers of the tallboy could only be reached by the use of bed steps, and the disappearance of high beds and the consequent disuse of steps exercised a certain influence in displacing a characteristic piece of furniture which was popular for at least a century.

== Philadelphia ==
In the mid-18th century, highboys in North America became very ornate. The most elaborate pieces came from Philadelphia. At that time it was one of the most important American cities, both before and after the American Revolution, and was a center of style and culture.

<doc id="995668" wikidata="Q193918" url="?curid=995668" title="Boil">
<text>A boil, also called a furuncle, is a deep folliculitis, which is an infection of the hair follicle. It is most commonly caused by infection by the bacterium &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, resulting in a painful swollen area on the skin caused by an accumulation of pus and dead tissue. Boils are therefore basically pus-filled nodules. Individual boils clustered together are called carbuncles.
Most human infections are caused by coagulase-positive &quot;S. aureus&quot; strains, notable for the bacteria&#x27;s ability to produce coagulase, an enzyme that can clot blood. Almost any organ system can be infected by &quot;S. aureus&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==

Boils are bumpy, red, pus-filled lumps around a hair follicle that are tender, warm, and painful. They range from pea-sized to golf ball-sized. A yellow or white point at the center of the lump can be seen when the boil is ready to drain or discharge pus. In a severe infection, an individual may experience fever, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue. A recurring boil is called chronic furunculosis. Skin infections tend to be recurrent in many patients and often spread to other family members. Systemic factors that lower resistance commonly are detectable, including: diabetes, obesity, and hematologic disorders.

Boils may appear on the buttocks or near the anus, the back, the neck, the belly, the chest, the arms or legs, or even in the ear canal. Boils may also appear around the eye, where they are called styes.

===Complications===
The most common complications of boils are scarring and infection or abscess of the skin, spinal cord, brain, kidneys, or other organs. Infections may also spread to the bloodstream (bacteremia) and become life-threatening. &quot;S. aureus&quot; strains first infect the skin and its structures (for example, sebaceous glands, hair follicles) or invade damaged skin (cuts, abrasions). Sometimes the infections are relatively limited (such as a stye, boil, furuncle, or carbuncle), but other times they may spread to other skin areas (causing cellulitis, folliculitis, or impetigo). Unfortunately, these bacteria can reach the bloodstream (bacteremia) and end up in many different body sites, causing infections (wound infections, abscesses, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pneumonia) that may severely harm or kill the infected person. &quot;S. aureus&quot; strains also produce enzymes and exotoxins that likely cause or increase the severity of certain diseases. Such diseases include food poisoning, septic shock, toxic shock syndrome, and scalded skin syndrome.

==Causes==

===Bacteria===
Naturally the cause is bacteria such as staphylococci that are present on the skin. Bacterial colonisation begins in the hair follicles and can cause local cellulitis and inflammation. Myiasis caused by the tumbu fly in Africa usually presents with cutaneous furuncles. Risk factors for furunculosis include bacterial carriage in the nostrils, diabetes mellitus, obesity, lymphoproliferative neoplasms, malnutrition, and use of immunosuppressive drugs.

===Family history===
People with recurrent boils are as well more likely to have a positive family history, take antibiotics, and to have been hospitalised, anemic, or diabetic; they are also more likely to have associated skin diseases and multiple lesions.

===Other===
Other causes include poor immune system function such as from HIV/AIDS, diabetes, malnutrition, or alcoholism. Poor hygiene and obesity have also been linked. It may occur following antibiotic use due to the development of resistance to the antibiotics used. An associated skin disease favors recurrence. This may be attributed to the persistent colonization of abnormal skin with &quot;S. aureus&quot; strains, such as is the case in persons with atopic dermatitis.
Boils which recur under the arm, breast or in the groin area may be associated with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is made through clinical evaluation by a physician, which may include culturing of the lesion. Evaluation can further include imaging, such as an ultrasound, to evaluate for formation of an abscess or other complications.

==Treatment==
A boil may clear up on its own without bursting, but more often it will need to be opened and drained. This will usually happen spontaneously within two weeks. Regular application of a warm moist compress, both before and after a boil opens, can help speed healing. The area must be kept clean, hands washed after touching it, and any dressings disposed of carefully, in order to avoid spreading the bacteria. A doctor may cut open or &quot;lance&quot; a boil to allow it to drain, but squeezing or cutting should not be attempted at home, as this may further spread the infection. Antibiotic therapy may be recommended for large or recurrent boils or those that occur in sensitive areas (such as the groin, breasts, armpits, around or in the nostrils, or in the ear). An antibiotic should not be used for longer than one month, with at least two months (preferably longer) between uses, otherwise it will lose its effectiveness.

Furuncles at risk of leading to serious complications should be incised and drained if antibiotics or steroid injections are not effective. These include furuncles that are unusually large, last longer than two weeks, or occur in the middle of the face or near the spine. Fever and chills are signs of sepsis and indicate immediate treatment.

&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; has the ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance easily, making treatment difficult. Knowledge of the antimicrobial resistance of &quot;S. aureus&quot; is important in the selection of antimicrobials for treatment.

<text>Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, also known as co-amoxiclav or amox-clav, sold under the brand name Augmentin, among others, is an antibiotic medication used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. It is a combination consisting of amoxicillin, a β-lactam antibiotic, and potassium clavulanate, a β-lactamase inhibitor. It is specifically used for otitis media, streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, and animal bites. It can be administered orally or intravenously.
Common side effects include diarrhea, vomiting, and allergic reactions. It also increases the risk of yeast infections, headaches, and blood clotting problems. It is not recommended in people with a history of a penicillin allergy. It is relatively safe for use during pregnancy.
Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was approved for medical use in the United States in 1984. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies amoxicillin/clavulanic-acid as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 96th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is widely used to treat or prevent many infections caused by susceptible bacteria, such as:

* Urinary tract infections
* Respiratory tract infections
* Skin and soft tissue infections
* Sinus infections
* Tonsillitis
* Cat scratches
* Infections caused by the bacterial flora of the mouth, such as:
** Dental infections
** Infected animal bites
** Infected human bites (including uncomplicated &quot;clenched-fist&quot; or &quot;reverse-bite&quot; injuries)
* Treatment-resistant tuberculosis (see below)

===Urinary tract infections===
Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is a second-line therapy in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is active against UTIs caused by &quot;Staphylococcus saprophyticus&quot;, &quot;Enterococci&quot; (e.g., &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot;), &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;, and &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot;. It is a definitive treatment against susceptible extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria. The drug is not effective against &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;Morganella morganii&quot;, or &quot;Providencia stuartii&quot;, nor against AmpC β-lactamase- and ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria or carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). It is not recommended in the empiric treatment of acute pyelonephritis or hospital-acquired UTIs.

As determined by a 2014 literature review of antibiotics for UTIs, respective early clinical cure and early bacterial cure rates were 91% and 91% for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 92% and 87% for nitrofurantoin, 91% and 83% for fosfomycin, 90% and 91% for fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin), and 86% and 81% for β-lactams (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and cefpodoxime). In a large high-quality randomized controlled trial of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for UTI in 370women, early and late clinical cure rates were 79% and 58%, respectively. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid reaches a relatively low urine concentration, which might be involved in its lower effectiveness than other antibiotics.

Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is less effective in the treatment of UTI than first-line therapies used to treat UTIs. A 2012 network meta-analysis of antibiotics for uncomplicated UTIs found that it was less effective than all other assessed agents, including trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and gatifloxacin), and pivmecillinam. However, selection of an empirical antibiotic should be based on local or regional susceptibility data. Additionally, selection of the most appropriate and narrowest effective antibiotic is recommended to help limit increased antibiotic resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Combining amoxicillin/clavulanic acid with aztreonam can further enhance its activity against certain resistant UTI-causing bacteria.

===Tuberculosis===
It is also used for tuberculosis that is resistant to other treatments. The World Health Organization recommends giving amoxicillin-clavulanate along with meropenem as one of the therapeutic options in drug-resistant tuberculosis. However, across the spectrum of dosage of amoxicillin-clavulanate combination, the dose of clavulanate is constant at 125 mg, whereas the dose of amoxicillin varies at 250 mg, 500 mg and 875 mg. Thus the use of low-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate in combination with meropenem may be used in part of a treatment regimen for drug-resistant TB and this has been demonstrated in a clinical setting also. Its efficacy is attributed not to the amoxicillin component, but to the protective action of clavulanic acid over meropenem against beta-lactamase produced by the mycobacteria. Therefore, the minimum dosage of amoxicillin (250 mg) is recommended.

==Adverse effects==
Possible side effects include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, thrush, and skin rash. These do not usually require medical attention. As with all antimicrobial agents, antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection—sometimes leading to pseudomembranous colitis—may occur during or after treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.

Rarely, cholestatic jaundice (also referred to as cholestatic hepatitis, a form of liver toxicity) has been associated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. The reaction may occur up to several weeks after treatment has stopped and usually takes weeks to resolve. It is more frequent in men, older people, and those who have taken long courses of treatment; the estimated overall incidence is one in 100,000 exposures. In the United Kingdom, co-amoxiclav carries a warning from the Committee on Safety of Medicines to this effect.

As all aminopenicillins, amoxicillin has been associated with Stevens–Johnson syndrome / toxic epidermal necrolysis, although these reactions are very rare.

==Pharmacology==
Amoxicillin is an antibiotic while clavulanic acid is a non-antibiotic β-lactamase inhibitor which prevents metabolism of amoxicillin by certain bacteria.

In addition to its β-lactamase inhibition, clavulanic acid shows central nervous system actions and effects and has been studied in the potential treatment of various psychiatric and neurological disorders.

==History==
British scientists working at Beecham (now part of GlaxoSmithKline), filed for patent protection for the drug combination in 1977, which was granted in 1982.

It was sold under the brand name Augmentin.

==Preparations==
Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) and co-amoxiclav is the British Approved Name (BAN).

Many branded products indicate their strengths as the quantity of amoxicillin. Augmentin 250, for example, contains 250 mg of amoxicillin and 125 mg of clavulanic acid.

An intravenous preparation has been available in the UK since 1985, but no parenteral preparation is available in the US; the nearest equivalent is ampicillin/sulbactam.

Suspensions of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid are available for use in children. They must be refrigerated to maintain effectiveness.

==Veterinary use==
Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is used in numerous animals for a variety of conditions:
* Dogs: Skin and soft tissue infections such as wounds, abscesses, cellulitis, superficial/juvenile and deep pyoderma due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: β-lactamase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, non-β-lactamase-producing &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; spp., &quot;Streptococcus&quot; spp., and &quot;E. coli&quot;; and periodontal infections due to susceptible strains of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

* Cats: Skin and soft tissue infections such as wounds, abscesses, and cellulitis/dermatitis due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: β-lactamase-producing &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, non-β-lactamase-producing &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; spp., &quot;Streptococcus&quot; spp., &quot;E. coli&quot;, and &quot;Pasteurella&quot; spp; urinary tract infections (cystitis) due to susceptible strains of &quot;E. coli.&quot;

===Bacterial resistance===
Bacterial antibiotic resistance is a growing problem in veterinary medicine. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is reported to be effective against clinical &quot;Klebsiella&quot; infections, but is not efficacious against &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; infections.

<text>An autofocus (AF) optical system uses a sensor, a control system and a motor to focus on an automatically or manually selected point or area. An electronic rangefinder has a display instead of the motor; the adjustment of the optical system has to be done manually until indication. Autofocus methods are distinguished as active, passive or hybrid types.

Autofocus systems rely on one or more sensors to determine correct focus. Some AF systems rely on a single sensor, while others use an array of sensors. Most modern SLR cameras use through-the-lens optical sensors, with a separate sensor array providing light metering, although the latter can be programmed to prioritize its metering to the same area as one or more of the AF sensors.

Through-the-lens optical autofocusing is usually speedier and more precise than manual focus with an ordinary viewfinder, although more precise manual focus can be achieved with special accessories such as focusing magnifiers. Autofocus accuracy within 1/3 of the depth of field (DOF) at the widest aperture of the lens is common in professional AF SLR cameras.

Most multi-sensor AF cameras allow manual selection of the active sensor, and many offer automatic selection of the sensor using algorithms which attempt to discern the location of the subject. Some AF cameras are able to detect whether the subject is moving towards or away from the camera, including speed and acceleration, and keep focus — a function used mainly in sports and other action photography. Canon cameras call this AI servo; Nikon cameras call it &quot;continuous focus&quot;.

The data collected from AF sensors is used to control an electromechanical system that adjusts the focus of the optical system. A variation of autofocus is an &quot;electronic rangefinder&quot;, in which focus data are provided to the operator, but adjustment of the optical system is still performed manually. 

The speed of the AF system is highly dependent on the widest aperture offered by the lens at the current focal length. F-stops of around 2 to 2.8 are generally considered best for focusing speed and accuracy. Faster lenses than this (e.g.: 1.4 or 1.8) typically have very low depth of field, meaning that it takes longer to achieve correct focus, despite the increased amount of light. Most consumer camera systems will only autofocus reliably with lenses that have a widest aperture of at least 5.6, whilst professional models can often cope with a widest aperture of 8, which is particularly useful for lenses used in conjunction with teleconverters. 

==History==
Between 1960 and 1973, Leitz (Leica) patented an array of autofocus and corresponding sensor technologies. In 1976, Leica had presented a camera based on their previous development at photokina, named Correfot, and in 1978 they displayed an SLR camera with fully operational autofocus. 

The first mass-produced autofocus camera was the Konica C35 AF, a simple point and shoot model released in 1977. The Polaroid SX-70 Sonar OneStep was the first autofocus single-lens reflex camera, released in 1978. 

The Pentax ME-F, which used focus sensors in the camera body coupled with a motorized lens, became the first autofocus 35 mm SLR in 1981. 

In 1983 Nikon released the F3AF, their first autofocus camera, which was based on a similar concept to the ME-F.

The Minolta 7000, released in 1985, was the first SLR with an integrated autofocus system, meaning both the AF sensors and the drive motor were housed in the camera body, as well as an integrated film advance winder — which was to become the standard configuration for SLR cameras from this manufacturer, and also Nikon abandoned their F3AF system and integrated the autofocus-motor and sensors in the body. 

Canon decided to discontinue their FD mount and switched to the completely electronic EF mount with motorised lenses in 1987. 

Pentax was the first to introduce focusing distance measurement for SLR cameras with the FA and FA* series lenses from 1991. Their first KAF-mount Pentax lenses with AF had been introduced in 1989.

In 1992, Nikon changed back to lens integrated motors with their AF-I and AF-S range of lenses; today their entry-level DSLRs do not have a focus motor in the body due to the availability of motors in all new developed AF-Lenses.

==Active==
Active AF systems measure distance to the subject independently of the optical system, and subsequently adjust the optical system for correct focus.

There are various ways to measure distance, including ultrasonic sound waves and infrared light. In the first case, sound waves are emitted from the camera, and by measuring the delay in their reflection, distance to the subject is calculated. Polaroid cameras including the Spectra and SX-70 were known for successfully applying this system. In the latter case, infrared light is usually used to triangulate the distance to the subject. Compact cameras including the Nikon 35TiQD and 28TiQD, the Canon AF35M, and the Contax T2 and T3, as well as early video cameras, used this system. A newer approach included in some consumer electronic devices, like mobile phones, is based on the time-of-flight principle, which involves shining a laser or LED light to the subject and calculating the distance based on the time it takes for the light to travel to the subject and back. This technique is sometimes called &quot;laser autofocus&quot;, and is present in many mobile phone models from several vendors. It is also present in industrial and medical devices.

An exception to the two-step approach is the mechanical autofocus provided in some enlargers, which adjust the lens directly.

==Passive==
Passive AF systems determine correct focus by performing passive analysis of the image that is entering the optical system. They generally do not direct any energy, such as ultrasonic sound or infrared light waves, toward the subject. (However, an autofocus assist beam of usually infrared light is required when there is not enough light to take passive measurements.) Passive autofocusing can be achieved by phase detection or contrast measurement.

===Phase detection===
Phase detection (PD) is achieved by dividing the incoming light into pairs of images and comparing them. Through-the-lens secondary image registration (TTL SIR) passive phase detection is often used in film and digital SLR cameras. The system uses a beam splitter (implemented as a small semi-transparent area of the main reflex mirror, coupled with a small secondary mirror) to direct light to an AF sensor at the bottom of the camera. Two micro-lenses capture the light rays coming from the opposite sides of the lens and divert it to the AF sensor, creating a simple rangefinder with a base within the lens&#x27;s diameter. The two images are then analysed for similar light intensity patterns (peaks and valleys) and the separation error is calculated in order to find whether the object is in front focus or back focus position. This gives the direction and an estimate of the required amount of focus-ring movement.

PD AF in a continuously focusing mode (e.g. &quot;AI Servo&quot; for Canon, &quot;AF-C&quot; for Nikon, Pentax and Sony) is a closed-loop control process. PD AF in a focus-locking mode (e.g. &quot;One-Shot&quot; for Canon, &quot;AF-S&quot; for Nikon and Sony) is widely believed to be a &quot;one measurement, one movement&quot; open-loop control process, but focus is confirmed only when the AF sensor sees an in-focus subject. The only apparent differences between the two modes are that a focus-locking mode halts on focus confirmation, and a continuously focusing mode has predictive elements to work with moving targets, which suggests they are the same closed-loop process.

Although AF sensors are typically one-dimensional photosensitive strips (only a few pixels high and a few dozen wide), some modern cameras (Canon EOS-1V, Canon EOS-1D, Nikon D2X) feature TTL area SIR sensors that are rectangular in shape and provide two-dimensional intensity patterns for a finer-grain analysis. Cross-type focus points have a pair of sensors oriented at 90° to one another, although one sensor typically requires a larger aperture to operate than the other.

Some cameras (Minolta 7, Canon EOS-1V, 1D, 30D/40D, Pentax K-1, Sony DSLR-A700, DSLR-A850, DSLR-A900) also have a few &quot;high-precision&quot; focus points with an additional set of prisms and sensors; they are only active with &quot;fast lenses&quot; with certain geometrical apertures (typically f-number 2.8 and faster). Extended precision comes from the wider effective measurement base of the &quot;range finder&quot;

Some modern sensors (for example one in Librem 5) include about 2% phase detection pixels on the chip. With suitable software support, that enables phase detection auto focus.

===Contrast detection===
Contrast-detection autofocus is achieved by measuring contrast (vision) within a sensor field through the lens. The intensity difference between adjacent pixels of the sensor naturally increases with correct image focus. The optical system can thereby be adjusted until the maximal contrast is detected. In this method, AF does not involve actual distance measurement at all. This creates significant challenges when tracking moving subjects, since a loss of contrast gives no indication of the direction of motion towards or away from the camera.

Contrast-detect autofocus is a common method in digital cameras that lack shutters and reflex mirrors. Most DSLRs use this method (or a hybrid of both contrast and phase-detection autofocus) when focusing in their live-view modes. A notable exception is Canon digital cameras with Dual Pixel CMOS AF. Mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras typically used contrast-measurement autofocus, although phase detection has become the norm on most mirrorless cameras giving them significantly better AF tracking performance compared to contrast detection.

Contrast detection places different constraints on lens design when compared with phase detection. While phase detection requires the lens to move its focus point quickly and directly to a new position, contrast-detection autofocus instead employs lenses that can quickly sweep through the focal range, stopping precisely at the point where maximal contrast is detected. This means that lenses designed for phase detection often perform poorly on camera bodies that use contrast detection.

===Assist lamp===
The assist light (also known as AF illuminator) &quot;activates&quot; passive autofocus systems in low-light and low-contrast situations in some cameras. The lamp projects visible or IR light onto the subject, which the camera&#x27;s autofocus system uses to achieve focus.

Many cameras and nearly all camera phones lack a dedicated autofocus assist lamp. Instead, they use their built-in flash, illuminating the subject with bursts of light. This aids the autofocus system in the same fashion as a dedicated assist light, but has the disadvantage of startling or annoying people. Another disadvantage is that if the camera uses flash focus assist and is set to an operation mode that overrides the flash, it may also disable the focus assist. Thus, autofocus may fail to acquire the subject. 

Similar stroboscopic flashing is sometimes used to reduce the red-eye effect, but this is only intended to constrict the subject&#x27;s eye pupils before the shot.

Some external flash guns have integrated autofocus assist lamps that replace the stroboscopic on-camera flash. Many of them are red and less obtrusive. Another way to assist contrast based AF systems in low light is to beam a laser pattern on to the subject. The laser method is commercially called Hologram AF Laser and was used in Sony CyberShot cameras around the year 2003, including Sony&#x27;s F707, F717 and F828 models.

==Hybrid autofocus==
In a hybrid autofocus system, focus is achieved by combining two or more methods, such as:

* Active and passive methods
* Phase detection and contrast measurement

The double effort is typically used to mutually compensate for the intrinsical weaknesses of the various methods in order to increase the overall reliability and accuracy or to speed up AF function.

A rare example of an early hybrid system is the combination of an active IR or ultrasonic auto-focus system with a passive phase-detection system. An IR or ultrasonic system based on reflection will work regardless of the light conditions, but can be easily fooled by obstacles like window glasses, and the accuracy is typically restricted to a rather limited number of steps. Phase-detection autofocus &quot;sees&quot; through window glasses without problems and is much more accurate, but it does not work in low-light conditions or on surfaces without contrasts or with repeating patterns.

A very common example of combined usage is the phase-detection auto-focus system used in single-lens reflex cameras since the 1985s. The passive phase-detection auto-focus needs some contrast to work with, making it difficult to use in low-light scenarios or on even surfaces. An AF illuminator will illuminate the scene and project contrast patterns onto even surfaces, so that phase-detection auto-focus can work under these conditions as well.

A newer form of a hybrid system is the combination of passive phase-detection auto-focus and passive contrast auto-focus, sometimes assisted by active methods, as both methods need some visible contrast to work with. Under their operational conditions, phase-detection auto-focusing is very fast, since the measurement method provides both information, the amount of offset and the direction, so that the focusing motor can move the lens right into (or close to) focus without additional measurements. Additional measurements on the fly, however, can improve accuracy or help keep track of moving objects. However, the accuracy of phase-detection auto-focus depends on its effective measurement basis. If the measurement basis is large, measurements are very accurate, but can only work with lenses with a large geometrical aperture (e.g. 1:2.8 or larger). Even with high contrasty objects, phase-detection AF cannot work at all with lenses slower than its effective measurement basis. In order to work with most lenses, the effective measurement basis is typically set to between 1:5.6 and 1:6.7, so that AF continues to work with slow lenses (at least for as long as they are not stopped down). This, however, reduces the intrinsical accuracy of the autofocus system, even if fast lenses are used. Since the effective measurement basis is an optical property of the actual implementation, it cannot be changed easily. Very few cameras provide multi-PD-AF systems with several switchable measurement bases depending on the lens used in order to allow normal auto-focusing with most lenses, and more accurate focusing with fast lenses.
Contrast AF does not have this inherent design limitation on accuracy as it only needs a minimal object contrast to work with. Once this is available, it can work with high accuracy regardless of the speed of a lens; in fact, for as long as this condition is met, it can even work with the lens stopped down. Also, since contrast AF continues to work in stopped-down mode rather than only in open-aperture mode, it is immune to aperture-based focus shift errors phase-detection AF systems suffer since they cannot work in stopped-down mode. Thereby, contrast AF makes arbitrary fine-focus adjustments by the user unnecessary. Also, contrast AF is immune to focusing errors due to surfaces with repeating patterns and they can work over the whole frame, not just near the center of the frame, as phase-detection AF does. The down-side, however, is that contrast AF is a closed-loop iterative process of shifting the focus back and forth in rapid succession. Compared to phase-detection AF, contrast AF is slow, since the speed of the focus iteration process is mechanically limited and this measurement method does not provide any directional information. Combining both measurement methods, the phase-detection AF can assist a contrast AF system to be fast and accurate at the same time, to compensate aperture-based focus-shift errors, and to continue to work with lenses stopped down, as, for example, in stopped-down measuring or video mode.

Recent developments towards mirrorless cameras seek to integrate the phase-detection AF sensors into the image sensor itself. Typically, these phase-detection sensors are not as accurate as the more sophisticated stand-alone sensors, but since the fine focusing is now carried out through contrast focusing, the phase-detection AF sensors are only need to provide coarse directional information in order to speed up the contrast auto-focusing process.

In July, 2010, Fujifilm announced a compact camera, the F300EXR, which included a hybrid autofocus system consisting of both phase-detection and contrast-based elements. The sensors implementing the phase-detection AF in this camera are integrated into the camera&#x27;s Super CCD EXR. Currently it is used by Fujifilm FinePix Series, Fujifilm X100S, Ricoh, Nikon 1 series, Canon EOS 650D/Rebel T4i and Samsung NX300.

==Comparison of active and passive systems==
Active systems will typically not focus through windows, since sound waves and infrared light are reflected by the glass. With passive systems this will generally not be a problem, unless the window is stained. Accuracy of active autofocus systems is often considerably less than that of passive systems.

Active systems may also fail to focus a subject that is very close to the camera (e.g., macro photography).

Passive systems may not find focus when the contrast is low, notably on large single-colored surfaces (walls, blue sky, etc.) or in low-light conditions. Passive systems are dependent on a certain degree of illumination to the subject (whether natural or otherwise), while active systems may focus correctly even in total darkness when necessary. Some cameras and external flash units have a special low-level illumination mode (usually orange/red light) which can be activated during auto-focus operation to allow the camera to focus.

==Trap focus==
A method variously referred to as &quot;trap focus&quot;, &quot;focus trap&quot;, or &quot;catch-in-focus&quot; uses autofocus to take a shot when a subject moves into the focal plane (at the relevant focal point); this can be used to get a focused shot of a rapidly moving object, particularly in sports or wildlife photography, or alternatively to set a &quot;trap&quot; so that a shot can automatically be taken without a person present. This is done by using AF to &quot;detect&quot; but not &quot;set&quot; focus – using manual focus to set focus (or switching to manual after focus has been set) but then using &quot;focus priority&quot; to detect focus and only release the shutter when an object is in focus. The technique works by choosing the focus adjustment (turning AF off), then setting the shooting mode to &quot;Single&quot; (AF-S), or more specifically focus priority, then depressing the shutter – when the subject moves into focus, the AF detects this (though it does not change the focus), and a shot is taken.

The first SLR to implement trap focusing was the Yashica 230 AF. Trap focus is also possible on some Pentax (e.g. K-x and K-5), Nikon, and Canon EOS cameras. The EOS 1D can do it using software on an attached computer, whereas cameras like the EOS 40D and 7D have a custom function (III-1 and III-4 respectively) which can stop the camera trying to focus after it fails. On EOS cameras without genuine trap focus, a hack called &quot;almost trap focus&quot; can be used, which achieves some of the effects of trap focus. By using the custom firmware Magic Lantern, some Canon DSLRs can perform trap focus.

===AI Servo===
AI Servo is an autofocus mode found on Canon SLR cameras, and in other brands such as Nikon, Sony, and Pentax, under the name &quot;continuous focus&quot; (AF-C). Also referred to as &quot;focus tracking&quot;, it is used to track a subject as it moves around the frame, or toward and away from the camera. When in use, the lens will constantly maintain its focus on the subject, hence it is commonly used for sports and action photography. AI refers to artificial intelligence: algorithms that constantly predict where a subject is about to be based on its speed and acceleration data from the autofocus sensor.

== Focus motors ==
Modern autofocus is done through one of two mechanisms; either a motor in the camera body and gears in the lens (&quot;screw drive&quot;) or through electronic transmission of the drive instruction through contacts in the mount plate to a motor in the lens. Lens-based motors can be of a number of different types, but are often ultrasonic motors or stepper motors.

Magnets are often used in electromagnetic motors, such as Voice coil motors (VCMs) and Stepper motor, which move the lens elements to achieve precise focusing. The magnetic field interacts with coils to produce motion for adjusting the lens position quickly and accurately based on focus requirements. Magnets are ideal for this purpose because they enable smooth and rapid adjustments without direct physical contact, enhancing durability and response time.

Some camera bodies, including all Canon EOS bodies and the more budget-oriented among Nikon&#x27;s DX models, do not include an autofocus motor and therefore cannot autofocus with lenses that lack an inbuilt motor. Some lenses, such as Pentax&#x27; DA* designated models, although normally using an inbuilt motor, can fall back to screwdrive operation when the camera body does not support the necessary contact pins.

<text>Wealhtheow (also rendered Wealhþēow or Wealthow; ) is a queen of the Danes in the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, first introduced in line 612.
==Character overview==
Wealhtheow is of the Wulfing clan, Queen of the Danes. She is married to Hrothgar (Hrōðgār), the Danish king and is the mother of sons, Hreðric and Hroðmund, and a daughter Freawaru.

In her marriage to Hrothgar she is described as &quot;friðusibb folca&quot; (l. 2017), &#x27;the kindred pledge of peace between peoples&#x27;, signifying interdynastic allegiance between Wulfing and Scylding achieved with her marriage to Hrothgar. She is both &#x27;Lady of the Helmings&#x27; (l. 620) (by descent, of the Wulfing clan of Helm) and &#x27;Lady of the Scyldings&#x27; (l. 1168), by marriage and maternity.

Two northern sources associate the wife of Hrothgar with England. The &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot;, in Arngrímur Jónsson&#x27;s abstract, chapter 3, tells that Hrothgar (&quot;Roas&quot;) married the daughter of an English king. The &quot;Hrolfs saga kraka&quot;, chapter 5, tells that Hrothgar (&quot;Hróarr&quot;) married Ögn who was the daughter of a king of Northumbria (&quot;Norðhymbraland&quot;) called Norðri.

The argument was advanced in 1897 that the Wulfing name may have been synonymous with the East Anglian Wuffing dynasty, and the family name &quot;Helmingas&quot; with the place-names &#x27;Helmingham&#x27; in Norfolk and Suffolk, both of which lie in areas of 5th–6th century migrant occupation. Although the theory was not favoured by some, it has more recently resurfaced in a discussion of the identity of Hroðmund.

== Name ==

The name &quot;Wealhtheow&quot; is unique to &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Like most Old English names, the name &quot;Wealhtheow&quot; is transparently recognisable as a compound of two nouns drawn from everyday vocabulary, in this case (which in early Old English meant &quot;Roman, Celtic-speaker&quot; but whose meaning changed during the Old English period to mean &quot;Briton&quot;, then &quot;enslaved Briton&quot;, and then &quot;slave&quot;) and (whose central meaning was &quot;slave&quot;). Whether this name was thought by the poet(s) or audiences of &quot;Beowulf&quot; to have any literary meaning is disputed. Since it can be translated as &quot;foreigner-slave&quot; or the like, the name &quot;Wealhtheow&quot; has often been thought to indicate that the character Wealhtheow came to marry Hrothgar by being captured from another people. Yet Old English names do not normally seem to have been understood as lexically meaningful compound nouns.

In 1935, E. V. Gordon argued that the form of Wealhtheow&#x27;s name in the &quot;Beowulf&quot;-manuscript reflected scribal corruption and that in the poem as originally composed, the name must have been an Old English form of a Germanic name reconstructable as *&quot;Wala-þewaz&quot; (&quot;chosen servant&quot;), attested in other ancient Germanic languages. In this argument, at the point of &quot;Beowulf&quot;&#x27;s composition, Hrothgar&#x27;s queen was called *&quot;Wælþēo&quot;. Though Gordon&#x27;s argument was accepted by few scholars, it was supported and developed in 2017 by Leonard Neidorf, who saw the putative corruption of the character&#x27;s name to be consistent with the widely accepted view that &quot;Beowulf&quot; originally included characters called &quot;Bēow&quot; and &quot;Unferþ&quot;, despite the manuscript consistently naming them as &quot;Beowulf&quot; and &quot;Hunferþ&quot; respectively: Neidorf argued that a scribe had changed *Wælþēo&#x27;s name because it was unfamiliar to him, substituting the familiar name-element and the later spelling .

==Role in the poem==

Wealhtheow (like Hygd) fulfills the important role of hostess in the poem. The importance of this cup carrying practice is emphasized in lines 1161–1231. Here Wealhtheow, anxious that Hrothgar secures the succession for her own offspring, gives a speech and recompenses Beowulf for slaying Grendel with three horses and a necklace.

The necklace is called &quot;Brosinga mene&quot;, and the name is held to be either a corruption or a misspelling of OE &quot;Breosinga mene&quot;, ON &quot;Brisingamen&quot;, Freyja&#x27;s necklace. Richard North compares the gift of the necklace to &quot;Brosing&quot;, Freyja&#x27;s Brisingamen and he comments that,

:The wider Old Norse-Icelandic tradition attributes the Brisinga men or giroli Brisings (Brisinger&#x27;s girdle c.900) to Freya who is at once the sister of Ingvi-freyr of the Vanir, the leading Norse goddess of love, and a witch with the power to revive the dead. Freya&#x27;s acquisition of this necklace and its theft by Loki are the central incidents in Sorlaþattr.

Wealhtheow has also been examined as a representative of Hrothgar&#x27;s kingdom and prestige and a fundamental component to the functioning of his court. According to Stacy Klein, Wealhtheow wore “elaborate garb” to demonstrate the “wealth and power” of the kingdom. As queen, Wealhtheow represents the “female&#x27;s duty to maintain peace between two warring tribes” and to “signify the status of the court.” While her position may appear ritualistic, she also maintains “the cohesiveness of the unity of the warriors.” The role of queens in the early Germania was to foster “social harmony through active diplomacy and conciliation.” Wealhtheow inhabits this role by constantly speaking to each of the men in her hall and reminding them of their obligations – obligations to their country, their family, or their king.

In a grimly ironic passage that would not be lost on the Anglo-Saxon audience of &quot;Beowulf&quot; Wealhtheow commends her sons to Hroðulf&#x27;s generosity and protection, not suspecting that he will murder her sons to claim the throne for himself.

All the qualities marking Wealhtheow as an ideal queen place her in contrast to Grendel&#x27;s mother, who appears for the first time following a lengthy passage concerned with Wealhtheow and her sons. The contrast between Wealhtheow and Grendel&#x27;s mother echoes the parallels between Beowulf, Hrothgar, and Grendel.

<text>The Archie Show (also known as &quot;The Archies)&quot; is an American musical animated sitcom television series produced by Filmation for CBS. Based on the Archie Comics, created by Bob Montana in 1941, &quot;The Archie Show&quot; aired Saturday mornings on CBS from September 1968 to 1969. The show featured the main characters in the &quot;Archie&quot; series, including Archie Andrews, Jughead Jones, Reggie Mantle, Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge.

In 1969, the show was expanded to an hour and retitled The Archie Comedy Hour, which included a half-hour featuring Sabrina the Teenage Witch. In 1970, the show became Archie&#x27;s Funhouse, and featured live-action segments. After three seasons, &quot;The Archie Show&quot; stopped airing on CBS in 1971.

Filmation continued to produce further &quot;Archie&quot; television series until 1978, including &quot;Archie&#x27;s TV Funnies&quot; (1971–1973), &quot;The U.S. of Archie&quot; (1974–1976) and &quot;The New Archie and Sabrina Hour&quot; (1977–1978).

==Premise==
A typical episode would include two eight-minute stories, a &quot;Dance of the Week&quot; segment, a three-minute musical segment, and a Jughead joke segment. The show was targeted to both kids and young teenagers.

=== Characters ===
The main characters of the show are 17-year-old vocalist/rhythm guitarist Archie Andrews and his teen-age pals from Riverdale High School, including his best friend and food fiend drummer Jughead Jones; wise-cracking bassist Reggie Mantle; attractive, blonde, girl-next-door tomboy vocalist/lead guitarist/percussionist Betty Cooper; beautiful, spoiled-rich girl vocalist/keyboardist Veronica Lodge; and Jughead&#x27;s English sheepdog Hot Dog. On the show, the friends appeared as a bubblegum pop band featuring Archie on lead guitar. Other characters in the show included Mr. Weatherbee, Miss Grundy, Dilton Doiley, Moose Mason, Pop Tate, Mr. Lodge, and Coach Kleats.

== Cast ==
*Dallas McKennon – Archie Andrews, Hot Dog, Mr. Weatherbee, Pop Tate, Mr. Lodge, Coach Kleats
**Ron Dante – Archie Andrews (singing voice)
*Jane Webb – Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge, Miss Grundy, Big Ethel
**Toni Wine – Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge (singing voice)
*John Erwin – Reggie Mantle
*Howard Morris – Moose Mason, Jughead Jones, Dilton Doiley
*Don Messick – Jughead Jones, Hot Dog (&quot;Beauty Is Only Fur Deep&quot;)

==Episodes==
==Production==

=== Development ===
In 1967, Irv Wilson, Filmation&#x27;s agent at the time, approached John Goldwater about licensing his comics. Lou Schiemer, founder of Filmation, received a call from Wilson on having the rights to Archie Comics. He replied to his response, &quot;What the hell is &quot;Archie&quot;? Is it something kids know?&quot; Shortly, he flew out to meet John Goldwater and created a deal. The concept of the show was presented to CBS daytime programming executive, Fred Silverman, with several comic books. It was considered to be one of the cheapest and successful presentations Filmation has ever made. At the time, CBS immediately liked it due to an amount of cartoons, mostly Hanna-Barbera action cartoons, being protested by parent-run organizations, including Action for Children&#x27;s Television (ACT), and it was bought. Filmation also immediately conceived an idea of making music an essential part of the show&#x27;s concept.

In 1968, Norm Prescott called Don Kirshner to create music for The Archies. Kirshner happily accepted it, creating a music deal with the band.

Filmation took every aspect from the comics for the concept of the show. The main characters&#x27; tone was done for children to relate to the characters. Hot Dog was also immediately created for the show.

=== Voice cast ===
Most of the voice cast involved have worked on Filmation shows. The main voice cast included Dallas McKennon, John Erwin, Jane Webb, and Howard Morris. Don Messick was also part of the show, temporarily replacing Howard Morris for the episode &quot;Beauty Is Only Fur Deep&quot;.

Filmation tried to find the voice cast for the 1940s radio show &quot;Archie Andrews&quot;, but was flopped. According to Lou Schiemer, it was thought to be John Erwin&#x27;s first Filmation work he ever voiced.

=== Writing ===
The team of writers consisted of Bob Ogle, Chuck Menville, Len Janson, Jim Ryan, Bill Danch, and others. None of the writers involved were writers of the Archie Comics. The writing involved the concepts of dancing, singing, dating, high school, and youth problems for its appeal to young teenagers.

===Music===
The franchise&#x27;s most notable effort was the music element in the form of the animated band The Archies. &quot;The Archie Show&quot; was designed to emulate the live-action series &quot;The Monkees&quot; by including rock music into each episode. All of the music included in the show were not specific to the plot of the stories.

For the process of the songs, Filmation&#x27;s staff told Kirshner what they wanted to work, what the attitude should be, and what they were writing on the stories. Kirshner would work on the dance of the weeks and songs, and deliver them as a whole to the studio. Norm Prescott handled all of the music with Kirshner.

With vocals provided by Ron Dante and Toni Wine, the fictional group released a series of real-life albums and singles. Their most successful song is &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot;, which stood at the top of the pop charts for four weeks in 1969. &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; became the No. 1 song of 1969 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and as of 1969, it reportedly sold six million copies worldwide.

== Release ==

=== Original broadcast ===
&quot;The Archie Show&quot; debuted its first episode on September 14, 1968, on CBS at the 10 a.m. (EST) timeslot, competing with reruns of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. It was lead-in to another new Saturday-morning cartoon that was also Filmation&#x27;s, &quot;The Batman/Superman Hour&quot;. The show was a commercial success; it regularly had a 47 Nielsen rating in the 2-11 age group. It was the most successful Saturday-morning cartoon at the time.

=== Syndication ===
Most of the episodes from all of the series produced by Filmation were syndicated in 1976 as &quot;The Archies&quot; (excluding material produced for &quot;The New Archie and Sabrina Hour&quot;, which did not debut until a year later). The music segments from &quot;The Archie Comedy Hour&quot; were missing in this syndication package, for unknown reasons.

&quot;The New Archie and Sabrina Hour&quot; was later repeated in syndication, and on The Family Channel in a half-hour format as &quot;The Archie and Sabrina Surprise Package&quot;; this is the version offered by Universal Television, the current rightsholder for most Filmation programs, including the Archies franchise; a previous rightsholder, Entertainment Rights, was acquired by Classic Media in 2009, followed by DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s purchase of Classic Media in 2012. Currently, Universal Pictures owns the rights to most Filmation programs, including the Archies franchise, since its purchase in 2016.

From 2010 until 2015, the show aired on Retro Television Network.

==Critical reception==
Hal Erickson, author of &quot;Television Cartoon Shows, An Illustrated Encyclopedia&quot; described &quot;The Archie Show&quot; as &quot;not what one could call inspired.&quot; Erickson criticized the humor that was described as &quot;executed in a fragmented fashion&quot; and &quot;made doubly obvious by the overuse of a canned laugh track.&quot;

== Legacy ==
&quot;The Archie Show&quot; utilized a laugh track, the first such example of the colloquially-titled Saturday morning cartoons. Owing to the success of &quot;The Archie Show&quot;, most animated series would begin using laugh tracks until the early 1980s. Previous animated series that used laugh tracks, such as &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, were broadcast during prime time with the target audience being adults.

==Home media==
Various VHS, Betamax, and laserdisc releases distributed by companies such as New Age Video, Inc. and Embassy Home Entertainment were released in several countries throughout the late &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s. Four volumes of &quot;The Archie Show&quot; were released in the early and mid &#x27;80s by Thorn EMI Video (later Thorn/EMI HBO Video in the release of its fourth volume) as part of its &quot;Children&#x27;s Maintee&quot; line of animated shows. Each volume consists three full episodes with some of the other segments intact. All transfers were from unrestored 16mm masters.

Single-disc DVD compilations featuring four episodes each were released in 2004. Video transfers were NTSC-based with restored quality. There were four volumes in all.

&quot;Hero High&quot; (1981) was planned to be part of &quot;The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!&quot; featuring Archie and the gang as superheroes; however, this series was altered at the last minute because Filmation&#x27;s rights to the &quot;Archie&quot; characters had expired during production and was not renewed.

<doc id="995707" wikidata="Q8035254" url="?curid=995707" title="World's View, Nyanga">
<text>World&#x27;s View is a spectacular vista on the escarpment of the Nyanga Downs plateau in the Eastern Highlands mountain range, just north of Nyanga, in eastern Zimbabwe. It is situated at an altitude of with a drop to the plain below on the western side. 

== Description ==
A tower at the viewpoint bears a toposcope on which the direction and distance to thirty African localities are inscribed on slabs of black granite. A site office stands nearby with a small gallery, built in 2012 to house pictures of the flowers of Nyanga by local artist Mary Clark and a display on the history of the development of the viewpoint. The Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden in Cape Town, South Africa, has contributed plants for a protea and wild flower garden created in a rocky kopje adjoining the gallery.

The National Trust of Zimbabwe manages the World&#x27;s View site, which covers an area of about 70 hectares. Although the viewpoint itself is of modern origins, having been developed in the 1950s, the site was occupied as long ago as the 14th and 15th centuries. Some of the peaks along the edge of the escarpment, from World&#x27;s View to Chirimanyimo Hill, are crowned by large stonewalled settlements at altitudes of over 2,000 metres. They were probably the site of villages and would have been built during a cooler and drier climatic period, when the mountains were less persistently misty than they are today.

== Access ==
The viewpoint is just outside the northern edge of the Nyanga National Park and can be reached via an 11 km track from Troutbeck. On a clear day, places as far away as 60 to 70 km can be seen.

<doc id="995711" wikidata="Q6969017" url="?curid=995711" title="Nathan Dane">
<text>Nathan Dane (December 29, 1752 – February 15, 1835) was an American lawyer and statesman who represented Massachusetts in the Continental Congress from 1785 through 1788. Dane helped formulate the Northwest Ordinance while in Congress, and introduced an amendment to the ordinance prohibiting slavery in the Northwest Territory.

During his career, he served in both the Massachusetts House of Representatives and the Massachusetts Senate. He also wrote a multi-volume treatise that covered the entire subject of American law, which enabled him to help fund the development of Harvard Law School.

==Early life and education==
Dane was born at Ipswich in Essex County, Massachusetts. His father Daniel Dane was a farmer, and his mother&#x27;s name was Abigail. Ancestor John Dane Sr. had immigrated to Massachusetts from England (not Denmark) in 1636.

Dane worked on the family farm in Ipswich until he turned twenty. Moving on to college at Harvard, his major interest was in mathematics, and he graduated in 1778. Then he taught school and read for the law. In 1779 he married Mary Brown (they would have no children).

Dane was admitted to the bar and set up a legal practice in Beverly in 1782. That same year, he entered elective office in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, where he served until 1785. Dane&#x27;s hearing was poor throughout his career, and steadily got worse.

==Continental Congress==
In 1785, Dane became a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress, where he helped draft the Northwest Ordinance, which was enacted on July 13, 1787. The Ordinance encouraged American settlers into the Northwest Territory and formed the basis of the constitutions of the five states there: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin. The Ordinance also banned slavery in the Northwest Territory. Dane&#x27;s amendment banning slavery was offered at the last minute, and was quickly accepted without much discussion, to the surprise of Dane himself, who &quot;had no idea the States would agree to the sixth article, prohibiting slavery...&quot;

In February 1787, Dane proposed a resolution authorizing the Philadelphia Convention to amend the Articles of Confederation, and that resolution was adopted. Out of that Philadelphia Convention came the proposed United States Constitution. But Dane had reservations about supporting its ratification. In July 1788, he finally wrote a pivotal letter of support to Melancton Smith of New York. Dane said that he feared violence and social upheaval if the Constitution were not ratified, and he supported ratification with the understanding that there would be later amendments, which eventually came to be known as the United States Bill of Rights.

==Later career==
Dane was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate in 1788 and 1790. He was later elected to the Massachusetts State Senate from 1790 to 1791 and again from 1794 to 1797. In 1794 he served on a commission that reviewed and codified the laws of Massachusetts.

Later, while practicing law, he remained an active reformer, on behalf of vocational education and humane treatment of prisoners. He also helped establish the American Temperance Society to discourage use and abuse of alcoholic beverages.

He was a member of the Federalist Party and its Essex Junto. The Massachusetts legislature appointed him as a delegate to the Hartford Convention during the War of 1812, which damaged his reputation, although Dane saw himself as a voice of moderation at the Convention and maintained that he did not have any secessionist intentions: &quot;Someone must go to prevent mischief,&quot; he said.

Dane was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1816.

===&quot;Father of American Jurisprudence&quot;===
By 1820, Dane was almost totally deaf, but he continued working long hours in his library, writing two major legal treatises. The first of these was published in 1823, titled &quot;A General Abridgement and Digest of American Law&quot;. Its eight volumes were supplemented by a ninth in 1829. The &quot;Abridgment&quot; was 
very successful, and was the &quot;first systematic treatise covering the entire field of American law.&quot; It became a standard work, and every lawyer of distinction bought a copy.

Dane used the substantial proceeds from the &quot;Abridgement&quot; to provide an endowment for a law school at Harvard University, specifying that the first Dane Professorship of Law would go to his old friend Joseph Story. For a while, Harvard Law School was called &quot;Dane Law School.&quot;

On account of the &quot;Abridgement&quot; and his generosity to the law school at Harvard, together with his co-authorship of the Northwest Ordinance, Dane has been called the &quot;Father of American Jurisprudence.&quot; The &quot;Abridgment&quot; was often cited in later years; for example, when abolitionist Wendell Phillips argued against abolitionist Lysander Spooner&#x27;s notion that judges have an obligation to disregard any law that the judges deem wrong, Philips cited the following legal maxim in which Dane assigned that obligation to legislators instead of judges:

Municipal or civil law ... is the rule of municipal or civil conduct, prescribed by the superior power in the state commanding what the legislature deems right, and prohibiting what it deems wrong.
Dane&#x27;s other treatise was titled a &quot;Moral and Political Survey of America&quot;. It has been described as &quot;arguably the first broad-based national history from English and Spanish colonization through the War of Independence&quot;.
==Death and posthumous honors==
Dane died at home in Beverly and was buried in the Central Cemetery there. Dane Street in Beverly borders the cemetery. Dane County, Wisconsin, which was formed in 1836, was named in his honor. Within Dane County, there is a Town of Dane, and within the Town of Dane is a village called Dane, Wisconsin.

In 2015 Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker and Beverly Mayor Michael P. Cahill, in accordance with the anniversary of the passage of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, declared July 13–19 &quot;Nathan Dane Week&quot; in the state of Massachusetts and the City of Beverly, Massachusetts. The effort was spearheaded by Lance Daly, founder of the Beverly Heritage Project, &quot;whose coordinated effort resulted in official proclamations from five state governors, eight historical societies from six states and a smattering of representatives calling for their states to honor Nathan Dane&#x27;s impact on history.&quot; In honor of &quot;Nathan Dane Week,&quot; Indiana Governor Mike Pence issued a proclamation making Dane an honorary Hoosier.

<doc id="995719" wikidata="Q5000944" url="?curid=995719" title="Burton process">
<text>The Burton process is a thermal cracking process invented by William Merriam Burton and Robert E. Humphreys, both of whom held a PhD in chemistry from Johns Hopkins University. The process they developed is commonly referred to as the Burton process. However, it should be recognized as the Burton-Humphreys process, as both individuals played pivotal roles in its development. The legal dispute surrounding this matter was eventually settled, although the decision primarily recognized Burton&#x27;s contributions.

The process involves the destructive distillation of crude oil, which is heated under pressure in a still. The innovative design of this still allows various products to emerge from a bubble tower at different temperatures and pressures. One crucial aspect of the process is that it significantly increased gasoline production from various types of oil, more than doubling the output. The first large-scale implementation of these towers occurred when Standard Oil of Indiana made the decision to construct 120 stills using an authorized budget of $709,000 in 1911. Notably, this decision coincided with the US Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling to dissolve the Standard Oil Trust.

This thermal cracking process was patented on January 7, 1913 (Patent No. 1,049,667). The first thermal cracking method, the Shukhov cracking process, was invented by Vladimir Shukhov (Patent of Russian Empire No. 12926 on November 27, 1891). While the Russians contended that the Burton process was essentially a slight modification of the Shukhov process, Americans refused to concede and the Burton-Humphreys patent remained in use. Ultimately, it contributed to the development of petrochemicals.

In 1937 the Burton process was superseded by catalytic cracking, but it is still in use today to produce diesel.

<text>Battle Mountain is an igneous mountain in Rappahannock County, Virginia. The eastern slope is generally considered to reside in the unincorporated town of Amissville, Virginia while the western slope is generally considered to be within Castleton, Virginia. The entire mountain including the summit lies within private property at an elevation of 1,162 ft (354.2 m).

==Geology==
===Tectonic emplacement and geochronology===
It is an extinct volcano dating to the Neoproterozoic and is approximately 704 million years old (+/- 4 million years) as dated using the U-Pb zircon crystal geochronology method. It is a unit of the Robertson River Igneous Suite and is located within the Blue Ridge anticlinorium. This volcanic formation was a result of crustal extensional rifting of the eastern Laurentian margin of the supercontinent Rodinia. This was the beginning of a chain of events that ultimately gave birth to the precursor Atlantic, the Iapetus Ocean at 550 Ma during the Ediacaran–Cambrian transition.

===Geochemical evolution===

The volcano is composed of alkali feldspar granitic rock of the Robertson River Igneous Suite. This includes felsic complex material such as biotite, hornblende-biotite, magnetite, and alkali granitic rock including rhyolite on the eastern slopes of Battle Mountain and the adjacent (and geologically related) Little Battle Mountain (elevation 937 feet).



===Palaeogeographic reconstruction===
A unique geological feature of Battle Mountain is that the western slope outcrops are composed entirely of alkali feldspar granite, while the eastern slope up to and including the summit is entirely rhyolitic. This provides strong evidence of a theorized lateral explosive eruption event centered on the eastern slope at approximately 704 Ma as proposed by Woolman (2016). Further mathematical geology evidence which supports this theory includes a palaeogeographic reconstruction of the mountain by Woolman utilizing artificial neural networks and Markov chain geostatistical models including period climate condition-based soil erosion rates, Kirkby&#x27;s hillslope movement evolution equations and recursive biogeochemical soil erosion rates in felsic granitic conditions. The result was the digital reconstruction image shown on the left, indicating what Battle Mountain may have looked like 704 million years ago on the western slope.

===Only known volcanic mountains in Rappahannock County, VA===
Battle Mountain and Little Battle Mountain are the only mountains in Rappahannock County which are known to be volcanic in origin, and are among the oldest visibly intact extinct volcanoes in Virginia. White quartz boulders and smaller fragments are common on and around Battle Mountain, a result of molten silica that was contained in the rhyolite lava and granitic magma that formed the volcano. As quartz is extremely hard relative to feldspar granite and rhyolite, it tends to remain present on the surface while the softer granite it was embedded in wears away into the soil.

==Access==
The nearest unincorporated town is Amissville, Virginia at approximately 4 miles away. Access to the mountain and the summit must be negotiated with local landowners first as the mountain, including all portions of the July 1863 battlefield exists entirely on private property.

==Agriculture==
The various slopes of Battle Mountain are in either commercial timber (primarily mixed hardwoods), cattle pasture (western slope) or crops (corn, hay and pumpkins as of 2019). Battle Mountain Farm, which comprises the majority of the eastern slope of Battle Mountain is a mixed hardwood timber and small-scale commercial pumpkin grower, specializing in large jack-o-lantern pumpkins. Their pumpkins are grown without herbicides or pesticides in multiple commercial-scale 60-foot by 5-foot ecologically sustainable raised beds (no soil tilling required) using locally produced natural fertilizers. The beds also utilize water-conserving polymer mulch and irrigation drip lines attached to on-site wells approximately 300 feet deep, providing mineral-rich water from volcanic aquifers. The well water pressure is provided by a 10.4 kilowatt grid-tied solar panel array on the farm, with lead-acid battery backup.

<doc id="995724" wikidata="Q938656" url="?curid=995724" title="One (Metallica song)">
<text>&quot;One&quot; is a song by American heavy metal band Metallica, released as the third and final single from the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; (1988). Written by band members James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, the song portrays a World War I soldier who is severely wounded—arms, legs and jaw blown off by a landmine, blind, deaf, and unable to speak or move—begging God to take his life. In the music video, attempting to communicate with the hospital staff he jolts in his bed, spelling SOS in Morse code. Production of the song was done by the band alongside Flemming Rasmussen. The song was the band&#x27;s first to chart in the U.S., reaching number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was also a number one hit in Finland.

A video for the song was introduced in January 1989 on MTV. Shot in black and white by director Michael Salomon, the video&#x27;s story is intercut with scenes taken from the 1971 anti-war film &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot;. Due to routinely being required to pay royalty fees to continue showing the music video, Metallica bought the rights to the film. The video was ranked at number one on MTV soon after its introduction.

Metallica performed &quot;One&quot; for the 31st Annual Grammy Awards show broadcast from Los Angeles in 1989. The next year, the song won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, the first ever to win in that category. The band also performed the song alongside pianist Lang Lang at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in 2014. The song is one of the band&#x27;s most popular pieces and has remained a staple at live shows since the release of the album, and is the most performed song from &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;. In March 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;One&quot; at number 11 on their &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Songs of All Time&quot; list.

==Recording and composition==
&quot;One&quot; was written in November 1987 by Metallica&#x27;s principal composers James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich. The song was released in 1988 as the third and final single of the album. For the first 20 seconds of the song there are a series of sound effects with a battle theme, an artillery barrage and helicopter are heard and continues slightly over a clean tone guitar intro by Hetfield before Kirk Hammett comes in over the top with a clean-toned solo. Ulrich&#x27;s drums come in and continues until each chorus, when the guitars become heavy and distorted before returning to clean. There is a second solo by Hammett halfway through the song, before lyrics cut out and the song gradually gets more heavy and distorted until the &quot;machine gun&quot; guitar build up (played alongside double bass drums) before the next, often highly praised, guitar solo by Hammett, and a final dual solo by Hammett and Hetfield. The song begins in time, and later as well as .

In 1991, James Hetfield told &quot;Guitar World&quot; that he wrote the song&#x27;s opening Bm-G chord change based on an idea prompted by the Venom song &quot;Buried Alive&quot; from their second studio album, &quot;Black Metal&quot;.

The song starts off in a soft melodic setting, but it develops through multiple sections into heavier and faster speed metal sounds, leading up to a tapping solo by Kirk Hammett, and a dual guitar section by Hammett and James Hetfield.

==Concept==
The song is based on the idea of a soldier losing all of his limbs and jaw and being unable to hear, speak, or see, set during the Vietnam War. In an interview in New Zealand in 1989, Ulrich describes the 1971 film &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; (based on the 1939 book &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; by Dalton Trumbo, who also directed the 1971 film) as having a similar theme, and this was the reason it was incorporated into the video.

==Music video==
&quot;One&quot; was the first Metallica song for which a music video was created. The music video, directed by Bill Pope and Michael Salomon, debuted on MTV on January 20, 1989. The video, shot in Long Beach, California on December 7, 1988, is almost entirely in black and white, and features the band performing the song in a warehouse. It features dialogue and several scenes from the 1971 film adaptation of &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot;. Timothy Bottoms can be seen starring as Joe Bonham, the main character in the novel (written by Dalton Trumbo and published in September 1939; the basis for the 1971 film).

Three versions of the &quot;One&quot; music video were made; the first (the longest, album version) contained scenes of both the band and scenes from the movie. The second was simply a shortened version of the first, and the third, often known as the &quot;jammin&#x27; version&quot;, lacked scenes from the movie (the song and video fades at the last bridge in the third version).

Like many other music videos from Metallica, &quot;One&quot; puts great emphasis on the performances of the band members as musicians, with many shots of Hetfield, Jason Newsted and Hammett&#x27;s hands picking and fretting. The video features the band members in a typical early Metallica fashion: playing (as if in rehearsal) in some sort of warehouse, in tight formation around Lars Ulrich&#x27;s drum kit, and dressed in casual street clothes and with long untamed hair.

In the music video, both Hetfield and Hammett play ESP guitars; Newsted is on a 5-string Wal bass. Newsted plays bass with his fingers at the start of the song, and later switches to a pick.

Two of the three versions of the &quot;One&quot; music video appear on &quot;2 of One&quot;, a VHS released on July 1, 1990, and both would again be featured on the band&#x27;s 2006 music video compilation DVD. 

The music video was ranked at number 38 on &quot;Rock on the Net: MTV: 100 Greatest Music Videos&quot; and number one on Fuse&#x27;s &quot;No. 1 Countdown: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Special Edition&quot;. As of January 2025, the video has over 340 million views on YouTube.

==Live performance==
&quot;One&quot; is a fixture of the band&#x27;s live performances. When played live, the song is usually played with guitars tuned down by one semitone (E-flat tuning would remain a permanent fixture of their live work since 1995) and is preceded by pyrotechnics and the same sounds of war such as machine guns, and bombs exploding as heard on the recorded version. The song also features heavy strobe lighting during the heavier half of the song, namely before the Hammett solo.

The song was also featured on &quot;S&amp;M and S&amp;M2&quot;, Metallica&#x27;s albums of live performances in collaboration with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Michael Kamen, and Michael Tilson Thomas respectively. Another notable performance was at the Grammy Awards 2014, when pianist Lang Lang accompanied the band on an acoustic grand piano.

<text>Beowulf (; ) is a legendary Geatish hero in the eponymous epic poem, one of the oldest surviving pieces of English literature.

==Etymology and origins of the character==
A number of origins have been proposed for the name &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

===Beowulf===
Henry Sweet, a philologist and linguist specializing in Germanic languages, proposed that the name &quot;Bēowulf&quot; literally means in Old English &quot;bee-wolf&quot; or &quot;bee-hunter&quot; and that it is a kenning for &quot;bear&quot;. Recorded instances of similar names mirror this etymology. The 1031 AD &quot;Liber Vitae&quot; records the name &quot;Biuuuwulf&quot;. The name is attested to a monk from Durham and means &quot;bee wolf&quot; in the Old Northumbrian dialect. The 11th century English &quot;Domesday Book&quot; contains a recorded instance of the name &quot;Beulf&quot;. The scholar suggested that the name &quot;Beowulf&quot; derived from a mistranslation of &quot;Böðvarr&quot; with -&quot;varr&quot; interpreted as &quot;vargr&quot; meaning &quot;wolf&quot;.
However, Sophus Bugge questioned this etymology, and instead suggested that the personage Böðvarr Bjarki derived from Beowulf.

===Beow-Wolf===
In 2005, Andy Orchard theorized an etymology on the basis of the common Old Norse name &quot;Þórólfr&quot; (which literally translates to &quot;Thor Wolf&quot;), stating in parallel that a &quot;more likely&quot; meaning for the name would be the &quot;wolf&quot; of the Germanic god Beow.

===Biewolf===
English philologist Walter William Skeat proposed an etymological origin in a term for &quot;Woodpecker&quot; citing the Old Dutch term &quot;biewolf&quot; for the bird. Skeat states that the black woodpecker is common in Norway and Sweden and further reasons that the &quot;indominatable nature&quot; and that the &quot;bird fights to the death&quot; might have influenced the choice of the name. This etymological origin has been criticized as not being in accordance to Grimm&#x27;s law and Skeat may have recanted the proposal at a later date.

===Beado-Wulf (war wolf)===
The editors of Bosworth&#x27;s monumental dictionary of Anglo-Saxon propose that Beowulf is a variant of &quot;beado-wulf&quot; meaning &quot;war wolf&quot; and that it is cognate with the Icelandic &quot;Bodulfr&quot; which also means &quot;war wolf&quot;.

===Beowulf before &quot;Beowulf&quot;===
Scholars have long debated the origins of the character Beowulf. Some have argued that Beowulf existed in heroic-legendary tradition prior to the composition of &quot;Beowulf,&quot; while others have believed that the &quot;Beowulf&quot; poet invented his Geatish protagonist. Leonard Neidorf has argued that Beowulf was present in (now lost) heroic-legendary cycles before &quot;Beowulf&quot; was composed. Neidorf argued that the seventh-century usage of the name ‘Biuuulf’ (Beowulf), which involves an element (Beow) that was unproductive in contemporary name-giving, suggests that legends of Beowulf existed well before the composition of our extant poem.

==Beowulf manuscript==
===Origins in Geatland===
As told in the surviving epic poem, Beowulf was the son of Ecgþeow, a warrior of the Swedish Wægmundings. Ecgþeow had slain Heaðolaf, a man from another clan (named the Wulfings) (according to Scandinavian sources, they were the ruling dynasty of the Geatish petty kingdom of Östergötland). Apparently, because the victim was from a prominent family, the &quot;weregild&quot; was set too high, and so Ecgþeow was banished and had to seek refuge among the Danes. The Danish king Hroðgar generously paid the &quot;weregild&quot;, and had Ecgþeow swear an oath.

Ecgþeow was in the service of the Geatish king Hreðel, whose daughter he married. They had Beowulf, who grew up with the Geats. Beowulf&#x27;s childhood friend was Breca the Bronding &quot;supposed to be the inhabitants of the island Brännö, lying off the coast of West Gothland in the Cattegat&quot;. This would be a realistic location for a childhood friend of Beowulf, and the poem describes a swimming contest between them.

===Zealand and Grendel===
When King Hroðgar, his wife Wealhþeow, and his court were terrorized by the monstrous Grendel, Beowulf left Geatland (West Götaland) and sailed to Zealand with fourteen warriors in order to pay his father&#x27;s debt. During the night, Grendel arrived to attack the sleeping men and devoured one of the other Geats before seizing Beowulf. As no manmade weapon could harm Grendel, Beowulf fought back with his bare hands and tore off the beast&#x27;s arm. Grendel fled back to the bog to die from his wound, and his arm was attached to the wall of Heorot. The next day, Beowulf was lauded and a skald (scop) sang and compared Beowulf with the hero Sigmund.

However, during the following night Grendel&#x27;s mother arrived to avenge her son&#x27;s death and collect &quot;weregild&quot;. As Beowulf slept in a different building he could not stop her. He resolved to descend into the bog in order to kill her. They fought beside Grendel&#x27;s corpse, and Beowulf finally won with the aid of an enchanted giant sword stolen from the lair&#x27;s plundered wooden box.

===Return to Geatland, kingdom, and death===

Having returned to Geatland, Beowulf is described as taking part in a raid (a genuine historic event) against the Franks with his king Higlac. Higlac died during the raid, and Beowulf swam home in full armour. Back in Geatland, queen Hygd offered Beowulf the throne but Beowulf declined in favour of the young prince Heardred. However, Heardred received two Swedish princes, Eadgils and Eanmund who reported that they had fled their uncle Onela who had usurped the Swedish throne. This led to a Swedish invasion in which Heardred was killed. Beowulf was proclaimed king and decided to avenge Heardred and to help Eadgils become king of Sweden.

The event when Onela was slain was probably a historic event. Even though it is only briefly mentioned in Beowulf, it occurs extensively in several Scandinavian sources where it is called the &quot;Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern&quot;. For example, Snorri Sturluson wrote: &quot;Onela rode Raven, as they rode to the ice, but a second one, a grey one, hastened, wounded by spears, eastwards under Eadgils.&quot; [...] &quot;In this fight Onela died and a great many of his people. Then king Eadgils took from him his helmet Battle-boar and his horse Raven.&quot; (Although, in Snorri&#x27;s text the names are in their corresponding Old Norse forms).

Beowulf ruled the Geats for 50 years, until his realm was terrorized by a fire-breathing dragon after a thief stole a golden cup from its hoard of treasure. After unsuccessfully attacking the dragon with his &quot;thegns&quot;, Beowulf decided to pursue the monster into its lair at Earnanæs, but only his young Swedish relative Wiglaf dared join him. Beowulf&#x27;s sword broke, but he dealt the dragon its death-blow with his dagger. He had been mortally wounded by the dragon&#x27;s poisonous bite. Dying, he was carried out by Wiglaf, and with his last breaths named Wiglaf his rightful heir. His body was burned on a funeral pyre, and his ashes buried in a barrow by the sea.

The last three lines of the poem are, in Seamus Heaney&#x27;s translation:
&lt;poem&gt;:They [the Geats] said that of all the kings upon the earth,
:he was the man most gracious and fair-minded,
:kindest to his people and keenest to win fame.
&lt;/poem&gt;
The statement is clear, except for the final word, &quot;lof-geornest&quot; (&#x27;keenest to seek fame&#x27;), which is two-edged. It is no shame for a hero to seek fame, but it may be possible to be too eager for it.

<doc id="995733" wikidata="Q2082941" url="?curid=995733" title="Gnosall">
<text>Gnosall () is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Stafford, Staffordshire, England, with a population of 4,736 across 2,048 households (2011 census). It lies on the A518, approximately halfway between the towns of Newport (in Shropshire) and the county town of Staffordshire, Stafford. Gnosall Heath lies immediately south-west of the main village, joined by Station Road and separated by Doley Brook. Other nearby villages include Woodseaves, Knightley, Cowley, Ranton, Church Eaton, Bromstead Heath, Moreton, and Haughton.

== History ==
The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book, in which it was named &quot;Geneshale&quot;. It is listed there as having a population of 12 households. According to research presented online by the University of Nottingham, the name &quot;Gnosall&quot; derives from a combination of the Old Welsh &quot;Genou&quot; meaning &#x27;mouth&#x27; and the Mercian word &quot;halh&quot; meaning &#x27;a nook of land&#x27; or &#x27;a small valley&#x27; or &#x27;dry ground in marsh.&#x27; The Gnosall Parish Council also believes that &quot;Gnosall&quot; derives from both &quot;Genou&quot; and &quot;halh,&quot; however believes that &quot;halh&quot; actually stands for &#x27;low-lying land by a river&#x27; and states that &quot;Gnosall&quot; translates to a ‘narrow valley that suddenly opens out into a wider one’. That same site also states that there are at least 27 different spellings of the name, the oldest surviving record being for &quot;Geneshale&quot; in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, and that it is only by chance that &quot;Gnosall&quot; is the current spelling.

The Stafford to Shrewsbury railway line once ran through the village. Gnosall&#x27;s railway station opened on 1 June 1849 and closed on 6 August 1966. The line was built by the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company, which also managed the Shropshire Union Canal which runs through the village. A footpath, the Way for the Millennium, now follows its route.

Landmarks of interest include:
*St. Lawrence&#x27;s Church, which dates from Norman times and stands over the site of an earlier Saxon church. 
*Coton Mill, where local rumours suggest self-raising flour was invented (despite strong evidence it was created in 1845, by Henry Jones, a baker in Bristol).
*The lock-up, originally built on Station Road some time after 10 June 1820, when its construction was scheduled, and moved to its current site on Sellman Street in 1971.

There are also several old, privately owned, buildings such as the Duke&#x27;s Head on the High Street that was previously a public house. With a thatched roof, and herring-bone brick pattern between faded, unpainted wooden beams, it may be suggested that it forms one of the most picturesque scenes in the village.

A new primary school opened in 2016 replacing the building constructed as Heronbrook School. This building was unusual in that it was designed to appear attractive from the railway line passing behind it rather than from the front.

Gnosall is fairly self-contained in terms of shops and amenities, with its own fire station, supermarket, doctor&#x27;s surgery, one dental practice, petrol station, sports club, take-aways, five pubs and historic high street.

Gnosall Heath has two canalside pubs, The Boat and The Navigation. The Royal Oak is situated on the main A518. In Gnosall village centre may be found The Horns and George and the Dragon, the latter a micropub which opened in 2015. The Sports Club is situated in extensive grounds off the 1970s Brookhouse Estate.

Many of the village&#x27;s ancient traditions are still honoured today, notably the carnival, where children dress up in themed costumes, and a parade complete with custom made floats and a brass band that runs to the Grosvener Centre field from the Royal Oak.

A large health centre was completed in 2006 at the opposite end of Gnosall from the old doctor&#x27;s surgery which was situated by the fire station; tribute to the rapid increase in population of recent years.

The village has a community first responder group, a charity consisting of trained local people who provide emergency cover on behalf of West Midlands Ambulance Service in response to 999 calls and administer basic life support, oxygen therapy, defibrillation and first aid whilst an ambulance is &quot;en route&quot;.

The village&#x27;s newspaper; &quot;GPN&quot; (Gnosall Parish News), is produced and sold in the village, and serves as a local advertiser of services and events, as well as publishing articles of interest to the local community.

Despite there being controversy over the legality, fishing is popular and fruitful on the canal.

== Notable people ==
* The Rev. Adam Blakeman (1596–1665), the Puritan minister who founded the early American town of Stratford, Connecticut, in 1639, was born in Gnosall.

<text>A FourCC (&quot;four-character code&quot;) is a sequence of four bytes (typically ASCII) used to uniquely identify data formats. It originated from the OSType or ResType metadata system used in classic Mac OS and was adopted for the Amiga/Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and derivatives. The idea was later reused to identify compressed data types in QuickTime and DirectShow.

==History==
In 1984, the earliest version of a Macintosh OS, System 1, was released. It used the single-level Macintosh File System with metadata fields including file types, creator (application) information, and forks to store additional resources. It was possible to change this information without changing the data itself, so that they could be interpreted differently. Identical codes were used throughout the system, as type tags for all kinds of data.

In 1985, Electronic Arts introduced the Interchange File Format (IFF) meta-format (family of file formats), originally devised for use on the Amiga. These files consisted of a sequence of &quot;chunks&quot;, which could contain arbitrary data, each chunk prefixed by a four-byte ID. The IFF specification explicitly mentions that the origins of the FourCC idea lie with Apple.

This IFF was adopted by a number of developers including Apple for AIFF files and Microsoft for RIFF files (which were used as the basis for the AVI and WAV file formats). Apple referred to many of these codes as &quot;OSTypes&quot;. Microsoft and Windows developers refer to their four-byte identifiers as &quot;FourCCs&quot; or &quot;Four-Character Codes&quot;. FourCC codes were also adopted by Microsoft to identify data formats used in DirectX, specifically within DirectShow and DirectX Graphics.

=== In Apple systems ===
Since Mac OS X Panther, OSType signatures are one of several sources that may be examined to determine a Uniform Type Identifier and are no longer used as the primary data type signature. Mac OS X (macOS) prefers the more colloquial convention of labelling file types using file name extensions. At the time of the change, the change was a source of great contention among older users, who believed that Apple was reverting to a more primitive way that misplaces metadata in the filename.

Filesystem-associated type codes are not readily accessible for users to manipulate, although they can be viewed and changed with certain software, most notably the macOS command line tools &quot;GetFileInfo&quot; and &quot;SetFile&quot; which are installed as part of the developer tools into &quot;/Developer/Tools&quot;, or the ResEdit utility available for older Macs.

== Technical details ==
The byte sequence is usually restricted to ASCII printable characters, with space characters reserved for padding shorter sequences. Case sensitivity is preserved, unlike in file extensions. FourCCs are sometimes encoded in hexadecimal (e.g., &quot;0x31637661&quot; for &#x27;avc1&#x27;) and sometimes encoded in a human-readable way (e.g., &quot;mp4a&quot;). Some FourCCs however, &quot;do&quot; contain non-printable characters, and are not human-readable without special formatting for display; for example, 10bit Y&#x27;CbCr 4:2:2 video can have a FourCC of (&#x27;Y&#x27;, &#x27;3&#x27;, 10, 10) which ffmpeg displays as codice_1.

Four-byte identifiers are useful because they can be made up of four human-readable characters with mnemonic qualities, while still fitting in the four-byte memory space typically allocated for integers in 32-bit systems (although endian issues may make them less readable). Thus, the codes can be used efficiently in program code as integers, as well as giving cues in binary data streams when inspected.

=== Compiler support ===

FourCC is written in big endian relative to the underlying ASCII character sequence, so that it appears in the correct byte order when read as a string. Many C compilers, including GCC, define a multi-character literal behavior of right-aligning to the least significant byte, so that becomes codice_2 in ASCII. This is the conventional way of writing FourCC codes used by Mac OS programmers for OSType. (Classic Mac OS was exclusively big-endian.)

On little-endian machines, a byte-swap on the value is required to make the result correct. Taking the avc1 example from above: although the literal already converts to the integer value , a little-endian machine would have reversed the byte order and stored the value as . To yield the correct byte sequence , the pre-swapped value is used.

==Common uses==

One of the most well-known uses of FourCCs is to identify the video codec or video coding format in AVI files. Common identifiers include &quot;DIVX&quot;, &quot;XVID&quot;, and &quot;H264&quot;. For audio coding formats, AVI and WAV files use a two-byte identifier, usually written in hexadecimal (such as &quot;0055&quot; for MP3). In QuickTime files, these two-byte identifiers are prefixed with the letters &quot;ms&quot; to form a four-character code. RealMedia files also use four-character codes, however, the actual codes used differ from those found in AVI or QuickTime files.

Other file formats that make important use of the four-byte ID concept are the Standard MIDI File (SMF) format, the PNG image file format, the 3DS (3D Studio Max) mesh file format and the ICC profile format.

Four-character codes are also used in applications other than file formats, for example:
* UEFI Forum for vendor in the ACPI ID Registry
* ACPI specification defines four-character identifiers in ACPI Source Language (ASL)
* Synopsys to tell component ID via registers of an IP (DesignWare collection)

Other uses for OSTypes include:
* as record field IDs and event type and class IDs in AppleEvents
* for identifying components in the Component Manager
* as “atom” IDs in the QuickTime movie and image file formats
* as a localization-independent way of identifying standard folders in the Folder Manager
* in QuickDraw GX, they were used as gxTag types and also as types of collection items in the Collection Manager.
* Enumeration constants in Apple APIs (as an integer; host endianess)
* &quot;OSStatus&quot; error codes in certain libraries, such as QuickTime (as an integer; host endianess)

<doc id="995745" wikidata="Q5496741" url="?curid=995745" title="Freddie Jackson">
<text>Frederick Anthony Jackson (born October 2, 1956) is an American singer. Originally from New York, Jackson began his professional music career in the late 1970s with the California funk band Mystic Merlin. Among his well–known R&amp;B/soul hits are &quot;Rock Me Tonight (For Old Times Sake)&quot; (1985), &quot;Have You Ever Loved Somebody&quot; (1986), &quot;Jam Tonight&quot; (1986), &quot;Do Me Again&quot; (1990), and &quot;You Are My Lady&quot; (1985). He contributed to the soundtrack for the 1989 film, &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; with the Michael Lloyd-produced duet &quot;Love Survives&quot; alongside Irene Cara. He also appeared in the movie &quot;King of New York&quot;.

==Biography==
===1956–1980: early life and education, Mystic Merlin===
Born in Harlem section of New York City, Jackson was trained as a gospel singer from an early age, singing at the White Rock Baptist Church of Harlem. There he met Paul Laurence, who would later become his record producer and songwriting partner. After completing school, Jackson joined Laurence&#x27;s group LJE (Laurence Jones Ensemble) and played the New York nightclub scene. During the late 1970s, Jackson moved to the West Coast and sang lead with the band Mystic Merlin (with which he released three studio albums, 1980–1982), but soon returned to New York to work with Laurence at Hush Productions.

===1981–2013: solo career===
Jackson sang on demo recordings of Laurence&#x27;s compositions, and also served as a backing singer for Melba Moore after she saw his nightclub act in 1981. In 1984, Jackson landed a recording contract with Capitol Records, and released his debut album, &quot;Rock Me Tonight&quot; in 1985. The Laurence-penned title track stormed the R&amp;B chart, spending six weeks at number one, and made Jackson an instant hit on urban contemporary radio. &quot;You Are My Lady&quot; gave him a second straight R&amp;B chart-topper, and also proved to be his highest-charting single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at No. 12. With &quot;He&#x27;ll Never Love You (Like I Do)&quot; and &quot;Love Is Just a Touch Away&quot; also hitting the R&amp;B Top Ten, &quot;Rock Me Tonight&quot; topped the R&amp;B album chart and went platinum. Jackson issued the follow-up &quot;Just Like the First Time&quot; 1986, on the heels of a number one R&amp;B duet with Melba Moore, &quot;A Little Bit More&quot; (from her album &quot;A Lot of Love&quot;). Another platinum seller, &quot;Just Like the First Time&quot; continued Jackson&#x27;s dominance of the R&amp;B singles charts; &quot;Tasty Love,&quot; &quot;Have You Ever Loved Somebody,&quot; and &quot;Jam Tonight&quot; all hit No. 1, while &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Lose Your Love&quot; went to No. 2.

The pace of Jackson&#x27;s success slowed with the 1988 release of &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Love Slip Away&quot;, which nonetheless featured another two R&amp;B chart-toppers in &quot;Hey Lover&quot; and &quot;Nice &#x27;N&#x27; Slow.&quot; The title track of 1990&#x27;s &quot;Do Me Again&quot; and &quot;Love Me Down&quot; duplicated that feat, and &quot;Main Course&quot; just missed, topping out at No. 2. Even so, Jackson&#x27;s earlier placings in the lower reaches of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 had long since disappeared, and some critics charged that his albums were growing too similar to one another. Jackson appeared as a lounge singer on the 1989 &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; episode &quot;Two Rode Together&quot; and sang the Disney song &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot; to Sophia. Also in 1989, Jackson sung the duet &quot;Love Survives&quot; with Irene Cara for the soundtrack to the film &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot;.

Seeking a new beginning, Jackson parted ways with Capitol/EMI in late 1993, and signed with RCA/BMG Records. His label debut, &quot;Here It Is&quot;, appeared the following year, with diminished commercial returns. Following a Christmas album, Jackson split with RCA and recorded &quot;Private Party&quot; for the smaller Street Life imprint of Scotti Brothers Records in 1995. Several years of silence ensued, until Orpheus issued &quot;Life After 30&quot; in late 1999; the equally low-key release &quot;Live in Concert&quot; followed in 2000. After returning to the charts with &quot;It&#x27;s Your Move&quot; in February 2004 (Martland Entertainment), Jackson released his tenth studio album, &quot;Transitions&quot;, in September 2006 on the record label Orpheus Music. At the end of 2010, Jackson released a new album on the Entertainment One Music label, entitled &quot;For You&quot;, and produced by hit songwriter Barry Eastmond. The album featured the single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Go&quot;.

===2014–present: later career===
On August 26, 2014, Jackson released the single &quot;Love &amp; Satisfaction,&quot; written by Dustin &quot;Dab&quot; Bowie, Gregory Bowman, Kameron Corvet, Bertram Ford Jr, and Selasi &quot;The African Kid,&quot; and released by the entertainment company Climax Entertainment. The single received some positive reviews and airplay, and allowed Jackson to reintroduce himself as he toured internationally in support of the release, as well as appear with artists Jeffrey Osborne, Peabo Bryson, Melba Moore, and Stephanie Mills at various performances and festivals. In late 2016, Jackson announced that he was recording a new album and that a new single would be released early the following year to mark his true return to recording studio and on May 1, 2017, the lead single &quot;One Night&quot; from his forthcoming album &quot;Love Signals&quot; was released via Climax and reached No. 1 on the internet radio Indie Soul chart associated with the Internet Broadcasters Alliance on June 12, 2017, while reaching in the top 50 of independent R&amp;B, smooth jazz, and soul charts around the US and Europe. In January 2018, Jackson appeared on the cover of &quot;STS Entertainment and Fashion Magazine&quot;. He performed in Albany, GA on April 21, 2018, at a Soul Music festival along with the 69 boys and various other performers. In August 2019, it was announced that Jackson would perform later that month as the headlining act of the 37th annual African World Festival, hosted by the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. In 2019, Jackson released the single &quot;A Million Ways&quot;.

A fiction piece in the November 25, 2019, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, by John Edgar Wideman, titled &quot;Arizona&quot;, is written as a letter to Jackson.

==Controversy==
In August 1988, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; reported that Jackson had verbally attacked George Michael in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; over his black music chart success.

<doc id="995746" wikidata="Q6935014" url="?curid=995746" title="Multiplier (Fourier analysis)">
<text>In Fourier analysis, a multiplier operator is a type of linear operator, or transformation of functions. These operators act on a function by altering its Fourier transform. Specifically they multiply the Fourier transform of a function by a specified function known as the multiplier or symbol. Occasionally, the term &quot;multiplier operator&quot; itself is shortened simply to &quot;multiplier&quot;. In simple terms, the multiplier reshapes the frequencies involved in any function. This class of operators turns out to be broad: general theory shows that a translation-invariant operator on a group which obeys some (very mild) regularity conditions can be expressed as a multiplier operator, and conversely. Many familiar operators, such as translations and differentiation, are multiplier operators, although there are many more complicated examples such as the Hilbert transform.
In signal processing, a multiplier operator is called a &quot;filter&quot;, and the multiplier is the filter&#x27;s frequency response (or transfer function).

In the wider context, multiplier operators are special cases of spectral multiplier operators, which arise from the functional calculus of an operator (or family of commuting operators). They are also special cases of pseudo-differential operators, and more generally Fourier integral operators. There are natural questions in this field that are still open, such as characterizing the &quot;Lp&quot; bounded multiplier operators (see below).

Multiplier operators are unrelated to Lagrange multipliers, except that they both involve the multiplication operation.

&quot;For the necessary background on the Fourier transform, see that page. Additional important background may be found on the pages operator norm and &quot;Lp&quot; space.&quot;

==Examples==
In the setting of periodic functions defined on the unit circle, the Fourier transform of a function is simply the sequence of its Fourier coefficients. To see that differentiation can be realized as multiplier, consider the Fourier series for the derivative of a periodic function formula_1 After using integration by parts in the definition of the Fourier coefficient we have that

:formula_2.

So, formally, it follows that the Fourier series for the derivative is simply the Fourier series for formula_3 multiplied by a factor formula_4. This is the same as saying that differentiation is a multiplier operator with multiplier formula_4.

An example of a multiplier operator acting on functions on the real line is the Hilbert transform. It can be shown that the Hilbert transform is a multiplier operator whose multiplier is given by the formula_6, where sgn is the signum function.

Finally another important example of a multiplier is the characteristic function of the unit cube in formula_7 which arises in the study of &quot;partial sums&quot; for the Fourier transform (see Convergence of Fourier series).

==Definition==
Multiplier operators can be defined on any group &quot;G&quot; for which the Fourier transform is also defined (in particular, on any locally compact abelian group). The general definition is as follows. If formula_8 is a sufficiently regular function, let formula_9 denote its Fourier transform (where formula_10 is the Pontryagin dual of &quot;G&quot;). Let formula_11 denote another function, which we shall call the &quot;multiplier&quot;. Then the multiplier operator formula_12 associated to this symbol &quot;m&quot; is defined via the formula

:formula_13

In other words, the Fourier transform of &quot;Tf&quot; at a frequency ξ is given by the Fourier transform of &quot;f&quot; at that frequency, multiplied by the value of the multiplier at that frequency. This explains the terminology &quot;multiplier&quot;.

Note that the above definition only defines Tf implicitly; in order to recover &quot;Tf&quot; explicitly one needs to invert the Fourier transform. This can be easily done if both &quot;f&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are sufficiently smooth and integrable. One of the major problems in the subject is to determine, for any specified multiplier &quot;m&quot;, whether the corresponding Fourier multiplier operator continues to be well-defined when &quot;f&quot; has very low regularity, for instance if it is only assumed to lie in an &quot;Lp&quot; space. See the discussion on the &quot;boundedness problem&quot; below. As a bare minimum, one usually requires the multiplier &quot;m&quot; to be bounded and measurable; this is sufficient to establish boundedness on formula_14 but is in general not strong enough to give boundedness on other spaces.

One can view the multiplier operator &quot;T&quot; as the composition of three operators, namely the Fourier transform, the operation of pointwise multiplication by &quot;m&quot;, and then the inverse Fourier transform. Equivalently, &quot;T&quot; is the conjugation of the pointwise multiplication operator by the Fourier transform. Thus one can think of multiplier operators as operators which are diagonalized by the Fourier transform.

== Multiplier operators on common groups ==

We now specialize the above general definition to specific groups &quot;G&quot;. First consider the unit circle formula_15 functions on &quot;G&quot; can thus be thought of as 2π-periodic functions on the real line. In this group, the Pontryagin dual is the group of integers, formula_16 The Fourier transform (for sufficiently regular functions &quot;f&quot;) is given by

:formula_17

and the inverse Fourier transform is given by

:formula_18

A multiplier in this setting is simply a sequence formula_19 of numbers, and the operator formula_12 associated to this multiplier is then given by the formula

:formula_21

at least for sufficiently well-behaved choices of the multiplier formula_19 and the function &quot;f&quot;.

Now let &quot;G&quot; be a Euclidean space formula_23. Here the dual group is also Euclidean, formula_24 and the Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms are given by the formulae

:formula_25

A multiplier in this setting is a function formula_26 and the associated multiplier operator formula_12 is defined by

:formula_28

again assuming sufficiently strong regularity and boundedness assumptions on the multiplier and function.

In the sense of distributions, there is no difference between multiplier operators and convolution operators; every multiplier &quot;T&quot; can also be expressed in the form &quot;Tf&quot; = &quot;f&quot;∗&quot;K&quot; for some distribution &quot;K&quot;, known as the &quot;convolution kernel&quot; of &quot;T&quot;. In this view, translation by an amount &quot;x&quot;0 is convolution with a Dirac delta function δ(· − &quot;x&quot;0), differentiation is convolution with δ&#x27;. Further examples are given in the table below.

==Diagrams==

==Further examples==

===On the unit circle===
The following table shows some common examples of multiplier operators on the unit circle formula_29

===On the Euclidean space===
The following table shows some common examples of multiplier operators on Euclidean space formula_23.

===General considerations===
The map formula_31 is a homomorphism of C*-algebras. This follows because the sum of two multiplier operators formula_32 and formula_33 is a multiplier operators with multiplier formula_34, the composition of these two multiplier operators is a multiplier operator with multiplier formula_35 and the adjoint of a multiplier operator formula_32 is another multiplier operator with multiplier formula_37.

In particular, we see that any two multiplier operators commute with each other. It is known that multiplier operators are translation-invariant. Conversely, one can show that any translation-invariant linear operator which is bounded on &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;) is a multiplier operator.

==The &quot;Lp&quot; boundedness problem==
The &quot;Lp&quot; boundedness problem (for any particular &quot;p&quot;) for a given group &quot;G&quot; is, stated simply, to identify the multipliers &quot;m&quot; such that the corresponding multiplier operator is bounded from &quot;Lp&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) to &quot;Lp&quot;(&quot;G&quot;). Such multipliers are usually simply referred to as &quot;&quot;Lp&quot; multipliers&quot;. Note that as multiplier operators are always linear, such operators are bounded if and only if they are continuous. This problem is considered to be extremely difficult in general, but many special cases can be treated. The problem depends greatly on &quot;p&quot;, although there is a duality relationship: if formula_38 and 1 ≤ &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; ≤ ∞, then a multiplier operator is bounded on &quot;Lp&quot; if and only if it is bounded on &quot;Lq&quot;.

The Riesz-Thorin theorem shows that if a multiplier operator is bounded on two different &quot;Lp&quot; spaces, then it is also bounded on all intermediate spaces. Hence we get that the space of multipliers is smallest for &quot;L&quot;1 and &quot;L&quot;∞ and grows as one approaches &quot;L&quot;2, which has the largest multiplier space.

===Boundedness on &quot;L&quot;2===
This is the easiest case. Parseval&#x27;s theorem allows to solve this problem completely and obtain that a function &quot;m&quot; is an &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;) multiplier if and only if it is bounded and measurable.

===Boundedness on &quot;L&quot;1 or &quot;L&quot;∞===
This case is more complicated than the Hilbertian (&quot;L&quot;2) case, but is fully resolved. The following is true:

Theorem: In the euclidean space formula_7 a function formula_40 is an&quot; &quot;L&quot;1 &quot;multiplier (equivalently an &quot;L&quot;∞ multiplier) if and only if there exists a finite Borel measure μ such that&quot; &quot;m&quot; &quot;is the Fourier transform of μ.

(The &quot;if&quot; part is a simple calculation. The &quot;only if&quot; part here is more complicated.)

===Boundedness on &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; for 1 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞===

In this general case, necessary and sufficient conditions for boundedness have not been established, even for Euclidean space or the unit circle. However, several necessary conditions and several sufficient conditions are known. For instance it is known that in order for a multiplier operator to be bounded on even a single &quot;Lp&quot; space, the multiplier must be bounded and measurable (this follows from the characterisation of &quot;L&quot;2 multipliers above and the inclusion property). However, this is not sufficient except when &quot;p&quot; = 2.

Results that give sufficient conditions for boundedness are known as multiplier theorems. Three such results are given below.

==== Marcinkiewicz multiplier theorem ====
Let formula_41 be a bounded function that is continuously differentiable on every set of the form formula_42 for formula_43 and has derivative such that

:formula_44

Then &quot;m&quot; is an &quot;Lp&quot; multiplier for all 1 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞.

==== Mikhlin multiplier theorem ====
Let &quot;m&quot; be a bounded function on formula_7 which is smooth except possibly at the origin, and such that the function formula_46 is bounded for all integers formula_47: then &quot;m&quot; is an &quot;Lp&quot; multiplier for all .

This is a special case of the Hörmander-Mikhlin multiplier theorem.

The proofs of these two theorems are fairly tricky, involving techniques from Calderón–Zygmund theory and the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem: for the original proof, see or .

====Radial multipliers====
For radial multipliers, a necessary and sufficient condition for formula_48 boundedness is known for some partial range of formula_49. Let formula_50 and formula_51. Suppose that formula_52 is a radial multiplier compactly supported away from the origin. Then formula_52 is an formula_48 multiplier if and only if the Fourier transform of formula_52 belongs to formula_48.

This is a theorem of Heo, Nazarov, and Seeger. They also provided a necessary and sufficient condition which is valid without the compact support assumption on formula_52.

===Examples===
Translations are bounded operators on any &quot;Lp&quot;. Differentiation is not bounded on any &quot;Lp&quot;. The Hilbert transform is bounded only for &quot;p&quot; strictly between 1 and ∞. The fact that it is unbounded on &quot;L&quot;∞ is easy, since it is well known that the Hilbert transform of a step function is unbounded. Duality gives the same for . However, both the Marcinkiewicz and Mikhlin multiplier theorems show that the Hilbert transform is bounded in &quot;Lp&quot; for all .

Another interesting case on the unit circle is when the sequence formula_58 that is being proposed as a multiplier is constant for &quot;n&quot; in each of the sets formula_59 and formula_60 From the Marcinkiewicz multiplier theorem (adapted to the context of the unit circle) we see that any such sequence (also assumed to be bounded, of course) is a multiplier for every .

In one dimension, the disk multiplier operator formula_61(see table above) is bounded on &quot;Lp&quot; for every . However, in 1972, Charles Fefferman showed the surprising result that in two and higher dimensions the disk multiplier operator formula_61 is unbounded on &quot;Lp&quot; for every . The corresponding problem for Bochner–Riesz multipliers is only partially solved; see also Bochner–Riesz conjecture.

<doc id="995760" wikidata="Q6234174" url="?curid=995760" title="John Freeman-Mitford, 1st Earl of Redesdale">
<text>John Thomas Freeman-Mitford, 1st Earl of Redesdale (9 September 1805 – 2 May 1886), styled as the 2nd Baron Redesdale between January 1830 and January 1877, was a Protestant controversialist and member of the House of Lords.

==Life==
He was born in Dublin on 9 September 1805, the son of the 1st Baron Redesdale, then Lord Chancellor of Ireland. He was educated at Eton and New College, Oxford (BA 1825, MA 1828, DCL 1853).

On the death of his father in January 1830, he succeeded as second baron, but took little part in the debates of the House of Lords until 1837, when he began to interest himself in the wording and detail of Parliamentary bills.

Wellington recommended him to study the private business of the house, so as to qualify himself for the chairmanship of committees, and on the resignation of the Earl of Shaftesbury, 4 February 1851, Lord Redesdale was unanimously chosen his successor, with the approval of Lansdowne, Stanley, and Wellington. This appointment he held with general credit until his death, and though assiduous in presiding when bills were in committee, made his power chiefly felt over private bill legislation.

His shrewdness and independence of judgment enabled him to detect the artifices of attorneys and agents, while his dictatorial manner was proverbial. Though he regarded all things, great and small, with a genuine conservatism, yet he never allowed his peculiar views to warp his decisions. Redesdale was especially severe on the drafting of railway bills, and in 1867 threatened to hale a contractor named France to the bar of the house for expressions reflecting on him as chairman. The correspondence showed that he was acting under a misapprehension. Nevertheless, his firm and honest management increased the authority of the House of Lords in connection with private business.
Redesdale was also a frequent speaker on general topics, e.g. the Reform Bill of 1867, when he opposed the Earl Grey&#x27;s amendment for the disfranchisement of certain boroughs, on the ground that the matter was beyond the proper jurisdiction of the peers, and that it was a mistake to make the franchise a party question. On the &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims, he maintained in 1872 that the United States had no claims to compensation because the Southerners had reentered the Union at the close of the war.

== Controversialist==
But his interests lay chiefly in religious topics, on which he assumed a pronouncedly Protestant and orthodox attitude.

He published in 1849 some &#x27;Reflections on the Doctrine of Regeneration and its Connection with both Sacraments, and in 1850 some &#x27;Observations on the Gorham Judgment and its Consequences.&#x27; In 1853 he was one of the revivers of convocation.

He refused to sign the report of the royal commission on the law of divorce, of which he was a member, on the ground that the dissolution of the marriage tie was contrary to Scripture, and besides vindicating his views in a pamphlet entitled &#x27;The Law of Scripture against Divorce&#x27; (1856), offered vigorous opposition to the measure of the following year.

Equally outspoken was his resistance to the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, which he maintained to be a violation of the Coronation Oath. On 17 July 1868, he moved for a copy of the oath, besides publishing two pamphlets, &#x27;Some of the Arguments by which Mr. Gladstone&#x27;s Resolutions are supported considered&#x27; (1868), and &#x27;Lord Macaulay on the Coronation Oath&#x27; (1869).

In 1874, appeared &#x27;Reasoning on some Points of Doctrine,&#x27; and in 1875 Redesdale entered into a controversy with Cardinal Manning in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; on the subject of communion in both kinds. The correspondence was republished by the &#x27;Press and St. James&#x27;s Chronicle,&#x27; under the title of &#x27;The Infallible Church and the Holy Communion.&#x27; Redesdale displayed considerable ingenuity in forcing the cardinal to base his arguments on authorities whose cogency he had denied, but, as might be expected from the predispositions of the dialecticians, the dispute led to no practical result.

On 3 January 1877, he was created Earl of Redesdale, in the County of Northumberland, on Disraeli&#x27;s recommendation.

On 14 June, he called attention in the House of Lords to a manual entitled &#x27;The Priest in Absolution,&#x27; published privately for the use of the clergy by the Society of the Holy Cross, and elicited a strong condemnation of its doctrines from Archbishop Archibald Tait.

In the same year also appeared his &#x27;Apostolic Doctrine of the Real Presence,&#x27; and in 1879 &#x27;On the Doctrine of the Real Presence; Correspondence between the Earl of Redesdale and the Hon. C. L. Wood, a discussion evoked by a speech of the latter at a meeting of the university branch of the English Church Union.
Redesdale also published &#x27;Thoughts on English Prosody and Translations from Horace,&#x27; and &#x27;Further Thoughts on English Prosody&#x27; (1859), odd attempts, suggested by an article in the &#x27; Quarterly Review,&#x27; vol. cxiv., on &#x27;Horace and his Translators,&#x27; to formulate rules of quantity for the English language on Latin models. His last pamphlet was &#x27;The Earldom of Mar: a Letter to the Lord Register of Scotland, the Earl of Glasgow,&#x27; a reply to the Earl of Crawford&#x27;s criticisms of Glasgow&#x27;s judgment.

He died unmarried on 2 May 1886, when the peerages became extinct. The earl bequeathed his estates to his kinsman, Bertram Freeman-Mitford, for whom the barony of Redesdale was re-created in 1902.

<text>Algernon Bertram Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale (24 February 1837 – 17 August 1916), was a British diplomat, collector and writer, whose most notable work is &quot;Tales of Old Japan&quot; (1871). Nicknamed &quot;Bertie&quot;, he was the paternal grandfather of the Mitford sisters.

==Early years==
Mitford was the son of Henry Reveley Mitford (1804–1883), of Exbury House, Hampshire, and great-grandson of the historian William Mitford. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, where he read Classics. While his paternal ancestors were landed gentry, whose holdings included Mitford Castle in Northumberland, his mother Lady (Georgiana) Jemima Ashburnham was the daughter of the 3rd Earl of Ashburnham and Lady Charlotte Percy. After his parents separated in 1840, his father, an erstwhile attaché at Florence, resided in Germany and France; his early years were thus spent on the Continent. 

Like his cousin Swinburne, he was named Algernon after his great-grandfather Algernon Percy, 1st Earl of Beverley, but always went by his middle-name Bertram and was known familiarly as &quot;Bertie&quot; (pronounced &quot;Barty&quot;).

==Career==

===Diplomacy===
Entering the Foreign Office in 1858, Mitford was appointed Third Secretary of the British Embassy at Saint Petersburg. After service in the Diplomatic Corps in Shanghai, he went to Japan in 1866 as second secretary to the British Legation at the time of the migration of the Japanese seat of power from Kyoto to Edo (modern-day Tokyo), known as the &quot;Meiji Restoration&quot;. There he met Ernest Satow whom he travelled with across the hinterland of Japan. He later wrote &quot;Tales of Old Japan&quot; (1871), a book credited with making such Japanese Classics as &quot;The Forty-seven Ronin&quot; first known to a wide Western public. He resigned from the diplomatic service in 1873.

Following the 1902 Anglo-Japanese Alliance, in 1906 Mitford accompanied Prince Arthur on a visit to Japan to present the Emperor Meiji with the Order of the Garter. He was asked by courtiers there about Japanese ceremonies that had disappeared since 1868. 

===Public life===
From 1874 to 1886, Mitford acted as secretary to HM Office of Works, involved in the lengthy restoration of the Tower of London and in landscaping parts of Hyde Park such as &quot;The Dell&quot;. From 1887, he was a member of the Royal Commission on Civil Services. He also sat as Member of Parliament for Stratford-on-Avon between 1892 and 1895.

According to W. S. Gilbert, Mitford served as a consultant on Japanese culture to Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan during the development of their 1885 Savoy Opera &quot;The Mikado&quot;. A traditional Japanese song hummed by Mitford to Gilbert and Sullivan during a rehearsal was used in the opera for the march accompanying the Mikado&#x27;s entrance.

In 1886, Mitford inherited the substantial Gloucestershire estates of his first cousin twice removed, John Freeman-Mitford, 1st Earl of Redesdale. In accordance with the will, he assumed by royal licence the additional surname of Freeman. Appointed a Deputy lieutenant and Justice of the peace for Gloucestershire, he became a magistrate and took up farming and horse breeding. He was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron from 1889 to 1914. Redesdale joined the Royal Photographic Society in 1907 and became a Fellow in 1908. He was President of the Royal Photographic Society between 1910 and 1912. 

Mitford substantially rebuilt Batsford Park, Batsford, Gloucestershire, in the Victorian Gothic manorial style. He also installed the Batsford Arboretum.

== Peerage ==
In the 1902 Coronation Honours list it was announced that Mitford would receive a barony, and the Redesdale title was revived when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Redesdale, of Redesdale in the County of Northumberland, on 15 July 1902. He took the oath and his seat in the House of Lords a week later, on 24 July.

== Pre- and extra-marital fatherhood ==
During his time in Japan, Mitford was said to have fathered two children with a geisha. Later, he may have fathered Clementine Hozier (1885–1977), in the course of an affair with his wife&#x27;s sister Blanche. Clementine married Winston Churchill in 1908.

== Horticultural interests ==
While in the Far East, he became interested in Chinese and Japanese garden and landscape design and the flora of these countries. On his return, he created the arboretum at Batsford as a wild garden of naturalistic planting based on his Chinese and Japanese observations. His 1896 book, &quot;The Bamboo Garden,&quot; was the first book on the cultivation of bamboos in European temperate climates and remained the only text on the subject until the 1960s. He persuaded Edward VII to plant Japanese knotweed at Sandringham House and it later became difficult to eradicate, according to George VI.

== H. S. Chamberlain ==
In his closing years, Lord Redesdale edited and wrote extensive and effusive introductions for two of Houston Stewart Chamberlain&#x27;s books, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Foundations of the Nineteenth Century&quot; and &quot;Immanuel Kant: A Study and Comparison with Goethe, Leonardo da Vinci, Bruno, Plato, and Descartes&quot;, both two volumes each, translated into English by John Lees, M.A., D.Litt., and published by John Lane at the Bodley Head, London, in 1910 and 1914 respectively.

== Marriage ==
In 1874, Mitford married Lady Clementine Gertrude Helen Ogilvy (1854–1932), daughter of David Ogilvy, 10th Earl of Airlie, by his wife, the Hon. Blanche Stanley, daughter of Lord Stanley of Alderley. Mitford and Clementine had five sons and four daughters. David, who succeeded in the barony, married Sydney Bowles, the daughter of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; founder Thomas Gibson Bowles, and was the father of the Mitford sisters. Mitford&#x27;s eldest son, Clement, died on 13 May 1915 in Belgium during the Second Battle of Ypres while serving with the 10th Royal Hussars. Mitford died the following year, and the gravestone inscription for Clement was chosen by the family after the war: &quot;AND SO HE PASSED OVER AND ALL THE TRUMPETS SOUNDED ON THE OTHER SIDE&quot;.

<doc id="995769" wikidata="Q6713718" url="?curid=995769" title="M275 motorway">
<text>The M275 is a , dual three-lane motorway in Hampshire, southern England. It is the principal road route for entering and leaving Portsmouth. It continues as the A3 into Portsmouth, and meets the M27 at its northern terminus. From the motorway, there are scenic views over Portsmouth harbour, and the Sails of the South between the two carriageways.

The M275 is not the responsibility of National Highways. It is managed by Portsmouth City Council from the point where the slip roads to the M27 end. The M275 was not built with a full hard shoulder. For its entire length, a narrow verge is maintained, although there is space available for a full width shoulder. Instead, drivers are warned on entry from the A3 and M27 of the lack of hard shoulder, with signs saying &quot;no hard shoulder for 2miles&quot;.

==History==

The motorway was opened throughout its entire length in 1976. A junction was originally planned for a new development in the Tipner area of Portsmouth, known as the Gateway Project, which was shelved at the time. The junction&#x27;s construction was abandoned primarily because planners realised that it would breach regulations that there must be a minimum of between motorway junctions. Before construction was halted, significant work had been carried out, including four incomplete slip roads with no road surfacing, two bridges above the site for the main roundabout, and realignment of Tipner Lane so that it served the roundabout. In 2001, the Sails of the South was unveiled close to the site of the missing junction. In 2005, Portsmouth City Council carried out refurbishments to gantry mounted signs on approach to the M27 junction. New signage was stuck over old signage, and was significantly smaller and disproportionate to the previous layout. Incorrect lane illustrations, lack of adequate route information, and increased difficulty to read at a long distance lead to driver frustration and confusion.

In 2005, the Tipner Gateway Project was resurrected along with plans for a junction. As previously, preparatory works have been carried out for the junction. Due to the regulations regarding junction spacing, the speed limit on the main carriageway of the M275 has been reduced to , and on the slip roads and from the southern end of Mile End Road to the Kingston Crescent Junction. The latter junction was to be renamed junction 2, with the new Tipner Junction becoming junction 1. Most of the road signs have been replaced and the M27/M275 interchange has been remodelled to make it easier for drivers, including splitting one lane into two, although this has meant that some of the overhead gantry signs are now redundant. Completion of the junction was achieved April 2014. The junction now leads to Tipner West. There is a large park and ride site for over 600 cars alongside the junction.

<doc id="995770" wikidata="Q392894" url="?curid=995770" title="John Dawson (Virginia politician)">
<text>John Dawson (1762March 31, 1814) was a Virginian lawyer, soldier and politician who served in the War of 1812 and a term in the Continental Congress as well as seven terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1797 until his death in office in 1814.

==Early life and education==
Born in the Colony of Virginia, Dawson graduated from Harvard University in 1782, studied law and was admitted to the bar.

==Career==
Known for his stylish attire and red hair, &quot;Beau&quot; Dawson was a good friend of, and prolific correspondent with, James Madison, for Dawson&#x27;s stepfather Judge Joseph Jones raised Madison&#x27;s good friend (and sometimes political opponent) James Monroe after his father&#x27;s death. 

=== Virginia offices ===
Dawson served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1786 to 1789 and was also elected a delegate of the Continental Congress in 1788.

A delegate to the Virginia Convention in 1788, Dawson opposed ratification, aligning himself with Monroe, Patrick Henry and George Mason, although that convention as a whole ratified the United States Constitution. The following year Dawson was selected to Virginia&#x27;s privy council and served in that executive branch capacity for several years. 

=== Congress ===
In 1796, Dawson was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Democratic-Republican and served from 1797 to his death in 1814. 

In 1801 President John Adams selected Dawson to transmit dispatches to the Government of France, and Dawson thus averted war with the one-time ally. Dawson became chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia from 1813 to 1814, as well as served as an aide to Generals Jacob Brown and future President Andrew Jackson during the War of 1812.

==Death==

Dawson died in Washington, D.C., on March 31, 1814.

<text>Fazlollah Zahedi (, pronounced ; 17 May 1892 – 2 September 1963) was an Iranian military officer and statesman who replaced the Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh through a coup d&#x27;état supported by the United States and the United Kingdom.

==Early life==
===Early years===
Born in Hamedan on 17 May 1892, Fazlollah Zahedi was the son of Abol Hassan &quot;Bassir Diwan&quot; Zahedi, a wealthy landowner at the city of Hamedan. He was a descendant of the Sufi mystics Sheikh Zahed Gilani and Sheikh Safi-ad-Din Ardabili, the eponym of the Safavid dynasty, and through his mother, Djavaher Khanom, he traced his descent to the dynastic ruler Karim Khan Zand. Through him, Zahedi was a distant relative of Mohammad Mosaddegh.

During his service at the Imperial Russian-trained Iranian Cossack Brigade, one of his military superiors was Reza Khan, who later became the Iranian monarch. Zahedi was among the officers dispatched to Gilan to put an end to the Jangal movement of Mirza Kuchak Khan. At the age of 23, as a company commander, Zahedi led troops into battle against rebel tribesmen in the northern provinces. Two years later Reza Shah promoted him to the rank of brigadier general. He was involved in the overthrow of Seyyed Zia&#x27;eddin Tabatabaee&#x27;s government in 1920 with the help of Meguertitch Khan Davidkhanian.

During Reza Shah&#x27;s reign, General Zahedi was named military governor of Khuzestan province in 1926, his first important government position, and in 1932 chief of national police, one of the nation&#x27;s top internal posts. In 1941 he was appointed commanding general of the Isfahan division.

==Arrest and internment==
Following the forced abdication of Reza Shah in 1941, the British came to believe that Zahedi was planning a general uprising in cooperation with German forces, and as one of the worst grain-hoarders, was responsible for widespread popular discontent. He was arrested in his own office by Fitzroy Maclean, who details the operation, codenamed PONGO, in his 1949 memoir &quot;Eastern Approaches&quot;. On searching Zahedi&#x27;s bedroom Maclean found &quot;a collection of automatic weapons of German manufacture, a good deal of silk underwear, some opium, an illustrated register of the prostitutes of Isfahan,&quot; and correspondence from a local German agent. Zahedi was flown out of the country and interned in Palestine.

===Return from internment===
After returning from internment in 1945 during the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah (Reza Shah&#x27;s son and successor), General Zahedi became Inspector of military forces in southern Iran. He became once more chief of national police (Shahrbani) in 1949, when Mohammad Reza Shah appointed him as chief of the &quot;Shahrbani&quot; Police Forces, in order to counter the growing threat of Sepahbod Haj Ali Razmara.

==After 1945==
===The 1950s===
After retiring from the army, he was named Senator in 1950. Zahedi was appointed minister of interior in Hossein Ala&#x27;&#x27;s administration in 1951, a post he would retain when Mohammad Mosaddegh became prime minister. Zahedi actively supported the new government&#x27;s nationalisation of the oil industry, which had previously been owned by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, now BP. However, he was at odds with Mosaddegh over his increasing tolerance for the outlawed communist party Tudeh, which had boldly demonstrated in favor of nationalisation. Both of these moves antagonised the Western Powers, especially the United Kingdom and the United States. Zahedi was dismissed by Prime Minister Mosaddegh after a bloody crackdown on pro-nationalization protesters in mid-1951 in which 20 people were killed and 2000 wounded.

Zahedi finally broke with Mosaddegh, with the latter accusing him of fostering plans for a coup. Meanwhile, sanctions levied by the Western Powers significantly curtailed Iranian oil exports, leading to an economic crisis. Disorder among several ethnic groups in southern Iran and labor unrest among oil-field workers put further pressures on the government.

===1953 coup===
At the behest of the British and American governments, the Iranian military carried out a coup d&#x27;état which put an end to Mosaddegh&#x27;s rule and the era of constitutional monarchy and replaced it by direct rule of the Shah. The newly formed CIA, along with the British intelligence agency MI6, took an active role in the developments, terming their involvement Operation Ajax. Zahedi and his followers, financed by the foreign intelligence services, planted newspaper articles in Iranian publications and paid agent provocateurs to start riots. There were such riots in Tehran and other cities. Fearing his arrest, Zahedi went into hiding.

On 15 August, after the first attempted coup d&#x27;état failed, the Shah fled first to Baghdad, Iraq, and then to Rome, Italy, after signing two decrees, one dismissing Mosaddegh and the other naming Zahedi to replace him as Prime Minister. Both decrees were in accordance with clause 46 of the Iranian constitution, which stated that the Shah had the power to appoint all Ministers.

Backed by the United Kingdom and the United States, and encouraged by the intelligence agents Kermit Roosevelt Jr and Donald Wilber, Zahedi staged a second coup on 19 August 1953. Military units arrested Mosaddegh at his home at night. The Shah returned from exile on 22 August 1953. According to the CIA, Zahedi was chosen because he was acceptable to the United States and Britain, had a long record of opposing Mosaddegh, had a significant following, and was willing to take the job.

===Premiership and later years===
General Zahedi was appointed prime minister in August 1953, and his cabinet was declared on 20 August. One-thirds of the ministers in Zahedi&#x27;s cabinet were army officers. His tenure as prime minister ended in April 1955, and he was replaced by Hussein Ala.

His final post was Ambassador to the United Nations, in Geneva, where he died in 1963.

==Personal life==

Zahedi married Khadijeh Pirnia ol-Moluk, daughter of Hossein Pirnia (titled &quot;Mo&#x27;tamen al Molk&quot;), and maternal granddaughter to Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar. They had a son, Ardeshir, and a daughter, Homa.

Ardeshir was a politician and diplomat and married Princess Shahnaz Pahlavi, the daughter of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from his first marriage to Princess Fawzia of Egypt, daughter of King Fuad I.

His daughter Homa Zahedi was a member of Parliament, representing the constituency of the Hamadan Province. She was married to journalist and politician Dariush Homayoon.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; report a day after the 1953 coup, &quot;General Zahedi married twice, but it is not known here whether his second wife is living. By his second wife he had two sons, one of whom lives in Sydney, Australia, while the second son, an air force officer, was killed in a crash.&quot;

<doc id="995799" wikidata="Q350287" url="?curid=995799" title="Gustavo Munúa">
<text>Gustavo Adolfo Munúa Vera (born 27 January 1978) is a Uruguayan former footballer who played as a goalkeeper, recently manager of Argentine club Banfield.

After starting out at Nacional he spent most of his professional career in Spain, mainly at Deportivo de La Coruña where he could never be a starter in six seasons. He also played in the country for Málaga and Levante, being first choice and appearing in 151 La Liga matches over one decade.

An Uruguayan international for six years, Munúa represented the country at the 2002 World Cup. As manager, he had two spells at Nacional and also worked in the top divisions of Ecuador and Argentina.

==Playing career==
===Club===
====Nacional====
Born in Montevideo, Munúa started his career at local Club Nacional de Football, where he won four Uruguayan Primera División titles in a row. He held the record of being the first goalkeeper to score in Uruguayan football, when he netted from a free kick in a league win against Central Español.

Munúa later scored three goals from penalties, both in the league and the Copa Libertadores.

====Deportivo====
Munúa left Nacional in 2003, joining La Liga side Deportivo de La Coruña on a six-year contract, where he struggled to gain first-choice status. From 2003 to 2006 he was topped by Spanish international José Francisco Molina and, subsequently, faced stiff competition from Israel&#x27;s Dudu Aouate.

In January 2008, after regaining first-choice from Aouate, both goalkeepers were involved in a post-training punching session that resulted in both being suspended for the match against Villarreal CF, as well as subsequent league games. In February, due to B-team goalkeeper Fabri&#x27;s inexperience, both players were reinstated in the squad, although the Israeli regained his lost spot.

After having started the following season, as Aouate, deemed surplus to requirements, Munúa eventually returned to back-up status, as Aouate was sold to RCD Mallorca and Fabri returned to the reserves. On 25 January 2009, due to the forced absence of new first-choice Dani Aranzubia (sent off the previous week against FC Barcelona), he returned to action for his only appearance of the campaign, a 1–0 loss at Real Madrid.

====Málaga and Levante====

On 28 June 2009, Munúa signed a one-year deal with Málaga CF. At his new club he was an instant first choice, appearing in all the league games in his first year as the Andalusians barely avoided relegation (17th position).

After only one season, Munúa rejected a new contract offer and was released by the club, on 26 May 2010. On 6 August he signed with Levante UD, returned to the top flight after two years, and he made his official debut on 28 August, in a 1–4 home defeat to Sevilla FC.

Munúa was a starter for the Valencian Community side throughout the vast majority of his spell. However, late into his third season, he, alongside Sergio Ballesteros and Juanlu, was accused by teammate José Barkero of lack of commitment during a 4–0 home loss against Deportivo, which led to several match fixing allegations.

====Later years====
In January 2014, after a brief spell with ACF Fiorentina which consisted of two UEFA Europa League appearances, the 36-year-old Munúa returned to his country and Nacional.

===International===
Munúa made his debut for Uruguay aged 20, in a friendly match with Chile on 24 May 1998. As a backup, he represented the nation at the 2001 Copa América and the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

==Coaching career==
After winning the 2015 national championship with the latter, as team captain, Munúa was announced as Álvaro Gutiérrez&#x27;s replacement as head coach. The following season, he resigned in June 2016 due to a poor showing in the Clausura tournament.
In December 2016, Munúa was named manager of Ecuador&#x27;s L.D.U. Quito. He was dismissed at the end of July, having won one of 20 league matches, but also reached the knockout stages of the Copa Sudamericana with victories over Defensor Sporting and Club Bolívar.

On 7 November 2017, Munúa returned to his former club Deportivo as manager of their reserves in the Segunda División B. In his one season in the dugout, the club reached the play-offs where they lost on away goals to Extremadura UD after a 3–3 aggregate draw.

Munúa joined fellow third division side FC Cartagena on 10 July 2018. He again took his team to the post-season, this time being eliminated 3–1 in the semi-finals by SD Ponferradina.

On 22 December 2019, Munúa took advantage of a contract clause allowing him to leave for a top-flight or foreign team, and returned to Nacional for the upcoming season; he mentioned the necessity of being nearer his two teenage children. He was relieved of his job on 15 October 2020, after losing the Apertura final to C.A. Rentistas.

In October 2021, Munúa was hired at Unión de Santa Fe, ranked 14th in the Argentine Primera División. He led the team to the last 16 of the 2022 Copa Sudamericana, losing 4–1 on aggregate to his former team Nacional. On 4 April 2023, he was dismissed, with one win and four losses leaving the team second from bottom after nine games of the new season.

<doc id="995801" wikidata="Q1138575" url="?curid=995801" title="Dajabón Province">
<text>Dajabón () is a northwestern province which currently comprises one of the 32 provinces of the Dominican Republic. It is divided into 5 municipalities and its capital city with the same name. It is bordered by the provinces of Monte Cristi to the north, Santiago Rodríguez to the south, Elías Piña to the south and the Nord-Est department of Haiti to the west.

It was split from Monte Cristi in 1938, and was called &quot;Libertador&quot; until 1961.

==Location==
It is located in the northwestern part of the country, and is surrounded by the provinces Monte Cristi (north), Santiago Rodríguez (east) and Elías Piña (south). To the west, Dajabón borders the Republic of Haiti.

==Origin of name==
The province takes its name from the Taíno name of the region, Dahaboon; it was also the name of the main river of the region (the Dajabón River).

==Municipalities and municipal districts==

The province as of June 20, 2006 is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot; - D.M.) within them:
*Dajabón
**Cañongo (D.M.)
*El Pino
**Manuel Bueno (D.M.)
*Loma de Cabrera
**Capotillo (D.M.)
**Santiago de la Cruz (D.M.)
*Partido
*Restauración
The following is a sortable table of the municipalities and municipal districts with population figures as of the 2014 estimate. Urban population are those living in the seats (&quot;cabeceras&quot; literally heads) of municipalities or of municipal districts. Rural population are those living in the districts (&quot;Secciones&quot; literally sections) and neighborhoods (&quot;Parajes&quot; literally places) outside them. The population figures are from the 2014 population estimate.

==Geography==

The Cordillera Central (&quot;Central mountain chain&quot;) is found in the southern part of the province. The northern part is flat, with many savannas; it is part of the &quot;Yaque del Norte Valley&quot; (or &quot;Línea Noroeste&quot;).

===Rivers===
The only important river in the province is the Dajabón River, also known as &quot;Masacre&quot; (from French &quot;Massacre&quot;). This river marks the Dominican-Haitian border from the city of Dajabón to its mouth. Other rivers are very short and they are tributaries of the Dajabon or the Artibonite rivers.

===Climate===
The climate of the province is a tropical climate, hot most of the year, but it is cooler on the mountains.

== Economy ==

As in all border provinces in the Dominican Republic, there is little economic development. The trade with Haiti is important, mostly in the city of Dajabón. On the mountains, production of coffee and beans is an important activity. Rice and banana are produced in the northern part of the province, and cattle raising is important in the savannas around the city of Dajabón.

==Popular Culture==

Dajabon is the reputed birthplace of famed Latin American singer Angela Carrasco, although she claims to have been born in Santo Domingo.

<doc id="995803" wikidata="Q1075091" url="?curid=995803" title="Chizarira National Park">
<text>Chizarira National Park is a national park that lies in Northern part of Zimbabwe. At , it is the third-largest national park in Zimbabwe, and also one of the least known because of its isolated situation on the Zambezi Escarpment. It has good wildlife populations and some majestic scenery. The name of the park comes from the Batonga word &quot;chijalila&quot;, which translates into English as &quot;great barrier&quot;, referring to Zambezi Escarpment, of which Chizarira’s rough terrain forms a part.

== Description ==
The northern portion of the park is situated within the Southern miombo woodlands ecoregion, while the southern part is located within the Zambezian and mopane woodlands ecoregion. The escarpment falls steeply some to the Zambezi River valley floor and offers magnificent views towards Lake Kariba, north. Rivers such as the Mcheni and Lwizikululu have cut almost sheer gorges in the escarpment. At the north eastern extremity of the park lies Tundazi, a mountain on which, according to local legend, resides an immense serpent, the river god Nyaminyami. The southern boundary is marked by the Busi River which is flanked by floodplains supporting winter thorn &quot;Faidherbia albida&quot; woodlands.

Chizarira is Zimbabwe&#x27;s 3rd largest national park, with a hugh population of four of the Big Five animals with the rhinos missing . The terrain is excellent for leopard, and there is a good variety of herbivore. Its main attraction is its enormous wilderness appeal. Walking safaris are a big part of the experience. Arguably Zimbabwe’s third largest National Park and indisputably the most remote wilderness area, Chizarira national park derives its name from the  Batonga word “Chijalila” which means “The Great Barrier”, an orientation of phenomenal mountains and copious hills that form a fabulous portion of the Zambezi Escarpment. The terrain in the park is craggy, punctuated with ragged mountains, intensely incised by gorgeous gorges and awesome gulches.  In the intensely impenetrable valleys, sandwiched by the unique open plain rests the lush vegetation comfortably suckled by vibrant natural springs. This has made the park an amazing place to appreciate nature.

== Fauna ==
Chizarira National Park, plays host to most of the expected plains wildlife as well as megafauna such as African elephant, lion, leopard and Cape buffalo. There are also many species of smaller wildlife, including the klipspringer, known for its ability to thrive in near-vertical rocky outcrops. Chizarira has a large variety of bird life and hundreds of species have been sighted within the Park. Sought after birds recorded include the African broadbill, Livingstone&#x27;s flycatcher, western nicator, African emerald cuckoo and the rare and elusive African pitta. Chizarira is also home to the Taita falcon which breeds within the Park. 

Chizarira was declared as a non-hunting reserve in 1938 and as a game reserve in 1963; it was given National Park status under the &quot;Parks and Wild Life Act&quot; (1975). The park has its headquarters at Manzituba.

This remoteness and the few visitors has meant that Chizarira has experienced increased risk from poachers in recent years. The lack of lodges and safari operators in the park has meant that poachers have free rein and the park has suffered as a result, particularly during the economic crisis that engulfed Zimbabwe in the early 2000s.

<doc id="995806" wikidata="Q1262745" url="?curid=995806" title="Duarte Province">
<text>Duarte () is a northeastern province which comprises one of the 32 provinces of the Dominican Republic. It is divided into 7 municipalities and its capital city is San Francisco de Macorís. It is bordered by the provinces of María Trinidad Sánchez and Samaná to the east, Monte Plata and Sánchez Ramírez to the south, La Vega and Hermanas Mirabal to the west and Espaillat to the north. It is named after Juan Pablo Duarte, the founder of the Dominican Republic.

It was created in 1896 as a district (an old country subdivision) with the name &quot;Distrito Pacificador&quot; but the Constitution of 1907 changed the category to province. In 1925 its name was changed to &quot;Duarte&quot;.

== Geography ==
The province has a total area of 1,605.35 km2. It has 3.3% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 13th (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province.

==History==
The province is named in honor of the country&#x27;s founding father Juan Pablo Duarte. In the 18th century, a chapel for the Lady of Santa Ana was founded, built in what is now the Rincón San Francisco de Macorís. For the nineteenth century, it was admitted to the category of Parish to later become the District of La Vega. When the independence of the Dominican Republic was proclaimed, Duarte was the first town in the Cibao to rise up in favor of the Puerta del Conde. After the republic had been established, Duarte became a part of La Vega.

In 1896 San Francisco became the head of the Peacekeeping District —this name was given in honor of President Ulises Heureaux, who was given the title of Peacemaker of the Homeland. In 1907 it became a province with the same as Peacemaker. In 1925 the name of the Pacifying Province was changed to the Duarte Province, in honor of the Father of the nation.

== Municipalities ==
The province as of June 20, 2006 is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot; - D.M.) within them:

*San Francisco de Macorís, head municipality of the province
**Cenoví (D.M.)
**Jaya (D.M.)
**La Peña (D.M.)
**Presidente Don Antonio Guzmán Fernández (D.M.)
*Arenoso
**El Aguacate (D.M.)
**Las Coles (D.M.)
*Castillo
*Eugenio María de Hostos
**Sabana Grande (D.M.)
*Las Guáranas
*Pimentel
*Villa Riva
**Agua Santa del Yuna (D.M.)
**Barraquito (D.M.)
**Cristo Rey de Guaraguao (D.M.)
**Guáranas Arriba (D.M.)

== Population ==
The following is a sortable table of the municipalities and municipal districts with population figures as of the 2014 estimate. Urban population are those living in the seats (&quot;cabeceras&quot; literally heads) of municipalities or of municipal districts. Rural population are those living in the districts (&quot;Secciones&quot; literally sections) and neighborhoods (&quot;Parajes&quot; literally places) outside them. The population figures are from the 2014 population estimate.

<text>The M271 is a motorway near Southampton in Hampshire, England. Construction began in 1973 and it opened in 1975. It provides part of the route to Southampton Docks from the M27, which in turn makes up another part of the route to the docks from the nearby M3 Motorway.

==Route==
The motorway begins at Redbridge near Totton at a grade separated roundabout with the A35, heading north, briefly as a dual three-lane motorway. At its first junction, it reduces to two lanes and continues east of Hillyfields. After a further it reaches a junction with the M27 at a signal controlled roundabout. North of the M27 it enters the countryside and terminates after a further mile of dual two-lane road at another roundabout, this time with the A3057 near Upton.

In 2019, improvement works to Redbridge Roundabout at the southern end, introduced a dedicated lane to connect the M271 with the A33 towards the docks in a free-flow interchange.

<doc id="995809" wikidata="Q56696202" url="?curid=995809" title="Conjugated linoleic acid">
<text>Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are a family of isomers of linoleic acid. In principle, 28 isomers are possible. CLA is found mostly in the meat and dairy products derived from ruminants. The two C=C double bonds are conjugated (i.e., separated by a single bond) as opposed by &quot;typical&quot; polyunsaturated fatty acids where double bonds are separated by two single bonds. CLAs are simultaneously both cis-fats and trans-fats, as one of the two C=C bonds is &quot;cis&quot; and the other &quot;trans&quot;.

CLA is marketed as a dietary supplement on the basis of its claimed health benefits.

==Biochemistry==
CLA describes a variety of isomers of octadecadienoic fatty acids.

Commonly, CLAs are studied as some mixture of isomers wherein the isomers c9,t11-CLA (rumenic acid) and t10,c12-CLA were the most abundant. Studies show however that individual isomers have distinct health effects.

Conjugated linoleic acid is both a &quot;trans&quot; fatty acid and a &quot;cis&quot; fatty acid. The &quot;cis&quot; bond causes a lower melting point and, ostensibly, also the observed beneficial health effects. Unlike other &quot;trans&quot; fatty acids, it may have beneficial effects on human health. CLA is conjugated, and in the United States, &quot;trans&quot; linkages in a conjugated system are not counted as &quot;trans&quot; fats for the purposes of nutritional regulations and labeling. CLA and some &quot;trans&quot; isomers of oleic acid are produced by microorganisms in the rumens of ruminants. Non-ruminants, including humans, produce certain isomers of CLA from &quot;trans&quot; isomers of oleic acid, such as vaccenic acid, which is converted to CLA by delta-9-desaturase.

In healthy humans, CLA and the related conjugated linolenic acid (CLNA) isomers are bioconverted from linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid, respectively, mainly by &quot;Bifidobacterium&quot; bacteria strains inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract. However, this bioconversion may not occur at any significant level in those with a digestive disease, gluten sensitivity, or dysbiosis.

==Health effects==

CLA is marketed in dietary supplement form for its supposed anti-cancer benefit (for which there is no strong evidence or known mechanism, and very few studies conducted so far) and as a bodybuilding aid. A 2004 review of the evidence said that while CLA seemed to benefit animals, there was a lack of good evidence of human health benefits despite the many claims made for it.

Likewise, there is insufficient evidence that CLA has a useful benefit for overweight or obese people as it has no long-term effect on body composition. Although CLA has shown an effect on insulin response in diabetic rats, there is no evidence of this effect in humans.

==Dietary sources==
Food products from grass-fed ruminants (e.g. mutton and beef) are good sources of CLA and contain much more of it than those from grain-fed animals. Eggs from chickens that have been fed CLA are also rich in CLA, and CLA in egg yolks has been shown to survive the temperatures encountered during frying. Some mushrooms, such as &quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot; and &quot;Agaricus subrufescens&quot;, are rare non-animal sources of CLA.

However, dietary punicic acid—which is abundant in pomegranate seeds—is converted to the rumenic acid (which is 9Z11E-CLA) upon absorption in rats, suggesting that non-animal sources can still effectively provide dietary CLA.

== History ==
In 1979 CLAs were found to inhibit chemically-induced cancer in mice and research on its biological activity has continued.

In 2008, the United States Food and Drug Administration categorized CLA as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

<text>The Bomb, Medium Capacity, (Grand Slam) was a earthquake bomb used by RAF Bomber Command against German targets towards the end of the Second World War. The bomb was originally called Tallboy Large until the term Tallboy got into the press and the code name was replaced by &quot;Grand Slam&quot;. The bomb was similar to a large version of the Tallboy bomb but a new design and closer to the size that its inventor, Barnes Wallis, had envisaged when he developed the idea of an earthquake bomb. It was the largest and most powerful conventional aerial bomb used by either side during the war.

Medium Capacity (M.C.) bombs were designed to remedy the shortcomings of General Purpose (G.P.) bombs, with a greater blast and casings which were robust enough to confer a considerable capacity to penetrate, especially the Tallboy and Grand Slam. The Grand Slam case was made of a chrome-molybdenum alloy steel and had a charge-to-weight ratio of over 43 per cent.

Standard Avro Lancaster bombers could not carry the bomb; Avro built 32 Lancaster B.Mk 1 (Special)s with more powerful Merlin engine variants, a stronger undercarriage, without bomb bay doors and minus many items to save weight. When airborne with the Grand Slam, a Special could barely manoeuvre, and pilots were advised to refrain from minor adjustments of the flying controls, allowing the aircraft to wallow. A Lancaster which returned with its bomb was not permitted to land at RAF Woodhall Spa, the 617 Squadron base; it had to use the longer runway at RAF Carnaby.

From 14 March to 19 April 1945, 42 Grand Slams were dropped on Germany. When landing on reinforced concrete, the bombs tended to break up on impact or explode prematurely. The bombs had been designed to land in soft ground, penetrate deeply and then explode, creating a , causing the structure above to subside. Grand Slams and Tallboys were capable of causing damage that smaller bombs could not, accelerating the collapse of German resistance and avoiding mass civilian casualties. Grand Slams were the most effective bombs used by the Allies until the advent of atomic weapons later that year. After the war, the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces used Grand Slams and other bombs for research.

==Background==

===Medium Capacity bombs===

Medium Capacity (M.C.) bombs were designed to address the shortcomings of General Purpose (G.P.) bombs, which had a charge-to-weight ratio of about 27 per cent (contemporary German bombs had a ratio of 50 per cent). M.C. bombs were to have a charge-to-weight ratio of at least 40 per cent and use explosives of greater power, although shortages often led to inferior explosive types being used. High Capacity (H.C.) bombs had a charge-to-weight ratio of up to 75 per cent. M.C. bombs had greater blast effect than G.P. bombs but had casings which were robust enough to confer a considerable capacity to penetrate.

===Grand Slam===


On 18 July 1943, after the Dams raid, the Controller of Research and Development at the Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP) received a requirement for twelve Tallboy Small [] bombs, 60 unfilled Tallboy Medium (Tallboy) bombs and 100 Tallboy Large. Lack of capacity led to work on the Tallboy Large being stopped on 30 September. Interest in the Tallboy Large, renamed Grand Slam on 22 November 1944, after the term Tallboy appeared in the press, increased after better understanding of the effect of the Tallboy was gained by the inspection of targets in Europe. The Tallboy was discovered to be too small to destroy concrete buildings with direct hits; only near misses which opened a under the foundations were found to be effective. In September 1944 the German V-2 rocket bombardment of London began, which had been expected by the British since Operation Hydra (the attack on the Peenemünde research centre on the night of 17/18 August 1943), and Grand Slams were considered as a weapon to be used on V-2 launch sites.

Doubts remained at the Air Ministry; an officer in the planning department was sceptical, even with the discovery of the limits of the Tallboy bomb, about what the Grand Slam could be used on and whether when ready in February–March 1945, there would be anything left to bomb. Aircraft adapted to carry the Grand Slam could not carry any other load. Air Commodore Christopher Bilney replied that the Tallboy Large would be more useful than the Upkeep mine used in the Dams raid. At the Bomber Command headquarters in High Wycombe, there was a debate about how many Tallboy Larges to order, which ranged from 25 to 75 per month. The head of Bomber Command, Air Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, thought that the new bomb might be useful against U-boat pens and the bigger targets of Operation Crossbow (anti-V-weapons attacks) but put the burden on the Air Ministry to decide how many to manufacture. In September the decision to make the new bombs was made and 600 were ordered in October; 200 from British sources and 400 from the US. The British order was cancelled on 4 October, leaving only US production, but RAF representatives in the US were able to persuade the Americans to build fifty bomb casings by the end of the year, to be filled in Britain. Four Lancaster bombers for trials were ordered then this was cut to one aircraft. During the Battle of the Bulge (16 December 1944 – 25 January 1945) any complacency about an imminent end to the war was confounded; the Grand Slam production order was revised again for 25 from British sources and 200 from the US.
An expanded version of the Tallboy design was not feasible and the English Steel Corporation of Sheffield began work on &quot;large boilers&quot; in late 1944. Experiments with the composition of the bomb casing, a steel alloy of chromium–molybdenum, were undertaken to find one that could withstand the shock of impact. A concrete core, accurate to 1/10,000th of an inch was made, then a sand-covered outer mould was created, into which the molten metal was poured. The core was chipped out after the metal had cooled but hot places on the casing could result in structural flaws, breaking the bomb casing when it hit, with no guarantee of the detonation of its contents. The US casings were made by electric resistance welding but both types had to pass stress tests to weed out inadequate examples. The British-made casings were sent on specially built road trailers to be machined, the nose on one and the tail on another.

The nose sections were filled by upending them to pour in of Torpex explosive a bucketful at a time. Once the tail section was connected, the Grand Slam was long, at its widest diameter and weighed . As with the Tallboy, the fins of the Grand Slam were angled and generated a stabilising spin and the Grand Slam had a charge-to-weight ratio of 43 per cent. Four fuzes were provided, one specially made for the Grand Slam with an 11-second delay, the No. 53 with a thirty-minute delay, a No. 53A with an hour&#x27;s delay and a No. 37 which had a delay of 6 to 144 hours. The first bomb arrived at Woodhall Spa on 20 January and fifteen were expected by the beginning of February.

===Lancaster B.Mk 1 (Special)===

The ten remaining Dambuster Lancasters were sent for storage at the end of 1944 and 617 Squadron was increased from two flights to three, at the expense of 51 Squadron, a Halifax squadron of 4 Group, which lost a flight. To carry the Grand Slam, specially modified Lancasters were necessary but these would have to be subtracted from the production of ordinary Lancasters, when several 5 Group squadrons were also converting to Lancasters from the Halifax. The weight of the Grand Slam meant that only new aircraft would be able to carry it, rather than converting existing and worn aircraft; 32 B.Mk 1 (Special)s were ordered from Avro. There was little agreement on what equipment the specials should carry and Avro backslid on production to keep the new Avro Lincoln, a Lancaster derivative, on schedule. Work began on the specials at the end of January 1945 and two had been built by 13 February, twelve were due within ten days, 24 by month&#x27;s end and the remainder in March.

PB995 was sent to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE) with PB592/G, a conventional B.Mk 1 built in 1944, which was to be modified to a B.MK 1 (Special). Some equipment did not need to be fitted but other items were removed, which began a period of removals and reinstatements; a conference on 25 February was necessary to sort out the confusion. The front and mid-upper turrets were to go, along with the H2S, its fairing and the TR1196 R/T set, electric lights, flare chutes, flame dampers, some of the fuel tanks, the rear turret armour, three fire axes, a toolkit and the crew ladder. The commander of 5 Group, Air Vice-Marshal Ralph Cochrane ordered that the Identification friend or foe (IFF) be got rid of in favour of the VHF Bomber Fixer. Despite bombing by day, navigation equipment was needed because of the north-west European climate; GEE and LORAN were to be carried along with high-altitude and low altitude radio altimeters. The recognition lights and some of the usual VHF equipment were to stay along with the rear guns and 6,000 rounds of ammunition. The bomb doors had to go as even the widened Tallboy bomb doors would not fit a Grand Slam and as the mid-upper gunner and wireless operator were redundant, the crew was cut to five men.

While carrying a Grand Slam, a Lancaster would be incapable of taking evasive action and Fishpond tail-warning radar went with the H2S set. As Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters were operating in northern Germany, an Automatic Gun-Laying Turret (AGLT; also, Village Inn or Z Equipment) was considered. The AGLT rear turret had been under test by the Bomber Development Unit and two Main Force squadrons of 1 Group, which found that they restricted the view of the rear-gunner; the radar gun laying device was also unable to discriminate between German fighters and friendly bombers. Bombers equipped with the turret only flew when not in the company of other Allied aircraft. The aircraft of several bomber groups had been fitted with AGLT transmitters which worked best as an early-warning device and the B.Mk.1 (Special)s were fitted with AGLT in the nose. With a fuel load of the Special would weigh and the first was delivered to RAF Woodhall Spa, the base of 617 Squadron in Lincolnshire, on 25 February. There were still arguments about what the Specials would carry, when it was found that Avro had failed to install GEE sets. It was agreed to remove the front turret and its accoutrements; heating was needed for the rear guns and the Stabilised Automatic Bomb Sight had Tallboy dropping equipment but no capacity to drop practice bombs, which needed to be incorporated. The TR1154 W/T was to be replaced by VHF R/T.

==Prelude==

=== B.Mk1 (Special) in flight ===
In March, Lancaster wheels and tyres were replaced by those of the heavier Avro Lincoln and the maximum weight of the Special was set at with a maximum landing weight of excepting emergencies. The commander of 617 Squadron, John &quot;Johnny&quot; Fauquier, ordered that if returning with a bomb, the Special would divert from Woodhall Spa and use the longer runway at RAF Carnaby near the coast at Bridlington in East Yorkshire. The centre of gravity when loaded with a Tallboy or Grand Slam was within the aircraft design limits, provided the rear turret was retained. Merlin 24 engines [ at 3,000 rpm, at 3,000 rpm, + boost at ] were to equip the Special, fitted with paddle-bladed propellers. Particular attention was to be paid to the skin of the wings and rear fuselage when checking the airframe and the Special would take off only from smooth runways and always with experienced pilots. Fuel was to be used from inboard tanks to outboard ones to relieve the stresses on the wings,

The Specials were to have day bomber camouflage, the black underside being painted in &quot;Sky&quot; a pale green shade with the upper surfaces keeping the usual dark green and dark earth. To discriminate between Tallboy and Grand Slam Lancasters, the Tallboy aircraft kept the code letters KC and the Specials were coded YZ.

=== Grand Slam handling ===
A Ransomes &amp; Rapier crane at the A&amp;AEE could lift the Grand Slam when on a concrete base and the Type H trolley was acceptable when limited to with its tyres at 80 PSI. The bomb cradle on the trolley was tilted up at the front to protect the bomb bay roof from damage by the tailfins of the bomb. The bomb was raised into the bomb bay by a crew of six men, who took 35 minutes. Templates were manufactured to help align the bomb in the bay, the front one proving unnecessary and being dispensed with; the rear template was hung from the bomb bay roof. The inside of the Special bomb bay was faired with quick-release panels from the bomb door hinges to the underneath of the fuselage floor to protect pipe-work.

The top of the bomb bay had metal plates installed, the forward bulkhead was faired to the contour of the nose of the Grand Slam and another fairing was fitted to the rearward bulkhead to smooth the airflow as the bomb exited the bay. The usual bomb bay switches were replaced by a master switch; a release cable and lever were fitted to the left-hand side of the cockpit for emergencies. The bomb was connected to the bay with a sprung dowel sticking out of the bomb bay roof and a Vickers release unit with metal links, which could be adjusted from within the aeroplane, wrapped around the bomb and released electrically or manually. Fuzing devices in the bomb bay roof worked for the Tallboy as well as the Grand Slam. The new bomb had a two-piece metal skirt between the bomb proper and the tail unit, whose front edge jutted out from the casing of the bomb. As the bomb fell, the slipstream could detach the tail unit of the bomb and the A&amp;AEE advised that it be redesigned.

The bomb dump at Woodhall Spa had been limited to forty Tallboys but room was made to accommodate ten Grand Slams by removing ordnance not in use. In February the A&amp;AEE used PB592/G, a Lancaster B.Mk1, to test loading the Grand Slam using the Type H bomb trolley, which had been designed for the Tallboy and Grand Slam. When the first bomb was moved with an Allen crane, its front wheels rose from the ground as the bomb was lifted and the bomb could not be lowered smoothly, only by unlocking and locking the brake, which dropped the bomb each time. The armourers used a US Bay City crane afterwards with a power-lowering unit added early in 1945.

=== Grand Slam test ===
The A&amp;AEE at RAF Boscombe Down had only one bomb to test, with 617 Squadron standing by with the rest, ready to commence operations. The bombing range at the Ashley Range in the New Forest had a concrete target about , to be bombed preferably from the optimum height of . PB955 was loaded with the Grand Slam to be flown by Group Captain H. A. (Bruin) Purvis; bad weather led to two failed attempts to bomb due to mist obscuring the target. On the third attempt, PB592/G, flown by Squadron Leader Headley (Hazel) Hazelden, managed to drop the bomb on 13 March. The aim of the crew was accurate for distance and observers saw the black and white painted bomb rotate as it fell, about off line to starboard. After release, the Grand Slam accelerated to , near supersonic, penetrating deep underground before detonating. The bomb exploded and left a crater in diameter and deep; 617 Squadron was phoned from a nearby pub and told of the success; formal permission to use the bomb was given on 22 March and operations began the same day.

==Grand Slam operations, 1945==

===Bielefeld, 14 March===

By mid-March 1945, over had been dropped on the Bielefeld viaduct in 54 attacks and damage from 17 hits in one raid was repaired in 24 hours. After an abortive attempt against viaducts at Arnsberg and Bielefeld on 9 March the bombers returned on 13 March, when 9 Squadron and 617 Squadron sent 19 Lancasters each against the same targets, two of the 617 Squadron aircraft carrying Grand Slams, escorted by 75 Mustang Mk IIIs (P-51Cs) from 11 Group. The attack at Arnsberg by 9 Squadron was called off after two aircraft bombed and 617 Squadron turned back from Bielefeld after 129 Squadron (Mustang Mk IIIs) reported unbroken cloud all the way to the target. On 14 March, fifteen Lancasters of 617 Squadron, carrying 14 Tallboys and a Grand Slam, all fuzed for 11 seconds&#x27; delay, tried again as fifteen 9 Squadron Lancasters made another attempt against the railway viaduct at Arnsberg. The weather was clear to the targets with some cloud around Bielefeld and a haze over both targets. Escorts from 11 Group consisted of 74 Mustang Mk IIIs and 8 (Pathfinder Force) Group provided four Oboe Mosquitos each from 105 and 109 squadrons to mark the targets. A Mosquito of 627 Squadron was present to film the attack.

The Lancasters of 617 Squadron flew around Bremen then found that there was cloud on the north side of Bielefeld forcing PD112 &quot;S&quot; with the Grand Slam to attack from the south after resetting the SABS, followed by the photographic Mosquito. One of the 105 Squadron Oboe Mosquitoes dropped four Target Indicator bombs which landed about to the south-south-west of the target. At and from , a far from ideal height, the Grand Slam fell from PD112 &quot;S&quot;, which jumped higher at the loss of weight. After 35 seconds, the bomb hit the ground about short and exploded the site erupting as the Tallboys came down. The pilot of the photographic aircraft, which recorded the attack from shouted &quot;You&#x27;ve done it!&quot;. The effect of the Grand Slam could not be distinguished from that of the eleven Tallboys but photographic reconnaissance by a Spitfire from 542 Squadron, following the bombers, then a Mosquito from 540 squadron later on, showed that of the north viaduct and of the south viaduct had been demolished, depositing about of rubble into the valley.

===Arnsberg, 15 March===
On 15 March, in a haze with some cloud over the target, two aircraft of 617 Squadron with Grand Slams fuzed for 11 seconds&#x27; delay and 14 Lancasters of 9 Squadron, carrying Tallboys, attacked the railway viaduct at Arnsberg again. A close fighter escort of 34 Mustang Mk IIIs was provided by 11 Group. A photographic Mosquito, KB433, was laid on by 627 Squadron and another 141 fighters were in the vicinity covering raids by 4, 6 and 8 Groups. The long viaduct, built from brick and stone faced with concrete, crossed the Ruhr in five spans. In poor visibility the crew of the photographic Mosquito saw that &quot;the whole force made one run into sun and one bomb seen to drop&quot;. This was the first Grand Slam, dropped from at 

The photographic crew reported, &quot;Second run into sun and one or two bombs fell. Individual runs then made. No direct hits seen. Majority of bombs fell to the east...&quot;. The second Grand Slam was brought home after several bomb runs because of the haze and the Lancaster, PB996, landed at the emergency bomber landing ground at RAF Manston. Ten Tallboys were also dropped with no effect and no aircraft were lost. On the return journey the port inner propeller of NG384 over-speeded and could not be feathered and then oil leaking out from behind the propeller caught fire and the pilot, Flight-Lieutenant F. A. Jones ordered the crew to abandon the aircraft south of the target. Four of the crew parachuted but then the fire went out and Jones force-landed at Gosselies near Charleroi.

===Arnsberg, 19 March===

On 19 March, 19 Lancasters of 617 Squadron, six with Grand Slams and 13 with Tallboys, attacked the viaduct again as 9 Squadron attacked the Vlotho rail bridge, in fairly cloudy weather at high altitude, with thin patches lower down. The bombers were escorted by 88 Mustang IIIs from 11 Group. PD329 &quot;Y&quot;, a Lancaster without bombs from 463 Squadron carried two cameramen from the RAF Film Unit accompanied 617 Squadron. A report from 129 Squadron, part of the escorting Mustang force, called the bomber formation tight but then the bombers flew into cloud at . The squadron flew over the Möhne Dam with its barrage balloons, smoke screen and anti-aircraft fire. The cameramen in PD329 &quot;Y&quot; had been briefed to film PB966 &quot;C&quot;, flown by Flight-Lieutenant P. H. Martin and formated on its starboard side, with a cameraman in the nose turret to film the Grand Slam as it fell away and the other on the floor of the fuselage filming vertically. Closer to the target, PD329 &quot;Y&quot; dropped back and flew on the port quarter of PB966 &quot;C&quot;.

The bomb was not to be dropped from under but Martin, the pilot, could not coax the bomber above . On its five-minute bombing run, Martin had to fly within the tolerances of its SABS bombsight, within of airspeed and +/- of altitude. The cameramen started filming and when the bomb dropped, PB966 &quot;C&quot; jumped higher. The bomb began its spin and came down on the western span, which disintegrated, along with the roofs of buildings nearby. All but one Lancaster of the first wave, whose Tallboy hung up, bombed. A second wave bombed fairly accurately but one Grand Slam fell off line due to a SABS fault. Two spans of the bridge, about long and one pier had been destroyed, the track on the west bank had been cut, of one of the embankments had been shoved out of line and the entrance to a tunnel on the east bank had been blocked; no damage had been caused to a Red Cross camp nearby. After the war the casings of a Grand Slam and a Tallboy were found at the site; the Grand Slam was thought to have landed flat on a road and only the explosive at the rear of the casing detonated; the Tallboy hit a wall, broke up and buried itself in the ground without going off.

===Arbergen, 21 March===

Twenty Lancasters of 617 Squadron, two carrying Grand Slams and the rest Tallboys, flew in good weather with little cloud to Bremen to attack the double-tracked railway bridge at Arbergen which crossed the Weser near Nienburg. The bridge was long with three steel girder spans. The railway approached the river from the south-west along an embankment until from the river where it crossed a meadow on a low-lying steel viaduct resting on piers. The bombers were escorted by twenty Mustang Mk IIIs of 306 (Polish) Squadron and 309 (Polish) Squadron. Another five fighter squadrons were provided to escort a day raid by 1 and 8 Groups on an oil refinery at Bremen; other Main Force aircraft attacked targets in Münster and Rheine.

The first Grand Slam was dropped from , landing short and the second fell off target to the north, due to flak (anti-aircraft fire) and aiming problems. The Tallboys hit the middle of the bridge and the ends were blown off their piers; the pier to the east collapsed onto the ground and the western pier was twisted and sagged to the ground at one place; part of the railway track, above the embankment and the first pier on the west side, was wrecked. One Lancaster was shot down near Okel and left a crater deep; five Lancasters were damaged by flak and an attack by a Me 262 jet fighter.

===Nienburg, 22 March===
Twenty Lancasters of 617 Squadron, six carrying Grand Slams fuzed for 25–30 seconds&#x27; delay and 14 with Tallboys with 25–35 seconds&#x27; or one-hour delay, attacked the railway bridge at Nienburg, between Bremen and Hanover, in atmospheric conditions ideal for bombing. A railway bridge at Bremen was attacked at the same time by 9 Squadron with Tallboys. The bombers were escorted by 114 Mustang Mk IIIs and 69 Spitfire Mk IXs from 11 Group squadrons. The Lancasters of 617 Squadron bombed within one minute, dropping five Grand Slams and twelve Tallboys. One Lancaster crew claimed a near miss with a Grand Slam and another crew claimed a hit,

It had been planned that the fourth and eight rows of Lancasters would not bomb on the first pass and Flight Lieutenant L. S. Goodman reported that on the second bomb run the bridge was under water, the spans having been broken or blown off their piers. A third Lancaster crew found that their bomb would not drop, despite two attempts and the bridge collapsed before the third try, leaving the crew to take it home. A fourth Grand Slam was reported to have hit the east end of the structure. Reconnaissance photographs showed that the bridge had been destroyed.

===Bremen, 23 March===
Another railway Bridge near Bremen was attacked later in the day by twenty 617 Squadron Lancasters, six carrying Grand Slams and 14 with Tallboys. The bridge at Bad Oeynhausen was attacked by 9 Squadron. The weather was clear and ideal for bombing but was also good for the Bremen anti-aircraft defences. The bombers were escorted by 41 Mustang Mk IIIs from 11 Group with seven more squadrons in the vicinity. A total of 128 Lancasters took part in the bombing from 1 Group and 5 Group, most accompanying 617 Squadron on the attack on the bridge at Bremen. The Germans started to generate a smoke screen but were too late; two hits were observed before the smoke screen and wreckage blocked the view. The pitch control on one of Lancaster PB996&#x27;s engines made the aircraft lose speed and its bomb was dropped on a jettison area; the pilot of PD112 decided to bomb despite the bomb-aimers clear vision panel being smashed by flak .

Three hits were claimed and one Tallboy hung up when the bomb aimer tried to drop it then fell off 15 seconds later, overshooting the bridge. Later analysis found that a Tallboy had landed on the bank at the south end of the bridge about from the abutment and the shock of the explosion shifted it, making the span fall into the river. A Tallboy hit the north end of the bridge, the damage being swiftly repaired; another to the south which was filled in and new track laid. Eventually the Germans demolished the bridge to create an obstacle to the Allied ground advance. Lancaster NG489 was hit by flak and the crew jettisoned the Grand Slam to regain control. Several other Lancasters were hit by anti-aircraft fire and four others were attacked by Me 262s, fifteen of which were seen on the flight to the target.

===Farge, 27 March===

Twenty Lancasters of 617 Squadron, 13 carrying Grand Slams, the remainder carrying Tallboys, attacked the Valentin submarine pens in clear visibility escorted by 90 Mustang Mk IIIs of 11 Group. Since October 1944, building work had been seen at Farge, a village on the Weser river, north of Vegesack and north-west of Bremen. The building had of the structure above ground and below, was long and wide, enclosing of space. The walls and roof were made of reinforced concrete with arched trusses on the walls, filled with concrete. The roof was about thick and was being reinforced to a thickness of . Farge was intended for the assembly of type XXI U-boats. The shipyard at Vegesack and the site of the building, was code named , construction beginning early in 1943. The site was chosen because it was on the convex side of a curve in the river less prone to silting; the river bed was dredged to a depth of to allow submarine sections in on barges and assembled U-boats out.

Production was expected to begin in March 1945, full production to be achieved in August; the schedule had slipped but production was to start within two months. One Lancaster had returned soon after take-off and another turned back over the target with engine-trouble, ditching the Grand Slam in the North Sea. Moderate to heavy flak was encountered by the gaggle of Lancasters but there was no fighter opposition. The bombs were dropped in about a minute and despite 1-hour delay fuzes, three bombs exploded immediately. Two of the fourteen hits on the pens were by Grand Slams and one by a Tallboy, the hits landing on the un-thickened part of the roof on the west side. The Grand Slams penetrated into the concrete causing about of the roof to fall in bringing down two moveable cranes. The thickened part of the roof and a periscope-testing tower were also damaged. One bomb damaged power stations, concrete mixing facilities and shelters on the north side. Marines who had been inside the building reported later that there was a huge concussive effect, which severely depressed their morale; no aircraft were lost.

===Hamburg, 9 April===
Seventeen Lancasters from 617 Squadron were dispatched to bomb the Finkenwerder U-boat pens in Hamburg, two with Grand Slams and the rest with Tallboys. The pens were inside a -building with a roof thick, reinforced by steel beams and trusses. Forty Lancasters from 5 Group were to bomb oil storage tanks nearby. The weather was clear with some haze, a thin layer of cirrus clouds above the city but the visibility was very good. A fighter escort from 11 Group consisted of 120 Mustang Mk III, 30 Mustang Mk IV, 59 Spitfire Mk IX and 24 Spitfire Mk XVI to counter any attempts by Me 262 jets to intervene. fighters, including jets, attempted to intercept the formation and there was much flak, which damaged six Lancasters before they bombed. Buildings to the north and west were hit and a reconnaissance photograph showed seven hits, four penetrating the roof.

A post-war report recorded six hits by Tallboys, the two Grand Slams and the other Tallboys landing in the water. The six Tallboys had penetrated the roof part way, hit girders and exploded, blowing holes through the ceiling and depositing hundreds of tons of concrete into the pens. There had been 3,000 people inside the pens, fewer than usual, because it was Poets Day, when German workers left at ; 27 people were killed, about sixty were seriously injured and a panic ensued; U-906 and U-1192 were damaged. About thirty Me 262s appeared and 467 Squadron RAAF, on the oil tanks raid, accelerated and turned, ending up bumping along behind the 617 Squadron slipstream. The Mustangs jettisoned their drop tanks and 122 Squadron bounced the German jets which raced away. The Polish 306, 309 and 315 squadrons attacked the jets and claimed three Me 262s shot down and three damaged; two Lancasters were shot down.

===Heligoland, 19 April===

The coastal gun batteries on the islands of Heligoland and Düne in the Heligoland Bight, the south-eastern extremity of the North Sea, were attacked on 19 April. The military installations on the main island comprised a radar installation covering the Elbe and Weser rivers, an airfield and a coastal battery each with and guns. To ensure that Allied ships could enter the Elbe and Weser estuaries, Bomber Command intended to attack the island with bombs but at least forty heavy anti-aircraft guns on the islands had to be silenced. The gun positions had a diameter of about and only hits or near misses would be effective. On 18 April, 969 bombers had attacked the anti-aircraft guns but some remained operational. On 19 April, 20 Lancasters of 617 Squadron attacked with six Grand Slams and fourteen Tallboys; 16 Lancasters from 9 Squadron carried Tallboys fuzed for 25 seconds&#x27; delay.

A Mosquito from the RAF Film Unit accompanied the raiders and a fighter escort was provided by 11 Group and 12 Group, consisting of 11 Mustang Mk IIIs, 42 Spitfire Mk IXs and 26 Spitfire XVIs. The gun emplacements were at the north and south ends of the island and three aiming points were chosen, two for 9 Squadron and one for 617 Squadron. Thin stratocumulus cloud was encountered from and six of the 9 Squadron bombers were to act as wind finders, the results being broadcast to the rest of the squadron at H minus 5. As 9 Squadron flew towards the island, they were surprised to see 617 Squadron attacking, climbed to keep out of the way and circled while waiting for their fighter escort. The attack by 617 Squadron was made in two waves against hardly any anti-aircraft fire and all bar one aircraft bombed. Photographic evidence showed two hits on aiming point H and several near misses, which added to the damage. Another attack by the Main Force was planned but the war ended before it took place.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===
In 1991, Alan Cooper wrote that during March 1945, 156 day-sorties were flown, 31 with Grand Slams and 40 with Tallboys. An analysis of the bombing accuracy of 617 Squadron and 9 Squadron on Tallboy sorties found that, using different bomb sights and bombing from heights between , 1 per cent of the Tallboys dropped by 617 Squadron were gross errors [defined as missing the aiming point by more than ] against 10 per cent of the Tallboys dropped by 9 Squadron. Unlike the Tallboy, the Grand Slam was designed to penetrate concrete roofs and was more effective against fortifications than earlier bombs. By the end of the war, 41 Grand Slams had been dropped on operations although in 2004, Stephen Flower wrote of 42 bombs, a figure he repeated in his 2013 publication. in 1947 Sir Arthur Harris wrote,

In 2013, Stephen Flower wrote that when dropped on buildings fortified with reinforced concrete the Grand Slam tended to break up on impact or go off too soon. Flower wrote that it was not surprising that the Grand Slam was limited in effect when dropped on concrete, when it was designed to fall on earth and then explode under the foundations of buildings, creating a for the structure to subside into. The Grand Slam and Tallboy bombs did cause damage that conventional bombs were incapable of and had a great disruptive effect on the means of resistance available to the Germans, limiting the development of new weapons with which to continue the war. In 2013, Stephen Flower wrote that the earthquake bombs rarely caused mass civilian casualties and were the most effective bombs used in the war, until the advent of atomic bombs later in 1945.

===Operation Front Line/Project Ruby===
Beginning in March 1946, Operation Front Line (British title) / Project Ruby (US title), was a plan to investigate the use of penetration bombs against reinforced concrete targets. The U-boat pens near Bremen were chosen, having been abandoned after the attack on 27 March 1945. Since 9 Squadron and 617 Squadron had been transferred to the Far East to join Tiger Force, Grand Slams were carried by Lancasters from 15 Squadron, into whose C Flight, the 617 Squadron crews not sent abroad were moved with their B.Mk 1 (Specials) and their SABS bomb sights. The Watten bunker, in the Pas de Calais, which has been used for Royal Navy Disney bomb tests, was bombed with Grand Slams.

In May 1946, Operation Front Line began with the participation of US B-29 bombers. Tallboy and Grand Slams were dropped on the pens and Heligoland; only two hits were achieved from thirteen bombings. The RAF and USAAF reports concluded that none of the bombs were effective against reinforced concrete and suggested more tests in 1947. The tests were resumed after 15 Squadron had finished dropping fifteen bombs on a battleship for the RN. The squadron was down to six Lancasters, four being B.Mk 1 (Special)s, not capable of carrying the bombs being tested. The other two could carry the bomb but 15 Squadron was re-equipping with Avro Lincolns and six of these were to be altered to carry SABS and radar altimeters. Three USAF B-29s participated again to drop the bombs from which was above the ceiling of the SABS.
The B-29s were also to drop the new US Amazon II and Samson bombs, both , in Operation Ruby II, later called the Harker Project. Photographs taken by 542 Squadron, a photographic reconnaissance unit, before the Grand Slam attack during the war were used to stake out the target with red flags and cameras were set up to film the drops. On 4 August the B-29s achieved six bomb hits from and five Amazon II hits out of fifteen from . From 20 September, 15 Squadron Lincolns dropped the bomb and achieved seven hits, some of which broke on the roof. Tests with a obtained three hits out of seven.

===Examples===

Five Grand Slam bombs are preserved and displayed in Britain at the RAF Museum, London, Brooklands Museum, RAF Lossiemouth, Dumfries and Galloway Aviation Museum and the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Visitors&#x27; Centre at RAF Coningsby. Casings, without their tails, can be seen at the Kelham Island Museum in Sheffield and Yorkshire Air Museum at Elvington. The T-12 Cloudmaker is an American-made variant of the Grand Slam and an example is displayed at the Air Force Armament Museum in the United States.

<doc id="995831" wikidata="Q1137545" url="?curid=995831" title="Elías Piña Province">
<text>Elías Piña () is one of the 32 provinces of the Dominican Republic, located in the westernmost part of the country, along the border with Haiti. It is divided into 6 municipalities and its capital city is Comendador. The Cordillera Central (&quot;Central mountain chain&quot;) is found in the northern part of the province, and the Sierra de Neiba runs across the southern half. Between those two mountain ranges, there are several valleys formed by the Artibonite River and its tributaries.

It was created on 1942 with the name &quot;San Rafael&quot;. In 1965, its name was changed to &quot;Estrelleta&quot; and, finally, in 1972 it got its current name. It was a &quot;municipio&quot; of the San Juan province before being elevated to the category of province.

==Location==

Elías Piña is a landlocked province in the central mountainous region of Hispaniola. The province is bordered by the Dajabón and Santiago Rodríguez provinces to the north, the San Juan province to the east, the Independencia province to the south and the Republic of Haiti to the west.

==History==
The region occupied by the current Elías Piña province was sparsely populated. The main settlement founded during the early colonial era was Bánica, at the eastern end of the Ocean, an area of extensive savannas. The town was founded in 1504 by the Spanish conquistador Diego Velázquez on the left side of the River Artibonite. It was an important town in those years but later it lost its importance. In the 18th century, the Spanish government moved the city to its present place, away from the river, and brought families from the Canary Islands to live there.

The towns of Comendador and Hondo Valle originated from border military posts established after national independence. All the rest of the current province was practically depopulated until after the Restoration War when families from other parts of the country began to arrive. During the Dominican-Haitian War (1844–1856), Haitian troops crossed this region, which led to several battles, including the confrontations to dominate the Cachimán fort and, especially, the Battle of La Estrelleta.

After the Independence in 1844, the town was elevated by the Dominican government to the category of municipality of the Azua province, but again the town was abandoned by its inhabitants. After the &quot;Restoration War&quot; (1863–1865), some families from other towns close to the Haitian border came to live in Bánica.

The town of Bánica was the first place where Dominican President Rafael Trujillo implemented his campaign against the Haitians, later known as the Parsley Massacre. The territory belonged to the province of Azua until it became part of the province of Benefactor (now San Juan) when said province was created in 1938. Within the plans of &quot;Dominicanization of the border&quot; of the dictator Rafael Leónidas Trujillo, the province of Elias Pina was officially created in 1942.

===Origin of name===
Colonel Elías Piña was an officer of the Dominican army during the Dominican War of Independence. He was born in La Margarita, close to Comendador and died in 1845 when he was attacking a fortified position in Bánica.

==Municipalities==
In the province, there are six municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and seven municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot;) within them. The municipalities and its municipal districts (M.D.) are:

* Comendador, head municipality of the province
** Guayabo (M.D.)
** Sabana Larga (M.D.)
* Bánica
** Sabana Cruz (M.D.)
** Sabana Higüero (M.D.)
* El Llano
** Guanito (M.D.)
* Hondo Valle
** Rancho de la Guardia (M.D.)
* Juan Santiago
* Pedro Santana
** Río Limpio (M.D.)

==Population==
The following is a sortable table of the municipalities and municipal districts with population figures as of the 2014 estimate. Urban population are those living in the seats (&quot;cabeceras&quot; literally heads) of municipalities or of municipal districts. Rural population are those living in the districts (&quot;Secciones&quot; literally sections) and neighborhoods (&quot;Parajes&quot; literally places) outside them. The population figures are from the 2014 population estimate.


==Geography==

The province can be divided into three large physiographic regions: the Sierra de Neiba to the south, the Cordillera Central to the north, and the central part, part of the Artibonite basin and its tributaries. This central part consists of small valleys separated by low hills. The highest mountain is the La Tasajera del Chivito, with 2179 m, on the northern slope of the Sierra de Neiba.

==Climate==
The climate of the province is a tropical climate, hot most of the year, but it is cooler on the mountains.

==Rivers==
The main river is the Artibonite that, in some places, marks the Dominican-Haitian border. Other rivers are Macasías, Tocino, Joca and Vallecito, all of them tributaries of the Artibonite.

== Economy ==
As in all border provinces in the Dominican Republic, there is little economic development. The trade with Haiti is important, above all in Comendador. On the mountains, coffee and beans are important products. Potatoes are also produced in the south (Sierra de Neiba).

<doc id="995834" wikidata="Q21555721" url="?curid=995834" title="Markopoulo, Cephalonia">
<text>Markopoulo () is a village and a community in the southeastern part of the island of Cephalonia, Greece. It is situated at the southeastern foot of Mount Ainos, at about 250 m elevation. The community consists of the villages Markopoulo, Kateleios and the beach village Kato Kateleios. Markopoulo is located 1 km east of Chionata, 2 km west of Kateleios, 2 km northwest of Kato Kateleios, 6 km west of Skala and 9 km southwest of Poros.

==Historical population==

== History, agriculture, tourism ==
Stone Age remains have been found nearby in the Sakkos cave, in Skala and in the Mounda Bay area. At nearby Mavrata there is a tomb from the Mycenaean period while Roman remains visible just behind the main Agia Barbara beach indicate settlement in Kateleios over 2000 years ago. Although Mounda Bay is very shallow there is also some evidence that Kateleios was a port and trading centre during the Venetian period, witnessed by the remains of an old pier or mole in the bay.

Like virtually all of Kefalonia (except the Fiskardo area), the villages were destroyed during the 1953 Ionian earthquake and have been rebuilt since. Remains of the old church bell-tower exist in Kateleios. Until quite recently Kato Kateleios was a small collection of fishermen&#x27;s houses and huts, some of which are still inhabited, and the main town was further up in the valley, at Ano Katelios. Tourism development in recent years saw the construction of restaurants, homes, and rented apartments near the sea-front, which is now considered to be the main settlement of Katelios.

The bay of Katelios is a designated marine Natura 2000 site. Due to the shallow waters of the bay and the scattered reef outcrops, the flow of sea water is slower than surrounding waters, making it an ideal habitat for the protected sea grass &quot;Posidonia oceanica&quot;, which occupies a significant portion of the bay. The beach of Mounda, on the east of the bay and at a short distance from Katelios is a nesting area for the Loggerhead turtles (&quot;Caretta caretta&quot;). Sea turtle nests in this area have been monitored and protected since 1988, while an environmental station operates at the town&#x27;s old school.

Katelios is the only area on the island of Kefalonia with a river that has water flowing throughout the year. The small river flows from the hills around the area of Pastra. Until the middle 19th century, water mills were in regular use, and their remnants can still be seen between Pastra and Katelios.

<text>William Pepper Jr. (August 21, 1843July 28, 1898), was an American physician, medical educator, and the eleventh Provost of the University of Pennsylvania from 1881 to 1894. He was an advocate for the establishment of a university affiliated hospital and led the finance and building committees for the construction of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in 1874. As provost, he oversaw a major expansion of the University including the construction of 13 campus buildings, the addition of the Wharton School of Business, and eleven new departments. In 1891, he founded the Free Library of Philadelphia.

==Early life and education==
Pepper was born in Philadelphia to Dr. William Pepper Sr. and Sarah Platt. He was educated at the University of Pennsylvania and graduated with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree as valedictorian in 1862 and from the medical school in 1864.

He received a LL.D. degree from Lafayette College in 1881 and from the University of Pennsylvania in 1893.

==Career==
He worked as an apothecary and a resident physician at Pennsylvania Hospital. He was appointed pathologist at Pennsylvania hospital in 1866, visiting physician at the Blockley Almshouse, and curator of the Philadelphia hospital after the resignation of David Hayes Agnew.

In 1868 Pepper became lecturer on morbid anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. He lectured on clinical medicine from 1870 to 1874 and on physical diagnosis from 1871 to 1873. From 1876 to 1887, he was professor of clinical medicine at Penn and in 1887 succeeded Dr Alfred Stillé as professor of theory and practice of medicine.

Pepper founded the &quot;Philadelphia Medical Times&quot; and was editor of that journal in 1870 and 1871. He was an advocate for the establishment of a university hospital and was named chairman of the finance committee. Through his efforts, a site was selected and money for building and an endowment were established in May 1872. He was named chairman of the building committee and The University of Pennsylvania Hospital construction was completed in July 1874.

He was elected the eleventh provost of the University of Pennsylvania in 1881 and remained in that position until 1894. He oversaw the growth of Penn into a modern university. Under his leadership the school grew from 42 faculty members, 1,044 students in 5 schools to 245 faculty members, 2,680 students in 9 schools. He implemented the Wharton School of Business and the Graduate School of Arts and Science.

He oversaw the construction of thirteen new buildings on campus and the creation of twelve new departments including:
*The Department of Archaeology &amp; Paleontogy
*The Department of Biology
*The Department of Finance and Economy
*The Department of Hygiene
*The Department of Philosophy
*The Department of Physical Education
*The Graduate Department for Women
*The School for Nurses in the University Hospital
*The School of Architecture
*The Veterinary Hospital
*The Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology

He was an advocate for the sponsorship of original scientific research at the University of Pennsylvania. He established the Library of Hygiene in 1892 and partially funded the Laboratory of Clinical Medicine which was named The William Pepper Laboratory of Clinical Medicine in honor of his father.

In 1893, Pepper was part of the executive committee for the first Pan-American Medical Congress. For his services as medical director of the United States Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876, he was made Knight Commander of Saint Olaf by King Oscar II of Sweden.

Pepper was the founder of Philadelphia&#x27;s first free public library, chartered in 1891 through funds provided by the estate of his late uncle, which became the Free Library of Philadelphia, today the city&#x27;s multi-branch public library system. He founded the University of Pennsylvania Archeological Museum in 1887 and the Wistar Institute in 1894. He sponsored the Pepper-Hearst expedition (1895–1897) on the Gulf coast of Florida, near Tarpon Springs. He was a member of the American Philosophical Society and a fellow in the College of Physicians.
Pepper was known academically for his contributions to the theory and practice of medicine and the &quot;System of Medicine&quot; that he edited in 1885-86 became one of America&#x27;s standard medical textbooks. He died of heart disease while traveling in Pleasanton, California, on July 28, 1898. His body was returned to Philadelphia where he was cremated and his ashes interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

==Personal life==
He married Frances Sergent Perry, the granddaughter of Oliver Hazard Perry, in 1873 and together they had three children.

==Legacy==
After his death, by request in his will, his brain was donated to the American Anthropometric Society. In 1907, Edward Anthony Spitzka published a paper of his analysis of six brains at the American Anthropometric Society, including Pepper&#x27;s.

A bronze statue of Pepper by Karl Bitter stands on the south side of College Hall at the University of Pennsylvania. A replica of this stands on the landing of the main staircase of the Free Library of Philadelphia. In addition, a marble bust - also by Bitter - rests on a wooden base in the Edwin A. Fleisher Collection of Orchestral Music at the Free Library of Philadelphia.

<text>El Seibo (), alternatively spelt El Seybo, is a province of the Dominican Republic. Before 1992 it included what is now Hato Mayor province.

==History==
El Seibo was founded in 1502 by Juan de Esquivel, a notable a Spanish conquistadir. The name of Santa Cruz de El Seibo, is taken from the Spanish custom of placing the Cross of Christ at the cardinal points, as protection against evils. A cross called Asomante is still preserved, in the West Sector of the city of El Seibo.

The name of Seibo comes from a tribal chief of the Taíno race, who was called Seebo. This Seebo was a regional leader, and subject to the provisions of the Chiefdom de Higuey: Cayacoha. By 1504, the Spaniards Juan Briceño and Francisco Almenara appear as residents of the area, paying the fifth to the Real Caja del Rey.

A relevant event for the achievement of Spanish interests occurred in Hidalga Villa de Santa Cruz de Hicayagua, at the time of the reconquest: the Battle of Palo Hincado. This battle took place in what is today kilometer 3.5 of the El Seibo-Hato Mayor highway, on November 7, 1808, the troops of Napoleon Bonaparte, French Emperor, and an army of Creoles under the command of General Juan Sánchez Ramírez.

==Politics==
In the 2020 elections, one senator and three deputies were elected for the province. The senator is Santiago José Zorrilla from the Modern Revolutionary Party (PRM). The deputies are Kenia Milagros Mejía Mercedes of the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD), Juan Maldonado Castro (PRD), and Juan Roberto Rodríguez Hernández (PRD).

==Municipalities and municipal districts==
The province as of June 20, 2006 is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot; - M.D.) within them:

#Santa Cruz de El Seibo, head municipality of the province
##Pedro Sánchez (M.D.)
##San Francisco-Vicentillo (M.D.)
##Santa Lucía (M.D.)
#Miches
##El Cedro (M.D.)
##La Gina (M.D.)

The following is a sortable table of the municipalities and municipal districts with population figures as of the 2014 estimate. Urban population are those living in the seats (&quot;cabeceras&quot;, literally heads) of municipalities or of municipal districts. Rural population are those living in the districts (&quot;secciones&quot;, literally sections) and neighborhoods (&quot;Pparajes&quot;, literally places) outside them. The population figures are from the 2014 population estimate.
For comparison with the municipalities and municipal districts of other provinces see the list of municipalities and municipal districts of the Dominican Republic.

<doc id="995842" wikidata="Q45435667" url="?curid=995842" title="Folinic acid">
<text>Folinic acid, also known as leucovorin, is a medication used to decrease the toxic effects of methotrexate and pyrimethamine. It is also used in combination with 5-fluorouracil to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer, may be used to treat folate deficiency that results in anemia, and methanol poisoning. It is taken by mouth, injection into a muscle, or injection into a vein.
Side effects may include trouble sleeping, allergic reactions, or fever. Use in pregnancy or breastfeeding is generally regarded as safe. When used for anemia it is recommended that pernicious anemia as a cause be ruled out first. Folinic acid is a form of folic acid that does not require activation by dihydrofolate reductase to be useful to the body.
Folinic acid was first made in 1945. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

== Medical use ==

Folinic acid can be taken as a pill (orally) or injected into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly).

=== To reduce effects of methotrexate===
Folinic acid is given following methotrexate as part of a total chemotherapeutic plan, where it may protect against bone marrow suppression or gastrointestinal mucosa inflammation. No apparent effect is seen on pre-existing methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity. 

While not specifically an antidote for methotrexate, folinic acid may also be useful in the treatment of acute methotrexate overdose. Different dosing protocols are used, but folinic acid should be redosed until the methotrexate level is less than 5 x 10−8 M.

Additionally, folinic acid is sometimes used to reduce the side effects of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis patients. This includes reductions in nausea, abdominal pain, abnormal liver blood tests, and mouth sores.

=== Other uses or indications ===
Folinic acid is also used in combination with the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil in treating colon cancer. In this case, folinic acid is not used for &quot;rescue&quot; purposes; rather, it enhances the effect of 5-fluorouracil by inhibiting thymidylate synthase.

Folinic acid is also sometimes used to prevent toxic effects of high doses of antimicrobial dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors such as trimethoprim and pyrimethamine, although its value for this indication has not been clearly established. It may be prescribed in the treatment of toxoplasmosis retinitis, in combination with the folic acid antagonists pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine.

Folinic acid is also used in the treatment of cerebral folate deficiency, a syndrome in which the use of folic acid cannot normalize cerebrospinal fluid levels of 5-MTHF.

In pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, folinic acid may be used as additional therapy if pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate fails to fully control the seizures.

== Side effects ==
Folinic acid should not be administered intrathecally. This may produce severe adverse effects or even death. Severe neurotoxicity due to intrathecal folinic acid as treatment for intrathecally-administered methotrexate was first noted in an 11-year-old boy being treated for acute lymphocytic leukemia 

In cancer patients, rare hypersensitivity reactions to folinic acid have been described.

== Drug interactions ==
Fluorouracil: Folinic acid may increase the toxicity associated with fluorouracil if the two are administered together. Some adverse effects that have occurred, particularly in elderly patients, include severe enterocolitis, diarrhea, and dehydration.

Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim: A potential drug interaction exists with concomitant use of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folinic acid. Folinic acid has been shown to decrease the efficacy of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim in the treatment of &quot;Pneumocystis jirovecii&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Pneumocystis carinii&quot;), a common cause of pneumonia in AIDS patients.

== Mechanism of action ==
Folinic acid is a 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid. It is readily converted to other reduced folic acid derivatives (e.g., 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate), thus has vitamin activity equivalent to that of folic acid. Since it does not require the action of dihydrofolate reductase for its conversion, its function as a vitamin is unaffected by inhibition of this enzyme by drugs such as methotrexate. This is the classical view of folinic acid rescue therapy. In 1980s, however, folinic acid was found to reactivate the dihydrofolate reductase itself even when methotrexate exists.

Although the mechanism is not very clear, the polyglutamylation of methotrexate and dihydrofolate in malignant cells is considered to play an important role in the selective reactivation of dihydrofolate reductase by folinic acid in normal cells.

Folinic acid, therefore, allows for some purine/pyrimidine synthesis to occur in the presence of dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, so some normal DNA replication processes can proceed.

Folinic acid has dextro- and levorotary isomers. Both levoleucovorin (the levorotary isomer) and racemic folinic acid (a mixture of both isomers) have similar efficacy and tolerability. Levoleucovorin was approved by the FDA in 2008.

== History ==
Folinic acid was discovered as a needed growth factor for the bacterium &quot;Leuconostoc citrovorum&quot; in 1948, by Sauberlich and Baumann. This resulted in it being called &quot;citrovorum factor,&quot; meaning citrovorum growth factor. It had an unknown structure, but was found to be a derivative of folate that had to be metabolized in the liver before it could support growth of &quot;L. citrovorum.&quot; The synthesis of citrovorum factor by liver cells in culture was eventually accomplished from pteroylglutamic acid in the presence of suitable concentrations of ascorbic acid. The simultaneous addition of sodium formate to such systems resulted in increased citrovorum factor activity in the cell-free supernatants (producing, as now known, the 5-formyl derivative), and from this method of preparation of large amounts of the factor, its structure as levo-folinic acid (5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid) was eventually deduced.

==Names==
Folinic acid should be distinguished from folic acid (vitamin B9). However, folinic acid is a vitamer for folic acid and has the full vitamin activity of this vitamin. Levofolinic acid and its salts are the 2S-form of the molecule. They are the only forms of the molecule that are known to be biologically active.

It is generally administered as the calcium or sodium salt (calcium folinate (INN), sodium folinate, leucovorin calcium, leucovorin sodium).

<text>Daniel &#x27;Dani&#x27; Mallo Castro (born 25 January 1979) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

The better part of his senior career was spent at Deportivo, where he served almost exclusively as third choice in the first team, and Girona. Over eight seasons, he appeared in 152 matches in the Segunda División.

==Club career==
Born in Cambre, Galicia, Mallo spent most of his career as third-string goalkeeper with local Deportivo de La Coruña, having a loan stint at Segunda División team Elche CF in the 2003–04 season. He first appeared with the main squad of the former on 4 May 2003, playing 20 minutes in a 5–0 home win over Recreativo de Huelva.

Mallo joined Portugal&#x27;s S.C. Braga for 2006–07 after being released. Because of injury to first choice Paulo Santos, he started the first half of the following campaign, also featuring for the club in the Portuguese and UEFA Cups.

In late January 2009, after having spent the first months of the new season training separately, Mallo joined Falkirk until the end of the season. He played in the Scottish Cup final, also helping the side to the semi-finals of the domestic League Cup and a final maintenance in the Scottish Premier League; despite these achievements, he did not sign a new contract and left the club on 27 June, stating he needed to move on.

In July 2009, Mallo turned down a move to join former manager John Hughes at Hibernian FC, opting to return to Spain and sign with Girona FC in the country&#x27;s second division. In his first year he deputised for former FC Barcelona&#x27;s Albert Jorquera, and played understudy to Roberto Santamaría in the following campaign, becoming the starter subsequently.

On 30 June 2016, after a further three years in the second tier with CD Lugo and Albacete Balompié, being relegated in the last one, the 37-year-old Mallo moved to the Indian Super League, joining three compatriots (including manager José Francisco Molina, his former Deportivo teammate) at Atlético de Kolkata.

==Personal life==
Cambre&#x27;s municipal ground was named after Mallo.

<text>Colin Addison (born 18 May 1940) is an English former professional footballer and manager.

Born in Taunton, Somerset, Addison started his playing career with York City before moving to Nottingham Forest, Arsenal and Sheffield United. His managerial career started when he took the post of player-manager of Hereford United in 1971 during their famous 1971–72 FA Cup run, which saw them defeat Newcastle United.

Since then Addison has managed a wide variety of clubs in the UK, as well as in Spain, South Africa, Kuwait and Qatar.

==Playing career==
Addison was born in Taunton but brought up in York. He joined York City as an amateur and turned professional in May 1957.

In his second season, he scored 10 league goals helped York win promotion to the recently created Third Division, and midway through the 1960–61 season he was transferred to First Division side Nottingham Forest for £12,000, a then-record fee for City.

Addison was a regular at the City Ground scoring 62 goals in 160 league appearances, before being signed by Bertie Mee&#x27;s Arsenal in 1966 for £45,000. His time at Highbury was hampered by injury and, after scoring an average of 1 goal in every 3 games for the Gunners, he was sold to First Division side Sheffield United at the end of the 1967 season.

Addison joined United on the recommendation of assistant manager Andy Beattie who he had played with whilst at Nottingham Forest, signing for £40,000. Signed as a centre forward and provide goals, he remained a first-team regular until the 1971 season where, when he opted to move into management, joining leading non-league side Hereford United as player-manager.

==Managerial career==

===Player-Manager===
Addison arrived at Hereford United in October 1971, succeeding the legendary John Charles as player-manager. He inherited a strong group of players which he led through the club&#x27;s famous giant-killing FA Cup run and ultimately election to the Football League.

In the Second Round, Addison and his team needed two replays to get past Northampton Town but it was worth the effort as a trip to top-flight Newcastle United awaited. After going 2–1 down in the tie, it was Addison who hit the 25-yard equaliser to take the Magpies to the return fixture at Edgar Street.

In front of a capacity crowd and on a quagmire of a pitch, Addison and Hereford won 2–1 after extra time with Radford and George scoring. They went on to take West Ham United to another replay in the Fourth Round before eventually losing 3–1 at Boleyn Ground.

Hereford were elected to the Football League at the end of Addison&#x27;s first season as a manager, and the success continued the following season when Hereford finished as runners-up in Division Four.

=== Management at the Touchline ===
Addison carried on playing until November 1973, but with a broken leg, he proceeded as manager until 1974 when he left to manage South African side Durban City F.C. To mark his achievements at Hereford, an area north of the Edgar Street football ground was named &quot;Addison Court&quot; in his honour.

He returned to England in December 1975, joining Notts County as assistant to Ronnie Fenton. His next managerial position was at Newport County achieving the &#x27;Great Escape&#x27; of the 1976–77 season before he returned to West Bromwich Albion as assistant manager to Ron Atkinson.

After two seasons in charge at Derby County Addison departed in 1982, returning to Newport County where he led the team to their highest post-war league finish in the 1982–83 season. In May 1985 Addison left the Welsh side, moving to Qatar to guide Al-Ahli to second position in the Qatari league. Subsequently, Addison took the reins in Spain, where he took Celta Vigo into &#x27;La Liga&#x27; First Division in his first season in charge.

A second spell at West Bromwich Albion as assistant manager to Ron Atkinson followed, before he and Ron departed for Atlético Madrid in October 1988. However, Atkinson left Los Colchoneros after only two months, with Addison taking over the leadership of the club. Addison departed Atlético Madrid leaving the capital&#x27;s side 5th in La Liga First Division, moving to Cádiz CF where he garnered a string of victories to ensure Cadiz&#x27;s position in La Liga First Division. Addison then moved to Kuwait where he won the league with Al-Arabi, finishing above second-placed team managed by Felipe Scolari. Returning to the UK, Addison once again took up the reins at Hereford United.

Further management callings in the UK followed, with a succession of clubs including Yeovil Town, Swansea City and Conference National side Forest Green Rovers, leading the club to what was their highest ever league finish, at the time. He was manager of Scarborough in the 1998–99 season, when goalkeeper Jimmy Glass scored an astonishing and memorable goal for Carlisle United, which changed the course of the season in the dying minutes, subsequently relegating Scarborough.

==Personal life==
Addison currently resides in the city of Hereford, and was a pundit on BBC Radio Wales until 2008.

He has operated as commentator and pundit on Spanish Football for Sky Sports, and as experienced FA Cup player and manager, as commentator and pundit for ESPN.

Addison acts as commentator and football advisor across the UK and Europe.

He also consults for clubs and media entities in Spain, USA and Asia.

<doc id="995856" wikidata="Q5338166" url="?curid=995856" title="Edinburgh City Bypass">
<text>The Edinburgh City Bypass, designated as A720, is one of the most important trunk roads in Scotland. Circling around the south of Edinburgh, as the equivalent of a ring road for the coastal city, it links together the A1 towards north-east England, the A702 towards north-west England, the M8 through the Central Belt towards Glasgow, the A7 through south-east Scotland and north-west England as well as the A8 leading to the M9 for Stirling and the Queensferry Crossing.

The road is dual carriageway standard throughout, including emergency laybys and hard shoulders in areas. The road is classed as a special road in legal terms. Every motorway in the UK is termed a special road in that specific regulations govern its use. Not every special road is classed as a motorway and this bypass is one of those roads.

The A720 forms part of European route E15, which runs from Inverness, in northern Scotland, to Algeciras, in southern Spain. North of Gogar, the E15 runs towards the A90 and the Queensferry Crossing; and south of Old Craighall on the A1.

==History==
A720 was built in sections between 1980 and 1989. The first section built was the Colinton section (A702 to Baberton) opened in 1981, with the Dreghorn junction opening circa 1985. Next up was the Sighthill section (Baberton to A8 at Gogarburn) which opened in late 1986. 1988 saw two sections open: the Burdiehouse section (A702 to A701) in the summer followed in the autumn by the section between the A68 at Sheriffhall and the A1 at Old Craighall. The last section was completed in 1989 around the Gilmerton junction.

==Junctions==
The A720 starts at the Old Craighall junction in the east where it meets the A1, from which traffic can approach Edinburgh city centre from the east, or run past Musselburgh and Haddington on the way to England.

===Junction 1: Millerhill===
This junction comes shortly after the eastern start of the A720, which was completed in 2008 as the Dalkeith Northern Bypass of the A68. This is a crucial route for traffic to south-east Scotland.

In 2013 the road between Millerhill and Sheriffhall was temporarily diverted for the construction of a new underbridge serving the rebuilt Edinburgh-Galashiels railway line, as the original railway had been closed and was built over when the bypass was built.

===Junction 2: Sheriffhall Roundabout===
About further is the most congested junction on the bypass. Whereas all the other junctions on the bypass are grade separated, Sheriffhall is a traffic-light controlled roundabout and the traffic problems of forcing all through A720 traffic to halt is worsened by the importance of the roads which intersect here – the A7 which leads north to the city centre and south to Carlisle, the former A68 which now leads to Dalkeith and the A68, and the A6106. Traffic jams are common at most times of day. The junction was not built with grade separation because of a geological fault that crosses the bypass here, and the area having (at the time) active coal mining.
In 2015, an upgrade for the Sheriffhall Junction was prepared, with four options for grade separation. In 2020, plans to add a grade-separated through route were costed at £120 million. The project was criticised by the Scottish Greens, who stated that it would induce demand. The flyover is expected to open in 2027, but is still subject to controversy.

===Junction 3: Gilmerton===
This is a small junction which is for the A772, that used to be the A7 until the mid-1990s. This road leads to Cameron Toll shopping centre as well as the A701 and the city centre. There is evidence that western slip-roads were considered at the roundabout to join the A772. This junction offers only connections to and from the west on the A720.

===Junction 4: Lasswade===
Just shortly after the Gilmerton junction, comes the Lasswade junction. Like the Gilmerton junction, this junction offers only connections to and from the west on the A720.

===Junction 5: Straiton===
This junction includes access to Straiton Retail Park, Costco, and IKEA. This junction also provides access to the A701 and southern suburbs.

===Junction 6: Lothianburn===
This junction was the original eastern terminus of the road. This is a major junction with the A702, which provides access to western England, via Abington and the A74(M) to Carlisle and the M6.

===Junction 7: Dreghorn===
This junction primarily provides access to the only services on the bypass. Local roads including the B701, and Dreghorn Barracks are also accessed from this junction.

===Junction 8: Baberton===
This junction was the original western terminus of the road. It provides direct access to the suburb of Baberton and indirect access to the A70, for Lanark, or the centre of Edinburgh. This junction offers only connections to and from the eastern stretch of the A720.

===Junction 9 &amp; 10: Calder and Hermiston Gait===
The centre of these junctions are within of each other, with a tangle of inter-weaving slips roads, flyovers, and underpasses between and either side of them. The A71 meets the bypass at a roundabout over the carriageway, and the M8 terminates at a roundabout under the carriageway, along with access to Hermiston Gait retail park.

The A71 provides one of the main routes into Edinburgh via Calder Road, and west to Livingston and Kilmarnock. The M8 runs to Glasgow and provides direct access to the M9 for Stirling, and via the M90 to the Queensferry Crossing.

===Junction 11: Gogar Junction===
Finally the road swings north to finish on the A8 at Gogar Roundabout. The original junction was a simple roundabout connecting both roads, and access to South Gyle and Edinburgh Park. The roundabout now has an underpass for traffic on the A8. From this junction, traffic can proceed into Edinburgh City Centre by an alternative route through Corstorphine, or can head west to Edinburgh Airport and the M9 for Stirling, with connecting roads leading to all places north.

<text>Thomas Milner Gibson PC (3 September 1806 – 25 February 1884) was a British politician.

==Background and education==
Thomas Milner Gibson came of a Suffolk family, but was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, where his father, Thomas Milner Gibson, was serving as an officer in the British Army. 

He was educated in Trinidad, in a school at Higham Hill also attended by Benjamin Disraeli, at Charterhouse, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1830.

==Political career==
In 1837, Gibson was elected to parliament as Conservative member for Ipswich, but resigned two years later and losing the subsequent by-election, having adopted Liberal views, and became an ardent supporter of the free-trade movement. As one of Richard Cobden&#x27;s chief allies, he was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Manchester in 1841, and, from 1846 to 1848, he was Vice-President of the Board of Trade in Lord John Russell&#x27;s ministry. 

Although defeated in Manchester in 1857, he found another seat for Ashton-under-Lyne, and sat in the cabinet under Lord Palmerston and then Russell from 1859 to 1866 as President of the Board of Trade. 

In 1846, he was sworn of the Privy Council.
Gibson was the leading spirit in the movement for the repeal of taxes on knowledge, and his successful efforts on behalf of journalism and advertising were recognized by a public testimonial in 1862. He retired from political life in 1868, but he and his wife, whose salon was a great Liberal centre, were for many years very influential in society.

==Family==

Milner Gibson married Arethusa Susannah Cullum, daughter of Revd. Sir Thomas Gery Cullum, 7th Baronet of Hardwick House, Suffolk, in 1832. They resided at Theberton House, Suffolk.

Gibson also had a relationship with Susannah Bowles, a servant girl. Their son, Thomas Gibson Bowles, became a noted publisher and was the maternal grandfather of the Mitford sisters.

Milner Gibson died on board his yacht, the Resolute, at Algiers on 25 February 1884, aged 77, and was buried in St. Peter&#x27;s churchyard at Theberton in Suffolk on 13 March.

<text>Espaillat () is one of the 32 provinces of the Dominican Republic. It is divided into 5 municipalities and its capital city is Moca. Located in north-central Dominican Republic (Cibao), it is bordered by the provinces of La Vega to the south, Santiago and Puerto Plata to the west, and María Trinidad Sánchez to the north-east. The province has a coastline to the north with the Atlantic Ocean. It is named for Ulises Francisco Espaillat (1823–1878), the 19th-century author who was briefly President of the Republic in 1876.

==Municipalities and municipal districts==
The province as of June 20, 2006 is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot; - D.M.) within them:

*Cayetano Germosén
*Gaspar Hernández
**Joba Arriba (D.M.) 
**Veragua (D.M.)
**Villa Magante (D.M.)

<doc id="995862" wikidata="Q3546271" url="?curid=995862" title="Tyranny of numbers">
<text>The tyranny of numbers was a problem faced in the 1960s by computer engineers. Engineers were unable to increase the performance of their designs due to the huge number of components involved. In theory, every component needed to be wired to every other component (or at least many other components) and were typically strung and soldered by hand. In order to improve performance, more components would be needed, and it seemed that future designs would consist almost entirely of wiring.

==History==

The first known recorded use of the term in this context was made by the Vice President of Bell Labs in an article celebrating the 10th anniversary of the invention of the transistor, for the &quot;Proceedings of the IRE&quot; (Institute of Radio Engineers), June 1958 . Referring to the problems many designers were having, he wrote:

At the time, computers were typically built up from a series of &quot;modules&quot;, each module containing the electronics needed to perform a single function. A complex circuit like an adder would generally require several modules working in concert. The modules were typically built on printed circuit boards of a standardized size, with a connector on one edge that allowed them to be plugged into the power and signaling lines of the machine, and were then wired to other modules using twisted pair or coaxial cable.

Since each module was relatively custom, modules were assembled and soldered by hand or with limited automation. As a result, they suffered major reliability problems. Even a single bad component or solder joint could render the entire module inoperative. Even with properly working modules, the mass of wiring connecting them together was another source of construction and reliability problems. As computers grew in complexity, and the number of modules increased, the complexity of making a machine actually work grew more and more difficult. This was the &quot;tyranny of numbers&quot;.

=== Motivation for the integrated circuit ===
It was precisely this problem that Jack Kilby was thinking about while working at Texas Instruments. Theorizing that germanium could be used to make all common electronic components (transistors, resistors, capacitors, etc.), he set about building a single-slab component that combined the functionality of an entire module. Although successful in this goal, it was Robert Noyce&#x27;s silicon version and the associated fabrication techniques that make the integrated circuit (IC) truly practical.

Unlike modules, ICs were built using photoetching techniques on an assembly line, greatly reducing their cost. Although any given IC might have the same chance of working or not working as a module, they cost so little that if they didn&#x27;t work you simply threw it away and tried another. In fact, early IC assembly lines had failure rates around 90% or greater, which kept their prices high. The U.S. Air Force and NASA were major purchasers of early ICs, where their small size and light weight overcame any cost issues. They demanded high reliability, and the industry&#x27;s response not only provided the desired reliability but meant that the increased yield had the effect of driving down prices.

ICs from the early 1960s were not complex enough for general computer use, but as the complexity increased through the 1960s, practically all computers switched to IC-based designs. The result was what are today referred to as the third-generation computers, which became commonplace during the early 1970s. The progeny of the integrated circuit, the microprocessor, eventually superseded the use of individual ICs as well, placing the entire collection of modules onto one chip.

Seymour Cray was particularly well known for making complex designs work in spite of the tyranny of numbers. His attention to detail and ability to fund several attempts at a working design meant that pure engineering effort could overcome the problems they faced. Yet even Cray eventually succumbed to the problem during the CDC 8600 project, which eventually led to him leaving Control Data.
