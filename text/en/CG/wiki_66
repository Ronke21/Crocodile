<text>&quot;You&#x27;re a Grand Old Flag&quot; is an American patriotic march. The song, a spirited march written by George M. Cohan, is a tribute to the U.S. flag. In addition to obvious references to the flag, it incorporates snippets of other popular songs, including one of his own. Cohan wrote it in 1906 for his stage musical &quot;George Washington, Jr.&quot;

==History==
The song was first publicly performed on February 6, the play&#x27;s opening night, at Herald Square Theater in New York City. &quot;You&#x27;re a Grand Old Flag&quot; quickly became the first song from a musical to sell over a million copies of sheet music. The title and first lyric comes from someone Cohan once met; the Library of Congress website notes. &quot;You&#x27;re a Grand Old Flag&quot; would go on to become one of the most popular U.S. marching-band pieces of all time.


In the play itself, the scene with the Civil War soldier was replicated. The soldier&#x27;s comment was the lead-in to this song. Thus, the first version of the chorus began, &quot;You&#x27;re a grand old rag / You&#x27;re a high-flying flag&quot;. Despite Cohan&#x27;s efforts to pull that version, some artists such as Billy Murray had recorded it under its original title, &quot;The Grand Old Rag&quot;, in advance of the play&#x27;s opening, and copies under that title still circulate among collectors. Cohan&#x27;s second attempt at writing the chorus began, &quot;You&#x27;re a grand old flag / Though you&#x27;re torn to a rag&quot;. The final version, with its redundant rhyme, is as shown below.

Today, many different arrangements of the song exist. In particular, Paul V. Yoder&#x27;s 1954 arrangement of &quot;You&#x27;re a Grand Old Flag&quot; is a version commonly used today by the U.S. military in its performances of the song.

==Uses==
The song is often performed by marching bands on Flag Day, as the holiday is intended to celebrate the flag of the United States.

==Lyrics==

&lt;poem lang=&quot;fr&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Verse 1
There&#x27;s a feeling comes a-stealing,
And it sets my brain a-reeling,
When I&#x27;m list&#x27;ning to the music of a military band.
Any tune like &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;
Simply sets me off my noodle,
It&#x27;s that patriotic something that no one can understand.

&quot;Way down South, in the land of cotton,&quot;
Melody untiring,
Ain&#x27;t that inspiring?

Hurrah! Hurrah! We&#x27;ll join the jubilee!
And that&#x27;s going some, for the Yankees, by gum!
Red, White and Blue, I am for you!
Honest, you&#x27;re a grand old flag!&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Verse 2
I&#x27;m no cranky hanky panky,
I&#x27;m a dead square, honest Yankee,
And I&#x27;m mighty proud of that old flag that flies for Uncle Sam.
Though I don&#x27;t believe in raving
Ev&#x27;ry time I see it waving,
There&#x27;s a chill runs up my back that makes me glad I&#x27;m what I am.

Here&#x27;s a land with a million soldiers,
That&#x27;s if we should need &#x27;em,
We&#x27;ll fight for freedom!

Hurrah! Hurrah! For ev&#x27;ry Yankee Tar,
And old G.A.R., ev&#x27;ry stripe, ev&#x27;ry star.
Red, White and Blue, hats off to you!
Honest, you&#x27;re a grand old flag!&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;Chorus
You&#x27;re a grand old flag,
You&#x27;re a high-flying flag,
And forever in peace may you wave.
You&#x27;re the emblem of the land I love,
The home of the free and the brave.
Ev&#x27;ry heart beats true
&#x27;Neath the Red, White and Blue,
Where there&#x27;s never a boast or brag.
But should auld acquaintance be forgot,
Keep your eye on the grand old flag.&lt;/poem&gt;

The song has been modified for use as the fight song of the Melbourne Football Club who play in the Australian Football League, as well as by state league clubs West Perth Football Club in the WAFL, Sturt Football Club and Norwood Football Club in the SANFL, North Hobart Football Club in the TSL, Port Melbourne Football Club and the Casey Demons in the VFL as well as the Mansfield Eagles in the Goulburn Valley Football League. A modified version of the song was also used by the Yippies in 1968 for their nomination of Pigasus.

<text>William Hypolitus (or Hippolitus, or Hypolite) Keating (August 11, 1799 in Wilmington, Delaware – 1840 in London, England) was an American geologist. His father, Baron John Keating, of Irish ancestry, had been an officer in the French army in the West Indies and had settled in Wilmington, Delaware. Keating was educated at the University of Pennsylvania, and then in France and Switzerland, where he studied mining. In 1822, he became Professor of Chemistry and Mineralogy at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the American Philosophical Society (elected in 1822).

He is perhaps best known for his work on the staff of Stephen Long&#x27;s expedition to the Great Lakes in 1823, an account of which he published in 1824. In the account he first hypothesized the existence of what is now known as Lake Agassiz. Formed at the end of the last ice age during the retreat of the great North American glaciers Lake Agassiz was, at its peak, much larger than any currently existing lake. The tremendous significance of the discovery has come to be appreciated in recent decades because the draining of Lake Agassiz into the North Atlantic Ocean is now generally thought to have been responsible for sudden periods of cooling of Northern Hemisphere climate at the end of the Pleistocene. The most dramatic of these periods of cooling is known as the Younger Dryas.

<text>Travis Landon Barker (born November 14, 1975) is an American musician who serves as the drummer for the rock band Blink-182. He has collaborated with hip hop artists, is a member of the rap rock group Transplants, co-founded the rock band +44, and has also joined Box Car Racer, Antemasque and Goldfinger. Barker was a frequent collaborator with the late DJ AM, with whom he formed the duo TRV$DJAM. Due to his fame, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; referred to him as &quot;punk&#x27;s first superstar drummer&quot;, as well as one of the 100 greatest drummers of all time.

Born in Fontana, California, Barker began drumming at an early age. He began playing for The Aquabats in 1996, but left to join Blink-182 in 1998, which encountered mainstream success with &quot;Enema of the State&quot; (1999). Barker established himself as a versatile drummer, producing and making guest appearances in music projects of numerous music genres including hip hop, alternative rock, pop, and country. He also starred in an MTV reality series named &quot;Meet the Barkers&quot;. He was involved in a plane crash in 2008, but he recovered and released his debut solo album, &quot;Give the Drummer Some&quot;, in 2011. He has continued to work with rappers, releasing extended plays with Yelawolf, Asher Roth, and Nottz, as well as with Blink-182 and the Transplants.

Aside from drumming, he founded the clothing company Famous Stars and Straps in 1999, and the record labels LaSalle Records in 2004 and DTA Records in 2019. Companies such as DC Shoes and Zildjian cymbals have co-designed products in his name. He released a memoir, &quot;Can I Say: Living Large, Cheating Death, and Drums, Drums, Drums&quot;, in 2015. Barker is also a vegan and has invested in the Los Angeles vegan restaurant Crossroads Kitchen.

==Early life and education==
Barker was born in Fontana, California, on November 14, 1975, When Barker was four, his mother gave him his first drum kit, which was the only one he would have until he was 15. Barker began taking drum lessons at age five with a drummer named Michael Mai, who would expose young Barker to many different playing styles. At this time, he also began taking trumpet lessons. In junior high, Barker learned to play the piano and briefly tried singing, joining the madrigals men and women&#x27;s choir. In addition, Barker had non-musical aspirations; he also was interested in becoming a professional surfer and skateboarder. However, Barker states that &quot;I always migrated back to drums, though. That was the one direction that kind of felt like I was connected to and I could kind of understand. I could express myself better through my drums than I could anything else.&quot;

Barker has described himself as a stoner during his tenure at Fontana High School. His mother, who had been diagnosed with Sjögren syndrome three months earlier, died the day before he started high school. She told him to keep playing music and to follow his dreams. At Fontana High School, Barker played the drum set in the jazz ensemble and snare drum in the marching band. He gained a lot of experience performing at regional competitions and festivals. Barker employed a variety of styles including military and jazz rhythms, but was attracted to the driving rhythms of hip-hop and punk rock.

==Career==
===Musical beginnings (1993–1998)===
After graduating from Fontana High School, Barker worked as a trash man in Laguna Beach and played with the punk rock band Snot and Feeble, a Fontana-based band where he met Chad Larson. Larson went on to co-found the ska punk group the Aquabats in 1994. After local shows and demo tapes, the band recruited Barker through Larson&#x27;s connection. Barker, who was &quot;sleeping on [his] friend&#x27;s couch&quot; and still working as a trash man, only intended to fill in for a few days but ended up joining the band. The group then went into the studio with veteran producer Jim Goodwin to record &quot;The Fury of the Aquabats!&quot; Barker&#x27;s speed and accuracy meant that once his parts were recorded, he was free to head off and rehearse (and sit in with other bands). He had picked up a nickname with the Aquabats—Baron Von Tito—the reasons for which are lost to history as none of the members recall why.

After the October 1997 release of &quot;The Fury of the Aquabats!&quot;, the group toured nationwide with San Diego–based Blink-182, who had recently completed their second album &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;. The trio&#x27;s drummer, Scott Raynor, announced to his fellow members that he would depart following the SnoCore Tour in February 1998. The ensemble enlisted Barker to fill in for Raynor. Barker, who did not have time to prepare or practice with the duo, learned the drum tracks for the 20-song setlist in only 45 minutes before the first show and performed them flawlessly thereafter. Raynor returned that May, but arguments only grew worse. Raynor was fired by DeLonge and Hoppus, ostensibly over a drinking problem, and the band recruited Barker once more. &quot;I remember Travis rehearsing backstage for an hour or two, then playing with them during sound-check&quot;, recalled Aquabats member Adam Deibert. &quot;A few of us were standing by the stage and I vividly remember the feeling of &quot;this is the new Blink&quot;. We should have looked for a new drummer right then because it was so obvious what band he belonged in.&quot; The addition of Barker inspired DeLonge and Hoppus to &quot;play better&quot; and keep up with their new member, whom DeLonge called &quot;perfect&quot;. Barker continued playing with Blink-182 throughout 1998 and stepped in to play with the Vandals, where he filled in for Josh Freese as the year closed.

===Mainstream success (1999–2004)===
Barker&#x27;s first album with Blink—&quot;Enema of the State&quot;—was released in June 1999 and catapulted the trio to stardom, becoming the biggest pop punk band of the era. Three singles were released from the record—&quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot;, &quot;All the Small Things&quot;, and &quot;Adam&#x27;s Song&quot;—that crossed over into Top 40 radio format and experienced major commercial success. &quot;All the Small Things&quot; became a number-one hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, but also became a crossover hit and peaked at number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Its video parodied boy bands and pop music videos and won a Moon Man for Best Group Video at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. The album has sold over 15 million copies worldwide and had a considerable effect on pop punk music.
The band&#x27;s success did great things for Barker. &quot;Four years ago, I couldn&#x27;t afford to feed myself,&quot; he said in an interview at the time. &quot;But now I can buy art, work on old Cadillacs, and live in comfort. I can finally buy a dog and afford to feed him.&quot; He began dating Melissa Kennedy and purchased a rehearsal studio. Barker branched out into retail at this time, opening a store in Riverside called Famous Stars and Straps. The storefront was shut down by the city, but FSAS products began to be carried by other retailers and via the Internet. Barker also began offering drum lessons and added Guitar Center drum clinics to his list of activities. The band began its first arena tour in the fall of 1999, but Barker missed much of the 2000 Mark, Tom and Travis Show tour after he broke his finger.

Blink-182&#x27;s next effort, &quot;Take Off Your Pants and Jacket&quot; (2001), was greeted with immediate success, debuting at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and going triple platinum within three weeks (the record eventually sold in excess of 14 million copies worldwide).

In 2001, Barker married Melissa Kennedy, but the two divorced in August 2002 after nine months of marriage. Following a cancelled European tour, DeLonge went back to San Diego to record an album he deemed an experiment in ideas he felt weren&#x27;t suited to Blink-182. DeLonge, not wanting to pay for a studio drummer, simply asked Barker to step in and perform on the record, called &quot;Box Car Racer&quot;. The experiment became a full-time band and toured in 2002, which led to strained relations between DeLonge and Hoppus.
Through a connection with Jerry Finn, Rancid vocalist Tim Armstrong contacted Barker in the summer of 2002 to record tracks for a rap/rock collaboration called the Transplants. For his role on the &quot;Transplants&quot; record, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called Barker &quot;punk rock&#x27;s first superstar drummer&quot;. He also began appearing in music videos, including Puff Daddy&#x27;s &quot;Bad Boy for Life&quot;, as well as adding to his collection of vintage Cadillacs. Blink-182 released their fifth, untitled album in 2003, which marked a more mature direction. Shortly before the album&#x27;s completion, Barker&#x27;s girlfriend, ex-Miss USA Shanna Moakler, gave birth to their son, Landon Asher, in October 2003.

The Kinison, who supported Blink-182 on their tour dates, impressed Barker and were the first group signed to LaSalle Records, a record label Barker officially set up in 2004. LaSalle was named after Barker&#x27;s favorite Cadillac, and the label was designed to branch out to find all types of music, be it country or hip-hop. Barker met once a week with designers at Famous Stars and Straps to oversee designs for shoes and in his spare time picked up boxing. He injured his foot at a Melbourne, Australia show in 2004 but performed the next night using his left foot for the kick-drum; he was in so much pain afterward that the tour had to be canceled. Barker&#x27;s doctor informed him that not only did he break his foot, but he tore tendons and ligaments—described by Hoppus as &quot;the type of injury that people get in motorcycle accidents.&quot; In the meantime, Barker purchased a Wahoo&#x27;s Fish Taco franchise in Norco, California, and began work on a new Transplants record. The year for Blink-182 rounded off with a European tour that was soured by division in the band. In February 2005, the band issued a press statement announcing their &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot;.

===Reality television star and collaborations (2005–2008)===

After a &quot;Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;-inspired wedding in October 2004, Barker starred in the MTV reality series &quot;Meet the Barkers&quot; with wife Shanna Moakler. The series followed Barker and his new family through his daily life, including Blink-182&#x27;s final tour and the new Transplants album. The new Transplants album, &quot;Haunted Cities&quot; (2005), was completed in the aftermath of the Blink-182 &quot;hiatus&quot; and released in mid-2005. Meanwhile, Hoppus and Barker continued recording music together and began working on electronic demos, which they called +44. Barker began another new project in 2005 called Expensive Taste, featuring Paul Wall and Skinhead Rob—the project would be more traditionally hip-hop. Barker also turned his direction to producing, working with artists such as Bun B and T.I. The +44 project came to a turning point when Hoppus and Barker purchased their own studio in October 2005, named Opra Music. &quot;When Your Heart Stops Beating&quot;, the debut of +44, was greeted by less-than-stellar reviews and little commercial success.

Barker filed for divorce from Moakler that August; both used their MySpace blogs to comment on the situation. Their breakup and the drama surrounding it made them tabloid favorites. After he and Moakler split up in 2006, he was frequently spotted at nightclubs—and photographed necking with Paris Hilton. According to Barker, he was trying to blot out the guilt of giving his children a broken home, and consumed &quot;excessive amounts&quot; of prescription painkillers, marijuana and alcohol. The painkiller usage eventually developed into a full-fledged addiction over 2007. Barker broke his arm during a video shoot for +44, but continued to tour performing using one arm. In early 2007, Barker began to work on hip-hop remixes and production techniques for many artists, preparing some loops and beats for Juelz Santana and looking to open two new boutiques, one in Los Angeles named Fast Life and one in Venice Beach by the name of Rogue Status. He kept busy drumming for Idiot Pilot (&quot;Elephant&quot;) and the Federation (&quot;Black Roses&quot;), as well as creating well-received remixes of Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Umbrella&quot; and &quot;Crank That (Soulja Boy)&quot;. After a stint on the Honda Civic Tour with Fall Out Boy and Cobra Starship, +44 began work on a second studio album that October.

Barker continued releasing hip-hop remixes in 2008; a well-received remix of Flo Rida&#x27;s &quot;Low&quot; followed the &quot;Crank That&quot; rendition. The videos of Barker playing the revamped tracks grew heavily in popularity on YouTube. Barker hoped to collate his growing arsenal of remixes with a bunch of new tracks on which he was working. It began to germinate into the idea of making a solo album, producing it all himself. As 2008 wore on, it became evident that the project would supersede +44 for the immediate future, though the band would return, by all accounts, once everything was in place for the solo record. Guests who recorded with Barker included Young Dro, E-40, Willie Nelson, and Damian Marley. He began performing with DJ AM (Adam Goldstein) in June 2008 in a collaboration called TRV$DJAM. Essentially, DJ AM would mix a set of classic songs (which ranged from classic rock to dance) live with two turntables, then Barker would &quot;enhance AM&#x27;s groove&quot; with live drums. The duo performed at the MTV Video Music Awards on September 7. &quot;Our little duo of drummer and DJ [had] reached heights we never thought were possible,&quot; said Barker in a 2011 interview.

In 2008, Barker and Goldstein were in a plane crash that killed the other four people on board and left them both in critical condition.

===Solo album and reunions (Since 2009)===

Barker&#x27;s accident led to a Blink-182 reunion, with the group announcing their return at the February 2009 Grammy Awards. Barker continued to produce remixes throughout 2009, including a remix of &quot;3 a.m.&quot; by Eminem; he also collaborated with Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash. In the midst of the band&#x27;s reunion tour in August 2009, DJ AM was found dead by a friend in his New York apartment. Though Goldstein had been prescribed medication for pain following the crash, the medical examiner reported that he died from &quot;acute intoxication&quot; listing several prescription drugs and cocaine.

The plane crash led Barker to make some lifestyle changes; he began running and swimming each day, and went vegan since leaving the hospital, although he had already been vegetarian for 17 years. He has also overcome a painkiller addiction he had for years prior to the plane crash. &quot;I didn&#x27;t even take any pain medication after I got out of the hospital. They told me I&#x27;d be on some of the medicine for the rest of my life, but I got off all of them,&quot; said Barker. &quot;They made me a completely different person.&quot; Barker didn&#x27;t fly again until 2021, traveling by himself on his bus—and taking a boat when touring in Europe.

After more than two years of setbacks and delays, Barker finally released his long-in-the-works solo debut, &quot;Give the Drummer Some&quot;, in March 2011. The record features collaborations with artists from Lil Wayne to Slipknot&#x27;s Corey Taylor. &quot;Neighborhoods&quot;, Blink&#x27;s sixth studio album, was released in September 2011 and peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Barker continued his collaborations, working with Chester French, LL Cool J, Cypress Hill and producing an entire EP of collaboration, &quot;Psycho White&quot;, with rapper Yelawolf. Barker was unable to attend Blink-182&#x27;s Australian tour in 2013; Brooks Wackerman filled in.

On July 1, 2016, Blink released their seventh studio album &quot;California&quot; to critical and commercial success. To complete the project, Blink members Hoppus and Barker were forced to replace Blink co-founder Tom DeLonge with vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba of Alkaline Trio. Barker has joined Hoppus in citing DeLonge as the principal cause of the replacement. Citing DeLonge&#x27;s alleged unwillingness to commit to working on new Blink projects, Barker revealed.

&quot;We always covered up for [DeLonge] before. It was always, &#x27;We&#x27;re going to record an album,&#x27; then &#x27;Tom refuses to get into the studio without a record deal.&#x27; So everyone does hella amounts of work to get a record deal and now Tom isn&#x27;t part of Blink-182. It&#x27;s hard to cover for someone who&#x27;s disrespectful and ungrateful… Everyone should know what the story is with him and it&#x27;s been years with it.&quot;

He is currently producing his second solo album. Barker has written a memoir entitled &quot;Can I Say: Living Large, Cheating Death, and Drums, Drums, Drums&quot;, which was released on October 20, 2015. He appeared in the 2016 Grammy-nominated documentary film about American DJ and producer Steve Aoki, titled &quot;I&#x27;ll Sleep When I&#x27;m Dead&quot;.

In 2018, Travis Barker appeared on the trap-metal musician Ghostemane&#x27;s track, &quot;D(r)ead&quot;. He also features on XXXTentacion&#x27;s posthumous album &quot;Skins&quot;, playing drums on the track &quot;One Minute&quot; featuring Kanye West. In 2018 Travis Barker also joined The Aquabats for a 20th anniversary show celebrating their second album &quot;The Fury of the Aquabats&quot; at the Fonda Theater in Los Angeles, California.

In 2019, Barker teamed up with popular New Orleans alternative hip hop duo $uicideboy$ to announce &quot;Live Fast Die Whenever&quot;, a collaborative EP. Prior to the project&#x27;s release, the singles &quot;nothingleftnothingleft&quot; (a rapid-fire hardcore punk song) and &quot;Aliens Are Ghosts&quot; (which samples music critic Anthony Fantano&#x27;s review of $uicideboy$&#x27; debut album) were released. The EP was released on May 24. Along with the lead singles, the EP also included the songs &quot;Killing 2 Birds with 22 Stones&quot;, &quot;Sour Grapes&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Trust Anyone!&quot; (stylized in all caps), and &quot;Individuality Was So Last Year&quot;. Several tracks on the EP also featured James Shaffer of Korn on guitar. On July 12, 2019, Travis remixed Lil Peep &amp; XXXTentacion&#x27;s posthumous track &quot;Falling Down&quot;.

On April 24, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Barker was featured as the drummer during Post Malone&#x27;s well-received Nirvana tribute show and fundraiser for the WHO COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.

In May 2020, Barker signed American musician and TikTok personality Jxdn to his label DTA Records, making Jxdn the first artist on the label.

In September 2020, Barker was on a collaboration project with Machine Gun Kelly on Kelly&#x27;s album &quot;Tickets to My Downfall&quot;. He was also heavily featured in the movie adaptation of this album, &quot;Downfalls High&quot;. Barker played on the Willow Smith pop-punk track &quot;Transparent Soul&quot;, released April 27, 2021.

In February 2021, he launched a line of cannabinoid-infused products called Barker Wellness. The next month, on March 15, 2021, Barker was a featured artist in the Atreyu song &quot;Warrior&quot; on the album &quot;Baptize&quot;.

In July 2021, Barker signed an exclusive worldwide publishing administration deal with Warner Chappell Music.

In November 2021, Barker signed former BMG artist Avril Lavigne to DTA Records, with releases due to be handled by Warner Music Group&#x27;s Elektra Records.

In 2022, Travis Barker executive produced Machine Gun Kelly&#x27;s eighth studio album. Barker and Kelly announced the album name, &quot;Born with Horns,&quot; by getting matching tattoos of the album name on their arms. Kelly later changed the album title to &quot;Mainstream Sellout&quot;.

In June 2023, Travis Barker met with Alex Etheridge, a 13-year-old Phoenix musician suffering from bone cancer who was a particular fan of Barker&#x27;s drumming. Alex met Barker backstage at Blink-182&#x27;s June 14, 2023 concert in Phoenix, and Alex and his family sat in the front row for the concert later. The two spent more than an hour together, talking and playing drums, including an introduction to Barker&#x27;s wife Kourtney Kardashian via FaceTime. The meeting was set up by Australian social-media influencer Samuel Weidenhofer, who traveled from Melbourne to help arrange it. Weidenhofer recorded the meeting and released it later as a TikTok video, which has received more than 17 million views as of July 2023. Alex died on July 19, 2023.

==Influences and favorite drummers==
Barker told CBS Local that his first ever hero was Animal from The Muppets, crediting the character as his inspiration to pursue drumming; Barker would eventually play along with Animal and Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem on a 2012 episode of &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!.&quot; He also cites John Bonham of Led Zeppelin, Alex Van Halen of Van Halen, Tommy Lee of Mötley Crüe, and Danny Carey of Tool as his favorite drummers. In a 2016 Q&amp;A with Vevo, Barker credited Buddy Rich as the greatest drummer of all time. He also stated that Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Jump&quot; was the first song he learned on the drums.

==Personal life==

===Plane crash (2008)===
On September 19, 2008, TRV$DJAM performed at a free T-Mobile event in Five Points with Jane&#x27;s Addiction singer Perry Farrell and Gavin DeGraw in Columbia, South Carolina. The trip was a special occasion: &quot;We all thought it was kind of a treat—we were on a private plane,&quot; Barker said. Barker had invited his ex-wife Moakler, but she declined, saying she had a weird feeling about leaving their children. With a vacant seat, Barker invited his security guard Che Still, figuring he&#x27;d be good company and would enjoy the trip. Barker was always afraid to fly; in his teenage years, he was &quot;sure&quot; he would die in a plane crash. When Blink-182 were putting together artwork for &quot;Take Off Your Pants and Jacket&quot; in 2001, they created a &quot;Zoso-like&quot; icon for each band member: a jacket, a pair of pants, and an airplane. &quot;Please don&#x27;t give me the plane—I have a really fucked-up fear of flying,&quot; Barker begged, who ended up with the plane anyway.

Just before midnight, the plane, headed for Van Nuys, California, was heading down the runway when the occupants heard a loud bang. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the plane was departing from the airport when air traffic controllers saw sparks emanating from the plane. The pilots told the control tower that a tire had blown out and they would be aborting the take-off. The plane hurtled through the airport&#x27;s fence, across a highway and crashed into an embankment. &quot;When everything stopped, I tried to get everyone I could,&quot; Barker remembered. Barker and Adam &quot;DJ AM&quot; Goldstein escaped the plane and ran in circles on the highway. Hearing others yell, &quot;Stop, drop and roll,&quot; Barker dropped to the ground and Goldstein helped him put out the fire on his feet. Barker said, &quot;I was lying next to AM [Goldstein] as the plane was exploding, and I was screaming, &#x27;Are we alive?&#x27;&quot; Barker and Goldstein were transported to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia, where they were both listed in critical condition. They were the only survivors of the crash; personal assistant Chris Baker and Che Still, along with the two pilots, died in the crash. Less than a year later, Goldstein died from an overdose.

Barker spent more than 11 weeks in hospitals and burn centers. He had 16 surgeries: blood transfusions that lasted 4–8 hours and numerous skin grafts. &quot;There were times when they were talking about amputating my foot because I didn&#x27;t have enough skin on my body for my grafts,&quot; he said. Barker also developed post-traumatic stress disorder, made worse by the intense guilt he felt knowing Still was not supposed to be on the plane. During his time in the hospital, Barker was in so much pain that he was calling friends, offering them $1 million to help him end his life.

He stopped his vegetarian diet and began eating meat to increase his protein intake and possibly speed up healing of his burns. Barker recovered from the incident, enabling him to return to the recording studio in November 2008. In his first television interview since the crash, he said to MTV, &quot;I&#x27;m already playing my drums again, and I&#x27;m already back in the studio&quot;. He elaborated by stating that the return to the studio &quot;was like riding a bike. It was really exciting to know I still have my chops. It still felt good... I still can make it around the kit. Everything felt right, so I&#x27;m thankful to be able to play.&quot; Barker sued the plane&#x27;s owners, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., and an airplane maintenance company that month; the case was settled out of court in December 2009 and the terms of the settlement are confidential.

=== Relationships and family ===
Barker&#x27;s first marriage, to Melissa Kennedy, lasted nine months until he filed for divorce in August 2002. He later married actress and Miss USA 1995 first runner-up titleholder, Shanna Moakler, on October 30, 2004. The couple had a &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; goth-style ceremony held on the eve of Halloween. Barker and Moakler have two children together, a son, Landon Barker, born in 2003, and a daughter, Alabama Barker, born in 2005. Barker also remains extremely close with his stepdaughter Atiana, Moakler&#x27;s daughter with ex-fiancé, boxer Oscar De La Hoya; who appears regularly on &quot;The Kardashians&quot; where she is referred to as Barker&#x27;s &quot;daughter&quot;. The family appeared in a reality television series, &quot;Meet the Barkers&quot;, which aired on MTV from 2005 to 2006.

On August 8, 2006, Barker filed for divorce from Moakler after nearly two years of marriage. The divorce was made public as each used their MySpace pages to air their feelings on the matter. Despite their pending divorce, reports surfaced in early 2007 that Barker and Moakler were &quot;quietly trying to give it another go&quot; as they were reportedly seen autographing a fan&#x27;s book, with a heart around their names. In March 2007, Moakler told &quot;People&quot; magazine that she and Barker (still married) were back together, but denied that she was pregnant. This came after the couple were publicly affectionate at a surprise birthday Barker threw for his wife in Miami. &quot;People&quot; later reported that the couple had separated again; no reason was given for the split. Barker and Moakler were seen together at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards kissing and holding hands. However, on February 11, 2008, the couple&#x27;s divorce was finalized.

Barker and Moakler were together during a DJ set Barker was playing with DJ AM in Las Vegas on January 7, 2009. The couple attempted to rekindle their relationship in early 2009, but announced that they were no longer together on April 1, 2009.

On December 7, 2014, the police were called to Barker and Moakler&#x27;s shared home in Los Angeles after the two were engaged in a verbal altercation. They made criminal threats to each other, leading to both Barker and Moakler getting arrested. No charges were filed against either party.

In late 2015, Barker briefly dated singer and actress Rita Ora. In June 2016, it was reported that Barker and Moakler were amicably co-parenting their two children.

There were rumors of Barker and Kourtney Kardashian dating by very late 2020, which were confirmed and the relationship made official in January 2021. During this relationship, he returned to air travel after avoiding airplanes for 13 years. In October 2021, the couple got engaged. They had an unofficial wedding on April 3, 2022, in Las Vegas, after the 64th Annual Grammy Awards. The couple officially married on May 15, 2022, in Santa Barbara, California, with a religious wedding ceremony in Portofino, Italy, on May 22, 2022. On November 4, 2023, it was announced that the couple&#x27;s first child, a son, had been born.

Barker was raised Catholic, believes in God, and prays regularly with his children.

==Film, television, and video games==
Barker has appeared in numerous films and television shows, including his own reality show, &quot;Meet the Barkers&quot;, with his ex-wife Shanna Moakler, which debuted in 2005. Barker is in a brief scene with Blink-182 in the teen movie &quot;American Pie&quot;. In 2003, he appeared in an episode of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;, a &quot;Candid Camera&quot;-esque television show, in which he took part in a set-up bareknuckle boxing match; he also appeared and spoke alongside Linkin Park vocalist Chester Bennington on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Icon&quot; show honoring heavy metal band Metallica in May of that year.

In 2006, Barker starred in a Boost Mobile commercial, which was detailed in an episode of &quot;Meet the Barkers&quot;. He&#x27;s also played a few guest starring roles such as a rapper on the popular crime drama, &quot;&quot;. In 2001, he appeared with Mark Hoppus and Tom DeLonge in the skit &quot;Leave it to Blink-182&quot;, a parody of &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, on the late night TV show MADtv.

In a slight departure from his usual genres, he made an appearance on the 41st annual CMA Awards in 2006, performing a medley of songs by country icon Buck Owens with a group of artists including Dwight Yoakam, ZZ Top guitarist Billy Gibbons, and former Byrds bass player Chris Hillman.

Barker performed alongside Skylar Grey and Kid Ink at WrestleMania 31. He appears as a secret, playable character in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Project 8&quot;, and in &quot;Guitar Hero World Tour&quot;.

<doc id="994556" wikidata="Q893909" url="?curid=994556" title="Born–Haber cycle">
<text>The Born–Haber cycle is an approach to analyze reaction energies. It was named after two German scientists, Max Born and Fritz Haber, who developed it in 1919. It was also independently formulated by Kazimierz Fajans and published concurrently in the same journal. The cycle is concerned with the formation of an ionic compound from the reaction of a metal (often a Group I or Group II element) with a halogen or other non-metallic element such as oxygen.

Born–Haber cycles are used primarily as a means of calculating lattice energy (or more precisely enthalpy), which cannot otherwise be measured directly. The lattice enthalpy is the enthalpy change involved in the formation of an ionic compound from gaseous ions (an exothermic process), or sometimes defined as the energy to break the ionic compound into gaseous ions (an endothermic process). A Born–Haber cycle applies Hess&#x27;s law to calculate the lattice enthalpy by comparing the standard enthalpy change of formation of the ionic compound (from the elements) to the enthalpy required to make gaseous ions from the elements.

This lattice calculation is complex. To make gaseous ions from elements it is necessary to atomise the elements (turn each into gaseous atoms) and then to ionise the atoms. If the element is normally a molecule then we first have to consider its bond dissociation enthalpy (see also bond energy). The energy required to remove one or more electrons to make a cation is a sum of successive ionization energies; for example, the energy needed to form Mg2+ is the ionization energy required to remove the first electron from Mg, plus the ionization energy required to remove the second electron from Mg+. Electron affinity is defined as the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom or molecule in the gaseous state to form a negative ion.

The Born–Haber cycle applies only to fully ionic solids such as certain alkali halides. Most compounds include covalent and ionic contributions to chemical bonding and to the lattice energy, which is represented by an extended Born–Haber thermodynamic cycle. The extended Born–Haber cycle can be used to estimate the polarity and the atomic charges of polar compounds.

==Examples==

===Formation of LiF===

The enthalpy of formation of lithium fluoride (LiF) from its elements in their standard states (Li(s) and F2(g)) is modeled in five steps in the diagram:

# Atomization enthalpy of lithium
# Ionization enthalpy of lithium
# Atomization enthalpy of fluorine
# Electron affinity of fluorine
# Lattice enthalpy

The sum of the energies for each step of the process must equal the enthalpy of formation of lithium fluoride, formula_1.

:formula_2
* is the enthalpy of sublimation for metal atoms (lithium)
* is the bond enthalpy (of F2). The coefficient 1/2 is used because the formation reaction is Li + 1/2 F2 → LiF.
* &lt;chem&gt;\mathit{IE}_M&lt;/chem&gt; is the ionization energy of the metal atom: &lt;chem&gt;{M} + \mathit{IE}_{M} -&gt; {M+} + e^-&lt;/chem&gt;
* &lt;chem&gt;\mathit{EA}_X&lt;/chem&gt; is the electron affinity of non-metal atom X (fluorine)
* formula_3 is the lattice enthalpy (defined as exothermic here)

The net enthalpy of formation and the first four of the five energies can be determined experimentally, but the lattice enthalpy cannot be measured directly. Instead, the lattice enthalpy is calculated by subtracting the other four energies in the Born–Haber cycle from the net enthalpy of formation.
A similar calculation applies for any metal other than lithium and/or any non-metal other than fluorine.

The word &quot;cycle&quot; refers to the fact that one can also equate to zero the total enthalpy change for a cyclic process, starting and ending with LiF(s) in the example. This leads to
:formula_4
which is equivalent to the previous equation.

===Formation of NaBr===

At ordinary temperatures, Na is solid and Br2 is liquid, so the enthalpy of vaporization of liquid bromine is added to the equation:
:formula_5

In the above equation, formula_6 is the enthalpy of vaporization of Br2 at the temperature of interest (usually in kJ/mol).

<text>The Amaravati River is the longest tributary of the Kaveri River in the fertile districts of Udumalpet, Dharapuram and Karur Tamil Nadu state, South India.

== Course ==
The long Amaravati River begins at the Kerala/Tamil Nadu border at the bottom of Manjampatti Valley between the Anaimalai Hills and the Palni Hills in Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park in Tirupur district. It descends in a northerly direction through Amaravathi Reservoir and Amaravathi Dam at Amaravathinagar. It is joined by the Kallapuram River at the mouth of the Ajanda valley in Udumalaipettai. Through Dharapuram and Aravakurichi it joins with the Kaveri at Thirumukkudalur, about from Karur.

Nanganji, Kodavanar, Shanmuga nadhi, Uppar, Kudumiar, Thenar and many other tributaries join with the Amravati river. Other tributaries also include Pambar and Chinnar rivers from Kerala.

== Use ==
This river irrigates over of agricultural lands in Tiruppur and Karur districts. The Amaravathi Dam has 4 megawatts of electricity generating capacity installed. The Amaravathi River and its basin, especially in the vicinity of Karur, are heavily used for industrial processing water and waste disposal and as a result are severely polluted due to large amount of textile dyeing and bleaching units. But nowadays in karur, the changes are vicinity by seeing Amaravati river on its clean surface because of pollution controlled by government.

== History ==

The ancient names of the river is &quot;Aanporunai&quot; and &quot;Aambravathi&quot;. Amaravathi, invokes the greenery and Kalpavriksha tree of Lord Indra&#x27;s heaven. The name Amaravathi echoes the Hindu past and present of southern India. By Hindu religion, river is from the grace of goddess Ambaal form the heaven. The Amaravathi river swells into life in the Anjanad valley (Anaimalai, Kerala state) of the Western Ghats, whose slopes are awash with Kurinji blossoms once every 12 years, descends to the plains near Udumalaipettai, Tamil Nadu, and flows to make the rich plains of Dharapuram and Karur . It is one of the longest rivers (282 km) in Tamil Nadu, which join with the river Cauvery, near Karur.

<text>Abercorn is a small village located within the Brome-Missisquoi Regional County Municipality in the Estrie region of Quebéc, Canada. The population as of the 2021 Canada Census, was 341.

It currently covers a land area of approximately 26.73 km² (10.32 sq mi) and Is bordered by Sutton to the north and east, Frelighsburg to the west, and Richford, Vermont to the south.

==Toponymy==
The place was first known as Sheppard&#x27;s Mills in honour of Thomas Sheppard, one of the first inhabitants in 1879. However, the origin of the name Abercorn remains uncertain. This name is probably related to the title held by James Hamilton (1811-1885), Duke of Abercorn. This title is itself linked to a Scottish village located east of Edinburgh.

==History==
Thomas Spencer built the first log cabin near Abercorn in 1792. The village was originally called Sheppard&#x27;s Mills in honour of Thomas Shepard, a New Hampshire loyalist who built the area&#x27;s first grain and saw mill. Originally part of Sutton, Abercorn was established as a township in 1929.

==Geography==
The village is located on the northern edge of the Green Mountains in the Sutton Valley, flanked to the west by the Pinnacle and to the east by the Sutton Mountain range. The Sutton river runs through the valley, as does Route 139 and the Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway.

Located about 105 km from Montréal via Autoroute 10 and near the ski hills of Mount Sutton, Bromont, Jay Peak, Vermont, and Mont Owl&#x27;s Head, Abercorn is a popular day trip and vacation spot for Montrealers.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Abercorn had a population of residing in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Then finally, the river drains into the Kaveri River at Noyyal, a village in Karur district named after the river itself. The river&#x27;s basin is long and wide and covers a total area of . Cultivated land in the basin amounts to while the population density is 120 people per km2 (311/mi2) in the countryside, and 1000 people per km2 (2590/mi2) in the cities. The area is known for its scanty rainfall and the development of the Noyyal River Tanks System to hold any overflow from the rains plus the water of the Northeast and Southwest monsoon season was ecologically important. Kausika river, which originates along the northern side of Coimbatore district in the Western Ghats along with its consequent streams, lake and pond systems is an important tributary of the river. The long tributary of the Kaveri River filled 32 tanks. These interconnecting tanks held the water flowing from the Noyyal.

==Ecology==
The township of Coimbatore once was surrounded by the Noyyal river and its canals, tanks, and rivulets. The Noyyal river and its interconnected tank and canal system, believed to have been originally built by the Chalukya Cholas kings, was then an efficient system that provided water transport, storage, and maintained stable groundwater levels. Surplus water from the Noyyal river spilled into the canals and were channeled to the tanks, preventing unwanted flooding. The tanks were a major factor in replenishing the ground water through percolation of the subsoil water. As city urbanized, the system was neglected and the number of functional water bodies drastically reduced until only eleven were left. Today the system no longer works and water is scarce. Agriculture has significantly decreased. Lacking irrigation water, lakhs of Coconut trees in the area have dried up.

==History==
The &quot;Noyyal&quot; is a sacred river in Tamil history. Its original name was Kanchimanadi as mentioned in Perur Puranam. But changed later to the name of the place where it drains into the Kaveri River in 1750 A.D.

The Noyyal village is situated at the banks of Noyyal and Kaveri (Ponni) rivers where they both merge. An ancient temple to the goddess &quot;SellandiAmman&quot; is also situated at the confluence (Sangamam).

==Pollution==
A critical issue is the pollution of the rivers Noyyal and Nallaru originating and flowing in the Kongu Nadu region. The river flows with natural antibiotic minerals. The entire Orathuppalayam Dam has become a tank holding effluent and releases water after every rainfall, effectively polluting the down river villages in the Tirupur and Karur district.

However, from 2004 onwards, efforts by local volunteers organization Siruthuli have been trying to conserve the water resource. After several petitions from 2003 to 2011, dying and bleaching units were ordered closed on the river until zero liquid discharge status was achieved.

On 9 July 2018, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu announced that a sum of Rs. 150 crores would be earmarked for preventing pollution in of Noyyal within Tirupur city limits.

==Geography==
The Cheyyar River and the Kanchimanadhi are the tributaries to the river. They all have their origins in the Western Ghats. Periar flows out of the Siruvani hills and the Kovai Kuttralam, a landmark waterfalls. Chadiaar or Cheyyar River flows through Chaadivayal and later along with the other rivers join up at Kooduthurai to become Noyyal River.

After running through a distance of , Noyyal joins with river Cauvery near Kodumudi, the place is also called Noyyal, Karur District. Apart from these three rivers, there are numerous rivulets that also join Noyyal. But most of these rivulets carry water only during the rainy season and therefore are not perennial. According to the available sources, the number of rivulets are 34.

The river has a valley fill (made of alluvial kankar soil) over a stretch of and a depth of . It extends from the origin of the river at Kooduthurai (in Madhvarayapuram, west of the city) to the Ukkadam Tank on the city border. The fill absorbs water like a sponge. Only when the absorption reaches a saturation point does excess water flow to the suburbs and the city.

==Dams and reservoirs==
Noyyal contains two major dam Orathuppalayam (Near Chennimalai) and Aathupalayam Dam (Near Vellakoil) commissioned in the aim of irrigating about 20,000 acres of land in Tirupur and Karur districts. As of now Orathuppalayam dam stands decommissioned and acting as effluent tank for the Tirupur textile units.

The river has 23 check dams. Decades ago, it irrigated . Noyyal revival over will enable irrigation of , according to Siruthuli.

Simard was born in Ste. Anne, Manitoba. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from the College universitaire de Saint-Boniface, as well as a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Manitoba. Simard worked as a businessman and consultant before entering political life, initially for a number of business concerns owned by his family. In 1999, he became the founding President and CEO of &quot;Riel Economic Development Corporation&quot;, and is also the President and co-owner of &quot;Simard Solutions&quot;.

In 2002, sitting Saint Boniface MP Ron Duhamel was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. Simard was selected as the Liberal candidate for the resulting by-election, and on May 13, 2002, he defeated Canadian Alliance candidate Denis Simard by about 4400 votes.

In parliament, Simard has expressed a special interest in matters relating to francophone concerns in Canada. His riding is one of the few in western Canada with a significant francophone population (16% list French as their mother tongue, according to the 2001 Canadian census), and the only such riding which regularly elects francophone candidates to parliament.

In his private business life, Simard was responsible for opening the first bilingual services centre in Canada.

Simard was re-elected in the 2004 federal election, defeating Conservative Ken Cooper by about 6,000 votes. On July 20, 2004, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Internal Trade, Deputy Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, and Minister responsible for Official Languages with responsibility for Official Languages and Democratic Reform.

In the 2006 federal election, Simard&#x27;s third election in the federal riding of Saint-Boniface, Simard defeated for a second time Conservative Ken Cooper however by far fewer votes than previous years. In the same year, Simard was appointed Deputy Whip of Her Majesty&#x27;s loyal opposition (Canada). Simard endorsed Michael Ignatieff in the leadership race of the Liberal Party of Canada.

In 2007, Simard was appointed critic of Western Economic Development of her Majesty&#x27;s loyal opposition.

Simard was defeated by Conservative candidate Shelly Glover in the 2008 federal election. He ran again in the 2011 election losing to Glover.

<doc id="994583" wikidata="Q910101" url="?curid=994583" title="CitySpire">
<text>CitySpire (also known as CitySpire Center) is a mixed-use skyscraper at 150 West 56th Street in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. Completed in 1990 and designed by Murphy/Jahn Architects, the building measures tall with 75 stories. CitySpire was developed by Ian Bruce Eichner on a site adjacent to the New York City Center theater. When completed, CitySpire was the second-tallest concrete tower in the United States after the Sears Tower.

The skyscraper has an octagonal plan with a dome inspired by that of the New York City Center. The facade is made of stone with glass windows, and it contains setbacks at the 46th and 62nd floors. The building has entrances at 56th and 55th Streets, connected by a passageway that forms part of 6½ Avenue. The lowest 22 floors of the tower are for commercial use. Above are luxury apartments, which are larger on higher floors.

Eichner proposed CitySpire in 1984, acquiring unused air rights above City Center and making improvements to the theater to almost double the tower&#x27;s area. After several agencies approved the project, City Center began construction in 1985 and was topped out by June 1987. A controversy ensued when the building exceeded its approved height by ; Eichner agreed to add dance-studio space to compensate for the height overrun, but he ultimately never built the space. Soon after CitySpire&#x27;s opening in 1989, the building went into foreclosure, and there were complaints of a whistling noise from the roof for two years.

== Site ==
CitySpire is at 150 West 56th Street, between Sixth Avenue and Seventh Avenue three blocks south of Central Park, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. The building&#x27;s land lot covers and has a frontage of along 56th Street. While the site is deep, extending south to 55th Street, only a small section of the lot has frontage on 55th Street.

The building is directly west of the New York City Center and 125 West 55th Street; the former is a New York City designated landmark at 135 West 55th Street. Immediately to the north are Carnegie Hall, Carnegie Hall Tower, Russian Tea Room, and Metropolitan Tower from west to east. Other nearby buildings include 140 West 57th Street, 130 West 57th Street, and the Parker New York hotel to the northeast, as well as the 55th Street Playhouse to the southwest and 1345 Avenue of the Americas to the southeast.

The neighborhood was part of a former artistic hub around a two-block section of West 57th Street between Sixth Avenue and Broadway. The hub had been developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, following the opening of Carnegie Hall. Several buildings in the area were constructed as residences for artists and musicians, such as 130 and 140 West 57th Street, the Rodin Studios, and the Osborne Apartments, as well as the demolished Sherwood Studios and Rembrandt. In addition, the area contained the headquarters of organizations such as the American Fine Arts Society, the Lotos Club, and the American Society of Civil Engineers. By the 21st century, the artistic hub had largely been replaced with Billionaires&#x27; Row, a series of luxury skyscrapers around the southern end of Central Park. Just prior to CitySpire&#x27;s construction, the site was occupied by six vacant lots at 132–158 West 56th Street and one on 137 West 55th Street. These lots were acquired in the 1970s by Richard M. Chapman, who razed the buildings there.

== Architecture ==
CitySpire (also known as CitySpire Center) was designed by Murphy/Jahn and developed by Ian Bruce Eichner. It was constructed by Tishman Realty &amp; Construction, with Robert Rosenwasser Associates as structural engineer. CitySpire is tall with 75 above-ground levels and two basement stories; the concrete frame reaches a height of . When completed, CitySpire was the second-tallest concrete tower in the United States after the Sears Tower in Chicago.

=== Form and facade ===

CitySpire was designed from the beginning as an octagonal tower with wings on the east and west. CitySpire has three setbacks on the east and west they are placed at the 23rd, 46th, and 62nd floors. Most of the building is no more than wide. Because the building is so narrow, the upper stories sometimes sway during heavy storms.

As proposed, the main shaft of the tower was to be clad in stone, while the wings were to be made of glass. The facade is made of Sardinian &quot;luna pearl&quot; that is cut into slabs, measuring about . Each slab is attached to the aluminum curtain wall frame on all sides, supported only by the curtain wall. The stone panels are entirely prefabricated and are insulated with fiberglass panels measuring thick, along with neoprene gaskets and silicone caulk. The setbacks at the 46th and 62nd floors were designed with parapets of steel and concrete, which were reduced in size as part of a 1988 lawsuit settlement concerning the building&#x27;s height. Eichner disliked the parapets; he suggested that residents on the 46th floor &quot;can look out at it and know they&#x27;re looking at a wall instead of Central Park so that Helmut Jahn can rest easy knowing that his &#x27;artistic integrity&#x27; is intact.&quot;

The roof has a copper-faced dome which, as originally proposed, was supposed to be tall. When it was ultimately installed in 1988, the dome contained eight steel ribs, each measuring long and weighing . Each rib consisted of three sections. The dome itself contains louvers and was designed with a green surface. When the dome was constructed, wind created a loud whistling sound when passing through the louvers; this was remedied in 1992 with the removal of alternating panels. Paul Sachner of &quot;Architectural Record&quot; initially likened the dome to that of the Nebraska State Capitol, while Paul Goldberger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the dome was meant to relate to City Center.

=== Structural features ===
The superstructure is made of concrete. Because of CitySpire&#x27;s mixed-use spaces, it contains nine different structural systems, since a unified grid of columns was infeasible for apartment layouts. Further, because Eichner wanted to maximize views of the surrounding city, the wind-resisting sections of the superstructure had to be placed in the interior.

The lower stories, used as offices, were largely designed as a grid of concrete columns, allowing for flexible office layouts. While the lower stories are largely composed of grids of columns, there are also sections of rectangular concrete panels, which are staggered across several levels to create a diagonal wind brace. The upper stories are designed as a &quot;shear wall/open tube&quot; structural system, in which shear walls extend from the elevator core at the center of the tower, connecting to the outer columns.

=== Interior ===
CitySpire has a floor area of around , and ten elevators rise the height of the building. Before CitySpire was developed, the site was zoned to only allow a building of around 34 stories without any modifications. Given the size of the lot, this would have provided up to of space. Eichner obtained unused air rights above City Center, which only occupied a small amount of the maximum space allowed for its lot; this allowed a 60-story tower. On top of this, Eichner was allowed to increase the building&#x27;s floor area ratio by 20 percent in exchange for renovating City Center. This amounted to of extra space. These bonuses allowed CitySpire to be more than twice as large as it ordinarily would have been.

The interior floor-numbering system skips floors 13 and 25, so there are physically only 73 stories, though the top story is numbered 75. The lowest 22 or 23 floors of the building are for commercial use. There are luxury apartments on the remaining floors, as well as a mechanical story. The building was designed with elaborate details. The attention to detail extended to the elevator buttons, which Jahn redesigned with three buttons to a row when Eichner found two buttons per row to be unpleasing.

==== Base ====

A pedestrian arcade between 56th and 55th Streets is included in CitySpire&#x27;s base as part of its construction. The arcade is one of nine passageways that form 6½ Avenue, a set of full-block passageways from 51st to 57th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. It was built as a &quot;through-block connection&quot; under the Special Midtown District, created in 1982. The connection itself was not opened until 1997, several years after the building opened; the delay was largely due to the building&#x27;s foreclosure and other disputes in the early 1990s. The arcade, designed by Brennan Beer Gorman, consists of marble and granite walls as well as a ceiling. The passageway is decorated in an Art Deco-inspired style, with theater posters on the walls. The space has recessed lights on the ceiling and lights on the walls, but there is no seating since the passageway was designed merely for pedestrian movement.

The office and residential lobbies are separate from each other. The residential lobby at 150 West 56th Street has a domed ceiling as well as wooden paneling. The office portion of CitySpire has the address 156 West 56th Street. There is also a bar called Carnegie Club (originally Carnegie Bar and Books). The bar, on the ground floor, has a ceiling high with an overhanging mezzanine. A garage and cafe was also included in the base. The building was planned with of office space. Each of the office stories typically measures , with polygonal cutouts at each corner.

==== Tower ====
The building was proposed with 355 luxury residential condominiums, but it was completed with 339 or 340 condos. According to the New York City Department of City Planning, there are 340 condominiums in the entire building, of which 337 are residential units. About 100 of the apartments were built with one bedroom, with the rest having multiple bedrooms. Many of the residential units are separated from each other by the building&#x27;s shear walls. Due to the setbacks on the exterior, floors 47 through 61 typically measure , while floors 63 through 69 are an octagon measuring 80 feet across.

The apartments at CitySpire vary in size and arrangement, though many of the units contain terraces. For instance, one studio apartment has a living room, kitchen, and terrace. Some of the one-bedroom units also have living and dining rooms with angled walls. In some of the two-bedroom units, there is a foyer with a living/dining room, kitchens, and bedrooms leading off it. There are also duplex units with kitchens, living rooms, and dining rooms on the lower tier, as well as bedrooms on the upper tiers. One of the larger duplexes, on floors 65/66, has four bedrooms; a living/dining area with a library and breakfast area; a family room; and a terrace measuring . On upper floors, the units tend to be larger, reaching below the penthouse.

Eichner originally intended to occupy a penthouse apartment atop CitySpire, but he ended up never living in the unit. The penthouse was instead purchased in 1993 by real estate developer Steven Klar for about $4.5 million as a &quot;raw space&quot;; it covers floors 72 through 75, though floor 72 is a guest suite. Klar had hired Juan Pablo Molyneux to redesign the penthouse over two and a half years. The penthouse, covering , has six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, as well as three terraces. The master bedroom takes up an entire story, while the master bathroom has green marble cladding as well as bronze and mahogany fixtures. The penthouse also has a classical-columned foyer, a large dining room with a chandelier, a wine closet with space for 1,000 bottles, and a private elevator. Molyneux personally disliked the design, calling it a &quot;horror&quot;, though this was apparently because Molyneux actually never saw the design in person, having been dismissed before the design was completed.

When CitySpire was built, it was advertised with amenities such as the SpireCard, a charge account to which each resident could request a luxury service for a fee. It was also advertised with a media room containing a large-screen TV; a lounge with bar; and a business center with stock quote and telex machines. The modern amenities include a party and conference rooms, play area, and fitness center with pool.

== History ==
The neighboring New York City Center had opened in 1924 as the Mecca Temple, a house of worship for the Shriners. The Mecca Temple was acquired by the New York City government in 1943 and became a theater. In 1982, City Center completed a minor renovation to the lobby and orchestra. City Center planned another set of improvements to enlarge stage, storage, and balcony areas. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated City Center as a city landmark in 1983; as a result, the commission was required to approve any major alterations to the theater. Concurrently, Bruce Eichner bought Chapman&#x27;s neighboring site for $18 million. He also bought a parking garage, whose owner agreed to sell it on the condition a replacement parking garage was built.

=== Development ===

==== Planning ====

In May 1984, Eichner announced that he would build a 72-story skyscraper on the site, designed by Murphy/Jahn. The building would contain 22 stories of offices and 49 stories of condominiums. It would be shaped like an octagon with setbacks and a domed roof. A key part of Eichner&#x27;s development was his proposal to purchase unused air rights above City Center. Eichner would also make improvements to City Center to obtain additional space. The sale was expected to raise $10 to 14 million for the New York City Opera, New York City Ballet, and City Center&#x27;s sublessee 55th Street Dance Theater. The proposed air-rights sale received criticism both for its relatively low price and for the fact that it would allow an excessively large building. City Center Tower was one of several high-rise developments planned for the area at the time; Metropolitan Tower and Carnegie Hall Tower were being proposed as well.

The air-rights transfers needed the approval of several agencies. In August 1984, the New York City Board of Estimate voted to allow the sale of air rights. The LPC was scheduled to hold a hearing for the proposed sale in November 1984, but an unrelated controversy over another landmark candidate took up all the time allotted for discussing the air-rights sale. The LPC granted the project a &quot;certificate of appropriateness&quot; in January 1985, which allowed the LPC to apply for a special zoning permit from the New York City Planning Commission (CPC) for the air-rights transfer. Several agencies then needed to approve the tower itself. Following objections from members of the Board of Estimate and CPC, some elements of City Center Tower were downsized. The CPC approved the tower in June 1985, followed by the Board of Estimate that August.

The building had been approved to a height of about . Though the City Center Tower was to be New York City&#x27;s tallest residential tower upon its construction, Eichner cited a study that &quot;proved&quot; the top of the tower would not cast shadows on the street. He described the tower as a &quot;quintessential New York skyscraper&quot;, compared to the &quot;undistinguished&quot; glass-clad office buildings on Madison and Park Avenues. Eichner received $157.5 million in construction financing. Both Eichner and his lawyer Howard Horenstein donated several thousand dollars to Mayor Ed Koch, who had voted in favor of the tower. The donations were investigated in an ethics probe in 1987.

==== Construction ====
By the time the Board of Estimate had approved City Center Tower, pouring of the concrete slabs was underway. The project was being referred to as CitySpire by mid-1986, when European American Bank leased eight of the office stories. The construction of CitySpire involved controversies over safety. Susan Guszynski of the Joffrey Ballet, a tenant in City Center, wrote a letter to the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) in late 1986, alleging that three Joffrey staff had been hit by falling concrete during one week that October. The Buildings Department subsequently received four additional complaints of falling objects, including one instance in which a portion of the facade fell from the roof. Neighbors also filed lawsuits claiming that CitySpire&#x27;s construction had led to debris pileups and various incidents. One neighbor claimed that he received death threats after complaining to the police about cracked windows, while another neighbor was allegedly raped after an attacker climbed into her apartment through CitySpire&#x27;s scaffolding.

Marketing for the residential units started in March 1987, with TV advertisements that featured celebrities such as Dick Cavett, Carol Channing, Lauren Hutton, Robert Joffrey, Lynn Redgrave, and Tommy Tune. Despite this, only 60 of the 340 condos were in contract by that August. The slow sales were attributed to the shortage of small apartments, as well as the tower&#x27;s location in a traditionally non-residential neighborhood. The advertisements also received complaints for including only white people; the director of the building&#x27;s marketing team claimed they were just targeting the demographic who was most likely to buy apartments there. Horenstein denied the advertisements were intended to discourage minorities.

==== Completion and height controversy ====

The building had topped out by mid-1987. The building, as constructed, exceeded its approved height by either or . The difference of was a calculation error from two different methods of measuring height, but the extra 11 feet came from Eichner&#x27;s decision to add of cement to all the floor slabs to stiffen them. The topped-out structure had to undergo a second public review from the Board of Estimate, Manhattan Community Board 5, and the CPC. Eichner voluntarily agreed to halt CitySpire&#x27;s structural work, though he saw the height overruns as being &quot;of no consequence to anyone&quot;. By November 1987, Eichner and city officials were discussing a compromise in which Eichner would give more arts funding but keep the extra height. By the end of 1987, Eichner had sold 164 of the apartments, and some of the commercial space was already occupied. Residential prices at CitySpire had remained relatively low in the wake of Black Monday two months earlier.

Community Board 5 officials voted against allowing the extra height in protest of the zoning law. The CPC rejected the additional height that December, saying Eichner could have pursued other options, including lowering ceiling heights, to stay within the 800-foot height limit. CPC chairwoman Sylvia Deutsch rejected Eichner&#x27;s offer to add unrelated amenities and pay the city extra cash, and she also dismissed complaints from neighbors who opposed the project for unrelated reasons. In April 1988, the city and Eichner tentatively reached a settlement in which Eichner agreed to build of dance studios above the pedestrian arcade and reduce some facade details. The agreement, contingent on the dome not being completed, had not been ratified by the CPC or Board of Estimate. Deutsch called the agreement &quot;reasonable&quot;; however, community groups thought it would set a precedent for developers who built past their height limits, and some LPC members specifically opposed the design.

Residents of the lower floors were allowed to move into the building by mid-1988, even though the upper stories did not have their occupancy certificate. CitySpire&#x27;s dome was completed in August 1988, apparently in violation of the settlement. While Community Board 5 had notified the DOB about the illegal work earlier, the dome had been completed by the time the DOB issued a stop-work order. Koch ordered the dome dismantled that November. The ribs were partially removed so CitySpire would only exceed the permitted height by . City Center filed a lawsuit that month, alleging that Eichner had not renovated the theater as promised. City Center sought an injunction to forbid the DOB from issuing CitySpire a certificate of occupancy for the top twenty stories until the renovations were performed. A New York Supreme Court justice declined to issue the injunction, and the city allowed Eichner to open the 51st through 63rd floors. Community Board 5 &quot;demanded&quot; the city deny CitySpire a special zoning permit for the extra height.

The removal of the dome was temporary pending the approval of a zoning variance through the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, which was granted in January 1989. Soon after, the CPC voted to permit the completion of CitySpire&#x27;s dome in exchange for the dance studios in the base. The Board of Estimate continued to debate over whether the dance studios were an appropriate penalty for Eichner. In March 1989, the Board of Estimate voted 6–5 to allow the dance studios as an appropriate penalty. The height agreement received opposition from city comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, who charged that Eichner was violating the law, and from critics who believed the dance studios, at , were too small. The dome was subsequently damaged in a fire in May 1989, which investigators determined was an arson. Eichner had still not completed renovations at City Center like he had promised, and the building&#x27;s pedestrian arcade was not open to the public.

=== Usage ===

Eichner had sold 280 of the apartments and three-quarters of the office space by early 1989, and the building was completed by 1990. CitySpire&#x27;s dance studios were supposed to be completed in September 1989, but it was not until mid-1990 that Eichner applied for a permit. Construction on the studios had not even started because, according to Hornstein, the plans had to be approved by several agencies. Eichner still had yet to sell the 50 remaining apartments and the remaining 20 percent of commercial space. Ten of these apartments were in the top stories that could not be completed until the studios were finished.

==== Noise pollution and bankruptcy ====
Shortly after CitySpire&#x27;s completion, Eichner was concurrently negotiating construction loans with his lenders, which included Citibank and European American Bank. He was also delinquent on $3.7 million of tax payments, which the city sued that July to recover. In October 1990, European American Bank challenged the collateral behind $50 million worth of construction loans on the building. The next month, the bank foreclosed on the loans. That December, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) fined CitySpire for noise violations, making CitySpire the first building to be individually cited by the DEP for noise pollution. The DEP had received hundreds of complaints about a loud whistling noise that was audible several blocks away; the noise was caused by wind blowing through louvers on the dome. Neighbors reported being kept awake by the noise. Monroe Price opined that &quot;the community should attempt to understand what the building is trying to say&quot;, while &quot;Progressive Architecture&quot; said: &quot;In a less restrictive era, we might look forward to developers&#x27; plans for &#x27;The Wind Chime Centre&#x27; or &#x27;One Kazoo Plaza&#x27;.&quot;

At a hearing in February 1991, Judge Gerald Denaro of New York City&#x27;s Environmental Control Board ordered a study on the noise coming from the dome. The building faced a fine of up to $880 if it was found guilty of whistling. West 56th Street Association, the building&#x27;s legal owner, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the end of that month. The association, a limited partnership where Eichner was the general partner, faced lawsuits from both European American Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia. The association had also faced a receivership proceeding, as it had also failed to pay the condominium apartments&#x27; common charges. The bankruptcy proceeding absolved Eichner from paying $11 million in unpaid taxes, but the building&#x27;s residential sales office had to shut down that year.

In April 1991, Denaro ruled that CitySpire was guilty of violating the noise ordinance and fined the managing agent $220. A federal judge ruled that September that the city&#x27;s noise code was too vague to be enforced, leading the New York City Council to draft a law to more strictly define noise. By May 1992, the building&#x27;s board of managers said the whistling would be fixed within several weeks. Bankruptcy proceedings, meanwhile, had been stalled over an unpaid $324,000 capital gains tax. A reorganization plan for the tower was finally approved in September 1992, eighteen months after the building&#x27;s owner had filed for bankruptcy. The roof noise was stopped that October, and the receivers paid the city $2.1 million instead of renovating City Center&#x27;s studios as a penalty. The receivers also sought to be exempted from their obligation to build studios above the pedestrian arcade, which was still unfinished.

==== Late 1990s to present ====

Euram, a subsidiary of European American Bank&#x27;s parent ABN AMRO, took over the residential section and renovated 75 vacant units. The Bank of Nova Scotia rebranded the commercial section as Midland Tower. Euram started marketing the vacant apartments in May 1993; ten of the units had been sold within a month, and all the condos were sold by the following year. Eichner continued to maintain offices at CitySpire. Although the financial issues and noise complaints had been resolved, the studios and arcade, which had been a compromise for CitySpire&#x27;s height, had still not been completed by 1995. The arcade was strewn with litter and blocked off with razor wire and wooden panels, and CitySpire&#x27;s owners planned to renovate it for use. The owners planned to scrap the studios above the arcade, instead creating additional rehearsal space in City Center itself.

Around 1996, Joseph Neumann and Credit Suisse First Boston acquired CitySpire for $38 million. The building had been offered for $50 million, but Neumann and First Boston were able to buy the building for less after beating a competing bid from Henry Elghanayan. At the time, the building owed $1.9 million in taxes to the city government. The office owners (composed of First Boston and external investors), along with the residential condo owners, bore the cost of the pedestrian arcade&#x27;s $1 million renovation. CitySpire&#x27;s pedestrian arcade was finally completed in late 1997. Upon the arcade&#x27;s completion, David W. Dunlap wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that it had taken seven years between the authorization of the first transcontinental railroad and the laying of its golden spike, but it had taken twelve years between the arcade&#x27;s approval and its opening. The arcade&#x27;s opening completed the set of walkways from 51st to 57th Street. In addition, some of the office space was converted into &quot;prebuilt&quot; offices.

The office stories were owned by Singapore government investment fund GIC by 2001. GIC leased space to Windels Marx, GE Capital, and The Recording Academy. That year, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley provided a $900 million mortgage to GIC for CitySpire&#x27;s office stories and some of GIC&#x27;s other properties. The office section of CitySpire was acquired in 2004 by Tishman Speyer, who bought a 51 percent majority stake. GIC continued to hold a 49 percent stake.

In 2012, Tishman Speyer and an unidentified pension fund acquired CitySpire and several other buildings as part of a portfolio valued at $1.6 billion. The same year, Douglas Elliman marketed the penthouse apartment for $100 million, which would have made it the most expensive residence in New York City had it been sold at that price. After receiving few offers, the penthouse&#x27;s owner withdrew the unit from the market and offered it for sale himself, only to withdraw it again in 2015. At that point, the majority of CitySpire&#x27;s residences, over sixty percent, were being used as pieds-a-terre rather than as primary residences. , CitySpire&#x27;s commercial occupants include New York Road Runners, Windels Marx, and Brown Shoe Company.

== Critical reception ==
When CitySpire was being planned, Paul Goldberger praised Jahn for including design elements inspired by both City Center and earlier New York City skyscrapers. However, he said the design was &quot;only partially successful in terms of its relationship to the City Center building itself&quot;, especially as both buildings&#x27; domes were rarely visible simultaneously. Harry Berkowitz of &quot;Newsday&quot; described the project as one of several designed by architects who &quot;want little to do with the idea of adjusting to a neighborhood&quot;. Paul M. Sachner wrote for &quot;Architectural Record&quot; that the plans &quot;exemplify the &#x27;high-tech historicist&#x27; quality&quot; of Murphy/Jahn&#x27;s work, but he said &quot;many question the appropriateness of a 70-story building&quot; on such a narrow site.

By the time CitySpire was completed, Goldberger believed it looked weaker than the neighboring Carnegie Hall and Metropolitan towers, even though CitySpire had looked better in conceptual depictions. CitySpire, Carnegie Hall Tower, and Metropolitan Tower became known as the &quot;Tuning Fork Trio&quot; because of their shape and proximity to each other. John McPhee of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote in 2003 that the buildings &quot;look like three chopsticks incongruously holding a cocktail blini&quot;, as they surrounded the small Russian Tea Room.

CitySpire&#x27;s construction also prompted discussion on the appropriateness of transferring air rights from city landmarks, such as City Center, to raise money for landmarks&#x27; upkeep. New York Landmarks Conservancy executive director Laurie Beckelman said that &quot;we save [city landmarks] by putting them out of context&quot; in allowing the transfers, and Community Board 5 district manager Joan E. Ramer said that &quot;selling off a precious city resource without understanding the ramifications is simply irresponsible&quot;. Former city planning commissioner Martin Gallent said the zoning exceptions allowed midtown Manhattan to be more &quot;overly dense&quot; than it already was. After the height compromise in 1988, Goldberger said, &quot;What is to prevent another developer from adding 22 feet to his building and offering to build two dance studios?&quot; Goldberger also referred to CitySpire as a &quot;case of the city selling its birthright for a mess of pottage&quot;.

<doc id="994604" wikidata="Q3568933" url="?curid=994604" title="William Sawtrey">
<text>William Sawtrey, also known as William Salter (died March 1401) was an English Roman Catholic priest and Lollard martyr. He was executed for heresy.

Sawtrey was born in Norfolk, England. He was a follower of John Wycliffe, the leader of an early reformation movement called Lollardy.

==Sawtrey&#x27;s association with Lollardy==
Sawtrey was a priest at two Norfolk churches, St Margaret&#x27;s in Lynn and Tilney.

He preached and endorsed Lollard beliefs, including the rejection of Catholic saints and the sacrament of Eucharist. Of the latter, he claimed that &quot;after the consecration [of the host] by the priest there remaineth true material bread&quot; (Trevelyan 334).

As a result of spreading these views, Sawtrey was taken to Henry le Despenser on 30 April 1399. Le Despenser, at the time the Bishop of Norwich, ordered an examination of Sawtrey. The examination lasted for two days, held at the Bishop&#x27;s palace, South Elmham Hall. Sawtrey&#x27;s examiners claimed that he rejected free will, and that he did not believe in venerating images and embarking on pilgrimages. He was therefore charged with heresy and held in an episcopal prison. A mound was being prepared for the lollard on nearby Greshaw Green, a nearby large common. As this would provide a suitable site for the burning of a heretic, lollard scholar Maureen Jurkowski, has suggested that this may have persuaded Sawtrey to secure his release by denouncing Lollardy. He abjured privately at first, but then publicly in Lynn on 25 May 1399. He appeared before le Despenser in St John&#x27;s Hospital, Lynn, the next day, and swore on the Gospels that he would never again preach Lollardy. He also promised to never hear confession without a license from le Despenser. His abjuration was repeated in the Bishop&#x27;s Chapel, South Elmham several days later.

In 1401, Sawtrey moved to London and began working as a parish-priest at St Osyth&#x27;s, where he continued to preach Lollard beliefs. It is possible that he moved to London in order to distance himself from le Despenser, but he had not removed himself from the anti-Lollard sentiment of the Catholic Church. One year earlier, &quot;De heretico comburendo&quot; (&quot;Regarding the burning of heretics&quot;) was passed. The statute called for the burning of heretics either plainly rejecting Catholicism, or accepting Catholic beliefs but returning to their previous heretical beliefs. Sawtrey was summoned to appear at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 12 February 1401.

Sawtrey appeared before Archbishop Thomas Arundel. Before convocation, Sawtrey was delivered the following heretical charges: failure to &quot;adore the true cross&quot; (National Biography 869), belief that a priest&#x27;s time spent in hourly prayers could be better spent preaching and spreading the word of God, his opinion on the temporalities of the church and on how the money could be put to better use, preaching on adoration of mankind over angels, and finally his belief in consubstantiation. Sawtrey resisted, and was once again charged with heresy.

Sawtrey demanded a copy of his charges and was given 18 February to make an appeal. At his appeal before Parliament he defended his beliefs with quotes from St John, St Paul, and St Augustine. His defence was heavily questioned by Arundel, who spent three hours questioning of the topic of the Eucharist alone, all the while trying to convert him back to Catholicism. Sawtrey resisted, and on 23 February charges were once again made against him. He was condemned and &quot;through seven successive stages he was degraded from priest to doorkeeper, then stripped of every clerical function, attribute, and vestment&quot;.

Sawtrey was convicted and sentenced to death on 26 February 1401. In March, he was taken to Smithfield and publicly burned at the stake. He was the first follower of Lollardy to die for his beliefs. He and John Purvey, a friend and follower of John Wycliffe who also was tortured for his beliefs, were the two most egregious cases against Lollardy committed under the Statute of Heresy.

==After effects==
The lower classes of England were quick to catch on to Lollard ideas, especially about disbursing Church funds to aid people in need and to ease lower class financial stresses caused by heavy taxation. The representatives of the lower class made efforts on two occasions to convince King Henry IV and Parliament to appropriate the Church&#x27;s money and to use it for the people of England. The Church reacted against this proposal and, with the help of the King, set forth a number of statutes to protect Church temporalities. Among these orders was the statute De heretico comburendo, which stated that heresy was punishable by means of public burning.

The severity of Sawtrey and Purvey&#x27;s punishments created a wave of Lollard supporters. Among them was John Oldcastle, a knight and captain for the Prince of Wales. He protected and hid preachers from the Statute of Heresy. Oldcastle and other Lollard-sympathising knights pleaded with King Henry IV to change the law. They argued that the King should take the money the Church was wasting and put it into England&#x27;s armoury, almshouses, and universities. Many students of Oxford University were also Lollard sympathisers. Students translated Wycliffe&#x27;s work and began to debate the lawfulness of Bible translations.

However, despite their efforts, the persecution of Lollards continued. The knights&#x27; arguments were shot down, and Oxford was discredited by the Church. Nevertheless, Lollard believers continued practising their faith in an underground network.

<text>Asma Jilani Jahangir (; 27 January 1952 – 11 February 2018) was a Pakistani human rights lawyer and social activist who co-founded and chaired the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and AGHS Legal Aid Cell. Jahangir was known for playing a prominent role in the Lawyers&#x27; Movement and served as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief and as a trustee at the International Crisis Group.

Born and raised in Lahore, Jahangir studied at the Convent of Jesus and Mary before receiving her B.A. from Kinnaird and LLB from the Punjab University Law College in 1978 and joined the chamber of Barrister Ijaz Hussain Batalvi. In 1980, she was called to the Lahore High Court, and to the Supreme Court in 1982. In the 1980s, Jahangir became a democracy activist and was imprisoned in 1983 for participating in the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy against the military regime of Zia-ul-Haq. In 1986, she moved to Geneva, and became the vice-chair of the Defence for Children International and remained until 1988 when she returned to Pakistan.

In 1987, Jahangir co-founded the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and became its Secretary-General. In 1993, she was elevated as the commission&#x27;s chairperson. She was again put under house arrest in November 2007 after the imposition of emergency. After serving as one of the leaders of the Lawyers&#x27; Movement, she became Pakistan&#x27;s first woman to serve as the President of Supreme Court Bar Association, she presided over a Seminar to pay homage to Barrister Ijaz Hussain Batalvi organised by Akhtar Aly Kureshy Convenier Ijaz Hussain Batalvi Foundation. She co-chaired South Asia Forum for Human Rights and was the vice president of International Federation for Human Rights. Jahangir served as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion from August 2004 to July 2010, including serving on the U.N. panel for inquiry into Sri Lankan human rights violations and on a United Nations fact-finding mission on Israeli settlements. In 2016, she was named as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Iran, remaining until her death in February 2018.
Jahangir is the recipient of several awards including the 2014 Right Livelihood Award (along with Edward Snowden) for &quot;defending, protecting and promoting human rights in Pakistan and more widely, often in very difficult and complex situations and at great personal risk&quot;, 2010 Freedom Award, Hilal-i-Imtiaz in 2010, Sitara-i-Imtiaz, Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2005, 1995 Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders, and the UNESCO/Bilbao Prize for the Promotion of a Culture of Human Rights. She was awarded a Legion of Honour by France, and in 2016 the University of Pennsylvania Law School awarded her an honorary degree. Her writings include &quot;The Hudood Ordinance: A Divine Sanction?&quot; and &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot;.

Jahangir was posthumously awarded the Nishan-e-Imtiaz on 23 March 2018, the highest degree of service to the state, and for services to international diplomacy by Mamnoon Hussain.

== Early life and education ==
Asma Jahangir was born and raised in Lahore, Pakistan, into a prosperous and politically active Kakazai Pashtun family, with a history of activism and human rights work. Her father, Malik Ghulam Jilani, was a civil servant who entered politics upon retirement and spent years both in jail and under house arrest for opposing military dictatorships. Malik was imprisoned on several occasions for his outspoken views, which included denouncing the Pakistani government for genocide during their military action in what is now Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan).

Her mother, Begum Sabiha Jilani (1927–2012), was educated at a co-ed college named Forman Christian College situated in Lahore, at a time when few Muslim women even received higher education. Sabiha also fought the traditional system, pioneering her own clothing business until her family&#x27;s lands were confiscated in 1967 as a result of her husband&#x27;s opinions and detention.

Jahangir herself became involved at a young age in protests against the military regime as well as opposing her father&#x27;s detention by then president, Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1972. She received her B.A. from Kinnaird College, Lahore and her Bachelor of Law degree (LLB) in 1978, from Punjab University Law College. She also held an honorary doctorate from University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, Queens University, Canada, Simon Fraser University, Canada and Cornell University, United States.

== Personal life ==
Asma Jilani married Tahir Jahangir, a member of business clan who owns Premier Group. He currently serves as the chairman of the Punjab Oil Mills. They had a son, Jillani Jahangir who runs family business, and two daughters, Munizae Jahangir, a journalist and Sulema Jahangir, who is also a lawyer. Her family is one of the sponsor of the Punjab Oil Mills which sells cooking oil under brands, Canolive and Zaiqa.

== Activism ==
She spent her career defending the human and women&#x27;s rights, rights of religious minorities and children in Pakistan. Jahangir was a staunch critic of the Hudood Ordinance and blasphemy laws of Pakistan put in place as part of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s Islamization program in Pakistan. She was a founding member of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, and served as Secretary-General and later Chairperson of the organisation.

In 1980, Jahangir and her sister, Hina Jilani, got together with fellow activists and lawyers to form the first law firm established by women in Pakistan. In the same year they also helped form the Women’s Action Forum (WAF), a pressure group campaigning against Pakistan&#x27;s discriminatory legislation, most notably against the Proposed Law of Evidence, where the value of a woman&#x27;s testimony was reduced to half that of a man&#x27;s testimony, and the Hadood Ordinances, where victims of rape had to prove their innocence or else face punishment themselves. On 12 February 1983, the Punjab Women Lawyers Association in Lahore organised a public protest (one of its leaders was Jahangir) against the Proposed Law of Evidence, during which Jahangir and other participating WAF members were beaten, teargassed, and arrested by police.

The first WAF demonstration, however, took place in 1983 when some 25–50 women took to the streets protesting the controversial case of Safia Bibi. In 1983, Safia, a blind 13-year-old girl, was raped by her employers, and as a result became pregnant, yet ended up in jail charged with fornication (zina) sentenced to flogging, three years of imprisonment and fined. Jahangir defended Safia in her appeal and eventually the verdict was over-ruled by an appeals court due to pressure and protests. They would say: &quot;We [their law firm] had been given a lot of cases by the advocate general and the moment this demonstration came to light, the cases were taken away from us.&quot; In 1982, Jahangir earned the nickname &quot;little heroine&quot; after leading a protest march in Islamabad against a decision by then-president Zia-ul-Haq to enforce religious laws and stated: &quot;Family laws [which are religious laws] give women few rights&quot; and that &quot;They have to be reformed because Pakistan cannot live in isolation. We cannot remain shackled while other women progress&quot;.

In 1986, Jahangir and Hina set up AGHS Legal Aid Cell, the first free legal aid centre in Pakistan. The AGHS Legal Aid Cell in Lahore also runs a shelter for women, called &#x27;Dastak&#x27;, looked after by her secretary Munib Ahmed. She was also a proponent of protecting the rights of persecuted religious minorities in Pakistan and spoke out against forced conversions. Jahangir campaigned against human rights abuses taking place in government and police custody in Pakistan. In a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, she said that &quot;Women are arrested, raped and sexually assaulted every day in the presence of female constables, who find themselves helpless in such situations&quot;.

In 1996, the Lahore High Court ruled that an adult Muslim woman could not get married without the consent of her male guardian (wali). Women, who chose their husbands independently, could be forced to annul their marriages and the repercussions were highlighted by Jahangir, who also took on such cases (i.e. the case of Saima Waheed); &quot;Hundreds have already been arrested. This is simply going to open up the floodgates for the harassment of women and girls by their families and the authorities. The courts have sanctioned their oppression. Thousands more are bound to be affected by this.&quot;

Jahangir demanded that the government of Parvez Musharraf work to improve the record of human rights domestically. Citing examples of human rights abuses, she wrote, &quot;A Hindu income tax inspector gets lynched in the presence of the army personnel for allegedly having made a remark on the beard of a trader. Promptly, the unfortunate Hindu government servant is booked for having committed blasphemy, while the traders and the Lashkar-e-Taiba activists were offered tea over parleys. A seventy-year-old Mukhtaran Bibi and her pregnant daughter Samina are languishing in Sheikhupura jail on trumped-up charges of blasphemy&quot;. She was also an active opponent of child labour and capital punishment: &quot;It would be hypocrisy to defend laws I don&#x27;t believe in, like capital punishment, the blasphemy law and laws against women and in favor of child labor.&quot; Asma Jahangir served as the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions from 1998 to 2004, and as the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion and Belief from 2004 to 2010. In her capacity as a UN official, Jahangir was in Pakistan, when Pervez Musharraf declared a state of emergency in 2007. In November 2006, she participated the international meeting for The Yogyakarta Principles as one of 29 experts. On 5 November 2007, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour indicated that Jahangir was among the judicial and political officials detained by the Musharraf government.

On 18 January 2017, Jahangir became the first Pakistani to deliver the 2017 Amartya Sen Lecture at the London School of Economics, where she called for a counter-narrative of liberal politics to challenge religious intolerance. She added that there was a &quot;large scale impunity&quot; among those who commit crimes in the name of religion, and this has to be addressed at the national as well as the international levels, the rights activist said. &quot;In 1986, Pakistan got the blasphemy law. So, while we had just two cases of blasphemy before that year, now we have thousands. It shows that one should be careful while bringing religion into legislation, because the law itself can become an instrument of persecution,&quot; she added.

In August 2017, Jahangir represented the families of terror convicts sentenced to death by military tribunals before the Supreme Court in &quot;Said Zaman Khan v. Federation of Pakistan&quot;. Jahangir asked order retrial in all cases in which military courts handed down convictions, including capital punishments, but the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the sentence of the convicts on 29 August 2017.

Asma spoke against the five member Supreme Court judgment which deposed Nawaz Sharif from his premiership. She questioned why members of Inter-Services Intelligence and Military intelligence were inducted in Joint Investigation team ferreting out corruption by Sharif&#x27;s family and his close companions. She questioned how the Panama case five judges would have felt if members of the ISI and MI were inducted in Supreme Judicial Council, a body authorised to punish erring judges. Earlier she had suggested that ousted prime minister would get no relief from Supreme Court but from coming on streets.

In December 2017, Jahangir called for a probe by a parliamentary committee to ascertain as to who was behind the recent Faizabad sit-in. She questioned &quot;We need to know how the army became a guarantor during the agreement between the government and protesters. Why money was distributed among the protesters,&quot;.

In her last case before the Supreme Court, Jahangir appeared for former Member of the National Assembly Rai Hasan Nawaz in &quot;Sami Ullah Baloch v. Abdul Karim Nousherwani&quot; in February 2018. She argued that there should not be a constant period of electoral disqualification under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution, but courts should decide the question according to the conduct of individuals. She said the Supreme Court had held Nawaz Sharif eligible to contest elections in 2009 by deeming him &quot;sadiq&quot; and &quot;ameen&quot;, but now it was difficult to understand whether the court had increased the bar of honesty or reduced it.

=== House arrest ===
On 5 November 2007, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that &quot;Over 500 lawyers, opposition politicians and human rights activists have been arrested. They include Asma Jahangir, boss of the country&#x27;s human-rights commission and a former UN special rapporteur. In an e-mail from her house arrest, where she has been placed for 90 days, Ms Jahangir regretted that General Musharraf had &#x27;lost his marbles&#x27;&quot;.

According to &quot;Dawn&quot; &quot;many people go ballistic every time her name is mentioned&quot;, adding that &quot;a pattern: often wild, unsubstantiated allegations are levelled against her.&quot; According to Herald &quot;HRCP in general and Asma Jahangir in particular have also been branded as &#x27;traitors&#x27; and &#x27;American agents&#x27;, trying to malign Pakistan and destroy the country&#x27;s social and political fabric in the name of women’s rights and the rights of non-Muslims.&quot; Commenting on her legal style, &quot;Dawn&quot; wrote that she used &quot;calculated aggression, wit and sharp one-liners.&quot; In the mid-1980s, the Zia-ul-Haq-appointed Majlis-e-Shoora passed a resolution claiming that Jahangir had blasphemed and she should be sentenced to death. She was found not guilty of blasphemy.

Declan Walsh, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, described Jahangir&#x27;s career as &quot;for almost four decades she has towered over Pakistan&#x27;s human rights war.&quot; Adding that &quot;she has championed battered wives, rescued teenagers from death row, defended people accused of blasphemy, and sought justice for the victims of honour killings. These battles have won her admirers and enemies in great number.&quot; Abbas Nasir has described her as the &quot;gutsiest woman that Pakistan has&quot;. William Dalrymple, writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, described Jahangir as Pakistan&#x27;s &quot;most visible and celebrated—as well as most vilified—human-rights lawyer&quot;, adding that she has &quot;spent her professional life fighting for a secular civil society, challenging the mullahs and generals.&quot;

Several conservative and nationalist commenters have written extensively against Jahangir. Ansar Abbasi and Orya Maqbool Jan have been critical of Jahangir. On 3 September 2013, NDTV reported that US intelligence agencies had uncovered evidence of a plot hatched by Pakistani security officials to use militants to kill human rights activist Asma Jahangir in India in May 2012. Jahangir has received numerous threats over the years due to her activism and human rights work
and particularly after defending a 14-year-old Christian boy, Salamat Masih, accused of blasphemy and ultimately winning the case in 1995, a mob at the High Court smashed Jahangir&#x27;s car, assaulted her and her driver, threatening her with death. Jahangir and her family have been attacked, taken hostage, had their home broken into and received death threats ever since, but she continued her battle for justice.

When Jahangir undertook the case of Saima Sarwar in 1999, who was given shelter at Dastak after leaving her husband, wanting a divorce and later gunned down by her family in an act of honour killing, Jahangir received death threats for representing Saima in her divorce proceedings. In May 2005 Jahangir announced that she would hold a symbolic mixed-gender marathon in Lahore to raise awareness about violence against women. This was following the revelations of cases such as Mukhtar Mai. Tensions boiled over, as Islamist groups and supporters of the political Islamist alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) armed with firearms, batons and Molotov cocktails, violently opposed the race, and Jahangir received especially rough treatment from local police and intelligence agents, who began to strip off her clothes in public. Of this Jahangir said &quot;A lot of people tried to cover my back because I could only feel it I could not see my back. When they were putting me on the police van, they assured that my photograph was taken while my back was bare. This was just to humiliate, this was simply just to humiliate me.&quot; A police officer told Jahangir that they had orders to be strict and to tear off the participant&#x27;s clothes. In addition she along with other participants was also beaten.

The character of Saamiya Siddiqui, a lawyer in the 2004 Indian film &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; portrayed by Rani Mukherji, was based on Jehangir where she fights for the case of an Indian Air Force officer imprisoned on false charges in Pakistan. She had also appeared as an interviewee on an Indian television talk show &quot;Not a Nice Man to Know&quot; (1998), hosted by Khushwant Singh, on Star TV India.

== Author ==
In addition to many publications, Jahangir wrote two books: &quot;Divine Sanction? The Hudood Ordinance&quot; (1988, 2003) and &quot;Children of a Lesser God: Child Prisoners of Pakistan&quot; (1992). She also wrote the article &quot;Whither are We!&quot;, published in &quot;Dawn&quot;, on 2 October 2000.

<text>The Army Nuclear Power Program (ANPP) was a program of the United States Army to develop small pressurized water and boiling water nuclear power reactors to generate electrical and space-heating energy primarily at remote, relatively inaccessible sites. The ANPP had several accomplishments, but ultimately it was considered to be &quot;a solution in search of a problem.&quot; The U.S. Army Engineer Reactors Group managed this program and it was headquartered at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. The program began in 1954 as the Army Reactors Branch and had effectively terminated by about 1977, with the last class of NPP operators graduating in 1977. Work continued for some time thereafter either for decommissioning of the plants or placing them into SAFSTOR (long term storage and monitoring before decommissioning). The current development of small modular reactors has led to a renewed interest in military applications.

==Background==
There was interest in the possible application of nuclear power to land-based military needs as early as 1952. A memo from the Secretary of Defense, dated 10 February 1954, assigned the Army the responsibility for &quot;developing nuclear power plants to supply heat and electricity at remote and relatively inaccessible military installations.&quot; The Secretary of the Army established the Army Nuclear Power Program and assigned it to the Corps of Engineers.

The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 made the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) responsible for R&amp;D in the nuclear field, so that the ANPP then became a joint interagency &#x27;activity&#x27; of the Department of the Army (DA) and the AEC. When the Atomic Energy Act was revised in 1954, Paragraph 91b authorized the Department of Defense to obtain special nuclear material for use in defense utilization facilities. The focus of the Army Nuclear Power Program was on power production facilities while the Naval Reactors Program concentrated on nuclear propulsion for submarines and ships. On 9 April 1954 the Chief of Engineers established the US Army Engineer Reactors Group to perform the missions assigned by DA. Essentially, these missions were to:
* conduct R&amp;D, with the AEC, on nuclear power plant development;
* operate the Corps of Engineers nuclear power plants;
* carry out training in support of the plants;
* provide technical support to other agencies as required;
* develop programs for application of nuclear reactors to military needs.

In a Department of the Army Approved Qualitative Materiel Development Objective for Nuclear Power Plants, dated 7 January 1965, these objectives were stated for the program:

* Reduction or elimination of dependence on [fossil] fuel sources.
* Reduction or elimination of logistic burden necessary to support conventional power plants.
* Reliable operation.
* Infrequent refueling and maintenance.
* Reduced crew size, with ultimate goal of unattended operation.
* Transportability, mobility, and reaction times compatible with the mission or equipment to be supported.
* Improved cost-effectiveness.

The AEC ultimately concluded that the probability of achieving the objectives of the Army Nuclear Power Program in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost was not high enough to justify continued funding of its portion of projects to develop small, stationary, and mobile reactors. Cutbacks in military funding for long-range research and development because of the Vietnam War led the AEC to phase out its support of the program in 1966. The costs of developing and producing compact nuclear power plants were so high that they could be justified only if the reactor had a unique capability and filled a clearly defined objective backed by DOD. After that, the Army&#x27;s participation in nuclear power plant research and development efforts steadily declined and eventually stopped altogether.

==List of plants==
Eight plants were constructed. Due to the requirement for a small physical size, all these reactors other than the MH-1A used highly enriched uranium (HEU). The MH-1A had more space to work with, and more weight-carrying capacity, so this was a low-enrichment reactor; i.e., larger and heavier. The MH-1A was briefly considered for use in Vietnam, but the idea of anything nuclear in Vietnam was quickly rejected by the State Department.

The plants are listed in order of their initial criticality. See the gallery of photos in the next section. Sources for this data include the only known book on the ANPP, by Suid, and a DOE document.

* SM-1: 2 MW electric. Fort Belvoir, Virginia, Initial criticality April 8, 1957 (several months before the Shippingport Reactor) and the first U.S. nuclear power plant to be connected to an electrical grid. Used primarily for training and testing, rather than power generation for Ft. Belvoir. The plant was designed by the American Locomotive Company (renamed ALCO Products, in 1955), and was the first reactor developed under the Army Nuclear Power Program. See the SM-1 image gallery, below. This plant was a tri-service training facility, with both the US Navy and Air Force sending personnel to be trained on shore-based facilities (the Navy had a different stand-alone program for ship-based nuclear power, which is still in operation). The SM-1 and associated training facilities at Ft. Belvoir were the only training facility for shore-based military power plants. The plant cooled its condensers using the waters of the Potomac River. For about the first 10 years of its operation, the SM-1 unknowingly released tritium into the waters of the Chesapeake Bay, until the development of the Packard Tri-Carb detector, which was the first detector system capable of detecting the low-energy beta decay of tritium. The instrumentation in the SM-1 pre-dated the development of solid-state devices and used vacuum tubes.

* SL-1: Boiling water reactor, 200 kW electrical, 400 kW thermal for heating, National Reactor Testing Station, Idaho. Initial criticality August 11, 1958. The SL-1 was designed by the Argonne National Laboratory to gain experience in boiling water reactor operations, develop performance characteristics, train military crews, and test components. Combustion Engineering was awarded a contract by the AEC to operate the SL-1 and in turn employed the Army&#x27;s military operating crew to continue running the plant. This BWR was specifically designed to power DEW line stations.
: On January 3, 1961, the reactor was being prepared for restart after a shutdown of eleven days over the holidays. Maintenance procedures were in progress which required the main central control rod to be manually withdrawn a few inches to reconnect it to its drive mechanism; at 9:01 p.m. this rod was suddenly withdrawn too far, causing SL-1 to go prompt critical instantly. In four milliseconds, the heat generated by the resulting enormous power surge caused fuel in the core to explosively vaporize. The nuclear fission reaction directly heated the water, flashing a large amount into steam. Melting aluminum reacted with water producing hydrogen gas. The exploding fuel plates, violent metal-water reaction, and expanding water vapor pressed upwards on the water above the core, sending a pressure wave that struck the top of the reactor vessel. The force impinged on the lid of the reactor vessel, causing water and steam to spray from the top of the vessel. This extreme form of water hammer propelled top head shielding, remnants of fuel plates, five loose shield plugs, a nozzle flange, and the entire reactor vessel upwards. A later investigation concluded that the vessel had jumped in the air before striking the overhead bridge crane drive shaft. The vessel settled back into its original location, leaving little evidence of this except scattered debris. The spray of water and steam knocked two operators onto the floor, killing one and severely injuring another. One of the loose shield plugs on top of the reactor vessel impaled the third man through his groin and exited his shoulder, pinning him to the ceiling.The victims were Army Specialists John A. Byrnes (age 27) and Richard Leroy McKinley (age 22), and Navy Seabee Construction Electrician First Class (CE1) Richard C. Legg (age 26).
: It was later established that Byrnes (the reactor operator) had lifted the rod and caused the excursion, Legg (the shift supervisor) was standing on top of the reactor vessel and was impaled and pinned to the ceiling, and McKinley, the trainee who stood nearby, was later found alive by rescuers. All three men succumbed to injuries from physical trauma; the radiation from the nuclear excursion would have given the men no chance of survival.
: This was the only fatal incident at a US nuclear power reactor, which destroyed the reactor. This incident was important in the development of commercial power because future designs prevented the core from going critical with the removal of a single rod.

* PM-2A: 2 MW electric, plus heating. Camp Century, Greenland. Initial criticality October 3, 1960. The first &quot;portable&quot; nuclear power reactor. Brought to Greenland in parts, assembled, operated, disassembled, shipped back to United States. The PM-2A in Camp Century was designed by the American Locomotive Company to demonstrate the ability to assemble a nuclear power plant from prefabricated components in a remote, arctic location. PM-2A operated at a uranium-235 enrichment of 93 percent.

In 1961, after the SL-1 plant explosion, General Alvin Luedecke, the General Manager of the AEC, temporarily prevented the startup of the PM-2A until an interlock could be installed on the central control rod. While the interlock could be operated by personnel, General Luedecke would have to be notified first. The PM-2A was the only reactor besides SL-1 that had a central control rod that could startup the reactor on its own.

We gave explicit instructions on the 8th of January that this reactor, which was shut down at the time, would not be started until we had reviewed the situation.

It was necessary for us to issue instructions to modify mechanisms of the PM-2A so that no single rod could be raised to a point where criticality could automatically occur.

PM-2A successfully powered Camp Century for three years. The pressure vessel was also used to investigate neutron embrittlement in carbon steel. This plant was shut down 1963–1964. However despite the reactor&#x27;s successes, Project Iceworm was never fielded and Camp Century was later abandoned.

* ML-1: first closed cycle gas turbine. Initial criticality was on March 30, 1961. Designed for 300 kW, but only achieved 140 kW. Operated for only a few hundred hours of testing. The ML-1 was designed by Aerojet General Corporation to test an integrated reactor package that was transportable by military semi-trailers, railroad flatcars, and barges. This reactor was shut down in 1965.
* PM-1: 1.25 MW electric, plus heating. Sundance Air Force Station, Wyoming. Owned by the Air Force, this pressurized water reactor was used to power a radar station. Initial criticality was on February 25, 1962. The PM-1 was designed by the Martin Company and provided electric power to the 731st Radar Squadron of the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD). This plant was shut down in 1968. PM-1 operated at a uranium-235 enrichment of 93 percent.
* PM-3A: 1.75 MW electric, plus heating and desalinization. McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Owned by the Navy. Initial criticality March 3, 1962, decommissioned 1972. The PM-3A, located at McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, was designed by the Martin Company to provide electric power and steam heating to the Naval Air Facility at McMurdo Sound. PM-3A operated at a uranium-235 enrichment of 93 percent.
: The PM-3A (Portable, Medium-power, 3rd generation) was a plant installed to provide power for the McMurdo Base in Antarctica. During 1970–1971, it achieved a world-record power run. It was one of the first shore-based power plants to use solid-state equipment. The PM-3A was not operated by the Army, but was under the NAVFAC (Naval Facilities Engineering Command), the shore-based power division of the US Navy. Although the majority of the personnel were Navy, the PM-3A was a tri-service stationing. For 1970-1971, there was an Army sergeant and an Air Force sergeant stationed with the crew. The plant was air-cooled with the condensers and fan units running glycol. Waste heat was also used for desalination using vacuum flash distillation. The reactor was located in buried tanks in the ground.
: The plant suffered from a multitude of problems, including a fire and coolant leakage. It was shut down in September 1972. After decommissioning, the plant was cut into pieces and transported to the US for burial. The soil surrounding the tanks had become radioactive, so it was also removed and transported to Port Hueneme Naval Base, California, where it was incorporated into asphalt pavement.
* SM-1A: 2 MW electric, plus heating. Fort Greely, Alaska. Initial criticality March 13, 1962. The SM-1A at Ft. Greely, Alaska, was designed by ALCO Products and was the first field facility developed under the Army Nuclear Power Program. This site was selected to develop construction methods in a remote, Arctic location, and study its economics compared with fuel oil systems in a remote area. This plant was shut down in 1972. SM-1A operated at a uranium-235 enrichment of 93 percent. In 2022, the Army Corps of Engineers awarded a first stage contract to decommission and dismantle SM-1A, but after a contract appeal allocated it to a different contractor in 2023. Total decommissioning cost was estimated at $243 million.


* MH-1A: 10 MW electric, plus fresh water supply to the adjacent base. Mounted on the &quot;Sturgis&quot;, a barge (no propulsion systems) converted from a Liberty ship, and moored in the Panama Canal Zone. Initial criticality at Ft. Belvoir (in Gunston Cove, off the Potomac River), January 24, 1967. It was the last of the eight plants to permanently cease operation. The MH-1A was designed by Martin Marietta Corporation. It remained moored at Gatun Lake in the Panama Canal from 1968 until 1977, when it was towed back to Ft. Belvoir for decommissioning. This reactor used low-enrichment uranium (LEU) in the range of 4 to 7 percent. It was moved to the James River Reserve Fleet in 1978 for SAFSTOR. The MH-1A had an elaborate analog-computer-powered simulator installed at the Training Division, USAERG, Ft. Belvoir. The MH-1A simulator was obtained by Memphis State University Center for Nuclear Studies in the early 1980s, but was never restored or returned to operational service. Its dismantling was completed in March 2019.
* MM-1: ~2.5 MW electric, Conceptualized but never built. Conceived as the &quot;Military Compact Reactor&quot;. A truck mounted liquid metal cooled reactor, with shorter start up and shut down times. Requiring no shielding of Earth or exclusion zones to protect the operators from radiation. With its reactor core containing the energy equivalent of over 8 million pounds of gasoline. Envisioned to have higher power density; its power output meant for the first time the powerplant would weigh less than a diesel generator of comparable output. While initially meant to power bases and field operations, the program was shifted to the Army&#x27;s &quot;Energy Depot Concept&quot; to investigate the production of synthetic fuels. The reactor and associated trailers would produce liquid fuels for tanks, trucks, armored personnel carriers, and aircraft and drastically reduce the vulnerable petroleum logistical supply chain. The associated trailers would use chemical conversion processes to convert the reactor&#x27;s waste heat energy into useful fuels using elements universally found in air and water (hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon), potentially producing methanol, liquid hydrogen and/or ammonia.

Key to the codes:
* First letter: S – stationary, M – mobile, P – portable.

==Nuclear power plant operator training==
The Nuclear Power Plant Operator Course (NPPOC) was conducted at Ft. Belvoir. Applicants for the program were enlisted men who had to commit to serving a minimum of two years after completion of training. The requirements for admission to the NPPOC included aptitude test scores at least as stringent as those required for admission to Officer Candidate School. Over 1,000 Nuclear Power Plant operators were licensed between the years 1958 through 1977. The NPPOC was an intense and academically challenging year-long course.

<doc id="994636" wikidata="Q3296641" url="?curid=994636" title="Aberdeen Parish, New Brunswick">
<text>Aberdeen is a geographic parish in Carleton County, New Brunswick, Canada, located in the interior east of the Saint John River.

Prior to the 2023 governance reform, for governance purposes it was comprised two local service districts (LSD), both of which were members of the Western Valley Regional Service Commission (WVRSC).

The Census subdivision of Aberdeen Parish shares the geographic parish&#x27;s borders. Revised census figures based on the 2023 local governance reforms have not been released.

==Origin of name==
Aberdeen, Scotland was the source of many settlers of Glassville Settlement. Also possible is that the parish was named in honour of either the Earl of Aberdeen, a former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom who died shortly before Glassville was settled, or his youngest son Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, who was Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick when the parish was erected.

==History==
Aberdeen was erected in 1863 from Brighton, Kent, and Peel Parishes. Most of the parish had formed the southeastern part of Kent, with Peel and Brighton providing a strip of territory along their northern edge.

==Boundaries==
Aberdeen Parish is bounded:

* on the west by the western side of grants running along the Ketchum Ridge, West Glassville, Old West Glassville, Shikatehawk, and Denney Hill Roads;
* on the north by the north line of a grant on the Denney Hill Road prolonged to the York County line;
* on the east by the York County line;
* on the south by the southern line of a grant southwest of the intersection of the Black Brook and Ketchum Ridge roads, prolonged to the York County line.

===Evolution of boundaries===
The original boundaries of Aberdeen have changed little, unusual among Carleton County&#x27;s parishes.

In 1896 the northwestern corner and northern boundary were changed to better match grant lines, taking a long narrow triangle of territory from Kent Parish while losing a few acres in the northwestern corner.

In 1956 the western boundary was altered slightly, transferring a Crown Reserved Road to Kent Parish. This may have been an error, as the same Act corrected two wording errors that dated to 1896.

==Local service districts==
Both LSDs assessed for the basic LSD services of fire protection, police services, land use planning, emergency measures, and dog control.

===Aberdeen Parish===
The local service district of the parish of Aberdeen originally comprised the entire parish.

It was established 23 November 1966 to assess for fire protection. Community services were added on 20 December 1967.

In 2020, Aberdeen additionally assessed for community &amp; recreation services. The taxing authority is 207.00 Aberdeen.

LSD advisory committee: Yes. Chair Gailen Allan sat on the WVRSC board from at least 2015.

===Glassville===
Glassville comprised an irregular area around the junction of Route 107, Route 580, and the Centre Glassville Road.

The LSD was established on 18 December 1974 to add street lighting and first aid &amp; ambulance services.

In 2020, Glassville additionally assesses for street lighting. The taxing authority is 223.00 Glassville.

LSD advisory committee: Yes. Chair Brent Pearson sat on the WVRSC board from at least 2015.

<doc id="994639" wikidata="Q202210" url="?curid=994639" title="GameStop">
<text>GameStop Corp. is an American video game, consumer electronics, and gaming merchandise retailer, headquartered in Grapevine, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), and the brand is the largest video game retailer worldwide. , the company operates 4,169 stores including 2,915 both in the United States, 203 in Canada, 404 in Australia and 647 in Europe under the GameStop, EB Games, EB Games Australia, Micromania-Zing, ThinkGeek and Zing Pop Culture brands. The company was founded in Dallas in 1984 as Babbage&#x27;s, and took on its current name in 1999. 

The company&#x27;s performance declined during the mid-to-late 2010s due to the shift of video game sales to online shopping and failed investments by GameStop in smartphone retail. In 2021, after retail investors on Reddit noticed that the short interest exceeded 100%, the company&#x27;s stock price skyrocketed from $17.25 to over US$500 per share. According to the SEC report, this volatility was only in part due to the massive buying power of retail investors. The company received significant media attention during January and February 2021 due to the volatility of its stock price in the GameStop short squeeze; the company was ranked 577th on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500. GameStop also used to own and publish the video game magazine &quot;Game Informer&quot; before discontinuing it in August 2024.

Over 400 Gamestop stores were closed in 2025, due to decline in sales, on pace to close twice as many as they did in 2024. Consumer shift to the online marketplace has led to a decline in revenue. This 400 number represents the largest amount of stores that Gamestop has closed in a single month. 
==History==

===Babbage&#x27;s (1980–1994)===
GameStop traces its roots to Babbage&#x27;s, a Dallas, Texas–based software retailer founded on August 20, 1980 by former Harvard Business School classmates James McCurry and Gary M. Kusin. The company was named after Charles Babbage and opened its first store in Dallas&#x27;s NorthPark Center with the help of Ross Perot, an early investor in the company. The company quickly began to focus on video game sales for the then-dominant Atari 2600. Babbage&#x27;s began selling Nintendo games in 1987. Babbage&#x27;s became a public company via an initial public offering in 1988. By 1991, video games accounted for two-thirds of Babbage&#x27;s sales.

===NeoStar Retail Group (1994–1996)===
Babbage&#x27;s merged with Software Etc., an Edina, Minnesota–-based retailer that specialized in personal computing software, to create NeoStar Retail Group in 1994. The merger was structured as a stock swap, where shareholders of Babbage&#x27;s and Software Etc. received shares of NeoStar, a newly formed holding company. Babbage&#x27;s and Software Etc. continued to operate as independent subsidiaries of NeoStar and retained their respective senior management teams. Babbage&#x27;s founder and chairman James McCurry became chairman of NeoStar, while Babbage&#x27;s president Gary Kusin and Software Etc. President Daniel DeMatteo retained their respective titles. Software Etc. chairman Leonard Riggio became chairman of NeoStar&#x27;s executive committee.

Gary Kusin resigned as president of Babbage&#x27;s in February 1995 to start a cosmetics company. Daniel DeMatteo, formerly president of Software Etc., assumed Kusin&#x27;s duties and was promoted to president and chief operating officer of NeoStar. NeoStar chairman James McCurry was also appointed to the newly created position of NeoStar CEO. The company relocated from its headquarters in Dallas to Grapevine later that year.

NeoStar merged its Babbage&#x27;s and Software Etc. units into a single organization in May 1996 amid declining sales. Company president Daniel DeMatteo also resigned, and NeoStar chairman and CEO James McCurry assumed the title of president. In September of that year, after NeoStar was unable to secure the credit necessary to purchase inventory for the holiday season, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and appointed Thomas G. Plaskett chairman while James McCurry remained company chief executive and president.

The leadership changes were not enough; in November 1996, the assets of NeoStar were purchased for $58.5 million by Leonard Riggio, a founder of Software Etc. and chairman and principal stockholder of Barnes &amp; Noble. Electronics Boutique had also bid to purchase NeoStar, but the judge presiding over NeoStar&#x27;s bankruptcy accepted Riggio&#x27;s bid because it kept open 108 stores more than Electronics Boutique&#x27;s bid would have. Approximately 200 retail stores were not included in the transaction and were subsequently closed.

===Babbage&#x27;s Etc. (1996–1999)===
Following his purchase of NeoStar&#x27;s assets, Leonard Riggio dissolved the holding company and created a new holding company named Babbage&#x27;s Etc. He appointed Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Fontaine, previously Software Etc.&#x27;s chief executive during its expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as Babbage Etc.&#x27;s chief executive. Daniel DeMatteo, previously the president of both Software Etc. and NeoStar, became company president and COO. Three years later, in 1999, Babbage&#x27;s Etc. launched its GameStop brand with 30 stores in strip malls. The company also launched gamestop.com, a website that allowed consumers to purchase video games online. GameStop.com was promoted in Babbage&#x27;s and Software Etc. stores.

===Barnes &amp; Noble Booksellers (1999–2004)===
In October 1999, Barnes &amp; Noble Booksellers purchased Babbage&#x27;s Etc. for $215 million. Because Babbage&#x27;s Etc. was principally owned by Leonard Riggio, who was also Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s chairman and principal shareholder, a special committee of independent directors of Barnes &amp; Noble Booksellers evaluated and signed off on the deal. A few months later, in May 2000, Barnes &amp; Noble acquired Funco, the owner of Eden Prairie, Minnesota–based video game retailer FuncoLand, for $160 million. Babbage&#x27;s Etc., which had been previously operating as a direct subsidiary of Barnes &amp; Noble, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Funco. With its acquisition of Funco, Barnes &amp; Noble also acquired Game Informer, a video game magazine that was first published in 1991. Funco was renamed GameStop, Inc. in December 2000 in anticipation of holding an initial public offering for the company.

In February 2002, the company once again became a public company via an initial public offering. Barnes &amp; Noble retained control over the newly public company with 67% of outstanding shares and 95% of voting shares. Barnes &amp; Noble retained control over GameStop until October 2004, when it distributed its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes &amp; Noble, making it an independent company.

===Expansion (2004–2016)===


====Acquisitions====
* In 2005, GameStop acquired EB Games (formerly Electronics Boutique) for $1.44 billion. This expanded GameStop&#x27;s operations into Australia, Canada, Europe and New Zealand. GameStop&#x27;s operations expanded to over 4,250 stores worldwide as a result of the acquisition. 
* In 2007, GameStop acquired Rhino Video Games, who operated 70 video game stores throughout the Southeastern United States, from Blockbuster for an undisclosed amount. 
* In April 2008, GameStop acquired Free Record Shop&#x27;s 49 Norwegian stores. 
* In October 2008, GameStop acquired Micromania, a French video-game retailer, for $700 million. GameStop, which had previously owned no stores in France, now had 332 French video-game stores.
* In November 2009, it acquired a majority stake in Jolt Online Gaming, an Irish browser game studio. Jolt closed in 2012.
* In 2010, GameStop acquired Kongregate, a San Francisco–based website for browser-based games. In 2017, it was sold for $55 million.
* In 2011, GameStop acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse in separate transactions. Spawn Labs was a developer of technology that allowed users to play video games that were run remotely on machines in data centers rather than their personal computer or console. Impulse was a digital distribution and multiplayer video game platform acquired from Stardock, and renamed GameStop PC Downloads. Under the ownership of GameStop, the service was redesigned and sold games that use other platforms such as Steam while also selling games that use its own proprietary DRM solution, Impulse:Reactor. GameStop shut down both PC Downloads and Spawn Labs in 2014.
* In 2012, GameStop acquired BuyMyTronics, a Denver-based online market place for consumer electronics.
* In October 2012, GameStop acquired a 49.9% ownership interest in Simply Mac, a Salt Lake City–based Apple authorized reseller and repairer founded in 2006. GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% of ownership in November 2013. GameStop tried to target areas for potential new Simply Mac locations in smaller markets that did not have an existing Apple Store within a reasonable driving distance. In January 2017, GameStop closed many Simply Mac locations. The chain had as many as 70 locations at the time of the announcement. In 2019, GameStop divested Simply Mac; at that time it had 43 stores.
* In November 2013, GameStop acquired Spring Mobile, a Salt Lake City–based retailer of AT&amp;T-branded wireless services. 
* It acquired 163 RadioShack locations in February 2015. 
* In July 2015, GameStop acquired Geeknet. 
* On August 3, 2016, GameStop acquired 507 AT&amp;T store chains in plans to diversify into new businesses and less dependent on the video game market.

====Brand expansion====

GameStop founded MovieStop in 2004 as a standalone store that focused on new and used movies. More than 42 locations were opened, which typically adjoined or were adjacent to GameStop locations. GameStop spun off MovieStop to private owners in 2012. In November 2014, Draw Another Circle LLC, a company controlled by merchandising executive Joel Weinshanker that also owns Hastings Entertainment, purchased MovieStop. The chain shuttered in 2016.

In October 2012 at Grapevine Mills in Dallas, GameStop introduced GameStop Kids, a pop-up retail concept. The brand, which had 80 locations in shopping malls during the Christmas and holiday season, focused on children&#x27;s products, and carried only games rated &quot;Everyone&quot; by the ESRB, along with merchandise of popular franchises aimed towards the demographic.

In July 2014, GameStop&#x27;s Australian Division EB Games Australia introduced ZiNG Pop Culturea pop culture retailer. ZiNG Pop Culture has since expanded to over 50 standalone stores as well as numerous large format hybrid stores, which include both an EB Games and Zing Pop Culture store in a single location with an expanded selection of games merchandise.

====European expansion and stagnation====
GameStop&#x27;s entry into the European market began in 2003 with the acquisition of Irish video game retailer, Gamesworld. Gamesworld, which had eleven stores in Ireland, then announced that it planned to add 33 stores across the island of Ireland.
GameStop&#x27;s merger with EB Games in October 2005 expanded GameStop&#x27;s European footprint with the addition of nearly 400 stores across Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. The merger did not include EB Game&#x27;s British and Irish stores which continued separately under the GAME brand.

GameStop continued its expansion, operating 636 stores across Europe by 2007, now including Portugal. In April 2008 with the acquisition of Free Record Shop&#x27;s 49 Norwegian stores. This was followed in October with the acquisition of French video-game retailer Micromania and its 332 stores for $700m, which increased its European store count to 1,077.

However, GameStop&#x27;s attempts to expand into the UK were less successful. In 2007, its bid to acquire GameStation and its 217 stores from struggling Blockbuster were thwarted by GAME who acquired it instead in May. In November, when British retailer Woolworths went into administration British gaming magazine, MCV, reported that GameStop was bidding for half of Woolsworth&#x27;s 815 stores. GameStop later issued a press statement completely denying the reports.

Now operating over 1,400 stores across Europe with sales of $1,810 million, 2011 was the limit of GameStop&#x27;s growth in Europe. GameStop gave up on UK expansion, and in July announced that it would be closing its two solitary stores in Britain and launching an e-commerce website for UK customers. In January 2012, GameStop closed its four remaining stores in Northern Ireland, thus ending its physical presence in the United Kingdom, and transferring its UK business online.

Also in January, GameStop left Portugal closing its 13 stores. Later in March, GameStop&#x27;s competitor, GAME, entered administration. While GameStop actively explored acquiring GAME&#x27;s Spanish business and its 291 stores, it was sold instead to investment vehicle, Cherrilux Investments. GameStop&#x27;s Spanish business was originally an acquisition of Jump Ordenadores SLU by EB Games in 2005 just prior to the merger with GameStop. In September 2014, GameStop announced its withdrawal from Spain and the sale of some of its stores to GAME, the very company it had tried to acquire only two years previously.

====Management changes====

Daniel DeMatteo replaced Richard Fontaine as GameStop CEO in August 2008. DeMatteo had served as company COO since 1996. Fontaine, who had been GameStop chairman and CEO since 1996, remained the company&#x27;s chairman. J. Paul Raines, formerly executive vice president of Home Depot, became company COO in September. J. Paul Raines became GameStop CEO in June 2010. He replaced Daniel DeMatteo who was named executive chairman of the company. Under his leadership, in 2012, GameStop&#x27;s digital revenue grew from $190 million in 2011 to more than $600 million in 2012.

===Decline (2016–2024)===
====Changes in market conditions====
The market for physical game media has been in a state of decline due to downloadable games on services such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, Nintendo eShop, and Steam. This has resulted in a decline in sales at GameStop. In 2017, GameStop reported a 16.4% drop in sales for the 2016 holiday season, but expressed optimism in its non-physical gaming businesses.

In February 2017, it was revealed that GameStop enforced, on all of its retail employees, a program known as Circle of Life. The policy itself was made to ensure that each employee would allow a certain percentage of their sales to pre-orders, rewards cards, used games, or have a customer trade in a game. Upon revelation of the policy, many current and former GameStop employees revealed stories of how the policy has led to them lying to customers. Many more claimed that the policy had led to poor working conditions and emotional distress. Later that month, GameStop reformed the program to solely focus on the store as a whole instead of the previous individual employee basis, though still maintaining a heavy emphasis on the individuals&#x27; performance to maintain strong store metrics.

====Financial losses====

Shares of GameStop stock fell 16% in 2016. On February 28, 2017, shares dropped an additional 8% following Microsoft&#x27;s announcement of its Xbox Game Pass service. Following these reports, GameStop announced it would close over 150 stores in 2017 and expand its non-gaming business. On the same day, however, GameStop said it planned to open 65 new Technology Brand stores and 35 Collectibles stores due to a 44% and 28% increase in sales, respectively. GameStop&#x27;s total revenue fell 7.6% to $3.06 billion in the quarter ended February 2, 2018.

&quot;Business Insider&quot; described GameStop&#x27;s investment in Spring Mobile as a failure, with estimates that the company spent $1.5 billion on acquisitions on Spring Mobile and store locations, but only gained $700 million from the sale of Spring Mobile to Prime Communications in 2018, leaving them $800 million in debt.

In late June 2018, GameStop confirmed talks of a possible sale, with Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm, the most likely buyer, with a target deal expected by February 2019. However, on January 29, 2019, GameStop reported it had stopped looking for a buyer for the company, due to a &quot;lack of available financing on terms that would be commercially acceptable to a prospective acquirer&quot;, and was looking for other actions to help re-establish its financial ground. Shares dropped 27% to a 14-year low immediately following this announcement.

The financial results for 2018 showed the biggest loss in GameStop company history. For the 52-week period ending on February 2, 2019, GameStop reported a record-breaking net loss of $673 million. This was a change from the net profit of $34.7 million in the previous year. The net sales for fiscal year 2018 were down 3% year-on-year to $8.29 billion. The company also eliminated its dividend.

In December 2021, GameStop posted a larger-than-expected loss in the fiscal third quarter, and investors are waiting to hear how the ailing company plans to restructure its operations and entice gamers back. In extended trade, shares plummeted.

In March 2024, GameStop announced net income of $6.7 million for fiscal year 2023.

====Management changes====

After being on medical leave since November 2017 due to reoccurrence of a brain tumor, J. Paul Raines resigned from GameStop on January 31, 2018, and died on March 4, 2018. DeMatteo, GameStop&#x27;s executive chairman stepped in as interim chief executive officer. On February 6, 2018, the company announced Michael K. Mauler as CEO and member of the board of directors. On May 11, 2018, Mauler resigned due to &quot;personal reasons&quot; and chairman Dan DeMatteo was named interim CEO. Mauler did not take any severance package or separation benefits. On May 31, 2018, GameStop named Shane Kim as interim CEO. Kim was replaced by George Sherman in March 2019. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that a group of shareholders including Hestia Capital Partners LP and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund LP sent a &quot;threat&quot; letter to the Grapevine, Texas, company&#x27;s board, urging it to appoint a stockholder representative as a director.

====Turnaround efforts====
=====American division efforts=====
All GameStop stores in Puerto Rico were shut at the end of March 2016, citing increased rates of government taxes.

In July 2019, GameStop partnered with an outside design firm, R/GA, to put forth plans to revamp stores to focus on competitive gaming and retrogaming, and to introduce new ways for customers to try games before buying them. Each concept store is expected to be mutually exclusive.
A leaked email revealed on July 31, 2019, indicated that 50 employees, including district and regional managers, would be laid off as a result of reorganization efforts. In August 2019, GameStop laid off over 120 people, including about half of the staff of &quot;Game Informer&quot;, as part of its &quot;GameStop Reboot initiative&quot;.

In August 2019, Michael Burry&#x27;s investment firm Scion Asset Management sent a letter to GameStop executives urging the company to engage in a $238 million stock buyback. The letter also revealed that Scion owned approximately 2,750,000 shares, or about 3.05% of GameStop. The stock price of GameStop, which had been in steady decline in share price since late January 2019, spiked roughly 20% after Burry revealed that he was buying the stock in an interview with &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot;. In the interview, Burry explained that both Sony and Microsoft would enter the next console generation with a physical disc drive and therefore likely extend the longevity of GameStop. He also noted that the company&#x27;s balance sheet was in good condition. In December 2019, GameStop announced that it spent $178.6 million to buy 34.6 million shares, or 34% of the shares outstanding, at an average price of $5.14 per share. In May 2020, Burry lowered his stake in GameStop.

After reporting that it had missed analysts&#x27; expectations during the 2nd quarter of the fiscal year 2019 ending August 2019, as reported in September 2019, GameStop announced that it was planning to close about 180–200 underperforming stores of the 5,700 it had worldwide in the short term, along with developing metrics to evaluate other potential closures over the next two years. In March 2020, four members of GameStop&#x27;s board of directors – Dan DeMatteo, Gerald Szczepanski, Larry Zilavy, and Steve Koonin – stepped down and were replaced by Reggie Fils-Aimé, Bill Simon and J.K. Symancyk as part of the company&#x27;s effort to turn around the business.

On October 8, 2020, GameStop announced an agreement with Microsoft to migrate backend systems to Microsoft 365 platforms including Dynamics 365, also including in-store usage of Microsoft Surface products by employees. It was later reported that this agreement would also include revenue sharing on all digital game purchases for Xbox Series X and S for each product sold by the retailer, although the exact percentage of this share was not disclosed.

=====Australian division efforts=====

GameStop&#x27;s Australian division has been focused on increasing higher-margin merchandise and opening more large format hybrid stores which include both an EB Games and Zing Pop Culture store in a single location. These locations have an expanded selection of merchandise based on both games and pop culture. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported the diversification into merchandise through the establishment of the Zing Pop Culture brand in 2014 had been vital in keeping the company profitable. The newspaper reported the greater focus on merchandise allowed the company to tap into the lucrative, higher-margin merchandise market of t-shirts, figurines and bobbleheads. The newspaper noted former staff agreed that the Australian divisions&#x27; merchandise pivot has been key to the divisions survival in Australia&#x27;s tough retail landscape. However, they also pointed to the pre-owned games segment as a major part of its success. GameStop&#x27;s Australian division has been the only profitable segment of the global GameStop business for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 fiscal years. The company reported profits of US$9.4 million, US$52.2 million and US$30.6 million for each fiscal year respectively.

====COVID-19 pandemic====

=====American division pandemic response=====

Government efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 required GameStop to close the physical operation of all of its 3,500 stores from roughly March to May 2020, though not without some controversy in the early stages. Throughout this time, it continued with online and curbside sales. Sherman and the board of directors took a 50% pay cut while other executives took a 30% cut to offset losses. While digital sales grew by 519%, its retail dropped by more than 30% in the same period from the prior year, and the chain reported a loss in contrast to a for the same quarter in 2019. However, with the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 still planned for release in the latter part of 2020, Sherman expected to be able to recover from these losses.

In mid-March 2020, GameStop faced criticism for its response to the COVID-19 pandemic in North America, with employees and social media users accusing the company of placing its business ahead of the safety of its staff and customers, in order to capitalize on an influx of video game purchases and related products for entertainment during the pandemic and related lockdowns. GameStop stated that it would suspend in-store events (including midnight launches) and the use of demo stations, perform additional cleaning, and structure lines and limit store capacity to enforce physical distancing. To prevent enlarged crowds for two high-profile video game releases on March 20—&quot;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&quot; and &quot;Doom Eternal&quot;, GameStop announced that it would begin selling &quot;Doom Eternal&quot; in its stores a day ahead of its official release date.

&quot;Polygon&quot; reported on March 17 that several stores in the San Francisco area had remained open, seemingly in violation of a stay-at-home order issued by Bay Area counties that restricts non-essential business. Several employees told &quot;Polygon&quot; and &quot;Vice&quot; that they did not receive additional cleaning supplies that were to be provided by corporate, requiring them to purchase them on their own and request reimbursement.

A memo obtained by &quot;Kotaku&quot; on March 19 indicated that GameStop saw itself as an essential business because some of its technology products are relevant to enhancing remote work, required in many cases during the pandemic. GameStop reiterated the safety measures that it had put in place, and also announced that it would reduce store hours and suspend all trade-ins until at least March 29, 2020, and offer curbside pickup. An employee of a GameStop store in Athens, Georgia (which was shut down on March 20 by order of the police to comply with a similar order in Athens-Clark County) disputed the argument, saying that the high-end, gaming-oriented peripherals (such as keyboards and mice) sold at GameStop were not necessarily essential for remote work, and that cheaper alternatives were readily available at stores allowed to remain open, such as Walmart.

California had announced a state-wide stay-at-home order on March 19; while GameStop had originally stated to its stores it was an essential retail business, by March 20 GameStop instead decided to close down its California branches, while keeping most other nationwide stores open. Following similar stay-at-home orders in New York and Illinois over the following days, GameStop announced that it would close all locations effective March 22, with selected locations continuing to offer contact-free curbside pickup (where an employee, wearing either gloves or a bag over their hands, would slip the customer&#x27;s order through the front door, remaining behind the glass) and home delivery. In early April 2020, a location in Dorchester, Boston received a nuisance citation by local police, who deemed the curbside pickup a violation of the Massachusetts stay-at-home order. GameStop subsequently ceased offering curbside pickup in the state.

=====Canadian division pandemic response=====

GameStop&#x27;s Canadian subsidiary EB Games faced similar criticism on March 20 as well, as morning lineups for the new &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot; games at a Toronto location induced large public gatherings discouraged by officials. The city&#x27;s public health chief Eileen de Villa stated that the gathering did not &quot;line up with what we expect from those in our community who are interested in protecting and strengthening our community&quot;. Mayor John Tory accused the company of &quot;placing commerce above the public interest&quot;, while Premier of Ontario Doug Ford stated that &quot;everyone in this province has a responsibility to make sure we protect each other and I am very, very disappointed in the store owner that would do this&quot;. EB Games later announced that it would close all Canadian stores on March 21.

=====Australian division pandemic response=====

GameStop&#x27;s Australian subsidiary EB Games Australia was the only arm of the global GameStop business not to report huge COVID-related losses, with sales instead soaring by 30 per cent. In Australia COVID-19 lockdowns were managed by the Australian Federal Government National Cabinet which largely permitted retail stores to remain open with capacity limits in place. This meant, unlike other arms of the GameStop business, the Australian arms stores remained open for the substantial majority of the pandemic. National Cabinet only mandated some brief regionally targeted entire store closures with stores in the Australian state of Victoria being the most heavily impacted. For fiscal year 2020 the Australian arm reported net sales of US$625.3 million and operating earnings of US$52.2 million. This was an increase of US$42.8 million in operating earnings compared to the pre-pandemic Fiscal Year 2019 where the company posted net sales of US$525.4 million and operating earnings of US$9.4 million.

====European Decline====

In December 2016, GameStop closed its UK website, completely leaving the UK market. In December 2019, GameStop announced that it wind down its Nordic operations during 2020, closing its 100 stores across Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden by July 2020, and exiting those countries.

By the end of 2020, GameStop had 954 stores in Europe and sales had fallen to $789 milion, with losses of $78.7 milion. That November, Ryan Cohen&#x27;s open letter to the GameStop board suggesting closing or selling loss making operations in Europe was an indication of GameStop&#x27;s future plans for Europe.

In October 2022, GameStop decided to withdraw completely from Austria and Switzerland, closing their twenty stores. In Germany, its business would be downsized with only 70 of 170 stores remaining open by March. In December, the Swiss business was saved by the small Italian gaming retailer, Cidiverte which operates ten stores in Italy, who took over and rebranded all the Swiss GameStop stores by May 2023.

In March 2023, GameStop decided to leave Ireland after another loss making year accumulated its losses to €45.5 million. It closed its 35 stores by June costing GameStop €13 million in severance payments and lease buyouts. Its warehouse and European headquarters in Swords, Dublin was later sold for €5 million. By the end of 2023, Gamestop had only 647 stores left in Europe, operating in France, Germany and Italy.

In November 2024, GameStop decided to cease operations in Germany, closing its remaining 69 stores by January 2025, as well as its warehouse and headquarters in Tannheim.

Also in November 2024, GameStop sold GameStop Italy to Cidiverte, a small Italian competitor which operates ten stores under the Gamelife brand. Within six months of the sale, over 250 GameStop stores in Italy will be rebranded as Gamelife stores. Thus by the summer of 2025, aside from Micromania in France, the GameStop brand will have disappeared from Europe.

On February 18th, GameStop announced that it intended to sell its Canadian and French operations. Ryan Cohen condemned &quot;wokeness&quot; of Canada and France and tweeted that the sale would &quot;include wokeness and DEI at no additional cost&quot;.

====January 2021 short squeeze====
In January 2021, trading activity around a short squeeze resulted in a 1,500% increase in GameStop&#x27;s share price over the course of two weeks, reaching an all-time intraday high of over US$500.00. , on the New York Stock Exchange. This effect was mainly attributed to short sellers using illegal business practices causing the stock to be shorted over 100 percent of the free float of the company.

There is uncertainty around the size of the effect of short sellers closing their position. The SEC released a report claiming &quot;While a short squeeze did not appear to be the main driver of events, and a gamma squeeze less likely, the episode highlights the role and potential impact of short selling and short covering.&quot;

==== Other news in 2021 to 2024 ====
In February 2021, GameStop announced that its finance chief Jim Bell, appointed in June 2019, would leave the company on March 26, 2021. Though no official reason was given for Bell&#x27;s departure, the company said that it did not have to do with a disagreement with the company or its operations.

In April 2021, George Sherman announced that he will step down as CEO of GameStop by July 31, 2021. Also in April 2021, Ryan Cohen, founder of Chewy and a large GameStop shareholder, was named chairman, effective in June 2021. On June 9, 2021, GameStop appointed former Amazon executives Matt Furlong and Mike Recupero as CEO and CFO respectively. Furlong took over the position of CEO from Sherman on June 21, 2021. Furlong was removed from his position as CEO in June 2023 and replaced by Ryan Cohen.

In July 2022, it was announced that Mike Recupero was fired as CFO. He was replaced by Diana Saadeh-Jajeh, who was the company&#x27;s chief accounting officer. Just a year later, GameStop announced that Diana had resigned as CFO.

In September 2023, Cohen took over as CEO of the company, in addition to his chairman role, without collecting a salary. In March 2024, it was announced that GameStop would cut an unknown number of staff in an effort to achieve profitability. However, the company also noted that these cuts may strain its existing resources.

==== NFT platform ====
On May 26, 2021, GameStop announced that it was working on a non-fungible token (NFT) platform creating a token that is based on blockchain Ethereum technology. &quot;Business Insider&quot; reported that &quot;GameStop is building an NFT platform as part of an ambitious plan to transform itself into the Amazon of gaming.&quot;

The Beta version of the platform launched on July 11, 2022. The marketplace is curated, with a vetting process in place for artists; in July 2022 GameStop removed an NFT associated with artwork which referenced the photo &quot;The Falling Man&quot; and removed the ability for the creator&#x27;s account to mint new NFTs on its platform. In another case, a user sold hundreds of NFTs associated with HTML5 games they did not have a license for. GameStop removed their minting ability and the listings for the NFTs on their marketplace, although the NFTs themselves remain on the blockchain, the games themselves on Gamestop&#x27;s servers, and can be sold on other marketplaces.

In December 2022, GameStop laid off a large portion of the team working on the NFT platform. In August 2023, GameStop announced wind down of its crypto and NFT wallet citing &quot;regulatory uncertainty&quot;. As of December 2023, Gamestop&#x27;s NFT marketplace still allowed users the ability to trade in-game items using other NFT wallets (such as MetaMask). However, in January 2024, Gamestop ultimately announced that on February 2, 2024, the NFT marketplace would be shuttered completely.

== Business operations ==

=== Atrix ===
Atrix (formerly @play) is GameStop&#x27;s in-house store brand. GameStop sells gaming accessories, Headsets, Mice and Keyboards under the Atrix brand.

===&quot;Game Informer&quot;===
&quot;Game Informer&quot; was a magazine owned by GameStop, Inc. It was discontinued in August 2024. It was primarily sold through subscriptions which could be purchased at GameStop locations. A subscription to the magazine was included for members of GameStop&#x27;s PowerUp Rewards Pro loyalty program.

===Trade-ins===

GameStop provides its customers either cash or trade credit in exchange for customers&#x27; unwanted video games, accessories, and tech. The used video game trade-ins have twice the gross margins of new video game sales. Some video game developers and publishers have criticized GameStop for its practices, as they receive no share of the revenue from the sale of used games. GameStop responded to these criticisms in 2009 by stating that 70% of store credit generated by game trade ins was used to purchase new rather than used games, generating close to $2 billion in annual revenue.

===GameStop TV===
GameStop TV is the in-store television network run internally by GameStop, with non-endemic sales in partnership with Playwire Media. GameStop TV features programming targeted to consumers shopping in GameStop stores. Each month brings content segments about upcoming video game releases, exclusive developer interviews, and product demonstrations.

===Pre-order bonuses===
Game publishers obtain more pre-orders by including exclusive in-game or physical bonuses, available only if the player pre-ordered the game. Bonuses typically include extras such as exclusive characters, weapons, and maps. For example, GameStop included an additional avatar costume for &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot; when it was released in November 2010, and a pictorial Art-Folio for &quot;&quot;. Soundtracks, artbooks, plushies, figurines, posters, and T-shirts have also been special bonuses.

===GameTrust Games===
In January 2016, GameStop announced a partnership with Insomniac Games with its 2016 title &quot;Song of the Deep&quot;. GameStop executive Mark Stanley said the concept was to help the chain have more direct communication with players, and would expect to expand out to other similar distribution deals with other developers if this one succeeds. In April 2016, GameStop created the GameTrust Games publishing division to serve as a publisher for mid-sized developers. In April 2016, GameTrust Games announced it was working with Ready At Dawn, Tequila Works, and Frozenbyte to prepare more titles.

As of January 2025, GameTrust has published two games on Steam in 2016 and 2017 respectively.

==Controversy==
In 2022, consulting firm BCG filed a lawsuit against GameStop as the latter allegedly denied payment of fee worth $30 million for a project. GameStop argued that it saw it is in the best interest of its stakeholders to deny payment as BCG brought little improvement to the EBITDA of the company, which the consultancy allegedly promised to improve. BCG counter argued that the company has delivered more than it promised in statement of proposal and that the quoted variable fee was based on the &quot;projected&quot;, not realised, improvement in EBITDA, as per the contract.

Ultimately, it turned out that BCG&#x27;s lawsuit lacked the merit to be carried out in court. GameStop&#x27;s claim about BCG not having delivered any value and not being owed any money for their supposed &quot;services&quot; was not controversial after all, and the lawsuit regarding these matters was dismissed with prejudice.

Since 2014, Gamestop has regularly donated money to Autism Speaks&#x27; research that could be used for eugenics, despite regular campaigns against this from the Autistic community.

<text>Pope Peter VII of Alexandria (Abba Boutros El-Gawly), 109th Pope of Alexandria &amp; Patriarch of the See of St. Mark. He was born in the village of El-Gawly in Upper Egypt, and known as Mankarius while a monk at the Monastery of Saint Anthony on the Red Sea.

During his papacy, sensing intimations of pressure from Roman Catholicism, the Coptic Church intensified her teaching, her preaching, and her pastoral work, and the Coptic Pope himself intensified his writing on matters of faith and doctrine. During the period, many private and public patriarchal libraries were founded.

When the Russian Tsar sent his delegates with an offer to put the Coptic Church under his protection, Pope Peter declined the proposal by asking, &quot;Does your Emperor live forever?&quot; When the envoy answered that he would die, like all humans, the Pope told him that he preferred the Protector of the Church who would not die.

The papal throne stood vacant for a little over one year before his successor, Cyril IV, was elected.

Also during the papacy, Saint Sidhom Bishay was martyred at the hands of Muslims in Damietta. His martyrdom made possible the raising of the Cross openly during Christian funeral processions, for this practice was previously forbidden.

His feast date is 28 Paremhat.

<doc id="994649" wikidata="Q3503996" url="?curid=994649" title="Don't Make Me Think">
<text>Don&#x27;t Make Me Think is a book by Steve Krug about human–computer interaction and web usability. The book&#x27;s premise is that a good software program or web site should let users accomplish their intended tasks as easily and directly as possible. Krug points out that people are good at satisficing, or taking the first available solution to their problem, so design should take advantage of this. He frequently cites Amazon.com as an example of a well-designed web site that manages to allow high-quality interaction, even though the web site gets bigger and more complex every day.

The book is intended to exemplify brevity and focus. The goal, according to the book&#x27;s introduction, was to make a text that could be read by an executive on a two-hour airplane flight.

Originally published in 2000, the book was revised in 2005, and again 2013 to add a section about mobile UX, and has sold more than 700,000 copies.

In 2010, the author published a sequel, &quot;Rocket Surgery Made Easy&quot;, which explains how anyone working on a web site, mobile app, or desktop software can do their own usability testing to ensure that what they&#x27;re building will be usable.

The book has been referenced in college courses and online courses on usability.

<text>Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend, was appointed Secretary of State for the Northern Department by George I of Great Britain in September 1714. Until 1717, he held the position of Northern Secretary and was the de facto leader of the Whig administration. However, he was later demoted to Lord Lieutenant of Ireland when he was outmanoeuvred by his rival Whigs, who formed the first Stanhope-Sunderland ministry. This led to a split within the Whig party that lasted until 1720.

==The Cabinet==
*Robert Walpole served as both First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1715 and 1717.
*While serving as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1714–1717), Lord Sunderland additionally served as Lord Privy Seal between 1715 and 1716.

<text>Saria Island (), anciently known as Sarus or Saros (), is an island in Greece. It is a rocky, volcanic island just to the north of Karpathos, separated from it by a 100 m (330 ft) wide strait. It is part of the Dodecanese archipelago. In ancient times, a city-state called Saros was situated on the island. It was a member of the Delian League.

Administratively, it is part of the municipal unit of Olympos. The 2011 census reported a population of 45 residents. It has little plant or animal life, and has a number of steep cliffs. Although only shepherds live on Saria now, the ruins of the ancient city of Nisyros can be found here. It is also a breeding area for Eleonora&#x27;s falcons.

Although the name is subject to dispute, scholars link it with the name of an ancient Greek princess named Katherine from a line of Saria royalty. Greek legends say she was as beautiful as Helen of Troy and so they named an island after her. On the island of Saria, it is recorded history that a kingdom existed named Mikri Nisyros.

<text>Points of View is a long-running British television series broadcast on BBC One. It started on 2 October 1961 and features the letters of viewers offering praise, criticism and observations on BBC television programmes of recent weeks.

==History==
&quot;Points of View&quot; began in 1961 with Robert Robinson presenting viewers&#x27; letters to the BBC. It was originally designed as an occasional five-minute &quot;filler&quot; to plug gaps between shows. Kenneth Robinson (1925–1994) took over in 1965, though Robert Robinson returned in 1969 before the show was dropped in 1971. During the 1960s there was also a spin-off, &quot;Junior Points of View&quot;.

The show returned on 31 August 1979 after a hiatus of eight years, with the dry humour of Barry Took at the helm. Originally only being broadcast in the London area as a five-minute filler whilst other parts of England were broadcasting regional programming, by February 1980 it was broadcast across the whole of the UK and moved to more familiar slot before the Nine O&#x27;clock news. Took left in 1986 and was replaced by guest presenters including Tony Robinson, Alan Titchmarsh and Chris Serle, until Anne Robinson took over as presenter in 1987. For many years during this period, the programme held a slot of 20:50 on Wednesday evenings. In 1997 Anne Robinson left the series to concentrate on &quot;Watchdog&quot;. Following another period with guest presenters, Carol Vorderman became the next regular presenter in April 1998 but was later replaced by Des Lynam in February 1999.

By October 1999, &quot;Points of View&quot; had moved to a Sunday early evening slot, being presented by Terry Wogan and now included emails in addition to letters and telephone calls. In the 2007 series, &quot;Points of View&quot; featured diverse films, such as students from Sussex University making a passionate plea for the BBC to keep the soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;, John Leivers interviewing Roly Keating (the controller of BBC Two) on the channel&#x27;s direction, and Jill Parkinson asking why there aren&#x27;t more people with disabilities featured in BBC programmes.

In April 2008, Jeremy Vine became the regular presenter of the series. From April 2013, production switched to BBC Northern Ireland. On the last show of the present series on 1 July 2018, Vine announced his retirement from the show. In order to refresh the series, which returned in the autumn, and allow more time for audience feedback the show no longer was presenter-led, instead being narrated by Tina Daheley; however the show returned to the presenter format, whilst retaining Daheley, in 2022. The 2021 series was narrated by Nicki Chapman, a stand-in for Daheley who was absent due to pregnancy.

==Public perception==
The show has been seen as representing a certain passive-aggressive aspect of British culture; Victoria Wood once said &quot;When the Russians feel strongly about an issue they form a bloody revolution – the British write a strongly worded letter to &quot;Points of View&quot;&quot;. Although, much less common now, the show has over the decades featured many a letter beginning &quot;Why, oh why, oh why...&quot; and signed &quot;Upset of Uxbridge&quot; or &quot;Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells&quot;, or something similar (these days, most, if not all, simply use their real names). Along the way the show has catered for those who wish to see particular parts of programmes again, featuring letters asking &quot;Please, please, please could you show the clip where Vera Lynn sang to the troops on the 50th anniversary of D-Day last week&quot;, and the like.

The series has been criticised for featuring too much praise of the BBC and its programmes, and playing down criticism. This tendency has been sent up by many comedians over the years, including memorable skits in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; and &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. In the latter, positive letters said such things as &quot;I think the (television licence) fee is far too low. I would willingly sell my house and all its contents to help the BBC.&quot;

Further criticism came from comedians Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie in their sketch comedy show &quot;A Bit of Fry and Laurie&quot;. In a sketch where Fry had supposedly removed Laurie&#x27;s brain, Laurie said that he was &quot;off to write a letter to &quot;Points of View&quot;&quot;. In a later episode, a woman claims she has had two letters read out on &quot;Points of View&quot;, and that &quot;they say if you get three, you&#x27;re automatically sectioned under the Mental Health Act.&quot; The programme became (around 1994) the first BBC TV show to invite contributions by email, and at one point, its producer Bernard Newnham - who produced more than five years worth of shows, four of which were with Anne Robinson - had the only Internet connection in BBC Television Centre.

=== Timeline ===
==&quot;Junior Points of View&quot;==
Between 1963 and 1970, Robert Robinson (later replaced by Sarah Ward, and Gaynor Morgan Rees) presented a version designed for children&#x27;s letters entitled &quot;Junior Points of View&quot;.

==Theme==
The original theme tune to the programme was the first 13 seconds of Kid Ory&#x27;s trad jazz piece &quot;Yaaka Hula Hickey Dula&quot;, played by the Dutch Swing College Band. When the series returned in 1979 a new piece called &quot;Northern soul&quot; was used before switching in 1982 to adopting the Beatles&#x27; &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot; as its theme tune (because of the lyric &quot;Send me a postcard, drop me a line, stating point of view&quot;). This was dropped at the end of 1990.

In 2000, a bespoke acapella theme tune, entitled &quot;Blah Blah&quot; or &quot;Blah Boopity Baya&quot; was introduced, alongside a new title sequence in 2003, featuring members of the public talking to a screen showing BBC programmes and channels, set against a black background with streaks of light flying past. The composers and performers involved in the creation of this theme tune are unknown. In 2009, the theme gained notoriety when it was featured on BBC Radio 6 Music&#x27;s Adam and Joe radio show, with the presenters mocking the theme tune&#x27;s upbeat sound compared to the overall serious tone of &quot;Points of View&quot; at the time (then presented by Jeremy Vine; though the show became more light-hearted across Vine&#x27;s overall run as presenter), adding that &quot;the BBC&#x27;s been in some quite serious trouble of late, so this is just a suggestion to our colleagues at the castle BBC Television Centre]... you might want to change that music&quot;.

In 2011, an alternative mix of the previous theme came into use, with the acapella vocals being swapped for a synthesizer and background strings.

<doc id="994664" wikidata="Q4970846" url="?curid=994664" title="British Rail Class 73">
<text>The British Rail Class 73 is a British electro-diesel locomotive. This type is unusual in that it can operate on the Southern Region&#x27;s 650 / 750 V DC third rail power supply, or an onboard diesel engine to allow it to be used on non-electrified routes. This makes it very versatile, although the diesel engine produces less power than is available from the third-rail power supply, so the locomotives are rarely used outside of the former Southern Region of British Rail. It is one of the first bi-mode locomotives ever built. Following the withdrawal and scrapping of the more powerful Class 74 bi-mode locomotives in 1977, the Class 73 was unique on the British railway network until the introduction of the Class 88 bi-mode locomotives in 2017. Ten locomotives have been scrapped.

== History ==
The Southern Railway&#x27;s expanding third rail electric passenger network (which had begun as far back as 1915) was until 1941 a purely passenger electric multiple unit (EMU) system. This was because it was necessary to have gaps in the third rail for level crossings, etc., which effectively prevented the use of electric locomotives on either passenger or freight. It was not until the arrival of Oliver Bulleid as Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Southern Railway, in 1937, that the problem was finally addressed when he teamed up with Alfred Raworth, the Chief Electrical Engineer, to solve the issue. To overcome the problem of gaps in the third rail three experimental locomotives were built (which later became the British Rail Class 70) which were fitted with large flywheels that maintained momentum long enough to avoid stalling in gaps. The second problem for freight train operation by electric locomotives was the serious hazard that would result if the 750 V DC third rail was laid in goods yards, as this would be a danger to personnel on the ground and also present some complex issues loading and unloading many types of freight wagons. The initial solution was to install simple tramway-type overhead wires to carry the 750 V supply in certain yards and add a pantograph on the locomotive roofs.

As a continuation of the Southern Railway&#x27;s policy of electrification, British Railways then began electrifying the main lines to the Kent Coast as part of the 1955 Modernisation Plan. In addition to the few hundred new EMUs required, a small fleet of 25 Bo-Bo electric locomotives of classed type &quot;HA&quot; (later Class 71) were built to deal with freight, parcels, and the few remaining locomotive-hauled passenger trains in Kent, such as the &quot;Night Ferry&quot; and &quot;Golden Arrow&quot; services. These locomotives also had a flywheel and pantograph, and were able to work in the more important freight yards across Kent that were fitted with the simple 750 V overhead wire system. This system was brought into use across Kent between 1959 and 1961.

Although successful this system did require considerable extra cost, and maintenance, and still limited freight operations with the new locomotives to those goods yards fitted with the catenary. Something more versatile was needed. Development and advances in both electric locomotive and diesel engine design in the early 1960s resulted in the Southern Region engineers beginning to consider the possibility of a combined electric and diesel locomotive. The requirement was for an electric locomotive with a similar power when using the electrified third rail to the already successful Type 3 Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon (BRCW) built diesel locomotives (later Class 33) then entering service on the Southern. This would be supported by adding a small diesel engine powerful enough to move reasonable freight loads at slow speed within goods yards. The new locomotive design would also need retractable third rail pick up shoes. This was for two reasons: the first was safety in connection with track relaying jobs, avoiding the problem of bridging a gap and energising a dead section of third rail, and electrocuting track workers who might be in contact with the dead third rail section. The second was to allow locomotives under diesel power to move off and back onto third rail areas without risk of damaging &quot;fixed&quot; third rail pick up shoes.

The Southern Region engineers, having done all the initial design work, set about building a prototype batch of six new &quot;electro-diesel&quot; locomotives at Eastleigh Carriage and Wagon Works during 1961–1962. The new locomotives had a respectable on electric power, and an English Electric diesel engine similar to those used in the Southern Region&#x27;s diesel electric multiple Unit (DEMU) fleet. To improve versatility yet further, the locomotives were designed so that they could work in multiple with most of the Southern&#x27;s electric and diesel multiple unit fleets as well as normal carriages and wagons. This meant the locomotives had to also be fitted with drop buckeye couplings and therefore the Pullman rubbing bar, and retractable buffers. The success of these prototype locomotives resulted in British Railways ordering a production batch of a further 43 locomotives from English Electric at the Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows. However minor technical differences prevented the prototypes (classified type &quot;JA&quot;) working in multiple with the production examples (classified type &quot;JB&quot;). In all other respects, the new &quot;electro-diesels&quot; proved extremely versatile, to the point where many are still in service after a life of over years.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On 26 April 1968, locomotive E6023 was derailed at , Berkshire when a set of points were moved by mistake.
* On 8 January 1972, locomotive E6027 collided with 4-BEP no 7004 at Horsham, injuring 15.
* On 12 October 1972, locomotive E6001 was hauling a freight train that ran into the rear of a passenger train at , London due to inattentiveness on the part of the driver. Twelve people were injured.
* On 16 January 1982, 73 115 was hauling a departmental train which overran signals and ran into the rear of a parcels train at . The severely damaged locomotive was withdrawn and subsequently scrapped. Locomotive 73 006 was hauling the parcels train that was run into.

== Description ==

This class of 49 locomotives were built in two batches using English Electric components. The first six locomotives were built by BR at Eastleigh Carriage and Wagon Works and introduced to service during 1962; they were built to the Hastings Line gauge, numbered E6001-E6006 and classified as type JA. With the introduction of TOPS in 1968 they were to have been classified as Class 72, to differentiate from the later built units. However, instead they became Class 73/0. In the early 1970s the locomotives were renumbered 73001-73006.

Following successful trials of the initial locomotives, a production run of 43 locomotives were ordered as part of the Bournemouth Electrification and built by English Electric at their Vulcan Foundry between 1965 and 1967. They were initially classified as Class JB and numbered E6007-E6049. They differed slightly from the six earlier machines, most notably having an increased tractive effort as well as a higher maximum speed (90 mph as opposed to 80). Following the introduction of TOPS, they became Class 73/1 and were renumbered 73101-73142. One locomotive, E6027, had already been withdrawn following accident damage and so was not renumbered. Further changes were the use of large round Oleo buffers with a pneumatic withdrawal mechanism rather than the traditional coach style (oval) saddle buffer which relied on a pin and spring mechanism. As the JA examples came in for overhaul over the years, the saddle buffers were also replaced making visual identification of the differing machines almost impossible from a distance.

From new, all members of the class were fitted with the Pullman style rubbing plate between the buffers allowing them to close couple with Southern Region electro-pneumatically controlled electric multiple units and diesel electric multiple units for push-pull train operation – the reason for retractable buffers.

Being built to the Hastings Line gauge, the locomotives were able to be used on all routes of BR&#x27;s Southern Region network.

== Technical details ==

The design parameter of the Class 73 was to provide a secondary main line electric locomotive to the then Southern Regions &quot;mixed traffic&quot; requirements, with the added ability to deliver, shunt and collect freight to and from yards adjoining the electrified network under diesel power. The shunting requirement meant these locomotives had dual controls on both sides of the cab.

The limitations of a 1,600 hp electric locomotive meant that it was only capable of hauling maximum ten-coach trains to the proposed post-steam era Southern Region express timings, as were the similarly powered Type 3 BRCW Class 33 diesel locos with 1,550 hp. Southern express electric multiple units had, by comparison, at least 1,000 hp per four-car unit. To assume that the Class 73 was suitable to haul passenger or freight trains away from the electrified network with just a 600 hp diesel engine would be unrealistic. In fact the use of the slightly more powerful Class 74 electro-diesels, with 650 hp on diesel, to haul parcels trains up Poole Bank and work freight trains around the West London Line to Acton, Brent and Willesden, resulted in repeated failures; this was, therefore, a major contributory factor to that class&#x27;s early demise.

There were eight third rail collector shoes on the Class 73 – four per bogie with two each side. These shoes were of the retractable type – a necessity for both safety and operational reasons, as described above. They could cope with all the then (1965) voltages of 660V and 750V as well as the 800V of the Bournemouth electrification beyond Pirbright Junction south of Woking (from autumn 1966). 660V was phased out in line with pre-BR type electric multiple unit (EMU) withdrawals, the last EMUs incapable of working in passenger service on anything greater than 660V being the 4SUB Bulleid design. Thus all BR post-1951 EMU designs could cope with 750V or 800V.

Gaps in the third rail at complex pointwork or level crossings mean that a short electric locomotive such as Class 73 is liable to momentarily lose power when passing over. This results in noticeable arcing if the driver does not shut off power. However, this rarely affects the locomotives, except to burn out the carbon brush pick-up shoes more quickly. The issue of arcing only became a problem when some of these locomotives were altered to work &quot;Gatwick Express&quot; services using modified Mark 2 coaching stock and 500 hp Gatwick Luggage Vans (GLVs), as 750V power jumpers between locos or units were banned on BR designs (the last EMUs to have such jumpers were the Bulleid designed 4SUBs). The Class 73s therefore could not benefit from the pick-up shoes at the opposite end of the train on the GLV. As a result of removing the last bank of resistance on the Class 73 locos to make these trains accelerate more quickly, arcing increased. Therefore, to reduce damage to other electrical equipment from the increased arcing, these particular locomotives had &quot;flash guards&quot; fitted on their bogies around the shoes. Stories of Class 73s catching fire were greatly exaggerated.

The Class 73 locomotives were very versatile, with dual cab controls; three brake systems (vacuum, air and EPB) as detailed below; a well-designed cab with good sighting that aided shunting; the ability to work fitted freight (fully braked) and unfitted freight (no train brakes) as well as locomotive-hauled coaching stock; the ability to work in multiple with blue star coded diesel locomotives; and the ability to operate in multiple with the Southern&#x27;s diesel electric multiple unit fleet (Class 73/0) or its electric multiple unit fleet (Class 73/1). 

=== Power supply ===

Unlike the previous Southern Region Class 70 and Class 71 electric locomotives, these did not have a booster to maintain traction power over gaps in the conductor rail. However, they could move forward onto an electrified section under diesel power.
=== Diesel engine and generator ===

The English Electric 4SRKT Mk II diesel engine was less powerful, but more reliable than the Paxman 6YJXL fitted to the later
Class 74 electro-diesel locomotives.

=== Traction control ===

The Class 73 was fitted with two separate power controllers on the driver&#x27;s desk (and replicated on the secondman&#x27;s side); one for electric or auxiliary power (under diesel power) and the other only for diesel power. The auxiliary power arrangement was to accommodate diesel operation when being driven from mainline EMU stock.

=== Multiple working ===
Multiple working is when two or more locomotives are coupled together and controlled by a driver in the leading driving position. This was achieved with the aid of the standard SR 27-wire jumper connection system, a design that ensured excellent compatibility. They could work with other 33/1, 71, 74, locomotives (in fact any type 2,3 or 4 blue-star coded mainline locomotive) and EP multiple unit stock.

In order for the Class 73s to achieve their maximum versatility, the locomotives also had to have multiple brake systems. When built in the 1960s, this required vacuum brakes for use with freight, most locomotive-hauled carriages, and many other locomotives, including steam; also air brakes for use with the newest BR-designed wagons, and newer types of passenger carriages and locomotives; and, for use with the Southern&#x27;s electric and diesel multiple unit fleets, the Electro Pneumatic Brake (EPB).

Class 73/9 variants have been fitted with the AAR system, allowing for multiple working with Classes 59, 66 &amp; 67.

=== Couplings ===

The Class 73s also have two couplings; a rigid semi-automatic type known as the &quot;buckeye&quot;, needed for coupling to most types of coaching stock, and the then-BR(SR) types of Multiple unit. The knuckle of this coupling could be lowered on a hinge (by removing a locating pin in its shank) to reveal the classic British hook. Over the hook could be coupled a &quot;3 Link&quot; chain coupling, or an &quot;Instanter&quot; chain type, or a &quot;Screwlink&quot; chain type. However, the rigid &quot;Buckeye&quot; type coupling, because it maintains a fixed distance between vehicles, presents a dangerous problem when buffers are present. The standard British buffer is needed to cope with the variable distance of chain-type couplings, to reduce buffeting and snatching behaviour. But with the shorter rigid Buckeye in use, the buffers cannot compact enough in curves and would derail one or both vehicles. So, buffers on Buckeye fitted vehicles have to be of the &quot;Retractable&quot; type. They are extended when chain type coupling is in use, but retracted out of the way so they cannot touch when the Buckeye is in use. This then presents another problem: how will buffing and snatching be dealt with when the Buckeye is in use? The solution is to move the buffing control to the centre of the vehicle, where the change in angles between vehicle corners is greatly reduced in curves; hence the &quot;Pullman Rubbing Bar&quot; seen between the buffers on Class 73 locos, and Class 33/1 diesels. This flat-looking plate is mounted on two hydraulic rams to act like a buffer. Its shape is actually the floor section of a Pullman Gangway connection as seen on Buckeye fitted coaches (such as Mk1 types) or Multiple units. The Pullman gangway connection, being itself semi-rigid, has a similar two hydraulic rams hidden behind its floor section to do the job of buffing, so it happily matches the Pullman Rubbing Plate in size and shape on the Class 73.

The Class 73/1s were noted being delivered from English Electric&#x27;s plant at Newton-le-Willows working in Multiple with new Class 20 1,000 hp diesels as these were being built at the same plant concurrently, so only one driver was needed to move both locos under (diesel) power. In normal use the Class 73/1s were often seen working with Bournemouth line electric TC (non-powered) sets, which allowed such trains to be driven in Push-Pull mode.
Although technically possible, the Class 73/1s were not allowed to work in multiple or tandem with the Bournemouth line 4REP EMUs as this would exceed the &quot;Current Limit Index&quot; (CLI). The CLI is a rating system for all electrically powered stock, and to exceed the maximum permitted can result in sub stations and other electrical equipment being damaged.

== Operations ==
=== British Rail ===

During 1984, a small subfleet of Class 73s were dedicated to work the upgraded Gatwick Express service, which would feature a Class 73 at the southern end, a rake of air-conditioned Mk2f coaches which had been modified to carry Southern Region multiple unit control jumpers, and a Class 489 &quot;GLV&quot; (themselves converted from former Class 414 driving Motor coaches) at the north end. Both the Class 73 and the GLV provided power, and the trains ran non-stop between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport.

=== Post-privatisation operations ===
Since privatisation, the Class 73 fleet has been reduced in size following the large-scale withdrawals of the EWS and Gatwick Express fleets. However, many smaller operators have acquired locomotives, so their continued use is assured for the foreseeable future.

==== Eurostar ====

Eurostar owned and formerly operated two Class 73 locomotives, which were specially modified to enable them to haul a Eurostar unit. The two locomotives; 73118 and 73130, have additional coupling equipment fitted and were primarily used to rescue failed Eurostar sets, or to haul them over non-electrified routes. They were rarely used away from North Pole depot. When Eurostar moved its operations to the new Temple Mills depot and onto the overhead wiring of High Speed 1 in 2007, the Class 73 locomotives became redundant and were loaned to educational initiatives: 73130 went to RailSchool in East London and 73118 went to Barry Rail Centre in South Wales. Subsequently, when RailSchool failed, 73130 was loaned to the Bluebell Railway but is stored away from the railway. As of 5 November 2022 73130 is now in the hands of the 73130 Ltd based at the Llanelli and Mynydd Mawr Railway in Carmarthenshire.

==== FM Rail ====
FM Rail (previously Fragonset Railways) bought several redundant locomotives from EWS. Most of these were initially stored at various locations around the country, including preservation sites, such as the Mid-Hants Railway, the Peak Railway and the Dartmoor Railway. Some of these locomotives were repaired for use on these heritage railways, such as number 73134 on the Dartmoor Railway.

One locomotive, number 73107 &quot;Spitfire&quot; returned to mainline traffic in 2004 following overhaul. It was repainted in Fragonset&#x27;s black freight livery, and was expected to be used on empty coaching stock moves associated with charter trains. It was regularly hired to First GBRf from late 2004 as cover for their fleet and was based at c2c&#x27;s East Ham Depot along with the Blue Pullman Rake. In 2007 it was acquired by RT Rail and has been overhauled and repainted in a GBRf-esque livery at St. Leonards Depot.

==== Gatwick Express / Southern ====

Until mid-2005, Gatwick Express operated several Class 73s with Class 488 coaching stock and Class 489 GLVs. These have now been withdrawn and replaced by EMUs. However, 73202 was retained as a &quot;Thunderbird&quot; engine to rescue failed EMUs. Along with the rest of the Gatwick Express franchise, it later passed to Southern. The locomotive, formerly &quot;Dave Berry&quot;, was renamed &quot;Graham Stenning&quot; after the company&#x27;s Apprentice Manager, at Brighton Lovers Walk Depot on 11 December 2015.

==== GB Railfreight ====
GB Railfreight is the newest operator of Class 73 locomotives, having bought six redundant Gatwick Express locomotives, numbers 73203-207 and 73209. Four of these (73204-206 and 209) have now been returned to traffic after overhaul by Fragonset at Derby. They have been repainted in the company&#x27;s blue and orange livery and named after female employees. The locomotives are primarily used on engineering trains originating from Eastleigh and Tonbridge. The former company First GBRf purchased 73208 and repainted it into BR Blue. In early 2009 73207 was repainted in Large Logo Blue and used for shunting duties in Whitemoor Yard. First GBRf also acquired 73141, 73212 and 73213, with all three painted in the new First Group livery; however, 73212 lacks the FirstGroup logo. 73141 was named &#x27;Charlotte&#x27; in July 2009, which was known for being named twice in February 2009. Now operated by the Eurotunnel Group, the trains are now being de-branded from the First Group branding. 73119 was purchased from Knights Rail Services in September 2011 and returned to service in June 2012. In 2013, Class 73s 73109 and 73136 were brought by GB Railfreight. They have since been repainted along with First GBRf liveried 73141, 212 and 73213 at St. Leonards Depot into GB Railfreight livery.

Commencing in 2013, five GB Railfreight Class 73s were re-engined as Class 73/9 by Brush Traction Wabtec at their factory in Loughborough. The first three converted locomotives, renumbered 73961-3 from 73209, 73204 and 73206 respectively, were fitted with MTU 1,600 hp V8 engines. All existing mechanical and electrical components were removed prior to the re-fit, and the frontal appearance of the locomotives has been altered by the provision of light clusters and the installation of a more central location for the jumper cables. The dual driving positions have been retained although with a new design for the driver&#x27;s controls. The refurbished locomotives will be capable of working with existing Class 73/1 and 73/2 units in either diesel or electric mode. The first completed locomotive, 73962 (ex-73204), was unveiled on 3 August 2014 at Brush Traction Loughborough.

GB Railfreight use re-engined Class 73/9 locomotives to haul the Caledonian Sleeper. They are used for the non-electrified sections of the route, running from Edinburgh to Aberdeen, Inverness and Fort William.

==== Merseyrail Electrics ====
Merseyrail Electrics had a fleet of four Class 73/0 locomotives (numbers 73001/2/5/6), based at Birkenhead North TMD, for use on shunting and other departmental duties. Two, numbers 73001 and 73006, were repainted into Merseyrail&#x27;s yellow livery; they were later fitted with sandite discharging equipment and reclassified as Class 73/9. All four locomotives were withdrawn from traffic by 2002, and all were later sold for preservation.

73004 was also owned by Merseyrail during this period. It was used as a source of spare parts and was the first to be cut up.
==== Network Rail ====

Network Rail inherited two redundant Gatwick Express locomotives, numbers 73212 and 73213, from its predecessor Railtrack. These were overhauled and painted in Railtrack&#x27;s company&#x27;s blue and green livery. They were used on engineering trains associated with an upgrade of electrical supply systems on the former Southern Region.

A third locomotive, number 73141, was originally bought for spare parts, but was returned to traffic in case of failure of one of the other two locomotives. The locomotives were later repainted into Network Rail all-over-yellow with red buffer beams.

In 2009, 73141 was acquired by First GBRf, with 73212 and 73213 following shortly afterward.

Two locomotives, numbers 73211 and 73104, were completely rebuilt by Rail Vehicle Engineering Limited (RVEL) of Derby. The 600 hp diesel engine was removed and replaced by a pair of Cummins QSK19 750 hp diesel engines, increasing the total diesel horsepower to 1,500. The locomotives are used by Network Rail and are classified 73/9. The Cummins QSK19 is the same engine used in the Class 220 and Class 221 diesel multiple units. 73101 has been sold from preservation and will be added to the overhaul program. The first prototype of Network Rail&#x27;s new &#x27;Ultra73&#x27; locomotives was unveiled on Friday 13 June 2014 at RVEL in Derby.

Both of Network Rail&#x27;s Class 73/9s were put up for sale in August 2023 as surplus to requirements.

==== RT Rail ====
RT Rail acquired loco number 73107 from FM Rail in 2007, and had it overhauled and repainted at St. Leonards Depot.

==== South Western Railway ====
South West Trains inherited one locomotive, number 73109, which is used as a &quot;Thunderbird&quot; rescue locomotive. It was named in 1990 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. It is affectionately known as &quot;BoB&quot; by rail enthusiasts.

South West Trains later expanded its fleet, by leasing two more locomotives from Porterbrook, numbers. 73201 and 73235. Both are former Gatwick Express locomotives. The first of these, number 73235, was overhauled in early 2005 and repainted in the new Desiro blue livery. It was joined by number 73201 later in the same year. Around the same time, number 73109 was also repainted into the new blue livery. 73109 was acquired by Transmart Trains in 2009.

73235 is being used for shunting at Bournemouth Depot since the transition to the new franchise holder South Western Railway.

==== Transmart Trains (formerly The Class 73 Locomotive Preservation Company) ====
The Class 73 Locomotive Preservation Company (C73LPC) formed in 2004 to manage locomotive 73136 at Stewarts Lane Depot, London.
73136, the last 73 operated by EWS was renamed &quot;Perseverance&quot;, is now fully fitted with TPWS and OTMR equipment following the implementation of OTMR during the summer of 2006. The locomotive is registered for use on the national rail network and is available for either short term &#x27;spot&#x27; hire or medium-term contracts. The locomotive was hired to the Bluebell Railway during 2009 to assist with its Northern Extension to East Grinstead. In August 2006, the company was contracted by GBRf to repaint GBRf&#x27;s 73208 into BR Blue for future use on charter work with 73136. The company has also restored 73210 at Stewarts Lane Depot, this locomotive is privately owned. The locomotive moved to its new home on the Mid Norfolk Railway in September 2008.

The Class 73 Locomotive Preservation Company changed ownership in 2009 and was renamed Transmart Trains in 2010. Following the takeover, the company expanded its operations and managed five Class 73 locomotives. These were 73109, 73118, 73133, 73136 and 73211. Number 73211 had been stripped for spares and is unlikely to return to service in its original form. 73133 has since been sold to a partner group of Transmart, and left Selhurst by road for a new life at Barry Island. Subsequently, the locomotive was transited by rail to South West Trains Bournemouth Depot on long term hire.

In 2013, Class 73s 73109 and 73136 were sold on for further use with GB Railfreight. They have since been repainted along with First GBRf liveried 73141, 73212 and 73213 at St. Leonards Depot into GB Railfreight livery.

== Preservation ==
Several locomotives have been preserved on heritage railways, where perforce they run on their diesel engines: no preserved line has third rail electrification.

== Model Railways ==
Lima launched its first version of the BR Class 73 in OO gauge in the early 2000s. Since 2006 Hornby have produced a representation of the prototype using the Lima tooling as part of their range in BR Green, whilst past examples have carried a variety of liveries.

By 2007, Dapol had a broad range of Class 73 models for British N gauge, with examples in GB Railfreight and Gatwick Express liveries added at that time.

<doc id="994669" wikidata="Q1931256" url="?curid=994669" title="Ernest Hébrard">
<text>Ernest Hébrard (1875–1933) was a French architect, archaeologist and urban planner, best known for his urban plan for the center of Thessaloniki, Greece, after the great fire of 1917.

== Background ==
Hebrard studied at the École des Beaux-Arts, and in 1904 won the Grand Prix de Rome, allowing him to study at the Académie de France in Rome, located in the Villa Medici. It was here that he chose to study Diocletian&#x27;s palace at Split, eventually leading to the 1912 publication of a monograph containing what is still regarded as the most accurate image of the original appearance of the Palace. At the Academie, he was a few years behind Henri Prost, later famed as the planner of Casablanca, and together with other members of the reformist Musée social, he developed an interest in the possibilities of town planning.

==Work in Greece==
During WW1, in 1916, Hebrard had been conscripted as the Director of the Archaeological Service of the Army of the Orient based in Thessaloniki, and so was present when the majority of the city was largely destroyed in the Great Fire of 1917. The Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos forbade the reconstruction of the city center until a modern city plan was approved. He commissioned Ernest Hébrard for the work, which the architect conceived and developed with the aid of the Greek architects Aristotelis Zachos and Konstantinos Kitsikis, as well as British designer Thomas Hayton Mawson and fellow Frenchman Joseph Pleyber. The plan did away with the medieval and Ottoman street layout, imposing instead a plan of formal boulevards, in a symmetrical pattern about a central axis, carefully composed around the most important ancient Byzantine churches and mosques. Hébrard taught at the National Technical University of Athens, and his work is well known in the architecture schools of Greece.

==Work in Indochina==
In 1921, he was appointed the head of the Indochina Architecture and Town Planning Service, based in Hanoi, the capital of French Indochina, at first charged with planning the hill station of Da Lat in Annam, Vietnam&#x27;s middle province. He participated in the planning new districts or urban improvements of several other cities in the region, including Hanoi itself. He also designed a number of prominent buildings, including the eclectically styled Martyr&#x27;s Church, popularly known as the Cửa Bắc Church, in central Hanoi in the late 1920s (completed c1931), but he is particularly noted for a series of government buildings that worked to incorporate elements of vernacular design from French Indochina into modern structures. They include :

* Hanoi University of Pharmacy, originally the Hanoi Medical University, built 1926.
* Ministry of Foreign Affairs, originally built as the Indochina Ministry of Finance, 1924–28.
*National Museum of Vietnamese History, originally the French School of the Far East, built 1926–31, and intended to house the archeological collections of the school.
*Lê Hồng Phong High School, originally Lycee Petrus Ký, District 5, Ho Chi Minh City, 1925–28.
*Hotel Le Royal, Phnom Penh, Cambodia, proposed 1924, opened 1929 (with Jean Desbois).

In 1930, he presented a project for the building of a university in Salonika, and in 1931 he returned to Paris, where he died at the age of 58 two years later.

<text>The Iranian Students&#x27; News Agency () (ISNA, Persian: ) established in December 1999, is a news agency run by Iranian university students.

==Position==
Based in Tehran and founded in 1999 by Abolfazl Fateh-an ex-aide to former Iranian presidential candidate and opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi-ISNA is often quoted by the major international news agencies and has been widely regarded as &quot;a politically moderate news source&quot; in Iran. &quot;Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) was born in an era of major paradigmatic transformations in Iran&#x27;s press and public discourse, which took place largely under the presidency of reformist Mohammad Khatami (1997-2005)&quot;.

ISNA covers a variety of national and international topics. Editors and correspondents are themselves students in a variety of subjects, many of them are volunteers (nearly 1000). Abolfazl Fateh,the agency&#x27;s main founder and first managing director (1999-2005) stated that &quot;in the relatively short period after its conception, the agency succeeded in reflecting political, cultural, scientific and social issues in an acceptable manner and succeeded in probing the darker corners of current political issues&quot;. ISNA was considered by Western media to be one of the most independent and moderate media organizations in Iran, and is often quoted. It was able to &quot;intervene in the social discourse in Iran: foregrounding a social issue, thematizing a discourse and problematizing social issues in order to open up a new kind of discourse&quot;.

Although it is generally considered independent, the ISNA is financially supported in part by the Iranian government and is supported by ACECR (Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research), another student organization. The agency&#x27;s main founder and first director Abolfazl Fateh, who resigned in late 2005, was taken to the court on several occasions, including for a report on Shirin Ebadi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and human rights activist. Also, once he was beaten by police while supporting his correspondents to report student demonstration in June 2003. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, reformist daily &quot;Aftab-e Yazd&quot; 14 June 2003, in its Editorial column wrote: &quot;It is not easy to overlook the injury caused to Dr Abolfazl Fateh, the hardworking managing director of the Iranian Students&#x27; News Agency, who had come to the scene to ensure an accurate reporting of events and prevent any news distortion by foreign media... [His] greatest concern was that if the people do not receive the news from us, they would do so from our enemies or at best from our competitors.&quot;.

==History==

Iranian Students&#x27; News Agency was established in December 1999 in order to report on news from Iranian universities.

During its first five years, the agency (ISNA) performed an influential role in the country socio-political sphere and &quot;embodied the view of a news agency as having a role not only in the coverage of events, but also as an active agent of social change through discursive interventions&quot;. It was able to &quot;intervene in the social discourse in Iran: foregrounding a social issue, thematizing a discourse and problematizing social issues in order to open up a new kind of discourse&quot;.

During the period of 1999 to 2005, &quot;While taking a reformist view of events, ISNA managed to remain politically independent. It, however, maintained its loyalty to the former president and carried a section devoted to &quot;Khatami&#x27;s perspectives&quot;. It was considered &quot;the official voice of Iranian students&quot;, However, after Khatami&#x27;s era, due to changes in the political environment (Ahmadinejad era) and leaving of its first managing director, ISNA has been seen as losing its reformist streak.

In January 2005 a server called The Planet unilaterally stopped hosting the website of the ISNA. ISNA said that they did not receive a reason for the closure, and had only been informed 48 hours before the move. An Iranian government official later accused the United States of ordering the shutdown. The incident led to new calls for Iran to develop its own satellite communication technology.

After Abolfazl Fateh&#x27;s resignation in September 2005, Mehdi Nad&#x27;alizadeh, ISNA&#x27;s head of political news was appointed as ISNA&#x27;s director. He was replaced by Hamid Hasan-Zadeh in 2007.

==Analysis==

Abolfazl Fateh in his PhD thesis, defended in 2011 at University of Oxford entitled &quot;the Power of News Production&quot; stated about ISNA (Iranian Student News Agency),&quot;During this period [1999-2005], ISNA turned into a major source of news, information and content in the Iranian media, attracting the attention of journalists, media experts and academics. Although the reasons for this strong attention may vary among these groups – from ISNA&#x27;s political impact to its peculiarities as a news agency – perhaps the common denominator among all of them was that ISNA presented a novelty on the Iranian (and to some degree, global) media scene. In a society that seemingly had experience of major changes initiated by unofficial media, as had happened during the Islamic Revolution (Sreberny-Mohammadi 1990), or by few periodicals and a newspaper with a small circulation together with student activists, as had happened during the reform movement (Khāniki 1998), this news source had and demonstrated the potential to bring about a considerable change in Iran&#x27;s media content and its functions. ISNA may not be framed as a news agency or fit a specific model; however, it was a symbol of the media that &quot;reflect and direct at the same time&quot; (Deuze 2009, p. 457).

Meanwhile, the Thesis confirms &quot;ISNA suffered from certain shortcomings having to do with how it operates – for example, not operating twenty four hours a day; not presenting news according to established professional standards; not having a multilingual website; having educational, editorial and technological weaknesses; focusing on domestic activities and news, and not having vast regional or international branches; and, most importantly, financial dependence on the government. Moreover, despite its honesty, fairness, and accuracy, the agency could not demonstrate itself as an impartial news agency particularly in later years of the period when it pumped out reform idealism and combined news activities with cyber activism. Therefore... ISNA perhaps cannot be characterized as a member of the media with the highest journalistic values and professional standards. However, under the circumstances that prevailed at the time, it would be safe to say that it provided the best possible and strategic way to set up a relatively reliable but constant information flow in the country during this period&quot;.

As indicated in the thesis, &quot;Regardless of any fate that the agency [ISNA] faces in the future..., it is clearly evident that ISNA, in the context of the Iranian media sphere and in comparison with other news sources in the country [during the period in between 1999 and 2005], rose as a new media phenomenon. This unique student news agency created a range of innovatory and influential journalistic work. All of these characteristics emerged while ISNA was affiliated with a revolutionary organization like ACECR. This affiliation raises the question as to whether ISNA represents a mutation in the revolutionary organizations in the country&quot;.

The thesis statement added, &quot;ISNA was a new idea that turned into a reality and added another dimension to the news agency&#x27;s mission in the country. The study reminds us of the importance and significance of news agencies in a region where they are not considered important or powerful players. As such, it introduces a workable model that can be potentially replicated in the region&quot;.

As Fateh&#x27;s thesis explained, &quot;ISNA represents a unique type of journalism and a unique form of media organization that combined distinctive elements of local and global characteristics in its inception and operation. It is difficult to frame ISNA as a news agency or claim that the agency &quot;fits a model&quot;. At one level ISNA can probably be seen as a hybrid of participatory and traditional journalism and at another level as a hybrid organization that bridged the gap between competent journalism and cyber activism or cyber politics. In a serious way, ISNA defined its own model of a news agency, while at the same time acting as a social maverick and providing a mould for civic participation. These unique characteristics explain the success and impact of ISNA on the media scene in Iran, providing the key to its early development and survival. As such, in a rather direct way, ISNA embodied the socio-politics of Iran, with its deep heterogeneity and perhaps contradictions. It symbolizes a period of Iranian contemporary history in its rich complexity&quot;.

<doc id="994682" wikidata="Q4865688" url="?curid=994682" title="Barton Springs Pool">
<text>Barton Springs Pool is a recreational outdoor swimming pool in Austin, Texas, that is filled entirely by natural springs connected to the Edwards Aquifer. Located in Zilker Park, the pool exists within the channel of Barton Creek and uses water from Main Barton Spring, the fourth-largest spring in Texas. The pool is a popular venue for year-round swimming, as its temperature hovers between about and year-round.
 The pool&#x27;s grassy hills are lined with mature shade trees. 

== History ==
Long before Barton Springs Pool was built, the springs were considered sacred and were used for purification rituals by the Tonkawa Native American tribe who inhabited the area. Spanish explorers discovered the springs in the 17th century, and around 1730 erected temporary missions at the site (later moving to San Antonio).

In 1837, before the incorporation of the city of Austin, the area was settled by William (&quot;Uncle Billy&quot;) Barton, who named three springs after his daughters: Parthenia, Eliza, and Zenobia. He and subsequent owners of the property recognized its value as a tourist attraction, and promoted it vigorously, thus leading to the swimming hole&#x27;s lasting popularity.

The last private owner of the property, Andrew Jackson Zilker, deeded it to Austin in 1918. During the 1920s, the city undertook a construction project to create a larger swimming area by damming the springs and building sidewalks. The bathhouse was designed in 1947 by Dan Driscoll, who also designed the bathhouse at Deep Eddy Pool.

== Operation of the pool ==

The pool is open to the public every day except Thursday from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. 

From mid-March through October, an entry fee ($2 to $5 for Austin residents, $4 to $9 for non-residents) is required from 8 a.m. until 9 p.m. Summer passes, valid from Memorial Day to Labor Day, are also available. Admission to the pool is free from November through mid-March. Lifeguards are on duty beginning at 8 a.m., and other hours are &quot;swim at your own risk&quot;. 

Prohibited items include 

* Alcohol
* Food
* Pets
* Coolers, ice chests, or thermal bags
* Glass
* Frisbees, footballs, soccer balls or other hard balls
* Portable speakers
* Tobacco – smoking of any kind is not allowed

Anyone seen smoking or with an open container of alcohol will be asked to leave or denied entry. 

Flotation devices are permitted at either end of the pool, but not in the middle section.

When open for swimming, the floodgates on the pool&#x27;s dam are closed, and Main Barton Spring fills the pool to a maximum depth of about 18 feet. At the upper end of the pool, another dam prevents surface water from Barton Creek from entering the pool by diverting it through a tunnel under the sidewalks.

On Thursdays, the pool is closed for cleaning from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m. The floodgates are sometimes partially opened, lowering the water level in the pool by several feet. Employees then buff or blast pressured water against the limestone bottom of the pool&#x27;s shallow end, as well as the steps and ramps leading into the water, in order to wash away the hazardous and slippery algae buildup. In the deep end, a fire hose is used to push debris toward the downstream dam. Overgrown vegetation is also trimmed on cleaning days. The pool is closed for several weeks once a year for more extensive cleaning.

The pool is closed during flash flood warnings as Barton Creek may flood and overflow the diversion dam. Swimming in Barton Springs Pool is then unsafe, as it transforms into a raging creek. The pool is then closed for several days after a flood, so mud and debris that washed into the pool can be removed. Other unplanned reasons for pool closure include lightning or thunder in the area, &quot;search and rescue&quot; situations, serious medical emergencies, high fecal coliform count, and chemical spills (either inside the pool itself or over the Barton Springs segment of the Edwards Aquifer).

== Environmental issues ==
The pool has been closed to the public a number of times since the 1980s due to unsafe levels of fecal coliform (E. coli) bacteria in its waters. The source of contamination is still undetermined: many point to upstream urban development as the cause, although others note that high bacteria levels were seen in the 1950s, when development was less pervasive. Contamination is usually worse after heavy rains due to the flushing of the effluent of upstream subdivisions into the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone which feeds the springs.

The environmental conditions of the springs gave birth to a local political movement called the Save Our Springs Alliance (SOS). SOS became a force in Austin municipal politics, leading to many &quot;green&quot; initiatives involving environmental issues in addition to those of the springs.

Robert Redford, who first learned to swim at Barton Springs Pool, has also been an outspoken ally. In 2007 he and Terrence Malick co-produced The Unforeseen, a documentary highlighting environmental impact to the Edwards aquifer from the surrounding real estate subdivision.

Another environmental issue involving the springs and the pool emerged with the discovery of the Barton Springs salamander, a federally listed endangered or threatened species which only exists in the pool and a few surrounding environs. After some debate, and studies by the city of Austin, Texas state agencies, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, it was determined that swimmers and salamanders could co-exist (as they had probably been doing for some time).

The pool was also closed in 2003 after a cover story in a local paper claimed that the waters were toxic. After closing the pool for 90 days, officials from the CDC, USEPA, State of Texas and the City of Austin deemed it safe for swimmers. The source of the chemicals entering the pool were from a pavement sealer used on a nearby local parking lot. This discovery led to the nation&#x27;s first ban of coal tar pavement sealers in 2005.

<text>The mass media in Iran is both privately and publicly owned but all channels are subject to censorship. In 2016, Iran had 178 newspapers, 83 magazines, 15,000 information sites and two million blogs. A special court has authority to monitor the print media and may suspend publication, or revoke the licenses, of papers or journals that a jury finds guilty of publishing anti-religious or slanderous material or information detrimental to the national interest. The Iranian media is prohibited from criticizing Islamic doctrine (as interpreted by the Iranian government).

==Newspapers==
Most Iranian newspapers are published in Persian, but newspapers in English and other languages also exist. The most widely circulated periodicals are based in Tehran. Popular daily and weekly newspapers include &quot;Iran&quot;, &quot;Ettelaat&quot;, &quot;Kayhan&quot;, &quot;Hamshahri&quot; and &quot;Resalat&quot;. &quot;Iran Daily&quot; and &quot;Tehran Times&quot; are both English language papers. Iran’s largest media corporation is Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). The &quot;Financial Tribune&quot; is the main (online) English language economic journal. Iran Front Page (IFP News) is an English News website which provides its audiences with the English version of the latest news and views from Iran published by the Iranian Persian-language media.

==Foreign broadcasts==
A number of foreign broadcasts are transmitted into the country, including Persian language programmes from BBC Persian TV, Kol Israel and Radio Farda; however, these broadcasts are occasionally countered by radio jamming. The government engages in censorship programs with respect to anything that diverges from national laws and regulations. The majority of Iranians - upwards of 80 percent - get their news from government-owned media. Attempts to establish private, independent media outlets in Iran have been restricted or quashed, and Reporters Without Borders has declared Iran to have the highest number of jailed journalists in the Middle East. Under the 1979 Iranian Constitution, all broadcasting must exclusively be government-operated and, in 1994, the Islamic Republic banned the use of satellite television. In spite of which, over 30 percent of Iranians do in fact watch satellite television channels.

Iranian media include Iranian news agencies, Iranian newspapers, Iranian blogs, Persian-language magazines and Persian-language television stations (not all of which are actually Iranian).

<text>The Sunday Format, &quot;BBC Radio 4&#x27;s first high-quality weekend broadsheet newspaper&quot;, is a British satirical radio comedy. The programme is a parody of British middle class newspapers, in particular the lifestyle supplements and glossy celebrity magazines that fill Sunday papers. The programme consists of a series of short sketches that dramatise the articles in the eponymous newspaper, with the cast assuming accents to convey the characters of the journalists or columnists. The articles are presented in the format of a British Sunday newspaper, with the copy distributed in columns across the body of the paper, and commonly feature lists of items or instructions. Sketches are broken up, and often use backing music which also stops and starts along with the reading of the column as the notional reader&#x27;s eye wanders across the page when an article loses their interest. This leads to a surreal, Dadaist juxtaposition of sketches, with jokes being set up at the beginning of the episode and the punchline being delivered at a random point before the end. Articles typically hover just above fractional interest also include exotically unrelatable, earnestly spun-out mundanities and wordplay to effectively mock the prolix poorly edited writing style of such publications.

== Conception ==

The show was first heard in 1996 in a one-off pilot episode. It did not return until a four-part series aired in Feb/Mar 1999, followed by six episodes in Nov/Dec 2000, and three additional four-part series in Sep/Oct 2001, Jan 2003 and Jan/Feb 2004. The show has won a Sony Radio Award and a British Comedy Award.

The show was devised by John Morton and was produced by Paul Schlesinger and Helen Williams. The writing team is Simon Blackwell, Nick Revell, Dave Cohen, Ewan Bailey, Emma Kennedy, Bill Dare, Laurence Howarth, Andrew Marlatt and Tony Roche. The cast is Ewan Bailey, Rebecca Front, Simon Greenall, Emma Kennedy, Chris Langham, Tracy-Ann Oberman, and Alice Arnold. Alexander Armstrong, Ben Miller, Martin Hyder and Siriol Jenkins also appeared in the earlier series.

<doc id="994704" wikidata="Q1851867" url="?curid=994704" title="Mental model">
<text>A mental model is an internal representation of external reality: that is, a way of representing reality within one&#x27;s mind. Such models are hypothesized to play a major role in cognition, reasoning and decision-making. The term for this concept was coined in 1943 by Kenneth Craik, who suggested that the mind constructs &quot;small-scale models&quot; of reality that it uses to anticipate events. Mental models can help shape behaviour, including approaches to solving problems and performing tasks.

In psychology, the term &quot;mental models&quot; is sometimes used to refer to mental representations or mental simulation generally. The concepts of schema and conceptual models are cognitively adjacent. Elsewhere, it is used to refer to the &quot;mental model&quot; theory of reasoning developed by Philip Johnson-Laird and Ruth M. J. Byrne.

==History==
The term &quot;mental model&quot; is believed to have originated with Kenneth Craik in his 1943 book &quot;The Nature of Explanation&quot;. Georges-Henri Luquet in &quot;Le dessin enfantin&quot; (Children&#x27;s drawings), published in 1927 by Alcan, Paris, argued that children construct internal models, a view that influenced, among others, child psychologist Jean Piaget.

Jay Wright Forrester defined general mental models thus:
The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system (Forrester, 1971).

Philip Johnson-Laird published &quot;Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference and Consciousness&quot; in 1983. In the same year, Dedre Gentner and Albert Stevens edited a collection of chapters in a book also titled &quot;Mental Models&quot;. The first line of their book explains the idea further: &quot;One function of this chapter is to belabor the obvious; people&#x27;s views of the world, of themselves, of their own capabilities, and of the tasks that they are asked to perform, or topics they are asked to learn, depend heavily on the conceptualizations that they bring to the task.&quot; (see the book: &quot;Mental Models&quot;).

Since then, there has been much discussion and use of the idea in human-computer interaction and usability by researchers including Donald Norman and Steve Krug (in his book &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Think&quot;). Walter Kintsch and Teun A. van Dijk, using the term &quot;situation model&quot; (in their book &quot;Strategies of Discourse Comprehension&quot;, 1983), showed the relevance of mental models for the production and comprehension of discourse.

Charlie Munger popularized the use of multi-disciplinary mental models for making business and investment decisions.

==Mental models and reasoning==
One view of human reasoning is that it depends on mental models. In this view, mental models can be constructed from perception, imagination, or the comprehension of discourse (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Such mental models are similar to architects&#x27; models or to physicists&#x27; diagrams in that their structure is analogous to the structure of the situation that they represent, unlike, say, the structure of logical forms used in formal rule theories of reasoning. In this respect, they are a little like pictures in the picture theory of language described by philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein in 1922. Philip Johnson-Laird and Ruth M.J. Byrne developed their mental model theory of reasoning which makes the assumption that reasoning depends, not on logical form, but on mental models (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991).

===Principles of mental models===
Mental models are based on a small set of fundamental assumptions (axioms), which distinguish them from other proposed representations in the psychology of reasoning (Byrne and Johnson-Laird, 2009). Each mental model represents a possibility. A mental model represents one possibility, capturing what is common to all the different ways in which the possibility may occur (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 2002). Mental models are iconic, i.e., each part of a model corresponds to each part of what it represents (Johnson-Laird, 2006). Mental models are based on a principle of truth: they typically represent only those situations that are possible, and each model of a possibility represents only what is true in that possibility according to the proposition. However, mental models can represent what is false, temporarily assumed to be true, for example, in the case of counterfactual conditionals and counterfactual thinking (Byrne, 2005).

===Reasoning with mental models===
People infer that a conclusion is valid if it holds in all the possibilities. Procedures for reasoning with mental models rely on counter-examples to refute invalid inferences; they establish validity by ensuring that a conclusion holds over all the models of the premises. Reasoners focus on a subset of the possible models of multiple-model problems, often just a single model. The ease with which reasoners can make deductions is affected by many factors, including age and working memory (Barrouillet, et al., 2000). They reject a conclusion if they find a counterexample, i.e., a possibility in which the premises hold, but the conclusion does not (Schroyens, et al. 2003; Verschueren, et al., 2005).

===Criticisms===
Scientific debate continues about whether human reasoning is based on mental models, versus formal rules of inference (e.g., O&#x27;Brien, 2009), domain-specific rules of inference (e.g., Cheng &amp; Holyoak, 2008; Cosmides, 2005), or probabilities (e.g., Oaksford and Chater, 2007). Many empirical comparisons of the different theories have been carried out (e.g., Oberauer, 2006).

==Mental models of dynamics systems: mental models in system dynamics==

===Characteristics===
A mental model is generally:
* founded on unquantifiable, impugnable, obscure, or incomplete facts;
* flexible – considerably variable in positive as well as in negative sense;
* an information filter that causes selective perception, perception of only selected parts of information;
* very limited, compared with the complexities of the world, and even when a scientific model is extensive and in accordance with a certain reality in the derivation of logical consequences of it, it must take into account such restrictions as working memory; i.e., rules on the maximum number of elements that people are able to remember, gestaltisms or failure of the principles of logic, etc.;
* dependent on sources of information, which one cannot find anywhere else, are available at any time and can be used.

Mental models are a fundamental way to understand organizational learning. Mental models, in popular science parlance, have been described as &quot;deeply held images of thinking and acting&quot;. Mental models are so basic to understanding the world that people are hardly conscious of them.

===Expression of mental models of dynamic systems===
S.N. Groesser and M. Schaffernicht (2012) describe three basic methods which are typically used:
* Causal loop diagrams – displaying tendency and a direction of information connections and the resulting causality and feedback loops
* System structure diagrams – another way to express the structure of a qualitative dynamic system
* Stock and flow diagrams - a way to quantify the structure of a dynamic system
These methods allow showing a mental model of a dynamic system, as an explicit, written model about a certain system based on internal beliefs. Analyzing these graphical representations has been an increasing area of research across many social science fields. Additionally software tools that attempt to capture and analyze the structural and functional properties of individual mental models such as Mental Modeler, &quot;a participatory modeling tool based in fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping&quot;, have recently been developed and used to collect/compare/combine mental model representations collected from individuals for use in social science research, collaborative decision-making, and natural resource planning.

===Mental model in relation to system dynamics and systemic thinking===
In the simplification of reality, creating a model can find a sense of reality, seeking to overcome systemic thinking and system dynamics.

These two disciplines can help to construct a better coordination with the reality of mental models and simulate it accurately. They increase the probability that the consequences of how to decide and act in accordance with how to plan.

* System dynamics – extending mental models through the creation of explicit models, which are clear, easily communicated and can be compared with each other.
* Systemic thinking – seeking the means to improve the mental models and thereby improve the quality of dynamic decisions that are based on mental models.

Experimental studies carried out in weightlessness and on Earth using neuroimaging
 showed that humans are endowed with a mental model of the effects of gravity on object motion.

===Single and double-loop learning===
After analyzing the basic characteristics, it is necessary to bring the process of changing the mental models, or the process of learning. Learning is a back-loop , and feedback loops can be illustrated as: single-loop learning or double-loop learning.

====Single-loop learning====
Mental models affect the way that people work with information, and also how they determine the final decision. The decision itself changes, but the mental models remain the same. It is the predominant method of learning, because it is very convenient.

====Double-loop learning====

Double-loop learning (&quot;see diagram below&quot;) is used when it is necessary to change the mental model on which a decision depends. Unlike single loops, this model includes a shift in understanding, from simple and static to broader and more dynamic, such as taking into account the changes in the surroundings and the need for expression changes in mental models.

<text>Jon Heidenreich (born June 28, 1969) is an American retired professional wrestler, better known simply as Heidenreich. He is best known for his tenure with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on its SmackDown brand where he was a one time WWE Tag Team Champion with Road Warrior Animal as a part of the 2005 version of the Legion of Doom.

==American football career==
Prior to professional wrestling, Heidenreich played American football and was invited to training camp prior to the 1992 season by the defending Super Bowl XXVI Champion Washington Redskins (Washington Commanders) as an undrafted rookie offensive tackle out of Northeast Louisiana University, which later became University of Louisiana at Monroe in 1999. Heidenreich was among the first round of roster cuts by head coach Joe Gibbs on July 27, 1992.

One week before training camp began in July 1993, Heidenreich signed with the New Orleans Saints and outspoken head coach Jim E. Mora. Mora had liked what he saw in Heidenreich during a late-June tryout to fill a training camp roster spot while standout offensive lineman Jim Dombrowski held out until signing a five-year contract worth $11.25 million on August 13, one week before training camp ended. On the first day of camp, Heidenreich (wearing jersey #65) was involved in a fight with teammate and Saints defensive lineman Rick Dolly in the morning session. In the afternoon session, Heidenreich was involved in another skirmish when he grabbed Saints outside linebacker and 1990 first-round draft pick Renaldo Turnbull from behind and threw him to the ground after Turnbull had just beaten him on a move to the outside. Heidenreich was cut on August 24, 1993, the final day of roster cuts to meet the mandatory 60-player requirement.

In July 1994, Heidenreich was invited to training camp by first-year Atlanta Falcons head coach June Jones. This time Heidenreich wore jersey #74 and was often tasked with blocking fellow WWE wrestler Bill Goldberg, who played defensive tackle for the Falcons from 1992 to 1994. Heidenreich was again denied a final roster spot when the Falcons cut him on the final day of roster cuts on August 23, 1994.

He played as an offensive lineman for two seasons (1994 and 1995) in the Canadian Football League for the Shreveport Pirates before playing for the Texas Terror of the Arena Football League (AFL) in 1996 and the Frankfurt Galaxy of NFL Europa in 1997.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (2001–2003)===
Heidenreich began training at California-based Ultimate Pro Wrestling before he was first signed to a World Wrestling Federation developmental contract in 2001 after he impressed Bruce Prichard. He lost to Perry Saturn in a dark match on December 18 2001 for Sunday Night Heat. Worked in WWF&#x27;s developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling. After being released from the WWF, he wrestled in Japan&#x27;s Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX promotion, where he won the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship with Nathan Jones and impressed WWE scouts, who re-signed him in 2003.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2003–2006)===
==== Early years (2003–2004) ====
Heidenreich made his return to the now-renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on the September 29, 2003, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, making his formal debut with a gimmick being &quot;controlled&quot; by an entity known as &quot;Little Johnny&quot;. After weeks of trying to secure a tryout match, he was finally granted one on the October 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, teaming with The Hurricane to defeat La Resistance. On the November 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he teamed with Trish Stratus to defeat Victoria and Stevie Richards. Over the next month, Heidenreich remained undefeated, before his streak was snapped by Rico on the December 14 edition of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; before Armageddon. On the February 8, 2004, episode of &quot;Heat&quot;, Heidenreich was defeated by Rob Van Dam. After wrestling a few more times, Heidenreich disappeared from WWE television around May 2004.

In an interview with ThePainClinic.net in 2007, Heidenreich revealed that &quot;Little Johnny&quot; was actually meant to be a small doll that represented his inner child who was still angry at being born in a charity hospital. He stated that he used the character in OVW and brought the doll out to the ring with him in the same vein as Al Snow used to bring out the styrofoam head. According to Heidenreich, the angle was supposedly inspired by his own childhood where he spoke to a doll himself at one point.

In 2008, former WWE writer Dan Madigan revealed that in 2004 he had pitched directly to Vince McMahon an idea to have Heidenreich return as a Nazi stormtrooper named Baron Von Bava, who had been cryogenically frozen before being revived by Paul Heyman (a Jewish son of a Holocaust survivor), complete with Heidenreich wearing the red armband with the swastika and even goose-stepping to the ring. While WWE would eventually have Heyman manage Heidenreich, the pitch was considered so shocking that McMahon left the board room speechless and did not return for the rest of the day. The pitch led to Madigan leaving WWE later that year.

==== Feud with The Undertaker (2004–2005) ====

He returned on the August 26, 2004, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as a heel under the management of Paul Heyman. His new gimmick was as a psychopath: running in during random matches, attacking fans, and reciting hateful poetry, which he referred to as &quot;Disasterpieces.&quot; On the September 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he attacked commentator Michael Cole and dragged him backstage and forcibly read poetry to him. In a 2008 interview, Heidenreich explained that the Cole scare angle was McMahon&#x27;s idea, and that &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; came to mind when Stephanie McMahon approached him with the idea.

His first feud came against The Undertaker, and began after Heidenreich ran in during The Undertaker&#x27;s WWE Championship match against John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) at No Mercy. The Undertaker beat Heidenreich at the next month&#x27;s Survivor Series, but again Heidenreich cost him a WWE Championship match at December&#x27;s Armageddon when he interfered in the main event fatal four-way match not once, but twice. At &quot;WWE Tribute to the Troops&quot; on December 23, Heidenreich lost to The Undertaker via countout. On the January 6, 2005, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Heidenreich and Heyman lost to The Undertaker in a 2-on-1 handicap match, after Heyman was pinned. After the match, Heyman was placed in a casket by The Undertaker, writing him off television.

At Royal Rumble on January 30, he faced The Undertaker in a casket match. Midway through the match, Snitsky from the Raw brand interfered on Heidenreich&#x27;s behalf. However, after opening the casket, it was revealed that Kane was hidden in the casket, who pounced on both Snitsky and Heidenreich; they continued their fight in the crowd, while Heidenreich lost the match. This started a chain reaction of feuds, originally planned to lead to a match at WrestleMania 21 in which The Undertaker would partner with Kane to take on Snitsky and Heidenreich. This idea was later nixed; The Undertaker instead fought Randy Orton and Kane was placed into the Money in the Bank ladder match. The feud between the four instead culminated at a live event on February 6, with The Undertaker and Kane getting the win.

====Teaming with Animal and departure (2005–2006)====

At No Way Out, Heidenreich lost to Booker T by disqualification after hitting Booker T with a steel chair. On the March 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Heidenreich faced Booker T in a rematch, which ended in a disqualification win for Heidenreich after Booker T performed a DDT on a chair. Heidenreich and Booker T faced once again on the March 10 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in a no disqualification match, which ended with Booker T decisively defeating Heidenreich. On the March 17 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Heidenreich read Booker T a poem, thanking him for encouraging him to show the &quot;real&quot; Heidenreich, turning face in the process. Heidenreich participated in a 30-man battle royal at WrestleMania 21, which was won by Booker T.

His &quot;disasterpieces&quot; became more light-hearted and began receiving cheers from the crowd. Heidenreich was then given a segment on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in which he &quot;made friends&quot; with audience members, read them a piece of his poetry, and had them stand in his corner during his match. He also had a brief feud with Orlando Jordan, unsuccessfully challenging him for the United States Championship at Judgment Day.

Heidenreich went on to feud with MNM (Melina, Johnny Nitro, and Joey Mercury) after they attacked him while he was eating chocolate with divas on the June 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. After being attacked week in and week out by the trio, he was finally helped out by Road Warrior Animal on the July 14 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Animal and Heidenreich then challenged MNM to a match at the Great American Bash, where they defeated them to win the WWE Tag Team Championship.

On the July 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Heidenreich reluctantly shaved his hair into a mohawk at Animal&#x27;s request. After Animal convinced him he wasn&#x27;t looking for a &quot;replacement&quot; for Road Warrior Hawk, but simply a partner with talent, Animal talked him into wearing face paint and, on the August 18 &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he was made an &quot;official&quot; member of the Legion of Doom and presented with a pair of Road Warrior spikes. On the October 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, the Road Warriors lost the WWE Tag Team Championship back to MNM in a match also involving The Mexicools and William Regal and Paul Burchill. Heidenreich wrestled his final match, teaming up with Animal to defeat Nunzio and Vito, on the December 30 edition of &quot;Velocity&quot;.

On January 17, 2006, WWE announced that Heidenreich had been released from his contract.

===World Wrestling Council (2006–2007)===

After his run in the WWE, Heidenreich moved on to World Wrestling Council, where he defeated Abbad on October 28, 2006, to win the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship, the top title in the Puerto Rico based promotion. Two months later he lost the title to Carlito at the Lockout event. However, he was given the title back when Carlito was stripped of the title due to Carlito&#x27;s contractual compromises with World Wrestling Entertainment. He lost the title a second time to Eddie Colón, Carlito&#x27;s brother, on January 6, 2007.

===Independent circuit (2007–2009, 2016–2018)===
After leaving the WWE, Heidenreich made his debut in All-American Wrestling, a Louisiana-based promotion on May 19, 2007, where he defeated J.T. Lamotta. On May 18, 2008, he teamed with Rodney Mack to defeat Latinos Locos for the promotion&#x27;s Tag Team Championship. However, the title was vacated soon afterwards due to interference in the original title match. On December 14, Heidenreich won the promotion&#x27;s Heavyweight Championship in a three way Loser Leaves AAW match involving then-champion The Angel of Sinn and Haniel, in which he pinned Angel to win the title. He retired from professional wrestling soon after.

Heidenreich wrestled several matches in 2016, including for New York-based promotion Warriors of Wrestling on June 11, 2016, against Juba. The match ended in a double disqualification. He faced off against a Doink the Clown impersonator at an event in a Golden Corral parking lot in May 2016, with the bizarre encounter gaining the attention of WrestleCrap.

On November 12, 2017, Heidenreich won the 302 Wrestling Heavyweight Championship; however the title was immediately retired after his win.

==Other media==
Heidenreich participated in the wrestling film, &quot;Bloodstained Memoirs&quot;. He also appears as a playable character in &quot;WWE Day of Reckoning 2&quot; and &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006&quot;.

==Personal life==
Heidenreich and his wife, Marissa, have one son together.

In 2005, his home was damaged by Hurricane Katrina. In 2017, he had a cyst removed from his forehead.

In July 2016, Heidenreich was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018.

<text>The Garden of Mirrors is an album by Stephan Micus recorded between 1995–1996 and released on ECM the following year.

== Background ==
Like his previous efforts, Micus plays every instrument via overdubbing: he also provides all of the voices for the 20-man chorus in three of the tracks.

Micus&#x27;s inspiration for this album was two traditional low-range West African harps that he studied in Gambia: the &quot;bolombatto&quot; and the &quot;sinding&quot;. When playing these two instruments, Micus claims to have identified with early African American music, which they influenced, claiming that the bassline in jazz was influenced by these harps. Other instruments used by Micus include steel drums and four different flutes: the Japanese &quot;shakuhachi&quot;, the Balinese &quot;suling&quot;, the Irish tin whistle, and the Egyptian &quot;ney&quot;.

<text>Matthew Thomas Gray Elliott (born 28 September 1971) is an Australian former cricketer, who played as a left-handed opening batsman.

==Beginnings with Victoria==

After he made his debut for Victoria in the 1992–93 season, he soon established himself as one of the top opening batsmen in Australian domestic cricket, before progressing his way through to the Bendigo and District Cricket Association playing for the Bendigo Cricket Club in his role as an opening batsman.

==Test career==
Elliott was called up to the Australian national team in the 1996–97 season, making his Test debut against the West Indies in November 1996. Unfortunately for Elliott, in just his second Test match he was injured in a mid-pitch collision with teammate Mark Waugh, resulting in the need for knee surgery.

Elliott returned for the 1996–97 tour of South Africa. He retained his place for the 1997 tour of England, scoring two centuries in the Ashes series, including a career-best 199. He also made his One Day International debut in 1997 in the Texaco Trophy, but scored 1, making it his only appearance in a limited overs international. Elliott was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1998, although this wasn&#x27;t enough for him to hold down a regular spot in the Australian side, and due to inconsistent performances after the Ashes series he slipped out of the national team in 1999. Steve Waugh, in his autobiography, described Elliott as &quot;technically gifted but temperamentally flawed&quot; and &quot;prone to serious bouts of self-doubt and a tendency to let injuries rule his thought processes.&quot; Waugh stated that &quot;[Elliott] would have been a perfect candidate...[for] a sports psychologist.&quot;

Elliott continued to perform at domestic level for Victoria and on the English county scene, and in the 2003–04 season scored a remarkable 1381 runs in the Pura Cup, overtaking Graham Yallop&#x27;s previous record (which was succeeded the very next year in 2004–05 by Michael Bevan). Rewarded with the Pura Cup Player of the Year award and a new Cricket Australia contract, he was recalled to the national team for the first time in five years. However, he played in just one unsuccessful Test against Sri Lanka, where he batted at number 3 in place of Ricky Ponting (who was absent because of a family bereavement); batting outside his normal position, Elliott scored just 0 and 1.

This performance dented hopes of a resurgence in his international career greatly. In addition to this, he also had a below-par season in the subsequent 2004–05 domestic season for Victoria, averaging in the mid-30s.{{cn}

==Move to South Australia==
{{unreferencedsect|date=August 2024}}

In April 2005, Elliott made a request to leave the Victorian team to join South Australia as player-coach; this was originally rejected by Cricket Victoria although Elliott appealed their decision. On 5 May, a Cricket Australia grievance tribunal overturned Cricket Victoria&#x27;s decision, freeing the way for Elliott to move.

In the 2005–06 season, Elliott struggled with injury and inconsistent form. The 2006–07 season was equally disappointing, with just 193 runs at 13.8 from seven first class games. As a result, he was axed from the South Australian state side. Curiously his form in the domestic one-day competition was much better with 465 runs at 51.6, highlighted by two centuries.

==English county cricket==
On the English county scene, Elliott made a century at Lord&#x27;s in the 2002 C&amp;G Trophy final to win the title for Yorkshire - their first one-day trophy for 15 years. He signed a short-term contract for the 2007 season with Yorkshire as cover for Yorkshire&#x27;s primary overseas player Younis Khan, who was due to be participating in the 2007 Cricket World Cup. However, following Pakistan&#x27;s untimely exit, Younis was able to take up his role at his new county from the start of the season, thus Elliott was left surplus to requirements. Following the cancellation, Elliott agreed to join Glamorgan on a four-week deal as cover for Australian left-handed batsmen Jimmy Maher.

==Retirement==
Elliott announced his retirement from first-class cricket in February 2008. He then played for the Chandigarh Lions in the Indian Cricket League.

==Personal life==
Elliott&#x27;s son, Will Elliott, is an Australian rules footballer who currently plays for the Northern Bullants in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He played for {{VFL Box}} in 2023, before joining the Bullants for the 2024 VFL season after being overlooked at the 2023 AFL draft. Elliott&#x27;s other son, Sam is a first class cricketer.

<doc id="994713" wikidata="Q5225020" url="?curid=994713" title="Darren Lehmann">
<text>Darren Scott Lehmann (born 5 February 1970) is an Australian cricket coach and former cricketer who coached the Australian national team. He is currently head coach at Northamptonshire County Cricket Club. Lehmann made his ODI debut in 1996 and Test debut in 1998. He was on the fringes of national selection for the entirety of the 1990s, and only became a regular in the ODI team in 2001 and Test team in late 2002, before being dropped in early 2005. Primarily an aggressive left-handed batsman, Lehmann was also a part-time left arm orthodox bowler, and gained renown for his disregard for physical fitness and modern dietary regimes. He announced his retirement from first-class cricket in November 2007. Lehmann was a member of the Australian team that won the 1999 Cricket World Cup and the 2003 Cricket World Cup, where in the 1999 final, he scored the winning boundary, and took the winning catch in the 2003 final.

During his time coaching Australia, he led the team to be the winners of the 2015 Cricket World Cup. He also coached the IPL teams Deccan Chargers from 2009 to 2012 and Kings XI Punjab in 2013. He also coached Queensland during the 2010/11 KFC Twenty20 Big Bash, in place of Trevor Barsby who had resigned. In June 2013, Lehmann replaced Mickey Arthur as the coach of the Australian cricket team, only two weeks before the 2013 Ashes series. Although Australia lost that series 3-nil, Lehmann went on to coach the side to a 5-nil victory in the 2013–14 series less than five months later.

Lehmann stepped down as head coach after the fourth test match against South Africa in March 2018, following the ball tampering scandal which occurred during the match. He was originally thought to have been involved in the scandal, however Cricket Australia cleared him of blame at the conclusion of their investigation.

==Early years==
 Of German-Australian descent, Lehmann was a junior representative for South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club Central District as well as playing cricket. Lehmann left school at the age of 16 to work on the assembly line of Holden car manufacturers in Elizabeth, South Australia. He declined selection to the first intake of the newly formed Australian Cricket Academy, a full-time cricket centre, citing his enjoyment of the factory life. Lehmann entered the first-class scene as a 17-year-old in the 1987/88 season for South Australia, playing one match against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after both Tim May and Peter Sleep were called into the national team. After making 10, Lehmann was omitted upon their return and did not play any further part in the season. In 1988/89, South Australia were at the bottom of the ladder, when coach Barry Richards called Lehmann into the team, playing against Western Australia at the WACA. Lehmann remembered little of the match; after being struck in the right temple by a Bruce Reid bouncer, he was knocked unconscious and temporarily ceased breathing. Lehmann made his mark in the following match against New South Wales Blues at Adelaide Oval, reaching 50, but the innings was marred by the manner in which it was ended. Going for a quick single, Lehmann collided with bowler Geoff Lawson and was run out after falling over. However, Richards and South Australian captain David Hookes claimed that Lawson had tripped Lehmann, leading to a confrontation between the two teams.

In 1989/90, Lehmann came into contention for national selection, after scoring 228 runs at the age of 19 in a match against New South Wales in that season. He also scored a century against the touring New Zealand cricket team and followed that with centuries in three consecutive Sheffield Shield matches. Having scored over 700 runs in the first half of the season, Lehmann was drafted into the Australian squad for the New Year&#x27;s Test against Pakistan at the Sydney Cricket Ground after both openers David Boon and Geoff Marsh were injured. As Lehmann was not an opener, Mike Veletta and Tom Moody were selected, and he was relegated to being 12th man. Lehmann was also called into the squad for the triangular ODI series, but after being unused, he was replaced by Mark Waugh.

The following year, Lehmann was lured to move to Victoria by John Elliott and Ian Collins, then directors of the Carlton Football Club with a lucrative deal for him to play district cricket for Carlton, as well as the Victorian state team. Lehmann believed that he had a better chance of international selection, feeling that selectors disregarded batting performances at Adelaide Oval on the perception that it was a flat track. Lehmann was not, however, rewarded with international selection, but he did participate in a Shield victory in 1990/91. He was fortunate to play in the final, having needed facial surgery prior to the match after being struck in the nose during a training session. Following another season, Lehmann expressed dissatisfaction, and returned to South Australia.

== South Australia and Yorkshire: 1993/94 to 2007/08 ==
From the 1993/94 season until 2007/08, Lehmann played domestic cricket for his home state, South Australia, as well as for Yorkshire in England (from 1997 until 2006). During this time, Lehmann had great success as a player for both teams and he captained them both; South Australia from 1998/99 until 2006/07 and Yorkshire in 2002.

Playing for South Australia in this period, Lehmann scored over 10,500 runs in 107 first-class appearances for the state, at an average of around 55. In 1995/96 he was a part of the South Australian team that claimed the Sheffield Shield. He made 37 centuries with a top score of 301 not out against Western Australia at the Adelaide Oval in 2005/06. He also took 44 wickets at an average of 38.06. He held the record for the most first-class runs scored and first-class games played before selection to the Australian Test team prior to Michael Hussey&#x27;s Test debut in 2005. He currently holds the record for the most runs in the history of the Sheffield Shield/Pura Cup with 13635, over 2000 more than the second highest run scorer, Jamie Cox. Whilst he had great success as a player, his captaincy record was not as distinguished; South Australia did not win any silverware under his captaincy and he quit the role at the end of the 2006/07 season after South Australia managed to win only one Pura Cup game. Lehmann announced his retirement on 19 November 2007 citing injury concerns as the main reason behind his decision to quit. He ended his limited-overs career for South Australia on 21 November with an unbeaten 126 from 104 balls in an unbroken 236 partnership with Matthew Elliott (a South Australian record for any wicket in List A cricket) to complete the highest successful run-chase in Australian List A cricket so far. His final first-class innings for South Australia was a man-of-the-match winning 167 against Western Australia the following weekend.

From 1997 until 2006, Lehmann represented Yorkshire as an overseas player. He is by far the most successful overseas player to represent the club since the members first voted to allow overseas players in 1992, having played 88 County Championship games, scoring 8871 runs at an average of 68.76. In 2001 he helped Yorkshire to their first County Championship title since 1968, with 1416 runs in 13 games at an average of 83.29. He scored 26 centuries with a top score of 339 against Durham in 2006 during his final game for the club, helping Yorkshire to avoid relegation by a single point. It is the highest individual first-class innings at Headingley, surpassing Don Bradman&#x27;s 334 against England in 1930, and the second highest for Yorkshire behind George Hirst&#x27;s 341 against Leicestershire in 1905. He also holds the record for the highest one-day score for Yorkshire, 191 from 103 balls against Nottinghamshire at Scarborough in 2001. He took 61 wickets at an average of 32.00 in County Championship games. As with South Australia, his captaincy record was not as distinguished as his playing record. He captained Yorkshire only in the 2002 season during which they were relegated to the second division of the County Championship. They did, however, win the Cheltenham and Gloucester Trophy, the 50-over-a-side limited overs competition, under his captaincy. Lehmann was a very popular member of the Yorkshire team amongst both the fans and the club hierarchy. He stated at the time that he would like to return to Yorkshire in a coaching role after his retirement from playing for South Australia.

==Struggle to make the Australian side==
Lehmann had only limited opportunities at the international level. His body shape, relative lack of fitness and physical condition, while never dulling his run-scoring capabilities, meant he was never a favourite of the Australian hierarchy, and notably never saw eye-to-eye with former coach Bob Simpson in the early-mid-1990s. Simpson was regarded as one of the best fielders to have played the game, and was renowned for his heavy emphasis on fielding and fitness, the weakest aspects of Lehmann&#x27;s game.

With Simpson&#x27;s retirement at the end of the 1996 Cricket World Cup, Lehmann made his ODI debut later in the year in Sharjah after injuries to other players. He was a sporadic member of the team until the 1997/98 Australian season, when captain Mark Taylor was dropped from the team. Lehmann then became a semi-regular member of the ODI team, and also toured India in early 1998.

Lehmann made his Test debut in the Third Test against India in March 1998 in Bangalore, after Steve Waugh suffered a hamstring injury. Lehmann scored 52 on debut, as well as claiming Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin while bowling. Selectors were impressed with his performance, and when Waugh returned from injury on the tour of Pakistan later that year, Ricky Ponting was instead dropped. Lehmann scored 98 in the First Test in Rawalpindi, but an injury forced him out of the Second Test in Peshawar in which Taylor scored a (then) Australian record 334 not out on a flat pitch in a high-scoring drawn match. Lehmann failed to perform in the final Test in Karachi and, despite scoring his maiden ODI century, he was dropped for the first two Tests of the 1998/99 Ashes series. Ponting was recalled by the selectors, under the justification of &quot;horses for courses&quot;, as he was regarded as a superior player of pace bowling but weaker in spin, with the first two Tests being held on bouncy wickets in Brisbane and Perth. However, failures by Ponting in the first three Tests saw Lehmann recalled to the team for the final two Tests in Melbourne and Sydney. Further failures by Lehmann in those Tests saw him dropped in early 1999 from the Test team to tour the West Indies, who had a pure pace attack.

Lehmann retained his position, however, in the ODI team, and scored another century during the West Indies tour. He went on to the 1999 World Cup, where he played in every match bar one where he was injured, and hit the winning runs in the final. However, upon his return to Australia, he was dropped from the ODI team in favour of Damien Martyn, who was the reserve batsman. Lehmann spent the 1999/2000 international season out of the team, and was not given an opportunity again until the 2000/01 season. During that season Australia was in dominant form, winning all five Tests. Captain Steve Waugh took the opportunity to introduce a rotation system for the ODI series, and Lehmann was allowed regular matches as all members of the team were periodically rested. Despite topping the averages and Steve Waugh having the lowest among the batsmen during the round-robin stages of the triangular tournament, Lehmann was dropped for the finals series, as he was the least senior batsman in the team. Lehmann did not receive further chances in the Test format either, as Matthew Hayden, Damien Martyn and Simon Katich were all recalled in 2000 and 2001 when other players were dropped. Following Hayden&#x27;s heavy scoring in the 2001 Border–Gavaskar Trophy in India, he was afforded a place in the ODI squad, and Lehmann was removed altogether from the squad during the 2001/02 season. Australia however faltered during the campaign, and Lehmann was recalled for the final match of the series, in which he top scored. After Australia failed to qualify for the finals, batsmen Mark and Steve Waugh were dropped from the ODI team, and Lehmann&#x27;s ODI position became permanent.

Later in 2002, Mark Waugh was dropped from the Test team, and Lehmann was recalled for the first time in almost four years. After playing three Tests without posting a large score, Lehmann was injured, and Martin Love replaced him. Lehmann came under more pressure upon his return, when during an ODI against Sri Lanka, he had an error of judgment and was run out. Upon returning to the dressing room, he made an offensive racial comment which saw him banned for five ODI matches, becoming the first player banned for racial vilification. After missing the first part of the 2003 Cricket World Cup, Lehmann went on to take the winning catch in the final against India in Johannesburg. Lehmann&#x27;s Test spot was spared when Martyn was forced out due to a finger injury, with Love and Lehmann playing in the middle order on the subsequent tour of the West Indies. Lehmann then posted his maiden Test century on the tour, and on the winter Test series against Bangladesh in northern Australia, Lehmann scored consecutive centuries to solidify his position in the team. His Test career was again put on hold, when he was injured in November against Zimbabwe, allowing Katich to play in his place and score a century and top score in both innings in the Fourth Test against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground to stake a claim for Lehmann&#x27;s spot. However, Steve Waugh retired after the series, and both players were included on the tour to Sri Lanka. There, Lehmann scored consecutive centuries on turning tracks against Muttiah Muralitharan to help Australia to a 3–0 clean sweep despite conceding a first innings lead in each of the matches.
Lehmann&#x27;s position was again called into question on the 2004 tour to India when Michael Clarke had an opportunity to debut in Bangalore on the 2004 India tour, when Ricky Ponting broke his thumb, and Clarke scored 151 in his first innings in Test matches. When Ponting returned, the Australian selectors were obliged to select Clarke, meaning that they had to drop Lehmann or Katich. Lehmann publicly offered to be dropped following a run of poor form, but the selectors did not take the offer, and the younger Katich was instead dropped. Lehmann stayed on briefly, but after two ungainly dismissals to Pakistani paceman Shoaib Akhtar in the first Two Tests of the 2004/05 series, in which Lehmann was out of position after wandering across the crease, he was dropped in favour of Shane Watson for the Sydney Test. Another maligned shot selection in the following ODI series, attempting to reverse sweep Shahid Afridi first ball, resulted in his dismissal from the ODI team, with Katich again promoted. Lehmann was unable to reclaim a spot as Australia headed towards the 2005 Ashes series looking for batsmen to combat an England team fielding four pace bowlers, including three at the high speed of , and he was never again on the Cricket Australia&#x27;s contracted players list. In November 2007, he announced his retirement, stating that &quot;Physically and mentally I&#x27;ve had enough&quot;.

He published his autobiography, &quot;Worth the Wait&quot;, in 2004.

==Coaching career==

In 2008, Lehmann toured with the Cricket Australia Centre of Excellence as an assistant coach. After the Deccan Chargers disastrous first season, he took charge of them as coach – replacing former India player Robin Singh; Adam Gilchrist was named captain replacing VVS Laxman. Following the below-par performance in the inaugural season, and finishing at the bottom, Deccan then staged an inspired comeback in 2009 by winning the second IPL season. Subsequent to an undefeated run in the initial league stage, the team suffered minor setbacks by losing some close matches. However, the return of Andrew Symonds, Rohit Sharma regaining form, and the continuing exuberance of Captain Adam Gilchrist, bolstered the side. Some luck came the Charger&#x27;s way towards the end of the league stage, with Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals losing key matches, enabling Deccan to reach the semi-finals. During the semi-finals against the Delhi Daredevils (who were at the top of the table), few gave the Chargers more than an outside chance of winning. Nevertheless, and against the odds, Gilchrist scored a sensational 85 off just 35 balls to put the Daredevils out of the competition, thus giving the Chargers their first IPL final against the Royal Challengers Bangalore. In the final match, Gilchrist was out for a duck in the first over, however the Chargers managed to recover and posted a total of 143 for the loss of 6 wickets; it was felt that a good defending total would have been a further 20 to 30 runs. In the second innings the Chargers came out with all guns blazing right from the first ball, and their spirited effort ensured that they successfully defended the total, winning the game by 6 runs and lifting the prized IPL trophy.

On account of emerging as the winners of the 2009 season of the Indian Premier League, the team participated in the inaugural edition of the T20 Champions League, along with two other Indian teams. These were the runners-up of the IPL in 2009 – the Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Delhi Daredevils, the toppers of the league-stage points table. The Deccan Chargers were knocked-out in the group stages after losing to the Somerset Sabres and Trinidad &amp; Tobago, who they were drawn against in Group A.

After winning the IPL in 2009, there were great expectations of Chargers for 2010. Disappointingly, the team opened with a loss in their inaugural match against KKR, but subsequently won next three matches. Unfortunately, the Chargers then went on to lose their next five matches. This situation caused many to doubt whether the Chargers would be able to make it into next round, but they did so by winning the next five consecutive matches, which qualified them for the play-offs. However the Chargers lost both games in the play-offs (Semi-finals), and were relegated to third place.

Before the start of the 2011 Auction of players, the Chargers decided not to retain any of their existing team, putting &quot;all&quot; of them up for auction. The much anticipated Auction in January not only lived up to expectations, but exceeded them in many ways. The new Deccan team started the 2011 campaign by losing their first two games, but managed to win their next match. Thereafter the team started losing badly, and despite winning some games, were consequentially eliminated from the competition. The team managed to bounce back and showed some pride by winning their final three matches, although these results had no effect on the other teams&#x27; chances for qualifying. The Charger&#x27;s disappointing performance was clearly due to the inexperience of the new squad, and especially to the lack of internationally experienced Indian batsmen. Fans of DC have criticised management for not retaining Rohit Sharma during player the Auction. Deccan finally got to play IPL matches at their home ground after almost three years, but their dismal performances continued at Hyderabad, with but a single win against RCB being the only exception. However, in the away matches, the Chargers did manage to beat Delhi Daredevils, Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders, Pune Warriors, and Kings XI. They ended on a positive note with three consecutive wins, but were unable to rise above seventh position in the league standings.

In the 2012 Indian Premier League competition the Deccan Chargers named a new fielding coach Trevor Penney, replacing Mike Young. The Chargers failed to play consistently in 2012, with consecutive defeats – some by narrow margins. Shikhar Dhawan, Dale Steyn, and Cameron White were the only players who managed to help the team put up a fight. The team experienced weakness in the bowling and fielding departments, with fast bowler Ishant Sharma being ruled out due to injury, and spinner Pragyan Ojha traded to the Mumbai Indians. Deccan finished eighth out of the nine teams in the league stage points table, after languishing at the bottom for most of the season. The Deccan Chargers had come into the 2012 season being characterized as &#x27;underdogs&#x27;, and are yet to lose that name.

Lehmann expressed interest in taking up the England coach&#x27;s job, which was up for grabs after Peter Moores was sacked in first week of January 2009. Lehmann was not the first Australian whose name had been brought-up for discussion of the English job, as Tom Moody was also linked to the position. South Africa&#x27;s Graham Ford, the Kent director of cricket, had also expressed an interest in filling the post. After having his name connected to the English cricket team, Lehmann was also linked to the New Zealand cricket team, as they were searching for coach as well, to succeed Andy Moles who had resigned in October 2009. Lehmann, Mark Greatbatch, and Jeff Crowe were shortlisted as candidates for the post with New Zealand Cricket, with Lehmann eventually losing-out to Greatbatch. Lehmann was then named coach of the Queensland team after Trevor Barsby&#x27;s sudden exit in 2010. He took over as coach of the Twenty20 side to prepare for its opening match against Victoria. Under Lehmann&#x27;s coaching, Queensland won the 2011/12 (110th) season of the Sheffield Shield, the Australian domestic first-class cricket competition; this was only their seventh victory since joining that competition in 1926. They had won six out of their ten Shield matches, lost two, and drew two matches. At the same time as he took up coaching Queensland, he also signed to the Brisbane Heat side, which competed in an expanded eight-team domestic Twenty20 competition. Once again Lehmann&#x27;s old mate in the Australian team Shane Warne suggested to Cricket Australia that Lehmann would be a perfect coach for the young Australian cricket team. Warne also believed his old-school approach would be good for either the vacant head coach role, or a position on the selection panel.

Lehmann was appointed the coach of the IPL Kings XI Punjab franchise for 2013, replacing Adam Gilchrist who was coach (and captain) in 2012; he was himself was replaced in 2014 by Sanjay Bangar. As well as previously coaching the now defunct Deccan Chargers franchise, Lehmann had also played for the Rajasthan Royals in the inaugural IPL edition in 2008.

In June 2013, Lehmann was appointed as head coach of Australia, replacing Mickey Arthur who had suffered a bad result in the Champions Trophy. His first assignment was the Ashes series in England, which Australia lost 3–0, however they won the ODI series.

On 25 December 2017, Lehmann stated that he would not seek renewal on his contract after the end of 2019.

=== Ball-tampering scandal and resignation ===

Lehmann was suspected of involvement in altering the conditions of the ball, along with Cameron Bancroft, skipper Steve Smith, and vice-captain David Warner, on the third day of the third Test against South Africa on 24 March 2018. After an investigation by Cricket Australia, Lehmann was cleared of involvement. However, he later announced that he would resign as head coach of Australia after the fourth and final Test match of the series in Johannesburg.

In March 2019, Lehmann was named head coach of Brisbane Heat, a team in the Big Bash League. In July 2021, he stepped down as head coach of the Brisbane Heat to become the assistant coach of the team. In 2019, he was named head coach by Northern Superchargers, a team in &#x27;The Hundred&#x27; tournament. In January 2022, he resigned from the post, citing COVID-19 restrictions as the main reason behind this decision.

In October 2024, Lehmann was appointed head coach at Northamptonshire County Cricket Club.

==Playing style==
Lehmann&#x27;s batting technique was quite unconventional; taking guard outside leg stump, and, just before a ball was bowled, stepping back and across toward and sometimes past off stump. This peculiar technique meant that if the ball was short in pitch, he did not need to step back any further. Lehmann was noted for his play against spin, and was a useful left-arm orthodox spinner himself, as evidenced by his match figures of 6/92 against Sri Lanka in Colombo in 2004. He was relatively accurate, but had little ability to turn the ball and used a flat trajectory.

== Personal life ==
Lehmann is married to Andrea White, the sister of his Victorian, and later Yorkshire, teammate and English Test player Craig White. He has two children with his previous wife Emma, one of whom, Jake, has played first-class cricket.

<text>Thomas Masson Moody (born 2 October 1965) is a former Australian international cricketer and current Director of Cricket of Sri Lanka Cricket. He ended his long tenure with the Indian Premier League team Sunrisers Hyderabad in August 2022 and was earlier appointed Director of Cricket at Desert Vipers, one of the six franchises in the ILT20, which was scheduled to begin in the UAE in January 2023. Moody was a part of the Australian team that won their first world title during the 1987 Cricket World Cup, and their second in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. He was the coach of the Sri Lankan team which finished as runners-up at the 2007 Cricket World Cup.

==Early life==
Schooled at Guildford Grammar School in Perth, where his father was headmaster, he exhibited talent for athletics (particularly the high jump) and Australian rules football but excelled at cricket. He was selected to train with the 1st XI side (usually made up of year twelve students) at just thirteen, and play with them the following year.

==Playing career==
&quot;Long&quot; Tom Moody, so nicknamed for his 1.98-metre height, began his first-class career in the 1985/86 season with Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield and also played in England with Warwickshire and Worcestershire. Captaining WA and Worcester to various trophies, Moody, an aggressive and fast scoring batsman, scored over 20,000 first-class runs and hit 64 centuries; he was also a useful medium pace bowler. On 27 July 1990, in a county match against Glamorgan County Cricket Club he scored a 36 ball century. His 1,387 List A runs for Worcestershire in 1991 is a record for the county. He captained the Worcestershire side from 1995 to 1999 and was a key member of the side which won the 1991 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and the 1994 NatWest Trophy.

He made his ODI debut on 9 October 1987 against India during the 1987 World Cup in Chennai. He made his test debut against New Zealand on 24 November 1989 and scored 61 on his debut.

He played eight Test matches for Australia between 1989 and 1992, although he had more success with Australia&#x27;s one-day team, appearing in three World Cups and two finals – 1987 and 1999 – alongside Steve Waugh. He also became the first of two Australians alongside Steve Waugh to win two World Cup tournaments. He was even more successful when he threw a haggis the distance of 230 feet in 1989. He registered a 28 ball fifty against Bangladesh at the 1999 World Cup which was regarded as the then World Cup record for the fastest fifty.

In 1994, he along with Tim Curtis set the record for the highest ever partnership for the 3rd wicket in List A cricket history (309*) He retired from all forms of cricket in 2000-01 due to sustaining a back injury in his later career and was replaced by Simon Katich as the captain of Western Australia.

==Coaching career==
Since retirement in 2001, Moody has coached, been an Australian cricketer&#x27;s representative and for several years held the post of director of cricket with Worcestershire since 2001. He also served as the President of Australian Cricketers&#x27; Association for a brief stint. In 2005, he was in contention of coaching Indian team but the role was accepted by Greg Chappell. In May 2005, he was appointed coach of the Sri Lankan national team and he led them to the final of the 2007 Cricket World Cup before leaving the post. Moody was also in the frame again to become the head coach of Indian team replacing Greg Chappell for the 2007 World Cup but the speculations were later rubbished. He was also in contention to become the head coach of Australian cricket team replacing John Buchanan in 2007 but he pulled out of the race as he was not initially ready to return to Australia.

On 14 May 2007, the WACA announced Moody&#x27;s appointment as manager and head coach of the Western Australia cricket team for the next three years until 2010. He coached Kings XI Punjab for the first three seasons of Indian Premier League in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Trevor Penney, England&#x27;s fielding coach during the 2005 Ashes series and assistant to Moody in Sri Lanka joined as assistant coach. However Moody announced in March 2010 that he would not seek a new contract after the 2009–2010 season. Under Moody, Western Australia qualified for one final in three seasons, in the KFC Twenty20 Big Bash, in his first season which it lost to Victoria.

He then began cricket commentary around the world as well as covering some Australian Test and ODI Cricket for Channel Nine and the Big Bash League for Channel Ten. Moody still regularly commentates on both television and radio throughout the Australian international and domestic season.

In December 2012, it was announced that Moody would coach the Sunrisers Hyderabad team which was newly included in IPL ahead of the 2013 IPL season. Over the course of 2013–2019, Sunrisers Hyderabad have reached the qualifier rounds five times and won the IPL title in 2016. Moody had coached the SRH franchise for seven consecutive years. He had also coached the Rangpur Riders team in the Bangladesh Premier League.

Moody&#x27;s long involvement in the game has been recognised over the recent years with appointments to two significant consultancy roles. The first being appointed as the International Director of Cricket for the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) and the second being appointed in 2014 as Director of Cricket with the Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League. On 22 September 2017, it was announced that Moody would be appointed as the head coach of the newest team Multan Sultans in the Pakistan Super League for the 2018 season.
In June 2019, he was named as the coach of the Montreal Tigers franchise team for the 2019 Global T20 Canada tournament. Moody was replaced with Trevor Bayliss as the head coach of Sunrisers Hyderabad for the 2020 Indian Premier League. However, on 15 December 2020, Moody was appointed as the Director of Cricket of Sunrisers Hyderabad ahead of the 2021 IPL season.

In February 2021, he was appointed as the director of cricket of Sri Lanka cricket with the influence of Technical Advisory Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket led by Aravinda de Silva. He also became the first director of Sri Lanka cricket, a role which was newly created by SLC to uplift the standards of cricket in Sri Lanka. He was handed over a contract spanning three years and his job role includes analysis of future tour programmes, domestic structure, performance based contracts to Sri Lankan players, player welfare, education, training and development. In May 2021, he was appointed as the consultant coach of the Sri Lankan team for the white ball series against England.

<doc id="994718" wikidata="Q6840286" url="?curid=994718" title="Nick Knight (cricketer)">
<text>Nicholas Verity Knight (born 28 November 1969) is an English cricket commentator and former England cricketer. A left-handed opening batsman and a fine fielder, Knight played in 17 Test Matches and 100 One Day Internationals before announcing his retirement from international cricket after the 2003 World Cup.

==Early life and domestic career==
Born in Watford, Hertfordshire, Knight was given his middle name in honour of the 1930s English Test bowler Hedley Verity who was killed in World War II and is a distant family relation. He was educated at Felsted School in Essex and Loughborough University and was an outstanding cricketer from an early age. He won the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; &#x27;Young Cricketer of the Year&#x27; award in 1989 and played cricket for Brentwood cricket club from 1989 to 1991. In domestic cricket, he began his career with Essex in 1991 before transferring to Warwickshire four years later. He was captain of Warwickshire from 2003 to 2005, and led them to victory in the County Championship in the 2004 season. He retired from first-class cricket after the 2006 season and became a member of the Sky Sports cricket commentary team. He finished his first-class career with 16,172 runs at 44.18 and 40 hundreds. His highest score was an unbeaten 303 against Middlesex at Lord&#x27;s in 2004.

==International career==

===Test Cricket===
Knight struggled in the Test arena and made only one Test century, an innings of 113 against Pakistan at Headingley in 1996. His next best score was 96 against Zimbabwe in a drawn game at Bulawayo in 1996–97. The most obvious reason for this was his technique. Never afraid of genuine fast bowling, his footwork was often not decisive enough which caused him at times to appear to be backing away from short balls and his test innings frequently ended giving a catch to the slips or the wicket-keeper. As a fine fielder and a hard worker, it is surprising that he did not play more for England – the England team was not blessed with too many good batsman during Knight&#x27;s era. However two of the better batsmen were Michael Atherton and Mark Butcher with whom Knight was vying for a place for most of his career. Atherton too was captain of England until 1998 so would have been an automatic choice for opening batsman.

===One Day Internationals===
Debuting in 1996, he scored centuries in his second and third innings in ODI cricket, on consecutive days against a Pakistan bowling attack that included Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. Nick Knight set a world record for the highest ever ODI innings by a batsman when carrying his bat through his innings (125*) when he achieved it v Pakistan in 1996 He was also the first Englishman to carry his bat in an ODI innings.

Knight wasn&#x27;t selected for the World Cup team in 1999 and made his World Cup debut in the 2003 tournament. He performed well in an unsuccessful campaign for England and faced the first delivery in cricket officially to break the 100 mph barrier, bowled by Shoaib Akhtar. He &quot;pushed it nonchalantly to square leg.&quot;

==Post-retirement==
Following his retirement from cricket, Knight became a commentator and pundit on Sky Sports.

<text>Susan Ann Thompson was the 40th mayor of Winnipeg, Manitoba. She was born on 12 April 1947. She was the first and first to date only woman to serve as mayor of Winnipeg, serving two terms from 1992 to 1998.

Thompson graduated with a BA from the University of Winnipeg in 1971. Thompson worked at Eaton&#x27;s and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in Winnipeg, Calgary, and Montreal. Because of her father&#x27;s decline in health, she came back to Winnipeg in 1980 and bought the family&#x27;s business Birt Saddlery. While running Birt Saddlery, she worked hard to promote women in business and became involved in Rotary and the Chamber of Commerce. 

Thompson&#x27;s second term saw the 1997 Flood of the Century; she was instrumental in directing the fight against the raging river. She choose not to seek a third term, but in 1999 she became Canada&#x27;s Consul General in Minneapolis, United States - the first woman to have this position in its thirty years of existence.

<text>Vikram Singh Solanki (born 1 April 1976) is an English cricket coach and former first-class cricketer. In limited over international cricket, he played over 50 One Day Internationals for England as a batsman and occasional off-spinner.

In county cricket, he played for Surrey, having previously spent 17 years at Worcestershire. In 2007, he became the 24th Worcestershire batsman to pass 10,000 career runs for the county. He also captained Worcestershire from 2005 to 2010, before resigning mid-season.

In September 2015 he announced his retirement as a player. After obtaining an LLB from the Open University, Vikram then studied the Legal Practice Course at the University of Law.

Vikram Solanki has held a variety of coaching and administrative roles apart from his playing career. In March 2009 he was appointed Chairman of The Professional Cricketer&#x27;s Association, where he also held the role of Interim Chief Executive and in March 2017 he became FICA President, succeeding former West Indian International, Jimmy Adams.

== Early life and domestic career ==
Solanki was born in Udaipur, Rajasthan, India, but moved to Wolverhampton with his family at the age of eight. Solanki played junior and senior cricket for Wolverhampton cricket club and education from Regis School, Wolverhampton.

He made his first-class debut for Worcestershire in 1995, although he had played one-day cricket for the county two seasons earlier. In 1996 he was awarded the NBC Denis Compton Award. Although principally taken on by Worcestestershire as a batsman, on his first-class debut, due to there being no fit spinners available, he was selected to bowl his off breaks – something he had done with a degree of success the previous winter while on tour with England U19. Although generally an occasional bowler, Solanki produced a ten-wicket haul, five wickets in each innings, against Lancashire at Old Trafford in 1996. In 1999 he achieved a batting average of over 40, something he repeated in 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006. 2006 was also the first season since 2000 in which he managed to top 1,000 first-class runs, making 1,252.

Together with Worcestershire teammate Kabir Ali, Solanki accepted an offer to play for Rajasthan in the Indian Ranji Trophy during the 2006–07 season. Solanki joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL) in 2007, he made six appearances for the Mumbai Champs in his single season of ICL.

=== England A tours ===

Solanki was picked for two England A tours: to South Africa and Zimbabwe in 1998–99, and to Bangladesh and New Zealand in 1999–2000. His fine performances on these latter tours led to his making his full One Day International debut against the South Africans later that same winter. However, he was unable to translate his A-team feats into runs for the senior England side, and after eight innings yielding just 96 runs, he was dropped and not picked again for more than three years.

== English county cricket ==

Solanki was also an occasional bowler of off-spin for Worcestershire, although he has only bowled a handful of overs for England. Worcestershire appointed Solanki as captain of the county for 2005, succeeding the retiring Steve Rhodes. In September 2006 he agreed an extension to his contract which saw him remain at the county until 2009. Following a defeat by Glamorgan on 12 August 2010, he announced his resignation as captain with immediate effect stating that &quot;it was time for somebody else to be at the helm&quot;.
After showing good form in the first half of the 2009 season Solanki was called up to the England Lions squad for their fixture against Australia.

In July 2012, it was announced that Solanki would leave Worcestershire at the expiry of his contract in September, and join Surrey on a two-year contract. He announced his retirement from the first-class game at the end of the 2015 season, during which he played in only one County Championship match.

==International career==
Solanki represented England on 51 occasions in one-day cricket, but was never selected for a Test match. His natural talent only rarely came through into his performances for his country, and his England batting average was in the mid-20s. He made two international hundreds, 106 off 108 balls against South Africa at The Oval in 2003 (when he shared an opening partnership of 200 with Marcus Trescothick), and exactly 100 off 93 balls versus Zimbabwe at Bulawayo in 2004/05.

Solanki played in four of the five One Day Internationals when England toured Pakistan in December 2005, his best score of 49 also being the highest in England&#x27;s innings in the final match, which England went on to win by 6 wickets. However, Solanki was not selected for the team to go on the tour to India, instead being chosen to captain the &#x27;A&#x27; team in the West Indies.

On 1 July 2006, Solanki took his first wicket in ODIs at Headingley, removing Sri Lankan opener Sanath Jayasuriya for 152. It was something of a hollow triumph, however, as Jayasuriya and Upul Tharanga (109) had put on 286, a world record for the first wicket in ODIs,
and England were crushed as Sri Lanka scored 324/2 to win by eight wickets in just 37.3 overs.
Solanki made history against Australia in 2005 when he became the first supersub in a One Day International, replacing Simon Jones to strengthen England&#x27;s tail after a batting collapse; coming to the crease at no.8 with England 93/6, Solanki made 53 not out. He also took part in the final two matches of England&#x27;s time in the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship, replacing the injured Matt Prior. Keeping wicket and opening the batting in both of his matches in that tournament, he took two catches in the first, conceded no byes in either match, and scored 24 and 43. Those were his last international appearances.

== Coaching career ==

In January 2018, Solanki was appointed as Deputy Head coach at Surrey CCC, and in June 2020 he was promoted as Head coach by Surrey&#x27;s Director of Cricket, Alec Stewart, in succession to Michael di Venuto.

In IPL 2019, he was a member of the Royal Challengers Bangalore&#x27;s coaching staff, where he worked as an Assistant coach.

In January 2022, Solanki ended his nine-year association with the Surrey CCC after being appointed as the Director of Cricket of the newly added IPL franchise Gujarat Titans ahead of the Mega Auction 2022.

<doc id="994725" wikidata="Q5255519" url="?curid=994725" title="Democracy in China">
<text>Ideological debate over democracy in China has existed in Chinese politics since the 19th century. Chinese scholars, thinkers, and policy-makers have debated about democracy, an idea which was first imported by Western colonial powers but which some argue also has connections to classic Chinese thinking. Starting in the mid-eighteenth century, many Chinese argued about how to deal with Western culture. Though Chinese Confucians were initially opposed to Western modes of thinking, it became clear that aspects of the West were appealing. Industrialization gave the West an economic and military advantage. The Qing dynasty&#x27;s defeats in the Opium Wars compelled a segment of Chinese politicians and intellectuals to rethink their notion of cultural and political superiority.

Democracy entered the Chinese consciousness because it was the form of government used in the West, potentially responsible for its industrial, economic and military advancements. A segment of Chinese scholars and politicians became persuaded that democratization and industrialization were imperative for a competitive China. In response, a number of scholars resisted the idea, saying democracy and Westernization had no place in traditional Chinese culture. Liang Shuming&#x27;s opinion was most popular, holding that democracy and traditional Chinese society were completely incompatible, hence China&#x27;s only choice was either wholesale Westernization or complete rejection of the West. The debate centered on the philosophical compatibility of traditional Chinese Confucian beliefs and the technologies of the West.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) is not a liberal or representative democracy. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Chinese government state that China is a socialist democracy and a people&#x27;s democratic dictatorship. Under Xi Jinping, China is also termed a whole-process people&#x27;s democracy. Many foreign and some domestic observers categorize China as an authoritarian one-party state, with some saying it has shifted to neoauthoritarianism. Some characterize it as a dictatorship.

The constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the CCP constitution state that its form of government is &quot;people&#x27;s democratic dictatorship&quot;. The state constitution also holds that China is a one-party state that is governed by the CCP. This gives the CCP a total monopoly of political power. All political opposition is illegal. Currently, there are eight minor political parties in China other than the CCP that are legal, but all have to accept CCP primacy to exist. Freedom of speech and freedom of assembly are severely restricted by the government. Censorship is widespread and dissent is harshly punished in the country.

==Translation==

The most common modern translation for the English words &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;democratic&quot; in East Asian languages is . However, in classical Chinese, the compound could be interpreted as either a genitive noun phrase which would translate to &quot;people&#x27;s lord;&quot; or a subject–verb phrase which would translate to &quot;the people govern.&quot; The genitive-noun-phrase interpretation was well known in China as a way to refer to the reigning emperor, and was synonymous with another classical word, .

The first use of &quot;mínzhǔ&quot; that deviated from the two above interpretions was found in William Alexander Parsons Martin&#x27;s seminal 1863 translated book, . In order to translate the phrase &quot;whether monarchical or republican,&quot; Martin made use of the contrast between and . The genitive-noun-phrase interpretation would render such translation meaningless, therefore, it has been argued that the subject–verb interpretation was intended here. Furthermore, Martin also translated &quot;democratic republic&quot; as , meaning &quot;mínzhǔ&quot; actually encapsulated both &quot;republic(an)&quot; and &quot;democratic.&quot; The word &quot;mínzhǔ&quot; went on to be a popular translation for &quot;republic&quot; in multiple bilingual dictionaries. On the other hand, given that republicanism and democracy were completely foreign to the Chinese under monarchical Qing rule, authors often employed the &quot;people&#x27;s lord&quot; meaning (genitive-noun-phrase interpretation) analogously. 19th-century newspapers in China (especially those published by Westerners) often equated America&#x27;s head of state, the President, to China&#x27;s head of state, the Emperor. An 1874 issue of the paper used the phrases , and . An 1896 issue of even used the specific phrase in reference to an American election. George Carter Stent reinforced this usage in the third edition of his dictionary &quot;Chinese and English Vocabulary in the Pekinese Dialect&quot;, with translated as &quot;President of a Republic,&quot; and as &quot;a Republic.&quot; At this point during the late 19th century, four meanings of &quot;mínzhǔ&quot; coexisted: &quot;people&#x27;s lord&quot; (an East Asian hereditary monarch), &quot;the people govern&quot; (a Western democratic republic), &quot;the people govern&quot; (Western non-monarchical government, namely democracy and/or republicanism) and &quot;people&#x27;s lord&quot; (a Western democratically elected leader). There was no distinction between democracy (majority rule) and republicanism (government for the public good).

Meanwhile, in Japan, the word , modernized by in 1845 and reinforced by Fukuzawa Yukichi in 1866, became popular as a translation for &quot;republic&quot;. &quot;Kyōka&quot; (now &quot;kyōwa&quot;) also came from classical Chinese, specifically from an account of the non-monarchical Gònghé Regency. During the exchange of translated materials, including Martin&#x27;s &quot;Wànguó Gōngfǎ&quot; and various translations of Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Du contrat social&quot;, between Qing China and Meiji Japan, &quot;mínzhǔ&quot; and &quot;kyōka&quot; were often used interchangeably. The neat distinction of today between these two words as respectively meaning &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;republic&quot; happened gradually.

The first recorded example of the Chinese loanword used to translate specifically the English word &quot;democracy&quot; was in an 1870 lecture by the philosopher Nishi Amane, who used . In his 1877 translation of &quot;Du contrat social&quot; entitled , Hattori Toku () used for the French word &quot;démocratie&quot;. &quot;Minshu&quot; came to be associated more with an ideology, institution or spirit (in such phrases as , , and ) rather than a specific form of government that had been linked to &quot;kyōka&quot;. In a 1916 issue of the magazine &quot;Chūō Kōron&quot;, the Taishō political scientist Sakuzō Yoshino distinguished the two senses of the English loanword : he associated with a legal form of government that did not (and still does not) exist in Japan, and his own coinage with a political ideology that could (and still can) be implemented as constitutional monarchy in Japan. In other words, some Taishō authors started to give &quot;minshu shugi&quot; the form-of-government meaning of &quot;kyōka&quot;, while pushing for &quot;minpon shugi&quot; with the ideology meaning. However, &quot;minpon shugi&quot; did not quite catch on, and &quot;minshu shugi&quot; was used for both meanings of &quot;democracy&quot; by subsequent bilingual dictionaries.

On the other hand, the Japanese loanword saw a rise in popularity in 20th-century China. The defeat of the Russian absolute monarchy by the Japanese constitutional monarchy contributed to its 1906 peak in published materials by Qing aristocrats. Usage of &quot;gònghé&quot; among these constitutional monarchists continued to trump that of &quot;mínzhǔ&quot; during the following years. Some aristocrats, priding themselves as more virtuous and qualified to govern, had already attempted to distinguish &quot;mínzhǔ&quot; as democratic government by the people, and &quot;gònghé&quot; as government by a select few wise men like the republics of old. In this regard, &quot;gònghé&quot; was reinterpreted as &quot;cooperative and harmonious&quot; government between the monarch and his subjects, not true republicanism. Opposing the constitutional monarchists were the revolutionaries, who aimed to abolish the monarchy altogether. Chief among these actual republicans was Sun Yat-sen, who thought it was the people who were qualified to govern, and who went on to develop the Three Principles of the People. In this regard, &quot;gònghé&quot; was a stand-in for &quot;mínzhǔ&quot; as democratic government by the people. Although the victorious Xinhai Revolution and the founding of the seemed to show promise at first, Yuan Shikai&#x27;s attempt to restore constitutional monarchy and the subsequent turmoil proved that it was the duplicity of the constitutional monarchists that helped realize the revolutionaries&#x27; &quot;gònghé&quot; aspirations (democratic republicanism), which turned out to be merely nominal and illusory. The failure and eventual downfall of the Republic resulted in the later negative connotation of &quot;gònghé&quot; and the revival of &quot;mínzhǔ&quot;.

Among the 19th-century translations of &quot;democracy&quot; in China, was frequently found. This word traditionally meant &quot;popular/civil administration,&quot; or administration &quot;dealing with&quot; people. Contemporary foreign lexicographers intended it to mean &quot;people&#x27;s administration,&quot; or administration &quot;by&quot; the people, instead. During the 20th century, while also regaining its traditional meaning of &quot;civil administration&quot;, &quot;mínzhèng&quot; started to lose ground to &quot;mínzhǔ&quot;, likely because the Chinese were increasingly aware of &quot;democracy&quot; as a something fundamentally opposite to traditional Chinese government. Constitutional monarchists, such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, viewed &quot;mínzhǔ&quot; as dangerous, prone to chaos, and may result in the tyranny of a strongman &quot;people&#x27;s lord.&quot; They even used loaded phrases like and . Despite that, the fall of the Republic of China helped reinvigorate &quot;mínzhǔ&quot; during the New Culture Movement, whose members were disaffected by the failed implementation of &quot;gònghé&quot;. For example, CCP co-founder Chen Duxiu criticized constitutional monarchists for nominally claiming to support &quot;gònghé&quot;, yet worshipping antiquated Confucian ideas that are inextricably tied to monarchy and thus antithetical to &quot;gònghé&quot;. &quot;Mínzhǔ&quot; then signified a rejection of the failed &quot;gònghé&quot; model, a rejection of monarchical Confucian thinking, and an embrace of actual democracy and other Western thoughts. Occasional transcriptions like and were also used to distinguish from &quot;mínzhǔ&quot; as a form of government. Of the new concepts under the umbrella of &quot;mínzhǔ&quot;, the Marxist-Leninist idea of proletarian dictatorship, represented by such terms as , and , became the foundational thought of the CCP. In his 1918 speech entitled , CCP founder Li Dazhao used the phrase previously popularized by the Japanese near the end of the 19th century. In terms of meaning and connotation, this new idea of democratic dictatorship (dictatorship of an entire underclass of people) among communists was intended to be different from the idea of democratic autocracy (dictatorship of one populist leader) warned of by earlier constitutional monarchists, as well as from imperial autocracy (dictatorship of one hereditary monarch); yet, the brutal reality of the Cultural Revolution proved they were not so different after all.

== History ==

=== Qing dynasty ===
Introducing the concept of modern democracy is credited to Liang Qichao, a prominent writer and political thinker. In 1898, along with his mentor Kang Youwei, he submitted reform proposals to the young emperor, leading to the Hundred Days&#x27; Reforms. These proposed popular participation and elections, but provoked a crackdown from court conservatives and the beheading of several reform advocates. After escaping to Japan, Liang Qichao translated and commented on the works of Hobbes, Rousseau, Locke, Hume, Bentham and many other western political philosophers. He published his essays in a series of journals that found a warm audience among Chinese intelligentsia hungering for an explanation of why China, once a formidable empire, was now on the verge of being dismembered by foreign powers. In interpreting Western democracy through the prism of his strongly Confucian background, Liang shaped the ideas of democracy that would be used throughout the next century. Liang favored gradual reform to turn China into a constitutional monarchy with democracy.

Liang&#x27;s great rival was Sun Yat-sen who argued that democracy would be impossible as long as the Qing monarchy still existed. Sun proposed the Three Principles of the People () – typically translated into English as &quot;Nationalism, Democracy, and People&#x27;s Livelihood&quot;. This framing of democracy (&quot;minquanzhuyi&quot;) differs from the typical Western view, being based in Liang&#x27;s interpretation of General will, which prioritizes the power of the group over individual freedoms. Sun viewed traditional Chinese society as too individualistic and stated that individual liberty must be broken down so that the Chinese people could pressed together, using the metaphor of adding cement to sand.

The Boxer Rebellion and the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion exposed the need for basic changes. The Qing Imperial Court responded by organizing elections. China&#x27;s first modern elections were organized by Yuan Shikai for Tianjin&#x27;s county council in 1907. In 1909, 21 of 22 provinces, with the exception being Xinjiang, held elections for provincial assemblies and municipal councils. Requirements were strict; only those that passed the imperial exams, worked in government or military, or owned 5000 yuan of property may vote or run for office. This essentially limited the electorate to the gentry class. Hundreds of thousands voted and the winners were overwhelmingly constitutional monarchists, followers of Liang Qichao. The provincial assemblies elected half of the 200 member national assembly, the other half was selected by regent Prince Chun. All of these assemblies became hotbeds of dissent against the Qing as they were protected by freedom of speech. In 1909, the Qing government held parliamentary elections.

=== Republic of China ===
After the 1911 Revolution provincial assemblies provided legitimacy to the rebels by declaring their independence from the Qing Empire. The national assembly issued an ultimatum to the Qing court and delegates from the provincial assemblies were sent to Nanjing to legitimize the provisional government of the Republic of China. In late 1912, national elections were held with an enlarged electorate, albeit still small proportionally to the national population. Sun&#x27;s Nationalist Party dominated both houses of the National Assembly. Song Jiaoren, the incoming Nationalist prime minister, was assassinated in March 1913 before the assembly could meet. The military leader Yuan Shikai forced the National Assembly to elect him president for a five-year term then purged it of Nationalists. After Yuan&#x27;s death in 1916, a succession of governments failed to unify the country or gain international support. President Xu Shichang organized elections for a third assembly in 1921, but with only 11 provinces voting it never had a quorum and never convened. That was the last attempt to hold national elections until 1947. All assemblies were dissolved after the Nationalists&#x27; Northern Expedition.

During the Beiyang period (1912–1928), China&#x27;s disunity resulted in varied political experiments in different regions. Some regions experimented with aspects of democracy, including different mechanisms for election of city and provincial council elections. Hunan province, for example, established a constitution, universal suffrage, and some levels of council elected by popular vote. These experiments with partial democracy were not long-lasting.

During the 1920s, a common position among Chinese intellectuals from a broad range of cultural and ideological positions was that the people were not ready for democracy. Conservative intellectuals viewed the masses as too dangerous to participate in the political process. They believed that China&#x27;s modernization should rely on educated elites and that it would be a lengthy period before the masses were ready to participate in democracy. Many progressive intellectuals also lacked confidence in the masses. For example, many iconoclasts of the May Fourth Movement blamed the masses for their passivity in the face of the country&#x27;s difficult circumstances.

Sun&#x27;s 1924 program called for nation-building in three stages: military government, , and constitutional government. Sun&#x27;s view was that military government should be exercised during China&#x27;s revolutionary period, then as a province stabilized political tutelage could begin and the people educated on self-governance, and finally once all counties in a province were ready to exercise self-governance, constitutional government could begin.

The formation of the Nationalist one-party state in 1927 implemented sought to implement the &quot;political tutelage&quot; stage of Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s three-stage program, with elections only after the people were properly educated. Over time, portions of the KMT and various public intellectuals urged Chiang Kai-shek to move to the third phase (constitutional government), but Chiang&#x27;s view was that China remained in a revolutionary period and continued to need the KMT&#x27;s political tutelage.

In 1932, Chiang created the Blue Shirts Society, the core of which were KMT military officers who had been exposed to the politics of fascism through Chiang&#x27;s Nazi advisors. Blue Shirts rhetoric emphasized contempt for liberal democracy.

In an effort to improve the KMT&#x27;s disintegrating support during the late phase of the Chinese Civil War, in 1947 Chiang sought to allow some democracy and officially declared the third phase of the KMT&#x27;s program. The KMT initially allowed direct election of the National Assembly and for non-KMT parties to compete in the election.

After the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Nationalist government promulgated the Constitution of the Republic of China. The 1947 National Assembly and 1948 legislative elections were boycotted by the CCP which held most of northern China. As a result, the Nationalists and their junior coalition partners, the Chinese Youth Party and China Democratic Socialist Party, won the election.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===
The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) officially refers to itself as a &quot;socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics&quot;, but explicitly distinguishing itself from a liberal democratic system, which the CCP calls &quot;unfit&quot; for China&#x27;s &quot;unique conditions&quot;. In the PRC definition, democracy has meant the Marxist–Leninist concepts of people&#x27;s democratic dictatorship and democratic centralism. In this viewpoint, CCP acts as the representative of the Chinese public.

==== Early Chinese Communist Party views ====
At the 1929 Gutian Congress, the CCP addressed questions related to the politics of the Chinese Red Army. A resolution that followed the conference stated that the Red Army must be organized under the principle of democratic centralism. In the article &quot;The Democratic Movement within the Army&quot;, written during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Mao Zedong discussed the Red Army&#x27;s political work and stated, &quot;Through the democratic movement under centralized leadership, we were able to achieve a high degree of political unity, improve lives, and improve military technology and tactics, which are our three main purposes.&quot; This view of democracy in the military emphasized democratic centralism and avoiding what the CCP deemed &quot;extreme democracy[,] or anarchism.&quot;

Mao put forward the concept of New Democracy in his early 1940 text &quot;On New Democracy,&quot; written while the Yan&#x27;an Soviet was developing and expanding during the Second Sino-Japanese War. During this period, Mao was concerned about bureaucratization and sought to develop a culture of mass politics. In his view, mass democracy was crucial, but could be guaranteed only to the revolutionary classes. In the concept of New Democracy, the working class and the communist party are the dominant part of a coalition which includes progressive intellectuals and bourgeois patriotic democrats.This coalition of classes is symbolized by the four smaller stars on the flag of China: workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the national bourgeoisie. Led by a communist party, a New Democracy allows for limited development of national capitalism as part of the effort to replace foreign imperialism and domestic feudalism.

The Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was the primary government body through which the CCP sought to incorporate non-CCP elements into the political system pursuant to principles of New Democracy. On September 29, 1949, the CPPCC unanimously adopted the Common Program as the basic political program for the country following the success of the Chinese Communist Revolution. The Common Program defined China as a new democratic country which would practice a people&#x27;s democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and based on an alliance of workers and peasants which would unite all of China&#x27;s democratic classes (defined as those opposing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and favoring an independent China).

==== Later Mao era ====
The Cultural Revolution promoted political empowerment of ordinary Chinese people, according to academic Dongping Han. Prior to the Cultural Revolution, rural production team leaders were appointed by village leaders (who had themselves been appointed by commune leaders). In his fieldwork in Jimo, academic Dongping Han found that production team leaders during the Cultural Revolution were elected by team members to one year terms as part of what Han describes as a rising democratic consciousness among ordinary people.

In her analysis, academic Liu Yu distinguishes the concepts of &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;democracy,&quot; which she views as too often tied together. Liu&#x27;s view is that during the Cultural Revolution, China was &quot;extremely democratic&quot; while also being &quot;extremely illiberal&quot;.

==== Late 1970s to 1980s ====

In the Democracy Wall movement of 1978 to 1979, movement participants argued that democracy was the means to resolve conflict between the bureaucratic class and the people, although the nature of the proposed democratic institutions was a major source of disagreement among participants. A majority viewed the movement as part of a struggle between correct and incorrect notions of Marxism. Many participants advocated classical Marxist views that drew on the Paris Commune for inspiration. The Democracy Wall movement also included non-Marxists and anti-Marxists, although these participants were a minority.

Leaders of the post-Mao reforms in the 1980s argued that the CCP&#x27;s record under Mao was bad, but that the CCP reformed without being forced. The American political scientist Andrew Nathan concluded that &quot;the reforms aimed to change China from a terror-based, totalitarian dictatorship to a &#x27;mature,&#x27; administered dictatorship of the Post-Stalinist Soviet or Eastern European type.&quot; &quot;Democracy&quot; would not involve elections or participation in decision making but &quot;the rule of law&quot;, which was based on procedural regularity in the exercise of power.

==== 21st century ====
The CCP continues to operate on the Leninist principle of democratic centralism. From 2007 to 2009, Hu Jintao promoted intra-party party democracy (&quot;dangnei minzhu&quot;, 党内民主) in an effort to decrease the party&#x27;s focus on top-down decision-making.

In December 2008, more than 350 intellectual and cultural leaders, including Liu Xiaobo, issued Charter 08. The Charter said China remains the only large world power to still retain an authoritarian system that so infringes on human rights, and &quot;This situation must change! Political democratic reforms cannot be delayed any longer!&quot;

Chinese premier Wen Jiabao called for more democracy in 2011, having generally been regarded as a political reformer during his career. However, Wu Bangguo, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, said in 2011 that &quot;we have made a solemn declaration that we will not employ a system of multiple parties holding office in rotation&quot;, having said similar remarks during his career.

The CCP&#x27;s Core Socialist Values campaign introduced during its 18th National Congress in 2012, which lists democracy as one of its four national values.

After Xi Jinping became CCP general secretary in 2012, Amnesty International said that human rights in China have become worse. Human rights abuses are rejected by the government, which insists the country is run according to law.

Xi Jinping rejects notions of liberal democracy for China. In 2013, a CCP memo called Document Number 9 was leaked, which warned against &quot;Western constitutional democracy&quot; along with other Western ideas. During a visit to Europe in 2014, Xi Jinping said that a multi-party system would not work for China. He said China had experimented in the past with various political systems, including multi-party democracy, warning that copying foreign political or development models could be catastrophic because of its unique historical and social conditions. According to Xi, Chinese history after the fall of the Qing dynasty demonstrates that Western political systems do not fit China&#x27;s national circumstances. Xi states, &quot;China had experimented with constitutional monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentary politics, multi-partisan arrangement, presidential system, and others. All diverse political forces came unto the historical stage but none of them had successfully offered &#x27;a correct answer&#x27; to the question of national salvation.&quot;

Xi has strengthened the CCP&#x27;s control over the government. In 2017 and 2018 sessions respectively, the party and state constitutions were amended to include Xi Jinping Thought, described as the next stage of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Also in the 2018 session, term limits for the presidency were also abolished, allowing Xi to rule for life.

===== Whole-process people&#x27;s democracy =====

Xi has coined the term whole-process people&#x27;s democracy (), also called &quot;whole-process democracy&quot; (, ) which he said &quot;put the people as masters&quot; and that in it &quot;all major legislative decisions are made only after democratic deliberations and thorough procedures to ensure sound and democratic decision-making&quot;. He said that &quot;whole-process democracy&quot; had four pillars:
# process democracy () and achievement democracy ()
# procedural democracy () and substantive democracy ()
# direct democracy () and indirect democracy ()
# people&#x27;s democracy () and will of the state ()

In 2021, in response to the Summit for Democracy held by US president Joe Biden, the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China released a white paper called &quot;&quot; which praised China&#x27;s &quot;whole-process democracy&quot;, said that &quot;there are many ways to achieve democracy&quot; and disparaged American democracy as &quot;performative.&quot;

Under the concept of whole-process people&#x27;s democracy, whether a country is democratic should not be measured by the electoral process but instead by the results it delivers to the people. By using the improvement of living standards and development as the measure of democratic success, this framing favors China, which has undergone major advances in development and living standards during the last four decades.

===== Consultative democracy =====

The Xi Jinping administration promotes a view of consultative democracy (&quot;xieshang minzhu&quot; 协商民主) rather than intra-party democracy. This view of socialist democracy emphasizes consulting more often with society at large while strengthening the leading role of the party. Through consultative democracy, Chinese policymakers seek to balance conflicting interests and stakeholders as long as they do not challenge the CCP priorities, with the main channel for this being the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The CPPCC is an institutional component of the CCP&#x27;s people&#x27;s democracy and united front strategy, which provides a &quot;seat&quot; for the eight small legally-permitted parties and independent nonparty &quot;friends.&quot; These eight parties were founded before the proclamation of the PRC, and they must accept the &quot;leading role&quot; of the CCP as a condition of their continued existence.

Such institutional mechanisms for addressing the interests of new elites while also taking into account disadvantaged groups have been described by academics as &quot;administrative absorption of society&quot; or &quot;democracy in governance.&quot;

===== Critiques of democracy outside of China =====

====== Contemporary Chinese Communist Party views ======
Chinese policymakers generally view democratic political systems as hampered in their ability to pursue long-term development targets and long-term programs because of their focus on election campaigns and the frequent changes of government in such systems. In this view, policy under democratic systems as largely restricted to ad hoc interventions which leaves social development vulnerable to blind market forces and the short-term policy interventions available under democratic systems are not equipped to address long-term issues such as environmental degradation, dysfunction in capital markets, or population change.

Chinese policymakers generally view the experience of the post-Soviet states as an example of the harm caused by rapid democratization. According to this view, these states&#x27; adoption of democracy resulted in the collapse of their communist governments and a decade of political instability and economic instability.

The election of Donald Trump as President of the United States reinforced Chinese views that liberal democracy is dysfunctional. The United States&#x27; response to the COVID-19 pandemic compounded the situation, increasing views among the Chinese public that the United States political system and economy were not world benchmarks.

Contending that the U.S. has increasingly adopted a &quot;cold war mentality,&quot; foreign policy discourse by Xi Jinping-era officials and media have increasingly depicted global politics as a contest between two different views of democracy. This view deems the U.S. as excessively focused on the internal governance of other countries and creating divisions with countries like China and Russia. This Chinese discourse contends that, in contrast to the U.S. view of internal democracy, China seeks to democratize international relations by creating opportunities for non-Western countries to have an increased influence on international affairs.

====== Academic views ======
In his criticism of Western liberal democracy, academic Zhang Weiwei, promotes the idea of Chinese socialist democracy, which he describes as a combination of &quot;selective democracy&quot; and electoral democracy. Zhang&#x27;s view is that Chinese socialist democracy outperforms &quot;Western procedural democracy&quot; because the Western approach is insufficient to choose trustworthy leaders and the Chinese approach is more meritocratic. Zhang also points to China&#x27;s long-term stability and economic growth as further evidence of what he believes is the superiority of its system.

==== Elections ====

The People&#x27;s Republic of China conducts direct and indirect elections for its people&#x27;s congresses, a practice that began in CCP-controlled revolutionary base areas during the Chinese Civil War. The operation of people&#x27;s congresses were set out in the Electoral Law of 1953 and have been subsequently revised. Currently there are five levels of people&#x27;s congresses. From more to less local, they are: (1) people&#x27;s congresses in villages, minority nationality townships, and towns; (2) people&#x27;s congresses of cities that are not sub-divided, municipal districts, counties, and autonomous counties; (3) people&#x27;s congresses in sub-districts of larger cities and in autonomous prefectures; (4) people&#x27;s congresses in provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly administered by China&#x27;s central government; and (5) the National People&#x27;s Congress. Direct elections occur at the two most local levels, while the members at the higher levels are indirectly elected, i.e., elected by those elected in the lower levels. The National People&#x27;s Congress is officially China&#x27;s highest organ of state power. However, nominations at all levels are controlled by the CCP, and CCP&#x27;s leading position is enshrined in the state constitution, meaning that the elections have little way of influencing politics. Additionally, elections are not pluralistic as no opposition is allowed.

Starting in the 1980s, in the period of Opening and Reform, the government organized village elections in which several candidates would run, changing the position of the village chairman from appointed by the CCP to being elected by villagers. In mid-2000s the autonomy of elected village officials gradually eroded.

==== Special Administrative Regions, 1997–present ====
As European colonies, Hong Kong and Macau were denied democratic governments until very late in the colonial period. Official memos from CCP leaders, threatening the British government if they were to hold elections in Hong Kong, were repeatedly sent from the 1950s onwards.

===== Hong Kong =====
==== Citizen surveys ====
Surveys done with the World Values Survey and the East Asia Barometer in 2001 and 2002 shows high explicit support for democracy.

An Asian Barometer survey from 2014 to 2016 had 76% of Chinese respondents agreeing that democracy was capable of solving the problems in their society. However, when asked to rate the level of democracy in their own government on a 10-point scale, they gave an overall rating of 6.5 (the 7th highest percentage out of 14 different regions surveyed).

Zhengxu Wang of Fudan University in Shanghai wrote in a report in 2007: &quot;It is clear that public support for democracy is high in China. Public opinion surveys show that more than 90% of Chinese citizens believe that having a democracy is good. But the majority is not yet ready for a major effort towards democratization because they still see economic growth and social stability as more important than freedom of speech, political participation, and other democratic rights.&quot;

A report of two Stanford University professors, Jennifer Pan and Yiqing Xu, done between 2018 and 2019 showed that a majority of Chinese people believed that the government had no right to interfere in how many children people had, and that the government should allow public expression of negative views of government policies. The poll also showed that Chinese people with higher income or Chinese students studying in the US being more politically and economically liberal.

A 2020 Harvard University study conducted yearly since 2003 found that Chinese citizens&#x27; trust in their government has increased each year, &quot;virtually across the board.&quot; The same year, a survey by Stanford University and the Hoover Institution found that support for the CCP is between 50 and 70 percent, and that support for the government is typically overstated by almost 30 percent in citizen surveys. The same survey found that Han Chinese are more supportive of the CCP than are ethnic minorities and that minorities tend to conceal their views of the CCP.

In 2022, a poll by the Alliance of Democracies Foundation found that 91% of Chinese say democracy is important to them, with an 81% saying that China is a democracy.

According to Chinese economist David Daokui Li, the general trend is that age cohorts born in the 1970s and later take a more critical view of United States-style democracy than other age cohorts.

==== Democracy dimensions ====
The general Chinese public has virtually no say on how the top leaders of the country are elected, which violates the right to be a candidate as a democratic dimension for the conduct free and fair elections.

==== International rankings ====
China is considered internationally to be amongst the least democratic countries in the world. It has consistently been ranked amongst the lowest as an &quot;authoritarian regime&quot; by the Economist Intelligence Unit&#x27;s Democracy Index, ranking at 156th out of 167 countries in 2022. According to 2023 V-Dem Democracy indices China is the third least electoral democratic country in the world and ranked second least electoral democratic country in Asia according to V-Dem Democracy indices in 2023. Hong Kong was ranked 14th least electoral democracy in Asia according to V-Dem Democracy indices in 2023. According to Civicus, China&#x27;s civic space is rated as &quot;closed.&quot;

== Influence of traditions ==

=== Confucianism ===

==== Social harmony ====
A primary motivation within traditional Chinese philosophy is to preserve social harmony. It looks unfavorably upon anyone who attempts to disrupt this placidity. The election process that takes place in modern liberal democracy directly opposes this ideal. During election campaigns, the issues most frequently discussed are the ones that are highly charged emotionally and politically. In contemporary U.S. elections, controversial issues like abortion, gay marriage, military engagement in the Middle East are at the forefront of campaigns. Chinese Confucians consider these controversial issues to be cleavages within the fabric of social harmony. Western politicians rely on utilizing these social cleavages to garner support from voters. In Chinese culture it would be an impropriety for a politician to exploit these social cleavages to achieve the personal goal of getting elected. Consequently, many of the more traditionalist Chinese people consider the election process of the West and western-influenced democracies to be quite arguably inappropriate as per Chinese culture.

==== Serve the common good, not the majority ====
Another motivation in Chinese culture is to benefit the common good. Modern liberal democracy is based upon the self-interest of each voter. Voters are encouraged to choose an official that benefits them and promotes their interests. Elected representatives serve the interests of their individual constituents. If they do not adequately represent the beliefs of their constituency they will not be re-elected. Consequently, people of a traditionalist Chinese perspective tend to believe that the collective good of the people is under-represented in a democracy, which instead reflects majoritarianism.

==== The weight of the Confucian family ====
Another frequently cited argument against democracy in China relates to the importance of the family. Familial relationships form the backbone of China&#x27;s social structure. People are more concerned with their family than with politics. Based on this aspect of Chinese culture, many traditionalist Chinese viewpoints emphasize that in the absence of a strong authoritarian government, Chinese society would disintegrate. Thus in the eyes of many, a democracy would be too weak for Chinese society.

=== Christian influences ===
As per some points of view, there is arguably a correlation between Christianity and democracy, perhaps, as per some Chinese perspectives, liberal democracy has its historical basis in Christian culture. As a result, most current forms contain philosophical remnants of those probable origins. One such trace of Christianity is the empowerment of the individual. Christian concepts consider each individual to be sacred in the eyes of God. The concept of liberal democracy rests on all this sense that the individual has inherent worth regardless of his place within social hierarchies.

Traditional Chinese culture makes no such claim. In fact, the philosophical significance of the individual is often identified as an area of incompatibility between democracy and Chinese culture. Confucian societies are centered on familial relationships; an individual had no authority to revolt against these societal ties. An individual disconnected from the family is widely considered an outcast and relegated to the bottom of the social ladder. Confucianism lacks a universal reverence for the individual; personal status in Confucian communities is inexorably linked to one&#x27;s position within the social hierarchy. In this context, many individual rights cannot exist in the same way they do in the West. Naturally the right of the individual to partake in the direct appointment of a ruling official is an ideological inconsistency with traditional Confucian society.

=== Chinese pragmatism ===

==== Disassociation of democracy and well-being ====
A counterpoint to these examples is that as time has progressed, anti-democratic rhetoric has moved away from the philosophical and into the pragmatic. The boom of the Four Tigers and other growing Asian economies has severed the links between Western culture and material wealth in the eyes of many Chinese. In the early 1900s, scholars like Liang Qichao conflated democracy and power. For some Chinese, the economic success of Confucian and authoritarian societies challenges the idea that wholesale adoption of Western beliefs such as Democracy are requisite for economic success.

==== Optimism versus pessimism ====
At a fundamental philosophical level, Confucian tradition is contingent upon an idea articulated by Thomas Metzger as epistemological optimism. This expresses the belief that it is possible to understand the essence of high morality and design policies and laws that reflect that knowledge. Confucian society seeks to carry out all daily tasks and rituals in pursuit of fulfilling that universal morality. The modern conception of liberal democracy is grounded in the opposing principle of ideological pessimism. This denies that such knowledge is possible, thus the theory and practice of liberal democracy does not make rules in the pursuit of high morality.

<text>Dilip Balwant Vengsarkar (born 6 April 1956) is a former Indian cricketer and a cricket administrator. He was considered to have a very good drive. Along with Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Viswanath, he was a key player in the Indian batting line up in the late 70s and early 80s. He was a member of the Indian team that won the 1983 Cricket World Cup. Vengsarkar also led the national side to 1988 Asia Cup victory. He was also a part of the Indian squad which won the 1985 World Championship of Cricket. He went on to play until 1992.

At the pinnacle of his career, Vengsarkar was rated as the best batsman in the Coopers and Lybrand rating (a predecessor of the PWC ratings) and he held the number one slot for 21 months until 2 March 1989. In 2014, he received the C. K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award, the highest honour conferred by BCCI on a former player.

==Career==
Vengsarkar made his international cricket debut against New Zealand at Auckland in 1975–76 as an opening batsman. India won this Test convincingly, but he did not have much success. Later on he usually batted in the No.3 or No.4 position.

He played a memorable inning in 1979 against Asif Iqbal&#x27;s Pakistan team in the 2nd Test at Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi. Requiring 390 to win on the final day, he led India&#x27;s chase getting the team very close to a victory. India ended up with 364 for 6, just 26 runs short of what would have been a remarkable win. With Yashpal Sharma, Kapil Dev and Roger Binny back to the pavilion after the Tea break, Vengsarkar saw himself running out of partners and decided to play the last few overs for a draw. He remained unbeaten on 146.

During the 1978–79 Test Series in India against the West Indies, he was involved in a partnership of over 300 runs with Sunil Gavaskar at Calcutta, with both batsman scoring centuries.

He was a member of the 1983 World Champion&#x27;s team. He had a productive run of scores between 1985 and 1987, where he scored centuries against Pakistan, Australia, England, West Indies and Sri Lanka, many of them in successive games.

While the West Indies pacemen dominated the cricket world, Dilip Vengsarkar was one of the few batsmen who was successful against them, and scored 6 centuries against the likes of Malcolm Marshall, Michael Holding and Andy Roberts.

He is currently team mentor and coach for Telugu Warrior team in the Celebrity Cricket League Season 5.

He also scored a century at Lord&#x27;s in 1986, thus scoring consecutive Test match centuries at Lord&#x27;s in three matches.

==Captaincy==

Vengsarkar took over the captaincy from Kapil Dev after the 1987 Cricket World Cup, despite criticism that he missed the semi-final match due to a stomach disorder resulting from a seafood allergy. Although he started with two centuries in his first series as captain, his captaincy period was turbulent and he lost the job following a disastrous tour of the West Indies in early 1989 and a stand-off with the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

==Awards==
* Vengsarkar was awarded the Arjuna Award for his on-field performances in 1981
* For his contribution to the Indian cricket the Government of India decorated him with the Padma Shri honour in 1987.
* Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1987
* Vengsarkar was awarded the C. K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement award by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).

==Administrator==
After retiring, Vengsarkar started the Elf-Vengsarkar Academy in 1995. He became the vice-president of the Mumbai Cricket Association in 2003. Although, he was the front runner for the post of the Chairman, Selection Committee, Dilip opted out because of his policy against zonal representation. He was appointed the Chairman of the Talent Resource Development Wing when it was created in 2002 to develop cricket talent within the country.
Presently he is Chief Adviser of the Cricket Association of Telangana (CAT).

In March 2006, the BCCI proposed Vengsarkar as a match referee, but the proposal did not move forward as Vengsarkar accepted the job as chairman of selectors of the BCCI later in the year.

He runs three cricket academies, two in Mumbai and one in Pune. These academies give training free of charge to players selected on their skill level.

==In popular culture==
A Bollywood film &quot;83&quot; released in 2021 about the events around India&#x27;s first World Cup win, at Lords in 1983, features Adinath Kothare as Vengsarkar.

<text>The bolombatto is a traditional stringed instrument that features in the music of West Africa. It consists of four strings, stretched over a gourd, which serves as a resonator. The strings each have a different thickness. The thickness of it determines how low the sound will be. For example, a string that is really thick has a low sound and a really thin string as a high-pitched sound. In addition, the instrument also has a tin rattle attached to its body, which the musician plays by striking the strings and gourd simultaneously, adding an element of percussion to the music. In this way, it is similar to the &quot;sinding&quot;.

The &quot;bolombatto&quot; was originally played by shepherds, who used the combined sounds of the strings and percussion to frighten away wild animals.

<doc id="994731" wikidata="Q21482" url="?curid=994731" title="Katharine Burr Blodgett">
<text>Katharine Burr Blodgett (January 10, 1898 – October 12, 1979) was an American physicist and chemist known for her work on surface chemistry, in particular her invention of &quot;invisible&quot; or nonreflective glass while working at General Electric. She was the first woman to be awarded a PhD in physics from the University of Cambridge, in 1926.

==Early life==
Blodgett was born on January 10, 1898, in Schenectady, New York. She was the second child of Katharine Buchanan (Burr) and George Reddington Blodgett. Her father was a patent attorney at General Electric where he headed that department. He was shot and killed in his home by a burglar just before she was born. GE offered a $5,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of the killer, but the suspected killer hanged himself in his jail cell in Salem, New York. Her mother was financially secure after her husband&#x27;s death, and she moved to New York City with Katharine and her son George Jr. shortly after Katharine&#x27;s birth.

In 1901, Katharine&#x27;s mother moved the family to France so that the children would be bilingual. They lived there for several years, returned to New York for a year, during which time Katharine attended school in Saranac Lake, then spent time traveling through Germany. In 1912, Blodgett returned to New York City with her family and attended New York City&#x27;s Rayson School.

==Education==
Blodgett&#x27;s early childhood was split between New York and Europe, and she wasn&#x27;t enrolled in school until she was eight years old. After attending Rayson School in New York City, she entered Bryn Mawr College on a scholarship, where she was inspired by two professors in particular: mathematician Charlotte Angas Scott and physicist James Barnes.

In 1917, Irving Langmuir, a former colleague of her father and future Nobel laureate, took Katharine on a tour of General Electric (GE)&#x27;s research laboratories. He offered her a research position at GE if she first completed higher education, so she enrolled in a master&#x27;s degree program at the University of Chicago after receiving her bachelor&#x27;s degree.

At the University of Chicago she studied gas adsorption with Harvey B. Lemon, researching the chemical structure of charcoals used in gas masks. She graduated in 1918 and took a research scientist position working with Langmuir. After six years at the company, Blodgett decided to pursue a doctoral degree with hopes of advancing further within GE. Langmuir arranged for her to study physics at the Cavendish Laboratory of Cambridge University, persuading somewhat reluctant administrators to offer one of their few positions to a woman. She was enrolled at Newnham College, matriculating in 1924. She studied with Sir Ernest Rutherford and in 1926 became the first woman to receive a PhD in physics from Cambridge University.

==Work at General Electric==
Blodgett was hired by the General Electric company as a research scientist in 1918 after receiving a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Chicago. She was the first woman to work as a scientist for General Electric Laboratory in Schenectady, NY. She often worked with Irving Langmuir, who had pioneered a technique for creating single-molecule thin films on the surface of water. Blodgett and Langmuir explored the application of similar techniques to lipids, polymers, and proteins, creating monomolecular coatings designed to cover surfaces of water, metal, or glass. These special coatings were oily and could be deposited in layers only a few nanometers thick.

In 1935, Blodgett extended Langmuir&#x27;s work by devising a method to spread multiple layers of a monomolecular coating, one layer at a time, onto glass or metal. By repeatedly dipping a metal plate into water covered by a layer of a long-chain fatty acid, she was able to stack layers onto the plate with molecular precision. The apparatus which she used and refined is known as the Langmuir–Blodgett trough.

Blodgett used barium stearate to cover glass with 44 monomolecular layers, making the glass more than 99% transmissive and creating &quot;invisible&quot; glass. The visible light reflected by the layers of film canceled the reflections created by the glass. This type of coating is referred to as nonreflective or antireflective because very little light is reflected. 

While in principle, Blodgett&#x27;s multilayer thin films had potential for use as antireflective coatings, General Electric never commercialized them because they were too soft and could easily be wiped off a surface. Other types of films employing harder antireflective coatings or etched surfaces proved more useful for applications such as camera lenses. 

Blodgett also invented a color gauge, a method to measure the thickness of molecular coatings on glass to the nearest one millionth of an inch. The gauge employed the concept that different thicknesses of coatings are different colors. While examining the layering of stearic acid on a glass plate, she realized that the addition of each layer, about 2/10,000,000 inch thick, reliably changed the color of the plate. Before her invention, the best measurement instruments were only accurate to a few thousandths of an inch. Her glass &quot;ruler&quot; much more precisely showed the progression of colors and their corresponding thicknesses. Measuring thickness became as simple as matching colors. The color gauge was marketed for a time by General Electric. 

Blodgett and Langmuir also worked on improvements to the light bulb. Their studies on electrical discharges in gases helped lay the foundations for plasma physics.

Blodgett was issued eight U.S. patents during her career. She was the sole inventor on all but two of the patents, working with Vincent J. Schaefer as co-inventor. Blodgett published over 30 technical papers in various scientific journals. Her research also included the investigation of methods for deicing aircraft wings, and improving smokescreens during WWII.

==Personal life==
Blodgett bought a home in Schenectady overlooking her birthplace where she spent most of her adult life. Blodgett was an active community member and indulged in various hobbies. She was known for her contributions to civic affairs, including roles in the Travelers Aid Society and the General Electric employee&#x27;s club. Her interests spanned gardening, astronomy, antiquing, and playing bridge with friends. She was an actress in her town&#x27;s theater group and volunteered for civic and charitable organizations. She had a sharp wit and was known for writing an occasional funny poem. 

Blodgett spent time during the summer at a camp at Lake George in upstate New York, where other General Electric scientists also owned property, and she pursued her love of gardening. Even after retiring in 1963, Blodgett continued her horticultural experiments, demonstrating her lifelong commitment to exploration and discovery. She died in her home on October 12, 1979, leaving behind a legacy of innovation, resilience, and breaking barriers for women in science and engineering.

Blodgett&#x27;s niece and namesake was astrophysicist and civil servant Katharine Blodgett Gebbie. In an interview, Gebbie recalled that on family visits her Aunt Katie:

:&quot;always arrived with suitcases full of &#x27;apparatus&#x27;, with which she showed us such wonders as how to make colors by dipping glass rods into thin films of oil floating on water.&quot;

Gebbie often spoke in later life of her aunt&#x27;s influence by personal example on her choice of a career in science.

==Awards==
Blodgett received numerous awards during her lifetime. She received a star in the seventh edition of American Men of Science (1943), recognizing her as one of the 1,000 most distinguished scientists in the United States. In 1945, the American Association of University Women honored her with its Annual Achievement Award.

In 1951 she received the prestigious Francis Garvan Medal from the American Chemical Society for her work on thin films. That same year, she was chosen by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as one of 15 &quot;women of achievement.&quot; Also in 1951, she was honored in Boston&#x27;s First Assembly of American Women in Achievement (the only scientist in the group), and the mayor of Schenectady honored her with Katharine Blodgett Day on June 13, 1951, because of all the honor she had brought to her community.

In 1972, the Photographic Society of America presented her with its Annual Achievement Award and in 2007 she was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 2008, an elementary school in Schenectady bearing her name was opened.

She received honorary doctorates from Elmira College (1939), Western College (1942), Brown University (1942), and Russell Sage College (1944).

Blodgett&#x27;s accomplishments were widely recognized, earning her several prestigious awards. In 1945, she received the Achievement Award from the American Association of University Women, and in 1951, she was honored with the Garvan-Olin Medal by the American Chemical Society. These accolades were a testament to her groundbreaking work as a scientist and her role as a trailblazer for women in the field.

<doc id="994735" wikidata="Q7535505" url="?curid=994735" title="Skinner Butte">
<text>Skinner Butte (often mistakenly called Skinner&#x27;s Butte) is a prominent hill on the north edge of downtown Eugene, Oregon, near the Willamette River. A local landmark, it honors city founder Eugene Skinner and is the site of the municipal Skinner Butte Park. During the 1920s the letters &quot;KKK&quot; were burned into the hillside. A famous photo of Eugene&#x27;s downtown displays this marker, which is credited to Eugene&#x27;s own Ku Klux Klan members. The letters were removed and replaced with the letter &quot;O&quot; in the late 1920s. The butte later displayed a controversial cross or war memorial, depending on interpretation. The cross was replaced several times, but wasn&#x27;t permanently removed until 1997. One of the objections to the cross was its perceived association with Ku Klux Klan (Eugene grew to be a recognized national stronghold for the KKK through the 1950s.)

==Description==


The elevation at the top of Skinner Butte is above sea level, approximately above the surrounding city. A winding road leads to the summit, which provides a comprehensive view of the city. The public park features hiking trails and open lawns.

The butte is also the location of a giant &quot;O&quot; emblem (representing the University of Oregon) visible from the air and the city. Less visible is the &quot;Big E&quot; for Eugene High School (renamed South Eugene High School in 1957). These emblems were erected in the early 20th century.

The &quot;O&quot; was formerly lit prior to the Civil War football game against Oregon State. In 2010, the Big &quot;O&quot; was added to the National Register of Historic Places. A small reservoir sits on public land on the east flank of the butte below the summit.

==History==

The butte was known as &quot;Ya-Po-Ah&quot; in the language of the Kalapuya, who inhabited the Willamette Valley prior to the arrival of Euro-American settlers in the 19th century. In 1846, Eugene Skinner, an American settler who had arrived in the valley after traveling overland to California, erected a cabin on the butte on the advice of the Kalupuya, who warned him about floods on the Willamette. Skinner&#x27;s cabin became the basis for his Donation Land Claim. The site of the cabin is commemorated today by a marker on the hillside. A replica of the cabin has been located in various places in the park over the years.

Skinner Butte Park was dedicated in 1914. According to the &quot;Register-Guard&quot;, &quot;at one point, the park...included a car camp, a zoo and, during the Depression, a Civilian Conservation Corps regional camp.&quot;

The park is a popular site for rockclimbing (on &quot;The Columns&quot; the site of a former basalt quarry on the west side of the butte that operated from the 1890s through the 1930s) and birding, among other recreational activities. In July 2006, the City of Eugene opened a new playground, RiverPlay Discovery Village Playground, in the park.

The butte is also the site of the Shelton-McMurphey-Johnson House, a Queen Anne Victorian residence built-in 1880 by a family that once owned the entire butte. Before trees grew up and obscured it, the house was known as the &quot;Castle on the Hill&quot;. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The name &quot;Ya-Po-Ah&quot; lives on in &quot;Ya-Po-Ah Terrace&quot;, a controversial high-rise retirement home built at the foot of the butte in 1968.

=== Cross controversy===
A concrete cross was installed on Skinner Butte in late November 1964.

From the opinion of the 9th Federal Circuit Court, the official history of this controversy is as follows:

:The City of Eugene (&quot;City&quot;) maintains a public park on and around Skinner&#x27;s Butte [sic], a hill cresting immediately north of the City&#x27;s downtown business district. The land was donated to the City and has been maintained as a public park for many years. From the late 1930s to 1964, private individuals erected a succession of wooden crosses in the park, one replacing another as they deteriorated. In 1964, private individuals erected the cross at issue in this litigation. It is a concrete Latin cross with neon inset tubing, and it is located at the crest of Skinner&#x27;s Butte [sic]. The parties who erected the cross did not seek the City&#x27;s permission to do so beforehand; however, they subsequently applied for and received from the City a building permit and an electrical permit.

:Since 1970, the City has illuminated the cross for seven days during the Christmas season, five days during the Thanksgiving season, and on Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Veterans Day.

:The cross has been the subject of litigation since the time it was erected. In 1969, the Oregon Supreme Court held that the cross violated both the federal and the Oregon Constitutions because it was erected with a religious purpose and created the inference of official endorsement of Christianity. Lowe v. City of Eugene, 463 P.2d 360, 362-63 (Or. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1042, rehearing denied, 398 U.S. 944 (1970). Soon after, the City held a charter amendment election, and on May 26, 1970, the voters, by a wide margin, approved an amendment to the City Charter designating the cross a war memorial. Pursuant to that amendment, the cross was deeded to the City as a gift, and a bronze plaque was placed at the foot of the cross dedicating it as a memorial to war veterans. The Eugene City Charter provides that the &quot;concrete cross on the south slope of the butte shall remain at that location and in that form as property of the city and is hereby dedicated as a memorial to the veterans of all wars in which the United States has participated.&quot;

As a result of the 9th Federal Circuit&#x27;s ruling in August 1996, the cross was removed on June 12, 1997, and reinstalled twelve days later at Eugene Bible College in west Eugene, south of Churchill High School. Former congressman Charlie Porter, a Eugene attorney, advocated for the removal of the cross. A flagpole flying an American flag was erected in its place on the butte.

<text>Imperial College Union is the students&#x27; union of Imperial College London. It is host to varied societies and has student bars situated around Albertopolis. The Union is based in the north wing of the Beit Quadrangle on Prince Consort Road.

== History ==

The establishment of a students&#x27; union was recognised with the construction of the north building of Beit Quad in 1910-11 designed by Sir Aston Webb. The original idea for the building came from Sir Arthur Acland, a member of the governing body, who saw the need for a place for students to congregate and develop a collegiate social life.

=== Relationship with the NUS ===
Imperial College Union is most noted for the history of its relationship with the National Union of Students (NUS). Despite being involved in the founding of the NUS in 1922, Imperial College Union withdrew its membership of the NUS a year later. Since then, Imperial College Union spent long periods outside the NUS, interspersed with brief periods of membership. A referendum for NUS affiliation held in 2002 was overwhelmingly rejected by members of the Imperial College Union with 72% in favour of remaining out of the NUS.

In November 2006, after 30 years of not being part of the NUS, a petition proposed a debate to affiliate with NUS at Freshers&#x27; Fair 2006 collected 617 valid signatures, from just above the 5% minimum of Imperial College Union members necessary to call a referendum. A referendum was held between 14 and 16 November 2006, which resulted in NUS affiliation with 53.26% for to 46.74% against and a turn-out of over 30%.

After the failure of governance reform measures supported by Imperial College Union at the NUS conference in 2008, the union council voted in favour of holding a referendum on disaffiliation from the NUS. The resulting referendum showed that the Members of Imperial College Union decided that their Union should no longer affiliate to the National Union of Students.

=== Queen Heritage ===
The British band Queen performed their first London gig in the Union Concert Hall ) on 18 July 1970, Brian May having been a post-graduate student at Imperial College London. The PRS website quotes May as follows:

== Organisation ==
The Union is influenced by a variety of democratically elected representatives who sit on Union committees, control Union resources and represent the views of students to the College and external bodies. The Union is led by officers who act as representatives to the 14,900 Union members. The most senior officers are the five officer trustees who work full-time for the Union on a variety of areas ranging from commercial services to campaigns and representation. These officers are supported by 35 full-time and up to 250 part-time staff, and the 2,600 elected officers of the Union&#x27;s 320+ clubs and societies.

In 2013, the Union successfully registered as a charity.

===Constituent Union Structure===
There are five constituent unions which run as constituent parts of the Union. These are largely historical in origin and retain many traditions, such as their names when most of the actual faculties now have different names. Some represent the students in their respective faculties: the City and Guilds College Union (for engineers), the Royal College of Science Union (for scientists) and the Imperial College School of Medicine Students&#x27; Union (for medical students). They are all run by part-time officers elected from the student body, with the exception of the Medical Union President, who is an elected full-time sabbatical officer with a one-year tenure.

In 2002 the Royal School of Mines Union was absorbed into the City and Guilds College Union and became a clubs &amp; societies committee. However, in 2012 after running autonomously from City and Guilds Union for many years, The Royal School of Mines regained its constituent union status, solely looking after the social aspects of its students.

In the same governance review of 2012, Silwood Park Students&#x27; Union and the Graduate Students&#x27; Association (representing all postgraduate students) also became a constituent union. The Silwood Park Union operates largely independently from the overall Union but has no part or full-time sabbatical leadership. Following a postgraduate engagement review in 2022, the Graduate Students&#x27; Association was dissolved by Union Council.

== Clubs, volunteering projects and societies ==
Imperial College Union has a large number of student-led clubs, volunteering projects and societies (known as CSPs), with over 400 in total. Funding for CSPs at Imperial College Union is significant, taking up a sizeable portion of the Union&#x27;s annual subvention provided by Imperial College London, though many clubs supplement this with sponsorship from outside of the Union.

CSPs at Imperial College Union are administered by the Clubs, Societies&#x27; and Project Board, who deal with the majority of procedural issues and who are responsible for representing the clubs within their care to Imperial College Union. Clubs are then grouped and fall under smaller organisational boards (e.g. the Athletics Clubs Committee handles the sports clubs).

Examples of notable student groups are Project Nepal which sends Imperial College students to work on educational development in rural Nepal and the El Salvador Project, a construction based project in Central America. Other societies include sports-related societies, such as Imperial College Boat Club and Imperial College Gliding Club; music societies such as Imperial College A Capella; social societies such as the Imperial College Debating Society. Each department also has its own departmental society. Imperial College also owns a mountain hut in Snowdonia, Wales, which it lets clubs use free of charge.

Imperial College Union also has three motor clubs which each represent three of the Constituent Unions: Royal School of Mines, Royal College of Science and City and Guilds College Union. These are the RCS Motor Club, the RSM Motor Club and Team Bo and each look after the motorised mascot for each Constituent Union. The RCS Motor Club looks after Jezebel Dennis I which is a 1916 Dennis N-Type Fire Engine, the RSM Motor Club looks after Clementine Morris II which is a 1926 Morris T-Type one-tonne truck and Team Bo&#x27; looks after Boanerges II and Derrick I which are a 1902 James and Browne Veteran Car and a 1926 Ner-a-car motorcycle respectively. Almost no other University in the UK has societies as unique as this which makes Imperial College Union rather unique.

===Minibus Fleet===
Currently, the Union owns a fleet of 2 Peugeot Boxer and 2 Ford Transit minibuses as well as a Volkswagen Amarok pick-up truck all of which are available for clubs to hire. Both of the transits have aftermarket roof racks and one of them is converted to a 9 seater minibus to accommodate trips to continental Europe while the Amarok has a tow bar for CSPs that require one. 
Formerly, the Union used to own a fleet of 15 Ford Transit minibuses and sometimes the odd Land Rover. Minibus hire prices can be found on Imperial College Union&#x27;s website.

====Controversies====

The subject of minibuses has often been a big source of controversy for Imperial College Union over the years. For example, in &quot;Felix&quot; Issue 985 from January 1994 it was noted that a minibus was involved in a hit-and-run incident over the previous Xmas break. This same minibus was also involved in an accident over the summer holiday of 1993 and it was since found abandoned and burned out although it wasn&#x27;t entirely certain if the number plates had been swapped and used on a different vehicle. It later transpired in &quot;Felix&quot; Issue 987 that the ownership of the vehicle had reverted back to the insurers and the remains were sold on to a salvage merchant. According to Kent CID, it was later revealed that the minibus remains were sold to a buyer who gave false details. Subsequent owners of the minibus failed to register the vehicle properly and so the authorities could only trace the vehicle back to the Union.
In February 2008, a minibus being hired by the IC Canoe Club was rear-ended by a mercedes-benz car. This resulted in extensive damage to the minibus and a passenger in the mercedes-benz was taken to hospital. The minibus had to be off-roaded and the fleet was depleted in numbers as a result.

In late 2022, it transpired that 4 of the Union&#x27;s Peugeot Boxer minibuses had outstanding and unresolved safety recalls since late 2019. The source of the recall was the brake pipes in all Peugeot Boxers manufactured between 2016 and 2019 potentially not meeting or conforming to safety requirements and questions were being asked about whether the Union had competent enough permanent staff members in its Student Activities Team to look after such a fleet. Given that this made up just under half of the remaining minibuses in the fleet, many CSP bookings were severely disrupted and the future of the minibus fleet has remained uncertain since. A paper was eventually released by the Union&#x27;s Finance and Risk (FAR) Committee which outlined the options being considered however this paper was branded as misleading because the mileages and condition of the minibuses were completely untrue. This paper can be found on the Union&#x27;s website.

==Facilities==
===Bars===

The main Union bars are located on the north side of the Beit Quadrangle. There are three:
*FiveSixEight is a bar serving food, with large screens often showing sports events or popular music channels.
*The Union Bar is a small wood-panelled bar, and has existed in its current form since 1956. The bar used to have a large selection of real ale and claims to boast the largest collection of pewter tankards in Europe, with some dating back to the early 20th century. Each tankard represents an officer of one of the clubs and only the current or former club officers are allowed to use their club&#x27;s tankards.
*Metric is a nightclub which opened in November 2010. During term time, Metric often plays host to DJs or to live bands performing to the backdrop of an electronic lighting wall. During the summer Metric hosts some of the Proms Extra events (part of The Proms).

FiveSightEight and The Union Bar were both Cask Marque Accredited in 2017. As of September 2022 it has since expired.

The Union also runs the Reynolds Bar situated in Charing Cross Hospital, largely frequented by the students of Imperial College School of Medicine, and h-bar in Sherfield Building on the South Kensington campus, primarily advertised towards the postgraduate cohort.

The Silwood Park campus bar is operated by an external company, although students have pushed for a Union-run bar in recent years. The bar boasts Guinness and Stella Artois Cidre on tap and also has a small selection of bottled ales and ciders. Three flavors of crisps are available to feed hungry patrons. The bar television almost exclusively shows &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, and there is a small stereo in the main room which students can hook up to their own musical collections if desired.

====Controversies====
The Venues and Bars have not been without their fair share of controversies. In November 2019, the FiveSixEight kitchen was closed for two weeks due to serious health and safety concerns. These concerns stemmed from an overloading of the circuit board which powered various kitchen appliances. A member of staff got an electric shock in the kitchens at roughly the same time. This resulted in questions being asked about the general health and safety of the Union&#x27;s itself. The Union&#x27;s kitchen received a food standards rating of 2/5 following an inspection in August of that year by a local council Environmental Health Officer (EHO). The officer found mice in the bar and cockroaches in the kitchen which managed to get in via cracks around the edges in the buildings as a result of age. The kitchen didn&#x27;t reopen until January 2020, and eventually received a food standard rating of 5/5 in November 2021.

A group of 22 staff members were fired after making it onto the roof of the Beit building via a route which was deemed precarious following a leaving drinks event for one of the ex-staff members who had just left on 7 November 2021. The roof was accessible via a window which had a broken restrictor and thus it could be fully opened with a person able to fit through. This whole ordeal only came about to the Union&#x27;s full attention as a result of a complaint submitted due to alleged racist comments on a WhatsApp group chat used by bar staff members to discuss work related topics. The consequences of the sackings resulted in 22 people (some of whom were duty bar managers) being fired, the staff members in question having their Union memberships stripped for a few months and the venues suddenly finding themselves with a serious staff shortage.

===Theatre===
Imperial College Union has a theatre located in the Union Concert Hall (UCH) which is found on the second floor of the Main Union Building, Beit Quad. The majority of performances are put on by the student societies of Imperial College, ranging from serious drama through to Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Marathons. The space is shared with the Imperial College Dramatic Society and Imperial Cinema and other student societies as a multipurpose space. The theatre has a fly tower with a selection of lighting and fly bars, the venue has lectriflex, DMX and sound &amp; comms multicore installed throughout.

In the Summer of 2014 the Union Concert Hall underwent an extensive redevelopment after a grant was awarded to do so. In early 2015, the Dramatic Society installed a considerable amount of new cabling which will make the venue even more useful to anyone who wishes to use it.

===Cinema===
Imperial College Union has a student run Cinema located in the Union Concert Hall, in Beit Hall. The Cinema is considered a club under the Arts &amp; Entertainments Board, however provides a service to members and non-members.

The cinema is a professionally equipped cinema with a 33 ft screen, Dolby Digital surround sound system, Kinoton (35mm) and Barco (Digital) projectors and seats up to 200. Pre-show advertisements are provided by Pearl &amp; Dean.

===Redevelopment of the Union Building===
As of August 2006, £2.2 million had been raised out of the total £6 million required for the redevelopment of the Union wing of Beit Hall. All three phases of the building project were completed by 2011, including the full bar and nightclub refurbishment and the moving of the Union Gym to level 3 of the building.

<text>Metamorphosis III is a woodcut print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher created during 1967 and 1968. Measuring , this is Escher&#x27;s largest print. It was printed on thirty-three blocks on six combined sheets. 

It begins identically to &quot;Metamorphosis II&quot;, with the word &quot;metamorphose&quot; (the Dutch form of the word &quot;metamorphosis&quot;) forming a grid pattern and then becoming a black-and-white checkered pattern. Then the first set of new imagery begins. The angles of the checkered pattern change to elongated diamond shapes. These then become an image of flowers with bees. This image then returns to the diamond pattern and back into the checkered pattern.

It then resumes with the &quot;Metamorphosis II&quot; imagery until the bird pattern. The birds then become sailing boats. From the sailing boats the image changes to a second fish pattern. Then from the fish to horses. The horses then become a second bird pattern. The second bird pattern then becomes black-and-white triangles, which then become envelopes with wings. These winged envelopes then return to the black-and-white triangles and then to the original bird pattern. It then resumes with the &quot;Metamorphosis II&quot; print until its conclusion.

<doc id="994740" wikidata="Q7547192" url="?curid=994740" title="Snakes (M. C. Escher)">
<text>Snakes is a woodcut print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher. The work was first printed in July 1969, and was Escher&#x27;s last print before his death.

&quot;Snakes&quot; depicts a disc made up of interlocking circles that grow progressively smaller towards the center and towards the edge. There are three snakes laced through the edge of the disc. The image is printed in three colours: green, brown and black. The use of snakes and the color palette of this composition recalls an earlier woodcut by the artist, &quot;Möbius Strip I&quot; (1960).

The print has rotational symmetry of order 3, comprising a single wedge-shaped image repeated three times in a circle. This means that it was printed from three blocks that were rotated on a pin to make three impressions each. Close inspection reveals the central mark left by the pin. 

In several earlier works Escher explored the limits of infinitesimal size and infinite number, for example the &quot;Circle Limit&quot; series, by actually carrying through the rendering of smaller and smaller figures to the smallest possible sizes. By contrast, in &quot;Snakes&quot;, the infinite diminution of size – and infinite increase in number – is only suggested in the finished work. Nevertheless, the print shows very clearly how this rendering would have been carried out to the limits of human visibility.

==History==
The Namboku Line is one of Tokyo Metro&#x27;s newer lines, featuring advanced technology including full automatic train operation and platform screen doors. Although the line was originally proposed in 1968, construction did not begin until the 1980s, partly due to the right-of-way to Meguro with the Toei Mita Line. The first segment from to opened on 29 November 1991.

The line initially operated with four-car EMUs. Upon its extension to Yotsuya in March 1996, the formations were extended to six cars. On 1 April 2022, eight-car trains began operating on the line.

The extension to was completed in September 1997, and the last stretch from Tameike-Sanno to Meguro was completed on 26 September 2000, when through service to the Tokyu Meguro Line started. Through service with the Saitama Rapid Railway Line commenced when it opened in March 2001 and accommodated traffic to and from Saitama Stadium during the 2002 World Cup. Although the Saitama Line is more or less a northern extension of the Namboku Line, it nevertheless remains a private entity to which the Namboku Line offers through services with.

The Namboku Line was inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.

Effective the timetable revision on 18 March 2023, through services onto the Sagami Railway commenced courtesy of the Tokyu and Sotetsu Shin-Yokohama Line. Most southbound services past Hiyoshi continue as far south as Shin-Yokohama and Ebina.

=== Future plans ===
On 28 January 2022, Tokyo Metro announced that a spur line from Shirokane-takanawa to Shinagawa would be built. The extension is expected to cost and scheduled to begin revenue service in the mid-2030s. It is intended to increase connections to and from the Chūō Shinkansen, which is scheduled to open for service in 2027.

<doc id="994744" wikidata="Q3520021" url="?curid=994744" title="Kepler Wessels">
<text>Kepler Christoffel Wessels (born 14 September 1957) is a South African-Australian cricket commentator and former cricketer who captained South Africa after playing 24 Tests for Australia. Since retiring he has been a lawn bowls competitor.

He was a left-handed opening batsman. He played first-class cricket for Orange Free State, Western Province, Northern Transvaal, Eastern Province and Griqualand West in South Africa, for Queensland in Australia and Sussex in England. In 2008, he coached the Indian Premier League franchise Chennai Super Kings and later returned to coaching in South Africa.

== Early years ==
Wessels was six years old when he was introduced to the game of cricket. Volsteedt taught him the basics of the game and began to regularly play cricket with him during Sunday visits to the Wessels household. A few years later, Volsteedt became the master in charge of cricket at Grey College, Bloemfontein, and coached Wessels during his playing days for the school&#x27;s first team.

From a very early age, Wessels showed exceptional sporting talent. By the age of 12, he was playing rugby union for the Free State primary schools team and he was one of the leading schoolboy swimmers in the province. However, after a close encounter with death, due to nephritis, Kepler&#x27;s father decided that his son would no longer be allowed to participate in swimming.

Wessels decided to switch to cricket, even though the rules of Grey College did not allow him to play at such a young age. With the help of Johan Volsteedt (who was the first team captain), Wessels was allowed to participate in the net practices and soon cricket became his main activity during summer. During winter, he played tennis, at which he won so frequently that, by 1973, he was the number 1 under-16 player in South Africa and was offered a scholarship of $25 000 over four years from the University of Houston. However, due to the fact that he played as an under-16 against adults, Wessels began to lose regularly in senior tournaments. After a dramatic loss during the Griqualand West Open in Kimberley – after which he cut all the strings from his racket in the changing room – Wessels turned down the offer from Houston and decided to focus all his attention on cricket.

As a young cricket player, Wessels scored his first century at the age of nine and was taken into the Free State under-13 side during the same year, getting scores of 80, 80, 88 and 121 against players four years his senior. By the end of 1969, his batting average for Grey College (after nine innings) was 259.59. He was selected to represent the Free State schools side at the prestigious Nuffield Week for five consecutive seasons; and was selected three times for the South African schools side, the third season as captain.

Wessels finished his high school cricket career with an innings of 130 not out, during a home game for Grey College, against rival Queen&#x27;s College from the Eastern Cape. His superb innings laid the foundation for Grey&#x27;s first victory over Queen&#x27;s in 18 years.

He played his first first-class match at the age of 16, batting at number nine and making 32 for Orange Free State in a team captained by the Test veteran Colin Bland. At 18 he was playing professionally in England, opening the batting for Sussex.

== World Series Cricket ==
In the late 1970s, Wessels was drafted by Kerry Packer to play for the Australian World Series Cricket Team. As a South African with little hope of playing Test cricket for his country, Wessels joined the &quot;circus&quot; to take advantage of the better pay and conditions that the WSC offered.

He arrived in Sydney at the age of 21 and was put on trial at the local Waverley club, for Packer to see first if Wessels was decent material for World Series Cricket. After scoring 123 against Penrith, newspapers started speculating about a place for Wessels in the New South Wales state side. The media was unaware that Wessels had already signed for Packer. An innings of 137 followed against the Sydney club side and the selectors immediately named him in the state training squad. That was the signal Packer needed and he quickly called a press conference to announce that Wessels would be playing World Series Cricket instead.

Packer saw in Wessels a reliable opening batsman – something that the Australian WSC side was in serious need of. To help him find his feet in the new environment, Wessels played a couple of games for the second-string Cavaliers side. During his first game, two short balls had struck him in the ribs and on the chest, and in both cases, he refused to leave the field and battled on to score a 54 from the innings.

Finally, Wessels was included in the Australian XI, for a one-day game against the WSC World XI, which included four fellow South Africans. He scored 20, made 21 in the next game and then got 92 against the Cavaliers side. A Supertest against a &#x27;Rest of the World&#x27; side followed in Melbourne, but Wessels scored only eight in the first innings. In the second innings, he managed to get to 46. He regained some respect, however, during the next Supertest against the WSC West Indies, by scoring 126 in his first innings. During the Supertest final between Australia and the World XI, Wessels scored 27 in his first innings, but experienced a miserable second one. Australia lost by five wickets.

The one-day series involved a best-of-five final between Australia and the West Indies and Wessels scored an unbeaten 136 during the first match which was the only century in the WSC International Cup, during one of the finest one-day innings of his career. He scored 40 and 70 from the next two games respectively, after which the West Indies led the series 2–1. They won the series during the fourth match, thanks to a better run-rate, when Australia couldn&#x27;t finish bowling their 50 overs by the scheduled end of the match at 10:30 p. m.

A third leg to the World Series was due to be played in the West Indies, but Wessels was forced to stay behind, because he still held a South African passport and would not be granted visas for the Caribbean. It was the end of his World Series Cricket experience, as Packer reached a settlement with the Australian Cricket Board in 1979. The World Series was disbanded after that.

== Australian international career ==

=== 1982/83 England tour of Australia – debut ===
Wessels stayed in Australia to qualify for the Australian Test side, playing for Queensland, and made his debut against England at The Gabba in Brisbane on 26 November 1982. He became the first South-African born person to play for Australia, and the 13th Australian player to score a century on debut. Wessels dominated the English bowling, with scores of 162 in the first innings and 46 in the second. He was instrumental in Australia&#x27;s victory by seven wickets and was given the &quot;Man of the Match&quot; award. He eventually played four Tests in his debut series and scored 386 runs at an average of 48.25.

=== 1982/83 Australian tour of Sri Lanka ===
In April 1983, Australia played their inaugural Test match against Sri Lanka. Wessels continued his good form with 141, thus becoming the first overseas player to score a century in Sri Lanka. He was named &quot;man of the match&quot; in Australia&#x27;s innings victory.

=== 1983 World Cup ===
Wessels also played in the 1983 World Cup. He made 76 against Zimbabwe but it was not enough to save Australia from defeat. After failing against West Indies and India, he was dropped from the side.

=== 1983/84 Pakistan tour of Australia ===
Wessels played in each of the five Tests against Pakistan, scoring 256 runs at an average of 42.66. This included 179 in the third Test, which remained his top score. Despite this moderately good form, Wessels was outscored by five other Australian players who took advantage of the poor quality Pakistan bowling.

Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh all retired from Australian cricket at the end of the series, and much was expected of Wessels (and others) to score consistently in the upcoming series against the West Indies.

=== 1983/84 Australian tour of West Indies ===
Any hope that Wessels and other new Australian batsmen would cope against the West Indian fast bowling was dashed. Wessels scored 4 and 20 in the first Test and 4 and 4 in the second Test, before injury ruled him out of the rest of the series. He was dismissed by West Indian fast bowler Joel Garner three times, and was nicknamed &quot;Joel&#x27;s bunny&quot; as a result. For the first time in his Test career, Wessels&#x27; form had deserted him and he was not a certainty for selection when the West Indians toured Australia in 1984/85. However he won man of the series during a five-match one day tour of India in September and October 1984.

=== 1984/85 West Indian tour of Australia ===
As a Test player, Wessels&#x27; most successful period came during the disastrous West Indian tour of Australia. After scoring only 13 and 0 in the first Test, Wessels was in danger of being dropped from the Australian side. However, due to the poor performance of almost all of Australia&#x27;s batting in that match, he was retained for the second Test. He responded by going out for 0 after the second ball, and many people thought that his career was over. In the second innings, however, he top scored with 61, giving the selectors no option but to include him for the third Test. Batting up number 3, Wessels top scored again with 98 runs in the first innings and 70 in the second, in a match where the Australian batting was being taken apart by the West Indian bowlers.

The fourth Test saw Wessels continue his heavy scoring, with 90 and 0 helping Australia force a draw. It was in the fifth Test, however, which saw him totally dominate the West Indian bowlers with 173. His batting helped Australia to 9 (declared) for 471, which was a winning total on a wicket that was taking spin.

Wessels scored 505 runs at an average of 56.11 against the West Indies, which was more than double the number of runs scored by any other Australian batsmen during that series. Given the dominance of West Indian bowling at the time, and the fragility of the Australian batting line-up, Wessels&#x27; performance during that series was world class.

=== 1985 Australian tour of England ===
Unfortunately, Wessels was unable to maintain his form during the 1985 Ashes Tour of England. Although he scored three fifties (top score 83), Wessels ended the series with 368 runs at an average of 33.45. While this was not a failure, it was certainly below his best. Australia lost the series and suffered two very heavy innings defeats as, Allan Border aside, the batting lineup become increasingly fragile.

It is likely that the impending rebel tour to South Africa affected Wessels&#x27; concentration during the 1985 Ashes tour. Because of his South African background, Wessels was seen by many players and officials as one of the major contacts for the Rebel Tour amongst the Australian players. Wessels has steadfastly denied this accusation.

=== 1985/86 New Zealand tour of Australia – Retirement ===
Wessels&#x27; final match for Australia was the first Test against New Zealand in Brisbane, 8–12 November 1985. Wessels was alone in resisting the devastating bowling of Richard Hadlee, scoring 70 out of Australia&#x27;s first innings total of 179. He scored only 3 in the second innings, with Australia suffering its heaviest defeat against New Zealand.

Soon after the match was finished, Wessels announced his retirement, expressing his disillusionment with Australian cricket. He did not realise that 6 years later he would be playing Test Cricket again, this time for his home nation.

== Between Test careers ==

Cricket was still Wessels&#x27; profession, and he played a full season (1985/86) of Sheffield Shield Cricket for Queensland where he scored 957 runs at an average of 50.37. He also captained the side in Border&#x27;s absence, and was unlucky not to captain the first Queensland side to win the Sheffield Shield. The final, between NSW and Queensland, was held in Sydney on 14–18 March 1986. Despite Wessels scoring 166 and 29 in his last match for Queensland, and despite a dominating all-round performance from his team, the match ended in a draw, which allowed NSW to win the Sheffield Shield. Wessels&#x27; last act for Queensland was a creditable individual bowling performance of 16–5–26–2, including the wicket of a young Mark Waugh.

After the season finished, Wessels re-settled in South Africa again and began playing, this time for Eastern Province. Before moving to Australia, Wessels had played for Orange Free State, Western Province and Northern Transvaal. He continued to play for Eastern Province from 1986 until his retirement in 2000. His debut with Eastern Province was auspicious, captaining the side to a 212-run victory over Orange Free State, and scoring 133 and 78 against a bowling attack that included a young Allan Donald.

Wessels was also included in the 1986-7 Australian rebel tour to South Africa, where he played for Australia. The series of four &quot;Tests&quot; ended in a 1–0 victory to the South African team, but Wessels scored 327 runs at 54.50, including two centuries in the fourth match. Wessels played with many former Australian teammates in this series, including Kim Hughes, John Dyson, Steve Smith, Rodney Hogg, Carl Rackemann and Terry Alderman. His involvement in this tour re-ignited suspicions that he was one of the covert organizers, but it was the last time Wessels ever represented Australia in cricket.

Frank Heydenrych, writing for the 1991 Wisden, comments upon Eastern Province&#x27;s success during this season:
:&quot;...from the way that Kepler Wessels, (the Eastern Province captain), had reinforced their playing squad with high-quality players, it was difficult to see an immediate end to the golden days (and nights) he had brought to Eastern Province.&quot;

In 1989/90 Wessels also played for South Africa against a rebel English team captained by Mike Gatting. He scored 1 &amp; 2 in the only match played, which South Africa won.

== Captain of the &#x27;new&#x27; South Africa ==
With apartheid being removed from South Africa in 1991, the International Cricket Council unanimously removed the ban against playing South Africa. As a result, South Africa could now play Test and One-day international cricket.

=== The 1992 Cricket World Cup ===
When South Africa played its first Test since March 1970, ten of the eleven players were making their debuts. At 34, Wessels had both the first-class experience of contemporaries such as Clive Rice and Jimmy Cook, but also had experience at Test level that no other South African player had. As a result of these credentials, he was chosen to captain the inexperienced South African side to the 1992 Cricket World Cup, which would signal the country&#x27;s return to official international cricket. The decision to name Wessels captain over such local heroes as Rice and Cook (who both didn&#x27;t even make the side) was met by widespread controversy. More than 10 000 signatures were collected for a petition against the dropping of Rice and Cook, while 71 percent of provincial players told the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; in South Africa, that they had no confidence in the selectors.

Despite the local outrage, Wessels led the unknown South African side in the tournament. Playing against Australia in their opening match, they produced what was arguably the biggest surprise of the tournament, beating the hosts by nine wickets. However, the spectacular victory was followed by consecutive defeats against New Zealand and Sri Lanka. Once again, criticism against Wessels started to mount back in South Africa, with many analysts believing that South Africa&#x27;s problems were caused by the captain&#x27;s conservative approach to one-day cricket. South Africa desperately needed to win their next match against the West Indies and, thanks to a vicious bowling assault on their batsmen, the South Africans claimed victory. They won their remaining matches against Pakistan and Zimbabwe, but lost against England. The last group match against India was now vital if they were to reach the semi-finals of the tournament. Rain-delays caused the match to be played 30 overs a side and, once again, South Africa managed to secure victory after India set an imposing target. Wessels and his team were to play against England in Sydney.

Four days before the semi-final, South African President F.W. de Klerk called a referendum on political reform in South Africa, and the result of the vote seemed vital for South Africa&#x27;s continuing in the Cricket World Cup. Some even suggested that the team would be withdrawn from the tournament, if the result of the referendum had been negative. The result of 68.7% in favour of political reform, ensured not only the cricket team&#x27;s continuing participation in the tournament, but also the future participation of other South African sports teams in international competitions.

The semi-final against England took place on 22 March 1992 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. England reached a total of 252 for 6 (in 45 overs) and South Africa required a run-rate of 5.62 to win. With 13 balls left in the match, they required 22 more runs, when rain suddenly started pouring down over Sydney. Two overs (or 12 balls) were lost and when play resumed, South Africa&#x27;s new target was calculated by subtracting the number of runs England had scored in their two least productive overs (those totalling just one run). South Africa thus required 21 runs off one ball, although the scoreboard initially displayed a target of 22. The last ball was played with batsman Brian MacMillan scoring a single, and South Africa lost the semi-final by 19 runs. The team did a lap of honour around the Sydney Cricket Ground, providing one of the most lasting images of the tournament.

=== 1991/92 tour of the West Indies ===
South Africa narrowly lost to a West Indian team featuring such players as Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, Patrick Patterson, Desmond Haynes and Brian Lara. South Africa, under Wessels&#x27; leadership, controlled most of the match but fell for 148 chasing 201 for victory in the final innings. This was blamed on remarkable bowling from the West Indian pacemen, with one reporter commenting; &#x27;They [Walsh and Ambrose] pitched everything on off stump and let a pitch stricken by multiple-personality disorder do the rest. Each perfect delivery was followed by another perfect delivery. It was as if Richie Richardson had found a loophole in the laws that allowed him to unleash the same unplayable bowler from both ends. Fittingly, that Wambrose bloke ended up with 10 wickets.&#x27; Wessels contributed 59 and 74 in this Test.

=== 1993/94 tour of Australia and 1994 tour of England ===
During the 1993/94 international season, Wessels&#x27; cricketing career reached full circle, as he captained the South African side in a tour to Australia. The first Test match of the tour, in Melbourne, was drawn. The second, and arguably most memorable, test was played out in front of a capacity crowd in Sydney. It turned out to be Wessels&#x27; last match of the tour, following a hand injury during play. Shane Warne took seven wickets in the first innings and everything seemed lost for the South Africans. However, thanks to some heroic bowling and batting by the visitors, Australia was eventually set a winning target of 117 runs in the second innings. The home side was bowled out for 110 runs, and South Africa won their first Test match against Australia since 1970. Wessels was forced to return to South Africa because of his injury, thus missing out on the rest of the tour. He was, however, immediately reinstated as captain for the home series against Australia. The series was drawn 1–1, and Wessels was criticised for &#x27;baffling&#x27; captaincy in the final Test by failing to declare and allowing the tail to score slowly when South Africa seemed to be in a position to win the match and the series.

He led the side to England in the summer of 1994, drawing the three Test series 1–1. Following a heavy defeat at the Oval, however, where he made the second highest score of 28 with the bat during a major collapse in the second innings, he retired from Test cricket and was replaced as captain by Hansie Cronje.

== After retirement ==
After retiring he coached English county side Northamptonshire from 2003 to 2006. His son, Riki Wessels, also played for the club as a Kolpak player. In 2008, he was chosen to coach the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He later moved to the Highveld Lions franchise in South Africa as a consultant. In 2018, Wessels became a member of the Cricket Australia Supplementary Referee Panel. As of 2020 he is Director of Coaching and First Grade Coach for the South Brisbane District Cricket Club.

== Criticism ==

Wessels was the subject of much criticism during his cricket career, especially from his country of birth, South Africa. It ranged from doubts over his ability to play one-day cricket, his &quot;ugly&quot; stance to his style of captaining as well as his rather serious approach to the game.

=== Ability to play one-day cricket ===
Wessels was, at times, heavily criticised for his alleged inability to play one-day cricket. Although he played 109 One Day Internationals for both Australia and South Africa, he averaged only 34.35, at a strike rate of 55.3, and scored only one ODI century in his career.

From the Channel Nine commentary box, Tony Greig went as far as to say that Wessels &quot;went through a period when his temperament was totally against everything that one-day cricket stood for.&quot; Wessels pointed out that he fulfilled the anchor role in the side and that it was his job to bat throughout an innings. Former Australian captain and teammate Kim Hughes, had publicly supported Wessels on this fact, saying: &quot;Kepler hits so many boundaries that he is always going to score enough runs and, even in one-day cricket, you need someone who can anchor the innings. He&#x27;s the bloke I want in that role.&quot;

Despite the criticism, Wessels collected many player&#x27;s accolades during his ODI career, including the &quot;Man of the Series&quot; award during the 1983 ODI series against the West Indies, as well as the &quot;Man of the Match&quot; award for his 81 not out against Australia in the 1992 World Cup. He was never dismissed for a duck during his 105 ODI innings; no other retired player can boast this feat for a career longer than 50 innings.

=== Captaincy ===
During the 1989 Currie Cup final in Port Elizabeth, Wessels angered South African cricket authorities by letting his Eastern Province side bat deep into the third day, without declaring the first innings closed. He was accused of killing the game and ruining what was supposed to be the annual showpiece of South African cricket, by not giving his opponents, Transvaal, a fair chance at batting. However, the decision proved to be correct from an Eastern Province point of view, as the home side managed to bowl Transvaal out twice by the fifth day, thereby winning by an innings and 103 runs.

As captain of the national side, Wessels was similarly criticised for playing too conservatively in South Africa&#x27;s first test series since readmission into international cricket. Although South Africa won the home series against India by 1–0, fans and critics sharpened their pencils and attacked the captain mercilessly for his team&#x27;s apparent lack of passion and ambition. The fourth test in Cape Town, in particular, was condemned across the cricketing world. The two teams scored a total of 795 runs in 433.4 overs, at an average of only 1.83 runs per over and ended in a draw. Wessels commented on the criticism in his biography, saying: &quot;It was almost as if they thought we should win every series 4–0. They simply don&#x27;t understand that modern Test cricket is tough and competitive.&quot;

==Lawn bowls career==
Since retiring he has taken up lawn bowls, playing for the Belgravia Bowls Club and has twice finished runner-up in the National Championships; in 2013 in the fours event and again in 2016 in the pairs event with Gerry Baker.

<text>Najam Aziz Sethi (Punjabi:نجم سیٹھی}}; born 20 May 1948) is a Pakistani journalist, businessman and cricket administrator. He is the current chief executive officer (CEO) of Mitchell&#x27;s. Previously, he served as the Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in three different tenures and as a caretaker Federal Minister of Pakistan and Chief Minister of Punjab one time. He is also the founder of &quot;The Friday Times&quot; and &quot;Vanguard Books&quot;.

As a journalist, he is a left-leaning political commentator who serves as the editor-in-chief of &quot;The Friday Times&quot; and formerly served as the Chairman of the Pakistan Super League. He has also served as the caretaker chief minister of Punjab during the 2013 election. He formerly used to host primetime current affairs show &quot;Aapas ki Baat&quot; on Geo News. He is currently the President of AAP Media Media Network / Indus News.

Najam Sethi began his sociopolitical endeavours with the socialist movement working for the rights of Balochistan, leading to his arrest in 1975 before being discharged in 1978. He consequently left politics and established &quot;Vanguard Books&quot;, a progressive book publishing company.

In 1989, Sethi along with his wife Jugnu Mohsin launched an independent English weekly, &quot;The Friday Times&quot;. He was arrested by the second Nawaz Sharif government in 1999 on trumped-up charges of treason before being released by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. In 2002, he founded the &quot;Daily Times of Pakistan&quot; and became its editor until leaving in October 2009. He also served as the Pakistan correspondent of &quot;The Economist&quot; from 1990 to 2008.

Sethi won the 1999 International Press Freedom Award of the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists and the 2009 World Association of Newspapers&#x27; Golden Pen of Freedom Award. On 26 March 2013, his name was approved for the interim position of the chief minister of Punjab as a result of consensus between members of the selection committee comprising individuals from both the governing and the opposing political parties. He took the oath on 27 March 2013, and left the office after the May 2013 elections on 6 June 2013.

== Career ==
According to Sethi, he first conceived of the idea for an independent Pakistani newspaper out of frustration: while briefly imprisoned in 1984 on trumped-up copyright charges, no newspapers had protested his arrest. The following year, he and Mohsin applied for a publishing licence under Mohsin&#x27;s name, since Sethi was &quot;too notorious an offender&quot; to be use the application, Mohsin told him that she intended to publish &quot;a social chit chat thing, you know, with lots of pictures of parties and weddings&quot;. It was finally approved in 1987, but Mohsin requested a one-year delay to avoid the first issue coming out during the dictatorship of General Zia ul Haq. The paper&#x27;s first issue appeared in May 1989.

===1999 arrest===
In early 1999, Sethi gave an interview to a team for the BBC television show &quot;Correspondent&quot;, which was planning to report on corruption in the Nawaz Sharif government. At the beginning of May, he was warned by contacts that his co-operation with the team was being interpreted by the Nawaz Sharif government as an attempt to destabilize it and that officials were planning Sethi&#x27;s arrest. On 8 May, he was taken from his home by personnel of Punjab Police. According to Sethi&#x27;s wife Mohsin, at least eight armed officers broke into the house, assaulting the family&#x27;s security guards; when asked to produce a warrant, one of them threatened simply to shoot Sethi on the spot. Mohsin was tied up and left locked in another room.

Sethi was then held for almost a month without charge. He was kept incommunicado at a detention center in Lahore. Amnesty International stated its belief that his arrest was connected with his investigations into government corruption, and designated him a prisoner of conscience. The US-based Committee to Protect Journalists also sent a protest letter to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, noting the organisation&#x27;s dismay &quot;that the state continues its persecution of independent journalists&quot;, and World Bank president James Wolfensohn called Sharif to urge Sethi&#x27;s release.

On 1 June, authorities charged Sethi with &quot;Condemnation of the Creation of the State and Advocacy of Abolition of its Sovereignty&quot; and &quot;Promoting Enmity Between Different Groups&quot; and transferred him to police custody. However, the following day, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that the government had provided insufficient evidence to justify Sethi&#x27;s detention. He was released, and the charges against him were dropped.

===&quot;My Feudal Lord&quot;===
In June 1991, Mohsin and Sethi&#x27;s publishing company, Vanguard Books, released Tehmina Durrani&#x27;s &quot;My Feudal Lord&quot;, a &quot;politically explosive&quot; book about her marriage with leading politician Mustafa Khar. In the book, Durrani alleges that Khar mistreated and abused her. It was an &quot;instant sensation&quot; and later became the &quot;hottest book in Pakistan&#x27;s history&quot;. Durrani signed a contract vesting foreign rights with Mohsin and giving her 50% of foreign royalties.

On 19 May 1999, however—during Sethi&#x27;s one-month incommunicado detention—Durrani called a press conference to denounce him as having stolen all of her earnings from the book, stating that his actions were &quot;an even bigger case of hypocrisy than my experience with the feudal system&quot;. Durrani sued Sethi for mental torture, and he countersued for defamation. An earlier dispute over the foreign rights had been settled out of court in 1992. A review of the contracts by the UK newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; described Sethi as acting in good faith and described him and Mohsin as &quot;the injured party&quot;.

In 2008, when Sethi&#x27;s newspapers ran a series of editorials opposing religious fundamentalism, the Taliban threatened him with death, causing him to live under constant guard. Sethi also received death threats in July 2008 for publishing an editorial cartoon showing Umme Hassaan, principal of a girls&#x27; school, encouraging young women in burqas to &quot;kidnap Chinese masseuses&quot;. The joke referred to Lal Masjid, the fundamentalist Masjid at which her husband Abdul Aziz Ghazi was a cleric; the mosque had kidnapped six Chinese prostitutes, leading to Ghazi&#x27;s arrest.

=== Caretaker Chief Minister of Punjab ===
Najam Sethi was appointed as the caretaker Chief Minister of Punjab on 26 March 2013, for the 2013 Pakistani general election, which were scheduled to be held on 11 May 2013. His name was presented by the opposition, PPP, and the governing party, PML(N) agreed on it. He was then chosen to be the caretaker Chief Minister. On 6 June 2013, he was replaced by the newly elected leader Shehbaz Sharif. PTI, the party that lost the 2013 elections, had accused Najam Sethi of fixing the elections in 35 constituencies and famously called them the 35 punctures.

===Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board===
==== First term ====
Nawaz Sharif, the Prime minister at the time, appointed him as the acting chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board after the Islamabad High Court ordered the appointment of an interim chairman until a pending case on the serving chairman, Zaka Ashraf, was decided. Later, a two-member bench of Islamabad high court cleared Zaka Ashraf and ordered his restoration as chairman PCB. Sethi then relinquished chairmanship.

==== Second term ====
In August 2017, Sethi was elected unanimously as PCB chairman for a second time after no other member of the Board of Governors stood for the position. After Imran Khan was elected into power after the 2018 general elections, Najam Sethi resigned as Chairman of PCB. Shortly after his resignation, Imran Khan announced that former ICC President Ehsan Mani would succeed Sethi.

==== Third term ====
After Imran Khan was ousted from government through a vote of no confidence in April 2022, Sethi was appointed the Chairman of the PCB Management Committee for a third term in December 2022, along with 13 board members by the new prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif. They were given the task to restore the PCB&#x27;s 2014 constitution, whilst scrapping the 2019 constitution set under Ehsan Mani, within four months. However in April 2023, the Management Committee was given a further two-month extension.
On 20 June 2023, Najam Sethi made an announcement via twitter expressing his unwillingness to continue pursuing the Chairmanship during his third term as Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). Citing concerns over potential instability and uncertainty, Sethi decided not to be considered as a candidate for the position. He was succeeded by Zaka Ashraf as the 37th Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board on 5 July 2023.

== Personal life ==
Sethi is married to fellow journalist Jugnu Mohsin, the publisher of &quot;The Friday Times&quot;. Najam Sethi&#x27;s daughter is a journalist and actress Mira Sethi.

== Awards and recognition ==
In 1999, Sethi and Mohsin were both given the International Press Freedom Award of the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists, which recognises journalists who show courage in defending press freedom despite facing attacks, threats, or imprisonment. Ten years later, he was awarded the 2009 Golden Pen of Freedom, the annual press freedom prize of the World Association of Newspapers. Hilal-i-Imtiaz Award in 2011 by the President of Pakistan.

<doc id="994758" wikidata="Q2099609" url="?curid=994758" title="GPC (Mystery Science Theater 3000)">
<text>GPC, formerly Gypsy, is one of the fictional robot characters on the television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. She is larger and less talkative than the other robots. GPC normally only appears during the show&#x27;s host segments and introduction, but briefly took a seat in the theater to watch the movie in episode #412 (&quot;Hercules and the Captive Women&quot;). She only delivered a couple of &quot;riffs&quot; – partially because she took the movie and what the &#x27;boys&#x27; were saying too literally, and left after realizing how bad the movie was. Along with the other robots, GPC was designed and built by series creator Joel Hodgson. She was named Gypsy after a pet turtle his brother once owned, as the robot&#x27;s size and ponderousness reminded him of the turtle.

==Role==
According to the &quot;MST3K&quot; storyline, GPC takes care of the higher functions on board the &quot;Satellite of Love&quot;. She needs to use most of her computing power to handle this responsibility, which generally makes her appear slow-witted when dealing with others. The episode #207: &quot;Wild Rebels&quot; briefly demonstrated a much brighter GPC when the demand on her systems was temporarily reduced. (She also made a quick appearance in the theater during this experiment when someone mentioned &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, on account of her oft-stated fascination for the show&#x27;s star, Richard Basehart).

As the series progressed, she became a more frequent participant in the host segments, and appeared more intelligent, even attempting to sit in on an experiment during one of the Hercules films, &quot;Hercules and the Captive Women&quot;. However, she left after a few minutes when she &quot;realized there were these things&quot; she had to go take care of. GPC is a big fan of Richard Basehart; her brain was once X-rayed, and found to contain RAM chips and a photo of Basehart. She is also a notary.

GPC played a key role in the series&#x27; overall plot in episode #512, &quot;Mitchell&quot;, when she overheard the Mads discussing killing Mike Nelson, who was currently working at Gizmonic Institute as a temp, and mistakenly believed they were plotting to kill Joel. Terrified, she worked to come up with a plan to help Joel escape. Talking with Mike over the viewscreen, they were able to locate an escape pod. At the end of the episode, GPC launched Joel off the &quot;Satellite of Love&quot; in the pod, marking Joel&#x27;s departure as a regular character. The Mads then abandon their plan to kill Mike, and instead use him as the new human test subject. Mike became the regular host for the remainder of the series&#x27; original run.

In season six, the show introduced a device usually referred to as the Umbilicus, although, in some episodes, it was referred to as either the Umbilicon or the Umbiliport. The Umbilicus was a long tether that connected the &quot;Satellite of Love&quot; to the underground lair Deep 13, and allowed objects to be sent back and forth between Mike and the mad scientists who had stranded him in orbit. In its first appearance on the show, in episode #601: &quot;Girls Town&quot;, the Umbilicus was directly connected to GPC&#x27;s snake-like body, with objects being sent or received through her mouth. The receiving station was later changed to an oven-like hatch on the bridge of the &quot;Satellite of Love&quot;.

GPC also developed an independent bohemian feminist side to her personality, beginning with the &quot;Creeping Terror&quot; episode during the Mad Scientist&#x27;s &quot;coffeehouse poseur&quot; experiment, when she sang, &quot;you, the middle-class white male, are my personal oppressor!&quot; As the series progressed, she penned her own one-woman, cabaret show: &quot;Gypsy Rose Me!&quot; (a reference to burlesque performer Gypsy Rose Lee).

After the &quot;Satellite of Love&quot; crashed into the Earth in the final episode of the original run of MST3K (#1013: &quot;&quot;), GPC is not present with Mike and the Bots in their shared apartment. Tom Servo is seen reviewing a &quot;ConGypsCo Annual Report&quot;, and the guys reflect on their failure to have taken up new corporate mogul Gypsy on her public offering.

During KTMA episode #6, &quot;Gamera vs. Gaos&quot;, Joel claimed to have tried to program her voice to resemble Kim Carnes, but failed. In a sketch in episode #13, &quot;&quot;, GPC was uniquely voiced and operated by a woman (Faye Burkholder). In episode #409, &quot;The Indestructible Man&quot;, GPC swapped voices with Magic Voice in the opening host segment.

In the Season 1 premiere, GPC managed to uncoil herself, revealing that she was at least fifty feet long. Joel explained that he just kept making her longer and longer compulsively when he built her (comparing it to, &quot;When you start connecting paper clips, you get hooked on it...&quot;).

Hodgson confirmed that GPC would appear in the 2017 revival series, where she is played by Rebecca Hanson, an alum of The Second City. Hodgson reworked how GPC would be constructed and interact with the &quot;Satellite&quot; crew as to correct some of the faults he found in her appearance in the original series; while she still operates the ship, the power of cloud computing allows this responsibility to be shared among all the &#x27;bots, and she will be able to dedicate more of her computation cycles to participating in conversation, including appearing in some of the theater riffing. The new test subject host of the show, Jonah Heston, upgraded GPC with features that include her now traveling through the &quot;Satellite of Love&quot; via an overhead flyspace and speaking in a feminine Midwestern United States accent.

After the show&#x27;s 2017 return, some viewers expressed concern that the term &quot;gypsy&quot; had become widely viewed as an ethnic slur against Romani and other itinerant peoples, and so made calls for her name to be changed. Hodgson eventually did change the character&#x27;s name; as of 2019, she is called &quot;GPC&quot;.

==Behind the scenes==
Gypsy&#x27;s head was built out of a &quot;Century Infant Love Seat&quot;. Parts of an Eveready flashlight were used for her eye, the white rubber &quot;hood&quot; portion generally absent after the first couple of seasons. Foam tubing was used on her lips (usually a dull light gray), and her neck was made of a long black PVC hose. The head portion was painted a metallic purple, with a small amount of metallic blue on the inside of her mouth. Occasionally the tubing of her lips is colored red, giving the effect that she&#x27;s wearing lipstick.

During the initial KTMA season a different children&#x27;s car seat was used for the head portion, the entire puppet painted a copper color. Also during this season, her name was sometimes given as &quot;Gypsum.&quot; This Gypsy, with small alterations, would later be used for Cambot during the opening of season one episodes.

During the KTMA season, Gypsy&#x27;s voice and operation were handled by Josh Weinstein. From the first to eighth nationally telecast seasons, Gypsy was voiced and handled by Jim Mallon, who was one of the producers and writers on the show, who provides her with a high-pitched falsetto voice. Starting midway through season 8 in episode #815, Agent for H.A.R.M., the job of operating and voicing Gypsy was handed over to Patrick Brantseg, who also performed most of the puppetry during filming of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie&quot; so as to allow Jim Mallon to focus on directing rather than working the puppet. Patrick Brantseg would handle the role for the remainder of the series. 

In February 2017, it was confirmed that Gypsy would be renamed &quot;GPC&quot; and be a character on the new season. Joel Hodgson announced (via a message to the Kickstarter backers) that GPC would be voiced by Rebecca Hanson. The GPC puppet was operated by Tim Blaney.

<doc id="994767" wikidata="Q2067144" url="?curid=994767" title="Cambot">
<text>Cambot is one of the fictional robot characters on the &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; television series. It is through Cambot&#x27;s &quot;eye&quot; that viewers watch Joel Robinson (later Mike Nelson and subsequently Jonah Heston) and the other robots as they watch the movies that are sent to the &quot;Satellite of Love&quot; each week.

== Appearance ==
Cambot is only seen during the &quot;Robot Roll Call&quot; portion of the opening credits, often with his name reversed, presumably to imply he is shooting his own image in a mirror. His appearance was changed with almost every reshooting of the opening credits.

In the original KTMA season, Cambot was depicted as a robot operating a separate camera. Season 1 Cambot was a modification of the KTMA Gypsy, with an integrated camera, whereas later Cambot incarnations more closely resembled television recording equipment. In episode #507, &quot;I Accuse My Parents&quot;, Gypsy presented a drawing that depicted the &quot;Satellite of Love&quot;″s crew as her &quot;ideal family&quot;; in the drawing, Cambot&#x27;s torso was shown as a long and snakelike tube, not unlike Gypsy&#x27;s.

Midway through the fifth season of the series the opening was once again reshot, and Cambot was again redesigned, this time with a more compact shape, becoming a round hovering ball with a TV camera vidicon sensor for an eye. He would keep this form for the remainder of the series, although the color scheme was changed during MST3K&#x27;s switch from Comedy Central to the Sci Fi Channel (becoming blue instead of gray).

With the relaunch of the series with Season 11, Cambot underwent another drastic redesign, now appearing much more like a giant lens now with mock studio lighting camera reflectors. He appears to be attached to the ceiling by some kind of long mount.

== Overview ==

Cambot acts as an audio-visual conduit between the crew of the &quot;Satellite of Love&quot; and their observers. He also joins Joel, Mike, Crow T. Robot, and Tom Servo in the theatre when a movie is shown, and records the cast watching the film. Although a number of episodes depict the cast reacting as if traumatized by a particularly bad movie, Cambot suffered a severe reaction only once, weeping when several security cameras were systematically destroyed by the hero in episode #620: &quot;Danger!! Death Ray&quot;. (This was signified by a watery effect over the screen image). Another rare case of Cambot interacting during a movie segment came in episode #202: &quot;The Sidehackers&quot;, when Cambot added a mock ESPN scorecard on one side of the screen during the movie&#x27;s race scenes.

Cambot also frequently provides music, video clips, and other enhancements to host segments. When Joel or another character requests to see through &quot;Rocket Number Nine&quot; (the ship-mounted camera that allows the crew to see the ship&#x27;s exterior and anything in its vicinity), it is Cambot who provides the image. During the first seven seasons, when Joel or Mike would read fan mail sent to the show, they would request Cambot to put the letter on &quot;still store,&quot; freeze framing on a close-up of the letter.

Cambot was voiced a single time during the original KTMA run by Kevin Murphy.

At the end of Season 7, Cambot was shown joining his fellow crew-members ascending into pure energy at the end of the universe. When the &quot;Satellite of Love&quot; crashed on Earth in the show&#x27;s final episode, it is not specified whether Cambot survived the crash (although one could assume that he is the one filming the final scene). Cambot was not mentioned in &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie&quot;. Cambot is revealed to have survived the crash in the Netflix revival of the series.

<doc id="994777" wikidata="Q7996940" url="?curid=994777" title="Whittman-Hart">
<text>Whittman-Hart was a services company dealing with digital communications. Founded in 1984, it grew steadily until 1999, when it acquired US Web/CKS, more than doubling its size. The combined company was re-corporated on March 1, 2000, with the new name of marchFIRST, inc. In May 2001, marchFIRST, which had declared bankruptcy a month earlier, was liquidated.

== Early history ==
Founded in 1984 by Bob Bernard, Bill Merchantz, Rich Colson, and Bill Topol in the Chicago area, the company initially specialized in IBM AS/400 IT consulting. In 1990 the company split, with Merchantz leaving with the software side of the company, and Bernard in charge of the consulting business, which then had revenues of $9 million a year.

The company grew steadily, for about 15 years, including some acquisitions, and went public in 1996. In 1997, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine named it one of the fastest-growing companies in the US.

For the nine months ended September 30, 1999, the company reported net income of $21.3 million, or 35 cents a share, on revenue of $342.7 million.

In November 1999 the company acquired Fulcrum Solutions Ltd, a UK-based Oracle technology specialist. At that time, Whittman-Hart had approximately 3,900 employees in 22 branch offices throughout the United States and the United Kingdom.

== Merger with USWeb/CKS ==
In December 1999, the company announced that it would acquire USWeb/CKS, a California-based web consulting firm, for $5.7 billion in company stock. Although announced as an acquisition, USWeb shareholders would own 57% of the merged company after exchanging their shares for shares of Whittman-Hart, making the deal somewhat close to a merger.

The new company, which changed its name to MarchFIRST Inc., on March 1, 2000, had 9,000 employees around the world, including about 1,500 in the Chicago area; about 8,000 were in the U.S. It was the world&#x27;s largest Internet services company, with annual sales of about $500 million. Robert Shaw, the CEO at USWeb/CKS, became the company&#x27;s chairman while Bernard continued as CEO in the now larger company. marchFIRST was traded on the Nasdaq; its peak stock price was around $52.

As the dot-com boom ended, MarchFIRST&#x27;s fortunes began dropping quickly along with the high-tech Internet sector. In October 2000, its stock dropped nearly 60 percent after the reported reported a third-quarter loss of $437 million, compared with a profit of $9 million, a year earlier, and that sales were $369 million, 20 percent less than the prior quarter.

In November 2000, Bernard announced that the company would focus on more traditional companies, helping with building e-commerce operations, and would drop more than 1,000 clients, concentrating on 500 of its best customers .

In December 2000, Francisco Partners LP, a private equity firm, agreed to invest $150 million in the company in exchange for preferred stock, which, when converted, would equal a 32 percent share of the company.

On February 13, 2001, the company missed earnings expectations again and its stock price fell another 35%. On March 13, 2001, Bernard, the chairman and chief executive, resigned, along with Chief Operating Officer Thomas Metz and Joseph Bong, executive vice president of client services. At that point, the company had laid off 1,500 employees in the prior four months.

By March 28, the company stock was trading for $0.16 per share. On April 2, the company announced 1,700 layoffs.

On April 13, 2001, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On May 1, 2001, the company filed for a liquidation under Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code.

The company sold most of its assets to Divine for $120 million; that company went bankrupt in 2003. Former management, including Bernard, also acquired some assets of the company. SBI, a professional services company based in Salt Lake City, acquired additional assets of the company in June 2001. marchFIRST Norway was acquired by Itera ASA in July 2001.

== Post-bankruptcy ==
While the company&#x27;s assets were liquidated in the middle of 2001, its remaining corporate shell remained mired in bankruptcy proceedings for the next two years.

In mid-2003, Bernard launched a slimmed-down Internet technology consulting company. The new firm, operating in five Midwestern cities including Chicago, reincarnated the well-known WhittmanHart name (minus the hyphen).

In 2005–2006 WhittmanHart acquired numerous organizations, including Ohio-based Infinis Inc, Philadelphia-based Insight Interactive Group Inc, Maryland-based Estco.net, LLC, Chicago-based Vision Enterprises, and Los Angeles-based DNA Studio. Bernard died in February 2007.

On July 29, 2008, Rolta acquired the consulting division of WhittmanHart Inc. On September 28, 2010, WhittmanHart, Inc. was rebranded as Band Digital, Inc.

<text>Theresa Sokyrka (born 1 April 1981) is a Canadian singer-songwriter. On the second season of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;, she was the final runner-up to winner Kalan Porter.

==Biography==
Born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Sokyrka studied music at Red Deer College in Red Deer, Alberta. She is drawn to the blues and jazz more than other musical genres, and sings with passion and vulnerability. She loves to scat, adding flare and style to her songs. During an &quot;Idol&quot; taping, Lionel Richie said there was &quot;the soul of an old black woman living inside her&quot;. She comes from a very musical family, and she plays the violin, guitar, and piano.

She was Saskatchewan Centennial 2005 Youth Ambassador.

Sokyrka currently lives in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Her 2013 album,&quot;Prairie Winds&quot; was recorded, mixed and mastered in Madrid, Spain in two weeks.

==&quot;Canadian Idol&quot;==
On the second season of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;, Sokyrka was known for scatting during her songs, the grace she showed during the judges&#x27; critiques, and her friendly personality. Zack Werner once said she was his favourite singer on the show from the first two seasons. A memorable comment made about Sokyrka came from judge Jake Gold; he said &quot;Your future is so bright, I&#x27;ve got to wear shades&quot; as he put on his sunglasses. Kalan Porter said it was great ending the show with Theresa, and that she had something really special to offer. The duet they performed during the finale, &quot;True Colors&quot;, was arguably one of the most touching moments in Canadian Idol history.

Songs that Theresa performed during the season included:
Her standout songs on the show were &quot;Summertime&quot;, &quot;Good Mother&quot;, &quot;Song For A Winter&#x27;s Night&quot;, &quot;Cruisin&quot;, &quot;Ready for Love&quot;, and &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;.

<text>Spitak (), is a town and urban municipal community in the northern Lori Province of Armenia. It is north of the capital, Yerevan, and west of the provincial center, Vanadzor. Spitak was entirely destroyed during the devastating 1988 earthquake, and it was rebuilt in a slightly different location. Currently, the town has an approximate population of 11,000 as per the 2016 official estimate.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Spitak&quot;, meaning &quot;white&quot; in Armenian because of the presence of white limestone rocks in the area. The word &quot;spitak&quot; itself derives from Middle Persian &quot;spēdag&quot; (compare Parthian &quot;ispēd&quot;).

== History ==
The area of modern-day Spitak was probably inhabited since the 4th millennium BC, based on ancient settlements found on the surrounding hills. Many remnants are found on the &quot;Sardar hill&quot; dating back to the Bronze Age. Later, the region was included within the kingdom of Urartu during the 7th century BC. Between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC, the region was part of the Orontid Armenia, followed by the Artaxiad ruled in 189 BC. The region was included within the Tashir () canton of the historic Gugark province, the 13th province of Greater Armenia.

In the 9th century, the territory of Tashir became part of the newly founded Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia in 885. With the establishment of the Kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget 979 under the protectorate of the Bagratids, the region of Tashir became part of the kingdom ruled by the Kiurikians until its dissolution in 1118.

After a brief Byzantine rule over Armenia between 1045 and 1064, the invading Seljuks ruled over the entire region, including Tashir. However, with the establishment of the Zakarid Principality of Armenia in 1201 under the Georgian protectorate, the Eastern Armenian territories including Gugark had significantly grown. After the Mongols captured Ani in 1236, Tashir became part of the Ilkhanate as a Mongol protectorate, and the Zakarids became vassals to the Mongols. After the fall of the Ilkhanate in the mid-14th century, the Zakarid princes ruled over Tashir until 1360 when they fell to the invading Turkic tribes.

In 1501, most of the Eastern Armenian territories including Tashir were occupied by Safavid Iran. In mid 17th century, the small village &quot;Hamamlu&quot; was founded in the historic region of Tashir, within the newly formed administrative territory of Erivan Khanate under the Afsharid dynasty of Iran. The first residents of the village were Armenian migrants from the Iranian town of Khoy.

In 1828, the Erivan Khanate -including Hamamlu- was annexed by the Russian Empire. The region became officially part of the Russian Empire at the Treaty of Turkmenchay signed on 10 February 1828 between Imperial Russia and Qajar Persia. Hamamlu became part of the &quot;Alexandropol uyezd&quot; within the Erivan Governorate of the Russian Empire.

In November 1918, Hamamlu was included within the newly formed Republic of Armenia. Following the Sovietization of Armenia in December 1920, Hamamlu was finally incorporated into Soviet Armenia on 11 February 1921.
In 1937 the &quot;Hamamlu raion&quot; was established, with the village of Hamamlu as the centre of the newly formed administrative region. The dairy products factory of 1937 was the 1st industrial firm opened in Hamamlu under the Soviet rule, followed by the sugar plant in 1947. In 1949, &quot;Hamamlu&quot; was renamed &quot;Spitak&quot; along with its &quot;raion&quot;. In 1960, Spitak received the status of a town. In 1971, it became a town of republican subordination

The 1st urban development plan of the town was introduced in 1965 by architect A. Harutyanyan, followed by the 2nd plan in 1974 composed by architects K. Ghazaryan and H. Mirzakhanyan. Many large factories were opened in Spitak, mainly for knitwear and dairy products. In 1980, a new urban plan was approved and the sports complex of the town was opened later in 1983.

During the 1988 earthquake, Spitak was entirely destroyed and 1/3 of the town&#x27;s 15,000 population were killed, while the rest became homeless. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Spitak was gradually rebuilt through the efforts of the state government as well as the Armenian diaspora, with the assistance of many countries, including Uzbekistan, Switzerland, Russia, Austria, Finland, Norway, Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, Estonia and the United Kingdom.

==Geography==

The church of Holy Resurrection opened in 2001 is the town&#x27;s church.

At the beginning of the 19th century, many Armenian migrants from Khoy and Muş who were resettled in the town. In December 1988, around 4,000 people were killed in Spitak as a result of the devastating earthquake. Upon the breakout of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1988, around 500 Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan were resettled in Spitak.

== Culture ==

Spitak has a cultural house, 3 public libraries, many cinema theatres, a municipal theater, and an ethnographic museum.

The cultural heritage of the town includes an archaeological site from the 2nd millennium BC, the ruins of an ancient settlement on the nearby Sardar hill from the 1st millennium BC, as well as a bridge on the Pambak river dating back to the 19th century.

The &quot;Spitak day&quot; is celebrated every year on July the 15th.

The town is also home to the Spitak railway station, almost midway between Yerevan and Tbilisi.

== Economy ==
Under the Soviet rule, Spitak became a major industrial hub in northern Armenia. The Spitak dairy factory was opened in 1937, while the sugar factory was opened in 1947. However, after the earthquake, the town lost its significance as an industrial centre in Lori.

The town has a flour mill and a building materials manufacturing plant.

<text>Before being shut down in 2000 by the Iranian Judiciary System, Payam-e Emrooz was the most professional monthly magazine with news and analyses in the areas of politics, society, culture, and economy. The magazine was headquartered in Tehran. Its existence was a symbol of the &quot;freedom of press&quot; in a country with its own specific political system. The magazine had considerable number of advertisements by foreign companies and institutes and a large number of Iranian students, intellectuals, and middle-class people (in addition to state officials) among its readers. Mohammad Zahedi-Asl was the license-holder and the responsible manager, and Amid Naeini was the editor in chief of the magazine. &quot;The Exclusive Report&quot; was one of the most popular and informative parts of each edition. It was a literary account of the most important political happenings during the previous month written by Massoud Behnoud, a pioneer of literary writing in modern Iranian journalism. Having been close to some officials and having had first-hand information on some occasions plus unique photojournalism, had made &quot;The Exclusive Report&quot; an exceptionally popular section of the magazine.

<doc id="994796" wikidata="Q3547390" url="?curid=994796" title="USS Delaware (1798)">
<text>The second USS &quot;Delaware&quot; was a ship which served in the United States Navy during Quasi-War with France.

The &quot;USS Delaware&quot; was designed by naval architect William Doughty and built in the Philadelphia Naval Yard in 1794 as the merchant ship &quot;Hamburgh Packet&quot;. The Navy purchased her on May 5, 1798. Captain Stephen Decatur, Sr., was appointed to command and outfit her for sea.

During the Quasi-War with France, &quot;Delaware&quot; cruised to protect American merchant shipping from French privateers. She guarded convoys during their approach to Philadelphia and New York, patrolled the West Indies, and escorted convoys into Havana.

Her first prize, the privateer &quot;La Croyable&quot;, was taken off Great Egg Harbor July 7, 1798. &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; (&quot;LL&quot;) reported on 17 August that the American sloop-of-war &quot;Delaware&quot; had captured a French privateer of the American coast. The privateer had captured the merchantman &quot;Liberty&quot;, Vredenburg, master, which had been sailing from Philadelphia to Liverpool. &quot;Liberty&quot; had since been recaptured.

From 14 July to 23 September, she cruised in the West Indies, often in company with the frigate , and together the ships took two privateers prize. During her second cruise in the West Indies, between December 15, 1798 and May 20, 1799, she took another prize, privateer &quot;Marsouin&quot; on 5 March 1799 off Havana and won the thanks of the merchants of Havana for the protection she had given merchantmen sailing to that port. She headed home and was off Fort Mifflin by 23 May, 1799.

Between cruises Capt. Thomas Baker became her captain &amp; a new crew was recruited.

&quot;Delaware&quot;&#x27;s return to the West Indies from July 1799 to July 1800 found her joining the Revenue Cutter in taking a privateer sloop. Sometime in October she and USS Pickering recaptured brig &quot;Henrich&quot;. She took privateer brig &quot;Ocean&quot; on October 29, 1799, off Curaçao after a 7-hour chase, rescuing 30 Americans held prisoner in the privateer. Due to Capt. Baker&#x27;s health, he was replaced at the end of July 1800 by Master Commander J. A. Spotswood. She made a final cruise off Cuba in the late fall and winter of 1800-1801, then returned to Baltimore. In a letter dated 20 February 1801 to Josiah Parker, Chaiman of the Committee on Naval Affairs, Navy Secretary Stoddert recommended selling her. She was sold at Baltimore for $23,799.28 early in June 1801.

<doc id="994798" wikidata="Q238636" url="?curid=994798" title="Fifth Army (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Fifth Army was a field army of the British Army during World War I that formed part of the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front between 1916 and 1918. The army originated as the Reserve Corps during the preparations for the British part of the Somme Offensive of 1916, was renamed Reserve Army when it was expanded and became the Fifth Army in October 1916.

==History==
The Fifth Army was created on 30 October 1916, by renaming the Reserve Army (General Hubert Gough). It participated in the Battle of the Ancre, which became the final British effort in the Battle of the Somme.

In 1917,the Fifth Army was involved in the Battle of Arras and then the Third Battle of Ypres. The following year, the Fifth Army took over a stretch of front-line previously occupied by the French south of the River Somme and on 21 March, bore the brunt of the opening phase of the German Spring Offensive, known as Operation Michael. The failure of the Fifth Army to withstand the German advance led to Gough&#x27;s dismissal and replacement by General Henry Rawlinson on 28 March and on 2 April, the army was renamed the Fourth Army. Gough and his remaining staff officers were to be renamed the Reserve Army with a headquarters at Crécy-en-Ponthieu, to survey a defensive line west of Amiens as a precaution and to oversee the building of all GHQ lines. After Gough was removed and sent home, General William Peyton took over the HQ until 23 May, when the Reserve Army title was dropped and the Fifth Army HQ was re-formed, under the command of General William Birdwood. Although the Fifth Army was blamed for failing to hold the German advance, it was later &quot;triumphantly vindicated&quot;.

===Commanders===
* October 1916 – March 1918 General Sir Hubert Gough
* April–May 1918 General Sir William Peyton
* May–November 1918 General Sir William Birdwood

==Second World War==

The army was not reraised during the Second World War. However, due to various Allied deception efforts, German intelligence over-estimated the number of Allied forces based within the UK by the start of 1944. While there was no specific deception effort to create the Third Army, German intelligence believed that one had been formed from Eastern Command.

<text>Titanium tetrachloride is the inorganic compound with the formula . It is an important intermediate in the production of titanium metal and the pigment titanium dioxide. is a volatile liquid. Upon contact with humid air, it forms thick clouds of titanium dioxide () and hydrochloric acid, a reaction that was formerly exploited for use in smoke machines. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;tickle&quot; or &quot;tickle 4&quot;, as a phonetic representation of the symbols of its molecular formula ().

==Properties and structure==
 is a dense, colourless liquid, although crude samples may be yellow or even red-brown. It is one of the rare transition metal halides that is a liquid at room temperature,  being another example. This property reflects the fact that molecules of weakly self-associate. Most metal chlorides are polymers, wherein the chloride atoms bridge between the metals. Its melting point is similar to that of .

 has a &quot;closed&quot; electronic shell, with the same number of electrons as the noble gas argon. The tetrahedral structure for is consistent with its description as a d0 metal center () surrounded by four identical ligands. This configuration leads to highly symmetrical structures, hence the tetrahedral shape of the molecule. adopts similar structures to  and ; the three compounds share many similarities. and react to give mixed halides , where &quot;x&quot; = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Magnetic resonance measurements also indicate that halide exchange is also rapid between and .

 is soluble in toluene and chlorocarbons. Certain arenes form complexes of the type . reacts exothermically with donor solvents such as THF to give hexacoordinated adducts. Bulkier ligands (L) give pentacoordinated adducts .

==Production==
 is produced by the chloride process, which involves the reduction of titanium oxide ores, typically ilmenite (), with carbon under flowing chlorine at 900 °C. Impurities are removed by distillation.

The coproduction of  is undesirable, which has motivated the development of alternative technologies. Instead of directly using ilmenite, &quot;rutile slag&quot; is used. This material, an impure form of , is derived from ilmenite by removal of iron, either using carbon reduction or extraction with sulfuric acid. Crude contains a variety of other volatile halides, including vanadyl chloride (), silicon tetrachloride (), and tin tetrachloride (), which must be separated.

==Applications==

===Production of titanium metal===
The world&#x27;s supply of titanium metal, about 250,000 tons per year, is made from . The conversion involves the reduction of the tetrachloride with magnesium metal. This procedure is known as the Kroll process:

In the Hunter process, liquid sodium is the reducing agent instead of magnesium.

===Production of titanium dioxide===
Around 90% of the production is used to make the pigment titanium dioxide (). The conversion involves hydrolysis of , a process that forms hydrogen chloride:

In some cases, is oxidised directly with oxygen:

===Smoke screens===
It has been used to produce smoke screens since it produces a heavy, white smoke that has little tendency to rise. &quot;Tickle&quot; was the standard means of producing on-set smoke effects for motion pictures, before being phased out in the 1980s due to concerns about hydrated HCl&#x27;s effects on the respiratory system.

==Chemical reactions==
Titanium tetrachloride is a versatile reagent that forms diverse derivatives including those illustrated below.

===Alcoholysis and related reactions===
A characteristic reaction of is its easy hydrolysis, signaled by the release of HCl vapors and titanium oxides and oxychlorides. Titanium tetrachloride has been used to create naval smokescreens, as the hydrochloric acid aerosol and titanium dioxide that is formed scatter light very efficiently. This smoke is corrosive, however.

Alcohols react with to give alkoxides with the formula (R = alkyl, &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 4). As indicated by their formula, these alkoxides can adopt complex structures ranging from monomers to tetramers. Such compounds are useful in materials science as well as organic synthesis. A well known derivative is titanium isopropoxide, which is a monomer. Titanium bis(acetylacetonate)dichloride results from treatment of titanium tetrachloride with excess acetylacetone:

Organic amines react with to give complexes containing amido (-containing) and imido (-containing) complexes. With ammonia, titanium nitride is formed. An illustrative reaction is the synthesis of tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium , a yellow, benzene-soluble liquid: This molecule is tetrahedral, with planar nitrogen centers.

===Complexes with simple ligands===
 is a Lewis acid as implicated by its tendency to hydrolyze. With the ether THF, reacts to give yellow crystals of . With chloride salts, reacts to form sequentially , (see figure above), and . The reaction of chloride ions with depends on the counterion. and gives the pentacoordinate complex , whereas smaller gives . These reactions highlight the influence of electrostatics on the structures of compounds with highly ionic bonding.

===Redox===
Reduction of with aluminium results in one-electron reduction. The trichloride () and tetrachloride have contrasting properties: the trichloride is a colored solid, being a coordination polymer, and is paramagnetic. When the reduction is conducted in THF solution, the Ti(III) product converts to the light-blue adduct .

===Organometallic chemistry===

The organometallic chemistry of titanium typically starts from . An important reaction involves sodium cyclopentadienyl to give titanocene dichloride, . This compound and many of its derivatives are precursors to Ziegler–Natta catalysts. Tebbe&#x27;s reagent, useful in organic chemistry, is an aluminium-containing derivative of titanocene that arises from the reaction of titanocene dichloride with trimethylaluminium. It is used for the &quot;olefination&quot; reactions.

Arenes, such as react to give the piano-stool complexes (R = H, ; see figure above). This reaction illustrates the high Lewis acidity of the entity, which is generated by abstraction of chloride from by .

===Reagent in organic synthesis===
 finds occasional use in organic synthesis, capitalizing on its Lewis acidity, its oxophilicity, and the electron-transfer properties of its reduced titanium halides. It is used in the Lewis acid catalysed aldol addition Key to this application is the tendency of to activate aldehydes (RCHO) by formation of adducts such as .

==Toxicity and safety considerations==
Hazards posed by titanium tetrachloride generally arise from its reaction with water that releases hydrochloric acid, which is severely corrosive itself and whose vapors are also extremely irritating. is a strong Lewis acid, which exothermically forms adducts with even weak bases such as THF and water.
