<text>John Frederick Bond (17 December 1932 – 25 September 2012) was an English professional football player and manager. He played from 1950 until 1966 for West Ham United, making 444 appearances in all competitions and scoring 37 goals. He was a member of the West Ham side which won the 1957–58 Second Division and the 1964 FA Cup. He also played for Torquay United until 1969. He managed seven different Football League clubs, and was the manager of the Norwich City side which made the 1975 Football League Cup Final and the Manchester City side which made the 1981 FA Cup Final. He is the father of Kevin Bond, a former footballer and coach.

==Playing career==

Bond was born in Dedham, Essex. He played for North-East Essex Schools and Essex Army cadets before joining West Ham United in March 1950 from Colchester Casuals, his league debut coming two seasons later in a 2–1 away win against Coventry City. Bond had been spotted playing by West Ham assistant-manager Ted Fenton when he was manager with Colchester United. He had convinced manager Charlie Paynter to offer Bond a contract and Bond turned professional in March 1950. His ability as a goal-scoring right-back soon resulted in him gaining a regular place in the Hammers side, his partnership with Noel Cantwell proving particularly useful. As West Ham won the Second Division title in 1957–58, Bond missed only one game, and scored eight goals. At this time he was also selected for the England &#x27;A&#x27; side. A popular favourite of the fans at Upton Park, he was usually referred to as &#x27;Muffin&#x27; because of his ability to kick like a mule. In 1959, he was tried as a centre forward, scoring twice in one game against Bolton Wanderers and a hat-trick against Chelsea in February 1960.

By 1963, Bond was in competition for the right-back position with Joe Kirkup, but was picked for the 1964 FA Cup Final win at Wembley towards the end of his Upton Park career, but missed out on the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final victory the following season, despite playing four times in the earlier rounds of the competition. He played his final match for the club on 17 April 1965, a 1–0 away defeat to Leicester City. He played 381 league games for the Hammers, in which he scored 32 times. In January 1966, Bond left to join Torquay United, then managed by his former West Ham teammate Frank O&#x27;Farrell, on a free transfer. He was awarded a testimonial at West Ham in May 1966, but was unable to play due to a groin injury.

He played 130 league games for the Gulls, scoring 12 goals, and helped Torquay to promotion at the end of his first season. He retired in 1969, having already opened a sweet shop (Bondy&#x27;s Tuck Shop) in the Torre area of Torquay.

==Coaching and managerial career==
Bond&#x27;s coaching career began when he joined the staff at Gillingham (having been turned down on applying for the manager&#x27;s job at Torquay United), and in May 1970 he replaced Freddie Cox as manager of Bournemouth &amp; Boscombe Athletic. He is usually credited with the change of club name to its current name of AFC Bournemouth. Bond led the club to promotion as Fourth Division runners-up at the end of his first season, and almost to promotion again the following season, as Bournemouth finished third in the Third Division. His son Kevin has also managed Bournemouth.

===Norwich City===
His successes at Bournemouth led to him being appointed Norwich City manager in November 1973, replacing Ron Saunders. This followed a period of negotiations between the two clubs, Norwich eventually paying £10,000 in compensation for the acquisition of Bond and his chief coach Ken Brown. Bond continued his successes at Norwich, signing players such as Martin Peters, Ted MacDougall and Phil Boyer.

The end of the 1973–74 season saw Norwich relegated in last place, but the following season he guided them back to the top flight at the first attempt, and also to the League Cup Final, which they lost 1–0 to Aston Villa at Wembley. He then managed to keep Norwich in the top flight, despite the financial constraints he was under, until resigning to manage Manchester City in October 1980, taking his assistants John Benson and John Sainty with him.

===Manchester City===
City had made a very poor start to the 1980–81 season when he took over, costing Malcolm Allison his job. Bond galvanised the side by signing experienced reinforcements to complement promising youngsters at the club, oversaw an upturn in results which saw City finish in a more respectable mid-table position, whilst the following season saw a 10th-place finish and was highlighted by a 3–1 win over Liverpool at Anfield.

The end of his first season in charge at Maine Road saw Bond lead City out at Wembley for the FA Cup Final against Tottenham Hotspur, which they lost 3–2 in the replay game, made famous by Ricky Villa&#x27;s goal (the game also featured a volley by City&#x27;s Steve MacKenzie). Bond resigned from City in February 1983, with the side ninth in the table. Thereafter, under John Benson, City plummeted towards the relegation zone and were relegated on the final day.

During their FA Cup run, Bond guided Manchester City to a 6–0 win over former club Norwich City at Maine Road in the fourth round. At the end of this thrilling game, Bond jumped from an upper tier of the stand into the players&#x27; tunnel, in order that he could offer his commiserations to son Kevin, who was playing for Norwich. An act which Danny Baker describes as &quot;attempted a little James Bond&quot; in the &quot;Match of the Eighties&quot; nostalgia TV show 16 years later.

===Burnley and beyond===
In June 1983, Bond took over at Burnley, newly relegated to Division Three and with high expectations of going straight back up. He brought in some of his previous players from Manchester City, selling players such as Trevor Steven, Lee Dixon and Brian Laws, the previous season&#x27;s player of the year, who were all destined for greater things. He was not well liked amongst the fans and left in August 1984 after Burnley had finished 12th.
In December 1984 he was appointed manager of Swansea City who were struggling to avoid being relegated from the First to Fourth Divisions in successive seasons. He immediately released some of the younger players (most notably Dean Saunders) to bring in some older heads. They ended the season just one place clear of relegation, but the following season started badly and with the Swans on the brink of bankruptcy, Bond left on 20 December 1985 and Swansea were relegated at the end of the season to complete their demise since the John Toshack era.

On 22 January 1986, Bond was appointed manager of Birmingham City and failed to prevent their relegation from Division One, seven consecutive defeats at the end of the season sealing their fate. The following season, Birmingham struggled again, eventually finishing just one place away from relegation to Division Three. This was not good enough for the Birmingham board and Bond was sacked on 27 May 1987.

He was appointed assistant manager to Asa Hartford at Shrewsbury Town in January 1990, and a year later, in January 1991, was appointed manager after Hartford&#x27;s dismissal. At the end of the 1990–91 season, Shrewsbury narrowly avoided relegation from the Third Division, but the following season, Bond failed to keep them up, and Shrewsbury were relegated back to the bottom flight (by now renamed Division Three by the Premier League shake-up). When Shrewsbury went to Burnley Bond was advised by the police not to attend. The following season saw Shrewsbury finish ninth, and at the end of July 1993, Bond resigned, along with the Shrewsbury chairman.

==Managerial statistics==
==After management==
He assisted his son Kevin, who was manager at Stafford Rangers, mainly in a scouting capacity. In August 1998, Bond was appointed manager at Witton Albion, whose Manager had been sacked just days before the start of the new season, Bond was appointed first on an interim basis, before talking over for the rest of the season in November 1998 and they eventually finished in a healthy eighth place in the Northern Premier League First Division. In September 1999, Bond, by now nearing his 67th birthday, was brought out of retirement by Wigan Athletic manager John Benson to assist with coaching and scouting in a consultancy position. He left Wigan after less than 12 months following Benson&#x27;s move to the role of director of football.

In November 2009, he appeared on the Sky Sports programme &quot;Time of Our Lives&quot;, where he, along with Ken Brown, Ronnie Boyce and presenter Jeff Stelling looked back on their era at West Ham. This programme was repeated on the day after his death in memory of him.

Bond died on 25 September 2012 aged 79.

<text>Tamang (; Devanagari: तामाङ; &quot;tāmāṅ&quot;), are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group of Nepal, Southern Bhutan and North-east India. The Nepalese Tamang people constituted 5.6% of the population at over 1.3 million in 2001, increasing to 1,539,830 in the 2011 census; the 2021 census reported 1,639,866 Tamangs. 
The Nepali Tamangs are concentrated in the central hilly and Himalayan regions of Nepal. Indian Tamangs live in the state of Sikkim and in the districts of Darjeeling and Kalimpong in West Bengal and Assam states. Bhutanese Tamangs live in various districts in the southern foothills of Bhutan, including Tsirang District, Dagana District, Samtse District, Chukha District, Sarpang District and Samdrup Jongkhar District. Tamang language is the fifth most-spoken language in Nepal.

== History ==
Historical accounts show that the Tamang ethnic group originated in Tibet. The word in the Classical Tibetan means &#x27;horse&#x27;, and means &#x27;warriors&#x27;; hence, their original way of life evolved around horses. The Tamangs, who have lived on hills outside the Kathmandu Valley to the southern slopes of Langtang, Ganesh, Jugal Himal and Rolwaling probably since prehistoric times, have been mentioned in various Nepalese and colonial historical records under a variety of names, such as Bhote, Lama, Murmi and Sain, some of which terms erroneously conflate the Tamangs with Uighurs. The Tibetans called them &quot;Rongpa&quot;.

Various Gorkha rulers led campaigns against the indigenous Tamangs. The Gorkha Vamsavali provides details of battles with the &quot;Bhotyas&quot; of a variety of principalities between 1806 and 1862. In 1739, a ruler named Ghale-Botya attacked Narabhupal Shah as he was marching towards Nuwakot, and Narabhupal Shah also fought several battles against Golma Ghale (Gyalpo). In 1762, Prithvi Narayan Shah attacked the Tamangs in Temal, the Tamang cultural heartland. Tamang oral history says that the local chief, Rinjen Dorje, was killed by the Gorkhas. Gorkhali forces had hidden their weapons in the sand on the Sunkoshi riverbank in order to attack the Tamang forces. Afterwards, the Gorkhas washed their weapons in springs at Dapcha Kuwapani, and this is why the modern-day Tamangs do not drink there. Similar stories appear in oral histories throughout the region.

After the attack on the Tamang region, their traditional homeland area, known as &quot;kipat&quot; to the Gorkhas, was granted to Gorkha generals or government officials who had pleased the king in some way, displacing the Tamangs from &quot;kipat&quot; lands. Previously, Tamang landholdings had been divided up by clan. Tamangs also had various forced labor obligations, both in times of peace and war, that differed significantly from other regions of Nepal. One reason is the proximity of the Tamang homeland to the center of royal administration at Kathmandu.

Tamangs were also involved in the Sino-Nepalese War (1788 to 1792). (Nepali: नेपाल-चीन युद्ध), also known as the Sino-Gorkha war and in Chinese the Campaign of Gorkha (Chinese: 廓爾喀之役).The war was initially fought between Nepalese Gorkhas and Tibetan armies over a trade dispute related to a long-standing problem of low-quality coins manufactured by Nepal for Tibet. A few hundred eventually settled in Tibet; they are known as Daman people in China. Previously stateless, since 2003 the Chinese government has classified them as ethnic Tibetans.

Research indicates that the Tamang are a hybrid population with genetic contributions from both Tibetan and Nepalese ancestries. One study estimates the admixture proportions to be approximately 59% Tibetan and 41% Nepalese.

== Culture ==
Tamang tradition and culture include a distinct language, culture, dress, and social structure. They have over 100 sub-clans. About 87 % of the Tamang people are Buddhist and around 3% are Christians and 8% are Hindu. Their language, Tamang, comes from Tamangic branch of the Tibeto-Burman language family, and is closely related to Gurung. They follow the Chinese lunar calendar of the 12-year cycle. Colorful printed Buddhist mantra cloths are put up in various places in villages and towns.

Their typical song and dance style is known as Tamang Selo, and includes songs representing humor, satire, joy and sorrow. It has a brisk movement and rhythmic beat specific to the Tamangs. A distinctive musical instrument is the damphu, a small, round drum covered with goatskin. Traditional Tamang songs are known as Hwai. Sung by Tamang genealogists callTamba, Hwai songs are ritualistic and hold tremendous importance in Tamang rituals.
===Festivals===
Sonam Lhosar is the main festival of the Tamangs and is celebrated in the month of Magh (February–March). It is celebrated to welcome the Tamang new year.

Another significant festival is the Saga Dawa, a religious festival based on birthday of Gautam Buddha. 

== Language ==
Tamang is a Sino-Tibetan language spoken predominantly in Nepal, with significant communities in Sikkim and West Bengal, India. It encompasses several dialects, including Eastern, Western, Southwestern, Northwestern, and Eastern Gorkha Tamang, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility. For instance, Eastern and Western Tamang are mutually unintelligible.  The language employs both the Tamyig script, similar to Tibetan, and Devanagari for writing. Grammatically, Tamang follows a subject-object-verb (SOV) order and utilizes postpositions.  It is tonal and exhibits ergative-absolutive alignment.  Despite being the fifth most spoken language in Nepal,  Tamang faces challenges due to the dominance of Nepali, leading to concerns about language preservation. 

==Distribution of Tamang in Nepal==

The 2011 Nepal census classifies the Tamang people within the broader social group of Mountain–Hill Janajati. At the time of the Nepal census of 2011, 1,539,830 people (5.8% of the population of Nepal) were Tamang. The percentage of Tamang people by province was as follows:

* Gandaki Province (2.1%)
* Karnali Province (0.8%)

<text>In mathematics and mathematical optimization, the convex conjugate of a function is a generalization of the Legendre transformation which applies to non-convex functions. It is also known as Legendre–Fenchel transformation, Fenchel transformation, or Fenchel conjugate (after Adrien-Marie Legendre and Werner Fenchel). The convex conjugate is widely used for constructing the dual problem in optimization theory, thus generalizing Lagrangian duality.

== Definition ==

Let formula_1 be a real topological vector space and let formula_2 be the dual space to formula_1. Denote by 

:formula_4

the canonical dual pairing, which is defined by formula_5 

For a function formula_6 taking values on the extended real number line, its is the function

:formula_7

whose value at formula_8 is defined to be the supremum:

:formula_9

or, equivalently, in terms of the infimum:

:formula_10

This definition can be interpreted as an encoding of the convex hull of the function&#x27;s epigraph in terms of its supporting hyperplanes.

== Examples ==
For more examples, see .
* The convex conjugate of an affine function formula_11 is formula_12
* The convex conjugate of a power function formula_13 is formula_14
* The convex conjugate of the absolute value function formula_15 is formula_16
* The convex conjugate of the exponential function formula_17 is formula_18

The convex conjugate and Legendre transform of the exponential function agree except that the domain of the convex conjugate is strictly larger as the Legendre transform is only defined for positive real numbers.

===Connection with expected shortfall (average value at risk)===

See this article for example.

Let &quot;F&quot; denote a cumulative distribution function of a random variable &quot;X&quot;. Then (integrating by parts),
formula_19
has the convex conjugate
formula_20

=== Ordering ===
A particular interpretation has the transform
formula_21
as this is a nondecreasing rearrangement of the initial function &quot;f&quot;; in particular, formula_22 for &quot;f&quot; nondecreasing.

== Properties ==

The convex conjugate of a closed convex function is again a closed convex function. The convex conjugate of a polyhedral convex function (a convex function with polyhedral epigraph) is again a polyhedral convex function.

=== Order reversing===

Declare that formula_23 if and only if formula_24 for all formula_25 Then convex-conjugation is order-reversing, which by definition means that if formula_23 then formula_27 

For a family of functions formula_28 it follows from the fact that supremums may be interchanged that

:formula_29

and from the max–min inequality that 

:formula_30

=== Biconjugate ===
The convex conjugate of a function is always lower semi-continuous. The biconjugate formula_31 (the convex conjugate of the convex conjugate) is also the closed convex hull, i.e. the largest lower semi-continuous convex function with formula_32 
For proper functions formula_33 

:formula_34 if and only if formula_35 is convex and lower semi-continuous, by the Fenchel–Moreau theorem.

=== Fenchel&#x27;s inequality ===
For any function and its convex conjugate , Fenchel&#x27;s inequality (also known as the Fenchel–Young inequality) holds for every formula_36 and 

:formula_37

Furthermore, the equality holds only when formula_38.
The proof follows from the definition of convex conjugate: formula_39

=== Convexity ===
For two functions formula_40 and formula_41 and a number formula_42 the convexity relation 

:formula_43

holds. The formula_44 operation is a convex mapping itself.

=== Infimal convolution ===
The infimal convolution (or epi-sum) of two functions formula_35 and formula_46 is defined as

:formula_47

Let formula_48 be proper, convex and lower semicontinuous functions on formula_49 Then the infimal convolution is convex and lower semicontinuous (but not necessarily proper), and satisfies

:formula_50

The infimal convolution of two functions has a geometric interpretation: The (strict) epigraph of the infimal convolution of two functions is the Minkowski sum of the (strict) epigraphs of those functions.

=== Maximizing argument ===
If the function formula_35 is differentiable, then its derivative is the maximizing argument in the computation of the convex conjugate:
:formula_52 and
:formula_53

hence
:formula_54
:formula_55

and moreover
:formula_56
:formula_57

=== Scaling properties ===
If for some formula_58 formula_59, then 
:formula_60

=== Behavior under linear transformations ===
Let formula_61 be a bounded linear operator. For any convex function formula_35 on formula_63 

:formula_64

where

:formula_65

is the preimage of formula_35 with respect to formula_67 and formula_68 is the adjoint operator of formula_69

A closed convex function formula_35 is symmetric with respect to a given set formula_71 of orthogonal linear transformations,

:formula_72 for all formula_73 and all formula_74

if and only if its convex conjugate formula_75 is symmetric with respect to formula_76

<doc id="1001506" wikidata="Q4345913" url="?curid=1001506" title="The Legend of the Lone Ranger">
<text>The Legend of the Lone Ranger is a 1981 American Western adventure film directed by William A. Fraker and starring Klinton Spilsbury, Michael Horse and Christopher Lloyd. It is based on the story of The Lone Ranger, a Western character created by George W. Trendle and Fran Striker.

Producers outraged fans by refusing to allow previous Lone Ranger actor Clayton Moore to wear the character&#x27;s mask during public appearances, and created further bad publicity when it became known that the voice of leading man Spilsbury was dubbed by another actor, James Keach. The film was a critical and commercial failure, and Spilsbury has not appeared in any films since.

==Plot==
In 1854 in Texas, the outlaw Butch Cavendish and his gang of outlaws are chasing a young Comanche boy named Tonto. He rides into a thicket and falls off his horse and down an embankment. John Reid, a boy who was already there, hides Tonto, and the outlaws turn their attention to a small village. They kill everyone there, except John. Tonto takes John to his reservation and teaches him to shoot a bow and arrow with precision, how to fight, and overall the way they live.

The two eventually become blood brothers, and John later leaves the reservation for Detroit, grows up to become a lawyer, and takes a stagecoach to a town to set up his law practice. The coach is robbed by Cavendish’s gang, with the shotgun rider getting killed and the driver wounded. John stops the coach and the outlaws take a mailbag containing property deeds.

At the town, John meets the uncle (the owner of the local newspaper) of a beautiful young woman named Amy who was on the same stagecoach as John. John tells them he is going to the Texas Rangers station to visit his brother Dan. During his visit, word reaches them about the whereabouts of Cavendish after some of the gang ride into town during a festival and kill Amy’s uncle. Collins, one of the Rangers, rides ahead to scout for signs of Cavendish, unbeknownst to the Rangers that he is part of Cavendish’s gang. Cavendish and his gang ambush the Rangers (Reid among them), killing all except Reid, who is rescued by Tonto.

When John recovers from his wounds, Tonto teaches him to shoot with silver bullets, and he captures and tames a white horse, which he names Silver. He dedicates his life to fighting the crime that Cavendish represents. To this end, John becomes the great masked western hero, The Lone Ranger. Cavendish takes President Ulysses S. Grant hostage, revealing that he is attempting to take over Texas and secede it from the Union as his own independent country, using the President as a bargaining chip.

John and Tonto sneak into the Cavendish compound and rescue Grant, and blow up the compound with dynamite they found while avoiding the guards. Cavendish attempts to flee the United States Cavalry, but John pursues and ultimately apprehends Cavendish, who is arrested. The President thanks John and Tonto, and the pair ride away as President Grant asks, “Who is that masked man?”

===Development===
The rights to the character had been bought in 1954 by Jack Wrather, an oil billionaire, and his wife Bonita Granville. They had made many attempts to create a Lone Ranger movie that would appeal to a modern audience, including making Tonto an equal partner and mentor to the Lone Ranger. By the late 1970s they believed that the story was ripe for retelling in an epic vein similar to Richard Donner&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; (1978), with the potential for sequels.

In October 1977 Lew Grade announced he would make the film as part of a slate of movies worth $97 million, including &quot;Love and Bullets&quot;, &quot;Escape to Athena&quot;, and &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot;. Most of the films Grade would finance himself but &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; was a co production with Wrather. Grade said the Lone Ranger would likely be played by an unknown, after a wide talent search. In October 1978 Grade said the film would be distributed by the new company Associated Film Distribution, a joint consortium between ITC Entertainment, EMI Films, and Marble Arch Productions.

&quot;This is a grand old western in the heroic and glorious style of the cowboy picture,&quot; said Walter Coblentz, producer. &quot;This is not &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;. When he puts on his mask you&#x27;re going to believe it.&quot;

Martin Starger said they were doing the film because &quot;Heroes are needed today more than ever... We&#x27;re playing it straight. This isn&#x27;t a spoof or a satire.&quot;

Coblentz added, &quot; I decided the Indian element needed upgrading. I decided to treat the Lone Ranger and Tonto more as equals. I wanted their relationship to be dignified. I wanted to take advantage of Indian lore.&quot;

In September 1979 Coblentz announced the director would be William Fraker. Fraker was normally a cinematographer but he had directed &quot;Monte Walsh&quot; which Coblentz admired.

William Fraker the director said &quot;The Lone Ranger will work if we can make him real&quot; and said he was influenced by &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;.

Two of the movie&#x27;s four screenwriters, Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, had previously created the hit TV series &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels;&quot; they had also worked together on another hit series, &quot;Mannix.&quot; According to Larry McMurtry, novelist George MacDonald Fraser had written an excellent script for the film, but he was not credited in the finished film.

===Casting===
Actors considered for the lead included Stephen Collins, Nicholas Guest, and Bruce Boxleitner. The part eventually went to Klinton Spilsbury, a photographer who had studied art (particularly sculpting) in New York. Spilsbury, whose father was a football coach at the University of Arizona, had grown up on a ranch in Chihuahua, Mexico. Spilsbury signed to a three-picture deal.

&quot;He looked great in the mask, which seems like an odd thing to say,” Starger said. “But that was important because we had to find an actor whose eyes were not close together. The mask doesn’t look good if the eyes are too close.”

Tonto was played by Michael Horse, a silversmith by trade, whose only other acting experience had been a bit part in a Raquel Welch TV-movie. &quot;For me this is an adventure and fun,&quot; he said. &quot;Who knows if I can act. I&#x27;ll soon find out. And if I&#x27;m a flop I&#x27;ll just go off fishing.&quot; Horse would later make himself known as a supporting regular on David Lynch&#x27;s prime-time experimental television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.

===Shooting===
This film was shot in New Mexico, Utah, Colorado and California starting April 1980. Many scenes were shot in Monument Valley, Carson National Forest, Santa Fe National Forest, and Valley of Fire State Park. The fictional border town of Del Rio was constructed twenty miles outside Santa Fe, New Mexico.

Spilsbury was reportedly difficult during the shoot. “He came onto the set as if he was playing the role of a movie star,” says Lloyd. “I don’t know whether it was an affectation that he chose to bring with him, or whether he sincerely felt that that’s what was called for. And this was a problem from beginning to end. He did things that simply hindered the production.” This included getting involved in several brawls at night during the shoot.

The movie&#x27;s ballad-narration, &quot;The Man in the Mask,&quot; was performed by country music artist Merle Haggard, and composed by John Barry with lyrics written by Dean Pitchford of &quot;Footloose&quot; and &quot;Sing&quot; fame.

The filmmakers were unhappy with Spilsbury&#x27;s acting. &quot;You just never believed what he was saying because he memorized the lines but he had never internalized them,” says Jim Van Wyck, who was a DGA assistant director trainee on the film. “It was like he was reading the script, but the intonations were wrong.” This dialogue was eventually overdubbed for the entire movie by actor James Keach.

&quot;His inflections were a little strange, but I actually didn’t think he was that bad, to be honest with you,” says Keach. “I don’t know why they didn’t have him redo it. But it was a very well-paying job at the time, so I accepted it.”

Five horses were used to play Silver.

The film was part of a brief revival of the Western in 1980, which also included &quot;The Long Riders&quot;, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; and &quot;The Mountain Men&quot;.

===Clayton Moore lawsuit===
Part of the plan was to shoot a feature film with a new actor to replace the 65-year-old Clayton Moore, who had starred in the long-running and hugely successful television series for much of the 1950s.

Wrather had a vision for the retelling of the story, and he felt that the profile of the character would be devalued by Moore&#x27;s continuing to appear in costume, as he had done for many years entertaining children in hospitals and appearing at county and state fairs. Also, he did not want audiences to believe that the aging Moore would reprise his role as the Lone Ranger. In 1975, Wrather asked Moore to stop portraying the character, but he refused. In 1979, the producers obtained a court injunction barring Moore from appearing in public with his trademark black mask. He was also permitted to sign autographs only as &quot;The Masked Man.&quot; Moore responded by changing his costume slightly and replacing the mask with similar-looking wraparound sunglasses, and by cross-litigating against Wrather. The suit was eventually dismissed. Wrather finally allowed Moore to continue openly playing the character again in 1984 shortly before Wrather&#x27;s death.

“I thought that was really kind of nasty and unnecessary,” said Christopher Lloyd. “Nothing Moore was doing was really interfering with the film. I thought that was kind of terrible.”

==Release==
The film was to have initially been released by AFD on December 19, 1980. However, the film was postponed to the summer of 1981 after the 1980 actors strike delayed post-production. AFD shut down in February 1981 after a series of unsuccessful films, particularly &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot;, and distribution was instead handled by Universal (who would eventually become the owner of the source material itself through its ownership of Classic Media&#x27;s parent company, DreamWorks Animation), along with other Grade movies like &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; and &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot;. This resulted in the release of the film being pushed back. Spilsbury refused to do any publicity for the film.

Jack Wrather was good friends with Ronald and Nancy Reagan and the Reagans were to attend the premiere at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. Owing the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan in March 1981, they did not but Reagan sent a tape record of congratulations to be played at the premiere.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was released in 1981 to massive negative publicity over the Clayton Moore lawsuit. The opening week was considered a disaster, making only $4 million after being shown on 1,000 screens. The film ultimately grossed $12 million against its $18 million budget. Other contributing factors were fading public interest in Westerns by the 1980s and alterations to some fundamental elements of the Lone Ranger&#x27;s character, such as his trademark silver bullets being made into magical talismans in the movie instead of mere symbolism.

Lew Grade, who invested in the movie, had managed to sell it to TV for $7.5 million, and also to HBO.

Marvin Starger claimed the film cost $13 million rather than the reported $18 million but said with advertising and prints costing $10 million the film lost $10 million. Fraker never directed again and Spilsbury never acted again.

===Critical===

The film received generally mediocre reviews: &quot;Time Out London&quot; said, &quot;The mystery is how Fraker, a gifted cameraman who made a superb directing debut in Westerns with Monte Walsh, could produce such a clinker as this.&quot;

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said &quot;you can have a very good time watching it.&quot;

In a 1981 episode of the weekly television movie review program, &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;, film critics Gene Siskel (of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;) and Roger Ebert (of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;) heavily criticized this film. Siskel stated that the movie was &quot;badly acted and horribly paced.&quot; He chastised the tenor of the film, also, stating, &quot;How about having a sense of humor of the character? You know, enjoying the presentation of the character? You don&#x27;t get it from the actor Klinton Spilsbury, and you don&#x27;t get it from the filmmakers or the director.&quot; Siskel, anticipating a short film career for Spilsbury, added this: &quot;I think it [this movie] is going to provide a great trivia question for the 1990s: Not ‘Who was that Masked Man,’ but who played him? The answer Klinton Spilsbury.&quot; Both Siskel and Ebert noted how it took an hour for &quot;The Legend of the Lone Ranger&quot; to really get started. Ebert specifically noted, &quot;It&#x27;s very slowly paced, and it should have been break-neck [paced] right out of the starting gate... a real disappointing movie.&quot; On behalf of both critics, Siskel summed up the film this way, &quot;Roger [Ebert] and I agree that ‘The Legend of the Lone Ranger’ is a total waste of time... neither one of us can recommend you see it&quot;. He refers to it as a &quot;bad Western.&quot;

Movie historian Leonard Maltin gave the picture 2 out of a possible 4 stars, noting &quot;Some fine action, great scenery, and a promising storyline; yet these are sabotaged by awkward handling, uncharismatic leads, and an absolutely awful ballad-style narration. Paging Clayton Moore &amp; Jay Silverheels!&quot;

Sir Lew Grade later wrote, in his 1992 autobiography &quot;Still Dancing: My Story,&quot; that he thought that the problem with the movie was that it took an hour and ten minutes before the Ranger first pulled on his mask. &quot;The mistake was not dispensing with the legend in ten minutes and getting on with the action much earlier on,&quot; his text said.

===Awards and nominations===
==Merchandise==
A novelization of the movie, written by Gary McCarthy and published by Ballantine Books, was released in 1981.

The film was adapted into a newspaper comic published between 1981 and 1984 that was written by Cary Bates and illustrated by Russ Heath.

A line of action figures was created by the toy company Gabriel in 1982, including Buffalo Bill Cody, Butch Cavendish, George Custer, The Lone Ranger, and Tonto. Also released by Gabriel were the horses Silver (The Lone Ranger&#x27;s Horse), Scout (Tonto&#x27;s Horse), and Smoke (Butch&#x27;s Horse).

<text>Adam of Fulda (c. 1445 – 1505) was a German composer and music theorist of the second half of the 15th century. He was born in Fulda and died in Wittenberg.

In Heinrich Glarean&#x27;s &quot;Dodecachordon&quot; he is described as &quot;Francum Germanum&quot;, i.e., of German origin. Adam of Fulda calls himself at times &quot;musicus ducalis&quot; (musician of the Court). He also mentions Guillaume Dufay (1400–1474) as his contemporary.

==Biography==
Adam of Fulda was born approximately 1445. He was educated at the Benedictine Monastery at Vornbach Abbey, where he wrote his &quot;De musica&quot;. After leaving the monastery, he was a lecturer at the Wittenberg University in Torgau, where he was one of the scholars involved with Renaissance humanism. From 1490 he was choir director.

==Writings==
Three writings of his are known. &quot;De musica&quot; is a four-part manuscript written in Strasbourg, dated 4 November 1490. It deals in 7 chapters with an explication, invention and praise of music; in 21 chapters with the human hand, the chant, the voice, the clefs, the mutation and the keys; in 13 chapters with mensural music and in 8 chapters with proportions and consonances.

He wrote &quot;Ein ser andechtig Cristenlich Buchleī aus hailigē schrifften vnd Lerern von Adam von Fulda in teutsch reymenn gesetzt&quot; (A very pious and Christian booklet from the Holy writings and studies by Adam of Fulda set in German rhymes), published in Wittenberg in 1512 (reprinted, Berlin, 1914).

Fulda began another work which was to be a history of Saxony. It was completed by Johannes Trithemius after Adam&#x27;s death in 1514 as &quot;Annales Hirsaugiensis&quot;.

==Musical works==
Most of Adam&#x27;s musical works are liturgical settings or secular songs. He wrote one mass, and several liturgical works. Niemöller lists 3 secular songs.

==Recordings of works by Adam of Fulda==
&quot;Ach hülf mich leid&quot; and other works by Adam of Fulda have been recorded by the German Renaissance-music vocal group &quot;Stimmwerck&quot;.

<doc id="1001536" wikidata="Q937212" url="?curid=1001536" title="Gate of Dawn">
<text>The Gate of Dawn (), or Sharp Gate (, , , , ) is a city gate in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, and one of its most important religious, historical and cultural monuments. It is a major site of Catholic pilgrimage in Lithuania.

== History ==
The gate was built between 1503 and 1522 as a part of Vilnius city wall, as one of the nine gates. Its defensive function is indicated by the firing openings still visible on the outside of the gate. It has been known as the &quot;Medininkai Gate&quot;, as it led to the village Medininkai south of Vilnius, as well as &quot;Sharp gate&quot;. Probably right after its construction, an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary was hung on the gate. In the first half of the 17th century, a new image of the Virgin Mary was placed on the city-facing side, revered with special devotion to this day, while on the outer side, an image of the Salvator Mundi was displayed.

In 1626, a Discalced Carmelite monastery with the Church of St. Theresa was established right next to the gate. The monks began venerating the image placed in the gate and promoting its devotion among the people. In 1668, they obtained permission from the city to build a wooden chapel within the gate. The construction was completed in 1672, at which time the image was solemnly rehung.

In 1711, the chapel was destroyed by fire, but the image was saved and transferred to the Church of St. Teresa. A new brick chapel was built, and around 1713–1715, the image was relocated there. Initially overshadowed by the veneration of Marian images from St. Michael’s Church in Vilnius and from Trakai, the cult of the image grew in popularity throughout the 18th century.

During the demolition of the city walls between 1799 and 1805, the image was already so highly venerated that the gate was the only structure left intact. Between 1828 and 1830, the chapel underwent reconstruction, and prior to that, a gallery with stairs had been added.

In 1828, an inscription in Polish was placed on the chapel: &quot;Matko Miłosierdzia, pod Twoją obronę uciekamy się&quot; (). In 1844, the Russian government dissolved the Carmelite monastery, and the care of the chapel was taken over by secular clergy. The Feast of the Protection of Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn, celebrated in the second week of November, attracted large crowds, with its origins dating back to the early 18th century.

After the suppression of the January Uprising, the governor of Vilnius, Mikhail Muravyov, planned to close the chapel and transfer the image to the Orthodox Monastery of the Holy Spirit. Although the chapel was successfully defended, the inscription on the gate had to be changed from Polish to Latin, and preaching from the chapel was forbidden. Sermons were only reinstated after the Edict of Tolerance in 1905. The Polish inscription was restored after World War I when Vilnius became part of Poland. Through the efforts of the Archbishop of Vilnius, Romuald Jałbrzykowski, the image was solemnly crowned in 1927.

Between 1931 and 1932, the chapel underwent renovations, including the removal of the organ and the covering of the walls with oak paneling.

== Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn ==

In the 16th century city gates often contained religious artifacts intended to guard the city from attacks and to bless travelers. The Chapel in the Gate of Dawn contains an icon of The Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of Mercy, said to have miraculous powers. For centuries the picture has been one of the symbols of the city and an object of veneration for the Christian inhabitants of the city of all denominations. Thousands of votive offerings adorn the walls and many pilgrims from neighboring countries come to pray in front of the beloved painting. Masses are held in Lithuanian and Polish languages.

Historical study of the Gate of Dawn in Vilnius recalls the story of Oboźny of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Antoni Nowosielski as the defender of the Gate of Dawn and the commander of the troops of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania during the expansion of the Swedish state and the attack on the city by the Swedish army during the Great Northern War. The Battle of Vilnius took place on 16 April 1702 prince Antoni Nowosielski commanded the forces of the Grand Duchy and defended the fortification with a chapel and a painting icon located in the Gate of Dawn complex. Many Swedish soldiers died in this battle, and none of the Polish and Lithuanians was injured. However, during the battle the Swedish bullet hit the picture itself. Then, the defender of the Vilnius castle prince Antoni Nowosielski, offered a silver votive. As a sign of gratitude for the victory, prince Antoni Nowosielski hung a silver plaque with the image and appropriate inscription next to the painting. Eventually, after this event, the cult of the holy image and the Gate of Dawn was popularized by the faithful, and the place itself became a national symbol.

After World War II the cult of Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn prevailed in Lithuanian and Polish communities worldwide and is continued in many shrines to the Virgin Mary in Europe, and the Americas. The largest of the churches devoted to Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn is St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Gdańsk, Poland.

The shrine is also important in the development of the Divine Mercy devotion as it is the first place where the Divine Mercy image was exposed and also where the first celebration of the Divine Mercy Sunday took place.

On 4 September 1993 Pope John Paul II prayed the rosary at the Gate of Dawn Chapel. Church festival of the Blessed Virgin, Mary Mother of Mercy,—celebrated in the third week of November—is of great importance in the Vilnius Archdiocese.

== Lithuanian Chapel in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Vatican City ==
There is a (, &quot;Lithuanian Chapel&quot;) in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Vatican City. It was consecrated by the Pope Paul VI in 1970 and it is the place where Pope John Paul II first prayed after being elected Pope in 1978. Only Lithuania, Poland, Hungary and Ireland have such chapels in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

<doc id="1001551" wikidata="Q5592824" url="?curid=1001551" title="Graham Fitkin">
<text>Graham Fitkin (born 19 April 1963) is a British composer, pianist and conductor. His compositions fall broadly into the minimalist and postminimalist genres. Described by &quot;The Independent&quot; in 1998 as &quot;one of the most important of our younger composers&quot;, he is particularly known for his works for solo and multiple pianos, as well as for music accompanying dance.

==Biography==
Fitkin was born at Crows-an-Wra in west Cornwall on 19 April 1963. His mother, a piano teacher, encouraged his early studies on that instrument. He participated in numerous local ensembles during his childhood, and recalls starting to compose at the piano aged around 8. In 1981–4, he attended the University of Nottingham, where he studied with composer Nigel Osborne, among others. He later went to the Netherlands to study with the minimalist composer and pianist Louis Andriessen at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. In 1987, he moved to London.

Fitkin returned to Cornwall in 1991 and, as of 2010, lives in Treen. His partner is harpist Ruth Wall, with whom he collaborates in Fitkin Wall.

==Music==
Fitkin&#x27;s work is broadly classified as minimalist and postminimalist. His works are tonal and frequently complex. Much of his writing is for the piano, including solo and multiple player works. Fitkin lists his early classical influences as Igor Stravinsky, Anton Webern, Pierre Boulez and the American minimalist Steve Reich, and also acknowledges a broad range of influences outside the field of classical music, from jazz musicians Keith Jarrett, Muggsy Spanier and Miles Davis, and popular singer Frank Sinatra, to modern pop groups such as The Smiths, Wire and the Pet Shop Boys. Subsequent influences include Louis Andriessen, Gavin Bryars and Laurence Crane.

Fitkin&#x27;s earliest compositions were for piano, including &quot;From Yellow to Yellow&quot; and &quot;The Cone Gatherers&quot;. The Nanquidno group, which he co-founded in 1985, consisted of four pianists using two keyboards. Several of his early works, including &quot;Log&quot;, &quot;Line&quot; and &quot;Loud&quot;, were composed for the six-piano ensemble, Piano Circus. He has also written several works for pianist Kathryn Stott, including &quot;Circuit&quot; for two pianos and orchestra, which was composed for Stott and Noriko Ogawa in 2002 to a commission from the BBC.

The success of his early compositions for piano, particularly &quot;The Cone Gatherers&quot;, led to Fitkin being commissioned to write his first ensemble work, &quot;Cud&quot;, for jazz orchestra. &quot;Cud&quot; and Fitkin&#x27;s other early ensemble works including &quot;Hook&quot; and &quot;Stub&quot; often make use of electronic instruments and percussion, and are influenced by jazz and rock. A more recent work for electronic instruments is the album &quot;Kaplan&quot;, which was inspired by the character George Kaplan from Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film, &quot;North by Northwest&quot;. In 1994–96, Fitkin was the composer-in-residence at the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, and during the mid-to-late 1990s he composed twelve orchestral pieces including a clarinet concerto. He has composed several works for musical theatre, including the short opera &quot;Ghosts&quot;, and has also written or adapted several pieces for contemporary dance, including &quot;Huoah&quot;.

Recent projects include &quot;Still Warm&quot;, a work for multiple harps, which was composed for the Eden Project in 2006. The sextet &quot;Sinew&quot;, written for the Fibonacci Sequence, was first performed in 2009. For Yo Yo Ma, he has written a cello concerto which was premiered at the 2011 BBC Proms, as well as a work for cello and piano, titled &quot;L&quot;, composed for the performer&#x27;s fiftieth birthday (2005). A BBC commission for orchestra and chorus, titled &quot;PK&quot;, was also premiered at the Proms in 2010. In a recent project called &quot;Fitkin&quot;, a group comprising 9 virtuoso musicians has been touring the UK since early 2010. In December 2010, it was announced that Fitkin had been selected as one of twenty composers to participate in the New Music 20x12 project as part of the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad. Fitkin will compose a new work for the London Chamber Orchestra to be premiered in 2012.

In 1996, he formed the Graham Fitkin Group. His work has been released by Decca&#x27;s Argo label, Sanctuary&#x27;s Black Box label, BIS Records and Factory Classical. He founded a personal label, GFR, to release &quot;Still Warm&quot;.

==Awards==
In 1994, Fitkin won the International Grand Prix Music for Dance Video Award. He has twice won British Composer Awards: in 2009, &quot;Reel&quot; won the Stage Works category; in 2011, &quot;PK&quot; won the Outreach category.

<doc id="1001555" wikidata="Q1555243" url="?curid=1001555" title="Cancer cluster">
<text>A cancer cluster is a disease cluster in which a high number of cancer cases occurs in a group of people in a particular geographic area over a limited period of time.

Historical examples of work-related cancer clusters are well documented in the medical literature. Notable examples include: scrotal cancer among chimney sweeps in 18th-century London; osteosarcoma among female watch dial painters in the 20th century; skin cancer in farmers; bladder cancer in dye workers exposed to aniline compounds; and leukemia and lymphoma in chemical workers exposed to benzene.

Cancer cluster suspicions usually arise when members of the general public report that their family members, friends, neighbors, or coworkers have been diagnosed with the same or related cancers. State or local health departments will investigate the possibility of a cancer cluster when a claim is filed. In order to justify investigating such claims, health departments conduct a preliminary review. Data will be collected and verified regarding: the types of cancer reported, numbers of cases, geographic area of the cases, and the patients clinical history. At this point, a committee of medical professionals will examine the data and determine whether or not an investigation (often lengthy and expensive) is justified.

In the U.S., state and local health departments respond to more than 1,000 inquiries about suspected cancer clusters each year. It is possible that a suspected cancer cluster may be due to chance alone; however, only clusters that have a disease rate that is statistically significantly greater than the disease rate of the general population are investigated. Given the number of inquiries it is likely that many of these are due to chance alone. It is a well-known problem in interpreting data that random cases of cancer can appear to form clumps that are misinterpreted as a cluster.

A cluster is less likely to be coincidental if the case consists of one type of cancer, a rare type of cancer, or a type of cancer that is not usually found in a certain age group. Between 5% and 15% of suspected cancer clusters are statistically significant.

==Examples==

Some of the larger or more well known cancer clusters include:
* At least 700 cases of clear-cell carcinoma caused by the prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol in the US in the mid-1900s.
* The Camp Lejeune water contamination incident in which multiple chemicals were found in drinking water. The CDC found that marines stationed at the base had a 10% higher rate of cancer deaths than those stationed elsewhere.

<doc id="1001558" wikidata="Q952813" url="?curid=1001558" title="Thomas Blamey">
<text>Field Marshal Sir Thomas Albert Blamey, (24 January 1884 – 27 May 1951) was an Australian general of the First and Second World Wars. He is the only Australian to attain the rank of field marshal.

Blamey joined the Australian Army as a regular soldier in 1906, and attended the Staff College at Quetta. During the First World War, he participated in the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, and served as a staff officer in the Gallipoli campaign, where he was mentioned in despatches for a daring raid behind enemy lines. He later served on the Western Front, where he distinguished himself in the planning for the Battle of Pozières. He rose to the rank of brigadier general, and served as chief of staff of the Australian Corps under Lieutenant General Sir John Monash, who credited him as a factor in the Corps&#x27; success in the Battle of Hamel, the Battle of Amiens and the Battle of the Hindenburg Line.

After the war Blamey became the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, and was involved in the creation of the Royal Australian Air Force. He resigned from the regular Army in 1925 to become Chief Commissioner of the Victoria Police, but remained in the Militia, rising to command the 3rd Division in 1931. As chief commissioner, Blamey set about dealing with the grievances that had led to the 1923 Victorian police strike, and implemented innovations such as police dogs and equipping vehicles with radios. His tenure as chief commissioner was marred by a scandal in which his police badge was found in a brothel, and a later attempt to cover up the shooting of a police officer led to his forced resignation in 1936.

During the Second World War Blamey commanded the Second Australian Imperial Force and the I Corps in the Middle East. In the latter role he commanded Australian and Commonwealth troops in the disastrous Battle of Greece. He attempted to protect Australian interests against British commanders who sought to disperse his forces. He was appointed deputy commander-in-chief of Middle East Command, and was promoted to general in 1941. In 1942, he returned to Australia as commander-in-chief of the Australian Military Forces and commander of Allied Land Forces in the South West Pacific Area under American General Douglas MacArthur. On the orders of MacArthur and Prime Minister John Curtin, he assumed personal command of New Guinea Force during the Kokoda Track campaign, and relieved Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell under controversial circumstances. He planned and carried out the significant and victorious Salamaua–Lae campaign but during the final campaigns of the war he faced criticism of the Army&#x27;s performance. He signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on behalf of Australia at Japan&#x27;s ceremonial surrender in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945, and personally accepted the Japanese surrender on Morotai on 9 September.

==Early life==
The seventh of ten children, Blamey was born on 24 January 1884 in Lake Albert, near Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. He was the son of Richard Blamey, a farmer who had emigrated from Cornwall at the age of 16 in 1862, and his Australian-born wife, Margaret (née Murray). After farming failures in Queensland and on the Murrumbidgee River near Wagga Wagga, his father Richard moved to a small property in Lake Albert, where he supplemented his farm income working as a drover and shearing overseer.

Blamey acquired the bush skills associated with his father&#x27;s enterprises and became a sound horseman. He attended Wagga Wagga Superior Public School (now Wagga Wagga Public School), where he played Australian football, and was a keen member of the Army Cadet unit. He transferred to Wagga Wagga Grammar when he was 13, and was head cadet of its unit for two years.

Blamey began his working life in 1899 as a trainee school teacher at Lake Albert School. He transferred to South Wagga Public School in 1901, and in 1903 moved to Western Australia, where he taught for three years at Fremantle Boys&#x27; School. He coached the rifle shooting team of its cadet unit there to a win in the Western Australian Cup. He was raised in the Methodist faith and remained involved with his church. By early 1906 he was a lay preacher, and church leaders in Western Australia offered him an appointment as an associate minister in Carnarvon, Western Australia.

==Early military career==
With the creation of the Cadet Instructional Staff of the Australian Military Forces, Blamey saw a new opportunity. He sat the exam and came third in Australia, but failed to secure an appointment as there were no vacancies in Western Australia. After correspondence with the military authorities he persuaded the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General, Major Julius Bruche, that he should be given the option of taking up an appointment for one of the vacancies in another state. He was appointed to a position in Victoria with the rank of lieutenant, commencing duty in November 1906 with responsibility for school cadets in Victoria, and was confirmed in his rank and appointment the following 29 June.

In Melbourne, Blamey met Minnie Millard, the daughter of a Toorak stockbroker who was involved in the Methodist Church there. They were married at her home on 8 September 1909. His first child was born on 29 June 1910, and named Charles Middleton after a friend of Blamey&#x27;s who had died in a shooting accident; but the boy was always called Dolf by his family. A second child, a boy named Thomas, was born four years later.

Blamey was promoted to captain on 1 December 1910, and became brigade major of the 12th Brigade Area. He then set his sights on attending staff college. There were two British staff colleges, at Camberley in England and Quetta in India, and from 1908 one position was set aside for the Australian Army at each every year. No Australian officers managed to pass the demanding entrance examinations, but this requirement was waived to allow them to attend. In 1911, Blamey became the first Australian officer to pass the entrance examination. He commenced his studies at Quetta in 1912, and performed very well, completing the course in December 1913.

The usual practice was for Australian staff college graduates to follow their training with a posting to a British Army or British Indian Army headquarters. He was initially attached to the 4th Battalion, King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps at Rawalpindi, and then the staff of the Kohat Brigade on the North-West Frontier. Finally, he was assigned to the General Staff at Army Headquarters at Shimal. In May 1914, he was sent to Britain for more training, while his family returned home to Australia. He visited Turkey (including the Dardanelles), Belgium, and the battlefields of the Franco-Prussian War en route. In England he spent a brief time on attachment to the 4th Dragoon Guards at Tidworth before taking up duties on the staff of the Wessex Division, at that time entering its annual camp. On 1 July 1914, he was promoted to major.

==First World War==
Following the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Blamey was transferred to the War Office, where he worked in the Intelligence Branch preparing daily summaries for the King and the Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener. Fully trained staff officers were rare and valuable in the Australian Army, and while still in Britain, Blamey was appointed to the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) as general staff officer, Grade 3 (Intelligence), on the staff of Major General William Bridges&#x27;s 1st Division. As such, he reported to the 1st Division&#x27;s GSO1, Lieutenant Colonel Brudenell White. In November 1914 he sailed for Egypt with Colonel Harry Chauvel, to join the Australian contingent there. His appointment as GSO 3 was confirmed with effect from 10 December.

===Gallipoli===
Along with Bridges, White, and other members of 1st Division headquarters, Blamey left the battleship in a trawler and landed on the beach at Anzac Cove at 07:20 on 25 April 1915. He was sent to evaluate the need for reinforcements by Colonel James McCay&#x27;s 2nd Brigade on the 400 Plateau. He confirmed that they were needed, and the reinforcements were sent.

On the night of 13 May 1915, Blamey, in his capacity as 1st Division intelligence officer, led a patrol consisting of himself, Sergeant J. H. Will and Bombardier A. A. Orchard, behind the Turkish lines in an effort to locate the Olive Grove guns that had been harassing the beach. Near Pine Ridge, an enemy party of eight Turks approached; when one of them went to bayonet Orchard, Blamey shot the Turk with his revolver. In the action that followed, six Turks were killed. He withdrew his patrol back to the Australian lines without locating the guns. For this action, he was mentioned in despatches.

Blamey was always interested in technical innovation, and was receptive to unorthodox ideas. He was instrumental in the adoption of the periscope rifle at Gallipoli, a device which he saw during an inspection of the front line. He arranged for the inventor, Lance Corporal W. C. B. Beech, to be seconded to division headquarters to develop the idea. Within a few days, the design was perfected and periscope rifles began to be used throughout the Australian trenches.

On 21 July 1915 Blamey was given a staff appointment as a general staff officer, Grade 2 (GSO2), with the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel. and with effect from 2 August joined the staff of the newly formed 2nd Division in Egypt as its assistant adjutant and quartermaster general (AA&amp;QMG) – the senior administrative officer of the division. Its commander, Major General James Gordon Legge, preferred to have an Australian colonel in this post as he felt that a British officer might not take such good care of the troops. The 2nd Division Headquarters embarked for Gallipoli on 29 August 1915, but Blamey was forced to remain in Egypt as he had just had an operation for haemorrhoids. He finally returned to Anzac on 25 October 1915, remaining for the rest of the campaign.

===Western Front===
After the Australian forces moved to the Western Front in 1916, Blamey returned to the 1st Division as GSO1 on 10 July. At the Battle of Pozières, he developed the plan of attack which captured the town, for which he received another mention in despatches, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in the 1917 New Year Honours.

He was considered as a possible brigade commander, but he had never commanded a battalion, which was usually regarded as a prerequisite for brigade command. He was therefore appointed to command the 2nd Infantry Battalion on 3 December 1916. On 28 December, Blamey, as senior ranking battalion commander, took over as acting commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade. On 9 January 1917, he went on leave, handing over command to Lieutenant Colonel Iven Mackay. However, when General Headquarters (GHQ) BEF found out about this use of a staff college graduate, it reminded I ANZAC Corps that &quot;it is inadvisable to release such officers for command of battalions unless they have proved to be unequal to their duties on staff&quot;.

Blamey therefore returned to 1st Division Headquarters. Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood did, however, promote Blamey to full colonel, backdated to 1 December 1916, thereby making him technically senior to a number of recently promoted brigadier generals, that rank being only held temporarily. His division commander, Major General H. B. Walker, had Blamey mentioned in despatches for this period of battalion and brigade command, although the battalion had spent most of the time out of the line and there had been no significant engagements. Blamey was also acting commander of the 2nd Brigade during a rest period from 27 August to 4 September 1917.

On 8 September he was hospitalised with vomiting and coughing. He was sent to England where he was admitted to the 3rd London General Hospital for treatment for debilitating psoriasis on 22 September, and did not return to duty until 8 November 1917, by which time he had been promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel on 24 September. He was made a Companion of St Michael and St George in the 1918 New Year&#x27;s list, and received another mention in despatches in May 1918.

On 1 June 1918, Lieutenant General John Monash succeeded Birdwood as commander of the Australian Corps, and Blamey was promoted to the rank of brigadier general to replace White as the corps Brigadier General General Staff (BGGS). He played a significant role in the success of the Australian Corps in the final months of the war. He remained interested in technological innovation. He was impressed by the capabilities of the new models of tanks and pressed for their use in the Battle of Hamel, where they played an important part in the success of the battle. Monash acknowledged Blamey&#x27;s role in the Australian Corps&#x27; success in the Battle of Amiens in August and the Battle of the Hindenburg Line in September.

The Major General General Staff (MGGS) of the British Fourth Army, of which the Australian Corps was a part during these battles, Major General Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd, was a former instructor of Blamey&#x27;s at Quetta. He declared himself &quot;full of admiration for the staff work of the Australian Corps.&quot; Monash later wrote:
Blamey&#x27;s loyalty to Monash would continue after the latter&#x27;s death in 1931. For his services as Corps Chief of Staff, Blamey was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1919, mentioned in despatches twice more, and was awarded the French .

==Inter-war years==

===General staff===
Blamey arrived back in Australia on 20 October 1919 after an absence of seven years, and became director of Military Operations at Army Headquarters in Melbourne. His AIF appointment was terminated on 19 December 1919, and on 1 January 1920, he was simultaneously confirmed in the rank of lieutenant-colonel and promoted to substantive colonel, also receiving the honorary rank of brigadier-general with effect from 1 June 1918. In May 1920, he was appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff.

His first major task was the creation of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The government established a joint Army–Navy board to provide recommendations on the matter, with Blamey and Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams as the Army representatives. Blamey supported the creation of a separate air force, albeit one still subordinate to the Army and Navy. He refused to yield, however, on his opposition to the Navy&#x27;s demand that Lieutenant Colonel Stanley Goble become its first chief.

In November 1922 Blamey embarked for London to be the Australian representative on the Imperial General Staff. He reported that the &quot;conception of an Imperial General Staff ... was absolutely dead&quot;. The British Army saw little use in the concept of a combined staff which could coordinate the defence of the British Empire. He became involved with the development of the Singapore strategy, and he briefed Prime Minister Stanley Bruce on it for the 1923 Imperial Conference, at which it was formally adopted. Even in 1923, though, Blamey was sceptical about the strategy.

When White retired as Chief of General Staff in 1923, Blamey was widely expected to succeed him, as he had as chief of staff of the Australian Corps in France, but there were objections from more senior officers, particularly Major General Victor Sellheim, at being passed over. Instead, the Inspector General, Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel, was made Chief of General Staff as well, while Blamey was given the new post of Second CGS, in which he performed most of the duties of Chief of General Staff.

Seeing no immediate prospects for advancement, Blamey transferred from the Permanent Military Forces to the Militia on 1 September 1925. For the next 14 years he would remain in the Army as a part-time soldier. On 1 May 1926 he assumed command of the 10th Infantry Brigade, part of the 3rd Division. Blamey stepped up to command the 3rd Division on 23 March 1931, and was promoted to major general, one of only four Militia officers promoted to this rank between 1929 and 1939. In 1937 he was transferred to the unattached list.

===Chief Commissioner of the Victoria Police===

In 1923, the Victoria Police went on strike, and Monash and McCay established a Special Constabulary Force to carry out police duties. After the Chief Commissioner, Alexander Nicholson, resigned for ill-health in 1925, Chauvel recommended Blamey for the post. He became Chief Commissioner on 1 September 1925 for a five-year term, with a salary of £1,500 per annum ().

Blamey set about addressing the grievances that had caused the strike, which he felt &quot;were just, even if they went the wrong way about them&quot;. Blamey improved pay and conditions, and implemented the recommendations of the Royal Commission into the strike. He attempted to introduce faster promotion based on merit, but this was unpopular with the Police Association, and was abandoned by his successors.

As in the Army, he showed a willingness to adopt new ideas. He introduced police dogs, and increased the number of police cars equipped with two-way radios from one in 1925 to five in 1930. He also boosted the numbers of policewomen on the force.

Blamey became involved in his first and greatest scandal soon after taking office. During a raid on a brothel in Fitzroy on 21 October 1925, the police encountered a man who produced Blamey&#x27;s police badge, No. 80. Blamey later said that he had given his key ring, which included his badge, to a friend who had served with him in France, so that the man could help himself to some alcohol in Blamey&#x27;s locker at the Naval and Military Club. His story was corroborated by his friend Stanley Savige, who was with him at the time. Blamey protected the man in question, who he said was married with children, and refused to identify him. The man has never been identified, but the description given by the detectives and the brothel owner did not match Blamey.

During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and restrictive drinking laws, including the notorious six o&#x27;clock closing. Blamey took the position that it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known that it would not be raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.

As Police Commissioner Blamey defended the actions of the police during the 1928 Waterside Workers&#x27; Federation dispute, during which police opened fire, killing a striking worker who was also a Gallipoli veteran, and wounding several others. His treatment of the unionists was typical of his hard line anti-communist beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing governments were tense.
Blamey was re-appointed as Chief Commissioner in 1930 but at a reduced salary of £1,250 per annum (). A year later it was reduced still further, to £785 (), due to cutbacks as a result of the Great Depression. His wife Minnie became an invalid, and by 1930 no longer accompanied him in public. His son Dolf, now an RAAF flying officer, was killed in an air crash at RAAF Base Richmond in October 1932, and Minnie died in October 1935. Blamey was knighted in the 1935 New Year Honours, and in 1936 he was appointed a Commander of the Venerable Order of Saint John.

A second scandal occurred in 1936 when Blamey attempted to cover up details of the shooting of the superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Branch, John O&#x27;Connell Brophy, whom Blamey had appointed to the post. The story put about was that Brophy had taken two women friends and a chauffeur along with him to a meeting with a police informant. While they were waiting for the informant, they had been approached by armed bandits, and Brophy had opened fire and had himself been wounded. In order to cover up the identities of the two women involved, Blamey initially issued a press release to the effect that Brophy had accidentally shot himself (three times). The Premier, Albert Dunstan, gave Blamey the choice of resigning or being dismissed. The latter meant the loss of pension rights and any future prospects of employment in the Public Service or the Army. He reluctantly submitted his resignation on 9 July 1936.

===Other activities and marriage===
From March 1938 Blamey supplemented his income by making weekly broadcasts on international affairs on Melbourne radio station 3UZ under the pseudonym &quot;the Sentinel&quot;. Like the station&#x27;s general manager, Alfred Kemsley, Blamey felt that Australians were poorly informed about international affairs, and set about raising awareness of matters that he believed would soon impact them greatly.

He was appalled at Nazi Germany&#x27;s persecution of Jews, and saw a clear and growing menace to world peace from both Germany and the Empire of Japan. His 15-minute weekly talks continued until the end of September 1939, by which time the war that he had warned was coming had started.

On 5 April 1939 he married Olga Ora Farnsworth, a 35-year-old fashion artist, at St John&#x27;s Anglican Church, Toorak.

===League of National Security===
Blamey was leader of the clandestine far right-wing League of National Security, also known as the &quot;White Army&quot;, described as a fascist paramilitary group. The group, which existed for about eight years from 1931, comprised several senior army officers, including Colonel Francis Derham, a Melbourne lawyer, and Lieutenant Colonel Edmund Herring, later Chief Justice of Victoria.

Some members had been members of the New South Wales-based New Guard, and both groups were involved in street fights with leftist groups. This was reportedly a response to the rise of communism in Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.
===Manpower Committee and militia recruiting===
In November 1938, Blamey was appointed chairman of the Commonwealth Government&#x27;s Manpower Committee and Controller General of Recruiting. As such, he laid the foundation for the expansion of the Army in the event of war with Germany or Japan, which he now regarded as inevitable. He headed a successful recruiting campaign which doubled the size of the part-time volunteer Militia from 35,000 in September 1938 to 70,000 in March 1939.

Henry Somer Gullett and Richard Casey, who had served with Blamey at Gallipoli and in France, put Blamey&#x27;s name forward to Prime Minister Joseph Lyons as a possible commander in chief in the event of a major war. &quot;We&#x27;ve got some brilliant staff officers&quot;, Casey told Lyons, &quot;but Blamey is a commander. That&#x27;s the difference.&quot;

Lyons initially had concerns about Blamey&#x27;s morals, but Casey and Lyons summoned Blamey to a meeting in Canberra, after which Lyons designated him for the job. Lyons died on 7 April 1939, and was replaced as prime minister by Robert Menzies, another prominent supporter of Blamey&#x27;s. Two other officers, Major Generals Gordon Bennett and John Lavarack, were considered, and also had strong and well-connected supporters, but unlike Blamey they were public critics of the government&#x27;s defence policies.

==Second World War==
===Middle East===

On 13 October 1939, a month after the outbreak of the Second World War, Blamey was promoted to lieutenant general, and appointed to command the 6th Division, the first formation of the new Second Australian Imperial Force, and received the AIF service number VX1. Menzies limited his choice of commanders by insisting that they be selected from the Militia rather than the Permanent Military Forces (PMF), the Army&#x27;s full-time, regular component. For brigade commanders he chose Brigadiers Arthur Allen, Leslie Morshead and Stanley Savige. He selected Brigadier Edmund Herring to command the 6th Division artillery, Colonel Samuel Burston for its medical services, and Lieutenant Colonels Clive Steele and Jack Stevens for its engineers and signals. All except Allen had previously served with him during his time commanding the 3rd Division in Melbourne. For his two most senior staff officers, he chose two PMF officers, Colonel Sydney Rowell as GSO1 and Lieutenant Colonel George Alan Vasey as AA&amp;QMG.

In February 1940, the War Cabinet decided to form a second AIF division, the 7th Division, and group the 6th and 7th Divisions together as I Corps, with Blamey as its commander. On Blamey&#x27;s recommendation, Major General Iven Mackay was appointed to succeed him in command of the 6th Division, while Lieutenant General John Lavarack, a PMF officer, assumed command of the 7th Division. Blamey took Rowell with him as his corps chief of staff, and picked Major General Henry Wynter as his administrative officer. Blamey flew to Palestine on a Qantas flying boat in June 1940. He refused to allow his troops to perform police duties in Palestine, and established warm relations with the Jewish community there, becoming a frequent guest in their homes.

As commander of the AIF, Blamey was answerable directly to the Minister of Defence, rather than to the Military Board, with a charter based on that given to Bridges in 1914. Part of this required that his forces remain together as cohesive units, and that no Australian forces were to be deployed or engaged without the prior consent of the Australian government. Blamey was not inflexible, and permitted Australian units to be detached when there was a genuine military need. Because the situation in the Middle East lurched from crisis to crisis, this resulted in his troops becoming widely scattered at times. When the crises had passed, however, he wanted units returned to their parent formations. This resulted in conflicts with British commanders. The first occurred in August 1940 when the British Commander in Chief Middle East Command, General Sir Archibald Wavell, and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, ordered the 16th Infantry Brigade to move to Egypt. Blamey refused on the grounds that the brigade was not yet fully equipped, but eventually compromised, sending it on the understanding that it would soon be joined by the rest of the 6th Division.
I Corps assumed responsibility for the front in Cyrenaica on 15 February 1941, but within days Blamey was informed that his troops would be sent on the expedition to Greece. Blamey has been criticised for allowing this when he knew it was extremely hazardous, after he was told that Menzies had approved. He insisted, however, on sending the veteran 6th Division first instead of the 7th Division, resulting in a heated argument with Wavell, which Blamey won. He was under no illusions about the odds of success, and immediately prepared plans for an evacuation. His foresight and determination saved many of his men, but he lost credibility when he chose his son Tom to fill the one remaining seat on the aircraft carrying him out of Greece. The campaign exposed deficiencies in the Australian Army&#x27;s training, leadership and staff work that had passed unnoticed or had not been addressed in the Libyan Campaign. The pressure of the campaign opened a rift between Blamey and Rowell, which was to have important consequences. While Rowell and Brigadier William Bridgeford were extremely critical of Blamey&#x27;s performance in Greece, this opinion was not widely held. Wavell reported that &quot;Blamey has shown himself a fine fighting commander in these operations and fitted for high command.&quot;

The political fallout from the disastrous Battle of Greece led to Blamey&#x27;s appointment as Deputy Commander in Chief Middle East Command in April 1941. However, to ensure that command would not pass to Blamey in the event of something happening to Wavell, the British government promoted Sir Henry Maitland Wilson to general in June. Soon afterwards, Wavell was replaced by General Sir Claude Auchinleck. Blamey was subsequently promoted to the same rank on 24 September 1941, becoming only the fourth Australian to reach this rank, after Monash, Chauvel and White. During the Syrian campaign against the Vichy French, Blamey took decisive action to resolve the command difficulties caused by Wilson&#x27;s attempt to direct the fighting from the King David Hotel in Jerusalem by interposing Lavarack&#x27;s I Corps headquarters.

During Blamey&#x27;s absence in Greece, AIF units had become widely scattered, with forces being deployed to Cyprus, and the 9th Division and the 18th Infantry Brigade coming under siege in Tobruk. Blamey would spend the rest of the year attempting to reassemble his forces. This led to a clash with Auchinleck over the relief of Tobruk, where Blamey accepted Burston&#x27;s advice that the Australian troops there should be relieved on medical grounds. Menzies, and later his successors, Arthur Fadden and John Curtin, backed Blamey, and Auchinleck and Churchill were forced to give way resulting in the relief of most of the Australian troops by the British 70th Division. For his campaigns in the Middle East, Blamey was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1942. He was Mentioned in Despatches for the eighth time, and was awarded the Greek War Cross, First Class.

===Papuan campaign===

The defence of Australia took on a new urgency in December 1941 with the entry of Japan into the war. Within the Army there was a concern that Bennett or Lavarack would be appointed as commander-in-chief. In March 1942, Vasey, Herring and Steele approached the Minister for the Army, Frank Forde, with a proposal that all officers over the age of 50 be immediately retired and Major General Horace Robertson be appointed commander-in-chief. This &quot;revolt of the generals&quot; collapsed with the welcome news that Blamey was returning from the Middle East to become commander-in-chief of Australian Military Forces.

General Douglas MacArthur arrived in Australia in March 1942 to become Supreme Commander South West Pacific Area (SWPA). In addition to his duties as commander-in-chief, Blamey became commander of Allied Land Forces, South West Pacific Area. In the reorganisation that followed his return to Australia on 23 March, Blamey appointed Lavarack to command the First Army, Mackay to command the Second Army, and Bennett to command the III Corps in Western Australia. Vasey became deputy chief of the general staff (DCGS), while Herring took over Northern Territory Force, and Robertson became commander of the 1st Armoured Division. Blamey&#x27;s Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) was established in Melbourne, but after MacArthur&#x27;s General Headquarters (GHQ) moved to Brisbane in July 1942, Blamey established an Advanced LHQ in nearby St Lucia, Queensland.
The Allied command structure was soon put under strain by Australian reverses in the Kokoda Track campaign. MacArthur was highly critical of the Australian performance, and confided to the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George Marshall, that &quot;the Australians have proven themselves unable to match the enemy in jungle fighting. Aggressive leadership is lacking.&quot; MacArthur told Curtin that Blamey should be sent up to New Guinea to take personal command of the situation. Curtin later confessed that &quot;in my ignorance (of military matters) I thought that the Commander in Chief should be in New Guinea.&quot; Jack Beasley suggested that Blamey would make a convenient scapegoat: &quot;Moresby is going to fall. Send Blamey up there and let him fall with it!&quot;

Blamey felt he had no choice, but his assumption of command of New Guinea Force sat uneasily with Rowell, the commander of I Corps there, who saw it as displaying a lack of confidence in him. A petulant Rowell would not be mollified, and, after a series of disagreements, Blamey relieved Rowell of his command, replacing him with Herring. More reliefs followed. Herring relieved Brigadier Arnold Potts of the 21st Infantry Brigade, replacing him with Brigadier Ivan Dougherty on 22 October. Five days later, Blamey replaced Allen as the 7th Division&#x27;s commander with Vasey. Nor were generals the only ones to be removed. Blamey cancelled Chester Wilmot&#x27;s accreditation as a war correspondent in October 1942 for spreading a false rumour that Blamey was taking payments from the laundry contractor at Puckapunyal. Wilmot was reinstated, but on 1 November 1942, Blamey again terminated Wilmot&#x27;s accreditation, this time for good.

Blamey made a controversial speech to the 21st Infantry Brigade on 9 November 1942. According to the official historian, Dudley McCarthy:
The implication of cowardice was seen as contrasting with his own inability to stand up to MacArthur and the Prime Minister. Rowell felt that Blamey &quot;had not shown the necessary &#x27;moral courage&#x27; to fight the Cabinet on an issue of confidence in me.&quot; When American troops suffered serious reverses in the Battle of Buna–Gona, Blamey turned the tables on MacArthur. According to Lieutenant General George Kenney, the commander of Allied Air Forces, Blamey &quot;frankly said he would rather send in more Australians, as he knew they would fight ... a bitter pill for MacArthur to swallow&quot;. In January 1943, he visited the Buna–Gona battlefield, surprising Vasey at how far forward he went, seemingly unconcerned about his safety. Blamey was impressed by the strength of the Japanese fortifications that had been captured, later telling correspondents that Australian and American troops had performed miracles.

At the Battle of Wau in January 1943, Blamey won the battle by acting decisively on intelligence, shifting the 17th Infantry Brigade from Milne Bay in time to defeat the Japanese attack. The official historian, Dudley McCarthy, later wrote:
For the Papuan Campaign, MacArthur awarded Blamey the American Distinguished Service Cross, and Blamey was created a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire on 28 May 1943. This was unusual as it was the Australian Labor Party&#x27;s policy not to award knighthoods, but was done as a response to the British government&#x27;s awards to British and American officers for the North African campaign. Blamey&#x27;s and Herring&#x27;s knighthoods would be the last that the Labor government would award to Australian soldiers.

===New Guinea Campaign===
The relationship between MacArthur and Blamey was generally good, and they had great respect for each other&#x27;s abilities. MacArthur&#x27;s main objection was that as commander-in-chief of AMF as well as commander of Allied Land Forces, Blamey was not wholly under his command. Official historian Gavin Long argued that:
The next operation was MacArthur&#x27;s Operation Cartwheel, an advance on the major Japanese base at Rabaul. The Australian Army was tasked with the capture of the Huon Peninsula. Blamey was ordered to again assume personal command of New Guinea Force. His concept, which he developed with Herring and Frank Berryman, who had replaced Vasey as DCGS, was to draw the Japanese forces away from Lae with a demonstration against Salamaua, and then capture Lae with a double envelopment. Blamey remained a devotee of new technology. His plan called for the use of the landing craft of the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade, and he intended to cross the Markham River with the aid of paratroops. Supplies would be brought across the river using DUKWs, a relatively new invention. He also attempted to acquire helicopters, but met resistance from the RAAF, and they were never delivered. MacArthur accepted a number of changes that Blamey made to his strategy, probably the most notable of which was putting the landing on New Britain before Blamey&#x27;s attack on Madang.

The campaign started well; Lae was captured well ahead of schedule. Blamey then handed over command of New Guinea Force to Mackay and returned to Australia. The 7th Division then advanced through the Ramu Valley while the 9th Division landed at Finschhafen. The campaign then slowed owing to a combination of logistical difficulties and Japanese resistance. Blamey responded to a request from Mackay to relieve Herring, whose chief of staff had been killed in an aircraft accident. He immediately sent Morshead. In February 1944 there was criticism in Parliament of the way that Blamey had &quot;side tracked&quot; various generals; the names of Bennett, Rowell, Mackay, Wynter, Herring, Lavarack, Robertson, Morshead and Clowes were mentioned. Blamey responded, 

 Frank Forde criticised Blamey for having too many generals. Blamey could only reply that the Australian Army had one general for 15,741 men and women compared to one per 9,090 in the British Army.

Blamey was annoyed by the media campaign run against him by William Dunstan and Keith Murdoch of &quot;The Herald and Weekly Times&quot; newspaper group, but success in New Guinea led to a change of heart at the newspaper, and Blamey even accepted a dinner invitation from Murdoch in 1944. There was another victory, though, far more significant. The Army had taken heavy casualties from malaria in the fighting in 1942. Blamey took the advice of Edward Ford and Neil Hamilton Fairley, and strongly backed their ultimately successful efforts to control the disease. To acquaint himself with the issues, Blamey read through &quot;Manson&#x27;s Tropical Diseases&quot;, the standard medical textbook on the subject. He promoted the work of Howard Florey on the development of penicillin, and wrote to Curtin urging that £200,000 () be earmarked for Florey&#x27;s vision of a national institute for medical research in Canberra, which ultimately became the John Curtin School of Medical Research.

Blamey was involved in discussions with the government over the size of the Army to be maintained. Now that the danger of invasion of Australia had passed, the government reconsidered how the nation&#x27;s resources, particularly of manpower, should be distributed. Blamey pressed for a commitment to maintain three AIF divisions, as only they could legally be sent north of the equator where the final campaigns would be fought. He urged that the Empire Air Training Scheme be curtailed, and opposed MacArthur&#x27;s proposal to use the Australian Army primarily for logistic support and leave combat roles principally to American troops.

===Final campaigns===

On 5 April 1944, Blamey departed for San Francisco on board for the first leg of a voyage to attend the 1944 Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference in London as part of Curtin&#x27;s party. The journey was made by sea and rail due to Curtin&#x27;s fear of flying. Also on board the ship were American military personnel returning to the United States, and some 40 Australian war brides. Blamey &quot;was always attractive to women and attracted by them. Advancing years had not reduced either his taste for amorous adventures or his capacity to enjoy them&quot;, and he brought with him several cases of spirits. The rowdy goings-on in Blamey&#x27;s cabin did not endear him to the Prime Minister, who was a reformed alcoholic. The party travelled by train to Washington, D.C., where Blamey was warmly greeted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and briefed the Combined Chiefs of Staff on the progress of the war in SWPA. In London Blamey had a series of meetings with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, and was briefed on Operation Overlord by General Sir Bernard Montgomery and Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder. Blamey was disappointed to have to turn down an offer to accompany the invasion as a guest of General Dwight Eisenhower because Curtin feared that the invasion would lead to retaliatory German bombing, and wanted to be far away before it started.

As a matter of policy, Curtin wanted Australian forces to be involved in liberating New Guinea. MacArthur therefore proposed that Australian troops relieve the American garrisons on New Britain, Bougainville and New Guinea. However, MacArthur balked at Blamey&#x27;s proposal to replace the seven American divisions with just seven Australian brigades, resulting in the 6th Division being employed as well. The larger garrisons permitted offensive operations, and demanded them if the 6th Division was to be freed for employment elsewhere. These operations aroused considerable criticism on the grounds that they were unnecessary, that the troops should have been employed elsewhere, and that the Army&#x27;s equipment and logistics were inadequate. Blamey vigorously defended his aggressive policy to reduce the bypassed Japanese garrisons and free the civilian population, but some felt that he went too far in putting his case publicly in a national radio broadcast. He was also criticised for not spending enough time in forward areas, although he spent more than half his time outside Australia in 1944, and between April 1944 and April 1945 travelled by air, by sea and by land. Blamey urged that the 7th Division not be sent to Balikpapan, an operation that he regarded as unnecessary. On this occasion, he was not supported by the government, and the operation went ahead as planned.

Gavin Long wrote: 

On 2 September 1945, Blamey was with MacArthur on and signed the Japanese surrender document on behalf of Australia. He then flew to Morotai and personally accepted the surrender of the remaining Japanese in the South West Pacific. He insisted that Australia should be represented in the Allied occupation of Japan.

==After the Second World War==
MacArthur abolished SWPA on 2 September 1945, and on 15 September Blamey offered to resign. The war was over, and the post of commander-in-chief was now a purely administrative one. His offer was not accepted, but on 14 November, the government abruptly announced that it had accepted his resignation, effective 30 November. A farewell party was held in Melbourne, which was attended by 66 brigadiers and generals. Blamey was given time to write up his despatches, and was formally retired on 31 January 1946. Forde asked Blamey if he wanted anything in way of recognition for his services, and Blamey asked for knighthoods for his generals, but Forde could not arrange this. In the end, Forde decided to give Blamey the Buick staff car he had used during the war, which had clocked up in the Middle East and the South West Pacific.

Blamey returned to Melbourne, where he devoted himself to business affairs, to writing, and to promoting the welfare of ex-service personnel. In September 1948, Blamey paid a visit to Japan, where he was warmly greeted on arrival at Iwakuni by Horace Robertson, the commander of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, who also provided an RAAF honour guard. MacArthur sent his own aircraft, the &quot;Bataan&quot;, to collect Blamey and bring him to Tokyo, where he met Blamey at the airport and gave him another warm greeting. In the late 1940s Blamey became involved with The Association, an organisation similar to the earlier League of National Security, which was established to counter a possible communist coup. He was the head of the organisation until ill health forced him to stand down in favour of Morshead in 1950.

===Promotion to field marshal===

Menzies became prime minister again in December 1949, and he resolved that Blamey should be promoted to the rank of field marshal, something that had been mooted in 1945. The recommendation went via the Governor-General, William McKell, to Buckingham Palace in London, which appeared to reply that a dominion officer could not be promoted to the rank. Menzies pointed out that Jan Smuts already had. The King&#x27;s Official Secretary, Sir Alan Lascelles, then claimed that Blamey could not be promoted to field marshal because he was a retired officer, which was not true. Menzies then restored Blamey to active duty. Blamey was duly promoted to field marshal in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours of 8 June 1950. He is the only Australian to attain the rank of field marshal.

A few days afterwards, Blamey became seriously ill and on 16 September 1950 received his field marshal&#x27;s baton from McKell in a bedside ceremony at the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital. Blamey died there of hypertensive cerebral haemorrhage on 27 May 1951. His body lay in state at the Shrine of Remembrance, where 20,000 people filed past. Crowds estimated at 300,000 lined the streets of Melbourne at his state funeral. Ten of his lieutenant generals served as pallbearers: Frank Berryman, William Bridgeford, Edmund Herring, Iven Mackay, Leslie Morshead, John Northcott, Sydney Rowell, Stanley Savige, Vernon Sturdee and Henry Wells. His body was cremated at the Fawkner Crematorium and Memorial Park.

==Legacy==

Blamey is honoured in Australia in various ways, including a square named after him which is situated outside the Russell Offices headquarters of the Australian Defence Force and Department of Defence in the national capital, Canberra. Blamey Crescent and Blamey Place in the Canberra suburb of Campbell are also named in his honour. A statue of Blamey stands in Kings Domain, Melbourne, on the corner of Government House Drive and Birdwood Avenue, opposite that of John Monash. It was sculpted from granite and bronze by Raymond B. Ewers and presented to the city in February 1960. Controversially, the statue portrays Blamey clutching half of a Jeep windscreen, rather than mounted on the traditional horse or simply standing. Blamey Barracks at Kapooka, where the Army Recruit Training Centre is located, is also named in his honour, as are Blamey Street and Blamey Park in North Ryde, New South Wales. His papers are held in the Australian War Memorial, where his field marshal&#x27;s baton is on display.

<doc id="1001574" wikidata="Q8005984" url="?curid=1001574" title="William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham">
<text>Sir William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham, [[Knight of the Garter|KG]] (1 November 1527 – 6 March 1597), lord of the Manor of Cobham, Kent, was Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and a member of parliament for Hythe. Although he was viewed by some as a religious radical during the Somerset Protectorate, he entertained Queen Elizabeth I of England at Cobham Hall in 1559, signalling his acceptance of the moderate regime.

==Biography==
William Brooke was the son of George Brooke, 9th Baron Cobham (d. 29 September 1558), and Anne Braye (d. 1 November 1558).

Before 1544, Brooke attended The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury and Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge. He spent much of his younger life in Europe. In the early 1540s, he visited Padua. By 1545, William Brooke married Dorothy Neville, daughter of George Neville, 5th Baron Bergavenny, but the marriage was unhappy, and they later separated after 1553. At the end of the decade, he served in northern France, where his father was in charge of Calais, and in 1549, he accompanied William Paget&#x27;s embassy to Brussels.

Like his father, Brooke sympathized with the anti-Marian nobles; he sided with the rebels during Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion, and the intervention of his brother-in-law, Henry Nevill, 6th Baron Bergavenny, was needed to keep him from prison. In 1555, he served as MP for Rochester.

In the late 1550s, Brooke&#x27;s opportunities expanded in a number of areas. His father died in 1558, when he was just over thirty, and he succeeded him as Baron Cobham. Soon after, his wife Dorothy died, and in 1560 at Whitehall, he was free to marry Frances Newton, the daughter of Sir John Newton of Barr&#x27;s Court, Gloucestershire. Brook became Warden of the Cinque Ports, a position in which he wielded great power over a large number of seats in Parliament. Most important, the accession of Queen Elizabeth I, and his close friendship with William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, made him a powerful noble. When Queen Mary I of England had died, it was Queen Elizabeth who had deputed him to inform Queen Mary&#x27;s husband, Philip II of Spain, of her death. This embassy was only the first in a long series of missions and intrigues. Along with William Cecil, he numbered among his friends some nobles, such as the Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Arundel, whose loyalty to Queen Elizabeth was far from certain. Brooke suffered some months&#x27; house imprisonment as a result of a very tangential role in the Ridolfi plot. In 1578, he joined Francis Walsingham&#x27;s failed mission to the Low Countries; on this mission, he presumably served as Cecil&#x27;s agent. In the late 1580s, he helped John Whitgift search for the author of the Martin Marprelate tracts.

Brooke was made a Knight of the Garter on 14 April 1585, and appointed to the Privy Council by 12 February 1586. He was involved in a minor capacity in the events that ended with the death of Mary, Queen of Scots. During the Armada crisis, he was on a diplomatic mission to Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma. In 1589, his eldest daughter Elizabeth married William Cecil&#x27;s youngest son, Robert Cecil, who would later be made the Earl of Salisbury. By the early 1590s, Brooke had assumed a less active role in government. In 1592, Brooke&#x27;s second wife Frances died. He succeeded Baron Hunsdon, as Lord Chamberlain in August 1596, and held the office until his death on 6 March 1597.

During his time, William Brooke built Cobham Hall, a Tudor style mansion that remained in his family until the mid-17th century.

==Marriages and issue==

William Brooke married firstly Dorothy Nevill (d. 22 September 1559), daughter of George Nevill, 5th Baron Bergavenny, by his third wife, Lady Mary Stafford, daughter of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham. Through her father, Dorothy was the second-cousin of his father, George Brooke. By his first wife Dorothy, he had a daughter, Frances Brooke (b.1549), who married firstly Thomas Coppinger (1546–1580), and secondly Edward Becher (born c.1545).

He married secondly Frances Newton, daughter of Sir John Newton and Margaret Poyntz. By his second wife Frances, he had four sons and three daughters:

*Sir Maximilian Brooke (4 December 1560 – July 1583), eldest son and heir, who predeceased his father, and died without issue.
*Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham (22 November 1564 – 24 January 1619), who married Lady Frances Howard (1566 – July 1628), daughter of Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, widow of Henry FitzGerald, Earl of Kildare, by whom he had no issue.
*Sir William Brooke (11 December 1565 – 1597) MP. Killed in duel.
*Sir George Brooke (17 April 1568 – 5 December 1603), who married firstly Elizabeth Burgh (died c. 1637), the eldest daughter and coheir of Thomas Burgh, 3rd Baron Burgh (d. 14 October 1597), by whom he had a son, William Brooke (1601–1643), and two daughters, Elizabeth Brooke and Frances Brooke.
*Elizabeth Brooke (12 January 1562 – 24 January 1597), who married Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, by whom she had issue.
*Frances Brooke (born 12 January 1562), who married firstly, John Stourton, 9th Baron Stourton (1553–1588), and secondly, as his second wife, Sir Edward More (1555–1623). 
*Margaret Brooke (2 June 1563 – 1621), who married, as his second wife, Sir Thomas Sondes of Throwley, Kent (1544–1593), by whom she had a daughter, Frances Sondes (1592–c.1634), who married Sir John Leveson (d.1613). 
The husband of Margaret Brooke, Sir Thomas Sondes, became convinced that her daughter Frances was not his child, and levied a fine of his lands, thus effectively depriving Margaret of her jointure, and died a few months later. His brother and heir, Sir Michael Sondes, honoured Margaret&#x27;s jointure, but the Sondes family never acknowledged her daughter Frances; and Margaret and Frances returned to Cobham Hall. Before he died in 1597, William Brooke made his second son Henry promise to care for his daughter Margaret, and she and her daughter remained at Cobham Hall on their own after his death. At an unknown date, Margaret went mad, and on 4 November 1602, it was reported that Doctor John Dee had been called in and &#x27;hath delivered the Lady Sondes of a devil or of some other strange possession&#x27;. Nothing further is known of her circumstances, apart from the fact that &#x27;the mad Lady Sondes&#x27; died in 1621, aged fifty-seven. Her daughter Frances had two daughters by Sir John Leveson, Christian and Frances. After Sir John Leveson&#x27;s death, Frances married, as his first wife, Thomas Savile, who later became Earl of Sussex. There was no issue from the marriage.

<doc id="1001596" wikidata="Q982586" url="?curid=1001596" title="Richard Williams (RAAF officer)">
<text>Air Marshal Sir Richard Williams, (3 August 1890 – 7 February 1980), is widely regarded as the &quot;father&quot; of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He was the first military pilot trained in Australia, and went on to command Australian and British fighter units in World War I. A proponent for air power independent of other branches of the armed services, Williams played a leading role in the establishment of the RAAF and became its first Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) in 1922. He served as CAS for thirteen years over three terms, longer than any other officer.

Williams came from a working-class background in South Australia. He was a lieutenant in the Army when he learned to fly at Point Cook, Victoria, in 1914. As a pilot with the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) in World War I, Williams rose to command No. 1 Squadron AFC, and later 40th Wing RAF. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and finished the war a lieutenant colonel. Afterwards he campaigned for an Australian Air Force run separately to the Army and Navy, which came into being on 31 March 1921.

The fledgling RAAF faced several challenges to its continued existence in the 1920s and early 1930s, and Williams received much of the credit for maintaining its independence, but an adverse report on flying safety standards saw him dismissed from the position of CAS and seconded to the RAF prior to World War II. Despite some support for his reinstatement as Air Force chief, and promotion to air marshal in 1940, he never again led the RAAF. After the war he was forcibly retired along with other World War I veteran officers. He took up the position of Director-General of Civil Aviation in Australia, and was knighted the year before his retirement in 1955.

==Early life and career==

Williams was born on 3 August 1890 into a working-class family in Moonta Mines, South Australia. He was the eldest son of Richard Williams, a copper miner who had emigrated from Cornwall, England, and his wife Emily. Leaving Moonta Public School at junior secondary level, Williams worked as a telegraph messenger and later as a bank clerk. He enlisted in a militia unit, the South Australian Infantry Regiment, in 1909 at the age of nineteen. Commissioned a second lieutenant on 8 March 1911, he joined the Permanent Military Forces the following year.

In August 1914, Lieutenant Williams took part in Australia&#x27;s inaugural military flying course at Central Flying School, run by Lieutenants Henry Petre and Eric Harrison. After soloing in a Bristol Boxkite around the airfield at Point Cook, Victoria, Williams became the first student to graduate as a pilot, on 12 November 1914. He recalled the school as a &quot;ragtime show&quot; consisting of a paddock, tents, and one large structure: a shed for the Boxkite. Following an administrative and instructional posting, Williams underwent advanced flying training at Point Cook in July 1915. The next month he married Constance Esther Griffiths, who was thirteen years his senior. The couple had no children.

==World War I==

Williams was promoted captain on 5 January 1916. He was appointed a flight commander in No. 1 Squadron Australian Flying Corps (AFC), which was initially numbered 67 Squadron Royal Flying Corps by the British. The unit departed Australia in March 1916 without any aircraft; after arriving in Egypt it received B.E.2 fighters, a type deficient in speed and manoeuvrability, and which lacked forward-firing machine guns. Williams wrote that in combat with the German Fokkers, &quot;our fighting in the air was of short duration but could mean a quick end&quot;, and that when it came to bombing, he and his fellow pilots &quot;depended mainly on luck&quot;. He further quoted a truism in the Flying Corps that &quot;if a new pilot got through his first three days without being shot down he was lucky; if he got through three weeks he was doing well and if he got through three months he was set&quot;. Williams and the other Australians were initially involved in isolated tasks around the Suez Canal, attached to Royal Flying Corps (RFC) units. No. 1 Squadron began to operate concertedly in December 1916, supporting the Allied advance on Palestine. Williams completed his RFC attachment in February 1917.

On 5 March 1917, shortly after commencing operations with No. 1 Squadron, Williams narrowly avoided crash-landing when his engine stopped while he was bombing the railway terminus at Tel el Sheria. At first believing that he had been struck by enemy fire, he found that the engine switch outside his cockpit had turned off. Within 500 feet of the ground he was able to switch the engine back on and return to base. On 21 April, Williams landed behind enemy lines to rescue downed comrade Lieutenant Adrian Cole, having the day before pressed home an attack on Turkish cavalry while under &quot;intense anti-aircraft fire&quot;; these two actions earned him the Distinguished Service Order, the citation for which reads:

He was promoted major in May and given command of No. 1 Squadron, which was re-equipped with Bristol Fighters later that year. &quot;Now for the first time&quot;, wrote Williams, &quot;after 17 months in the field we had aircraft with which we could deal with our enemy in the air.&quot; His men knew him as a teetotaller and non-smoker, whose idea of swearing was an occasional &quot;Darn me!&quot;.
In June 1918, Williams was made a brevet lieutenant colonel and commander of the RAF&#x27;s 40th (Army) Wing, which was operating in Palestine. It comprised his former No. 1 Squadron and three British units. As a Dominion officer, Williams found that he was not permitted to &quot;exercise powers of punishment over British personnel&quot;, leading to him being temporarily &quot;granted a supplementary commission in the Royal Air Force&quot;. Augmented by a giant Handley Page bomber, his forces took part in the Battle of Armageddon, the final offensive in Palestine, where they inflicted &quot;wholesale destruction&quot; on Turkish columns. Of 40th Wing&#x27;s actions at Wadi Fara on 21 September 1918, Williams wrote: &quot;The Turkish Seventh Army ceased to exist and it must be noted that this was entirely the result of attack from the air.&quot; He also sent Captain Ross Smith in the Handley Page, accompanied by two Bristol Fighters, to aid Major T. E. Lawrence&#x27;s Arab army north of Amman when it was harassed by German aircraft operating from Deraa. In November, Williams was appointed temporary commander of the Palestine Brigade, which comprised his previous command, the 40th (Army) Wing, and 5th (Corps) Wing. His service in the theatre later saw him awarded the Order of the Nahda by the King of the Hejaz. Twice mentioned in despatches, by the end of the war Williams had established himself, according to Air Force historian Alan Stephens, as &quot;the AFC&#x27;s rising star&quot;.

==Inter-war years==

===Birth of the Royal Australian Air Force===

Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours, Williams served as Staff Officer, Aviation, at Australian Imperial Force (AIF) headquarters in London, before returning to Australia and taking up the position of Director of Air Services at Army Headquarters, Melbourne. The Australian Flying Corps had meanwhile been disbanded and replaced by the Australian Air Corps (AAC) which was, like the AFC, a branch of the Army.

Upon establishment of the Australian Air Board on 9 November 1920, Williams and his fellow AAC officers dropped their army ranks in favour of those based on the Royal Air Force. Williams, now a wing commander, personally compiled and tabled the Air Board&#x27;s submissions to create the Australian Air Force (AAF), a service independent of both the Army and the Royal Australian Navy. Though the heads of the Army and Navy opposed the creation of an independent air arm for fear that they would be unable to find air cover for their operations, support from Prime Minister Billy Hughes, as well as prominent parliamentary figures including Treasurer Joseph Cook and Defence Minister George Pearce allowed the proposal to succeed. The AAF was duly formed on 31 March 1921; Williams deliberately chose this day rather than 1 April, the founding date of the RAF three years earlier, &quot;to prevent nasty people referring to us as &#x27;April Fools&#x27;&quot;. The &quot;Royal&quot; prefix was added five months later. Williams proposed an ensign for the AAF in July 1921, based on the Royal Air Force flag but featuring the five stars of the Southern Cross within the RAF roundel and the Commonwealth Star in the lower hoist quarter. This design was not adopted for the RAAF, the government employing instead a direct copy of the RAF ensign until 1949, when a new design using the stars of the Australian flag was chosen.

As the senior officer of the Air Board, Williams held the title of First Air Member, the nascent Air Force initially not being deemed suitable for a &quot;Chief of Staff&quot; appointment equivalent to the Army and Navy. He moved to consolidate the new service&#x27;s position by expanding its assets and training. Shortly after the AAF&#x27;s establishment, land was purchased for an air base at Laverton, eight kilometres (five miles) inland of Point Cook, and in July 1921 Williams made the initial proposal to develop a base at Richmond, New South Wales, the first outside Victoria. He also started a program to second students from the Army and Navy, including graduates of the Royal Military College, Duntroon, to bolster officer numbers; candidates reaped by this scheme included future Air Force chiefs John McCauley, Frederick Scherger, Valston Hancock and Alister Murdoch, along with other senior identities such as Joe Hewitt and Frank Bladin. As a leader, Williams would gain a reputation for strong will, absorption in administrative minutiae and, in Alan Stephens&#x27; words, a &quot;somewhat puritanical&quot; nature. He became known throughout the service as &quot;Dicky&quot;.

===Chief of the Air Staff===
The position of First Air Member was replaced by Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) in October 1922. Williams would serve as CAS three times over seventeen years in the 1920s and &#x27;30s, alternating with Wing Commander (later Air Vice Marshal) Stanley Goble. One motive suggested for the rotation was a ploy by Army and Navy interests to &quot;curb Williams&#x27; independence&quot;. Instead the arrangement &quot;almost inevitably fostered an unproductive rivalry&quot; between the two officers. Although in a legal sense the Air Board was responsible for the RAAF rather than the Chief of Staff alone, Williams dominated the board to such an extent that Goble would later complain that his colleague appeared to consider the Air Force his personal command.

Williams spent much of 1923 in England, attending the British Army Staff College in Camberley and RAF Staff College, Andover, followed by further study in Canada and the United States the following year. Goble served as Chief of the Air Staff in his absence. Shortly after his return in February 1925, Williams scuppered a plan by Goble to establish a small seaplane base at Rushcutters Bay in Sydney, instead organising purchase of Supermarine Seagulls, the RAAF&#x27;s first amphibious aircraft, to be based at Richmond. He was promoted to group captain in July and later that year drafted a major air warfare study, &quot;Memorandum Regarding the Air Defence of Australia&quot;. Considered prescient in many ways, it treated World War I ally Japan as Australia&#x27;s main military threat, and advocated inter-service co-operation while maintaining that none of the armed forces was &quot;purely auxiliary to another&quot;. Its concepts continue to influence RAAF strategy.

In 1926, Williams mandated the use of parachutes for all RAAF aircrew. He had visited the Irvin Air Chute Company while in the US during 1924 and recommended purchase at the time, but a backlog of orders for the RAF meant that the Australian equipment took almost two years to arrive. Flying Officer Ellis Wackett was assigned to instruct volunteers at RAAF Richmond, and made the country&#x27;s first freefall descent from a military aircraft, an Airco DH.9, on 26 May. Williams himself jumped over Point Cook on 5 August, having decided that it would set &quot;a good example if, before issuing an order for the compulsory wearing of parachutes, I showed my own confidence in them ...&quot; Though his descent took him perilously close to the base water tank (&quot;I thought it would be a poor ending to drown there, or even to be pulled out dripping wet&quot;) and &quot;too close to be comfortable to a 30,000 volt electric transmission line&quot;, he completed the exercise unscathed.
The young Air Force was a small organisation with the atmosphere of a flying club, although several pioneering flights were made by its members. Goble had commanded the first circumnavigation of Australia by air in 1924 while he was CAS. On 25 September 1926, with two crew members including Goble&#x27;s pilot, Ivor McIntyre, Williams commenced a round trip from Point Cook to the Solomon Islands in a De Havilland DH.50A floatplane, to study the South Pacific region as a possible theatre of operations. The trio returned on 7 December to a 12-plane RAAF escort and a 300-man honour guard. Though seen partly as a &quot;matter of prestige&quot; brought on by contemporary newspaper reports that claimed &quot;&#x27;certain Foreign Powers&#x27;&quot; were planning such a journey, and also as a &quot;reaction&quot; by Williams to Goble&#x27;s 1924 expedition, it was notable as the first international flight undertaken by an RAAF plane and crew. Williams was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1927 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours in recognition of the achievement, and promoted to air commodore on 1 July the same year.

As CAS, Williams had to contend with serious challenges to the RAAF&#x27;s continued existence from the Army and Navy in 1929 and 1932, arising from the competing demands for defence funding during the Great Depression. According to Williams, only after 1932 was the independence of the Air Force assured. Williams again handed over the reins of CAS to Goble in 1933 to attend the Imperial Defence College in London, resuming his position in June 1934. His promotion to air vice marshal on 1 January 1935 belatedly raised him to the equivalent rank of his fellow Chiefs of Staff in the Army and Navy. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June that year.

Williams encouraged the local aircraft industry as a means to further the self-sufficiency of the Air Force and Australian aviation in general. He played a personal part in the creation of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in November 1936, headed up by former Squadron Leader Lawrence Wackett, late of the RAAF&#x27;s Experimental Section. Williams made the first overseas flight in an aeroplane designed and built in Australia when he accompanied Squadron Leader Allan Walters and two aircrew aboard a Tugan Gannet to Singapore in February 1938.

A series of mishaps with Hawker Demons at the end of 1937, which resulted in one pilot dying and four injured, subjected the Air Force to harsh public criticism. In 1939 Williams was dismissed from his post as CAS and &quot;effectively banished overseas&quot;, following publication of the Ellington Report that January. Its author, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Edward Ellington, criticised the level of air safety observed in the RAAF, though his interpretation of statistics has been called into question. The Federal government praised Williams for strengthening the Air Force but blamed him for Ellington&#x27;s findings, and he was criticised in the press. Beyond the adverse report, Williams was thought to have &quot;made enemies&quot; through his strident championing of the RAAF&#x27;s independence. A later CAS, George Jones, contended that Ellington had been &quot;invited to Australia in order to inspect Williams rather than the air force and to recommend his removal from the post of Chief of the Air Staff if necessary&quot;. The government announced that it was seconding him to the RAF for two years.

==World War II==

When war broke out in September 1939, Williams was Air Officer in charge of Administration at RAF Coastal Command, a position he had held since February that year, following a brief posting to the British Air Ministry. Goble had succeeded Williams as Chief of the Air Staff for the last time but clashed with the Federal government over implementation of the Empire Air Training Scheme and stepped down in early 1940. Williams was recalled from Britain with the expectation of again taking up the RAAF&#x27;s senior position but Prime Minister Robert Menzies insisted on a British officer commanding the service, over the protest of his Minister for Air, James Fairbairn, and the RAF&#x27;s Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett became CAS. In his volume in the official history of the Air Force in World War II, Douglas Gillison observed that considering Williams&#x27; intimate knowledge of the RAAF and its problems, and his long experience commanding the service, &quot;it is difficult to see what contribution Burnett was expected to make that was beyond Williams&#x27; capacity&quot;. Williams was appointed Air Member for Organisation and Equipment and promoted to air marshal, the first man in the RAAF to achieve this rank.

Williams returned to England in October 1941 to set up RAAF Overseas Headquarters, co-ordinating services for the many Australians posted there. He maintained that Australian airmen in Europe and the Mediterranean should serve in RAAF units to preserve their national identity, as per Article XV of the Empire Air Training Scheme, rather than be integrated into RAF squadrons, but in practice most served in British units. Even nominally &quot;RAAF&quot; squadrons formed under the Scheme were rarely composed primarily of Australians, and Williams&#x27; efforts to establish a distinct RAAF Group within Bomber Command, similar to the Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s No. 6 Group, did not come to fruition. He was able to negotiate improved conditions for RAAF personnel in Europe, including full Australian pay scales as opposed to the lower RAF rates that were offered initially.

When Air Chief Marshal Burnett completed his term in 1942, Williams was once more considered for the role of CAS. This was vetoed by Prime Minister John Curtin and the appointment unexpectedly went to acting Air Commodore George Jones. A mooted Inspector Generalship of the Air Force, which would have seen Williams reporting directly to the Minister for Air, also failed to materialise. Instead Williams was posted to Washington, D.C. as the RAAF&#x27;s representative to the Combined Chiefs of Staff in the United States, and remained there until the end of the war.

==Later career==

In 1946, Williams was forced into retirement despite being four years below the mandatory age of 60. All other senior RAAF commanders who were veteran pilots of World War I, with the exception of the-then Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Jones, were also dismissed, ostensibly to make way for the advancement of younger officers. Williams regarded the grounds for his removal as &quot;specious&quot;, calling it &quot;the meanest piece of service administration in my experience&quot;.

Following his completion of duty in the Air Force, Williams was appointed Australia&#x27;s Director-General of Civil Aviation, serving in the position for almost 10 years. His department was responsible for the expansion of communications and infrastructure to support domestic and international aviation, establishing &quot;an enviable safety record&quot;. Williams&#x27; tenure coincided with the beginnings of the government carrier Trans Australia Airlines (TAA) and introduction of the Two Airlines Policy, as well as the construction of Adelaide Airport and redevelopment of Sydney Airport as an international facility.

Williams&#x27; wife Constance died in 1948 and he married Lois Victoria Cross on 7 February 1950. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1954 New Year Honours, the year before he retired from the Director-Generalship of Civil Aviation. He then took up a place on the board of Tasman Empire Airways Limited (TEAL), forerunner of Air New Zealand. In 1977, Williams published his memoirs, &quot;These Are Facts&quot;, described in 2001 as &quot;immensely important if idiosyncratic ... the only substantial, worthwhile record of service ever written by an RAAF chief of staff&quot;.

Sir Richard Williams died in Melbourne on 7 February 1980. He was accorded an Air Force funeral, with a flypast by seventeen aircraft.

==Legacy==

For his stewardship of the Air Force before World War II, as well as his part in its establishment in 1921, Williams is considered the &quot;father&quot; of the RAAF. The epithet had earlier been applied to Eric Harrison, who had sole charge of Central Flying School after Henry Petre was posted to the Middle East in 1915, and was also a founding member of the RAAF. By the 1970s, the mantle had settled on Williams. Between the wars he had continually striven for his service&#x27;s status as a separate branch of the Australian armed forces, seeing off several challenges to its independence from Army and Navy interests. He remains the RAAF&#x27;s longest-serving Chief, totalling thirteen years over three terms: October to December 1922; February 1925 to December 1932; and June 1934 to February 1939.

In his 1925 paper &quot;Memorandum Regarding the Air Defence of Australia&quot;, Williams defined &quot;the fundamental nature of Australia&#x27;s defence challenge&quot; and &quot;the enduring characteristics of the RAAF&#x27;s strategic thinking&quot;. Ignored by the government of the day, the study&#x27;s operational precepts became the basis for Australia&#x27;s defence strategy in the 1980s, which remains in place in the 21st century. His input to debate in the 1930s around the &quot;Singapore strategy&quot; of dependence on the Royal Navy for the defence of the Pacific region has been criticised as limited, and as having &quot;failed to demonstrate the validity of his claims for the central role of air power&quot;.

Williams&#x27; legacy extends to the very look of the RAAF. He personally chose the colour of the Air Force&#x27;s winter uniform, a shade &quot;somewhere between royal and navy blue&quot;, designed to distinguish it from the lighter Royal Air Force shade. Unique at the time among Commonwealth forces, the uniform was changed to an all-purpose middle blue suit in 1972 but following many complaints in the ensuing years reverted to Williams&#x27; original colour and style in 2000.

Memorials to Williams include Sir Richard Williams Avenue at Adelaide Airport, and RAAF Williams in Victoria, established in 1989 after the merger of Point Cook and Laverton bases. The Sir Richard Williams Trophy, inaugurated in 1974, is presented to the RAAF&#x27;s &quot;Fighter Pilot of the Year&quot;. In 2005, Williams&#x27; Australian Flying Corps wings, usually on display at the RAAF Museum in Point Cook, were carried into space and back on a shuttle flight by Australian-born astronaut Dr Andy Thomas. The Williams Foundation, named in his honour, was launched in February 2009 &quot;to broaden public debate on issues relating to Australian defence and security&quot;.

<doc id="1001598" wikidata="Q16226464" url="?curid=1001598" title="Smashie and Nicey">
<text>Smashie and Nicey are comedy characters who first appeared in the early 1990s TV sketch show &quot;Harry Enfield&#x27;s Television Programme&quot;. They were played by the comedians Paul Whitehouse and Harry Enfield respectively.

They are parodies of a certain style of ageing celebrity BBC Radio 1 disc jockey who started out with the station in the 1960s and stayed there until the mid-1990s. The characters incorporated the personalities, character traits and lifestyles of several different real-life DJs. The characters reference such DJs as Tony Blackburn, Dave Lee Travis, Simon Bates, Alan Freeman, Mike Read, Peter Powell, Noel Edmonds and Jimmy Savile.

Enfield&#x27;s parody of Radio 1&#x27;s increasing irrelevance to the youth audience it supposedly catered for was a factor in Matthew Bannister&#x27;s decision to terminate the employment of many older presenters when he became controller of Radio 1 in 1993.

The characters had their own TV special in 1994, following which Enfield retired them, reflecting the changes at Radio 1. However, they returned for Comic Relief in 1997. Whitehouse and Enfield also reprised their roles to present a special edition of &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; in 2007, commemorating the 40th birthday of Radio 2 following the death of Alan Freeman. They have been called &quot;one of the great comic creations of our time&quot;.

==Development==
Harry Enfield stated that his choice of characters for his show was a calculated move to gain the biggest possible audience by creating archetypes people could relate to. Whereas he aimed many of his characters at a young audience, Smashie and Nicey were created for a segment of the programme designed to appeal to &quot;older people&quot;. Enfield described them as &quot;a bit more highbrow&quot; than the other characters.

==Character profile==
Smashie and Nicey are Mike Smash and Dave Nice, two middle-aged disc jockeys at &quot;Radio Fab FM&quot; – a thin-veiled parody of BBC Radio 1 – who have both been with the station since the 1960s. During their initial appearances as recurring characters on &quot;Harry Enfield&#x27;s Television Programme&quot;, the pair host neighbouring mid-morning slots, with each sketch typically centering around the cliched and insipid banter during Smashie&#x27;s handover to Nicey&#x27;s show, with self-congratulory references to their charity work (which they pronounce as ). Every sketch ends with Nicey using an oversized fader to play his favourite (albeit dated) record &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothin&#x27; Yet&quot; by Bachman–Turner Overdrive, which he usually introduces with a bad pun on the band&#x27;s name. The characters&#x27; personalities were parodies of older BBC Radio 1 DJs of the time, who were widely perceived as being out of touch with the younger audiences that the station was intended to appeal to.

At the end of the second series, the new controller of Fab FM attempts to rejuvenate the station&#x27;s dated image by demoting Smashie and Nicey to a midnight graveyard slot on sister channel &quot;Radio Quiet&quot; (a parody of BBC Radio 2), with their usual morning shows being handed over to fresh-faced DJs Mark Baddier and Simon Christ (parodies of younger presenters of the time, such as Mark Goodier and Simon Mayo), who prove to be even more inane than their older counterparts. Smashie and Nicey are finally sacked from Fab FM in their TV special &quot;End of an Era&quot;, which effectively marks the end of their careers as mainstream radio personalities.

=== Mike Smash ===
Mike Smash (Smashie, played by Paul Whitehouse) is a bland and lightweight DJ who fills his airtime with terrible jokes and moronic observations of no consequence. Despite his chirpy personality, he is incredibly vain and egotistical, often viewing himself in Biblical proportions. Smashie disingenuously cultivates a humble, inoffensive public image, pretending that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t like to talk about&quot; his supposedly extensive charity work (instead preferring to pressure Nicey into regularly mentioning it) and claiming never to have used any intoxicating substances, which is contradicted several times by Nicey. He is also shown to enjoy teasing Nicey over his closeted homosexuality and comparatively unimpressive career. Smashie lives on a farm in Frensham, though he knows absolutely nothing about farming.

In &quot;End of an Era&quot;, Smashie is shown to be a lonely, maladjusted man-child who has no close friends and has never recovered from his troubled childhood and failed marriage. After being sacked from Radio Fab FM, he attempts to reinvent himself as a laddish TV presenter (in the style of Mark Lamarr and Terry Christian); remarries to a much younger trophy wife; and accumulates a net worth of £200 million through Bulgarian property holdings. In the 2015 stage show &quot;Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse: Legends!&quot;, Smashie and Nicey are both arrested during Operation Yewtree for historic sexual misconduct, though in his last appearance on UKTV Gold&#x27;s &quot;Smashie&#x27;s Xmastastic Playlist&quot;, it is claimed that Smashie is asexual and has &quot;never had any sexual thoughts ever&quot;.

=== Dave Nice ===
Dave Nice (Nicey, played by Harry Enfield) is a flamboyant, old-school DJ whose tastes are stuck in the 1970s, with a love of outdated classic rock. Nicey styles himself as straight-talking and down-to-earth, though his radio material is usually just as witless as Smashie&#x27;s. At times he is slightly more insightful and self-aware than Smashie, but still has a delusional sense of self-importance, believing himself to be of much greater cultural significance than he actually is. He becomes noticeably more opinionated as the characters progress, his views typically being insensitive and out of touch. Nicey often refers to spending time with various young male &quot;friends&quot;, but is still closeted. He lives in a huge mansion in Buckinghamshire, decorated with gaudy and tasteless art of himself.

In &quot;End of an Era&quot;, Nicey is revealed to be a miserable, self-loathing alcoholic, and drunkenly confesses that he actually despises Smashie. In later materials, his career declines considerably: he is reduced to a midnight slot &quot;Radio Antique&quot;, and DJs on Sundays at an ice rink in Penge. In &quot;Harry Enfield&#x27;s Television Programme&quot;, Nicey&#x27;s full name was Davenport Nice, but during a guest appearance on Pick of the Pops, it was claimed that he is actually of Russian Jewish origin and that his birth name was Davidovich Nicenstein. Following Smashie and Nicey&#x27;s arrests during Operation Yewtree, Nicey is said to be &quot;quite possibly in prison&quot; as of 2017.

==Appearances==
The characters first appeared in &quot;Harry Enfield&#x27;s Television Programme&quot; in 1990 and continued to appear in the second series and a 1994 special entitled &quot;Smashie &amp; Nicey: End of an Era&quot;.

The characters became very popular, appearing in adverts, featuring on their own compilation album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Rock&quot;, and presenting episodes of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, including the 30th anniversary special edition on New Year&#x27;s Day 1994. They were dropped by Enfield in 1995 after the changes at Radio 1 had removed the need for such satire, although they returned for Comic Relief in 1997.

Paul Whitehouse and Harry Enfield also reprised their roles to present a special edition of &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; on 30 September 2007, commemorating the 40th birthday of Radio 2 and following the death of Alan Freeman. Dale Winton made the opening announcement but was quickly evicted by Smashie and Nicey who proceeded to play the top 40 from 27 September 1967. During the show Nicey accidentally came out as gay (which was previously alluded to in the 1994 special, and may be an allusion to Alan Freeman&#x27;s admission, also in 1994, that he had been bisexual before he became celibate). At the end of the show, he emotionally begged the Controller of BBC Radio to give him a job, &quot;even if it&#x27;s only on [fictional station] Digital Radio 8&quot;.

Nicey briefly appeared in the 2015 special &quot;An Evening with Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse&quot;, revealing that he had been cleared of &quot;all but one of the charges&quot; by Operation Yewtree, echoing what had happened to Dave Lee Travis.

Whitehouse reprised the role of Smashie for a two-part special &quot;Smashie&#x27;s Xmastastic Playlist&quot;, which aired on Gold on 23 and 24 December 2017. It is revealed in these specials that Smashie is asexual.

===1994 TV special===

A TV special named &quot;Smashie and Nicey: The End of an Era&quot; was shown on BBC1 in 1994. The special begins in the 1960s, with Nicey presenting &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and dancing on stage with Freddie and the Dreamers in doctored footage of the band&#x27;s appearance on the show performing &quot;You Were Made for Me&quot;, interviewing The Beatles, and becoming a DJ on offshore station Radio Geraldine (Radio Caroline), where Smashie is initially his teaboy. It combines elements from the careers of several real DJs, with Smashie seen hosting a Saturday night TV show called &quot;Smashie&#x27;s House Party&quot;, a parody of &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;, and having turned his show into a plea for his wife (named specifically as &quot;Tessa&quot;) to come back after she has left him, repeatedly playing Bobby Goldsboro&#x27;s &quot;Honey&quot; (Tony Blackburn did this in the mid-1970s when his wife, actress Tessa Wyatt left him).

Nicey is revealed to have advertised &quot;Deptford Dralons&quot;, alluding to Alan Freeman&#x27;s ads for Brentford Nylons, to have interviewed the Sex Pistols (in doctored footage of their famous interview with Bill Grundy) and to have fronted &quot;The Dave Nice Video Show&quot;, a parody of &quot;The Kenny Everett Video Show&quot;. The duo are also said to have performed on the Band Aid single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;. Freeman himself makes a cameo appearance, as do Blackburn, David Jensen and John Peel. The programme was repeated on BBC Two in August 2015, however, some material (such as Smashie asking a member of the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; audience how old she was) was edited out.

==Influence on Radio 1==
The sketches proved popular, largely because they reflected the image that Radio 1 had at the time. Much of the station&#x27;s output was widely considered dull and unchallenging, and the average age of both listeners and presenters had risen above thirty, when it was intended to cater to a young audience.

When Matthew Bannister arrived at Radio 1 in 1993 with a mission to rejuvenate the station, he referred directly to the characters in stating that his goal was to rid it of its &quot;Smashie and Nicey image&quot;. Paul Whitehouse said he was congratulated by the then-BBC Director-General John Birt at a 90s award ceremony for assisting in the process of revamping Radio 1.
[Birt] said, &quot;Oh well done, thanks for giving me the idea about the DJs. Now I can get rid of them.&quot; And [Whitehouse] said, &quot;We actually quite like their rambling antics.&quot;

On 8 August 1993, Dave Lee Travis, one of the station&#x27;s DJs at the time, resigned on-air during his Sunday morning show stating that he could not agree with changes that were being made to Radio 1. Travis told his audience that changes were afoot that he could not tolerate &quot;and I really want to put the record straight at this point and I thought you ought to know – changes are being made here which go against my principles and I just cannot agree with them&quot;. He later commented on the characters in &quot;Q&quot; magazine, saying: &quot;This Smashie and Nicey crap that they keep bringing up. Is that funny? It doesn&#x27;t raise a smile with me.&quot;

<doc id="1001599" wikidata="Q487307" url="?curid=1001599" title="Iceboat">
<text>An iceboat (occasionally spelled ice boat or traditionally called an ice yacht) is a recreational or competition sailing craft supported on metal runners for traveling over ice. One of the runners is steerable. Originally, such craft were boats with a support structure, riding on the runners and steered with a rear blade, as with a conventional rudder. As iceboats evolved, the structure became a frame with a seat or cockpit for the iceboat sailor, resting on runners. Steering was shifted to the front.

Because of their low resistance to forward motion over ice, iceboats are capable of speeds exceeding . Because of their speed, iceboats are used both for recreation and for racing. Racing craft typically carry one person.

A related activity, land sailing, employs sailing craft similar to iceboats, but riding on wheels instead of runners.

==History==

The history of iceboating began in Europe in areas where smooth ice was found in the bays of the Baltic Sea and the canals of the Netherlands during the little ice age. Initially boats were used for commerce, but soon evolved into pleasure craft—&quot;ice yachts&quot;. Ice sailing came to North America, where the sailing craft evolved into recreational and racing versions.

=== Venues ===

Iceboating began in the 17th century as a documented means of transport on the frozen Gulf of Riga and the canals of the Netherlands into the 18th century. Ice boats carried cargo on Dutch canals during the 17th century.

The first iceboats were introduced on New York State&#x27;s Hudson River in the United States in 1790, where the practice flourished as a sport. The first recorded boat, built in 1790 by Oliver Booth of Poughkeepsie, was a square box atop three runners, the two forward runners being nailed to the box and the third acted as a rudder operated by a tiller. This type of craft was accessible to sportsmen of modest means.

In the mid-19th century, two &quot;ice yachting&quot; clubs had formed, the Poughkeepsie Ice Yacht Club (1865) and the Hudson River Ice Yacht Club (1870), where wealthy boat owners sailed large iceboats with up to seven crew members. Boats were as long as and sailed as fast as , a record exceeding any other conveyance in 1885, set by the &quot;Icicle&quot;. The first American Challenge Pennant occurred in 1881 on the Hudson river with five ice-yacht clubs competing. Races were sailed five times around a triangular course with one-mile legs, two of which were to windward. Iceboats were divided into four classes with sail areas ranging from less than 300 square feet to over 600 square feet.

By the beginning of the 20th century, iceboating had spread to Minnesota (Lake Minnetonka and White Bear Lake), Wisconsin (Lake Winnebago and Lake Pepin), Michigan (Lake St. Clair), and venues in Maine and Vermont. In Canada, there were venues on Lake Ontario (Kingston) and the Saint Lawrence River.

A European ice sailing club formed first in Sweden (1901), followed by the European Ice Yachting Union, which formed in 1928 with member states Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Sweden, Austria, and Germany.

=== Evolution of design ===

17th-century Dutch ice yachts consisted of flat-bottomed sailboats atop a cross-wise plank, resting on outboard metal runners, which carried the bulk of the weight of the craft. At the stern was a steering runner, attached to a rudder-like structure. to which are affixed four steel runners, one each at bow, stern and each end of the planking. These boats used conventional gaff mainsails and jibs, attached to the mast by travellers. A tiller or wheel stern controls the steering runner.

In the 19th century iceboats evolved into a box, riding on cross-pieces, supported by runners. These &quot;stern-steerer&quot; iceboats were generally rigged as sloops, with a jib sail forward of the mast, although the catboat style with a single sail was also used. In 1879 the archetypical Hudson River iceboat began to emerge. The &quot;Robert Scott&quot;, designed and built by H. Relyea, had a single backbone and wire guy-ropes. The mast on subsequent boats were stepped further forward than in the past with shortened jibs were shortened and the center of effort and resistance brought into balance, aligning both with the main runners. The shallow cockpit box became elliptical. A few &quot;Class A&quot; stern steerers with at least of sail area survived in to the late 20th century.

In the early 1900s some smaller iceboats, called &quot;scooters&quot;, were designed to traverse both ice and water with a shallow, oval hull on fixed runners. These sailing craft were steered by manipulating the sails, there being no rudder.The traditional stern-steerer boats were largely replaced by front steering boats in the 1930s, following the development of this style by Walter Beauvois of Williams Bay, Wisconsin in a boat named the &quot;Beau Skeeter&quot;. This boat led to the &quot;Skeeter&quot; class, and the &quot;Skeeter Ice Boat Club&quot; formed on Geneva Lake, Wisconsin. The Skeeter class adopted the logo of a mosquito on their sail, and has evolved into an aerodynamically clean machine. The Skeeter class is limited to just of sail.

In 1937, &quot;The Detroit News&quot; sponsored a new home-buildable ice boat design, which became the International DN. In 1968 Dick Slates of Pewaukee, Wisconsin designed and built the &quot;Nite&quot; with two wooden prototypes. The design was refined and fiberglass production began in 1970.

==Speed==

Iceboats designs dating from the mid 20th century onwards typically consist of a triangular or cross-shaped frame, supported by three skate blades called &quot;runners&quot;, with the steering runner in front. Runners are made of iron or steel with sharpened edges, which hold onto the ice, preventing slippage sideways from the lateral force of the wind developed by the sails, as they develop propulsive lift. Given their low forward resistance, iceboats can sail up to five times the speed of the true wind. Because the velocity of the iceboat (VB) is so much greater than the true wind velocity (VT), the apparent wind (VA) is only a few degrees from the direction of travel on most points of sail and the sail is close-hauled in each. VA is generated by the combination of iceboat velocity (VB) and true wind velocity (VT).

=== Attainable speeds ===

Different classes of iceboat can achieve speeds, as follow.

* International DN: .
* Skeeter: . 
* Classic iceboats: While claimed speeds for such craft have been as high as in the early 20th century, other sources cast doubt on both the technology for achieving and for measuring such speeds at those times.

=== Race courses ===

Because of the high boat speeds, iceboat race courses are established around fixed marks which are to be rounded in a one-way route, enhancing boat-to-boat traffic safety. The courses are a straight line upwind and downwind, which necessitates tacking upwind and jibing downwind.

==Classes==

Among the classes of iceboat are sailing craft that have associations in Europe and North America: IceOptimist, International DN, and Monotype XV. Others are regional in North America: Nite, Renegade, and Skeeter.

=== IceOptimist ===

The IceOptimist is a youth iceboat class that uses the sails and the rig of the International Optimist dinghy. The first design was built in Estonia in 1978, with scaled-down elements of a DN. In 2002, the class was registered under the guardianship of IDNIYRA Europe with the permission of IODA. World and European Championships are sailed each winter with a fleet of approximately 40 racers.

=== International DN ===

The International DN class is the most popular class in both North America, Europe and Asia. It is a one-person wood boat twelve feet long with a cross-plank eight feet long that carries a mast high. Modern competitive DNs use flexible masts commonly made of composite materials. The DN 60 derives its name from the 1937 request of &quot;The Detroit News&quot; for a high-performance, inexpensive, home-built iceboat design. Modern DNs share many one-design features with the original boat, including the basic aerodynamic fuselage design, runner configurations and of high-performance sail.

=== Monotype XV ===

The Monotype XV is a class of stern-steering iceboat based on a 1932 design by an Estonian, Erik von Holst. It may be single or double-handed. The One-Design class is built according to close specifications, little changed since the 1930s. It is the largest one-design iceboat class in Europe and the only double-handed iceboat class for which there are international championships. The is in length and width with a high mast.

<doc id="1001605" wikidata="Q3371537" url="?curid=1001605" title="Paul John Knowles">
<text>Paul John Knowles (April 25, 1946 – December 18, 1974), also known as The Casanova Killer, was an American serial killer tied to the deaths of 18 people in 1974, although he claimed at least 35.

==Early life==
Paul Knowles was born in Orlando, Florida, on April 25, 1946, to Thomas Jefferson Knowles and Bonnie Strickland. Knowles lived in foster homes before first being incarcerated at the age of 19. In early 1974, Knowles was serving time at Raiford Prison in Florida (now known as Florida State Prison) when he began corresponding with a divorcee named Angela Covic in San Francisco, eventually becoming engaged. His fiancée paid for his legal counsel and, upon his release, Knowles flew directly to California to be with her, but she called off the wedding. The woman said Knowles projected an &quot;aura of fear&quot; that terrified her. Knowles claimed to have murdered three people on the streets of San Francisco that night, but that has never been verified. Knowles returned to Jacksonville, Florida. He was soon arrested after stabbing a bartender during a fight, but he picked a lock in his detention cell and escaped on July 26, 1974.

==Crime spree==
After his escape from police custody, Knowles began a four-month, multistate crime spree. At the time, the crimes were not linked but after Knowles&#x27; capture authorities discovered he had recorded audiotaped confessions that he mailed to an attorney. These tapes were never released to the public, but were reviewed by a grand jury in 1975. The tapes, along with all transcripts, were destroyed &quot;after being ruined beyond repair in a flood of the Federal Courthouse in Macon,&quot; according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

* On the night of his escape from police custody on July 26, 1974, Knowles broke into the Jacksonville, Florida, home of 65-year-old Alice Heneritta Curtis and gagged her, ransacked her home for money and valuables, then stole her car. Curtis choked to death due to being gagged.
* In his taped confessions, Knowles claimed to have murdered a teenage girl named &quot;Alma.&quot; On December 21, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation identified this victim as 13-year-old Ima Jean Sanders, who disappeared on August 1, 1974, in Warner Robins, Georgia, and whose skeletal remains were found in April 1976.
* Knowles claimed to have kidnapped and killed 11-year-old Lillian Annette Anderson and 7-year-old Mylette Josephine Anderson outside of Jacksonville, Florida, on August 1, 1974. Although the girls&#x27; disappearance was never solved, investigators have said they believe this was a false confession 
* On August 2, 1974, Knowles met Marjorie Howie, 49, in Atlantic Beach, Florida. She was found strangled in her apartment and her television set was stolen. 
* On August 23, 1974, Knowles forced his way into the home of 24-year-old Kathie Sue Pierce in Musella, Georgia. Knowles strangled Pierce, but left her 3-year-old son physically unharmed.
* On September 3, 1974, 32-year-old William Bates was seen with a redheaded man at Scott&#x27;s Inn, a roadside pub near Lima, Ohio. Bates&#x27; wife reported him missing. Near the bar, police found Curtis&#x27;s vehicle abandoned but Bates&#x27; car was missing. In October, Bates&#x27; nude body was found. He had been strangled and dumped in the woods.
* Now driving Bates&#x27; car, Knowles bound and killed two campers, 62-year-old Emmett Alexander Johnson and 59-year-old Lois Mildred Johnson, at a rest stop near Ely, Nevada on September 18, 1974.
* 42-year-old Ebon Charlynn Hicks was reported missing by family on September 22, 1974. Her body was found discarded beside the road on September 25, 1975, near a rest stop outside of Seguin, Texas. Her vehicle was found at the rest stop. She had been raped and strangled.
* Knowles appears to have met 49-year-old beautician Ann Jean Dawson on September 23, 1974, in Birmingham, Alabama. It is unclear as to whether he abducted her or if she traveled with him willingly, but she paid the bills while they traveled together. Knowles claimed that he killed Dawson on September 29, 1974, and threw her body into the Mississippi River. Her remains were found in Mississippi on November 15, 1977, by two squirrel hunters.
* On October 16, 1974, 35-year-old Karen Wine and her 16-year-old daughter Dawn Marie Wine were both bound, raped and strangled after their Marlborough, Connecticut, home was broken into. The only thing found missing from their home was a tape recorder. Authorities say that Knowles was the perpetrator.
* On October 18, 1974, 53-year-old Doris Hosey was shot to death with her husband&#x27;s rifle. The gun was placed beside her body.
* Knowles picked up two hitchhikers in Key West, Florida and was stopped by a policeman. Knowles was driving a car stolen from victim Bates, but the officer let Knowles go with a warning. Shaken by the experience, Knowles dropped off the hitchhikers in Miami, Florida without harming them. Around this time, Knowles recorded audiotaped confessions to crimes, mailing them to a lawyer in Florida.
* On November 2, 23-year-old Edward Hillard and 20-year-old Debbie Griffin disappeared while hitchhiking near Macon, Georgia. Hillard&#x27;s body was found in nearby woods, while Griffin&#x27;s remains were found in Crawford County, Georgia on August 29, 1975. Knowles is reportedly suspected in their murders.
* On November 6, 1974, in Milledgeville, Georgia, Knowles befriended 45-year-old Carswell Hall Carr Sr. and was invited back to Carr&#x27;s house to spend the night. He stabbed Carr to death and strangled Carr&#x27;s 15-year-old daughter, Amanda Beth Carr, and attempted necrophilia with the teenager&#x27;s body.
* On November 8, Knowles met 45-year-old British journalist Sandy Fawkes in Atlanta. Fawkes said that he impressed her with his looks which were a &quot;cross between Robert Redford and Ryan O&#x27;Neal.&quot; The pair spent the next few days together, but Fawkes said Knowles was unable to perform when they attempted to have sex. They parted ways on November 10. The next day, Knowles picked up an acquaintance of Fawkes and demanded sex from her at gunpoint. She escaped and notified the police. When patrolmen tried to apprehend him, Knowles brandished a sawed-off shotgun and made his escape.
* Days later, in West Palm Beach, Florida, he invaded the home of invalid Beverly Mabee, where he abducted her sister, 32-year-old Barbara Mabee Abel, and stole their car. From there, he traveled to Fort Pierce, Florida, arriving the following night. As Barbara later publicized in her book &quot;ONE SURVIVOR&quot;, she was raped during her captivity before Knowles released her.
* On the morning of November 16, 35-year-old Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Charles Eugene Campbell recognized the stolen car near Perry, Florida. Knowles was able to wrestle the officer&#x27;s pistol away from him and, taking Campbell hostage, drove away in the patrol car. Knowles used the police siren to stop a 29-year-old motorist named James Meyer, putting both hostages in Meyer&#x27;s car. Knowles took the two men into a wooded area in Pulaski County, Georgia and handcuffed them to a tree before shooting each of them in the head at close range.

==Capture==
Shortly after murdering Campbell and Meyer, Knowles became involved in a car chase with Henry County Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy Charles Hancock. He eventually crashed the car through a police roadblock in Henry County, Georgia and Officer Jerry Key was injured when Knowles&#x27; stolen car crashed into his patrol car. Knowles escaped the vehicle on foot, firing several shots at the pursuing officers. A lengthy and chaotic foot chase ensued, with Knowles pursued by dogs, law enforcement officers from several agencies, and helicopters. Knowles was shot in the foot by Chief Detective Philip Howard during the foot chase, before finally being cornered on November 17, 1974, by David Clark, a 27-year-old Vietnam War veteran and hospital maintenance worker. Clark, who happened to be out hunting with a shotgun at the time, held Knowles at gunpoint until Henry County investigators Paul Robbins and Billy Payne arrived on the scene. Robbins and Payne arrested and handcuffed Knowles, who was outside of the perimeter established for the formal manhunt and might well have escaped if not for Clark&#x27;s intervention.

== Death ==
On December 18, 1974, Sheriff Earl Lee and Agent Ronnie Angel from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation were traveling down Interstate 20 with Knowles, who was handcuffed in the back seat. Their destination was Henry County, Georgia, where Knowles had, per a Georgia Bureau of Investigation press release, admitted to dumping a handgun he had taken from Florida State Trooper Charles Eugene Campbell, after killing him with it. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported, &quot;Knowles grabbed Lee&#x27;s handgun, discharging it through the holster in the process and while Lee was struggling with Knowles and attempting to keep control of the vehicle, Angel fired three shots into Knowles&#x27; chest, killing him instantly.&quot;

<text>Variable costs are costs that change as the quantity of the good or service that a business produces changes. Variable costs are the sum of marginal costs over all units produced. They can also be considered normal costs. Fixed costs and variable costs make up the two components of total cost. Direct costs are costs that can easily be associated with a particular cost object. However, not all variable costs are direct costs. For example, variable manufacturing overhead costs are variable costs that are indirect costs, not direct costs. Variable costs are sometimes called unit-level costs as they vary with the number of units produced.

Direct labor and overhead are often called conversion cost, while direct material and direct labor are often referred to as prime cost.

In marketing, it is necessary to know how costs divide between variable and fixed. This distinction is crucial in forecasting the earnings generated by various changes in unit sales and thus the financial impact of proposed marketing campaigns. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 60 percent responded that they found the &quot;variable and fixed costs&quot; metric very useful.

The level of variable cost is influenced by many factors, such as fixed cost, duration of project, uncertainty and discount rate. An analytical formula of variable cost as a function of these factors has been derived. It can be used to assess how different factors impact variable cost and total return in an investment.

==Examples==
Some common examples include sales commission, labor costs, and the costs of raw materials.

For a business which produces clothing, variable cost would include the direct material, i.e., cloth, and the direct labor. If the business uses a room, a sewing machine, and 8 hours of a laborer&#x27;s time with 6 yards of cloth to make a shirt, then the cost of labor and cloth increases if two shirts are produced, and those are the variable costs. The facility and equipment are fixed costs, incurred regardless of whether even one shirt is made. 

The amount of materials and labor that goes into each shirt increases with the number of shirts produced. In this sense, the cost &quot;varies&quot; as production varies. In the long run, if the business planned to make 0 shirts, it would choose to have 0 machines and 0 rooms, but in the short run, even if it produces no shirts it has incurred those costs. Similarly, even if the total cost of producing 1 shirt is greater than the revenue from selling the shirt, the business would produce the shirt anyway if the revenue were greater than the variable cost. If the revenue that it is receiving is greater than its variable cost but less than its total cost, it will continue to operate while accruing an economic loss. If its total revenue is less than its variable cost in the short run, the business should shut down. If revenue is greater than total cost, this firm will have positive economic profit.

==Variable costs over time==

Over a one-day horizon, a factory&#x27;s costs might largely consist of fixed costs, not variable. The company must pay for the building, the employee benefits, and the machinery regardless of whether anything is produced that day. The main variable cost will be materials and any energy costs actually used in production. However, over a six-month horizon, the factory will be better able to change the amount of labor to fit the desired output, either by using overtime hours, laying off employees, or hiring new employees. Thus, much of their labor becomes a variable cost - though not the cost of the managers, whose salaries are paid regardless of output. 

Over a five-year horizon, all costs can become variable costs. The business can decide to shut down and sell off its buildings and equipment if long-run total cost exceeds their long-run total revenue, or to expand and increase the amount of both of them if their long-run total revenue exceeds their long-run total cost, which would include their variable costs. It can change its entire labor force, managerial as well as line workers. 

Thus, which costs are classified as variable and which as fixed depends on the time horizon, most simply classified into short run and long run, but really with an entire range of time horizons.

<doc id="1001614" wikidata="Q2978740" url="?curid=1001614" title="Clayton Moore">
<text>Clayton Moore (born Jack Carlton Moore, September 14, 1914 – December 28, 1999) was an American actor best known for playing the fictional Western character the Lone Ranger from 1949 to 1952 and 1953 to 1957 on the television series of the same name and two related films from the same producers.

==Early life==
Born in Chicago, Illinois, on September 14, 1914, Jack Carlton Moore was the youngest of three sons of Theresa Violet (&quot;née&quot; Fisher) and Charles Sprague Moore. Moore&#x27;s father, according to the federal census of 1930, was a native of New York and supported his family in Chicago by working as a real estate broker. That same census also documents that a full-time maid, Amelia Hirsch, lived with the Moore family, an indication of the household&#x27;s relative prosperity at the time.

Highly athletic as a boy, &quot;Jack&quot; became a circus acrobat by age eight, and later, in 1934, he appeared at the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago with a trapeze act. He graduated from Stephen K. Hayt Elementary School, Sullivan Junior High School, and Senn High School on the far North Side of Chicago.

==Career==
===Modelling and acting===
Moore as a young man worked successfully as a John Robert Powers model. Moving to Hollywood in the late 1930s, he worked as a stuntman and bit player between modelling jobs. Moore, in his 1996 autobiography &quot;I Was That Masked Man&quot;, noted that Hollywood producer Edward Small persuaded him around 1940 to adopt the stage name &quot;Clayton&quot;. Subsequently, he was cast as an occasional player in B Westerns and the lead in four Republic Studio cliffhangers and in two films for Columbia Pictures.

===Military service===
During World War II, Moore enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces and served with that branch&#x27;s First Motion Picture Unit making training films, such as &quot;Target-Invisible&quot;, in which Moore co-starred with fellow actor Arthur Kennedy.

===&quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;===
In 1949, Moore&#x27;s work in the &quot;Ghost of Zorro&quot; serial drew the attention of George W. Trendle, co-creator and producer of a popular radio series titled &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;. The series&#x27; running plot involved the exploits of a mysterious former Texas Ranger, the sole survivor of a Ranger posse ambushed by a gang of outlaws, who roamed the West with his Indian companion Tonto to battle evil and help the downtrodden. When Trendle brought the radio program to television, Moore landed the title role. With the &quot;March of the Swiss Soldiers&quot; finale from Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot; overture as their theme music, Moore and co-star Jay Silverheels made history as the stars of the first Western written specifically for television. &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; soon became the highest-rated program to that point on the fledgling ABC network and its first true hit. It earned an Emmy Award nomination in 1950.

Moore was replaced in the third season by John Hart, reportedly due to a contract dispute, but he returned for the final two seasons. Moore later said he received no explanation from the producers as to why he was replaced or why he was rehired. The fourth season of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; was again filmed in black and white; however, the fifth and final season of the series was the only one to be shot in color. In all, Moore starred in 169 of the 221 episodes produced.

Moore appeared in other television series during his &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; run, including a 1952 episode of Bill Williams&#x27; syndicated Western &quot;The Adventures of Kit Carson&quot;. He guest-starred in two episodes of Jock Mahoney&#x27;s series &quot;The Range Rider&quot; in 1952 and 1953. Silverheels and he also starred in two feature-length &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; motion pictures. After completion of the second feature, &quot;The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold&quot;, in 1958, Moore began 40 years of personal appearances (including for the short-lived Lone Ranger Restaurants in Southern California), TV guest spots, and classic commercials as the legendary masked man. Silverheels joined him for occasional reunions during the early 1960s. Throughout his career, Moore expressed respect and love for Silverheels.

One of Moore’s personal appearances in character became the basis of a story that actor Jay Thomas told every year around Christmas beginning in 2000 on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Thomas was a radio disc jockey at the time in North Carolina and happened to be doing a show at a car dealership where Moore was appearing in character as The Lone Ranger. Moore had been stranded at the dealership, and Thomas offered him a ride back to his hotel. On the way, a passing motorist struck Thomas’ Volvo with enough force to break a headlight. Thomas gave chase and eventually cornered the man in a parking lot where he threatened to press charges. The driver of the other car taunted Thomas by saying nobody would believe his story, but Moore emerged from the back seat of the car — still wearing his costume — and said “they’ll believe &quot;me,&quot; citizen” to the stunned driver. With one exception, Thomas returned to Letterman’s show to tell the story every December until Letterman’s retirement.

====Lawsuit====
In 1979, Jack Wrather, who owned the Lone Ranger character, obtained a court order prohibiting Moore from making future appearances as The Lone Ranger. Wrather was in the process of making a new film version of the story and believed that Moore&#x27;s public appearances in character would undercut the value of the character and the film, and also advance any rumors that the 65-year-old Moore would be playing the title role in the new picture (which he did not).

Wrather&#x27;s move was disastrous. Moore responded by filing a countersuit and then slightly changed his costume, replacing the domino mask with a pair of Foster Grant wraparound sunglasses and participating in the company&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s that behind those Foster Grants?&quot; ad campaign. The public was strongly in favor of Moore, as evidenced when moviegoers stayed away from Wrather&#x27;s film. &quot;The Legend of the Lone Ranger&quot; was released in 1981, was panned by critics, and earned only $12 million at the box office, two-thirds of the film&#x27;s budget. The legal proceedings between Moore and Wrather dragged on until 1984, when Wrather suddenly dropped the lawsuit permitting Moore to again make public appearances as the Lone Ranger; Wrather died of cancer two months after dropping the suit.

====Moore &amp; the Lone Ranger====
Moore was often quoted as saying he had &quot;fallen in love with the Lone Ranger character&quot; and strove in his personal life to take The Lone Ranger Creed to heart. This, coupled with his public fight to retain the right to wear the mask, made Moore and his character inseparable. In this regard he was much like cowboy star William Boyd, who portrayed the Hopalong Cassidy character. Moore was so identified with the masked man that he (as the only person ) has his character&#x27;s name along with his own in the star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It reads: &quot;Clayton Moore — The Lone Ranger&quot;. He was inducted into the Stuntman&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1982 and in 1990 into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Moore was also awarded a place on the Western Walk of Fame in Old Town Newhall, California.

==Later life and death==
In 1964 Clayton moved to Golden Valley, Minnesota with his wife and daughter to be closer to his wife&#x27;s family in Minneapolis. He obtained a Minnesota real estate license, established Ranger Realty, and helped to develop the area that is now north of Interstate 394 near the Louisiana Avenue exit. During that time, he once came upon the scene of a crime and untied a grocery store manager shortly after the store had been robbed, apparently quipping: &quot;You have just been rescued by the Lone Ranger.&quot;

Clayton Moore died on December 28, 1999, in a West Hills, California, hospital after suffering a heart attack at his home in nearby Calabasas. He was survived by his fourth wife, Clarita Moore (&quot;née&quot; Petrone), and an adopted daughter, Dawn Angela Moore. Clayton Moore is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.

<text>Major Greenwood FRS (9 August 1880 – 5 October 1949) was a British epidemiologist and statistician.

==Biography==
Major Greenwood junior was born in Shoreditch in London&#x27;s East End, the only child of Major Greenwood, a physician in general practice there (&quot;Major&quot; was his forename, not a military rank.) and his wife Annie, daughter of Peter Lodwick Burchell, F.R.C.S., M.B., L.S.A. The Greenwood family is recorded back to the twelfth century in the person of Wyomarus Greenwode, of Greenwode Leghe, near Heptonstall, Yorkshire, caterer to the Empress Maude in 1154. Greenwood was educated on the classical side at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School and went on to study medicine at University College London and the London Hospital. On qualifying in 1904 he worked for a time as assistant to his father but after a few months he gave up clinical practice for good.

He went to work as a demonstrator for the physiologist Leonard Hill (father of the future statistician Austin Bradford Hill) at the London Hospital Medical College. Leonard Hill recalled, &quot;By recognising the ability of a student with nothing behind him to show his worth and by appointing him my assistant I may claim to have started Greenwood on his career.&quot; While Greenwood made a good start in physiological research he was already drawn to statistics; his first paper in Biometrika appeared in 1904. After a period of study with Karl Pearson he was appointed statistician to the Lister Institute in 1910. There he worked on a wide range of problems, including a study of the effectiveness of inoculation with the statistician Udny Yule. In the First World War Greenwood first served in the Royal Army Medical Corps but then was put in charge of a medical research unit at the Ministry of Munitions. There he investigated the health problems associated with factory work, one result of which was an influential study of accidents which he produced with Yule. In 1919 Greenwood joined the newly created Ministry of Health with responsibility for medical statistics. He co-authored a number of papers (see publications) with Ethel Newbold during his tenure there (and wrote a touching obituary for her on her early death in 1933). In 1928 he became the first professor of Epidemiology and Vital Statistics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine where he stayed until he retired in 1945. He established a group of researchers, of whom the most important was Austin Bradford Hill. Greenwood played the same role in A. B. Hill’s career as Hill’s father had played in his.

The Royal Society awarded the Buchanan Medal to Greenwood in 1927, and elected him a Fellow in 1928. The election certificate stated

Engaged in medical research. Has applied the statistical method to the elucidation of many problems of physiology, pathology, hygiene and epidemiology. Is the author, or joint author, of more than sixty papers dealing with these applications, including important contributions to the experimental study of epidemiology (Journ Hyg, 24, 1925, Greenwood and Topley; ibid, 25, 1926, Greenwood, Newbold, Topley and Wilson). Has done much to encourage and develop the use of modern statistical methods by medical laboratory investigators, and, as Chairman of the Medical Research Council&#x27;s Statistical Committee, to secure the adequate planning and execution of field investigations.
He was elected President of the Royal Statistical Society in 1934 and awarded its Guy Medal in Gold in 1945.

Greenwood produced a large body of research, was the first holder of important positions in modern medical statistics and wrote extensively on the history of his subject, but as Austin Bradford Hill wrote in his obituary, &quot;in the future, it may well indeed seem that one of his greatest contributions, if not the greatest, lay merely in his outlook, in his statistical approach to medicine, then a new approach and one long regarded with suspicion. And he fought this fight continuously and honestly—for logic for accuracy, for ‘little sums.’&quot;

His name is attached to the Greenwood formula for the variance or standard error (SE) of the Kaplan–Meier estimator of survival.

A statistical method invented by Major Greenwood in a statistical study of infectious diseases is still used in present-day research. The Greenwood statistic was used to discover that there is some kind of order in the placement of genes on the chromosomes of living things and this inspired a new look at epigenetics, which is now considered to be as important as genetics in how living organisms develop and evolve.

Greenwood lived at Loughton, where among his neighbours were Sir Frank Baines, Millais Culpin, and Leonard Erskine Hill.

<doc id="1001624" wikidata="Q234980" url="?curid=1001624" title="Vera Zasulich">
<text>Vera Ivanovna Zasulich (; – 8 May 1919) was a Russian socialist activist, Menshevik writer and revolutionary. She is widely known for her correspondence with Karl Marx, in which she put into question the necessity of a capitalist industrialisation prior to socialism, in the context of the fact that there already were living farmer communities in Russia that had developed practices and cultures that had a communist component.

== Radical beginnings ==
Zasulich was born in Mikhaylovka, in the Smolensk Governorate of the Russian Empire, as one of four daughters of an impoverished minor Polish nobleman. When she was three years old, her father died and her mother sent her to live with her wealthier relatives, the Mikulich family, in Byakolovo. After graduating from high school in 1866, she moved to Saint Petersburg, where she worked as a clerk. Soon she became involved in radical politics and taught literacy classes for factory workers. Her contacts with the Russian revolutionary leader Sergei Nechaev led to her arrest and imprisonment in 1869.

After Zasulich was released in 1873, she settled in Kiev, where she joined the Kievan Insurgents, a revolutionary group of Mikhail Bakunin&#x27;s anarchist supporters, and became a respected leader of the movement. As her lifelong friend and fellow revolutionary Lev Deich wrote:

:&quot;Because of her intellectual development, and particularly she was so well read, Vera Zasulich was more advanced than the other members of the circle... Anyone could see that she was a remarkable young woman. You were struck by her behavior, particularly by the extraordinary sincerity and unaffectedness of her relations with others.&quot;

== Trepov incident ==
In July 1877, a political prisoner, Arkhip Bogolyubov, refused to remove his cap in the presence of Colonel Fyodor Trepov, the governor of St. Petersburg famous for his suppression of the Polish rebellions in 1830 and 1863. In retaliation, Trepov ordered Bogolyubov to be flogged, which outraged not only revolutionaries but also sympathetic members of the intelligentsia. A group of six revolutionaries plotted to kill Trepov, but Zasulich was the first to act. She and her fellow social revolutionary Maria (Masha) Kolenkina were planning to shoot two government representatives: the prosecutor Vladislav Zhelekhovskii in the Trial of the 193 and another enemy of the populist movement. Following the Bogolyubov flogging, they decided that the second target should be Trepov. Waiting until after the verdict was announced at the Trial of 193, on 24 January 1878 they went for their respective targets. Kolenkina&#x27;s attempt against Zhelekhovskii failed, but Zasulich used a British Bulldog revolver and shot and seriously wounded Trepov.

At her widely publicized trial, presided over by the prominent liberal judge Anatoly Koni, the sympathetic jury found Zasulich not guilty, an outcome that tested the effectiveness of the judicial reform of Alexander II. On one interpretation, it demonstrated the courts&#x27; ability to stand up to the authorities. However, Zasulich also had a very good lawyer, who turned the case on its head so that it &quot;very soon became obvious that it was Colonel Trepov rather than his would-be assassin who was really being tried&quot;. That Trepov and the government now appeared as the guilty party demonstrated the ineffectiveness of both the courts and the government.

Fleeing before she could be rearrested and retried, Zasulich became a hero to populists and the radical part of the Russian society. Despite her previous record, she was against the terror campaign that would eventually lead to the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881.

== Move to Marxism ==
After the trial had been annulled, Zasulich fled to Switzerland, where she became a Marxist and co-founded the Emancipation of Labour group with Georgi Plekhanov and Pavel Axelrod in 1883. The group commissioned Zasulich to translate a number of Karl Marx&#x27;s works into Russian, which contributed to the growth of Marxist influence among Russian intellectuals in the 1880s and 1890s and was one of the factors that led to the creation of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in 1898. In mid-1900, the leaders of the radical wing of the new generation of Russian Marxists, Julius Martov, Vladimir Lenin, and Alexander Potresov, joined Zasulich, Plekhanov, and Axelrod in Switzerland. In spite of the tensions between the two groups, the six founded &quot;Iskra&quot; (&quot;Spark&quot; in English), a revolutionary Marxist newspaper, and formed its editorial board. They were opposed to the more moderate Russian Marxists (known as &quot;economists&quot;) as well as ex-Marxists like Peter Struve and Sergei Bulgakov and spent much of 1900–1903 debating them in &quot;Iskra&quot;.

== Menshevik leader ==
The &quot;Iskra&quot; editors were successful in convening a pro-&quot;Iskra&quot; Second Congress of the RSDLP in Brussels and London in 1903. However, &quot;Iskra&quot; supporters unexpectedly split during the Congress and formed two factions, Lenin&#x27;s Bolsheviks and Martov&#x27;s Mensheviks, Zasulich siding with the latter. She returned to Russia after the 1905 Revolution, but her interest in revolutionary politics waned. She entered the independent Yedinstvo-faction of her old friend Plekhanov in early 1914. As a member of this small faction, Zasulich supported the Russian war effort during World War I, whereas the Bolsheviks opposed the war. She opposed the October Revolution of 1917, stating that a &quot;premature revolution&quot; was &quot;worse than no revolution at all&quot;. In the winter of 1919, a fire broke out in her room. She was accommodated by two sisters who lived in the same courtyard, but she developed pneumonia and died in Petrograd on 8 May 1919.

In his book &quot;Lenin&quot;, Leon Trotsky, who was friendly with Zasulich in London in 1900, wrote:

Zasulich was a curious person and a curiously attractive one. She wrote very slowly and suffered actual tortures of creation... &quot;Vera Ivanovna does not write, she puts mosaic together, Vladimir Ilyich [Lenin] said to me at that time&quot;, and in fact she put down each sentence separately, walked up and down the room slowly, shuffled about in her slippers, smoked constantly hand-made cigarettes and threw the stubs and half-smoked cigarettes in every direction on all the window seats and tables, and scattered ashes over her jacket, hands, manuscripts, tea in the glass, and incidentally her visitor. She remained to the end the old radical intellectual on whom fate grafted Marxism. Zasulich&#x27;s articles show that she had adopted to a remarkable degree the theoretic elements of Marxism. But the moral political foundations of the Russian radicals of the &#x27;70s remained untouched in her until her death.

* &quot;Vera; or, The Nihilists&quot;. This was the first play by Irish writer Oscar Wilde, which is said to be loosely inspired by the life of Vera Zasulich. Though none of Wilde&#x27;s characters correspond to actual Russian people of the time, it has been suggested that the plot was inspired by Vera&#x27;s shooting of Trepov. The play was published in 1880 and first performed in New York in 1883.

<text>Power electronics is the application of electronics to the control and conversion of electric power.

The first high-power electronic devices were made using mercury-arc valves. In modern systems, the conversion is performed with semiconductor switching devices such as diodes, thyristors, and power transistors such as the power MOSFET and IGBT. In contrast to electronic systems concerned with the transmission and processing of signals and data, substantial amounts of electrical energy are processed in power electronics. An AC/DC converter (rectifier) is the most typical power electronics device found in many consumer electronic devices, e.g. television sets, personal computers, battery chargers, etc. The power range is typically from tens of watts to several hundred watts. In industry, a common application is the variable speed drive (VSD) that is used to control an induction motor. The power range of VSDs starts from a few hundred watts and ends at tens of megawatts.

The power conversion systems can be classified according to the type of the input and output power:
* AC to DC (rectifier)
* DC to AC (inverter)
* DC to DC (DC-to-DC converter)
* AC to AC (AC-to-AC converter)

== History ==
Power electronics started with the development of the mercury arc rectifier. Invented by Peter Cooper Hewitt in 1902, it was used to convert alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). From the 1920s on, research continued on applying thyratrons and grid-controlled mercury arc valves to power transmission. Uno Lamm developed a mercury valve with grading electrodes making them suitable for high voltage direct current power transmission. In 1933 selenium rectifiers were invented.

Julius Edgar Lilienfeld proposed the concept of a field-effect transistor in 1926, but it was not possible to actually construct a working device at that time. In 1947, the bipolar point-contact transistor was invented by Walter H. Brattain and John Bardeen under the direction of William Shockley at Bell Labs. In 1948 Shockley&#x27;s invention of the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) improved the stability and performance of transistors, and reduced costs. By the 1950s, higher power semiconductor diodes became available and started replacing vacuum tubes. In 1956, the silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) was introduced by General Electric, greatly increasing the range of power electronics applications. By the 1960s, the improved switching speed of bipolar junction transistors had allowed for high frequency DC/DC converters.

R. D. Middlebrook made important contributions to power electronics. In 1970, he founded the Power Electronics Group at Caltech. He developed the state-space averaging method of analysis and other tools crucial to modern power electronics design.

=== Power MOSFET ===

In 1957, Frosch and Derick were able to manufacture the first silicon dioxide field effect transistors at Bell Labs, the first transistors in which drain and source were adjacent at the surface. Subsequently, Dawon Kahng led a paper demonstrating a working MOSFET with their Bell Labs team in 1960. Their team included E. E. LaBate and E. I. Povilonis who fabricated the device; M. O. Thurston, L. A. D’Asaro, and J. R. Ligenza who developed the diffusion processes, and H. K. Gummel and R. Lindner who characterized the device.

In 1969, Hitachi introduced the first vertical power MOSFET, which would later be known as the VMOS (V-groove MOSFET). From 1974, Yamaha, JVC, Pioneer Corporation, Sony and Toshiba began manufacturing audio amplifiers with power MOSFETs. International Rectifier introduced a 25 A, 400 V power MOSFET in 1978. This device allows operation at higher frequencies than a bipolar transistor, but is limited to low voltage applications.

The power MOSFET is the most common power device in the world, due to its low gate drive power, fast switching speed, easy advanced paralleling capability, wide bandwidth, ruggedness, easy drive, simple biasing, ease of application, and ease of repair. It has a wide range of power electronic applications, such as portable information appliances, power integrated circuits, cell phones, notebook computers, and the communications infrastructure that enables the Internet.

In 1982, the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) was introduced. It became widely available in the 1990s. This component has the power handling capability of the bipolar transistor and the advantages of the isolated gate drive of the power MOSFET.

== Devices ==

The capabilities and economy of power electronics system are determined by the active devices that are available. Their characteristics and limitations are a key element in the design of power electronics systems. Formerly, the mercury arc valve, the high-vacuum and gas-filled diode thermionic rectifiers, and triggered devices such as the thyratron and ignitron were widely used in power electronics. As the ratings of solid-state devices improved in both voltage and current-handling capacity, vacuum devices have been nearly entirely replaced by solid-state devices.

Power electronic devices may be used as switches, or as amplifiers. An ideal switch is either open or closed and so dissipates no power; it withstands an applied voltage and passes no current or passes any amount of current with no voltage drop. Semiconductor devices used as switches can approximate this ideal property and so most power electronic applications rely on switching devices on and off, which makes systems very efficient as very little power is wasted in the switch. By contrast, in the case of the amplifier, the current through the device varies continuously according to a controlled input. The voltage and current at the device terminals follow a load line, and the power dissipation inside the device is large compared with the power delivered to the load.

Several attributes dictate how devices are used. Devices such as diodes conduct when a forward voltage is applied and have no external control of the start of conduction. Power devices such as silicon controlled rectifiers and thyristors (as well as the mercury valve and thyratron) allow control of the start of conduction but rely on periodic reversal of current flow to turn them off. Devices such as gate turn-off thyristors, BJT and MOSFET transistors provide full switching control and can be turned on or off without regard to the current flow through them. Transistor devices also allow proportional amplification, but this is rarely used for systems rated more than a few hundred watts. The control input characteristics of a device also significantly affect design; sometimes, the control input is at a very high voltage with respect to ground and must be driven by an isolated source.

As efficiency is at a premium in a power electronic converter, the losses generated by a power electronic device should be as low as possible.

Devices vary in switching speed. Some diodes and thyristors are suited for relatively slow speed and are useful for power frequency switching and control; certain thyristors are useful at a few kilohertz. Devices such as MOSFETS and BJTs can switch at tens of kilohertz up to a few megahertz in power applications, but with decreasing power levels. Vacuum tube devices dominate high power (hundreds of kilowatts) at very high frequency (hundreds or thousands of megahertz) applications. Faster switching devices minimize energy lost in the transitions from on to off and back but may create problems with radiated electromagnetic interference. Gate drive (or equivalent) circuits must be designed to supply sufficient drive current to achieve the full switching speed possible with a device. A device without sufficient drive to switch rapidly may be destroyed by excess heating.

Practical devices have a non-zero voltage drop and dissipate power when on, and take some time to pass through an active region until they reach the &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; state. These losses are a significant part of the total lost power in a converter.

Power handling and dissipation of devices is also critical factor in design. Power electronic devices may have to dissipate tens or hundreds of watts of waste heat, even switching as efficiently as possible between conducting and non-conducting states. In the switching mode, the power controlled is much larger than the power dissipated in the switch. The forward voltage drop in the conducting state translates into heat that must be dissipated. High power semiconductors require specialized heat sinks or active cooling systems to manage their junction temperature; exotic semiconductors such as silicon carbide have an advantage over straight silicon in this respect, and germanium, once the main-stay of solid-state electronics is now little used due to its unfavorable high-temperature properties.

Semiconductor devices exist with ratings up to a few kilovolts in a single device. Where very high voltage must be controlled, multiple devices must be used in series, with networks to equalize voltage across all devices. Again, switching speed is a critical factor since the slowest-switching device will have to withstand a disproportionate share of the overall voltage. Mercury valves were once available with ratings to 100 kV in a single unit, simplifying their application in HVDC systems.

The current rating of a semiconductor device is limited by the heat generated within the dies and the heat developed in the resistance of the interconnecting leads. Semiconductor devices must be designed so that current is evenly distributed within the device across its internal junctions (or channels); once a &quot;hot spot&quot; develops, breakdown effects can rapidly destroy the device. Certain SCRs are available with current ratings to 3000 amperes in a single unit.

== DC/AC converters (inverters) ==

DC to AC converters produce an AC output waveform from a DC source. Applications include adjustable speed drives (ASD), uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), Flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS), voltage compensators, and photovoltaic inverters. Topologies for these converters can be separated into two distinct categories: voltage source inverters and current source inverters. Voltage source inverters (VSIs) are named so because the independently controlled output is a voltage waveform. Similarly, current source inverters (CSIs) are distinct in that the controlled AC output is a current waveform.

DC to AC power conversion is the result of power switching devices, which are commonly fully controllable semiconductor power switches. The output waveforms are therefore made up of discrete values, producing fast transitions rather than smooth ones. For some applications, even a rough approximation of the sinusoidal waveform of AC power is adequate. Where a near sinusoidal waveform is required, the switching devices are operated much faster than the desired output frequency, and the time they spend in either state is controlled so the averaged output is nearly sinusoidal. Common modulation techniques include the carrier-based technique, or Pulse-width modulation, space-vector technique, and the selective-harmonic technique.

Voltage source inverters have practical uses in both single-phase and three-phase applications. Single-phase VSIs utilize half-bridge and full-bridge configurations, and are widely used for power supplies, single-phase UPSs, and elaborate high-power topologies when used in multicell configurations. Three-phase VSIs are used in applications that require sinusoidal voltage waveforms, such as ASDs, UPSs, and some types of FACTS devices such as the STATCOM. They are also used in applications where arbitrary voltages are required, as in the case of active power filters and voltage compensators.

Current source inverters are used to produce an AC output current from a DC current supply. This type of inverter is practical for three-phase applications in which high-quality voltage waveforms are required.

A relatively new class of inverters, called multilevel inverters, has gained widespread interest. The normal operation of CSIs and VSIs can be classified as two-level inverters, due to the fact that power switches connect to either the positive or to the negative DC bus. If more than two voltage levels were available to the inverter output terminals, the AC output could better approximate a sine wave. It is for this reason that multilevel inverters, although more complex and costly, offer higher performance.

Each inverter type differs in the DC links used, and in whether or not they require freewheeling diodes. Either can be made to operate in square-wave or pulse-width modulation (PWM) mode, depending on its intended usage. Square-wave mode offers simplicity, while PWM can be implemented in several different ways and produces higher quality waveforms.

Voltage Source Inverters (VSI) feed the output inverter section from an approximately constant-voltage source.

The desired quality of the current output waveform determines which modulation technique needs to be selected for a given application. The output of a VSI is composed of discrete values. In order to obtain a smooth current waveform, the loads need to be inductive at the select harmonic frequencies. Without some sort of inductive filtering between the source and load, a capacitive load will cause the load to receive a choppy current waveform, with large and frequent current spikes.

There are three main types of VSIs:

# Single-phase half-bridge inverter
# Single-phase full-bridge inverter
# Three-phase voltage source inverter

=== Single-phase half-bridge inverter ===


The single-phase voltage source half-bridge inverters are meant for lower voltage applications and are commonly used in power supplies. Figure 9 shows the circuit schematic of this inverter.

Low-order current harmonics get injected back to the source voltage by the operation of the inverter. This means that two large capacitors are needed for filtering purposes in this design. As Figure 9 illustrates, only one switch can be on at a time in each leg of the inverter. If both switches in a leg were on at the same time, the DC source would be shorted out.

Inverters can use several modulation techniques to control their switching schemes. The carrier-based PWM technique compares the AC output waveform, vc, to a carrier voltage signal, vΔ. When vc is greater than vΔ, S+ is on, and when vc is less than vΔ, S− is on. When the AC output is at frequency fc with its amplitude at vc, and the triangular carrier signal is at frequency fΔ with its amplitude at vΔ, the PWM becomes a special sinusoidal case of the carrier based PWM. This case is dubbed sinusoidal pulse-width modulation (SPWM).For this, the modulation index, or amplitude-modulation ratio, is defined as .

The normalized carrier frequency, or frequency-modulation ratio, is calculated using the equation .

If the over-modulation region, ma, exceeds one, a higher fundamental AC output voltage will be observed, but at the cost of saturation. For SPWM, the harmonics of the output waveform are at well-defined frequencies and amplitudes. This simplifies the design of the filtering components needed for the low-order current harmonic injection from the operation of the inverter. The maximum output amplitude in this mode of operation is half of the source voltage. If the maximum output amplitude, ma, exceeds 3.24, the output waveform of the inverter becomes a square wave.

As was true for Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM), both switches in a leg for square wave modulation cannot be turned on at the same time, as this would cause a short across the voltage source. The switching scheme requires that both S+ and S− be on for a half cycle of the AC output period. The fundamental AC output amplitude is equal to .

Its harmonics have an amplitude of .

Therefore, the AC output voltage is not controlled by the inverter, but rather by the magnitude of the DC input voltage of the inverter.

Using selective harmonic elimination (SHE) as a modulation technique allows the switching of the inverter to selectively eliminate intrinsic harmonics. The fundamental component of the AC output voltage can also be adjusted within a desirable range. Since the AC output voltage obtained from this modulation technique has odd half and odd quarter-wave symmetry, even harmonics do not exist. Any undesirable odd (N-1) intrinsic harmonics from the output waveform can be eliminated.

=== Single-phase full-bridge inverter ===


The full-bridge inverter is similar to the half bridge-inverter, but it has an additional leg to connect the neutral point to the load. Figure 3 shows the circuit schematic of the single-phase voltage source full-bridge inverter.

To avoid shorting out the voltage source, S1+, and S1− cannot be on at the same time, and S2+ and S2− also cannot be on at the same time. Any modulating technique used for the full-bridge configuration should have either the top or the bottom switch of each leg on at any given time. Due to the extra leg, the maximum amplitude of the output waveform is Vi, and is twice as large as the maximum achievable output amplitude for the half-bridge configuration.

States 1 and 2 from Table 2 are used to generate the AC output voltage with bipolar SPWM. The AC output voltage can take on only two values, either Vi or −Vi. To generate these same states using a half-bridge configuration, a carrier based technique can be used. S+ being on for the half-bridge corresponds to S1+ and S2− being on for the full-bridge. Similarly, S− being on for the half-bridge corresponds to S1− and S2+ being on for the full bridge. The output voltage for this modulation technique is more or less sinusoidal, with a fundamental component that has an amplitude in the linear region of less than or equal to one .

Unlike the bipolar PWM technique, the unipolar approach uses states 1, 2, 3, and 4 from Table 2 to generate its AC output voltage. Therefore, the AC output voltage can take on the values Vi, 0 or −V [1]i. To generate these states, two sinusoidal modulating signals, Vc and −Vc, are needed, as seen in Figure 4.

Vc is used to generate VaN, while –Vc is used to generate VbN. The following relationship is called unipolar carrier-based SPWM .

The phase voltages VaN and VbN are identical, but 180 degrees out of phase with each other. The output voltage is equal to the difference of the two-phase voltages, and do not contain any even harmonics. Therefore, if mf is taken, even the AC output voltage harmonics will appear at normalized odd frequencies, fh. These frequencies are centered on double the value of the normalized carrier frequency. This particular feature allows for smaller filtering components when trying to obtain a higher quality output waveform.

As was the case for the half-bridge SHE, the AC output voltage contains no even harmonics due to its odd half and odd quarter-wave symmetry.

=== Three-phase voltage source inverter ===


Single-phase VSIs are used primarily for low power range applications, while three-phase VSIs cover both medium and high power range applications. Figure 5 shows the circuit schematic for a three-phase VSI.

Switches in any of the three legs of the inverter cannot be switched off simultaneously due to this resulting in the voltages being dependent on the respective line current&#x27;s polarity. States 7 and 8 produce zero AC line voltages, which result in AC line currents freewheeling through either the upper or the lower components. However, the line voltages for states 1 through 6 produce an AC line voltage consisting of the discrete values of Vi, 0 or −Vi.

For three-phase SPWM, three modulating signals that are 120 degrees out of phase with one another are used in order to produce out-of-phase load voltages. In order to preserve the PWM features with a single carrier signal, the normalized carrier frequency, mf, needs to be a multiple of three. This keeps the magnitude of the phase voltages identical, but out of phase with each other by 120 degrees. The maximum achievable phase voltage amplitude in the linear region, ma less than or equal to one, is &#x27;. The maximum achievable line voltage amplitude is &#x27;

The only way to control the load voltage is by changing the input DC voltage.

=== Current source inverters ===

Current source inverters convert DC current into an AC current waveform. In applications requiring sinusoidal AC waveforms, magnitude, frequency, and phase should all be controlled. CSIs have high changes in current over time, so capacitors are commonly employed on the AC side, while inductors are commonly employed on the DC side. Due to the absence of freewheeling diodes, the power circuit is reduced in size and weight, and tends to be more reliable than VSIs. Although single-phase topologies are possible, three-phase CSIs are more practical.

In its most generalized form, a three-phase CSI employs the same conduction sequence as a six-pulse rectifier. At any time, only one common-cathode switch and one common-anode switch are on.

As a result, line currents take discrete values of –ii, 0 and ii. States are chosen such that a desired waveform is output and only valid states are used. This selection is based on modulating techniques, which include carrier-based PWM, selective harmonic elimination, and space-vector techniques.

Carrier-based techniques used for VSIs can also be implemented for CSIs, resulting in CSI line currents that behave in the same way as VSI line voltages. The digital circuit utilized for modulating signals contains a switching pulse generator, a shorting pulse generator, a shorting pulse distributor, and a switching and shorting pulse combiner. A gating signal is produced based on a carrier current and three modulating signals.

A shorting pulse is added to this signal when no top switches and no bottom switches are gated, causing the RMS currents to be equal in all legs. The same methods are utilized for each phase, however, switching variables are 120 degrees out of phase relative to one another, and the current pulses are shifted by a half-cycle with respect to output currents. If a triangular carrier is used with sinusoidal modulating signals, the CSI is said to be utilizing synchronized-pulse-width-modulation (SPWM). If full over-modulation is used in conjunction with SPWM the inverter is said to be in square-wave operation.

The second CSI modulation category, SHE is also similar to its VSI counterpart. Utilizing the gating signals developed for a VSI and a set of synchronizing sinusoidal current signals, results in symmetrically distributed shorting pulses and, therefore, symmetrical gating patterns. This allows any arbitrary number of harmonics to be eliminated. It also allows control of the fundamental line current through the proper selection of primary switching angles. Optimal switching patterns must have quarter-wave and half-wave symmetry, as well as symmetry about 30 degrees and 150 degrees. Switching patterns are never allowed between 60 degrees and 120 degrees. The current ripple can be further reduced with the use of larger output capacitors, or by increasing the number of switching pulses.

The third category, space-vector-based modulation, generates PWM load line currents that equal load line currents, on average. Valid switching states and time selections are made digitally based on space vector transformation. Modulating signals are represented as a complex vector using a transformation equation. For balanced three-phase sinusoidal signals, this vector becomes a fixed module, which rotates at a frequency, ω. These space vectors are then used to approximate the modulating signal. If the signal is between arbitrary vectors, the vectors are combined with the zero vectors I7, I8, or I9. The following equations are used to ensure that the generated currents and the current vectors are on the average equivalent.

=== Multilevel inverters ===

A relatively new class called multilevel inverters has gained widespread interest. Normal operation of CSIs and VSIs can be classified as two-level inverters because the power switches connect to either the positive or the negative DC bus. If more than two voltage levels were available to the inverter output terminals, the AC output could better approximate a sine wave. For this reason multilevel inverters, although more complex and costly, offer higher performance. A three-level neutral-clamped inverter is shown in Figure 10.

Control methods for a three-level inverter only allow two switches of the four switches in each leg to simultaneously change conduction states. This allows smooth commutation and avoids shoot through by only selecting valid states. It may also be noted that since the DC bus voltage is shared by at least two power valves, their voltage ratings can be less than a two-level counterpart.

Carrier-based and space-vector modulation techniques are used for multilevel topologies. The methods for these techniques follow those of classic inverters, but with added complexity. Space-vector modulation offers a greater number of fixed voltage vectors to be used in approximating the modulation signal, and therefore allows more effective space vector PWM strategies to be accomplished at the cost of more elaborate algorithms. Due to added complexity and the number of semiconductor devices, multilevel inverters are currently more suitable for high-power high-voltage applications.
This technology reduces the harmonics hence improves overall efficiency of the scheme.

== AC/AC converters ==

Converting AC power to AC power allows control of the voltage, frequency, and phase of the waveform applied to a load from a supplied AC system . The two main categories that can be used to separate the types of converters are whether the frequency of the waveform is changed. AC/AC converter that don&#x27;t allow the user to modify the frequencies are known as AC Voltage Controllers, or AC Regulators. AC converters that allow the user to change the frequency are simply referred to as frequency converters for AC to AC conversion. Under frequency converters there are three different types of converters that are typically used: cycloconverter, matrix converter, DC link converter (aka AC/DC/AC converter).

AC voltage controller: The purpose of an AC Voltage Controller, or AC Regulator, is to vary the RMS voltage across the load while at a constant frequency. Three control methods that are generally accepted are ON/OFF Control, Phase-Angle Control, and Pulse-Width Modulation AC Chopper Control (PWM AC Chopper Control). All three of these methods can be implemented not only in single-phase circuits, but three-phase circuits as well.
* ON/OFF Control: Typically used for heating loads or speed control of motors, this control method involves turning the switch on for n integral cycles and turning the switch off for m integral cycles. Because turning the switches on and off causes undesirable harmonics to be created, the switches are turned on and off during zero-voltage and zero-current conditions (zero-crossing), effectively reducing the distortion.
* Phase-Angle Control: Various circuits exist to implement a phase-angle control on different waveforms, such as half-wave or full-wave voltage control. The power electronic components that are typically used are diodes, SCRs, and Triacs. With the use of these components, the user can delay the firing angle in a wave, which will only cause part of the wave to be in output.
* PWM AC Chopper Control: The other two control methods often have poor harmonics, output current quality, and input power factor. In order to improve these values PWM can be used instead of the other methods. What PWM AC Chopper does is have switches that turn on and off several times within alternate half-cycles of input voltage.

Matrix converters and cycloconverters: Cycloconverters are widely used in industry for ac to ac conversion, because they are able to be used in high-power applications. They are commutated direct frequency converters that are synchronised by a supply line. The cycloconverters output voltage waveforms have complex harmonics with the higher-order harmonics being filtered by the machine inductance. Causing the machine current to have fewer harmonics, while the remaining harmonics causes losses and torque pulsations. Note that in a cycloconverter, unlike other converters, there are no inductors or capacitors, i.e. no storage devices. For this reason, the instantaneous input power and the output power are equal.
* Single-Phase to Single-Phase Cycloconverters: Single-Phase to Single-Phase Cycloconverters started drawing more interest recently because of the decrease in both size and price of the power electronics switches. The single-phase high frequency ac voltage can be either sinusoidal or trapezoidal. These might be zero voltage intervals for control purpose or zero voltage commutation.
* Three-Phase to Single-Phase Cycloconverters: There are two kinds of three-phase to single-phase cycloconverters: 3φ to 1φ half wave cycloconverters and 3φ to 1φ bridge cycloconverters. Both positive and negative converters can generate voltage at either polarity, resulting in the positive converter only supplying positive current, and the negative converter only supplying negative current.

With recent device advances, newer forms of cycloconverters are being developed, such as matrix converters. The first change that is first noticed is that matrix converters utilize bi-directional, bipolar switches. A single phase to a single phase matrix converter consists of a matrix of 9 switches connecting the three input phases to the tree output phase. Any input phase and output phase can be connected together at any time without connecting any two switches from the same phase at the same time; otherwise this will cause a short circuit of the input phases. Matrix converters are lighter, more compact and versatile than other converter solutions. As a result, they are able to achieve higher levels of integration, higher temperature operation, broad output frequency and natural bi-directional power flow suitable to regenerate energy back to the utility.

The matrix converters are subdivided into two types: direct and indirect converters. A direct matrix converter with three-phase input and three-phase output, the switches in a matrix converter must be bi-directional, that is, they must be able to block voltages of either polarity and to conduct current in either direction. This switching strategy permits the highest possible output voltage and reduces the reactive line-side current. Therefore, the power flow through the converter is reversible. Because of its commutation problem and complex control keep it from being broadly utilized in industry.

Unlike the direct matrix converters, the indirect matrix converters has the same functionality, but uses separate input and output sections that are connected through a dc link without storage elements. The design includes a four-quadrant current source rectifier and a voltage source inverter. The input section consists of bi-directional bipolar switches. The commutation strategy can be applied by changing the switching state of the input section while the output section is in a freewheeling mode. This commutation algorithm is significantly less complex, and has higher reliability as compared to a conventional direct matrix converter.

DC link converters: DC Link Converters, also referred to as AC/DC/AC converters, convert an AC input to an AC output with the use of a DC link in the middle. Meaning that the power in the converter is converted to DC from AC with the use of a rectifier, and then it is converted back to AC from DC with the use of an inverter. The end result is an output with a lower voltage and variable (higher or lower) frequency. Due to their wide area of application, the AC/DC/AC converters are the most common contemporary solution. Other advantages to AC/DC/AC converters is that they are stable in overload and no-load conditions, as well as they can be disengaged from a load without damage.

Hybrid matrix converter: Hybrid matrix converters are relatively new for AC/AC converters. These converters combine the AC/DC/AC design with the matrix converter design. Multiple types of hybrid converters have been developed in this new category, an example being a converter that uses uni-directional switches and two converter stages without the dc-link; without the capacitors or inductors needed for a dc-link, the weight and size of the converter is reduced. Two sub-categories exist from the hybrid converters, named hybrid direct matrix converter (HDMC) and hybrid indirect matrix converter (HIMC). HDMC convert the voltage and current in one stage, while the HIMC utilizes separate stages, like the AC/DC/AC converter, but without the use of an intermediate storage element.

Applications: Below is a list of common applications that each converter is used in.
* AC voltage controller: Lighting control; domestic and industrial heating; speed control of fan, pump or hoist drives, soft starting of induction motors, static AC switches (temperature control, transformer tap changing, etc.)
* Cycloconverter: High-power low-speed reversible AC motor drives; constant frequency power supply with variable input frequency; controllable VAR generators for power factor correction; AC system interties linking two independent power systems.
* Matrix converter: Currently the application of matrix converters are limited due to the non-availability of bilateral monolithic switches capable of operating at high frequency, complex control law implementation, commutation, and other reasons. With these developments, matrix converters could replace cycloconverters in many areas.
* DC link: Can be used for individual or multiple load applications of machine building and construction.

== Simulations of power electronic systems ==

Power electronic circuits are simulated using computer simulation programs such as SIMBA, PLECS, PSIM, SPICE, MATLAB/simulink, and OpenModelica. Circuits are simulated before they are produced to test how the circuits respond under certain conditions. Also, creating a simulation is both cheaper and faster than creating a prototype to use for testing.

== Applications ==

Applications of power electronics range in size from a switched mode power supply in an AC adapter, battery chargers, audio amplifiers, fluorescent lamp ballasts, through variable frequency drives and DC motor drives used to operate pumps, fans, and manufacturing machinery, up to gigawatt-scale high voltage direct current power transmission systems used to interconnect electrical grids. Power electronic systems are found in virtually every electronic device. For example:
* DC/DC converters are used in most mobile devices (mobile phones, PDA etc.) to maintain the voltage at a fixed value whatever the voltage level of the battery is. These converters are also used for electronic isolation and power factor correction. A power optimizer is a type of DC/DC converter developed to maximize the energy harvest from solar photovoltaic or wind turbine systems.
* AC/DC converters (rectifiers) are used every time an electronic device is connected to the mains (computer, television etc.). These may simply change AC to DC or can also change the voltage level as part of their operation.
* AC/AC converters are used to change either the voltage level or the frequency (international power adapters, light dimmer). In power distribution networks, AC/AC converters may be used to exchange power between utility frequency 50 Hz and 60 Hz power grids.
* DC/AC converters (inverters) are used primarily in UPS or renewable energy systems or emergency lighting systems. Mains power charges the DC battery. If the mains fails, an inverter produces AC electricity at mains voltage from the DC battery. Solar inverter, both smaller string and larger central inverters, as well as solar micro-inverter are used in photovoltaics as a component of a PV system.

Motor drives are found in pumps, blowers, and mill drives for textile, paper, cement and other such facilities. Drives may be used for power conversion and for motion control. For AC motors, applications include variable-frequency drives, motor soft starters and excitation systems.

In hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), power electronics are used in two formats: series hybrid and parallel hybrid. The difference between a series hybrid and a parallel hybrid is the relationship of the electric motor to the internal combustion engine (ICE). Devices used in electric vehicles consist mostly of dc/dc converters for battery charging and dc/ac converters to power the propulsion motor. Electric trains use power electronic devices to obtain power, as well as for vector control using pulse-width modulation (PWM) rectifiers. The trains obtain their power from power lines. Another new usage for power electronics is in elevator systems. These systems may use thyristors, inverters, permanent magnet motors, or various hybrid systems that incorporate PWM systems and standard motors.

=== Inverters ===

In general, inverters are utilized in applications requiring direct conversion of electrical energy from DC to AC or indirect conversion from AC to AC. DC to AC conversion is useful for many fields, including power conditioning, harmonic compensation, motor drives, renewable energy grid integration, and spacecraft solar power systems.

In power systems it is often desired to eliminate harmonic content found in line currents. VSIs can be used as active power filters to provide this compensation. Based on measured line currents and voltages, a control system determines reference current signals for each phase. This is fed back through an outer loop and subtracted from actual current signals to create current signals for an inner loop to the inverter. These signals then cause the inverter to generate output currents that compensate for the harmonic content. This configuration requires no real power consumption, as it is fully fed by the line; the DC link is simply a capacitor that is kept at a constant voltage by the control system. In this configuration, output currents are in phase with line voltages to produce a unity power factor. Conversely, VAR compensation is possible in a similar configuration where output currents lead line voltages to improve the overall power factor.

In facilities that require energy at all times, such as hospitals and airports, UPS systems are utilized. In a standby system, an inverter is brought online when the normally supplying grid is interrupted. Power is instantaneously drawn from onsite batteries and converted into usable AC voltage by the VSI, until grid power is restored, or until backup generators are brought online. In an online UPS system, a rectifier-DC-link-inverter is used to protect the load from transients and harmonic content. A battery in parallel with the DC-link is kept fully charged by the output in case the grid power is interrupted, while the output of the inverter is fed through a low pass filter to the load. High power quality and independence from disturbances is achieved.

Various AC motor drives have been developed for speed, torque, and position control of AC motors. These drives can be categorized as low-performance or as high-performance, based on whether they are scalar-controlled or vector-controlled, respectively. In scalar-controlled drives, fundamental stator current, or voltage frequency and amplitude, are the only controllable quantities. Therefore, these drives are employed in applications where high quality control is not required, such as fans and compressors. On the other hand, vector-controlled drives allow for instantaneous current and voltage values to be controlled continuously. This high performance is necessary for applications such as elevators and electric cars.

Inverters are also vital to many renewable energy applications. In photovoltaic purposes, the inverter, which is usually a PWM VSI, gets fed by the DC electrical energy output of a photovoltaic module or array. The inverter then converts this into an AC voltage to be interfaced with either a load or the utility grid. Inverters may also be employed in other renewable systems, such as wind turbines. In these applications, the turbine speed usually varies, causing changes in voltage frequency and sometimes in the magnitude. In this case, the generated voltage can be rectified and then inverted to stabilize frequency and magnitude.

=== Smart grid ===

A smart grid is a modernized electrical grid that uses information and communications technology to gather and act on information, such as information about the behaviors of suppliers and consumers, in an automated fashion to improve the efficiency, reliability, economics, and sustainability of the production and distribution of electricity.

Electric power generated by wind turbines and hydroelectric turbines by using induction generators can cause variances in the frequency at which power is generated. Power electronic devices are utilized in these systems to convert the generated ac voltages into high-voltage direct current (HVDC). The HVDC power can be more easily converted into three phase power that is coherent with the power associated to the existing power grid. Through these devices, the power delivered by these systems is cleaner and has a higher associated power factor. Wind power systems optimum torque is obtained either through a gearbox or direct drive technologies that can reduce the size of the power electronics device.

Electric power can be generated through photovoltaic cells by using power electronic devices. The produced power is usually then transformed by solar inverters. Inverters are divided into three different types: central, module-integrated, and string. Central converters can be connected either in parallel or in series on the DC side of the system. For photovoltaic &quot;farms&quot;, a single central converter is used for the entire system. Module-integrated converters are connected in series on either the DC or AC side. Normally several modules are used within a photovoltaic system, since the system requires these converters on both DC and AC terminals. A string converter is used in a system that utilizes photovoltaic cells that are facing different directions. It is used to convert the power generated to each string, or line, in which the photovoltaic cells are interacting.

Power electronics can be used to help utilities adapt to the rapid increase in distributed residential/commercial solar power generation. Germany and parts of Hawaii, California, and New Jersey require costly studies to be conducted before approving new solar installations. Relatively small-scale ground- or pole-mounted devices create the potential for a distributed control infrastructure to monitor and manage the flow of power. Traditional electromechanical systems, such as capacitor banks or voltage regulators at substations, can take minutes to adjust voltage and can be distant from the solar installations where the problems originate. If voltage on a neighborhood circuit goes too high, it can endanger utility crews and cause damage to both utility and customer equipment. Further, a grid fault causes photovoltaic generators to shut down immediately, spiking the demand for grid power. Smart grid-based regulators are more controllable than far more numerous consumer devices.

In another approach, a group of 16 western utilities called the Western Electric Industry Leaders called for the mandatory use of &quot;smart inverters.&quot; These devices convert DC to household AC and can also help with power quality. Such devices could eliminate the need for expensive utility equipment upgrades at a much lower total cost.

<doc id="1001636" wikidata="Q2100784" url="?curid=1001636" title="Point Pleasant Park">
<text>Point Pleasant Park is a large, mainly forested municipal park at the southern tip of the Halifax peninsula. It once hosted several artillery batteries, and still contains the Prince of Wales Tower - the oldest Martello tower in North America (1796). The park is a popular recreational spot for Haligonians, as it hosts forest walks and affords views across the harbour and out toward the Atlantic.

Plays are performed in the park every summer by a professional theatre company called Shakespeare by the Sea. The performances take place at Cambridge Battery, and include both Shakespearean productions and original musicals based on classic fairy tales for audiences of all ages. The company also operates the 80-seat Park Place Theatre in the lower parking lot of the park, which is used as a rain venue during the summer, and for fall/winter indoor productions.

Point Pleasant Park originally was owned by the British government and was leased to the City of Halifax for a ceremonial 1 shilling per year. The original lease for the land was negotiated by Sir William Young in 1866. The park is now owned by the Government of Canada and is leased to the Halifax Regional Municipality. The lease for the park is administered on behalf of the Government of Canada by the Parks Canada Agency.

==History==

===18th-19th century===

==== St. Aspinquid Chapel ====
St. Aspinquid&#x27;s Chapel was established by a French missionary, Louis-Pierre Thury, at Chebucto (present day Halifax, Nova Scotia) in the late 17th century. The chapel is a natural stone amphitheatre located by Chain Rock Battery on the Northwest Arm at Point Pleasant Park. There are numerous notable people who were interred in the burial grounds around the chapel. The chapel was also the location of the Mi’kmaq celebration the Feast of St. Aspinquid (St. Aspinquid&#x27;s Day), which was conducted through much of the 18th century. The Chapel is also the site of a battle during the French and Indian War between two Mi&#x27;kmaq chiefs (1760).

==== Establishing Halifax ====
In 1749, Edward Cornwallis arrived under instruction of the British Government to create a sizeable military and civilian settlement of 4000 in Halifax which sparked Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War. He first settled Point Pleasant Park but then, being too exposed to the elements, moved the settlement below Citadel Hill. Halifax was to become a strategic settlement for the British and fortifications were primarily intended to prevent enemy ships from getting into the Halifax Harbour. Fortifications began to be constructed at present-day Point Pleasant Park toward the end of the French and Indian War.

There were a total of seven fortifications constructed: Chain Rock, Chain Battery, Point Pleasant Battery, Northwest Arm Battery, Fort Ogilvie, Prince of Wales Tower and Cambridge Battery. Most were rebuilt or modified four or five times over the subsequent 200 years.

==== French and Indian War ====
There were four defences that were constructed during the French and Indian War: Chain Battery, Chain Rock, Point Pleasant Battery and Northwest Arm Battery. The defences were built of logs, earth, and stone. They were built with wood-burning fireplaces, and furnaces were later added for smelting cannon shot. Chain Battery and Chain Rock were basic fortifications built on the natural terrain to protect the Northwest Arm. Unlike most of the other fortifications, the battery here was not rebuilt in the 19th century, so it retains its original 1762 layout. Because it was abandoned so early, the area has been reforested for most of the historic period. Point Pleasant Battery is one of the oldest fortification batteries. Though Point Pleasant Battery was first constructed in 1762, what is visible today dates mostly from the early 20th century. The fourth battery - the Northwest Arm Battery - was built during the war, just west of Point Pleasant, was damaged in 1895 and was falling into the sea. It was moved further along the Northwest Arm shore. Northwest Arm Battery was first built in 1762 and disused after the 1860s. Archeological remains associated with its barracks include a summer house built for the Park in the 1880s. The battery here retains its early 19th century configuration.

==== French Revolutionary Wars ====

In 1792, during the French Revolutionary Wars, the threat of an immediate French attack alerted the British military in Halifax to the possibility of a landing in the harbour and batteries were upgraded and improved. Fort Ogilvie was built at this time and is located in the eastern part of Point Pleasant Park. It was built by the order of General Ogilvie, then commander of the Halifax garrison. Ogilvie named the battery after himself.

In 1796-97, a battery was built on high ground behind the point at a location capable of defending the point batteries. A few years later, the battery was converted to a large round stone tower known as the Prince of Wales Tower, similar to the Martello Towers built in large numbers elsewhere by the British military. The Prince of Wales Tower is 26 feet high and is 72 feet in diameter. The exposed material is ironstone rubble masonry, with walls. The original construction permitted six mounted guns on the roof and four guns on the second storey.

Further modifications were made over the next seventy years. By 1813, the Tower mounted four 6-pound guns on garrison carriages on its barrack level, two 24-pound guns on traversing platforms and six 24-pound carronades on traversing slides on top. After 1864, the Tower was used as a self-defensible depot magazine.

The park was the site of several small farms during the early settlement of Halifax. A rock outcropping at Black Rock Beach was used to gibbet the bodies of executed criminal such as the pirate Edward Jordan in 1809.

Cambridge Battery is situated back from the Point Pleasant and Northwest Arm batteries along the shore. It was approved in 1862 and completed in 1868. The battery was named in honour of the Duke of Cambridge, who was the head of the military during much of Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign.

=== 20th century ===

The Cambridge Battery was abandoned by the time of the First World War.

In 1929, the military temporarily vacated the park before returning in 1938 during the Second World War. Although the Martello tower ceased to be important for military purposes in the late 19th century, some of the other fortifications in the Park continued to be used by the military until the close of the Second World War. Fort Ogilvie and Cambridge Battery were upgraded with modern weapons during the Second World War. A gun from this era is still visible at Fort Ogilvie.

Small amounts of stone were quarried in the park in the 19th century, the small quarries today forming a pond near the park entrance. In the 1920s, the Halifax streetcar line was extended into the park as far as the Prince of Wales Tower but the route was abandoned in the 1940s.

The park was the target of a &quot;group&quot; calling itself &quot;Loki 7&quot; in 1994, when they planted a pipe bomb in a garbage bin. Nobody was injured.

In 1943 a large Canadian steamship, SS Point Pleasant Park, was named after the park. The mayor of Halifax presented the ship&#x27;s captain with a framed picture of the Yonge Street gate which was displayed in the dining room aboard the ship until it was torpedoed in 1945.

In 2000 the Canadian Food Inspection Agency planned to cut 10,000 trees to halt an outbreak of brown spruce longhorn beetles (&quot;Tetropium fuscum&quot;). This plan was challenged by the Friends of Pt. Pleasant Park in the courts, which resulted in a temporary injunction stopping the cutting. The injunction was later removed but there was a reduction in tree cutting to less than 2000.

===21st century===
In September 2003, Point Pleasant Park was devastated by Hurricane Juan. Nearly three quarters of the park&#x27;s trees were knocked down and the park remained closed until June 2004. While there were still trees remaining, the park now had a very thin canopy.

Assistance from the Canadian federal government allowed Halifax Regional Municipality to make significant progress in the recovery and renewal of the park. As of June 2008 over 70,000 Acadian forest trees had been planted in the park, surpassing the number of trees lost to Hurricane Juan.

The comprehensive plan for Point Pleasant Park proposed long-term care for the park&#x27;s forest based on Canada&#x27;s national standard for sustainable forest management. The process of Adaptive Management would be used to guide the renewal and care of Point Pleasant, one of Canada&#x27;s oldest urban parks.

==Military monuments==

Point Pleasant is the location to numerous monuments associated with the heritage of Halifax and the sea. The largest is the Halifax Monument, better known as the Sailor&#x27;s Memorial, which commemorates members of the Royal Canadian Navy, the Canadian Merchant Navy and Canadian Army who were lost at sea. It was first erected in 1924 in a headland near the park but moved to Citadel Hill in 1954 when names from World War II were added. However the cross on Citadel Hill had decayed by 1966 so it was replaced in 1967 by the present monument in Point Pleasant. The current memorial consists of a Cross of Sacrifice inscribed with the names of 3257 Canadian men and women who were buried at sea as a result of the World Wars. The most well-known casualties listed on the monument are the nursing sisters who died on the HMHS Llandovery Castle during World War 1. (415 Canadians from naval and merchant ships who died in the Atlantic Ocean during World War I.) The original monument has been replaced by two later monuments.

The ship&#x27;s anchor from the aircraft carrier HMCS &quot;Bonaventure&quot; serves as a monument to the men and women who died while serving the Canadian Navy during Peacetime. A cairn marks the lives lost in the sinking of the Canadian Merchant Navy ship SS Point Pleasant Park in 1945. A monument facing the Northwest Arm honour Walter Hose, a naval commander who helped build the Royal Canadian Navy while another honours the families who ran the Northwest Arm ferry and performed many rescues. National Historic Site plaques in the park commemorate the role of Halifax as Naval Port and the Battle between HMS &quot;Shannon&quot; and USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; in 1813.

Niederer&#x27;s son was Second Lieutenant Seth Dvorin, a 24-year-old U.S. Army soldier in the 10th Mountain Division who was killed on February 3, 2004, during the occupation of Iraq. Dvorin, who had just returned to Iraq after spending two weeks with his family, was killed after locating an improvised explosive device. After Dvorin&#x27;s death, Niederer campaigned against the re-election of George W. Bush and continued American military presence in Iraq. Niederer came to national prominence after she was arrested for disrupting a speech by First Lady Laura Bush in September 2004. Later criminal charges of &quot;defiant trespass&quot; against Niederer were dropped.

Niederer lives in Pennington, New Jersey. She entered a Bush-Cheney rally of about 700 at a firehouse in Hamilton Township on September 16, 2004. Niederer had a ticket to the rally, as required, and carried a T-shirt in her purse which read &quot;President Bush You Killed My Son,&quot; with a picture of her son. During Bush&#x27;s speech, Niederer shouted &quot;Why did my son have to die?&quot; and &quot;When are yours going to serve?&quot; (a reference to Bush&#x27;s children).

Bush supporters began a loud chant of &quot;Four more years,&quot; quickly drowning Niederer out. Reports indicated that such a response to disruption was planned; one campaign volunteers was quoted as saying, &quot;If anybody acts up, I just start chanting, &#x27;Four more years!&#x27;&quot; Some Bush supporters directly confronted Niederer, including one audience member who yelled, &quot;Your son chose to fight in that war.&quot;

Niederer was forcibly removed by local police and Secret Service, who handcuffed her and placed her in the back of a police van. Even though videotape of the incident appears to show Niederer resisting arrest, she was never criminally charged with resisting arrest.

Mercer County Prosecutor Joseph L. Bocchini Jr. issued a statement defending the police for stopping Niederer from heckling the First Lady, but some free speech advocates felt the charge was unwarranted.
:&quot;It is our determination that the police officers had more than enough probable cause to arrest Ms. Sapir-Niederer and were justified in their actions,&quot; said Bocchini. &quot;Taking all factors into consideration, including the recent loss of her son while serving in the armed forces in Iraq, I believe that the continued prosecution of matter would serve no useful purpose.&quot;

<doc id="1001643" wikidata="Q2079390" url="?curid=1001643" title="Music of the Final Fantasy series">
<text>&quot;Final Fantasy&quot; is a media franchise created by Hironobu Sakaguchi and owned by Square Enix that includes video games, motion pictures, and other merchandise. The series began in 1987 as an eponymous role-playing video game developed by Square, spawning a video game series that became the central focus of the franchise. The music of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series refers to the soundtracks of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series of video games, as well as the surrounding medley of soundtrack, arranged, and compilation albums. The series&#x27; music ranges from very light background music to emotionally intense interweavings of character and situation leitmotifs.

The franchise includes a main series of numbered games as well as several spin-off series such as &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; and the &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; series. The primary composer of music for the main series was Nobuo Uematsu, who single-handedly composed the soundtracks for the first nine games, as well as directing the production of many of the albums. Music for the spin-off series and main series games beginning with &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; was created by a variety of composers including Masashi Hamauzu, Naoshi Mizuta, Hitoshi Sakimoto, Kumi Tanioka, and Yoko Shimomura.

The majority of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, including all of the main series games, have received a soundtrack album release. Many have also inspired orchestral, vocal, or piano arrangement albums. In addition to the regular albums, a number of compilation albums of tracks from multiple games have been produced both by Square Enix and outside groups. Music from the original soundtracks of the games has been arranged as sheet music for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing, while sheet music from the piano albums have been published by Yamaha Music Media. The franchise&#x27;s music has been performed numerous times in concert tours and other live performances such as the &quot;Orchestral Game Music Concerts&quot;, &quot;Symphonic Game Music Concerts&quot;, and the &quot;Play! A Video Game Symphony&quot; and &quot;Video Games Live&quot; concert tours, as well as forming the basis of specific &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; concerts such as the &quot;Dear Friends&quot; and &quot;Distant Worlds&quot; concert tours.

==Themes==
Although each game in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series offers a variety of music, there are some frequently reused themes. Most of the games open with a piece called &quot;Prelude&quot;, which is based on a short piece by Bach that has evolved from a simple, two-voice, arpeggiated theme in the early games to a complex melodic arrangement in recent installments. It has been described as being &quot;as recognizable in gaming circles as the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; theme or &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;″s title screen pop&quot;. Battle victories in the first 10 installments of the series were accompanied by a victory fanfare; this theme has become one of the most recognized pieces of music in the series. Chocobos and moogles, two mascots for the series, each have their own themes. The basic theme for chocobos is rearranged in a different musical style for each installment, and usually has a title ending in &quot;de Chocobo&quot;, while moogles have a theme entitled &quot;Moogle&#x27;s Theme&quot;, which first appeared in &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;. The chocobo inspired the spin-off &quot;Chocobo&quot; series, and many of the pieces from the soundtracks of that series are stylistically based on the main chocobo theme. A piece called &quot;Prologue&quot; or &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, originally featured in the first game, has appeared in some form in every game in the main series, with the exceptions of &quot;II&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, and &quot;XIII&quot;, originally appearing in the prologue of the games. It sometimes appears as a full arrangement and surfaces other times as a theme played during the finale track. Although leitmotifs are often used in the more character-driven installments, theme music is typically reserved for main characters and recurring plot elements.

==History==
===Main series===
====1987–2000: Uematsu era====
When Nobuo Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in Tokyo, a woman working in the art department for Square, which would later become Square Enix, approached him about creating music for some of their titles in development, and he agreed. Uematsu considered it a side job and was skeptical it would become any sort of full-time position. He said it was a way to make some money on the side, while also keeping his part-time job at the music rental shop. Before joining Square, he composed music for television commercials. The first score he produced for Square was the soundtrack for the role-playing video game &quot;Cruise Chaser Blassty&quot;. While working at Square, he met &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who asked him if he wanted to compose music for some of his games, which Uematsu agreed to. Sakaguchi gave him a few instructions for the soundtrack of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, Uematsu&#x27;s 16th score, such as the need for &quot;battle&quot; and &quot;town&quot; music, but left the remainder of the composing to Uematsu, aside from informing him of the specific technical limitations of the Famicom system. The game was released in 1987.
After the success of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, Uematsu remained with the series to compose the soundtrack to &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; (1988). Although &quot;I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; were composed separately, music from the two games have only been released on albums together. These albums include a soundtrack album and two arranged albums. &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; (1990) was released two years later and featured a soundtrack from Uematsu that has been lauded as one of the best soundtracks of any NES game. The soundtrack spawned two soundtrack albums, as well as a disc of vocal and orchestral arrangements.

&quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; (1991) was the first game in the series to be released for the Super Famicom, and the resultant changes in the sound technology resulted in a composition process that Uematsu noted was &quot;excruciating&quot;. Uematsu has stated that, beginning with this soundtrack, he started to move away from the idea that the soundtrack had to be solely an orchestral score. In addition to the soundtrack album, the music of &quot;IV&quot; was arranged and released in the style of Celtic music, performed by Máire Breatnach. It also sparked the release of an album of piano arrangements, something which would be repeated for every subsequent main-series game to date.

Having now gained experience with the Super Famicom sound chip, Uematsu felt that the sound quality of the soundtrack for the next game in the series, &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; (1992), was much better than that of &quot;IV&quot;. He named this as the primary reason that the soundtrack album was two CDs long, a first for the series. Like &quot;IV&quot;, the discography of &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; included an arranged and a piano album in addition to the main soundtrack album.

In 1994, Square released &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; (1994), the last for the Super Famicom, and the accompanying soundtrack has been considered one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever composed. The game&#x27;s discography also includes orchestral and piano arrangement CDs, as well as EPs of unreleased tracks and character themes. The soundtrack included the first attempt in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series to include a vocal track, &quot;Aria di Mezzo Carattere&quot;, which has been described as &quot;one of Uematsu&#x27;s greatest achievements&quot;. This track features an unintelligible synthesized &quot;voice&quot; that harmonizes with the melody, as technical limitations for the SPC700 sound format chip prevented the use of an actual vocal track. The first actual vocals in a piece appeared in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;.

Beginning with &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; (1997), the series moved platforms to the PlayStation. While the media capabilities of the PlayStation allowed for CD quality music, Uematsu opted instead to use Sequence format. The soundtrack album ran a record four discs, and Uematsu has stated that the move into the &quot;PlayStation era&quot;, which allowed video game composers to use sounds recorded in the studio rather than from synthesizers, had &quot;definitely been the biggest change&quot; to video game music. &quot;VII&quot; was the first game in the series to include a track with digitized vocals, &quot;One-Winged Angel&quot;, which has been described as Uematsu&#x27;s &quot;most recognizable contribution&quot; to the music of the series. The piece, described as &quot;a fanfare to impending doom&quot;, is said to not &quot;follow any normal genre rules&quot; and has been termed &quot;possibly the most innovative idea in the series&#x27; musical history&quot;. The lyrics of the piece, a Latin choral track which plays at the climax of the game, were taken from the medieval poetry on which Carl Orff based his &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, specifically the songs &quot;Estuans Interius&quot;, &quot;O Fortuna&quot;, &quot;Veni, Veni, Venias&quot; and &quot;Ave Formosissima&quot;. There was a plan to use a &quot;famous vocalist&quot; for the ending piece as a &quot;theme song&quot; for the game, but the idea was dropped due to time constraints and thematic concerns. The idea of a theme song would be resurrected in the following installment of the series. In 2006, IGN ranked &quot;VII&quot;″s music the best &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; soundtrack to date and cited the &quot;gripping&quot; character tracks and &quot;One-Winged Angel&quot; in particular as contributing factors. The discography of the original game only includes soundtrack, best of, and piano albums. However, beginning in 2005 Square Enix produced a collection of media centered on the game and world of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; entitled the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;. This collection has produced five additional soundtrack albums, each for a different game or animation.

The soundtrack of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; (1999), unlike that of &quot;VI&quot; and &quot;VII&quot;, did not include character themes, as Uematsu felt they would not be effective. In response to a question by IGN stating that the music of &quot;VIII&quot; was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu said that &quot;the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it&#x27;s also my intention to put various types of music into one game&quot;. Although the idea had not been used in the previous game, he thought a ballad would closely relate to the theme and characters of &quot;VIII&quot;, and composed &quot;Eyes on Me&quot;, performed by Faye Wong. The song was released as a single, while Square produced soundtrack, orchestral, and piano albums for the game&#x27;s music.

The music of &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; (2000) was based around a theme of Renaissance music, and was heavily inspired by previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, incorporating themes and motifs from earlier soundtracks. Uematsu felt previous games &quot;VII&quot; and &quot;VIII&quot; had a mood of realism, but that &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; was more of a fantasy, so &quot;a serious piece as well as silly, fun pieces could fit in&quot;. Uematsu has claimed several times that the music of &quot;IX&quot; is his favorite work, as well as the one he is most proud of. Like &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, &quot;IX&quot; included a vocal theme, &quot;Melodies of Life&quot;, which was sung by Emiko Shiratori. The game&#x27;s discography includes albums of the original soundtrack, a selection of the best tracks, a piano arrangement album, an album of unreleased tracks, and a single of &quot;Melodies of Life&quot;.

====2001–present: other composers====

&quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; (2001) marked the first time in the series&#x27; history that Uematsu was not the sole composer for the soundtrack. Released on the PlayStation 2, the score was assisted by Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano. Uematsu contributed 51 tracks, Hamauzu contributed 20 tracks and Nakano contributed 18 tracks to the game. The two other composers were chosen for the soundtrack based on their ability to create music that was different from Uematsu&#x27;s while still working together. The discography for the game includes the soundtrack album, piano, and vocal arrangement albums, and an EP of tracks by Uematsu inspired by the game. The theme song for the game, &quot;Suteki da ne&quot;, which translates to &quot;Isn&#x27;t it Wonderful?&quot;, was written by Nobuo Uematsu and Kazushige Nojima and was sung by Japanese folk singer Ritsuki Nakano, known as &quot;Rikki&quot;, whom the music team contacted while searching for a singer whose music reflected an Okinawan atmosphere. &quot;Suteki da ne&quot; is sung in its original Japanese form in both the Japanese and English versions of &quot;X&quot;, and was released as a single.

Uematsu, along with Naoshi Mizuta and Kumi Tanioka, composed the score for &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; (2002). It was the last &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; soundtrack that Uematsu was a main composer for until &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, as he resigned from Square Enix in November 2004. The expansion packs were mostly scored by Mizuta alone. The opening of the game features choral music with lyrics in Esperanto. According to Uematsu, the choice of language was meant to symbolize the developers&#x27; hope that their online game could contribute to cross-cultural communication and cooperation. The game and each of its four expansion packs have produced a soundtrack album; the discography for the game also includes two piano albums, an album of unreleased tracks, two arranged albums, and a single for its vocal theme, &quot;Distant World&quot;, which was composed by Uematsu and performed by Japanese opera singer Izumi Masuda.
&quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; (2006) was composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, with six other compositions by Hayato Matsuo and Masaharu Iwata. Uematsu only contributed the game&#x27;s ending theme song, &quot;Kiss Me Good-Bye&quot;, which was performed by Angela Aki. Violinist Taro Hakase also contributed a piece named &quot;Symphonic Poem ″Hope″&quot;, featured during the game&#x27;s ending credits. Sakimoto was brought in to compose the soundtrack to the game by Yasumi Matsuno, the producer of the game, five months before the game was officially announced. Sakimoto experienced difficulty following in Uematsu&#x27;s footsteps, but he decided to create a unique soundtrack in his own way, although he cites Uematsu as his biggest musical influence. Sakimoto did not meet with Uematsu for direction on creating the soundtrack and tried to avoid copying Uematsu&#x27;s style from previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; soundtracks. However, he did attempt to ensure that his style would mesh with Uematsu&#x27;s &quot;Kiss Me Good-Bye&quot; and the overall vision of the series. The current discography, while originally limited to the soundtrack album and singles for &quot;Kiss Me Good-Bye&quot; and &quot;Symphonic Poem ″Hope″&quot;, was late in 2012 given an album of piano arrangements like most prior soundtracks in the series.

&quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; (2009) was composed by Masashi Hamauzu. Although its main theme was originally announced to be composed by Nobuo Uematsu, Uematsu instead gave it to Hamauzu to compose after being selected as the composer for &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, making &quot;XIII&quot; the first game in the main series to not have any work by Uematsu. The game has sparked the release of a soundtrack album, an arranged album, two gramophone record albums of music from the soundtrack, a piano album, and a single of the game&#x27;s theme song , sung by Sayuri Sugawara. The international versions of &quot;XIII&quot; feature the song &quot;My Hands&quot; sung by British singer Leona Lewis from her second album &quot;Echo&quot;.

Uematsu was hired through his &quot;Smile Please&quot; studio to score the original &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, the first game in the series in a decade to have a score completely composed by him at release. The theme song &quot;Answers&quot; was sung by Susan Calloway, with lyrics from game writers Yaeko Sato and Michal-Christopher Koji Fox. Post-release, and for the &quot;A Realm Reborn&quot; reboot, additional in-game music has been composed by Naoshi Mizuta, Ryo Yamazaki, Tsuyoshi Sekito, and Masayoshi Soken. The full official soundtrack with all 104 tracks from the original version of &quot;XIV&quot; was released in a single Blu-ray compilation on August 14, 2013. Titled &quot;Before Meteor: FINAL FANTASY XIV Original Soundtrack&quot;, the disc contains all of the music composed by Nobuo Uematsu for the original release, as well as music added on subsequent patches by Uematsu, Mizuta, Yamazaki, Sekito and Soken. Uematsu, along with Calloway and Koji Fox, also returned for the title theme to the game&#x27;s 2015 expansion, &quot;Heavensward&quot;, titled &quot;Dragonsong&quot;.

===Spin-offs===
====&quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;====

The &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot; is the formal title for a series of games and animated features developed by Square Enix based in the world and continuity of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. Spearheaded by Tetsuya Nomura and Yoshinori Kitase, the series consists of several titles across various platforms, all of which are extensions of the &quot;VII&quot;″s story. The first announced element of the series was &quot;Final Fantasy VII Advent Children&quot;, an animated sequel to the original game, though the first to be released was the mobile phone game &quot;Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII&quot;. &quot;Before Crisis&quot;″s soundtrack was composed by Takeharu Ishimoto, while &quot;Advent Children&quot; was scored by Nobuo Uematsu, Keiji Kawamori, Kenichiro Fukui, and Tsuyoshi Sekito. Other titles in the series are &quot;Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII&quot;, the soundtrack of which was composed by Masashi Hamauzu, &quot;Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII&quot;, which was primarily composed by Takeharu Ishimoto with a few tracks provided by Kazuhiko Toyama, and &quot;Last Order: Final Fantasy VII&quot;, also composed by Ishimoto.

&quot;Advent Children&quot; featured a song by former Japanese rock band Boøwy&#x27;s singer Kyosuke Himuro in its ending credits, the &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot; soundtrack contained two songs by Gackt, including its theme song &quot;Redemption&quot;, and &quot;Crisis Core&quot;″s theme song, &quot;Why&quot;, was performed by Ayaka. Each element of the series sparked its own soundtrack album except for &quot;Before Crisis&quot; and &quot;Last Order&quot;, which had their soundtracks released together in one album. &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot; also had a download-only soundtrack album for its Japan-only multiplayer mode, while &quot;Redemption&quot; and &quot;Why&quot; each had a single release by their respective artists.

====&quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;====

&quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; (2003), was the first direct video game sequel to any &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game. Despite having composed the majority of the soundtrack for &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, Nobuo Uematsu did not contribute any music to the project. No tracks from &quot;X&quot; or other games in the series were used in the game. In an attempt to make a different style of music for the game than previous franchise titles, Square brought Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi on board to compose the music for &quot;X-2&quot;, as the developers felt they were the &quot;perfect fit&quot; to incorporate a &quot;pop&quot; style into the music. The game includes two songs with vocalized elements, one of which, the J-Pop song &quot;real Emotion&quot;, was written by Ken Kato and composed by Kazuhiro Hara. The other, J-Pop ballad &quot;1000 Words&quot;, was written by scenario writers Kazushige Nojima and Daisuke Watanabe. Matsueda and Eguchi composed and arranged the track. Both songs were sung by Jade Villalon from Sweetbox in the English version of the game, and are available as bonus tracks on the Japanese release of her album &quot;Adagio&quot;. In the Japanese version of the game both the songs were sung by Kumi Koda and were released as a single entitled &quot;real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba&quot;. Koda also released her own English versions of the songs on her CD single &quot;Come with Me&quot;, with slightly different versions of the lyrics than Jade. In addition to &quot;Come with Me&quot;, the collection of music for &quot;X-2&quot; includes the two-disc soundtrack album, a piano album, a soundtrack album for the &quot;Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission&quot; version of the game, a single for the song &quot;Eternity ~ Memory of Lightwaves&quot;, and a set of three singles themed around the three main characters of the game.

====&quot;Tactics&quot; and &quot;Ivalice Alliance&quot;====

The &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; series is a spin-off of the main &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, consisting of primarily tactical role-playing games with heavy thematic similarities to the main series. After &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; was set in the same world, Ivalice, as the two games in the series &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; (1997) and &quot;Tactics Advance&quot; (2003), all future games set in the game world became part of the new &quot;Ivalice Alliance&quot; subseries. These games to date include &quot;Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings&quot; (2007), &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions&quot; (2007), &quot;Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift&quot; (2007), and &quot;Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System&quot; (2007).

The music of these games has been primarily composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, who also composed the main-series game set in Ivalice, &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;. Masaharu Iwata shared compositional duties with him for &quot;Tactics&quot;; Sakimoto composed 47 tracks for the game while Iwata composed the other 24. Sakimoto composed almost all of the music for &quot;Tactics Advance&quot;, while Uematsu contributed the main theme and Kaori Ohkoshi and Ayako Saso composed additional battle tracks. Both games have a soundtrack album, while &quot;Tactics Advance&quot; inspired an arranged album. Sakimoto again was the composer for &quot;Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift&quot;, though this time he was supported by composers from his studio Basiscape, and it too sparked a soundtrack album release. He also scored &quot;Revenant Wings&quot;, though it primarily consisted of arrangements of his previous work and has not been released as a separate album, and his work on &quot;Tactics&quot; was used as the score for the spin-off series &quot;Crystal Defenders&quot;.

====&quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot;====
Another spin-off of the main series, the &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&quot; series consists of &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; (2004), its sequel &quot;Ring of Fates&quot; (2007), and their spin-offs &quot;My Life as a King&quot; (2008), &quot;Echoes of Time&quot; (2009), &quot;My Life as a Darklord&quot; (2009), and &quot;The Crystal Bearers&quot; (2009). Kumi Tanioka is the main composer for the series, having composed the music for all of the released games. Her only work on the main series to date has been as one of the co-composers for &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;. She did not compose the soundtrack for &quot;The Crystal Bearers&quot;; Hidenori Iwasaki composed it instead. Tanioka is known for using an eclectic mix of instruments in her albums; she has described the musical style for the soundtrack to &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; as being based on &quot;ancient instruments&quot;. The soundtrack has extensive use of many medieval and Renaissance musical instruments—such as the recorder, the crumhorn and the lute; creating a distinctively rustic feel—and also follows the practices and styles of medieval music. For the soundtrack to &quot;Ring of Fates&quot;, Tanioka purposefully did not focus on &quot;world music&quot;, instead focusing on &quot;creating a new landscape containing the same atmosphere&quot;. &quot;Echoes of Time&quot; also incorporates a variety of instruments, including oboes, xylophones, marimbas, and Latin guitars.

Of the released games, &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Ring of Fates&quot;, and &quot;Echoes of Time&quot; are the only ones to have a released soundtrack. &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; also has sparked a single of its theme song, , composed by Kumi Tanioka and performed by Fujimoto Yae. &quot;Ring of Fates&quot; also has an associated single of its theme song, , written and performed by Aiko. &quot;Echoes of Time&quot; did not have a theme song.

====&quot;Chocobo&quot;====

The &quot;Chocobo&quot; series is a spin-off series of games first developed by Square and later by Square Enix, featuring a super deformed version of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series mascot—the chocobo—as the protagonist. These games include Mystery Dungeon installments and a variety of minigame collections over a wide variety of video game consoles. The series includes over a dozen games, most of which have been released only in Japan. The soundtracks to the games have been composed by a wide variety of composers, and many of the soundtracks are composed primarily of arranged versions of tracks from previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; soundtracks, especially the &quot;chocobo&quot; theme.

Only some of the games have led to separate soundtrack releases. The first of these was , which was scored by Masashi Hamauzu and inspired an orchestral arrangement album also composed by Hamauzu. The soundtrack of &quot;Chocobo&#x27;s Dungeon 2&quot; was composed by Kumi Tanioka, Yasuhiro Kawakami, Tsuyoshi Sekito, Kenji Ito, and Nobuo Uematsu. The games whose soundtracks were primarily composed of previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Chocobo&quot; tracks were &quot;Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo&#x27;s Dungeon&quot;, which was arranged by Yuzo Takahashi of Joe Down Studio, &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot;, whose original tracks were composed by Kenji Ito, and &quot;Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales&quot;. The sequel to &quot;Chocobo Tales&quot;, &quot;Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book: The Witch, The Maiden, and the Five Heroes&quot;, contains mainly original works, and the two games were scored by Yuzo Takahashi. Unlike the other &quot;Chocobo&quot; games, they had a joint soundtrack album release, while &quot;Chocobo Tales&quot; had a previous download-only &quot;best of&quot; album.

====Others====
Other spin-offs of the main &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series include &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; (1991), a spin-off game later also considered as the first game in the &quot;Mana&quot; series, which had references to &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; removed in its remake, &quot;Sword of Mana&quot;. It was scored by Kenji Ito, with one track by Uematsu. &quot;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&quot; (1992) is an SNES game scored by Ryuji Sasai and Yasuhiro Kawakami. &quot;Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals&quot; (1994) is an animated sequel to &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;, and was scored by Masahiko Sato. &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot; (2001), a computer animated science fiction film, was scored by Elliot Goldenthal, and &quot;Final Fantasy: Unlimited&quot; (2001), a 25-episode anime series, was scored by Nobuo Uematsu, Shiro Hamaguchi, and Akifumi Tada. The soundtracks to &quot;The Spirits Within&quot; and &quot;Mystic Quest&quot; were released as separate albums, while &quot;Unlimited&quot; had two soundtrack album releases. &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; saw the release of a soundtrack album, an arranged album, a release which compiled both previous albums together, and a soundtrack album for its remake.

==Merchandise==
The majority of games in the franchise, including all of the main series games, have led to a soundtrack album release. Many have also inspired orchestral, vocal, or piano arrangement albums as well. These albums have been produced and reprinted by a number of different companies, including DigiCube, NTT Publishing, Square Enix itself, and many others. Additionally, many albums have been made available at the iTunes Music Store. In addition to the regular albums, a number of compilation albums of pieces from several &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games have been produced both by Square Enix and outside groups, both officially and unofficially. These albums include music directly from the games, as well as arrangements covering a variety of styles. Square Enix produced the first album, &quot;Final Fantasy 1987–1994&quot; (1994) and has since produced 13 albums, leading up to &quot;Final Fantasy Remix&quot; (2008). The first compilation album produced by an outside group was &quot;The Best of Final Fantasy 1994–1999: A Musical Tribute&quot;, released in 2000 by Sherman F. Heinig; the newest is &quot;Voices of the Lifestream&quot;, an unlicensed download-only album from OverClocked ReMix released in 2007.

Music from the original soundtracks has been arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing. Books are available for every main series game except for &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;, as well as for &quot;Advent Children&quot; and &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot;. All piece in each book have been rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos, though they are meant to sound as much like the originals as possible. &quot;Best of&quot; collections and arrangements for guitar solos and piano duets are also available.

Additionally, the actual piano sheet music from each of the ten &quot;Final Fantasy Piano Collections&quot; albums has been published as ten corresponding music books by Yamaha Music Media. Each book contains the original music, exactly as arranged and performed on the albums. Unlike the Original Score arrangements, these pieces are intended only for advanced players as they are generally more difficult. Sheet music for the &quot;Final Fantasy XI Piano Collections&quot; album included in the &quot;Final Fantasy XI OST Premium Box Set&quot; was included in that box set, and, like the album itself, is unavailable for purchase elsewhere; sheet music for the identically named standalone piano album is published by Yamaha.

==Public performances==
Music from &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; has been performed numerous times in concert tours and other live performances. Music from the series was played in the first four concerts of the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra&#x27;s &quot;Orchestral Game Music Concerts&quot; series from 1991 to 1994, and each concert has been released on an album. It has also been played in the &quot;Video Games Live&quot; concert tour from 2005 to date as well as the &quot;Play! A Video Game Symphony&quot; world tour from 2006 onwards, for which Nobuo Uematsu composed the opening fanfare that accompanies each performance. &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; music was played at the Symphonic Game Music Concert series, a series of annual German video game music concerts notable for being the first of their kind outside Japan, from 2003 to 2007. The music made up one fourth of the &quot;Symphonic Fantasies&quot; concerts in September 2009 which were produced by the creators of the &quot;Symphonic Game Music Concert&quot; series. It has also been played by the Australian Eminence Symphony Orchestra, an independent symphony orchestra specializing in classical music from video games.

Music from the series has also been played in specific &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; concerts and concert series. After the success of the &quot;20020220 Music from Final Fantasy&quot; concert in 2002, a recording of which was produced as an album, the &quot;Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy&quot;, was launched in Japan in 2004. It was followed by the &quot;Dear Friends -Music from Final Fantasy-&quot; tour in the United States that same year, which was originally scheduled to be a single concert but grew into a year-long tour. In 2005, a concert entitled &quot;More Friends: Music from Final Fantasy&quot; was performed to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the first &quot;Dear Friends&quot; concert and also had an album published of the performance. The latest &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; tour is the worldwide &quot;Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy&quot; tour, which began in Sweden in 2007 and still continues to date. A recording of its first performance was released as an album. Nobuo Uematsu additionally plays with The Black Mages, a band which performs &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; music in a rock music style. They have performed music live in concert, as well as with orchestras as part of various concert tours. They have released three albums to date, as well as DVDs of their live performances.

From November 2003 to April 2004, Square Enix U.S.A. launched an AOL Radio station dedicated to music from the series, initially carrying complete tracks from &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; in addition to samplings from &quot;VII&quot; through &quot;X&quot;. The station was relaunched in July 2006 and still remains on the site. In the 2004 Summer Olympics, the American synchronized swimming duo consisting of Alison Bartosik and Anna Kozlova were awarded the bronze medal for their performance to &quot;Liberi Fatali&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. &quot;Born Anew&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot;, &quot;Victory Fanfare&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, and the &quot;Main Theme&quot; all played at the 2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.

==Sales==
By 2010, at least eight &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; soundtrack albums had debuted in the top ten of the Oricon albums chart: &quot;Final Fantasy VI Original Sound Version&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy VIII Original Soundtrack&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy IX Original Soundtrack&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy X-2 Original Soundtrack&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy XII Original Soundtrack&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack&quot;, the latter debuting at #3 on the chart. As of 2010, the only &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; albums that failed to reach the top 30 of the Oricon albums chart were the soundtracks for the &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; series and &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot; series.

&quot;My Hands&quot;, the Leona Lewis theme song for the North American and European versions of &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot;, was not released as a single, but the album it originates from, &quot;Echo&quot; (2009), sold over 1 million copies in Europe, including over 600,000 in the United Kingdom. Ariana Grande&#x27;s &quot;Touch It&quot; (orchestral remix), which is featured in &quot;Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius&quot;, was not released as a single, but it originates from &quot;Dangerous Woman&quot; (2016).

==Legacy==
Nobuo Uematsu&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; music has appeared multiple times in the annual top 300 Classic FM Hall of Fame, including five appearances in the annual top 20. In 2012, &quot;Aerith&#x27;s Theme&quot;, written by Uematsu for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, was voted into the number 16 position in the annual Classic FM (UK) &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; top 300 chart. It was the first time that a piece of music written for a video game had appeared in the chart. In 2013, music from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series received even greater support and was voted into the third position on the Classic FM Hall of Fame. Uematsu and his &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; music subsequently appeared at number seven in 2014, number nine in 2015, number 17 in 2016, and in the top half of the list for every subsequent year through 2019.

Eímear Noone of Classic FM states that Nobuo Uematsu&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; score &quot;changed the course of classical music&quot; by &quot;setting concert halls alight and inspiring a new generation of classical music lovers&quot;. Elizabeth Davis of Classic FM states that &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; helped introduce &quot;a whole generation to the magic of orchestral music&quot; and &quot;inspired a generation of composers, many of whom have gone on to write music for video games&quot;. She states that the &quot;epic soundtracks of games like &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; and &quot;God of War&quot;, all owe a debt to Uematsu, who made the world wake up to the power of video game music&quot;. She notes that &quot;Aerith&#x27;s Theme&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; in particular is &quot;one of the most famous pieces of video game music ever written&quot; and is rooted in romantic music.

<doc id="1001650" wikidata="Q155309" url="?curid=1001650" title="Korolyov, Moscow Oblast">
<text>Korolyov or Korolev () is an industrial city in Moscow Oblast, Russia, well known as the cradle of Soviet and Russian space exploration. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 183,402, the largest as a science city. As of 2018, the population was more than 222,000 people.

It was known as Kaliningrad () from 1938 to 1996 and served as the leading Soviet center for production of anti-tank and air-defense guns. In 1946, in the aftermath of World War II, the artillery plant was reconstructed for production of rockets, launch vehicles, and spacecraft, under the guidance of Soviet scientist and academician Sergei Korolev, who envisioned, consolidated and guided the activities of many people in the Soviet space-exploration program. The plant later became known as the RKK Energia; when the Vostok space vehicle was being developed, this research center was designated as NII-88 or POB 989.

Russian Mission Control Center is also located in Korolyov. Though the real control is decentralized due to security reasons and all space aircraft may be controlled from many different locations across Russia, the historic center of control is still in Korolev, and is called FCC – Flights Control Center.

In July 1996, the city was renamed in commemoration of Sergei Korolev, the father of the Soviet/Russian space program, who died in 1966. Since 1997, Korolyov has hosted the International Space Olympics, an annual competition for young people to promote space related research.

==History==

In the 12th century, a Slavic settlement was located on the site of modern Korolyov. The settlement stood on a junction of trade routes between the Moscow and Vladimir-Suzdal principalities. After the Mongol conquests in the 13th century, the region was in decline.

The village of Podlipki had formed on the site by the 18th century, when one of the first textile factories in Russia was established there.

From the late 19 century, Podlipki was also known as a dacha village frequented by many literali, as can be witnessed by the name of Podlipki-Dachnye railway station. They later moved their dachas to Peredelkino in Moscow&#x27;s southwestern suburb, when Podlipki became a closed city of the Russian SFSR.

In 1924, the first OGPU working commune in the Soviet Union was established at Podlipki. In 1938, the Kalininsky settlement near an artillery plant (which had previously been relocated from Leningrad to better protect it in case of any future war) was granted town status and named Kaliningrad (meaning Kalinin City, after Bolshevik leader Mikhail Kalinin; not to be confused with the Baltic port city also renamed Kaliningrad after Mikhail Kalinin in 1946). Over the next three decades the town expanded greatly as a home of rocket manufacturing for both military missiles and the Soviet space program. As such it was a closed city to foreigners, who could not travel there.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as Korolyov City Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Korolyov City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Korolyov Urban Okrug.

In June 2014, Yubileyny, Moscow Oblast Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction was merged into Korolyov City Under Oblast Jurisdiction and on the municipal side, Yubileyny Urban Okrug was merged into Korolyov Urban Okrug. The town of Yubileyny ceased to exist as an independent entity.

==Demographics==
As of 1 January 2016, Korolyov was in 93 place out of 1112 cities in Russia based on demographics.

On 2 June 2014, the city of Yubileniy officially became a part of Korolyov. With a total population of 220 thousand people, Korolyov became the third largest city in Moscow Oblast based on population after Balashikha (428,400) and Khimki (239 967).

==Politics==

During the implementation of the municipal reform, by 1 January 2006, Korolyov was granted the status of the Korolyov urban district as the only settlement within it.

===Authorities===
On 14 September 2014, the candidate from the United Russia party, Alexander Khodyrev, was elected head of Korolyov.

==Economy==
The main enterprise of the city is the RKK Energia, but there are several kinds of industry in the city. This naukograd (science city) is the place in which the first Youth Residential Complex in the Soviet Union was built. Another notable company located in the city is OAO Kompozit, which is engaged in the field of materials science.

Today the city is prosperous overall. But in the Soviet-era economy, the city typified the wide contrasts and ironic juxtapositions that arose as some aspects of life were heavily funded by the government while others remained chronically underfunded. Yuri Krotkov described in his 1967 memoir how, at the same time that advanced technology was being built for space rockets, the textile plants of old Podlipki went on for decades with nearly no improvement on their 1920s equipment, and starkly impoverished workers in various hard and glamourless jobs of prerevolutionary days crossed paths, sometimes resentfully, with the skilled technicians and scientists, who were substantially better paid despite the slogans of Soviet ideology around the equal dignity of manual labourers.

==Sports==
The bandy club Vympel has played in the Russian Bandy Supreme League, which is the second-highest division. Their home arena has a capacity of 10 000. A plan existed to equip the stadium with artificial ice, but the project has been abandoned. Although an indoor ice hockey-sized arena entered the plans instead, the official reason given was financial problems. Now Vympel only plays in the amateur league of Moscow Oblast. In 2014 a bandy federation for the city was founded.

==Notable people==
The area was a place of elite dachas at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. Many famous people, such as Konstantin Stanislavsky, Anton Chekhov, Valery Bryusov, Boris Pasternak, Anna Akhmatova, Isaac Levitan, Pavel Tretyakov, Marina Tsvetaeva and Vladimir Lenin, lived here.

==Twin towns and sister cities==
Korolyov is twinned with:
* Zhukovsky, Russia
* Moscow, Russia
* Khimki, Russia
* Baikonur, Kazakhstan

<doc id="1001653" wikidata="Q4432932" url="?curid=1001653" title="List of galleons of Spain">
<text>This is a list of a few of the carracks and galleons that served under the Spanish Crowns in the period 1410-1639; note that Castile and Aragon were separate nations, brought together in 1474 only through a unified Trastamaran and subsequently Habsburg monarchy, but each retaining its own governments and naval forces until the 18th century. From 1580 to 1640 Portugal was also part of this Habsburg Empire, but again its naval forces remained separate and are not included below. Not all these ships listed were built in Spain or its colonies:

The term &quot;galeón&quot; continued in use in Spanish sources for much longer than in the navies of Northern Europe, lasting even into the middle of the eighteenth century. However, the design of the capital ship had evolved during the second half of the 17th century, when (like other maritime states) when they had in reality adopted the concept of the ship of the line.

<text>This is a list of Spanish ships of the line (comprising the battlefleet) built or acquired during the period 1640-1854:&lt;br&gt;
Those with 94 or more guns were three-deckers, while all the others listed were two-deckers. The Spanish term for ships of the line was &quot;navíos&quot;, but during the latter part of the Habsburg era (until 1700) ships continued to be designated as &quot;galeón&quot;. Those ships with secular names (e.g. royal, geographical or adjectival names) were additionally given an official religious name (or &quot;advocación&quot;) which appears below in parentheses following the secular name.

Until 1716 there was not one single Spanish Navy but several naval forces, of which the &quot;Armada del Mar Océano&quot; was the primary one but several other distinct forces existed. The &quot;Real Armada&quot; (&quot;Royal Navy&quot;) was created by the newly-established Bourbon government in 1716, but the other &quot;armadas&quot; (in Spanish, the word &quot;armada&quot; is used for both &quot;navy&quot; and &quot;fleet&quot;) endured for several years thereafter. During the early 1750s, the term &quot;Real Armada&quot; was replaced by &quot;Armada Española&quot;.

<text>Prionailurus is a genus of spotted, small wild cats native to Asia. Forests are their preferred habitat; they feed on small mammals, reptiles and birds, and occasionally aquatic wildlife.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Prionailurus&quot; was first proposed by the Russian explorer and naturalist Nikolai Severtzov in 1858 as a generic name for a single felid occurring in tropical Asia, namely &quot;Felis pardachrous&quot; described by Brian Houghton Hodgson — the leopard cat. As varieties, Severtzov lists &quot;Felis nipalensis&quot; described by Thomas Horsfield and Nicholas Aylward Vigors, &quot;Leopardus Elliotti&quot;, &quot;Leopardus Horsfieldi&quot; and &quot;Leopardus chinensis&quot; described by John Edward Gray, and &quot;Felis bengalensis&quot; described by Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest.

The British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock recognized the taxonomic classification of &quot;Prionailurus&quot; in 1917. In 1939, he described the genus on the basis of skins and skulls, and compared these to body parts of &quot;Felis&quot;. &quot;Prionailurus&quot; species are marked with spots, which are frequently lanceolate, sometimes rosette-like, and occasionally tend to run into longitudinal chains, but never fuse to form vertical stripes as in &quot;Felis&quot;. Skulls of &quot;Prionailurus&quot; are lower and less vaulted than of &quot;Felis&quot;. The facial part is shorter than the cranial, and the bottom of the orbit longer. The nasal bones are not everted above the anterior nares, and the outer chamber of the bulla is much smaller than the inner. Pocock classified the leopard cat, rusty-spotted cat and fishing cat as belonging to the genus &quot;Prionailurus&quot;.

Pocock&#x27;s classification of &quot;Prionailurus&quot; has been widely accepted, with five species now recognised:






A fossil species, Prionailurus kurteni, is described from Pleistocene deposits of China.

Molecular analysis of leopard cat populations indicates a clear distinction between northern populations from Tsushima, Korea, Siberia, China and Taiwan and Southeast Asian populations. If these genetic differences indicate a specific distinction, &quot;P. b. euptilurus&quot; may yet be a valid species.
The Iriomote cat (&quot;P. bengalensis iriomotensis&quot;) has been proposed as a distinct species based on morphology, but is considered a subspecies of &quot;P. bengalensis&quot; based on genetic analysis.

=== Phylogeny ===
Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear DNA in tissue samples from all Felidae species revealed that the evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia in the Miocene around . Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at around .
Both models agree in the rusty-spotted cat having been the first cat of the &quot;Prionailurus&quot; lineage that genetically diverged, followed by the flat-headed cat and then the fishing cat. It is estimated to have diverged together with the leopard cat between and .

The following cladogram shows their phylogenetic relationship as derived through analysis of nuclear DNA:

<doc id="1001657" wikidata="Q3275521" url="?curid=1001657" title="Thrust bearing">
<text>A thrust bearing is a particular type of rotary bearing. Like other bearings they permanently rotate between parts, but they are designed to support a predominantly axial load.

Thrust bearings come in several varieties. 
*&quot;Thrust ball bearings&quot;, composed of bearing balls supported in a ring, can be used in low-thrust applications where there is little axial load.
*&quot;Cylindrical roller thrust bearing&quot;s consist of small cylindrical rollers arranged flat with their axes pointing to the axis of the bearing. They give very good carrying capacity and are cheap, but tend to wear due to the differences in radial speed and friction which is higher than with ball bearings.
*&quot;Tapered roller thrust bearings&quot; consist of small tapered rollers arranged so that their axes all converge at a point on the axis of the bearing. The length of the roller and the diameter of the wide and the narrow ends and the angle of rollers need to be carefully calculated to provide the correct taper so that each end of the roller rolls smoothly on the bearing face without skidding. These are the type most commonly used in automotive applications (to support the wheels of a motor car for example), where they are used in pairs to accommodate axial thrust in either direction, as well as radial loads. They can support greater thrust loads than the ball type due to the larger contact area, but are more expensive to manufacture.

*&quot;Spherical roller thrust bearings&quot; use asymmetrical rollers of spherical shape, rolling inside a house washer with a raceway with spherical inner shape. They can accommodate combined radial and axial loads and also accommodate misalignment of the shafts. They are often used together with radial spherical roller bearings. Spherical roller thrust bearings offer the highest load rating density of all thrust bearings.
*&quot;Fluid bearings&quot;, where the axial thrust is supported on a thin layer of pressurized liquid—these give low drag.

*&quot;Magnetic bearings&quot;, where the axial thrust is supported on a magnetic field. This is used where very high speeds or very low drag is needed, for example the Zippe-type centrifuge.

Thrust bearings are commonly used in automotive, marine, and aerospace applications. They are also used in the main and tail rotor blade grips of RC (radio controlled) helicopters.

Thrust bearings are used in cars because the forward gears in modern car gearboxes use helical gears which, while aiding in smoothness and noise reduction, cause axial forces that need to be dealt with.

Thrust bearings are also used with radio antenna masts to reduce the load on an antenna rotator.

One kind of thrust bearing in an automobile is the clutch &quot;throw out&quot; bearing, sometimes called the &quot;clutch release bearing&quot;.

==Fluid film thrust bearings==
Fluid-film thrust bearings were invented by Albert Kingsbury, who discovered the principle in the course of bearing and lubrication investigations commencing in 1888 while a student. His first experimental bearing was tested in 1904. He filed for a patent in 1907, and it was granted in 1910. The first Kingsbury bearing in hydroelectric service, one of its major applications, was installed at the Holtwood Generating Station in 1912. It remains in full use today.

Thrust bearings were independently invented by Australian engineer George Michell (pronounced Mitchell) who patented his invention in 1905.

Fluid thrust bearings contain a number of sector-shaped pads, arranged in a circle around the shaft, and which are free to pivot. These create wedge-shaped regions of oil inside the bearing between the pads and a rotating disk, which support the applied thrust and eliminate metal-on-metal contact.

Kingsbury and Michell&#x27;s invention was notably applied to the thrust block in ships. The small size (one-tenth the size of old bearing designs), low friction and long life of Kingsbury and Michell&#x27;s invention made possible the development of more powerful engines and propellers. They were used extensively in ships built during World War I, and have become the standard bearing used on turbine shafts in ships and power plants worldwide. (See also Michell/Kingsbury tilting-pad fluid bearings)

Today thrust bearings continue to play an essential role in rotating equipment like expanders, pumps, and gas or steam turbines or compressors. In addition to the traditional babbitt bearings which were used since the early 20th century, new materials for the thrust pads have come into use. For example Bronze and Copper-Chromium are commonly used to improve the bearings performance.

<doc id="1001665" wikidata="Q2721080" url="?curid=1001665" title="Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn">
<text>Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn (, , , ) is the prominent Christian icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary venerated by the faithful in the Chapel of the Gate of Dawn in Vilnius, Lithuania. The painting was historically displayed above the Vilnius city gate; city gates of the time often contained religious artifacts intended to ward off attacks and bless passing travelers.

The painting is in the Northern Renaissance style and was completed most likely around 1630. The Virgin Mary is depicted without the infant Jesus. The artwork soon became known as miraculous and inspired a following. A dedicated chapel was built in 1671 by the Discalced Carmelites. At the same time, possibly borrowing from the Eastern Orthodox tradition, the painting was covered in an expensive and elaborate silver and gold riza, leaving only the face and hands visible.

On 5 July 1927, the image was canonically crowned by Pope Pius XI. The chapel was later visited by Pope John Paul II in 1993. It is a major site of pilgrimage in Vilnius and attracts many visitors, especially from Poland.

==History==
The legend tells that in 1702, when Vilnius was captured by the Swedish army during the Great Northern War, &quot;Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn&quot; came to her people&#x27;s rescue. At dawn, the heavy iron city gates fell, crushing and killing four Swedish soldiers. After this, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Army successfully counter-attacked near the gate.

It is believed that the painting was commissioned by the government of Vilnius. It was customary to place paintings or sculptures of various saints in niches of walls hoping that they would protect the building. The governor of Vilnius ordered two paintings, one depicting Christ the Saviour (&quot;Salvator Mundi&quot;), and the other the Virgin Mary. Both of them decorated the Gate of Dawn of the Vilnius city wall – a defensive structure with no religious importance at the time. The painting of Christ decorated the exterior of the gate, while that of the Virgin was in the same place as it is now – a small niche, protected by shutters from rain and snow. Narrow and steep stairs led to a small balcony where the faithful could light candles and pray. In 1650, Albert Wijuk Kojałowicz published &quot;Miscellanea&quot;, listing all miraculous paintings of Mary, but did not mention &quot;Our Lady of the Gate of the Dawn&quot;.

In the mid-17th century the Discalced Carmelites built the Church of Saint Teresa and their monastery near the Gate of Dawn. In 1655, the city was captured, looted, and depopulated during the Battle of Vilnius of the Russo-Polish War. It was likely that the city government, short of funds, transferred maintenance of the gate and the paintings to the Carmelites. The painting of Christ was moved to the Carmelite monastery and later to Vilnius Cathedral (a fresco of Jesus was painted in its original niche in the 19th century; it was uncovered in 1976). In 1671, the monks built a wooden chapel to Our Lady next to the gate tower; it was around the time that the painting was covered in expensive silver riza. By then, the painting was already an object of public veneration and the chapel dedication ceremony was attended by many prominent figures of the time including Chancellor Krzysztof Zygmunt Pac, Grand Hetman Michał Kazimierz Pac, and senators of the general sejm.
In May 1715, the wooden chapel burnt down, but the painting was saved and placed in the Church of St Teresa. In 1720, the current brick chapel was dedicated in the presence of four bishops, a number of senators, and a large crowd of the faithful. In 1761, the monk Hilarion published &quot;Relacja o cudownym Obrazie Naijświętszej Marji Panny etc&quot;, the primary source for the painting&#x27;s early history and also the first collection of various miracles attributed to it. In 1773 Pope Clement XIV granted an indulgence to the faithful, designating the chapel as a place of public worship, and established a charitable society. At the turn of the 19th century, Tsarist authorities demolished the city wall and all the city&#x27;s gates, except the Gate of Dawn and its chapel. In 1829, the chapel underwent restoration and acquired elements of late Neoclassicism. Since the entrance to the chapel was from inside the Carmelite monastery, women could not go inside. Because of this, one female devotee sponsored the construction of a two-storey gallery on the side of the street in 1830.

In 1927, major restoration works were completed under bishop Romuald Jałbrzykowski. With permission from Pope Pius XI, the painting was solemnly crowned &quot;Mother of Mercy&quot; on 2 July 1927 by the Archbishop of Warsaw Alexander Cardinal Kakowski. The ceremony was attended by President Ignacy Mościcki, First Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, Primate of Poland August Hlond, 28 other bishops, and other dignitaries.

==Painting==
===Origin and inspiration===
The origin of the painting is not known. According to historian Teodor Narbutt (1784–1864), the painting was acquired by Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania (ruled 1345–1377), as a war trophy from Crimea. This note, based on dubious sources, along with dark colors of the painting that resembled Byzantine icons, inspired 19th-century Russian historians to claim that the painting was Orthodox and not Roman Catholic. This theory was popularized in various articles, brochures, studies and is sometimes quoted today. Others claimed that the painting was commissioned by King of Poland Sigismund II Augustus and depicted his wife Barbara Radziwiłł.

With a silver riza covering the entire painting, except for the face and hands, it was very hard for art historians to determine in what period the painting was created. In 1927, the silver cover was removed for the first time in decades. The painting was analyzed and restored. Based on the new data gathered during the restoration, Mieczysław Skrudlik came to a conclusion that the painting was completed around 1630–1650 and linked it with another painting in the Corpus Christi Church in Kraków, created by artist Luke in 1624. Mary Kałamajska Saeed in her 1990 thesis argued that &quot;Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn&quot; was a work of a local artist and was inspired by contemporary Flemish mannerist painter Marten de Vos through an engraving of Thomas de Leu. In 1993, on the occasion of pope&#x27;s visit, the painting was restored and one of its planks was dated based on its tree-rings. The scientists concluded that the oak grew in 1434–1620.

===Description===
The original painting is and was painted by an unknown artist on eight oak planks thick. As usual for Northern Europe, a very thin layer of chalk priming was applied to the planks before painting in tempera. Later &quot;Our Lady&quot; was repainted in oil paint. Some restoration work was completed in the mid-19th century. Major restoration works were completed in 1927.

The painting depicts complex personality and devotion to Mary. Her head is gently leaning to her right, her eyes are half closed, her hands are crossed in devotion; this reminds that she is a virgin, humble servant of the Lord, merciful mother and patron of the people. At the same time, her head is surrounded by an aureola with golden rays and her body is usually covered in elaborate gold and silver rizas and crowns; these are the symbols of her divine and majestic role as the Queen of Heaven. The painting also reminds of &quot;Tota pulchra es&quot; (You are all beautiful), an old Catholic prayer.

===Riza===

The tradition to decorate paintings with a riza or revetment of precious metals may have been borrowed from Eastern Orthodoxy. The riza of &quot;Our Lady&quot; is composed of three gilded silver parts, each completed by different artists at a different period. The head and shoulders were covered in 1670–90; the chest piece was adapted from a different painting in 1695–1700; the bottom of the painting was completed by the 1730s. The revetments are richly decorated in floral motifs: roses, tulips, narcissi, carnations, and at least six other species.

The flowers were references to &quot;hortus conclusus&quot; (enclosed garden), and a symbol of Mary&#x27;s virginity and purity. The circle of stars represents the Immaculate Conception. The head of &quot;Our Lady&quot; is adorned with two crowns. Two little angels lower the large Rococo-style crown with colored glass inlays upon the smaller Baroque crown. Some argued that the two crowns, resembling royal and ducal insignia, represented the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania respectively. In 1927, duplicate crowns were made of pure gold, donated by the people, and were blessed by Pope Pius XI. On 2 July 1927 the Canonical Coronation took place and the painting received the title of &quot;Mother of Mercy&quot;. The gold crowns were lost, possibly during World War II.

On certain occasions, the image has been displayed without its riza for a limited time. 

Sculptures of Mary&#x27;s parents – St Joachim and St Anne – stand on both sides of the painting between the altar columns.
==Veneration==

===Miracles and votive offerings===

In 1761, the monk Hilarion published a book enumerating 17 miracles attributed to the painting and the Virgin Mary. The first miracle he recorded occurred in 1671, the same year the first chapel was built. A two-year-old child fell from the second floor onto a stone pavement and was badly injured. The parents then prayed to &quot;Our Lady&quot; and the next day the child was healthy once again. In 1702, Vilnius was captured by the Swedish Army during the Great Northern War. The Swedes, who were Protestants, mocked the painting, forbade songs and prayers, and caroused around the Gate of Dawn. One soldier even shot at the painting (the bullet hole can still be seen on the right sleeve). In the early morning of Great and Holy Saturday, the heavy iron gates fell and crushed four Swedish soldiers – two died instantly and two later from their injuries. The next day, Easter Sunday, the Lithuanian Army successfully counter-attacked near the gate. The commander, grateful for the victory, bestowed a large silver votive offering upon the chapel. The painting is also credited with other miracles: subduing a city fire in 1706, punishing a Russian soldier for an attempt to steal her silver riza in 1708, and numerous miraculous healings. Other stories of various miracles were kept by the Carmelite monks, but those books have not survived.

Votive offerings became a tradition. They are usually small silver objects (hearts, crucifixes, figures of praying people, images of cured eyes, legs, arms). Several times (1799, 1808, 1810) some of these objects were taken down and melted into liturgical objects. In 1844 there was a total of 785 offerings. Twelve years later, in 1856, the number had almost doubled to 1,438. From 1884 to 1927 a journal of new offerings was kept. During that time 2,539 new gifts were registered. Currently, there are about 8,000 silver votive objects in the chapel. The large crescent moon located right beneath &quot;Our Lady&quot; is also a votive offering. Its origins are unknown but it bears an inscription in Polish and a date of 1849. The crescent goes well with the silver riza, adding additional parallels with the Woman of the Apocalypse, described in the Book of Revelation as &quot;a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars&quot;.

===Divine Mercy===
The icon of &quot;Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn&quot; has become associated with the messages of Divine Mercy. Eight years after the icon was conferred the title of &quot;Mother of Mercy&quot;, the first exposition of the Divine Mercy image, painted by Eugene Kazimierowski under the direction of Faustina Kowalska, took place at the chapel in April 1935. In her &quot;&quot;, she writes of a mystical experience involving the icon in the Gate of Dawn chapel. On 15 November 1935, Saint Faustina was at the Gate of Dawn chapel participating in the last day of the novena before the feast day of the icon, 16 November. She writes of seeing the icon taking on &quot;a living appearance&quot; and speaking to her, telling her &quot;accept all that God asked of me like a little child, without questioning; otherwise it would not be pleasing to God.&quot;

===Shrines in other locations===
Today this holy image is venerated by Roman Catholics, Greek Catholics, and Eastern Orthodox Christians of many countries whose origins lie in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, including Lithuania, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and their diasporas worldwide. In Lithuania itself there are 15 churches as well as Lithuanian parishes in Montreal and Buenos Aires devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Gate of Dawn. On 26 February 2007 the parish of Our Lady of Vilnius (&quot;Aušros Vartų Parapija&quot;) was closed by the Archdiocese of New York. The sanctuary had featured an icon of &quot;Our Lady&quot;, painted by the artist Tadas Sviderskis in the 1980s.

In Poland the biggest church devoted to &quot;Our Lady&quot; is the Marian Basilica in Gdańsk. Other shrines of the holy icon are found in Poland (Białystok, Drogosze, Kętrzyn, Olsztyn, Skarżysko-Kamienna and Wrocław), United Kingdom (Kidderminster), United States (South River, NJ), and Australia. A copy of the painting can also be found in Church of Saint-Séverin in Paris.

There is a Vilnius&#x27; Gate of Dawn Mother of Mercy Chapel () in the St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Vatican City. It was consecrated by the Pope Paul VI in 1970 and it is a place where Pope John Paul II had his first prayer after being elected as the Pope in 1978. Only Lithuania, Poland, Hungary and Ireland have such chapels in the St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

===Liturgical Commemoration===
Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn is commemorated on November 16 in the Catholic Church and January 8 (December 26 O.S.) and April 27 (April 14 O.S.) in the Orthodox Church.

===Seraphim-Diveyevo &quot;Tenderness&quot; icon of the Mother of God===
The Seraphim-Diveyevo “Tenderness” icon belonged to Saint Seraphim of Sarov and was his cell icon, which he called “Joy of All Joys.” It is a variant copy of the icon of Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn and not an Eleusa icon despite being called &quot;Tenderness&quot;. The icon is kept currently in the Vladimirskaya Church at the Patriarchal Residence in Chisty Lane.

<text>&quot;Dragon Ball&quot; is a Japanese media franchise created by Akira Toriyama in 1984. The franchise features an ensemble cast of characters and takes place in the same fictional universe as Toriyama&#x27;s other work, &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;. While many of the characters are humans with superhuman strengths or supernatural abilities, the cast also includes anthropomorphic animals, extraterrestrial lifeforms, and deities who govern the world and the universe.

During the course of the story, protagonist Son Goku is adopted by Grandpa Son Gohan and encounters allies like Bulma, Master Roshi, and Trunks; rivals such as Tien Shinhan, Piccolo, and Vegeta; and villains such as Frieza, Cell, and Majin Buu. Goku&#x27;s group of associates, known as the , bolsters its ranks throughout the series with the addition of former enemies and new heroes. The group is also known in Japanese as the or Team &quot;Z&quot; in other media, and the Earth&#x27;s Special Forces in the English dub of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;.

==Background==

=== Overview ===
The &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise begins in Goku&#x27;s boyhood years as he trains in martial arts and explores a fantastical version of . The plot revolves around his search for the seven Dragon Balls used to summon a wish-granting dragon. The tone of the series becomes more action-oriented and less comedic as Goku reaches adulthood. He and his allies defend Earth against various threats, overcoming seemingly insurmountable opponents, and eventually emerging victorious against progressively more powerful foes.

The series also includes depictions of the afterlife and time travel as a means of creating historical divergences. &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; in particular expands the setting of the series to include parallel universes; the vast majority of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series takes place in Universe 7, or the Seventh Universe in the English dub.

===Concept and design===
Akira Toriyama initially based most of the characters on those from &quot;Journey to the West&quot;: Goku from the Monkey King, Bulma from Tang Sanzang, Oolong from Zhu Bajie, and Yamcha from Sha Wujing. He also incorporated ideas from one of his earlier one-shot manga series, &quot;Dragon Boy&quot;. Toriyama explained that the reason there are many anthropomorphic characters is that he found it easier to visually differentiate them compared to human characters. For the female characters, Toriyama created women he deemed &quot;beautiful and sexy&quot;, but also &quot;strong&quot;. He claimed that he has trouble drawing females, which is why there are relatively few female characters in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series. To advance the story quickly, he introduced Goku&#x27;s signature flying nimbus cloud, later gave most fighting characters the ability to fly, and eventually granted Goku teleportation. 

Many &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; characters have names that are puns, which are associated with related characters. For example, Bulma and her family are named after undergarments, members of the human-like alien race known as the Saiyans are named after vegetables, and because Frieza is a pun on freezer, the Ginyu Force are named after products that are kept in a refrigerator. A study on sound symbolism and its effect on character names conducted by researchers at Tsuda University, Tokyo discover that out of a sample size of 118 villainous characters from &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, the consonants /g/ and /b/ were frequently used in their names and that there was a strong tendency to link &quot;bad &amp; male&quot; characters with /ɡ/, which supports the notion that &quot;a sound-meaning association can be attested in at least some phonemes&quot; in the Japanese language. Toriyama explained that he does not like giving names to techniques and special abilities, but did so at his editor&#x27;s suggestion. His wife was the one who named the series&#x27; signature , but he named all the others, even selecting them specifically for each character; saying someone like Vegeta would use names in English, and using kanji for the more sophisticated Piccolo.

The franchise&#x27;s anime and film adaptations feature some original characters not created by Toriyama but by Toei Animation staff: &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; and the vast majority of the film adaptations and OVAs exist in their own unique continuities which branch off from the anime television series at various points, so original characters introduced in the films are usually unknown to the characters in either or both of the official anime and manga series continuities. Toriyama personally designed certain characters which made their debut appearances in animated films, as well as licensed video games such as Android 21.

==Main characters==
The &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series features an ensemble cast of main characters. The most prominent protagonist of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series is Goku, who along with Bulma forms the Dragon Team to search for the Dragon Balls at the beginning of the series. After the truth of Goku&#x27;s heritage is revealed, Saiyan characters play a central narrative role from &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; onwards: Bardock and Trunks from an alternate future timeline serve as the protagonists of their respective side stories, while Goku&#x27;s son Gohan briefly assumes the role of series protagonist following the conclusion of the Cell Games Saga. Vegeta is featured as the co-protagonist for &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;.

===Son Goku===
First introduced as a young boy, is depicted as immensely strong, pure of heart, and extremely competitive, but dedicated to defending his adopted home Earth from internal or external threats. Although he appears human, it is later revealed that Goku is a Saiyan, and that his original name is Kakarrot.

===Bulma===
 first appears as a teenager using the Dragon Radar, a fictional device she created to detect the energy signal emitted by Dragon Balls. She is led to Goku&#x27;s location by the signal emitted by the four-star ball in his possession and recruits him as a bodyguard while hoping to get his four-star ball to grant her wish for a boyfriend. She gives up on the wish after meeting Yamcha, and much later in the series, she marries Vegeta. Bulma has also assumed the role of inventor and has consistently provided critical tech support to Goku and his friends with their battles against various enemies and threats throughout the series. Some of her notable innovations include a microband that could make her shrink, and a time machine that brought her son from an alternate future timeline, Trunks, to the past on multiple occasions.

===Krillin===
 is a bald martial artist and one of Goku&#x27;s best friends and classmates. He and Goku are under the tutelage of Master Roshi; initially his rival but later a friend, and a loyal companion in adventures thereafter. He is killed by King Piccolo&#x27;s spawn Tambourine, but is later revived by Shenron. After the fight with the Saiyans, he travels to Planet Namek, where he is killed by Frieza. After being brought back to life again by the Namekian Dragon Balls, he helps out during the Android and Cell arcs. He is married to Android 18 and has a daughter, .

===Piccolo===
 is the spawn of King Piccolo, created to get revenge on Goku in the wake of his death, and subsequently assumes the role as the &quot;evil half&quot; of Kami. However, after being narrowly defeated by Goku, he must team up with him and his friends when opposing the invading Saiyans, including training Goku&#x27;s son Gohan. He is later revealed to be a Namekian—a demonic, green-skinned, four-fingered, hairless humanoid species who created the series&#x27; titular Dragon Balls. He dies sacrificing himself to protect Gohan during the fight against the Saiyan Nappa, and trains in the afterlife under King Kai before being wished back to life by the Namekian Dragon Balls. While he temporarily maintains the partnership during the fights with Frieza and the Androids, by the time of the Cell and Majin Buu arcs he accepts the fact they are allies.

===Son Gohan===
 is Goku&#x27;s eldest son with Chi-Chi, who first appears at the age of four. He is kidnapped by Goku&#x27;s brother, Raditz, and locked up in a space pod. However, his temper flares and he bursts out of the space pod, dealing a blow to Raditz and knocking himself out. After the battle, Piccolo takes and trains him for a year as he realizes Gohan&#x27;s potential. Gohan slowly becomes one of the strongest characters in the series, at one point holding his own against Frieza and eventually defeats Cell. After the Majin Buu arc, he marries Videl, with whom he later has a daughter named Pan.

===Vegeta===
 is the last prince of the Saiyan warrior people, and the fourth generation of the Saiyan royal bloodline to bear his namesake. He is first shown conquering a planet with his partner Nappa by listening to Raditz&#x27;s fight on Earth using their scouters. The two of them travel to Earth in search of the Dragon Balls, and he ends up fighting a newly revived Goku, but retreats after persistent attacks by Yajirobe, Krillin, and Gohan. He flees to recuperate before heading off to Planet Namek to collect its Dragon Balls before Frieza can. While on Namek, Vegeta proceeds to battle and kill many of Frieza&#x27;s underlings. He is later forced to team up with Gohan, Goku, Piccolo, and Krillin so they can fight off Frieza. After Frieza&#x27;s defeat, Vegeta lives on Earth and forms a relationship with Bulma. When the Androids arrive, it is revealed he has fathered a son with Bulma, Trunks. Later in the series, he and Bulma have a younger child daughter named , known as Bulla in the English dub; unlike her father and brother, and despite being half-Saiyan, she does not show any interest in fighting.

===Trunks===
 first appears as a mysterious young man who easily defeats Frieza and his father King Cold prior to Goku&#x27;s return to Earth from Planet Namek. It is revealed that he is Vegeta and Bulma&#x27;s future child who has traveled back in time to inform Goku of the arrival of the Red Ribbon Androids that, in his time, have killed everyone else in the Dragon Team besides Goku, who died of heart disease. Trunks&#x27; backstory is detailed in &quot;The History of Trunks&quot; television special. He helps fight against the Androids and Cell before returning to his timeline. The character reappears in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; to request assistance from the main timeline&#x27;s heroes, and also appears in &quot;Super Dragon Ball Heroes&quot;.

Just as the Androids arrived, the Trunks from the series&#x27; main timeline was born. Seven years later as a child, Trunks, already able to turn Super Saiyan at his age, fights against Majin Buu by using the fusion technique with his best friend Goten to form the composite being .

Later, he and Chiaotzu become their allies, fighting against King Piccolo&#x27;s minion until Goku arrives. In the fight with the Saiyans, Tien Shinhan dies of exhaustion against Nappa. He trains in the afterlife under King Kai before being revived by the Namekian Dragon Balls. Tien Shinhan helps out during the battles against the Androids and Cell, but for the most part does not participate in fighting until Frieza&#x27;s return and later the Tournament of Power.

===Chiaotzu ===
, Chiaotzu in the English anime dub, is a small human that resembles a jiangshi with pale skin, red cheeks, and has one hair under his hat. Although he is not physically strong, Chiaotzu is skilled with psychokinesis and telepathy. Chiaotzu is first introduced at the 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament, having been trained by Master Roshi&#x27;s rival Master Shen, trying to kill Goku and his fellow-students. After Tien Shinhan decides that Master Shen&#x27;s teachings are wrong, the two leave him and join Goku and his companions to defeat King Piccolo. After assisting Tien Shinhan and Master Roshi in finding the Dragon Balls, Chiaotzu is killed by King Piccolo while trying to thwart his wish for eternal youth, but is later revived using the Dragon Balls. In the battle against the Saiyans, he ineffectively self-destructs on Nappa in order to save Tien Shinhan. He trains in the afterlife under King Kai before being revived by the Namekian Dragon Balls. Chiaotzu joins the other characters when they gather for Frieza&#x27;s return, but Trunks kills Frieza before a fight ensues. Chiaotzu is generally no longer involved in battle from that point onwards, although he continues to train with Tien Shinhan. He is voiced by Hiroko Emori in Japanese, Rebecca Forstadt in the Harmony Gold dub, Cathy Weseluck in the Ocean dub, and Monika Antonelli in Funimation&#x27;s dubs, except in &quot;Kai&quot; onwards where Brina Palencia voices him.

She and 17 are eventually absorbed by Cell, but later during the Cell Games, a hard blow from Gohan causes Cell to regurgitate her. Although Krillin is unable to wish for her to be turned into a human, he is able to have her self-destruct device removed. She settles down with Krillin, and at some point, they have a daughter named . 18 continues to make recurring appearances as a secondary character, and later fights for Team Universe 7 in the Tournament Of Power arc.

===Son Goten===
 is the youngest son of Goku and Chi-Chi. When first introduced, Goten strongly resembles his father in appearance with the same hairstyle and similar clothing; as a teenager at the end of the series, his appearance has changed to include a shirt bearing his name and a longer, shaggier hairstyle. Goten was trained by his older brother Gohan in preparation for the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament, which their father attended. During the training, Gohan discovers Goten is already quite strong, as he has been training with their mother (compared to Gohan&#x27;s childhood), and can become a Super Saiyan despite still being a child. Like several characters in the series, he can also perform the &quot;Kamehameha&quot; technique.

In order to save the world from Majin Buu, Goku and Piccolo teach Goten and Trunks the fusion technique, which allows them to form a single being, . Gotenks battles Buu multiple times but he is unable to defeat Buu even as a Super Saiyan 3. Buu temporarily absorbs Gotenks to increase his own power, but Vegeta and Goku are able to retrieve him from Buu. When Buu destroys the Earth, Goten and Trunks are killed. The Dragon Balls later bring Goten back to life along with the rest of the Earth in order to give energy to Goku&#x27;s &quot;Genki-Dama&quot; attack, which defeats Buu. Goten and Trunks appear as the protagonists of the eleventh &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; feature movie, &quot;Bio-Broly&quot;.

Goten is one of the most popular characters in the series. Japanese fans voted Goten the sixth most popular character of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series in a 2004 poll. Goten is ranked number 13 on IGN&#x27;s Top 13 Dragon Ball Z Characters List, and came in 6th place on &quot;Complex.com&quot;″s list &quot;A Ranking of All the Characters on &#x27;Dragon Ball Z; Sheldon Pearce notes that the character exists mostly as part of a pair with Trunks, who is the more assertive member of the duo, and their bond makes them extremely compatible to undergo the fusion technique.

Masako Nozawa voices Goten in Japanese, while he is voiced by Kara Edwards (as a child) and Robert McCollum (as a teen) in the Funimation dub, by Jillian Michaels (as a child) and Gabe Khouth (as a teen) in the Ocean dub, and by Scott Hendrickson in the Blue Water dub. He is also voiced by Dana Hayes in the Bang Zoom! Entertainment dub of &quot;Super&quot;.

===Beerus===
 is a deity who appears in the fourteenth and fifteenth &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; films, as well as in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;. A purple catlike being, he is a God of Destruction whose purpose is to maintain balance by destroying planets, civilizations, or external threats that put the development of the universe at risk. Son Goku transforms into the Super Saiyan God for his fight against Beerus and loses, though Beerus spares him and the Earth. Beerus later forms a team consisting of Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, Buu, and a small, red humanoid alien named to participate in the Tournament of Destroyers after answering a challenge by his brother and fellow God of Destruction Champa. Beerus later forms another team consisting of notable fighters from Universe 7 to participate in the Tournament of Power, organized by the supreme deity Zeno. Since then he oversees Goku and Vegeta&#x27;s training on his home planet.

===Whis===
 is an angelic being who appears in the fourteenth and fifteenth &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; films, as well as in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;. A tall teal humanoid with pronounced effeminate features, he is an , a being of extremely high status within the multiverse hierarchy. Each Angel is bound to the service of a God of Destruction of their respective universes as personal attendants and guides, rarely leaving them unaccompanied: they are tasked with supervising their deity, and may intervene to keep them in check. Whis is consistently depicted as unmatched in power and possesses tremendous speed, effortlessly defending himself against assailants. It is also revealed that he and his fellow angels possess the autonomous martial arts ability of reacting to attacks without the interference of the mind, , a technique notorious for its difficulty to master even among deities, which is foreshadowed during his training of Goku and Vegeta, then later unexpectedly, but briefly achieved by Goku in the Tournament of Power.

The character&#x27;s name stems from a misunderstanding; Toriyama incorrectly believed that Beerus&#x27;s name was a pun on the word &quot;beer&quot; and so decided to follow the same rule to name the character&#x27;s assistant, naming the character Whis as a pun on . Whis is voiced by Masakazu Morita in Japanese media and Ian Sinclair in the Funimation dub.

=== Glorio ===
Glorio (グロリオ &quot;Gurorio&quot;) is a demon gunman who appears in &quot;Dragon Ball Daima&quot; and serves as a guide and pilot for the main characters. Glorio has light blue skin and pointed ears, the latter characteristic of all demons, and he first appears as a spy in the first Demon World&#x27;s palace. Following certain milestones during Goku&#x27;s adventure, such as obtaining a Dragon Ball, Glorio would report their progress to Dr. Arinsu, who had secretly been his employer during the entire adventure. 

During the climax of &quot;Daima&quot;, Glorio is reunited with Arinsu after she obtained the one-star Dragon Ball. While Gomah is fighting Goku, Arinsu orders Glorio to gather all of the Demonic Dragon Balls at one spot in order for her to make a wish. Since the dragon can only be summoned and wished upon in the Namekian tongue, Glorio was made to learn the language by Arinsu, who was hoping to use him to get her wish. However, Glorio instead wishes for all of the people Gomah had turned into children to turn back into adults, and is thoroughly thanked for doing this. After Majin Kuu became the new Demon King, he was granted the rank of minister.

Glorio has been compared to Han Solo from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series due to their similarities as their group&#x27;s pilots and morally grey outlaws. A scene early in &quot;Daima&quot; involving him was compared to the cantina scene from the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, and Glorio&#x27;s ability to use lightning has also been compared to Palpatine&#x27;s force lightning abilities.

==Antagonists==
===Pilaf Gang===
, Emperor Pilaf in the English anime dub, is a small impish blue creature who is the leader of the and dreams of ruling the world. He seeks the Dragon Balls to wish for world domination together with his two minions: , a humanoid dog in a ninja outfit; and , a woman who resorts to weaponry and technology, and serves as a foil to the bumbling personalities of her colleagues. Shu was originally named when he first appeared, but when the series was being adapted into an anime, the staff asked Toriyama what his name was and he replied with Shu instead, forgetting that he had already named him. By the time he realized the mistake, the anime had already aired, so he decided to use Shu in the manga when the character reappeared.

After initially succeeding in obtaining the Dragon Balls, the Pilaf Gang is foiled by Goku and his companions after Oolong&#x27;s wish is granted by Shenron just before Pilaf can say his. The Pilaf Gang returns to antagonize Goku a few more times throughout the series when they attempt to obtain the Dragon Balls again, and when they release King Piccolo from his confinement. Prior to the events of the fourteenth &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; film and &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, the Pilaf Gang use the Dragon Balls to wish for the restoration of their youth, only for the wish to backfire and them being transformed into young children by Shenron. They attempt to infiltrate Bulma&#x27;s birthday party to claim the Dragon Balls, but are foiled in the attempt. During the course of the &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; series the Pilaf Gang reform, much like several of Goku&#x27;s past adversaries, and they even become Trunks&#x27; classmates at school.

Pilaf is voiced by Shigeru Chiba in Japanese, Dave Mallow in the Harmony Gold dub, Don Brown in the BLT dub, Chuck Huber in the Funimation dub, and Dean Galloway in the Blue Water dub; for &quot;Mystical Adventure&quot;, he is voiced by Mike McFarland in the Funimation dub, Sharon Mann in the AB Groupe dub, and Apollo Abraham in the Creative dub.

The is a paramilitary organization led by , who is on a quest for world domination and has his forces raid towns worldwide to search for the Dragon Balls. After Goku destroys the organization, its chief scientist continues his research and development work on powerful artificial humanoids known as Androids to seek revenge against him.

===King Piccolo===
King Piccolo, or in Japanese, was conceived by Toriyama as a truly evil opponent for Goku, as all his villains up to that point had something &quot;likable&quot; about them. He came into being when the Namekian who became Earth&#x27;s guardian deity purged himself spiritually, and the negative energy took on a physical form after being cast off. He and the good half, Kami, are linked; if one dies, the other does as well. After being formed, he designates himself as the Great Demon King and terrorizes the world. He is imprisoned by Mutaito, the master of Master Roshi and Master Shen, in a rice cooker by the deadly technique. 

After being released by Pilaf, he attempts to kill anyone that could possibly seal him again (including Master Roshi and Chiaotzu) and uses the Dragon Balls to restore his youth before destroying Shenron, rendering them useless. He then takes over the King of the World&#x27;s palace and has the King announce him as his successor before being confronted by Goku, who, in their second battle, punches a large hole through his abdomen. Before dying, he regurgitates the egg containing his reincarnation, Piccolo Jr., to enact his revenge. He is voiced by Takeshi Aono in Japanese, Scott McNeil in the Ocean dub, and Christopher Sabat in the Funimation dub.

His first shown offspring, , helps him formulate his plan until he is killed when Goku knocks King Piccolo into him. He also creates to hunt down the contenders of the World Martial Arts Tournament to keep the sealing technique from resurfacing. Tambourine kills Krillin and beats a weakened Goku, but due to Goku&#x27;s Saiyan physiology, the near-fatal beating raises his strength dramatically, and Goku vaporizes him with a &quot;Kamehameha&quot; in a rematch. The third, , is created to find Dragon Balls, but he is killed and eaten by Yajirobe. The fourth, , is created to battle Tien Shinhan, who he easily defeats until Goku appears and crushes his head in one blow.

All four are killed by Gohan.

===Frieza===

His organization (フリーザ軍, &quot;Furīza-gun&quot;), known as &quot;Freeza&#x27;s Gang&quot; in the Viz Media localization and &quot;Frieza Force&quot; in the Funimation anime dub, controls a majority of Universe 7 at the peak of its power and serves as the primary antagonistic force of the first half of the &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; series. Frieza employs and enslaves powerful races, such as the Saiyans, to take over suitable planets so that they can be sold to the highest bidders, or alternatively to destroy planets that are determined to be financially unviable. Frieza&#x27;s forces are equipped with scouters, portable computers mainly used to measure power levels, and wear standard-issue battle armor that usually have dual shoulder guards, matching gloves and boots, and some form of skirt armor or crotch guard.

Frieza first appears on Planet Namek, where he systematically eradicates most of the native Namekian population to obtain the Dragon Balls so that he can wish for eternal life. It is eventually revealed that Frieza was responsible for destroying the Saiyan planet Vegeta, killing all but a few Saiyans, as he feared their power. He retains three of them (Vegeta, Nappa, and Raditz) as his underlings. Frieza later engages Goku and his associates in a protracted battle, with Goku transforming into a Super Saiyan after Frieza kills Krillin. Out of anger and frustration at his inability to counter Goku&#x27;s newfound power, Frieza blasts a hole into Namek&#x27;s core in order to destroy the planet. Frieza is then sliced in half by his own attack and begs for mercy, with Goku giving him some of his surplus energy. After he uses that energy to attack, Goku then seemingly kills Frieza. He is later rebuilt with cybernetic body parts and travels to Earth with his father and their forces to seek revenge, but all of them are easily killed by Trunks, who traveled back in time from the future. 

In &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection &#x27;F&#x27;&quot; and the &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; series, one of Frieza&#x27;s loyal officers named travels to Earth along with his subordinate to resurrect their master by using Earth&#x27;s Dragon Balls to summon Shenron. During a subsequent invasion on Earth, Sorbet was killed by his own master&#x27;s &quot;ki&quot; blast, which was intended for Krillin but was deflected by Vegeta. Even though Frieza utilizes a powerful new form developed as a result of intensive training, Goku defeats him again and sends him back to Hell. A deceased Frieza is later recruited by Goku to participate in the as a member of Team Universe 7. For his contributions in the tournament. Frieza is fully revived and rejoins his subordinates.

Bulma is blinded by her attraction to Zarbon&#x27;s uncommon physical beauty during their initial encounter and initially mistakes him for an ally.

After Zarbon retrieves Vegeta&#x27;s battered body and brings him to Frieza&#x27;s ship in order to heal him for interrogation, Vegeta manages to escape and steal Frieza&#x27;s Dragon Balls.

Before Raditz dies, Piccolo taunts him by explaining that Goku will be revived by the Dragon Balls, though Raditz manages to send one final transmission to inform Vegeta and Nappa of this, believing that his Saiyan comrades will come to Earth and use the Dragon Balls to revive him, but Vegeta and Nappa travel to Earth to use the Dragon Balls for their own purposes instead.

He obliterates Kibito single-handedly, turns Piccolo and Krillin to stone by spitting at them, and helps Babidi corrupt Vegeta with a spell. When Buu awakens, he transmutes Dabura into a large cookie and consumes him, restoring his petrified victims to normal. In a filler episode of the &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; anime, Dabura is shown accompanying Bulma, Chi-Chi, and Videl in their search for Gohan in the afterlife. Dabura is voiced by Ryūzaburō Ōtomo in the Japanese version of the anime series. In the Ocean Group English dub, his voice is supplied by Scott McNeil, and by Rick Robertson in the Funimation English dub. His name is a pun on the phrase Abracadabra. 

He was the Supreme Demon King who presided over all three Demon Worlds before Gomah succeeded him, and the latter was his vice-Supreme Demon King. His father, Supreme Demon King Abura (アーブラ &quot;Ābura&quot;) possessed the Tertian Oculus, or Evil Third Eye before him, but Dabura hired a thief to steal the artifact. By the time the thief had escaped, though, he was killed, and thus Dabura could not retrieve the item.

=== Gomah ===
Gomah (ゴマー &quot;Gomā)&quot; is the main antagonist of &quot;Dragon Ball Daima&quot; and the former Supreme Demon King who ascended following Dabura&#x27;s death. He was formerly the vice-Supreme Demon King under the reign of Dabura. He is responsible for transforming the central cast into younger versions of themselves using the Dragon Balls, and appears initially as a small, imp-like clown creature wearing a red-and-black suit. Gomah is voiced by Showtaro Morikubo in the Japanese version of the anime, and Tom Laflin in the English dub. 

After a servant obtained the Tertian Oculus from Hybis&#x27; belt, Gomah transforms into a monstrous version of himself by inserting the eye into his forehead. He is eventually confronted by a combined force of Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, Shin, Glorio, Majin Kuu, Majin Duu, and Tamagami Number One, but is able to defeat them easily, even after Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan 3. Afterward, Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan 4, but it&#x27;s still not enough until Glorio uses the Dragon Balls to return the main characters to their adult forms, which allows Vegeta to dominate Gomah, but Gomah uses the eye&#x27;s magic to restore his own vitality and prevent Vegeta from finishing him.

Gomah is defeated by Majin Kuu in the finale of &quot;Dragon Ball Daima&quot;, and Kuu succeeds him to become the new Demon King. Gomah is sealed away alongside Degesu for 99 years by Arinsu and Marba.

Degesu (デゲス &quot;Degesu&quot;) is the former Vice-Supreme Demon King who held the position under the reign of Gomah. He appeared in the first episode of &quot;Daima&quot; and is a member of the Glind species, as well as a sibling to both Arinsu and Nahare, the latter being most commonly known as Shin. He is voiced by Junya Enoki in Japanese and Landon McDonald in the English dub.

He is responsible for disabling Warp-sama, and ordering one of the palace&#x27;s servants to obtain the Tertian Oculus from Hybis&#x27; belt. He later holds the baby version of Dende hostage, before being defeated in an ambush led by Glorio. During the incident, Degesu mentions the fact that the Glind naturally seek positions of power, which explains why they are often seen as gods in the multiverse. In the finale of &quot;Daima&quot;, he was sealed away alongside his former superior, Gomah.

=== Dr. Arinsu ===
Dr. Arinsu (ドクター・アリンス &quot;Dokutā Arinsu&quot;) is a Glind scientist working under Gomah, and an older sibling of both Degesu and Nahare. Her voice is provided by Yoko Hikasa in Japanese and Morgan Laure in the English dub.

She hired Glorio to help her obtain the Dragon Balls with the ultimate goal of betraying Gomah and becoming new Supreme Demon King. Her aim if she had attained the role was to transform the Demon Realm into a more fearsome, violent place that would rule the entire multiverse. This position put her at odds with her two siblings, particularly Nahare.

Once Goku obtained the three-star Dragon Ball, Arinsu met with the Great Witch Marba (大魔女マーバ &quot;Dai Majo Māba&quot;), who created Majin Buu, in order to create two more creatures, known as Majin Kuu and Majin Duu. Arinsu then uses the two&#x27;s abilities in order to obtain the one-star Dragon Ball, which she never notifies Glorio about, and thus uses as a ransom toward Goku&#x27;s group.

Afterward, during the battle with Gomah, she orders Glorio to make a wish on the Dragon Balls to make her the Supreme Demon King, but he instead wishes to return Goku and his friends to their normal size, which frustrates Arinsu, leading her to fire him. Eventually, she decides to scour the archives for a way to remove the Tertian Oculus from Gomah, and with Kuu&#x27;s help she manages to discover that striking the eye&#x27;s bearer in the back of the head three times consecutively would remove the eye.

After Majin Kuu defeated Gomah and became the new Supreme Demon King, he granted Arinsu the rank of Vice-Supreme Demon King, after she had turned down the chance to become the Supreme Demon King.

==== Marba ====
Great Witch Marba (大魔女マーバ &quot;Dai Majo Māba&quot;) is the witch who created Majin Buu. She later created Majin Kuu and Majin Duu under Arinsu&#x27;s instructions, using the essence from Majin Buu&#x27;s regenerative fragments. The two develop a brotherly bond and become a duo thanks to their complementary skillsets. After Gomah is defeated, she seals him away alongside Degesu for 99 years. Thanks to her efforts, King Kuu grants her the rank of minister. She is voiced by Mami Horikoshi in Japanese.

Goku and his associates discover that Goku Black is actually , an apprentice Supreme Kai from Universe 10 of a pre-altered main timeline who despises all mortal life and hijacked Goku&#x27;s body using the Super Dragon Balls. Goku Black and Zamasu from the Universe 10 of Trunks&#x27; timeline fuse into a single being using the earrings, and is eventually defeated by the combined effort of Goku, Trunks, and their allies.

Drawing inspiration from the Japanese word &quot;namekuji&quot;, which means &quot;slug&quot; in Japanese, the Namekians are a humanoid species with plant and slug-like characteristics. They possess green skin, pointed ears characteristic of demons, and antennae on their bald heads and are able to make their own set of Dragon Balls. During the events of the series, very few Namekians remain on their home planet, as most of them died a generation prior from a great calamity. While extraterrestrial in origin, the first Namekian characters encountered by Goku, King Piccolo and his mutated offspring, were known as the Demon Clan and thought to originate from Earth.

Namekians possess physiques similar to those of human males and are seen reproducing asexually by spitting an egg out from their mouths. Despite their unique reproductive abilities, there is still diversity in the species as each offspring is usually not an exact copy of their parent, like with King Piccolo, or the who is the progenitor of every remaining Namekian on the planet prior to the events of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. The Great Elder, known as Guru in the English anime, abdicates his position as leader of the Namekian people in favor of before he dies later in the series.

He and King Piccolo were once one being, later revealed to be a Namekian, who expelled the evil inside him in order to assume the mantle of Earth&#x27;s guardian deity. The evil incarnation, King Piccolo, terrorized Earth until he was sealed away by Master Roshi&#x27;s master, Mutaito. If either Kami or King Piccolo dies, the other will as well, and the Dragon Balls cease to exist. Before King Piccolo dies at the hands of Goku, he spawns a much stronger incarnation, Piccolo, who takes over these same traits and retains his memories. Kami later attempts to seal away the new Piccolo himself using the same technique as Mutaito and enters the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament, possessing a human named as a guise. However, Piccolo learned to reverse the technique and traps Kami in a water jug instead and swallows it, before being released by Goku. During the fight against the Saiyans, Kami dies when Piccolo is killed by Nappa, but through the power of the Namekian Dragon Balls, they are both wished back to life. During the Android Saga, Kami agrees to fuse with Piccolo, with Piccolo absorbing his energy, strength, memories, intelligence, and thought pattern.

Dende guides Krillin to the Great Elder to tap into vast-hidden reserves of his power. He also interprets the Earthlings&#x27; wishes when utilizing the Namekian Dragon Balls, as the wish must be said in the native language of the Namekians. Dende later gains the power to heal injuries after having his power unlocked by the Great Elder, which he uses to aid the warriors fighting Frieza until he is killed by the tyrant for being disruptive and helping the Earthlings. After being resurrected, Dende resides on New Namek until he is asked by Goku to become Earth&#x27;s guardian deity. He accepts the position, revives Earth&#x27;s inert Dragon Balls, and continues to serve as Earth&#x27;s guardian deity throughout the rest of the series. Dende develops a close working relationship with Piccolo, as the latter had fused with , whom Dende was friends with, and his predecessor.

In order to find a way to defeat Gomah, Arinsu and Kuu scour the book of magical items in order to find a method to remove the Third Eye from Gomah&#x27;s head. Kuu finds that hitting the holder in the back of the head three times removes the eye. Arinsu relays his findings to the others, and Goku and Piccolo resolve to defeat Gomah by following those instructions. However, the two fail, and as Gomah appears to take the upper hand again, Kuu uses the book of magical items to attack Gomah, completing the procedure and defeating him.

Following his defeat of Gomah, Kuu is crowned the new Supreme Demon King and dons a white cape similar to the former Demon Kings Dabura and Gomah.

In English, she is voiced by Ellen Kennedy in the Ocean dub, and by Linda Chambers-Young in the Funimation dub.

===Fusion characters ===
A recurring theme in the &quot;Dragon Ball series&quot; is characters created through the process of merging two or more separate beings into one. The idea to have two characters fuse together was suggested by Toriyama&#x27;s long-time friend and fellow manga artist Masakazu Katsura, leading to the introduction of amalgamations of characters formed through various techniques. In the anime, the resulting fused characters tend to be depicted as speaking with a dual voice consisting of both participants&#x27; voices.

The technique, first introduced during the Majin Buu arc, is a ritual dance developed by an alien species called the Metamorans which Goku learned in the Other World. The purpose of this technique is to temporarily merge two or more bodies into a single, superior entity with characteristics from both participants. The newly fused body is dressed in Metamoran attire: a dark-colored vest lined with light-colored linen, white pants with a cloth belt, and boots. When the ritual dance is performed properly, the single being created possesses an astounding level of power, far beyond what either participant would have had individually by combining each other&#x27;s attributes from strength and speed to reflexes, intelligence, and wisdom. The fusion only lasts for 30 minutes, after which the participants revert to their normal selves. Notable examples of composite characters created with this technique include , the fusion of Goten and Trunks; and , the fusion of Goku and Vegeta.

Two individuals wearing a single matching earring but on opposite ears can trigger a . These earrings, usually worn by the Supreme Kai and their aides, combine both users into a new body, as well as an increase in power and personality that is greater than the sum of the two individuals. However, there are alternate methods of dissolving the fusion regardless of whoever the participants are, usually by forcing them apart (such as being magically split through a wish granted by Shenron). Notable examples of composite characters created by wearing a matching pair of Potara earrings include Kibito Kai, a fusion of Kibito and the East Supreme Kai of Universe 7; Vegito (ベジット &quot;Bejitto&quot;), a fusion of Goku and Vegeta, also known as Vegerot in the Viz English manga; and Kefla (ケフラ &quot;Kefura&quot;), a fusion of Caulifla and Kale. Mortals have a one-hour time limit before they separate, but if a deity is one of the participants, the fusion is permanent; the deity known as the is a fusion of the original and an old witch who stole one of his Potara earrings and put it on without being aware of the consequences.

The Namekians demonstrate a related technique early in the &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; series, where one Namekian absorbs the energy, strength, memories, and intelligence or thought patterns of another through a process akin to . Each participant must willingly consent to fuse in this manner and usually, the pair agrees to the stronger of the two serving as the host&#x27;s body. The agreed host places his hand over the chest of the other one and through unknown means, merge with a blinding flash. Only the body of the host remains in the aftermath, and the non-host is assimilated and ceases to exist as a body. The current incarnation of Piccolo is a notable example, having assimilated two other Namekian individuals into his being. Villainous characters like Cell and Majin Buu are also capable of forcibly absorbing other characters in order to acquire greater power by taking advantage of their unique physiology.

===Grandpa Gohan===
Grandpa Son Gohan (孫 悟飯 じいちゃん, Son Gohan Jīsan; FUNimation &quot;Grandpa Gohan&quot;, Viz &quot;Son Gohan&quot;), is the adoptive grandfather of Son Goku, whom he found in a crashed spaceship. Having originally studied under Master Roshi and learned the &quot;Kamehameha&quot; technique from him, he adopts Goku and teaches him martial arts.

Goku does not learn this until Vegeta turns into an ape and tells Goku about the transformations. He is brought back to life for one day by Baba Uranai to fight Goku and see his growth as a martial artist. Goku later names his first son Gohan in his grandfather&#x27;s honor. In the anime, he later appears as an assistant to , the ruler of the &quot;magical furnace&quot;. He is voiced by Osamu Saka in the Japanese version of the original series, Kinpei Azusa in &quot;Bardock: The Father of Goku&quot;, and Shigeru Chiba in &quot;Dragon Ball Kai&quot;. In the Funimation dub of the series, he is voiced by Christopher Sabat. He is portrayed by Randall Duk Kim in the American live-action film &quot;Dragonball Evolution&quot;; his voice was dubbed by Hiroya Ishimaru in the Japanese version.

The , referred to as Lords of Worlds in Viz&#x27;s English manga and the Kai in the English anime dub, are upper-level gods of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; multiverse. There are five at a time; one presiding over each of the four quadrants of the universe and the last, the , overseeing them all. The Kai reside in the heavens and are responsible for the lower-level deities who rule over individual planets. Later in the series, it is revealed that there are Supreme Kai, who are in charge of the Kai. It is possible for an individual Kai to be promoted to the rank of the Supreme Kai after a period of training as an apprentice; for example, Zamasu was the former of Universe 10 prior to being chosen by the ruling Supreme Kai of Universe 10 as his apprentice and eventual successor.

The North Kai of Universe 7, named King Kai in the English anime dub and as the Lord of the Northern Worlds in the Viz Media localization, trains Goku after his self-sacrifice to defeat Raditz, and eventually trains Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu, and Piccolo. He is the only other Kai to appear in the original manga besides the , and as such is usually simply referred to as or Northern King Kai. King Kai trains dead fighters that were allowed to keep their bodies if they manage to reach his small planet at the end of . Before training any students, he forces them to appeal to his strange sense of humor and catch his pet monkey ; in the anime, they must also hit the flying cricket with a mallet. King Kai provides Goku with martial arts training and two of his own techniques: the and the , which he himself was never able to master. He continues to help Goku and his friends throughout the series, lending his planet locating and telecommunicating abilities for their use. When Goku brings a self-destructing Cell to his planet, the explosion kills King Kai and Bubbles, and destroys his planet. As he is already in the afterlife, he only gains a halo, and in the anime appears to settle down on the Dai Kai&#x27;s planet. He is voiced by Jōji Yanami in Japanese media until episode twelve of &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, where Naoki Tatsuta took over the role, Don Brown and Dave Ward in the Ocean dub, Sean Schemmel in the Funimation dub, and Michael McConnohie in the Bang Zoom! Entertainment dub.

After the Saiyans were annexed by Frieza as a vassal state, he had no choice but to pledge allegiance to him, though he retains power over his people as a vassal. King Vegeta is eventually killed by Frieza, who later destroys his home planet and commits genocide against the entire Saiyan race. In &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods&quot; and in both the anime and manga versions of &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, King Vegeta is seen in flashbacks depicting his encounter with Beerus during the latter&#x27;s visit to Planet Vegeta. In Japanese, he is voiced by Banjō Ginga in episode 78 of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, Yukimasa Kishino in episode 124, and Masaharu Satō in the eighth &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; film.

===Shenron ===

, Shenron in Funimation&#x27;s anime dub, also known as the Eternal Dragon in the Ocean and Funimation dubs and as the Dragon God in the Harmony Gold dub, is the wish-granting dragon summoned when all seven of Earth&#x27;s Dragon Balls are gathered together. Throughout the series, several rules on the Dragon Balls&#x27; use and limitations on Shenron&#x27;s power are explained. After the wish is granted the balls scatter across the planet, turn to stone, are useless for a year, and cannot be detected by Bulma&#x27;s Dragon Radar. The Dragon Balls also become useless if Shenron is destroyed; in this case, they must be recreated by their creator. If their creator is killed, the Dragon Balls will also become inert until another creator is able to revive Shenron. Shenron cannot bestow a wish that exceeds the power of his creator, such as Shenron being unable to destroy the Saiyans before they came to earth. Midway through the series, the Dragon Balls are revealed to have been created by the Namekians, Earth&#x27;s Kami being one of them. A person can only be brought back to life once, and only if that person did not die of natural causes. Earth is without Dragon Balls for a period when Kami re-merges with Piccolo until Dende takes over the position of God. When Dende recreates Earth&#x27;s Dragon Balls, he makes it so that two wishes can be made at once, but each wish is still capable of resurrecting multiple individuals immediately. Shenron is voiced by Kenji Utsumi in the Japanese version of the series until his death in 2013 with the exclusion of episodes 192 and 193 in the series and the films, in which he is voiced by Masaharu Satō; Kōji Yada in the &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; remake; and Ryūzaburō Ōtomo since episode 97 of &quot;Kai&quot;. In the English versions of the series, he is voiced by Don Brown in the Ocean dub, and by Christopher Sabat in the Funimation dub.

Shenron&#x27;s Namekian counterpart is . Porunga has a large, muscular humanoid upper body and a dorsal fin down his back; the Dragon Balls are larger than Earth&#x27;s. Unlike Shenron, he can only bring a single person back to life at a time, but he can bring that person back multiple times whereas Shenron cannot. He can also grant three wishes instead of one, and the user must speak in the Namekian language. Porunga and the Namekian Dragon Balls were created by the planet&#x27;s Great Elder, who kept one ball and gave each of the other six to a different elder. When the Namekian Dragon Balls are used in the fight with Majin Buu, Porunga is upgraded, and can wish back multiple people at once and still grant three wishes. Porunga is voiced by Junpei Takiguchi in the Japanese version of the series with the exclusion of episode 283, in which he is voiced by Daisuke Gōri; he is voiced by Masaharu Satō in the video games. In &quot;Dragon Ball Kai&quot; Daisuke Gōri originally performed the role; after his death, Ryūzaburō Ōtomo took over. He is voiced by Christopher Sabat in the Funimation dub of the series.

&quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; introduces and the Super Dragon Balls which are spread throughout Universes 6 and 7. The Super Dragon Balls were created by the Dragon God , are the size of planets and have no restrictions on their wishes, although they only grant one and it must be spoken in the language of the gods. The Namekians took fragments of the Super Dragon Balls to create their own version on Namek. Super Shenron is voiced by Ryūzaburō Ōtomo in Japanese and Christopher Sabat in English.

===Supreme Kai===

The Glind (グリンド人 &quot;Gurindo-jin&quot;), also known as , referred to as Lords of Lords in Viz&#x27;s English manga and the Supreme Kai in the English anime dub, are a demonic species and some of the highest-level deities in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; canon. They stand alongside the Gods of Destruction, but below the Angels, Grand Priest, and Omni-King. The Glind originate from the second Demon World, but many chose to leave and become the gods known as Supreme Kai in the multiverse. Some, such as Degesu, chose to remain in the Demon Realm. The Glind are all naturally genderless, although use gendered terminology and pronouns, and are born from Glind trees in the second Demon World. They also are naturally inclined to seeking high positions of power, for better or for worse. While the Kai watch over the living world, the Supreme Kai watch over both the Other World (the afterlife in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series) and the living world. The Supreme Kai are known for recruiting mortal beings to become their disciples; Gohan and Trunks trained under their universe&#x27;s Supreme Kai to prepare for threats like Majin Buu and Dabura and gained access to healing powers in the process. The Supreme Kai and their followers wear a pair of earrings known as the Potara (ポタラ), which allow two individuals to fuse together and permit the wearer to use a Time Ring. In &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, the Gods of Destruction are introduced and are equal in status to the Supreme Kai.

The elder Supreme Kai, referred to as the , remains by his descendant&#x27;s side as an advisor following Majin Buu&#x27;s defeat and makes recurring appearances in subsequent &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; media.

Kibito and the East Supreme Kai become permanently fused into one being, known as in the manga and as Kibito Kai in the anime, via their Potara earrings. Kibito Kai assists in the final battle with Buu by teleporting Goku and the last survivors on Earth onto his planet and helps take Dende to New Namek to use its Dragon Balls to revive Earth and its people.

====Universe 10====
Gowasu (ゴワス), known as Gowas in the manga, is the ruling Supreme Kai of Universe 10. Gowasu chose Zamasu to be his successor. Unlike many of his peers from the other Universes, he does not resent Goku or view him as being disrespectful. Gowasu, along with his counterpart from Universe 7, traveled to an alternate future world where Zamasu ravaged the world to assist Goku and his associates in dealing with his former apprentice. During the Tournament of Power arc, Gowasu recruits members to fight on behalf of Universe 10, recording and uploading their exploits on a channel known as &quot;GodTube&quot;.

Gowasu is voiced by Tetsuo Goto in the Japanese version and by Garrett Schenck in the Funimation dub.

===Universe 6 inhabitants===
, also known as the , is the sixth of the twelve parallel universes introduced in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;. The God of Destruction is Champa, the Supreme Kai , and the Angel Vados. Universe 6 is linked with Universe 7 as twin universes, and that any planets or species that have existed and/or exist in Universe 7 will exist or are likely have existed in Universe 6, and vice versa. 

For example, the Saiyan people also exist in Universe 6, but their fates are completely different compared to their Universe 7 counterparts: they live relatively peaceful lives on their homeworld , and were never enslaved or eliminated by their enemies. Instead of conquering other planets, the Saiyans of Universe 6 tamed their desire to battle for good, and use their skills to protect the civilizations of their universe from danger and unrest. Characters from this universe were the first outside of Universe 7 to be introduced when other universes were revealed.

====Auta Magetta====
 is a Metalman from Universe 6. In the Tournament of Destroyers, he competed in a tournament against Universe 7. He fights Vegeta where his lava-spewing abilities started to heat up the ring. After breaking the barrier, Vegeta recovers from the overheating and knocks Auta Megetta out of the ring. In the Tournament of Power, Auta Magetta helps Frost attack Vegeta and Master Roshi. Vegeta manages to knock him out of the ring after insulting him.

Auta Magetta is voiced by Naoki Tatsuta in the Japanese version.

====Botamo====
 is a tall yellow humanoid bear from Universe 6 with rubber skin that can withstand any punch. In the Tournament of Destroyers, he faces off against Goku in the tournament against Universe 7. Goku has a hard time landing a blow on Botamo until he grabs him by the arm and throws him out of the ring. In the Tournament of Power, Botamo fights Gohan, whose punches lift him off the ground until it was enough for Gohan to use the Kamehameha to blast Botamo out of the ring.

Botamo is voiced by Yasuhiro Takato in the Japanese version and by Cris George in the Funimation dub.

====Cabba====
 is a Saiyan from Planet Sadala, and an elite member of the Sadala Defense Forces, first introduced in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;. Planet Sadala is also the original homeworld of the Saiyans of Universe 7, but according to Vegeta, it had been destroyed by internal discord long ago and no longer exists. Unlike the arrogant and savage nature exhibited by the vast majority of Saiyans from Universe 7, Cabba is presented as a good-natured and humble individual who speaks respectfully to everyone and sees himself as a protector of the weak. As one of Universe 6&#x27;s strongest warriors, he is recruited to join Champa&#x27;s team during the Tournament of Destroyers. Cabba bonds with Vegeta following the events of the tournament and looks up to him as a mentor, despite them fighting for opposing teams.

He is voiced by Daisuke Kishio in the Japanese version of the series. In the Funimation English Dub, his voice is supplied by Clifford Chapin.

====Caulifla and Kale====

 and are a pair of Saiyans from Universe 6. In &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, they are introduced as representatives of Universe 6 in the Tournament of Power. Later in the Tournament, they fuse together into a single being known as using a pair of Potara earrings gifted to them by their universe&#x27;s Supreme Kai but are ultimately defeated by Goku in his Ultra Instinct form.

====Champa====
 is Beerus&#x27;s twin brother and the God of Destruction of Universe 6, which is linked with the Seventh Universe as its &quot;twin universe&quot;. He has a long-running rivalry with Beerus, and they often bicker or engage in acts of one-upmanship like food contests and proxy wars. During the Universe 6 Saga, Champa holds a fighting tournament known as the Tournament of Destroyers; he forms a team by gathering the strongest warriors from Universe 6 to challenge Universe 7, which consists of Hit, Cabba, Frost, Botamo, and Auta Magetta.

Champa is voiced by Mitsuo Iwata in the Japanese version of the series. In the Funimation dub, his voice is provided by Jason Liebrecht.

====Frost====
 is the ruler of an empire based in Universe 6, and hails from the same race of beings as Universe 7&#x27;s Frieza. He is first introduced in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; as a competitor for his universe during the Tournament of Destroyers. Unlike Frieza, he is apparently perceived in a positive light by the majority of his subjects in Universe 6. 

Frost&#x27;s characterization differs between the manga and anime adaptions of &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;: in the anime he is a malevolent being like Frieza, while the manga depicts him as amoral and unsportsmanlike. In the anime, Frost faces off against Goku, Piccolo, and Vegeta in successive rounds in the tournament and defeats Goku and Piccolo by cheating and using his secret poison; Goku is allowed to return to the tournament after this is revealed and Frost is defeated by Vegeta. He is eventually exposed as a devious manipulator who feigns benevolence as well as being a space pirate and planet broker that discreetly profits from warmongering activities in his universe. In the manga, there is no mention of Frost being involved in criminal activities nor any indication of him being evil, and he appears to have a genuinely pleasant personality. He is indifferent to accusations of being a dirty fighter for using his poisonous stingers, as the tournament offers no prize money and the battles are ultimately pointless according to his perspective.

Frost is voiced by Ryūsei Nakao in the Japanese version of the series. In the Funimation English Dub, his voice is supplied by Greg Ayres.

====Hit====
, also known as and as the , is an assassin from Universe 6 introduced in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;. He is known for using his signature ability to manipulate time and for his capability to eliminate his assassination targets with a single strike. Over a millennium old, he is the strongest member of his universe&#x27;s team during the Tournament of Destroyers. Hit eventually rebels against Champa and throws his fight against Monaka (モナカ), the weakest participating member of the opposing Universe 7 team whose true purpose is to motivate Goku, by eliminating himself in the final match of the tournament.

In Japanese, Hit is voiced by Kazuhiro Yamaji. In the English dub, he is voiced Aaron Roberts in &quot;Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2&quot; and by Matthew Mercer in all subsequent appearances.

====Vados====
, Whis&#x27; sister, is an Angel from Universe 6 who is Champa&#x27;s attendant and martial arts teacher. Like Whis, her name is also derived from an alcoholic drink, . In &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, she is first seen accompanying Champa while searching for the Super Dragon Balls; they succeed in obtaining six of the seven Super Dragon Balls prior to the Tournament of Destroyers. Vados openly displays concern with Champa&#x27;s physique and health problems, and often teases him for being overweight, blaming his weight issues as the cause of his low stamina and his difficulty in keeping up with her training. She is also shown to be polite and respectful, even when addressing lesser beings or those who are not from her universe, such as Goku.

Vados is voiced by Yuriko Yamaguchi in the Japanese version. In the English version, Vados is voiced by Caitlin Glass in the Funimation English dub and by Wendee Lee and Tamara Ryan in the Bang Zoom! dub.

===Universe 11 inhabitants===
, also known as the , is the eleventh of the twelve parallel universes introduced in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;. Universe 11 is linked with Universe 2 as twin universes. The Pride Troopers (プライドトルーパーズ &quot;Puraido Torūpāsu&quot;) are a powerful superhero team who operate in this universe; they work under their God of Destruction, and the most elite Pride Troopers made up the entirety of Team Universe 11 participating in the Tournament of Power, where their combined strength is portrayed as the biggest threat faced by Team Universe 7.

====Belmod====
, known as Vermoud in the English localization of the &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; anime, is a slender humanoid in clown makeup and the God of Destruction of Universe 11. He dislikes evil and is proud of the Pride Troopers&#x27; work. Toppo is his candidate for God of Destruction when Belmod retires. He is usually accompanied by his attendant and martial arts teacher Marcarita.

Belmod is voiced by Masami Kikuchi in the Japanese version and by Markus Lloyd in the Funimation dub.

====Jiren====

, also referred to as , is a member of the Pride Troopers. His quiet, stoic demeanor is a glimpse of his solitary nature; he is haunted by his past losses and desperately tries to undo it all by forging his own path of justice. While fighting for justice, he has no loyalty to anyone beyond himself, believing that trusting others will ultimately backfire. Jiren is very proud of his strength and refuses to accept the help of his comrades even in dire moments when he is under severe pressure from his opponents.

====Toppo====
, known as Top in the English localization of the &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; anime, is the tall and burly leader of the Pride Troopers, who act as guardians of peace within Universe 11 and form the majority of participants representing Universe 11 in the Tournament of Power. Toppo is a candidate to become Universe 11&#x27;s next God of Destruction, being the second most-powerful mortal within his home universe after Jiren.

Top is voiced by Kenji Nomura in the Japanese version and by Ray Hurd in the Funimation dub.

====Dyspo====
 is the Sphynx cat-like blitz captain of the Pride Troopers. In the Tournament of Power, he uses his own super-speed when fighting Hit before retreating. During his fight with Frieza, Dyspo also fights against Gohan who sacrifices himself to get Dyspo out of the ring.

Dyspo is voiced by Bin Shimada in the Japanese version and by Christopher Dontrell Piper in the Funimation dub.

===Zeno ===
, also known as the Omni-King and as the Lord of Everything in Viz&#x27;s English manga, is the supreme deity of the whole &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; multiverse. Depicted as a childlike humanoid figure, Zeno ranks above all other mortals and gods in the series and is treated with utmost reverence and fear, as he has the power to erase entire universes from existence at will. He is served by a pair of identical-looking attendants and is advised by the Grand Minister. First appearing during the aftermath of the Tournament of Destroyers between Universes 6 and 7, he is addressed by his subjects as in original Japanese media and as Grand Zeno or the Omni-King in the English dub. Goku is a notable exception; he befriends and addresses Zeno in a casual manner () in the original Japanese, &quot;Zenny&quot; in the English dub), which is considered disrespectful and lacking in etiquette by most characters in the series, though Zeno took to Goku and his outgoing friendliness almost immediately after they first met. As of the &quot;Future&quot; Trunks Saga, there are two coequal Zenos in the present time line. Zeno is voiced by Satomi Kōrogi in Japanese and by Sarah Wiedenheft in English.

====Grand Minister====
The , also known as the Grand Priest in Viz&#x27;s English manga, is the principal advisor and a guiding figure to Zeno as well as the father of all twelve Angels. He is responsible for enforcing Zeno&#x27;s decrees and welcoming guests to the supreme deity&#x27;s residential palace. Additionally, the Grand Minister served as the referee of the Zeno Expo and the Tournament of Power.

The character is voiced by Masaya Takatsuka in the Japanese version and by Josh Grelle in the Funimation dub.

==Merchandise==
Official and unofficial merchandise were released based on characters from the series, including key chains, action-figures, plush toys, T-shirts, tumblers and trading cards. Characters from the series also appear in licensed video games.

==Cultural impact==

===Fandom===
Several celebrities and professional athletes from around the world have made references to characters from the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series. For example, American UFC fighter Marcus Brimage cited the &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; series as one of his inspirations for taking up mixed-martial arts. The New Day appeared in full costumes patterned after Saiyan armor at WWE&#x27;s WrestleMania 32 as a part of their entrance for a match against The League of Nations. Argentine professional footballer Eduardo Salvio often celebrates his goals with gestures and signals referencing the signature attacks of various &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; characters.

===Critical reception===
Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network (ANN) stated, &quot;Few anime series have mainstreamed it the way &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; has. To a certain generation of television consumers its characters are as well known as any in the animated realm, and for many it was the first step into the wilderness of anime fandom.&quot; His colleague Allen Divers praised the story and humor of the manga for being very good at conveying all of the characters&#x27; personalities. Carlo Santos, also from ANN, commented that the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; cast &quot;may not be as stylish-looking as today&#x27;s shonen adventure protagonists, but every character has a distinctive set of physical features, making them identifiable at any moment&quot;. DVD Talk&#x27;s Todd Douglass praised the &quot;deep, insightful, and well-developed&quot; characters, writing &quot;[f]ew shows can claim to have a cast quite like Dragon Ball&#x27;s, and that&#x27;s a testament to the creative genius of Toriyama.&quot; Tim Jones of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews commended the series for having good characterization, saying: &quot;You do care about them, and want to get to know more about them.&quot; He considered them to be different from stereotypical stock characters, but noted that they have much more development early on than when compared to later in the series.

Theron Martin, also from ANN, wrote that while the characters are not complicated, they are &quot;easy to love, hate, and respect&quot;, and are a major reason for the series popularity. For example, he described the &quot;immense pride of Vegeta&quot;, and how that can be a fatal flaw, especially shines through, as do the freewheeling spirits of Goten and Trunks, the naiveté of Buu and Mr. Satan&#x27;s attention-loving, glory-hound nature, while Number 18 shows a cunning side. He also praised the themes from the warriors, saying they speak to &quot;basic yet powerful themes like faith, confidence, heroism, sacrifice, love, and understanding what is truly worth fighting for&quot;, and the ways they react while fighting, although the fights can sometimes become very long with little plot development. On the other hand, the handling of the series&#x27; major female characters, such as Chi-Chi, Bulma and Videl, have been subject to some criticism. Martin felt that the series overused the plot device of having characters &quot;grow seemingly untouchably powerful, only to be put out when eventually upstaged&quot;.

<text>Henry Watterson (February 16, 1840 – December 22, 1921), the son of a U.S. Congressman from Tennessee, became a prominent journalist in Louisville, Kentucky, as well as a Confederate soldier, author and partial term U.S. Congressman. A Democrat like his father Harvey Magee Watterson, Henry Watterson for five decades after the American Civil War was a part-owner and editor of the &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot;, which was founded by Walter Newman Haldeman and would be purchased by Robert Worth Bingham in 1919, who would end the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist&#x27;s association with the paper.

==Early and family life==
Born in Washington, D.C., on February 16, 1840, to the former Tilithacumi (Talitha) Black of Spring Hill, Tennessee and her husband, Harvey Magee Watterson, a Shelbyville, Tennessee lawyer and U.S. Congressman. His father was close to President Andrew Jackson, also from Tennessee, and in 1843 would become the publisher of the &quot;Washington Union&quot;, the main newspaper of the Democratic party of that era. His uncle in Ohio would also become a newspaper editor, lawyer, Union soldier during the Civil War and ultimately Republican U.S. Supreme Court justice Stanley Matthews.

Henry was an only child. He was sickly, with very poor eyesight and that only in one eye, so that his mother home-schooled him in Washington, D.C., and their home in Nashville, Tennessee until he was twelve years old. She then sent him to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he received his only formal education, at an academy run by an Episcopal priest, and he also ran the school paper, the &quot;New Era&quot;, on a press his father donated.

After the American Civil War as discussed below, in September 1865, Watterson returned to Nashville to marry Rebecca Ewing, with whom he would have six sons and two daughters. They were able to hire live-in Irish servants, and by 1880 his parents also lived with them. Their sons were Ewing (1868–), Henry Jr. (1877–) and Harvey W. Watterson (1879–1908) and their daughters were Lady (1871–) and Ethel Watterson Gilmour (1880–1907).

==Career==

Watterson became a newspaper reporter early in his life. In 1856 he moved to New York to work on various publication, and in 1858 he moved to Washington to work on other publications.

When his father returned to Tennessee in 1861 after the outbreak of the American Civil War, Henry Watterson did too. He volunteered for the Confederate States Army, and was attached at various times to the staffs of Generals Joseph E. Johnston, Leonidas Polk and Nathan B. Forrest. His main contribution to the Confederate war effort, however, was editorial, with the &quot;Chattanooga Rebel&quot; and the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot;. After the Confederacy lost, Watterson edited the &quot;Cincinnati Evening Post&quot; for six months. By September 1865 Watterson returned to Nashville, married, become editor and part owner of the &quot;Nashville Banner,&quot; where he began his “New Departure” campaign urging national reconciliation.

Watterson ultimately settled down in Louisville, Kentucky, having met Walter Newman Haldeman during the war, and began editing the &quot;Louisville Journal&quot;. That paper merged with the &quot;Louisville Courier&quot; in 1868, forming the &quot;Courier-Journal&quot;. This paper soon gained national attention for its excellent reporting. Watterson was a leader of the Liberal Republican movement in 1872. By 1876 he was a Democrat; his proposal for hundreds of thousands of Democrats to march on Washington to force the election of Tilden angered President Ulysses S. Grant, who noted that nobody threatened Grant. Watterson was elected to fill the rest of Edward Y. Parsons&#x27; term in the U.S. House when Parsons died in office.

Watterson was called &quot;the last of the great personal journalists&quot;, writing colorful and controversial editorials on many topics under the pen name &quot;Marse Henry&quot;. Hundreds of American papers republished them; they were an early exemplar of the syndicated column which played a significant role creating public support for U.S. intervention in the First World War. Watterson won the Pulitzer Prize in 1918 for two editorials supporting U.S. entry into World War I (&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;), and he remained the paper&#x27;s editor until 1919, retiring after conflicts with Robert Worth Bingham, who purchased the paper in 1918.

During his tenure as editor, Watterson was a Democratic representative in Congress from 1876 to 1877. He was also a five-time delegate to the Democratic National Convention, where, in 1892, Watterson received a smattering of votes for the vice presidential nomination. He became widely known as a lecturer and orator. His publications include &quot;History of the Spanish–American War&quot; (1899) and &quot;The Compromises of Life&quot; (1902).

==Death and legacy==

Watterson died in Jacksonville, Duval County, Florida in 1921.

The portion of I-264 from the junction with US 31W to its northeastern terminus at I-71 is known as the Watterson Expressway.

A Jefferson County Public School in eastern Louisville is named Watterson Elementary School.

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

<text>The red-headed bunting (Emberiza bruniceps) is a passerine bird in the bunting family Emberizidae.

It breeds in central Asia, including Afghanistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia; Russian Federation (European Russia, Central Asian Russia), Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and China. It is migratory, wintering in India and Bangladesh. Its status in western Europe, where it is a vagrant, has been confused by escapes, especially as this species has been more commonly recorded than the closely related black-headed bunting, despite the latter having a more westerly breeding range. Reports in Britain have declined dramatically over recent years, coinciding with the decline in some Emberizidae species from the impact of illegal trade. An individual found on Shetland in 2010 was deemed to be wild in origin.

The red-headed bunting breeds in open scrubby areas including agricultural land. It lays three to five eggs in a nest in a tree or bush. Its natural food consists of seeds, or when feeding young, insects.

This bird is 17 cm long, larger than reed bunting, with a long tail. The breeding male has bright yellow underparts, green upperparts and a brownish-red face and breast.

The female is a washed-out version of the male, with paler underparts, a grey-brown back and a greyish head. The juvenile is similar, and both can be difficult to separate from the corresponding plumages of black-headed bunting bird.

The song, given from a high perch, is a jerky &quot;sweet-sweet-churri-churri-churri&quot;.

<doc id="1001692" wikidata="Q2142723" url="?curid=1001692" title="The Divorce of Lady X">
<text>The Divorce of Lady X is a 1938 British Technicolor romantic comedy film produced by London Films; it stars Merle Oberon, Laurence Olivier, Ralph Richardson and Binnie Barnes. It was directed by Tim Whelan and produced by Alexander Korda from a screenplay by Ian Dalrymple and Arthur Wimperis, adapted by Lajos Bíró from the play &quot;Counsel&#x27;s Opinion&quot; by Gilbert Wakefield. The music score was by Miklós Rózsa and Lionel Salter and the cinematography by Harry Stradling.

The film is a remake of the 1933 film &quot;Counsel&#x27;s Opinion&quot;, also from London Films and in which Binnie Barnes appeared in the role played by Merle Oberon.

==Plot==
A thick evening fog strands party guests at a smart London hotel. All rooms end up being taken. Leslie Steele, a young, pretty but madcap socialite, barges her way into Everard Logan&#x27;s suite. He promptly registers one objection after another, but all his efforts to evict Leslie are to no avail. He thus agrees to a compromise, allowing her use of the bedroom, while he takes another room in the suite. She spends the entire time teasing and taunting him.

By breakfast, Logan changes his tune and insists they meet again. But while he&#x27;s out of the room, dressing, she mysteriously bolts for home, which she shares with her grandfather/judge. He informs her that Logan is a barrister specializing in divorce cases. The zany, impulsive Ms. Steele then tells her grandfather she intends to marry Logan. To her surprise, she learns Logan will be pleading a case before her grandfather&#x27;s court that day. So she attends the proceeding to observe her intended in action – and to her further surprise, she sees him mercilessly rip to shreds a woman accused of adultery.

As Leslie and Everard spend the rest of the film struggling to adjust to each other&#x27;s whims and differences, a subplot involving Lord Mere, one of Logan&#x27;s clients, is interwoven into the complicated story-line. A confusion of identities ensues, as at one point, Logan is led to mistakenly believe that Leslie is actually Lord Mere&#x27;s wife. But after a weekend fox hunt at the lord&#x27;s manor, all conflicts are satisfactorily explained away, and the two lovers are reconciled.

By the story&#x27;s end, Leslie has successfully transformed Everard from the inhumane, hostile, woman-browbeating counselor she witnessed earlier into an empathetic, understanding, sensitive courtroom-interrogator of &quot;the gentle sex&quot;.

==Critical reception==
A reviewer for &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Alexander Korda&#x27;s Technicolored comedy is rich, smart entertainment&quot;, and also praised the acting: &quot;Oberon impresses. Olivier does his role pretty well, retarded somewhat by an annoying bit of pouting business. Two key performances which sparkle are those of Ralph Richardson and Morton Selten&quot;. whereas several decades later, Leonard Maltin described the film as a &quot;Cute but extremely dated screwball comedy,&quot;; and the &quot;Radio Times&quot; found the whole thing &quot;quite amusing...in a daft and inconsequential way&quot;.

Emanuel Levy gave the film a &quot;C&quot; grade and wrote that &quot;Though opulent in color costumes and design, this minor British screwball comedy is mostly known for its on-screen teaming of two young actors, Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson, in their pre-Hollywood era, who would become legendary stars&quot;.

<text>Jere Kalervo Lehtinen (born June 24, 1973) is a Finnish former professional ice hockey forward. A right winger, he was drafted in the third round, 88th overall, in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft by the Minnesota North Stars. Lehtinen played his entire 15-year National Hockey League (NHL) career with the organization after the franchise moved to Dallas in 1993. A two-way forward, Lehtinen is perhaps best known for his defensive responsibilities, for which he won the Frank J. Selke Trophy three times as the NHL&#x27;s top defensive forward. After his retirement, he has served as the general manager of the Finnish national ice hockey team. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Playing career==
===Finland===

Lehtinen played in the 1987 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a youth team from Espoo.

Lehtinen started his professional career with his hometown team, Kiekko-Espoo. The team was jammed in first division in 1991 but they managed to win the division and gained a spot in the Finnish SM-liiga, from there Lehtinen started his professional career. He spent another year with Kiekko-Espoo, but the team struggled, and after one season, Lehtinen received an offer from one of the biggest clubs in Finland at the time, TPS in Turku. He signed with TPS in the summer of 1993 and once the season started, he soon blossomed offensively. Lehtinen was immediately paired with another future NHLer, Saku Koivu, and the two formed an integral part of TPS&#x27;s great season. Although they won the regular season title by a large margin, they lost to Jokerit in the finals.

The following season, TPS and Lehtinen went all the way again, this time defeating Jokerit in the final series, 3–2. After the SM-liiga season was over, Lehtinen received an invite to the 1995 World Championships. Finland progressed to the final, defeating Sweden 4–1, winning Finland&#x27;s first IIHF World Championship gold medal. Lehtinen was part of the renowned Finnish top line, dubbed by Finnish fans as the &quot;Ankkalinnan pojat&quot; (&quot;The boys of Duckburg,&quot; a reference to their nicknames &quot;Tupu, Hupu, Lupu&quot;; &quot;Huey, Dewey, Louie&quot;) with Saku Koivu and Ville Peltonen, another future NHLer. The three also made up the tournament&#x27;s all-star line.

===Dallas Stars===
====1995–2003====
After an impressive year in 1995, where Lehtinen won both the SM-liiga and World Championship, he went overseas to play in the NHL. He saw only one game in the minors and was part of the Dallas Stars organization instantly. Lehtinen worked his way up in three years to join Mike Modano on the team&#x27;s first line and was nominated for the Frank J. Selke Trophy for the first time in 1996–97 season. During 1997–98 season, he was voted to the 1998 NHL All-Star Game. It was the first year the NHL introduced a new system in which European players play against North American players. Lehtinen&#x27;s fellow countrymen Saku Koivu, Teemu Selänne and Jari Kurri were also voted to the Game. The same year, Lehtinen was again a nominee for the Selke Trophy as the best defensive forward and eventually won the prestigious award. He is the first Finnish player to have won the award. Lehtinen was also part of the bronze-winning Finnish team at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.

In 1999, the Stars progressed to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they defeated the Buffalo Sabres in six games, winning the Stanley Cup. In the series, Lehtinen scored the first goal in the decisive Game 6, then assisted on Brett Hull&#x27;s Cup-winning goal in overtime. That year, Lehtinen set career-high statistics and also captured the Selke Trophy, becoming just the third player in NHL history to win the award in consecutive seasons.

Despite the highs of the previous season, the 1999–2000 campaign was a tough one for Lehtinen. He played in only 17 regular season games due to ankle problems, fracturing it early in the season and sidelining for 30 games. After he had seemingly recovered from the injury, he returned to the lineup, but was again sidelined after playing just eight games, forcing him out of Dallas&#x27; lineup for an additional 35 games. However, he returned to help his team in the 2000 playoffs, where the Stars again progressed to the Finals, but were defeated by the New Jersey Devils in six games.

Lehtinen bounced back to his old form in 2000–01 season, putting up a strong season statistics-wise. Although they again made the playoffs, the Stars, however, did not progress go as deep as they had in previous years and were dispatched in the second round by the St. Louis Blues in a four-game sweep.

In 2001–02, Lehtinen had a stellar season. Although the Stars failed to qualify for the 2002 playoffs, Lehtinen managed to score 25 goals, 24 assists and finished first on the team in plus-minus with +27. He was again voted to the NHL All-Star Game, but was unable to play due to injury. He ranked seventh in Lady Byng Memorial Trophy voting and was again nominated for the Selke Trophy, though he came in short; Michael Peca was honored with the award for second time in his career.

After an impressive 2001–02, Lehtinen continued his fine form in 2002–03. He led the Stars in goals with 31, a new career high, as well as in plus-minus (+39), which ranked fourth in the NHL. He also recorded his second career NHL hat-trick, coming against the Los Angeles Kings. Moreover, Lehtinen became only the third player in League history to win the Selke Trophy three times, tying Guy Carbonneau for three and just one behind Bob Gainey, who has won it four times.

====2003–2010====

The 2003–04 season, was a disappointment to Lehtinen, as injury problems to his knee allowed him to play just 58 games, where he scored 26 points. The Stars were knocked out by the Colorado Avalanche in the first playoff round.

Before the NHL lockout for the 2004–05 season, the World Cup of Hockey was played. Lehtinen once again represented Finland and the Finns met Canada in the final; the latter won the gold with a 3–2 win over Finland.

Lehtinen underwent knee surgery during the lockout season. After successful surgery and rehabilitation, he excelled when NHL play resumed for the 2005–06 season, tying a career-high in points (52) and setting a new career-high in goals (33). The Stars won the Pacific Division title, their seventh in past ten seasons. However, Dallas was once again eliminated in the first playoff round, again at the hands of the Colorado Avalanche. Lehtinen was again a nominee for the Selke Trophy, but ultimately finished third in voting.

The 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin took place in the middle of the 2005–06 NHL season. Lehtinen was again a vital part of Team Finland&#x27;s journey to the gold medal game. Like in previous international tournaments, Lehtinen was placed in a line with Saku Koivu and Teemu Selänne. However, Finland lost the final bitterly 3–2 to their nemesis, Team Sweden. Koivu and Selänne were the tournament&#x27;s joint top scorer; Lehtinen finished tied for seventh. Had Finland won the final, Lehtinen would have become the first Finn to join the Triple Gold Club.

In the 2006–07 season, Lehtinen scored 26 goals and led the team in goals for second consecutive season. The Stars, however, failed to progress from the first round of the playoffs for the third season in a row, falling to the Vancouver Canucks. Despite the series stretched to seven games, Lehtinen failed to contribute a single point for his team.

Lehtinen began the 2007–08 season strongly, posting six goals and 13 assists (19 points) in just 21 games before suffering a sports hernia. He returned on February 1, 2008, in a game against the Edmonton Oilers after a 33-game layoff. He marked his return with an assist on a Jussi Jokinen goal in the game.

Lehtinen became one of just six players in Olympic ice hockey history to win four tournament medals when Finland defeated Slovakia 5–3 at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver on February 27, 2010. Lehtinen also is one of only seven ice hockey players who have appeared in at least five Olympic games.

On December 8, 2010, Lehtinen officially announced his retirement from professional hockey, finishing with 243 goals and 271 assists and a career plus-minus rating of +176 in 875 NHL games, all with the Stars. Impressively, he never finished a season with a negative plus-minus until his final season in the NHL.

On February 11, 2017, the Stars announced that they would retire Lehtinen&#x27;s No. 26 jersey in the 2017–18 season as part of their 25th anniversary in Dallas; it was retired on November 24, 2017, before the Stars&#x27; game against the Calgary Flames.

==Personal life==
Lehtinen met his wife, Jaana, at the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. The two were married in June 1998 and since the ceremony was only a few days after the NHL Awards, Lehtinen was not present to accept the first Frank J. Selke Trophy of his career. The couple has twin girls, Anna and Sofia, and one son, Joel.

<text>Nestopia UE - and its predecessor Nestopia - are open-source NES/Famicom emulators designed to emulate the NES hardware as accurately as possible.

==Features==
The requirements for the original Nestopia were considered higher than some of its contemporaries such as Stella. To run an optimal emulation, the program requires a minimum 800 MHz processor. Its high requirement is due to its accurate emulation of the NES hardware. The emulator will play most ROMs and has a strong port for the Apple Macintosh. 

The original Nestopia allowed customization of colors, sounds, and graphics. It includes special features such as Power Glove. Brandon Widdler of &quot;Digital Trends&quot; considers the emulator one of the best for the NES, though he admits that it has fewer features than its rival FCEUX.

==Development history==
Nestopia was originally developed for Windows by Martin Freij. Richard Bannister and R. Belmont later ported it to Mac OS X and Linux, respectively. Original development ended in 2008, but forked into Nestopia UE.

<text>Jaffa Cakes are a cake introduced by McVitie and Price in the UK in 1927 and named after Jaffa oranges. The most common form of Jaffa cakes are circular, in diameter and have three layers: a Genoise sponge base, a layer of orange flavoured jam and a coating of chocolate. Each cake is 46 calories. Jaffa Cakes are also available as bars or in small packs, and in larger and smaller sizes. The original Jaffa Cakes now come in packs of 10, 20, 30, or 40, having been downsized in 2017 from 12 or 24 per pack.

Because McVitie&#x27;s did not register the name &quot;Jaffa Cakes&quot; as a trademark, other biscuit manufacturers and supermarkets have made similar products under the same name. The product&#x27;s classification as a cake or biscuit was part of a VAT tribunal in 1991, with the court finding in McVitie&#x27;s favour that Jaffa Cakes should be considered cakes and not biscuits for tax purposes. In 2012 they were ranked the best selling cake or biscuit in the United Kingdom.

==McVitie and Price&#x27;s Jaffa Cakes==
===Manufacture===
McVitie&#x27;s entire line of Jaffa Cakes are produced at the McVitie&#x27;s factory in Stockport. The Jaffa Cake production area covers an acre () and includes a production line over a mile () long. In the early 2000s, it pioneered the development of advanced machine vision technology for quality control.

===Flavour variants===
Although Jaffa Cakes are usually orange flavour, limited edition flavours have been available, such as lemon-and-lime, strawberry and blackcurrant. McVities launched limited-edition pineapple flavour Jaffa Cakes in early 2020. In early 2021, McVitie&#x27;s unveiled the new flavours cherry and passionfruit.
In mid 2023, McVitie&#x27;s launched Raspberry flavour Jaffa Cakes. In June 2024, McVitie&#x27;s launched Cola Bottle flavour Jaffa Cakes.

===Legal status===
In the United Kingdom, value added tax is payable on chocolate-covered biscuits, but not on chocolate-covered cakes. McVities defended its classification of Jaffa Cakes as cakes at a VAT tribunal in 1991, against the ruling that Jaffa cakes were biscuits due to their size and shape, and the fact that they were often eaten in place of biscuits. McVities insisted that the product was a cake, and produced a giant Jaffa Cake in court to illustrate its point.

The court discounted the expert evidence, as it went beyond the capacity of an ordinary purchaser.

The product was assessed on the following criteria:

* The product&#x27;s name was regarded as a minor consideration.
* The ingredients were regarded as similar to those of a cake, producing a thin cake-like mixture rather than the thick dough of a biscuit.
* The product&#x27;s texture was regarded as being that of a sponge cake.
* The product hardens when stale, in the manner of a cake.
* A substantial part of a Jaffa Cake, in terms of bulk and texture, is sponge.
* In size, a Jaffa Cake is more like a biscuit than a cake.
* The product was generally displayed for sale alongside other biscuits, rather than with cakes.
* The product is presented as a snack and eaten with the fingers, like a biscuit, rather than with a fork as a cake might be. The tribunal also considered that children would eat them in a few mouthfuls, in the manner of a sweet.

The court was adjudicated by Mr Donald Potter QC, who found in favour of McVitie&#x27;s and ruled that whilst Jaffa Cakes had characteristics of both cakes and biscuits, the product should be considered a cake and not a biscuit, meaning that VAT is not paid on Jaffa Cakes in the United Kingdom.

The Irish Revenue Commissioners also regard Jaffa Cakes as cakes, since their moisture content is greater than 12%. As a result, they are charged the reduced rate of VAT (13.5% ).

In 2021, artificially intelligent binary classifiers &quot;usually used in the field of astronomy&quot; were trained on 92 traditional recipes of cakes and biscuits and determined Jaffa Cakes to be cakes.

=== Advertising ===
In 2021 McVities launched a £4.7 million advertising and social media campaign to promote the brand.

==Other brands==

* Mondelez brand Lefèvre-Utile (LU) produced Jaffa Cakes under the commercial name PiM&#x27;s. The jam flavours include cherry, orange, pear, raspberry, lemon, chocolate mousse and hazelnuts, etc.
* Delicje Szampańskie are the Polish equivalent and had been manufactured by E. Wedel since 1977. , Delicje brand belongs to Mondelēz International, Inc.
* Jaffa Crvenka produces Jaffa Cakes in Serbia.
* Mondelez Czech Republic s.r.o. distributes this type of product under the traditional Slovak chocolate brand Figaro in Czechia and Slovakia with the name &quot;Čoko Piškoty&quot; or čokopiškoty (= chocolate sponge bisquits) in 5 flavour variants. The names &quot;PiM&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;Jaffa Cakes&quot; are not very familiar in Czechia and Slovakia, but are also sometimes used. Jaffa Cakes were also distributed by Mondelez under the Czech-Silesian chocolate brand Opavia or German brand Milka.
* In the United States, Aldi sells Jaffa Cakes under its Benton&#x27;s brand.

<text>The United States Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control (also known as the Senate Narcotics Caucus) is a U.S. congressional caucus created to monitor and encourage the U.S. government and private programs seeking to expand international cooperation against drug abuse and narcotics trafficking, and promote international compliance with narcotics control treaties, including eradication.

As a formal organization of the United States Senate, the Caucus has the status of a standing committee. It has subpoena power and is authorized to take testimony of witnesses and to produce books, records, papers, and documents that it deems necessary. In the past it has dealt with international cooperation, eradication, trafficking, interdiction, border control, drug strategies, assessments of Federal programs, and money laundering issues.

The Caucus has held numerous hearings over the years and has issued a number of reports on U.S. narcotics control policy. The primary responsibilities of the INCC have involved monitoring of compliance with international narcotics control treaties and agreements, and oversight of U.S. counter narcotics policy and activities.

==Establishment==
The United States Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control was originally called the United States Commission on International Narcotics Control, when it was established on August 16, 1985, by the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for fiscal 1986 and 1987.

Pursuant to the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of 1986 (), the name of the Commission was changed to the United States Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, effective November 13, 1985. (The House of Representatives had requested the name change because it would more accurately reflect the membership of the group, given that no House Members were to be appointed to it.)

==Membership==
The group&#x27;s authorizing legislation () provided that the Commission draw its membership from the Senate and from experts in the private sector. Specifically, the group was to be composed of 12 members, seven Members of the U.S. Senate appointed by the President of the Senate, and five members from the private sector appointed by the President of the United States. Four of the seven Senators, including one designated as Chairman, were to be selected from the majority party after consultation with the Majority Leader, and three, including the Member designated as Co-Chairman, were to be selected from the minority party, after consultation with the Minority Leader. The five Commission members selected from the private sector were to be appointed by the President after consultation with the Members of the appropriate congressional committees.

The appointment of private citizens was discontinued after 1987 in accordance with the group&#x27;s redesignation as the U.S. Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control.

<doc id="1001727" wikidata="Q7737335" url="?curid=1001727" title="The Goose Steps Out">
<text>The Goose Steps Out is a British film released in 1942, starring Will Hay, who also co-directed with Basil Dearden. It is a comedy of mistaken identity, with Hay acting as a German spy and also an Englishman who is his double. It was the film debut of Peter Ustinov.

==Plot summary==

Set during the Second World War, the film recounts the adventures of William Potts (Will Hay) after it is discovered that he is an exact double of a German spy who the British have just captured. Potts is flown into Nazi Germany to impersonate the spy and instructed to seek out and bring back details of a new German secret weapon.

On arrival, however, Potts is placed in charge of a group of apparently rabidly-fascist young students who are being trained to work as spies in Britain. Potts attempts to undermine this by convincing the youngsters that the proper British way of saluting a great leader is to apply the V-sign, which they therefore do repeatedly and enthusiastically in the direction of a portrait of the Führer. At a function where he hopes to gather information about the weapon (a gasfire bomb), Potts succeeds only in getting blind drunk and admitting that he is a British agent. Luckily, some members of his class of Nazi youths turn out to be sympathetic Austrians and they help him obtain the secret he seeks. Potts and his new friends eventually commandeer a plane and fly back to Britain, crashing in a tree outside the War Office in London.

==Direction==

Will Hay shared directorial credit with Basil Dearden following on from their previous collaboration, &quot;The Black Sheep of Whitehall&quot;. Art Director, Michael Relph described Dearden and Hay&#x27;s input as directors &#x27;Basil was very expert at directing comedy, and that is what he contributed when working with Will Hay. Hay was important as a star, and he could more or less dictate what he wanted to direct, but really he did not direct. Basil directed and supplied all the expertise that Hay probably lacked.&#x27; Barry Morse who played Kurt had a slightly different take on the directorial responsibilities. &#x27;Basil Dearden was largely concerned with purely technical things, angles, lenses, lighting details. He didn&#x27;t have a very active part, it seemed to me, in the actual performance directing. That was something which Will Hay had a certain amount to do with.&#x27;&quot;The Goose Steps Out&quot; is also noted as the film debut of a young Peter Ustinov.

==Cast==

* Will Hay as William Potts/Muller
* Charles Hawtrey as Max
* Frank Pettingell as Professor Hoffman
* Julien Mitchell as General Von Glotz
* Peter Ustinov as Krauss
* Barry Morse as Kurt
* Leslie Harcourt as Vagel
* Peter Croft as Hans
* Ann Firth as Lena
* Ray Lovell as Schmidt
* Jeremy Hawk as ADC
* Aubrey Mallalieu as Rector
* John Williams as Major Bishop
* Lawrence O&#x27;Madden as Colonel Truscott
* William Hartnell as German officer at railway station (uncredited)
* Leslie Dwyer as German on train (uncredited)

==Reception==
Sunday Times August 30, 1942 by Dilys Powell &quot;The Goose Steps Out gives us Will Hay as a British Agent lecturing to the German espionage class on British pronunciation and the life of the pub. This is good Will Hay and so is the attempted theft from the gas bomb laboratory: the slapstick in the plane I found more monotonous and less convivial.
* A current reviewer for &quot;TV Guide&quot; calls this film, &quot;a funny programme.&quot;
* In &quot;Forever Ealing&quot;, George Perry wrote, &quot; In the climate of 1942, when British morale was at its lowest, what may now seem jingoistic acted as an innocent safety valve, and the film was popularly received.&quot;

DVD/Blu-ray: In 2017 to celebrate the 75th Anniversary of the film, a digitally restored version was released by Studio Canal. The Special features include the Will Hay short film, Go to Blazes (1942), an Interview with Graham Rinaldi, author of the 2009 Will Hay biography and a Will Hay audio featurette by Simon Heffer, part of the BBC Radio 3 series, The Essay: British Film Comedians.

<text>The house bunting (Emberiza sahari) is a passerine bird in the bunting family Emberizidae.

It is a resident breeder of dry country from northwestern Africa from Morocco south to Mali and east to Chad. In Morocco, the species has expanded from the Atlas Mountains northwards since the 1960s, and has recently reached Tangier and Tétouan on the southern shore of the Strait of Gibraltar. The house bunting breeds around human habitation, laying two to four eggs in a nest in a hole in a wall or building. Its natural food consists seeds, or when feeding young, insects.

It is 14 cm long, similar in size to the striolated bunting and smaller than the rock bunting. The breeding male has a sandy orange-brown body and a grey head slightly dark-streaked but without the white supercilium that the striolated bunting has. The female&#x27;s head has a brown tint to the grey, and more diffused streaking.

The house bunting has recently been split from the closely related striolated bunting, of which it used to be treated as a subspecies, &quot;Emberiza striolata sahari&quot;. The striolated bunting has stronger facial striping and a paler belly than the house bunting.

The incubation period of the clutch of three eggs is 12–14 days.
The song, given from a perch, is similar to but weaker than that of the common chaffinch.

In Morocco, the species is traditionally regarded as sacred, and has become very tame, freely entering and feeding inside houses, shops and mosques.

<text>Interstate 264 (I-264) is a partial loop around the city of Louisville, Kentucky, south of the Ohio River. An auxiliary route of I-64, it is signed as the Shawnee Expressway for its first from its western terminus at I-64/US 150 to US 31W/US 60 and as the Watterson Expressway for the remainder of its length from US 31W/US 60 to its eastern terminus at I-71. It is in length and runs an open circle around central Louisville. It is the only auxiliary route of I-64 outside of Virginia.

I-264 is Louisville&#x27;s inner beltway (in conjunction with I-64 and I-71), and the later constructed I-265, the Gene Snyder Freeway, is Louisville&#x27;s outer beltway. I-264 is currently used as the primary detour route when I-64 is closed through Downtown Louisville. However, in late 2016 with the completion of the Lewis and Clark Bridge, the formerly separate segments of I-265 in Kentucky and Indiana have been connected to provide another detour route.

In discussions about the city, I-264 is often used as a rough line dividing the older areas of Louisville from its suburbs.

==Route description==

I-264 begins west of Downtown Louisville at I-64 just east of the Sherman Minton Bridge, which links Southern Indiana with Kentucky as it crosses the Ohio River. The Interstate ends approximately northeast of Downtown Louisville, where it connects to I-71.

==History==
===1920s–1958: pre I-264 designation===
As early as the mid-1920s, there were proposals made for a road with a similar goal.

In 1941, a planning document described the need for a bypass around the southern end of Louisville. A funding shortage caused by world War II delayed the opening. In 1948 the expressway opened from the Dixie Highway to the Shelbyville Road on the southeast side of the city. The road was a two-lane expressway built to carry traffic between Shelbyville Road and US 31W (Dixie Highway) in Louisville as a relocation of US 60.

In 1952, the road was named the &quot;Watterson Expressway&quot; after local journalist and editor Henry Watterson.

By 1954, the entire roadway was either built or under construction. It was also determined that the road would be extended from Shelbyville road to Brownsboro Road.

===1958–present: since designation===
Interstate 264 was one of two routes approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) for the Kentucky statewide urban Interstate numerology on November 10, 1958. It was to be a partial beltway loop. Taking advantage of the Watterson Expressway already existing, plans were made to widen the 1948 segment to four lanes and expand the expressway itself from Shelbyville road to Brownsboro Road, as had already been planned. Work on the massive project was complete by 1965.

On July 11, 1968, the 1/2 mile Waterson Expressway extension eastwards to I-71 was completed. The other segments of the expressway were also resurfaced in a $1 million safety project, previously rain caused severe accidents.

In 1970, the first part of a western extension was opened at the Dixie Highway intersection. For the next four years, this expansion would be opened in segments. Work was completed in 1974 when the segment with I-64 northwest of Downtown Louisville was opened. At this point, both the Shawnee and Watterson Expressways were signed as I-264. The original section from Dixie Highway to I-71 still retained the &quot;Watterson Expressway&quot; moniker though this was still cosigned, along with the original US 60 designation, as I-264, while the western segment was originally named the &quot;Shawnee Expressway&quot;, even though signage referred to it simply as &quot;I-264&quot;, with no mention of the &quot;Shawnee Expressway&quot; name. The original Dixie Highway to I-71 segment signage reads as &quot;I-264 Watterson Expressway&quot;, while the western segment signage still only reads as &quot;I-264&quot;.

The US 60 concurrency was dropped in 1984 when the original surface roads through Louisville were returned to their original designations.
As early as the 1960s, there were suggestions to rebuild the Watterson Expressway, as its exits were to close together and the more minor ones were extremely congested. The Watterson Expressway underwent a major reconstruction effort that began in 1985. The freeway had outlived its useful purpose and had numerous characteristics that defined it as a blight on Louisville: deteriorating overpasses, buckling pavement, deficient and too closely spaced interchanges, and rampant congestion. Dozens of bridges were reconstructed and widened, and the majority of the interchanges were redesigned and rebuilt from the ground up from US 31W east to Shelbyville Road. Exit 13 exit was also eliminated, the Westbound side closing in 1986, and the eastbound side closed in 1987. The entire highway reconstruction project was completed in 1995. A typical deficient interchange along I-264 was the I-65, Kentucky Exposition Center, and Louisville International Airport exit. Before the reconstruction, two cloverleafs with no collector–distributor lanes existed and posed serious weaving issues. The interchange today has been rebuilt and features numerous flyovers and collector–distributor lanes, making it safer though not necessarily easier to navigate.

The Shawnee Expressway, from its opening in 1970, had received no more than emergency or spot patching and was in need of a rebuild. After several years of planning, in early 2003, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) began a reconstruction project on this segment of Interstate Highway stretching from the US 31W interchange northwest to just east of Bank Street. A concrete surface several inches thick was constructed on mainline roadway and access ramps, a new median barrier was formed, new lighting fixtures were installed, 37 bridges were rehabilitated, 380 new roadway signs were posted, and all guardrails were replaced as part of the project. In addition, the segment from River Park Drive to I-64, which was only two lanes, was widened to three lanes. No major ramp or interchange modifications were needed. The highway reconstruction project costed approximately $66 million (equivalent to $ in ) and required 18 months of labor. About 70,000 vehicles a day use the portion of I-264 near US 31W and about 40,000 daily use the segment near its western terminus with I-64.

On April 1, 2010, the Kentucky General Assembly designated the western portion to be renamed as the Georgia Davis Powers Expressway. At this point, small signs at both the western I-64 terminus and the Dixie interchange were installed.

Although the Kentucky General Assembly considered plans for an interchange with Kentucky Route 1447 (KY 1447, Westport Road) as early as 1992, work did not begin until October 2008 and was completed in May 2010. Additionally, the overpass carrying traffic over the roadway was replaced with a wider three-lane one that also had shoulders; the roadway nearby was also reconstructed.

In 2011, plans were made to improve the US 42 interchange. In its previous configuration, the exit was a congested boatneck that frequently saw accidents. The project was completed in 2014.

==Future==
There are currently plans to rebuild the I-65 interchange.

<doc id="1001781" wikidata="Q1068095" url="?curid=1001781" title="Chasseurs Alpins">
<text>The chasseurs alpins () are the elite mountain infantry force of the French Army. They are trained to operate in mountainous terrain and in urban warfare.

==History==
France created a mountain corps in the late 19th century to oppose any Italian invasion through the Alps. In 1859–70 the Unification of Italy, forming a powerful state took place. The French army saw this geopolitical change as a potential threat to their Alpine border, especially as the Italian army was already creating troops specialized in mountain warfare (). On December 24, 1888, the first &quot;troupes de montagne&quot; (mountain troops) corps were created from 12 of the 31 existing &quot;Chasseurs à pied&quot; Hunters on Foot/Foot Rifles) battalions.

Initially these units were named &quot;bataillons alpins de chasseurs à pied&quot; (Alpine Battalions of Hunters on Foot/Alpine Foot Rifle Battalions). Later this was shortened to &quot;bataillons de chasseurs alpins&quot; (Alpine Hunter Battalions/Alpine Rifle Battalions). From their establishment the &quot;chasseurs Alpins&quot; wore a plain and practical uniform designed to be suitable for mountain service. This comprised a loose-fitting dark blue jacket and blue-grey breeches, together with a large beret carrying the yellow (daffodil) hunting horn insignia of the Chasseur branch. They are believed to have been the first regular military unit to have worn this form of headdress. The 47e BCA was reformed at Bourg-Saint-Maurice in 1979, and dissolved on 1 July 1985.

==Modern unit==

Since 1999 they have been (with other units) part of the 27th Mountain Infantry Brigade (&quot;Brigade d&#x27;Infanterie de Montagne&quot;), and are currently organised into three battalions:
* 7th Battalion, Varces (Grenoble)
* 13th Battalion, Chambéry
* 27th Battalion, Cran-Gevrier (Annecy)

All three battalions are based in cities in the French Alps, thus the name of the units.

Training includes climbing, Ski mountaineering, plus winter and summer mountain leadership and mountain guiding skills completed at the High Mountain Military School. Traditional training included mountain survival skills such as to build an igloo shelter and to sleep in temperatures around 0 °C. Modern troops may be transported in all-terrain VMBs, VACs, (Bandvagn 206) or untracked VAB personnel carriers. Personal weaponry includes the FAMAS assault rifle, Minimi machine gun, FRF-2 sniper rifle, PGM Hécate II heavy sniper rifle, and LGI light mortar, while group weapons included the M2 machine gun, LLR 81mm mortar, and vehicle-mounted 20 mm autocannon, plus AT4, Eryx and MILAN anti-tank missiles.

The &quot;chasseurs&quot; are easily recognised by their wide beret (when not in battle uniform), named the &quot;tarte des Alpes&quot; (after a type traditional alpine tart). Note though that this is also worn by other mountain troops, such as the Alpine infantry, cavalry, artillery, and signals except for the 2ème REG engineers who wear the green beret.

The 16th battalion of chasseurs are not mountain troops and wear the standard French Army blue beret with the chasseur cap badge.
Current winter uniform consists of &#x27;Tundra&#x27; camouflage made in 50/50 ripstop. It was specifically created for the Chasseurs &amp; has later been adopted by other French units such as the GCM for winter exercises.

==Various traditions==
Chasseurs do not say &quot;rouge&quot; (red) but &quot;bleu-cerise&quot; (cherry blue - The color of blood on their blue uniforms), except when speaking of the color of the lips of a beloved, the red in the Legion of Honour&#x27;s insignia (including its fourragère which is called &quot;la rouge&quot;), and the red of the French flag. This stems from the days when Napoleon III tried to impose the wearing of the scarlet pantalons garance. The mountain troops objected, and no longer use the word &#x27;red&#x27; as a result.

The chasseurs have a few other typicalities in what they say:
* not &quot;jaune&quot; (yellow), but &quot;jonquille&quot; (daffodil);
* not &quot;uniforme&quot; (uniform), but &quot;tenue&quot; (outfit, or dress), like in the Royale;
* not &quot;la musique&quot; (the music), but &quot;la fanfare&quot; (the band);
* the band does not &quot;joue&quot; (play), but &quot;sonne&quot; (the band sounds);
* not &quot; tambour&quot; (drum), but &quot;caisse claire&quot; (snare drum);
* and not &quot;caserne&quot; (barracks), but &quot;quartier&quot; (neighborhood, barracks, or quarters).

The chasseurs are said to have green blood, after the pun:&quot; &quot;Le sang vert, c&#x27;est pour la France; Le sang versé pour la France&quot;&quot; (&quot;Green blood is for France&#x27;; Blood shed, &#x27;poured out&#x27;, for France&quot;).

Note that these traditions are also shared by the 16th battalion of chasseurs, who are not chasseurs alpins.

When marching with the band and horns, the marching pace is 140 steps a minute - faster than most other armed forces units, with the exception of the Italian Bersaglieri, whose pace is 180 steps per minute.

The chasseurs alpins are informally known as &quot;Les diables bleus&quot; (Eng: The Blue Devils). Monuments and memorials to the unit, such as Memorial to the Chasseur Alpins are marked &quot;Aux Diables Bleus&quot; (Eng: To the Blue Devils).

==Choruses and Ringin==

A chasseur salutes when he hears the chorus of his battalion, or &quot;Les Allobroges&quot; (the anthem of Savoie). Each battalion has a different chorus, and a chasseur must learn all of them:
* 1 bataillon « Si l&#x27;septième de ligne a des couilles au cul, C&#x27;est qu&#x27;le Premier Chasseurs les lui a foutues ! »
* 2 bataillon « Le Commandant a mal aux dents, mes enfants ! » (bis)
* 3 bataillon « V&#x27;la l&#x27;troisième, v&#x27;la l&#x27;troisième, qui rapplique au galop, V&#x27;la l&#x27;troisième, v&#x27;la l&#x27;troisième, qui rapplique sac au dos ! »
* 4 bataillon « Quatrième bataillon, Commandant Clinchant, Toujours en avant ! »
* 5 bataillon « Cinquième Bataillon ventre à terre, Commandé par Certain Canrobert, en avant ! »

* 9 bataillon « Marie, j&#x27;ai vu ton cul tout nu, Cochon, pourquoi le regardes-tu ? »
* 10 bataillon « Dixième Bataillon, Commandant Mac-Mahon, N&#x27;a pas peur du canon nom de nom »
* 11 bataillon « Onzième Bataillon de Chasseurs Alpins, Onzième Bataillon d&#x27;lapins »
* 12 bataillon « Ah c&#x27;qu&#x27;il est con, c&#x27;qu&#x27;il est con l&#x27;Douzième, Ah c&#x27;qu&#x27;il est con, c&#x27;qu&#x27;il est con c&#x27;con là ! »
* 13 bataillon « Sans pain, sans fricot, au treizième on n&#x27;boit que d&#x27;l&#x27;eau ! »
* 14 bataillon « La peau de mes roulettes pour une casquette, La peau de mes rouleaux pour un shako ! »
* 15 bataillon « Je fumerais bien une pipe, Mais je n&#x27;ai pas de tabac ! »

* 17 bataillon « Cré nom d&#x27;un chien, nous voilà bien partis, Cré nom d&#x27;un chien, nous voilà bien ! »
* 18 bataillon « Encore un biffin d&#x27;enfilé, rompez, Encore un biffin d&#x27;enfilé ! »
* 19 bataillon « Trou du cul, trou du cul plein de poils sales, Trou du cul, trou du cul poilu ! »
* 20 bataillon « Vingtième Bataillon, Commandant Cambriels, Les Chasseurs à pied ont des ailes ! »
* 21 bataillon « En voulez-vous des kilomètres ? En voilà ! »
* 22 bataillon « Encore un biffin de tombé dans la merde, Encore un biffin d&#x27;emmerdé ! »
* 23 bataillon « V&#x27;la le vingt-troisième, nom de Dieu, ça va barder ! »
* 24 bataillon « Tout le long du bois, j&#x27;ai baisé Jeannette, Tout le long du bois, j&#x27;l&#x27;ai baisé trois fois ! »
* 25 bataillon « Pas plus con qu&#x27;un autre nom de nom, Mais toujours autant ! » (ou content)
* 26 bataillon « Tu m&#x27;emmerdes et tu m&#x27;fais chier, tu m&#x27;dis ça c&#x27;est pour blaguer ! »
* 27 bataillon « Si vous avez des couilles, il faudra le montrer ! »
* 28 bataillon « Saut&#x27;Putten ; t&#x27;auras d&#x27;la saucisse, Saut&#x27;Putten, t&#x27;auras du boudin ! »

* 31 bataillon « Trente-et-unième, l&#x27;dernier v&#x27;nu, Pas l&#x27;plus mal foutu ! »
* 32 bataillon « Si j&#x27;avais du pinard, j&#x27;en boirais bien une goutte, si j&#x27;avais du pinard j&#x27;en boirai bien un quart ! »
* 40 bataillon « Trou du cul de la reine des Hovas »

==Colours==

<text>United Biscuits (UB) is a British multinational food manufacturer, makers of McVitie&#x27;s biscuits, Jacob&#x27;s Cream Crackers, and Twiglets. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. In November 2014, the company was acquired by Yıldız Holding and is now part of Pladis.

United Biscuits manufactures in a number of countries across Europe, such as the Netherlands, France and Belgium. It also has a manufacturing site in India. The company&#x27;s headquarters is in Chiswick Business Park in west London.

==History==
United Biscuits (UB) was formed in 1948 by a merger of two Scottish family businesses: McVitie &amp; Price and MacFarlane Lang. In 1962, United Biscuits acquired William Crawford &amp; Sons, a Scottish baker founded in Leith in 1813, for £6 million. In 1965, the company also acquired William MacDonald &amp; Sons for £2.8 million, and brought the Penguin brand to the group.

The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange as United Biscuits plc on 27 July 1948.

In 1972, United Biscuits acquired &quot;Carr&#x27;s of Carlisle&quot;, makers of Table Water biscuits, from James Goldsmith&#x27;s Cavenham Foods for £2.75 million. Two years later, in 1974, it acquired the US-based Keebler Company for $53 million. It also owned the Wimpy Bar fast food restaurant chain between 1977 and 1989, before selling it off to Burger King.

United Biscuits acquired the frozen food company Ross Young&#x27;s from Hanson in 1988 for £335 million.

It sold Keebler for $500 million in 1995 after giving up efforts to break into the American market. In 1998 PepsiCo purchased Smith&#x27;s Snackfood Company from United Biscuits.

United Biscuits was de-listed from the London Stock Exchange and acquired in May 2000 by Finalrealm, a consortium of financial investors, as well as Nabisco Holdings Corporation. As part of the transaction, UB acquired Nabisco&#x27;s European businesses and divested several parts of its international business in Scandinavia, continental Europe, Asia (Keebler Malaysia and Singapore), several brands including TUC and 70% shareholding in Fazer Keksit (Biscuit) in Finland to Groupe Danone and Far East (China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) to Nabisco. The company sold Young&#x27;s Bluecrest in 2001, in order to concentrate on the sweet biscuit sector. In September 2004, United Biscuits bought the UK portion of Groupe Danone&#x27;s Jacob&#x27;s Biscuit Group for £240 million, including Cream Crackers and Twiglets. In July 2006, the company sold its Southern European biscuits business to Kraft Foods, which in turn left the owner syndicate.

In October 2006, MidOcean Partners sold the company to a consortium made up of the Blackstone Group and PAI Partners. The deal was completed in December 2006.

In December 2012, UB agreed the sale of its KP Snacks business to Intersnack for £500 million. On 3 November 2014, private equity funds managed by Blackstone and PAI Partners announced the sale of United Biscuits to Yıldız Holding.

==Operations==
The core of the business is in the United Kingdom, where it produces biscuits under a number of brand names, including: McVitie&#x27;s biscuits and Jacob&#x27;s Cream Crackers.

<text>RAF Wainfleet was a Royal Air Force weapons range on The Wash on the east coast of England near Wainfleet, in the civil parish of Friskney, although the north-east part of the range was in Wainfleet St Mary. Other ranges nearby include RAF Holbeach, also on The Wash, and RAF Donna Nook. It was also known as The Wash (North side) Bombing Range. It was only a few miles south-west of Gibraltar Point.

==History==
The range opened to aerial operations in August 1938; but had previously been used as a range from 1890 by the 1st Lincolnshire Artillery. However, there is evidence that the area was in use for military practice as far back as Napoleonic times when the River Steeping was navigable and Wainfleet itself was an important harbour.

During the 1920s and 1930s it was also used by the RAF and Royal Artillery. The range was administered by RAF Coningsby as an Air Weapons Range within RAF Strike Command. During the Second World War, it was used by 617 Squadron to test the Stabilised Automatic Bomb Sight. Postwar, it was used by both fixed wing and rotary aircraft from NATO. On 1 April 2006 control was transferred to Defence Estates and the range was then administered by Defence Training Estates (East) from their headquarters at West Tofts Camp near Thetford.

Due to funding cuts the range was closed for operations on 2 December 2009 and finally closed in July 2010.

The tower and some surrounding buildings reopened as holiday accommodation in 2017.

===1981 air crash===
A USAF Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft crashed on Friday 8 May 1981 at 2.45 pm near Friskney. 25 year old First Lt Henry Louis Gagne, born on 14 February 1956, died in RAF Nocton Hall several hours later, of Gulfport, Mississippi. He was an engineering graduate of Mississippi State University.
===1983 air crash===
An RAF Hawker Siddeley Harrier &quot;XV742&quot; crashed on Friday 28 October 1983. 24 year old Flying Officer John Sewell from St Anthony&#x27;s Road in Blundellsands was killed. The aircraft flew from RAF Wittering.

===1990 air crash===
On Monday 5 February 1990 at 5.30 pm, a USAF General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark aircraft crashed. One pilot was found at 7 pm by a boat from Boston. The Skegness lifeboat was looking for the other pilot. The pilot was found three days later strapped in the seat.

==Operation==
The site was controlled from the Control Tower. Targets included old ships. There were two smaller wooden observation towers to the east nearer the shore but these were demolished in 2009. Access was via a narrow road called &quot;Sea Lane&quot; via the junction with the A52 at the &quot;Barley Mow&quot; at Friskney Eaudyke.

===Weapons clearance===
The site was cleared daily by the Explosive Ordnance Disposal team from RAF Coningsby. Although the range has finally closed unrecovered ordnance and unexploded ordnance will remain for many years.

===SSSI===
The range area is a Site of Special Scientific Interest thanks to the large number of resident and migrating birds found there. The location is a major stopping point for flocks of brent geese on their way from the Arctic coast. There is also the red-legged partridge. Skegness gets its weather recorded from the automatic equipment at Wainfleet.

<doc id="1001789" wikidata="Q610550" url="?curid=1001789" title="Ivica Mornar">
<text>Ivica Mornar (born 12 January 1974) is a Croatian retired footballer. He started as a striker, but was mostly deployed as a winger during his career.

Mornar began his career with Hajduk Split before going on to play for Eintracht Frankfurt, Sevilla, CD Ourense, Standard Liège, Anderlecht and Portsmouth.

==Club career==
Mornar was born in Split.

In Mornar&#x27;s final season at Anderlecht, he scored a goal in a 1–1 home draw against Bayern Munich on 30 September 2003.

He was offered a new two-year contract by Anderlecht, but opted to move across the English channel to Portsmouth. He moved to the Premier League at the end of January 2004 for £500,000, signing a two-and-a-half-year deal.

Mornar made his Pompey debut in a goalless draw at home to Wolverhampton, and looked lively. He then scored his first and only goal in the next game against Tottenham. He played as a winger in most of his Portsmouth appearances.

However, Mornar failed to recreate his previous form at Portsmouth. Seemingly out of the picture at the club, he was loaned to Rennes of the French Ligue 1 for the 2004–05 season, with then Pompey manager Harry Redknapp saying that he would allow Mornar to be sold upon his return. Although it appeared that Mornar was in new boss Alain Perrin&#x27;s plans for the 2005–06 campaign, he was thwarted by hamstring injuries throughout the season. Upon the return of Harry Redknapp as manager in December 2005 it looked as though Mornar&#x27;s contract would be allowed to expire the next Summer. However, it transpired that there was a clause in his contract guaranteeing him a further year at the club should relegation be avoided and he remained a Portsmouth player, until September 2006 when his contract with the club was cancelled by mutual consent. This brought further complications due to the fact that Mornar could not find a club willing to sign him. Despite his unceremonious exit from Portsmouth he enjoyed his time playing there and persuaded fellow Split native Niko Kranjčar to join the club. Reportedly he offered his services to first league teams from Belgium, Scotland, Portugal and Japan but no team was interested, thereby forcing his retirement.

==International career==
Mornar made his debut for Croatia in a March 1994 friendly match away against Spain, coming on as a 46th-minute substitute for Janko Janković, but was replaced himself by Ante Miše after being on the pitch for just over half an hour. He was capped 22 times and scored one goal for his country against England. Mornar represented Croatia at Euro 2004. His final international was a September 2004 World Cup qualification match against Hungary.

<doc id="1001793" wikidata="Q6593662" url="?curid=1001793" title="2004 Vojvodina provincial election">
<text>First round of the [[Vojvodina]] provincial elections was held on September 19, 2004, at the same time when the local elections were held in the whole of Serbia (with the exception of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo).

Second round of elections was held on October 3, 2004.

== Rules ==
There are 120 MPs in Vojvodina&#x27;s Parliament. One half (60 MPs) is elected based on a proportional representation one-round system, according to which Vojvodina is one electoral unit. Voters choose between several Parties, Coalitions or Citizen Groups. The other 60 MPs are elected based on majority two-round system, according to which Vojvodina is divided into 60 electoral units in a way that every county gives at least one MP. Some larger electoral units, like the cities of Novi Sad, Subotica, Zrenjanin etc., give more (from 2 up to 7). In this case, voters choose between more candidates. A candidate can win in first round if he/she gets more than 50%+1 votes of those who voted. If none gets enough votes, the two strongest candidates go to the second round, in which the one with more votes wins.

The election threshold for Parties, Coalitions and Citizen&#x27;s Groups is 5%, except for Parties of minority groups (Hungarians, Croats, etc.), for whom the threshold is smaller, but not smaller than the number of votes necessary to get one MP. According to the law, on all lists of Parties, Coalitions and Citizen&#x27;s Groups at least 30% of the proposed MPs must be women.

<text>The American Booksellers Association (ABA) is a non-profit trade association founded in 1900 that promotes independent bookstores in the United States. ABA&#x27;s core members are key participants in their communities&#x27; local economy and culture, and to assist them ABA creates relevant programs; provides education, information, business products, and services; and engages in public policy and industry advocacy. The Association actively supports and defends free speech and the First Amendment rights of all Americans, without contradiction of equity and inclusion, through the American Booksellers for Free Expression. A volunteer board of 13 booksellers governs the Association. Previously headquartered in White Plains, New York, ABA became a fully remote organization in 2024.

== Winter Institute and Children&#x27;s Institute ==
The American Booksellers Association hosts two conferences each year, known as Institutes. Institutes typically last several days and consist of tours of several independent bookstores in the host city, education sessions, author signings, and networking opportunities.

Winter Institute lasts four days and is typically held in late January of early February. It is the larger of the two events, with more 1,000 people in attendance in 2024.

Children&#x27;s Institute is a three-day long event, typically held in the summer, with education and sessions geared towards booksellers who carry children&#x27;s books.

== Independent Bookstore Day ==
Independent Bookstore Day, celebrated the last Saturday in April, is a celebration of independent bookstores. The American Booksellers Association organizes this annual celebration, creates assets and resources for booksellers to use, and coordinates with publishers to create exclusive items booksellers can sell for this event. 

Independent Bookstore Day was introduced in 2015, following the success of a regional California Bookstore Day. Though it started as a collaboration of the regional associations, Independent Bookstore Day was eventually handed over to ABA to organize.

The ABA sponsored the Book Sense marketing program and associated BookSense.com web site, intended to preserve a connection between consumers and local independent bookstores. In June 2008, Book Sense was replaced by IndieBound, a new program and website.

==Association of Booksellers for Children==
In November, 2010, the Association of Booksellers for Children (ABC), a non-profit trade association supporting the business of independent children&#x27;s bookselling, agreed to merge with the American Booksellers Association. The former ABC is now a membership group within the ABA. 

==IndieBound==

&quot;IndieBound&quot; is a marketing movement for independent bookstores launched in 2008 by the American Booksellers Association. With resources designed to encourage readers to shop at independent bookstores, it promotes fiscal localism. 

IndieBound is home to the Indie Bookstore Finder, an interactive map that allows visitors to find independent bookstores across the country. IndieBound also hosts curated reading lists like the Indie Next List and Kids&#x27; Indie Next Lists as well as Indie Bestseller Lists. 

=== Launch ===
IndieBound was launched in June 2008 to replace a prior marketing program for independents called Book Sense. IndieBound does not sell books directly, instead it directs customers to nearby independent bookstores who sell online through their own e-commerce sites. 

=== Indie Bestseller Lists ===
The Indie Bestseller Lists show the top selling titles in independent bookstores nationwide.

Indie Bestseller Lists are published weekly for hardcover fiction, hardcover nonfiction, trade paperback fiction, trade paperback nonfiction, mass market paperback, &quot;children&#x27;s interest,&quot; children&#x27;s illustrated, and children&#x27;s fiction series. Category lists, which focus on a particular genre, are published less frequently. The Indie Bestseller Lists are released by IndieBound as XML feeds.

=== Indie Next Lists ===
The Indie Next List (published monthly) and the Kids&#x27; Indie Next List (published every other month) feature new releases nominated by booksellers across the country. 

The ABA collects these bookseller nominations and compiles the Indie Next Lists. 

=== Indies Choice Book Awards ===
Each year, owners and employees of ABA stores have the opportunity to vote for the Indies Choice Book Awards, which is issued in four categories. The winning authors are honored at a banquet at BookExpo America. BookExpo was &quot;retired&quot; in 2020, in part due to the pandemic. The Indie Choice Book Awards has not been held since.

<doc id="1001811" wikidata="Q522827" url="?curid=1001811" title="Sisowath Monivong">
<text>Sisowath Monivong (, ; 27 December 1875 – 24 April 1941) was the King of Cambodia from 9 August 1927 until his death in 1941. During his reign, Cambodia was a French protectorate. Monivong was the grandson of the poet-king Ang Duong, grandfather of Norodom Sihanouk and the great-grandfather of the current king, Norodom Sihamoni. His full regnal title and style was &quot;Preah Bat Samdech Preah Serey Monivarman Krom Luang Chao Chakrabangsa Sisowath Monivong Ney Preah Reacheanachak Kampuchea&quot; () which can be literally translated from Khmerized Sanskrit as &quot;His majesty, glorious lord scholar-protector; His highness, lord of land and sea, Sisowath Monivong of the Kingdom of Kampuchea&quot;. He is the most recent male monarch from the House of Sisowath, as all his successors are members of the House of Norodom.

==Life==
Born in Phnom Penh in 1875, Sisowath Monivong was the sixth child and the second son of King Sisowath. His mother was Neak Moneang Van, later titled &quot;Samdeach Preah Voreachini&quot;, the fifth child-bearing wife of Sisowath. At that time his uncle King Norodom ruled from Oudong, the capital of Cambodia. Norodom was a puppet king for the French colonial protectorate. In 1884, after the French conquered Laos and occupied Vietnam, Cambodia became a direct colonial possession. The royal family then moved from Oudong to the new capital of Phnom Penh, where Sisowath Monivong resided.

In 1904, both of his uncles and his elder brother Essaravong died, resulting in Sisowath Monivong becoming the Crown Prince of Cambodia. In 1906, he traveled with his father, King Sisowath, to France. There he was admitted to the Military School of Saint-Maixent. He graduated two years later with the rank sous lieutenant in the Foreign Legion. He was then posted to Brive and later to Paris. In 1909, he returned to Cambodia. In 1910, he was promoted to lieutenant, in 1916 to captain, and finally, in 1922, to chief of battalion. The same year he was released from military service. During the First World War, he actively recruited volunteer military personnel and workers. These services were recognized with the Cross of Commander of the Foreign Legion and the Cambodian title of &quot;Samdech Preah Keofea&quot;. He was then appointed secretary-general of the council of ministers and president of the council of the Royal Family.

Monivong had many consorts, at least six of whom were granted official recognition, having borne children to him. One of these was a woman named Meak, a member of the Royal Ballet, who was given the title &quot;Khun Preah Moneang Bopha Norleak Meak&quot;. Meak bore Monivong&#x27;s son, Prince Sisowath Kusarak, in 1926. Around 1934–1935, two of her young cousins came to live with her, a common Cambodian custom; one of her cousins, named Saloth Sâr, would later adopt the name Pol Pot.

Monivong died on 23 April 1941 at the age of 65 at Bokor Mountain which was renamed Preah Monivong National Park in his honour.

==Reign==
In 1927, Sisowath Monivong&#x27;s father died, so at age 52 Sisowath Monivong ascended to the throne. Like his father and his uncle, Monivong was simply a figurehead for the French administration and, in the words of one author, Monivong &quot;caused the French no trouble&quot;. The real power was in the hands of the French Resident-General. The King was surrounded by his Royal Council composed of his cousins: Sisowath Rathary (father of Sisowath Sirik Matak), Sisowath Watchayavong, Norodom Phanouvong, Norodom Suramarit and Norodom Singhara.

It was during Monivong&#x27;s rule that Cambodia became open to outside communist influences. In 1930, the Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh founded the Indochinese Communist Party which subsequently obtained popularity in Cambodia. The Cambodian communists&#x27; primary objective was to overthrow the French.

In 1940, when the French Third Republic fell to Nazi Germany, the &quot;Vichy France&quot; regime took power in the unoccupied parts of France and in its overseas colonies, including Cambodia. In the late 1930s, a powerless Monivong noticed that Imperial Japan was making inroads in Vietnam. Japan then invaded and occupied Cambodia in early 1941. The Japanese allowed Cambodian Vichy French officials to administer, but only under Japanese protection. The Cambodian king was beholden to the Vichy French, who were in turn beholden to the Japanese. In western Cambodia, Thailand, now an ally of the Japanese, occupied territory. As the Japanese and Thai oppression of Cambodians became evident, Sisowath Monivong retired to Kampot in late 1941 and died at Bokor the same year. He died taking the posthumous title of Preah Karuna Preah Sisowath Monivong Preah Khatiyakot ().

His son Sisowath Monireth was the heir to the throne, but the French authorities chose Sisowath Kossamak&#x27;s nineteen-year-old son Norodom Sihanouk to succeed him instead, mistakenly believing that he would be more pliable than Monireth. Two of his children, Sisowath Monireth and Sisowath Monipong, would go on to serve as prime minister.
