<text>Wise Blood is the first novel by American author Flannery O&#x27;Connor, published in 1952. The novel was assembled from disparate stories first published in &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;The Sewanee Review&quot; and &quot;Partisan Review&quot;. The first chapter is an expanded version of a story from her Master&#x27;s thesis, &quot;The Train&quot;, and other chapters are reworked versions of &quot;The Peeler,&quot; &quot;The Heart of the Park&quot; and &quot;Enoch and the Gorilla&quot;. The novel concerns a returning World War II veteran who, haunted by a life-long crisis of faith, resolves to form an anti-religious ministry in an eccentric, fictionalized city in the Southern United States after finding his family homestead abandoned without a trace.

The novel received little critical attention when it first appeared but has since come to be appreciated as a classic work of &quot;low comedy and high seriousness&quot; with disturbing religious themes. It was placed 62nd in &quot;The Observer&#x27;s&quot; list of 100 greatest novels.

==Plot summary==
Recently discharged from service in World War II and surviving on a government pension for unspecified battle wounds, Hazel Motes returns to his family home in Tennessee to find it abandoned. Leaving behind a note claiming a chifforobe as his private property, Motes boards a train for Taulkinham. The grandson of a traveling preacher, Motes grew up struggling with doubts regarding salvation and original sin; following his experiences at war, Motes has become an avowed atheist and intends to spread a gospel of antireligion. Despite his aversion to all trappings of Christianity, he constantly contemplates theological issues and finds himself compelled to purchase a hat and suit that cause others to mistake him for a minister.

In Taulkinham, Motes finds an address in a bathroom stall and seeks out Leora Watts, a prostitute. He enters her house, sits on her bed, and places his hand on her shoe without speaking to her first. He befriends Enoch Emery, a manic, 18-year-old zookeeper forced to come to the city after his abusive father kicked him out of their house. Emery introduces Motes to the concept of &quot;wise blood,&quot; an idea that he has innate, worldly knowledge of what direction to take in life, and requires no spiritual or emotional guidance.

Emery and Motes witness a blind preacher Asa Hawks and his 15-year-old daughter Sabbath Lily crash a street vendor&#x27;s potato peeler demonstration to advertise for their ministry. Motes finds himself drawn to the pair, which Hawks attributes to a repressed desire for religious salvation. Angry, Motes begins shouting blasphemies to the crowd, declaring that he will found his own anti-God street preaching ministry. Motes&#x27; declarations are lost on everyone except for Emery, who becomes infatuated with the idea.

After Leora destroys his hat for her own amusement, Motes moves into the boarding house where Asa and Sabbath Lily live. Motes becomes fixated on Sabbath Lily and begins spending time with her. Asa has Sabbath Lily give Motes an old newspaper clipping announcing his intention to blind himself with quicklime at a revival meeting to detach himself from worldly pursuits. Initially intending to seduce Sabbath Lily in order to corrupt her spiritual purity, Motes discovers that she is in fact interested in him.

Now skeptical of her and of her father&#x27;s entire ministry, Motes slips into Hawks&#x27; room one night and finds him without his sunglasses on, with perfectly intact eyes: Hawks faltered when he had attempted to blind himself because his faith was not strong enough, and ultimately left the ministry to become a con artist. His secret found out, Asa flees town, leaving Sabbath Lily to fend for herself. She moves in with Motes, and he begins to more aggressively pursue his ministry, purchasing a dilapidated car to use as a mobile pulpit.

Meanwhile, Emery, believing that Motes&#x27; church needs a worldly &quot;prophet,&quot; breaks into a museum and steals a mummified dwarf, which he begins keeping under his sink. He ultimately presents it to Sabbath Lily to give to Motes on his behalf; when she appears to Motes cradling it in her arms in a parody of the Madonna and Child, Motes experiences a violent revulsion to the image and destroys the mummy, throwing its remnants out the window.

Inspired by Motes&#x27; fledgling street ministry, local con artist Hoover Shoats renames himself Onnie Jay Holy and forms his own ministry, the &quot;Holy Church of Christ Without Christ,&quot; which he encourages the disenfranchised to join for a donation of $1. The absurdity amuses passersby and they begin to join as a joke. This angers Motes, who wants to legitimately spread his message of antireligion. Despite Motes&#x27; protests, Holy moves to the next level in promoting his ministry, hiring a homeless, alcoholic man to dress up like Motes and act as his &quot;Prophet.&quot;

During a rainstorm, Emery seeks refuge under a theater marquee, and learns that a gorilla will be brought there to promote a new jungle movie. An excited Emery stands in line to shake the animal&#x27;s hand, but is startled to find that the gorilla is actually a man in a costume who, unprovoked, tells Emery to &quot;go to hell.&quot; The incident causes Emery&#x27;s &quot;wise blood&quot; to give him some inarticulated revelation, and he seeks out a program of the &quot;gorilla&#x27;s&quot; future appearances. That night, Emery stalks the man to another theater, stabs him with a sharpened umbrella handle, and steals his costume. Enoch takes the costume out to the woods, strips naked and buries his clothes in a shallow &quot;grave&quot; before dressing up as the gorilla. Satisfied with his new appearance, he comes out of the woods and attempts to greet a couple on a date by shaking their hand. Emery is disappointed when they flee in terror, and finds himself alone on a rock overlooking Taulkinham.

Back in town, Motes angrily watches as Holy begins to grow rich from his new ministry. One night he follows Holy&#x27;s &quot;prophet&quot;, who drives a car resembling Motes&#x27;s. He runs the car off the road. When the man exits the car, the stronger, more forceful Motes threatens him and orders him to strip. The man begins to comply, but Motes is overcome by a sudden rage and repeatedly runs the man over. Exiting the car to ensure he is dead, Motes is startled when the dying man begins confessing his sins to Motes.

The next day, Motes is pulled over by a policeman who claims to be citing him for driving without a license. He orders Motes to drive to a nearby cliff, orders him to get out and then, remarking that someone without a license does not need a car, pushes it off the cliff. The incident, coupled with the prophet&#x27;s death, causes Motes to become sullen and withdrawn. Motes purchases a tin bucket and sack of quicklime and returns to the boarding house. Completing the action that Hawks could not finish, Motes blinds himself.

During an extended period of living as an ascetic at the boarding house, he begins walking around with barbed wire wrapped around his torso and sharp rocks and pebbles in his shoes. After paying for his room and board, he throws away any remaining money from his military pension. Believing that Motes has gone insane, the landlady, Mrs. Flood, hatches a plot to marry him, collect on his pension, and have him committed to an insane asylum. In attempting to seduce Motes, Mrs. Flood instead falls in love with him. After she suggests to Motes that they marry and she care for him, he wanders off into a thunderstorm.

Motes is found three days later, lying in a ditch and suffering from exposure. Angry at being asked to return what they believe is a mentally ill indigent, one of the cops who find Motes strikes him in the head with his baton. Motes dies in the police car en route to the boarding house. When the body is presented to Mrs. Flood, she mistakenly thinks he is still alive. She has Motes placed in bed and cares for his corpse, telling him he can live with her for as long as he likes, free of charge.

==Literary context==
&quot;Wise Blood&quot; began with four separate stories published in &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;Sewanee Review&quot;, and &quot;Partisan Review&quot; in 1948 and 1949.

Originally committed to Rinehart &amp; Company, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s agent and Robert Giroux convinced Rinehart to release the novel, and it was published as a complete novel by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Company in 1952. Signet advertised it as &quot;A Searching Novel of Sin and Redemption.&quot;

==Themes==
In the introduction to the 10th anniversary publication of &quot;Wise Blood&quot;, O&#x27;Connor states that the book is about freedom, free will, life and death, and the inevitability of contention regarding belief and disbelief. Themes of redemption, racism, sexism, and isolation also run through the novel.

==Adaptations==
A film was made of &quot;Wise Blood&quot; in 1979, directed by John Huston, and starring Brad Dourif as Hazel Motes and John Huston himself as the evangelist grandfather. Sabbath Lily was played by Amy Wright. Shot mostly in Macon, Georgia, it is a fairly literal filming of the novel.

An immersive opera and gallery installation, WISE BLOOD , libretto adapted from the novel by Anthony Gatto, was commissioned by Walker Art Center and (Minneapolis, Minnesota USA) in May and June 2015. From the Soap Factory website: &quot;Visual artist Chris Larson and composer Anthony Gatto join forces to bring the darkly humorous world of Flannery O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s WISE BLOOD to life. Set in the post-industrial beauty of a 130-year-old factory space turned art gallery, this immersive opera takes the audience on a journey alongside the eccentric and always captivating characters of this story. The audience is brought directly into, around and through large scale installation pieces, kinetic sculptures and projections. WISE BLOOD features an incredibly diverse cast of performers. The musicians of the Adam Meckler orchestra, Youngblood Brass Band, provide the musical core to this Southern Gothic Tale.&quot;

== Popular culture ==
The professional name of singer-songwriter Natalie Laura Mering, Weyes Blood, was inspired by the novel.

Melbourne musician Keith Glass used the pseudonym Onie J. Holy, a con artist/preacher in &quot;Wise Blood&quot;. An album &quot;God, Guns and Guts&quot; was released in 1987.

Heavy metal band Corrosion of Conformity released an album entitled &quot;Wiseblood&quot; in 1996.

PJ Harvey cited the novel as a huge inspiration for her writing on her 1995 album &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;.

Red Label Catharsis named its second album and title track, &quot;Jesus Made it Beautiful To Haunt Her&quot; directly from one specific page in Wiseblood where Sabbath Lily tells Hazel a story about a mother who strangles her baby.

<doc id="990797" wikidata="Q1375934" url="?curid=990797" title="Matusadona National Park">
<text>Matusadona National Park is a national park in northern Zimbabwe situated on the southern shore of Lake Kariba. The park takes its name from the local Matuzviadonha Hills.

==History==
Matusadona was proclaimed a non-hunting area on 7 November 1958 before being declared as a Game Reserve in 1963, and then in 1975 it became a National Park, under the Parks &amp; Wildlife Act of Rhodesia. Matusadona National Park covers of flat plains and rugged mountains protecting a diverse flora and fauna. Its area encompasses a combination of pristine and rugged wilderness, which was very inaccessible before the Kariba Dam was built and Lake Kariba created. The creation of the lake caused profound ecological changes. In particular, the availability of grazing on the lakeshore has contributed to an increase in the populations of large mammals in the park, especially elephant and Cape buffalo. The species of grass growing on the shoreline is &quot;Panicum repens&quot; which grows as long as the lake levels fluctuate bringing nutrients to the shore. This source of grazing has allowed populations of large grazers such as Cape buffalo, waterbuck, common zebra, and impala to thrive, attracting the associated predators. Matusadona National Park is an Intensive Protection Zone (IPZ) and home to several relocated rhinoceros.

==Ecology and management==
Matusadona National Park includes three distinct ecological areas. The first is Lake Kariba and its shoreline grasslands, the second is the floor of the Zambezi Valley, with its thick jesse, &quot;Combretum celastroides&quot;, thickets and mopane woodland, and; third, the Escarpment area of &quot;Julbernardia&quot; and &quot;Brachystegia&quot; woodlands. The woodlands do not have much grass but provide habitat for browsers, most notably the black rhinoceros. Elephants can be found throughout the park, seeking shade under the canopy of jesse during the heat of the day.

From the floor of the Zambezi valley the escarpment rises some and is extremely rugged. Elephant browsing and fire depredations have, in recent years, caused the once substantial woodlands to decrease allowing grassland to develop. This led to the park managers deciding that it was necessary to take control measures to reduce the elephant population and to carry out early burning programmes in the upper escarpment, to reduce the risk of later, hotter fires from causing serious damage to the trees. These programmes have been effective as demonstrated by regrowth apparent in the Escarpment area.

Within a area there was +100 lions feeding on a bounty of Cape buffalo. The buffalo began to disappear after losing vital grazing areas to a rise in the level of Lake Kariba upon which the park is set on. This in turn saw the lions begin to decline. By 2004 a study estimated a mere 28 lions remained in the area but no research was available on their viability and/or any other threats the population may be facing. The population is still remaining at a low density and is therefore susceptible to a variety of environmental and human induced pressures. Other mammals found include leopard, warthog, greater kudu and bushbuck.

===African Parks===
In November 2019 management of Matusadona National Park was assumed by African Parks, in partnership with Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, because of the deteriorated condition of the park due to rampant poaching.

==Facilities==
The following campsites are within the Matusadona National Park: Tashinga Camp, Sanyati Camp and Changachirere Camp, as well as undeveloped bush camps at Jenje and Kanjedza for up to a maximum of 10 persons per camp. There are also what are termed exclusive campsites at Ume, Muuyu, Mbalabala, Maronga, and Kautsiga.

==Access==
There is a small, landing strip available at Tashinga Camp which can take small aircraft. Many visitors access the park by boat either from Bumi Hills or Kariba town. It has relatively poor accessibility by road and an extremely harsh internal network of roads keep the crowds and traffic low. The roads are closed in the rainy season.

<doc id="990805" wikidata="Q157709" url="?curid=990805" title="The World of Suzie Wong">
<text>The World of Suzie Wong is a 1957 novel by British writer Richard Mason. The main characters are Robert Lomax, a young British artist living in Hong Kong, and Suzie Wong, the title character, a Chinese woman who works as a prostitute. The novel has been adapted into a play and spawned two unofficial sequels, a film, and a ballet.

==Plot==
Robert Lomax is a young Briton who, after completing his National Service, goes to work on a plantation in British Malaya. During his time in Malaya, Lomax decides to pursue a new career as an artist for a year.

Lomax visits Hong Kong in search of inspiration for his paintings. He checks into the Nam Kok Hotel, not realising at first that it is a brothel catering mainly to British and American sailors. However, this only makes the hotel more charming in Lomax&#x27;s eyes, and a better source of subject matter for his paintings.

Lomax quickly befriends most of the hotel&#x27;s bargirls, but is fascinated by the archetypal &quot;hooker with a heart of gold&quot;, Suzie Wong. Wong previously introduced herself to him as Wong Mee-ling, a rich virgin whose father owns four houses and more cars than she can count, and who later pretends not to recognise him at the hotel. Lomax had originally decided that he would not have sex with any of the bargirls at the hotel because he lacks the funds to pay for their services. However, it soon emerges that Suzie Wong is interested in him not as a customer but as a serious love interest. Although Wong becomes the kept woman of two other men, and Robert Lomax briefly becomes attracted to a young British nurse, Lomax and Wong are eventually united and the novel ends happily with them marrying.

== Development ==
Mason received inspiration to create the novel when he stayed at the Luk Kwok Hotel in 1956 and observed the prostitution services offered there.

== Film, TV and theatrical adaptations ==
The novel was adapted into a stage play in 1958 by Paul Osborn, directed by Joshua Logan, produced by David Merrick, and starred William Shatner and France Nuyen. Tsai Chin played the title role in the West End 1959 production.

The story was later adapted into the 1960 film largely based on the earlier play, directed by Richard Quine and starring William Holden, Nancy Kwan, Sylvia Syms, and Michael Wilding. Ray Stark was the Executive Producer. Originally France Nuyen was to repeat the role, but she fell ill and had to be replaced by Nancy Kwan.

In March 2006, the Hong Kong Ballet premiered a dance adaptation by Stephen Jefferies, entitled &quot;Suzie Wong&quot;.

In 2010, scenes from Stephen Jefferies&#x27; ballet were used by director Brian Jamieson in the film biography To Whom It May Concern: Ka Shen&#x27;s Journey, to draw parallels between the screen character of Suzie Wong and the life of actress Nancy Kwan.

== Sequels ==
In 2008, Sebastian Gerard wrote an unauthorised sequel to the novel, &quot;For Goodness Sake: the Afterlife of Suzie Wong&quot;. The book is set in 1998 Hong Kong, 47 years after the events in Mason&#x27;s book. Gerard&#x27;s novel explores the experience of Dr. Marco Podesta, a Vietnam War veteran who is in Hong Kong for research. The book is Gerard&#x27;s interpretation of what might have happened after the ending of the film, which was slightly more ambiguous than the ending in Mason&#x27;s novel. Gerard&#x27;s novel speculates that there might have been a real Robert and Suzie who were the inspiration for the story, and that only through them could we know if such an improbable romance might have endured.

There is also an unofficial modern interpretation of the &quot;World of Suzie Wong&quot; by Leon Pang, written in 2010, titled &quot;Suzie&quot;. One of the characters in the book takes the name of Suzie Wong in an attempt to latch on to the fame of the original character. The novel explores 60 years of changes in Hong Kong, and themes include poverty, the rise of China, employment instability in the world in 2008, outsourcing, and the failings of capitalism.

== Locations ==

The Nam Kok Hotel featured in the story is based on the on Gloucester Road in Wan Chai, where Mason stayed, although the building is now more modern, the site having been redeveloped in the 1980s. Also, unlike the hotel in the book, the modern hotel is not a brothel, but is one of many small smart hotels on Hong Kong Island.

==Reception==
The novel received good reviews during its release.

<text>In statistics, a moving average (rolling average or running average or moving mean or rolling mean) is a calculation to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different selections of the full data set. Variations include: simple, cumulative, or weighted forms.

Mathematically, a moving average is a type of convolution. Thus in signal processing it is viewed as a low-pass finite impulse response filter. Because the boxcar function outlines its filter coefficients, it is called a boxcar filter. It is sometimes followed by downsampling.

Given a series of numbers and a fixed subset size, the first element of the moving average is obtained by taking the average of the initial fixed subset of the number series. Then the subset is modified by &quot;shifting forward&quot;; that is, excluding the first number of the series and including the next value in the subset.

A moving average is commonly used with time series data to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles - in this case the calculation is sometimes called a time average. The threshold between short-term and long-term depends on the application, and the parameters of the moving average will be set accordingly. It is also used in economics to examine gross domestic product, employment or other macroeconomic time series. When used with non-time series data, a moving average filters higher frequency components without any specific connection to time, although typically some kind of ordering is implied. Viewed simplistically it can be regarded as smoothing the data.

==Simple moving average==

In financial applications a simple moving average (SMA) is the unweighted mean of the previous formula_1 data-points. However, in science and engineering, the mean is normally taken from an equal number of data on either side of a central value. This ensures that variations in the mean are aligned with the variations in the data rather than being shifted in time. An example of a simple equally weighted running mean is the mean over the last formula_1 entries of a data-set containing formula_3 entries. Let those data-points be formula_4. This could be closing prices of a stock. The mean over the last formula_1 data-points (days in this example) is denoted as formula_6 and calculated as:
formula_7

When calculating the next mean formula_8 with the same sampling width formula_1 the range from formula_10 to formula_11 is considered. A new value formula_12 comes into the sum and the oldest value formula_13 drops out. This simplifies the calculations by reusing the previous mean formula_14.
formula_15
This means that the moving average filter can be computed quite cheaply on real time data with a FIFO / circular buffer and only 3 arithmetic steps.

During the initial filling of the FIFO / circular buffer the sampling window is equal to the data-set size thus formula_16 and the average calculation is performed as a cumulative moving average.

The period selected (formula_1) depends on the type of movement of interest, such as short, intermediate, or long-term. 

If the data used are not centered around the mean, a simple moving average lags behind the latest datum by half the sample width. An SMA can also be disproportionately influenced by old data dropping out or new data coming in. One characteristic of the SMA is that if the data has a periodic fluctuation, then applying an SMA of that period will eliminate that variation (the average always containing one complete cycle). But a perfectly regular cycle is rarely encountered.

For a number of applications, it is advantageous to avoid the shifting induced by using only &quot;past&quot; data. Hence a central moving average can be computed, using data equally spaced on either side of the point in the series where the mean is calculated. This requires using an odd number of points in the sample window.

A major drawback of the SMA is that it lets through a significant amount of the signal shorter than the window length. Worse, it &quot;actually inverts it.&quot; This can lead to unexpected artifacts, such as peaks in the smoothed result appearing where there were troughs in the data. It also leads to the result being less smooth than expected since some of the higher frequencies are not properly removed.

Its frequency response is a type of low-pass filter called sinc-in-frequency.

== Continuous moving average ==
The continuous moving average is defined with the following integral. The formula_18 environment formula_19 around formula_20 defines the intensity of smoothing of the graph of the function.
:formula_21
The continuous moving average of the function formula_22 is defined as:
:formula_23
A larger formula_24 smoothes the source graph of the function (blue) formula_22 more. The animations below show the moving average as animation in dependency of different values for formula_24. The fraction formula_27 is used, because formula_28 is the interval width for the integral.

==Cumulative average==
In a cumulative average (CA), the data arrive in an ordered datum stream, and the user would like to get the average of all of the data up until the current datum. For example, an investor may want the average price of all of the stock transactions for a particular stock up until the current time. As each new transaction occurs, the average price at the time of the transaction can be calculated for all of the transactions up to that point using the cumulative average, typically an equally weighted average of the sequence of &quot;n&quot; values formula_29 up to the current time:
formula_30

==Weighted moving average==
A weighted average is an average that has multiplying factors to give different weights to data at different positions in the sample window. Mathematically, the weighted moving average is the convolution of the data with a fixed weighting function. One application is removing pixelization from a digital graphical image. This is also known as Anti-aliasing 

In the financial field, and more specifically in the analyses of financial data, a weighted moving average (WMA) has the specific meaning of weights that decrease in arithmetical progression. In an &quot;n&quot;-day WMA the latest day has weight &quot;n&quot;, the second latest formula_31, etc., down to one.

formula_32

The denominator is a triangle number equal to formula_33 In the more general case the denominator will always be the sum of the individual weights.

When calculating the WMA across successive values, the difference between the numerators of formula_34 and formula_35 is formula_36. If we denote the sum formula_37 by formula_38, then

formula_39

The graph at the right shows how the weights decrease, from highest weight for the most recent data, down to zero. It can be compared to the weights in the exponential moving average which follows.

==Exponential moving average==
An exponential moving average (EMA), also known as an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), is a first-order infinite impulse response filter that applies weighting factors which decrease exponentially. The weighting for each older datum decreases exponentially, never reaching zero. 
This formulation is according to Hunter (1986).

There is also a multivariate implementation of EWMA, known as MEWMA.

==Other weightings==
Other weighting systems are used occasionally – for example, in share trading a volume weighting will weight each time period in proportion to its trading volume.

A further weighting, used by actuaries, is Spencer&#x27;s 15-Point Moving Average (a central moving average). Its symmetric weight coefficients are [−3, −6, −5, 3, 21, 46, 67, 74, 67, 46, 21, 3, −5, −6, −3], which factors as and leaves samples of any quadratic or cubic polynomial unchanged.

Outside the world of finance, weighted running means have many forms and applications. Each weighting function or &quot;kernel&quot; has its own characteristics. In engineering and science the frequency and phase response of the filter is often of primary importance in understanding the desired and undesired distortions that a particular filter will apply to the data.

A mean does not just &quot;smooth&quot; the data. A mean is a form of low-pass filter. The effects of the particular filter used should be understood in order to make an appropriate choice. On this point, the French version of this article discusses the spectral effects of 3 kinds of means (cumulative, exponential, Gaussian).

==Moving median==
From a statistical point of view, the moving average, when used to estimate the underlying trend in a time series, is susceptible to rare events such as rapid shocks or other anomalies. A more robust estimate of the trend is the simple moving median over &quot;n&quot; time points:
formula_40
where the median is found by, for example, sorting the values inside the brackets and finding the value in the middle. For larger values of &quot;n&quot;, the median can be efficiently computed by updating an indexable skiplist.

Statistically, the moving average is optimal for recovering the underlying trend of the time series when the fluctuations about the trend are normally distributed. However, the normal distribution does not place high probability on very large deviations from the trend which explains why such deviations will have a disproportionately large effect on the trend estimate. It can be shown that if the fluctuations are instead assumed to be Laplace distributed, then the moving median is statistically optimal. For a given variance, the Laplace distribution places higher probability on rare events than does the normal, which explains why the moving median tolerates shocks better than the moving mean.

When the simple moving median above is central, the smoothing is identical to the median filter which has applications in, for example, image signal processing. The Moving Median is a more robust alternative to the Moving Average when it comes to estimating the underlying trend in a time series. While the Moving Average is optimal for recovering the trend if the fluctuations around the trend are normally distributed, it is susceptible to the impact of rare events such as rapid shocks or anomalies. In contrast, the Moving Median, which is found by sorting the values inside the time window and finding the value in the middle, is more resistant to the impact of such rare events. This is because, for a given variance, the Laplace distribution, which the Moving Median assumes, places higher probability on rare events than the normal distribution that the Moving Average assumes. As a result, the Moving Median provides a more reliable and stable estimate of the underlying trend even when the time series is affected by large deviations from the trend. Additionally, the Moving Median smoothing is identical to the Median Filter, which has various applications in image signal processing.

==Moving average regression model==
In a moving average regression model, a variable of interest is assumed to be a weighted moving average of unobserved independent error terms; the weights in the moving average are parameters to be estimated.

Those two concepts are often confused due to their name, but while they share many similarities, they represent distinct methods and are used in very different contexts.

<text>The is a sacred bow (&quot;yumi&quot;) used in 1103 A.D. in Japan. This bow is said to be one of the oldest and most sacred Japanese weapons; the first Emperor Jimmu is always depicted carrying a bow.

According to legend; at that time, the Imperial Palace was taken over by an evil demon, which caused the Emperor to fall ill with great anxiety and suffering. When the Imperial High Priests tried and failed in their efforts to destroy the demon and dispel the Imperial household of its influence, they were at a loss. Finally, an archer, Minamoto no Yorimasa, was summoned to the Imperial Palace in the hopes of slaying the demon with his bow and arrow, ridding the palace of this plague. With a steady hand and a virtuous heart, Yorimasa vanquished the demon with the first arrow, and his bow was declared to be a &quot;hama yumi&quot;, an &quot;Evil-Destroying Bow&quot; (and the first arrow a &quot;hama ya&quot; an &quot;Evil-Destroying Arrow&quot;).

Since then, &quot;hama yumi&quot; have been used in Buddhist and Shinto rituals of purification (i.e., &quot;Shihōbarai&quot;, 四方払い, the Purification/Sweep of the Four Directions). In Japan, it is believed that merely the twanging of its bowstring will frighten away ghosts, evil spirits and negative influences from the house. A miko will carry a &quot;hama yumi&quot; and a set of &quot;hama ya&quot; as part of their religious regalia, while back in Feudal Japan, they were used quite literally in defence of the shrine or temple.

As a result, , decorative arrows, are sold even today at shrines as &quot;Engimono&quot; (good-luck charms); smaller replicas have been placed in shrines and people&#x27;s homes. It is believed that even just one &quot;Hama-Ya&quot; which has been blessed by a Shinto Priest carries great spiritual power, will bring protection against the forces of evil, and for purification, and they are also believed to have the ability to attract vast good fortune. &quot;Hama ya&quot; and &quot;hama yumi&quot; are often given as gifts to celebrate the first New Year of a male baby&#x27;s life.

&quot;Hama-yumi&quot; replicas are scale versions of the sacred Japanese bow, coated with urushi, wrapped in fine rattan and accented in gold leaf. They are displayed in a stand, along with two arrows tipped with yanone (traditional warrior tips); one representing male and the other female, yin and yang (vermilion signifying male energy (yang), and black representing female energy (yin)).

It is designed to compile and run on any system which has an ANSI C compiler. While it is primarily intended to detect and diagnose memory leaks, it can also be used to analyze a program&#x27;s memory usage from its provided logging facilities. Memwatch differs from most debugging software because it is compiled directly into the program which will be debugged, instead of being compiled separately and loaded into the program at runtime.

<text>The Battle of Veracruz was a military conflict between the United States and Mexico that took place in the Mexican port city of Veracruz between April 21 to November 23, 1914.

The incident occurred in the midst of poor diplomatic relations between Mexico and the United States related to the ongoing Mexican Revolution. It began with an occupation in response to the Tampico Affair of April 9, 1914, where Mexican forces had detained nine American sailors, further worsened relations, and led to widespread anti-Americanism in Mexico.

==Background==

Mexico–United States relations had been strained by the Mexican–American War (1846–1848). The expansionist policies of US President James K. Polk, combined with the Mexican government&#x27;s desire to retain control of Texas and Upper California, led to the outbreak of military conflict between the United States and Mexico in 1846. The decisive US victory led to Mexico ceding 55% of its territory to the United States and a sense of animosity developing between the two nations.

Relations improved during Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s presidency. He provided military aid in the form of supplies for the Mexican government during their war against French occupation. Porfirio Díaz, head of state of Mexico from 1876 to 1911, took advantage of this improvement and encouraged US investment in order to shore up Mexico&#x27;s stagnant economy. However, tensions re-emerged in 1911 after Diaz resigned, as Henry Lane Wilson, the US Ambassador to Mexico, worked to overthrow his successor, Francisco I. Madero, and replace him with General Victoriano Huerta, whom Ambassador Wilson viewed as better for American interests. The resulting coup d&#x27;état took place in February 1913 and was known as La Decena Tragica.

After becoming president in March 1913, Woodrow Wilson withdrew US recognition from the government of Victoriano Huerta and began encouraging the great powers to follow suit. The situation escalated more when Wilson imposed an arms embargo on Mexico in August 1913. A couple of months later, in October 1913, rebellions in the states of Chihuahua and Morelos led by Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata broke out after Huerta declared victory in a blatantly fraudulent election. The US subsequently supplied Villa with munitions in order to defeat Huerta.

The Tampico Affair itself was set off when nine American sailors were arrested by the Mexican government for entering off-limit areas in Tampico, Tamaulipas. The unarmed sailors were arrested when they entered a fuel loading station. The sailors were released, but the US naval commander Henry T. Mayo demanded an apology and a 21-gun salute. The apology was provided, but not the salute. In the end, the tensions culminated in US President Woodrow Wilson ordering the US Navy to prepare for the occupation of the port of Veracruz. While awaiting authorization from the US Congress to carry out such action, Wilson was alerted to a delivery of weapons for General Victoriano Huerta due to arrive in the port on April 21 aboard the German-registered cargo steamer SS &quot;Ypiranga&quot;. As a result, Wilson issued an immediate order to seize the port&#x27;s customs office and confiscate the weaponry. The weapons had actually been sourced by John Wesley De Kay, an American financier and businessman with large investments in Mexico, and a Russian arms dealer from Puebla, Leon Rasst, not the German government, as newspapers reported at the time.

Part of the arms shipment to Mexico originated from the Remington Arms company in the United States. The arms and ammunition were to be shipped to Mexico via Odesa and Hamburg to skirt the American arms embargo. In Hamburg, De Kay added to the shipment. The landing of the arms was blocked at Veracruz, but they were discharged a few weeks later in Puerto Mexico, a port controlled by Huerta at the time.

==Initial landing==
On the morning of April 21, 1914, warships of the United States Atlantic Fleet under the command of Rear Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher began preparations for the seizure of the Veracruz waterfront. Fletcher&#x27;s orders were to &quot;Seize custom house. Do not permit war supplies to be delivered to Huerta government or any other party.&quot; At 11:12 AM, consul William Canada watched from the roof of the American Consulate as the first boatload of Marines left the auxiliary vessel . Whaleboats carrying 502 Marines from the 2nd Advanced Base Regiment, 285 armed Navy sailors from the battleship , and a provisional battalion composed of the Marine detachments from &quot;Florida&quot; and her sister ship also began landing operations. As planned earlier, American consul William W. Canada notified General Gustavo Maass that Americans were occupying the port and warned him to &quot;cooperate with the naval forces in maintaining order.&quot; Maass, however, was not permitted by Mexico City to surrender the port.

Maass ordered the Eighteenth Regiment, under the command of General Luis B. Becerril, to distribute rifles to the populace and to the prisoners in &quot;La Galera&quot; military prison, and then all to proceed to the dock area. Maass also ordered the Nineteenth Regiment, under the command of General Francisco A. Figueroa, to take up positions on Pier Number Four. Maass then radioed a dispatch to General Aurelio Blanquet, Minister of War in Mexico City, of the American invasion. Blanquet ordered Maass to not resist, but to retreat to Tejería, inland. The landing party, under the command of William R. Rush reached Pier 4 at 11:20. A large crowd of Mexican and American citizens gathered to watch the spectacle. The American invaders, under the command of Marine Lt. Col. Wendell C. Neville, proceeded to their objectives without resistance. By 11:45, the rail terminal and cable station were occupied.

Commodore Manuel Azueta encouraged cadets of the Veracruz Naval Academy to take up the defense of the port for themselves.

==Battle of Veracruz==
Three Navy rifle companies were instructed to capture the customs house, post, and telegraph offices, while the Marines went for the railroad terminal, roundhouse, and yard, the cable office and the power plant.

Arms were distributed to the population, who were largely untrained in the use of bolt-action rifles like the German-made Mausers and had trouble finding the correct ammunition. In short, the defense of the city by its populace was hindered by the lack of central organization and a lack of adequate supplies. The defense of the city also included the release of the prisoners held at the &quot;La Galera&quot; military prison, not those at San Juan de Ulúa (some of whom were political prisoners), who were later attended to by the US Navy.

Although most of the regular troops retreated with Maass to Tejería, the liberated prisoners under the command of Lt. Col. Manuel Contreras, and some civilians, opposed the Americans as they made their way to the custom house. At 11:57, the Mexicans fired upon the Americans as they reached the intersection of Independencia and Emparán. The navy signalman on top of the Terminal Hotel, Capt. Rush&#x27;s headquarters, was the first American casualty, and by the end of the day, 4 Americans were dead and 20 wounded.

At 1:30 PM, the &quot;Ypiranga&quot; was intercepted, and detained, before it could off load its cargo of weapons and ammunition.

On the night of April 21, Fletcher decided that he had no choice but to expand the initial operation to include the entire city, not just the waterfront. At 8:00 AM the next day, he gave orders to take control of the entire city. 

At 8:35 PM, Capt. C.T. Vogelsang&#x27;s &quot;San Francisco&quot; entered the harbor next to the &quot;Prairie&quot; and off loaded a landing party. At 3 AM, Commander William A. Moffett&#x27;s &quot;Chester&quot; offloaded 2 companies of marines and a company of seamen. These were followed by men from the &quot;Minnesota&quot; and &quot;Hancock&quot; of Admiral Charles J. Badger&#x27;s Atlantic Fleet, bringing the total American men ashore to more than 3,000.

At 07:45 April 22, the advance began. The leathernecks adapted to street fighting, which was a novelty to them. The sailors were less adroit at this style of fighting. A regiment led by Navy Captain E. A. Anderson advanced on the Naval Academy in parade-ground formation, making his men easy targets for the partisans barricaded inside. The cadets previously occupying the building had left Veracruz the night before after suffering casualties. This attack was initially repulsed; soon, the attack was renewed, with artillery support from three warships in the harbor, &quot;Prairie&quot;, , and , that pounded the academy with their long guns for a few minutes, silencing all resistance.
The city was secured by 11:00 AM, and by evening more than 6,000 troops were ashore.

That afternoon, the First Advanced Base Regiment, originally bound for Tampico, came ashore under the command of Colonel John A. Lejeune.

A small naval aviation detachment arrived aboard on April 24 under the command of Henry C. Mustin. Two early aircraft assembled by Glenn Curtiss prior to formation of the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company conducted aerial reconnaissance around Veracruz. This was the first operational use of naval aircraft and the first time US aviators of any service were the target of ground fire.

On April 26, Fletcher declared martial law, and started turning the occupation over to the American army under the command of General Frederick Funston. Nineteen American sailors and Marines were killed.

A third provisional regiment of Marines, assembled in Philadelphia, arrived on May 1 under the command of Colonel Littleton W. T. Waller, who assumed overall command of the brigade, by that time numbering some 3,141 officers and men. By then, the sailors and Marines of the Fleet had returned to their ships and an Army brigade had landed. 

===Resolution===
Marines and soldiers continued to garrison the city until the US withdrawal on November 23, which occurred after Argentina, Brazil, and Chile became involved. Known as the ABC powers, they were the most powerful and wealthy countries in South America at the time. They were able to settle the issues between the two nations at the Niagara Falls peace conference.

==Political consequences==
As an immediate reaction to the military invasion of Veracruz several anti-US riots broke out in Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Uruguay. US citizens were expelled from Mexican territory and some had to be accommodated in refugee campuses at New Orleans, Texas City, and San Diego. Even the British government was privately irritated, because they had previously agreed with Woodrow Wilson that the United States would not invade Mexico without prior warning. The military invasion of Veracruz was also a decisive factor in favor of keeping Mexico neutral in World War I. Mexico refused to participate with the United States in its military excursion in Europe and guaranteed German companies they could keep their operations open, especially in Mexico City. Nevertheless, the tension between the US and Mexico was great enough that the German government offered to help Mexico reconquer territory lost to the US in the Mexican American war in exchange for Mexican soldiers to help Germany in World War I. The Mexican government refused this offer.

US President Woodrow Wilson considered another military invasion of Veracruz and Tampico in 1917–1918, so as to take control of Tehuantepec Isthmus and Tampico oil fields, but this time the new Mexican President Venustiano Carranza gave the order to destroy the oil fields in case the Marines tried to land there.

Located on the James River and Kanawha Turnpike (the road that served as an extension of the canal across what is now West Virginia), many early travelers on this road stopped to see the view of the river below. In modern times, the Midland Trail carries U.S. Route 60 through the same general route. Ample parking at the overlook in the state park provides tourists with free access to the views. English writer Harriet Martineau, who passed through the area in the 1830s, found the view at Hawk&#x27;s Nest nearly as moving as Niagara Falls. Martineau also reported the legend that John Marshall, as a surveyor in his youth, had been its first white discoverer.

The name Hawk&#x27;s Nest derived from the many fish hawks which inhabited the massive cliffs at this point. When the railroad began blasting in the area between 1869 and 1873, the hawks left the site and never returned. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway was completed through the area on January 29, 1873, and a ceremony was held at Hawk&#x27;s Nest Station.

A hydro-electric project nearby became known as the Hawk&#x27;s Nest Incident. During the construction of a three-mile-long tunnel by Union Carbide beginning in 1927, the tunnel was filled with silica dust. Workers were not given masks for protection, even though management wore such masks during the short times they visited for inspection. As a result, thousands of workers, mostly poor and African American, died from silicosis, sometimes as quickly as within a single year.

In addition to the real-life tragedy of the Hawk&#x27;s Nest Incident, an overlook in the state park called Lovers&#x27; Leap is the location of legendary stories of romantically inspired suicides by young lovers who cannot be together due to family and cultural obstacles.

Hawks Nest State Park offers a nature museum, a nine-hole golf course, a 31-room lodge, jetboat rides and hiking.

<doc id="990837" wikidata="Q5685233" url="?curid=990837" title="Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster">
<text>The Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster was a large-scale incident of occupational lung disease in the 1930s as the result of the construction of the Hawks Nest Tunnel near Gauley Bridge, West Virginia, as part of a hydroelectric project. This project is considered to be one of the worst industrial disasters in American history.

==Tunnel==
Kanawha and New River Power Company, a subsidiary of Union Carbide, diverted the New River to increase power generation at a plant in Alloy, West Virginia. Beginning in March 1930, its contractor Rinehart &amp; Dennis began construction of the tunnel carrying the river under Gauley Mountain. A dam was constructed immediately below Hawks Nest to divert most of the New River flow into the tunnel. It then re-enters the river near Gauley Bridge leaving a section known as &quot;the Dries&quot; in between.

==Silica==
Facing widespread unemployment during the Great Depression, about three thousand men, three-quarters of whom were Black, came to West Virginia to dig the tunnel. They worked ten to fifteen hour shifts, using drills and dynamite to mine the sandstone, which was composed primarily of cemented quartz (silica) sand. The workers completed the project more than twice as quickly as original projections. They were not given any masks or breathing equipment to use while mining, although management wore such equipment during inspection visits. Black workers told Congress in 1936 that they were denied breaks and even forced to work at gunpoint. As a result of the exposure to silica dust, many workers developed silicosis, a debilitating and incurable lung disease caused by the effects of silica dust in the lungs. A large number of the workers eventually died from silicosis, in some cases as quickly as within a year.

There are no definitive statistics as to the death toll from the Hawks Nest disaster. According to a historical marker on site, there were 109 admitted deaths. A Congressional hearing placed the death toll at 476. Other sources range from 700 to over 1,000 deaths amongst the 3,000 workers. Many of the workers at the site were African-Americans from the southern United States who returned home or left the region after becoming sick, making it difficult to calculate an accurate total.

==Cultural references==

==Hawks Nest workers memorial and grave site==
A memorial to the Hawks Nest workers and a grave site is located at 98 Hilltop Drive in Mount Lookout, near Summersville Lake and U.S. Route 19 (). The site is located several miles from Martha White’s farm at Summersville where many of the black miners were buried, since they were not allowed to be buried in &quot;white&quot; cemeteries. The Memorial has the following text:
 This Memorial honors an estimated 764 tunnel workers who died from mining a 3.8 mile tunnel through Gauley Mountain to divert water from the New River to a hydroelectric plant near Gauley Bridge in 1930–31. The tunnel cut through almost pure silica in some areas and exposed the unprotected workers to silica dust that quickly caused acute silicosis, a fatal lung disease. This is considered America&#x27;s worst industrial disaster. Workers in the tunnel were primarily migrant workers, mostly black, who were paid a few dollars per day. When they became sick, many were driven out of the camps to die elsewhere. Those African Americans who died in the camps could not be buried in local &quot;white&quot; cemeteries. A few were sent by rail back to their families. More were taken at night under the cover of darkness to Summersville and buried unceremoniously on a farm. Later these graves had to be moved to widen US Route 19. The remains were disinterred in 1972 and transported several miles to the present site. The decomposed remains were placed in child size coffins and reburied here, resulting in about 48 small grave depressions seen at this grave site. 

The memorial was created at the site, unmarked for 40 years, where Department of Highways reburied the bodies of about 48 miners while widening U.S. Route 19. The location of the site was rediscovered with help of West Virginia State University professor Richard Hartman, after local couple George and Charlotte Yeager spearheaded effort to build the memorial in 2009. The Memorial was dedicated on September 7, 2012.

There is also a &quot;Historical Marker&quot; at nearby Hawks Nest State Park, which reads:
Construction of nearby tunnel, diverting waters of New River through Gauley Mt for hydroelectric power, resulted in state&#x27;s worst industrial disaster. Silica rock dust caused 109 admitted deaths in mostly black, migrant underground work force of 3,000. Congressional hearing placed toll at 476 for 1930-35. Tragedy brought recognition of acute silicosis as occupational lung disease and compensation legislation to protect workers.

<doc id="990853" wikidata="Q10918728" url="?curid=990853" title="Sub-lieutenant">
<text>Sub-lieutenant is usually a junior officer rank, used in armies, navies and air forces.

In most armies, sub-lieutenant is the lowest commissioned officer rank. However, in Brazil, it is the highest non-commissioned rank, and in Spain, it is the second highest non-commissioned rank.

As a naval rank, a sub-lieutenant ranks below a lieutenant.

== Army and air force rank ==
In France, a sub-lieutenant () is the junior commissioned officer in the army or the air force. He wears a band in the colour of his corps (e.g. gold for infantry, silver for armoured cavalry, etc.). During the 18th century a rank of existed in the French Navy. It was the equivalent of the master&#x27;s mate rank of the Royal Navy. It is now replaced by the rank of &quot;first ensign&quot; ().

An Argentinian sub-lieutenant wears a single silver sun on each shoulder, Brazilian sub-lieutenants are the most senior non-commissioned rank (called Sub-Officer in the Navy and Air force), wearing a golden lozenge. In Mexico, the sub-lieutenant is the most junior officer in the rank scale, and wears a single gold bar. Thai sub-lieutenants and acting sub-lieutenants wear a single star on each shoulder.

The British Army briefly used the rank of sub-lieutenant from 1871 to 1877, replacing the ranks of ensign in the infantry and cornet in the cavalry. In 1877, it was replaced in turn by the rank of second lieutenant, although this had always been used by the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, and rifle and fusilier regiments.

=== History of naval rank ===
In the British Royal Navy, a passed midshipman awaiting promotion often elected to become a master&#x27;s mate, normally an experienced petty officer who assisted the sailing master. Though formally the rating did not lead to promotion to lieutenant, master&#x27;s mates were paid more than any other rating and were the only ratings allowed to command any sort of vessel. A midshipman who became a master&#x27;s mate got an increase in pay from £1 13s 6d to £3 16s per month, but initially reduced his chances at a commission. Over time, however, service as a master&#x27;s mate became a normal part of the path to a commission. The situation caused some confusion during the last part of the 18th century, when two parallel roles—master&#x27;s mates trying to become masters, and former midshipmen working toward a commission—held the same title and responsibilities aboard ship.

By the first years of the 19th century, the prefix &quot;master&#x27;s&quot; was dropped for passed midshipmen, to distinguish them from master&#x27;s mates in the navigator&#x27;s branch. In 1824 two further grades were also introduced, consisting of master&#x27;s assistants and second-class volunteers. These corresponded to midshipmen and first-class volunteers respectively in the executive line. From this point, passed midshipmen had the rating master&#x27;s mate, abbreviated as mate, and prospective masters had the rating master&#x27;s assistant. These changes helped eliminate the confusion caused by the mingling of midshipmen in the navigator&#x27;s branch.

In 1861 the rank of mate was renamed sub-lieutenant.

=== Modern practice ===
In the modern Royal Navy, all officer cadets now commission as midshipmen, regardless of whether they are a graduate or a school leaver. They are subsequently promoted to sub-lieutenant one year after entering Britannia Royal Naval College. Upper yardsmen commission as sub-lieutenants assuming their seniority date is greater than 12 months.

In the Royal Canadian Navy, all undergoing basic officer training join as naval cadets, but upon graduation, those who joined with a bachelor&#x27;s degree receive an immediate promotion to acting sub-lieutenant, while those who do not retain their rank as naval cadet until such time as they finish more career-related training.

=== Use ===
In the Royal Navy, the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal New Zealand Navy, the insignia of both sub-lieutenants and acting sub-lieutenants consists of one medium gold braid stripe with an executive curl. The size of this stripe should not be confused with the narrow stripe, colloquially referred to as &quot;spaghetti strap&quot;, used on the Royal New Zealand Navy rank of ensign and the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s naval cadets. The Royal Air Force also followed this example of braiding when developing their rank system (see flying officer).

The insignia of sub-lieutenants in most commonwealth countries are identical to the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard grade of ensign (although US ranks do not use the executive curl), even though its equivalent grade in the USN is actually lieutenant junior grade.

In the Royal Canadian Navy, acting sub-lieutenants display one medium stripe. A sub-lieutenant adds a narrow stripe &quot;below&quot; the medium stripe to maintain the executive curl on the top. The equivalent air force lieutenant rank has the narrow stripe above the medium stripe since these elements do not need to maintain spacing on top due to the lack of an executive curl; the Royal Canadian Navy followed this pattern before the addition of the curl in 2010.

=== Gallery ===
=== Acting sub-lieutenant ===
In 1955, the Royal Navy created the rank of acting sub-lieutenant, although it had existed intermittently in the world wars. Unlike their substantive counterparts, acting sub-lieutenants are subordinate officers, as they hold their ranks by order and not by commission. Upon passing fleet board, acting sub-lieutenants were confirmed as sub-lieutenants and issued commissions backdated to the date when they were appointed acting sub-lieutenants. The rank of acting sub-lieutenant was abolished in the Royal Navy around 1993 but remained in the Royal Naval Reserve until 2013; officers in both the RN and RNR now commission into the rank of midshipman. The rank of acting sub-lieutenant remains in the Royal Navy only within the University Royal Naval Unit where training officers enter at this rank.

Before its abolition, the rank of acting sub-lieutenant in the Royal Navy corresponded with, but was junior to, the ranks of lieutenant (Army) and flying officer (RAF).

In many Commonwealth navies (e.g. Canada and Australia), the rank of acting sub-lieutenant still exists as a commissioned rank equivalent to second lieutenant, while the rank of sub-lieutenant is equivalent to that of an army lieutenant. As the term &quot;acting&quot; is a designation, both acting and substantive ranks should be addressed as &quot;sub-lieutenant&quot;; the full designation including &quot;acting&quot; should be used in written documents, however. Indeed, when someone is addressed as &quot;acting sub-lieutenant&quot;, it can be seen as a way of patronising an individual in a derogatory manner due to the emphasis of their &quot;acting&quot; rank.

The Royal New Zealand Navy, Republic of Fiji Navy and South African Navy follows the US precedent in titling its lowest commissioned officer ensign.

In the Royal Thai Army, Army Reserve Force Students who complete grade 5 and their B.D. are promoted to the rank of acting second lieutenant (ว่าที่ ร้อยตรี).

<text>Brachystegia tamarindoides, known as mu&#x27;unze and also as the mountain acacia, is a medium-sized tree with smooth grey bark, bluish-green leaves and small creamy-white flowers that produce copious amounts of pollen and nectar. It is almost always very close to upturned umbrella shaped with a partially developed flat top, making it easy to recognise in mixed woodland. In this it differs from most of the other &quot;Brachystegia&quot; species that have variable shapes. The leaves are feathery in appearance, with around 10-12 leaflets arrayed along each leaf stalk.

==Distribution==
The muunze is found all over south tropical Africa and the less humid parts of east equatorial Africa. It reaches its southernmost extent around 21° S in the Runde River valley region of Zimbabwe. It is a tree of inland regions thriving at altitudes of around 900 – 1750 metres. In the hotter, northern parts of its range it is found in drier types of woodland but further south it is found in both moist and dry open woodland. It prefers well-drained conditions and tolerates even very thin and rocky soils and so is usually restricted to hillsides and hilltops (not mountainous regions as such) rather than best positions in valley floors. In these positions, the tree is very easily recognisable due to its fluttering foliage, distinctive shape and flaky but smooth grey bark.

==Ecology==
The muunze is nowhere common but is widely distributed in its range and grows to its maximum size where many other trees find the soil too thin or poor; about 14 – 16 metres depending on competition. It is a tree of open woodland in areas of contrasting wet and dry seasons, the longer the dry season, the more likely that the muunze stands bare for a notable period. Like other &quot;Brachystegia&quot; species it needs a cool, dry resting period when it loses its leaves followed by a hot dry spell that revives the tree. At this time (usually August–September) the new leaves are produced. These are a pale to rich red colour that fade to green over about a week. The muunze is therefore a beautiful sight in springtime but it does not compare to the much more striking show put on by the closely related msasa.
The seeds are enclosed in a purplish woody pod. The seeds are dispersed, as in other &quot;Brachystegia&quot; species, when the drying pod is split by increasing tension in autumn (about April to May or later), hurling the seeds from it.

Woodland of &quot;Brachystegia tamarindoides&quot; subsp. &quot;microphylla&quot; grows on quartzite outcrops and rocky slopes in the Chimanimani Mountains of Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The trees grow low and spreading, and are draped with tassels of &quot;Usnea&quot; lichen, with a sparse understory.

==Name usage==
The misnomer &quot;mountain acacia&quot; for &quot;B. tamarindoides&quot; reflects the similarity of the tree&#x27;s foliage to the feathery acacia species that are also found in Africa. Unlike African acacias, however, the muunze has no thorns. The name is, for instance, found in a paper concerning the degradation of woodlands by elephant predation and fire in the northern part of the Gonarezhou National Park in south-east Zimbabwe. The name muunze is Shona and is used in Zimbabwe and Mozambique.

<doc id="990862" wikidata="Q6773469" url="?curid=990862" title="Marshall Group">
<text>Marshall Group (registered as Marshall of Cambridge (Holdings) Ltd,) is a British company headquartered in Cambridge, United Kingdom. Subsidiaries include Marshall Aerospace, an aircraft maintenance, modification, and design company located at Cambridge City Airport. Other subsidiaries are Marshall Land Systems (ground defence), Marshall Slingsby Advanced Composites, Marshall Fleet Solutions, Marshall Skills Academy andMarshall Property. Marshall also owns and operates the airport itself.

The company was originally founded by David Gregory Marshall in 1909. Initially operating chauffeur services, the firm soon branched out into vehicle repair and dealership activities. During the 1930s, Marshall became increasingly engaged in aviation; by the end of the Second World War, the company had trained in excess of 20,000 aircrew for service within the Royal Air Force. It was also engaged in repair and modification of military aircraft during the conflict.

During the postwar era, the Marshall companies have been involved in aerospace and special vehicle engineering, with Marshall Aerospace forming a major part of the Marshall Group. The company performs all aspects of design, manufacture, maintenance, modification, conversion and logistic support of military, commercial and business aircraft. Traditionally focused on military customers, Marshall Aerospace has increasingly orientated itself towards the civilian sector in recent decades. It employs over 2,000 people and is based on an site with of covered Aircraft hangar space on the Cambridge Airport site. 

In October 2021, Marshall announced that it had decided to move its Aerospace operations to Cranfield Airport (near Milton Keynes) and that &quot;it will leave its current base at Cambridge Airport by 2030&quot;. In November 2022, Marshall Aerospace announced that it expects to have left Cambridge Airport &quot;by 2027&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bedford Today 11/22&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early years===
The Marshall group was originally established during 1909 by its founder David Gregory Marshall, who gave the company his name. Its initial base was a small lock-up garage in Brunswick Gardens, Cambridge, and at first provided chauffeur services to individual customers. It quickly became commercially viable, enabling the business to relocate to larger premises in Kings Street during 1910 and again to Jesus Lane just two years later, expanding its operations to the sale of vehicles shortly thereafter. In 1912, Marshall worked on its first aircraft, helping to repair the engine of a British Army airship, the &quot;Beta II&quot;, which had made an emergency landing on Jesus Green, a park near its garage. During the First World War, Marshall&#x27;s premises were engaged in the servicing and repair of vehicles required for the British war effort.

During the late 1920s, David Marshall&#x27;s son, Arthur, took an active role in the company. A keen engineer and pilot, Arthur was involved in establishing an aerodrome at Fen Ditton on the outskirts of Cambridge. During 1930, the Marshall Flying School was formed at Fen Ditton, marking the company&#x27;s entry into the aviation sector. During the 1930s, Marshall purchased a large amount of farmland, using some of it to establish what would become Cambridge City Airport, which was larger and with greater facilities than its predecessor. Formally opened in 1937, the new airport was fortuitously timed with a coinciding national priority on rearmament, which included the training of military aircrew. Accordingly, in 1938, a major flying training school for the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve was established by Marshall; it had reportedly trained over 600 new RAF pilots prior to the start of the Battle of Britain. The scheme was ramped up during the Second World War; the company ultimately trained in excess of 20,000 aircrew, including pilots, observers and flying instructors. During 1941, the training scheme was universally adopted by the Royal Air Force (RAF).

Prior to the war, Marshall had opened a second garage, known as &quot;Airport Garage&quot;, on the site; both garages were temporarily closed down during the conflict and were reopened shortly after its end. In the meantime, the company engaged in the repair and modification of military aircraft. Marshall performed work on over 5,000 aircraft, ranging in size and complexity from Airspeed Oxford and Avro Anson transport aircraft to front-line combat types as the de Havilland Mosquito, Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane, Vickers Wellington and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. To cope with this workload, the firm&#x27;s workforce was expanded to around 3,000 employees, many of which were women. Marshall chose to continue its involvement in aviation work, such as repairs, structural modifications and conversions, even after the war&#x27;s end, although it mostly abandoned its final assembly work. Instead, the firm operated as a sub-contractor of virtually all the British aircraft manufacturing companies.

===Postwar===

Marshall Motor Group rapidly flourished in the postwar era; various new garages were soon established to serve Peterborough, Bedford, and neighbouring smaller towns. During the 1950s and 1960s, the firm found work in modifying hundreds of various civil airliners, including the Vickers Viscount, the first turboprop airliner, and de Havilland Comets, the first jet-powered airliner, and the Bristol Britannia. Marshall was also involved with the National Research Development Corporation, assisting Francis Thomas Bacon in the invention of the fuel cell. Around this time, Michael Marshall became the company&#x27;s CEO. He managed the company for several decades, during which time it became one of the largest privately owned businesses in Britain.
Since 1966, Marshall Aerospace has been the designated support company for the Royal Air Force&#x27;s fleet of C-130 Hercules. It has been formally recognised as a Sister Design Authority for the type since 1988. The company oversaw the introduction of RAF&#x27;s 25 second generation C-130J Super Hercules fleet, as well as the retirement of half of the service&#x27;s first generation aircraft. In addition to its domestic support operations, Marshall Aerospace has supported various international operators&#x27; own Hercules fleets. Marshall Group has also signed multiple agreements with US defense conglomerate Lockheed Martin to manufacture various components of the Super Hercules on behalf of the latter&#x27;s for the global supply chain.

Marshall Aerospace functioned as the design authority for the RAF&#x27;s fleet of Lockheed TriStar tanker and freighter aircraft; as well as the appointed sister design authority for the RAF&#x27;s Boeing E-3D Sentry. It undertook major maintenance and modification activity on these types, plus a range of other military and commercial aircraft. Notable design achievements include the design and production of Concorde&#x27;s droop nose and visor in 1967, and a vestibular sled for medical research which flew 112 orbits in Space Shuttle Challenger on STS-61-A in 1985. Marshall Aerospace has also performed a variety of passenger to tanker and freighter aircraft conversions. One unusual project was the conversion of a Lockheed L-1011 Tristar airliner into a launch vehicle for a satellite delivery system, on behalf of Orbital Sciences. Marshall Aerospace was the designated industrial body involved in the &quot;Vulcan to the Sky &quot; project, which restored Avro Vulcan XH558 to a flight-worthy condition and supported its operations for numerous years.

In 1992, Marshall bought AWD Trucks. Production in that subsidiary ended in 1998.

Marshall Group has been a long-term partner of Bombardier Aerospace. During 1998, the company was appointed the first independent authorised service centre in Europe for the Bombardier Global Express long-range business jet. In mid 2000, Marshall became involved in the Global Express&#x27; manufacturing process, performing interior completions on behalf of Bombardier. During the 2010s, the firm&#x27;s expertise with the type enabled it to perform extensive modifications of the airframe to produce customised special mission models for military customers. Marshall Aerospace has also performed the production of long range fuel tanks for various Boeing aircraft, including the Boeing 747-400ER and 777-200LR airliners, as well as the P-8 Poseidon multi-mission maritime aircraft.

By 2012, the Marshall Group was reporting an annual turnover in excess of £1 billion and was employing nearly 4,500 staff. During the 2010s, the business made various moves to expand its footprint in commercial aviation, announcing its intention to establish Cambridge Airport as a primary hub for business aviation operations during 2012. In September 2013, Marshall purchased Hawker Beechcraft&#x27;s services branch at Broughton, subsequently rebranding it &quot;Marshall Aviation Services&quot; as well as being appointed Hawker&#x27;s distributor for the UK, Ireland and Scandinavia. That same year, the company also bought FlairJet, an air charter specialist. This move was part of Marshall&#x27;s strategy to grow its charter fleet five-fold. At this time, Marshall Group was deliberately restructuring its business activities, particularly its sizable aerospace division.

During late 2015, Marshall Group announced that, in response to a downturn in demand from the British armed forces, the firm intended to focus on its growing civilian activities, including the resumption of VIP aircraft conversion work to counteract this. During 2019, the company announced that was planning to relocate its headquarters from its historic home at Cambridge Airport over the coming decade, although it noted there was value in relocating to a nearby location, such as Cranfield Airport, Duxford Aerodrome and RAF Wyton.
Marshall carried out depth maintenance and modified C-130J Super Hercules fleet of Bangladesh Air Force before delivered to Bangladesh. Those were ex RAF aircraft. Marshall also signed a multi-year multi-million-pound support contract for the C-130J fleet.

==Activities==
Marshall&#x27;s headquarters is located on an 800-acre site in Cambridge, UK. The group operates worldwide in the fields of aerospace, military land systems and fleet management; the company also cooperated with 67 franchised automotive dealerships across the UK by 2012.

Marshall Aerospace has been involved with all levels of aircraft maintenance, modification and conversion for more than seventy years. The company has the authorisation and experience to work on a range of aircraft from Cessna Citations to Boeing 747s in civil use, and Lockheed C-130 Hercules and Lockheed L-1011 TriStars for the military. Marshall Aerospace carries out maintenance from routine daily maintenance to a full aircraft depot level checks. All forms of conversions, re-configurations, modifications and repairs can be designed and implemented by Marshall Aerospace. The company&#x27;s commercial aircraft hangar can house a range of different aircraft, for example, one Boeing 747-400, one McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and two Airbus A320s. Marshall also has other hangar space that can hold up to 12 C-130s at a time. Amongst the various facilities it has, the firm possesses the largest quiet test building in Europe.

The company has a long history of rapid response to customers, an example being the complete repaint of a Tristar at Cambridge on 16 January 1991; it was repainted in &quot;desert colours&quot; overnight and flown back to the Gulf for operations on 17 January 1991, the first full day of Operation Desert Storm. During the 2010s, Marshall Aerospace opened a new main paint bay, which it claimed to be one of the largest in Europe, being big enough to accommodate an entire Boeing 747.

Besides aerospace, Marshall operates other divisions in a diverse range of fields. Marshall Group Properties owns Cambridge City Airport, where the company has its main base, and a large portion of the land surrounding it. Over the years, it has embarked on various development projects to expand the airport&#x27;s facilities and build thousands of homes nearby. The airport itself has been owned and operated by the company since 1937.

==Planned relocation==
In May 2019, Marshall announced that Cambridge City Airport would be closed to all traffic by 2030 at the latest. The Group plans to redevelop the airport site for around 12,000 homes and of business premises. In May 2019, the Group announced that it was deciding between three potential airfields for its continuing operations: Duxford Aerodrome, RAF Wyton in Cambridgeshire, or Cranfield Airport in Bedfordshire. In January 2020 the Group ruled out moving to Duxford due to incompatibility between the defence requirements of the Group and the requirements of the local traffic.

On 6 October 2020, Cranfield University and MADG announced that they had signed an option agreement for the potential relocation of Marshall Aerospace to Cranfield Airport. A spokesperson for MADG cautioned that &quot;it is important to note that the signing of the option agreement does not represent a final decision&quot;. In October 2021, the Group announced that it had decided in favour of the Cranfield option and that &quot;it will leave its current base at Cambridge Airport by 2030&quot;. Outline planning permission for the development at Cranfield was granted in April 2023.

<doc id="990873" wikidata="Q905078" url="?curid=990873" title="Metenolone">
<text>Metenolone, or methenolone, is an androgen and anabolic steroid (AAS) which is used in the form of esters such as metenolone acetate (brand name Primobolan, Nibal) and metenolone enanthate (brand name Primobolan Depot, Nibal Injection). Metenolone esters are used mainly in the treatment of anemia due to bone marrow failure. Metenolone acetate is taken by mouth, while metenolone enanthate is given by injection into muscle.
Side effects of metenolone esters include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire. Metenolone esters are synthetic androgens and anabolic steroids and hence are agonists of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). They have moderate anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects, as well as no estrogenic effects or risk of liver damage. Metenolone esters are androgen esters and prodrugs of metenolone in the body.
Metenolone esters were introduced for medical use in the early 1960s. In addition to their medical use, metenolone esters are used to improve physique and performance. The drugs are controlled substances in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit. They have mostly been discontinued for medical use and have limited availability.

==Medical uses==
Metenolone, as its esters, is used almost exclusively in the treatment of anemia due to bone marrow failure. It has also been used to treat wasting syndromes due to major surgery, infection, long-term corticosteroid therapy, malnutrition, or other causes. It has also been used to treat osteoporosis and sarcopenia, to inhibit the natural loss of muscle mass with aging, and to promote weight gain in underweight premature infants and children.

==Side effects==
Side effects of metenolone and its esters include virilization among others.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Due to its double bond between the C1 and C2 positions, metenolone is resistant to metabolism by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD). As such, unlike DHT and the closely related DHT derivatives mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT) and mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT), metenolone has considerable anabolic effects.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Metenolone has very low affinity for human serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), about 16% of that of testosterone and 3% of that of DHT.

==Chemistry==
Metenolone, also known as 1-methyl-4,5α-dihydro-δ1-testosterone (1-methyl-δ1-DHT) or as 1-methyl-5α-androst-1-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic androstane steroid and derivative of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). A closely related AAS is mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT).

==Society and culture==

===Generic names===
&quot;Metenolone&quot; is the generic name of the drug and its , while &quot;methenolone&quot; is its . It has also been referred to as &quot;methylandrostenolone&quot;. This synonym should not be confused with &quot;methandrostenolone&quot;, which is another name for a different AAS known as metandienone.

===Doping in sports===
Metenolone and its esters are banned from use in sports governed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. The NBA and NBPA also banned the use of metenolone and its esters under the Anti-Drug Program. There are known cases of doping in sports with metenolone esters by professional athletes.

===Morning four-ball===
U.S. captain Hal Sutton put his top pairing of Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson in the first match of the Ryder Cup, hoping to come out to a quick lead. The decision backfired on Sutton, as the Woods/Mickelson pairing fell behind almost from the start, eventually losing. Only a 7-foot par putt by Chris Riley on the 18th hole of his match kept Team USA from being shut out by Team Europe. Team USA never had the lead during any of the first day&#x27;s four-ball matches.

===Afternoon foursomes===
The afternoon alternate-shot session was almost as good for Team Europe as the morning session. Mickelson and Woods lost an early lead in their match, leaving Woods winless in the first day of his last three Ryder Cups. Team USA picked up its first full point, but Europe ended the day with a 6–1 lead, its largest lead after the first day in Ryder Cup history.

<text>The black-bellied sandgrouse (Pterocles orientalis) is a medium large bird in the sandgrouse family.

The nominate race breeds in Iberian Peninsula , Northwest Africa, the Canary Islands, Turkey, Iran, Cyprus and Israel. The eastern form &quot;P. o. arenarius&quot; (Pallas, 1775) is found in Kazakhstan, western China and northern Pakistan. It is a partial migrant, with central Asian birds moving to the Pakistan and northern India in winter.

==Taxonomy==
The black-bellied sandgrouse was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other grouse-like birds in the genus &quot;Tetrao&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Tetrao orientalis&quot;. The black-bellied sandgrouse is now placed with 13 other species in the genus &quot;Pterocles&quot; that was introduced in 1815 by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;pteron&quot; meaning &quot;wing&quot; with &quot;-klēs&quot; meaning &quot;notable&quot; or &quot;splendid&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;P. o. orientalis&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Canary Islands, Iberian Peninsula, Morocco to west Iran
* &quot;P. o. arenarius&quot; (Pallas, 1775) – Kazakhstan to south Iran and Afghanistan, east to northwest China

==Description==
The black-bellied sandgrouse is long and weighs , it is likely the largest species in the sandgrouse family. The male has a grey head, neck, and breast. The underparts are black and the upperparts are golden-brown with darker markings. There is a thin black border around the lower breast and a chestnut throat patch. This sandgrouse has a small, pigeon-like head and neck, but a stocky compact body. It has long pointed wings and a fast direct flight. The white underwings and black belly make this species easy to identify while in flight. Flocks fly to watering holes at dawn.

The female has browner, more finely marked upper parts, including the head and the breast. The underparts and breast band are identical to the male. The eastern race is paler and heavier than &quot;orientalis&quot;. Males have yellower upperparts and greyer underparts than the western form. Females are whiter below, but often inseparable. The call is a soft &quot;chowrrr rrrr-rrrr&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
This gregarious species breeds on dry open plains and similar habitats, but unlike the pin-tailed sandgrouse, it avoids areas completely lacking in vegetation. Its nest is a ground scrape into which three greenish eggs with cryptic markings are laid. Both sexes incubate, but only the male brings water.

== Fossil record ==
Fossils of the black-bellied sandgrouse are known from the Nefud Desert of Saudi Arabia and date back to the Middle Pleistocene, about 500,000 BP.

==In literature==
In the Chagatai language memoir &quot;Baburnama&quot;, the Mughal emperor Babur calls the &quot;Pterocles orientalis arenarius&quot; the &quot;qīl-qūyirūgh&quot; &quot;horse-tail&quot; and describing it as the &quot;&quot;bāghrī qarā&quot; of Transoxiana&quot;.

<text>Brachystegia boehmii, named after the 19th-century German naturalist and collector Richard Böhm, is a flat-topped tree with a spreading crown, native to eastern and southern Africa. It forms an important component of miombo woodland, and occurs in Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. Common names are machabel (Mashonaland), mufuti (Zimbabwe) and Prince of Wales feathers.

Occurring in the altitude range 900 – 1600 m, and growing to 15 m tall, it has glabrous or pubescent young branchlets. Its long, pendulous, tufted leaves are some 35 cm long, with 15−30 pairs of leaflets, the middle pair measuring 30−65 x 7−18 mm. Upper and lower surfaces are more or less concolorous. New spring foliage is pink to brick-red, turning buff or yellow to pale green, maturing to a much darker colour. Fallen leaves are dull reddish in colour.

Bark is grey to brown, rough, and somewhat coarsely reticulate, narrowly fissured and transversely cracked.

==Uses==
The wood is medium reddish brown, heavy, tough and strong with a slightly interlocking grain. It is not easy to work with and blunts tools very quickly. In Shona culture, infusions of the tree leaf have traditionally been used for treatment of constipation and lumbago amongst other things.

<doc id="990886" wikidata="Q204992" url="?curid=990886" title="Italian lira">
<text>The lira ( , ; : lire, , ) was the currency of Italy between 1861 and 2002. It was introduced by the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy in 1807 at par with the French franc, and was subsequently adopted by the different states that would eventually form the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. It was subdivided into 100 &quot;centesimi&quot; (: &quot;centesimo&quot;), which means &quot;hundredths&quot; or &quot;cents&quot;. The lira was also the currency of the Albanian Kingdom from 1941 to 1943.

The term originates from &quot;libra&quot;, the largest unit of the Carolingian monetary system used in Western Europe and elsewhere from the 8th to the 20th century. The Carolingian system is the origin of the French &quot;livre tournois&quot; (predecessor of the franc), the Italian lira, and the pound unit of sterling and related currencies.

In 1999, the euro became Italy&#x27;s unit of account and the lira became a national subunit of the euro at a rate of €1 = Lit 1,936.27, before being replaced as cash in 2002.

==History==
===Etymology===

The Carolingian monetary system divided the &quot;libra&quot; into 20 &quot;solidi&quot; (: &quot;solidus&quot;) or 240 &quot;denarii&quot; (: &quot;denarius&quot;). These units translate in Italian to &quot;lira&quot;, &quot;soldo&quot; and &quot;denaro&quot;; in French to &quot;livre&quot;, &quot;sou&quot; and &quot;denier&quot;; and in English to pound, shilling and penny.

In France, the &quot;franc&quot; referred to a coin worth one &quot;livre tournois&quot;. This term was also adopted in various Gallo-Italic languages in north-western Italy to refer to the Italian lira.

===Notation and symbols ===
There was no standard sign or abbreviation for the Italian lira. The abbreviations Lit. (standing for &quot;Lira italiana&quot;) and L. (standing for &quot;Lira&quot;) and the signs ₤ or £ were all accepted representations of the currency. Banks and financial institutions, including the Bank of Italy, often used &quot;Lit.&quot; and this was regarded internationally as the abbreviation for the Italian lira. Handwritten documents and signs at market stalls would often use &quot;£&quot; or &quot;₤&quot;, while coins used &quot;L.&quot; Italian postage stamps mostly used the word in full but some (such as the 1975 monuments series) used &quot;L.&quot;

The name of the currency could also be written in full as a prefix or a suffix (e.g. Lire 100,000 or 100,000 lire).

The ISO 4217 currency code for the lira was ITL.

The Unicode CJK Compatibility block includes square versions of currency names in Japanese katakana for compatibility with earlier character sets which would display them in tables or vertical writing.

===Introduction of the lira===

The Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy introduced the Italian lira in 1807 at par with the French franc, worth 4.5 grams of fine silver or 0.29032 gram of fine gold (gold-silver ratio 15.5). Despite the kingdom&#x27;s fall in 1814, this new lira eventually replaced the currencies of the different Italian states until their unification in 1861, replacing, among others:
* The Piedmontese scudo, Sardinian scudo and the Genoese lira after 1800, by the Italian lira;
* The Milanese lira, Venetian lira, Lombardo-Venetian lira and Parman lira after 1814, at the rate of 270 Milanese lire = 45 Milanese scudi = 405 Venetian lire = 855 Parman lire = 207.23 Italian lire;
* The Tuscan fiorino and the Tuscan lira in 1859, at 1 &quot;francescone&quot; = 4 &quot;fiorini&quot; = Tuscan lire = 5.6 Italian lire;
* The piastra of Naples and Sicily in 1861, at 1 &quot;piastra&quot; = 1.2 &quot;ducat di regno&quot; = 5.1 Neapolitan lire, the latter at par with the Italian lira; and
* The scudo of Rome and the Papal States in 1866, at 1 scudo = 5.375 Papal lire, the latter at par with the Italian lira.

In 1865, Italy formed part of the Latin Monetary Union in which the lira was set as equal to, among others, the French, Belgian and Swiss francs. The U.S. dollar was worth approximately 5.18 Italian lire until 1914.

===20th century===
World War I broke the Latin Monetary Union and resulted in prices rising several fold in Italy. Inflation was curbed somewhat by Mussolini, who, on 18 August 1926, announced a new exchange rate between the lira and sterling of £1 = Lit 92.46 (the so-called Quota 90) although the free exchange rate had been closer to Lit 140150 to the pound, causing a temporary deflation and widespread problems in the real economy. In 1927, the lira was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of $1 = Lit 19. This rate lasted until 1934, with a separate &quot;tourist&quot; rate of $1 = Lit 24.89 being established in 1936. In 1939, the &quot;official&quot; rate was Lit 19.80.

After the Allied invasion of Italy, an exchange rate was set at $1 = Lit 120 (£1 = Lit 480) in June 1943, reduced to Lit 100 the following month. In German-occupied areas, the exchange rate was set at = Lit 10. After the war, the value of the lira fluctuated, before Italy set a peg of $1 = Lit 575 within the Bretton Woods System in November 1947. Following the devaluation of the pound, Italy devalued to $1 = Lit 625 on 21 September 1949. This rate was maintained until the end of the Bretton Woods System in the early 1970s. Several episodes of high inflation followed until the introduction of the euro.

===Lira pesante===
Due to the lira&#x27;s low value after the war economic calculations and price displays became unwieldy because of the large number of zeroes. As early as the 1950s suggestions were made to redenominate the lira but no serious efforts were made at that time. In the 1970s a plan known as (English: &quot;hard lira&quot;) or lira nuova (&quot;new lira&quot;) was proposed. The &quot;lira pesante&quot; would have redenominated the currency at 1,000:1, removing 3 zeroes. However the project went dormant for several years before being revived in 1984. Ongoing heavy inflation saw the &quot;lira pesante&quot; pushed back until it was permanently abandoned in 1991 because of plans for a single European currency.

===Introduction of the euro===
The lira was the official unit of currency in Italy until 1 January 1999, when it was replaced by the euro (the lira was officially a national subunit of the euro until the rollout of euro coins and notes in 2002). Old lira denominated currency ceased to be legal tender on 28 February 2002. The conversion rate was Lit 1,936.27 to the euro.

All lira banknotes in use immediately before the introduction of the euro, and all post-World War II coins, were exchanged by the Bank of Italy up to 6 December 2011. Originally, Italy&#x27;s central bank pledged to redeem Italian coins and banknotes until 29 February 2012, but this was brought forward to 6 December 2011.

==Coins==
===Napoleonic lira, 1807–1814===

The Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy issued coins between 1807 and 1813 in denominations of 1 and 3 centesimi and 1 soldo (5 centesimi) in copper, c.10 in 20% silver alloy, s.5, s.10 and s.15 (or c.25, c.50 and c.75 centesimi), 1 lira, 2 lire and 5 lire in 90% silver and 20 lire and 40 lire in 90% gold. All except the c.10 bore a portrait of Napoleon I, with the denominations below 1 lira also showing a radiate crown and the higher denominations, a shield representing the various constituent territories of the Kingdom.

===Between the Restoration and the Risorgimento, 1814–1861===

After the end of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy in 1814, the lira remained present only in the Duchy of Parma and the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia. The lira of Parma was introduced by Duchess Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma, who issued coin denominations of 1, 3, 5, 25, 50 cents and 1, 2, 5, 20 and 40 lire, while gold coins of 10, 50, 80 and 100 lire were also minted from the Piedmont-Sardinia lira introduced by Victor Emmanuel I of Savoy.

===Kingdom of Italy, 1861–1946===

In 1861, coins were minted in Florence, Milan, Naples and Turin in denominations of c.1, c.2, c.5, c.10 and c.50, 1 lira, 2, 5, 10 and 20 lire, with the lowest four in copper, the highest two in gold and the remainder in silver. In 1863, silver coins below 5 lire were debased from 90% to 83.5% and silver c.20 coins were introduced. Minting switched to Rome in the 1870s.

Apart from the introduction in 1894 of cupro-nickel (later nickel) c.20 coins and of nickel c.25 pieces in 1902, the coinage remained essentially unaltered until the First World War.

In 1919, with the purchasing power of the lira reduced to one fifth of that of 1914, the production of all earlier coin types except for the nickel c.20 halted, and smaller, copper c.5 and c.10 and nickel c.50 coins were introduced, followed by nickel 1 lira and 2 lire pieces in 1922 and 1923, respectively. In 1926, silver 5 and 10 lire coins were introduced, equal in size and composition to the earlier 1 lira and 2 lire coins. Silver 20 lire coins were added in 1927.

In 1936, the last substantial issue of silver coins was made, whilst, in 1939, moves to reduce the cost of the coinage led to copper being replaced by aluminium bronze and nickel by stainless steel. All production of coinage halted in 1943.

In 1943 the AM-lira was issued, in circulation in Italy after the landing in Sicily on the night of 9 July 1943. After 1946, the AM-lira ceased to be the currency of employment and was used along with normal notes, until 3 June 1950.

Between 1947 and 1954, zone B of the Free Territory of Trieste used the Triestine lira.

===Italian Republic, 1946–2002===
Coin production resumed slowly in 1946, reaching 1 million minted in 1948, with the purchasing power of the lira reduced to 2% of its value in 1939. Initially, 1 lira, 2, 5 and 10 lire coins were issued in aluminium. These coins were in circulation together with the AM-lire and some of the old, devalued coins of the Italian Kingdom. In 1951, the government replaced all circulating coins and notes with new smaller-sized aluminium 1 lira, 2, 5 and 10 lire (although the 2 lire coin was not minted in 1951 or 1952), and in 1954–1955, Acmonital (stainless steel) 50 and 100 lire coins were introduced, followed by aluminium-bronze 20 lire in 1957 and silver 500 lire in 1958. Increases in the silver bullion price led to the 500 lire coins being produced only in small numbers for collectors after 1967. The 500 lire (and later the 1,000 lire) also appeared in a number of commemorative coin issues, such as the centennial of Italian unification in 1961. Between 1967 and 1982, two types of &quot;paper money&quot; were issued with a value of 500 lire. These were not issued by &quot;Banca d&#x27;Italia&quot;, but directly by the government bearing the title &quot;Repubblica Italiana&quot;.


In 1977, aluminium-bronze 200 lire coins were introduced, followed in 1982 by the bimetallic 500 lire. This was the first bi-metallic coin to be produced for circulation, minted using a system patented by IPZS. It was also the first to feature the value in braille.

Production of 1 lira and 2 lire coins for circulation ceased in 1959; their mintage was restarted from 1982 to 2001 for collectors&#x27; coin sets. Production of the 5 lire coin was greatly reduced in the late 1970s and ceased for circulation in 1998. Similarly, in 1991 the production of 10 and 20 lire coins was limited. The sizes of the 50 and 100 lire coins were reduced in 1990, but then they were completely redesigned in 1993. A bimetallic 1,000 lire coin was introduced in 1997 and stopped in 1998 due to the impending introduction of the euro.

Coins still being minted for circulation at the time of the changeover to euro (in 2000 and 2001 only lire for collectors coins sets were minted) were:
*1 lira (0.05 cents, only for collectors)
*2 lire (0.10 cents, only for collectors)
*5 lire (0.26 cents, only for collectors)
*10 lire (0.52 cents, only for collectors)
*20 lire (1.03 cents, only for collectors)
*50 lire (2.58 cents)
*100 lire (5.16 cents)
*200 lire (10.33 cents)
*500 lire (25.82 cents)
*1,000 lire (51.65 cents)

==Banknotes==
In 1882, the government began issuing low-denomination paper money bearing the title &quot;Biglietto di Stato&quot; (meaning &quot;Ticket of the state&quot;). To begin with, there were 5 lire and 10 lire notes, to which 25 lire notes were occasionally added from 1895. The government also issued notes titled &quot;Buono di Cassa&quot; between 1893 and 1922 in denominations of 1 lira and 2 lire. Production of Biglietti di Stato ceased in 1925 but resumed in 1935 with notes for 1 lira, 2, 5 and 10 lire being introduced by 1939.

The Bank of Italy began producing paper money in 1896. To begin with, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000 lire notes were issued. In 1918–1919, 25 lire notes were also issued but no other denominations were introduced until after the Second World War.

In 1943, the invading Allies introduced notes in denominations of 1 lira, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000 lire. These were followed in 1944 by a series of Biglietti di Stato for 1 lira, 2, 5 and 10 lire, which circulated until replaced by coins in the late 1940s. The Bank of Italy introduced 5,000 and 10,000 lire notes in 1947 and 1948, respectively.

In 1951, the government again issued notes, this time simply bearing the title &quot;Repubblica Italiana&quot;. Denominations were of 50 and 100 lire (replacing the Bank of Italy notes) and they circulated until coins of these denominations were introduced in the mid-1950s. In 1966, 500 lire notes were introduced (again replacing Bank of Italy notes) which were produced until replaced in 1982 by a coin.

50,000 and 100,000 lire notes were introduced by the Bank of Italy in 1967, followed by 2,000 lire notes in 1973, 20,000 lire notes in 1975 and 500,000 lire notes in 1997.

In the mid-1970s, when coinage was in short supply, Italian banks issued &quot;miniassegni&quot; in several low denominations. Technically bearer cheques, they were printed in the form of banknotes and were generally accepted as substitute legal currency.

Notes in circulation when the euro was introduced were:

*1,000 lire, Maria Montessori (€0.516)
*2,000 lire, Guglielmo Marconi (€1.03)
*5,000 lire, Vincenzo Bellini (€2.58)
*10,000 lire, Alessandro Volta (€5.16)
*20,000 lire, Tiziano Vecellio (€10.32) 
*50,000 lire, Gian Lorenzo Bernini (€25.82)
*100,000 lire, Caravaggio (€51.65)
*500,000 lire, Raffaello (€258.23)

==Currencies formerly related to the Italian lira==

===Vatican City===
The Vatican lira (: &quot;lire&quot;) was the official unit of the Vatican City State. It was at par with the Italian lira under the terms on the concordat with Italy. Italian lira notes and coins were legal tender in the Vatican City, and vice versa. Specific Vatican coins were minted in Rome, and were legal tender also in Italy and San Marino.

The Vatican City switched to the euro along with Italy and San Marino. As with old Vatican lira coins, the Vatican City has its own set of euro coins.

===San Marino===
The Sammarinese lira (: &quot;lire&quot;) was the official unit of San Marino. Like the Vatican lira, the Sammarinese lira was at par with the Italian lira.

Italian lira notes and coins were legal tender in San Marino (and vice versa). Specific Sammarinese coins were minted in Rome, and were legal tender in Italy, as well as the Vatican City.

San Marino switched to the euro along with Italy and the Vatican City. As with old Sammarinese lira coins, the country has its own set of euro coins.

===Miniassegni===
Miniassegni (: &quot;miniassegno&quot;) were a type of notgeld that circulated in Italy in the late 1970s in place of change, as in that period small-denomination coins were scarce and were often substituted with candy, stamps, telephone tokens, or even public transport tickets. The first miniassegni appeared in December 1975, and they were subsequently issued by many banks; they had nominal values of 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 and 350 lire.

==Restoration==
In 2005, the Lega Nord launched a campaign to reintroduce the lira as a parallel currency. In 2014, Beppe Grillo, leader of the Five Star Movement, also raised the same point.

<doc id="990893" wikidata="Q5485824" url="?curid=990893" title="Frank Church–River of No Return Wilderness">
<text>The Frank Church—River of No Return Wilderness Area is a protected wilderness area in Idaho. It was created in 1980 by the United States Congress and renamed in 1984 as the &quot;Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area&quot; in honor of U.S. Senator Frank Church.

At , it is the largest contiguous federally managed wilderness in the United States outside of Alaska. The Death Valley Wilderness is the largest single designated area but consists of numerous disconnected units. The wilderness protects several mountain ranges, extensive wildlife, and a popular whitewater rafting river: the Salmon River.

==Description==
Together with the adjacent Gospel Hump Wilderness and surrounding unprotected roadless Forest Service land, it is the core of a 3.3 million acre (13,000 km2) roadless area. It is separated from the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, to the north, by a single dirt road (the Magruder Corridor). The wilderness contains parts of several mountain ranges, including the Salmon River Mountains, the Clearwater Mountains, and the Bighorn Crags. The ranges are split by steep canyons of the Middle and Main forks of the Salmon River. The Salmon River is a popular destination for whitewater rafting, and is known as the &quot;River of No Return&quot; for its swift current and large rapids which make upstream travel difficult. Most of the area is covered by coniferous forests, with dry, open land along the rivers at lower elevations.

While designation as a wilderness area in the United States generally requires the prohibition of any motorized machinery, the use of jetboats (On the Main Fork of the Salmon River) and 26 airstrips are permitted in this wilderness as grandfathered existing uses before the wilderness was designated.

===National forests===
The Frank Church—River of No Return Wilderness is located in six different national forests plus a relatively tiny portion of land of the Bureau of Land Management, more components than any other wilderness. In descending order of acreage they are:
* Payette National Forest (33.45%)
* Challis National Forest (21.78%)
* Salmon National Forest (17.81%) (now administratively combined with Challis NF, so that their total is 39.59%)
* Boise National Forest (14.06%)
* Bitterroot National Forest (8.18%)
* Nez Perce National Forest (4.68%)
* Bureau of Land Management (0.034%)

== History ==
In 1931, 1,090,000 acres (4,400 km2) in Central Idaho were declared by the U.S. Forest Service as The Idaho Primitive Area. In 1963, the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness was split into three parts: The Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, the Salmon River Breaks Primitive area, and the Magruder Corridor—the land between the two areas.

Frank Church was the Senate floor sponsor for the Wilderness Act of 1964, which protected 9 million acres (36,000 km2) of United States land as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. In 1968, he introduced the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which included the Middle Fork of the Salmon River, so that rivers &quot;shall be preserved in free-flowing condition, and that they and their immediate environments shall be protected for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations.&quot;

Church&#x27;s environmental legislation culminated in 1980 with the passage of the Central Idaho Wilderness Act. The act created the River of No Return Wilderness by combining the Idaho Primitive Area, the Salmon River Breaks Primitive Area, and a portion of the Magruder Corridor. The Act also added of the Salmon River to the Wild and Scenic Rivers System. President Carter had taken his family on a three-day float trip down the Middle Fork of the Salmon River in August 1978, accompanied by Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus, the former (and future) Idaho governor. The administration forwarded a central Idaho wilderness proposal to Congress later that year and Carter signed the final act on July 23, 1980. In January 1984, Congress honored Senator Church, who had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, by renaming the area The Frank Church—River of No Return Wilderness. Idaho Senator Jim McClure introduced the measure in the Senate in late February, and President Reagan signed the act on March 14, less than four weeks before Church&#x27;s death on April 7 at age 59.

== Wildlife ==
Because of its size the wilderness area provides a secluded habitat for a wide variety of mammal species, including some rare, vulnerable species. The wilderness is inhabited by a large population of mountain lions and grey wolves. Populations of black bears, as well as lynx, coyote, and red fox are scattered throughout the area. Other observable ruminant wildlife within the wilderness include bighorn sheep, mountain goats, elk, moose, mule deer, and white tail deer. While this area has been deemed as one of the few remaining areas in the contiguous states with suitable habitat for grizzly bears, no established populations are known to exist. The wilderness also offers some of the most critical habitat for wolverines in the lower 48 states. Beavers that were parachuted into the area (Beaver drop) from Idaho (in 1948) have established a healthy colony here.

Wolves once ranged throughout nearly all of Idaho but by 1930 became locally extinct from shooting, trapping and poisoning. After they were nearly wiped out in the lower 48 states, wolves in Idaho were declared endangered in 1974 under the Endangered Species Act. In 1995, wolves from Canada were reintroduced here due to the remote location, the availability of prey and the area being under federal jurisdiction. In the same year, wolves were also released in Yellowstone National Park. By the next year, three packs were identified and the first pups were observed. By 1998, there were at least 10 breeding pairs which was one component of the recovery project. In compliance with a rider attached to a Senate budget bill, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed wolves in Idaho and Montana from the endangered species list in 2011.

==Incidents==
On August 7, 2013, a retired sheriff and three other horseback riders in the rugged back country encountered Hannah Anderson and her abductor, James DiMaggio. FBI agents rescued Anderson and killed DiMaggio near Morehead Lake on August 10.

<doc id="990894" wikidata="Q537348" url="?curid=990894" title="Miombo">
<text>Miombo woodland is a tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome (in the World Wide Fund for Nature scheme) located in central and southern tropical Africa. It includes three woodland savanna ecoregions (listed below) characterized by the dominant presence of &quot;Brachystegia&quot; and &quot;Julbernardia&quot; species of trees, and has a range of climates ranging from humid to semi-arid, and tropical to subtropical or even temperate. The trees characteristically shed their leaves for a short period in the dry season to reduce water loss and produce a flush of new leaves just before the onset of the wet season with rich gold and red colours masking the underlying chlorophyll, reminiscent of autumn colours in the temperate zone.

Miombo woodlands extend across south-central Africa, running from Angola in the west to Tanzania in the east, including parts of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. They are bounded on the north by the humid Congolian forests, on the northeast by Acacia–Commiphora bushland, and on the south by semi-arid woodlands, grasslands, and savannas.

The woodland gets its name from &quot;miombo&quot; (plural, singular &quot;muombo&quot;), the Bemba word for &quot;Brachystegia&quot; species. Other Bantu languages of the region, such as Swahili and Shona, have related if not identical words, such as Swahili &quot;miyombo&quot; (singular &quot;myombo&quot;). These woodlands are dominated by trees of subfamily Detarioideae, particularly miombo (&quot;Brachystegia&quot;), &quot;Julbernardia&quot; and &quot;Isoberlinia&quot;, which are rarely found outside miombo woodlands.

Miombo woodlands can be classified as dry or wet based on the per annum amount and distribution of rainfall. Dry woodlands occur in those areas receiving less than 1000 mm annual rainfall, mostly in Zimbabwe, central Tanzania, eastern and southern Mozambique, Malawi, and southern Zambia. Wet woodlands are those receiving more than 1000 mm annual rainfall, mainly located in northern Zambia, eastern Angola, central Malawi, and western Tanzania. Wet miombo generally has a taller canopy (15 metres or more), more tree cover (60% or more ground cover), and greater species diversity than dry miombo.

==Ecoregions==
Three ecoregions are currently recognized.
*Angolan wet miombo woodlands – Angola
*Central Zambezian wet miombo woodlands – Angola, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia
*Dry miombo woodlands – southeastern Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, central and southern Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The dry miombo woodlands ecoregion includes the Eastern miombo woodlands and Southern miombo woodlands ecoregions previously delineated by the World Wide Fund for Nature.

==Flora and fauna==
Despite the relatively nutrient-poor soil, long dry season, and low rainfall in some areas, the woodland is home to many species, including several endemic bird species. The predominant tree is miombo (&quot;Brachystegia&quot; spp.). It also provides food and cover for mammals such as the African elephant (&quot;Loxodonta africana&quot;), African wild dog (&quot;Lycaon pictus&quot;), sable antelope (&quot;Hippotragus niger&quot;) and Lichtenstein&#x27;s hartebeest (&quot;Sigmoceros lichtensteinii&quot;).

==People==
The miombo woodlands are important to the livelihoods of many rural people who depend on the resources available from the woodland. The wide variety of species provides non-timber products such as fruits, honey, fodder for livestock and fuelwood to various different largely Bantu peoples such as the Bemba people, Lozi people, Yao people, Luvale people, Shona people, and Luba people.

<doc id="990897" wikidata="Q16983525" url="?curid=990897" title="Haweater">
<text>Haweater is a designation given to a person born on Manitoulin Island, Ontario. The name derives from the prevalence of hawberries among the island&#x27;s vegetation. Originally it was reported that early settlers got their vitamin C intake by eating hawberries, and thus avoided scurvy.

A person who has lived on Manitoulin Island, but was not born there, may be considered an honorary haweater.

==Culture==

An annual cultural festival in Little Current is known as Haweater Weekend and takes place on the August Civic Holiday weekend. As well as concerts, sports, and recreational events, this festival is marked by the distribution of Haweater dollars, a community currency, and the production and sale of hawberry-flavoured products such as ice cream and jam.

A Haweater is also a one dollar commemorative coin minted for the island from 1969 to at least 2001. The coins depict various events and locations on the island.

<doc id="990900" wikidata="Q600338" url="?curid=990900" title="Big Huge Games">
<text>Big Huge Games, Inc. is an American video game developer based in Timonium, Maryland since 2000, known first for real-time strategy games such as &quot;Rise of Nations&quot;, later for the console RPG &quot;Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning&quot;, and more recently for mobile games such as &quot;DomiNations&quot; and &quot;Arcane Showdown&quot;. Throughout most of its history the company has been associated with its best-known founder, Brian Reynolds, whose prior career already included work as lead designer of &quot;Civilization II&quot; and &quot;Alpha Centauri&quot;, and co-founder of &quot;Firaxis Games&quot;. The studio&#x27;s ownership has changed hands several times over the years, and it became briefly defunct in May 2012, but it was revived by Reynolds along with several original alumni and new partners. The company is presently owned by Nexon, and actively runs its mobile titles &quot;DomiNations&quot; (released April 2015) and &quot;Arcane Showdown&quot; (released June 2020), while continuing to develop new games.

==History==

The company was incorporated in December 1999 and was first announced in February 2000 by Brian Reynolds along with partners Tim Train, David Inscore, and Jason Coleman. Among the founders, Reynolds principally specialized in game design, Train in production, Inscore in art direction, and Coleman in engineering. Although Brian Reynolds was also a founding member of Firaxis Games, he and the others left Firaxis to found the new company based on their desire to apply the complexity and concepts of the turn-based strategy genre to the real-time strategy genre.

The company&#x27;s first game, a real-time strategy game entitled &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; released in 2003 and became a critical and commercial hit ultimately achieving over 2,000,000 lifetime sales. It received considerable critical acclaim and won awards including GameSpy&#x27;s 2003 Game of the Year for PC-RTS and GameSpot&#x27;s 2003 Best Strategy Game and 2003 Best PC. An expansion pack, &quot;Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots&quot; followed in 2004, along with a &quot;Gold Edition&quot;.

Rise of Nations: Rise of Legends, a second real-time strategy game—this time fantasy and steampunk based, followed in mid-2006. Although this game had a positive critical reception, its sales underperformed, and it became the last full PC RTS from Big Huge Games.

In the year following the release of Rise of Legends, Reynolds took on two smaller projects with parts of the team. The first, &quot;Catan Live&quot;, was an Xbox Live version of Klaus Teuber&#x27;s famous The Settlers of Catan boardgame, with an AI and console interface co-designed by Teuber and Reynolds. The second, &quot;Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties&quot; was an expansion pack for Microsoft&#x27;s famous real-time strategy game.

Meanwhile, for its next large project, Big Huge Games turned to roleplaying games and another famous videogame designer. In February 2007, the company announced that Ken Rolston, the lead designer of &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot; and &quot;The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&quot;, had come out of retirement to join the company as lead designer on an untitled role playing game (RPG). Later that May it was announced that THQ would publish the title in 2009. This marked the first title from Big Huge Games that was not distributed by Microsoft.

===Acquisition by THQ===
On January 15, 2008, THQ acquired the developer.

On July 30, 2008, Grant Kirkhope joined the Big Huge Games team as an audio director. He had previously worked for Rare, composing for the &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; and &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; games (among others).

On March 18, 2009, during the height of that year&#x27;s Great Recession, THQ announced that due to declining economic conditions, it would close Big Huge Games unless an outside buyer could be found in the next 60 days. As fate would have it, a buyer was found and the studio remained open, while THQ itself went on to file for bankruptcy in December 2012.

===Acquisition by 38 Studios===
On May 27, 2009, 38 Studios announced that they were acquiring Big Huge Games and retaining 70 employees out of approximately 120 who were at THQ.

From mid-2009 to January 2012, Big Huge Games developed a single player role playing game titled &quot;Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning&quot;, which was released in early February 2012 and published by Electronic Arts (EA) and 38 Studios for Xbox 360, PS3 and PC. The game is set in a fantasy world created with input from R A Salvatore and Todd McFarlane.

It was reported on May 24, 2012 that the studio and their parent company 38 Studios had laid off their entire staff.

===Formation of Epic Baltimore===
Briefly, it appeared that the remaining Big Huge Games development team had found backing to keep the studio, or some part of the studio, running. In June 2012, Epic Games announced the opening of a new studio in Baltimore called Epic Baltimore. The studio consisted of a significant portion of ex-Big Huge developers. The nascent studio was later renamed Impossible Studios, but the reboot effort was ultimately short-lived and Impossible Studios officially closed on February 8, 2013.

===Revival by Reynolds and Train===
In October 2013, it was revealed that Reynolds and Train had revived Big Huge Games, having reacquired the trademark at auction from the state of Rhode Island, which owned it following the bankruptcy of 38 Studios. This name was given to their new venture founded in 2013, which was formerly briefly known as SecretNewCo. In addition to Reynolds and Train, the new owners included Bryant Freitag and Dan Halka, both Big Huge Games alumni, and Vinh Trinh who had worked with Reynolds during his time as Chief Game Designer at Zynga, where Reynolds had spent much of the 2009–2013 years. More hires soon followed including many more alumni, and the new studio developed a mobile strategy game for tablets and smartphones called &quot;DomiNations&quot;, for release on iOS and Android. It is published by Nexon&#x27;s mobile gaming group. and was released for Android and iOS in April 2015.

The game experienced major success; as of March 2016, it had been downloaded over 19 million times, and Big Huge Games actively continues to run the game and develop features for it as recently as summer 2020.

===Acquisition by Nexon===
In the wake of DomiNation&#x27;s successful launch, Nexon announced on March 9, 2016 that it had acquired Big Huge Games; the studio would continue to produce new titles and maintain &quot;DomiNations&quot;.

&quot;Arcane Showdown&quot;, the next major game from the studio, was released in summer 2020 on mobile platforms and Steam. It was shut down on May 29, 2021.

==Game engine==
Throughout its first decade, Big Huge Games made extensive use of its internally developed game engine, the Big Huge Engine, in both &quot;Rise of Nations&quot; and &quot;Catan&quot;. The engine features support for a variety of applications and technologies, including physics, artificial intelligence, animation, and others.

At the time of their move from THQ to 38 Studios, Big Huge Games was working on two large game projects, which were then canceled.

<doc id="990901" wikidata="Q5073039" url="?curid=990901" title="Chapel Market">
<text>Chapel Market is a daily street market in London. The market is located on a street of the same name near Angel, and sells fruit, vegetables and fish, as well as bargain household goods and cheap clothes. It is open every day except Monday, operating in the mornings only on Thursday and Sunday. The market is 2-3 blocks long; many of the patrons are local, and food and wares for sale are primarily for daily use. It has capacity for 224 stalls.

The ten-year-old Islington Farmers&#x27; Market relocated to Chapel Market in April 2010 and is held every Sunday at the Penton Street end.

Notable Chapel Market pubs include the Agricultural at the extreme east end, an old institution that got its name from the historic use of Upper Street as a livestock route south into London and specifically to Smithfield meat market. The Hundred Crows Flying, at the extreme west end of the market is a modern style pub catering more to a hip young crowd. In the middle of the market near to the corner of White Lion Street is The Alma Lounge, popular with an older crowd, and frequently full early in the day.

The street was also notable for M.Manze, a traditional Pie and Mash vendor whose first branch was established in 1902. The Chapel Market branch closed down in 2019.

The street was also used for filming street seller scenes in the TV sitcom Only Fools and Horses.

In April 2024, it was reported that traders were worried that the market was at risk of &quot;slowly dying&quot; due to a lack of shoppers.

<text>The Papua New Guinea national rugby league team represents Papua New Guinea in the sport of rugby league football.

In Papua New Guinea, Rugby League is a highly popular sport and is regarded as the country&#x27;s national sport. The national side are known as the Kumuls (&quot;birds-of-paradise&quot; in Tok Pisin).

==History==

Rugby league in Papua New Guinea was first played in the late forties; it was introduced to the nation by Australian soldiers stationed there during and after the Second World War. Papua New Guinea were admitted to the game&#x27;s International Federation in 1974. On 6 July 1975, at Lloyd Robson Oval, in Port Moresby the Kumuls played their first ever international. They were beaten 40-12 by England. The English team were en route to Australia and New Zealand to fulfil away fixtures during the 1975 World Cup.

They first entered the Rugby League World Cup for the 1985-88 competition, though it was not until 2000 that they won away from home. In 1987 The Kumuls staged their first full test playing tour of Britain, after playing BARLA opposition in 1979. The 1987 Tour had The Kumuls play both BARLA and for the first Professional opposition.

On Tuesday 20 October 1987, Cumbria met Papua New Guinea before a crowd of 3,750 at the Recreation Ground, Whitehaven. Cumbria won 22–4. Four days later Papua New Guinea played a Test which was also a World Cup match against Great Britain. They lost the test 42–0 at Central Park, Wigan.

During the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia a Test match was played at Port Moresby which like the match at Wigan in 1987 was a World Cup match. Which they also lost 42-22. Later that year Papua New Guinea played a World Cup match against Australia in Wagga Wagga, the Kangaroos recording a then international record winning margin of 62 points with a 70–8 win. Australian winger Michael O&#x27;Connor crossed for four tries and kicked seven goals for a personal points haul of 30, which could have been 44 had he not missed seven kicks at goal. In 1990 Papua New Guinea played host to a touring Great Britain, the series ended in a 1–1 draw.

On Sunday 27 October 1991, Papua New Guinea met Wales at Vetch Field, Swansea. Roared on by a fervent crowd of 11,422; Wales won by a record 68-0 margin, scoring thirteen tries. Papua New Guinea never recovered and lost all five matches in Britain, conceding 232 points in the process, and won only one of their four matches in France.

Papua New Guinea wound up their 1991 tour of Europe with a World Cup rated Test match against France, which was played on Sunday 24 November at the Stade Albert Domec, Carcassonne. Despite Papua New Guinea leading 8–4 at half-time; France defeated their visitors 28–14.

The Kumuls hosted Australia for a two test series in October 1991 (won 2-0 by the Kangaroos), and also hosted Great Britain during the 1992 Lions tour of Australasia.

Papua New Guinea travelled to England to compete in the 1995 World Cup under coach Joe Tokam and captain Adrian Lam. In their group was Tonga and New Zealand, against whom they failed to win a match.

In 1996 Bob Bennett, brother of the famous Wayne Bennett, was appointed the Kumuls&#x27; coach. Also, in 1996, Adrian Lam captained the &#x27;Papua New Guinea National Rugby League Team&#x27; against the Australian Kangaroos (52-6 win to Australia).
Bob Bennett coached the 2000 World Cup Kumuls team to the qualification two the pool were the kumuls made it into the top 4 teams in the world so the 2000 World Cup Kumuls team was rated the best kumuls team.

They were granted automatic qualification to the 2008 World Cup but were placed in a pool with the top three teams, Australia, New Zealand and England, and failed to win a match in the tournament.

PNG automatically qualified for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup having reached the quarter-finals of the previous Rugby League World Cup. The 2021 tournament will take place in England.

===2010 controversy===
The Papua New Guinea team experienced huge difficulties leading to the 2010 Rugby League Four Nations Tournament, as politicians clashed for control over the game and the governing body, the PNGRFL, was split over issues concerning junior development, the national team and the Papua New Guinea NRL bid. This caused Adrian Lam to retire as head coach of the Kumuls in September 2010 while recently retired captain Stanley Gene, who had never coached a side before, was named his replacement. The governing board were adamant that more Papua New Guinea-based players should be in the squad, and fewer Australia-based players should be picked. In early October the squad was announced for the tournament and consisted of 12 PNG-based players with captain Paul Aiton being the only NRL player. Whilst the Australian team for the tournament was worth an estimated A$10 million, local newspapers calculated the Kumuls value at around A$670,000.

Despite the Australian media treating the defeat of the Papua New Guinean team as a mere formality, with the team having odds of 125–1 to win the tournament, the players and journalists at home were positive that the Kumuls could make a lasting impression in the tournament. After their first up 42–0 defeat against Australia, the team&#x27;s enthusiasm and crunching tackles were praised, but ball control and creativity let the team down hugely. However the team faced much more criticism after their 76-12 thrashing suffered at the hands of New Zealand, with fans angry at the poor display from the players and some questioning the credentials of new coach Stanley Gene. Days after the match a broader look at the sport in the country occurred with one assessment concluding that rugby league was poorly managed and former PNG great Marcus Bai called on clubs to supply a greater number of representative standard players especially from the New Guinea Islands region which had supplied five of this year&#x27;s team. The way politics had made its way into the governing of the sport was also condemned.

===2015 Pacific Rugby League Test===

In May 2015, Papua New Guinea took on Fiji in the 2015 Melanesian Cup at Cbus Super Stadium. The International was part of a triple header which also included the Polynesian Cup, between Samoa and Tonga, and the Junior Kangaroos against the Junior Kiwis. The Kumuls never really troubled the Fijians after handling errors and poor decisions led to the Bati easily winning the inaugural Melanesian Cup by 22–10.

===2016 Pacific Rugby League Test===

In May 2016, Papua New Guinea took on Fiji in the 2016 Melanesian Cup at Pirtek Stadium. The International was part of a triple header which also included the Polynesian Cup, between Samoa and Tonga, and the Junior Kangaroos against the Junior Kiwis. In this year&#x27;s test, the Kumuls had more experienced players and it paid off. Despite being in a similar situation with the half time score, they managed to make a miraculous comeback not many saw coming, to record their first win 24–22 on away shores since the 2000 World Cup.

===2017 Pacific Rugby League Test===
The PNG Kumuls won their second consecutive Pacific Cup test victory with a 32–22 victory over the Cook Islands at Campbelltown Stadium in Sydney, Australia.

===2017 Rugby League World Cup===
The PNG Kumuls won all their pool games in Port Moresby before losing to England in Melbourne in the quarter-final of the 2017 RLWC.

===2018 Pacific Rugby League Test===
The PNG Kumuls won their third consecutive Ox &amp; Palm Pacific Cup test victory with a 26–14 victory over Fiji Bati at Campbelltown Stadium in Sydney, Australia.

===2019 Oceania Cup and GB Lions Tour===
The PNG Kumuls lost both their 2019 Oceania Cup (rugby league) test matches with a 24–6 loss to Toa Samoa at Leichhardt Oval in Sydney, Australia and a 22–20 loss to Fiji Bati in Christchurch, New Zealand . The Kumuls ended the season on a high defeating the Great Britain Lions 28–10 in Port Moresby.

===2022 Pacific Rugby League Test===
The Kumuls defeated a full strength Fiji Bati 24-14 on June 25 at Campbelltown Stadium.

===2022 Rugby League World Cup===
The PNG Kumuls were based in Warrington for the 2021 RLWC. The World Cup will be held between October 15 and November 19. Kumuls coach Stanley Tepend was guided by his mentor/ Coaching Director Shane Flanagan. The PM&#x27;s XIII lost to Australia PM&#x27;s XIII on September 25 at Suncorp Stadium as part of both teams world cup preparations. The Kumuls bowed out in the quarterfinals after losing to hosts, England.

<text>Brachystegia is a genus of tree of the subfamily Detarioideae that is native to tropical Africa.

Trees of the genus are commonly known as miombo, and are dominant in the miombo woodlands of central and southern tropical Africa. The Zambezian region is the centre of diversity for the genus.

==Description==
Hybridisation between the species occurs and taxa show considerable variation in leaflet size, shape and number, making identification difficult.

New leaves show a great range of red colours when immature, later turning to various shades of green.

==Range and habitat==
&quot;Brachystegia&quot; species range from coastal West Africa through Nigeria and Central Africa to the Northern Province of South Africa.

Habitats include seasonally dry forest, woodland, wooded grassland and bushland, and lowland tropical rain forest, often along rivers, the margins of wetlands, and on upland plateaus. Some species form monodominant stands.

18 species are native to Zambezian woodland. Six grow in Guineo–Congolian forest, with six in west-central Africa and 1 in West Africa. One species grows in the Zanzibar–Inhambane coastal forests of eastern Mozambique.

<text>Giulio Cesare la Galla (or Julius Cæsar Lagalla or Giulio Cesare Lagalla) (1571–1624) was a professor of philosophy at the Collegio Romano in Italy.

== Biography ==
He was born in Padula, at that time part of the Kingdom of Naples. Lagalla was educated in philosophy and medicine. He became the official physician of the papal galleys for a period, then came to Rome to lecture in natural philosophy at the Collegio Romano. He apparently became the leading peripatetic of the city, and was counted among the opponents of the Copernican heliocentric theory.

Following Galileo’s observations of the Moon by means of a telescope, published in &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot;, Lagalla published a booklet in response. He participated in the demonstrations of the instrument by Galileo and was not among those who doubted the ability of the instrument. But he did debate Galileo&#x27;s three-dimensional representation of the Moon based on two-dimensional visual observations.

In his book &quot;De Phenomenis in Orbe Lunae&quot; (published in Venice in 1612) he claimed that the untreated stone (known as &quot;lapis solaris&quot; and shown to him by Galileo Galilei) was unable to give off light only after calcination. We now know that the &quot;Bolognian Stone&quot; was a piece of barite (barium sulphate).

The crater Lagalla on the Moon is named after him.

<doc id="990923" wikidata="Q657967" url="?curid=990923" title="Second Barons' War">
<text>The Second Barons&#x27; War (1264–1267) was a civil war in England between the forces of barons led by Simon de Montfort against the royalist forces of King Henry III, led initially by the king himself and later by his son, the future King Edward I. The barons sought to force the king to rule with a council of barons, rather than through his favourites. The war also involved a series of massacres of Jews by de Montfort&#x27;s supporters, including his sons Henry and Simon, in attacks aimed at seizing and destroying evidence of baronial debts. To bolster the initial success of his baronial regime, de Montfort sought to broaden the social foundations of parliament by extending the franchise to the commons for the first time. However, after a rule of just over a year, de Montfort was killed by forces loyal to the king at the Battle of Evesham.

==Causes==
The reign of Henry III is most remembered for the constitutional crisis in this period of civil strife, which was provoked ostensibly by his demands for extra finances, but marked a more general dissatisfaction with Henry&#x27;s methods of government on the part of the English barons, discontent which was exacerbated by widespread famine.

The French-born Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, had originally been one of the foreign upstarts so loathed by many lords as Henry&#x27;s &quot;foreign councillors&quot;. However, having inherited through his mother the English title Earl of Leicester, he married Henry&#x27;s sister Eleanor with Henry&#x27;s permission, but without the agreement of the English barons (ordinarily necessary since it was a matter of state). As a result, a feud developed between de Montfort and Henry. Their relationship reached a crisis in the 1250s, when de Montfort was put on trial for actions he took as lieutenant of Gascony, the last remaining Plantagenet lands across the English Channel.

During the reigns of John and Henry III, the Crown periodically raised punitive taxation on the Jews, causing moneylenders to sell their debt bonds cheaply to raise cash to pay their taxes. The bonds were sold to the richest courtiers and supporters of the Crown at cut down prices, leading many indebted middling landowners to lose their lands. This fed into rising anti-Semitic beliefs that were fuelled by the church. Measures against the Jews and controls over debts and usury dominated debates about royal power and finances among the classes that were beginning to be involved in Parliament, and supported de Montfort in the war.

De Montfort took advantage of the resulting rising antisemitism for his own benefit. The alleged murder of Hugh of Lincoln by Jews had led to the hanging of 18 Jews. Official anti-Jewish measures, sponsored by the Catholic Church, combined with resentment about debts among the barons gave an opportunity for de Montfort to target this group and incite rebellion by calling for the cancellation of debts owed to Jews.

Henry also became embroiled in funding a war against the Hohenstaufen, on behalf of Pope Innocent IV, in return for the Hohenstaufen Kingdom of Sicily for his second son Edmund. That made many barons fearful that Henry was following in the footsteps of his father King John and needed to be kept in check like John. When Henry&#x27;s treasury ran dry, Innocent withdrew the title, and by bestowing it to Charles of Anjou, in effect negated the sale.

Simon de Montfort became leader of those who wanted to reassert Magna Carta and force the king to surrender more power to the baronial council. In 1258, initiating the move toward reform, seven leading barons forced Henry to agree to the Provisions of Oxford, which effectively abolished the absolutist Anglo-Norman monarchy, giving power to a council of twenty-four barons to deal with the business of government, and providing for a great council in the form of a parliament every three years, to monitor their performance. Henry was forced to take part in the swearing of a collective oath to uphold the Provisions.

Seeking to restore his position, Henry in 1259 purchased the support of King Louis IX of France by the Treaty of Paris, agreeing to accept the loss of the lands in France that had been seized from him and from his father King John by Louis and his predecessors since 1202, and to do homage for those that remained in his hands. In 1261, Henry obtained a papal bull releasing him from his oath, and set about reasserting his control of government. The baronial opposition responded by summoning their own Parliament and contesting control of local government, but with civil war looming they backed down and de Montfort fled to France, while the other key opposition leader, Richard de Clare, Earl of Hertford and Gloucester, switched over to the King&#x27;s side. 

Under the Treaty of Kingston, an arbitration system was agreed upon to resolve outstanding disputes between Henry and the barons, with de Clare as the initial arbiter and the option of appealing his verdicts to Louis IX. However, continued Poitevin influence and the failures and renewal of provocative policies by Henry&#x27;s government soon inflamed hostility once more. The King&#x27;s position was further weakened by the death of Richard de Clare and the succession of his son Gilbert, who sided with the opposition, and by the reversal of the papal annulment of his oath to uphold the Provisions.

In April 1263, Simon de Montfort returned to England and gathered a council of dissident barons at Oxford. Fighting broke out in the Welsh Marches, and by the autumn, both sides had raised considerable armies. De Montfort marched on London and the city rose in revolt, trapping the King and Queen at the Tower of London. They were taken prisoner and de Montfort assumed effective control of government in Henry&#x27;s name. However, his support soon fractured, and Henry regained his liberty. 

With violent disorder spreading and the prospect of all-out war, Henry appealed to Louis for arbitration, and, after initial resistance, de Montfort consented. In January 1264, by the Mise of Amiens, Louis declared in Henry&#x27;s favour by annulling the Provisions of Oxford. Some of the barons who had opposed Henry acquiesced in the verdict, but a more radical faction led by de Montfort prepared to resist any reassertion of royal power, and they and the king gathered their forces for war.

==Course of the war==
Fighting resumed in February 1264, with attacks by Simon de Montfort&#x27;s sons Henry and Simon the Younger on royalist supporters in the Welsh Borders. Cancellation of debts (owed to Jews) was part of de Montfort&#x27;s call to arms.

A series of attacks on Jewish communities followed, organised by key allies of de Montfort, hoping to gain by destroying the records of their debts to moneylenders. These pogroms killed the majority of Jews in Worcester, in this case led by de Montfort&#x27;s son Henry and Robert Earl Ferrers.

At London, one of his key followers, John fitz John, led the attack and is said to have killed leading Jewish figures Isaac fil Aaron and Cok fil Abraham with his bare hands. He allegedly shared the loot with de Montfort. Five hundred Jews died. Attacks occurred in Winchester, led by the younger Simon de Montfort. Anti-Jewish violence spread to Lincoln and Cambridge, Jewish communities were also targeted at Canterbury, led by Gilbert de Clare, and Northampton.

In April, the elder Simon de Montfort, in control of London, assembled his forces at St Albans and marched to relieve Northampton, which was under siege by the royalists, but he was too late to prevent the town&#x27;s capture by betrayal. He then moved into Kent and laid siege to the royal stronghold of Rochester Castle, but on hearing reports of a royal advance on London he withdrew most of his forces from the siege to confront this threat. King Henry, however, bypassed the capital and the rebel army and raised the siege of Rochester, before he captured Tonbridge and Winchelsea from the rebels.

Moving into Sussex, Henry was confronted by de Montfort, who had led his army out from London in pursuit. In the Battle of Lewes on 14 May, Henry was defeated and taken prisoner by de Montfort, along with his son Prince Edward and his brother, Richard of Cornwall. While Henry was reduced to a figurehead king, de Montfort broadened parliamentary representation to include groups beyond the nobility, members from each county of England and many important towns. Henry and his son Edward remained effective prisoners. Around this time, de Montfort announced the cancellation of all debt owed to Jews.

The radicalism of de Montfort&#x27;s subversion of traditional order once again led to a fracturing of his brittle base of support.

In May 1265, Prince Edward escaped from de Montfort&#x27;s custody at Hereford and assembled a new royalist army at Worcester. He attracted defectors from the baronial cause, most importantly Gilbert de Clare, de Montfort&#x27;s most powerful ally. Simon was blocked from moving east from Hereford by royalist control of the crossings of the River Severn, completed by Edward&#x27;s capture of Gloucester. Moving into Wales, de Montfort forged an alliance with the Welsh Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who provided him with soldiers. An attempt by Simon to ship his forces across the Severn estuary from Newport was thwarted when his transports were destroyed by royalist warships, and he returned to Hereford.

De Montfort&#x27;s goal now became to unite with the forces of his son Simon the Younger, and engage with the royal army, but the younger Simon moved much too slowly westwards from London. Eventually, Simon the Younger reached the baronial stronghold of Kenilworth, but Edward managed to inflict great losses on his forces, many of whom were quartered outside the castle walls. The elder Simon had taken advantage of Edward&#x27;s move to Kenilworth to cross the Severn at Kempsey and was on his way to join his son when he was intercepted and decisively defeated by the royalists at the Battle of Evesham on 4 August. Simon and his son Henry were killed in the fighting, and King Henry, whom de Montfort had taken into battle with him, was freed.

The victory at Evesham left the royalists in a dominant position, but the rebels continued to defend their strongholds, most notably Kenilworth. Prince Edward began a Siege of Kenilworth on 21st June, 1266, which dragged on for months. King Henry was persuaded to seek a compromise settlement, and a commission of bishops and barons drafted a proclamation, known as the Dictum of Kenilworth, issued on 31 October. It set terms under which rebels could secure a pardon and regain their confiscated lands on the payment of a heavy fine. The proposal was initially rejected by the rebels, but on 14 December, hunger finally compelled the defenders of Kenilworth to surrender and to accept the terms of the Dictum. 

In April 1267, Gilbert de Clare turned again to revolt and occupied London. He was reconciled with Henry by a negotiated settlement in June, which eased the terms of the Dictum, enabling repentant rebels to regain their lands before rather than after paying their fines. That summer also saw the negotiated surrender of the last group of defiant rebels, who had been holding out in The Fens at the Isle of Ely. The total casualties of the war are estimated at 15,000.

<doc id="990926" wikidata="Q1133421" url="?curid=990926" title="Endymion (crater)">
<text>Endymion is a lunar impact crater that lies near the northeast limb of the Moon. It is located to the east of Mare Frigoris and north of Lacus Temporis. To the southwest is the somewhat smaller crater Atlas. Because of its location, Endymion has an oval appearance from foreshortening. Beyond the crater along the lunar limb is the Mare Humboldtianum.

The floor of Endymion has been covered in low-albedo lava that gives it a dark appearance and makes it relatively easy to locate. The floor is relatively smooth, with only a few craterlets located within the rim. A string of three lies near the northwestern inner wall. There is a wrinkle ridge crossing the crater floor, and near the center is a low, eroded hill that may be the summit of a central peak that is now almost completely submerged by lava. Faint streaks of ray material from Thales to the north-northwest cross the dark floor. The outer is low, wide, and worn from impact erosion.

Endymion is one of the largest craters of Nectarian age.

The name Endymion was formally recognized by the IAU in 1935.

==Satellite craters==
By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Endymion.

<doc id="990928" wikidata="Q1321249" url="?curid=990928" title="Final Fight 2">
<text>is a 1993 beat &#x27;em up game released by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the direct sequel to the 1989 coin-operated arcade game &quot;Final Fight&quot;, which was previously also released for the SNES. &quot;Final Fight 2&quot; was developed by Capcom″s consumer division with no preceding coin-op version. The game was re-released onto Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service in 2009 worldwide.

Unlike the SNES version of the first game, &quot;Final Fight 2&quot; supports two-player simultaneous play and has a total of three playable characters. The only playable character from the first game to return is Mike Haggar. Two new player characters were introduced: Carlos Miyamoto and Maki Genryusai. In the game&#x27;s plot, the three battle the resurgent Mad Gear gang at various locations around Asia and Europe to rescue Maki&#x27;s sister and father, who are also the fiancée and teacher respectively of Guy from the first &quot;Final Fight.&quot;

Capcom followed up the game with another SNES-exclusive sequel, &quot;Final Fight 3&quot;, which saw the return of Guy to the series. None of the new characters from &quot;Final Fight 2&quot; returned, although Maki made appearances in various Capcom fighting games years later.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Final Fight 2&quot; does not deviate much from the original &quot;Final Fight&quot; in terms of gameplay, although unlike the SNES version of the first game (and the alternate version &quot;Final Fight Guy&quot;), &quot;Final Fight 2&quot; features a two-player cooperative mode in addition to the single-player mode. The player has a choice between three characters: Haggar, who uses professional wrestling techniques; Maki, a female master of the fictional ninjutsu school of Bushin-ryū Ninpō, similar to Guy from the first game; and Carlos, a South American martial artist of Japanese descent who uses a sword for his Special Move. Through use of a code, two players can select the same character. Like in the original game, each character has their own set of fighting techniques and abilities unique to each character.

The gameplay remains the same as in the original game. The player has two main action buttons (Attack and Jump), which when pressed together, makes the player&#x27;s character perform their Special Move (a third button can also be assigned for this purpose). The player proceed through levels fighting against hordes of underlings before reaching a boss character at the end of each stage. Health-restoring food items and other bonus point items are hidden away in breakable drums and barrels. There are also three retrievable weapons in the game, a tonfa, a piece of lumber and a knife. There is also a &quot;Genryusai Doll&quot; which makes the player invulnerable for a limited period and a &quot;Guy Doll&quot; which gives the player an extra life.

There is a total of six stages in the game, each set in a distinct Eurasian location: Hong Kong, France, Holland, England, Italy and Japan. As in the original game, the player will be pitted against numerous types of recurring enemy characters thorough the game. The only returning enemy characters from the original SNES game are the Andore family. Rolento, a boss character who was in the first &quot;Final Fight&quot; but omitted from the SNES port, appears as a boss character in this game (with his name spelled &quot;Rolent&quot;).

The player can adjust the difficulty (along with other settings) of the game in the options menu. Like in &quot;Final Fight Guy&quot;, each difficulty setting reveals only a certain portion of the ending, with the full ending being shown only by completing the game on the Expert setting.

The Japanese version of &quot;Final Fight 2&quot; features two enemy characters named Mary and Eliza, who are knife-wielding female enemies with acrobatic techniques. Mary and Eliza were replaced by two substitute characters named Leon and Robert in the international versions of the game. Additionally, the first stage boss Won Won, wields a meat cleaver in the Japanese version, which was also removed in the overseas versions.

After the death of Belger and the defeat of the Mad Gear Gang, the trio of Mike Haggar, Cody, and Guy, who were celebrated as the heroes of Metro City by the citizens had returned to their normal lives; Cody goes on vacation with his girlfriend Jessica, Guy departs on a training journey, and Haggar continues to run Metro City as Mayor. However, the surviving Mad Gear members have secretly regrouped under a new leader and seek their revenge against the trio. They begin by kidnapping Guy&#x27;s fiancée Rena in Japan, along with her father, Guy&#x27;s former sensei Genryusai.

Rena&#x27;s younger sister, Maki Genryusai, calls Haggar and informs him of the situation. Accompanied by his friend Carlos Miyamoto, Haggar travels to Eurasia and meets up with Maki, and the three of them join forces to take on the newly revived Mad Gear. After a series of fights in several countries, the trail leads to Japan where they fight Retu, the new leader of the Mad Gear. The three defeat Retu and rescue Genryusai and Rena. Guy then writes a letter to his friends from abroad thanking them for all they have done.

==Reception==
In Japan, the game topped the &quot;Famitsu&quot; sales charts in May 1993. Worldwide, the game sold over one million copies.

Power Unlimited gave the game a score of 75% writing: &quot;Final Fight 2 is such a kind of game that is actually no longer made these days. The number of moves is very limited, just like the number of different enemies and levels. So you get through it quickly.&quot; Super Gamer gave an overall review score of 79% summarizing: &quot;Simultaneous two-player and great sprite graphics. Unfortunately, gameplay is dated with just one attack move.&quot;

Lucas M. Thomas of IGN, in the review of the 2009 Virtual Console release, called it &quot;decent brawler experience&quot; even as &quot;pretty straightforward&quot; and &quot;a bit bland&quot;, although wondering why Guy was not included when his fiancée was kidnapped in the story. 

Nevertheless, the staff of GamesRadar ranked it as the 31st best SNES game: &quot;We were afraid the sequel might see similar limitations, but this one was built from the ground up for Nintendo’s super console, so everything we’d want from an arcade &quot;Final Fight 2&quot; made its way to the cartridge. This was the &quot;Final Fight&quot; we always wanted.&quot; In 2018, Complex listed it 76th on their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot; saying the game is better than its predecessor in every way.

<text>George Norman Douglas (8 December 1868 – 7 February 1952) was a British writer, now best known for his 1917 novel &quot;South Wind&quot;. His travel books, such as &quot;Old Calabria&quot; (1915), were also appreciated for the quality of their writing.

==Life==
Norman Douglas was born in Thüringen, Austria (his surname was registered at birth as &quot;Douglass&quot;). His mother was the German aristocrat, Vanda von Poellnitz. His father was John Sholto Douglas (1838–1874), manager of a cotton mill. Douglas&#x27;s paternal grandfather was the 14th Laird of Tilquhillie. Douglas&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather was General James Ochoncar Forbes, 17th Lord Forbes.

Douglas&#x27;s father died in a mountaineering incident and his mother immediately married a housepainter; Douglas never mentioned the remarriage in any of his writings. Douglas spent the first years of his life on the family estate, Villa Falkenhorst, in Thüringen.

Douglas was brought up mainly at Tilquhillie, Deeside, his paternal home in Scotland. He was educated at Yarlet Hall and Uppingham School in England, and then at a Gymnasium in Karlsruhe. He was fluent in German and English during his youth and later learnt French and Italian. Douglas developed an interest in natural science as a child and began contributing articles to papers about zoology at the age of 18.

Douglas started in the diplomatic service in 1894 and from then until 1896 was based in St. Petersburg. He was placed on leave after an alleged affair. In 1897 he bought a villa (Villa Maya) in Posillipo, a maritime suburb of Naples. The next year he married a cousin, Elizabeth Louisa Theobaldina FitzGibbon (their mothers were sisters, daughters of Baron Ernst von Poellnitz). They had two children, Louis Archibald (Archie) and Robert Sholto (Robin), and Norman&#x27;s first published book, &quot;Unprofessional Tales&quot; (1901), was written in collaboration with Elizabeth and first appeared under the pseudonym &quot;Normyx&quot;. However, the couple was divorced in 1903 because of Elizabeth&#x27;s infidelity.

Douglas then moved to Capri, began dividing his time between the Villa Daphne there and London, and became a more committed writer. Nepenthe, the fictional island setting of his novel &quot;South Wind&quot; (1917), is Capri in light disguise. His friends on the island included the opium addict Jacques d&#x27;Adelswärd-Fersen.

From 1912 to 1916 Douglas worked for &quot;The English Review&quot;. He met D. H. Lawrence through this connection.

Douglas&#x27;s novel &quot;They Went&quot; (1920) is a fantasy based on Breton folklore.

D. H. Lawrence based a character in his novel &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Rod&quot; (1922) on Douglas, which, according to Richard Aldington, led to a falling out between the two writers. Douglas and Lawrence continued the feud through their responses to the memoirs of the American author Maurice Magnus.

In the book &quot;Twentieth Century Authors&quot; Douglas stated that he disliked Marxism, Puritanism and &quot;all kinds of set forms, including official Christianity&quot;.

During Douglas&#x27;s years in Florence he was associated with the publisher and bookseller Pino Orioli, who published a number of Douglas&#x27;s books and works by other English authors in his Lungarno series. Many of these books, notably the first edition of Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;, would have been prosecuted for obscenity if they had been published in London. Douglas probably had a major hand in writing Orioli&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Adventures of a Bookseller&quot;. 

Further scandals led Douglas to leave Italy for the South of France in 1937. Following the collapse of France in 1940 Douglas left the Riviera and made a circuitous journey to London, where he lived from 1942 to 1946. He published the first edition of his &quot;Almanac&quot; in a tiny edition in Lisbon. He returned to Capri in 1946 and was made a citizen of the island. His circle of acquaintances included the writer Graham Greene, the composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji and the food writer Elizabeth David.

Douglas died in Capri, apparently after deliberately overdosing himself on drugs after a long illness (see Elisabeth Moor, &quot;An Impossible Woman: The Memories of Dottoressa Moor of Capri&quot;). As he was lay dying, he was approached by German nuns who offered assistance and his last words are reputed to have been: &quot;Get those fucking nuns away from me.&quot; The Latin inscription on his tombstone, from an ode by Horace, reads: &quot;Omnes eodem cogimur&quot;, &quot;We are all driven to the same end&quot;.

== Sexual assault allegations ==
In 1916, Douglas was charged with an offence against a 16-year-old boy at his home. In 1917, he was also charged with the indecent assault of two boys (one being Esmond Knight) but the case was dropped after Douglas provided an alibi.

Douglas was granted bail and fled the country for Capri, Italy. He was also forced to flee Florence in 1937 following allegations that he raped a 10-year-old girl.

==Reception==
H. M. Tomlinson, a contemporary of Douglas&#x27;s, concluded his 1931 biography by saying that Douglas&#x27;s kind of prose &quot;is at present out of fashion&quot;. He found his writing &quot;at times as ruthless in its irony as Swift&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;as warm and tender as Sterne&#x27;s&quot;.

Peter Ackroyd describes Douglas&#x27;s &quot;London Street Games&quot; as &quot;a vivid memorial to the inventiveness and energy of London children, and an implicit testimony to the streets which harboured and protected their play.&quot;

John Sutherland reports that &quot;Douglas&#x27;s Mediterranean travel writing chimed with the public taste&quot;, and that &quot;there was a time when, in smart literary conversations, Norman Douglas was regarded as one of the smartest things going. Part of that smartness was his keeping, for the whole of his long depraved life, one jump ahead of the law.&quot;

In &quot;The Grand Tour and Beyond: British and American Travellers in Southern Italy, 1545–1960&quot; (which is chapter 4 of &quot;The Evolution of the Grand Tour: Anglo-Italian Cultural Relations since the Renaissance&quot;), Edward Chaney wrote that &quot;the true heir to the great tradition of the &#x27;pedestrian tour&#x27; in our own [20th] century has been &#x27;pagan-to-the-core&#x27; Norman Douglas. Having first visited the south of Italy with his brother in 1888, before he was 30 he had abandoned his pregnant Russian mistress and his job at the British Embassy in St Petersburg and purchased a villa at Posillipo. By then he had also published his first piece on the subject of southern Italy...&quot;

==Works==
Douglas&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;South Wind&quot;, is a fictionalised account of life in Capri, with controversial references to moral and sexual issues. It has been frequently reprinted.

His travel books combine erudition, insight, whimsicality, and fine prose. These works include &quot;Siren Land&quot; (1911), &quot;Fountains in the Sand&quot;, described as &quot;rambles amongst the oases of Tunisia&quot; (1912), &quot;Old Calabria&quot; (1915), &quot;Together&quot; (Austria) (1923), &quot;Alone&quot; (Italy) (1921), and the short “One Day” (Greece) (1929). Reviewing Douglas&#x27;s work in &quot;Italian Americana&quot;, John Paul Russo wrote:

Douglas&#x27;s early pamphlets on Capri were revised in &quot;Capri&quot; (privately published, 1930). His last published work was &quot;A Footnote on Capri&quot; (1952).

In 1928, Douglas published &quot;Some Limericks&quot;, an anthology of more-or-less obscene limericks with a mock-scholarly critical apparatus. This classic (of its kind) has been frequently republished, often without acknowledgment in pirate editions. A definitive edition has now been published.

* Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s character Sebastian Knight in &quot;The Real Life of Sebastian Knight&quot; (1941) owns a copy of &quot;South Wind&quot;. 
* Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; (1955). According to Frances Wilson, &quot;Douglas, Nabokov told his wife, was a &#x27;malicious pederast&#x27;, and as such is surely the model for &quot;Lolita&quot;&#x27;s Humbert Humbert. Nabokov ensures Douglas a part in the novel: Gaston Godin, Humbert&#x27;s homosexual colleague at Beardsley College, has a photograph of Norman Douglas on his studio wall...&quot;
* Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s protagonist in &quot;The Tremor of Forgery&quot; (1969) rereads a favourite passage of &quot;Fountains in the Sand&quot;.
* Anthony Burgess&#x27;s &quot;Earthly Powers&quot; (1980) makes occasional reference to Douglas.
* Robertson Davies&#x27; character John Parlabane refers to Douglas in the Cornish Trilogy novel, &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; (1980).
* Roger Williams&#x27;s &quot;Lunch With Elizabeth David&quot; (Little, Brown, 1999) features Douglas as a major character.
* Alex Preston&#x27;s &quot;In Love and War&quot; (2014) features Douglas as a character.
* D.H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Rod&quot; (1922). According to Richard Aldington&#x27;s &quot;Life for Life&#x27;s Sake&quot; (1941), p. 375 (and also Aldington&#x27;s &quot;Pinorman&quot; (1954), pp. 165, 185), the character James Argyle, in &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Rod&quot;, is based on Douglas. In &quot;Life for Life&#x27;s Sake&quot;, p. 375, Aldington writes that Lawrence&#x27;s portrait of Douglas as Argyle &quot;was the real cause of the breach between those two and of Norman&#x27;s anti-Lawrence pamphlet, though the ostensible &quot;casus belli&quot; was Lawrence&#x27;s superbly written introduction to the &quot;Memoirs&quot; of Maurice Magnus...&quot; In &quot;Late Harvest&quot; (1946), p. 52, however, Douglas writes, &quot;No. The playful caricature of myself in Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Rod&quot; is not the reason why I took up arms against him. The reason was that he had distorted the character of a dead friend of mine [Maurice Magnus] whose memory I wished to defend.&quot;

<doc id="990931" wikidata="Q2601047" url="?curid=990931" title="Final Fight 3">
<text>Final Fight 3, released in Japan as , is a side-scrolling beat &#x27;em up by Capcom originally released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1995. It is the second sequel to &quot;Final Fight&quot; released for the Super NES, following &quot;Final Fight 2&quot;, and like its predecessor, it was produced by Capcom&#x27;s consumer division with no preceding arcade version released.

The game features the return of the protagonist Guy along with Haggar and also introduces new characters Lucia and Dean. The game&#x27;s plot takes them through their efforts to rid Metro City of the new Skull Cross gang. &quot;Final Fight 3&quot; introduced new moves, as well as branching paths during gameplay and multiple endings. Also available is the option to fight alongside a CPU-controlled partner. However, most critics felt these changes did too little in the way of expanding and improving upon the original &quot;Final Fight&quot;, and the game was released to little fanfare.

The next &quot;Final Fight&quot; game released, &quot;Final Fight Revenge&quot;, eschewed the side-scrolling beat&#x27;em up gameplay in favor of a one-on-one 3D fighting game format.

==Plot==
Following the annihilation of the Mad Gear Gang, a new criminal group named the Skull Cross Gang emerges as the new dominant criminal organization in Metro City. When Guy returns to Metro City from his martial arts training and reunites with his old friend Mike Haggar, the Mayor of Metro City, the two are suddenly alerted that the Skull Cross Gang has started a riot in the downtown area of the city. Joined by Lucia, a detective in the Metro City Police&#x27;s Special Crimes Unit, and Dean, a street fighter whose family was murdered by the Skull Cross Gang, Guy and Haggar must once again save Metro City from its newest menace.

==Gameplay==
The player has a choice between four characters: Guy and Haggar from the original &quot;Final Fight&quot; return, along with new heroes Lucia and Dean. As in the previous &quot;Final Fight&quot; games, each character has their own set of moves, techniques and abilities unique to their character. Like in &quot;Final Fight 2&quot;, the game can be played alone or with a second player, along with an additional game mode that allows a single player be accompanied by a CPU-controlled partner.

The player has many new abilities which were not available in the previous &quot;Final Fight&quot; games. The player can now dash and perform dashing attacks or dashing jump attacks like in the previous Capcom beat-em-up &quot;Captain Commando&quot;. The player can also grab enemies from behind and perform holding and throwing attacks, as well as move while keeping the direction the player is facing locked.

The player also has access to command-based special techniques similar to &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, including a Super Move. Much like the Super Combos featured in &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot;, the player has a Super Move gauge which fills up as the player performs their regular attacks against enemies. When the gauge is full, the player will have access to a powerful Super Move, which will consume the entire gauge. If the Super gauge remains full for a certain period and the Super move is not used, then the gauge will be emptied automatically.

Like in the previous &quot;Final Fight&quot; games, the player has access to weapons, health-restoring food and other bonus point items, which are stored inside breakable drums. Each character in &quot;Final Fight 3&quot; specializes in a specific weapon and if the player picks up their character&#x27;s preferred weapon, then they will have access to a unique combo attack exclusive to the character (for example, Guy specializes in using nunchaku).

There are a total of six stages in the game, each with their unique boss character. The stages in the game feature multiple paths that changes the areas the player will visit, as well as the enemies and bosses they encounter. The game&#x27;s ending changes depending on the selected character, the path taken to reach the end of the game, and the difficulty setting.

==Reception==

&quot;GamePro&quot; gave the game a mixed review, summarizing that &quot;Although &quot;Final Fight 3&quot; has more characters and moves than its precursors, the gameplay quickly feels routine.&quot; They approved of the addition of Lucia but felt Dean&#x27;s moves were &quot;sluggish and awkward&quot; and that the bosses were little more than oversized regular enemies. While they praised the graphics and the branching stages, they felt the repetitiveness of the gameplay outweighed these. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; similarly felt that despite the improved graphics and new features, the game felt like simply &quot;more of the same&quot; with overly repetitive gameplay. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; too felt that the additions were not enough to make the game a significant step forward from the original, and remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s not dull, but it&#x27;s not all that exciting either.&quot;

In 2018, Complex rated the game #58 in their The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time writing: &quot;The third and final game in the Final Fight trilogy is the best out of the litter. And oh, yeah, Guy returned. So you know it was going down.&quot; In 2023, Time Extension included the game on their top 25 &quot;Best Beat &#x27;Em Ups of All Time&quot; list. They called it the best game in the series.

==Legacy==
The first stage″s background music, &quot;For Metro City&quot;, is used for the &quot;Hyper Street Fighter Alpha&quot; secret game featured in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha Anthology&quot; as Guy&#x27;s theme music in Classic Mode. Lucia later appeared as a playable character in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;.

<doc id="990938" wikidata="Q2035718" url="?curid=990938" title="Final Fight Revenge">
<text>is a 1999 3D fighting game released by Capcom, and the only one-on-one fighting game in the &quot;Final Fight&quot; series of beat &#x27;em up games. Originally developed and released for the ST-V arcade hardware, a home version was released for the Sega Saturn in 2000 in Japan only. The cast of playable characters in &quot;Final Fight Revenge&quot; includes series mainstays Mike Haggar, Cody and Guy, along with various members of the opposing Mad Gear gang.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Final Fight Revenge&quot; features a control configuration of an eight directional joystick and five action buttons: four attack buttons (two punch buttons and two kick buttons) and a fifth &quot;special&quot; button. The special button serves two functions in the game; the first function allows players to side-step into the foreground or background by holding special and pressing up or down.

The special button is also used to pick up weapons or health-recovering items lying on the ground. When the player is near a retrievable item or weapon, a green arrow will appear over the item to alert the player of its presence. There are two types of weapons in this game: melee weapons such as knives and lead pipes; or firearms such as flamethrowers and machine guns. The player can pick and store up to three weapons in their inventory at once and switch between them. The player can also throw a currently equipped weapon to their opponent.

As with most Capcom fighting games, each character has their own set of grappling moves and command-based Special Moves, as Super Moves that can only be performed by filling the Super Move gauge. The player can stock up to three full Super Move gauges. When a player finishes off an opponent with certain Super Moves a special finishing sequence will be shown to the player.

===Characters===
&quot;Final Fight Revenge&quot; features ten playable fighters, all of whom made their debut in the original &quot;Final Fight&quot; game. The playable roster includes Cody, Guy and Haggar, who were the player characters; El Gado, Poison and Andore, who were enemy characters; and Damnd, Sodom, Edi E., and Rolento, who were boss characters. A zombiefied version of Belger, the final boss from the original &quot;Final Fight&quot;, appears as the non-playable final boss character. The single-player mode consists of matches against six computer-controlled opponents and a final match against Belger. Each character has their own specific ending.

Guy, Sodom, Rolento, and Cody were previously featured in Capcom″s &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; series, with some of their abilities from &quot;Alpha&quot; carrying over to &quot;Revenge&quot;. Hugo and Poison would go on to appear with similar special moves in later &quot;Street Fighter&quot; games, while Haggar would later appear in the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series.

== Development and release ==
The game was designed by the Japanese division of Capcom but programmed by the American development division Capcom Digital Studios (later known as &quot;Capcom Production Studio 8&quot; in 2003), which later produced &quot;&quot; and &quot;Final Fight: Streetwise&quot;.

&quot;Final Fight Revenge&quot; was released for the arcades in July 1999 and ran on the Sega ST-V arcade hardware. It was the first &quot;Final Fight&quot; game released for the arcades since the original &quot;Final Fight&quot;. A home version was released for the Sega Saturn on March 30, 2000, making it the last Capcom game officially released for the platform. The Sega Saturn version was only available in Japan. However, the game can be played in English if the console&#x27;s internal language is set to any language except Japanese. A Dreamcast version was planned, but it was cancelled.

The Sega Saturn version has become rather rare, and a 2014 guide listed the game as costing £100 - £200 in the United Kingdom.

== Reception ==
&quot;GameFan&quot; gave the game a 40 out of 100. &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a 20 out of 40 score.

German magazine &quot;Video Games&quot; gave it a score of 50 out of 100.

Three reviewers for the &quot;Dreamcast Magazine&quot; (Japan) gave the game scores of 6, 6, and 8, for a total of 6.6 out of 10.

Game designer Shinji Mikami said in a 2020 interview that he was disappointed with &quot;Final Fight: Revenge&quot; as he was a fan of the series. It inspired him to make his own beat &#x27;em up game in 2006 called &quot;God Hand.&quot;

<doc id="990940" wikidata="Q631753" url="?curid=990940" title="Gassendi (crater)">
<text>Gassendi is a large lunar impact crater feature located at the northern edge of Mare Humorum. The crater was named after French astronomer Pierre Gassendi by the IAU in 1935. The formation has been inundated by lava during the formation of the mare, so only the rim and the multiple central peaks remain above the surface. The outer rim is worn and eroded, although it retains a generally circular form. A smaller crater – Gassendi A – intrudes into the northern rim, and joins a rough uplift at the northwest part of the floor. The crater pair bear a curious resemblance to a diamond ring.

In the southern part of the crater floor is a semi-circular ridge-like formation that is concentric with the outer rim. It is in the southern part where the rim dips down to its lowest portion, and a gap appears at the most southern point. The rim varies in height from as little as 200 meters to as high as 2.5 kilometers above the surface. The floor has numerous hummocks and rough spots. There is also a system of fractures that criss-crosses the floor, named the Rimae Gassendi.

The fresh crater Gassendi A is adjacent to Gassendi to the north. Due to its ray system, Gassendi A is mapped as part of the Copernican System. On some older maps the crater Gassendi A was called &quot;Clarkson&quot;, after the British amateur astronomer and selenographer Roland L. T. Clarkson, but this name is not officially recognized by the IAU and the name has been removed.

Gassendi was considered for a possible landing site during the Apollo program, but was never selected. However, it was imaged at high resolution by Lunar Orbiter 5, for this reason. It was also heavily photographed by Apollo 16.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Gassendi.

<doc id="990944" wikidata="Q1102232" url="?curid=990944" title="Clondalkin">
<text>Clondalkin () is a southwestern outer suburb of Dublin, Ireland, approximately west of Dublin city centre. It is within the administrative jurisdiction of South Dublin.

Clondalkin is also the name of a civil parish and a townland in the ancient barony of Uppercross, and is also used in relation to some local religious parishes.

The population of all electoral divisions labelled as Clondalkin was 47,938 as of the 2022 census.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Neolithic tribes first settled in the area around 7,600 years ago, taking advantage of the site&#x27;s location on the River Camac, overlooking the River Liffey and the inland pass between the mountains and the river. Evidence of the presence of the Cualann Celtic people (an early tribe possibly the Cauci on Ptolemy&#x27;s world map) can be found in various mounds and raths.

===Christian era===
Clondalkin is believed to have been founded by Saint Cronan Mochua as a monastic settlement on the River Camac over 1,400 years ago (possibly late 6th or early 7th centuries). The round tower was built perhaps two centuries later ( AD) as part of the monastery. This would make it an unusual tower, as most scholars assume that the main period of their construction was between the start of the 10th century and the end of the 12th century, and that this one was built in the 10th or 11th century. By the 8th century, Saint Fugillus was Bishop of Clondalkin and noted gospel manuscripts were produced – the most famous of these being the Clondalkin mass book which is on display in Karlsruhe, Germany.

===Viking arrival===
Clondalkin was sacked by Vikings in 832 AD, and the monastery was burned to the ground. One of the early Norse kings of Dublin, Amlaíb Conung, built a fortress on the site in the middle of the 9th century. In 867 a force led by Cennétig mac Gaíthéne, king of Loígis, burned the fortress at Clondalkin and killed 100 of Amlaíb&#x27;s followers. The monastery was later restored and, with help from other surrounding monasteries, and influenced the Viking settlers in their conversion to Christianity. The district remained under Norse control until the Viking defeat by Brian Boru at the famous Battle of Clontarf in 1014.

===Norman era===

Clondalkin witnessed another historic event during the Norman invasion in 1171 with a battle there between Richard de Clare (Strongbow) and the last High King of Ireland Ruaidhrí Ua Conchabhair.

Clondalkin is a civil parish in the ancient barony of Uppercross. An exclave of the parish, consisting of the single townland of Blundelstown, is located in the neighbouring barony of Newcastle to the west.

===17th century and beyond===
Centuries later, Clondalkin was the scene for some fighting in the 1641 Rebellion, when the Gaelic Irish in Ulster, and later in the rest of the kingdom, and the Old English in the Pale of Leinster rebelled against rule from Westminster. (Ireland had its own parliament at this time, but it was severely limited in its powers, e.g. by Poynings&#x27; Law.)

Clondalkin Paper Mill was established at the start of the 19th century by Thomas Seery and Son. Having changed ownership over the years, activity peaked during the First World War as the focus moved to war production. Productivity slowed until the mill closed its doors for the last time in 1987. Water to power the mill came from Brittas ponds via Saggart.

==Historical features==
A focal point for Clondalkin is the eighth-century round tower, one of the four remaining towers in the historic County Dublin. Acknowledged as one of the oldest in the country, it is 25.6 metres high and has its original conical cap. In July 2017, the Round Tower Heritage Centre opened in the village, which included an interactive interpretive centre and a monastic-style garden.

Clondalkin is also home to St Brigid&#x27;s Well, which is said to have been used for baptising pagans by Saint Brigid in the 5th century.

Tully&#x27;s Castle is a tower house and a protected national monument.

==Amenities==
The Clondalkin area had a population of approximately 46,000 as of 2016. Facilities serving the population include several supermarket chains, as well as small businesses, restaurants and pubs. There is also a post office. 

Clondalkin has a branch of South Dublin Libraries in a building which used to house a Carnegie Library. North Clondalkin Library, opposite the Immaculate Heart of Saint Mary&#x27;s Church, was due to open in late 2019. The local Church of Ireland church, St. John&#x27;s Church, was built in 1789 on the site of a medieval church, and extended in 1854.

Wheatfield Prison and Cloverhill Prison are two prisons near Clondalkin.

In March 2014, Clondalkin became the 51st &quot;Fairtrade town&quot; in Ireland. The occasion was marked with a ceremony in Clonburris National School.

==Transport==
Clondalkin is served by public transport to Dublin city centre, to nearby suburbs, and to neighbouring settled areas such as Tallaght.

Dublin Bus provide bus routes including the 13, 60, 68, 69, 151, G2, and L54. There are also other bus routes provided by Go-Ahead Ireland such as the W2 and L51. Many of these run from areas near Clondalkin, such as Rathcoole and Newcastle, into the city centre via Clondalkin, while some of these routes link Clondalkin to other local areas such as Liffey Valley, The Square, Lucan, and Leixlip.

Clondalkin railway station opened on 4 August 1846 and was closed for goods traffic on 9 June 1947. It was reopened during the 1990s for commuter services. Commuter trains are operated by Iarnród Éireann (Irish Rail) and run between Heuston station in Dublin and Kildare Town in County Kildare. A new station, to replace rather than supplement the previous station, has been built at Fonthill, north of Bawnogue. The original Clondalkin station was demolished in 2008 to facilitate a four-line track, allowing express trains to pass through without affecting local services on the Kildare line.

Bus Éireann services stop to collect and set down passengers at Newlands Cross, on the N7 road near Clondalkin.

As of 2007, Clondalkin was included on the preferred route for the proposed Dublin Metro West line.

==Media==
Two local newspapers, the &quot;Clondalkin Echo&quot; and &quot;Clondalkin Gazette&quot;, serve the area. The latter is published by Gazette Group Newspapers (part-owned by the &quot;Irish Times&quot;), and was launched in October 2005. The Clondalkin News is delivered free into households in Clondalkin.

The idea of designation for Clondalkin as an Irish Language Network region was raised in 2012, based on proposed amendments to the definition of &quot;Gaeltacht&quot;, to be &quot;based on linguistic criteria instead of on geographic areas&quot;.

<text>George Edward Hurrell (June 1, 1904 – May 17, 1992) was a photographer who contributed to the image of glamour presented by Hollywood during the 1930s and 1940s.

==Early life==
Born in the Walnut Hills district of Cincinnati, Ohio, Hurrell originally studied as a painter with no particular interest in photography. He first began to use photography only as a medium for recording his paintings. After moving to Laguna Beach, California from Chicago, Illinois in 1925 he met many other painters who had connections. One of those connections was Edward Steichen who encouraged him to pursue photography after seeing some of his works. Hurrell also found that photography was a more reliable source of income than painting. Hurrell was an apprentice to Eugene Hutchinson. His photography was encouraged by his friend aviator Pancho Barnes, who often posed for him. He eventually opened a photographic studio in Los Angeles.

==Career in Hollywood==
In the late 1920s, Hurrell was introduced to the actor Ramon Novarro, by Pancho Barnes, and agreed to take a series of photographs of him. Novarro was impressed with the results and showed them to the actress Norma Shearer, who was attempting to mould her wholesome image into something more glamorous and sophisticated in an attempt to land the title role in the movie &quot;The Divorcee&quot;. She asked Hurrell to photograph her in poses more provocative than her fans had seen before. After she showed these photographs to her husband, MGM production chief Irving Thalberg, Thalberg was so impressed that he signed Hurrell to a contract with MGM Studios, making him head of the portrait photography department. But in 1932, Hurrell left MGM after differences with their publicity head, and from then on until 1938 ran his own studio at 8706 Sunset Boulevard.
Throughout the decade, Hurrell photographed every star contracted to MGM, and his striking black-and-white images were used extensively in the marketing of these stars. Among the performers regularly photographed by him during these years were silent screen star Dorothy Jordan, as well as Myrna Loy, Robert Montgomery, Jean Harlow, Ramon Novarro, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Rosalind Russell, Marion Davies, Jeanette MacDonald, Lupe Vélez, Anna May Wong, Carole Lombard and Norma Shearer, who was said to have refused to allow herself to be photographed by anyone else. He also photographed Greta Garbo at a session to produce promotional material for the movie Romance. The session didn&#x27;t go well and she never used him again.

In the early 1940s Hurrell moved to Warner Brothers Studios photographing, among others Bette Davis, Jane Russell, Ann Sheridan, Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Ida Lupino, Alexis Smith, Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney. Later in the decade he moved to Columbia Pictures where his photographs were used to help the studio build the career of Rita Hayworth.

==Postwar==
He left Hollywood briefly to make training films for the First Motion Picture Unit of the United States Army Air Forces. When he returned to Hollywood in the mid-1950s his old style of glamour had fallen from favour. Where he had worked hard to create an idealised image of his subjects, the new style of Hollywood glamour was more earthy and gritty, and for the first time in his career Hurrell&#x27;s style was not in demand. He moved to New York City and worked for the advertising industry where glamour was still valued. He continued his work for fashion magazines and photographed for print advertisements for several years before returning to Hollywood in the 1960s. He captured early Marilyn Monroe, and actress Mamie Van Doren, who became a lifelong friend of his.

After 1970, his most prominent work was as a photographer for album covers. He shot the cover photos for Cass Elliot&#x27;s self-titled album (1972), Helen Reddy&#x27;s Imagination (1983), Tom Waits&#x27; &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; (1977), Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Mirage&quot; (1982), Queen&#x27;s &quot;The Works&quot; (1984), Midge Ure&#x27;s &quot;The Gift&quot; (1985) and Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Press to Play&quot; (1986).

==Death==
Hurrell died from complications from bladder cancer shortly after completing a TBS documentary about his life. He died on May 17, 1992.

<text>Dulwich Hamlet Football Club is a semi-professional football club based in East Dulwich in south-east London, England. They are currently members of and play at Champion Hill.

==History==
The club was formed in 1893, by Lorraine &#x27;Pa&#x27; Wilson. They were founder members of the Dulwich League in 1899, and were its inaugural champions. The club went on to retain the title the following season.
In 1907 they joined both the Isthmian League and the Spartan League, leaving the latter at the end of the 1907–08 season. In 1919–20 the club won its first Isthmian League title, winning the league on goal average against Nunhead. They also won the FA Amateur Cup, beating Tufnell Park 1–0 in the final at the Den. The club won the league again in 1925–26, and the FA Amateur Cup for a second time in 1931–32 win a 7–1 win against Marine in the final. The following season the club won their third league title. In 1933–34 they won their third FA Amateur Cup, beating Leyton 2–1 in the final. The two clubs met in the final again in 1936–37, with Dulwich winning 2–0.

In 1948–49 Dulwich won the Isthmian League for a fourth time. The 1976–77 season saw the club finish bottom of Division One, resulting in relegation to Division Two, which was renamed Division One the following season, with Division One becoming the Premier Division. The club went on to win the Division One title in 1977–78 and were promoted back to the Premier Division. They finished bottom of the Premier Division in 1989–90, and were relegated to Division One. The club were promoted back to the Premier Division at the end of the 1991–92 season after finishing third in Division One. In 1998–99 they reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time since 1948, losing 1–0 to Southport.

After finishing bottom of the Premier Division in 2000–01, the club were relegated back to Division One. After finishing seventh in 2003–04, the club played off against Wealdstone for a place in the Premier Division after league restructuring but lost 5–4 on penalties after a 2–2 draw. In 2010–11 Dulwich finished fifth and entered the promotion play-offs, beating Bognor Regis Town 3–1 in the semi-finals before losing 4–3 to Leatherhead in the final. The following season the club finished third, again qualifying for the promotion play-offs. After beating Folkestone Invicta 2–1 in the semi-finals, they lost the final 1–0 to Bognor Regis. They returned to the Premier Division after winning the Division One South title on the last day of the 2012–13 season with a 1–1 draw against Burgess Hill Town.

In 2014–15 Dulwich finished fourth in the Premier Division, qualifying for the play-offs. However, they lost 2–1 at Margate in the semi-finals. The following season the club finished fifth, and reached the play-off final after winning 1–0 at Bognor Regis Town in the semi-final, before going on to lose 3–1 at East Thurrock United. In 2016–17 Dulwich finished third in the Premier Division, qualifying for the play-offs for the third season in a row. After beating Enfield Town 4–2 in the semi-finals, they lost 2–1 at Bognor Regis Town in the final. The following season saw the club finish as runners-up in the Premier Division. In the subsequent play-offs, they beat Leiston 1–0 in the semi-final, before defeating Hendon 4–3 on penalties following a 1–1 draw in the final to earn promotion to the National League South.

The 2019–20 season saw Dulwich reach the first round of the FA Cup, with the club losing 4–1 at home to Carlisle United. In 2022–23 the club finished fourth-from-bottom of the National League South and were relegated to the Isthmian League Premier Division.

==Ground==

The club played at Woodwarde Road until 1895, when they moved to College Farm. The following year they moved to Sunray Avenue, where they remained until 1902. Between 1902 and 1912 they played at Freeman&#x27;s Ground on Champion Hill, before moving to an adjacent plot of land, where they played until the opening of the Champion Hill stadium in 1931. The stadium was used for amateur international matches, including the 1948 Summer Olympics.

In 1991 the stadium was demolished, as it was too run-down and dangerous to bring up to modern safety standards, as a result of new regulations brought in as a result of the Hillsborough disaster. During the 1991–92 season the club played at Tooting &amp; Mitcham United&#x27;s Sandy Lane ground, whilst a new, smaller stadium was built on the same site, opening for the start of the 1992–93 season. The new stadium was funded by the sale to Sainsbury&#x27;s of land that had once been the club&#x27;s training pitch, situated immediately behind the large covered terrace on the north side of the &#x27;old&#x27; Champion Hill, by the landlords King&#x27;s College London. The new ground remained in King&#x27;s ownership, with the club having given up the lease on the old ground in return for the new ground being built.

In September 2013 it became the first football ground in Greater London to be listed as an Asset of community value, but this was withdrawn by Southwark Council not long after, due to a legal technicality. In February 2014, Champion Hill was bought for £5.7m by Meadow Residential. In March 2018 the company forced the club out of the ground, resulting in a temporary groundshare with rivals Tooting &amp; Mitcham, at their Imperial Fields stadium, which lasted until Dulwich returned to Champion Hill in December 2018.

==Players==
===Current squad===
&quot;As of 14 February 2025&quot;











===Notable former players===
During the 1920s the club had two players capped by the full England team. Bert Coleman was capped whilst playing for Dulwich in 1921, whilst Edgar Kail won three caps against France, Belgium and Spain in 1929. Kail was the last amateur player to play for England whilst solely with an amateur club, and shunned many approaches from professional clubs to stay with Dulwich Hamlet, his local side, for whom he scored over 400 goals, and is still the subject of terrace songs by fans of the club.

==Backroom staff==
&quot;As of February 2025&quot;

===Managerial history===
&quot;From 1966 onwards&quot;:

==Supporters==
Despite being relegated, Dulwich Hamlet had the highest attendance in the National League South 2022–23, with an average attendance of 2,464. The club has gained a reputation for the activist element of their support, with the fans behind the goal going by the nickname of &quot;The Rabble&quot;. In recent seasons, the Football Club Committee, Supporters Trust and fans have backed anti-discrimination and anti-homophobia initiatives, amongst many other initiatives within the community.

The efforts made by the club and all of its volunteers to ensure that the club connects with all parts of its local community were recognised in 2016, when they were awarded the Football Foundation Community Club Of The Year at the National Game Awards in London.

The Rabble has also gained a reputation for creating a party atmosphere during games, and a particularly creative and witty approach to songs and chanting.

===Friendship with Altona 1893 and other European links===
Hamlet fans have developed a friendship with supporters of German club Altona 1893, as the two clubs were founded in the same year, which began as a friendship started by the Dulwich Hamlet supporters&#x27; team. In recognition of the relationship, the club adopted the Altona 1893 home strip as their away strip during the 2014–15 and 2022–23 seasons, the club&#x27;s 24–25 away strip also features the red and white of Altona 1893. On 12 July 2015, Altona 1893 and a large group of fans made the journey to South East London to play a friendly between the two sides. Altona 1893 won 5–3 on the day. In July 2015, Altona 1893 unveiled their new away strip in pink and blue colours, featuring a friendship logo on the sleeve. Dulwich Hamlet returned to Hamburg in July 2018 for a match against Altona 93 to commemorate the 125th anniversary of the founding of both clubs. The clubs met again in a fixture at Dulwich&#x27;s Champion Hill ground on 7 July 2023.

<text>Hommel is a lunar impact crater located in the southeast section of the Moon, in a region that is deeply impacted with a multitude of impact craters. The most notable craters nearby are Pitiscus to the north; Rosenberger due east; and Nearch to the southeast. The prominent crater Vlacq is nearly attached to the northeast rim. Also nearby is Asclepi to the west. Hommel is about 120 kilometers in diameter and its walls reach heights of 2,800 meters. It is from the Pre-Nectarian period, 4.55 to 3.92 billion years ago.

The eroded outer wall of Hommel is overlain and incised by a number of smaller but still sizeable craters. Hommel C overlays the western rim and Hommel A the north. Intruding into the rim are Hommel H to the northwest, Hommel B in the east, and Hommel P along the southern wall. These craters are in turn overlain by smaller craterlets. The crater Hommel D lies on the southern part of the inner floor, incising into the south rim. In the midpoint of the crater is a low central peak.

The crater is named for 16th century German mathematician and astronomer Johann Hommel.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hommel.

<doc id="990954" wikidata="Q2086498" url="?curid=990954" title="First Barons' War">
<text>The First Barons&#x27; War (1215–1217) was a civil war in the Kingdom of England in which a group of rebellious major landowners (commonly referred to as barons) led by Robert Fitzwalter waged war against King John of England. The conflict resulted from King John&#x27;s disastrous wars against King Philip II of France, which led to the collapse of the Angevin Empire, and John&#x27;s subsequent refusal to accept and abide by Magna Carta, which John had sealed on 15 June 1215.

The rebellious barons, faced with an uncompromising king, turned to King Philip&#x27;s son, Louis, who, in 1216, then sailed to England with an army despite his father&#x27;s disapproval, as well as the pope&#x27;s, who subsequently excommunicated him. Louis captured Winchester and soon controlled over half of the English kingdom. He was proclaimed &quot;King of England&quot; in London by the barons, although he was never actually crowned.

Louis&#x27;s ambitions of ruling England faced a major setback in October 1216, when John&#x27;s death led to the rebellious barons deserting him in favour of John&#x27;s nine-year-old son, Henry III, and the war dragged on. Louis&#x27;s army was finally beaten at the Battle of Lincoln on 20 May 1217. Also, after a fleet assembled by his wife, Blanche of Castile, attempted to bring him French reinforcements but was defeated off the coast of Sandwich on 24 August 1217, he was forced to make peace on English terms. He signed the Treaty of Lambeth and surrendered the few remaining castles that he held. The treaty had the effect of Louis agreeing he had never been the legitimate king of England. That formalised the end of the civil war and the departure of the French from England.

==Background==
King John in June 1215 was forced to put his seal to &quot;The Articles of the Barons&quot; by a group of powerful barons who were no longer willing to tolerate John&#x27;s failed leadership and despotic rule; The King&#x27;s Great Seal was attached upon it on 15 June 1215. In exchange, the barons renewed their fealty to King John on 19 July 1215. A formal document to record the agreement was drafted by the royal chancery on 15 July; this was the original Magna Carta. &quot;The law of the land&quot; is one of the great watchwords of Magna Carta by standing in opposition to the King&#x27;s mere will.

Magna Carta held clauses that theoretically noticeably reduced the authority of the King, such as Clause 61, the &quot;security clause&quot;, which allowed a group of 25 barons to override the King at any time by means of force, a medieval legal process known as &quot;distraint&quot; that was normal in feudal relationships, albeit had never been applicated towards a King. After numerous months of half-hearted attempts to reach a settlement in the summer of 1215, open conflict was unleashed amongst the rebel barons&#x27; alliance and the loyalist factions.

==Course of events==
===French intervention===
The war began over Magna Carta but quickly turned into a dynastic war for the throne of England. The rebel barons, faced with a powerful king, turned to Louis, the son and heir apparent of King Philip II of France and the grandson-in-law of King Henry II of England. The Norman invasion had occurred only 149 years before, and the relationship between England and France was not as simply adversarial as it later became. The contemporary document, the &quot;Annals of Waverley&quot; saw no contradiction in stating that Louis was invited to invade to &quot;prevent the realm being pillaged by aliens.&quot;

At first, in November 1215, Louis simply sent the barons a contingent of knights to protect London. However, even at that stage he also agreed to an open invasion, despite the discouragement from his father and from Pope Innocent III. That came in May 1216, when watchmen on the coast of Thanet detected sails on the horizon, and on the next day, the King of England and his armies saw Louis&#x27;s troops disembark on the coast of Kent.

John decided to escape to the Saxon capital of Winchester, and so Louis had little resistance on his march to London. He entered London, also with little resistance, and was openly received by the rebel barons and citizens of London and proclaimed (though not crowned) king at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Many nobles gathered to give homage to him, including Alexander II of Scotland, who held fiefs in England.

Many of John&#x27;s supporters, sensing a tide of change, moved to support the barons. Gerald of Wales remarked: &quot;The madness of slavery is over, the time of liberty has been granted, English necks are free from the yoke.&quot;

Pursuing John, Louis led his army south from London on 6 June, arriving the following day in Reigate where he found the castle abandoned. He moved onwards to Guildford Castle on 8 June, which surrendered immediately. Farnham Castle initially closed its gates but surrendered as the French started to lay siege. He met resistance only when he reached Winchester Castle on 14 June, but it fell after a ten-day siege. Louis&#x27;s campaign continued, and by July, about a third of England had fallen under his control.

===First siege of Dover===
In the meantime, the King of France taunted his son for trying to conquer England without first seizing its key port, Dover. The royal castles at Canterbury and Rochester, their towns, and indeed, most of Kent had already fallen to Louis. However, when he moved on to Dover Castle on 25 July, it was prepared. Its constable, Hubert de Burgh, had a well-supplied garrison of men.

The first siege began on 19 July, with Louis taking the high ground to the north of the castle. His men successfully undermined the barbican and attempted to topple the castle gate, but De Burgh&#x27;s men managed to repel the invaders, blocking the breach in the walls with giant timbers. (After the siege the weak northern gate was blocked and tunnels were built in that area, to St John&#x27;s Tower, and the new Constable&#x27;s Gate and Fitzwilliam&#x27;s Gate.) In the meantime, Louis&#x27;s occupation of Kent was being undermined by a guerrilla force of Wealden archers raised and led by William of Cassingham.

After three months spent besieging the castle and a large part of his forces being diverted by the siege, Louis called a truce on 14 October and soon returned to London.

===Sieges of Windsor and Rochester===
Apart from Dover, the only castle to hold out against Louis was that at Windsor, where 60 loyalist knights survived a two-month siege, despite severe damage to the structure of its lower ward. That was immediately repaired in 1216 by Henry III, who further strengthened the defences with the construction of the western curtain wall, much of which survives today. The damage was caused possibly by the castle having been besieged by the barons in 1189, less than 30 years earlier.

In 1206, John had spent £115 on repairs to Rochester Castle, and he had even preemptively held it during the year of the negotiations leading up to Magna Carta, but the Charter&#x27;s terms had forced him to hand it back into the custody of Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, in May 1215. The rebel barons had then sent troops under William d&#x27;Aubigny to the castle, to whom its constable Reginald de Cornhill opened the castle&#x27;s gates. Thus, during October 1215 on his marching from Dover to London, John found Rochester in his way and on 11 October began besieging it in person.
The rebels were expecting reinforcements from London but John sent fire ships out to burn their route in, the city&#x27;s bridge over the Medway. Robert Fitzwalter rode out to stop the king and fought his way onto the bridge but was eventually beaten back into the castle. John also sacked the cathedral, took anything of value and stabled his horses in it, all as a slight to Langton. Orders were then sent to the men of Canterbury.

After that five siege engines were erected, and work was carried out to undermine the curtain wall. By one of those means, the king&#x27;s forces entered and held the bailey in early November, and began attempting the same tactics against the keep, including undermining the south-eastern tower. The mine-roof was supported by wooden props, which were then set alight using pig-fat. On 25 November 1215, John had sent a writ to the justiciars saying, &quot;Send to us with all speed by day and night, forty of the fattest pigs of the sort least good for eating so that we may bring fire beneath the castle&quot;. The fire thus created caused one entire corner of the keep to collapse. The rebels withdrew behind the keep&#x27;s cross-wall but still managed to hold out. A few were allowed to leave the castle but on John&#x27;s orders had their hands and feet lopped off as an example.

Winter was now setting in, and the castle was taken on 30 November by starvation and not by force. John set up a memorial to the pigs and a gallows with the intention of hanging the whole garrison, but one of his captains, Savari de Mauléon, persuaded him not to hang the rebels since hanging those who had surrendered would set a precedent if John ever surrendered; only one man was actually hanged (a young bowman who had previously been in John&#x27;s service). The remainder of the rebel barons were taken away and imprisoned at various royal-held castles, such as Corfe Castle. Of the siege, the Barnwell chronicler wrote &quot;No one alive can remember a siege so fiercely pressed and so manfully resisted&quot; and that, after it, &quot;There were few who would put their trust in castles&quot;.

===Death of King John===
On 18 October 1216, John contracted dysentery, which would ultimately prove fatal. He died at Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire, and with him the main reason for the fighting. Louis now seemed much more of a threat to baronial interests than John&#x27;s nine-year-old son, Henry.

Pierre des Roches, Bishop of Winchester, and a number of barons rushed to have the young Henry crowned as King of England. London was held by Louis (it was his seat of government) and therefore could not be used for this coronation so, on 28 October 1216, they brought the boy from the castle at Devizes to Gloucester Abbey in front of a small attendance presided over by a Papal Legate, Guala Bicchieri (d. 1227, Bishop of Vercelli, papal legate in England 1216–18). They crowned Henry with a necklace of gold.

On 12 November 1216, Magna Carta was reissued in Henry&#x27;s name with some of the clauses omitted, including clause 61. The revised charter was sealed by the young king&#x27;s regent William Marshal. A great deal of the country was loyal to Louis, with the southwest of England and the Midlands favouring Henry. Marshal was highly respected and he asked the barons not to blame the child Henry for his father&#x27;s sins. The prevailing sentiment, helped by self-interest, disliked the idea of depriving a boy of his inheritance. Marshal also promised that he and the other regents would rule by Magna Carta. Furthermore, he managed to get support from the Pope, who had already excommunicated Louis.

===Louis&#x27;s losses===

William Marshal slowly managed to get most barons to switch sides from Louis to Henry and attack Louis. The two opposing sides fought for about a year. On 6 December 1216 Louis took Hertford Castle but allowed the defending knights to leave with their horses and weapons. He then took Berkhamsted Castle in late December, which again allowed the royal garrison to withdraw honourably with their horses and weapons.

By early 1217, Louis decided to return to France for reinforcements. He had to fight his way to the south coast through loyalist resistance in Kent and Sussex, losing part of his force in an ambush at Lewes, with the remainder pursued to Winchelsea and were saved from starvation only by the arrival of a French fleet.Since the truce had been arranged with Dover, the Dover garrison had repeatedly disrupted Louis&#x27;s communication with France, and so Louis sailed back to Dover to begin a second siege. The French camp, set up outside Dover Castle in anticipation of the new siege, was attacked and burned by William of Cassingham and Oliver fitz Regis just as the fleet carrying the reinforcements arrived. Louis was forced to land at Sandwich and march to Dover, where he began a second siege in earnest on 12 May 1217. This new siege diverted so much of Louis&#x27;s forces that Marshal and Falkes de Breauté were able to attack and heavily defeat pro-Louis barons at Lincoln Castle on 15 May or 20 May 1217, in what became known as the Second Battle of Lincoln.

Marshal prepared for a siege against London next. In the meantime, Louis suffered two more heavy defeats, this time at sea, at the Battle of Dover and Battle of Sandwich in the Straits of Dover, this time at the hands of William&#x27;s ally and Dover&#x27;s constable Hubert de Burgh. Louis&#x27;s new reinforcement convoy, under Eustace the Monk, was destroyed, making it nearly impossible for Louis to continue fighting.

==Aftermath==
After a year and a half of war, most of the rebellious barons had defected. That and the defeat of the French in 1217 forced Louis to negotiate. A few of Henry&#x27;s supporters held out for unconditional surrender, but the Earl of Pembroke successfully argued for the more moderate terms.

At the Treaty of Lambeth, which was signed on 11 September 1217, Louis had to give up his claim to be the King of England and to agree that he had never been the legitimate king. The principal provisions of the treaties were an amnesty for English rebels but the barons who had joined Louis had to pay the French prince 10,000 marks to expedite his withdrawal. Louis surrendered the few remaining castles that he had held and exhorted to his allies, Scottish and Welsh troops under Alexander II and Llywelyn the Great respectively, to lay down their arms. Louis also undertook not to attack England again.

==Museums==
* &quot;The 1216 Experience&quot; at Dover Castle (in the keep, rather than at the site of the siege at the north gate) recounts the two sieges and Battle of Sandwich, and there is also material on them at the town museum.

<text>Angus Gilchrist Wynne Jr. (January 9, 1914 – March 12, 1979) was an American businessman and real estate developer. 

His first major project was the Wynnewood residential development and Wynnewood Village shopping center in Oak Cliff, started shortly after World War II. He was later CEO of Great Southwest Corporation and Great Southwest Industrial District in Arlington, Texas; it was in that role that Wynne created the original Six Flags over Texas - he would go on to develop Six Flags theme parks in Georgia, and Missouri as well. 

Wynne later started Wynne Enterprises, conceptualizing one of the first water amusement parks in Galveston, Texas, but died before his dream could be developed. He also served as lieutenant commander in World War II.

==Early life==
Wynne was born on January 9, 1914. He was born to Angus G. Wynne Sr. of Texas and Nemo Shelmire Wynne, born in The Plains, Upper East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana.

His father and grandfather practiced law in Wills Point until his family moved from Kaufman, Texas to Dallas around 1928. Angus G. Wynne Sr. was the first President of the State Bar of Texas.

His brother Bedford S. Wynne, was one of the initial owners and founders of the Dallas Cowboys professional football franchise, along with Clint Murchison Jr.

His son Angus G Wynne III is the owner of Wynne Entertainment in Dallas and has been a producer of music events since 1968.

His son Shannon Shelmire Wynne is an American restaurateur living in Dallas, TX. He is best known for the Flying Saucer Draught Emporium, 8.0 Bar, Flying Fish, Meddlesome Moth and others.

Wynne attended Highland Park High School and was involved in Declamation. He graduated from Highland in 1931. He continued his involvement in Declamation into University, where he competed at the University of Texas; making it into the final round.

Wynne graduated from the Lawrenceville School in 1932.

In his free time, Angus participated in the Austin Little Theatre, and performed in the 1934 production of &quot;Design for Living&quot;.

He also attended Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va. from 1934 to 1935, before receiving a B.A. from University of Texas at Austin in 1938.

During their time at UT, Wynne and his brother Bedford S. Wynne became brothers of the Texas Alpha chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, as was their father Angus Wynne Sr., one of the chapter&#x27;s founders in 1904.

==Career==
===Early career, and World War II: 1938-1945===
He worked on Texas oil fields from 1938 to 1940, before enlisting in the United States Navy Reserve.

On August 18, 1940, Wynne began attending the United States Naval Reserve Midshipmen&#x27;s School. October 1, 1941, he reported on board the USS Nicholson. On July 17, 1944, he was reported on board the USS Grayson. On December 1, 1945, Wynne separated Eighth Naval District, New Orleans rank Lieutenant Commander, (D), USNR with numerous medals, ribbons.

In the Navy, he was awarded six service stars for service in the European and Asiatic theaters during WWII.

===Real-estate development: 1946-1958===

Wynne who served as the president of American Home Realty, brokered a deal to buy the Blessing and Giddens Mill and Lumber Company, Dallas&#x27; oldest and largest mill.

American Home Realty began building a $25 million home development named Wynnewood. Featuring 2,200 houses and 1,000 apartments, the project was the largest integrated home building project at the time.
 Wynnewood Development Corporation was created, and Angus was made the president. Wynne also served on the board of the Wynnewood Bank.

Wynne, was made the chairman of the Home Builders&#x27; Association of Dallas, and attended events representing the association.
In January 1956, it was announced New York based firm Webb &amp; Knapp, Inc. a group of Dallas investors, Angus Wynne, Jr. and his uncle Toddie Lee Wynne&#x27;s new company Great Southwest Corporation, were to develop a $500 Million industrial park on U.S. Route 80. The partnership bought Paul Waggoner&#x27;s ranch which was located between Dallas and Fort Worth. The first payment of $500,000 was presented to Waggoner with Angus Wynne&#x27;s signature on the cashier&#x27;s check. The industrial park was expected to employee 100,000 people. In July, it was announced Nelson, Laurance, David, Winthrop, and John D. Rockefeller III would join the Wynnes, and Webb &amp; Knapp in developing the industrial park.

Milton L. Stern from Toronto and Dallas, along with his company Texas Industrial Ventures, attempted to sue all involved with the proposed industrial park. Stern claimed the men stole his idea, and after 12 days of arguments Judge Paul Peurifoy rejected the $300 Million lawsuit, though held that Texas Industrial Ventures was entitled to repurchase with 60-days from Webb &amp; Knapp six tracks of land involved for $18,000.

Construction on the first warehouse to make up the &quot;Great Southwest Industrial District&quot; commenced in 1956. In November 1956, Wynne was pushing for a Private railway to be constructed for the new development. He said, &quot;We felt that multiple rail service is so desirable for our tenants that, should it become necessary, we should provide it through a privately operated truck line railroad.&quot; Construction continued through in 1957, and in June 1958 the Interstate Commerce Commission gave Wynne and the Great Southwest Corp permission to build its railroad. Great Southwest Corporation established Great Southwest Railroad, Inc., for its construction. The new line was built between the Industrial District connecting to the Texas and Pacific Railway and the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad.

Despite the addition of the new railroad, the Industrial Park struggled to succeed in selling retail and warehouse space to prospective businesses. In response Wynne conceived the idea of a nearby sports complex to draw in customers. In April 1958, Great Southwest Corporation, of which Wynne was the president, Rockefeller Center, Inc., and Webb &amp; Knapp presented to the public a large expansion that would feature a sports complex with a rifle range, driving range, bowling alley, and a theme park dubbed &quot;Southwestland.&quot;

===Theme parks, and the World&#x27;s Fair: 1958-1970===
During the planning stages of the expansion, Arlington mayor Tom Vandergriff advised that Wynne and his family should visit the recently opened Disneyland in Anaheim, California. This visit inspired Wynne to change his plans, realizing he should build a park that celebrated Texas history. Under the leadership of Wynne, the Great Southwest Corporation hired former Disneyland vice-president C. V. Wood&#x27;s firm Marco Engineering to help design the park.

In January 1960, Great Southwest announced its intention to issue $11,500,000 in stocks and debentures to finance the construction. By April, the new complex was under a news and advertising blackout after it was advised the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules stated, &quot;a publicity silence must be observed on ventures offering stock to the public.&quot; At the same time it was revealed very little progress had been made at the site aside from construction of the 32-lane bowling alley which was announced to be the first planned structure to be built.

Construction on the park, and the rest of the Great Southwest Sports Complex, began in August 1960. Wynne first intended to name the park &quot;Texas Under Six Flags&quot; until his wife notified him that &quot;Texas ain&#x27;t under nothing.&quot; The &#x27;six flags&#x27; originally represented the six countries that have governed Texas: France, Spain, Mexico, The Republic of Texas, The Confederate States of America, and the United States of America. In February 1961, Wynne traveled to Mexico City to invite Mexican participation in the park. Wynne brought in Randall Duell, who had worked at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for 23-years designing and building film sets, Charlie Thompson another Disneyland alumnus, Charlie Meeker the former director of State Fair of Texas, and Joe Lambert who was experienced in Landscape lighting. All of the men were hired to ensure the park met Wynne&#x27;s expectations.

When Six Flags Over Texas opened on August 5, 1961, it was a massive success bringing in 8,374 visitors opening day.

In 1962 Great Southwest posted its first profit since its inception in 1956, proving Wynne&#x27;s gamble paid off. With the success of the park, Wynne was asked to contribute to the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, and he proposed the construction of a 2,400-seat theater. Developed in partnership with Compass Productions Inc, who was best known for producing television and Broadway dramas. The project was supervised by Wynne&#x27;s cousin Gordon R. Wynne Jr., the vice-president of Compass Productions. The construction of the Music Hall was expected to cost $4 million and would be nearly three acres in size. Wynne-Compass Fair, Inc. was officially formed to create the pavilion for the fair.

In February 1964 it was reported Wynne put $6 million into building the Music Hall, and a Texas pavilion for the fair. Texas Governor John Connally, did not want to endanger his &quot;domestic program&quot; by sponsoring the pavilion for the fair. In an interview with journalist Joseph Lelyveld, Wynne said as the primary financer, he would be the one to make money at the fair, adding, &quot;I&#x27;ve never done anything just for fun.&quot;

To create the same ambiance at the Texas Pavilion as there was Six Flags Over Texas, Wynne imported 300 employees, &quot;hosts and hostesses,&quot; as he referred to them. They were brought from the park in Texas to New York for the fair. The music hall theater, which sat 2,600 staged three 90-minute musical shows called &quot;To Broadway With Love&quot;. The pavilion also featured an all-day restaurant and nightclub called the Frontier Palace.

&quot;To Broadway With Love&quot;, was well received by critics who called it, &quot;lavish,&quot; and &quot;delightful.&quot; Despite the glowing reviews, it was announced that the show would close at the end of July 1964. Wynne-Compass Fair, Inc. filed for bankruptcy as the Texas Pavilion was not generating enough revenue to pay creditors.

On July 31, 1964, Wynne&#x27;s 20-year-old son, Angus III, was arrested for trespassing and assault after he tried to re-enter the pavilion after the fair closed at 2 in the morning. Wynne III, began fighting with the arresting officers, to which the pavilion&#x27;s general manager William C. Baker, and Austin Jenkins, assistant director, came to Angus III&#x27;s defense and were both charged with assault and resisting arrest.

In 1965, Wynne revealed the Great Southwest Corporation created a new wholly owned subsidiary the Great Southwest Atlanta Corporation. The new company had bought 3,000 acres of land for more than $3 million in the Atlanta area for a new theme park location, which would go on to be Six Flags Over Georgia.

Wynne subsequently expanded Six Flags in 1967 with a second original park, Six Flags Over Georgia, which is located just outside Atlanta, Georgia, and finally Six Flags over Mid America (now Six Flags St. Louis), in Eureka Missouri, just outside St. Louis in 1971.

With the significant cost of developing a park from the ground up becoming prohibitive, the company began acquiring parks with significant potential, but to date, had been less successful than those of Six Flags. AstroWorld, built by Judge Roy Hofheinz in Houston, Texas, was the first park to be acquired in 1975. Two years later, the company went on to purchase a New Jersey park developed by the Hardwicke Companies and designed by Warner LeRoy (son of Wizard of Oz director, Mervyn LeRoy), called Great Adventure. The last park that Wynne would see acquired in his lifetime under the Six Flags name was California&#x27;s Magic Mountain (outside Los Angeles) in 1979. Wynne died that same year and although he was no longer associated with the company at the time of his death, Six Flags would eventually acquire numerous other properties and become the world&#x27;s largest regional theme park chain.

===Great Southwest Departure===
In July 1970, Angus G. Wynne, Jr. was promoted to president and chief executive officer, from the role of a chairman. Later that month Great Southwest Corp.&#x27;s parent company Penn Central Transportation Company applied to reorganize the company under bankruptcy laws. This resulted in Great Southwest having money difficulties because certain credit facilities have been terminated or suspended, and because other cash-producing operations were forced to cease temporarily.

In October 1970 Penn Central selected Victor Palmieri as Wynne&#x27;s successor as president and chief executive officer. At the same time, Angus G. Wynne, Sr. and five other directors resigned from the Board of directors. A new board was established with Wynne, Jr., Palmieri, among others.

Wynne, Jr. along with three other executives were deposed from their positions with Great Southwest Corp. In November 1970 the company filed a suit in the Orange County, California Superior Court alleging the employees were overcompensated. It was claimed Wynne had been over paid by $3 million as part of a &quot;cash incentive program.&quot; According to the suit, the contract establishing the incentive program wasn&#x27;t valid. Wynne, Jr. was also accused of being too aggressive and expansionistic at a time when the company was suffering from liquidity problems. Wynne, Jr. and the other officers countersued the company alleging they were rightfully owed the money they were given.

In November 1972, Great Southwest and Wynne, Jr. settled for $208,000.

==Failing health, and death==

In 1973, at the age of 59, Wynne suffered from a major stroke, and never fully recovered.

Angus died on March 19, 1979, of a heart attack. He was laid to rest at Grove Hill Memorial Park in Dallas, Texas.

==Personal life==
While attending the University of Texas, Wynne dated Caroline Brownlee.

Angus married Joanne Estelle Wynne on February 26, 1941. Their marriage produced four children including, son Angus III (born December 25, 1943), son David (born March 15, 1946), daughter Mary (born August 31, 1948), and son Shannon (born December 2, 1951).

In November 1949, Angus and Joanne attended the Neiman Marcus annual Jamboree at the Dallas Athletic Club.

In April 1964, Wynne was the guest of honor at the 55th annual dinner dance of the Texas Club of New York.

Wynne and Joanne divorced on June 9, 1978.

Wynne married his second wife Margaret, and gained two step-daughters Bonnie and Michelle O&#x27;Rourke.

===Civic involvement===
In 1954, Wynne was elected to a 22-member board of directors chosen to help address the, migrant worker crisis. The board was made up of 12 people from Texas, and 10 from Indianapolis. The crisis was 2,500,000 workers were displaced by mechanization of agriculture, and flocked to northern cities. The Board of Fundamental Education was created to address the economic and social crisis on a national scale.

In 1955, Wynne joined a statewide campaign to raise funds to support the Texas Boy Scouts of America.

Wynne, and Winthrop Rockefeller, were among the guests invited to speak at a civic development conference being held June 1957 in Little Rock, Arkansas. Wynne spoke on a panel about the future of downtown business districts. In March 1958, Wynne spoke at the fourth Industrial Development Workshop sponsored by the University of Arizona, where he highlighted differences between zoning for the county and city governments as &quot;the biggest problem&quot; in the Dallas-Fort Worth development.

Angus Wynne&#x27;s civic involvement included developmental work for the University of Texas, Baylor University Medical Center and Children&#x27;s Medical Center of Dallas. He also worked with the Cotton Bowl Council, the State Fair of Texas and the National Conference of Christians and Jews.

==Honors==
In 2001, State Highway 360 through Arlington was officially designated the Angus G. Wynne Jr. Freeway.

In 2013, the Fort Worth City Counsel proposed renaming the section of State Highway 360 through Fort Worth after Wynne as well.

<doc id="990965" wikidata="Q1442094" url="?curid=990965" title="Letronne (crater)">
<text>Letronne is the lava-flooded remnant of a lunar impact crater. It was named after French archaeologist Jean-Antoine Letronne. The northern part of the rim is completely missing, and opens into the Oceanus Procellarum, forming a bay along the southwestern shore. The formation is located to the northwest of the large crater Gassendi.To the west-southwest is the flooded crater Billy, and north-northwest lies the smaller Flamsteed.

The surviving rim of Letronne is now little more than a semi-circular series of ridges. The flooded, broken rim of Winthrop overlies the western wall. The rim is the most intact along the eastern stretch, forming a mountainous promontory into the mare. A small cluster of central rises lie at the midpoint of the crater. The wrinkle ridge Dorsa Rubey traverses the floor from north to south, and outlines a portion of the missing rim. The crater floor is otherwise nearly smooth and relatively free of craterlets, with the exception of Letronne B near the southeast rim.

Letronne is one of the largest craters of Lower (Early) Imbrian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Letronne.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

* Letronne D — &quot;See&quot; Scheele.
* Letronne P — &quot;See&quot; Winthrop.

<doc id="990967" wikidata="Q675808" url="?curid=990967" title="Caffè Nero">
<text>Caffè Nero is a coffeehouse company headquartered in London, England, established in 1997 by Gerry Ford. Caffè Nero runs over 1,000 coffee houses in eleven countries: the UK, Ireland, Sweden, Poland, Cyprus, Croatia, Turkey, the UAE, Oman and the United States. In 2009, Caffè Nero bought and opened its own coffee roastery in Battersea, south London, which supplies the coffee to all its coffee houses worldwide.

Caffè Nero Ltd is majority owned through a chain of intermediary companies, including UK-based Nero Group Holdings Ltd and Luxembourg-based Rome Intermediate Holdings Sarl, by Gerry Ford. The company successfully dismissed a hostile takeover attempt by EG Group during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==History==
In 1997, Gerry Ford led a small group of investors in the purchase from Ian Semp of five London coffee outlets. At the same time the signature coffee house blend – Classico – was introduced, and has gone on to receive awards for its quality. The Classico blend is still served in every store today.

In March 2001, Caffè Nero joined the London Stock Exchange under the symbol CFN. In early 2007, the company was the subject of a management buy-out by the newly formed Rome Bidco Ltd and taken private. The company expanded to Turkey in 2007, the UAE in 2009, Poland in 2012, Cyprus in 2013, Ireland and the United States in 2014, Croatia in 2017, Oman in 2018 and Sweden.

In 2013, Caffè Nero&#x27;s coffee was rated best-tasting among five major UK brands by experts at the independent consumer magazine &quot;Which?&quot;

In June 2016, the Caffè Nero Group completed the purchase of the Harris + Hoole business from Tesco, with 43 sites, and in January 2019 the Group expanded further by completing the purchase of the majority shareholding of the 100-strong coffee chain Coffee#1 located in Wales, South West England and the Midlands from SA Brains. The deal gave Caffe Nero a 67% majority stake in the business; in February 2022, Caffe Nero purchased the remaining 33%.

In 2019 they partnered with the beverage company Fever-Tree to sell two variations of the beverage espresso and tonic across its outlets.

In 2020, like many businesses in the hospitality sector, Caffè Nero suffered from poor trading conditions because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the second lockdown in November 2020, the company proposed entering a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) with its creditors. Ford hoped that successful renegotiation of rent agreements with landlords, and a reduction in overall costs, would enable the company to rebuild its business when the pandemic ended; more than 90% of creditors voted in favour in November 2020. The CVA was approved the day after Caffè Nero confirmed it had rejected an unsolicited takeover approach from the brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who are behind the EG Group, stating that they had &quot;clear intention&quot; to disrupt the CVA &quot;as a precursor to opportunistically acquiring the company at a later date.&quot;

In September 2021, the high court dismissed the challenge against the CVA, brought by a landlord with the backing of the Issa brothers, with Mr Justice Green ruling that the company had &quot;acted in good faith, in accordance with their professional duties and reached a perfectly reasonable decision that it was not in the best interests of the creditors to postpone the CVA process&quot;.

In January 2022, Caffè Nero completed a £330m refinancing to give it a platform for future growth and development as well as the ability to resume its new store-opening programme as the business continued its recovery from the effects of the pandemic.

In August 2022, Caffè Nero was awarded a Princess Royal Award For Outstanding Workplace Training in recognition of the impact of its workplace leader development courses.

In May 2023 it was announced that Caffè Nero would run the Nero Book Awards, annual awards in four categories for books published in Britain or Ireland.

In October 2024 Caffè Nero bought Nottingham based Coffee 200° making 200° the fifth brand to join the group.

==Controversies==

Some of the company&#x27;s stores have had planning permission controversies or enforcement. In December 2011, councillors in Skipton accused Caffè Nero of &quot;bully-boy tactics&quot; following the opening of a store without the required planning permission.

 Caffè Nero had not paid any corporation tax in the UK since 2007 on sales of £2 billion and had been subject to criticism, although the BBC reported that &quot;there is no suggestion that Caffe Nero has done anything illegal&quot; and that &quot;Caffe Nero has previously rejected accusations that its complex corporate structure involving various holding companies is designed to avoid corporation tax.&quot;

In May 2015, the company said that they would stop serving milk from farms in Gloucestershire&#x27;s badger cull areas following threats from animal-rights activists. On 29 May 2015, the company said: &quot;Caffè Nero has instructed its partners supplying to stores which are situated around the cull zone areas to supply milk from farms outside of the zone.&quot; 

On 7 July 2015, rats were videoed scurrying along the floor and counter in their Donegall Square West unit in Belfast, despite having previously been awarded a four out of five star rating by inspectors from Belfast City Council. Having been notified of the incident, the store was closed for a full investigation and later reopened; the source of the infestation was an adjacent disused building. 

A 2017 undercover investigation by the BBC programme &quot;Watchdog&quot; found trace amounts of faecal bacteria in the iced water used for drinks in Caffè Nero, Starbucks and Costa Coffee. It was suggested that the ice was most likely to have been contaminated by being touched by unclean hands. The three major coffee chains said they were taking steps to deal with the matter. Tony Lewis, head of policy at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, urged caution about the BBC&#x27;s findings, stating: &quot;The public should not panic about this. You can&#x27;t generalise from the small sample size.&quot;

In June 2018, Polish State Sanitary Inspectorate and media reported 63 adults and 10 children having been poisoned (21 of whom were hospitalized) after eating salmonella-contaminated cakes served in a number of Caffè Neros in Warsaw, Kraków and Wrocław.

<text>Herman B Wells (June 7, 1902 – March 18, 2000), a native of Boone County, Indiana, was the eleventh president of Indiana University Bloomington and its first university chancellor. He was pivotal in the transformation of Indiana University from a small, locally oriented college into a world-class institution of higher learning through expanded enrollment, recruitment of new faculty, construction of new buildings, new program offerings, and campus beautification projects. He remained steadfast in his support of IU&#x27;s faculty and students, especially in the areas of academic freedom and civil rights. 
Wells began his career in banking, but served the university in a variety of faculty and administrative capacities during his seventy-year career at IU Bloomington: instructor and assistant professor, department of economics (1930–35; dean and professor of administration, school of business administration (1935–37); acting president (1937–38); and president (1938–62). He gave up control in 1962 to become university chancellor (1962–2000); interim president (1968); and chairman of the board of the Indiana University Foundation (1969–72), as well as other leadership roles at the IU Foundation.

== Early life ==
Herman B Wells was born on June 7, 1902, in Jamestown, Boone County, Indiana. He was the only child of Joseph Granville Wells, a bank cashier and a former teacher and elementary school principal, and Anna Bernice (Harting) Wells, a former teacher. Herman was not given a middle name, only the letter &quot;B&quot; not followed by a period. (A family tradition on his mother&#x27;s side had middle names beginning with that letter, but Wells&#x27; parents could not agree on a middle name for him.) Wells&#x27;s father committed suicide in 1948; his mother died in 1973.

Wells grew up in Jamestown, attended a local Methodist church, and played alto horn in the Jamestown Boys&#x27; Band. In 1917, the family moved to Lebanon, Indiana, the seat of government for Boone County, when Joseph was appointed deputy county treasurer. After school and on Saturdays, Herman helped out at a local bank where his father worked.

==Education==
Wells graduated from Lebanon High School in 1920 and was voted &quot;Funniest&quot; and &quot;Best All-Around Boy&quot; his senior year. Wells served as treasurer for the high school&#x27;s yearbook and was involved in the school&#x27;s newspaper, theater productions, and various fundraisers. After graduation Wells worked at a bank in nearby Whitestown, Indiana, to earn money for college. Although Wells&#x27;s parents were supportive of his desire to continue his education, they had limited financial resources to pay for his college tuition and other expenses.

Wells initially enrolled at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1920, but transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, in 1921 at the beginning of his sophomore year. Although his father objected to the move because Illinois had a strong business school, Wells convinced his father that the transfer to IU would be a good idea, especially since he intended to work in Indiana after graduation and already had friends at IU. Wells also pointed out that the connections he developed at IU would be useful to his future career. In his autobiography, &quot;Being Lucky: Reminiscences and Reflections&quot; (1980), Wells described his early impressions of IU: &quot;It was a simple place in those days, with not yet three thousand students, but it had great charm and appeal for me.&quot;

Wells was active in campus life as an IU undergraduate, he pledged Sigma Nu fraternity, lived in its chapter house at 322 East Kirkwood, and became involved in campus activities. Wells served as the fraternity chapter&#x27;s treasurer and was elected as his fraternity chapter&#x27;s president (eminent commander) in his senior year. He was also treasurer of IU&#x27;s Union Board, a student organization established in 1909. In addition, Wells played in IU&#x27;s band and frequently visited the Book Nook, a local hangout that he described as &quot;a remarkably fertile cultural and political breeding place in the manner of the famous English coffee houses.&quot; Wells earned a Bachelor of Science degree in commerce (business) in 1924.

After college graduation Wells spent the next two years (1924–26) working as an assistant bank cashier at the First National Bank of Lebanon, Indiana, where his father worked as a cashier, and living at home with his parents, before continuing his education at IU Bloomington. Wells earned Master of Arts degree in economics from IU in 1927. His master&#x27;s thesis, &quot;Service Charges for Small or So-Called Country Banks,&quot; was published in &quot;The Hoosier Banker&quot; in 1927. Wells began doctoral studies in economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but his schooling ended in 1928,
when he took a job with the Indiana Bankers Association.

== Early career ==
In 1928 Wells left his graduate studies at Wisconsin to take a job as a field secretary for the Indiana Bankers Association, where he remained until 1931. As part of his work at the IBA, Wells travelled throughout Indiana visiting local banks, attending meetings, and working closely with bankers to conduct research on the history of Indiana&#x27;s financial institutions, banking regulations, and the causes of bank failures. He also wrote a monthly column, &quot;Hoosier Highways,&quot; for &quot;The Hoosier Banker&quot;, the IBA&#x27;s journal.

In addition to working for the IBA, Wells became an instructor in IU&#x27;s Department of Economics and Sociology in 1930. By 1931 Wells had become the director of research for the state government&#x27;s Study Commission for Indiana Financial Institutions, in addition to his jobs at the IBA and IU. Wells was the main author of the commission&#x27;s report that recommended far-reaching reforms to Indiana&#x27;s financial regulations and policies, many of which were adopted by the Indiana General Assembly in 1933 had a major impact on the state&#x27;s banking laws.

Wells established a home base at Woodburn House, a private residence he leased on North College Avenue in Bloomington, during the early years of his career. He also spent time in Indianapolis, frequently staying at the Claypool Hotel or the Indianapolis Athletic Club, and at Nashville in Brown County, Indiana.

In 1933 Wells took a two-year leave of absence from his appointment as an assistant professor at IU. Between 1933 and 1935, when he returned to IU, Wells worked three full-time jobs. He was secretary of the Indiana Commission for Financial Institutions, as well as a bank supervisor, Division of Banks and Trust Companies, and supervisor of the Division of Research and Statistics at the newly created Indiana Department of Financial Institutions, a state agency that originated in the study commission&#x27;s recommendations.

== Academic career ==
===IU instructor and dean===
Wells began his seventy-year career at IU in 1930, when he joined the economics faculty as an instructor at the Bloomington campus. This position led to an assistant professorship in economics at the university in 1933. Wells accepted the job, but took a two-year leave of absence to work for the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions before returning to IU.

In 1935 IU&#x27;s president, William Lowe Bryan, appointed Wells as dean of the School of Business Administration,
which later became the Indiana University Kelley School of Business. Wells, who was Bryan&#x27;s protégée, would succeed him as the university&#x27;s president in 1937, despite rumors that Indiana governor Paul McNutt, a former dean of the law school, was interested in the position.

===IU president===
In 1937, two years after his selection as dean of IU&#x27;s business school, Wells was offered the position of acting president following Bryan&#x27;s unexpected resignation. Wells accepted on the condition that he not be considered for the permanent presidency of the university, because he did not feel he was adequately prepared to take on the president&#x27;s responsibilities. Wells became interim president effective July 1, 1937. McNutt, who was rumored to be the front-runner for the permanent IU president&#x27;s post, withdrew his name from consideration, and on March 22, 1938, the IU board of trustees unanimously elected Wells from its remaining slate of candidates as the university&#x27;s eleventh president. Wells was inaugurated on December 1, 1938, as the youngest state university president in the nation. Wells held this post until his retirement in 1962.
Although Wells could have moved into in the President&#x27;s House on campus, he remained at Woodburn House, his residence close to downtown Bloomington, for twenty-five years. Woodburn House allowed him more privacy, away from campus life. James Woodburn, the owner of Woodburn House, donated the residence to the university in 1940. Bryan, who became IU&#x27;s president emeritus, continued to reside at the President&#x27;s House on campus until his death in 1953. Wells lived in the President&#x27;s House (later known as Bryan House) from 1957 until his retirement as IU&#x27;s president in 1962. After Wells moved to the President&#x27;s House, Woodburn House continued to be used as a private residence until the IU Alumni Association assumed management of the property in 1976 and converted it as a place to entertain guests.

Indiana University fared much better than most state schools thanks to the entrepreneurship dean and president Wells. He collaborated with Frederick L. Hovde, the president of IU&#x27;s cross state rival, Purdue; together they approached the Indiana delegation to Congress, indicating their highest priorities. For Wells, it was to build a world-class music school, replacing dilapidated facilities. As a result of these efforts, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) built one of finest facilities in the country. He added matching funds from the state legislature, and opened a full-scale fund-raising campaign among alumni and the business community. In 1942, Wells reported that &quot;The past five years have been the greatest single period of expansion in the physical plant of the University in its entire history. In this period 15 new buildings have been constructed.

During his twenty-five years as IU&#x27;s president, Wells recruited new, research-oriented faculty members to the university. When Wells was serving as acting president he travelled in excess of in one year as he sought to attract bright, young scholars, as well as established faculty. Wells was successful at attracting notable research scientists such as behavioral scientist B. F. Skinner, geneticist Tracy Sonneborn, and Nobel Prize-winning geneticist Hermann J. Muller, among others. Another one of Wells&#x27;s early efforts was to increase emphasis on the arts by adding more courses in music, fine arts, theater, and drama, and planning new cultural arts buildings on the Bloomington campus. Wells is also credited with bringing together students, faculty, staff, state government officials, and the public in an effort to develop IU as an institution of higher learning. In addition, Wells was pivotal in expanding the university&#x27;s global perspective, which included expansion of IU&#x27;s international study programs.

Following World War II, Wells oversaw the largest increase in the student population in the history of the university, nearly tripling the student body from 11,000 students statewide in 1938 to 31,000 in 1962. Wells became regularly involved in student activities, taking an active interest in the students&#x27; lives, and was popular among the student body. He frequently took walks around campus, where he often engaged in conversations with as many students as possible.

Wells also worked to end segregation at the university and to make his views known that racism would no longer be tolerated. For example, Wells ended segregated seating at IU Commons, the student dining facilities in the campus&#x27;s Indiana Memorial Union building. He also worked with IU&#x27;s black alumni and the university&#x27;s college coach, Branch McCracken, to recruit Bill Garrett, the first African American to play as a regular player on IU&#x27;s basketball team. (Garrett was also the first African American to regularly play on a Big Ten Conference basketball team.) In 1947, when the local barbers union refused to cut black students&#x27; hair in their off-campus shops during regular business hours, Wells leased the Indiana Memorial Union&#x27;s barbershop to a barber who agreed to accept black and white students as patrons. Soon, the local barbers changed their position and cut black students&#x27;s hair during regular business hours as well.

In addition to supporting IU students, Wells helped to advance academic freedom for IU faculty, especially when 
Alfred Kinsey, an IU professor during Wells&#x27;s tenure at the university, came under heavy scrutiny and criticism for his studies in human sexuality in the late 1940s and early 1950s. As a strong advocate of intellectual freedom, Wells staunchly supported Kinsey&#x27;s controversial sex research and withstood sharp criticism following the publication of Kinsey&#x27;s landmark studies on sexual behavior. &quot;I had early made up my mind that a university that bows to the wishes of a person, group, or segment of society is not free and that a state university in particular cannot expect to command the support of the public if it is the captive of any group,&quot; said Wells.

While Wells was serving as IU&#x27;s president, the university landholdings increased tenfold through acquisition of real estate to reach , its approximate, present-day size. In addition, numerous buildings were constructed on campus the Bloomington campus. Major projects included construction of the IU Auditorium, which opened on March 22, 1941, as the cornerstone of the university&#x27;s Fine Arts Plaza. The plaza was later expanded to include the Lilly Library, dedicated in 1969, and the Showalter Fountain, designed by sculptor and IU faculty member Robert Laurent and dedicated on October 22, 1961. Wells also worked with state government officials to transfer ownership of Thomas Hart Benton&#x27;s Indiana murals, which were initially created for and displayed at the Chicago Century of Progress International Exposition (World&#x27;s Fair) in 1933. Ownership of the murals was formally transferred to IU in 1938. The murals were incorporated into the design of the new IU Auditorium and installed in time for the building&#x27;s dedication in March 1941.

Despite rapid expansion and increasing demands for space and physical plant improvements, Wells remained a staunch proponent of the environment. He strongly advocated preserving trees and developed guidelines to establish a series of green spaces throughout the campus. Wells once said, &quot;To cut a tree unnecessarily has long been an act of treason against our heritage and the loyalty, love, and effort of our predecessors who have preserved it for us.&quot; As a direct result of these efforts, the IU campus at Bloomington is often considered one of the top five most beautiful campuses in the nation.

During his tenure as university president, Wells read and personally signed each diploma the university issued, a total of 62,621 diplomas, frequently adding personal notes. As Wells explained during his final IU commencement address as its president in 1962:

===IU chancellor===
Following Wells&#x27; retirement as IU&#x27;s president in 1962, at the age of sixty, the IU board of trustees created a new post of university chancellor especially for him. He accepted the appointment and held this honorary title until his death in 2000. His main roles in the post were special projects, fundraising, conferring with private donors, administrative duties, attending cultural and athletic events, and acting as senior adviser to the university. During his years as chancellor, Wells also wrote his autobiography, &quot;Being Lucky: Reminiscences and Reflections&quot; (1980).

Chancellor Wells continued to support the arts, including creation of IU&#x27;s Musical Arts Center, a performance space that opened in 1972, and the installation of &quot;Peau Rouge Indiana&quot;, an Alexander Calder stabile (abstract sculpture) in front of the MAC. In addition, the I. M. Pei architectural firm designed the IU Art Museum, dedicated in 1982, to complete the structures on the campus&#x27;s Fine Arts Plaza, whose development began during Wells&#x27;s tenure as IU&#x27;s president. For a brief period, from July to November 1968, Wells also served as IU&#x27;s interim president following the resignation of Elvis Jacob Stahr Jr., Well&#x27;s successor to the university&#x27;s presidency.

===IU Foundation leader===
During his tenure as IU&#x27;s president and university chancellor, Wells also had a leadership role at the IU Foundation, the fundraising division of the university. From 1937 to 1962 Wells held the dual offices of the foundation&#x27;s chairman of the board and president. He continued as the foundation&#x27;s president and vice chairman of the foundation&#x27;s board while serving as the university chancellor.

==Public service==
Aside from his activities at IU, Wells remained active in public service throughout his long career. In 1943–44 Wells worked for the U.S. State Department&#x27;s Office of Foreign Economic Cooperation in Washington, D.C. In 1944–45 he served as chair of the American Council on Education, and in 1946 Wells spent three months in Greece observing its democratic elections. In 1947–48 Wells was a cultural advisor to the allied military government in Germany following World War II. He also assisted in establishing the Free University of Berlin. In 1957 Wells was a delegate to the Twelfth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Wells served as chairman of the board of the Education and World Affairs organization from 1962 until 1970. He was also a consultant in higher education and traveled the world on behalf of IU&#x27;s international education projects.

Wells was a member and often assumed a leadership role in several educational foundations, including the Carnegie Foundation, the American Council on Education (1944–45), and the National Commission on Humanities (1964–65), among others. He was a member of presidential committees on overseas voluntary activities and U.S.-Soviet trade relations, as well as serving on several boards of directors, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (1936–71) and the Lilly Endowment (1972–2000). A recipient of numerous honors and awards, including twenty-eight honorary degrees, Wells received many tributes to his long career. IU student scholarships and student recognition awards, as well as memorials on the IU Bloomington campus and the main campus library are named in his honor. Wells was also the subject of a PBS documentary film. His autobiography, &quot;Being Lucky: Reminiscences and Reflections&quot;, was published in 1980.

==Art collector==
Wells began collecting antiques during his early years in Bloomington and continued to collect art and antiques throughout his life. Most of his collection was donated to various IU organizations on the Bloomington campus. In 2001 the IU Art Museum at Bloomington opened a temporary exhibition that featured some of Wells&#x27;s collections. One of the German paintings in the exhibition, &quot;Flagellation of Christ&quot; (ca. 1480s), also known as &quot;Geisselung Cristi&quot;, was subsequently returned to the Jagdschloss Grunewald, a small museum in Berlin, Germany. The oil-on-oil painting is attributed to the fifteenth-century German master of the Saint Goar altar. Wells donated the work to the IU Art Museum in 1985. According to IU, Wells purchased the late fifteenth-century painting in good faith from a London art gallery in 1967 and was unaware of its provenance. In 2004 representatives from Stiftung Preussische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg (Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg) informed the IU Art Museum that Allied soldiers had seized the painting from the Jagdschloss Grunewald museum in Berlin during the summer of 1945, at the end of World War II. In 2006, following extensive research of the painting&#x27;s provenance, the IU Art Museum agreed to return the painting to Berlin, stating it could not &quot;ethically retain this painting, which was unlawfully removed from the Jagdschloss Grunewald in 1945, in our collection.&quot; The painting remained at the IU Art Museum until 2010, while the Jagdschloss Grunewald was undergoing renovations.

==Later years==
Despite ill health, failing eyesight, and hearing loss as he approached his ninety-eighth birthday in 2000, Wells continued to maintain an office in Owen Hall on the IU Bloomington campus. Following his retirement as IU&#x27;s president, Wells resided at a home across the street from IU&#x27;s Main Library on East Tenth Street that he had purchased in 1962. Wells donated the home to the university with the condition that he be allowed to live there for the remainder of his life. In addition to maintaining his Tenth Street home in Bloomington, Wells purchased a condominium in Bloomington&#x27;s Meadowood retirement community when he was in his eighties. Wells rarely stayed overnight at his Meadowood property, preferring instead to use it as a woodland retreat and guesthouse. 
==Death and legacy==
Wells died at home in Bloomington on March 18, 2000, three months prior to his ninety-eighth birthday. His funeral was held at the First United Methodist Church in Bloomington on March 22, 2000, sixty-two years after his selection as president of the university. &quot;A Celebration of Life: Remembering Herman B Wells,&quot; his public memorial service, was held at the IU Auditorium on April 5, 2000. Wells&#x27;s remains are interred at Jamestown, Indiana, where he had spent his boyhood.

Wells had no children and never married, but he maintained an extensive network of contacts among friends and professional colleagues, as well as IU students, alumni, and faculty members. His contributions to IU were forged through his nearly eighty-year association with the university, beginning as a student in 1921 and continuing after he joined the faculty in 1930. During his years as president (1937–62) and university chancellor (1962–2000), Wells brought IU &quot;to the front ranks of American research universities&quot; through expanded enrollment, recruitment of new faculty, construction of new buildings, new program offerings, campus beautification projects, and steadfast support of its faculty and students. Wells also helped transform IU into &quot;a cosmopolitan center of learning with an international reputation&quot; and strengthened IU&#x27;s emphasis on research, cultivated the arts, expanded IU&#x27;s international programs and supported academic freedom. As Wells reflected on his twenty-five years as IU&#x27;s president, he remarked:

Wells&#x27;s bachelor status and support for Alfred Kinsey&#x27;s research sparked speculation he was a homosexual, but biographer James Capshew concluded that there was no evidence for or against this claim, writing that &quot;I haven’t found any evidence that Wells ever dated or had romantic or erotic relationships with women or men.&quot;

==Tributes==
* Since 1962, The Herman B Wells Senior Recognition Award is given annually to an IU senior who exhibits a strong academic record, as well as leadership and service to the IU Bloomington campus.
* On June 15, 1973, the International Astronomical Union confirmed that minor planet 1721 (approximately in diameter) within the constellation of Leo was officially named &quot;Wells.&quot;
* The Herman B Wells Scholar Program, which the IU Foundation established when Wells was in his eighties, provides four-year academic scholarships to a selective group of IU Bloomington students. The program&#x27;s first group of scholarship recipients arrived on campus in 1990. 
* In 1991, the Indiana University School of Medicine named their pediatric research center in honor of Wells.
* &quot;The Vision of Herman B Wells&quot; (1993), a PBS documentary of Well&#x27;s life, was directed by Eugene &quot;Gino&quot; Brancolini.
* On October 21, 2000, a bronze statue of Wells by Tuck Langland, a professor of art at IU&#x27;s South Bend campus, was unveiled in the historic, Old Crescent area of the Bloomington campus. The life-sized statue portrays Wells in middle age, seated on a park bench. Two additional benches, brick paving stones, and a low, limestone wall complete the memorial, which is known as the Wells Plaza. 
* In 2001 the IU Art Museum at Bloomington opened a temporary exhibition, &quot;Living with Art: The Legacy of Herman B Wells,&quot; which included selections of Wells&#x27;s art and antiques collections.
* On June 17, 2005, IU dedicated its Main Library in Bloomington as the Herman B Wells Library. The university had to wait five years after Wells&#x27;s death in order to name the library in his honor due to a university policy that Wells had put in place when he was chair of IU&#x27;s naming committee. The policy required sufficient time to pass before naming a building in order to determine whether the name would endure or fall out of fashion. A bronze bust of Wells by sculptor Marc Mellon is installed in the library&#x27;s lobby.
* Herman Wells is portrayed in the 2004 movie &quot;Kinsey&quot;.

<text>Brontë Waterfall on the South Dean Beck is about a mile south-west of Stanbury, near Haworth in West Yorkshire, England. Beck is a dialect word for a stream.
The waterfall is known to have been appreciated by the Brontë sisters.

The area surrounding the waterfall is mainly moorland and farmland in Brontë Country, an area famous for its association with the sisters. There is a plaque with a quotation from Psalm 104 (How manifold are Thy works...), evidently referring to the natural beauty of the site.

Below the falls is Brontë Bridge, an old stone bridge across the beck. A flash flood in May 1989, swept the bridge away. In March 1990, a Lynx helicopter from No. 9 Regiment Army Air Corps, airlifted five gritstone slabs into the narrow valley to allow park rangers to repair the crossing.

== Brontë Way ==
The waterfall can be reached on a waymarked route from Haworth, part of the Brontë Way. 
There are bilingual English-Japanese signs.

Continuing upwards from the waterfall, Top Withens can be reached on the same walk. The location of the ruined farmhouse is reputed to have been the inspiration for the setting of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, the Emily Brontë&#x27;s only novel published in 1847.

<text>Maurolycus is one of the more prominent lunar impact craters in the southern highland region of the Moon that is covered in overlapping crater impacts. It was named after 16th century Italian mathematician Francesco Maurolico. It is joined at the southeast rim by the smaller crater Barocius. Due west lie the overlapping pair of Stöfler and Faraday. To the northeast is the faint crater Buch, and further to the north lies Gemma Frisius.

The outer walls of Maurolycus are tall, wide, and terraced, most notably in the eastern part. To the southeast the rim is lower and the crater is joined to what has the appearance of an overlain crater rim. The crater Maurolycus F lies across the northwest rim, and that part of the crater floor is more rugged than the remainder. The other sections of the floor are relatively level, with a complex of central peaks and a pair of craterlets. The small crater Maurolycus A is biting into the southern part of the rim.
==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Maurolycus.

<doc id="990991" wikidata="Q6917516" url="?curid=990991" title="Motherhead Bug">
<text>Motherhead Bug was an American folk punk band, founded in 1989 in New York City by singer and trombone player David Ouimet and bass guitarist Tony Lee.

==Band history==
Ouimet had earlier founded industrial rock group Cop Shoot Cop, and Lee was a member of blues rockers Railroad Jerk.

The group was rather large, featuring three drummers, as well as string and horn sections, with accordions, xylophones and other unusual instruments featured prominently. The music is somewhat similar to Tom Waits&#x27; post-&quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;, but also touched on music hall songs, nursery rhymes, marching bands, and earned comparisons to the Penguin Cafe Orchestra.

Motherhead Bug released only two singles and one full-length album, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Zambodia&quot;, recorded by Brooklyn-based producer Martin Bisi. The album was dedicated to saxophonist Masami Shinoda. One critic described &quot;Zambodia&quot; as follows: &quot;The instrumentation and Ouimet&#x27;s theatrical vocals lend a decadent grandeur to Weill-esque numbers like &#x27;Demon Erection&#x27; and &#x27;My Sweet Milstar.&#x27; It may be burlesque, but it&#x27;s still pretty scary stuff.&quot;

==Aftermath==
The project was abandoned after &quot;Zambodia&quot;&#x27;s release due to the inability to manage so many band members. Ouimet stopped writing music and focused on working on children&#x27;s books, although he would occasionally appear as a guest musician. He would not work as a full-time member of a band until the release of Firewater&#x27;s &quot;Get Off the Cross...&quot; album in 1996. Michele Amar&#x27;s similar musical project, Sulfur, released &quot;Delirium Tremens&quot; in 1998 which was co-written by Ouimet and featured some of the same musicians that performed on &quot;Zambodia&quot;.

<doc id="990994" wikidata="Q13533379" url="?curid=990994" title="Heimia">
<text>Heimia is a genus of flowering plants in the loosestrife family, Lythraceae. It contains two or three species of closely related shrubs commonly known as sun opener or shrubby yellowcrest. They are native to the Americas, from northern Argentina north to the southernmost United States (southern Texas). The leaves are 2–5 cm long and 1 cm broad, entire, and variably arranged alternate, opposite or whorled on the stems. All species produce five-petaled yellow flowers. The plants have a history of medicinal use in a variety of American cultures. Several pharmacologically active alkaloids have been detected in the plants. The generic names honours German physician Ernst Ludwig Heim (1747–1834).

==Species==

The genus contains three species. They are similar to the extent that expert knowledge is required to differentiate between specimens of the different species. The alkaloid contents of specimens of all three species has been studied, and although similar, they have been found to be chemically distinct.

===&quot;Heimia myrtifolia&quot;===
&quot;Heimia myrtifolia&quot; is a shrub growing to 1 m tall. The yellow flowers are 5 petaled and 1 cm in diameter. The leaves are approximately 5 mm wide by 2–3 cm long.

===&quot;Heimia salicifolia&quot;===
&quot;Heimia salicifolia&quot;, commonly known as Sinicuichi, is a shrub growing to 3 m tall. The yellow flowers are 5 petaled and 2–3 cm in diameter. The leaves are approximately 1 cm wide and 3–5 cm long.

===&quot;Heimia montana&quot;===

== Secondary metabolites ==
The alkaloid content is similar between the species in the genus. The following substances have been detected in &quot;Heimia salicifolia&quot;:

=== Alkaloids ===

* 9-&quot;beta&quot;-Hydroxyvertine
* (2&quot;S&quot;,4&quot;S&quot;,10&quot;R&quot;)-4-(3-Hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-quinolizidin-2-acetate
* Lythrine
* Dehydrodecodine
* Lythridine
* Cryogenine
* Heimidine
* Lyfoline
* epi-Lyfoline
* Sinicuichine
* Nesodine
* Abresoline
* Anelisine
* Lythridine (sinine) 

== History ==

&quot;Heimia myrtifolia&quot; and &quot;Heimia salicifolia&quot; are often reported to have hallucinogenic effects. This controversial attribution of effects appears to be traceable back to a publication by J. B. Calderón in 1896 who wrote that it was said to possess a &quot;curious and unique physiological action ... people drinking either a decoction or the juice of the plant have a pleasant drunkenness ... all objects appear yellow and the sounds of bells, human voices or any other reach their ears as if coming from a long distance.&quot;

Calderón actually tested the plant and did not experience any noticeable effects. Through a series of exaggerating and dramatizing citations, especially by Victor A. Reko in the first half of the last century, the plant became known as a hallucinogen despite that psychoactive properties of the plant have never been demonstrated. The mildly psychoactive effects described in the original publication have therefore been attributed to a sedative principle or unknown other contents of the brew or, simply, to its alcohol content.

In 1926, Reko observed that the native people of Mexico also called the stem and bark of &quot;Erythrina coralloides&quot;, the bark of &quot;Piscidia erythrina&quot;, and the seeds of &quot;Rhynochosia praecatoria&quot; by the name of &quot;sinicuichi&quot;, which may have contributed to the scientific confusion.

==Cultivation==
The species make attractive ornamental plants, flowering in late summer. Although only growing as a shrub in subtropical climates, it can also be grown as a herbaceous perennial in colder areas where the above-ground growth is killed by winter cold. The plants produce very many tiny seeds which are easily cultivated. Both species prefer well-drained soil with a good supply of water.

<text>Orontius is a lunar impact crater that lies in the heavily cratered southern highlands of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It was named after 16th century French mathematician Oronce Fine. It is located to the northwest of the prominent ray crater Tycho, and south and east of the large walled plain Deslandres. The eastern part of the crater is overlain by the smaller crater Huggins, which is overlain in turn on its eastern rim by the still smaller Nasireddin, the trio forming a crater chain of diminishing dimensions. Joined to the southern rim is the crater Saussure. To the southwest, just east of Tycho, is Pictet.

The rim of Orontius is battered, worn, and overlain by a number of different craters. A pair of craters to the west have intruded into the crater wall, forming inward bulges. Little of the original wall remains nearly intact, with the south and southwestern rim having survived the erosion process better than the other wall sections.

The southwest half of the crater floor is still fairly flat and marred only by a few small craterlets. In the north of the crater, the distorted feature Orontius F forms a distorted, crater-like oval.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Orontius.

<text>The Contrôle officiel suisse des Chronomètres (COSC), the Official Swiss Chronometer Testing Institute, is the institute responsible for certifying the accuracy and precision of Swiss watches.

==Background==
Founded in its current form in 1973, the COSC is a Swiss non-profit organization that tests chronometers that are Swiss Made. &quot;COSC&quot; is an acronym for the organization&#x27;s French language name, Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres.

COSC testing generally applies to watches manufactured or assembled in Switzerland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview de Pierre-Yves Soguel Directeur https://forumamontres.forumactif.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding, the normative standards are set by international agreement and are the same whether they are nominally labeled ISO or DIN standards. Some German, Japanese, and even non-certified Swiss movements can surpass the normative requirements. The Japanese have largely abandoned the accolade, replacing it with in-house testing to a slightly more strict standard as with, for example, the Grand Seiko. On the other hand, the Germans have set up their own testing facility in Saxony at the Glashütte Observatory where the DIN 8319 standards, which mirror the ISO standards used by COSC, are employed. At one time the French provided similar large scale testing at the Observatory at Besançon, however, today only a very few watches are currently tested there and carry the accolade &quot;Observatory Chronometer&quot;.

The organization was founded by five watchmaking cantons of Switzerland: Bern, Geneva, Neuchâtel, Solothurn and Vaud, together with the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry (FHS). It encompasses the laboratories and observatories that had been created independently of each other from the late 19th century.

Three laboratories now test the movements submitted by individual watch manufacturers to be granted chronometer status. They are in Biel/Bienne, Saint-Imier/BE and Le Locle. The Saint-Imier and Biel laboratories are almost entirely devoted to testing Rolex movements. Although not all Rolex watches are chronometers, Breitling has claimed that since 2000 all of its production is COSC certified. Omega also has much of its production certified. Thus, based upon the movements used by Rolex, Breitling, and Omega, the movement calibers that obtain most of the COSC certificates are the Rolex 3135 (since 1988) (and variants 3155, 3175, 3185, 4130) and 2235, the ETA 2892A2 (and variants) and Valjoux 7750, each of which operates at 28,800 beats per hour. Tag Heuer and Ball watches both have select watches designated as chronometers which are sent to COSC for certification.

== Standards and methods ==

Each officially COSC certified chronometer is identified by a serial number engraved on its movement and a certification number given by the COSC.

Testing criteria are based on ISO 3159 (Timekeeping instruments — Wrist-chronometers with spring balance oscillator) which defines a wrist chronometer with spring-balance oscillator. Only movements which meet the precision criteria established under ISO 3159 are granted an official chronometer certificate. (Compare ISO 3158.) The certificate is valid for the bare movement prior to casing, and only when freshly serviced or assembled. Pre-owned and vintage chronometers generally require a complete service in order to be restored to COSC-levels of performance.

Each uncased movement is individually tested for fifteen days, in five positions, at three different temperatures. The movements are fitted with a seconds hand and the automatic winding mechanisms are disengaged for the tests. Measurements are made daily with the aid of cameras. Based on these measurements, seven eliminatory criteria are calculated, each of which must be met (e.g., for movements of a diameter over 20 mm, the requirements, indicated in seconds/day, are noted in the table below). The testing protocol requires daily winding at precisely the same time each day. There is no ISO standard for quartz timepieces, but there is development in this field. ISO 10553:2018 specifies the procedure for evaluating the accuracy of quartz watches, individually and by lot, and the relationship between the accuracy tested and the accuracy classification given by the manufacturer. It applies to quartz watches having accompanying documents on which the accuracy classification is indicated. Nevertheless, COSC has also developed its own standard for testing quartz chronometers with eight eliminatory criteria, also noted in the table below. To acquire the COSC chronometer label, a quartz instrument must benefit from thermo-compensation and rigorous encapsulation.

A COSC certified mechanical chronometer is tested for 15 days and checked with two key pieces of data:
* temperature 
* the position of the movement (3 o’clock, 6 o’clock, 9 o’clock, dial on top, dial on the bottom)
A COSC certified quartz chronometer is tested for 13 days, in one position, at 3 different temperatures and 4 different relative humidity levels.

Measurements are compared with a time base established by two independent atomic clocks synchronized on GPS time. Not all chronometers are supplied with the report issued by the COSC as the reports are optional to the brand or maker. Each manufacturer may decide whether to reveal the results gathered during the certification process of the movement. For example, Breitling do supply all their watches with COSC certificates (all Breitling watches since 2000 are certified chronometers) however Rolex and Omega do not supply even their chronometer certified watches (not all their watches are certified chronometers) with the COSC certificates. Omega however can provide the COSC chronometer certificate if asked.

==Observatory trials and standards before 1973==
While competitive chronometer testing took place at the observatories in Neuchâtel (1866–1975) and Geneva (1873–1967), testing of large numbers of watches intended for public sale was conducted by the independent &quot;Bureaux officiels de contrôle de la marche des montres&quot; (B.O.s) established between 1877 and 1956. Between 1961 and 1973, “a chronometer [was] a precision watch, which [was] regulated in several positions and at different temperatures and which had received a certificate [from the (“B.O.)].&quot; Collective certificates, rather than individual certificates, were usually issued. The 1961–73 standard required a mean daily rate in five positions of −1/+10. In 1973, the B.O.’s came under the C.O.S.C. which specified a daily rate of −4/+6 sec.

==The value of COSC certification==
===Only fractions of Swiss Watch production are COSC certified===
Over a million official chronometer certificates are delivered each year, representing only 3% of the Swiss watch production. To earn chronometer certification, the movement must be entered for, and pass the test, which must be paid for.

Of Swiss made mechanical watches, approximately 5% are chronometer certified by the COSC and of the Swiss made quartz watches, approximately 0.2% are chronometer certified by the COSC.

===Meaningful test or marketing gimmick?===
There is a debate among watch enthusiasts as to whether the COSC chronometer certification for a Swiss watch is a meaningful test or a simple marketing gimmick. On the one hand, when a watch maker intends to submit a movement for COSC testing, they frequently employ additional jewelling (i.e. to the barrel) and better quality &quot;Ébauche&quot; parts (i.e. higher quality hairsprings, mainsprings, balance wheels; regulators, etc.) all aimed at the coveted chronometer certification. On the other hand, it is likely that most good quality movements on the market today are capable of being tweaked, and timed to fall comfortably within the benchmark -4/+6 average daily rate criteria of the COSC. 

Therefore, some of the ″Haute Horlogerie″ Swiss Watch Manufacturers have created on 5 June 2001, ″The Fleurier Quality Foundation″ (permanently closed) to establish new aesthetic and technical criteria dedicated to the certification of finished watches. Their certification meets a normative requirement for the market and the final customer to have a better definition of quality watchmaking, adapted to today&#x27;s demands and technological advances. Geneva&#x27;s have created along similar criteria the Geneva seal.

====Exemplar brands submitting to COSC====
Rolex by far submits the largest number of movements to COSC, over a million a year, followed by Omega, Tudor, Breitling, Mido and Tissot.
 Rolex and Breitling submit all movements for certification, but other manufacturers only submit certain models.

===Certification in perspective===
Fine regulation and chronometer characteristics of a watch can be destroyed in seconds by a rough and inexperienced hand.
Considering the fact that mechanical watches are almost never used for real timekeeping and navigation anymore, certification may be considered a historic relic by some, but it verifies the accuracy and quality of a mechanical movement.

==Additional METAS Master Chronometer certification==
===METAS N001 &quot;Master Chronometer&quot; certification===
The Swiss Federal Institute of Metrology (METAS) has developed new stricter standard METAS N001 requirements for movements and mechanical watches resistant to magnetic fields of 1.5 T (15,000 G). Mechanical watches are put to the test during 10 test cycles which will consider in particular the resistance to magnetic fields, the precision of the rate (watch drift over 24 hours) and the water resistance of the watch. Unlike the ISO 3159 Timekeeping instruments — Wrist-chronometers with spring balance oscillator standard, it is no longer just the uncased movements that are tested, but completely assembled watches.

===Part A - Technical requirements===
The first condition is that the watch must be &quot;Swiss Made&quot; and meet the requirements set by the ordinance regulating the use of the name &quot;Switzerland&quot; for watches (RS 232.119), in its latest version in force. In addition, the movement must already be certified as a &quot;Chronometer&quot; and must therefore follow, in a laboratory, the tests defined in the ISO 3159 standard. Finally, the movement and the watch must be subjected to 10 test cycles and satisfy to the 8 technical criteria of the METAS Requirements. The 10 test cycles are operations to be performed on each movement and each watch and make it possible to obtain the values necessary for the calculation of the 8 criteria. Among these, two are particularly demanding for the watch manufacturer, and therefore interesting for the end customer. It is first the average daily precision in 6 positions and 2 temperatures, over 4 days (4 × 24 hours). A user is simulated who wears the watch on their wrist in different positions of their arm; the 2 temperatures represent the temperature when the watch is worn by the user (approx. 33 °C) and when the watch is removed (approx. 23 °C). According to the acceptance criteria of the requirements, the watch must remain within the tolerances [between 0/≤5 seconds]. That is, the watch should not delay at all, and the upper limit is 5 seconds fast in 24 hours. The criterion of resistance to magnetic fields is innovative. Until now, the ISO 764 Horology — Magnetic resistant watches standard defines that an antimagnetic watch must support a magnetic field of 4,800 A/m, which corresponds to 60 gauss. METAS certification subjects watches and movements to 15,000 gauss (1.5 tesla).

===Part B - Organizational requirements===
Checks are carried out on 100% of the watches by an independent testing laboratory or by the manufacturer. For METAS to ensure that these measurements are always correct, a plan to monitor the testing process has been put in place. The organizational requirements are as follows:
* A statistical analysis of the results of the measurements of the test laboratory
* A control by sampling carried out in a METAS laboratory
* Periodic audits of the test laboratory by METAS-Cert
A laboratory of METAS was created to carry out checks on the watches to be certified. A sampling of the watches will be checked by METAS. METAS results and those of the test laboratory are then compared. When all the requirements of parts A and B have been fulfilled, a watch is entitled to bear the designation &quot;Master Chronometer&quot;.

===METAS infrastructure===
The main devices are used to measure instantaneous rate (Witschi M10 Chronoscope) and daily precision (Qualima-test). These two measurements are used to indicate how much the watch is advancing or losing compared to a reference clock. Instant running achieves this over short periods of time (30 seconds) while the daily precision is taken between 23 and 26 hours. The highlights of this certification are in particular the test of the resistance of the watch in relation to magnetic fields and the tight limits for the average daily precision. This being the case, the totality of the checks (magnetism, operation, and water resistance) guarantees a very high-quality mechanical watch for the end customer.

Mechanical watches can be first COSC ISO 3159 &quot;Chronometer&quot; certified and after that METAS N001 &quot;Master Chronometer&quot; certified when all the relevant requirements are met. The first mechanical watches that met the METAS Certified Master Chronometer requirements featured Omega 8900 series automatic movements.

<text>The British Rail Class 31 diesel locomotives, also known as the Brush Type 2 and previously as Class 30, were built by Brush Traction from 1957 to 1962. They were numbered in two series, D5500-D5699 and D5800-D5862. Construction of the first locomotive was completed in the final week of September 1957, and the handing-over took place on 31 October. The first Class 31 entered service in November 1957, after the launch of the Class 20 locomotive and was one of the Pilot Scheme locomotives ordered by British Railways to replace steam traction.

==Engines==
They were originally built with Mirrlees JVS12T (D5500–D5519) and engines and Brush electrical equipment, but the engines were not successful and in 1964 D5677 was fitted with an English Electric 12SVT engine (similar to the 12CSVT used in the Class 37 but without an intercooler) rated at . The trial proved successful, and between 1965 and 1969 the entire class was re-engined. The de-rated engine was used as it was the maximum the electrical system could accept.

==Classification==
The Mirrlees-engined locomotives were originally known as Class 30 under TOPS, with re-engined examples joining Class 31. The class was originally intended for service on the Eastern Region, but gradually became common in both the Western and London Midland regions too.

===Sub-classes===
Several sub-classes of Class 31 exist:
* 31/0 - First batch of locos, fitted with Red Circle electro-magnetic control equipment - withdrawn in the late 1970s as non-standard. RA 5
* 31/1 - The standard locomotive, fitted with Blue Star electro-pneumatic control. RA 5
* 31/4 - As Class 31/1 but fitted with Brush Electric train heating (ETH) apparatus, index 66. RA 6
* 31/5 - Former 31/4 with the ETH isolated for Civil Engineers Department use. RA 6
* 31/6 - Standard locomotive through wired for ETH but without ETH apparatus. RA 5

====Class 31/0====

These first 20 locomotives, originally numbered D5500–D5519, were always easily recognisable as they did not have the headcode box mounted on the roof above the cab, leading to the nickname &quot;Skinheads&quot;. They were also nicknamed &quot;Gurglers&quot; from the noise of their engines, and &quot;Toffee Apples&quot; from the shape of the control key which had to be taken from cab to cab when changing ends. These pilot scheme locomotives were non-standard in having Electro-Magnetic Multiple-Working control equipment, and were limited to . After being involved in a serious collision D5518 was rebuilt in September 1967 as a standard locomotive, with indicator boxes, and blue star coupling code.

They were allocated to East Anglian sheds throughout their service, ending up allocated to Stratford, their initial shed, and latterly sporting that depot&#x27;s trademark silver roof. Upon withdrawal four locomotives were converted at Stratford into train pre-heating units. Locomotives 31013, 31002, 31014 and 31008 were renumbered ADB968013 to ADB968016 in the order given; ADB968014 was allocated to Bounds Green depot on the Great Northern main line and ADB968015 was based at Great Yarmouth, while the remaining two were allocated to Stratford.

====Class 31/1====
The first few locos externally had much in common with the original 31/0s as twenty lacked the roof mounted headcode box (D5520–29/35/39/42/47/51/52/55/56/59/62), and fifteen were also limited to (D5520–D5534), but were otherwise the same as subsequent locos. The whole sub-class had steam heating boilers fitted, had the Blue Star Electro-Pneumatic multiple-working controls as found on many other BR classes. The Class 31/1s could be found on a variety of secondary and relief passenger duties as well as parcels and freight traffic. While used in East Anglia, with locos allocated to Stratford and March depots, they were found throughout the Eastern Region of BR with Finsbury Park sporting a large allocation along with the depots at Tinsley, Immingham and Thornaby. Locos were also allocated to Bristol Bath Road and Old Oak Common on the Western Region, where they could be found working passenger trains as far west as Barnstaple and Paignton. In the early 1980s Healey Mills and Bescot on the Midland Region also gained an allocation as replacements for Class 25s.

====Class 31/4====

The Class 31/4s, numbered from 31400 to 31469, were conversions of 31/1s to which electric train heating (ETH) was fitted. They had an ETH index of 66, equivalent to 330 kW, which was sufficient to power trains of up to eleven Mk 3 carriages. This allowed them to pre-heat long trains moving between depot and a station for a service to be worked by a larger locomotive. When passenger services were worked by 31/4s they rarely exceeded four or five carriages. 330 kW accounted for about a third of the total electrical power output. When ETH was being supplied, the traction power output of the 31/4 subclass was therefore limited to around two-thirds of that of the non-ETH variants; this did not help the performance of an already somewhat underpowered locomotive.
====Class 31/5====

In the late 1980s with increased use of &quot;Sprinter&quot; type units on previously loco hauled diagrams, there were ETH fitted Locomotives to spare and with this in mind, some Class 31s were selected to have their ETH cables removed from the front buffer beam. This was done to try to prevent passenger sectors of BR borrowing the locomotives from the Freight sectors, and to cut down on maintenance of surplus equipment. The re-numbering was achieved by simply adding 100 to the existing TOPS number i.e. 31407 became 31507. When the re-numbering was taking place, most locos were still in standard BR Blue livery and the 4 in the number was painted over and a 5 placed over the top. Some of the sub-class were painted into Civil Engineers all over Grey livery, although most were subsequently painted into the &quot;Dutch&quot; Yellow and Grey livery. Only 31530 (&quot;Sister Dora&quot;), 31544 (&quot;Keighley and Worth Valley Railway&quot;) and 31568 (&quot;The Engineman’s Fund&quot;) were named when numbered as a 31/5. 31544 was also notable as the only one of the sub-class with the original &quot;skinhead&quot; style cabs without the route indicators on the roof.

====Class 31/6====
Only two locomotives (31601 and 31602, formerly 31186 and 31191 respectively ) received this modification, performed during their time with Fragonset Railways. This modification means they are through wired for Electric Train Heating (ETH) but cannot actually provide it. This means they can be coupled to a train behind another locomotive, and the front locomotive is still able to heat the train via the wiring on the 31/6. 31601 is now preserved at the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway where it regularly operates trains while 31602 was scrapped after being withdrawn.

==Operation==
Initial deliveries of Class 31/0 locomotives were to Stratford depot in east London and deliveries continued with Class 31/1 locos going to the Eastern and North Eastern regions. Class 31s were first used on the Western Region in 1969 when D5535 was allocated to Old Oak Common to work Empty Coaching Stock (ECS) trains into Paddington.

==Nicknames==
The class were given a number of nicknames. The Class 31/0s were known as &quot;Toffee Apples&quot;, due to the shape of the control lever. More common names for the whole class were &quot;Goyles&quot; (short for &quot;gargoyles&quot; referring to the ugliness of the design), &quot;Peds&quot; (&quot;Another derogatory name associating the locomotives with pedal cars in terms of speed and pulling power&quot;) and &quot;Gurglers&quot;, after the sound they made.

==Accidents and incidents==

* On 11 September 1975, 31150 was involved in a head-on collision at Corby Tunnel, with a loose brake van and coke wagons. This locomotive was the first of the class to be withdrawn.
* On 3 January 1976, locomotive 31241 was hauling a parcels train when a light engine ran into its rear at Worcester Tunnel Junction. Time interval working was in force at the time.
* On 25 February 1979, locomotive 31421 was hauling an engineering train that was working under a possession between and , Hampshire. The adjacent line was open to traffic. A crane in the engineering train was foul of the other line when it was struck by a passing passenger train. One person was killed and nine were injured.
* On 9 March 1986, locomotive 31436 was hauling a passenger train that was in a head-on collision with two light engines at , Derbyshire due to a signalman&#x27;s error. One person was killed. Lack of training and a power cut were contributory factors.
* On 20 February 1987, a freight train ran away and was derailed by trap points at North Junction, Chinley. Locomotive 31440 was hauling a train that collided with the wreckage.
* On 28 October 1988 two unmanned Class 31 locos (31202 and 31226), presumably with brakes not fully applied, rolled off together along a short siding at North London&#x27;s Staples Corner. After demolishing the buffer stop they ran down the embankment on to the North Circular Road, although nobody was hurt. The second loco of the pair landed on the roof of the leading one, remaining precariously balanced. They were both withdrawn after the incident.

==Commercial operators==
===Eastern Rail Services===
In 2022 the only operational class 31/4 outside preservation was 31452 which is based at Great Yarmouth.

===English, Welsh &amp; Scottish===
Before the introduction of Class 66, English Welsh &amp; Scottish (EWS) took control of the Class 31s from the Mainline Freight and Trainload Freight companies. 31255 became the locomotive for the EWS livery paint trials but never ran on the main line and spent its life at Toton until being preserved in January 1999. 31466 was repainted into EWS colours for the Toton TMD open day in May 1998 and soon became the only one of the class to be in traffic running in the EWS colours until being preserved in February 2001. In their final days of EWS ownership, 31110 (scrapped at TJ Thompson&#x27;s, Stockton in April 2007) was repainted into BR green in the summer of 1999 and featured its original number D5528 to mark the end of their working lives with EWS and worked the last EWS Class 31 hauled railtour. The final four EWS locomotives were withdrawn in February 2001. Of the two EWS liveried locos, both 31255 and 31466 are preserved, 31255 based at the Mid Norfolk Railway and 31466 based at the Dean Forest Railway.

===FM Rail===

In 1998, Fragonset Railways purchased four redundant Class 31 locomotives from EWS. The first of these, 31452, was quickly repaired and repainted in a new black livery with a red mid-body band. It was quickly followed by 31459 and 31468. Several more locomotives were also purchased, and in 1999, the first of two modified Class 31/6 locomotives re-entered traffic.
The Class 31/6 31601 (ex 31186) &amp; 31602 (ex 31191) subclass is essentially a modified Class 31/1 locomotive with through electric-train heating wiring. This enables a Class 31/4 and Class 31/6 to work in multiple and still heat the train, even if the no-heat Class 31/6 is attached to the carriages.

In 1999, Fragonset won a short-term contract with Silverlink for two locomotives to work in top and tail mode with two Mk. 1 carriages on the Marston Vale Line. This was to cover for the non-availability of Class 117 and Class 121 diesel multiple units. The trial was a success, and in 2000 it was repeated in the summer timetable. The locomotives were retained until displaced by more modern Class 150/1 units cascaded from Central Trains.

By this time, the Fragonset Class 31 fleet had expanded considerably to include three Class 31/1s, three Class 31/4s and two Class 31/6 locomotives. Regular work at this time included use hauling Class 317 electric multiple units from West Anglia Great Northern&#x27;s Hornsey depot to Bedford for use with Thameslink. As units were still maintained at Hornsey, this meant regular workings between the two depots to swap units when maintenance was due. 31468 was broken up for spares, finally being scrapped 6 June 2018.

===Hanson and Hall===
Created in 2018, in 2022 Hanson and Hall had one of the three remaining operational Class 31s outside preservation. 31106 was stored at Bury on the East Lancashire Railway in Rail Blue livery.

===Mainline Rail===
After the demise of FM Rail, several of its Class 31s passed to Mainline Rail, operated by RMS Locotec. As of November 2008, four 31/4s and one 31/6 were owned by RMS Locotec, which is a subsidiary of British American Railway Services.

===Nemesis Rail===
31128, an ex-Fragonset locomotive, is owned by Nemesis Rail and based at Burton upon Trent. In 2022 this locomotive is one of only three remaining operational Class 31s outside of preservation, and has been returned to BR Blue livery.

===Network Rail===

Network Rail operated a fleet of four Class 31 locomotives31105, 31233, 31285, and 31465to haul test trains around the network. The locomotives were purchased from Fragonset Railways, and overhauled at its Derby workshops. They were repainted in Network Rail&#x27;s then new all-over yellow livery. 31285 and 31465 were offered for sale by tender in July 2015, and 31233 and 31105 in August 2018.

Prior to operating its own locomotives, Network Rail&#x27;s predecessor, Railtrack, had hired two Class 31 locomotives from Fragonset. These two locomotives, 31190 and 31601, were repainted in Railtrack&#x27;s blue and lime green livery. With the overhaul and entry into service of Network Rail&#x27;s own locomotives, these two engines were returned to Fragonset. (They are now owned by British American Railway Services, based at Washwood Heath in Birmingham.)

Locomotive 31106, formerly &quot;Spalding Town&quot;, is privately owned by Howard Johnston, and after a period of lease to Fragonset, FM Rail, and RVEL which included extensive main line running for 11 years, including working as far north as Oban in Scotland, is based at the Weardale Railway. After inspection, it was successfully started on 17 October 2017 and moved under its own power for the first time in four years. Johnston purchased three more of the class from EWS, but they acquired new owners; 31107 (scrapped by C F Booth at Rotherham in May 2009, following a staged collision with a Renault Espace on a level crossing during &quot;Top Gear&quot; Series 9, Episode 5 in 2006 to demonstrate the danger of trying to beat a train at a crossing), 31289 (preserved at the Northampton and Lamport Railway), and 31301 (scrapped).

The last active Network Rail Class 31 was 31233, with it operating its last test trains in March 2017. In August 2018, Network Rail offered its final two Class 31s (31105 and 31233) for sale; both were purchased for preservation at Mangapps Railway Museum in Essex.

== Preservation ==
===Currently preserved===
36 members of the class have survived into preservation. This number includes both the first and last produced (31018 and 31327, respectively). There were a further 10 which have subsequently been scrapped.

===Preserved then scrapped===
In addition, the following locomotives were previously preserved, but have since been scrapped.
* 31113 ex-Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway - scrapped in June 2008 at EMR Kingsbury after death of owner

On 21 August 2006, Network Rail and the BBC Television programme &quot;Top Gear&quot; staged and filmed a crash between a Class 31 locomotive (31107) and a family car in order to promote rail safety. The off-limits event was the first of its type for 10 years and took place at Hibaldstow level crossing near Scawby in Lincolnshire, where the B1206 road crosses the Barnetby–Gainsborough railway line. Two Class 31 locomotives and a parked Renault Espace were used during the crash. Network Rail&#x27;s 31233 was used to propel 31107 up to a speed of . The rear locomotive slowed down to a stop and 31107 continued to coast at a speed of 70–80 miles per hour into the road vehicle parked across the eastbound &#x27;up&#x27; line. For the crash, locomotive 31107 received a special black livery with the slogan &quot;Level crossings — Don&#x27;t run the risk&quot; along the side in white lettering. The final 5 minute segment was originally scheduled for 4 February 2007 but was rescheduled, apparently due to a fatal crossing crash at Dingwall two days earlier. It was eventually aired on BBC Two on 25 February 2007, shortly after the Grayrigg derailment. A repeat of the programme was pulled following a further level-crossing accident.

Locomotive 31120 appears in The Railway Series book &quot;Gordon the High Speed Engine&quot;.

==Model railways==

In 1962 Tri-ang launched its first version of the BR Class 30 (with headcode boxes) in OO gauge. Airfix model railways also chose to produce a Class 31 when Airfix entered the model train market in 1975. Lima also produced a OO scale model, in both &quot;skinhead&quot; and headcode box versions. Hornby have produced a finescale OO scale model since 2004; both body styles are available in various liveries. Hornby have also produced a basic representation of the prototype as part of their Railroad range in BR Blue, and BR Green whilst past examples have carried a variety of liveries. On 23 February 2022 Accurascale announced their own OO model, due out in 2023.

In the 1970s, Lima produced British N gauge models of the Class 31 in BR blue and BR green. In 2010, following Bachmann&#x27;s acquisition of Graham Farish, the earlier Graham Farish Class 31 model was issued in BR green with a new chassis. In 2017, Graham Farish introduced a British N gauge model of the refurbished Class 31.

In 2013, Heljan introduced O gauge models of the Class 31 in BR blue and BR green liveries.

<doc id="991027" wikidata="Q7203240" url="?curid=991027" title="Playdays">
<text>Playdays (known as Playbus until December 1989) is a British pre-school television programme which ran from 1988 to 1997 on Children&#x27;s BBC. The show was the successor to &quot;Play School&quot; and, like its predecessor, was designed as an educational programme.

The show&#x27;s name was changed after the BBC received a complaint from the National Playbus Association.

In 2002, reruns were moved to the new CBeebies channel until August 2004.

==The stops==
The show begins with an animated title sequence of the Playbus driving along until it reached the bus stop. The bus stopped at a different place each day.

===Monday – The Why Bird Stop===
Why Bird lived at the Lost Property Office, where things that were left on the Playbus were filed until someone claimed them. She interacted with the human bus driver – there were several throughout the series. She had a special computer called the Why-Tech, which had a variety of uses: it could provide music for songs, pictures for stories, instructions for making something in keeping with the programme&#x27;s theme, or to help sing a song (e.g. paper sugar buns for &quot;Five Currant Buns&quot;). In later episodes, the office became more like a warehouse, called &quot;Why&#x27;s Workshop&quot;.

There were at least five different Why-Techs used over the years. The first one had a brown wood effect and was used until 1990. The second one was remote-controlled and used from about June 1990 until 1992. The third one that was first appeared in episode 105 from June 1992 was blue and continued to be used in the opening credits until the end of the series&#x27; run although it was replaced with another blue one a few months later.

It also showed videos, usually to show how everyday things were made – socks, toothbrushes etc. Sometimes either Peggy or Poppy or both visited the Lost Property Office. In a later series the office installed a telephone where people (usually Peggy or Poppy), could phone in asking for particular things (examples include information about spiders and a nighttime picture to help someone sleep during the day). Why Bird was voiced and puppeteered by Ellie Darvill for 9 series.

===Tuesday – The Playground Stop===
A variety of different things were involved. The programme always opened with the presenter (several, including Dave Benson Phillips and Elizabeth Fost), saying, &quot;Boys and Girls, come out to play...&quot;, followed by the programme&#x27;s theme, (e.g. we&#x27;re playing racing games today). The show featured a group of children doing activities, such as pretending to be cooks and making paper meals.

Dave was accompanied by a hand puppet named Chester. Elizabeth was also accompanied by a hand puppet called Ruby. The programme always featured a rhyme accompanied by Makaton sign language and a song performed by a marionette named Lizzie Dreams, who loved to sing and dance. She was occasionally accompanied by another marionette named Nick. There was also a story, often featuring Max and his magical chest of dressing-up clothes.

===Wednesday – The Dot Stop (1988–1992) / The Roundabout Stop (1992–1997)===
The non-speaking Dot, played by Rebecca Higgins, had fun with music or numbers. Later, there were three Dots: &quot;The Dot who plays the violin&quot; (Eithne Hannigan), &quot;The Dot who plays the drums&quot; (Liz Kitchen) and &quot;The Dot you can count on&quot; (Dyanne White). Sometimes, a puppet called Dash would appear and squirm its way through holes in the set. It had a song: &quot;Not number one, not number two, not number three or four, not number five, not number six, only one Dash can do tricks!&quot; Another pair of puppet friends were Professor Mopp and his blue dog Morgan. The Violinist and Counting Dots had a sidekick called Mr Domino (played by Peter Gunn, and later by Stephen Cannon). The Dot who plays the drums was accompanied by Domino the Musical Monkey.

It was later replaced by the Roundabout Stop, presented by Mr. Jolly (played by Robin Fritz), who maintained a fairground carousel called Rosie, whose platform initially did not have any objects to ride on. The show featured Bitsy Bob (played by Michele Durler), who played music and made things, and initially, Bella and Baxter the Numbears, followed by puppets Morris Cog and Milly Sprocket (puppeteered by Nick Mercer and Michele Durler), who presented a segment called &quot;Morris and Milly&#x27;s Numerical Melodies&quot;, where they sang a song glorifying a particular number. The Roundabout Stop also played host to an array of extra visitors to help with Rosie&#x27;s puzzles, including, but not limited to, Rhythm Man (David Rubin), Dilys Litefoot (Teresa Gallagher), Paul Morocco, Allesandro Bernardi, Morton McKewan (Iain Lauchlan), Gladys Tootle (Sarah Davison) and Leaping Lindy (Caroline Hinds).

Children from local schools and organisations such as Chickenshed helped with the puzzles and performed the song at the end of the programme. Also joining Mr. Jolly occasionally were Professor Mopp and Morgan from the Dot Stop. During the time Clive Duncan played Mr. Jolly, the team was later joined by the musician Charlie Grindle (played by Nick Mercer), who also appeared as one of the bus drivers from The Why Bird Stop. Charlie often sang songs for them, as well.

The main body of the episode featured the characters finding different shaped pictures,; these came together to form the title of a nursery rhyme or song, which was performed by the entire cast at the end of the episode. In later episodes (1995 to 1997), Mr Jolly was played by Andy Hockley. Rosie&#x27;s platform bore a tractor, a ship, an aeroplane and a car. These episodes featured Peggy, Poppy and Why Bird, who rode on the roundabout and went off on adventures (but in some episodes only Peggy and Why went on adventures, so on the third shape, they would both go together). Due to Peggy&#x27;s small size in comparison to Why Bird and Poppy, she would typically ride the ship or the tractor on the roundabout so that she could sit astride the vehicle&#x27;s funnel, as it meant she could be seen better.

At the start and end of each adventure, Mr. Jolly would sing the song &quot;Roll Up and Ride on Rosie&quot;. A picture associated with the adventure appeared in their shaped ticket (purple circle, red square, pink triangle, yellow diamond, green arch or blue rectangle), and these would combine to make the song, which ended the episode.

A special 40-minute, direct-to-video special called &quot;Winter Adventure&quot; was released in 1997. The special saw Mr. Jolly, again played by Andy Hockley, with Poppy, Why Bird and Peggy visiting a cottage for the weekend. Poppy was now puppeteered by Colleen Daley, and Peggy was puppeteered by Paula Everett. Darvill continued her role as Why Bird.

===Thursday – The Patch Stop===
Featuring Sam Patch, a small scarecrow doll and later replaced by Peggy Patch, a small rag doll who were both very kind natured. Sam and later Peggy would often travel places. From 1994 onwards Peggy would leave clues for children to find her and she would also be joined by Parsnip (a brown rabbit) who first appeared about 1991–92, Poppy and/or Why Bird later in the episode. She was originally non-speaking, but gained a voice (Sally Preisig) in 1994. Presenters included Vanessa Amberleigh, Colin Kerrigan, Ian Henderson, Sarah Davison, Teresa Gallagher, Neil Bett and Peter Quilter.

===Friday – The Tent Stop (1988–1995) / The Poppy Stop (1995–1997)===
A group of actors, including Trish Cooke, Ricky Diamond, Robert Hopkins, Will Brenton, Sue Monroe and Sarah Davison, would dress up, and with the help of a group of children, perform a play or show. Humphrey, a unicyclist puppet, and Wobble, a roly-poly clown also took part in the stories and they sometimes accompanied Lizzie for her songs (see The Playground Stop).

When the stop became the Poppy Stop, the setting was at Poppy the cat&#x27;s house, typically presented by Karl Woolley. Why Bird, Peggy Patch and other characters would often also appear in episodes at Poppy&#x27;s house.

At Christmas, the Playbus would stop at The Christmas Tree Stop. These special episodes featured characters from all the usual stops.

== Live shows ==
&quot;Playdays&quot; went on various tours around the UK during its run. The shows often saw all of the puppet characters coming together. Unlike the show, Peggy Patch was played by a live actor. Many of the characters were also portrayed by different actors when compared to the television series.

== VHS releases==
Magazines, books, audio tapes and PC games were also produced during its run.

<doc id="991029" wikidata="Q1339224" url="?curid=991029" title="Purbach (crater)">
<text>Purbach is a large lunar impact crater in the rugged southern highlands of the Moon. The distorted crater Regiomontanus is attached to the southern rim. To the northwest is Thebit and just to the northeast lies La Caille.
==Description==
The outer wall of Purbach is heavily worn, with the most intact section being along the east and northeast sides. The shared rim between Purbach and Regiomontanus is incised and rugged. The wall is distorted along the western edge, giving the appearance of a double rim, with the second rim distended towards the west. The northern wall is almost completely destroyed, and somewhat irregular Purbach G lies across the northwest rim.

The crater floor is relatively smooth in the eastern half, with a low series of ridges and a partial ghost crater outline just to the west of the crater midpoint. If the crater possessed a central peak, it has either been removed or forms part of the ridges to the west.

For a few hours before the first quarter, the crater&#x27;s rim contributes to the &quot;Lunar X&quot; visual phenomenon, in which an &#x27;X&#x27; shape briefly appears on the Moon&#x27;s terminator as sunlight glances on the tops of shadowed hills.

==Names==
Purbach is named after the 15th century Austrian astronomer Georg von Peuerbach. Like many of the craters on the Moon&#x27;s near side, it was named (in the Latin form, &#x27;Purbachius&#x27;) by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized. Earlier lunar cartographers had given the feature different names: Michael van Langren&#x27;s 1645 map calls it &quot;Christierni IV Reg. Daniae&quot;, after King Christian IV of Denmark, and Johannes Hevelius grouped it with Walther and Regiomontanus under the name &quot;Mons Libanus&quot;, after Mount Lebanon.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Purbach.

<text>Carrie Elizabeth Buck (July 3, 1906 – January 28, 1983) was the plaintiff in the United States Supreme Court case &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;, after having been ordered to undergo compulsory sterilization for purportedly being &quot;feeble-minded&quot; by her foster parents after their nephew raped and impregnated her. She had given birth to an illegitimate child without the means to support it. The surgery, carried out while Buck was an inmate of the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded, took place under the authority of the Sterilization Act of 1924, part of the Commonwealth of Virginia&#x27;s eugenics program.

==Early life==
Carrie Buck was born in Charlottesville, Virginia, the first of three children born to Emma Buck; she also had a half-sister, Doris Buck, and a half-brother, Roy Smith. Little is known about Emma Buck except that she was poor and married to Frederick Buck, who abandoned her early in their marriage. Emma was committed to the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded after being accused of &quot;immorality&quot;, prostitution, and having syphilis.

After her birth, Carrie Buck was placed with foster parents, John and Alice Dobbs. She attended public school, where she was noted to be an average student. When she was in sixth grade, the Dobbses removed her to have her help with housework.

At 17, Buck became pregnant as a result of being raped by Alice Dobbs&#x27; nephew, Clarence Garland. On January 23, 1924, the Dobbses had her committed to the Virginia Colony for Epileptics and Feeble-Minded on the grounds of feeblemindedness, incorrigible behavior, and promiscuity. Her commitment is said to have been due to the family&#x27;s embarrassment at Buck&#x27;s pregnancy from the rape incident.

On March 28, 1924, she gave birth to a daughter. Since Buck had been declared mentally incompetent to raise her child, the Dobbses adopted the baby and named her &quot;Vivian Alice Elaine Dobbs&quot;. She attended Venable Public Elementary School of Charlottesville for four terms, from September 1930 until May 1932. By all accounts, Vivian was of average intelligence, far above feeblemindedness.

In June 1932, Vivian contracted measles. She died from a secondary intestinal infection, enteric colitis, at the age of 8.

==Supreme Court case==

Virginia&#x27;s General Assembly passed the &quot;Eugenical Sterilization Act&quot; in 1924. According to American historian Paul A. Lombardo, politicians wrote the law to benefit a malpracticing doctor avoiding lawsuits from patients who had been the victims of forced sterilization. Eugenicists used Buck to legitimize this law in the 1927 Supreme Court case &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; through which they sought to gain legal permission for Virginia to sterilize Buck.

Irving P. Whitehead, a known eugenicist, served as Buck&#x27;s attorney. He was a close confidante of A. S. Priddy, the superintendent of Virginia Colony at the start of the trial, and a childhood friend of Aubrey E. Strode, who drafted the 1924 &quot;Eugenical Sterilization Act&quot;. Whitehead failed to adequately defend Buck and counteract the prosecutors. Thus, his case did not convince the Supreme Court to vote in favor of Buck. The cross examination and witnesses produced by Whitehead were ineffectual, and allegedly a result of his alliance with Strode during the trial. Additionally, Whitehead was also familiar with the sterilization law&#x27;s drafters. There was no real litigation between the prosecution and the defense, and thus the Supreme Court did not receive sufficient evidence to make a fair decision on the &quot;friendly [law]suit.&quot;

The legal challenge was consciously collusive, brought on behalf of the state to test the legality of the statute. John H. Bell, the surgeon who operated on Buck on October 19, 1927, wrote in his surgical report:

In an eight-to-one decision, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924 did not violate the U.S. Constitution. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes made clear that the challenge was not upon the medical procedure involved, but on the process of the substantive law. The court was satisfied that the Virginia Sterilization Act complied with the requirements of due process, since sterilization could not occur until a proper hearing had occurred, at which the patient and a guardian could be present, and the patient had the right to appeal the decision. They also found that, since the procedure was limited to people housed in state institutions, it did not deny the patient equal protection of the law. And finally, since the Virginia Sterilization Act was not a penal statute, the Court held that it did not violate the Eighth Amendment, since it is not intended to be punitive. Citing the best interests of the state, Justice Holmes affirmed the value of a law like Virginia&#x27;s in order to prevent the nation from being &quot;swamped with incompetence.&quot; The Court accepted without evidence that Carrie and her mother were promiscuous, and that the three generations of Bucks shared the genetic trait of feeblemindedness. Thus, it was in the state&#x27;s best interest to have Carrie Buck sterilized. The decision was seen as a major victory for eugenicists.

The 1927 Supreme Court opinion states that Carrie Buck is the likely parent of &quot;socially inadequate offspring[s]&quot; which is a euphemism for illegitimate children.

Noted Virginia eugenicist Joseph DeJarnette testified against Buck in the original trial.

According to famed eugenicist Harry H. Laughlin, whose written testimony was presented during the trial in his absence, Buck&#x27;s legal defeat signaled the end of &quot;eugenical sterilization&#x27;s &#x27;experimental period.&#x27;&quot; Following the Supreme Court ruling, over two dozen states enacted similar laws, including Oregon and the Carolinas, doubling American sterilizations from 6,000 to more than 12,000 by 1947. Buck was sterilized on October 19, 1927, roughly five months after the Supreme Court trial verdict. She became the first Virginian sterilized since the 1924 &quot;Eugenical Sterilization Act&quot; passed. The Virginia sterilization law is said to have inspired Nazi Germany&#x27;s 400,000 sterilizations, including those sanctioned under the 1933 Law for Protection Against Genetically Defective Offspring.

==Later years and death==

In order to ensure that the Buck family could not reproduce, her sister Doris was also sterilized without consent when she was hospitalized for appendicitis. She later married and she and her husband attempted to have children; she did not discover the reason for their lack of success until 1980.

Buck was released shortly after her sterilization was performed. On May 14, 1932, at the age of 25, she married William D. Eagle, a 65-year-old widower with six children from his first marriage; he died in 1941. In 1965, she married 61-year-old orchard worker Charlie Detamore; the marriage lasted until her death. Reporters and researchers who visited Buck later in life claimed she was a woman of normal intelligence. Later in life, she expressed regret that she had been unable to have additional children.

Buck died in a nursing home in 1983. She was buried in Charlottesville near her only child, Vivian, who had died at age eight.

==Legacy==
Paul A. Lombardo, a professor of law at Georgia State University, spent almost 25 years researching the &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; case. He searched through case records and the papers of the lawyers involved in the case. Lombardo eventually found Carrie Buck and was able to interview her shortly before her death. Lombardo has alleged that several people had manufactured evidence to make the state&#x27;s case against Carrie Buck, and that Buck was actually of normal intelligence. Lombardo was one of the few people who attended Carrie Buck&#x27;s funeral.

A historical marker was erected on May 2, 2002, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Carrie Buck was born. At that time, Virginia Governor Mark R. Warner offered the &quot;Commonwealth&#x27;s sincere apology for Virginia&#x27;s forced participation in eugenics.&quot;

===In media===
The story of Carrie Buck&#x27;s sterilization and subsequent court case was made into a television drama in 1994, &quot;Against Her Will: The Carrie Buck Story&quot; with actress Marlee Matlin portraying Buck as an intellectually disabled woman. A feature film has been announced, titled &quot;Unfit&quot; and starring actress Dakota Johnson. Buck&#x27;s case was covered in the October 2018 &quot;American Experience&quot; documentary &quot;The Eugenics Crusade&quot;.

The song &quot;Virginia State Epileptic Colony&quot;, by Manic Street Preachers on the 2009 album &quot;Journal for Plague Lovers&quot;, addresses the state&#x27;s program of eugenics. Carrie Buck&#x27;s story is explored in Adam Cohen&#x27;s book &quot;Imbeciles&quot;.

<text>The Rugby League European Championship (formerly known as the European Cup and European Nations Cup) is a rugby league football tournament for European national teams that was first held in 1935.

Originally, the European Cup had three teams, with England, Wales and France each playing each other once. Unlike the Tri-Nations series, there was no final; the team finishing at the top of the group was deemed the winner. From 1949 to 1956, a fourth Other Nationalities team entered the European Cup.

In 2003 the tournament rights were acquired by the European Rugby League and saw an expansion of the tournament reflecting the then recent growth of the sport across Europe.

==History==
===1935–1996: Original competition===

The Rugby League European Championships was originally a tri-nations tournament between England, Wales, and France playing each other in a single round robin. The tournament was played annually, with the exception of the years of the Second World War. 

In 1946–47, the tournament was altered, with each team playing each other twice, home and away. 

The 1949–50 tournament saw return to single round robin format. The tournament also saw the Other Nationalities team brought out of hiatus for the first time since the 1930s. This team consisted of players who were not English, Welsh, or French playing in the British and French leagues.

The 1955–56 tournament had no Welsh team, though Welsh players featured for Other Nationalities.

The tournament was not played again until 1969–70, and not again until 1975 with the original three-team format. 

The tournament stayed as part of the calendar until 1981 where it was again cancelled thereafter, but saw a final revival in 1995 and 1996.

===2003–2006: Nations Cup era and RLEF control===

In 2003, the Rugby League European Federation gained rights to the tournament and revived it under the name European Nations Cup. This saw the addition of Scotland, Ireland, and Russia with teams being split into two groups of three with the group winners competing in the final. The same format and teams featured in 2004.

The 2005 tournament saw England withdraw as a result of reduced competitiveness of the expanded tournament. A qualification tournament was held to find a team to replace England which saw Georgia beat Serbia and the Netherlands to earn the place.

The tournament again when on hiatus with plans to reform the top tier. 2006 saw the introduction of a B and C tournament as a result of the increased number of rugby league playering nations in Europe.

===2009–2018: European Cup era===
The tournament returned in 2009 under the name European Cup under the same format as 2006 but with Serbia and Italy replacing Russia and Georgia. France were absence from the 2009 edition due being invited to the 2009 Rugby League Four Nations.

Poor performance from both newcomers would see the 2010 tournament reduced to four teams: France, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales under a single round robin reminiscent of the original tournament and played every two years. Wales won the tournament, thus qualified for the 2011 Rugby League Four Nations.

The 2012 tournament provided problems for the new biennial schedule. France and Wales opted out of the tournament, wanting stronger tests in preparation for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, and arranged a separate tri-nations tournament with England. Italy and England reserves were asked to replace France and Wales though travel issues prevented Italy from participating. England reserves won the tournament.

The usual format was restored for the 2014 tournament which was won by Scotland, who as a result qualified for the 2016 Rugby League Four Nations. Learning from 2012, the 2016 tournament was held a year prior so as to not interfere with preparations for the 2017 World Cup.

The 2018 tournament acted as the 2021 Men&#x27;s Rugby League World Cup European qualification tournament.

===2020–present: Promotion and relegation era===
The Rugby League European Federation announced changes for the 2020 tournament with promotion and relegation between each tier of the tournament for first and last place teams respectfully. The tournament was also expanded to include a D tier as well. The 2020 European Championship was to consist of six teams with one team being relegated to Euro B. In July 2020, the 2020 edition of the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The next tournament, scheduled for 2022 but pushed back to 2023 due to the postponement of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was also cancelled due to the late withdrawal of France hosting the 2025 Rugby League World Cup as it could no longer be used as the European qualification tournament. This edition was set to feature a mass expansion of the tournament, featuring eight teams and the return of England. This edition would have also seeen Euro C and D cancelled due to all teams moving up divisions in the expanded tournament.

<text>Juan Esteban Aristizábal Vásquez (born 9 August 1972), known professionally as Juanes, is a Colombian musician who was a member of the rock band Ekhymosis and is now a solo artist. Since releasing his solo debut album &quot;Fíjate Bien&quot; in 2000, Juanes has won 26 Latin Grammy Awards and sold more than 15 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling Latin music artists of all time.

Born and raised in Colombia, Juanes began playing piano at age two. When Juanes was 17, he started his first band, Ekhymosis, in 1988, which went on to release eight albums, achieving recognition in his native Colombia. The track &quot;Dos&quot; from the album &quot;Niño Gigante&quot; in 1992 was very popular. In 1997 after the band broke up, Juanes continued solo and in 2000 he released the album, &quot;Fíjate Bien&quot;, which earned him three Latin Grammys. His follow-up album, &quot;Un Día Normal&quot;, was released in 2002 and was later certified platinum throughout America. Juanes&#x27; third album, &quot;Mi Sangre&quot; (2004), became an international bestseller, managing to position well in a number of countries around the world. It achieved success due to the single &quot;La Camisa Negra&quot;.

He has since released &quot;La Vida... Es Un Ratico&quot; (2007), &quot;P.A.R.C.E.&quot; (2010), &quot;Loco de Amor&quot; (2015), &quot;Mis planes son amarte&quot; (2017), &quot;Más Futuro Que Pasado&quot; (2019), &quot;Origen&quot; (2021), and &quot;Vida Cotidiana&quot; (2023).

Juanes has won 26 Latin Grammy Awards and three Grammy Awards. He received the BMI President&#x27;s Award at the 2010 BMI Latin Awards. Juanes is also known for his humanitarian work, especially with aid for Colombian victims of anti-personnel mines through his NGO Fundacion Mi Sangre. In April 2013, Juanes released an autobiography titled &quot;Chasing The Sun&quot; in which he tells his story through narratives and pictures. He is
one of the best-selling Spanish-language artists.

==Early life and career==
Juanes was born in Medellín, Colombia. When he was seven years old, his father and brothers began to teach him how to play guitar. His passion for the instrument led him to discover simple genres of music such as traditional sounds such as tango and vallenato, as well as Russian folk music.

He grew up in Medellín during the height of drug kingpin Pablo Escobar&#x27;s reign, when the city had the highest homicide rate in the world. During his childhood, Juanes witnessed a civil war in which hundreds were killed. His cousin was killed by kidnappers, and gunmen also executed a close friend. To add further to Juanes&#x27; grief and desperation, his father died from cancer. This period shaped Juanes&#x27; social consciousness, saying &quot;Colombia has suffered so much that the only way to go forward is to imagine a better country.&quot;

As a teenager, Juanes was greatly influenced by rock and metal acts such as The Beatles and Metallica. He started the rock band Ekhymosis in 1988, and it released its debut album, &quot;Niño Gigante&quot;, that same year. The band released seven studio albums during its career and shared the stage with acts including Alejandro Sanz, Aterciopelados, and Ricky Martin; however in Juanes&#x27; words, the band &quot;couldn&#x27;t get out of Colombia&quot; and remained &quot;very local and confined to the Colombian market.&quot; Juanes disbanded the group in 1998 so that he could pursue a solo career.

==Solo career==
===2000–03: &quot;Fíjate Bien&quot; and &quot;Un Día Normal&quot;===
In 2000, Juanes released his solo debut &quot;Fíjate Bien&quot; (Take a Good Look), produced by Gustavo Santaolalla. The album fared well in Colombia, spending ten weeks at the number one position, but was unsuccessful in other countries. The album earned him three Latin Grammys for Best New Artist, Best Rock Solo Vocal Album, and Best Rock Song, and Juanes performed at the award show. Later that night, Juanes brought demos for over forty new songs to Santaolalla&#x27;s studio, ready to begin work on another album.

The follow-up, &quot;Un Día Normal&quot; (&quot;A Normal Day&quot;), also produced by Gustavo Santaolalla who signed him with his first solo album, was released in 2002 and was highly successful in America. The album was certified gold in Colombia during its first day of sales and was certified platinum and multi-platinum in countries including Colombia, Mexico, and Spain. The album spent 92 weeks in the top ten of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Albums chart, setting a new record, and spent a total of two years on the chart. The album was released after the eligibility deadlines for the 2002 Latin Grammy Awards, but the advance airdate for the lead single, &quot;A Dios le Pido&quot; (&quot;To God I Pray&quot;), allowed it to be nominated for three awards and win Best Rock Song.

&quot;A Dios le Pido&quot; topped the singles charts of twelve countries and spent 47 consecutive weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Tracks. The album also featured &quot;Fotografía&quot; (&quot;Photograph&quot;), a duet with Portuguese Canadian pop singer Nelly Furtado about the isolation between lovers. Juanes later worked with Furtado on a remix of &quot;Powerless (Say What You Want)&quot;, the lead single from her 2003 album &quot;Folklore&quot;, and on &quot;Te busqué&quot; (&quot;I Looked for You&quot;), a single from her 2006 album &quot;Loose&quot;. Juanes won the most awards at the 2003 Latin Grammy Awards, where he won each of the 5 awards for which he had been nominated, including Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Album of the Year.

===2004–05: &quot;Mi Sangre&quot;===

&quot;Mi Sangre&quot; (&quot;My Blood&quot;), was released in September 2004 and debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums. The album produced three consecutive number one singles, which held the top chart position for a combined 6 months. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;La Camisa Negra&quot; (&quot;The Black Shirt&quot;), was used in Italy in support of neo-fascism by relating it to the uniform used under the regime of Benito Mussolini. In response, left-wing media network Indymedia called for a boycott of the song. Juanes later stated that &quot;&#x27;La Camisa Negra&#x27; has got nothing to do with fascism or Mussolini... People can interpret music in all kinds of ways I guess.&quot;
At the 2005 Latin Grammy Awards, Juanes won three additional awards to his nine previous Grammy awards. He took the award for Best Rock Song for &quot;Nada Valgo Sin Tu Amor&quot; (&quot;I am Worthless Without Your Love&quot;), Best Rock Solo Album for &quot;Mi Sangre&quot; and Best Music Video for &quot;Volverte a Ver&quot; (&quot;To See You Again&quot;). On 9 December 2005, Juanes performed &quot;La camisa negra&quot; at an international gala in Germany celebrating the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final Draw evening. In 2006, he recorded a duet of &quot;The Shadow of Your Smile&quot; with Tony Bennett for Bennett&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

===2006–09: &quot;La Vida... Es Un Ratico&quot;===

In June 2006, Juanes began a year-long sabbatical to spend time with his wife, model Karen Martínez, and their daughters Luna and Paloma. He was working on an album that was released on October 23, 2007. When asked about the possibility of recording an album in English, Juanes responded, &quot;singing in Spanish is very important because it&#x27;s the language in which I think and feel. I respect people that sing in English, but for now I&#x27;ll keep my Spanish.&quot; Juanes planned to launch his own music label, named 4J, in October 2007, to be distributed by the Universal Music Group. He was also working on a new album, titled &quot;La Vida... Es Un Ratico&quot; (&quot;Life is a Little Moment&quot;).

&quot;La Vida... Es Un Ratico&quot; was released on 23 October 2007, with the first single being &quot;Me Enamora&quot; (I fall in love). The second single was &quot;Gotas de Agua Dulce&quot; (drops of sweet water), and the third single became the vallenato fusion of &quot;Tres&quot; (three).

On 11 December 2007, Juanes performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway together with a variety of artists, which was broadcast live to over 100 countries.

On 24 November 2008, Juanes re-released the album as &quot;La vida... es un ratico (en vivo)&quot; [Deluxe Edition][2 CD/DVD Combo]&quot; The album aside the 14 original songs, contains two previously unreleased songs: &quot;Falsas Palabras&quot; (false words) and &quot;Odio Por Amor&quot; (hate for love) which is also the current single. This new re-edition also includes seven live versions of songs played during his U.S. La Vida Tour. As another bonus added, Juanes also included a duet of his song &quot;Hoy Me Voy&quot; (today I leave) with singer Colbie Caillat. The DVD contains the music videos of the four singles of the cd as well as a few live video recordings of the US tour.

===2010–2013: &quot;P.A.R.C.E&quot; and his Juanes MTV Unplugged===
In 2010, Juanes performed in the 2010 FIFA World Cup Kickoff Concert, as well as the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York. In addition, he released his album &quot;P.A.R.C.E.&quot; which featured the No. 1 Billboard hit Yerbatero and the top-ten hit Y No Regresas. 17 February, Juanes performed live on the third single from their fifth studio album Regalito in the delivery of the Premios Lo Nuestro. The album has sold 1 million copies worldwide.
In February 2012, the Colombian singer Juanes took the stage at Juanes MTV Unplugged to record a live album at the direction of Juan Luis Guerra.
On 6 March, Juanes will release &quot;La Señal&quot; as an unreleased song from his Unplugged.

===2014–2015: &quot;Loco de Amor&quot;===
On 11 March 2014, Juanes released his sixth studio album by Universal Music Latino Loco de amor. It is his first studio album since &quot;P.A.R.C.E.&quot; (2010). At the Latin Grammy Awards of 2014, the album won the Best Pop/Rock Album. &quot;Loco de Amor&quot; was nominated for Lo Nuestro Award for Pop Album of the Year. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album in 2015.

===2016–2017: &quot;Mis planes son amarte&quot;===
Juanes contributed to the 2017 animated film &quot;Ferdinand&quot;. In that production, he both wrote the original score &quot;Lay Your Head On Me&quot; and played the voice of Juan (Nina&#x27;s father). On 12 May 2017, Juanes released &quot;Mis planes son amarte&quot;. The album was accompanied by a space-themed visual album. The visual component was filmed in Colombia and Mexico and represents a spiritual journey through challenges and victories. Juanes explained that the album alludes to &quot;the connection between our most ancestral, indigenous roots and the universe and its planets. Those points are even more closely tied than we can imagine.&quot; It also explores the daily life and spirituality of the Kogi people, an indigenous group that resides in Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains in northern Colombia. &quot;Mis planes son amarte&quot; won Latin Grammy Award for Best Pop/Rock Album at the 18th Annual Latin Grammy Awards. The album is also Juanes&#x27;s first to feature a song in English, &quot;Goodbye for Now&quot;. In June 2017, Juanes collaborated with Chilean singer Mon Laferte on the cumbia-influenced single &quot;Amárrame&quot;. On 23 May 2018, Juanes performed with Mon Laferte as part of National Public Radio&#x27;s Tiny Desk Concerts series.

===2018–2019: Transition to urban genre and &quot;Más futuro que pasado&quot;===
In 2018, the Mexican singer Raymix included him in a version of his song &quot;Oye Mujer&quot;. In 2018 he performed at Starlite Festival presented &quot;Pa&#x27; Dentro&quot; -the first official single from the then upcoming album-, which was officially released on 31 May 2018. On 10 January 2019, he released his first single of the year, «La plata», which has the participation of Colombian singer Lalo Ebratt. On 23 May, he presented his single &quot;Querer Mejor&quot; alongside Canadian singer Alessia Cara. In July, he collaborated on the song &quot;Todo bien&quot; by the Trapical Minds collective alongside Lalo Ebratt, Skinny Happy, Yera. Then, in August he collaborated on the Greeicy single &quot;Minifalda&quot;. On 5 September, he released his single &quot;Bonita&quot; with his compatriot Sebastián Yatra, which was positioned at the top of the American music charts. Later, on 7 November, he presented &quot;Aurora&quot;, which he interprets with Colombian rapper Crudo Means Raw. In November, he released his single &quot;Tequila&quot;, which features the collaboration of the Mexican singer Christian Nodal. The next day, he presented his new album &quot;Más futuro que pasado&quot;, where it emphasizes his transition to the urban genre without leaving aside his classic rock and pop musical style. On 5 December, he released his latest single &quot;Más futuro que pasado&quot;.

In December 2019, Juanes released the album &quot;Más futuro que pasado&quot;. The album features Colombian musicians Sebastián Yatra, Crudo Means Raw, and Lalo Ebratt as well as regional Mexican singer Christian Nodal, Dominican-American MC Fuego, and Canadian singer Alessia Cara, who sings in Spanish for the first time on the song &quot;Querer Mejor&quot;. The album was inspired Juanes&#x27; optimism for the future of Colombia and highlights the diversity of the country, featuring a variety of traditional musical genres such as vallenato and cumbia combined with modern musical styles. Juanes explained that &quot;it gives me a lot of hope. Esperanza, you know — &quot;Más futuro que pasado&quot; is about having the drive to keep experimenting. I want to keep writing music, I want to live more. This is the point of my life when I want to live so much. But before I do anything, I start from the roots. And from there I build my vision.&quot;

===2021: &quot;Origen&quot;===
On 28 May 2021, Juanes released his 10th studio album, &quot;Origen.&quot; The album consists of twelve covers that span his musical influences, including Bruce Springsteen, Juan Luis Guerra, and Bob Marley. Juanes described these songs as having a significant &quot;impact on the memory of my youth, my adolescence, my childhood.&quot; Like much of Juanes&#x27; discography, the album encompasses many styles from tango, merengue, and vallenato to reggae, folk, and heavy metal. The release of the album was accompanied by a documentary released on Amazon Prime, in which Juanes explains why he chose each song, speaks with several of the songwriters he covers, and performs music videos that channel the era in which they were written. Juanes contributed a cover of the Metallica song &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; to the charity tribute album &quot;The Metallica Blacklist&quot;, released in September 2021.

==Musical style and influences==

Growing up in Colombia, Juanes&#x27; first musical exposure included cumbia, salsa, vallenato and the rural Antioquian genre known as guasca, all of which influence his music. In his youth, Juanes was a fan of rock group Metallica and attempted to emulate the group&#x27;s style, but recalls that &quot;after many years I just realized that I was not gonna be like James Hetfield&quot;. He notes that his musical tastes are diverse: &quot;It&#x27;s good to have music for every moment. I can listen to Slayer and then the next song, Residente. Or I just can go to Ruben Blades and Silvio Rodriguez, then go to Caetano Veloso. And then I go back to Metallica!&quot; He has also expressed admiration for Spanish singer Rosalía, Puerto Rican rapper Tego Calderón, Colombian reggaeton artist J Balvin, American singer Billie Eilish, and American rapper and singer Travis Scott.

Juanes&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Fíjate Bien&quot;, contains themes on loss and violence, alluding to deaths caused by land mines. The album reflected grief in Juanes&#x27; personal life, including the deaths of his cousin and father, and Juanes himself described the record as &quot;dark and depressing&quot;. His next album, &quot;Un Dia Normal&quot;, takes a more optimistic approach while continuing to discuss themes of war and violence. The record also included lighter themes such as romantic love to reflect falling in love with his now-wife. &quot;Mi Sangre&quot; continued themes of social conflict, discussing topics such as terrorism and kidnapping. His song, &quot;Rosario Tijeras&quot; from &quot;Mi Sangre&quot; tells the story of a prostitute who becomes an assassin.

Romantic love is a common theme in Juanes&#x27; music. His album &quot;Mis planes son amarte&quot; was described as a collection of &quot;gleaming, tuneful, good-natured songs about love&quot;. Though his songs are primarily in Spanish, he has performed songs in Italian, Portuguese, German, and English. On recording in other languages, Juanes noted in 2017, &quot;It&#x27;s hard when you have to change the way your muscles work,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to go full crossover — that&#x27;s not my plan — but I just wanted to do it someday.&quot;

==Activism==
Juanes is outspoken in both his music and the media about violence and inequality in Colombia. Addressing the topic of victims of the Colombian civil war, Juanes stated: &quot;these are your people, young people, people with families, and four or five of them are dying every day.&quot; Juanes established the Mi Sangre Foundation to help victims of anti-personnel mines In 2005, he was named by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people. On 15 November 2005, he was honored at the annual benefit gala for Sir Paul McCartney&#x27;s Adopt-A-Minefield for his work as a Goodwill Ambassador for United for Colombia, a non-profit organization that raises awareness about the impact of land mines within Colombia.

On 19 April 2006, Juanes performed before the European Parliament, as part of a campaign to increase awareness against the use of landmines around the world, including in his native Colombia. He was first singer to perform in the hemicycle where the European Parliament holds its plenary sessions. The Parliament gave a symbolic gift of €2.5 million to demine Colombia and to rehabilitate victims of the landmines. In honor of his work and his music, he was given an &quot;escopetarra&quot; (a decommissioned AK-47 converted into a guitar) by peace activist César López; he later sold it at a fundraiser in Beverly Hills for US$17,000. Juanes held a benefit concert on 24 May 2006, in conjunction with KLVE and Univision which raised roughly US$350,000 to care for injured children and provide prosthetics, wheelchairs, and land rehabilitation.

On 19 July 2006, French Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres awarded Juanes with the highest cultural honor given by France, L&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, declaring him &quot;Knight in the order of Arts and Letters&quot; for his work in social activism. In December 2006, work began on a recreational park for the rehabilitation of the handicapped named &quot;Parque Juanes de la Paz&quot; in Medellín. The 68,000-square-meter facility will cost COL$10.6 billion, financed in part by the government of Medellín, and is to be completed by May 2007.

In June 2013, Juanes appeared in a Spanish-language public service announcement for the HIV/AIDS non-profit organization Lifebeat in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and MTV. In the video, the singer encouraged HIV testing and cited a statistic stating that there are a thousand new cases of HIV per month among people 13 to 24 years of age. Guillermo Chacon, president of The Latino Commission on AIDS, commented that &quot;Celebrities like Juanes are crucial to raising awareness, which is one of the most important ways for people to understand that HIV infection can be prevented.&quot;

===2009 Peace Concert in Cuba===


On 5 August 2009, it was announced that Juanes would hold his second &quot;Peace Without Borders&quot; concert in Havana&#x27;s storied Plaza de la Revolución on 20 September 2009.

Prior to the concert, Juanes received criticism by some in the Cuban-American/Cuban exile community in Miami who believed it would be seen as an act of support for the communist government of Cuba. Juanes expressed in an interview for Univision that he had no affiliation whatsoever to the Cuban government or their political views and that he saw it only as an artistic performance and nothing more.

On 20 August 2009, Juanes announced that he had considered canceling the peace concert citing &quot;fears for his safety as well as his family&quot;, who reside with him in Miami on Key Biscayne. Juanes closed it along with 15 other Cuban and international artists and with more than one million people attending the concert.&quot;

==Personal life==
Juanes met model/actress Karen Martínez during the filming of his video &quot;Podemos Hacernos Daño&quot;. On 6 August 2004, they were married. The couple separated in May 2007, after three years of marriage due to unresolved differences, but reconciled four months later. They have three children together, two daughters: Luna Aristizábal Martínez (born 6 September 2003), Paloma Aristizábal Martínez (born 2 June 2005), and one son, Dante Aristizábal Martínez (born 12 September 2009).
Juanes is a vegetarian and lives in Key Biscayne, Florida.

<text>Scheiner is a lunar impact crater that lies to the west of the enormous walled plain Clavius. To the southeast near the rim of Clavius is the crater Blancanus. The rim of Scheiner is worn, eroded, and marked with multiple impacts. It is most heavily worn in the northern part, where a cluster of craterlets covers the entrance to a low valley leading to the north. The floor of the crater has several craterlets, including Scheiner A that lies near the midpoint. There is also a low ridge crossing part of the eastern floor.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Scheiner.

<text>The Government College University (colloquially known as GCU; Punjabi, Urdu: ) is a public research university in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Founded as Government College, Lahore, in 1864 under British administration, it became a university in 2002.

== Overview ==

In 1864, Government College was established by the British government in India. After being elevated to university status in 2002, it has become one the ten largest educational institutions in Pakistan, with a student body of over 12,000. It has 32 academic departments, segregated into five faculties. There are five research centers, focused on academic and industrial research and development projects. The university secured the second place in the general category by the Higher Education Commission (HEC) in 2013. It has the highest graduation rate in the country, with an average of 94.6% annually. In Government College University, the medium of instruction is English.

Government College University is noted for its historical roots and produced notable scholars such as poet-philosopher Allama Muhammad Iqbal, Nobel laureates Har Gobind Khorana and Abdus Salam, former president of both the United Nations General Assembly and the International Court of Justice Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, scholar and novelist couple Bano Qudsia and Ashfaq Ahmed. Among its graduates are also four prime ministers and one caretaker prime minister of Pakistan.

== History ==

Originally, the establishment of a central college in Lahore was sanctioned in 1856 by the British Raj, given that the teachers were from University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, Dublin University HC or Durham University. Under the leadership of Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner, a professor of Arabic and Islamic Law at King&#x27;s College London, the college was established on 1 January 1864, located in the &quot;Palace of Raja Dhyan Singh Haveli&quot; (Dogra prime minister of Sikh ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Lahore) inside Walled City of Lahore, as an affiliated college of Calcutta University.

In April 1871, the college moved to a large Bungalow near Anarkali Bazaar. In 1873, its location was again changed to another house called &quot;Rahim Khan&#x27;s Kothi&quot; due to rapidly increasing student strength. It moved to its present building in 1876.

The first principal was Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner, whose name is closely attached to the college. In 1882, Leitner was very instrumental in laying the foundation of Punjab University, Lahore. Thereafter, the college would remain affiliated with Punjab University for 115 years. In 1997, government of the Punjab gave Government College autonomy in all affairs and granted degree awarding status.

In 2002, it was promoted to university status by the government of Punjab; the word &quot;college&quot; was retained in its title for preserving its historical roots.
== Campus ==
=== Old Campus ===
Positioned in Downtown Lahore, it is located at the junction of The Mall, Lahore and the Lower Mall, surrounded by main business and administrative areas, schools, colleges and Punjab University old Campus. The main building was designed by W. Purdon and completed in 1877 at a cost of Rs. 320,000. In the centre of the main building stands a 176&#x27; tall clock tower. Built during the colonial era, the main building reflects the neo-Gothic tradition, with broad verandahs and elevated ceilings. A large ground accompanies the main building, alluded to as the &quot;Oval Ground&quot;. In 2019, the ground was renamed &quot;The Leitner Oval&quot;, in honour of Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner, the first principal of the institute. To meet the needs of an increasing number of students, several buildings and blocks have been commissioned which include a postgraduate block, a new block for intermediate students and a bachelors&#x27; block which is accessible by an overhead bridge. The main campus is spread over 56 acres along the Anarkali Bazaar, one of the oldest surviving markets in Lahore.

=== Kala Shah Kaku Campus ===
On 24 August 2019, the Kala Shah Kaku campus of the university was inaugurated which is known as GCU KSK campus. The campus is spread over 370 acres, able to house 25,000 students, 1,250 teachers and 650 staff members. 22 hostels are available for accommodation.

On 24 September 2020, the new campus was formally opened to students. A bus shuttle service will operate between both campuses.

== Emblem ==
The torch, as the crest of the university emblem, represents the light of knowledge. The motto &quot;Courage to Know&quot; represents the guiding principle of the student community.

== Academics ==

Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialization (ORIC) has been set up to manage all research issues. The objective of the office is to advance, diversify and manage all research programs and to uphold international standards of research.

It receives research grants mostly from foreign universities like Strathclyde University, Cranfield University, World Bank Researchers Alliance for Development and British Council and from national institutes and organizations like Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), Pakistan Science Foundation (PSF), Khan Research Laboratories (KRL), PTCL, Higher Education Commission and Ministry of Science and Technology.

=== Institutes ===
The university has five autonomous/semi-autonomous, research-oriented institutes, focused on academic and industrial research and development projects. These institutes are:

* &quot;Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences&quot; (ASSMS) – study of scientific and technological problems by mathematical methods in mathematical sciences.
* &quot;Center for Advanced Studies in Physics&quot; (CASP) – research and development (R&amp;D) in Experimental Physics.
* &quot;Institute of Industrial Biotechnology&quot; (IIB) – offers degrees in Biotechnology and Microbiology.
* &quot;Sustainable Development Study Center&quot; (SDSC) – R&amp;D in Environmental science.
* &quot;Center of Excellence of China Studies&quot; (CECS) – offers diplomas in Chinese language and China studies.

== Abdus Salam School for Mathematical Sciences ==

The Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences (ASSMS) is one of the largest mathematical research institutes in Pakistan. The school was established in 2003 by Government of Punjab under the aegis of Government College University.

In 2011, it was labeled as the first &quot;Emerging Regional Center of Excellence&quot; by the European Mathematical Society (EMS) for the period 2011 to 2015.

It has taken steps to provide encouragement to Pakistani students in schools and colleges. These include:
* Hiring Foreign Faculty to teach or supervise ASSMS students in advanced level mathematics. This step was initiated by the founding Director General of ASSMS, A.D.R. Choudary. Jürgen Herzog, Josip Pečarić, Amer Iqbal, Alexandru Dimca, and Hannah Markwig are among Foreign Faculty that have supervised/co-supervised Ph.D. students at ASSMS.
* Hosted international conferences and workshops in mathematics. The most important conferences of AS-SMS were “World Conferences of Mathematics in the 21st Century” series, held during the tenure of A.D.R. Choudary. Some notable mathematicians that have visited and given talks in this conference series are Ari Laptev (president of the EMS 2007–2010), Marta Sanz-Solé (president of the EMS 2011–2014), Pierre Cartier (an associate of the Bourbaki Group), Arnfinn Laudal, Michel Waldschmidt, János Pach, Alan Huckleberry, Aline Bonami, and Ragni Piene (Chair of the Abel Prize Committee 2010-2014 and the first-ever woman in the International Mathematical Union Executive Committee).
*Up until 2014, during the tenure of A.D.R. Choudary, the faculty at the Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences hosted training camps for students from schools and colleges. The participants of the camps are prepared for the national team of Pakistan to compete at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). In 2005, the national team of Pakistan took part for the first time in IMO. Trained in ASSMS, the Pakistan team won its first medal at IMO in 2007 and its first silver medal in 2012.
*ASSMS initiated the Mathematical Kangaroo contests at the national level.

== Chairs ==
=== Abdus Salam Chair in Physics ===
The Abdus Salam Chair in Physics, named after the Pakistani theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Abdus Salam is an honorary chair in physics at the university. Starting out as a semi-autonomous institute, it became operational in March 2000 with the efforts of Ishfaq Ahmad, a lifelong friend of Salam. In 2009, the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) donated Salam&#x27;s original Nobel certificate to the Salam Chair in Physics. The former director of ICTP, Katepalli R. Sreenivasan, visited Lahore where he gifted the original Nobel certificate to the university&#x27;s alma mater. The certificate reads: &quot;for their contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles, including, inter-alia, the prediction of the weak neutral current&quot;.

It has been integrated into Department of Physics, where MPhil and PhD students carry out their research work. Some of its achievements include: getting 52 research publications in international journals; producing 6 PhD and 25 MPhil theses; setting up a Plasma Technology Lab; and contracting research grants from funding agencies and research centers such as the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), Kahuta Research Laboratories (KRL), Pakistan Science Foundation (PSF) and Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR).

=== Rafi Muhammad Chaudhry Chair in Experimental Physics ===
The Rafi Muhammad Chaudhry Chair in Experimental Physics was named after Rafi Muhammad Chaudhry, a renowned Pakistani nuclear physicist and a professor of particle physics at the university. He is widely regarded as having been the pioneer of experimental nuclear physics research in Pakistan. During his tenure as a professor at the university, he set up &quot;High Tension Laboratory&quot; there in 1952 (now amalgamated into Center for Advanced Studies in Physics ) where research anent to gaseous discharges, ion, and electron impact phenomena, nuclear physics, radioactivity, and cosmic rays is carried out.

The university set up the chair in recognition of his services to Pakistan and to Physics. Currently, post-graduate research work in Applied Physics is carried out here.

=== Mahboob-ul-Haq Chair in Economics ===
The Mahboob-ul-Haq Chair in Economics is the latest addition to honorary chairs at the university, named after Mahbub ul Haq, a Pakistani economist, politician and international development theorist who served as the 13th Finance Minister of Pakistan. While serving as the Special Advisor to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), he led the establishment of the Human Development Report (HDI) and the widely respected Human Development Index (HDI). &quot;The Economist&quot; called him &quot;one of the visionaries of international development.&quot;

The university established the chair to recognize his services to Pakistan, its people, and above all to the discipline of Economics. Apart from post-graduate research in Economics, the chair is also in charge of publishing &quot;GCU Economics Journal&quot; an annual scholarly and peer-audited publication. Its intent is to act as a platform for researchers, professionals, and students to share their achievements, perspectives, and practical experiences.

== Accommodation ==
The university has four hostels – three for boys and one for girls. &quot;Iqbal Hostel&quot; (built in 1891) and &quot;Quaid-e-Azam&quot; &quot;Hostel&quot; (built in 1993) accommodate about 150 and 200 Intermediate students, respectively. The &quot;New Hostel&quot; (built in 1937) houses about 400 Degree students. &quot;Girls Hostel&quot; (built in 1975) accommodates about 50 girl students. A &quot;Faculty Mess&quot; has been built for visiting family members, faculty and officers of the other universities. Lodging and messing facilities are available here.

<doc id="991051" wikidata="Q7409153" url="?curid=991051" title="Same-sex marriage in Manitoba">
<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in Manitoba since September 16, 2004. In the case of &quot;Vogel v. Canada&quot;, the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of Manitoba ordered the province to begin issuing marriage licences to same-sex couples. This decision followed a suit brought by three couples who were denied the right to marry. Both the provincial and federal governments had made it known that they would not oppose the court bid.

Manitoba was the fifth jurisdiction in Canada, after Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec and Yukon, to extend civil marriage to same-sex couples. The court said that its decision had been influenced by the previous decisions in those four provinces and territories.

==Court ruling==
===Background and judgment===
In 1974, Chris Vogel and Richard North were married in the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Winnipeg but the government refused to register their marriage. The couple had previously attempted to receive a civil marriage licence in February 1974, but were rejected. They filed a lawsuit, but the trial court dismissed their case based on dictionary definitions of marriage. The couple received a legal opinion that an appeal was &quot;hopeless&quot;. In an October 2004 interview, the couple said &quot;we believed if people would look at us realistically, our problems would end...[Back then] few people could say &#x27;homosexual&#x27; without choking [and] we were spoken of as if we were evil.&quot;

On August 26, 2004, North and Vogel, along with two other same-sex couples, initiated a lawsuit, &quot;Vogel v. Canada&quot;, seeking the right to marry in Manitoba. The couples argued that the province&#x27;s ban on issuing marriage licences to same-sex couples violated the &quot;Charter&quot; rights of gays and lesbians. Justice Minister Gord Mackintosh said, &quot;We will not oppose what they are seeking...We don&#x27;t have an interest in opposing legally recognized rights of Canadians...I think the weight of the decisions across the country have pointed to the conclusion that the current federal law is not in accordance with the &quot;Charter&quot;, so I am pleased that we&#x27;re going to have some definitive ruling here in Manitoba.&quot; On September 16, 2004, Justice Douglas Yard of the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of Manitoba ordered the province to begin issuing marriage licences to same-sex couples, ruling that the province&#x27;s same-sex marriage ban violated the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. Vogel and North did not remarry because they had been married 30 years earlier in the Unitarian Church. The other couples involved in the case were Stefphany Cholakis and Michelle Ritchot, and Laura Fouhse and Jordan Cantwell. Both couples were issued marriage licences following the court order, with Cholakis and Ritchot being the first same-sex couple to marry in Manitoba, on September 16, 2004. Fouhse and Cantwell were married two days later; &quot;I&#x27;m extremely pleased that our wedding this weekend will not only be celebrated and witnessed by our friends and family and by God in the sanctity of our church, but it will also be recognized by our government. It just makes the whole event seem so much more complete&quot;, said Fouhse. Both are ministers in the United Church of Canada, with Cantwell serving as moderator between 2015 and 2018.

===Reaction and aftermath===
Archbishop James Weisgerber of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Winnipeg condemned the court ruling, saying that prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying was &quot;a foundational principle of our society...It is difficult to understand how the unique importance of marriage to both children and society will not be gravely undermined by including in the definition of marriage unions which are not equipped for reproduction.&quot; A controversy emerged shortly after the ruling, when the province&#x27;s Vital Statistics Office sent letters to the province&#x27;s government marriage commissioners (not clergy) asking them to return their certificates of registration if they refuse to perform same-sex marriages. The federal Conservative justice critic Vic Toews announced he would file a complaint with the Manitoba Human Rights Commission if this policy was not rescinded. Kevin Kisilowsky, a marriage commissioner whose certification was cancelled in 2005 when he refused to return his certificate of registration, filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission, arguing that performing same-sex marriages would violate his religious beliefs, but the Commission dismissed his case in 2005. Kisilowsky filed a legal challenge with the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench in September 2016, again arguing that the government&#x27;s requirement that civil marriage commissioners not discriminate against same-sex couples violated his religious beliefs. Justice Karen Simonsen ruled against him in November 2016, ruling that Kisilowsky &quot;can practice his faith as he chooses but is simply not permitted to use his faith as a basis to refuse to marry couples whose weddings, due to religious or moral views, offend him.&quot; Simonsen said Kisilowsky could apply for temporary certification or register as a religious official, which would allow him to perform marriages to whomever he wishes. The Manitoba Court of Appeal upheld Justice Simonsen&#x27;s decision in February 2018.

In 2015, Richard North filed a discrimination complaint with the Manitoba Human Rights Commission when the government again refused to register his 1974 marriage to Chris Vogel. The Commission referred the case to an adjudicator, who heard the complaint in November 2017. The adjudicator ruled against the couple in January 2018. In June 2021, Justice Gerald Chartier of the Manitoba Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench agreed with the adjudicator&#x27;s decision, ruling that the province did not discriminate against the couple by not recognizing their 1974 marriage. The marriage certificate issued to them by the Unitarian Church in 1974 is now on display at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights.

==Provincial legislation==
===Common-law relationships===
Since 2001, same-sex couples have had access to government-sanctioned relationships, providing some of the rights and benefits of marriage. While not as extensive as the rights and benefits of marriage, these relationships provide some important benefits to unmarried couples.

===Marriage===
In October 2008, the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba amended the &quot;Marriage Act&quot; () and several other acts relating to family law to incorporate gender-neutral language. Specifically, it replaced references to &quot;husband and wife&quot; with &quot;spouses&quot; in various sections of the Act, and added the term &quot;spouse&quot; after &quot;wife/husband&quot; in subsection 7(3). The legislation was assented by Lieutenant Governor John Harvard on October 9, 2008, making Manitoba the fourth province, after Quebec, Ontario and Prince Edward Island, to bring its marriage laws in line with the legalisation of same-sex marriage. Subsection 7(3) was amended to read that each of the parties to the marriage, in the presence of the marriage commissioner and the witnesses, say to the other:
==Marriage statistics==
Approximately 900 same-sex couples had married in the twelve years following the court ruling. An average of 79 same-sex marriages were performed per year, with the peak being 2014 at 107 same-sex marriages. The 2016 Canadian census showed that 1,710 same-sex couples were living in Manitoba.

==Religious performance==
In July 2019, the synod of the Anglican Church of Canada passed a resolution known as &quot;A Word to the Church&quot;, allowing its dioceses to choose whether to bless and perform same-sex marriages. That same month, Bishop Geoffrey Woodcroft of the Diocese of Rupert&#x27;s Land said that clergy in the diocese would be permitted to perform same-sex marriages from January 2020. Bishop William Cliff of the Diocese of Brandon supports same-sex marriage, but has said that he would only allow same-sex marriages to be performed in his diocese with the support of the diocesan synod. Currently, the canons of the diocese state that &quot;no cleric within the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Brandon shall solemnise a marriage between two persons except as provided for in the canons of the General Synod&quot;. Bishop Lydia Mamakwa of the Indigenous Spiritual Ministry of Mishamikoweesh, encompassing First Nations communities in northeastern Manitoba, opposes same-sex marriage, and the diocese does not perform same-sex marriages.

Some other religious organisations also perform same-sex marriages in their places of worship, including the United Church of Canada, Quakers, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and the Canadian Unitarian Council. In 1974, Unitarian Reverend Norm Naylor officiated at the marriage of Chris Vogel and Richard North in Winnipeg, marking the &quot;first same-sex marriage in Canada&quot;.

In March 2023, the Jubilee Mennonite Church, a congregation of the Canadian Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches located in Winnipeg, was expelled from the denomination over its decision to affirm same-sex marriages.

<doc id="991053" wikidata="Q1374194" url="?curid=991053" title="Programmer (hardware)">
<text>In the context of installing firmware onto a device, a programmer, device programmer, chip programmer, [[Programmable read-only memory#Programming|device burner]], or PROM writer is a device that writes, a.k.a. burns, firmware to a target device&#x27;s non-volatile memory. 

Typically, the target device memory is one of the following types: PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, Flash memory, eMMC, MRAM, FeRAM, NVRAM, PLD, PLA, PAL, GAL, CPLD, FPGA.

==Connection==

Generally, a programmer connects to a device in one of two ways.

===Insertion===

In some cases, the target device is inserted into a socket (usually ZIF) on the programmer. If the device is not a standard &quot;DIP packaging&quot;, a plug-in adapter board, which converts the footprint with another socket, is used.

===Cable &amp; port===

In some cases, a programmer connects to a device via a cable to a connection port on the device. This is sometimes called &quot;on-board programming&quot;, &quot;in-circuit programming&quot;, or &quot;in-system programming&quot;.

==Transfer==

Data is transferred from the programmer to the device as signals via connecting pins. 

Some devices have a serial interface
for receiving data (including JTAG interface).
Other devices communicate on parallel pins, followed by a programming pulse with a higher voltage for programming the data into the device.

Usually, a programmer is controlled via a connected personal computer through a parallel port,
USB port,
or LAN interface.
A program on the controlling computer interacts with the programmer to perform operations such as configure install parameters and program the device,

==Types==
There are four general types of programmers:

# Automated programmers often have multiple programming sites/sockets for mass production. Sometimes used with robotic pick and place handlers with on-board sites to support high volume and complex output such as laser marking, 3D inspection, tape input/output, etc.
# Development programmers usually have a single programming site; used for first article development and small-series production.
# Pocket programmers for development and field service.
# Specialized programmers for certain circuit types only, such as FPGA, microcontroller, and EEPROM programmers.

==History==
Regarding old PROM programmers, as the many programmable devices have different voltage requirements, every pin driver must be able to apply different voltages in a range of 025 Volts.
But according to the progress of memory device technology, recent flash memory programmers do not need high voltages.

In the early days of computing, booting mechanism was a mechanical devices usually consisted of switches and LEDs. It means the &quot;programmer&quot; was not an equipment but a human, who entered machine codes one by one, by setting the switches in a series of &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; positions. These positions of switches corresponded to the machine codes, similar to today&#x27;s assembly language.
Nowadays, EEPROMs are used for bootstrapping mechanism as BIOS, and no need to operate mechanical switches for programming.

<text>A sol is a colloidal suspension made out of tiny solid particles in a continuous liquid medium. Sols are stable, so that they do not settle down when left undisturbed, and exhibit the Tyndall effect, which is the scattering of light by the particles in the colloid. The size of the particles can vary from 1 nm - 100 nm. Examples include amongst others blood, pigmented ink, cell fluids, paint, antacids and mud.

Artificial sols can be prepared by two main methods: dispersion and condensation. In the dispersion method, solid particles are reduced to colloidal dimensions through techniques such as ball milling and Bredig&#x27;s arc method. In the condensation method, small particles are formed from larger molecules through a chemical reaction.

The stability of sols can be maintained through the use of dispersing agents, which prevent the particles from clumping together or settling out of the suspension. Sols are often used in the sol-gel process, in which a sol is converted into a gel through the addition of a crosslinking agent.

In a sol, solid particles are dispersed in a liquid continuous phase, while in an emulsion, liquid droplets are dispersed in a liquid or semi-solid continuous phase.
