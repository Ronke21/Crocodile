<text>==Before 1490==

According to Canadian scholar Adam Jones, if a dominant group of people had little in common with a marginalised group of people, it was easy for the dominant group to define the other as subhuman. As a result, the marginalised group might be labeled as a threat that must be eliminated. Jones continues: &quot;The difficulty, as Frank Chalk and Kurt Jonassohn pointed out in their early study, is that such historical records as exist are ambiguous and undependable. While history today is generally written with some fealty to &#x27;objective&#x27; facts, most previous accounts aimed rather to praise the writer&#x27;s patron (normally the leader) and to emphasise the superiority of one&#x27;s own gods and religious beliefs.&quot;

Chalk and Jonassohn wrote that: &quot;Historically and anthropologically peoples have always had a name for themselves. In a great many cases, that name meant &#x27;the people&#x27; to set the owners of that name off against all other people who were considered of lesser quality in some way. If the differences between the people and some other society were particularly large in terms of religion, language, manners, customs, and so on, then such others were seen as less than fully human: pagans, savages, or even animals.&quot;

===Neanderthal genocide===

Yarin Eski, a criminologist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, argues that &quot;genocidal violence and mass exploitation are perhaps &quot;the&quot; defining characteristics of being human,&quot; and he also describes how our talent for murder put an end to the Neanderthals, and it has also colored all subsequent human history. Similarly, Kwang Hyun Ho stresses the fact that modern humans possess a mutated gene which is related to aggression and combined with fossil evidence, the possession of it by early modern humans proves that the Neanderthals were killed in acts of violence which were committed by early modern humans. The first person to publish an analysis of a Neanderthal, French paleontologist Marcellin Boule, was also the first to suppose (in 1912) that early humans violently replaced Neanderthals. In particular, larger tribal groupings and projectile weapons were supposed to give modern humans an edge in violent conflicts with Neanderthals and other indigenous populations of archaic humans that allowed early modern humans to wipe out other hominin species as they spread out of Africa. This view is at odds with the more supported views that Neanderthal extinction occurred due to events such as interbreeding, inbreeding, disease, and climate change. Archaeologist Helle Vandkilde highlights how trauma that is indicative of interpersonal violence is only present in approximately 20 cases of Neanderthal and Homo sapiens skeletal remains in the Palaeolithic.

=== Chiefdom genocides ===
Historian Max Ostrovsky concludes that chiefdoms performed the most genocidal warfare in human history and practiced this kind of warfare all over the world, wherever culture reached the level of chiefdom. He based his conclusion on anthropological researches and notes that Thomas Malthus collected many reports on genocidal wars by chiefdoms. 

Malthus regards chiefdoms as an intermediate stage between independent tribes and states. By contrast to independent tribes, chiefdoms cumulated power after their decisive military victories but they did not learn to enslave their defeated enemies yet. Hence, according to Malthus, chiefdoms simply slaughtered them: &quot;Their object of war is not conquest but destruction... Among the Iroquois, the phrase by which they express their resolution to make war against an enemy is &#x27;let us go and eat that nation.&#x27;&quot;

The verb &quot;eat&quot; has a literal meaning. The cannibalism of chiefdoms appears in the military genocidal context which is referred to as &quot;post-battle rage&quot; rather than hunger. Immanuel Kant supposed that slavery and imperialism appeared at a later, albeit equally savage, stage, when peoples learned &quot;how to make better use of their conquered enemies than to dine off them.&quot;

Ostrovsky found that the hypothesis of chiefdom genocide applies to the Israelites of the Judges period (c. 1150–1025 BCE) when they formed a chiefdom (of twelve tribes): When Israel defeats the Canaanite nations, the tradition commands, &quot;you must devote them to complete destruction. You shall make no covenant with them and show no mercy to them&quot; (Deuteronomy 7:1–2). Similarly to the chiefdoms which are described in the Age of Discovery, the genocide of the Hebrew ban was total which means that it extended to women, children and domestic animals (1 Samuel 15:3). &quot;[You] must not leave anything that breathes&quot; (Deuteronomy 20:16). The Bible exaggerates when it claims that the genocide of the Canaanite peoples (Joshua 10:40–41, 11:21–23, 6:18–9) was total, but, according to Ostrovsky, &quot;whenever the Israelite chiefdom won, the vanquished did not survive.&quot; Given the vast data on chiefdom-level warfare, he finds the historicity of the Canaanite genocide credible.

Scholars devoted much of their attention to the Canaanite genocide and scholars of theology struggled to explain why Moses commanded the Israelites to wage a &quot;genocidal&quot; conquest of Canaan and the secular scholar Richard Dawkins characterises Yahweh as a &quot;genocidal&quot; and &quot;blood thirsty ethnic cleanser.&quot; The genocides which were committed during the Judges period were partial genocides, such as the destruction of the Midianites by the Israelites (Numbers 31:7–18). Adam Jones notes that this massacre is an example of the partial destruction and the partial incorporation of an enemy ethnicity.

Julius Caesar&#x27;s army waged a genocidal war against the Germanic chiefdoms (&quot;Gallic Wars&quot; 1:17). The &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot; recorded the impression of survivors from the onslaught of the chiefdom of the Vikings: &quot;Wild beasts... killing babies, children, young men, old men, fathers, sons and mothers... They overthrow, they despoil, they destroy, they burn, they ravage; sinister cohort, fatal phalanx, cruel host.&quot;

=== Gendercides ===
Scholars of antiquity differentiate genocides from gendercides, in which groups of people were conquered and the males who belonged to the conquered groups were killed but the children (particularly the girls) and the women were incorporated into the conquering groups. Jones notes, &quot;Chalk and Jonassohn provide a wide-ranging selection of historical events such as the Assyrian Empire&#x27;s root-and branch depredations in the first half of the first millennium BCE, and the destruction of Melos by Athens during the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BCE), a gendercidal rampage described by Thucydides in his &#x27;Melian Dialogue&#x27;. Jones and Wendy Lower also detail how gendercides are a common feature through much classical literature in the western tradition. Additionally, Jones highlights in an article published in the &quot;Journal of Genocide Research&quot; in 2000, that the gender specific targeting of men for extermination has persisted through many cases of conflict in the 20th century.

=== Prehistoric Andes ===
In the &quot;Cambridge World History of Genocide&quot;, anthropologist and archaeologist Danielle Kurin wrote that there is archaeological evidence of genocidal violence at various points in time in the prehistoric Andes in South America.

=== Destruction of Carthage ===

During the Third Punic War, the city of Carthage was besieged by Roman forces for three years (149–146 BCE). Once the city was breached, the Romans spent seven days systematically destroying it and killing its inhabitants. Ben Kiernan has labelled the devastation of the city and the massacre of its population &quot;the first genocide&quot;. Kiernan highlights calls for the destruction of Carthage before the third Punic war, and escalating rhetoric during the siege, with Polybius stating in his report from the battle that the Carthaginians were &quot;utterly exterminated&quot;.

Scholars Bridget Conley and Alex de Waal, as well as Lemkin considered the destruction of Carthage to have been genocidal.

=== Asiatic Vespers ===

In 88 BCE, king Mithridates VI of Pontus ordered the murder of all Italics in Asia Minor, resulting in the deaths of about 100,000, mainly civilians. The death toll makes it one of the deadliest recorded genocides in classical antiquity. This action provoked the Romans, leading to the First Mithridatic War.

=== Julius Caesar&#x27;s campaigns ===
Julius Caesar&#x27;s campaign against the Tencteri and Usipetes has been characterised as a genocide. During the Gallic Wars Caesar reported that he burnt every village and building that he could find in the territory of the Eburones, drove off all of the cattle, and his men and beasts consumed all of the corn that the weather of the autumnal season had not destroyed. He left those who had hid themselves, if there were any, alive in the hope that they would all die of hunger in the winter. Caesar said that he wanted to annihilate the Eburones as well as their name. Their country was soon occupied by a Germanic tribe with a different name, the Tungri. However, the report by Tacitus which states that the Tungri were the original &quot;Germani&quot; who first crossed the Rhine, and the way this matches Caesar&#x27;s description of the Eburones and their neighbours, leads to the possibility that they survived under a new name.

However, historian (2008) argues that the genocide of the Eburones in 53 BCE could not have happened as Caesar claimed. If the systematic destruction of infrastructure by the Roman forces was intended to prevent the local people from regaining power, the physical extermination of them proved to be impractical. The available areas of refuge which were hardly accessible to the Roman legions were numerous: the low mountain range of the Ardennes, the swamps and wastelands which were located towards the Menapii, the coastal islands, etc. Moreover, Caesar&#x27;s second attempt to annihilate the tribe two years later is proof that the community survived, and its apparent ability to regenerate itself lead Caesar to believe that he needed to launch more raids against them. According to Nico Roymans, their disappearance from the political map may have resulted from &quot;a policy of on the part of the Roman authorities, in combination with the confiscation of Eburonean territory&quot;. A great part of their gold fell into Roman hands during repeated Roman raids on the Eburones in 53–51 BCE, and then it was melted down and carried off.

=== Bar Kokhba revolt ===
The Bar Kokhba revolt (; ) was a rebellion against the Roman Empire by the Jews of the Roman province of Judea, led by Simon bar Kokhba. Waged from circa 132–136 CE, it was the last of three major Jewish–Roman wars. The revolt erupted as a result of religious and political tensions which existed in Judea since the end of the failed First Revolt in 66–73 CE. These tensions were exacerbated by the establishment of a large Roman military presence in Judea, changes in administrative life and the economy, together with the outbreak and suppression of Jewish revolts from Mesopotamia to Libya and Cyrenaica. The proximate reasons seem to be the construction of a new city, Aelia Capitolina, over the ruins of Jerusalem and the erection of a temple to Jupiter on the Temple Mount. The Church Fathers and rabbinic literature emphasise the role of Rufus, governor of Judea, in provoking the revolt. The Bar Kokhba revolt resulted in the extensive depopulation of Judean communities, more so than during the First Jewish–Roman War of 70 CE. According to Cassius Dio, 580,000 Jews perished in the war and many more died of hunger and disease. In addition, many Judean war captives were sold into slavery. The Jewish communities of Judea were devastated to an extent which some scholars describe as a genocide. However, the Jewish population remained strong in other parts of Palestine, thriving in Galilee, Golan, Bet Shean Valley and the eastern, southern and western edges of Judea. Roman casualties were also considered heavy—XXII &quot;Deiotariana&quot; was disbanded after serious losses. In addition, some historians argue that Legio IX Hispana&#x27;s disbandment in the mid-2nd century could have been a result of this war. In an attempt to erase any memory of Judea or Ancient Israel, Emperor Hadrian wiped the name off the map and replaced it with Syria Palaestina.

=== Jie and Wu Hu ===
The Later Zhao dynasty (319–351) was a Jie-led state that ruled most of northern China during the Sixteen Kingdoms period in the fourth century CE. At the time, northern China was home to many non-Han Chinese tribes collectively known in historiography as the Wu Hu or &quot;Five Barbarians&quot;, of which the Jie were one of them. In its final years, the Later Zhao fell into civil war between members of the imperial family over the throne. One powerful member, Shi Min (later known as Ran Min), was an adopted Han Chinese, and in 350, he seized control of the emperor and capital, Ye through a coup.

After surviving multiple assassination attempts, Shi Min concluded that he could no longer trust the Jie and other non-Han people under his command. In late 350, he issued an order to kill any Jie or central Asians found in the city of Ye, rewarding any Han Chinese for killing any Jie or &quot;barbarian&quot; person they find. Shi Min personally led his army to massacre the tribes in the capital, while ordering his generals to purge their armies of tribespeople. The Jie were an ethnic group which possessed racial characteristics which included high-bridged noses and bushy beards, and as a result, they were easily identified and killed. However, many of the people killed were also mistakenly-identified Han Chinese. In total, 200,000 of them were reportedly massacred. The historians David Graff and Victoria Tin-Bor Hui both describe the actions of Shi Min as a &quot;genocidal campaign&quot;, alongside historian Steven L. Jacobs who also considers it as an example of genocide.

=== Zandaqa ===
Zindīq () or Zandik () was initially used to negatively denote the followers of the Manichaeian religion in the Sasanian Empire. By the time of the 8th-century Abbasid Caliphate however, the meaning of the word zindīq and the adjectival &quot;zandaqa&quot; had broadened and could loosely denote many things: Gnostic Dualists as well as followers of Manichaeism, agnostics, and atheists. However, many of those who were persecuted for being &quot;zandaqa&quot; under the Abbasids claimed to be Muslims, and when it was applied to Muslims, the accusation was that the accused secretly harbored Manichaean beliefs. &quot;The proof for such an accusation was sought, if at all, in an indication of some kind of dualism, or if that individual openly flouted Islamic beliefs or practices.&quot; As such, certain Muslim poets of early Abbasid times could also be accused of being &quot;zandaqa&quot; as much as an actual Manichaean might be.

The charge of being a &quot;zandaqa&quot; was a serious one, and it could cost the accused his/her life. A history of the time cites the &quot;Spiller&quot; caliph Abu al-&#x27;Abbas as having said &quot;tolerance is laudable, except in matters which are dangerous to religious belief, or matters which are dangerous to the sovereign&#x27;s dignity.&quot; The third Abbasid caliph, Al-Mahdi, ordered the composition of polemical works that were to be used to refute the beliefs of freethinkers and other heretics, and for years, he attempted to completely exterminate them, hunting them down and exterminating freethinkers in large numbers, putting anyone who was merely suspected of being a &quot;zindiq&quot; to death. Al-Mahdi&#x27;s successors, the caliphs al-Hadi and Harun al-Rashid, continued the pogroms, although they occurred with diminished intensity during the reign of the latter and were later ended by him. In turn this policy influenced the Mihna policy of al-Ma&#x27;mun which targeted those Muslim religious scholars and officials who refused to accept the doctrine of the created nature of the Quran.

=== Ancestral Puebloans ===
A 2010 study suggests that a group of Ancestral Puebloans in the American Southwest were killed in a genocide that took place circa 800 CE.

=== Harrying of the North ===

The Harrying of the North was a series of military campaigns waged by William the Conqueror in the winter of 1069–1070 to subjugate Northern England, where the presence of the last Wessex claimant, Edgar Ætheling, had encouraged Anglo-Saxon Northumbrian, Anglo-Scandinavian and Danish rebellions. William&#x27;s strategy, implemented during the winter of 1069–70 (he spent Christmas 1069 in York), has been described by William E. Kapelle and some other modern scholars as an act of genocide. Medieval historian C. P. Lewis details how the consensus view of the Harrying of the North is that it was a particularly harsh course of action and that &quot;modern labelling commonly falls not far short of genocide.&quot; Lewis also highlights how the limitations of the evidence available mean it is difficult to assess whether the Harrying of the North meets any of the frameworks of genocide.

=== Medieval anti-Jewish massacres ===

From the 11th century to the 16th century, hundreds of massacres were committed against Jewish communities in Europe. The historian Maya Soifer Irish details how these pogroms meet the criteria of &quot;genocidal massacres&quot; as developed by the genocide scholars Leo Kuper and Ben Kiernan.

=== 13th-century extermination of the Cathars ===

The Albigensian Crusade or the Cathar Crusade (1209–1229) was a 20-year-long military campaign which Pope Innocent III initiated to eliminate Catharism in Languedoc, in Southern France. The Crusade was primarily prosecuted by the French crown and it promptly took on a political flavour. It resulted in a significant reduction in the number of practising Cathars, and realigned the County of Toulouse in Languedoc, bringing it into the sphere of the French crown, and diminishing the distinct regional culture and high level of influence of the Counts of Barcelona.

Raphael Lemkin, who coined the word &quot;genocide&quot; in the 20th century, referred to the Albigensian Crusade as &quot;one of the most conclusive cases of genocide in religious history&quot;. Mark Gregory Pegg wrote that &quot;The Albigensian Crusade ushered genocide into the West by linking divine salvation to mass murder, by making slaughter as loving an act as His sacrifice on the cross.&quot; 

Robert E. Lerner argues that Pegg&#x27;s classification of the Albigensian Crusade as a genocide is inappropriate, on the ground that it &quot;was proclaimed against unbelievers ... not against a &#x27;genus&#x27; or people; those who joined the crusade had no intention of annihilating the population of southern France ... If Pegg wishes to connect the Albigensian Crusade to modern ethnic slaughter, well—words fail me (as they do him).&quot; 

Laurence Marvin is not as dismissive as Lerner regarding Pegg&#x27;s contention that the Albigensian Crusade was a genocide. He does however take issue with Pegg&#x27;s argument that the Albigensian Crusade formed an important historical precedent for later genocides, including the Holocaust.

Kurt Jonassohn and Karin Solveig Björnson describe the Albigensian Crusade as &quot;the first ideological genocide&quot;. Kurt Jonassohn and Frank Chalk, who together founded the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies, include a detailed case study of the Albigensian Crusade in their genocide studies textbook &quot;The History and Sociology of Genocide: Analyses and Case Studies&quot;, authored by Joseph R. Strayer and Malise Ruthven.

In 2023, Pegg highlights in the &quot;Cambridge World History of Genocide&quot;, how since his 2008 work a variety of other scholars from different disciplinary backgrounds have concluded that the Albigensian crusade was genocidal in nature.

=== Mongol Empire ===
Quoting Eric Margolis, Jones claims that in the 13th century, the Mongol armies under Genghis Khan were genocidal killers who were known to eradicate whole nations. He ordered the extermination of the Tata Mongols, and all Kankali males in Bukhara who were &quot;taller than a wheel&quot; using a technique called measuring against the linchpin. In the end, half of the Mongol tribes were exterminated by Genghis Khan. Rosanne Klass referred to the Mongols&#x27; rule of Afghanistan as &quot;genocide&quot;. It has been estimated that approximately 11% of the world&#x27;s population was killed either during or immediately after the Turco-Mongol invasions (around 37.75 – 60 million people were killed during the genocide which was committed in Eurasia, out of which at least 35 million people were killed in China). If these calculations are accurate, these events would constitute the deadliest acts of mass killing in human history.
The second campaign against the Western Xia, the final military action which was led by Genghis Khan, because he died during it, involved the intentional and systematic destruction of Western Xia cities and culture. According to John Man, because of this policy of total obliteration, Western Xia is little known to anyone other than experts in the field because very few records of the existence of that society still exist. He states that &quot;There is a case to be made that this was the first ever recorded example of attempted genocide. It was certainly very successful &quot;ethnocide&quot;.&quot;

Historian and specialist on the Mongol empire, Timothy May, details how genocide scholars have been divided as to whether the Mongol conquests should be considered a case of genocide. He then argues that while the Mongols frequently employed massacres as a tool of war during their conquests, they could only be described as genocidal in some cases. Two Mongol military campaigns which can be considered genocidal are the massacre of the Tanguts at Zhongxing and the massacre of the Nizari Ismailis.

=== Tamerlane ===

Similarly, the extreme brutality of the Turco-Mongol conqueror Tamerlane was well-documented and his conquests were accompanied by genocidal massacres. William Rubinstein wrote: &quot;In Assyria (1393–4)—Tamerlane got around—he killed all the Christians he could find, including everyone in the, then, Christian city of Tikrit, thus virtually destroying Assyrian Church of the East. Impartially, however, Tamerlane also slaughtered Shi&#x27;ite Muslims, Jews and heathens.&quot;

=== Thule expansionism ===
Evidence suggests that the Inuit are the descendants of the Birnirk culture of Siberia and Alaska, who expanded into northern Canada and Greenland, where they completely replaced the Indigenous Dorset people through the Thule culture, both genetically and culturally, sometime after 1300 AD. The question of why the Dorset disappeared so completely has led some to suggest that Thule invaders wiped out the Dorset people in &quot;an example of prehistoric genocide.&quot;

=== Mongols in the Delhi Sultanate ===

In 1311, the Delhi Sultanate&#x27;s ruler Alauddin Khalji ordered a massacre of the &quot;New Muslims&quot; (Mongols who had recently converted to Islam), after some Mongol &quot;amirs&quot; of Delhi conspired to kill him. According to chronicler Ziauddin Barani, 20,000 or 30,000 Mongols were killed as a result of this order.

=== Guanches ===

The conquest of the Canary Islands by the Crown of Castille took place between 1402 and 1496. Initially carried out by Norman aristocrats on behalf of the Castilian nobility in exchange for a covenant of allegiance to the crown, the process was later carried out by the Spanish crown itself during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs. Some historians have labelled the conquest genocidal in nature due to the brutal treatment of the Islands&#x27; indigenous Guanches which contributed to their extinction as a distinct group. Historian wrote in 1978 that the conquest of the islands constituted a genocide. Historian Daniele Conversi locates the conquest of the Canary Islands within the history of colonial and imperial genocides. Genocide scholar Mark Levene has stated that while there was not the intent by the Castilian crown to commit genocide, the result of their conquest was the same as if they had intended to commit genocide. Historian and specialist in genocide studies Mohamed Adhikari published an article in 2017 analysing the settler colonial history of the Canary Islands as a case of genocide, saying that the Canary Islands were the scene of &quot;Europe&#x27;s first overseas settler colonial genocide,&quot; and that the mass killing and enslavement of natives, along with forced deportation, sexual violence and confiscation of land and children constituted an attempt to &quot;destroy in whole&quot; the Guanche people. The tactics used in the Canary Islands in the 15th century served as a model for the Iberian colonisation of the Americas.

==1490 to 1914==

=== Africa ===
==== Atlantic Slave Trade ====
The transatlantic slave trade resulted in a vast and as yet unknown loss of life for African captives both in and outside the Americas. Estimates have ranged from as low as 2 million to as high 60 million. Patrick Manning estimates that about 12 million slaves entered the Atlantic trade between the 16th and 19th centuries, but about 1.5 million died on board ship. About 10.5 million slaves arrived in the Americas. Besides the slaves who died on the Middle Passage, more Africans likely died during the slave raids and wars in Africa and forced marches to ports. Manning estimates that 4 million died inside Africa after capture, and many more died young. Manning&#x27;s estimate covers the 12 million who were originally destined for the Atlantic, as well as the 6 million destined for Arabian slave markets and the 8 million destined for African markets. Of the slaves shipped to the Americas, the largest share went to Brazil and the Caribbean.

Canadian scholar Adam Jones characterised the mass death of millions of Africans during the Atlantic slave trade as a genocide due to the fact that it was &quot;one of the worst holocausts in human history&quot; because it resulted in 15 to 20 million deaths according to one estimate, and he contradicts arguments such as the one which states that &quot;it was in slave owners&#x27; interest to keep slaves alive, not exterminate them&quot; by stating that they are &quot;mostly sophistry&quot; by stating: &quot;the killing and destruction were intentional, whatever the incentives to preserve survivors of the Atlantic passage for labor exploitation. To revisit the issue of intent already touched on: If an institution is deliberately maintained and expanded by discernible agents, though all are aware of the hecatombs of casualties it is inflicting on a definable human group, then why should this not qualify as genocide?&quot;

==== Congo ====


From 1885 to 1908, the Congo Free State in central Africa was privately controlled by Leopold II, the second King of the Belgians from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who extracted a fortune from the land by the use of forced labour of natives. Under his regime, there were 2 to 15 million deaths among the Congolese people. Deliberate killings, abusive punishments, and general exploitation were major causes of the deaths. As in the colonisation of the Americas, European diseases, hitherto unknown in the region, also led to a considerable number of deaths. Because the main motive for the killings was financial gain, it has been debated whether the term &quot;genocide&quot; describes these atrocities well. The journalist Adam Hochschild, writing in &quot;King Leopold&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, stated that the level of killing in the Congo was of a &quot;genocidal proportion&quot;, but did not consider it a genocide as, according to Hochschild, King Leopold&#x27;s aim was not the extermination of the Congolese people.

Raphael Lemkin considered the crimes in the Congo to be an unambiguous case of genocide. Robert Weisbord wrote in the &quot;Journal of Genocide Research&quot; in 2003 that attempting to eliminate a portion of the population is enough to qualify as genocide under the UN convention, this has more recently been supported by historian Dean Pavlakis, who argues that the atrocities in the Congo Free State meet the requisite criteria of the UN Genocide Convention. Reports of the atrocities led to a major international scandal in the early 20th century, and Leopold was ultimately forced in 1908 by the Belgian government to relinquish control of the colony to the civil administration.

==== Ethiopia under Menelik II (1889–1913) ====
During its military conquests, its centralisation of its power and its incorporation of territories into Ethiopia as decreed by Menelik II, his army committed genocidal atrocities against civilians and combatants which included torture, mass killings and the imposition of large scale slavery. Large scale atrocities were also committed against the Dizi people and the people of the Kaficho kingdom. Some estimates of the number of people who were killed in the atrocities that were committed during the war and the famine which coincided with it go into the millions. According to Alexander Bulatovich, Menelik&#x27;s Russian military aide, Menelik&#x27;s armies &quot;dreadfully annihilated more than half&quot; of the Oromo (Galla) population down to 5 million people, which &quot;took away from the Galla all possibility of thinking about any sort of uprising.&quot; Eshete Gemeda put the death toll even higher at 6 million.

These deaths may have also been caused by the great famine, which lasted from 1888 to 1892 and was the worst famine in the region&#x27;s history; a third of Ethiopia&#x27;s total population of 12 million was killed according to some estimates. The famine was caused by rinderpest, an infectious viral cattle disease which wiped out most of the national livestock, killing over 90% of the cattle. The population of native cattle had no prior exposure to the disease and as a result, it was unable to fight it off. Despite the violence of the conquest, some historians stress the fact that before the centralisation process was completed, Ethiopia was devastated by numerous wars which started in the 16th century. In the intervening period, military tactics had not changed much. In the 16th century, the Portuguese Bermudes documented depopulation and widespread atrocities against civilians and combatants (atrocities which included torture, mass killings and the imposition of large scale slavery) during several successive Aba Gedas&#x27; Gadaa conquests of territories which were located north of the Genale river (Bali, Amhara, Gafat, Damot, Adal). Warfare in the region essentially involved acquiring cattle and slaves, winning additional territories, gaining control of trade routes and carrying out ritual requirements or securing trophies to prove masculinity. Wars were fought between people who might be members of the same linguistic group, religion and culture, or between unrelated tribes. Centralisation greatly reduced these continuous wars; minimising the loss of lives, raids, destruction and slavery that had previously been the norm.

==== French conquest of Algeria ====

Ben Kiernan wrote in his book &quot;Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur&quot; on the French conquest of Algeria, that within three decades of the French conquest of Algeria in 1830, war, genocidal massacres, and famine had reduced the original population from 3 million by a figure ranging from 500,000 to 1,000,000.

By 1875, the French conquest was complete. The war had killed approximately 825,000 indigenous Algerians since 1830. A long shadow of genocidal hatred persisted, provoking a French author to protest in 1882 that in Algeria, &quot;we hear it repeated every day that we must expel the native and if necessary destroy him.&quot; As a French statistical journal urged five years later, &quot;the system of extermination must give way to a policy of penetration.&quot;

Historian William Gallois argues that using a variety of frameworks, the conquest of Algeria should be considered a case of genocide.

In response to France&#x27;s recognition of Armenian genocide, Turkey accused France of committing genocide against 15% of Algeria&#x27;s population.

==== German East Africa ====

The Maji Maji Rebellion (, ), was an armed rebellion of Africans against German colonial rule in German East Africa. The war was triggered by German colonial policies which were designed to force the indigenous population to grow cotton for export. The war lasted from 1905 to 1907, during which 75,000 to 300,000 died, overwhelmingly from famine. The end of the war was followed by a period of famine, known as the Great Hunger (&quot;ukame&quot;), caused in large part by the scorched-earth policies used by governor von Götzen to suppress the rebellion. These tactics have been described by scholars as genocidal.

==== German South West Africa ====
Identified as the first genocide of the 20th century, the Herero and Namaqua peoples of present-day Namibia endured a genocidal persecution between 1904 and 1907 while their homeland was under colonial rule as German South West Africa. Large percentages of their populations perished in a brutal scorched earth campaign led by German General Lothar von Trotha. An estimated 10,000 Nama were killed, with estimates for the Herero ranging from 60,000 and 100,000. Historian Leonor Faber-Jonker highlights how genocidal violence in German South-West Africa was built up to with ever more eterminatory wars during the late 19th century.

Beginning as an insurrection against German colonial rule, the Herero Wars almost immediately developed into a genocide of the indigenous insurrectionists, with Trotha issuing his Extermination Order in October 1904, a copy of which survives in the Botswana National Archives. The order states &quot;every Herero, with or without a gun, with or without cattle, will be shot. I will no longer accept women or children, I will drive them back to their people [to die in the desert] or let them be shot at.&quot; Olusoga and Erichsen write: &quot;It is an almost unique document: an explicit, written declaration of intent to commit genocide.&quot; Trotha further explained that the German response to the indigenous insurrection &quot;is and remains the beginning of a racial struggle&quot;.

Many of those not killed were moved to concentration camps, such as Shark Island, after the destruction of their villages, where many succumbed to starvation. These concentration camps were also the location of medical experiments by German eugenicists such as Eugen Fischer.

==== Zulu Kingdom under Shaka Zulu ====

Between 1810 and 1828, the Zulu kingdom under Shaka Zulu and Dingane laid waste to large parts of present-day South Africa and Zimbabwe. Frequently, Zulu armies not only aimed to defeat their enemies, they aimed to totally destroy them. Those who were exterminated included prisoners of war, women, children and even dogs. Estimates of the death toll range from 1 million to 2 million.

=== Americas ===

According to &quot;The Cambridge World History&quot;, the &quot;Oxford Handbook of Genocide Studies&quot;, and the &quot;Cambridge World History of Genocide&quot;, colonial policies in some cases included the deliberate genocide of indigenous peoples in North America. According to Harald E. Braun, Spanish colonisation of the Americas also included genocidal massacres.

According to historian David Stannard, over the course of more than four centuries &quot;from the 1490s into the 1890s, Europeans and white Americans engaged in an unbroken string of genocide campaigns against the native peoples of the Americas.&quot; Stannard writes that the native population had been reduced savagely by invasions of European plague and violence and that by around 1900 only one-third of one percent of America&#x27;s population—250,000 out of 76,000,000 people–were natives. He calls it &quot;the worst human holocaust the world had ever witnessed&quot;, and it leveled off because &quot;there was, at last, almost no one left to kill.&quot; 
On 20 January 1513, Vasco Núñez de Balboa wrote to the king advocating genocide against the native population in the Caribbean. Balboa slew hundreds in Caribbean villages. The crown later withdrew support and Balboa was executed in 1519.

Raphael Lemkin considered colonial abuses of the Native population of the Americas to constitute cultural and even outright genocide including the abuses of the Encomienda system. He described slavery as &quot;cultural genocide par excellence&quot; noting &quot;it is the most effective and thorough method of destroying culture, of desocialising human beings.&quot; He considers colonists guilty due to failing to halt the abuses of the system despite royal orders. He also notes the sexual abuse by Spanish colonisers of Native women as acts of &quot;biological genocide.&quot; In this vein, Stannard described the encomienda as a genocidal system which &quot;had driven many millions of native peoples in Central and South America to early and agonising deaths.&quot;

Anthropologist Jason Hickel asserts that during Spanish rule of Hispaniola, many Arawaks died from lethal forced labour in the mines, in which a third of workers died every six months and that within two years of the arrival of Christopher Columbus half the population of Hispaniola had been killed. According to anthropologist Russell Thornton, for the American Indians &quot;the arrival of the Europeans marked the beginning of a long holocaust, although it came not in ovens, as it did for the Jews. The fires that consumed North America Indians were the fevers brought on by newly encountered diseases, the flashes of settlers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; guns, the ravages of &#x27;firewater,&#x27; the flames of villages and fields burned by the scorched-earth policy of vengeful Euro-Americans.&quot; Some authors, including Holocaust scholar David Cesarani, have argued that United States government policies in furtherance of its so-called Manifest Destiny constituted genocide.

Some historians disagree that genocide, defined as a crime of intent, should be used to describe the colonisation experience. Stafford Poole, a research historian, wrote: &quot;There are other terms to describe what happened in the Western Hemisphere, but genocide is not one of them. It is a good propaganda term in an age where slogans and shouting have replaced reflection and learning, but to use it in this context is to cheapen both the word itself and the appalling experiences of the Jews and Armenians, to mention but two of the major victims of this century.&quot; Noble David Cook, writing about the Black Legend and the conquest of the Americas, wrote that &quot;there were too few Spaniards to have killed the millions who were reported to have died in the first century after Old and New World contact&quot;. He instead estimates that the death toll was caused by diseases like smallpox, which according to some estimates had an 80–90% fatality rate in Native American populations. Political scientist Guenter Lewy says &quot;even if up to 90 percent of the reduction in Indian population was the result of disease, that leaves a sizable death toll caused by mistreatment and violence&quot;; however, he rejected calling it genocide stating that 

Historian Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz opposes these viewpoints and says, &quot;Proponents of the default position emphasise attrition by disease despite other causes equally deadly, if not more so. In doing so they refuse to accept that the colonisation of America was genocidal by plan, not simply the tragic fate of populations lacking immunity to disease. In the case of the Jewish Holocaust, no one denies that more Jews died of starvation, overwork, and disease under Nazi incarceration than died in gas ovens, yet the acts of creating and maintaining the conditions that led to those deaths clearly constitute genocide.&quot;

Historian Andrés Reséndez argues that even though the Spanish were aware of the spread of smallpox, they made no mention of it until 1519, a quarter century after Columbus arrived in Hispaniola. Instead he contends that enslavement in gold and silver mines was the primary reason why the Native American population of Hispaniola dropped so significantly. and that even though disease was a factor, the native population would have rebounded the same way Europeans did following the Black Death if it were not for the constant enslavement they were subject to. He contends that enslavement of Native Americans was one of the causes of their depopulation in North America; that the majority of the Native Americans enslaved were women and children compared to the enslavement of Africans which mostly targeted adult males and in turn they were sold at a 50% to 60% higher price, and that 2,462,000 to 4,985,000 Native Americans were enslaved between Columbus&#x27;s arrival and 1900 throughout the Americas.

Several films and books on the subject were released around the year 1992 to coincide with the 500th anniversary of Columbus&#x27; voyage. In 2003, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez urged Latin Americans not to celebrate the Columbus Day holiday. Chavez blamed Columbus for spearheading &quot;the biggest invasion and genocide ever seen in the history of humanity.&quot;

According to scientists from University College London, the colonisation of the Americas caused so much disease and death in the 100 years after 1492, that it contributed to climate change and global cooling. The depopulation caused the abandonment and reforestation of large areas of farmland, resulting in large enough decreases in carbon dioxide to cool the earth.

==== Argentina ====

The Conquest of the Desert was a military campaign mainly directed by General Julio Argentino Roca in the 1870s, which established Argentine dominance over Patagonia, then inhabited by indigenous peoples, killing more than 1,300.

Contemporary sources indicate that it was a deliberate genocide by the Argentine government, with Argentine troops committing mass executions, reports of nations being &quot;wiped out of existence&quot;, and those not killed were often deported from Patagonia. Others perceived the campaign as intending to suppress only groups of indigenous people that refused to submit to the government and carried out attacks on European settlements.

==== Argentina and Chile ====
The Selk&#x27;nam genocide was the systematic extermination of the Selk&#x27;nam people, one of the four indigenous peoples of Tierra del Fuego archipelago, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Historians estimate that the genocide spanned a period of between ten and twenty years, and resulted in the decline of the Selk&#x27;nam population from approximately 4,000 people during the 1880s to a few hundred by the early 1900s.

==== Canada ====

===== Ontario =====
As part of the broader Beaver Wars, between 1640 and 1649, among the Indigenous peoples in Canada, the Iroquois conducted a genocidal war against the Huron people. Settlements were burned, and of the 30,000 Hurons, a few thousand were able to flee and avoid becoming victims of the ethnic genocide. Ned Blackhawk, in analysing the war between the Iroquois and Huron, found that the Iroquois committed all five acts described in the 1948 Genocide Convention.

===== Newfoundland =====

The Beothuks attempted to avoid contact with Europeans in Newfoundland by moving from their traditional settlements, into ecosystems unable to support them, causing under-nourishment and, eventually, starvation. The Beothuks&#x27; main food sources were caribou, fish, and seals; their forced displacement deprived them of two of these. This led to the over-hunting of caribou, leading to a decrease in the caribou population in Newfoundland. The Beothuks emigrated from their traditional land and lifestyle, attempting to avoid contact with Europeans, into ecosystems unable to support them, causing under-nourishment and, eventually, starvation. Scholars disagree in their definition of genocide in relation to the Beothuk. While some scholars believe that the Beothuk died out as an unintended consequence of European colonisation, others argue that Europeans conducted a sustained campaign of genocide against them. They were officially declared &quot;extinct&quot; after the death of Shanawdithit in 1829 in the capital, St. John&#x27;s, where she had been taken.

===== Dominion of Canada =====
Beginning in 1874 and lasting until 1996, the Canadian government, in partnership with the dominant Christian Churches, ran 130 residential boarding schools across Canada for Aboriginal children, who were forcibly taken from their homes. Over the course of the system&#x27;s existence, about 30% of native children, or roughly 150,000, were placed in residential schools nationally; at least 6,000 of these students died while in attendance. While the schools provided some education, they were plagued by under-funding, disease, abuse, and sexual abuse. The negative effects of the residential school system have long been accepted almost unanimously among scholars researching the residential school system, with debate focussing on the motives and intent.

Indigenous people of Canada have long referred to the residential school system as genocide, with scholars referring to the system as genocidal since the 1990s. According to some scholars, the Canadian government&#x27;s laws and policies, including the residential school system, that encouraged or required Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a Eurocentric society, violated the United Nations Genocide Convention that Canada signed in 1949 and passed through Parliament in 1952. Therefore, these scholars believe that Canada could be tried in international court for genocide. Others also point to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which was adopted into Canadian law in 2010, where article 7 discusses the rights of indigenous people to not be subjected to genocide or &quot;any other act of violence, including forcibly removing children of the group to another group&quot;.

==== Haiti ====
Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the first ruler of an independent Haiti, ordered the killing of the white population of French creoles on Haiti, which culminated in the 1804 Haitian massacre. According to Philippe Girard, &quot;when the genocide was over, Haiti&#x27;s white population was virtually non-existent.&quot;

==== Hispaniola ====
The Taíno genocide refers to the extermination of the indigenous population of Hispaniola due to forced labor and exploitation by the Spanish. Raphael Lemkin considered Spain&#x27;s abuses of the native population of the Americas to constitute cultural and even outright genocide including the abuses of the system. University of Hawaii historian David Stannard describes the as a genocidal system which &quot;had driven many millions of native peoples in Central and South America to early and agonising deaths.&quot; Yale University&#x27;s genocide studies program supports this view regarding the abuses in Hispaniola. Andrés Reséndez argues that even though the Spanish were aware of the spread of smallpox, they made no mention of it until 1519, a quarter century after Columbus arrived in Hispaniola. Instead he contends that enslavement in gold and silver mines was the primary reason why the Native American population of Hispaniola dropped so significantly and that even though disease was a factor, the native population would have rebounded the same way Europeans did during the Black Death if it were not for the constant enslavement they were subject to. According to anthropologist Jason Hickel, a third of Arawak workers died every six months from lethal forced labor in the mines. Conley and de Waal highlight the weaponisation of starvation employed by conquistadors against the Taíno as being a contributing factor to the genocide, and historian Harald E. Braun highlight Jaragua massacre in 1503 as a case of genocidal massacre.

==== Mexico ====

===== Yucatán =====

The Caste War of Yucatán (approx. 1847–1901) against the population of European descent, known locally as &quot;Yucatecos&quot;, who held political and economic control of the region. Adam Jones wrote:
&quot;Genocidal atrocities on both sides cost up to 200,000 killed&quot;.

===== Apaches =====
In 1835, Don Ignacio Zuniga, commander of the presidios of northern Sonora, asserted that since 1820, the Apaches had killed at least 5,000 Mexican settlers in retaliation for land encroachments in &quot;Apachería&quot;. The State of Sonora then offered a bounty on Apache scalps in 1835. Beginning in 1837, the State of Chihuahua also offered a bounty of 100 pesos per warrior, 50 pesos per woman and 25 pesos per child.

===== Yaquis =====

The Mexican government&#x27;s response to the various uprisings of the Yaqui tribe have been likened to genocide particularly under Porfirio Diaz. By the end of Diaz&#x27;s rule at least 20,000 Yaquis were killed in Sonora and their population was reduced from 30,000 to 7,000. Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he&#x27;d be willing to offer apologies for the abuses in 2019.

==== New England colonies ====

The Pequot War was an armed conflict that started in 1636 and ended in 1638 in New England, between the Pequot tribe and an alliance of the colonists from the Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Saybrook colonies and their allies from the Narragansett and Mohegan tribes. The war concluded with the decisive defeat of the Pequot. At the end, about 700 Pequots had been killed or taken into captivity. Hundreds of prisoners were sold into slavery to colonists in Bermuda or the West Indies; other survivors were dispersed as captives to the victorious tribes. Scholars such as Michael Freeman and Benjamin Madley have concluded that the war was genocidal in nature, with Madley arguing that it set a precedent for colonial relations with Native Americans going forward.

==== Peru ====
The Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II was an uprising by &quot;cacique&quot;-led Aymara, Quechua, and &quot;mestizo&quot; rebels aimed at overthrowing Spanish colonial rule in Peru from 1780 to 1783. During the rebellion, especially after the death of Túpac Amaru II, non-Indians were systematically killed by the rebels. Some historians have described these killings aimed at non-Indians, in conjunction with attempts to violently eradicate various non-Indian cultural customs, as genocidal in nature.

The Putumayo genocide was hunting and enslavement of members of the Huitoto, Andoques, Yaguas, Ocaina and Boras groups by the Peruvian Amazon Company, so they could be used to extract latex. During this time period, several tribes became extinct, with 80–86% of the total population in the Putumayo region perishing during the Amazon rubber boom.

==== St Kitts ====

The Kalinago genocide was the genocidal massacre of an estimated 2,000 Kalinago people by English and French settlers on the island of Saint Kitts in 1626.

==== United States ====

According to Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, US history as well as inherited Indigenous trauma cannot be understood without dealing with the genocide that the United States committed against Indigenous peoples. Ortiz states that from the colonial period through the founding of the United States and continuing in the twentieth century, this has entailed torture, terror, sexual abuse, massacres, systematic military occupations, removals of Indigenous peoples from their ancestral territories, forced removal of Native American children to military-like boarding schools, allotment, and a policy of termination.

The leader of this battle, British High Commander Jeffery Amherst authorised the intentional use of disease as a biological weapon, notably during the 1763 Siege of Fort Pitt against indigenous populations, saying, &quot;You will Do well to try to Innoculate the Indians by means of Blankets, as well as to try Every other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race.&quot;, and instructing his subordinates, &quot;I need only Add, I Wish to Hear of no prisoners should any of the villains be met with arms.&quot; British militia&#x27;s William Trent and Simeon Ecuyer gave smallpox-exposed blankets to Native American emissaries as gifts during the Siege of Fort Pitt, &quot;to Convey the Smallpox to the Indians&quot;, in one of the most famously documented cases of germ warfare. While it is uncertain how successful such attempts were against the target population, historians have noted that, &quot;history records numerous instances of the French, the Spanish, the British, and later on the American, using smallpox as an ignoble means to an end. For smallpox was more feared by the Indian than the bullet: he could be exterminated and subjugated more easily and quickly by the death-bringing virus than by the weapons of the white man.&quot;
During the American Indian Wars, the United States Army carried out a number of massacres and forced relocations of Indigenous peoples, acts that some scholars say constitute genocide. The Sand Creek massacre, which caused outrage in its own time, has been called genocide. General John Chivington led a 700-man force of Colorado Territory militia in a massacre of 70–163 peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho, about two-thirds of whom were women, children, and infants. Chivington and his men took scalps and other body parts as trophies, including human fetuses and male and female genitalia. In defense of his actions Chivington stated,
A study by Gregory Michno concluded that of 21,586 tabulated casualties (killed, wounded or captured) in a selected 672 battles and skirmishes, military personnel and settlers accounted for 6,596 (31%), while indigenous casualties totalled about 14,990 (69%) for the period 1850–90. Michno&#x27;s study almost exclusively uses Army estimates. His follow-up book &quot;Forgotten Battles and Skirmishes&quot; covers over 300 additional fights not included in these statistics.

According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), between 1789 and 1891, &quot;The Indian wars under the government of the United States have been more than 40 in number. They have cost the lives of about 19,000 white men, women and children, including those killed in individual combats, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians. The actual number of killed and wounded Indians must be very much higher than the given... Fifty percent additional would be a safe estimate...&quot; In the same 1894 report, the Census Bureau dismissed assertions that millions of Native Americans once inhabited what is now the United States, insisting instead that North America in 1492 was an almost empty continent, and &quot;guesstimating&quot; that aboriginal populations &quot;could not have exceeded much over 500,000&quot;, whereas modern scholarship now estimates from 2.1 million to more than 10 million.
Chalk and Jonassohn argued that the deportation of the Cherokee tribe along the Trail of Tears would almost certainly be considered an act of genocide today. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 led to the exodus. About 17,000 Cherokees—along with approximately 2,000 Cherokee-owned black slaves—were removed from their homes. The number of people who died as a result of the Trail of Tears has been variously estimated. American doctor and missionary Elizur Butler, who made the journey with one party, estimated 4,000 deaths. Historians David Stannard and Barbara Mann have noted that the army deliberately routed the march of the Cherokee to pass through areas of known cholera epidemic, such as Vicksburg. Stannard estimates that during the forced removal from their homelands, following the Indian Removal Act signed into law by President Andrew Jackson in 1830, 8,000 Cherokee died, about half the total population.

A smallpox epidemic struck the Great Plains in 1836–1840, resulting in the deaths of many, including 90% of the Mandan who previously numbered 1,600. While specific responsibility for the epidemic remains in question, scholars have asserted that the Great Plains epidemic was &quot;started among the tribes of the upper Missouri River by failure to quarantine steam boats on the river&quot;, and Captain Pratt of the &quot;St. Peter&quot; &quot;was guilty of contributing to the deaths of thousands of innocent people. The law calls his offense criminal negligence. Yet in light of all the deaths, the almost complete annihilation of the Mandans, and the terrible suffering the region endured, the label criminal negligence is benign, hardly befitting an action that had such horrendous consequences.&quot; Archaeologist and anthropologist Ann F. Ramenofsky writes, &quot;&quot;Variola Major&quot; can be transmitted through contaminated articles such as clothing or blankets. In the nineteenth century, the U. S. Army sent contaminated blankets to Native Americans, especially Plains groups, to control the Indian problem.&quot; According to Alexander Hinton, &quot;the genocide of many Native American tribes&quot; including the Mandans, was caused by &quot;governmental assimilationist policies that coexisted with officially or unofficially sanctioned campaigns of war to eradicate, diminish, or forcibly evict the &#x27;savages. When smallpox swept the northern plains of the US in 1837, Secretary of War Lewis Cass ordered that the Mandan (along with the Arikara, the Cree, and the Blackfeet) not be given smallpox vaccinations, which had been provided to other tribes in other areas. Some have posited that some tribes weren&#x27;t given vaccines because they were hostile or because their land wasn&#x27;t important for trading.
The U.S. colonisation of California started in earnest in 1849, and it resulted in a large number of state-subsidised massacres of the Indigenous peoples of California by colonists in the territory, causing several ethnic groups to be entirely wiped out. In one such series of conflicts, the so-called Mendocino War and the subsequent Round Valley War, the entirety of the Yuki people were brought to the brink of extinction, from a previous population of some 3,500 people to fewer than 100. According to Russell Thornton, estimates of the pre-Columbian Indigenous population of California were at least 310,000, and perhaps as high as 705,000, but by 1849, due to Spanish and Mexican colonisation and epidemics this number had decreased to 100,000, and from 1849 to 1890, the indigenous population of California had fallen below 20,000, primarily because of the killings. In &quot;An American Genocide, The United States and the California Catastrophe, 1846–1873&quot;, historian Benjamin Madley recorded the number of killings of Indigenous Californians that occurred between 1846 and 1873. He found evidence that during this period, at least 9,400 to 16,000 Native Americans were killed by non-Indigenous. Most of these killings occurred in more than 370 massacres (defined as the &quot;intentional killing of five or more disarmed combatants or largely unarmed noncombatants, including women, children, and prisoners, whether in the context of a battle or otherwise&quot;). 10,000 Native Americans were also kidnapped and enslaved. In a speech before representatives of Native American peoples in June 2019, California governor Gavin Newsom apologised for the genocide. Newsom said, &quot;That&#x27;s what it was, a genocide. No other way to describe it. And that&#x27;s the way it needs to be described in the history books.&quot;

Indeed, noted children&#x27;s book author of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, L. Frank Baum, contemporaneously and freely admitted to the definition of genocide—annihilation of a people—as being deliberately intended, in the aftermath of the Wounded Knee massacre and slaughter of the Lakota and their leader Sitting Bull:

&quot;The Whites, by law of conquest, by justice of civilisation, are masters of the American continent, and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation of the few remaining Indians. Why not annihilation? Their glory has fled, their spirit broken, their manhood effaced; better that they die than live the miserable wretches that they are.&quot;

In line with Dunbar-Ortiz&#x27;s assessment, historian Preston McBride argues that the American Indian boarding school system meets the same criteria for genocide as was found in investigations into the Canadian Indian boarding school system.

==== Uruguay ====
The Massacre of Salsipuedes was a genocidal attack carried out on 11 April 1831 by the Uruguayan Army, led by Fructuoso Rivera, as the culmination of the state&#x27;s efforts to eradicate the Charrúa from Uruguay. According to official reports, 40 were killed and 300 were taken prisoner, with an uncertain number managing to escape.

=== Asia ===

==== Afghanistan ====
Abdur Rahman&#x27;s subjugation of the Hazara ethnic group in the late nineteenth century due to its fierce rebellion against the Afghan king gave birth to an intense feeling of hatred between the Pashtun and the Hazara that would last for years to come. Massive forced displacements, especially in Oruzgan and Daychopan, continued as lands were confiscated and populations were expelled or fled. Some 35,000 families fled to northern Afghanistan, Mashhad (Iran) and Quetta (Pakistan). It is estimated that more than 60% of the Hazara were either massacred or displaced during Abdur Rahman&#x27;s campaign against them. Hazara farmers were often forced to give up their property to Pashtuns and as a result many Hazara families had to move seasonally to the major cities in Afghanistan, Iran, or Pakistan to find jobs and sources of income.

==== British rule of India ====

Mike Davis argues in his book &quot;Late Victorian Holocausts&quot; that quote; &quot;Millions died, not outside the &#x27;modern world system&#x27;, but in the very process of being forcibly incorporated into its economic and political structures. They died in the golden age of Liberal Capitalism; indeed many were murdered...by the theological application of the sacred principles of Smith, Bentham, and Mill.&quot;

Davis characterises the Indian famines under the British Raj, such as the Great Bengal famine of 1770 or the Great Famine of 1876-78 which took over 15 million lives as &quot;colonial genocide&quot;. Some scholars, including Niall Ferguson, have disputed this judgement, while others, including Adam Jones, have affirmed it.

==== Champa ====

The Vietnamese Empire adopted repressive measures against the Chams, which some commentators have labeled genocide.

==== Dutch East Indies ====
The Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands was a process of military conquest from 1609 to 1621 by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) of the Banda Islands. Judging that Bandanese resistance to Dutch attempts to establish their commercial supremacy in the archipelago had to be crushed once and for all, the VOC Governor-General Jan Pieterszoon Coen wrote a letter to the &quot;Heeren XVII&quot; on 26 October 1620, stating: &#x27;To adequately deal with this matter, it is necessary to once again subjugate Banda, and populate it with other people.&#x27; As proposed, the &quot;Heeren XVII&quot; instructed him to subjugate the Bandanese and drive their leaders out of the land. This culminated in the Banda massacre, which saw 2,800 Bandanese killed and 1,700 enslaved by the Dutch. Along with starvation and constant fighting, the Bandanese felt they could not continue to resist the Dutch and negotiated a surrender in 1621. Coen expelled the remaining 1,000 Bandanese to Batavia. The conquest saw in total the Bandanese population decrease from aroun 15,000 to around 1,000.

The 1740 Batavia massacre (; , literally the &quot;Murder of the Chinese&quot;; , or the &quot;Chinatown Tumult&quot;) was a pogrom in which Dutch East Indies soldiers and native collaborators killed ethnic Chinese residents of the port city of Batavia (present-day Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies. The violence which occurred in the city lasted from 9 October until 22 October 1740, with minor skirmishes continuing to occur outside the city walls into late November. Historians have estimated that at least 10,000 ethnic Chinese were massacred; just 600 to 3,000 are believed to have survived.

==== Dzungar genocide ====

The Dzungar (or known as Zunghar), Oirat Mongols who lived in an area that stretched from the west end of the Great Wall of China to present-day eastern Kazakhstan and from present-day northern Kyrgyzstan to southern Siberia (most of which is located in present-day Xinjiang), were the last nomadic empire to threaten China, which they did from the early 17th century through the middle of the 18th century. After a series of inconclusive military conflicts that started in the 1680s, the Dzungars were subjugated by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1644–1911) in the late 1750s. According to Qing scholar Wei Yuan, 40 percent of the 600,000 Zunghar people were killed by smallpox, 20 percent fled to Russia or sought refuge among the Kazakh tribes and 30 percent were killed by the Qing army of Manchu Bannermen and Khalkha Mongols.

Mongolist Charles Bawden was the first to describe the Qing treatment of the Dzungar as &quot;genocide&quot; in the 1960s. Political scientist Michael E. Clarke, who specialises in the history of Xinjiang, has argued that the Qing campaign in 1757–58 &quot;amounted to the complete destruction of not only the Zunghar state but of the Zunghars as a people&quot;. Historian Peter Perdue has attributed the decimation of the Dzungars to a &quot;deliberate use of massacre&quot; and has described it as an &quot;ethnic genocide&quot;. Mark Levene, a historian of genocide, has stated that the extermination of the Dzungars was &quot;arguably the eighteenth century genocide par excellence&quot;.

==== Taiping Rebellion ====

The Taiping Rebellion was a massive rebellion which was launched by Hong Xiuquan, an ethnic Hakka (a Han subgroup) and the self-proclaimed younger brother of Jesus, who sought to overthrow the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and replace it with a Chinese Christian theocratic absolute monarchy which he named the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. One of the bloodiest wars in history and the bloodiest civil war in history, the Taiping Rebellion was marked by genocidal atrocities which were perpetrated by both of the sides which fought in the conflict.

In every area which they captured, the Taiping immediately exterminated the entire Manchu population. In the province of Hunan one Qing loyalist who observed the genocidal massacres which the Taiping forces committed against the Manchus wrote that the &quot;pitiful Manchus&quot;, the Manchu men, women and children were executed by the Taiping forces. The Taiping rebels were seen chanting while slaughtering the Manchus in Hefei. After capturing Nanjing, Taiping forces killed about 40,000 Manchu civilians. On 27 October 1853, they crossed the Yellow River in T&#x27;sang-chou and murdered 10,000 Manchus.

Since the rebellion began in Guangxi, Qing forces allowed no rebels who spoke its dialect to surrender. Reportedly in the province of Guangdong, it is written that 1,000,000 were executed because after the collapse of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Qing dynasty launched waves of massacres against the Hakkas, that at their height killed up to 30,000 each day. These policies of mass murder of civilians occurred elsewhere in China, including Anhui, and Nanjing. This resulted in a massive civilian flight and death toll with some 600 towns destroyed and other bloody policies resulting.

==== Japanese colonisation of Hokkaido ====

The Ainu are an indigenous people in Japan (Hokkaidō). In a 2009 news story, &quot;Japan Today&quot; reported, &quot;Many Ainu were forced to work, essentially as slaves, for Wajin (ethnic Japanese), resulting in the breakup of families and the introduction of smallpox, measles, cholera and tuberculosis into their communities. In 1869, after the Battle of Hakodate during the Boshin War, the new Meiji government renamed the Republic of Ezo Hokkaido, whose boundaries were formed by former members of the Tokugawa shogunate, and together with lands where the Ainu lived, they were unilaterally incorporated into Japan. It banned the Ainu language, took Ainu lands away, and prohibited the Ainu from engaging in salmon fishing and deer hunting.&quot; Roy Thomas wrote: &quot;Ill treatment of native peoples is common to all colonial powers, and, at its worst, leads to genocide. Japan&#x27;s native people, the Ainu, have, however, been the object of a particularly cruel hoax, because the Japanese have refused to accept them officially as a separate minority people.&quot; In 2004, the small Ainu community which lives in Russia wrote a letter to Vladimir Putin, urging him to recognise Japanese mistreatment of the Ainu people as a genocide, something which Putin declined to do.

==== Jindandao incident ====

The Jindandao incident was a rebellion by a Han Chinese secret society called Jindandao (), which rose in revolt in Inner Mongolia in November 1891 and genocidally massacred 150,000–500,000 Mongols before it was suppressed by government troops in late December.

==== Kashmiri Shias ====

The history of Shi&#x27;ism in Kashmir is marked by conflicts and strife, spanning over half a millennium. Incidents of sectarian violence occurred in Kashmir under the rule of Mirza Haider Dughlat, followed by the Mughals (1586–1752), the Afghans (1752–1819), the Sikhs (1819–1845) and the Dogras (1846–1947). A small Shia community has managed to survive in Kashmir until today.

==== Armenians, Assyrians, Bulgarians, Greeks ====

The Massacres of Badr Khan were committed against the Assyrian Christian population of the Ottoman Empire by Kurdish and Ottoman forces between 1843 and 1847, resulting in the slaughter of more than 10,000 indigenous Assyrian civilians who were inhabitants of the Hakkari region, and many thousands more were sold into slavery.

During the suppression of the April uprising in Bulgaria in May–June 1876, 30,000 Bulgarians died and 5,000 Bulgarians were killed in Batak – according to modern researchers, the Batak massacre was the starting point of genocide in the modern era.

Between 1894 and 1896, a series of ethnically religiously motivated Anti-Christian pogroms which are known as the Hamidian massacres were committed against the ancient Armenian and Assyrian Christian populations by the forces of the Ottoman Empire. The massacres were mainly committed in regions which were located in what is modern-day south eastern Turkey, north eastern Syria and northern Iraq. According to some estimates, as many as 325,000 people were killed, and 546,000 Armenians and Assyrians who survived the massacres were made destitute when they were forcibly deported from cities, and almost 2500 of their farmsteads, towns and villages were either destroyed or stolen. Hundreds of churches and monasteries were either destroyed or forcibly converted into mosques.

The Adana massacre occurred in the Adana Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire in April 1909. A massacre of Armenian and Assyrian Christians in the city of Adana and its surroundings amidst the Ottoman countercoup of 1909 triggered a series of anti-Christian pogroms throughout the province. Reports estimated that the Adana Province massacres resulted in the death of as many as 30,000 Armenians and the death of as many as 1,500 Assyrians.

From 1913 to 1923, the Greek, Assyrian, and Armenian genocides took place in the Ottoman Empire. Some historians consider these genocides a single event and they refer to them as the &quot;late Ottoman genocides&quot;.

==== Philippines ====
===== Spanish colonial era =====

Belinda A. Aquino describes Spanish colonial rule of the Philippines as one of the &quot;most cruel colonial regimes in world history&quot;, characterised by the systematic destruction of native communities and their institutions, while the natives were forced to work on the colonial government&#x27;s projects. She writes that the Spaniards imposed an alien religion, Catholicism, on the population, while the native people&#x27;s sacred indigenous religions and shrines were all destroyed. She describes the Spanish conquest as a genocide, with killings of natives being common. Furthermore, she writes that the Spanish continued to view the natives of the Philippines as &quot;savages&quot; and &quot;pagans who had to be civilised&quot; despite the fact that they perpetrated atrocities.

According to Linda A. Newson&#x27;s research, demographic decline occurred in the Philippines during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, primarily as a result of destructive epidemics which were introduced on the islands during the establishment of the Spanish colonial regime. It was previously assumed that the natives of the Philippines were immune to the diseases which decimated the populations of the New World, but Newson, who used the data which she collected from historical demographic documents, argues that intermittent contact and a low population density prevented the spread of such diseases before the arrival of the Spaniards, thus making them lethal to vulnerable populations. Yet, despite its previous lack of exposure, the diseases which were introduced to the indigenous population of the Philippines were not seen as having an impact which was as great as the impact which they had on the indigenous populations of the New World. Newson also argues that the same factors which kept the diseases at bay before the Spanish conquest also curtailed the spread of the infections during the early years of the Spanish colonial period. Newson also concludes that, for the indigenous population of the Philippines, &quot;the demographic decline which occurred during the seventeenth century was the outcome of a complex interaction of factors which included the Hispano-Dutch War, the restructuring of Filipino communities, and periodic famines, epidemics and Moro raids&quot;.

===== American and Japanese eras =====

Numerous massacres were committed against Filipinos during the American and Japanese occupations of the Philippines, notably, massacres were committed on Samar and Sulu by Americans during the Philippine-American war, and the Manila massacre was committed by Japanese forces during World War 2.

==== Persecution of Yazidis ====

In 1832, about 70,000 Yazidis were killed by the Sunni Kurdish princes Bedir Khan Beg and Muhammad Pasha of Rawanduz. During his research trips in 1843, the Russian traveller and orientalist Ilya Berezin mentioned that 7,000 Yazidis were killed by Kurds of Rawandiz on the hills of Nineveh near Mosul, shortly before his arrival. According to many historical reports, the Bedir Khan massacres can be classified as a genocide.

=== Russian Empire ===
==== Congress Poland ====

The Russification of Poland was an intense process, especially under Partitioned Poland, when the Russian state aimed to denationalise Poles via incremental enforcement of language, culture, the arts, the Orthodox religion and Russian practices. The most forceful Russification was forced onto children.

==== Siberia ====
==== Circassians ====
The Russian Tsarist Empire waged war against Circassia in the Northwest Caucasus for more than one hundred years, trying to secure its hold on Circassia&#x27;s Black Sea coast. After a century of insurgency and war and failure to end the conflict, the Russian military executed the systematic mass murder, ethnic cleansing, forced migration, and expulsion of 800,000–1,500,000 Circassians. The Georgian government has officially recognised the events as a genocide, as have Circassian advocacy organisations, a stance also held by a plethora of scholars of genocide and other historians, with Oliver Bullough crediting the Russian Empire with &quot;the first modern genocide on European soil&quot;, 
and Anssi Kullberg arguing that the Russian state thus invented &quot;the strategy of modern ethnic cleansing and genocide&quot;. Antero Leitzinger flagged the affair the 19th century&#x27;s largest genocide.

Calculations including those which take the Russian government&#x27;s own archival figures into account have estimated a loss of 80%–97% of the Circassian nation in the process.

In May 1994, the then Russian President Boris Yeltsin admitted that resistance to the tsarist forces was legitimate, but he did not recognise &quot;the guilt of the tsarist government for the genocide&quot;. On 5 July 2005, the Circassian Congress, an organisation that unites representatives of the various Circassian peoples in the Russian Federation, called on Moscow to acknowledge and apologise for the genocide. There is concern by the Russian government that acknowledging the events as genocide would entail possible claims of financial compensation in addition to efforts toward repatriating diaspora Circassians back to Circassia. A presidential commission in Russia has been set up &quot;to counter the attempts to falsify history to the detriment of Russia&quot;.

=== Europe ===
==== Anti-Romani sentiment (Attempted extirpations of Romani) ====
There have been several attempts to extirpate the Romani (Gypsies) throughout the history of Europe:

In 1545, the Diet of Augsburg declared that &quot;whosoever kills a Gypsy (Romani), will be guilty of no murder&quot;. The subsequent massive killing spree which took place across the empire later prompted the government to step in to &quot;forbid the drowning of Romani women and children&quot;.

In England, the Egyptians Act 1530 banned Romani from entering the country and it also required those Romani who were already living in the country to leave it within 16 days. Failure to do so could result in the confiscation of their property, their imprisonment and deportation. The act was amended with the Egyptians Act 1554, which directed that they abandon their &quot;naughty, idle and ungodly life and company&quot; and adopt a settled lifestyle. For those Romani who failed to adhere to a sedentary existence, the Privy council interpreted the act in a way that permitted the execution of non-complying Romani &quot;as a warning to others&quot;.

In 1710, Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor, issued an edict against the Romani, ordering &quot;that all adult males were to be hanged without trial, whereas women and young males were to be flogged and banished forever.&quot; Additionally, in the kingdom of Bohemia, the right ears of Romani men were to be cut off; in the March of Moravia, their left ears were to be cut off. In other parts of Austria, they would be branded on the back with a branding iron, representing the gallows. These mutilations enabled the authorities to identify the individuals as Romani on their second arrest. The edict encouraged local officials to hunt down Romani in their areas by levying a fine of 100 Reichsthaler on those who failed to do so. Anyone who helped Romani was to be punished by doing forced labor for half a year. The result was mass killings of Romani across the Holy Roman empire. In 1721, Charles VI amended the decree to include the execution of adult female Romani, while children were &quot;to be put in hospitals for education&quot;.

In 1749 the Great Gypsy Round-up (), also known as the &quot;general imprisonment of the Gypsies&quot; (), occurred where most of the Roma in the region were arrested, and 12,000 Romani people were killed. Although a majority were released after a few months, many others spent several years imprisoned and subject to forced labor. The raid was approved by the King Ferdinand VI of Spain, and organised by the Marquis of Ensenada, and set in motion simultaneously across Spain on 30 July 1749.

In 1774, Maria Theresa of Austria issued an edict which forbade marriages between Romani. When a Romani woman married a non-Romani man, she had to produce proof of &quot;industrious household service and familiarity with Catholic tenets&quot;, a male Rom &quot;had to prove his ability to support a wife and children&quot;, and &quot;Gypsy children over the age of five were to be taken away and brought up in non-Romani families.&quot;

==== France ====

===== Persecution of Huguenots =====
The St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre () in 1572 was a targeted group of assassinations and a wave of Catholic mob violence, directed against the Huguenots (French Calvinist Protestants) during the French Wars of Religion. Traditionally believed to have been instigated by Queen Catherine de&#x27; Medici, the mother of King Charles IX, the massacre started a few days after the marriage of the king&#x27;s sister Margaret to the Protestant Henry of Navarre (the future Henry IV of France) on 18 August. Many of the wealthiest and most prominent Huguenots had gathered in largely Catholic Paris to attend the wedding.

The massacre began in the night of 23–24 August 1572, the eve of the feast of Bartholomew the Apostle, two days after the attempted assassination of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, the military and political leader of the Huguenots. King Charles IX ordered the killing of a group of Huguenot leaders, including Coligny, and the slaughter spread throughout Paris. Lasting several weeks in all, the massacre expanded outward to the countryside and other urban centres. Modern estimates for the number of dead across France vary widely, from 6,000 to 30,000.

The massacre marked a turning point in the French Wars of Religion. The Huguenot political movement was crippled by the loss of many of its prominent aristocratic leaders, and many rank-and-file members subsequently converted. Those who remained became increasingly radicalised. Though by no means unique, the blood-letting &quot;was the worst of the century&#x27;s religious massacres&quot;. Throughout Europe, it &quot;printed on Protestant minds the indelible conviction that Catholicism was a bloody and treacherous religion&quot;.

===== Vendee =====
In 1986, Reynald Secher argued that the actions of the French republican government during the revolt in the Vendée (1793–1796), a popular mostly Catholic uprising against the anti-clerical Republican government during the French Revolution, was the first modern genocide. Secher&#x27;s claims caused a minor uproar in France and mainstream authorities rejected Secher&#x27;s claims.
Timothy Tackett countered that &quot;the Vendée was a tragic civil war with endless horrors committed by both sides—initiated, in fact, by the rebels themselves. The Vendeans were no more blameless than were the republicans. The use of the word genocide is wholly inaccurate and inappropriate.&quot; Historians Frank Chalk and Kurt Jonassohn consider the Vendée a case of genocide, while historian Peter McPhee highlights that using Chalk and Jonassohn&#x27;s definition the Vendée does not fit a case of &quot;one-sided mass killing&quot;. Historian Pierre Chaunu called the Vendée the first ideological genocide, linking it to later examples of totalitarian mass killings. Adam Jones estimates that 150,000 Vendeans died in what he also considers a genocide.

==== Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ====

The Khmelnytsky uprising (; ; ; ; also known as the Cossack-Polish War, the Chmielnicki Uprising, or the Khmelnytsky insurrection) was a Cossack rebellion within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1648 to 1657, which led to the creation of a Cossack Hetmanate in Ukrainian lands. Under the command of Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the Zaporozhian Cossacks, allied with the Crimean Tatars and local peasantry, fought against the armies and paramilitary forces of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The insurgency was accompanied by mass atrocities committed by Cossacks against the civilian population, especially against the Roman Catholic clergy and the Jews. In Jewish history, the Uprising is known for the concomitant outrages against the Jews who, in their capacity as leaseholders (&quot;arendators&quot;), were seen by the peasants as their immediate oppressors.

Most of the Jewish communities which existed in the rebellious Hetmanate were devastated by the uprising and the ensuing massacres, though occasionally a Jewish population was spared, notably after the capture of the town of Brody (the population of which was 70% Jewish). According to the book which is titled &quot;History of the Rus&quot;, Khmelnytsky&#x27;s rationale for sparing the Jews of Brody was largely mercantile because Brody was a major trading center and as a result, the Jews who lived there were judged to be useful &quot;for turnovers and profits&quot; and based on this assumption, they were only required to pay &quot;moderate indemnities&quot; in kind.

Although many modern sources still give estimates of Jews killed in the uprising at 100,000 or more, others put the numbers killed at between 40,000 and 100,000, and recent academic studies have argued fatalities were even lower.

A 2003 study by Israeli demographer Shaul Stampfer of Hebrew University dedicated solely to the issue of Jewish casualties in the uprising concludes that 18,000–20,000 Jews were killed of a total population of 40,000. Paul Robert Magocsi states that Jewish chroniclers of the 17th century &quot;provide invariably inflated figures with respect to the loss of life among the Jewish population of Ukraine. The numbers range from 60,000–80,000 (Nathan Hannover) to 100,000 (Sabbatai Cohen), but that &quot;the Israeli scholars Shmuel Ettinger and Bernard D. Weinryb speak instead of the &#x27;annihilation of tens of thousands of Jewish lives&#x27;, and the Ukrainian-American historian Jarowlaw Pelenski narrows the number of Jewish deaths to between 6,000 and 14,000&quot;. Orest Subtelny concludes:
Between 1648 and 1656, tens of thousands of Jews—given the lack of reliable data, it is impossible to establish more accurate figures—were killed by the rebels, and to this day the Khmelnytsky uprising is considered by Jews to be one of the most traumatic events in their history.

==== Ireland ====
===== Tudor colonisation =====
Ben Kiernan details how genocidal massacres were employed as a strategy in the colonisation of Ireland during the 16th century. The historian David Edwards argues that the Tudor colonisation should not be considered a genocide in line with the popular understanding of genocide, but that the process was a partially exterminatory process.

===== War of the Three Kingdoms =====

Towards the end of the War of the Three Kingdoms (1639–1651), the English Rump Parliament sent the New Model Army to Ireland to subdue the Catholic population of the country and take revenge on it and prevent Royalists loyal to Charles II from using Ireland as a base to threaten England from. The force was initially under the command of Oliver Cromwell and later, it was under the command of other parliamentary generals. The Army sought to secure the country, and it also sought to confiscate the lands of Irish families that had participated in the fighting. This policy became a continuation of the Elizabethan policy which encouraged Protestants to settle in Ireland, because the Protestant New Model army&#x27;s soldiers could be paid with confiscated lands rather than cash.

During the Interregnum (1651–1660), this policy was enhanced with the passage of the Act of Settlement of Ireland in 1652. Its goal was to further the transfer of land from Irish to English hands. The immediate war aims and the longer term policies of the English Parliamentarians resulted in an attempt by the English to transfer the native population to the western fringes to make way for Protestant settlers. during the conquest over 200,000 civilians died due to the destruction of crops, forced displacement, and the mass killing of civilians. The policy of land confiscation and English settlement was reflected in a phrase attributed—without factual foundation—to Cromwell: &quot;To Hell or to Connaught&quot;, and the policy has been described as a genocide by some nationalist historians.

==== British Empire ====
===== Great Irish Famine =====
During the famine, approximately 1 million people died and a million more people emigrated from Ireland, causing the island&#x27;s population to fall by between 20% and 25% and leading to the formation of the Irish diaspora. The proximate cause of the famine was a potato disease which is commonly known as potato blight. Although blight ravaged potato crops throughout Europe during the 1840s, the impact and human cost in Irelandwhere one-third of the population was entirely dependent on the potato for foodwas exacerbated by a host of political, social, and economic factors that remain the subject of historical debate. Contemporary commentators did not believe that the blight was the cause of the mass death, instead, they believed that the mass death was caused by the actions of the British government.

While a small number of historians believe that the Great Famine of Ireland (1845–1852) was a genocide, according to Liam Kennedy, &quot;virtually all historians of Ireland&quot; reject the genocide allegations. Historians Kevin Kenny and Cormac Ó Gráda argue that For a mass-death atrocity to be defined as a genocide, it must include the intentional destruction of a people and that the British government&#x27;s actions do not meet this requirement. Ó Gráda thinks that a case of neglect is easier to sustain than a case of genocide. Historian Donald Akenson, who has written twenty-four books about Ireland, has said the following about the use of the word &#x27;Holocaust&#x27; in relation to Ireland: &quot;When you see it, you know that you are encountering famine-porn. It is inevitably part of a presentation that is historically unbalanced and, like other kinds of pornography, is distinguished by a covert (and sometimes overt) appeal to misanthropy and almost always an incitement to hatred.&quot;
In debates in the United States, law professors Charles E. Rice and Francis Boyle provided statements, concluding that the British government deliberately pursued a race- and ethnicity-based policy aimed at destroying the Irish people and that the policy of mass starvation amounted to genocide per retrospective application of article 2 of the Genocide Convention.

Writing in 2008, historian Robbie Mcveigh highlighted that while discussions around whether the Great Irish Famine was genocidal in nature have a long history, the tools of genocide analysis were never employed to assess such claims. Scholars highlight the similarity of British policies around and in response to the Irish famine and other cases of famine and starvation in the British empire and colonial regimes, with Mcveigh stating in the other cases they &quot;appear not as horrendous imperial incompetence but rather a deliberate administrative policy of genocide&quot;, and calls for more rigorous investigation of the history of Ireland in genocide studies. There have been later genocide scholars who support the description of the famine as a genocide. Nat Hill, director of research at Genocide Watch, has stated that &quot;While the potato famine may not fit perfectly into the legal and political definitions of &#x27;genocide&#x27;, it should be given equal consideration in history as an egregious crime against humanity&quot;.

==== Balkan Wars ====

The Ottoman Muslim genocide during the Balkan Wars refers to the expulsion and systematic extermination of Ottoman Muslim civilians which was committed by members of the Balkan League from 1912 to 1913, during the Balkan Wars. In 1912, the Kingdom of Serbia, Kingdom of Greece, Tsardom of Bulgaria and the Kingdom of Montenegro declared war on the Ottomans. The Ottomans quickly lost territory. According to Geert-Hinrich Ahrens, &quot;the invading armies and Christian insurgents committed a wide range of atrocities upon the Muslim population.&quot; In Kosovo, Albania, and parts of Macedonia, most of the victims were Albanians while in other areas the victims were mostly Turks and Pomaks. A large number of Pomaks in the Rhodopes were forcibly converted to Orthodoxy but later allowed to reconvert, which most of them did. Jews were also targeted in the ensuing violence.

During these wars, hundreds of thousands of Turks and Pomaks fled from their villages and became refugees. The total number of refugees is estimated to be between 400,000 and 813,000. The number of Ottoman civilians who were killed is estimated to range from 732,000 to 1,500,000.

==== Massacres of Albanians in Yugoslavia ====
The massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars were perpetrated on several occasions by the Serbian and Montenegrin armies and paramilitaries during the conflicts that occurred in the region between 1912 and 1913. During the 1912–13 First Balkan War, Serbia and Montenegro committed a number of war crimes against the Albanian population after expelling Ottoman Empire forces from present-day Albania, Kosovo, and North Macedonia, which were reported by the European, American and Serbian opposition press. Most of the crimes occurred between October 1912 and the summer of 1913. The goal of the forced expulsions and massacres was statistical manipulation before the London Ambassadors Conference to determine the new Balkan borders. 10% of the population of present-day Kosovo (estimated to be 500,000) were victimised, with between 120,000 and 270,000 Albanians being killed.

=== Oceania ===

==== Australia ====

According to one report published in 2009, in 1789 the British deliberately spread smallpox from the First Fleet to counter overwhelming native tribes near Sydney in New South Wales. In his book &quot;An Indelible Stain&quot;, Henry Reynolds described this act as genocide. However the majority of scholars disagree that the initial smallpox was the result of deliberate biological warfare and have suggested other causes.

The Queensland Aboriginal genocide refers to the Queensland frontier that represented the single bloodiest colonial frontier in Australia. Thus the records of Queensland document the most frequent reports of shootings and massacres of indigenous people, the three deadliest massacres on white settlers, the most disreputable frontier police force, and the highest number of white victims to frontier violence on record in any Australian colony. Thus some sources have characterised these events as a Queensland Aboriginal genocide.

The Black War was a period of conflict between British colonists and aboriginal Tasmanians in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania) in the early 19th century. The conflict, in combination with introduced diseases and other factors, had such devastating impacts on the aboriginal Tasmanian population that it was reported that they had been exterminated. Historian Geoffrey Blainey wrote that by 1830, &quot;Disease had killed most of them but warfare and private violence had also been devastating.&quot; Smallpox was the principal cause of aboriginal deaths in the 19th century.

Lemkin and most other comparative genocide scholars present the extinction of the Tasmanian aborigines as a textbook example of a genocide, while the majority of Australian experts are more circumspect. Detailed studies of the events surrounding the extinction have raised questions about some of the details and interpretations in earlier histories. Curthoys concluded, &quot;It is time for a more robust exchange between genocide and Tasmanian historical scholarship if we are to understand better what did happen in Tasmania.&quot;

On the Australian continent during the colonial period (1788–1901), the population of 500,000–750,000 aboriginal Australians was reduced to fewer than 50,000. Most were devastated by the introduction of alien diseases after contact with Europeans, while perhaps 20,000 were killed by massacres and fighting with colonists.

Sir Ronald Wilson, a former president of Australia&#x27;s Human Rights Commission, stated that Australia&#x27;s program in which 20,000–25,000 Aboriginal children were forcibly separated from their natural families, known as the stolen generations, was genocide. He argued, using statements of intent by the architects of the program, that it was intended to cause the Aboriginal people to die out. The program ran from 1900 to 1969. The nature and extent of the removals have been disputed within Australia, with opponents questioning the findings contained in the Commission report and asserting that the size of the Stolen Generation had been exaggerated. The intent and effects of the government policy were also disputed.

==== New Zealand ====
In the early 19th century, Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama (local Māori tribes) massacred the Moriori people. The Moriori were the indigenous people of the Chatham Islands (&quot;Rekohu&quot; in Moriori, &quot;Wharekauri&quot; in Māori), east of the New Zealand archipelago in the Pacific Ocean. These people lived by a code of non-violence and passive resistance (see Nunuku-whenua), which led to their near-extinction at the hands of Taranaki Māori invaders in the 1830s.

In 1835, some Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama from the Taranaki region of North Island invaded the Chathams. On 19 November 1835, the &quot;Rodney&quot;, a European ship hired by the Māori, arrived carrying 500 Māori armed with guns, clubs, and axes, followed by another ship with 400 more warriors on 5 December 1835. They proceeded to enslave some Moriori and kill and cannibalise others. &quot;Parties of warriors armed with muskets, clubs and tomahawks, led by their chiefs, walked through Moriori tribal territories and settlements without warning, permission or greeting. If the districts were wanted by the invaders, they curtly informed the inhabitants that their land had been taken and the Moriori living there were now vassals.&quot;

A council of Moriori elders was convened at the settlement called Te Awapatiki. Despite knowing of the Māori predilection for killing and eating the conquered, and despite the admonition by some of the elder chiefs that the principle of Nunuku was not appropriate now, two chiefs—Tapata and Torea—declared that &quot;the law of Nunuku was not a strategy for survival, to be varied as conditions changed; it was a moral imperative.&quot; A Moriori survivor recalled: &quot;[The Maori] commenced to kill us like sheep... [We] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed—men, women and children indiscriminately.&quot; A Māori conqueror explained, &quot;We took possession... in accordance with our customs and we caught all the people. Not one escaped...&quot;

After the invasion, Moriori were forbidden to marry Moriori, or to have children with each other. All became slaves of the invaders. Many Moriori women had children by their Maori masters. A small number of Moriori women eventually married either Maori or European men. Some were taken from the Chathams and never returned. Only 101 Moriori out of a population of about 2,000 were left alive by 1862. Although the last Moriori of unmixed ancestry, Tommy Solomon, died in 1933, several thousand mixed-ancestry Moriori are alive today.

<text>Robin Douglas Leach (29 August 1941 – 24 August 2018) was a British-American entertainment reporter and writer from London. After beginning his career as a print journalist, first in Britain and then in the United States, he became best known for hosting the television series &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot; from 1984 to 1995. The show focused on profiling well-known celebrities and their lavish homes, cars and other materialistic details.

==Early life==
Leach was born in London, the son of Violet Victoria (Phillips) and Douglas Thomas Leach, a sales executive. He attended Harrow County School for Boys, 10 miles (16 km) from London, where he edited a school magazine, &quot;The Gayton Times&quot;, at age 14. At age 15 he became a general news reporter for the &quot;Harrow Observer&quot;, and earned £6 a week after graduation.

==Career==

Leach moved on to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; as Britain&#x27;s youngest &quot;Page One&quot; reporter at age 18. In 1963, he emigrated to the United States, though he maintained his English accent throughout his life (which would become a trademark of his when he began working in television years later). He wrote for several American newspapers, including New York &quot;Daily News&quot;, &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, before launching &quot;GO Magazine&quot; in 1967 and then became show business editor of &quot;The Star&quot;.
Leach got his start in television as a regular contributor to &quot;AM Los Angeles&quot;, with Regis Philbin and Sarah Purcell on KABC-TV. Other television work included reporting for &quot;People Tonight&quot;, on CNN and &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; and helping start &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot;, as well as the Food Network. Leach was also a guest at the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s &quot;WrestleMania IV&quot;, where he read the rules for the championship tournament, and then paraded the championship belt before the final match. 

Leach became well-known as host of &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;, a show that profiled the lives of the wealthy, and aired in syndication from 1984 to 1995. He also hosted two &quot;Lifestyles&quot; spinoffs, the syndicated &quot;Runaway with the Rich and Famous&quot;, and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Fame, Fortune and Romance&quot;, along with future &quot;Today Show&quot; host Matt Lauer. He also hosted an exposé documentary of Madonna – &quot;Madonna Exposed&quot; – for the Fox network in March 1993. The documentary was a biography of Madonna, focusing on her career and publicity stunts. Before the documentary aired, he gave Madonna a cell phone number; he said that at any point during the airing Madonna could call Leach and argue any point. 

On 10 February 1995, Leach played himself in a special appearance on the American family sitcom &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; in Season 2, episode 17 entitled &quot;On the Air&quot;. In the episode, he appears to present Eric Matthews with a check for $10 million; however, the delivery is a misunderstanding as it is actually intended for his neighbor, Dorothy Muldoon. Leach hosted &quot;The Surreal Life: Fame Games&quot; on VH1 in 2007. He also served as the public address announcer for the 2010 NASCAR Sprint Cup race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
From 1999, he resided in Las Vegas. He wrote for the &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot; and the daily &quot;VegasDeluxe.com&quot; website from 2008 through June 2016, when he was hired by Sheldon Adelson&#x27;s &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot;.
Leach appeared in the 2006 documentary film &quot;Maxed Out&quot;, which chronicled the rise of the credit card industry in the United States and the concurrent increased personal debt among working-class people. Leach remarked, &quot;Nobody would watch &quot;Lifestyles of the Poor and Unknown&quot;&quot;. The comment was highlighted by a review in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;. Leach also appeared with his wife in an episode of &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot;, in which he swapped wives with Eric Roberts.

Leach appeared in the Vice Channel series &quot;Most Expensivest&quot;, with the rapper 2 Chainz. The episode (#5) aired in late 2017 and was titled &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;. It included a scene with Leach and 2 Chainz eating blinis with caviar and syrup. Leach also narrated parts of the episode.

==Personal life and death==
Robin married Judith Desser in 1968, and they divorced in 1977. He had three sons—Steven, Gregg and Rick.

On 20 November 2017, Leach had a stroke while on vacation in Cabo San Lucas. He had another stroke on 20 August 2018, and died under hospice care in Las Vegas on 24 August, at age 76.

<text>The Jodimars was an American rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band that was formed in the summer of 1955 and remained active until 1958. The band was created by former members of Bill Haley &amp; His Comets who had quit that group in a salary dispute. The name of the group was derived from the first letters of the first names of the founding members: Joey Ambrose (real name Joey d&#x27;Ambrosio) (saxophone), Dick Boccelli (under the name &quot;Dick Richards&quot;) (vocals and drums), and Marshall Lytle (string bass). Other members included Chuck Hess (guitar), Jim Buffington (drums), Bob Simpson (Piano), and Max Daffner (drums).

During the summer of 1955, Lytle, Ambrose and Richards, who were paid on a set salary (as opposed to the other two Comets, pianist Johnny Grande and steel guitar player Billy Williamson, who were considered partners with Haley), requested a pay raise. According to the books &quot;Bill Haley&quot; by John Swenson and &quot;Sound and Glory&quot; by John W. Haley and John von Hoelle, their request was denied by either Haley&#x27;s management or by Haley himself (accounts vary). During that summer, unknown to Haley, the trio recruited a couple of other musicians, and recorded a few demo tapes - including a version of a Haley composition, &quot;Rock-a-Beatin&#x27; Boogie&quot;. This won the group a recording contract with Capitol Records and the group subsequently resigned from the Comets, although according to Swenson they agreed to help train the replacement musicians.

The group&#x27;s first recordings on Capitol came out in late 1955, and the band scored a few minor hits such as &quot;Well Now, Dig This&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s All Rock Together&quot;. In 1956, the Jodimars became one of the first rock and roll acts to take up residence in Las Vegas showrooms. Soon after, they left Capitol and recorded for smaller labels with no success. By 1958, the band had virtually broken up, though Lytle attempted to revive the group with a series of demo recordings later that year, though he was the only member of the core band to actually take part in the recordings (members of Ricky Nelson&#x27;s band worked on the recording session instead) and they sat unreleased until 1994. 

By the 1960s, the Jodimars were only a memory, with Lytle going into real estate, Ambrose becoming a casino pit boss in Las Vegas, and Boccelli/Richards becoming a stage and movie actor. In 1987, the band reunited for a series of concerts in conjunction with a simultaneous reunion of the original members of Bill Haley&#x27;s Comets. In 1989, Johnny Hale brought the original Comets to the UK as part of his Brean Sands Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Weekender. The Jodimars (Joey, Dick and Marshall) were backed by three members of the UK group The Stargazers (Pete Davenport on lead guitar, Chris Gardner on piano, and Ricky Lee Brawn on drums) in a set which included their album in its entirety (12 songs) plus a few other later Jodimars&#x27; numbers, and was followed by a set as &#x27;The Original Comets&#x27;. This remains the only billed appearance by the Jodimars since the 1960s.

Lytle, Ambrose and Richards went on to tour the world as the Comets alongside pianist Johnny Grande and guitarist Franny Beecher, but included Jodimars songs in each show (most notably &quot;Eat Your Heart Out, Annie&quot; and &quot;Well Now Dig This&quot;). Lytle left the Comets in 2009, following the death of Grande in 2006 and Beecher&#x27;s retirement from touring also in 2006 (Beecher died in February 2014), and continued to perform as a solo act until his death in May 2013, though he, Ambrose and Richards reunited in 2012 to accept the Comets&#x27; induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Marshall Lytle died on May 25,2013 at the age of 89, but Ambrose and Richards continued to tour as the Comets. Richards died on July 12, 2019, at the age of 95. Joey Ambrose subsequently retired from touring and died in 2021.

In 1963, the Beatles recorded a version of the Jodimars&#x27; &quot;Clarabella&quot; for the &quot;Pop Go the Beatles&quot; program for BBC Radio, which appeared on the Apple/Parlophone/Capitol album &quot;Live at the BBC&quot; in 1994, while the song &quot;Well Now, Dig This&quot; inspired the name of the British music magazine, &quot;Now Dig This&quot;.

==Discography==

Additional recordings exist from a demo session in 1955 (&quot;Flip, Flop and Fly&quot;, &quot;Rock-A-Beatin&#x27; Boogie&quot; (written by Bill Haley) and &quot;The Big Beat&quot;). All but the latter were released in 1994; &quot;The Big Beat&quot; remains unreleased. In 1958, Lytle recorded &quot;Hip Shakin&#x27; Baby&quot;, &quot;Be My Love Tonight&quot;, &quot;Honey Baby&quot;, and &quot;Bring Along Your Lovin&#x27;&quot; with Ricky Nelson&#x27;s band as The Jodimars (Ambrose and Richards reportedly being unavailable) but these recordings also were not released until 1994. A Jodimars cover version of &quot;Dim, Dim the Lights&quot; (which was also a hit for Haley and the Comets) is also known to exist but has never been released.

Two compilation albums of Jodimars recordings exist: &quot;Well Now Dig This&quot;, first released in 1970 then reissued in 1979, and finally in 1989 as a CD release by the Bulldog Records label (France), and &quot;Let&#x27;s All Rock Together&quot; on the Rockstar Records label (UK) in 1994, which included the first release of the 1955 and 1958 demo recordings.

<doc id="1000246" wikidata="Q1510817" url="?curid=1000246" title="Assist (basketball)">
<text>In basketball, an assist is attributed to a player who passes the ball to a teammate in a way that leads directly to a score by field goal, meaning that they were &quot;assisting&quot; in the basket. An assist is also credited when a basket is awarded due to defensive goaltending.

There is some judgment involved in deciding whether a passer should be credited with an assist. An assist can be scored for the passer even if the player who receives the pass makes a basket after dribbling the ball for a short distance. However, the original definition of an assist did not include such situations, so the comparison of assist statistics across eras is a complex matter.

Only the pass directly before the score may be counted as an assist, so no more than one assist can be recorded per field goal (unlike in other sports, such as ice hockey). A pass that leads to a shooting foul and scoring by free throws does not count as an assist in the NBA, but does in FIBA play (only one assist is awarded per set of free throws in which at least one free throw is made).

Point guards tend to get the most assists per game (apg), as their role is primarily that of a passer and ballhandler.

Centers tend to get fewer assists, but centers with good floor presence and court vision can dominate a team by assisting. Being inside the key, the center often has the best angles and the best position for &quot;dishes&quot; and other short passes in the scoring area. Current NBA center Nikola Jokić is among the league leaders in assists and play-making. Center Wilt Chamberlain led the NBA in total assists in 1968. A strong center with inside-scoring prowess, such as former NBA center Hakeem Olajuwon, can also be an effective assister because the defense&#x27;s double-teaming tends to open up offense in the form of shooters.

The NBA single-game assist team record is 53, held by the Milwaukee Bucks, on December 26, 1978. The NBA single-game assist individual record is 30, held by Scott Skiles of the Orlando Magic on December 30, 1990.

The NBA record for most career assists is held by John Stockton, with 15,806. Stockton also holds the NBA single season assist per game record with 14.5 during the 1989–1990 regular season. The highest career assist per game average in NBA history is held by Magic Johnson, with 11.2 assists per game.

<text>The Harrisburg Heat were an American professional indoor soccer team based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The team was part of the National Professional Soccer League, which later became the Major Indoor Soccer League, and has been defunct since 2003.

==History==
The Harrisburg Heat were first formed during the 1991–92 season by Dr. Rex Herbert, following the folding of the Hershey Impact, another NPSL team for which Herbert was the team physician. Along with other investors, Herbert produced the fiscal and economic backdrop to support the team.

The Heat went through several seasons when they were among the most financially sound teams in the league. However, their only trip to the league finals was during the 1994–95 season, when the Heat took on the St. Louis Ambush, also now defunct. The Heat were swept in four games, losing 19–9, 18–8, 12–7 and 14–11.

The last few years of the team&#x27;s existence saw declining attendance numbers, partly due to the State Farm Show Complex&#x27;s construction project that restricted parking and also charged a fee for parking. Also, a portion of the team&#x27;s ownership passed from Herbert to Rodney Rumberger, a Harrisburg-area businessman. Many of the team&#x27;s popular players also had retired or signed with other teams. The team ceased operations following the 2002–03 season. Despite several attempts to put together a new ownership group, the Heat did not return the next season.

On May 2, 2012, it was announced that an expansion team named after the Harrisburg Heat will join the Professional Arena Soccer League in the fall, owned by the league. Longtime Heat broadcaster John Wilsbach took over as owner of the team from 2013 to 2016 and then sold it to Carl Delmont. The team is currently a member of the Major Arena Soccer League, a rebranding of the PASL.

The original Heat&#x27;s home arena was in the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex &amp; Expo Center.

<doc id="1000252" wikidata="Q5330982" url="?curid=1000252" title="Eastward Hoe">
<text>Eastward Hoe or Eastward Ho! is an early Jacobean-era stage play written by George Chapman, Ben Jonson and John Marston. The play was first performed at the Blackfriars Theatre by a company of boy actors known as the Children of the Queen&#x27;s Revels in early August 1605, and it was printed in September the same year.

&quot;Eastward Ho!&quot; is a citizen or city comedy about Touchstone, a London goldsmith, and his two apprentices, Quicksilver and Golding. The play is highly satirical about social customs in early modern London, and its anti-Scottish satire resulted in a notorious scandal in which King James was offended and the play&#x27;s authors were imprisoned. &quot;Eastward Ho!&quot; also references, even parodies, popular plays performed by adult companies such as &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Tamburlaine&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The play&#x27;s title alludes to &quot;Westward Ho!&quot; by Thomas Dekker and John Webster who also wrote &quot;Northward Ho!&quot; in response that year.

== Synopsis ==

=== Act 1 ===
William Touchstone, a London goldsmith, chastises his apprentice Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Quicksilver for his laziness and prodigality. Concerned with his reputation, he tells Quicksilver to consider his actions with the catchphrase, &quot;Work upon that now!&quot; (1.1.10-1). Touchstone also warns Quicksilver against dishonest business and bad company, but Quicksilver remains dismissive and defensive about his way of life. Contrastingly, Touchstone&#x27;s second apprentice, Golding, is industrious and temperate. Touchstone expresses his great admiration for Golding&#x27;s uprightness and hopes that Golding will marry Mildred, his mild and modest daughter.

Touchstone&#x27;s second daughter, Gertrude, is engaged to the fraudulent Sir Petronel Flash, a knight who possesses a title but is bankrupt. Unlike her sister, Gertrude is vain and lascivious, preoccupied with opulent fashion and advancing her social status by marrying Petronel. After reluctantly granting Gertude&#x27;s inheritance, Touchstone heartily gives Golding permission to marry Mildred. Anticipating a successful match, Touchstone praises the engaged couple for their virtues.

=== Act 2 ===
The morning after Gertude and Petronel&#x27;s costly wedding, Touchstone breaks Quicksilver&#x27;s apprenticeship and dismisses him for his shameful gluttony and drunkenness. Unperturbed, Quicksilver mocks Touchstone and asserts that he will spend his new freedom going &quot;eastward ho!” (2.1.100-2). Touchstone promotes his new son-in-law, Golding, to a member of the guild.

Quicksilver meets with Security, an old usurer and pander who is married to a young woman named Winifred. Quicksilver devises how he will climb the social ladder and get wealthy without inconvenience or labor. Petronel arrives and expresses his desire to leave London, especially since he cannot tolerate Gertrude or her expensive tastes. He confesses that &quot;all the castles I have are built with air&quot; (2.3.7). Quicksilver persuades Petronel to use Gertrude&#x27;s dowry to fund their voyage to Virginia.

=== Act 3 ===
Touchstone arrives with Golding and Mildred who are now married. Gertrude pretentiously flaunts her higher rank and disdains her family&#x27;s lower social status. Once Gertrude unsuspectingly signs away her dowry, Petronel makes hasty preparations to sail to Virginia. Before their departure, Quicksilver and Petronel tell old Security to distract the lawyer Mr. Bramble so they can secretly take Bramble&#x27;s wife on the voyage. Instead, Quicksilver disguises Winifred and brings her on the ship, fooling Security. Accompanied by Captain Seagull, Petronel and his fellow adventurers set sail for Virginia. They revel in the promise of abundant gold in Virginia and spend the night drinking while Petronel and Quicksilver conceal Winifred&#x27;s identity from Bramble and Security. Their drunken dancing ends, however, when a storm hits their ship.

=== Act 4 ===
In the confusion of the storm, Security sees Winifred escape with Petronel in a lifeboat, suspecting that she has cheated on him. Separated from Quicksilver and Petronel, Security washes ashore on Cuckold&#x27;s Haven where he stays in a nearby tavern. Winifred also arrives at the tavern along with Drawer, one of the voyagers.

Shipwrecked and disoriented, Quicksilver and Petronel lament their unfortunate condition. Two passing gentlemen tell them they have arrived on the Isle of Dogs, a northern peninsula in the Thames. Quicksilver tells Petronel and Captain Seagull that he will use his goldsmithing skills to create counterfeit money. Back in the tavern, Winifred lies to Security to cover up her affair with Petronel.

Nearby in London, Golding has been promoted to Master Deputy Alderman. He reports the shipwrecked voyagers have been arrested at Billingsgate for their crimes. Meanwhile, as a result of Petronel&#x27;s deception, Gertrude sells her opulent clothes and pities her misfortune. Sympathetic towards Gertrude&#x27;s situation, Mistress Touchstone advises her daughter to seek Mildred&#x27;s help.

=== Act 5 ===
Brought before Golding and Touchstone, Petronel and Quicksilver admit their guilt in the charges brought against them, including Petronel&#x27;s dishonest marriage, the dowry deception, and Quicksilver&#x27;s thievery. Touchstone is appalled and refuses to have mercy on the voyagers. Quicksilver sings a song about his repentance of his schemes and dishonesty, whose change in character and denouncement of vice moves Touchstone to amazement. Golding releases the criminals, including Security, who still laments his cuckoldry. Touchstone reinstates Quicksilver as his apprentice and Petronel as his son-in-law, covering the loss of their possessions and wealth. Gertrude reconciles with Petronel and the play ends happily.

== Authorship and publication ==

Scholars have attempted to determine the respective contributions of the three authors but have not reached a full consensus. Earlier scholars attributed act 1 to Marston, acts 2–3 to Chapman, and act 5 to Jonson. More recently, however, scholars have suggested that the play&#x27;s authorship was more collaborative, since numerous passages &quot;Eastward Ho!&quot; evidence more than one author&#x27;s writing style.

In early September 1605, William Aspley and Thomas Thorp entered &quot;Eastward Ho!&quot; into the Stationers&#x27; Register. The title page features all three authors, Chapman, Jonson and Martson; the playing company who premiered the work, the Children of the Queen&#x27;s Revels; and the playhouse, Blackfriars Theatre, where the play was first staged. Later in December 1605 and March 1606, George Eld printed more quartos issued by Aspley to meet the high demands for the play. In total, three more print editions of &quot;Eastward Ho!&quot; were issued within three months of its first publication. The popularity of the play and the looming possibility of censorship may have quickened the publication process. The surviving editions show evidence of deleted lines, missing passages, and altered passages. The censorship may have been issued by the Master of Revels, or his deputy, George Buc, who was also involved in play licensing until 1610. The printed text of 1605 does not represent the full and offensive stage production of that year, though critics have disagreed as to whether the hostile official reaction was provoked more by the stage version or by the text.

== Scandal ==

=== Anti-Scottish satire ===
The following passages in &quot;Eastward Ho!&quot; exemplify the anti-Scottish sentiment that likely offended Scottish-born King James I:

In Act 1, when Sir Petronel&#x27;s knighthood is questioned, Mistress Touchstone says, &quot;Yes, that he is a knight! I know where he had money to pay the gentleman ushers and heralds their fees. Ay, that he is a knight!&quot; (1.2.81–2). Mistress Touchstone attributes Sir Pentronel&#x27;s legitimacy to his purchased title. This line probably satirizes &quot;King James&#x27;s lavish grants of knighthood.&quot; While getting her dress tailored, Gertrude remarks, &quot;Tailor Poldavy, prithee, fit it, fit it: is this a right Scot? Does it clip close, and bear up round?&quot; (1.2.39–40). This remark possibly references the perception that Scots accompanying King James invaded the English Court.

In Act 2, Quicksilver remarks, &quot;[Gertrude] could have been made a lady by a Scotch knight, and never ha&#x27; married him&quot; (2.3.68–9). This line references a practice in Scotland where &quot;notorious cohabitation&quot; is accepted as &quot;matrimonial engagement without formal ceremony.&quot;

In Act 3, Captain Seagull describes Virginia, the new country that is their destination. While explaining the other inhabitants in the new country, Seagull hints that he wishes for all of the King&#x27;s Scotsmen to leave England: &quot;And you shall live freely there ... with only a few industrious Scots, perhaps, who indeed are dispers&#x27;d over the face of the whole earth. But, as for them, there are no greater friends to Englishmen and England, when they are out on&#x27;t, in the world, than they are. And, for my part, I would a hundred thousand of &#x27;em were there, for we are all one countrymen now, ye know; and we should find ten times more comfort of them there than we do here.&quot; (3.3.29–35). These lines particularly angered Sir James Murray and were consequently omitted from the first quarto publication.

In Act 4, when Quicksilver inquires about his whereabouts, he meets the First Gentleman, who has a Scots accent. The First Gentlemen remarks, &quot;I ken [Sir Petronel] well; he is one of my thirty-pound knights&quot; (4.1.140). Like the reference in Act 1, this line mocks King James&#x27;s selling of knighthoods and granting titles to fellow Scots.

=== Imprisonment ===
After the play&#x27;s first performances, Jonson and Chapman were imprisoned for offending King James I with satirical Scottish references. In August 1605, when the play premiered, King James I was travelling to Oxford with courtiers including the Lord Chamberlain &quot;whose permission should have been obtained before the comedy was performed.&quot; Staging boldly satirical plays without licence had been done before by playing companies, but this instance seems to have gone too far and caused a significant scandal. Jonson later recounted to William Drummond of Hawthornden that he &quot;was delated by Sir James Murray to the king for writing something against the Scots in a play, &quot;Eastward Ho&quot;, and voluntary imprisoned himself with Chapman and Marston who had written it amongst them. The report was that they should then had their ears cut and noses.&quot; Marston was absent, and was not imprisoned with Chapman and Jonson. He may have avoided arrest because of his financial investment in the playing company.

=== Release from prison ===
Between late August and early September, Jonson and Chapman wrote urgent letters to friends, petitioning for their intervention. Among the names addressed in their letters were Earl of Suffolk, Lord Aubigny (the King&#x27;s cousin Esmé Stuart), Earl of Pembroke, the Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of Salisbury (Robert Cecil), and even King James himself. Chapman&#x27;s personal correspondences and commendatory poem in the first edition of Jonson&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1605) suggest that the Earl of Suffolk was influential in obtaining their release in November 1605. Additionally, Lord Aubigny may have also smoothed the matter through a large financial transaction from Robert Cecil to Sir James Murray, a Scottish knight and favorite courtier of the King, who had been particularly offended at the play&#x27;s Scottish satire. After his release from prison, Ben Jonson threw a banquet for his friends in celebration.

== Stage history ==
&quot;Eastward Ho!&quot; was banned from the stage until 1614, when it was revived in a court production by the Lady Elizabeth&#x27;s Men. Later, in 1685, Nahum Tate revised &quot;Eastward Ho!&quot; to fit the fashions of Restoration theatre. After David Garrick&#x27;s 1751 production in London and Charlotte Lennox&#x27;s 1775 adaption, the play was infrequently performed through the nineteenth century.

In the twentieth century, the play was produced on radio adaptions and university stages, but remained neglected on professional stages. Only three professional productions between 1951 and 1983 were performed by Bernard Miles&#x27; original Mermaid Theatre.

The Royal Shakespeare Company revived &quot;Eastward Ho!&quot; in a production series which featured four other Jacobean plays in 2002. Directed by Lucy Pitman-Wallace, the play was performed at the Swan Theatre in 2002 with a positive critical reception. The play was also produced in 2006 by the American Shakespeare Center in the Blackfriars Playhouse in Staunton, Virginia.

<text>Morys George Lyndhurst Bruce, 4th Baron Aberdare, (16 June 1919 – 23 January 2005), was a Conservative politician, and from 1999 until his death, one of ninety-two elected hereditary peers in the British House of Lords. He was the eldest son of Clarence Bruce, 3rd Baron Aberdare, and Margaret Bethune Black, and succeeded to his father&#x27;s title on the latter&#x27;s death in 1957.

==Education==
Bruce was educated at Sandroyd School before heading to Winchester College and New College, Oxford, where he read Politics, Philosophy and Economics.

==Career==

In 1939 he joined the British Army, commissioned with the rank of lieutenant in the Welsh Guards; he would eventually reach the rank of captain, after having served in various staff positions with XII Corps, the 21st Army Group, and XXX Corps during and after World War II.

He joined the J. Arthur Rank Organisation in 1947, working there for two years before moving to the British Broadcasting Corporation, where he worked between 1949 and 1956. In 1970, he became Minister of State for the Department of Health and Social Security; in 1974, he was appointed to the Privy Council and became a Minister without Portfolio. Between 1976 and 1992, he served as Chairman of Committees of the House of Lords, (Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords). In 1984, he was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and he would serve various positions within the Order of St John of Jerusalem. After the House of Lords Act 1999 prevented hereditary peers from sitting in the Lords solely by virtue of their peerages, Lord Aberdare became one of the ninety-two hereditary peers elected to stay in the House of Lords.

On 24 August 1992, he officially opened Chester City&#x27;s new football stadium, the Deva Stadium.

Lord Aberdare was a lifelong devotee of real tennis, winning the British amateur singles championship four times between 1953 and 1957, and the amateur doubles championship four times between 1954 and 1961. He served as president of the Tennis and Rackets Association from 1972 until 2004. During his tenure there was a significant expansion in both real tennis and rackets, and a number of new courts were built while several others were re-opened. His book, &quot;The JT Faber Book of Tennis and Rackets&quot; (London: Quiller Press, 2001. ), is the most comprehensive modern reference for these sports.

Lord Aberdare was President of the London Welsh Trust, which runs the London Welsh Centre, from 1959 until 1962, and from 1969 to 1970.

==Family==
In 1946 he married Maud Helen Sarah Dashwood, daughter of Sir John Dashwood, 10th Baronet, and Helen Moira Eaton. They had four children:

* Hon. Alastair John Lyndhurst Bruce (later 5th Baron; b. 2 May 1947)
* Hon. James Henry Morys Bruce (b. 28 December 1948), married and has issue
* Hon. Henry Adam Francis Bruce (b. 5 February 1962), married and has issue
* Hon. Charles Benjamin Bruce (b. 29 May 1965)

<text>Weis Markets, Inc. (, ), doing business as Weis and stylized as weis, is an American food retailer headquartered in Sunbury, Pennsylvania. It currently operates 200 stores with over 23,000 employees in Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, West Virginia, Virginia, and Delaware.

==History==
===20th century===
Weis Markets was founded as Weis Pure Foods in 1912 in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, by two brothers, Harry and Sigmund Weis. Their store has been noted as &quot;revolutionary&quot; since it did not operate on credit; sales were only for cash. At the time, similar stores operated on credit, allowing customers to build a tab that would be paid periodically. Cash sales were a sign of a growing working class earning steady paychecks, and they also helped lower prices by up to 25%.

Three years later, in 1915, a second Weis store opened in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. 

The Weis brothers expanded the chain rapidly, opening dozens of small, in-town grocery stores throughout central Pennsylvania, ultimately peaking at 115 stores in 15 central Pennsylvania counties in 1933. 

As the supermarket industry shifted to larger, self-service stores, Weis adapted the format of its stores. The company closed several corner grocery stores in Harrisburg in 1938, replacing them with their first self-service, consolidated supermarket. In newspaper ads during the 1940s, Weis referred to its stores first as Weis Super Markets, then Weis Self-Service Markets, and finally Weis Markets.

Over the next two decades, the company continued with this strategy, and it had consolidated all of its corner grocery stores into supermarkets, with 35 stores by 1955. 

In the 1950s and 1960s, Weis expanded its reach, first to York and then Lancaster by 1960. Weis expanded to Maryland in July 1967, opening its first non-Pennsylvania store in Hagerstown, followed by a store in Frederick in August Its first store in the Wilkes-Barre area opened in 1967. 

In November 1967, the company purchased the five-store Albany Public Markets chain based in Albany, New York, in an all-cash transaction. It operated Albany Public Markets as a subsidiary, keeping the company&#x27;s management team intact. Weis closed its Albany Public Markets chain in October 1986, leasing the nine stores to Grand Union.

Weis also expanded to Western Pennsylvania, opening stores as far west as Altoona, Everett, and Philipsburg, and expanded throughout Northeastern Pennsylvania. The company purchased two regional chains in the Poconos and Lehigh Valley region: Mr. Z&#x27;s, a 14-store chain of IGA supermarkets, in 1992, and King&#x27;s, a six-store chain based in Hamburg, in 1994. Mr. Z&#x27;s and King&#x27;s were operated under separate banners for years before all stores were re-branded as Weis. The westernmost extent of Weis&#x27;s expansion is along old route 220 with the two stores in Altoona, one on 7th street and one in Park Hills.

Weis&#x27;s expansion into the Baltimore, market was successful, but expansions into the Washington, D.C. market were less successful. Weis opened stores in Northern Virginia before retreating from that market, first closing most of its stores in Montgomery County, Maryland, and finally closing all stores in Virginia.

Weis also expanded into North Jersey, beginning with a store opened in Newton in 1992.

===21st century===

In 2000, another store opened in Flanders; it closed in 2002, two years after its opening. Weis returned to Flanders in 2014, in a former A&amp;P store adjacent to the location of its first Flanders store. 

In 2009, Weis expanded into the Southern Tier of New York with the acquisition of the 11-store Giant Markets chain. Weis closed one former Giant Market in Binghamton in 2012, along with two others in 2014. Eight former Giant Markets continue to operate.

In 2012, eastern expansion continued as Weis acquired three former Genuardi&#x27;s stores from Safeway, in the Philadelphia suburbs of Conshohocken, Doylestown and Norristown, on June 16. A former Superfresh store in Towson, Maryland, opened as a Weis in 2012. Weis entered central New Jersey with the purchase of a former Pathmark store in Hillsborough in August 2013. 

In November 2013, Weis opened its closest store to Philadelphia following its acquisition of a former Pathmark store in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. In July 2015, Weis purchased the location and assets of Nell&#x27;s Shur-fine Market from C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers in Penn Township, York County, Pennsylvania and followed that up in October 2016 with the purchase of a second Nell&#x27;s location in East Berlin, Pennsylvania.

Robert F. Weis, the son of Harry Weis, died in October 2015 at the age of 96. A philanthropist, Weis donated millions of dollars to charities, food banks, and other organizations in Sunbury, the Central Susquehanna Valley, and elsewhere. A strong supporter of Israel, he sponsored a flight of Jewish survivors of the Chernobyl disaster to make aliyah, and served as treasurer of the Sunbury chapter of the United Jewish Appeal. Weis was a member of Sunbury&#x27;s Congregation Beth El and he helped found the Department of Judaic Studies at Yale University.

In May 2016, Weis Markets announced the purchase of five stores from Mars in Baltimore County, Maryland, after that chain announced it was closing all its stores. In July 2016, it was announced that Weis Markets entered into a purchase agreement with Ahold and Delhaize Group for 38 Food Lion locations in Maryland, Delaware,and Virginia as part of the divestiture of stores to gain clearance from the Federal Trade Commission for the impending Ahold/Delhaize merger. The company completed the acquisition and conversion of the stores in early November 2016.
On March 9, 2017, Weis Markets opened a store in Hampden Township, Pennsylvania, that features a pub, ice cream parlor, expanded takeout food selection, a drive-thru pharmacy, and a beer cafe selling 900 varieties of beer and 500 varieties of wine. In late September 2019, Weis acquired two Thomas&#x27; Food Market stores, one in Dallas, Pennsylvania and another in Shavertown, Pennsylvania, reopening the Dallas location under the Weis banner and closing the Shavertown location.

On July 19, 2018 Weis Markets opened a second store in Morris County NJ in the town of Randolph (where a former A&amp;P used to operate before A&amp;P&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2015).

===Legal case===
The Weis supermarket located in Park Hills Plaza along U.S. Route 220 in Altoona, Pennsylvania, was the subject of a key 1960s United States Supreme Court case concerning the &quot;public forum doctrine.&quot; The Court held that a union picket in the supermarket parcel pickup area and parking lot was permissible because the &quot;shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent to the business district&quot; of a city. At the time of the picketing, the Weis store was located in Logan Valley Mall, the Park Hills Plaza was not built until the mid-1970s, at which time Weis moved across U.S. Route 220 to its current location.

===Shooting===

In the early hours on the morning of June 8, 2017, employees at a Weis Markets supermarket in Eaton Township, Pennsylvania, United States, were stocking and closing the store for the night. Shortly before 1:00 a.m., 24-year-old Randy Stair barricaded the exits of the store and proceeded to shoot and kill three of his co-workers before fatally shooting himself.

==Banners==
In addition to the Weis Markets banner, the company once operated supermarkets under the King&#x27;s and Mr. Z&#x27;s banners. Those two banners were centered primarily in the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos, respectively, and were acquired in 1993 (Mr.Z&#x27;s) and 1994 (King&#x27;s). Since their acquisitions, these stores have been remodeled or replaced. In 2009, they were rebranded to the Weis banner, as was its Cressler&#x27;s store in Shippensburg. In 2011, it converted its three Scot&#x27;s Lo-Cost stores, a warehouse store concept, located in Montoursville, Mill Hall, and Coal Township, to the Weis banner.

At one time, the company operated a few stores as Big-Top Market, but as of 2006, no more stores exist under this banner.

Weis Markets owned a majority-stake in, and operated, a chain of pet supply warehouse stores called SuperPetz. The first SuperPetz store opened in 1991 in Dayton, Ohio. Weis Markets acquired an 80% stake in the chain in late 1993. Some stores included grooming services, dog training, and veterinary clinics. While their now-defunct website indicated they had 33 pet stores in eleven states in 2003, their footprint shrunk to only seven stores in June 2011, all of which were in Pennsylvania. None remain today.

<text>James Tennant Baldwin (May 6, 1933 – March 2, 2018), often known as Jay Baldwin or J. Baldwin, was an American industrial designer and writer. Baldwin was a student of Buckminster Fuller; Baldwin&#x27;s work was inspired by Fuller&#x27;s principles and, in the case of some of Baldwin&#x27;s published writings, he popularized and interpreted Fuller&#x27;s ideas and achievements. In his own right, Baldwin was a figure in American designers&#x27; efforts to incorporate solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources. In his career, being a fabricator was as important as being a designer. Baldwin was noted as the inventor of the &quot;Pillow Dome&quot;, a design that combines Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s geodesic dome with panels of inflated ETFE plastic panels.

== Life and work ==
J. Baldwin, born the son of an engineer, once said that, at 18, he heard Buckminster Fuller speak for 14 hours non-stop. This was in 1951 at the University of Michigan, where Baldwin had enrolled to learn automobile design because a friend of his had been killed in a car accident that Baldwin attributed to bad design. He worked with Fuller prior to graduation from U. of M. in 1955. During his student years, Baldwin worked (in a unique job sharing role) in an auto factory assembly line. He went on to do graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley.

Baldwin remained a friend of Buckminster Fuller, and reflected that &quot;By example, he encouraged me to think for myself comprehensively, to be disciplined, to work for the good of everyone, and to have a good time doing it.&quot;

As a young designer in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Baldwin designed advanced camping equipment with Bill Moss Associates. In the early 1970s, Baldwin taught at Pacific High School, and later taught simultaneously at San Francisco State College (now called San Francisco State University), San Francisco Art Institute, and the Oakland campus of California College of Arts &amp; Crafts for about six years.

The period 1968-69 found him both a visiting lecturer at Southern Illinois University and the design editor of the innovative &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;. The &quot;Catalog&quot; came out in many editions between 1968 and 1998, and Baldwin continued to edit and write for both the &quot;Catalog&quot; and an offshoot publication, &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot;, later renamed &quot;Whole Earth Review&quot;.

Baldwin was at the center of experimentation with geodesic domes, an unconventional building-design approach – explored by Fuller – that maximizes strength and covered area in relation to materials used. He also dove enthusiastically into the application of renewable energy sources in homes and in food-production facilities, working with Integrated Life Support Systems Laboratories (ILS, in New Mexico) and with Dr. John Todd and the other New Alchemists involved with &quot;The Ark&quot; project. Baldwin&#x27;s initial involvement with solar energy was during that very experimental, ad-lib phase when much was moving from principles or theory into actual development. In the 1970s, at ILS, he was the co-developer of what was touted as the world&#x27;s first building to be heated and otherwise powered by solar and wind power exclusively.

At Prince Edward Island, Baldwin perfected his greenhouse design: successfully maintaining banana trees. He used several water tanks filled with tilapia, as a source of natural fertilizer for his hydroponics system. His greenhouse included a volume of compost for the production of heat, which was recirculated by ceiling fans. All of these are now the staples for the components of modern greenhouse construction design.

Baldwin referred to his own rural home as &quot;a three-dimensional sketchpad&quot;.

During the first Jerry Brown administration, Baldwin worked in the California Office of Appropriate Technology. After the 1970s, Baldwin continued to work as a designer in association with numerous organizations and projects. He organized for himself a mobile design studio and machine workshop (in a van pulling an Airstream trailer), to drive to various projects across America.

With the ears of a wider audience in the 1980s, Baldwin developed an incisive critique of the American automobile industry, which he viewed as over-focused on superficial marketing concerns and farcically under-concerned with real innovation and improvement. He was also a constructive critic of the emerging industries manufacturing &quot;soft technology&quot; equipment, like wind turbines. In the late 1990s, he worked with the Rocky Mountain Institute of Snowmass, Colorado, in the research, design, and development of the ultralight, ultra-efficient &quot;Hypercar&quot; – a prototype by way of which independent designers hoped to show the way for the world&#x27;s auto manufacturers. With conceptual development having begun in 1991, one version of the Hypercar used a small generator to power an electric motor in each wheel.

Given his long-term role as a &quot;technology&quot; editor, it is worth mentioning the scope of Baldwin&#x27;s focus on technology. His interests remained broader than that represented in the shifting media and popular focus of the mid-1980s and later, which inclined to highlight the micro chip and electronic devices based on it. Baldwin continued to point out the value of (and need for &quot;evaluation&quot; of) technologies within a larger perimeter. Certainly shelter and transportation technologies always interested him. So did tools – and whether a device or tool or process was freshly innovative or age-old in concept, if it enabled a person to &quot;do the job&quot; with wood, metal, fiberglass panels, soil, trees, etc, it remained worthy of Baldwin&#x27;s attention. Whereas the personal computer often (though not necessarily) inclines its operator toward imagination, almost in the sense of , Baldwin remained equally interested in , in application. And while he never ceased to be interested in the products of the factory, Baldwin always wanted to empower individuals and small teams of people to accomplish something worthwhile.

 Baldwin, as one of the notable designer-technologists whose cross-disciplinary approaches have opened new territory, was featured in the 1994 documentary film &quot;Ecological Design: Inventing the Future&quot;. The film viewed these designers as &quot;outlaws&quot; whose careers had necessarily developed &quot;outside the box&quot; of their time, &quot;largely unsupported by mainstream industry&quot; and often beyond the pale of mainstream academia, as well.

Baldwin invented a permanent, transparent, insulated geodesic dome – using a framework of aluminum tubing, covered with argon-filled laminated vinyl sheet &quot;pillows&quot; – which he dubbed the &quot;Pillow Dome&quot;, said to have withstood 135-mph winds and thirty inches of snow. The structure weighed just one-half pound per square foot of floor space. For a variety of reasons including durability and toxicity concerns from vinyl chloride vapor emitted by vinyl sheeting, Baldwin later recommended the use of ETFE film; ETFE had further advantages including transparency and ease of keeping the surface clean, but its ultraviolet transparency reduces its suitability for occupied structures. Baldwin intentionally did not patent his invention. The basic approach has since been applied in large-scale applications such as the Eden Project in Cornwall, England.

Baldwin continued to practice design (as exemplified in the unique and aerodynamic &#x27;mobile-room&#x27; Quick-Up camper he put on the market) and to teach design at the college level up until 2016. Between the early 1990s and 2016 he taught at Sonoma State University, San Francisco Institute of Architecture, and at California College of Arts &amp; Crafts.

Baldwin died on March 2, 2018, at the age of 84.

<text>Desmond James Conrad Ackner, Baron Ackner, (18 September 1920 – 21 March 2006) was a British judge and Lord of Appeal in Ordinary.

==Early life==
Ackner was the son of a Jewish dentist, Dr Conrad Ackner, from Vienna, who came to Great Britain before the First World War. He was educated at Highgate School, before studying at Clare College, Cambridge, where he read economics and law, and where he was later an honorary fellow. During the Second World War, he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery, although a twisted foot kept him out of active service and he was transferred to the Admiralty&#x27;s naval law branch.

==Legal and judicial career==
Ackner was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1945, practising mainly commercial law. He became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1961, a bencher of Middle Temple in 1965 and was later treasurer in 1984. He came to public notice acting for victims of thalidomide in the late 1960s in their action for damages against the manufacturer of the drug, Distillers, which was settled before trial, and as counsel for the families of the victims at the public inquiry into the Aberfan disaster in 1967, in which he condemned the &quot;callous indifference, incompetence, ignorance and inertia&quot; in the National Coal Board. Ackner proved to be an inspired choice and he remains a local hero in Aberfan, where a bench in the memorial garden bears a plaque in his memory.

He subsequently appeared in a number of very public libel actions, including acting for John Bloom, &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, Svetlana Alliluyeva (Joseph Stalin&#x27;s daughter) and Lee Kwan Yew (Prime Minister of Singapore) and &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

He was elected to the Bar Council in 1957, was treasurer in 1964, vice-chairman in 1966, and chairman in 1968. He was appointed Recorder of Swindon in 1962, and became an Appellate Judge of Jersey and Guernsey in 1967, serving in both offices until he was appointed a High Court Judge of the Queen&#x27;s Bench in 1971, receiving the customary knighthood. He became a judge of the Commercial Court in 1973, and was promoted to become a Lord Justice of Appeal and was appointed to the Privy Council in 1980. Three years later, in 1983, he became an honorary fellow of Clare College, Cambridge.

On 30 January 1986, he was appointed Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, and was made a life peer as Baron Ackner, of Sutton in the County of West Sussex. He joined in the majority in the House of Lords in 1987 in the 3:2 judgment imposing an injunction to prevent &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspapers publishing extracts from Peter Wright&#x27;s book, &quot;Spycatcher&quot;, saying that failing to impose an injunction would be a &quot;charter for traitors&quot;. He also joined in decisions banning broadcasts by the Provisional Irish Republican Army and Sinn Féin and ruled in the &quot;R v R&quot; case that a man could be convicted of the rape of his wife (overturning a century of judicial precedent).

==Retirement==
He retired as a Law Lord in 1992 but continued to attend the Lords as a crossbencher. He remained active in Bar politics, supporting the traditional division of the legal profession in the UK and opposing the extension of rights of audience to solicitors.

<doc id="1000284" wikidata="Q433627" url="?curid=1000284" title="Jill Whelan">
<text>Jill Whelan (born September 29, 1966) is an American actress. After working in television commercials, she landed her breakthrough role playing Vicki Stubing, the daughter of Captain Stubing, in six of the nine seasons of the American television series &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (1977–1986). She later guest starred on the revival &quot;Love Boat: The Next Wave&quot;. She has had numerous guest roles in TV shows and played Lisa Davis in &quot;Airplane!&quot; In 2015, she was hired as a celebrations ambassador by Princess Cruises.

== Early life ==
Jill Whelan was born in Oakland, California. After auditioning and appearing in a local production of &quot;The King and I&quot; at the age of 8, she sent her school picture to a San Francisco Talent Agency and landed a series of TV commercials.

An M&amp;M commercial got her noticed by producers, and she was cast in &quot;Friends&quot; (1979), which was quickly cancelled. Concurrently, at the age of 11, she was cast as Vicki, daughter of &quot;The Love Boat&#x27;s&quot; Captain Stubing. She initially appeared on the show as a guest star, and later became a series regular.

In 1984, Whelan graduated from the Buckley School in Sherman Oaks, California with a stint at Guildford College in Surrey, England where she studied English Literature before coming back to Los Angeles.

== Career ==
As well as starring in &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, Whelan made numerous guest appearances in TV shows including &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; (twice), &quot;Vegas&quot;, &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Matt Houston&quot; and &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot;. She also made guest appearances on game shows including &quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;Body Language&quot; and &quot;Super Password&quot;. In the 1980 disaster comedy film &quot;Airplane!&quot;, Whelan played the role of Lisa Davis, a heart transplant patient.

In the mid-1980s, in Los Angeles, having returned from England and with &quot;The Love Boat&quot; coming to an end, Whelan moved to New York City and worked as an event producer at Madison Square Garden, where she helped set up acts.

In 1999, Whelan left acting, started working as an investigative producer at the Los Angeles television station KCOP-TV, and later became a radio show host for &quot;Talk Radio 1210 WPHT&quot; in Philadelphia.

On November 25, 2001, Whelan appeared on an episode of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, a trivia game show hosted by Anne Robinson. Whelan competed against other celebrity 1970s TV stars, including Mackenzie Phillips, Nell Carter, Cindy Williams, Joan Van Ark, Erin Moran, Erik Estrada, and Fred &quot;Re-run&quot; Berry. She outlasted the others, winning $57,000 for her charity.

On September 10, 2008, Whelan appeared with several other cast members from the movie &quot;Airplane!&quot; in a reunion segment on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot;. In October 2008, she made her New York City cabaret debut with her one-woman show &quot;Jill Whelan: An Evening in Dry Dock&quot; at the Metropolitan Room. From September to November 2011, Whelan appeared in the British farce &quot;Move Over Mrs. Markham&quot; at Stage West Theatre Restaurant in the Toronto, Ontario area.

Whelan was set to replace Mark Thompson, who retired on August 17, 2012, after 25 years co-hosting &quot;The Mark &amp; Brian Show&quot; on KLOS in Los Angeles, but during Thompson&#x27;s final broadcast, co-host Brian Phelps announced that he, too, was quitting KLOS.

In 2013, Whelan became co-host with Brian Phelps of &quot;The Brian and Jill Show&quot;. The two share a love for improvisational comedy, and have created hundreds of characters together that they have performed on stage during improvisation shows and in sketches on their podcast.

Whelan is mentioned in &quot;Dead Man Sliding&quot;, the tenth episode of the third season of &quot;Sliders&quot;, as an actress who never had relevance in the dimension of the protagonists.

== Personal life ==
During the early 1980s, Whelan served as a national spokeswoman for First Lady Nancy Reagan&#x27;s &quot;Just Say No&quot; anti-drug campaign.

Whelan met her first husband, Brad St. John, as an associate producer for KCOP-TV in Los Angeles, shortly after leaving Madison Square Garden. They married in December 1993. Soon after their wedding, she became pregnant with their first son, Harrison. Whelan divorced St. John in 2001.

Returning to the East Coast, she married her second husband, Michael Chaykowsky, in April 2004. Her second son, Grant, was born in 2006. In 2014, Whelan filed for divorce from Chaykowsky.

In 2015, Whelan was hired by Princess Cruises as a celebrations ambassador.

Whelan married former Denver Broncos quarterback Jeff Knapple in 2017.

<text>Austin Norman Palmer (December 22, 1860 – November 16, 1927) was an American innovator in the field of penmanship whose development and widespread distribution of the Palmer Method of handwriting had a great influence on the handwriting of the American education systems. In the early 20th century, Palmer&#x27;s method of handwriting came on the tail of nearly a half-century of ornamental writing and offered a more simplified, fast, legible, and economic form of writing for the youth and business people of the day.

As a young boy, Palmer worked his way through G. A. Gaskell&#x27;s penmanship school as a janitor and chore boy. After completing his penmanship education he secured a role as a penmanship instructor in Samuel A. Goodyear&#x27;s Business School at Cedar Rapids, Iowa. After some time, Palmer was able to secure an interest in the school upon Mr. Goodyear&#x27;s departure and operate it as his own. solidifying a lifelong association between A. N. Palmer and the city of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 

Palmer&#x27;s most influential textbook, &quot;The Palmer Method of Business Writing&quot;, was published in 1901.

<doc id="1000308" wikidata="Q7271689" url="?curid=1000308" title="QuickChek">
<text>QuickChek is a chain of convenience stores based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey with 153 stores in New Jersey and New York. The first store opened in Dunellen, New Jersey in 1967, and has since then grown into a chain. Several stores include pharmacies, gas stations, and liquor departments.

The size of the stores range from smaller corner-type shops to larger convenience stores. Many stores are located in urban areas, and most are open 24 hours a day. Former stores with pharmacies tended to offer a pharmacy-like selection of health products and aids. Stores have PNC Bank ATMs inside.

Initially, QuickChek stores were mini-supermarkets with mostly grocery items, snack foods, delis, candy, milk, bread, soda, medicated products, some prepackaged meats, and a small produce area. During the 1990s the stores began to offer fuel as well and gradually changed focus on snack foods, drinks, ready to eat foods, and gas stations. Still, QuickChek stores typically offer moderate amounts of basic groceries such as bread, milk, and a few grocery items, frozen dinners, as well as soft drinks, bottled water, ready to eat sandwiches, and a wide selection of snack foods. They also serve coffee, frozen beverages (Quick Freeze), and sandwiches. Some stores also serve milkshakes and frozen cappuccinos. Like most convenience stores, QuickChek sells cigarettes and other tobacco products, along with lottery tickets. Most sell fuel as well, which has become the main draw to these stores.

QuickChek also has its own assortment of baked goods, some of which are baked fresh in-store.

==QuickChek New Jersey Festival of Ballooning==
QuickChek hosts an annual hot-air balloon festival in Readington, New Jersey, which runs the last weekend in July. An outdoor QuickChek is set up with a deli and coffee counter, and during the weekend, visitors are able to attend the various activities that go on through the festival. In 2011, QuickChek&#x27;s Balloon festival featured many artists such as Meat Loaf, Barenaked Ladies, and ABBA.

==References in pop culture==
The New Jersey–based band, The Bouncing Souls, has a song written about a girl who worked in a QuickChek.

Another New Jersey–based band named The Number Twelve Looks Like You mentions QuickChek coffee in their song &quot;The Garden&#x27;s All Nighters&quot; from the album &quot;Worse Than Alone&quot; with the line of lyrics; &quot;Quick Chek coffee is cooling down.&quot;

==Branchburg QuickChek incident==
On January 26, 2010, a clerk at the QuickChek at 1296 Easton Turnpike in Branchburg, New Jersey, called the police about a suspicious man in the store. The clerk said she knew the man &quot;had something on him&quot;, but was uncertain what it was. Officers arrested Lloyd Woodson, and found in his possession and in his motel room a large weapons cache that included illegal weapons and ammunition, a detailed map of Fort Drum, and a red-and-white checked headdress that police said resembled a keffiyeh worn by men from parts of the Middle East. He was charged on multiple state and federal weapons charges. Branchburg Police Chief Brian Fitzgerald later praised QuickChek clerk Linda Yannazzno and employee Michael Murray for their alertness.

==Acquisition by Murphy USA==
Murphy USA, based in El Dorado, Arkansas, announced their purchase of QuickChek on December 14, 2020. The transaction was closed in January 2021. Blake Segal, former SVP of Operations at Caesars Entertainment, was named Head of QuickChek in September 2021.

Leeper commented: &quot;The plot of this book is not like Egan&#x27;s later work, but the wealth of ideas—and many of the same ideas—that characterize his later work is. There is a section on how quantum mechanics restored the concept of free will. The protagonist sends out &quot;viewpoints&quot;–essentially non-material copies of himself–to perform various tasks. The protagonist is (literally) making films in his head, which conjures up a vision of universes within an individual mind, which in turn conjures up the image of layers of universes. (And yes, I mean literally–the protagonist claims to have an actual little film lab in there!)&quot;

<text>Henry Benjamin Whipple (February 15, 1822 – September 16, 1901) was the first Episcopal bishop of Minnesota, who gained a reputation as a humanitarian and an advocate for Native Americans.

==Summary of his life==

Born in Adams, New York, he was raised in the Presbyterian church but became an Episcopalian through the influence of his grandparents and his wife, Cornelia, whom he married in 1842. Whipple attended Oberlin College from 1838 to 1839 and worked in his father&#x27;s business until he was admitted to holy orders in 1848.

After ordination Whipple served parishes in Rome, New York, and Chicago, where he gained a reputation for his service to poor immigrant groups. His Chicago ministry drew him to the attention of the newly formed Episcopal Diocese of Minnesota which elected him its first bishop in 1859. He served until his death in 1901.

Although concerned with establishing his denomination in the new state of Minnesota, Whipple soon began to champion the cause of Native American groups in the state against what he saw as an abusive and corrupt Federal policy towards Native Americans. He is best known for his clemency pleas in favor of a group of Dakota who fought against the United States government in the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862 in the area around New Ulm, Minnesota. On December 26, 1862, the largest mass execution in U.S. history occurred in Mankato during the pause in US military operations. Thirty-eight Dakota were hanged for war crimes in the conflict. A total of 303 were sentenced to be hanged but President Lincoln commuted 265 in the largest mass commutation on record. Lincoln&#x27;s intervention was not popular at the time. Two commemorative statues are located on the site of the hangings (now home to the Blue Earth County Library and Reconciliation Park). He was referred to as &quot;Straight Tongue&quot; by some Dakota because of his honesty in dealing with them.

Whipple is memorialized by the Bishop Whipple Federal Building in Fort Snelling, Minnesota, which houses, among other things, offices for members of Minnesota&#x27;s congressional delegation. His name is also found on a building on the campus of Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, called Bishop Whipple Hall, a building which was originally a prep school built by Episcopalians but which was purchased by Norwegian Lutherans in 1891 as the main building of their newly founded Concordia College.

Shattuck School (now coordinated with St. Mary&#x27;s Hall and St. James School as Shattuck-St. Mary&#x27;s School, formerly The Bishop Whipple Schools: Shattuck, St. Mary&#x27;s, St. James) is a prominent Episcopal boarding preparatory school in Faribault, Minnesota, which grew up around the campus of Seabury Divinity School, which Whipple founded. (The seminary itself merged with Western Theological Seminary in Evanston, Illinois, and the campus of Seabury-Western Theological Seminary was in Evanston until its merger with Bexley Hall, and what is now known as Bexley Seabury Seminary has its campus on the south side of Chicago.) The main boy&#x27;s dormitory at Shattuck is called Whipple Hall. He is buried beneath the altar of the Cathedral of Our Merciful Saviour in Faribault, Minnesota.

==Early life==
Henry Benjamin Whipple was born on February 15, 1822, in Adams, New York. He was educated at a private boarding school in Clinton, New York, and at Jefferson County Institute in Watertown, New York. In 1839, he attended Oberlin Collegiate Institute, but his health failed and his physician recommended an active business life.

==Career==

After several years working for his father, a country merchant, Whipple began studying for the ministry in the Episcopal Church. He was ordained a deacon on August 17, 1849, became rector of Zion Church in Rome, New York, in November 1849, and was ordained priest on July 16, 1850. Whipple served as rector of Zion Church from 1849 to 1857, becoming known both for the size and wealth of his parish and for his work among the poor. In 1857, Whipple helped organize and became the first rector of the Church of the Holy Communion on Chicago&#x27;s South Side, the first free church in the city. He drew his parishioners from &quot;the highways and the hedges&quot; - clerks, laborers, railroad men, travelers, and derelicts - sought converts among the city&#x27;s Swedish population, and regularly officiated in a Chicago prison.

On June 30, 1859, Whipple was elected the first Episcopal bishop of Minnesota, an office he held until his death more than forty years later. He was consecrated bishop on October 13, 1859, the feast day of James, brother of Jesus, at St. James Episcopal Church during the General Convention in Richmond by bishops Jackson Kemper, Leonidas Polk, and William H. DeLancey, with George Burgess delivering the sermon. In December of that year, Whipple made his first visitation of his diocese, including the Ojibwe missions of E. Steele Peake and John Johnson Enmegahbowh. In the spring of 1860 he moved his family to Faribault, establishing it as the see of the diocese.

During his episcopate, Whipple guided the development of the Episcopal Church in Minnesota from a few missionary parishes to a flourishing and prosperous diocese. For many years, especially during the first two decades of his episcopate, he made regular missionary sojourns by wagon or coach through the rural areas of the state, often in mid-winter, preaching in cabins, school houses, stores, saloons, and Native American towns. Until the diocese was financially secure, he pledged himself to personally support several of its missionary clergy and assumed many other financial obligations of the church. He unified a diocese that at the time of his election was divided into two quarreling factions.

In 1860, Whipple incorporated the Bishop Seabury Mission in Faribault, building it upon the foundations laid by James Lloyd Breck and Solon W. Manny, who in 1858 had founded a divinity school and school for boys and girls. With the help of gifts from eastern donors, the mission developed into three separate but closely connected schools: Seabury Divinity School, Shattuck School for boys, and St. Mary&#x27;s Hall for the education of daughters of the clergy. Whipple also helped found the Breck School in Wilder, Minnesota, to educate the children of farmers.

==Advocate for Native Americans==
Whipple was best known outside of Minnesota for his dedication to the welfare of the Native Americans and for his missionary work among Dakota and Ojibwe in Minnesota. He returned from his first visitation of his diocese with a firm commitment to establish Native American missions and reform of the United States American Indian system. Whipple regularly included Native American towns on his visitations, built up the Episcopal mission to the Ojibwe based at the White Earth Reservation, and appealed for support of Native American missions by lectures throughout the United States and in Europe.

In the early years of his episcopate, Whipple&#x27;s espousal of American Indian reform and commitment to Native American missions earned him the enmity of many white settlers who hated Native Americans, and led some of his fellow bishops to look upon him as a fanatic. His attitude was denounced most bitterly after the Dakota War of 1862, when, in appeals to President Lincoln and through the press, Whipple opposed wholesale executions and extermination or deportation of the Dakota. Whipple even criticized his distant cousin and former Minnesota governor, Colonel Henry Sibley in such matters.

==Later episcopate==
Although a high churchman in doctrine, Whipple preached tolerance of all views which fell within the scope of the church&#x27;s basic teachings. Urging that the church&#x27;s task was to &quot;preach Christ crucified&quot; and that sectarian quarrels hindered this mission, Whipple pleaded for unity among all branches of the Episcopal and Anglican communions, and for harmonious relations among members of all Christian denominations. Both in Chicago and in Minnesota, Whipple worked closely with ministers and communicants of the national Swedish church. His interest in the church&#x27;s missionary efforts was reflected in his presidency of the Western Church Building Society (1880–1893), service on several committees and commissions of the General Convention concerned with missionary affairs, and special missions to Cuba and to Puerto Rico.

From the late 1870s until his death, Whipple&#x27;s health compelled him to spend the winter months each year at his winter home in Maitland, Florida, where he held missionary services and in 1880 built the Carpenter Gothic Church of the Good Shepherd on land which he had purchased. The church was consecrated on March 17, 1883, and Whipple conducted regular services there each winter for the rest of his life.
Henry B. Whipple died on September 16, 1901, having survived his coadjutor Mahlon Norris Gilbert.

==Family==

Whipple married Cornelia Wright, daughter of Benjamin and Sarah Wright of Adams, New York in 1842. They had six children. Cornelia Whipple died in 1890 from injuries suffered in a railroad accident. In 1896 Whipple married Evangeline Marrs Simpson, widow of industrialist Michael Hodge Simpson.

His son John Hall Whipple was mysteriously killed in 1878. An anonymous writer confessed to the murder, alleging that he killed the bishop&#x27;s son to avenge a wrong.

Another son, Charles H. Whipple, served as Paymaster-General of the United States Army

State Senator David Wager (1804–1870) was his uncle; and United States Army General Henry Halleck (1815–1872) was his first cousin.

==Honors==
Whipple was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1894.

He was elected as the first President of the Florida Audubon Society (FAS) in 1900, a year before his death.

<doc id="1000334" wikidata="Q719418" url="?curid=1000334" title="Vasily Rozanov">
<text>Vasily Vasilievich Rozanov (; – 5 February 1919) was one of the most controversial Russian writers and important philosophers in the symbolists&#x27; of the pre-revolutionary epoch.

==Views==
Rozanov tried to reconcile Christian teachings with ideas of healthy sex and family life, but as his adversary Nikolai Berdyaev put it, he &quot;set up sex in opposition to the Word&quot;. His interest in these matters, as in matters of religion, brought Rozanov close to Russian Symbolism. Because of references to the phallus in Rozanov&#x27;s writings, Klaus von Beyme called him the Rasputin of the Russian intelligentsia.

Rozanov&#x27;s mature works are personal diaries containing intimate thoughts, impromptu lines, unfinished maxims, vivid aphorisms, reminiscences, and short essays. Those works in which he thus attempted to recreate the intonations of speech form a loosely-connected trilogy, comprising &quot;Solitaria&quot; (1911) and the two volumes of &quot;Fallen Leaves&quot; (1913 and 1915).

Rozanov frequently referred to himself as Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;Underground Man&quot; and proclaimed his right to espouse contrary opinions at the same time. He first attracted attention in the 1890s when he published political sketches in the conservative newspaper &quot;Novoye Vremya&quot; (&quot;New Time&quot;), owned and run by Aleksey Suvorin. Rozanov&#x27;s comments, always paradoxical and sparking controversy, led him into clashes with the Tsarist government and with radicals such as Lenin. For example, Rozanov readily passed from criticism of Russian Orthodoxy, and even of what he saw as the Christian preoccupation with death, to fervent praise of Christian faith, from praise of Judaism to unabashed anti-Semitism and from acceptance of homosexuality as yet another side of human nature to vitriolic accusations that Nikolai Gogol and some other writers had been latent homosexuals. He proclaimed that politics was &quot;obsolete&quot; because &quot;God doesn&#x27;t want politics any more&quot;; constructed an &quot;apocalypse of our times&quot;; and recommended the &quot;healthy instincts&quot; of the Russian people, their longing for authority, and their hostility to modernism.

Rozanov starved to death in a monastery in the hungry years following the revolution. His work was suppressed and largely forgotten in the Soviet Union, but there were some prominent writers, including Maxim Gorky and Venedikt Erofeev, among his admirers, and his ideas are thought to have exercised an influence on Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s approach to the everyday world of existence (быт/&quot;byt&quot;) as utopic. Recently, however, his paradoxical writings have once again become available to Russian readers, and there has been somewhat of a resurgence among readers sympathetic to Rozanov&#x27;s political views. Rozanov is the main source of inspiration for Dmitry Galkovsky&#x27;s philosophical novel &quot;The Infinite Deadlock&quot; (1988), which revises 19th-century Russian history and places Rozanov at the center of Russian philosophical thought. Rozanov remains little known outside Russia, but some western scholars have become increasingly fascinated by his work and his persona.

<text>Evelina, or the History of a Young Lady&#x27;s Entrance into the World is a novel written by English author Frances Burney and first published in 1778. Although published anonymously, its authorship was revealed by the poet George Huddesford in what Burney called a &quot;vile poem&quot;.

In this 3-volume epistolary novel, title character Evelina is the unacknowledged but legitimate daughter of a dissipated English aristocrat, and thus raised in rural seclusion until her 17th year. Through a series of humorous events that take place in London and the resort town of Hotwells, near Bristol, Evelina learns to navigate the complex layers of 18th-century English society and come under the eye of a distinguished nobleman with whom a romantic relationship is formed in the latter part of the novel. This sentimental novel, which has notions of sensibility and early romanticism, satirizes the society in which it is set and is a significant precursor to the work of Jane Austen and Maria Edgeworth, whose novels explore many of the same issues.

==Plot summary==
The novel opens with a distressed letter from Lady Howard to her longtime acquaintance, the Reverend Arthur Villars, in which she reports that Madame (Mme) Duval, the grandmother of Villars&#x27; ward, Evelina Anville, intends to visit England to renew her acquaintance with her granddaughter Evelina. Eighteen years earlier, Mme Duval had broken off her relationship with her daughter Caroline, Evelina&#x27;s mother, but never knew of the birth or even existence of Evelina until Evelina was in her late teens. Upon this discovery, Mme Duval desires to reclaim Evelina and whisk her away to France as her closest blood relation. Reverend Villars fears Mme Duval&#x27;s influence could lead Evelina to a fate similar to that of her mother Caroline, who secretly wedded Sir John Belmont, a libertine, who afterwards denied the marriage. To keep Evelina from Mme Duval, the Reverend lets her visit Howard Grove, Lady Howard&#x27;s home, on an extended holiday. While she is there, the family learns that Lady Howard&#x27;s son-in-law, naval officer Captain Mirvan, is returning to England after a seven-year absence. Desperate to join the Mirvans on their trip to London, Evelina entreats her guardian to let her attend with them, promising that the visit will last only a few weeks. Villars reluctantly consents.

In London, Evelina&#x27;s beauty and ambiguous social status attract unwanted attention and unkind speculation. Ignorant of the conventions and behaviours of 18th-century London society, she makes a series of humiliating (but humorous) &quot;faux pas&quot; that further expose her to social ridicule. She soon earns the attentions of two gentlemen: Lord Orville, a handsome and extremely eligible peer and pattern-card of modest, becoming behaviour; and Sir Clement Willoughby, a baronet with duplicitous intentions. Evelina&#x27;s untimely reunion in London with her grandmother and the Branghtons, her long-unknown extended family, along with the embarrassment their boorish, social-climbing antics cause, soon convince Evelina that Lord Orville is completely out of reach.

The Mirvans finally return to the country, taking Evelina and Mme Duval with them. Spurred by Evelina&#x27;s greedy cousins, Mme Duval concocts a plan to sue Sir John Belmont, Evelina&#x27;s father, and force him to recognize his daughter&#x27;s claim to his estate in court. Reverend Villars is displeased, and they decide against a lawsuit, but Lady Howard still writes to Sir John Belmont, who responds unfavourably. He does not believe it possible for Evelina to be his daughter, as he already has a young lady who is his supposed daughter (who, unbeknownst to him is actually illegitimate), and therefore assumes Mme Duval to be trying to dupe him for his money.

Mme Duval is furious and threatens to rush Evelina back to Paris to pursue the lawsuit. A second compromise sees Evelina return to London with her grandmother, where she is forced to spend time with her ill-bred Branghton cousins and their rowdy friends, but she is distracted by Mr. Macartney, a melancholy and direly-poor Scottish poet. Finding him with a pair of pistols, she supposed him to be considering suicide and bids him to look to his salvation; later he informs her that he has been contemplating not only self-destruction but more-so highway robbery. He is in dreadful financial straits, is engaged in tracing his own obscure parentage, as well as recovering from his mother&#x27;s sudden death and the discovery that his beloved is actually his sister. Evelina charitably gives him her purse. Otherwise, her time with the Branghtons is uniformly mortifying: during her visit to the Marylebone pleasure garden, for instance, she is attacked by a drunken sailor and accosted by several rowdy men before being rescued by prostitutes—and in this humiliating company, she meets Lord Orville again. Sure that he can never respect her now, she is stunned when he seeks her out in London&#x27;s unfashionable section and seems interested in renewing their acquaintance. When an insulting and brash letter supposedly from Lord Orville devastates her and makes her believe she misperceived him, she returns home to Berry Hill and falls ill.

Slowly recuperating from her illness, Evelina agrees to accompany her neighbour, a sarcastically tempered widow named Mrs. Selwyn, to the resort town of Clifton Heights, where she unwillingly attracts the attention of womanizer Lord Merton, on the eve of his marriage to Lord Orville&#x27;s sister, Lady Louisa Larpent. Aware of Lord Orville&#x27;s arrival, Evelina tries to distance herself from him because of his impertinent letter, but his gentle manners work their spell until she is torn between attraction to him and belief in his past duplicity.

The unexpected appearance of Mr. Macartney reveals an unexpected streak of jealousy in the seemingly imperturbable Lord Orville. Convinced that Macartney is a rival for Evelina&#x27;s affections, Lord Orville withdraws. However, Macartney has intended only to repay his financial debt to Evelina.

Lord Orville&#x27;s genuine affection for Evelina and her assurances that she and Macartney are not involved finally win out over Orville&#x27;s jealousy, and he secures a meeting between Evelina and Macartney. It appears that all doubts have been resolved between Lord Orville and Evelina, especially when Mrs. Selwyn informs her that she overheard Lord Orville arguing with Sir Clement Willoughby about the latter&#x27;s inappropriate attentions to Evelina. Lord Orville proposes, much to Evelina&#x27;s delight. However, Evelina is distraught at the continuing gulf between herself and her father and the mystery surrounding his false daughter. Finally, Mrs. Selwyn is able to secure a surprise meeting with Sir John. When he sees Evelina, he is horrified and guilt-stricken because she clearly resembles her mother, Caroline. This means that the other Miss Belmont (the false daughter) is recognized as a fraud. Evelina is able to ease his guilt with her repeated gentle pardons and the delivery of a letter written by her mother on her deathbed in which she forgives Sir John for his behaviour if he will remove her ignominy (by acknowledging their marriage) and acknowledge Evelina as his legitimate daughter.

Mrs Clifton, Berry Hill&#x27;s longtime housekeeper, is able to reveal the second Miss Belmont&#x27;s parentage. She identifies Polly Green, Evelina&#x27;s former wet nurse, mother of a girl 6 weeks older than Evelina, as the perpetrator of the fraud. Polly has been passing her own daughter off as that of Sir John and Caroline for the past 18 years, hoping to secure a better future for her. Ultimately, Lord Orville suggests that the unfortunate girl be named co-heiress with Evelina; kindhearted Evelina is delighted.

Finally, Sir Clement Willoughby writes to Evelina, confessing that he had written the insulting letter (she had already suspected this), hoping to separate Evelina and Lord Orville. In Paris, Mr. Macartney is reunited with the false Miss Belmont, his former beloved: separated by Sir John, at first because Macartney was too poor and lowly to marry his purported daughter, and then because his affair with Macartney&#x27;s mother would have made the sweethearts brother and sister, they are now able to marry because Miss &quot;Belmont&quot;&#x27;s true parentage has been revealed and the two are not related at all. They are married in a joint ceremony alongside Evelina and Lord Orville, who decide to visit Reverend Villars at Berry Hill for their honeymoon trip.

==Characters==
* Miss Evelina Anville, the novel&#x27;s main character, is the daughter of Lady Caroline Belmont (born Caroline Evelyn) and Sir John Belmont. A series of letters convey the story, and she summarizes specific experiences of her life, mainly to her guardian/pseudo-father Reverend Villars. She embodies the desirable traits for women at the time. Although she is called a social &quot;nobody&quot; by the fop Mr. Lovel, other characters have high opinions of her. She is deemed &quot;a very pretty modest-looking girl&quot; by Lord Orville and an &quot;angel&quot; by Sir Clement in the first volume. The novel traces her trials and tribulations and growing confidence in her own abilities and discernment.
* Reverend Arthur Villars is the man who raised Evelina as his own and refers to her as the &quot;child of his heart.&quot; He is her tutor and guardian, as well as Evelina&#x27;s father figure in the novel. Taking in the disgraced Lady Belmont (Caroline), he vowed to be the protector of her child. He is Evelina&#x27;s moral guide and confidant throughout the novel.
* Sir Clement Willoughby is a minor nobleman (baronet). Evelina meets him at the infamous Ridotto during her first visit to London. A steadfast pursuer of Evelina&#x27;s good favour, he courts her very forwardly with flamboyant proclamations and flattering speeches. Evelina dislikes him, only tolerating him because he curries favour with Captain Mirvan and Mrs. Selwyn. He also accompanies Captain Mirvan whenever he assaults, provokes, or teases Madame Duval.
* Lord Orville is a fine gentleman and earl who rescues Evelina on several occasions, including from the advances of Sir Clement. He falls into her good graces simply by conducting himself in a manner befitting his rank and person. He is open, engaging, gentle, attentive, and expressive.
* Captain Mirvan is a retired navy captain who despises foreigners and constantly annoys Madame Duval. Husband of Mrs. Mirvan and father of Maria, he sometimes greatly embarrasses his family (or so Evelina perceives).
* Mrs. Mirvan is a woman who shows much compassion and concern for Evelina. She looks after her during her visits to London and Howard Grove, treating Evelina as her second child.
* Miss Maria Mirvan is a childhood friend of Evelina&#x27;s, her true companion and confidante.
* Mme Duval is Evelina&#x27;s English grandmother, who pretends to be French. She wants to take Evelina to France, away from English influence in general and Rev. Villars in particular. She is stubborn and ignorant; therefore, she is repugnant to Evelina.
* M. Dubois is Madame Duval&#x27;s companion. He speaks only French and some broken English. Evelina bonds with him during her second residence in London because comparisons to her lowly Branghton cousins elevate her opinion of him. Unfortunately, this encourages him to make unwanted advances that infuriate Mme Duval. Captain Mirvan nicknames him &quot;Monseer Slippery&quot; because he once slipped in mud while carrying Mme Duval.
* The Branghtons are Evelina&#x27;s London relations, a mercantile family who own a silversmith&#x27;s shop in High Holborn. Evelina must associate with them on her second visit to London; she grows impatient with their crass behaviour and is embarrassed to be thought of as in their party, especially when she meets Lord Orville in their company. The Misses Branghton are jealous of the attention their own beaux give Evelina; their brother eventually attempts, unsuccessfully, to propose to Evelina through Mme Duval.
* Mr. Macartney is an impoverished Scottish poet who boards with the Branghtons and is the butt of many of their contemptuous jokes. Evelina rescues him during what she perceives to be a suicide attempt; he later revealed he had been unable to decide between that and armed robbery. This desperate action had been brought on by his mother&#x27;s death and the discovery that his beloved was actually his unacknowledged sister. When the young woman&#x27;s actual parentage is revealed, they are able to marry. He is Evelina&#x27;s half-brother as his father is Sir John Belmont.
* Lord Merton first met Evelina at an assembly. He is reintroduced to her later in Bristol as the fiancé of Lord Orville&#x27;s sister. Along with his companion, Mr. Coverly, Lord Merton reveals himself to be a drunken, gambling rake.
* Mr. Lovel is Evelina&#x27;s rejected dance partner from her first assembly. Though he realizes her action of accepting another dance partner (Lord Orville) after refusing him is due to her lack of knowledge about society, he is furious and seizes every opportunity to embarrass her.

<doc id="1000351" wikidata="Q6986480" url="?curid=1000351" title="Need to Know (newsletter)">
<text>Need To Know, also known as NTK, was an email newsletter, published late on Fridays, written by former &quot;Wired&quot; journalist and &quot;Irish Times&quot; columnist Danny O&#x27;Brien and former &quot;Wired&quot; and Future journalist Dave Green. It was devised in 1996 while Green and O&#x27;Brien worked at &quot;Wired&quot;. NTK was published weekly from 1997 until 2004, when it moved to fortnightly publication. From May 2005 until July 2006 it continued on a monthly schedule, though it often ran late; the final newsletter on the website is a &quot;MiniNTK&quot; dated 8 January 2007.

The newsletter billed itself as &quot;&quot;the&quot; weekly tech update for the UK&quot; (later &quot;week^H^H^H^H fortnightly&quot; or &quot;week^H^H^H^H now-monthly&quot;) and presented the highlights of the week&#x27;s happenings in the IT, blogosphere and general internet community, with a focus on UK culture and politics. It also looked at less weighty matters such as confectionery and nudity in films. It took an irreverent tone similar to &quot;The Register&quot;, &quot;Private Eye&quot; and &quot;Viz&quot;.

==Format==
The newsletter is also available on the World Wide Web and has used a fixed-width ASCII text-based layout since its inception. It was sent to subscribers in plain text email. Since 2004, the website has offered readers the ability to use their own style sheet.

Each newsletter comprised (at least some of) the following sections:
* An ASCII art representation of the letters &quot;NTKnow&quot;, along with the strapline and date.
* An ironic or amusing quote of the week, not seen since April 2005, when NTK was weekly.
* HARD NEWS: Important, but not necessarily mainstream, news stories from the IT world during that week. Each story is accompanied by URLs for further reading.
* ANTI-NEWS, later ANTI-MEMES: A collection of &quot;D&#x27;Oh!&quot;s; errors in mainstream news articles such as using the wrong image for a story, typos, inappropriate web adverts, meta-information for editors or page filler that was accidentally published unedited, or even outright nonsense like &quot;&quot;Columbia&quot;: shuttle travelling nearly 18 times the speed of light&quot;. This section was later spun off into a separate site, &quot;D&#x27;Oh! the humanity!&quot; (now defunct). From 2002 onwards, the section also intermittently included themed lists of &quot;google goofs&quot;: Google results for searches using misspellings such as &quot;first aid tit&quot; or &quot;penny farting&quot;.
* EVENT QUEUE: Events to attend that may be of interest to technologically minded people. This included visits to the UK by open source leaders, sci-fi conventions and blogging conferences, as well as talks and seminars by the NTK writers and their friends. The selections were frequently London-centric, attracting criticism from readership living north of Watford Gap, although with O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s move to California, the geographical range of events covered widened; Burning Man usually merited an annual mention.
* TRACKING: Focussed on interesting, useful, or just plain esoteric software. The selection was not limited to any particular platform; software for Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X all features regularly, and occasionally software for the C64 and ZX Spectrum, such as a mini TCP/IP stack, was included if it was particularly interesting or could be mocked in an amusing fashion. The section also sometimes included reviews of web-services like BugMeNot rather than conventional software.
* MEMEPOOL: like Memepool, a collection of the week&#x27;s best Internet memes.
* GEEK MEDIA: short synopses of television programmes or films that are of interest to a geek audience. Films also include BBFC ratings for added irony.
* After the geek media section, there was a schedule of rotating extra items, including &quot;Confectionery Theory&quot; (reviewing new sweets upon their arrival in the UK, later outsourced to snackspot.org.uk), &quot;feebdack&quot; (as a form of letters page; the title referring to a coinage in Rudy Rucker&#x27;s The Hacker and the Ants), &quot;boners&quot; (correction of errors in NTK itself), and an occasional music review section.
* SMALL PRINT: Other than containing the basic meta-information that NTK is a newsletter, published every week, etc., this section always included the motto &quot;THEY STOLE OUR REVOLUTION. NOW WE&#x27;RE STEALING IT BACK&quot; and the phrase &quot;Registered at the Post Office as&quot;, which is usually completed by an oblique reference to another website or publication that has itself referenced NTK, Danny or Dave. For example, it linked to their Wikipedia article in October 2004.

==Significant events==
;February 1998:NTK launched the Falco competition, named after the rock star Falco who died that week. Readers were encouraged to email their predictions of which technology companies would fail (dot-bombs), and NTK would proclaim &quot;FALCO&quot; with the list of accurate tipsters when announcing that companies had actually failed. This practise predated Fucked Company by two years.
;December 1998: NTK launched STAND.org.uk (now defunct), a UK campaign group lobbying for fair UK internet policy.
;February 2000: NTK launched &quot;Kevin Warwick Watch&quot; (now defunct) in reaction to Kevin Warwick&#x27;s sudden popularity in the mainstream press.
;September 2000: NTK launched a &quot;drily ironic t-shirt competition&quot;, where readers can come up with amusing T-shirt designs and NTK can sell the results back to them.
;December 2000: NTK launched &quot;Fax your MP&quot;, now known as WriteToThem. They also launched their own ironic T-shirt sales site &quot;NTKMart&quot; (now defunct) with the first winner of their competition: &quot;I got £80million in venture capital for my .com idea and all I have left is this lousy t-shirt&quot;.
;August 2001: NTK published the now infamous &quot;dancemonkeyboy&quot; video of Steve Ballmer dancing to Gloria Estefan music at a developer conference.
;June 2002: NTK hosted their own conference, X-COM 2002.
;March 2003: NTK launched snackspot.org.uk (now defunct).
;June 2004: NTK hosted another conference, NotCon &#x27;04.
;August 2004: NTK launched dohthehumanity.com (now defunct).
;September 2005: NTK launched the Open Rights Group.

<text>Mark Reeves Bacon (February 29, 1852 – August 20, 1941) was a lawyer and politician from the U.S. state of Michigan.

Bacon was born in Phillipstown, Illinois, and attended the public schools there. He taught school at the Academy in Bolivar, Missouri in 1871. He studied law, was admitted to the bar on July 4, 1876, and commenced practice in Fairfield, Illinois. He was the city attorney of Fairfield and a delegate to several State conventions.

He moved to Orlando, Florida, in 1882 and to Jacksonville, Florida, in 1886 and engaged in the abstract business. He moved to Wyandotte, Michigan, in 1895 and became associated with the Michigan Alkali Company through his marriage to Mary Ford, the granddaughter of founder Jean-Baptiste Ford (and the daughter of Edward Ford, founder of Edward Ford Plate Glass Company, subsequently part of Libbey-Owens Ford Glass and the Pilkington).

Bacon presented credentials as a Republican Member-elect from Michigan&#x27;s 2nd congressional district to the United States House of Representatives for the Sixty-fifth Congress. He served from March 4 until December 13, 1917, when he was succeeded by Democrat Samuel W. Beakes, who successfully contested the election. On April 5, 1917, he was one of the 50 representatives who voted against declaring war on Germany. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1918, retiring to Wyandotte, Michigan.

He died at his winter home in Pasadena, California, aged 89, and is interred at San Gabriel Cemetery, San Gabriel, California.

<text>David Douglas Boaz (; August 29, 1953 – June 7, 2024) was a libertarian author, philosopher and editor. He was a distinguished senior fellow and the executive vice president of the Cato Institute, an American libertarian think tank. Boaz was a prominent advocate for individual liberty, limited government, free markets, and non-interventionist foreign policy.

Boaz authored several works on libertarian philosophy, including &quot;Libertarianism: A Primer&quot; and &quot;The Libertarian Mind: A Manifesto for Freedom&quot;. He was an early proponent of civil liberties, marriage equality, drug policy reform, and school choice, contributing to the mainstream acceptance of these issues in public discourse. Boaz is regarded as a key figure in the development and promotion of modern libertarian thought.

==Background==
Boaz was born on August 29, 1953, in Mayfield, Kentucky. His father was a judge, and one of his uncles, through marriage, was Frank Stubblefield, who served as a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Boaz studied history at Vanderbilt University from 1971 to 1975, and as a young man was involved with the Young Americans for Freedom and the College Republicans.

==Career==
Boaz eventually parted with the conservative movement, and worked on Ed Clark&#x27;s campaigns for governor of California in 1978 and for president in 1980. Around this time, he joined the Cato Institute.

He was the author of &quot;Libertarianism: A Primer&quot;, published in 1997 by the Free Press and described in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as &quot;a well-researched manifesto of libertarian ideas.&quot; He was also the editor of &quot;The Libertarian Reader&quot; and co-editor of the &quot;Cato Handbook for Congress&quot; (2003) and the &quot;Cato Handbook on Policy&quot; (2005). He frequently discussed on national television and radio shows such topics as education choice, the growth of government, the ownership society, his support of drug legalization as a consequence of the individual right to self-determination, a non-interventionist foreign policy, and the rise of libertarianism. Boaz said his views were informed by classical liberalism and opposed to populism. He expressed skepticism of party politics and did not join the Libertarian Party.

His articles were also published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, and &quot;Slate&quot;. He appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;, CNN&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire&quot;, NPR&#x27;s &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; and &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, Fox News Channel, BBC, Voice of America and Radio Free Europe. A graduate of Vanderbilt University, he was once the editor of &quot;The New Guard&quot; magazine and was executive director of the Council for a Competitive Economy prior to joining Cato. In 2022, he retired as executive vice president of Cato and was named a distinguished senior fellow. He continued to write and appear on television until shortly before his death.

==Personal life==
Boaz, who was openly gay, was with his partner, Steve Miller, for over 30 years. He was a teetotaler.

Boaz died from esophageal cancer at his home in Arlington County, Virginia, on June 7, 2024, at the age of 70.

<doc id="1000365" wikidata="Q4889616" url="?curid=1000365" title="Benner v. Oswald">
<text>Benner v. Oswald, 592 F.2d 174 (3d Cir. 1974), was a case about the voting rights of undergraduate students at a public American university.

==Facts==
The board of trustees for the Pennsylvania State University was selected through a process involving several groups aside from the state executive branch (the governor) and the university. The groups included a society of the alumni of the university and local agricultural and industrial societies of Pennsylvania. A group of undergraduate students at the university sued desiring to be involved in the selection process for some of those seats currently selected through the society elections.

==Issue==
The question presented by this case was whether the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires that undergraduate students be allowed to participate in the election of the Penn State Board of Trustees—thereby allowing them to have a voice in the board&#x27;s makeup.

==Holding==
The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the court held, did not require the undergraduate students be allowed to participate in the selection of the board of trustees. The court ruled that the selection process for the board does &quot;serve important governmental objective&quot; and is &quot;substantially related to the achievement of those objectives&quot;. The court decided the election of members of the board of trustees was not equivalent to general elections and the issues addressed in &quot;Kramer v. Union School District&quot; and &quot;Hadley v. Junior College District of Kansas City&quot; were not germane. The court also reviewed whether the selection process was reasonable, and decided that it was, as the university sprang from &quot;a land grant college committed to the teaching of agriculture and the mechanic arts.&quot;

<doc id="1000366" wikidata="Q3521088" url="?curid=1000366" title="The Goon">
<text>The Goon is a comic book series written and drawn by Eric Powell. The series mixes both a comical and violent atmosphere with a supernatural slant, which pit the titular character against undead creatures/zombies, ghosts, ghouls, mutants, skunk-apes with an unnatural hunger for pies, giant squids, mob/gang leaders, extra-dimensional aliens, mad scientists and robots.

==Publication history==
An early prototype of &quot;The Goon&quot; was first published in 1995, in a book called &quot;Best Cellars #1&quot; from Out of the Cellar Comics. This prototype was called &quot;Monster Boy&quot;, and the story was written and illustrated by Eric Powell.

&quot;The Goon&quot; debuted in Avatar Illustrated (June 1998, Avatar Press) in a 1-page Preview, which is the true first cameo appearance of the character. Powell was unhappy with the quality of the Avatar Press comics after just 3 issues, so he stopped handing in new material and waited for his contract to expire. Once that happened, he was unable to find another publisher, so he moved into self-publishing in 2002 with Albatross Exploding Funny Books. These self-published issues caught the eye of Dark Horse Comics, which approached Powell by telling him that they didn&#x27;t know why they passed on the book, and in 2003 publication of &quot;The Goon&quot; moved to Dark Horse.

The book also received a release that would never be reprinted in trade format, &quot;Satan&#x27;s Sodomy Baby&quot;.

After Dark Horse Comics published issue #18, &quot;The Goon&quot; went on hiatus to allow Eric Powell to work on &quot;Chinatown&quot;, a graphic novel exploring the Goon&#x27;s backstory, and which was released as &quot;Chinatown and the Mystery of Mr. Wicker&quot; in 2007. The series returned with issue #19 on July 11, 2007.

A one-shot comic was released titled &quot;Dethklok vs. The Goon&quot; on July 22, 2009. Both Eric Powell and Brendon Small co-wrote the comic.

Another one-shot comic was released titled &quot;When Freaks Collide&quot; in July 2011. It was a collaboration between the &quot;Criminal Macabre&quot; comic series and &quot;The Goon&quot; by Steve Niles, Christopher Mitten, and Eric Powell.

In 2019 Eric Powell&#x27;s Albatross Funnybooks began publishing a new ongoing Goon series.

==Main characters==
==Creatures==
* Zombies: Zombies are the primary servants of the Zombie Priest. Very few seem to be capable of speaking or performing other complex tasks. Raised by necromancy, they are capable of following orders, though only from the Zombie Priest himself. Referred to by Franky and the Goon as &quot;slackjaws&quot;.
* Hobos: Hobos are the cannibal overlords of the dark forested region known as the &quot;Hobo Jungul&quot;. The culture of the Hobo is apparently completely separate from the rest of the world, so far as they have their own language and resemble cavemen more than humans.
* Brunos: An army of deadly robots designed by Dr. Hieronymous Alloy, all inexplicably sharing the name &quot;Bruno&quot;. These drones have a distinctly retro sci-fi aesthetic, and are equipped with weaponry ranging from lasers to boxing gloves.
* Bog Lurks: A race of ogre-like creatures that inhabit the swamps outside of town. Despite their low intelligence, the Bog Lurks&#x27; great strength has opened up many career opportunities for them in the city&#x27;s criminal underworld.
* Hags: Another of the Zombie Priest&#x27;s monstrous servants, hags&#x27; grandmotherly appearance belies their bloodthirsty nature. These creatures do have their tender side, however, as they act as midwives for Mother Corpse&#x27;s demon spawn.
* The Decasters: The ghosts of a perverse inbred family who haunted an old mansion on the outskirts of the city. While the Decasters had driven most intruders to madness and death, the Goon managed to exorcise them with cats&#x27; eyes strung on cinnamon dental floss.
* Skunk Ape: The Skunk Ape is a large, sasquatch-like monster with a hideous odor. The Skunk Ape is driven to homicidal enthusiasm by the scent of pies (especially blueberry).
* Communist Airborne Mollusk Militia: A squadron of immense octopuses who achieve flight via personal zeppelins. While apparently intelligent enough to speak French and operate aircraft, they made the mistake of allying with the Zombie Priest. The Militia was last seen being blown sky high by the Goon and Hellboy.
* Giant Squid: Another cephalopod nuisance for the Goon, the Giant Squid have a tendency to crawl onto land and attack cars along Crestwood Avenue.
* Vampires: A coven of preening, pretentious bloodsuckers who continually find themselves beaten senseless by the Goon. The vampires lurk in one of the city&#x27;s graveyards, discussing fashion and pursuing other vanities. It is later revealed that they are a diluted form of vampires, fairly disgraceful in their current state.
* Rats: Man-eating rodents the size of St. Bernards, these monsters prowl a lonely stretch known as Rat Alley.
* Chug-Heads: The Chug-Heads have replaced zombies as the bulk of the Zombie Priest&#x27;s army. Products of Mother Corpse, they are small, dwarf-like creatures with large, potato-shaped heads. Unlike zombies, they are capable of merging into one another to create a larger, more deadly monster.

==Miscellaneous characters==
* Dwight T. Albatross: Dwight T. Albatross is the irate, often intoxicated friend of Eric Powell who has made many appearances in the comic&#x27;s letter columns. Albatross is never afraid to speak his mind and often keeps the Machiavellian madness of Eric Powell in check. Dwight had been arrested for destroying issues of &quot;The Goon&quot; in retribution for his unjust termination at the hands of Powell.

:Unlike the rest of Powell&#x27;s characters, Dwight is &#x27;played&#x27; by a real person. Photographs of Albatross appeared in &quot;The Goon: Noir&quot;, a miniseries done by various creators while Powell worked on &quot;Chinatown&quot; and other projects. The real Albatross maintains a MySpace page, moderates the message board of &quot;The Goon&quot; at the Dark Horse Comics website, and appears at San Diego Comic-Con.

* The Atomic Rage: &quot;The Greatest Hero of the Golden Age!&quot;, as often advertised in &quot;The Goon&quot; comics. Sporting a fiery hole in the center of his forehead, this classic-style superhero is known for his foul language and his radioactive (and incredibly angry) brain.
* Margaret Snodgrass: A Southern Bible-thumper who aided in the delay of the issue #18&#x27;s original story, &quot;Satan&#x27;s Sodomy Baby&quot;. At the 2006 Comic Con, Powell&#x27;s booth carried fan-made buttons declaring &quot;Screw Snodgrass! Demand Satan&#x27;s Sodomy Baby!&quot; which were given out as a gift to fans of &quot;The Goon&quot;.

==The &quot;Satan&#x27;s Sodomy Baby&quot; &quot;controversy&quot;==
Eric Powell revealed on July 5, 2006, in the introduction to &quot;The Goon&quot; issue #18, that the issue was originally going to be &quot;Satan&#x27;s Sodomy Baby&quot;. That story was allegedly held back due to complaints of a woman called &#x27;Margaret Snodgrass&#x27;, a fictitious person created by Powell to generate buzz about this &#x27;controversial&#x27; issue. Powell wrote that &quot;for various reasons I&#x27;ve decided to hold off on putting that story out&quot;. He states that the story is incredibly graphic and he had considered placing a label reading &quot;NOT FOR MINORS&quot; on it. He wrote that Dark Horse, while supporting both him and the issue completely, feared public backlash from its publication, but would eventually put out the issue. Word of the comic&#x27;s release was allegedly leaked, leading to a threat of a boycott by the fictitious Snodgrass. According to Powell, &quot;a grass-roots movement was started to try to keep retailers from carrying it by a right-wing Bible thumper in Alabama named &#x27;Margaret Snodgrass&#x27;. She claimed that the comic was morally reprehensible and contacted local area retailers telling them that even allowing the comic to be stocked on their shelves could lead to their ever-lasting damnation. Some listened to her and threatened to stop carrying &quot;The Goon&quot; altogether because of this single issue.&quot;

Eventually, a release date was set as May 16 with the title changed to &quot;Satan&#x27;s $@#%* Baby&quot; and carrying a disclaimer. The inside cover, however, maintained the original title &quot;Satan&#x27;s Sodomy Baby&quot;, along with the original cover art. Four pages of the book reprinted several fan letters in support of the struggle against Snodgrass.

There has never been any evidence of a real boycott, no retailers have ever spoken out on the issue, and there is no evidence of Mrs. Snodgrass&#x27; existence other than a MySpace page created around the time of Powell&#x27;s initial announcement and abandoned immediately after the Sodomy issue was released.

==Spin-offs==
A 3-part miniseries featuring the character Buzzard, set after the events of Goon Year (simply entitled &quot;Buzzard&quot;) was later published in &quot;The Goon: Volume 10&quot;.

&quot;The Goon: Noir&quot; is a series of original short stories by various artists and authors (not including Eric Powell himself), which take place within the world of The Goon. Notable authors include well-known comics such as Tom Lennon, Brian Posehn, and Patton Oswalt.

Not necessarily a spin-off, but maintaining a similar tone while being appropriate for all ages, is another recently published comic by Powell called &quot;Chimichanga&quot;. &quot;Chimichanga&quot; is about a bearded girl, a gorilla monster and a witch. Originally a self-published graphic novel, in September 2011 the novel was published in hardcover format by Dark Horse Comics, with colours by Dave Stewart.

==Film==
The &quot;Goon&quot; official site said in 2008 that a CG animated film of &quot;The Goon&quot; was to be produced by Blur Studio and David Fincher and written by Eric Powell. Clancy Brown was to voice The Goon and Paul Giamatti as Franky. A release date was not specified, nor had a plot. The film&#x27;s future was uncertain as it had trouble procuring funds. The film&#x27;s poster stated that it would be released theatrically. The first trailer from the film was released on 20 July 2010. Powell updated the film status in January 2012, in his words: &quot;&quot;The Goon&quot; is in the exact same position it&#x27;s been in for the past couple of years. Prepping the design and script while searching for funding&quot;.

Blur Studio and Fincher launched a 30-day Kickstarter in October 2012, an on-line fundraising campaign, titled &quot;The Goon&quot; Movie... let&#x27;s KICKSTART this sucker!!!&quot;, to raise $400,000 to finance a story reel for the entire film. The Kickstarter page also explained why they need the money: &quot;&quot;The Goon&quot; film has NEVER been in production. All the work you&#x27;ve seen (animation footage, trailers, artwork, etc.) has been produced independently and out-of-pocket by the creative team of David Fincher, Eric Powell, Blur Studio and Dark Horse Entertainment. We created &quot;proof of concept&quot; footage to show Hollywood the incredible potential of a &quot;Goon&quot; movie. It was very well received BUT because this movie isn&#x27;t a sequel or filled with dancing animals we&#x27;ll need more to bust open the gates and UNLEASH Goon and Franky on Hollywood&quot;. Two days before the deadline, the landmark was achieved, and the campaign closed on November 11, raising $441,900 from 7,576 backers. Blur Studios and Tim Miller teased an upcoming announcement in 2017 regarding the film and said it &quot;would happen&quot;.

The film was announced to be in development with 20th Century Fox and Chernin Entertainment in 2019, but as a result of the Disney/Fox merger, the film was dropped, entering a search for a new distributor. In July 2022, Tim Miller announced that Netflix acquired the distribution rights to the film with Patrick Osborne set to write and direct.

==Collected editions==
The series is collected in trade paperbacks:

The series has also been collected as hardcover &#x27;Fancy Pants Editions&#x27;:

Subsequently, the series has been collected in oversized hardcover Library Editions:

Most recently the series has been collected as paperback Omnibus Editions:

==In other media==
In the 2007 film &quot;Superbad&quot;, Evan is playing a video game in his bedroom while his friend Seth stands in the doorway. During this scene&#x27;s lively exchange, two different posters for &quot;The Goon&quot; are clearly visible hanging on the walls next to each actor.

In the 2007 film &quot;The Mist&quot;, issues of both &quot;The Goon&quot; &amp; &quot;Hellboy&quot; are briefly visible on a rotating comic book rack in the scene when Thomas Jane and a small band of survivors venture into a pharmacy to get drugs for the injured at their home base in the adjoining grocery store.

In the 2008 film &quot;The Sasquatch Gang&quot;, PVC figurines of Goon and Buzzard from the comic are seen on a character&#x27;s desk.

<doc id="1000368" wikidata="Q388995" url="?curid=1000368" title="Trabzon Province">
<text>Trabzon Province () is a province and metropolitan municipality of Turkey on the Black Sea coast. Its area is 4,628 km2, and its population is 818,023 (2022). Located in a strategically important region, Trabzon is one of the oldest trade port cities in Anatolia. Neighbouring provinces are Giresun to the west, Gümüşhane to the southwest, Bayburt to the southeast and Rize to the east. Aziz Yıldırım was appointed Governor of the province in August 2023. The capital of the province is Trabzon.

==Districts==

Trabzon province is divided into 18 districts:
Districts along the 114 km coastline (from west to east): Beşikdüzü, Vakfıkebir, Çarşıbaşı, Akçaabat, Ortahisar, Yomra, Arsin, Araklı, Sürmene and Of.&lt;br&gt;Districts inland: Tonya, Düzköy, Şalpazarı, Maçka, Köprübaşı, Dernekpazarı, Hayrat and Çaykara.

Beşikdüzü and Şalpazarı gained district status in 1988, Çarşıbaşı, Düzköy, Köprübaşı, Dernekpazarı and Hayrat in 1990. The district Ortahisar was created from the former central district of Trabzon Province at the 2013 Turkish local government reorganisation.
==History==


Remarkably attractive throughout its history, Trabzon was the subject of hundreds of travel books by western travellers, some of whom had named it &quot;city of tale in the East.&quot; The capital city Trabzon was founded, as Trapezus, by Greek colonists from Sinope, modern Sinop, Turkey. Starting from the 9th century BC, the city had also been mentioned by historians such as Homeros, Herodotus, Hesiodos. The first written source regarding Trabzon is Anabasis, authored by Xenophon. 

An important Roman and Byzantine centre, it was the capital of the Empire of Trebizond from 1204 to 1461. Trabzon was subsequently made part of the Ottoman Empire by Mehmet the Conqueror. After the region was conquered in 1461, the Fatih Medrese (1462), Hatuniye Medrese (1515), İskender Pasha Medrese (1529) and Hamza Pasha Medrese (1543) were established as important medreses (educational centers; some of them within külliye complexes) of the period. It was initially a &quot;sanjak&quot; before gaining the status of &quot;eyalet&quot;, and finally became a &quot;vilayet&quot; in 1868. 

The province was a site of major fighting between Ottoman and Russian forces during the Caucasus Campaign of World War I, which resulted in the capture of the city of Trabzon by the Russian army under command of Grand Duke Nicholas and Nikolai Yudenich in April 1916. The province was restored to Turkish control in early 1918 following Russia&#x27;s exit from World War I with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.

=== In Turkey ===
In September 1935 the third Inspectorate General (&quot;Umumi Müfettişlik,&quot; UM) was created. Its creation was based on the Law 1164 from June 1927, which was passed in order to Turkefy the population. The Trabzon province was included in this area. The third UM span over the provinces of Erzurum, Artvin, Rize, Trabzon, Kars, Gümüşhane, Erzincan and Ağrı. It was governed by an Inspector General seated in the city of Erzurum. The Inspectorate General was dissolved in 1952 during the Government of the Democrat Party.

=== Archaeology ===
In April 2021, archaeologists announced the discovery of Roman and Byzantine period archeological remains in the Ortahisar district. The southern part of the wicker columns and fortifications of the Roman emperor Hadrian&#x27;s period, trench walls of Byzantine period dating back to 1460 have been discovered. Remains of Roman tiles and pottery were also discovered during the excavations. According to the Trabzon City Municipality, the excavation area is planned to be turned into an open-air museum.

<text>USS &quot;Springfield&quot; (SSN-761), a , is the fourth ship of the United States Navy to bear the name. The boat was named in honor of both the cities of Springfield, Illinois and Springfield, Massachusetts.

The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 21 March 1986, and her keel was laid down on 29 January 1990. She was launched on 4 January 1992 sponsored by Lynn Martin, and commissioned on 9 January 1993. &quot;Springfield&quot; is homeported at Naval Base Guam in Agana, Guam and is assigned to Submarine Squadron FIFTEEN.

In mid-2004, &quot;Springfield&quot; began an extensive overhaul, or Depot Modernization Period (DMP), at the Electric Boat shipyard in Groton. In addition to normal periodic maintenance and repairs, &quot;Springfield&quot; received extensive modernization in fire control systems, sonar processing, weapons launch systems, and communications outfit, a ring laser gyro inertial navigation system, as well as stealth improvements and engine room upgrades. The modernization was the first major overhaul and repair job for Electric Boat in almost 25 years. Originally awarded as a 12 month, $26.3 million depot modernization, &quot;Springfield&quot; was to be the test case for the possibility of awarding future repair and overhaul contracts to Electric Boat. The overhaul was plagued by cost and time overruns, and when finally completed in December 2005, it was several months late and well over budget. Electric Boat has not been awarded any DMP contracts since.

&quot;Springfield&quot; arrived at PNSY on 1 December 2016 to begin an Engineering Overhaul. &quot;Springfield&quot; will undergo planned maintenance work and system certifications primarily focused on modernizing systems associated with the boat&#x27;s engine room.

&quot;Springfield&quot; transferred homeports from Pearl Harbor to Naval Base Guam on March 21, 2022. 

== Awards ==
&quot;Springfield&quot; has deployed overseas on many occasions and earned several Meritorious Unit Commendations and Battle &quot;E&quot; Efficiency awards.

In 1998, &quot;Springfield&quot; won the Captain Edward F. Ney Silver Cup Trophy for outstanding food service (first place in the submarine category). The Ney Memorial Awards, presented annually to the top Navy galleys in ten categories, were established by the Secretary of the Navy and the International Food Service Executives Association (IFSEA) in 1958.

In 2002 the boat received the Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy for most improved ship in the Atlantic Fleet, while under command of Commander D.P. Forney.

In 2003 the boat was awarded the Retention Excellence Award for her squadron. She has also won multiple awards for Navigation, Engineering, Medical, Supply, Damage Control and Deck Seamanship excellence in various years.

<doc id="1000379" wikidata="Q5587960" url="?curid=1000379" title="Gott v. Berea College">
<text>Gott v. Berea College, 161 S.W. 204 (Ky. 1913), was a case heard before the Kentucky Court of Appeals wherein J. S. Gott—a restaurant owner—sued the private institution of Berea College when they issued a new policy in their 1911 student manual that forbid their students from patronizing establishments not owned by the college. Gott believed that the college and its officers had purposely acted unlawfully to injure his business and reputation by enforcing their new policy. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the decision of the lower court of appeals and sided completely with Berea College in this case on the bases of in loco parentis. This was one of the earliest uses of in loco parentis by a private institution and would establish a precedent for decades to come.

==Background==
Berea College is located in Berea, Kentucky and is a private liberal arts college that falls into the category of work colleges. It was founded in 1855 as the first Southern United States college to be coeducational as well as racially integrated. They would typically release a new Student manual as they saw a need for it when governing their students. Over the 1911 summer vacation, the administration revised the student code. Previously, the student code had forbidden students from entering &quot;any place of ill repute, liquor saloons, gambling houses&quot; or similar places. Beginning with the fall semester, which started September 11, 1911, the college promulgated the updated student code, which forbade students from entering &quot;eating houses and places of amusement in Berea not controlled by the college&quot;. The punishment for any violation against the new code was immediate dismissal.

J. S. Gott was a Kentucky Businessman who was born Sep. 1st, 1876 in Virginia and moved to Berea, Kentucky sometime between their birth and 1910 as they are reported to be living in Berea at that time. The exact date is unclear, but around Sep. 1st, 1911, Gott purchased a restaurant across the street from Berea College. This establishment had existed at this location for some years before Gott acquired it. It had sustained itself on the business of the students of the college up till then. Within the coming weeks, this source of business would be forcefully taken away by the updated Student code. This was because of an incident between Sep. 11th and Sep. 20th, where several students were dismissed for patronizing the Gott&#x27;s establishment. So, on Sep. 20th, Gott would file suit against the college, obtaining an injunction to enjoin enforcement of the rule and initially seeking $500 in damages. He later requested an additional $1,500, claiming that the college had slandered him by telling the student body that Gott was a bootlegger. In the following proceedings, the injunction was dissolved, and Gott&#x27;s petition was ultimately dismissed. He appealed the dismissal.

== Judgment ==
The court acknowledged that Gott&#x27;s business had been greatly injured after the rule was effected, but the question was whether the college&#x27;s actions were unlawful and unreasonable. The court laid out a multipoint conclusion deeply interconnected they came to when analyzing the evidence of the case. First, the court reviewed the question of unreasonable, malicious, or wrongful restraint of trade by the actions of the college. They found no evidence to prove it was anything of the sort. Determined that Berea College was not liable for any of the damages done to Gott&#x27;s business considering they had made a lawful act in the proper manner.

Next, considering Berea College was acting &quot;in loco parentis&quot;, the college did have the authority to issue the rule, and students at the college were obligated to conform their behavior to the rule since a &quot;...college or university may prescribe requirements for admission and rules for the conduct of its students, and one who enters as a student impliedly agrees to conform to such rules of government.&quot; The court noted that if Berea was a public institution, one supported &quot;from the public treasure&quot; the case would be quite different, but since Berea College was a private institution, the above-implied contract between student and college was sufficient.

Lastly, the court reviewed the relationship between Gott and Berea College to determine if there was any contractual relationship that the college had failed to uphold toward Gott. They found nothing of the sort, they further noted that Gott was not a student of the college nor did he have a child attending the college. The rule was directed at and intended to govern the student body and only the student body. Hence gave him no right to complain nor meant the college owed him any special duty. He had simply been injured by a rule not meant for him. Berea had proven themselves not liable for any of it and acting in a completely lawful and reasonable manner in line with in loco parentis. The court upheld the verdict of the lower court of appeals.

== Significance ==
Gott v. Berea College set a precedent for the use of in loco parentis by Private universities and colleges. There were previous cases that were cited in the case that helped lay some of the grounds that Berea built its defense on, but this case would be looked back at for decades to come. In loco parentis doctrines would stand strong as private and public education&#x27;s defense for any rules or regulations that would be challenged by students and outside agents.

<doc id="1000386" wikidata="Q3332677" url="?curid=1000386" title="Meditation Upon a Broomstick">
<text>&quot;A Meditation Upon a Broomstick&quot; is a short satire and parody written by Jonathan Swift in 1701. It was first published by Edmund Curll in 1710, against Swift&#x27;s wishes. 

The book is a parody of Robert Boyle&#x27;s meditations and their religious themes. Swift&#x27;s meditations on the fate of men are intentionally nihilistic.

==Origins==
The satire&#x27;s origins lie in Swift&#x27;s time at Moor Park, Surrey, when he acted as Secretary to William Temple. While in the household, Swift would read passages from Robert Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Occasional Reflections upon Several Subjects&quot; (1665) for the young Esther Johnson (&quot;Stella&quot; to Swift).

Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Reflections&quot; took the form of meditations on everyday subjects, where they were likened to religious themes. Boyle would consider a fire, or house cleaning, and see in it a reflection of God&#x27;s relationship to man, or man to his soul. These reflections were very popular in the Temple household. One day, Swift, being bored with the predictability of Boyle&#x27;s points, wrote his own &quot;Meditation&quot; and put it into the book. When the time came to read for the day, he read, instead of Boyle, his own &quot;Meditation Upon a Broomstick&quot;. The ladies of the house did not catch on until near the end of the meditation that it was absurd. 

Swift later wrote up the one-page Meditation in a more formal manner. 
==Publication==
Edmund Curll, in an attempt to antagonize and siphon off money from Swift, published it in 1710 from a manuscript stolen from Swift (which forced Swift to publish a corrected and authorized version that he also had to write from memory).
==Style of the work==
To get a flavor of the &quot;Meditation&quot;, consider the last paragraph:

The &quot;Meditation&quot; begins with a rational moral comparison and proceeds to a frenzy of increasingly unlikely comparisons. While the satire begins with a pitch-perfect imitation of the kindly Boyle&#x27;s tone, it ends in a frantic, misanthropic and misogynistic note of despair and nihilism. While it begins with a hopeful call to self-examination, it moves eventually into a condemnation of all efforts at improvement.

<text>In the military of ancient Rome, decimation () was a form of military discipline in which every tenth man in a group was executed by members of his cohort. The discipline was used by senior commanders in the Roman army to punish units or large groups guilty of capital offences, such as cowardice, mutiny, desertion, and insubordination, and for pacification of rebellious legions. The procedure was an attempt to balance the need to punish serious offences with the realities of managing a large group of offenders.

==Procedure==
A cohort (roughly 480 soldiers) selected for punishment by decimation was divided into groups of ten. Each group drew lots (sortition), and the soldier on whom the lot of the shortest straw fell was executed by his nine comrades, often by stoning, clubbing, or stabbing. The remaining soldiers were often given rations of barley instead of wheat (the latter being the standard soldier&#x27;s diet) for a few days, and required to bivouac outside the fortified security of the camp for some time. 

As the punishment fell by lot, all soldiers in a group sentenced to decimation were potentially liable for execution, regardless of individual degrees of fault, rank, or distinction.

==Usage==
The earliest documented decimation occurred in 471 BC during the Roman Republic&#x27;s early wars against the Volsci and was recorded by Livy. In an incident where his army had been scattered, consul Appius Claudius Sabinus Regillensis had the culprits punished for desertion: centurions, standard-bearers and soldiers who had cast away their weapons were individually scourged and beheaded, while of the remainder, one in ten was chosen by lot and executed.

Polybius gives one of the first descriptions of the practice in the early 3rd century BC:
:If ever these same things happen to occur among a large group of men... the officers reject the idea of bludgeoning or slaughtering all the men involved [as is the case with a small group or an individual]. Instead they find a solution for the situation which chooses by a lottery system sometimes five, sometimes eight, sometimes twenty of these men, always calculating the number in this group with reference to the whole unit of offenders so that this group forms one-tenth of all those guilty of cowardice. And these men who are chosen by lot are bludgeoned mercilessly in the manner described above.

The practice was also used by Alexander the Great against a corps of 6,000 men.

The practice was revived by Marcus Licinius Crassus in 71 BC during the Third Servile War against Spartacus, and some historical sources attribute part of Crassus&#x27; success to it. The total number of men killed through decimation is not known, but it varied on occasion between 1,000 from 10,000 men and 48–50 from a cohort of around 500 men. A specific instance saw 500 men selected by Crassus from the survivors of two legions which had broken and run in combat against the rebel slaves. They were divided into groups of ten, one of whom was chosen by lot regardless of actual behaviour in the battle. The nine remaining legionaries in each party were then forced to club their former comrade to death. The dual purpose intended was to stiffen discipline amongst the army at large and to demoralise the enemy. 

Julius Caesar threatened to decimate the 9th Legion during the war against Pompey, but never did.

Plutarch describes the process in his work &quot;Life of Antony&quot;. After a defeat in Media:
:Antony was furious and employed the punishment known as &quot;decimation&quot; on those who had lost their nerve. What he did was divide the whole lot of them into groups of ten, and then he killed one from each group, who was chosen by lot; the rest, on his orders were given barley rations instead of wheat.

Decimation was still being practised during the time of the Roman Empire, although it was very uncommon. Suetonius records that it was used by Emperor Augustus in 17 BC and later by Galba, while Tacitus records that Lucius Apronius used decimation to punish a full cohort of the III Augusta after their defeat by Tacfarinas in AD 20. G.R. Watson notes that &quot;its appeal was to those obsessed with &quot;nimio amore antiqui moris&quot;&quot; – that is, an excessive love for ancient customs – and notes, &quot;Decimation itself, however, was ultimately doomed, for though the army might be prepared to assist in the execution of innocent slaves, professional soldiers could hardly be expected to cooperate in the indiscriminate execution of their own comrades.&quot; The emperor Macrinus instituted a less harsh &quot;centesimatio&quot;, the execution of every 100th man.

According to legend, the Theban Legion, led by Saint Maurice, was decimated in the third century AD. The legion had refused, to a man, to accede to an order of the emperor, and the process was repeated until none were left. They became known as the Martyrs of Agaunum.

The Eastern Roman Emperor Maurice forbade in his &quot;Strategikon&quot; the &quot;decimatio&quot; and other brutal punishments. According to him, punishments where the rank and file saw their comrades dying by the hands of their own brothers-in-arms could lead to a collapse of morale. Moreover, it could seriously deplete the manpower of the fighting unit.

==Post-classical instances==

=== 16th century ===
The Huguenot garrison of Brouage surrendered to Royalist forces in August 1577 during the French Wars of Religion. When the 800 survivors arrived at La Rochelle the city officials, judging their surrender to have been premature, decimated them.

===17th century===
Von Sparr&#x27;s cuirassier regiment in Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim&#x27;s corps fled the field during the Battle of Lützen (1632) during the Thirty Years&#x27; War in Central Europe. The imperial commander, Wallenstein, appointed a court martial, which directed the execution of the officer in command, Colonel Hagen, together with Lt Col Hofkirchen, ten other officers and five troopers. They were beheaded with the sword, while two men found guilty of looting the baggage were sentenced to a less honourable death, by hanging. The remaining troopers were decimated, one in every ten cavalrymen being hanged; the others were assembled beneath the gallows, beaten, branded and declared outlaws. Their standards were burned by an executioner after the emperor&#x27;s monogram had been cut from the fabric.

Similarly, during the Battle of Breitenfeld (1642), near Leipzig, Colonel Madlo&#x27;s cavalry regiment was the first that fled without striking a blow. This was followed by the massive flight of other cavalry units, an early turning point in the battle. It ended in a decisive victory for the Swedish Army under the command of Field Marshal Lennart Torstenson over an Imperial Army under Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria and his deputy Ottavio Piccolomini, Duke of Amalfi. 

Leopold Wilhelm assembled a court-martial in Prague which sentenced the Madlo regiment to exemplary punishment. Six regiments, which had distinguished themselves in the battle, were assembled fully armed, and surrounded Madlo&#x27;s regiment, which was severely rebuked for its cowardice and misconduct, and ordered to lay down its arms at the feet of General Piccolomini. When they had obeyed this command, their ensigns (flags) were torn in pieces; and the general, having mentioned the causes of their degradation, and erased the regiment from the register of the imperial troops, pronounced the sentence that had been agreed upon in the council of war, condemning the colonel, captains and lieutenants to be beheaded, the ensigns (junior officers) to be hanged, the soldiers to be decimated and the survivors to be driven in disgrace out of the army. 

Ninety men (chosen by rolling dice) were executed at Rokycany, in western Bohemia, now in the Czech Republic, on December 14, 1642 by Jan Mydlář (junior), the son of Jan Mydlář, the famous executioner from Prague. On the first day of the execution, the regiment&#x27;s cords were broken by the executioner. On the second day, officers were beheaded and selected men hanged on the trees on the road from Rokycany to Litohlavy. Another version says that the soldiers were shot, and their bodies hanged from the trees. Their mass grave is said to be on the Black Mound in Rokycany, which commemorates the decimation to this day.

===19th and 20th century===
On September 3, 1866, during the Battle of Curuzu, during the Paraguayan War, the Paraguayan 10th Battalion fled without firing a shot. President Francisco Solano López ordered the decimation of the battalion, which was accordingly formed into line and every tenth man shot.

In 1914, in France, there was a case in which a company of Tunisian &quot;tirailleurs&quot; (colonial soldiers) refused an order to attack and was ordered decimated by the divisional commander. This involved the execution of ten men.

Italian general Luigi Cadorna allegedly applied decimation to underperforming units during World War I. However, the British military historian John Keegan records that his &quot;judicial savagery&quot; during the Battle of Caporetto took the form of the summary executions of individual stragglers rather than the formalized winnowing of entire detachments. Certainly one specific instance of actual decimation did occur in the Italian Army during the war, on May 26, 1916. This involved the execution of one in ten soldiers of a 120-strong company of the 141st Catanzaro Infantry Brigade, which had mutinied. Officers, &quot;carabinieri&quot; and non-mutinying soldiers had been killed during the outbreak.

During the German Revolution of 1918–1919, 29 men from the Volksmarinedivision were executed after 300 men turned up to receive their discharge papers and back pay.

Decimation can be also used to punish the enemy. In 1918, during the Finnish Civil War, White troops, after conquering the Red city of Varkaus, summarily executed around 80 captured Reds in what became known as the Lottery of Huruslahti. According to some accounts, the Whites ordered all the captured Reds to assemble in a single row on the ice of Lake Huruslahti, selected every tenth prisoner, and executed him on the spot. The selection was not entirely random though, as some prisoners (primarily Red leaders) were specifically selected for execution and other individuals were intentionally spared.

==Current usage of the word==
The term &quot;decimation&quot; was first used in English to mean a tax of one-tenth (or tithe). Through a process of semantic change starting in the 17th century, the word evolved to refer to any extreme reduction in the number of a population or force, or an overall sense of destruction and ruin, not strictly in the punitive sense or to a reduction by one-tenth. Despite its history, criticism of the broader sense has been noted by some language experts, including Bryan A. Garner, H. W. Fowler, and the Lake Superior State University annual &quot;Banished Words List&quot; in 2008.

<text>Channel [V] (&quot;V&quot; as in the letter, not the Roman numeral &quot;5&quot;) is a Chinese and former Asian pay television musical network originally launched by Star TV Hong Kong (now Disney Networks Group Asia Pacific). It was part of the unit of Disney International Operations, and was launched in September 1991 to replace the first incarnation of MTV&#x27;s Asian operation before it was shut down on October 1, 2021.

The mainland Chinese version is owned by Star China Media, and is still operational, since they&#x27;re a subsidiary of China Media Capital. The Australian channels were owned by Foxtel before their closure.

Channel [V] previously operated either a local feed or a relay of the international version in Hong Kong, Macau, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Thailand or localized versions in India, the Philippines, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Australia.

== History ==
===Early years===
====MTV Asia (15 September 1991 – 2 May 1994)====
Channel [V] was originally launched on 15 September 1991 as MTV Asia (). It was a 24-hour music channel broadcast in English, Hindi and Chinese, focused on pop music. The STAR TV Network, which is based in Hong Kong (now called Hong Kong, China since 1997), operated the channel in partnership with Viacom in the United States, which owned MTV-branded regional music channels there. The channel was broadcast across the continent of Asia, reaching from the Far East to the Middle East, as with the AsiaSat 1&#x27;s footprint. The STAR TV Network have since regionalized the channel to serve its huge viewerships.

On 2 May 1994, MTV Asia left the STAR TV Network as the contract with Viacom expired.

====Channel [V]====
On 27 May 1994, under the leadership of managing director Gary Davey, Channel [V] was launched as a replacement of MTV Asia with VJs (who used to work on MTV Asia) celebrating on air from various locations; the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal, Downtown Tokyo, the Himalayas etc. At the same time, Channel [V] officially &#x27;split&#x27; its beam, in effect, providing two separate services for different regional audiences within the AsiaSat 1&#x27;s footprint. This enables the channel to provide appropriate programming and viewing time for its viewers from different regions in Asia.

On 5 June 1994, Channel [V] has opened up its production facilities in Taipei, Taiwan.

On 4 July 1994, Sigaw Manila was launched on the Northern Beam.

On 1 August 1994, BPL Oye! was launched on the Southern Beam.

On 5 June 1994, Channel [V] has opened up its production facilities in Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay), India.

On 27 April 1995, the STAR TV Network starts transmitting Channel [V] on the Palapa B2R satellite to Indonesia and the Philippines.

On 30 April 1995, Channel [V] has opened up its production facilities in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates producing Sony Yalla!, the first ever Arabic Top 10 Countdown in the Middle East was launched on the Southern Beam.

On 4 August 1996, a Thai-localized feed of Channel [V] was launched in Thailand, as carried on Thai cable and satellite providers. This apparently replaced Channel [V] International in the country, but the pan-Asian feed would still be available in Thailand via both AsiaSat and Palapa satellites.

In 1997, Channel [V] International was launched in the Middle East on the Middle Eastern digital satellite TV platform Orbit Communications Company as part of the STAR Select package.

On 15 July 1997, Channel [V] International was launched in Japan on the Japanese digital satellite TV platform SKY PerfecTV!.

In 1999, the president of rival MTV Networks Asia conceded that Channel V was a very close competitor in Taiwan and Thailand.

On 27 April 2021, Disney announced that Channel [V] would be closing down on 1 October as part of its winddown of traditional cable/satellite networks across Southeast Asia and Hong Kong in favor of focusing on both Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar. Thus the channel space initially created by the first incarnation of MTV Asia in 1991 subsequently ceased to exist on October 1, 2021. As a result, Channel [V] remains on-air only in Mainland China.

==Operating channel==
=== Mainland China ===

Channel [V] Mainland China is the Chinese branch of the Channel [V] network. It started operating in Mainland China in 1994 as part of Channel [V] Asia. Fox International Channels Asia Pacific sold certain Mandarin language entertainment television channels that target Mainland China, including Channel [V] Mainland China, to China Media Capital. As a result, Channel [V] Mainland China is a part of Star China Media as of 2014 along with Xing Kong. It was broadcast free-to-air on AsiaSat 7. Channel [V] switches between Simplified and Traditional Chinese with selected Channel [V] International programs airing with Chinese subtitles.

Channel [V] Asia was the flagship of the Channel [V] network. It was founded after MTV Asia separated with the STAR TV Network after the expiration of its contract. It was produced and operated from Hong Kong from January 1994 until January 2002, after which operations and studios were shifted to Malaysia with some aspects still operating in Hong Kong. Since January 1, 2008, Channel [V] International has moved back to its original studio in Hong Kong, which is also the same studio of Channel [V] China and Taiwan.

After 27 years of broadcasting, Channel [V] along with most of the other The Walt Disney Company channels across Southeast Asia and Hong Kong officially ceased broadcasting and transmission on October 1, 2021, at exactly midnight (based on Jakarta&#x27;s time) with the final music video being M to the B by Millie B. In the Philippines, the channel space was now replaced by ViacomCBS&#x27;s Nickelodeon on October 1, 2021 on G Sat and ABS-CBN cable music channel Myx on Cignal, while in the rest of Southeast Asia, Channel V was now replaced by other channels from other content providers.

<doc id="1000401" wikidata="Q7654785" url="?curid=1000401" title="Swedish National Union of Students">
<text>The Swedish National Union of Students (, SFS), is an umbrella organisation of students&#x27; unions at higher education facilities in Sweden. The organisation was founded in 1921. It has around 47 affiliated students&#x27; unions, gathering around 270,000 students (2012).

The large number of organised students can in part be explained by the fact that membership in the official local students&#x27; union was mandatory for students at universities and university colleges in Sweden until 2010. The requirement has a long history back to the precursor to Swedish students&#x27; unions, the students&#x27; nations where membership became mandatory in 1667.

The local students&#x27; union is, however, free to decide whether to join the National Union of Students or not. Although a majority of the students&#x27; unions are members, some have opted to stay out, including several organising business, law and medicine students. Occasionally, affiliated unions choose to leave the organisation, but sometimes rejoin at a later date, a pattern followed by both the Stockholm University Students&#x27; Union and the Uppsala Student Union.

The organisation works to represent the interest of its members on a national level, towards the Government, the Swedish Parliament, the political parties and the government agencies concerned with higher education. The organisation is also active on the international arena, particularly within the European Students&#x27; Union, ESU.

At the annual national conference representatives from the member students&#x27; unions meet to decide on the policy framework of the organisation and to elect a national board. The board has 11 members, including the President and Vice President, in 2023 it was voted that the board 24/25 will have 9 board members with the President and Vice accountedfor. The President and the Vice Presidents work full-time at the head office in Stockholm during their term.

Several former student politicians in Sweden have moved on to high-level national party politics. Among them are Olof Palme (President 1953), and Fredrik Reinfeldt (Board member 1989/90)

==Doctoral students==
Postgraduate or doctoral students have a committee within SFS called &quot;SFS Doktorandkommitté&quot; (SFS DK). Formerly, the organisation &quot;Sveriges Doktorander&quot; (Sweden&#x27;s Doctoral Students, SDok) existed. SDok was formed on 29 April 1997, aiming to contribute to improving research education in Sweden and to encourage deeper collaboration and increase the exchange of information between the country&#x27;s doctoral students. One of the aims of SDok was to influence Student Unions and universities/colleges to employ Doctoral Student Councillors (&quot;doktorandombudsman&quot;). In 2008, SDok was merged with SFS DK.

SFS DK is a member of Eurodoc, the European federation of national organisations of young researchers.

<text>Ed the Sock is a sock puppet character, created and voiced by Steven Joel Kerzner, who first appeared on Canadian local cable television in 1987. He is best known for his hosting appearances in the 1990s on MuchMusic and his own late night talk show, &quot;Ed&#x27;s Night Party&quot;. He is a gray sock puppet with green hair, round eyes, a scowl, a cigar and a rough, gravelly voice.

Since the acquisition of MuchMusic by Bell Media, causing the cancellation of the majority of its music programming, the Ed the Sock character has continued to be portrayed through FU Network and NewMusicNation. 

== History ==

=== Origination of the Character: Newton Cable (1984–1993) ===
Kerzner originated the character while working at Newton Cable, a small local cable television provider in the city of North York, part of Metropolitan Toronto. In addition to providing cable TV services for parts of the North York neighbourhoods of Downsview, Bathurst Manor, and Westminster-Branson, the company also ran a local cable TV channel. During this time one of the public access shows the station produced needed a co-host on short notice, so Kerzner took a sock and other supplies from the station&#x27;s craft closet and made a sock puppet with glue caps for eyes. He named the puppet Ed after Ed Asner and co-hosted the segment himself. He enjoyed the experience and continued to do the character, improving the sock puppet&#x27;s look and changing its voice somewhat over time. In these early years Ed the Sock served as the sidekick to &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;&#x27;s human hosts, which included Stan Glass, Harland Williams and Eric Tunney (for almost three years). Tim Rykert also hosted for a time. By 1987 Kerzner became a producer and director of programming.

=== Rogers Cable (1993–1995) ===
After Newton was purchased by Rogers in 1993, Kerzner repackaged &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; for a wider cable audience. At this point Tunney as its host and star. The new show attracted the interest of producer John Brunton, who took the program to CITY-TV.

=== CityTV (1995–2008) ===
==== &quot;Night Party&quot; ====
The show, which would come to be known as &quot;Night Party&quot;, debuted on February 10, 1995, at 10:30 pm Eastern Time. When Tunney left the show to pursue TV hosting and comedy opportunities in the U.S., he was replaced by &quot;Humble&quot; Howard Glassman (better known as half of the local radio morning show Humble &amp; Fred), and though Ed the Sock was the only returning element of the old show he was still a sidekick to the star and not the star himself. The synopsis of the show&#x27;s first season reads: &quot;Humble Howard and sidekick Ed the cigar smoking, wise-guy sock host a talk show featuring talent spotlights, celebrity interviews and studio audience interaction&quot;.

Within the show&#x27;s first year Brunton and Glassman both departed the series. Brunton cited creative differences with Kerzner, while Humble Howard said he simply could no longer stand working with Kerzner. Their relationship remains contentious today:

After Humble Howard&#x27;s departure the show continued with more focus on Ed and less on his human co-host. Canadian comedian Craig Campbell replaced Glassman and stayed with the show for a decade. Ed&#x27;s longest running and arguably most popular co-host, Campbell had a very laid-back demeanor and took a more polite approach with the audience, playing &quot;good cop&quot; to Ed&#x27;s cruder antics.

In 2008 &quot;Ed&#x27;s Night Party&quot; entered its 14th season and in a surprise move, Campbell was replaced by Steven Joel Kerzner&#x27;s wife Liana Kerzner (billing herself as &quot;Liana K&quot; and frequently referred to simply as &quot;Red&quot; by Ed). Ed&#x27;s first female co-host, she was a busty redhead who produced a pin-up calendar of herself which was offered for sale on Ed&#x27;s website. Liana had dropped out of school in 1997 when she and Kerzner started dating to become a writer and co-producer on the show.

After the addition of his wife as co-host in what would become its final season, the show was re-branded as &quot;Ed &amp; Red&#x27;s Night Party&quot; and increasingly emphasized appearances by porn stars, strippers in a hot tub, and the kind of frat-party excesses that Ed used to pillory. This resulted in criticism and complaints, largely from female viewers who grew tired of the shows rampant sexist clips and comments, which included such segments as &quot;LoCoDe&quot; (Lowest Common Denominator), porn star visits, and weekly clips of drunk spring break girls in Wet T-shirt contests with Ed providing joke commentary.

In its 14th and final season the series was also broadcast on G4 in the U.S. as part of their &quot;Midnight Spank&quot; late night television programming block.

In June 2008, Rogers announced that &quot;Ed &amp; Red&#x27;s Night Party&quot; would be canceled as of August 31, 2008, in an effort to attract female viewers, who disapproved of Ed&#x27;s politically incorrect and sexist shtick. The final show aired Friday, August 29, 2008. This also marked the end of Kerzner&#x27;s relationship with both &quot;Much&quot; and &quot;Citytv&quot;, with Kerzner stating after Rogers announced their decision to ax Ed the Sock: &quot;It appears Citytv is heading towards something more of a women&#x27;s channel, I don&#x27;t know.&quot;

After &quot;Night Party&quot;&#x27;s cancellation, Kerzner stated that the Ed character would live on in other projects that were already in the works, &quot;for this fall or possibly a few months after that&quot;, including other shows on competing networks and a feature film, though these projects never materialized and he remained off the air for more than two years.

==== Ed&#x27;s Nite In ====
At CityTV, Ed also hosted &quot;Ed&#x27;s Nite In&quot;, a short-lived series in which he would invite &quot;friends&quot; over to watch (and make fun of) bad movies. The show was slightly different from Ed&#x27;s later bad movie show &quot;This Movie Sucks!&quot; in that the movies they broadcast were more current in &quot;Ed&#x27;s Nite In&quot; and Ed and his friends did not comment during the movies, only before and after commercial breaks, which also included sketches.

=== MuchMusic (1995–2005) ===
After moving &quot;Night Party&quot; to &quot;Citytv&quot;, Ed also began making appearances concurrently on MuchMusic. This lasted from the mid-1990s until he was released by &quot;Much&quot; in 2005.

==== Ed&#x27;s Big Wham Bam ====
While at &quot;Much&quot;, Ed hosted the short-lived series &quot;Ed&#x27;s Big Wham Bam&quot;, a live weekly two-hour program that featured viewers performing talents such as singing, dancing, and cooking. The show was canceled by the network due to poor ratings.

==== Fromage takeover ====
In the late 1990s, MuchMusic VJ Christopher Ward, the creator of Much&#x27;s annual &quot;Fromage&quot; special (so named because it mocked the year&#x27;s &quot;cheesiest&quot; music videos), decided to no longer host the show himself. Ed accepted an offer to take over hosting duties, which he did until Much canceled the specials in 2005.

&quot;Fromage&quot; may be the most popular project Ed has been involved with, and he has repeatedly stated that he plans to bring it back in some form.

=== CHCH-TV Hamilton (2010–2012) ===
==== This Movie Sucks! ====
In 2010, after more than two years off the air, Ed returned to television on regional CHCH-TV in Hamilton with &quot;This Movie Sucks!&quot;, which was similar to his previous &quot;CityTV&quot; show &quot;Ed&#x27;s Nite In&quot;. Kerzner relied on the use of student interns from nearby Mohawk College and the show was initially plagued with technical issues.

The show was once again co-hosted by his wife Liana K and featured comedian Ron Sparks. In each two hour episode Ed has guests over to watch (and make fun of) a bad movie. &quot;This Movie Sucks!&quot; was named one of the five best television shows of 2010 by &quot;Toronto Entertainment&quot; and one of the three best new shows of 2010 by &quot;Excalibur Magazine&quot;. A third season of &quot;This Movie Sucks!&quot; was reported to be in production but never materialized, with &quot;CHCH&quot; announcing that no future episode screenings were planned.

==== I Hate Hollywood ====
Produced concurrently with &quot;This Movie Sucks!&quot; on CHCH-TV was another Ed-hosted series called &quot;I Hate Hollywood,&quot; which Kerzner based on &quot;Fromage&quot;&#x27;s style and template. It was originally supposed to premiere in September 2010, but was pushed back several times until it finally began airing on Wednesday nights, beginning May 2, 2012. The show, once again co-hosted by his wife Liana, made fun of the latest celebrity gossip and news but only lasted a few episodes before being canceled by the network.

Ed the Sock has not had a show on network TV since this show&#x27;s cancellation by CHCH.

==== The Being Frank Show ====
Ed briefly became Frank D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s sidekick on The Being Frank Show in 2011–2012, which aired during late night infomercial slots purchased by host and beer entrepreneur Frank D&#x27;Angelo on &quot;CHCH-TV&quot;, the same network that aired &quot;This Movie Sucks!&quot; and &quot;I Hate Hollywood&quot;.

=== FU Network ===

After launching fundraisers beginning in 2015, in late 2016 Ed the Sock announced the &quot;FU Network&quot;, a video sharing website, from which he would share old and new clips. He also announced he would begin live streaming a new live weekly show from the entrance/lobby of the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant in downtown Toronto, Ontario called &quot;Live from Canada, It&#x27;s Ed the Sock!&quot; 

The Toronto location of Hard Rock Cafe closed on May 31, 2017, making future shows from that location impossible.

In April 2017, Ed posted a video to his YouTube channel called &quot;Who Murdered MuchMusic&quot;, documenting what he refers to is the demise and downfall of the Canadian music channel by pointing the finger at Bell Media and claiming that their behind the scenes management killed the station. The video was pulled by YouTube after Bell Media complained about copyright infringement stemming from Kerzner&#x27;s use of footage and logos owned by the company.

In July 2018, he launched an Indiegogo campaign to have the network officially launch online, promising to bring back old &quot;MuchMusic&quot; shows from the 1990s and early 2000s. Although his Indiegogo campaign failed to reach his goal of $35,000, Ed announced that he had met the goal through additional PayPal donations people had also made, and that the &quot;FU Network&quot; launched as planned, it has since been merged with Ed&#x27;s website.

=== NewMusicNation (2021) ===

In 2021, Ed launched an Indiegogo campaign and website to support NewMusicNation, an online platform for new Canadian music with new VJs. The platform also seeks to support musical acts who have been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.

In May 2023, Ed the Sock was announced as the host of an overnight radio program on 94.9 The Rock in Oshawa, Ontario.

== Controversies ==

=== Night Party ===
&quot;Night Party&quot; aired in the late-night slot because of its overt depictions of sexuality, primarily involving sexualized, scantily clad (frequently topless) women and Ed&#x27;s off-color remarks. The show was dismissed by many critics as nothing more than dirty &quot;vaudeville schtick&quot; overly relying on sex and bathroom jokes, with a &quot;phallic in nature and attitude&quot; host described as a &quot;prurient party animal who feeds on his own misanthropy and sexism&quot; and whose comedy, &quot;vacillating between penetrating satire and pointless vulgarity&quot; appealed only to &quot;17 year old boys&quot;. Because of the crude, sexist humor, coarse language and nudity, a disclaimer had to preface the airing of every episode in the series&#x27; run.

Complaints were filed with the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council throughout the show&#x27;s run because of the prevalent &quot;sexism&quot; and allegations the show was &quot;derogatory to women&quot;, with some of those complaints upheld. A January 2004 episode received criticism and complaints after Ed, Craig and Liana jokingly compared sex with women to stabbing women.

In a further CBSC decision in March 2005 following a separate complaint, it was ruled that the viewer advisory screened before and during episodes of Night Party was insufficient under the CBA Code of Ethics and needed to be strengthened.

Most infamously, following a stunt with a porn star named Doria in 1999, in which she stripped naked and pretended to have sex in &quot;cowgirl&quot; position with the Ed puppet on her hotel bed, many viewers complained and several stations dropped the show, including the entire province of Alberta where the show was banned for some time.

=== Triumph the Insult Comic Dog ===
Kerzner has accused Triumph the Insult Comic Dog&#x27;s creator Robert Smigel of ripping off Ed the Sock. The controversy dates back to 1997 when Kerzner claims Ed was set to appear on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; but was suddenly cancelled, months before Smigel&#x27;s Triumph debuted on that show. Conan and NBC maintain that Ed was never even tentatively booked to appear on the show. Kerzner afterwards expressed such resentment towards Triumph and Smigel that NBC stated they &quot;didn&#x27;t want Ed anywhere near Triumph&quot; when Conan visited Canada for a week of shows during February 2004, with the Canadian network complying.

When Smigel and Pets.com became embroiled in lawsuits over the Triumph and Pets.com dog puppet characters, Kerzner renewed his claims that Triumph had ripped him off. Kerzner claimed that he did not sue Smigel because &quot;we don&#x27;t want to give that dog that much attention.&quot;

===Other===
In 2005, Kerzner&#x27;s &quot;Ed&#x27;s Night Party&quot; co-producer James Stamos was ejected from a Toronto Blue Jays game for wearing a shirt promoting the show that other fans complained was offensive. An usher asked him to turn the shirt inside out, but Stamos refused.

After being announced as one of the 2007 Beaches Lions Club Easter Parade marshals, Ed the Sock was removed following dozens of complaints by concerned Beaches residents. The organizers determined Kerzner&#x27;s act was &quot;too raunchy for a community event&quot; and replaced him with fellow Canadian comedian Luba Goy (of the Royal Canadian Air Farce comedy troupe).

In 2020, Ed the Sock was criticized for what were described as racist comments concerning New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh. NDP MP Don Davies described Ed the Sock&#x27;s use of &quot;Jughead&quot; to refer to Singh as &quot;pure racism&quot;; several Liberal MPs including Health Minister Patty Hajdu and Minister of Digital Government Joyce Murray condemned Ed the Sock&#x27;s comments.

== Inspirations ==
Ed&#x27;s look has become more well defined over the years but is a basic sock puppet design very similar to any other, such as Shari Lewis&#x27;s famous Lamb Chop and other sock puppet characters.

Kerzner has claimed that Ed&#x27;s voice is based on two actual people (non-celebrities), a friend&#x27;s father and step-father, whose names remain undisclosed. However at other times he has said that Ed&#x27;s voice is a combination of a “friend’s dad, Oscar the Grouch and Jack Klugman from &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;.”

The name &quot;Ed&quot; was inspired by actor Ed Asner who Kerzner enjoyed watching in &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and whose gruff voice is another inspiration for the puppet.

== Other appearances ==
Despite being a vocal critic of Video on Trial and saying he would never appear on it because in his opinion it was never as good as &quot;Fromage&quot;, Ed was a guest on that show in 2013, nine years after his days as a regular at MuchMusic had ended. It was supposed to be a chance for Ed to reach a &quot;nationwide audience&quot; again, and &quot;expose Ed to a whole new generation.&quot; Kerzner said Ed would be in the show&#x27;s regular rotation of comedians after that, but he never appeared on the show again.

Ed has made some radio appearances and has guested at sci-fi conventions. Kerzner sponsored and co-hosted as Ed (with his wife Liana) the first Constellation Awards in 2007. He also was an advice columnist for &quot;Faze Magazine&quot; in 2001 and 2002. The Kerzners also have a now-defunct New Year&#x27;s Eve convention Futurecon, which ended abruptly in 2014 after only running for three years (2011-2014).

On June 23, 2011, Ed and Liana began hosting the short-lived &quot;Ed &amp; Red&#x27;s Podcast&quot; for gwmp.tv. They have announced plans to bring their podcast back in some form.

In 2011 Ed made several appearances as Frank D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s sidekick on The Being Frank Show, a paid infomercial program on CHCH-TV, the same network which formerly produced &quot;This Movie Sucks!&quot; and &quot;I Hate Hollywood&quot;.

Kerzner also appeared as a stand-up comedian in his friend Frank D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s independent film The Joke Thief.

In 2018 Ed appeared as a guest on the fourth episode of &quot;Quillette″s&quot; Wrongspeak podcast.

Ed has made several attempts to be asked to appear on the Juno Awards but has not been successful as of yet. He claims the Junos have a &quot;grudge&quot; against him.

== FU Party ==
In 2010, Ed announced his intention to run for Prime Minister of Canada in the 2011 federal election as head of the new FU Party, a joke political party never registered with Elections Canada, which he claimed stood for &quot;Fed-Up Party&quot;. The FU Party&#x27;s stated goals included &quot;fighting apathy and stupidity in government&quot;. Throughout the campaign the &quot;FU Party News Centre&quot; posted links to various articles and videos trying to encourage people to vote and criticizing the political establishment, especially the Conservative government and re-election campaign of Stephen Harper. Around this time, Ed also started his own WordPress blog called &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Puppet!&quot; where he elaborated his thoughts on politics but also on the media industry.

He searched for volunteer candidates to run in ridings across Canada, as well as a volunteer &quot;Facebook expert&quot; to help promote Ed and his party, until April 2011.

Although the Conservatives actually picked up 23 seats and the Liberals lost 43, Ed declared victory for the FU Party on April 28, 2011, claiming that he had successfully assailed apathy and taking credit for the record turnout at advance polls, although actual voter turnout ended up being only slightly higher than in 2008, which helped the governing Conservative Party to win a majority of seats.

After the election Ed stated that the &quot;Orange Surge&quot; showed Canadians had learned that they have a choice. While not officially endorsing the New Democratic Party, Ed stated that the &quot;NDP has become the FU vote&quot;. Ed also stated he hopes the FU Party will continue to provide &quot;smartass commentary for a dumbass political establishment&quot;.

In the 2015 election, Ed once again announced he was running for Prime Minister under the FU banner.

<text>L.A.M.B. is a fashion line by American singer Gwen Stefani, the lead vocalist of the rock band No Doubt. The line manufactures apparel and fashion accessories. It was founded in 2003 and made its runway debut in 2004. The line&#x27;s name is an acronym of Stefani&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; As of 2015, the line currently focuses on eyewear.

The line was influenced by a variety of cultures&#x27; fashions, including Guatemalan, Japanese, Indian and Jamaican styles. Stefani came from a family of seamstresses. This further inspired her to launch her own fashion line. The line achieved popularity among celebrities and was worn by stars such as Teri Hatcher, Nicole Kidman, Paris Hilton and Stefani herself. The fashion line made a runway debut in the spring collection of 2004 and achieved mainstream success at New York Fashion Week in 2005. An additional fashion line, called Harajuku Lovers, was subsequently launched by Stefani.

==History==

Stefani&#x27;s first experience designing clothes came when she and her mother would sew clothes for themselves when she was young. Stefani comes from a long line of seamstresses, as even her great-grandmother would sew clothes. Stefani made most of the things she wore onstage during concerts. When she became successful and began to tour constantly, she felt she lost her way. Then she met the stylist Andrea Lieberman. Lieberman introduced her to ready-to-wear clothing. Later Lieberman became her creative consultant and Zaldy Goco took over as the head designer. Goco parted ways with L.A.M.B. in 2007.

L.A.M.B. started out as a collaboration with LeSportsac in 2003. The name L.A.M.B. is an acronym which stands for &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot;, which is also the name of Stefani&#x27;s first solo album.

==Products==

The fashion line manufactures clothes, shoes, bags and a fragrance called &quot;L&quot;. The brand started out as a line for women but claims the track items are unisex. The clothes were manufactured by Ska Girl LLC, which was founded in 2003 by Ken Erman, president of L.A.M.B.

The eyewear collection launched in January 2016. It won 3 of 20/20 - Vision Monday Reader&#x27;s Choice awards: Frame Brand Introduced 2016, Sunglass Brand Introduced 2016 &amp; Frame Brand – Women.

L.A.M.B joined with Royal Elastics for the shoe line. Stefani then started to widen the footwear line for adults to include boots and stilettos. L.A.M.B collaborated with Coty Inc. for the fragrance and with LeSportsac for handbags in 2003. Stefani went on to design a new line of handbags with Shifter and Partners in 2006. The bags feature LeSportsac&#x27;s rip-stop nylon along with a variety of antiqued metal hardware, leather trims and colorful linings. Stefani planned to design lingerie as well as make-up products for L.A.M.B. L.A.M.B. partnered with Vestal Group on a line of 39 women&#x27;s watches.

L.A.M.B. products were relatively expensive, with apparel priced $55 to $1100, handbags priced $80 to $825, and watches priced $125 to $995.

===Fragrance===

Coty Inc. announced a global licensing agreement with Stefani, to develop and market fragrances for L.A.M.B.

The fragrance called &quot;L&quot; was launched in September 2007 at Soho House in New York City. Stefani worked with perfumer Harry Fremont to develop the scent. Stefani described the fragrance as &quot;it&#x27;s another thing you can wear and another thing I can be part of creatively. I created it for myself -- it&#x27;s like me shrunk into a box.&quot;

==Promotion and fashion shows==
Stefani frequently referred to her clothing line in her music, as one of the brand&#x27;s promotional strategies. Stefani refers to her clothing line in her songs &quot;Wind It Up,&quot; &quot;Harajuku Girls,&quot; and &quot;Crash&quot; (which even incorporates the brand&#x27;s slogan, &quot;I want you all over me like L.A.M.B.&quot;). Stefani is often seen wearing her own designs, especially when making public appearances. A thirty-second commercial directed by Sophie Muller was also released to promote the brand&#x27;s fragrance.

L.A.M.B. had participated in the Spring/Summer 2006, 2007, and 2008 New York Fashion Weeks. Stefani described her first line, which debuted on September 16, 2005, as &quot;a little Sound of Music, some Orange County chola girl, some Rasta, and a bit of The Great Gatsby.&quot; The highlights of the show were purple cars bouncing using hydraulics while Stefani&#x27;s song &quot;Wind It Up&quot; made its debut as the models walked the runway.

For Spring/Summer 2007, Stefani opted for a presentation rather than a catwalk show. The models, all donning identical blond wigs, wore designs Stefani said were inspired by Michelle Pfeiffer&#x27;s role as Elvira Hancock in the 1983 &quot;Scarface&quot;. The show included some of Stefani&#x27;s trademark tracksuits and extensively referenced prints from Guatemala, India, and Japan. On September 5, 2007, L.A.M.B opened New York&#x27;s Spring/Summer 2008 Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. The collection &quot;looked like the sixties as seen by someone who grew up in the eighties&quot; and incorporated influences from Stefani&#x27;s ska roots.

==Critical reception==

The line was mostly well received by critics and Stefani was appreciated for taking fashion seriously even though she is a celebrity. Fern Mallis of IMG praised the line and Stefani as well and said, &quot;the L.A.M.B. line is clearly at the top of these lines and is as unique and individual as Gwen herself.&quot; The shoes were well received by the critics, though considered to be pricey. Desiree Stimpert of About.com said, &quot; ... these shoes aren&#x27;t for everyone, but will most definitely appeal to fans of Ms. Stefani&#x27;s music and fashion - sense.&quot; Tim Stack of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said, &quot;L.A.M.B.&#x27;s embellished tracksuits, Rasta-inspired knits, and gaucho-heel combos deliver the edge&quot; Nicole Phelps of Style.com said, &quot;The collection, which looked like the sixties as seen by someone who grew up in the eighties, was altogether more wearable and on trend.&quot; Fashion journalist Cathy Horyn of &quot;The New York Times&quot; differed and said, &quot;If ever there was a reason for a pop star to concentrate on her vocal skills, it was Gwen Stefani&#x27;s fashion meltdown.&quot;

==Commercial success==
The brand was sold in 275 stores worldwide and was seen worn on celebrities including Teri Hatcher, Nicole Kidman, Kelly Ripa, Paris Hilton, and Stefani herself. L.A.M.B sales had expanded from $40 million in 2005 to a predicted $90 million in 2006. In March 2008, it was reported the line reached sales of $100 million. According to a Nordstrom spokesperson, the debut of L.A.M.B.&#x27;s watch line was the store&#x27;s most successful watch launch ever. The brand&#x27;s designs have appeared in &quot;W&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Lucky&quot; and &quot;InStyle&quot;.

<text>The Radical Whigs were a group of British political commentators associated with the British Whig faction who were at the forefront of the Radical movement.

==Seventeenth century==

The radical Whigs ideology &quot;arose from a series of political upheavals in 17th-century England: the English Civil War, the exclusion crisis of 167981, and the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Broadly speaking, this Whig theory described two sorts of threats to political freedom: a general moral decay which would invite the intrusion of evil and despotic rulers, and the encroachment of executive authority upon the legislature, the attempt that power always made to subdue the liberty protected by mixed government.&quot; This political theory was mainly based on the writings of John Milton, John Locke, James Harrington, and Algernon Sydney.

==Eighteenth century==

The 18th-century Whigs, or commonwealthmen, in particular John Trenchard, Thomas Gordon, and Benjamin Hoadly, &quot;praised the mixed constitution of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, and they attributed English liberty to it; and like Locke they postulated a state of nature from which rights arose which the civil polity, created by mutual consent, guaranteed; they argued that a contract formed government and that sovereignty resided in the people.&quot;

The radical Whigs&#x27; political ideas played a significant role in the development of the American Revolution, as their republican writings were widely read by the American colonists, many of whom were convinced by their reading that they should be very watchful for any threats to their liberties. Subsequently, when the colonists were indignant about their lack of representation and taxes such as the Stamp Act, the Sugar Act and the Tea Act, the colonists broke away from the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United States of America. &quot;Radical Whig perceptions of politics attracted widespread support in America because they revived the traditional concerns of a Protestant culture that had always verged on Puritanism. That moral decay threatened free government could not come as a surprise to a people whose fathers had fled England to escape sin. The importance of virtue, frugality, industry, and calling was at the heart of their moral code. An overbearing executive, and the threat of corruption through idle, useless officials, or placemen, had figured prominently in their explanations of their exile in America.&quot; So &quot;most&quot; of the ideas the American Revolutionaries put into their political system &quot;were a part of the great tradition of the eighteenth-century commonwealthmen.&quot;

Although the commonwealthmen had little influence on British politics in the eighteenth century, their political ideas had a long-term effect on Britain&#x27;s constitutional system: constitutional monarchy, which in turn became a model for other countries, for example, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium.

<text>Idaho has produced a number of musicians and bands, including Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders, Built to Spill, Treepeople, and Caustic Resin. Rosalie Sorrels is a renowned folk singer born in Boise. Minimalist composer La Monte Young was born in Bern. Jazz double bassist Gary Peacock was born in Burley. Nikki Sixx (bassist of glam metal band Mötley Crüe) grew up in Jerome. Moscow, Idaho is the home town of modern folk/country/indie songwriter Josh Ritter.

The town of Weiser has held fiddling contests since the 1890s, when the instrument arrived in Idaho on the Oregon Trail. Since the early 1950s, Weiser has been home to the National Oldtime Fiddlers&#x27; Contest, held in June and hosting more than 20,000 people a year. The late Kevin Sharp who had a hit song with &quot;Nobody Knows but Me&quot; lived in Weiser, Idaho and then moved to Los Angeles. Idaho is also home to the National Oldtime Fiddlers&#x27; Hall of Fame.

==Music venues and institutions==
There is an Idaho Symphony Orchestra, Idaho Falls Symphony Orchestra, Coeur d&#x27;Alene Symphony Orchestra (founded in 1981), Idaho State Civic Symphony, Magic Valley Symphony and a Washington Idaho Symphony. The Idaho State Civic Symphony is the oldest in the state, having been founded in the early 1900s. The Treefort Music Fest, founded in 2014, many independent bands from the area, in addition to attracting established acts from outside Boise.

Notably, every year the University of Idaho holds the annual Lionel Hampton International Jazz Festival, in which schools from all over the world, as well as famous musicians, come to celebrate Jazz as an art form. A similar event is held at Boise State University, called the Gene Harris Jazz Festival.

Major music venues include the L.E. and Thelma E. Stephens Performing Arts Center at Idaho State University in Pocatello.

Small and large venues exist throughout downtown Boise, though the former consists of mostly bars and coffee shops, and the larger remain concert halls and arenas. Perhaps the most popular concert house is the Knitting Factory (formerly the Big Easy), as well as The Olympic, which caters to the alternative, indie, and metal music. Although many famous artists and musicians play in Boise, many acts pass up Boise in favor of venues in Salt Lake City, Seattle, or Portland, Oregon.

Idaho Falls is home to a small number of venues.

Rexburg, Idaho also has a budding local music scene, with many of the bands being formed by students at Brigham Young University–Idaho.

<doc id="1000429" wikidata="Q2480413" url="?curid=1000429" title="Phallic stage">
<text>In Freudian psychoanalysis, the phallic stage is the third stage of psychosexual development, spanning the ages of three to six years, wherein the infant&#x27;s libido (desire) centers upon their genitalia as the erogenous zone. When children become aware of their bodies, the bodies of other children, and the bodies of their parents, they gratify physical curiosity by undressing and exploring each other and their genitals, the center of the phallic stage, in the course of which they learn the physical differences between the male and female sexes and their associated social roles, experiences which alter the psychologic dynamics of the parent and child relationship. The phallic stage is the third of five Freudian psychosexual development stages: (i) the oral, (ii) the anal, (iii) the phallic, (iv) the latent, and (v) the genital.

==The Oedipus complex==
In the phallic stage of psychosexual development, a boy&#x27;s decisive experience is the Oedipus complex describing his son–father competition for sexual possession of his mother. This psychological complex indirectly derives its name from the Greek mythologic character Oedipus, who unwittingly killed his father and sexually possessed his mother. Initially, Freud applied the Oedipus complex to the development of boys and girls alike; he then developed the female aspect of phallic-stage psychosexual development as the feminine Oedipus attitude and the negative Oedipus complex. His student–collaborator Carl Jung proposed the &quot;Electra complex&quot;, derived from Greek mythologic character Electra, who plotted matricidal revenge against her mother for the murder of her father, to describe a girl&#x27;s psychosexual competition with her mother for possession of her father.

Despite the mother being the parent who primarily gratifies the child&#x27;s desires, the child begins forming a discrete sexual identity — &quot;boy&quot;, &quot;girl&quot; — that alters the dynamics of the parent and child relationship; the parents become the focus of infantile libidinal energy. The boy focuses his libido (sexual desire) upon his mother, and focuses jealousy and emotional rivalry against his father — because it is he who sleeps with the mother. To facilitate uniting him with the mother, the boy&#x27;s id wants to kill his father (as did Oedipus), but the ego, pragmatically based upon the reality principle, knows that his father is the stronger of the two males competing to psychosexually possess the one female. Nonetheless, the fearful boy remains ambivalent about his father&#x27;s place in the family, which is manifested as fear of castration by the physically greater father; the fear is an irrational, subconscious manifestation of the infantile id.

In developing a discrete psychosexual identity, boys develop castration anxiety and girls develop penis envy towards all males. The girl&#x27;s envy is rooted in the biologic fact that, without a penis, she cannot sexually possess her mother as the infantile id demands. Resultantly, the girl redirects her desire for sexual union upon father. She thus psychosexually progresses to heterosexual femininity (which culminates in bearing a child) derived from earlier, infantile desires; her child replaces the absent penis. Moreover, after the phallic stage, the girl&#x27;s psychosexual development includes transferring her primary erogenous zone from the infantile clitoris to the adult vagina. Freud thus considered a girl&#x27;s Oedipal conflict to be more emotionally intense than that of a boy, resulting, potentially, in a woman of submissive, less confident personality.

==Defense mechanisms==
In both sexes, defense mechanisms provide transitory resolutions of the conflict between the drives of the Id and the drives of the Ego. The first defense mechanism is repression, the blocking of memories, emotional impulses, and ideas from the conscious mind; yet it does not resolve the id–ego conflict. The second defense mechanism is identification, by which the child incorporates, to his or her ego, the personality characteristics of the same-sex parent; in so adapting, the boy diminishes his castration anxiety, because likeness to father protects him from father&#x27;s wrath as a rival for mother; by so adapting, the girl facilitates identifying with mother, who understands that, in being females, neither of them possesses a penis, and thus are not antagonists.

An unresolved fixation in the phallic stage could lead to egoism, low self esteem, flirtatious and promiscuous females, shyness, worthlessness and men that treat women with contempt.

<doc id="1000432" wikidata="Q535932" url="?curid=1000432" title="Mohammad-Hossein Shahriar">
<text>Seyyed Mohammad-Hossein Behjat Tabrizi (January 2, 1906 – September 18, 1988), known by his pen name Shahriar, was an Iranian poet who composed works in both Azerbaijani and Persian.
His most important work, &quot;Heydar Babaya Salam&quot;, is considered to be the pinnacle in Azerbaijani literature which gained great popularity in the Turkic world and was translated to more than 30 languages.

Contrary to many other figures of his time, Shahriar barely involved himself with political problems and ideologies. He was, however, known for his avid nationalism; in his work, numerous metaphors commending Persepolis, Zoroaster and Ferdowsi are made. Many of his writings were also motived by his religious beliefs, and he composed very popular poems in praise of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the first Imam of Shia Islam.

==Biography==
Mohammad Hossein Shahriar was one of the first Azerbaijanis of Iran to write a significant collection of poetry in the Azerbaijani language. Born in 1906 in Tabriz, he received his elementary education, including the Divan of Hafez, under his father&#x27;s supervision. Shahriar’s first formal education was at the Motahhari (former Mansoor High School) Secondary School in Tabriz. He subsequently studied at the Dar-ol-Fonoun (former higher education school) in Tehran. Although he studied medicine in college, he dropped out just before getting his diploma and went to Khorasan, where he found a job as a notary public and bank clerk. He returned to Tehran in 1935 and started working in the Agricultural Bank of Iran.

During the 1945–1946 Soviet occupation of Iranian Azerbaijan and ascendancy of the separatist Azerbaijani Democratic Party, Shahriar composed poems in glorification of Iran&#x27;s national unity. 

He received an honorary professorship from the University of Tabriz in literature in 1967.

He initially published his poems under his given name, Behjat, but later chose the name Shahriar. He published his first book of poems in 1929. His poems were mainly influenced by Hafez, a famous Persian poet, and Khasta Qasim, an old Azerbaijani poet.

His most famous work in Azerbaijani is Heydar Babaya Salam, published in 1954, which won immense popularity and has been translated into more than 30 languages and numerous plays all over the world.

==Works==

The poet began by composing tragic poetry. Many of his bittersweet memories are reflected in his books Hazyan-e Del, Heydar Baba, and Mumiyai. Heydar Baba, composed in Azeri and later translated into Persian, was for a long time on the top ten best-seller list in Tehran. Heydar Baba is the name of a mountain where the poet spent his childhood. He also wrote a book of epic poems, Takht-e Jamshid.

He was interested in humanistic issues and in his poem &quot;A letter to Einstein&quot; he criticized the result of his scientific work that was abused as the nuclear weapon.

Shahriar was a critic of the usage of the Latin alphabet for Turkic languages, writing a poem on the topic called () in 1986. In the poem, he called the the script of the Qur&#x27;an, while calling the and Latin alphabets the scripts of Satan, calling on Turkic-speakers to reject the usage of the latter. He also declared in it that Iran is in a similar situation to the Battle of Karbala, referring to the then-ongoing Iran-Iraq War, and called Turkic-speaking Muslims to jihad. The poem was broadcast via Radio to both the Soviet Union and Turkey, with Shahriar reciting it in both Istanbul Turkish and Azerbaijani in two separate recordings that were disseminated.

Shahriar’s verse takes diverse forms, including lyrics, quatrains, couplets, odes, and elegies. One of his love poems, Hala Chera, was set to music by Rouhollah Khaleghi. The composition for orchestra and solo voice became one of his most well-known works. One of the major reasons for the success of Shahriar’s work is the sincerity of his words. Since he uses colloquial language in the context of poetry, his poems are understandable and effective for a broad segment of the public.

Shahriar was a talented calligrapher who wrote his own copy of the Qur&#x27;an, played the setar very well, and had a keen interest in music. He was a very close friend of the Persian musician and highly respected teacher, Abdolhossein Saba. 

==Death==

His day of death is named the &quot;national day of poem&quot; in Iran.
A television series about his life, directed by Kamal Tabrizi, aired on IRIB channel 2.

He died on 18 September 1988 in one of the Tehran&#x27;s hospitals and his body was transferred to Tabriz and was buried in Maqbarato&#x27;sh-Sho&#x27;ara (Tombs of Poets).

<text>An artificial chemistry is a chemical-like system that usually consists of objects, called molecules, that interact according to rules resembling chemical reaction rules. Artificial chemistries are created and studied in order to understand fundamental properties of chemical systems, including prebiotic evolution, as well as for developing chemical computing systems. Artificial chemistry is a field within computer science wherein chemical reactions—often biochemical ones—are computer-simulated, yielding insights on evolution, self-assembly, and other biochemical phenomena. The field does not use actual chemicals, and should not be confused with either synthetic chemistry or computational chemistry. Rather, bits of information are used to represent the starting molecules, and the end products are examined along with the processes that led to them. The field originated in artificial life but has shown to be a versatile method with applications in many fields such as chemistry, economics, sociology and linguistics.

==Formal definition==
An artificial chemistry is defined in general as a triple . In some cases it is sufficient to define it as a tuple .

* is the set of possible molecules where is the number of elements in the set, possibly infinite.
* is a set of n-ary operations on the molecules in , the reaction rules Each rule is written like a chemical reaction, e.g. . Note here that are operators, as opposed to .
* is an algorithm describing how to apply the rules to a subset .
* are the interaction rules of the molecules in .

==Types of artificial chemistries==

* depending on the space of possible molecules
** finite
** infinite
* depending on the type of reactions
** catalytic systems
** reactive systems
** inhibitive systems
* depending on the space topology
** well stirred reactor
** topologically arranged (1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional)

==Important concepts==
* The field is heavily reliant on mathematics, to include mathematical modeling. It in fact relies more on a mathematics background than a chemistry background.
* Organizations: An organization is a set of molecules that is closed and self-maintaining. As such, it is a set that does not create anything outside itself, and such that any molecule inside the set can be generated within the set.
* Closed sets
* Self-maintaining sets
* Hasse diagram of organizations

==History of artificial chemistries==

Artificial chemistries emerged as a sub-field of artificial life, in particular from strong artificial life. The idea behind this field was that if one wanted to build something alive, it had to be done by a combination of non-living entities. For instance, a cell is itself alive, and yet is a combination of non-living molecules. Artificial chemistry enlists, among others, researchers that believe in an extreme bottom-up approach to artificial life. In artificial life, bits of information were used to represent bacteria or members of a species, each of which moved, multiplied, or died in computer simulations. In artificial chemistry bits of information are used to represent starting molecules capable of reacting with one another. The field has pertained to artificial intelligence by virtue of the fact that, over billions of years, non-living matter evolved into primordial life forms which in turn evolved into intelligent life forms.

==Important contributors==

The first reference about Artificial Chemistries come from a Technical paper written by John McCaskill
Walter Fontana working with Leo Buss then took up the work developing the AlChemy model
The model was presented at the second International Conference of Artificial Life.
In his first papers he presented the concept of organization, as a set of molecules that is algebraically closed and self-maintaining.
This concept was further developed by Dittrich and Speroni di Fenizio into a theory of chemical organizations

Two main schools of artificial chemistries have been in Japan and Germany.
In Japan the main researchers have been Takashi Ikegami

Hideaki Suzuki
and Yasuhiro Suzuki
In Germany, it was Wolfgang Banzhaf, who, together with his students Peter Dittrich and Jens Ziegler, developed various artificial chemistry models.
Their 2001 paper &#x27;Artificial Chemistries - A Review&#x27; became a standard in the field.
Jens Ziegler, as part of his PhD thesis, proved that an artificial chemistry could be used to control a small Khepera robot
Among other models, Peter Dittrich developed the Seceder model which is able to explain group formation in society through some simple rules. Since then he became a professor in Jena where he investigates artificial chemistries as a way to define a general theory of constructive dynamical systems.

==Applications of artificial chemistries==

Artificial Chemistries are often used in the study of protobiology, in trying to bridge the gap between chemistry and biology.
A further motivation to study artificial chemistries is the interest in constructive dynamical systems. Yasuhiro Suzuki has modeled various systems such as membrane systems, signaling pathways (P53), ecosystems, and enzyme systems by using his method, abstract rewriting system on multisets (ARMS).

==Artificial chemistry in popular culture==

In the 1994 science-fiction novel &quot;Permutation City&quot; by Greg Egan, brain-scanned emulated humans known as Copies inhabit a simulated world which includes the Autoverse, an artificial life simulator based on a cellular automaton complex enough to represent the substratum of an artificial chemistry. Tiny environments are simulated in the Autoverse and filled with populations of a simple, designed lifeform, &quot;Autobacterium lamberti&quot;. The purpose of the Autoverse is to allow Copies to explore the life that had evolved there after it had been run on a significantly large segment of the simulated universe (referred to as &quot;Planet Lambert&quot;).

<text>Fluorescein angiography (FA), fluorescent angiography (FAG), or fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) is a technique for examining the circulation of the retina and choroid (parts of the fundus) using a fluorescent dye and a specialized camera. Sodium fluorescein is added into the systemic circulation, the retina is illuminated with blue-green light at a wavelength of 490 nanometers, and an angiogram is obtained by photographing the fluorescent green light that is emitted by the dye. The fluorescein is administered intravenously in intravenous fluorescein angiography (IVFA) and orally in oral fluorescein angiography (OFA). The test is a dye tracing method.

The fluorescein dye also reappears in the patient urine, causing the urine to appear darker, and sometimes orange. It can also cause discolouration of the saliva.

Fluorescein angiography is one of several health care applications of this dye, all of which have a risk of severe adverse effects. See fluorescein safety in health care applications. Fluorescein angiography does not involve the use of ionizing radiation.

Fluorescein angiography was pioneered by German ophthalmologist Achim Wessing, who published his findings in 1969.

==Equipment==
* Exciter filter: Allows only blue light to illuminate the retina. Depending on the specific filter, the excitation wavelength hitting the retina will be between 465 and 490 nm. Most only allow light through at a wavelength of 490 nm.
* Barrier filter: Allows only yellow-green light (from the fluorescence) to reach the camera. Both filters are interference bandpass filters, which means they block out all light except that at a specific wavelength. The barrier filter only allows light with a wavelength of 525 nm, but depending on the filter it can be anywhere from 520 to 530 nm.
* Fundus camera, either digital or with camera body containing black and white, or slide positive film.

==Technique==
* Baseline color and black and white red-free filtered images are taken prior to injection. The black and white images are filtered red-free (a green filter) to increase contrast and often gives a better image of the fundus than the color image.
* A 6-second bolus injection of 2-5 cc of sodium fluorescein into a vein in the retina
* Local injection
* A series of black-and-white or digital photographs are taken of the retina before and after the fluorescein reaches the retinal circulation (approximately 10 seconds after injection). The early images allow for the recognition of autofluorescence of the retinal tissues. Photos are taken approximately once every second for about 20 seconds, then less often. A delayed image is obtained at 5 and 10 minutes. Some doctors like to see a 15-minute image as well.
* A filter is placed in the camera so only the fluorescent, yellow-green light (530 nm) is recorded. The camera may however pick up signals from pseudofluorescence or autofluorescence. In pseudofluorescence, non-fluorescent light is imaged. This occurs when blue light reflected from the retina passes through the filter. This is generally a problem with older filters, and annual replacement of these filters is recommended. In autofluorescence, fluorescence from the eye occurs without injection of the dye. This may be seen with optic nerve head drusen, astrocytic hamartoma, or calcific scarring.
* Black-and-white photos give better contrast than color photos, which aren&#x27;t necessary because the filter transmits only one color of light.

==Normal circulatory filling==
&quot;times are approximate&quot;
* 0 seconds – injection of fluorescein
* 9.5 sec – posterior ciliary arteries
* 10 sec – choroidal flush (or &quot;pre-arterial phase&quot;)
* 10–12 sec – retinal arterial stage
* 13 sec – capillary transition stage
* 14–15 sec – early venous stage (or &quot;laminar stage&quot;, &quot;arterial-venous stage&quot;)
* 16–17 sec – venous stage
* 18–20 sec – late venous stage
* 5 minutes – late staining

Fluorescein enters the ocular circulation from the internal carotid artery via the ophthalmic artery. The ophthalmic artery supplies the choroid via the short posterior ciliary arteries and the retina via the central retinal artery, but the route to the choroid is typically less circuitous than the route to the retina. This accounts for the short delay between the &quot;choroidal flush&quot; and retinal filling.

==Pathologic findings==
Pathologic changes are recognized by the detection of either hyperfluorescence or hypofluorescence.

Causes of hyperfluorescence:
:window/transmission (filling) defects
:leaking defects (i.e. capillary leakage, aneurysm, neovascularization)
:pooling defects
:staining
:abnormal vasculature

Causes of hypofluorescence:
:blocking defect (i.e. blood)
:filling defect (capillary nonperfusion/blockage)

Fluorescein angiography is used by physicians specializing in the treatment of eye diseases (ophthalmologists) to evaluate the vasculature of the retina, choroid, optic disc, and iris. Among the common groups of ophthalmologic disease, fluorescein angiography can detect diabetic retinopathy (neovascularization), vein occlusions, retinal artery occlusions, edema of the optic disc, and tumors. Additionally, the transit time (the period between injection of the dye and when it appears in the examined blood vessels) can provide an objective measurement of the rate of blood flow through the imaged blood vessels.

<doc id="1000449" wikidata="Q1537300" url="?curid=1000449" title="Great Mass in C minor, K. 427">
<text>Great Mass in C minor (), K. 427/417a, is the common name of the musical setting of the mass by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, which is considered one of his greatest works. He composed it in Vienna in 1782 and 1783, after his marriage, when he moved to Vienna from Salzburg. The large-scale work, a missa solemnis, is scored for two soprano soloists, a tenor and a bass, double chorus and large orchestra. It remained unfinished, missing large portions of the Credo and the complete Agnus Dei.

==Composition and first performance==
The work was composed during 1782–83. In a letter to his father Leopold dated 4 January 1783, Mozart mentioned a vow he had made to write a mass when he would bring his then fiancée Constanze as his wife to Salzburg. Constanze then sang the &quot;Et incarnatus est&quot; at its premiere.

The first performance took place in Salzburg on Sunday 26 October 1783 (the twentieth Sunday after Pentecost). Mozart had moved to Vienna in 1781, but was paying a visit to his home town in the company of Constanze, who had not yet met his father or his sister (Nannerl).

The performance consisted of just the Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus and Benedictus, as surviving parts and a score copy from ca. 1800 show. It took place in the Church of St. Peter&#x27;s Abbey in the context of a Roman Catholic mass. Mozart&#x27;s sister&#x27;s diary mentions that the performers were the entire , that is the musicians employed at the court of Salzburg&#x27;s ruler, Prince-Archbishop Count Hieronymus von Colloredo and thus Mozart&#x27;s former colleagues. There was a rehearsal in the nearby Kapellhaus on 23 October 1783.

==Fragmentary status==
The work is incomplete, missing the Credo movements following the aria Et incarnatus est (the orchestration of the only two surviving &quot;Credo&quot; movements being incomplete) and all of the Agnus Dei. The Sanctus and the Benedictus are partially lost and require editorial reconstructions. There is a good deal of speculation concerning why the work was left unfinished. For purposes of modern performances, the editions and completions available are as follows:
* (1901, Breitkopf &amp; Härtel)
* H. C. Robbins Landon (1956, Eulenburg),
* Helmut Eder (1985, Bärenreiter)
* Franz Beyer (1989, Amadeus/Edition Peters)
* Richard Maunder (1990, Oxford University Press/Carus-Verlag),
* Philip Wilby (2004, Novello)
* Robert Levin (2005, Carus-Verlag)
* Clemens Kemme (2018, Breitkopf &amp; Härtel)
* Ulrich Leisinger (2019, Bärenreiter).

The editions by Landon, Eder, Beyer, Maunder and Kemme aim to simply fill out the missing orchestrations and choral parts in the Credo and Sanctus, whereas the editions by Schmitt, Wilby and Levin aim to complete the work by either using movements from other masses or composing new music for the Credo and Agnus Dei through the use of parody or elaboration of period sketches by Mozart. Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs (Musikproduktion Höflich) just offers a complete Credo and an Agnus Dei. For the Credo this means a completions of the &#x27;Credo in unum Deum&#x27; and the &#x27;Et incarnatus est&#x27; and additional music for the rest of the Credo. This edition, therefore, is intended to be used in combination with any other version of the Mass. Robert Xavier Rodriguez has also completed the Agnus Dei.

Mozart later reused the music from the &quot;Kyrie&quot; and &quot;Gloria&quot;, almost without changes except for the text, in the cantata &quot;Davide penitente&quot;, K. 469. For the cantata Mozart added two new arias and a cadenza for the fugue concluding the work.

==Structure==


The orchestra consists of 1 flute (only used in the Et incarnatus est), 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, organ, and strings.

==Influence==

The work embodies pomp and solemnity associated with the Salzburg traditions of the time, but it also anticipates the symphonic masses of Joseph Haydn in its solo-choral sharing. The mass shows the influence of Bach and Handel, whose music Mozart was studying at this time (see Gottfried van Swieten).

On 20 August 2016 the version reconstructed by Helmut Eder was performed at the Royal Albert Hall, for the first time as part of The Proms series, by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and BBC Symphony Chorus, with Ilan Volkov conducting and featuring Louise Alder, Carolyn Sampson, Benjamin Hulett and Matthew Rose.

<text>Johann Heinrich von Thünen (24 June 1783 – 22 September 1850), sometimes spelled Thuenen, was a prominent nineteenth-century economist and a native of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, now in northern Germany.

Even though he never held a professorial position, von Thunen had substantial influence on economics. He has been described as one of the founders of agricultural economics and economic geography. He made substantial contributions to economic debates on rent, land use, and wages.

==Early life==
Von Thunen was born on 24 June 1783 on his father&#x27;s estate, Canarienhausen. His father was from an old feudal family. Von Thunen lost his father at the age of two. His mother remarried a merchant and the family moved to Hooksiel.

Von Thunen expected to take over his father&#x27;s estate, which led him to study practical farming. In 1803, von Thunen published his first economic ideas.

Von Thunen was influenced by Albrecht Thaer.

Von Thunen married in 1806.

==Work==
===Model of agricultural land use===

Thünen was a Mecklenburg landowner, who in the first volume of his treatise &quot;The Isolated State&quot; (1826), developed the first serious treatment of spatial economics and economic geography, connecting it with the theory of rent. The importance lies less in the pattern of land use predicted than in its analytical approach.

Thünen developed the basics of the theory of marginal productivity in a mathematically rigorous way, summarizing it in the formula in which
:formula_1

where R = land rent; Y = yield per unit of land; c = production expenses per unit of commodity; p=market price per unit of commodity; F = freight rate (per agricultural unit, per mile); m=distance to market.

Thünen&#x27;s model of agricultural land, created before industrialization, made the following simplifying assumptions:
* The city is located centrally within an &quot;Isolated State.&quot;
* The Isolated State is surrounded by wilderness.
* The land is completely flat and has no rivers or mountains.
* Soil quality and climate are consistent.
* Farmers in the Isolated State transport their own goods to market via oxcart, across land, directly to the central city. There are no roads.
* Farmers behave rationally to maximize profits.

The use which a piece of land is put to is a function of the cost of transport to market and the land rent a farmer can afford to pay (determined by yield, which is held constant here).

The model generated four concentric rings of agricultural activity. Dairying and intensive farming lies closest to the city. Since vegetables, fruit, milk and other dairy products must get to market quickly, they would be produced close to the city.

Timber and firewood would be produced for fuel and building materials in the second ring. Wood was a very important fuel for heating and cooking and is very heavy and difficult to transport so it is located close to the city.

The third zone consists of extensive fields crops such as grain. Since grains last longer than dairy products and are much lighter than fuel, reducing transport costs, they can be located further from the city.

Ranching is located in the final ring. Animals can be raised far from the city because they are self-transporting. Animals can walk to the central city for sale or for butchering.

Beyond the fourth ring lies the wilderness, which is too great a distance from the central city for any type of agricultural product.

Thünen&#x27;s rings proved especially useful to economic history, such as Fernand Braudel&#x27;s &quot;Civilization and Capitalism,&quot; untangling the economic history of Europe and European colonialism before the Industrial Revolution blurred the patterns on the ground.

In economics, Thünen rent is an economic rent created by spatial variation or location of a resource. It is &quot;that which can be earned &quot;above&quot; that which can be earned at the margin of production&quot;.

=== Natural wage ===
In the second volume of his great work &quot;The Isolated State&quot;, Thunen developed some of the mathematical foundations of marginal productivity theory and wrote about the Natural Wage indicated by the formula , in which equals the value of the product of labor and capital, and equals the subsistence of the laborer and their family. The idea he presented is that a surplus will arise on the earlier units of an investment of either capital or labor, but as time goes on the diminishing return of newer investments will mean that if wages vary with the level of productivity those that are early will receive a greater reward for their labor and capital. But if wage rates were determined using his formula, thus giving labor a share that will vary as a geometric mean: the square root of the joint product of the two factors, and .

This formula was so important to him that it was a dying wish of his that it be placed on his tombstone.

In &quot;The Isolated State&quot;, he also coined the term &quot;Grenzkosten&quot; (marginal cost) which would later be popularized by Alfred Marshall in his &quot;Principles of Economics&quot;.

<text>Edward Thomas Adams (June 12, 1933 – September 19, 2004) was an American photographer and photojournalist noted for portraits of celebrities and politicians and for coverage of 13 wars. He is best known for his photograph of the execution of Nguyễn Văn Lém, a Viet Cong prisoner of war, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography in 1969. Adams was a longtime resident of Bogota, New Jersey.

== Early life ==
Edward Thomas Adams was born on June 12, 1933, in New Kensington, Pennsylvania.

==Career==
=== Early ===
Adams joined the United States Marine Corps in 1951, during the Korean War as a combat photographer. One of his assignments was to photograph the entire Demilitarized Zone from end to end immediately following the war. This took him more than a month to complete.

===Pulitzer Prize–winning photograph===
It was while covering the Vietnam War for the Associated Press that he took his best-known photograph—that of police chief General Nguyễn Ngọc Loan, summarily executing Nguyễn Văn Lém, a Vietcong prisoner of war. This occurred on a Saigon street on February 1, 1968, during the early part of the Tet Offensive.

Adams won the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography and a World Press Photo award for the photograph. Writer and critic David D. Perlmutter states that &quot;no film footage did as much damage as AP photographer Eddie Adams&#x27;s 35mm shot taken on a Saigon street ... When people talk or write about [the Tet Offensive] at least a sentence is devoted (often with an illustration) to the Eddie Adams picture&quot;.

Anticipating the effect of Adams&#x27;s photograph, an attempt at balance was sought by editors at &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In his memoirs, John G. Morris recalls that assistant managing editor Theodore M. Bernstein &quot;determined that the brutality manifested by America&#x27;s ally be put into perspective, agreed to run the Adams picture large, but offset with a picture of a child slain by Vietcong, which conveniently came through from AP at about the same time.&quot; Adams&#x27; picture, however, retained a more lasting infamy. Max Hastings, writing in 2018, accused Lém of murdering Colonel Nguyen Tuân, his wife, six children, and 80-year-old mother; he also wrote that American historian Ed Moise &quot;is convinced that the entire story of Lém murdering the Tuân family is a post-war invention&quot; and that &quot;The truth will never be known&quot;.

In &quot;Regarding the Pain of Others&quot; (2003), Susan Sontag was disturbed by what she saw as Loan&#x27;s staging of the execution in the street for journalists&#x27; photographs. She wrote that &quot;he would not have carried out the summary execution there had they [journalists] not been available to witness it&quot; and positioned himself in profile view with the prisoner facing the cameras. However, Donald Winslow of &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted Adams as having described the image as a &quot;reflex picture&quot; and &quot;wasn&#x27;t certain of what he&#x27;d photographed until the film was developed&quot;. Furthermore, Winslow noted that Adams &quot;wanted me to understand that &#x27;Saigon Execution&#x27; was not his most important picture and that he did not want his obituary to begin, &#x27;Eddie Adams, the photographer best known for his iconic Vietnam photograph &quot;Saigon Execution.

Adams would later lament the effect of the photo. On Loan and his photograph, Adams wrote in &quot;Time&quot; in 1998:

Loan later relocated to the United States, and in 1978, there was an unsuccessful attempt to rescind his permanent residence status (green card). Adams advocated for Loan when the U.S. government sought to deport him based on the photograph, and apologized in person to Loan and his family for the irreparable damage it did to his honor while he was alive. When Loan died, Adams praised him as a &quot;hero&quot; of a &quot;just cause&quot;. On the television show &quot;War Stories with Oliver North&quot; Adams referred to Loan as &quot;a goddamned hero!&quot;

He once said, &quot;I would have rather been known more for the series of photographs I shot of 48 Vietnamese refugees who managed to sail to Thailand in a 30-foot boat, only to be towed back to the open seas by Thai marines.&quot; The photographs, and accompanying reports, helped persuade then President Jimmy Carter to grant asylum to the nearly 200,000 Vietnamese boat people. He won the Robert Capa Gold Medal from the Overseas Press Club in 1977 for this series of photographs in his photo-essay, &quot;&quot; (published by AP). Adams remarked, &quot;It did some good and nobody got hurt&quot;.

On October 22, 2009, Swann Galleries auctioned a print of Adams&#x27; photo of Loan and Lém. Printed during the 1980s, it had been a gift to Adams&#x27;s son. It sold for $43,200.

The sole survivor of Lém&#x27;s alleged killing of Tuan&#x27;s family was Huan Nguyen; aged nine at the time, he was shot twice during the attack that killed his family and stayed with his mother for two hours as she bled to death. In 2019, he became the highest ranking Vietnamese American officer in the U.S. military when he was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in the United States Navy.

=== Later ===
Adams started a photojournalism workshop, The Eddie Adams Workshop (also known as the Barnstorm) in 1988. It reached its thirtieth year in 2017.

===Awards===
Along with the Pulitzer, Adams received more than 500 awards, including the George Polk Award for News Photography in 1968, 1977 and 1978, World Press Photo awards on 14 occasions, and numerous awards from the National Press Photographers Association, Sigma Delta Chi, Overseas Press Club, and many other organizations.

==Personal life==
Adams was first married to Ann Fedorchak, with whom he had one son and two daughters. After the couple divorced, he married Alyssa Adkins in 1989; they had one son.

On September 19, 2004, Adams died in New York City at age 71 from complications of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

In 2009, his widow donated his photographic archive to the University of Texas at Austin.

<text>Samuel Hardy (June 10, 1758 – October 17, 1785) was an American lawyer, planter and politician, who served as a delegate to the Continental Congress and in the Virginia House of Delegates representing Isle of Wight County, as well as briefly on Virginia&#x27;s Executive Council and as Lieutenant Governor of Virginia.

==Early and family life==
Born in Isle of Wight County, Virginia, to planter Richard Hardy (who served two terms in the House of Burgesses) and his wife, Samuel received a private education suitable to his class, including studies at Virginia&#x27;s College of William and Mary to the extent it was open during the American Revolutionary War 1776-1781 time period and he was not serving in the legislature. His grandfather, George Hardy (or Harddie) had emigrated from England, established the family&#x27;s plantations and represented Isle of Wight county several times in the decade beginning in 1642. Samuel married and was survived by his widow and at least sons Thomas and William who served as his executors.

==Career==
Following admission to the Virginia bar on October 1, 1778, Hardy began a law practice. Two days later, voters in Isle of Wight county first chose him to represent them to complete the term of Major Josiah Parker, who was leading Virginia troops with the Continental Army and had been disqualified by the Virginia House of Delegates in the term&#x27;s first session, but who subsequently won re-election to serve alongside John Scarsbrook Wills, as did Hardy for three consecutive one-year terms (1780-1782). In June 1781 Hardy began his brief service on Virginia&#x27;s Executive Council, and from May 29 to October 11, 1782, served as Lieutenant Governor of Virginia.

Elected to the Continental Congress from Virginia, Hardy served from 1783 until 1785. On May 6, 1784, he voted against the resolution in the Congress restricting the salary of a foreign minister of the United States to $8,000, and on May 7 opposed the motion that the salary of a United States Secretary for Foreign Affairs should not exceed $3,000 per annum. In May 1784, Hardy nominated Thomas Jefferson as minister plenipotentiary to Europe to assist John Adams and Benjamin Franklin in negotiating treaties of commerce; and in January 1785, was a member of a committee that reported on letters that had been received from United States ministers in Europe relative to a foreign loan.

==Death and legacy==

Hardy died in New York City, New York while Congress was in session (then meeting in New York City), and is buried in St. Paul&#x27;s Church Cemetery. His death and funeral were reported in many newspapers at that time. One newspaper was The Freeman&#x27;s Journal of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on October 26, 1785, on pages 2 and 3. The entire Congress and many dignitaries attended his funeral at St. Paul&#x27;s Church. Archivist at Trinity Church have not been able to locate Hardy&#x27;s grave marker or records of his funeral yet in their files but agree the newspaper story implies the funeral did occur and he is buried there but records of that time may be incomplete. They have records that Rev. Beach and Rev. Provost, who gave the sermons according to the article, were there at that time but cannot locate a copy of the specific sermons.

Hardy was a friend of Alexander Hamilton, who may have written a poetical tribute to his memory in the article, although the authorship is in dispute.

The Virginia General Assembly named Hardy County (in what became West Virginia during the American Civil War) in his honor. His son William Hardy continued the family political tradition by representing Isle of Wight county in the 1793 and 1794 terms Their relation to a young lieutenant Samuel Hardy who fought with the 18th Virginia Infantry during the Civil War until losing his arm following a wound during the Battle of Gaines Mill in 1862 is unclear.

<text>The Maui Space Surveillance Complex (MSSC) is a U.S. Space Force operating location for the 15th Space Surveillance Squadron and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Haleakala Observatory on Maui, Hawaii, with a twofold mission (). First, it conducts the research and development mission on the Maui Space Surveillance System (MSSS) at the MSSC. Second, it oversees operation of the Maui High Performance Computing Center (MHPCC). AFRL&#x27;s research and development mission on Maui was formally called Air Force Maui Optical Station (AMOS) and the Air Force Maui Optical and Supercomputing observatory; the use of the term AMOS has been widespread throughout the technical community for over thirty years and is still used today at many technical conferences. The main-belt asteroid 8721 AMOS is named after the project.

== Origins ==

The MSSS was first envisioned as an optical research observatory in the early 1950s. It was initiated by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in 1961 as the ARPA Midcourse Optical Station (AMOS). It was first proposed by R. Zirkind of ARPA&#x27;s staff for imaging ballistic missile payloads and decoys during their midcourse phase, and other space objects including satellites, in the infrared spectrum, as well as for performing astronomical research. Its location on Mount Haleakala was nearly ideal for its altitude high above much obscuration by water vapor, for its midcourse location between the missile launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base and its main reentry location at Kwajalein Atoll, and for its low-latitude location which was advantageous for observing satellites.

The AMOS effort formally began with an amendment to an existing ARPA order with the University of Michigan&#x27;s Institute for Science and Technology, which was to design, construct, and operate the facility. This amendment defined the AMOS goals as follows: &quot;(1) Identification and signature of space objects; (2) an active program to advance the state of the art in infrared technology and high-resolution imagery; (3) a research program in geophysics and astrophysics including the astronomical community.&quot; Design was completed in 1963, and physical plant construction begun by the Army Corps of Engineers. Construction was complete by 1967, after which the telescopes and control systems were evaluated, calibrated, and tested until mid 1969.

In 1969, AMOS potential had been demonstrated, and the Air Force took charge as ARPA&#x27;s agent. The University of Michigan was replaced by industrial contractors, and numerous system improvements and additions then took place over subsequent years. In 1984, DARPA transferred it to the Air Force, which renamed it as MSSS in 1995.

== Maui Space Surveillance System (MSSS) ==

The accessibility and capability of the Maui Space Surveillance System provides an unequaled opportunity to the scientific community by combining state-of-the-art satellite tracking with a facility supporting research and development.

The Maui Space Surveillance System, is routinely involved in numerous observing programs and has the capability of projecting lasers into the atmosphere. Situated at the crest of the dormant volcano Haleakala (IAU code 608), the observatory stands at an altitude of 3058 metres, latitude 20.7 degrees N, and longitude 156.3 degrees W. It is essentially co-located with IAU code 566, Haleakala-NEAT/GEODSS. Virtually year-round viewing conditions are possible due to the relatively stable climate. Dry, clean air and minimal scattered light from surface sources enable visibility exceeding 150 km. Based on double star observations, seeing is typically on the order of one second of arc.

Spanning over 30 years, the evolution of the Maui Space Surveillance System has demonstrated several stages in the history of space object tracking telescopes. Currently, through its primary mission for the United States Space Force, Space Operations Command, (formerly, Air Force Space Command), the Maui Space Surveillance System combines large-aperture tracking optics with visible and infrared sensors to collect data on near Earth and deep-space objects. In the process of accomplishing its mission, the observatory has discovered a number of asteroids &quot;(see )&quot;

=== Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS) ===
The 3.67-meter telescope, known as the Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS), owned by the Department of Defense, is the United States&#x27; largest optical telescope designed for tracking satellites. The 75-ton AEOS telescope points and tracks very accurately, yet is fast enough to track both low-Earth satellites and ballistic missiles. AEOS can be used simultaneously by many groups or institutions because its light can be channeled through a series of mirrors to seven independent Coudé focus rooms below the telescope. Employing sophisticated sensors that include an adaptive optics system, radiometer, spectrograph, and long-wave infrared imager, the telescope tracks man-made objects in deep space and performs space object identification data collection.

AEOS is equipped with an adaptive optics system, the heart of which is a 941-actuator deformable mirror that can change its shape to remove the atmosphere&#x27;s distorting effects. Scientists are expected to get near diffraction-limited images of space objects.

=== Maui Optical Tracking and Identification Facility (MOTIF) ===

The Maui Optical Tracking and Identification Facility (MOTIF) is also hosted at the MSSS site. The system consists of two 1.2-meter telescopes on a common mount. MOTIF is used primarily for Long Wave infrared (LWIR) and photometric data collection.

Other equipment at MSSS includes a 1.6-meter telescope that performs day and night tracking and imaging, a 0.8-meter beam director/tracker, and a 0.6-meter laser beam director. The telescopes accommodate a wide variety of sensor systems, including imaging systems, conventional and contrast mode photometers, infrared radiometers, low light level video systems, and acquisition telescopes.

=== Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) ===

The MSSS site, also hosts assets for the Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) system.

In addition to these assets, the site has a machine shop, optics laboratories, and electronics laboratories. A Remote Maui Experimental (RME) site at sea level houses additional optics and electronics laboratories. This secondary observation station at Kihei bears IAU code 625 and is located at .

== Maui High Performance Computing Center (MHPCC) ==

The Maui High Performance Computing Center (MHPCC) is an Air Force Research Laboratory center currently managed by the University of Hawaii and is located in the Maui Research and Technology Park in Kihei. The MHPCC is a leading computing resource of the Department of Defense research and development community and operates numerous computer clusters, including a 5,120 processor Dell Poweredge cluster named &quot;Jaws&quot; which, as of November 2006, was the 11th most powerful computing systems in the world. The Center also has a 12,096 core IBM iDataplex Cluster, named &quot;Riptide&quot; which as November 2013 attained a peak performance Linpack performance of 212 Teraflops and ranked #192 on the Top500 in November 2013.

<doc id="1000468" wikidata="Q1426524" url="?curid=1000468" title="Upper Deck Company">
<text>The Upper Deck Company, LLC (colloquially as Upper Deck and Upper Deck Authenticated, Ltd. in the UK) is a private company primarily known for producing trading cards. It was founded in 1988. Its headquarters are in Carlsbad, California, United States.

The company also produces sports related items such as figurines and die-cast toys on top of having exclusive agreements to produce memorabilia, under the brand name &quot;Upper Deck Authenticated&quot;, with athletes including Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, LeBron James, Wayne Gretzky, Serena Williams, Roberto Luongo, Connor McDavid, and Ben Simmons . Under the Upper Deck Entertainment name, the company also produced card games such as &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; and &quot;Vs. System&quot;.

Upper Deck is also the current licensor of the O-Pee-Chee brand since 2007, having released several baseball and ice hockey card collections.

==Company history==
On December 23, 1988, Upper Deck was granted a license by Major League Baseball to produce baseball cards, and just two months later, on February 23, 1989, delivered its first two cases of baseball cards to George Moore of Tulsa&#x27;s Baseball Card Store in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Its inaugural 1989 set stood out from other trading cards with its glossy fronts on heavy-duty cardboard (thicker than other card stocks), with an additional color photo on the back of each card and a counterfeit-proof tiny hologram marking. Upper Deck sold out its baseball cards midway through this inaugural year, then pre-sold its entire 1990 baseball stock before the year began.

The 1990 set included the industry&#x27;s first randomly inserted personally autographed and numbered cards of sports stars. All Upper Deck brands bear an exclusive trademark hologram, and Upper Deck was named &quot;Card Set of the Year&quot; every year from 1989 to 2004.

Paul Sumner created the Upper Deck concept in 1987. He worked in printing sales and came up with the idea for a premium card. When he heard about card counterfeiting, he realized that he knew a way to protect cards. He had studied holograms in college and had used them in printing his company&#x27;s brochures. He hired Robert Young Pelton to design and produce a prototype. Pelton designed and produced the cards for Upper Decks first three-year rise. Pelton&#x27;s agencies, Pelton &amp; Associates and Digital Artists, were replaced by Chiat/Day. Paul Sumner resigned with the understanding that he would be known as the &quot;Co-Founder of Upper Deck,&quot; something that the company&#x27;s owner and CEO, Richard McWilliam, recognized until McWilliam&#x27;s death in 2013.

On March 20, 1990, Upper Deck received licenses from the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players Association to produce hockey cards. The company also obtained licenses from the National Football League and the National Basketball Association in 1990, making Upper Deck the first trading card company in 10 years to be licensed by all four leagues. Upper Deck quickly rivaled Topps, which had been considered the standard, and other competitors, such as Fleer, Donruss, and Score. By 1991, the company built a plant of brown marble and black glass on a hilltop north of San Diego.

After Upper Deck introduced its premium baseball series, other companies followed with improved photography, better design, and higher-quality paper stock. The sports card market grew from $50 million in 1980 when Topps&#x27; monopoly was broken by Fleer, to a $1.5 billion industry in 1992. Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson served as an adviser in the early 1990s. Jackson would also serve as the inspiration for the first certified autograph card inserted into trading cards with the company&#x27;s &quot;Find the Reggie&quot; campaign. A massively successful promotion for the Upper Deck brand, the triple portrait of Jackson, remains an iconic image among baseball card collectors.

At the beginning of the 1992–93 NHL season, Upper Deck made Patrick Roy a spokesperson. Roy was a hockey card collector, with more than 150,000 cards. An ad campaign was launched and it had an adverse effect on Patrick Roy&#x27;s season. Upper Deck had a slogan called &quot;Trade Roy&quot;, and it was posted on billboards throughout the city of Montreal. A &quot;Journal de Montreal&quot; poll, published on January 13, 1993, indicated that 57% of fans favoured trading Patrick Roy. Before the trade deadline, Canadiens general manager Serge Savard insisted that he would consider a trade for Roy. The Canadiens ended the season by winning only 8 of their last 19 games.

Upper Deck was also the first to insert swatches of game-used material into cards when it made jersey cards in 1997 UD Basketball. The insert set was called Game Jersey and a similar set followed in baseball the next year, where UD cut up game-used jerseys of Ken Griffey Jr., Tony Gwynn, and Rey Ordóñez.

In 1999, Upper Deck Company spent in excess of $1.1 million in acquiring vintage baseball memorabilia items at the Barry Halper Collection auction held at Sotheby&#x27;s in New York City. One of the items was a Ty Cobb jersey that Upper Deck paid $332,500 for. As part of a sweepstakes prize, it gave the jersey to 14-year-old Robert Shell of Milwaukee. At the time, the estimated tax Robert was going to pay on the prize was $125,000. The amount, his mother said, would force the family to sell the jersey.
In May 2005, Richard McWilliam was name the sports collectible industry&#x27;s &quot;most influential&quot; person of the past 20 years at an annual trade convention in Hawaii. In addition to McWilliam&#x27;s award, Upper Deck was also recognized for the debut of its legendary 1989 baseball trading card set, which included the then 19-year-old centerfielder Ken Griffey Jr., as the &quot;most influential&quot; event of the past 20 years. The list of nominees was created and voted upon by the staff of conference organizers F+W Publications.

In July 2005, Upper Deck won the liquidation auction of former competitor Fleer-SkyBox International&#x27;s brand name, assets, and business model, as well as the Fleer collectibles die-cast business assets. In March 2007, Upper Deck made an offer to buy competitor Topps, competing with Madison Dearborn Partners and Tornante Company, the eventual buyer.

Upper Deck originally included the year of the trading card set&#x27;s release on its logo, with the &quot;19&quot; above &quot;Upper&quot; and the last two digits of the year under &quot;Deck&quot; (but both inside the green diamond). This practice was dropped midway through the 1994 season. In 2008, Upper Deck retired the green diamond logo and replaced it with a new design that it could better use to market all of its products.

In 2009, Upper Deck introduced the Diamond Club. Diamond Club members consist of the top individual purchasers and collectors of Upper Deck and Fleer brands throughout the United States, Canada and Japan. The criteria were that the members distinguished themselves not only by the amount of money they spent, but by how they helped to promote these products within the hobby and to other collectors. Diamond Club members receive special promotional items, receive invitations to special events and are invited to an annual summit where they can share ideas with members of Upper Deck while participating in a special reception with one of the company&#x27;s spokesmen. Fewer than 125 members are chosen to be a part of the program each year.

On August 6, 2009, Major League Baseball announced it entered into a multi-year deal with Topps giving it exclusive rights to produce MLB trading cards. Upper Deck would retain its rights to produce cards bearing player likenesses via its contract with the MLBPA but will be unable to use team logos or other trademarked images. On February 1, 2010, Major League Baseball filed a federal lawsuit against Upper Deck for trademark infringement. A mutual settlement was announced on March 3, 2010, stating that Upper Deck could continue selling its three current baseball card series (2009 Signature Stars, 2009 Ultimate Collection and 2010 Upper Deck Series One), although they were prohibited from using any MLB trademarks, including team logos and names, in any future baseball products. Despite this limitation, Upper Deck commented that they would still continue to produce baseball-related cards without using those trademarks.

On September 29, 2009, Upper Deck created the company&#x27;s first-ever packs of Finnish- and Swedish-language Victory hockey cards.

In February 2010, Blizzard Entertainment ended its licensing deal with Upper Deck, which had previously produced the World of Warcraft trading card game.

On April 7, 2010, Upper Deck announced it would no longer be licensed to produce NFL trading cards. Upper Deck spokesperson Terry Melia noted on his Twitter account that, &quot;UD was unable to come to terms with NFL Properties. No NFL Properties-licensed football cards from UD in 2010.&quot; Upper Deck owner Richard McWilliam said, &quot;Over the past year, Upper Deck has attempted to negotiate a new licensing deal with NFL Properties. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we were not able to reach agreeable terms, and therefore will not be issuing any NFL Properties-licensed trading cards for the 2010 season. Upper Deck will continue to focus on its exclusive license agreement with the Collegiate Licensing Company and co-exclusive agreements with NHL Enterprises and the NHL Players Association, as well as its multiple entertainment licenses.&quot;

On January 8, 2015, Panini America acquired the Collegiate Licensing Company exclusive trading card agreement that Upper Deck formerly owned.

===DeWayne Buice===
DeWayne Buice, then a California Angels pitcher, would later become one of Upper Deck&#x27;s founding partners. In November 1987, Buice walked into The Upper Deck, a trading card store. Store owner Bill Hemrick noticed Buice and the two struck up a friendship, one that led to Buice&#x27;s hosting an autograph session at the store. Within weeks, Buice had become one of Hemrick&#x27;s business partners.
Hemrick and his partner Paul Sumner were in the process of starting Upper Deck. Unfortunately, the two lacked the business and personal connections to help land the necessary Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) license, which would allow Upper Deck to use players&#x27; names and likenesses on its cards. The only response they received was that the players&#x27; union was not accepting another card company for three more years. Buice was told that if he could help secure the license, he would receive a 12 percent stake in the card company. Buice would become a key figure in getting MLBPA officials to agree to a meeting. By the end of the 1988 season, Hemrick and Sumner received the license and by 1989, were making baseball cards.

By the time Buice retired from professional baseball at the end of the 1989 season, he had collected $2.8 million from Upper Deck. Believing the company owed him even more money, Buice sued Upper Deck executives. After the battle over Buice&#x27;s stake in the company was settled in court, he became a millionaire who reportedly made $17 million on the deal, far more than he ever made as a baseball player. In two-and-a-half seasons with the Angels, Buice made $212,500.

Upper Deck was originally scheduled to pay Buice his millions over a four-year period, but due to the 1994 baseball strike, Upper Deck&#x27;s business stalled. Buice then agreed to a six-year payment plan. Sales in 1995 and 1996 fell so far that for those two years, virtually all the company&#x27;s profits went to Buice.

On the day in 1998 that Upper Deck cut Buice his final check, the company threw a party at its Carlsbad, California, headquarters. The top brass ordered employees to work just a half day. Later that year at the Christmas party, Upper Deck CEO Richard McWilliam told employees the company&#x27;s deal with Buice was the worst deal it had ever done.

===1989 set and Ken Griffey Jr.===
In the 1989 Upper Deck baseball set, Ken Griffey Jr. was selected to be featured on card number one. The decision to make Griffey Jr. the first card was reached in late 1988.

A teenage employee named Tom Geideman was the one who suggested the use of Griffey as its choice for the number-one card. Traditionally, Topps had a system for reserving various numbers in their sets (such as numbers 1 and 100) for the biggest stars in the game. Geideman decided that a top prospect should be honored with the number one card in the inaugural 1989 set. After reviewing Baseball America, Geideman narrowed the list of candidates to four: Gregg Jefferies of the New York Mets, Gary Sheffield of the Milwaukee Brewers, Sandy Alomar Jr. of the San Diego Padres, and Ken Griffey Jr. Geideman was a Seattle Mariners fan and decided that Ken Griffey Jr. should be the prospect featured on card number one of the 1989 set.

At press time, Griffey had not yet played a major league game, so Upper Deck used an image of Griffey in a San Bernardino Spirit uniform. Competitors such as Score and Topps neglected to include a card of Griffey in their regular 1989 sets. Both brands would make a card of Griffey in their end of year Traded sets. Upper Deck&#x27;s Griffey exclusivity gain exposure due to the popularity of Griffey in the 1989 MLB season.

Despite the popularity of the Griffey card, it was not a scarce card. The card was situated in the top left hand corner of the uncut sheets and was more liable to be cut poorly or have its corners dinged. Company policy was that if a customer found a damaged card in its package, the company would replace it. Many Griffey cards were returned and the result was that Upper Deck printed many uncut sheets (sheets consisting of 100 cards) of just the Griffey card. According to Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), the Ken Griffey Jr. card would become the most graded card of all time with the company; PSA graded over 50,000 of the cards. The Beckett Grading card service has evaluated over 25,000 of the Ken Griffey Jr. rookie cards.

==High end sports cards and insert sets==

===Memorabilia and relic cards===
Upper Deck has changed its practice of using materials certified as &quot;Worn&quot; by the player depicted on the front of the card. The changed wording on the backs of Upper Deck insert cards makes it less clear as to how the materials were used or what player wore the item.

*EXAMPLE: Steve Nash card 2004 (back of card): On the front of this card is an authentic piece of a jersey WORN by Steve Nash as a member of the Dallas Mavericks in an NBA game.
*EXAMPLE: Jermaine O&#x27;Neal card 2006 Exquisite (back of card)&quot; On the front of this is a piece of memorabilia that has been certified to us as having been USED in an NBA game.

Upper Deck&#x27;s authenticity has been questioned in regards to players&#x27; jersey and uniform materials, but with no real founding. The cards state that the inserted items are known to Upper Deck to have been used or worn, and authenticity is certified by third-party memorabilia vendors. Some of Upper Deck&#x27;s jersey materials are harvested at events like rookie photo shoots, during such events, players will wear provided uniforms to generate event-worn material that never sees the field of play, but these practices are reserved to rookies or retired players.

Collectors still debate and question the authenticity of such &#x27;memorabilia&quot;, which often includes items manufactured specifically for insert cards, patches, and other desirable content.

===NBA Exquisite Collection===
Upper Deck premiered its &quot;NBA Exquisite Collection&quot; line in the 2003–2004 season. Each pack contained five basketball cards; one veteran base card numbered to 225, one autographed rookie card featuring a piece of patch worn by the player numbered to 99 or 225, one game worn jersey card, one autographed/patch insert card, and a fifth card that was either a low numbered parallel or an additional autographed patch card. Suggested retail price of the product was $500, making it the most expensive basketball card product ever produced at the time (the few packs that remain unopened now sell for over $4,000). Autograph cards include veterans such as Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Carmelo Anthony. The most sought after cards from the line include the autographed/patch rookie cards numbered to 99 (LeBron James, Darko Milicic, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, and Udonis Haslem), the Limited Logos inserts which feature an extra large jersey patch piece and autograph, and the autographed/patch rookie parallels serial numbered to the player&#x27;s jersey number.

===Other Exquisite Collection series===
In view of the Exquisite series&#x27; success, the company has released 2004–05 and 2005–06 basketball sets, a 2005 football line, and an analogous 2005–06 hockey line called The Cup. The football line, which includes autographed rookie &quot;patch&quot; cards, is the most popular of the series. Variants of these cards, called the Gold Series, are limited to runs of 25 or 99 cards. The company&#x27;s Exquisite-branded baseball series were introduced first as premiums in lower-end Upper Deck products (including the company&#x27;s SP Legendary Cuts and Artifacts Baseball lines). In late 2007, the company added another line to its Exquisite Collections brand, focused on rookie players. This recent addition is retailed at US$249 per pack.

===Yankee Stadium Legacy===
The Yankee Stadium Legacy set is a 6,742-card compilation chronicling every single game ever played at Yankee Stadium. The card set made its official debut inserted in random packs of Upper Deck&#x27;s 2008 Series 1 Baseball.

Other cards in the set commemorate some of the most famous sporting events that have taken place at Yankee Stadium. Some of these events include: Lou Gehrig&#x27;s &quot;Luckiest Man Alive&quot; Speech (July 4, 1939); Babe Ruth&#x27;s &quot;Final Visit to Yankee Stadium&quot; (June 11, 1948); Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling heavyweight title bout (June 19, 1936, Schmeling won), the 1958 NFL Championship between the New York Giants and the Baltimore Colts and Muhammad Ali&#x27;s title defense against Ken Norton (Sept. 28, 1976).

&quot;Guinness World Records&quot; stated an intention to certify the Yankee Stadium Legacy as the largest baseball card set ever produced, once all the cards were released. The official recognition will take place only after all of the 6,500 cards are released in Upper Deck&#x27;s various baseball card launches throughout the year.

The various sets where the Yankee Stadium Legacy cards were inserted into were: Spectrum; Piece of History; SPx; Upper Deck Series Two; SP Legendary Cuts (hobby-only); SP Authentic; UDx; and UD Masterpieces. Upper Deck started a website so that collectors could find out more about the Yankee Stadium Legacy set. Alphanumeric codes found on the backs of Yankee Stadium Legacy cards can be entered at the site, and collectors would be able to use the site to manage their collections online, and track their collections against other collectors via a leader board.

Tommy Baxter, a 36-year-old from Little Rock, Arkansas, was the first collector to put together Upper Deck&#x27;s Yankee Stadium Legacy (YSL) Collection.

===NHL Biography of a Season===
The NHL Biography of a Season cards was a 30-card set capturing the greatest moments of the 2008-09 NHL Season. The cards were available through Upper Deck Certified Diamond Dealers. A collector had to redeem five wrappers of 2008/2009 Upper Deck hockey cards at a participating hobby store and receive an exclusive Upper Deck Biography of a Season card. One new card was available every week throughout the NHL season. The first four cards were:
*Alexander Ovechkin - NHL single-season record 65 goals by LW
*Henrik Zetterberg - 2008 Conn Smythe winner
*Detroit Red Wings - Stanley Cup team photo
*Steven Stamkos - 1st overall pick in 2008 Draft

===20th Anniversary Program===
In observance of its 20th anniversary in 2009, Upper Deck released a set that can be found in all of the company&#x27;s 2009 baseball trading card releases. The massive 2,500 card set commemorated the last 20 years in sports, pop culture, politics, world history and technology. The first cards from the 20th Anniversary Retrospective set were found in 2009 Upper Deck Series One Baseball. An additional element to the set was the 100-card memorabilia set that was found in all sets beginning with 2009 Upper Deck Spectrum Baseball (released on February 24).

===NBA Michael Jordan Legacy===
In April 2009, the company announcement that longtime company spokesman Michael Jordan would be honored with an 1,170-card tribute insert set chronicling every single Chicago Bulls game Jordan played in. The set will begin with his NBA debut on October 26, 1984, through his final Bulls appearance in Game 6 of the NBA Finals on June 14, 1998.
The 1,170-card set will pack out across four 2009 Upper Deck basketball products: Lineage (April 1); Radiance (April 29); Upper Deck (Sept. 22); and First Edition (Sept. 29). Each of the cards will include Jordan&#x27;s specific box score stats from the game in question. Every card in the set will be given some historical significance as the overall set captures every game Jordan ever played with the Bulls, regular-season and playoff battles included. The cards will fall, on average, 1:4 packs across all four brands.

In addition to the 1,170 Jordan game cards, Upper Deck also included 100 different game-used memorabilia cards, each one crash-numbered to 23. The cards will sport swatches from Jordan&#x27;s game-worn jerseys. More than 100 different action photos showing Jordan through the years were used for card front photography.

==Acquired brands==

===Konami===
Upper Deck acquired the rights to distribute the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game&quot; from Konami in 2002. That same year, second quarter American sales reached $17 million.

In October 2008, Konami sued Vintage Sports Cards for distributing &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Trading Game Cards, along with counterfeit cards. The cards were found in a Los Angeles Toys-R-Us. Vintage denied any wrongdoing, claiming they legally obtained all cards (counterfeits included) directly from Upper Deck. Konami added Upper Deck as defendants on December 11. December 2008, Konami announced they were assuming full control over &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; TCG, which includes distribution and customer support. In response, Upper Deck filed a $75 million suit against Konami in Nevada District Court.

In a January 26, 2009 press release Upper Deck denied allegations of counterfeiting, and stated that Upper Deck would support the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; community in an upcoming event. On February 26, 2009, Upper Deck was ordered to cease distribution of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; products, stop using Konami&#x27;s trademarks and stop promoting itself as an authorized distributor or rights-holder to &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;.

On January 10, 2010, Judge Valerie Baker Fairbank ruled in a US District Court that Upper Deck had counterfeited the cards, and additionally threw out Upper Deck&#x27;s countersuit alleging breach of the distribution agreement. The next stage of the case began on January 26, 2010, where a jury was to decide whether Upper Deck was liable for counterfeiting the cards. During the opening statement for the defense, Upper Deck&#x27;s attorney, Richard Howell of Rutan &amp; Tucker stated &quot;The behavior is still undeniably wrong. And I am in here, as counsel for the two defendants, asking you to hold my clients accountable for that behavior; asking you to hold my clients responsible for this conduct that there is no dispute, and there was no disputing even before this case started today, that it was wrong.&quot; After the second day of court proceedings, Konami and Upper Deck reached an out-of-court settlement. The terms were not publicly disclosed.

=== Maxx racing cards ===
Maxx produced racing cards from 1988 to 1996. Upper Deck started producing racing cards in 1995, acquired the Maxx brand in December 1996 and discontinued the line in 2000.

=== O-Pee-Chee ===
Upper Deck became licensor of the O-Pee-Chee brand in 2007, after the original Canadian company was sold to Nestlé in 1996. O-Pee-Chee&#x27;s collections of baseball and ice hockey cards had been commercialised by Topps from 1997 to 2004. Since Upper Deck succeeded Topps as licensor, it has released several collections up to the present day.

==Other brands==

===Upper Deck Entertainment===
Upper Deck Entertainment (UDE), a division of The Upper Deck Company, used to produce the English, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, and French language versions of the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Trading Card Game, a collectible card game, licensed from Konami. Other collectible card games have included the &quot;Winx Club&quot; trading card game for girls, which has since been canceled, the &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; Trading Card Game based on the popular MMORPG. UDE lost this license in early 2010. The &quot;Marvel Trading Card Game&quot; and the &quot;DC Comics Trading Card Game&quot;, using their proprietary &quot;VS System&quot;, was canceled in early 2009. It has since been relaunched as VS. System 2PCG. In October 2005, UDE introduced a trading card game based on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;&quot; series and the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; films. It has also released many non-game oriented sports-based and multimedia companion trading card sets.

The Entertainment department was all but dissolved in March 2010 citing layoffs for a large number of employees. After about a year of hibernation, the Entertainment Department began to rebuild and gained traction again in board gaming with the release of &quot;Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game&quot; Earning industry awards and securing large scale mass market placement, the company was back in the driver&#x27;s seat. Eventually, the department entered the mobile game market with &quot;Legendary: DXP&quot;.

===Upper Deck Digital===
Upper Deck Digital technology includes the PenCam, an authentication system and the e-Card, a trading card with a virtual twin. They also provide Personalized Trading Card, allowing amateur sports fans to go online and create their own Upper Deck trading card. WebPass is a technology that turns an invisible watermark on a trading card into the collector&#x27;s key into secret websites.

===Upper Deck International===
In 1991, Upper Deck introduced its products to the global marketplace with the creation of Upper Deck Europe, headquartered in the Netherlands. With an office in Amsterdam and distribution throughout Europe, Asia and India, the company markets and sells TCG&#x27;s, Toys, Games and Collectibles that are geared to local consumers. The emphasis is less on sports items and more on toys and games.

The organization changed its name to Upper Deck International in 2008, reflecting an increasingly broader outlook than Europe alone.
In addition to EMEA, Upper Deck International is responsible for Oceania, Japan and Latin America. With offices in Berlin, Paris, London, Milan, Tokyo, Sydney and São Paulo the company is optimally organized for distribution across the globe. Upper Deck International lost the Yu-Gi-Oh license as well in 2009.

On February 14, 2012, Upper Deck International declared bankruptcy.

===Upper Deck Kids===
In April 2006, Upper Deck created Upper Deck Kids with the slogan &quot;Get More Than Lucky.&quot; Kids could enter codes printed on the back of cards on the website to get points, which they can redeem for prizes. In April 2007, Upper Deck instituted a monthly limit of 1000 codes, and adults became ineligible to sign up. New rewards are usually added weekly. Prizes in the past included autographed memorabilia, sports card boxes, screensavers, desktop wallpapers, video games, and systems, among others. The website also encourages you to buy sports cards. Each prize is worth a different amount. Upper Deck Kids also has message boards where kids can talk about sports, trade codes, gossip, etc. Also, Upper Deck implemented a limit on how many invalid codes you can enter due to multiple hackers that wrote code-cracking programs to guess all the possible codes and take all the prizes for themselves.
Additionally, Upper Deck announced that children are no longer able to redeem Upper Deck product codes from 2006 for points on the kids&#x27; website to avoid &quot;code sharing&quot; amongst members. Code sharing involves publishing massive lists of free codes posted on third-party sites that can be used to redeem vast numbers of points. Trading of codes also takes place on the website. Also, to encourage kids to buy the most recent Upper Deck products, codes from the backs of cards older than six months are worth half of their original rewards points value.

=== Sports ===
Upper Deck has covered a wide range of sports through its trading cards collections, currently focusing on few of them. Some of the collections released by the company include:

=== Non-sports ===
==Lawsuits==
Under the executive direction of McWilliam, Upper Deck became known as a litigious company. Stars like Mickey Mantle, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Ted Williams, Upper Deck employees, vendors and even licensors were forced to the courts to settle simple disputes with McWilliam. Pelton &amp; Associates successfully froze all of Upper Deck&#x27;s product shipments after they proved to the court that they actually owned the custom logos, designs and packaging and that Upper Deck had not paid them.

Konami - After Upper Deck admitted to counterfeiting cards, the lawsuit was settled out of court.

MLB - filed a federal lawsuit in New York against Upper Deck, accusing the company of trademark infringement and illegally selling cards that feature official team logos and uniforms. The complaint also notes that Upper Deck owes MLB $2.4 million.

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - Upper Deck used six photos of Abdul-Jabbar during his college years without permission. The photos were part of a trading card series called &quot;Greats of the Game,&quot; which also had Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s name and signature.
&quot;Abdul-Jabbar never authorized the production of the cards,&quot; the suit reads according to Courthouse News. &quot;In fact, at all times, Upper Deck was fully aware that Abdul-Jabbar had never authorized Upper Deck to use his photograph, name and signature for college-themed cards, and Abdul-Jabbar had previously rejected Upper Deck&#x27;s request for such authorization.&quot;
Upper Deck has yet to respond to the allegations.

American International Specialty Lines Insurance Company - This case arose out of an insurance policy that The Upper Deck Corporation (&quot;Upper Deck&quot;), purchased from American International Specialty Lines Insurance Company (&quot;AISLIC&quot;). The policy insured a tax strategy that KPMG, an accounting firm, developed for Upper Deck. The IRS investigated the tax strategy and determined that it constituted an improper tax shelter. Upper Deck then settled with the IRS for $80 million in back taxes and interest, and with the California Franchise Tax Board for $17 million in back taxes and interest.

After AISLIC rejected Upper Deck&#x27;s claim that the policy covered the loss incurred as a result of the settlement, Upper Deck and its chief executive officer, Richard McWilliam, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that the policy issued by AISLIC covered the loss. Subsequently, the district court granted AISLIC&#x27;s motion to compel arbitration.

A three-member panel of arbitrators held that Upper Deck and McWilliam were not entitled to coverage because Upper Deck had abandoned the tax strategy that AISLIC had insured. The district court confirmed the arbitration award.

<text>PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations), also known as Project Plato and Project PLATO, was the first generalized computer-assisted instruction system. Starting in 1960, it ran on the University of Illinois&#x27;s ILLIAC I computer. By the late 1970s, it supported several thousand graphics terminals distributed worldwide, running on nearly a dozen different networked mainframe computers. Many modern concepts in multi-user computing were first developed on PLATO, including forums, message boards, online testing, email, chat rooms, picture languages, instant messaging, remote screen sharing, and multiplayer video games.

PLATO was designed and built by the University of Illinois and functioned for four decades, offering coursework (elementary through university) to UIUC students, local schools, prison inmates, and other universities. Courses were taught in a range of subjects, including Latin, chemistry, education, music, Esperanto, and primary mathematics. The system included a number of features useful for pedagogy, including text overlaying graphics, contextual assessment of free-text answers, depending on the inclusion of keywords, and feedback designed to respond to alternative answers.

Rights to market PLATO as a commercial product were licensed by Control Data Corporation (CDC), the manufacturer on whose mainframe computers the PLATO IV system was built. CDC President William Norris planned to make PLATO a force in the computer world, but found that marketing the system was not as easy as hoped. PLATO nevertheless built a strong following in certain markets, and the last production PLATO system was in use until 2006.

==History ==
===Impetus ===
Before the 1944 G.I. Bill that provided free college education to World War II veterans, higher education was limited to a minority of the US population, though only 9% of the population was in the military. The trend towards greater enrollment was notable by the early 1950s, and the problem of providing instruction for the many new students was a serious concern to university administrators. To wit, if computerized automation increased factory production, it could do the same for academic instruction.

The USSR&#x27;s 1957 launching of the Sputnik I artificial satellite energized the United States&#x27; government into spending more on science and engineering education. In 1958, the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Office of Scientific Research had a conference about the topic of computer instruction at the University of Pennsylvania; interested parties, notably IBM, presented studies.

=== Genesis ===
Around 1959, Chalmers W. Sherwin, a physicist at the University of Illinois, suggested a computerised learning system to William Everett, the engineering college dean, who, in turn, recommended that Daniel Alpert, another physicist, convene a meeting about the matter with engineers, administrators, mathematicians, and psychologists. After weeks of meetings they were unable to agree on a single design. Before conceding failure, Alpert mentioned the matter to laboratory assistant Donald Bitzer, who had been thinking about the problem, suggesting he could build a demonstration system.

Project PLATO was established soon afterwards, and in 1960, the first system, PLATO I, operated on the local ILLIAC I computer. It included a television set for display and a special keyboard for navigating the system&#x27;s function menus; PLATO II, in 1961, featured two users at once, one of the first implementations of multi-user time-sharing.


The PLATO system was re-designed, between 1963 and 1969; PLATO III allowed &quot;anyone&quot; to design new lesson modules using their TUTOR programming language, conceived in 1967 by biology graduate student Paul Tenczar. Built on a CDC 1604, given to them by William Norris, PLATO III could simultaneously run up to 20 terminals, and was used by local facilities in Champaign–Urbana that could enter the system with their custom terminals. The only remote PLATO III terminal was located near the state capitol in Springfield, Illinois at Springfield High School. It was connected to the PLATO III system by a video connection and a separate dedicated line for keyboard data.

PLATO I, II, and III were funded by small grants from a combined Army-Navy-Air Force funding pool. By the time PLATO III was in operation, everyone involved was convinced it was worthwhile to scale up the project. Accordingly, in 1967, the National Science Foundation granted the team steady funding, allowing Alpert to set up the Computer-based Education Research Laboratory (CERL) at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign campus. The system was capable of supporting 20 time-sharing terminals.

=== Multimedia experiences (PLATO IV) ===
In 1972, with the introduction of PLATO IV, Bitzer declared general success, claiming that the goal of generalized computer instruction was now available to all. However, the terminals were very expensive (about $12,000). The PLATO IV terminal had several major innovations:

* Plasma Display Screen: Bitzer&#x27;s orange plasma display, incorporated both memory and bitmapped graphics into one display. The display was a 512×512 bitmap, with both character and vector plotting done by hardwired logic. It included fast vector line drawing capability, and ran at 1260 baud, rendering 60 lines or 180 characters per second. . Users could provide their own characters to support rudimentary bitmap graphics.
* Touch panel: A 16×16 grid infrared touch panel, allowing students to answer questions by touching anywhere on the screen.
* Microfiche images: Compressed air powered a piston-driven microfiche image selector that permitted colored images to be projected on the back of the screen under program control.
* A hard drive for Audio snippets: The random-access audio device used a magnetic disc with a capacity to hold 17 total minutes of pre-recorded audio. It could retrieve for playback any of 4096 audio clips within 0.4 seconds. By 1980, the device was being commercially produced by Education and Information Systems, Incorporated with a capacity of just over 22 minutes.
* A Votrax voice synthesizer
* The Gooch Synthetic Woodwind (named after inventor Sherwin Gooch), a synthesizer that offered four-voice music synthesis to provide sound in PLATO courseware. This was later supplanted on the PLATO V terminal by the Gooch Cybernetic Synthesizer, which had sixteen voices that could be programmed individually, or combined to make more complex sounds.

Bruce Parello, a student at the University of Illinois in 1972, created the first digital emojis on the PLATO IV system.

=== Influence on PARC and Apple ===
Early in 1972, researchers from Xerox PARC were given a tour of the PLATO system at the University of Illinois. At this time, they were shown parts of the system, such as the &quot;Insert Display/Show Display&quot; (ID/SD) application generator for pictures on PLATO (later translated into a graphics-draw program on the Xerox Star workstation); the &quot;Charset Editor&quot; for &quot;painting&quot; new characters (later translated into a &quot;Doodle&quot; program at PARC); and the &quot;Term Talk&quot; and &quot;Monitor Mode&quot; communications programs. Many of the new technologies they saw were adopted and improved upon, when these researchers returned to Palo Alto, California. They subsequently transferred improved versions of this technology to Apple Inc.

=== CDC years ===
As PLATO IV reached production quality, William Norris (CDC) became increasingly interested in it as a potential product. His interest was twofold. From a strict business perspective, he was evolving Control Data into a service-based company instead of a hardware one, and was increasingly convinced that computer-based education would become a major market in the future. At the same time, Norris was troubled by the unrest of the late 1960s, and felt that much of it was due to social inequalities that needed to be addressed. PLATO offered a solution by providing higher education to segments of the population that would otherwise never be able to afford a university education.

Norris provided CERL with machines on which to develop their system in the late 1960s. In 1971, he set up a new division within CDC to develop PLATO &quot;courseware&quot;, and eventually many of CDC&#x27;s own initial training and technical manuals ran on it. In 1974, PLATO was running on in-house machines at CDC headquarters in Minneapolis, and in 1976, they purchased the commercial rights in exchange for a new CDC Cyber machine.
CDC announced the acquisition soon after, claiming that by 1985, 50% of the company&#x27;s income would be related to PLATO services. Through the 1970s, CDC tirelessly promoted PLATO, both as a commercial tool and one for re-training unemployed workers in new fields. Norris refused to give up on the system, and invested in several non-mainstream courses, including a crop-information system for farmers, and various courses for inner-city youth. CDC even went as far as to place PLATO terminals in some shareholder&#x27;s houses, to demonstrate the concept of the system.

In the early 1980s, CDC started heavily advertising the service, apparently due to increasing internal dissent over the now $600 million project, taking out print and even radio ads promoting it as a general tool. &quot;The Minneapolis Tribune&quot; was unconvinced by their ad copy and started an investigation of the claims. In the end, they concluded that while it was not proven to be a better education system, everyone using it nevertheless enjoyed it, at least. An official evaluation by an external testing agency ended with roughly the same conclusions, suggesting that everyone enjoyed using it, but it was essentially equal to an average human teacher in terms of student advancement.

Of course, a computerized system equal to a human should have been a major achievement, the very concept for which the early pioneers in CBT were aiming. A computer could serve all the students in a school for the cost of maintaining it, and wouldn&#x27;t go on strike. However, CDC charged $50 an hour for access to their data center, in order to recoup some of their development costs, making it considerably more expensive than a human on a per-student basis. PLATO was, therefore, a failure as a profitable commercial enterprise, although it did find some use in large companies and government agencies willing to invest in the technology.

An attempt to mass-market the PLATO system was introduced in 1980 as Micro-PLATO, which ran the basic TUTOR system on a CDC &quot;Viking-721&quot; terminal and various home computers. Versions were built for the TI-99/4A, Atari 8-bit computers, Zenith Z-100 and, later, Radio Shack TRS-80, and IBM Personal Computer. Micro-PLATO could be used stand-alone for normal courses, or could connect to a CDC data center for multiuser programs. To make the latter affordable, CDC introduced the &quot;Homelink&quot; service for $5 an hour.

Norris continued to praise PLATO, announcing that it would be only a few years before it represented a major source of income for CDC as late as 1984. In 1986, Norris stepped down as CEO, and the PLATO service was slowly killed off. He later claimed that Micro-PLATO was one of the reasons PLATO got off-track. They had started on the TI-99/4A, but then Texas Instruments pulled the plug and they moved to other systems like the Atari, who soon did the same. He felt that it was a waste of time anyway, as the system&#x27;s value was in its online nature, which Micro-PLATO lacked initially.

Bitzer was more forthright about CDC&#x27;s failure, blaming their corporate culture for the problems. He noted that development of the courseware was averaging $300,000 per delivery hour, many times what the CERL was paying for similar products. This meant that CDC had to charge high prices in order to recoup their costs, prices that made the system unattractive. The reason, he suggested, for these high prices was that CDC had set up a division that had to keep itself profitable via courseware development, forcing them to raise the prices in order to keep their headcount up during slow periods.

=== PLATO V: multimedia ===
Intel 8080 microprocessors were introduced in the new PLATO V terminals. They could download small software modules and execute them locally. It was a way to augment the PLATO courseware with rich animation and other sophisticated capabilities.

== Online community ==
Although PLATO was designed for computer-based education, perhaps its most enduring legacy is its place in the origins of online community. This was made possible by PLATO&#x27;s groundbreaking communication and interface capabilities, features whose significance is only lately being recognized by computer historians. PLATO Notes, created by David R. Woolley in 1973, was among the world&#x27;s first online message boards, and years later became the direct progenitor of Lotus Notes.

PLATO&#x27;s plasma panels were well suited to games, although its I/O bandwidth (180 characters per second or 60 graphic lines per second) was relatively slow. By virtue of 1500 shared 60-bit variables per game (initially), it was possible to implement online games. Because it was an educational computer system, most of the user community were keenly interested in games.

In much the same way that the PLATO hardware and development platform inspired advances elsewhere (such as at Xerox PARC and MIT), many popular commercial and Internet games ultimately derived their inspiration from PLATO&#x27;s early games. As one example, &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; by PLATO alum Silas Warner was inspired by PLATO&#x27;s dungeon games (see below), in turn inspiring &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;. Thousands of multiplayer online games were developed on PLATO from around 1970 through the 1980s, with the following notable examples:

* Daleske&#x27;s &quot;Empire&quot; a top-view multiplayer space game based on &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Either Empire or Colley&#x27;s &quot;Maze War&quot; is the first networked multiplayer action game. It was ported to &quot;Trek82&quot;, &quot;Trek83&quot;, &quot;ROBOTREK&quot;, &quot;Xtrek&quot;, and &quot;Netrek&quot;, and also adapted (without permission) for the Apple II computer by fellow PLATO alum Robert Woodhead (of &quot;&quot; fame), as a game called &quot;Galactic Attack&quot;.
* The original &quot;Freecell&quot; by Alfille (from Baker&#x27;s concept).
* Fortner&#x27;s &quot;Airfight&quot;, probably the direct inspiration for (PLATO alum) Bruce Artwick&#x27;s &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot;.
* Haefeli and Bridwell&#x27;s &quot;Panther&quot; (a vector graphics-based tankwar game, anticipating Atari&#x27;s &quot;Battlezone&quot;).
* Many other first-person shooters, most notably Bowery&#x27;s &quot;Spasim&quot; and Witz and Boland&#x27;s &quot;Futurewar&quot;, believed to be the first FPS.
* Countless games inspired by the role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, including the original Rutherford/Whisenhunt and Wood &quot;dnd&quot; (later ported to the PDP-10/11 by Lawrence, who earlier had visited PLATO). and is believed to be the first dungeon crawl game and was followed by: &quot;Moria&quot;, &quot;Rogue&quot;, &quot;Dry Gulch&quot; (a western-style variation), and &quot;Bugs-n-Drugs&quot; (a medical variation)—all presaging MUDs (Multi-User Domains) and MOOs (MUDs, Object Oriented) as well as popular first-person shooters like &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;, and MMORPGs (Massively multiplayer online role-playing game) like &quot;EverQuest&quot; and &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. &quot;Avatar&quot;, PLATO&#x27;s most popular game, is one of the world&#x27;s first MUDs and has over 1 million hours of use.. The games &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot; can trace part of their lineage back to PLATO programmer Silas Warner.

PLATO&#x27;s communication tools and games formed the basis for an online community of thousands of PLATO users, which lasted for well over twenty years. PLATO&#x27;s games became so popular that a program called &quot;The Enforcer&quot; was written to run as a background process to regulate or disable game play at most sites and times – a precursor to parental-style control systems that regulate access based on content rather than security considerations.

In September 2006 the Federal Aviation Administration retired its PLATO system, the last system that ran the PLATO software system on a CDC Cyber mainframe, from active duty. Existing PLATO-like systems now include NovaNET and Cyber1.org.

By early 1976, the original PLATO IV system had 950 terminals giving access to more than 3500 contact hours of courseware, and additional systems were in operation at CDC and Florida State University. Eventually, over 12,000 contact hours of courseware was developed, much of it developed by university faculty for higher education. PLATO courseware covers a full range of high-school and college courses, as well as topics such as reading skills, family planning, Lamaze training and home budgeting. In addition, authors at the University of Illinois School of Basic Medical Sciences (now, the University of Illinois College of Medicine) devised a large number of basic science lessons and a self-testing system for first-year students. However the most popular &quot;courseware&quot; remained their multi-user games and role-playing video games such as &quot;dnd&quot;, although it appears CDC was uninterested in this market. As the value of a CDC-based solution disappeared in the 1980s, interested educators ported the engine first to the IBM PC, and later to web-based systems.

== Custom character sets ==
In the early 1970s, some people working in the modern foreign languages group at the University of Illinois began working on a set of Hebrew lessons, originally without good system support for leftward writing. In preparation for a PLATO demo in Tehran, that would participate in, Sherwood worked with Don Lee to implement support for leftward writing, including Persian (Farsi), which uses the Arabic script. There was no funding for this work, which was undertaken only due to Sherwood&#x27;s personal interest, and no curriculum development occurred for either Persian or Arabic. However, Peter Cole, Robert Lebowitz, and Robert Hart used the new system capabilities to re-do the Hebrew lessons. The PLATO hardware and software supported the design and use of one&#x27;s own 8-by-16 characters, so most languages could be displayed on the graphics screen (including those written right-to-left).

== University of Illinois School of Music PLATO Project (Technology and Research-based Chronology) ==
A PLATO-compatible music language known as OPAL (Octave-Pitch-Accent-Length) was developed for these synthesizers, as well as a compiler for the language, two music text editors, a filing system for music binaries, programs to play the music binaries in real time, and print musical scores, and many debugging and compositional aids. A number of interactive compositional programs have also been written. Gooch&#x27;s peripherals were heavily used for music education courseware as created, for example, by the University of Illinois School of Music PLATO Project.

From 1970 to 1994, the University of Illinois (U of I) School of Music explored the use of the Computer-based Education Research Laboratory (CERL) PLATO computer system to deliver online instruction in music. Led by G. David Peters, music faculty and students worked with PLATO’s technical capabilities to produce music-related instructional materials and experimented with their use in the music curriculum.

Peters began his work on PLATO III. By 1972, the PLATO IV system made it technically possible to introduce multimedia pedagogies that were not available in the marketplace until years later.

Between 1974 and 1988, 25 U of I music faculty participated in software curriculum development and more than 40 graduate students wrote software and assisted the faculty in its use. In 1988, the project broadened its focus beyond PLATO to accommodate the increasing availability and use of microcomputers. The broader scope resulted in renaming the project to &quot;The Illinois Technology-based Music Project.&quot; Work in the School of Music continued on other platforms after the CERL PLATO system shutdown in 1994. Over the 24-year life of the music project, its many participants moved into educational institutions and into the private sector. Their influence can be traced to numerous multimedia pedagogies, products, and services in use today, especially by musicians and music educators.

=== Significant early efforts ===
==== Pitch recognition/performance judging ====
In 1969, G. David Peters began researching the feasibility of using PLATO to teach trumpet students to play with increased pitch and rhythmic precision. He created an interface for the PLATO III terminal. The hardware consisted of (1) filters that could determine the true pitch of a tone, and (2) a counting device to measure tone duration. The device accepted and judged rapid notes, two notes trilled, and lip slurs. Peters demonstrated that judging instrumental performance for pitch and rhythmic accuracy was feasible in computer-assisted instruction.

===== Rhythm notation and perception =====
By 1970, a random access audio device was available for use with PLATO III.

In 1972, Robert W. Placek conducted a study that used computer-assisted instruction for rhythm perception. Placek used the random access audio device attached to a PLATO III terminal for which he developed music notation fonts and graphics. Students majoring in elementary education were asked to (1) recognize elements of rhythm notation, and (2) listen to rhythm patterns and identify their notations. This was the first known application of the PLATO random-access audio device to computer-based music instruction.

Study participants were interviewed about the experience and found it both valuable and enjoyable. Of particular value was PLATO’s immediate feedback. Though participants noted shortcomings in the quality of the audio, they generally indicated that they were able to learn the basic skills of rhythm notation recognition.

These PLATO IV terminal included many new devices and yielded two notable music projects:

==== Visual diagnostic skills for instrumental music educators ====

By the mid-1970s, James O. Froseth (University of Michigan) had published training materials that taught instrumental music teachers to visually identify typical problems demonstrated by beginning band students. For each instrument, Froseth developed an ordered checklist of what to look for (i.e., posture, embouchure, hand placement, instrument position, etc.) and a set of 35mm slides of young players demonstrating those problems. In timed class exercises, trainees briefly viewed slides and recorded their diagnoses on the checklists which were reviewed and evaluated later in the training session.

In 1978, William H. Sanders adapted Froseth’s program for delivery using the PLATO IV system. Sanders transferred the slides to microfiche for rear-projection through the PLATO IV terminal’s plasma display. In timed drills, trainees viewed the slides, then filled in the checklists by touching them on the display. The program gave immediate feedback and kept aggregate records. Trainees could vary the timing of the exercises and repeat them whenever they wished.

Sanders and Froseth subsequently conducted a study to compare traditional classroom delivery of the program to delivery using PLATO. The results showed no significant difference between the delivery methods for a) student post-test performance and b) their attitudes toward the training materials. However, students using the computer appreciated the flexibility to set their own practice hours, completed significantly more practice exercises, and did so in significantly less time.

==== Musical instrument identification ====
In 1967, Allvin and Kuhn used a four-channel tape recorder interfaced to a computer to present pre-recorded models to judge sight-singing performances.

In 1969, Ned C. Deihl and Rudolph E. Radocy conducted a computer-assisted instruction study in music that included discriminating aural concepts related to phrasing, articulation, and rhythm on the clarinet. They used a four-track tape recorder interfaced to a computer to provide pre-recorded audio passages. Messages were recorded on three tracks and inaudible signals on the fourth track with two hours of play/record time available. This research further demonstrated that computer-controlled audio with four-track tape was possible.

In 1979, Williams used a digitally controlled cassette tape recorder that had been interfaced to a minicomputer (Williams, M.A. &quot;A comparison of three approaches to the teaching of auditory-visual discrimination, sight singing and music dictation to college music students: A traditional approach, a Kodaly approach, and a Kodaly approach augmented by computer-assisted instruction,&quot; University of Illinois, unpublished). This device worked, yet was slow with variable access times.

In 1981, Nan T. Watanabe researched the feasibility of computer-assisted music instruction using computer-controlled pre-recorded audio. She surveyed audio hardware that could interface with a computer system.

Random-access audio devices interfaced to PLATO IV terminals were also available. There were issues with sound quality due to dropouts in the audio. Regardless, Watanabe deemed consistent fast access to audio clips critical to the study design and selected this device for the study.

Watanabe’s computer-based drill-and-practice program taught elementary music education students to identify musical instruments by sound. Students listened to randomly selected instrument sounds, identified the instrument they heard, and received immediate feedback. Watanabe found no significant difference in learning between the group who learned through computer-assisted drill programs and the group receiving traditional instruction in instrument identification. The study did, however, demonstrate that use of random-access audio in computer-assisted instruction in music was feasible.

==== The Illinois Technology-based music project ====
By 1988, with the spread of micro-computers and their peripherals, the University of Illinois School of Music PLATO Project was renamed &quot;The Illinois Technology-based Music Project.&quot; Researchers subsequently explored the use of emerging, commercially available technologies for music instruction until 1994.

==== Influences and impacts ====

Educators and students used the PLATO System for music instruction at other educational institutions including Indiana University, Florida State University, and the University of Delaware. Many alumni of the University of Illinois School of Music PLATO Project gained early hands-on experience in computing and media technologies and moved into influential positions in both education and the private sector.

The goal of this system was to provide tools for music educators to use in the development of instructional materials, which might possibly include music dictation drills, automatically graded keyboard performances, envelope and timbre ear-training, interactive examples or labs in musical acoustics, and composition and theory exercises with immediate feedback. One ear-training application, Ottaviano, became a required part of certain undergraduate music theory courses at Florida State University in the early 1980s.

Another peripheral was the Votrax speech synthesizer, and a &quot;say&quot; instruction (with &quot;saylang&quot; instruction to choose the language) was added to the Tutor programming language to support text-to-speech synthesis using the Votrax.

== Other efforts ==
One of CDC&#x27;s greatest commercial successes with PLATO was an online testing system developed for National Association of Securities Dealers (now the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority), a private-sector regulator of the US securities markets. During the 1970s Michael Stein, E. Clarke Porter and PLATO veteran Jim Ghesquiere, in cooperation with NASD executive Frank McAuliffe, developed the first &quot;on-demand&quot; proctored commercial testing service. The testing business grew slowly and was ultimately spun off from CDC as Drake Training and Technologies in 1990. Applying many of the PLATO concepts used in the late 1970s, E. Clarke Porter led the Drake Training and Technologies testing business (today Thomson Prometric) in partnership with Novell, Inc. away from the mainframe model to a LAN-based client server architecture and changed the business model to deploy proctored testing at thousands of independent training organizations on a global scale. With the advent of a pervasive global network of testing centers and IT certification programs sponsored by, among others, Novell and Microsoft, the online testing business exploded. Pearson VUE was founded by PLATO/Prometric veterans E. Clarke Porter, Steve Nordberg and Kirk Lundeen in 1994 to further expand the global testing infrastructure. VUE improved on the business model by being one of the first commercial companies to rely on the Internet as a critical business service and by developing self-service test registration. The computer-based testing industry has continued to grow, adding professional licensure and educational testing as important business segments.

A number of smaller testing-related companies also evolved from the PLATO system. One of the few survivors of that group is The Examiner Corporation. Dr. Stanley Trollip (formerly of the University of Illinois Aviation Research Lab) and Gary Brown (formerly of Control Data) developed the prototype of The Examiner System in 1984.

In the early 1970s, James Schuyler developed a system at Northwestern University called HYPERTUTOR as part of Northwestern&#x27;s MULTI-TUTOR computer assisted instruction system. This ran on several CDC mainframes at various sites.

Between 1973 and 1980, a group under the direction of Thomas T. Chen at the Medical Computing Laboratory of the School of Basic Medical Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign ported PLATO&#x27;s TUTOR programming language to the MODCOMP IV minicomputer. Douglas W. Jones, A.B. Baskin, Tom Szolyga, Vincent Wu and Lou Bloomfield did most of the implementation. This was the first port of TUTOR to a minicomputer and was largely operational by 1976. In 1980, Chen founded Global Information Systems Technology of Champaign, Illinois, to market this as the Simpler system. GIST eventually merged with the Government Group of Adayana Inc. Vincent Wu went on to develop the Atari PLATO cartridge.

CDC eventually sold the &quot;PLATO&quot; trademark and some courseware marketing segment rights to the newly formed The Roach Organization (TRO) in 1989. In 2000 TRO changed their name to PLATO Learning and continue to sell and service PLATO courseware running on PCs. In late 2012, PLATO Learning brought its online learning solutions to market under the name Edmentum.

CDC continued development of the basic system under the name CYBIS (CYber-Based Instructional System) after selling the trademarks to Roach, in order to service their commercial and government customers. CDC later sold off their CYBIS business to University Online, which was a descendant of IMSATT. University Online was later renamed to VCampus.

The University of Illinois also continued development of PLATO, eventually setting up a commercial on-line service called NovaNET in partnership with University Communications, Inc. CERL was closed in 1994, with the maintenance of the PLATO code passing to UCI. UCI was later renamed NovaNET Learning, which was bought by National Computer Systems (NCS). Shortly after that, NCS was bought by Pearson, and after several name changes now operates as Pearson Digital Learning.

The Evergreen State College received several grants from CDC to implement computer language interpreters and associated programming instruction. Royalties received from the PLATO computer-aided instruction materials developed at Evergreen support technology grants and an annual lecture series on computer-related topics.

=== In South Africa ===
During the period when CDC was marketing PLATO, the system began to be used internationally. South Africa was one of the biggest users of PLATO in the early 1980s. Eskom, the South African electrical power company, had a large CDC mainframe at Megawatt Park in the northwest suburbs of Johannesburg. Mainly this computer was used for management and data processing tasks related to power generation and distribution, but it also ran the PLATO software. The largest PLATO installation in South Africa during the early 1980s was at the University of the Western Cape, which served the &quot;native&quot; population, and at one time had hundreds of PLATO IV terminals all connected by leased data lines back to Johannesburg. There were several other installations at educational institutions in South Africa, among them Madadeni College in the Madadeni township just outside Newcastle.

This was perhaps the most unusual PLATO installation anywhere. Madadeni had about 1,000 students, all of them who were original inhabitants i.e. native population and 99.5% of Zulu ancestry. The college was one of 10 teacher preparation institutions in kwaZulu, most of them much smaller. In many ways Madadeni was very primitive. None of the classrooms had electricity and there was only one telephone for the whole college, which one had to crank for several minutes before an operator might come on the line. So an air-conditioned, carpeted room with 16 computer terminals was a stark contrast to the rest of the college. At times the only way a person could communicate with the outside world was through PLATO term-talk.

For many of the Madadeni students, most of whom came from very rural areas, the PLATO terminal was the first time they encountered any kind of electronic technology. Many of the first-year students had never seen a flush toilet before. There initially was skepticism that these technologically illiterate students could effectively use PLATO, but those concerns were not borne out. Within an hour or less most students were using the system proficiently, mostly to learn math and science skills, although a lesson that taught keyboarding skills was one of the most popular. A few students even used on-line resources to learn TUTOR, the PLATO programming language, and a few wrote lessons on the system in the Zulu language.

PLATO was also used fairly extensively in South Africa for industrial training. Eskom successfully used PLM (PLATO learning management) and simulations to train power plant operators, South African Airways (SAA) used PLATO simulations for cabin attendant training, and there were a number of other large companies as well that were exploring the use of PLATO.

The South African subsidiary of CDC invested heavily in the development of an entire secondary school curriculum (SASSC) on PLATO, but unfortunately as the curriculum was nearing the final stages of completion, CDC began to falter in South Africa—partly because of financial problems back home, partly because of growing opposition in the United States to doing business in South Africa, and partly due to the rapidly evolving microcomputer, a paradigm shift that CDC failed to recognize.

=== Cyber1 ===
In August 2004, a version of PLATO corresponding to the final release from CDC was resurrected online. This version of PLATO runs on a free and open-source software emulation of the original CDC hardware called Desktop Cyber. Within six months, by word of mouth alone, more than 500 former users had signed up to use the system. Many of the students who used PLATO in the 1970s and 1980s felt a special social bond with the community of users who came together using the powerful communications tools (talk programs, records systems and notesfiles) on PLATO.

The PLATO software used on Cyber1 is the final release (99A) of CYBIS, by permission of VCampus. The underlying operating system is NOS 2.8.7, the final release of the NOS operating system, by permission of Syntegra (now British Telecom [BT]), which had acquired the remainder of CDC&#x27;s mainframe business. Cyber1 runs this software on the Desktop Cyber emulator. Desktop Cyber accurately emulates in software a range of CDC Cyber mainframe models and many peripherals.

Cyber1 offers free access to the system, which contains over 16,000 of the original lessons, in an attempt to preserve the original PLATO communities that grew up at CERL and on CDC systems in the 1980s. The load average of this resurrected system is about 10–15 users, sending personal and notesfile notes, and playing inter-terminal games such as &quot;Avatar&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot; (a &quot;Star Trek&quot;-like game), which had both accumulated more than 1.0 million contact hours on the original PLATO system at UIUC.

<doc id="1000485" wikidata="Q775545" url="?curid=1000485" title="Thomas Walker Gilmer">
<text>Thomas Walker Gilmer (April 6, 1802 – February 28, 1844) was an American statesman. He served in several political positions in Virginia, including election as the 28th Governor of Virginia. Gilmer&#x27;s final political office was as the 15th Secretary of the Navy, but he died in an accident ten days after assuming that position.

==Personal life==
Gilmer was born to George Gilmer and Elizabeth Anderson Hudson at their farm, &quot;Gilmerton&quot;, in Albemarle County, Virginia. He was taught by private tutors and his uncle Peachy Ridgeway Gilmer in Charlottesville and Staunton, and studied law in Liberty (now Bedford), Virginia.

Gilmer practiced law in Charlottesville. He was, briefly, editor of the &quot;Virginia Advocate&quot;, a Charlottesville newspaper.

On , Gilmer married Anne Elizabeth Baker of Shepherdstown, now in West Virginia. Her late father, John Baker, had been a member of the United States House of Representatives. They had nine children, including George Hudson Gilmer, a Presbyterian minister.

In 1829, Gilmer purchased Israel Jefferson, a former slave of Thomas Jefferson, who is best known for claiming that Sally Hemings was Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s concubine. Gilmer later agreed to let Israel pay his own purchase price for his freedom after Gilmer&#x27;s election to congress, as Israel desired to stay with his wife, a free woman.

==Political career==

Gilmer first served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1829 to 1836, representing Albemarle County. He returned in 1839–40 and was named Speaker.

On February 14, 1840, Gilmer was elected the 28th Governor of Virginia. While in office, he disagreed with the Virginia General Assembly over the extradition of slave stealers, which played a part in his running for Congress the following winter.

In March 1841, he entered the 27th Congress as a Whig, and after John Tyler unexpectedly ascended to the presidency, Gilmer voted to sustain Tyler&#x27;s vetoes of legislation favored by other Whigs. Gilmer was re-elected to the 28th Congress as a Democrat in 1842 by a close vote. His competitor, William L. Goggin, contested the result, but before the report of the investigating committee, which recommended that Gilmer be seated, could be acted on, Gilmer resigned from Congress to accept Tyler&#x27;s nomination as Secretary of the Navy. Goggin then won the special election to fill the vacant seat.

As one of President John Tyler&#x27;s close Virginia allies in Washington, Gilmer was involved in the effort by the Tyler Administration to make the annexation of Texas the basis for his failed bid for re-election in 1844. On February 15, 1844, he was appointed by Tyler to be the U.S. Secretary of the Navy, and resigned his seat in the Congress the next day to enter on the duties of the office; but, ten days later, he was killed by the bursting of a bow gun on board while on a tour of the Potomac River below Washington. His death meant the loss of a valuable ally for Tyler, and some historians suggest that it may have delayed the Texas Annexation effort.

===Electoral history===
In 1842, Gilmer was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives with 50.21% of the vote, defeating William Leftwich Goggin.

==Legacy==
Gilmer is buried at Mount Air Cemetery in Gilbert, Virginia.

A year after his death, Gilmer County, Virginia was named in his honor; it is now part of West Virginia.

The city of Gilmer, Texas, is also named for him. (Gilmer is the county seat of surrounding Upshur County, Texas, named after Abel Parker Upshur, (1790–1844), another victim of the explosion which had taken Gilmer&#x27;s life.)

Two ships of the United States Navy over the years have been named in his honor.

<doc id="1000508" wikidata="Q2013015" url="?curid=1000508" title="Haute-Provence Observatory">
<text>The Haute-Provence Observatory (OHP, ) is an astronomical observatory in the southeast of France, about 90 km east of Avignon and 100 km north of Marseille. It was established in 1937 as a national facility for French astronomers. Astronomical observations began in 1943 using the 1.20 m telescope, and the first research papers based on observations made at the observatory were published in 1944. Foreign observers first used the observatory in 1949, when Geoffrey and Margaret Burbidge visited.

The observatory lies at an altitude of about 650 m, on a plateau near the village of Saint-Michel-l&#x27;Observatoire in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence &quot;département&quot;.

The site was chosen for an observatory because of its generally very favourable observing conditions. On average, 60% of nights are suitable for astronomical observations, with the best seasons being summer and autumn. About 170 nights per year on average are completely cloudless. The seeing is usually around 2&quot; but can reach 1&quot; or lower on occasion. Seeing degrades severely, sometimes to over 10&quot;, when the cold Mistral wind blows from the northwest. This happens on about 45 days per year on average, mostly during winter. Good weather conditions often follow a Mistral. On average, atmospheric absorption at OHP is roughly twice that seen at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) at La Silla, Chile.

The main-belt asteroid 7755 Haute-Provence, discovered by Belgian astronomer Eric Elst in 1989, was named for the region where the discovering observatory is located.

== Telescopes ==

The four main telescopes at OHP are reflecting telescopes with primary mirrors of diameters 1.93 m, 1.52 m, 1.20 m and 0.80 m.

The 1.93 m telescope was built by Grubb-Parsons and installed at the site in 1958. One of the instruments available on the 1.93 m telescope was the high resolution ELODIE spectrograph, replaced in 2006 by the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph. Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz discovered the planet orbiting the star 51 Pegasi from observations made using ELODIE on the 1.93 m telescope. They won half of the Nobel Prize in Physics 2019 for this discovery.

The 1.52 m is almost identical to the 1.52 m telescope at the European Southern Observatory in Chile, and has been in use at OHP since 1967. It is predominantly used for spectroscopic studies, using the high resolution spectrograph &quot;Aurélie&quot;.

The 1.20 m telescope was the first to be installed at the site, and has been in use since 1943. It was originally installed at the Observatoire de Paris in 1872. It is now equipped with a direct charge-coupled device (CCD) camera at the f/6 Newton focus and is mainly used for studies of variability of X-ray sources, imaging of galaxies and H II regions and astrometry of faint solar system objects.

The 0.80 m telescope was first used during site testing at nearby Forcalquier in 1932 before the construction of the observatory, where it was later moved in 1945. The telescope is equipped with CCD cameras allowing high quality observations to be made using it, but unlike the other telescopes on site which have computer-controlled pointing systems, the 0.80 m telescope must still be pointed manually, using setting circles. It is often used by visiting undergraduate astronomy students.

Other telescopes at OHP are operated by other organizations, including a 1 m telescope belonging to Geneva Observatory, a 0.5 m telescope operated by the French Space Agency for satellite tracking, and the Berlin Exoplanet Search Telescope, a 0.2 m telescope used to search for exoplanets by observing transits across solar-type stars.

== Geophysics ==

While primarily an astronomical research facility, the observatory also hosts two geophysics research stations, one studying the mesosphere and thermosphere, and one using lasers to probe the troposphere and stratosphere, studying aerosol and ozone content, using lidar techniques.

== List of discovered minor planets ==
The Minor Planet Center credits the discovery of following minor planets directly to the observatory:

<doc id="1000522" wikidata="Q276372" url="?curid=1000522" title="Lee Bontecou">
<text>Lee Bontecou (January 15, 1931 – November 8, 2022) was an American sculptor and printmaker and a pioneer figure in the New York art world. She kept her work consistently in a recognizable style, and received broad recognition in the 1960s. Bontecou made abstract sculptures in the 1960s and 1970s and created vacuum-formed plastic fish, plants, and flower forms in the 1970s. Rich, organic shapes and powerful energy appear in her drawings, prints, and sculptures. Her work has been shown and collected in many major museums in the United States and in Europe.

==Early life and education==
Bontecou was born in Providence, Rhode Island. She had an older brother, Hank. Her father was a salesman and was involved with the development of the aluminum canoe. Her mother wired submarine parts during WWII. As a little girl, Bontecou spent time at the family&#x27;s cabin in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, where she first experimenting with sculpture, whittling animals out of wood. From the time Bontecou attended high school, she found herself focusing on sculpture; &quot;I avoided everything that was commercial art. I avoided having to make posters, and I avoided all of these... it was just not interesting to me. But I was always drawing at home, and making little clay stuff and little figures, little – anything that I could get my hands on. And I did enjoy the clay.&quot;

Bontecou attended Bradford Junior College (now Bradford College) in Haverhill, Massachusetts for her general education and then attended the Art Students League of New York from 1952 to 1955, where she studied with the sculptor William Zorach. She also spent the summer of 1954 at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine, where she learned to weld. She received a Fulbright scholarship from the U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission to study in Rome in 1957-1958. In 1971, she began teaching at Brooklyn College.

Bontecou&#x27;s work was deeply affected by WWII. Many of her sculptures were emotional responses to war. Describing her own work, Bontecou said ...&quot; I was angry...all of those- all the ones with the teeth- it was a thing of what that war was.&quot; Both her parents joined the war effort. Her mother wired transmitters for submarine navigation and her father sold gliders for the military. Later her husband, Bill Giles, would be a medic in the Korean War. 

==Career==
Bontecou was best known for the sculptures she created in 1959 and the 1960s, which challenged artistic conventions of both materials and presentation by hanging on the wall. They consist of welded steel frames covered with recycled canvas and industrial materials (such as conveyor belts or mail sacks) and other found objects. Her best constructions are at once mechanistic and organic, abstract but evocative of the brutality of war. Art critic Arthur Danto described them as &quot;fierce&quot;, reminiscent of 17th-century scientist Robert Hooke&#x27;s &quot;Micrographia&quot;, lying &quot;at the intersection of magnified insects, battle masks, and armored chariots...”. She was one of the first female artists to be exhibited at Leo Castelli&#x27;s art gallery in the 1960s, alongside Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, and Robert Rauschenberg. One of the largest examples of her work is located in the lobby of the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City, which was commissioned by the architect Philip Johnson. From the 1970s until 1991 she taught in the Art Department at Brooklyn College.

She continued to teach through the 1990s, while spending time in Pennsylvania. She moved to Orbisonia, Pennsylvania full-time in 1988 where she continued to work. There she maintained a vigorous studio practice, but showed infrequently. She was brought back to public attention by a 2003 retrospective co-organized by the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, that traveled to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 2004. The retrospective included both work from her public, art-world career and an extensive display of work done after retreating from the public view. Bontecou&#x27;s work was also included in the Carnegie International 2004-5 exhibit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 2010, the Museum of Modern Art presented a retrospective of Bontecou&#x27;s work entitled &quot;All Freedom in Every Sense.&quot; In 2014, her drawings were exhibited in &quot;Lee Bontecou: Drawn Worlds&quot;, organized by The Menil Collection, which traveled to the Princeton University Art Museum. Her work was also included in &quot;Revolution in the Making: Abstract Sculpture by Women, 1947-2016&quot; at Hauser Wirth &amp; Schimmel in 2016.

In 2017, a major exhibition of Bontecou&#x27;s drawings and sculpture, including a site-specific installation entitled &quot;Sandbox,&quot; a collaboration between Bontecou and Joan Banach, was organized by the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag. The exhibition was curated by Joan Banach and Laura Stamps, and accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue published by Hannibal (Dutch) and Koenig Books, London (English). The catalogue contains new essays on Lee Bontecou by Laura Stamps, Curator of Modern Art at The Gemeentemuseum, Joan Banach, and Jeremy Melius, with an introduction by Gemeentemuseum Director, Benno Tempel.

==Perspective==
In the 1960s, Bontecou&#x27;s work was hailed for its unique position in between painting and sculpture. Sculptor Donald Judd wrote that her work &quot;asserts its own existence, form and power. It becomes an object in its own right.&quot; The openness, autonomy, and engineering processes central to her work, were embraced by the Feminist Art Movement in the 1970s and her use of cavities and holes has been read as female genitalia, and the related, central core imagery. It is an association the artist denied. Her work has been characterized by references to the synergy between nature and fiction, resulting naturalistically rendered creatures, with grotesquely morphed features.

==Techniques and materials==
Bontecou worked with many materials, such as metal, paper, plastic, and fibreglass. She also worked with unconventional materials and discovered new techniques. In her drawings, she developed a process in the late 1950s of using an oxyacetylene torch to produce a carbon spray from the flame, resulting in an &quot;airbrushed&quot; look and deep saturated blacks that she took to her sculptural work.

==Personal life and death==
Bontecou was married to the artist William Giles with whom she had a daughter, Valerie.

Bontecou died in Florida on November 8, 2022, at the age of 91.

==Legacy and recognition==
In 1959, Bontecou received the Louis Comfort Tiffany Award. In 2004, she was elected into the National Academy of Design.

A picture of Bontecou working in her studio, taken by Italian photographer Ugo Mulas in 1963, was used as the cover art for Spoon’s 2007 album &quot;Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga&quot;. The apparently completed sculpture on the right in the aforementioned photograph is now in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art.

Bontecou&#x27;s image is included in the iconic 1972 poster Some Living American Women Artists by Mary Beth Edelson.

<doc id="1000530" wikidata="Q244165" url="?curid=1000530" title="Republic of Artsakh">
<text>Artsakh ( ), officially the Republic of Artsakh or the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh ( ), was a breakaway state in the South Caucasus whose territory was internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan. Between 1991 and 2023, Artsakh controlled parts of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast of the Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic, including its capital Stepanakert. It had been an enclave within Azerbaijan from the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war until the 2023 Azerbaijani offensive, when the Azerbaijani military took control over the remaining territory controlled by Artsakh. Its only overland access route to Armenia after the 2020 war was via the –wide Lachin corridor, which was placed under the supervision of Russian peacekeeping forces.

The predominantly Armenian-populated region of Nagorno-Karabakh was claimed by both the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic and the First Republic of Armenia when both countries became independent in 1918 after the fall of the Russian Empire. A brief war over the region broke out in 1920. The dispute was largely shelved after the Soviet Union established control over the area, and created the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) within the Azerbaijan SSR in 1923. Throughout the Soviet period, Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast were heavily discriminated against. The Soviet Azerbaijani authorities worked to suppress Armenian culture and identity in Nagorno-Karabakh, pressured Armenians to leave the region and encouraged Azerbaijanis to settle within it, although Armenians remained the majority population.

In the lead-up to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, the region re-emerged as a source of dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. In 1991, a referendum held in the NKAO and the neighbouring Shahumyan Province resulted in a declaration of independence. The conflict erupted into a full-out war in 1992. The war was won by Artsakh with support from Armenia. Although a ceasefire agreement was signed in 1994, the frozen situation left the predominantly Armenian-populated territory de facto independent, with a self-proclaimed government in Stepanakert, but still heavily reliant on and closely integrated with Armenia, in many ways functioning as a &quot;de facto&quot; part of Armenia. Even though Armenia never officially recognized the region&#x27;s independence, it became the main financial and military supporter of the territory. In 2017, a referendum in the area approved a new constitution that transformed the system of government from a semi-presidential to a presidential democracy with a unicameral legislature in addition to changing the name of the state from the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh to the Republic of Artsakh, although both names remained official.

From 1994 until 2020, Armenian and Azerbaijani troops remained separated by a contested line of contact which saw sporadic deadly incidents during the intervening years. In 2020, a new war was fought in the region, with Azerbaijan achieving victory and regaining all the surrounding occupied districts and a significant portion of Artsakh&#x27;s claimed territory. The Lachin corridor linking Artsakh to Armenia was blockaded by Azerbaijan in December 2022. In September 2023, Azerbaijan launched another military offensive. The government of Artsakh agreed to disarm and enter talks with Azerbaijan, prompting a flight of ethnic Armenians from the area. On 28 September 2023, the president of Artsakh signed a decree to dissolve all of the republic&#x27;s institutions by 1 January 2024, though the president later attempted to annul this decree. By 1 October 2023, almost the entire population of the region had fled to Armenia, marking the end of a millennia-old Armenian presence in Nagorno-Karabakh.

==Etymology==

According to scholars, inscriptions dating to the Urartian period mention the region under a variety of names: &quot;Ardakh&quot;, &quot;Urdekhe&quot;, and &quot;Atakhuni&quot;. In his &quot;Geography&quot;, the classical historian Strabo refers to an Armenian region which he calls &quot;Orchistene&quot;, which is believed by some to be a Greek version of the old name of Artsakh.

According to another hypothesis put forth by David M. Lang, the ancient name of Artsakh possibly derives from the name of King Artaxias I of Armenia (190–159 BC), founder of the Artaxiad dynasty and the kingdom of Greater Armenia.

Folk etymology holds that the name is derived from &quot;Ar&quot; (Aran) and &quot;tsakh&quot; (woods, garden) (i.e., the gardens of Aran Sisakean, the first nakharar of northeastern Armenia).

The name &quot;Nagorno-Karabakh&quot;, commonly used in English, comes from the Russian name which means &quot;Mountainous Karabakh&quot;. Karabakh is a Turkish/Persian word thought to mean &quot;black garden&quot;. The Azerbaijani name for the area, &quot;Dağlıq Qarabağ&quot;, has the same meaning as the Russian name. The term &quot;Artsakh&quot; lacks the non-Armenian influences present in &quot;Nagorno-Karabakh&quot;. Artsakh was revived for use in the 19th century, and was the preferred term used by the population, in English and Russian as well as Armenian. &quot;Mountainous Karabakh&quot; was sometimes employed directly as part of the official English name, &quot;Republic of Mountainous Karabakh&quot;. This reflected an attempt to shift away from the negative associations thought linked with &quot;Nagorno-Karabakh&quot; due to the war.

==History==

===Dissolution of the USSR; First Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988–1994)===
In the lead-up to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was revitalised. In 198788, a mass movement started in Nagorno-Karabakh and Soviet Armenia calling on the Soviet authorities to transfer the region to Armenia, citing self-determination laws in the Soviet constitution. Starting with the pogrom against Armenians in the Azerbaijani town of Sumgait in February 1988, the conflict became increasingly violent, and attempts by Moscow to resolve the dispute failed. In summer 1988, the legislatures of Soviet Armenia and the NKAO passed resolutions declaring the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia, which were rejected by Azerbaijani and central Soviet authorities.

Azerbaijan declared its independence from the Soviet Union on August 30, 1991, and Azerbaijan formally achieved its sovereignty following a referendum on September 21, 1991. Later, on November 27, 1991, the parliament revoked the autonomous status of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, prompting local leaders to call for a referendum on independence from Azerbaijan on December 10, 1991. The result saw approximately 99 percent of ethnic Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh region vote for separation. Artur Mkrtchyan was chosen as president of the Nagorno-Karabakh region following parliamentary elections on December 28, 1991. On January 2, 1992, President Ayaz Mutallibov of Azerbaijan placed the Nagorno-Karabakh region under direct presidential control, and Nagorno-Karabakh formally declared its independence from Azerbaijan on January 6, 1992.

The declaration was rejected by newly independent Azerbaijan, leading to the outbreak of full-scale war with Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh on one side and Azerbaijan on the other. The First Nagorno-Karabakh War ended with a ceasefire in May 1994, with Armenian forces controlling practically the entire territory of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast as well as most of seven adjacent districts of Azerbaijan. According to UNHCR, the conflict resulted in over 600,000 internally displaced people within Azerbaijan.

===De facto post-war independence (1994–2020)===
The Republic of Artsakh became a de facto independent country, though closely integrated with Armenia, while its territory remained internationally recognised as part of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Professor Matt Qvortrup considered it hypocritical that Western Europe countries had eagerly recognised the succession of several states from Yugoslavia, ignoring the laws of territorial integrity, but simultaneously did not show the same interest for the Nagorno-Karabakh referendum, noting &quot;the practice of independence referendums seemingly owes more to national interest than to adherence to principles of jurisprudence&quot;.

Intermittent fighting over the region continued after the 1994 ceasefire without significant territorial changes, while long-standing international mediation attempts to create a peace process were initiated by the OSCE Minsk Group in 1994.

===Second Nagorno-Karabakh War (2020), Azerbaijan gains===
On 27 September 2020, a war broke out between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Artsakh. Fighting continued until November, and Azerbaijan recaptured territories, primarily in the southern part of the region, as well as the strategic town of Shushi. A ceasefire agreement signed on 10 November 2020 between Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia declared an end to the renewed fighting, and established that Armenia would withdraw from remaining occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh over the next month. The agreement included provisions for a Russian peacekeeping force to deploy to the region, with Russian President Vladimir Putin stating that the ceasefire agreement would &quot;create the conditions for a long-term settlement&quot;. The war may have claimed thousands of lives.

===Aftermath of 2020 war===
After the 2020 war, the Republic of Artsakh maintained control over the areas of the former oblast that had not been captured during the war.

In 2021, Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia held a trilateral meeting about Artsakh. This was expected to be the first of a regular series of meetings between the three countries, per an agreement to promote economic and infrastructure development throughout the region.

===Blockade (2022–2023)===
In December 2022, Azerbaijanis claiming to be environmental activists blocked the Lachin corridor, the sole road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia and the outside world. On 23 April 2023, Azerbaijani forces installed a checkpoint on the Lachin corridor. The blockade led to a humanitarian crisis for the population in Artsakh; imports of essential goods were blocked, as well as humanitarian convoys of the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers, trapping the 120,000 residents of the region. Limited traffic was conducted by Russian peacekeepers and the International Committee of the Red Cross to transport patients in need of medical care and provide humanitarian supplies. However, from 15 June 2023, Azerbaijan intensified the blockade, blocking all passage of food, fuel, and medicine from the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers through the Lachin corridor.

===2023 Azerbaijani offensive, exodus, and dissolution===


On 19 September, Azerbaijan launched a military offensive into Artsakh-controlled territory. The following day, the government of the Republic of Artsakh agreed to disarm and a ceasefire took effect. Initial negotiations between representatives of the Karabakh Armenian community and the Government of Azerbaijan took place on 21 September in Yevlakh to discuss security, rights and &quot;integration&quot;. The talks, which lasted two hours, ended without a formal agreement; however, a statement by Azerbaijani Presidency said that they were &quot;constructive and positive&quot; and that further negotiations would continue. On 24 September, a mass evacuation of ethnic-Armenian civilians started, fearing persecution and ethnic cleansing if they remained. A second round of negotiations between representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians and Azerbaijan took place in Khojaly on 25 September, where humanitarian issues were discussed. A third meeting between took place in Yevlakh on 29 September.

On 28 September, Artsakh president Samvel Shahramanyan signed a decree stating that all state institutions would be dissolved by 1 January 2024, bringing the existence of the republic to an end. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev visited the region on 15 October and officially raised the flag of Azerbaijan at the building that was previously used as the Artsakh Presidential Palace. On 22 December 2023, Shahramanyan said that there was no official document stipulating the dissolution of government institutions, and his office stated that it was &quot;empty paper&quot;.

==Geography==

The Artsakh Republic was mountainous, a feature which has given it its former name (from the Russian for &quot;Mountainous/Highland Karabakh&quot;). It is in area. The largest water body is the Sarsang Reservoir, and the major rivers are the Tartar and Khachen rivers. The country is on a plateau which slopes downwards towards the east and southeast, with the average altitude being above sea level. Most rivers in the country flow towards the Artsakh Valley.

The geology of Artsakh is primarily part of the Kussary-Divichi Foredeepthe northern foredeep of the Greater Caucasus. The trough is filled with Oligocene to Quaternary age deepwater, molasse and marine sedimentary rocks.

The climate is mild and temperate. The average temperature is , which fluctuates annually between in July and in January. The average precipitation can reach in some regions, and it is foggy for over 100 days a year. Over 2,000 kinds of plants exist in Artsakh, and more than 36% of the country is forested. The plant life on the steppes consists mostly of semi-desert vegetation, while subalpine zone and alpine tundra ecosystems can be found above the forest in the highlands and mountains.

==Government and politics==

Artsakh was a presidential democracy (transformed from a semi-presidential one, after the 2017 referendum). The Prime Minister&#x27;s post was abolished and executive power resided with the President who was both the head of state and head of government. The president was directly elected for a maximum of two-consecutive five-year terms. The last President was Samvel Shahramanyan.

The National Assembly was a unicameral legislature. It had 33 members who were elected for 5-year terms. Elections took place within a multi-party system; in 2009, the American NGO Freedom House ranked the Republic of Artsakh above the republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan with respect to civil and political rights. Five parties had members in the parliament: the Free Motherland party had 15 members, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation had 8 members, Democratic Party of Artsakh had 7 members, Movement 88 had 2 members and the National Revival party had one member. A number of non-partisan candidates had also taken part in the elections, with some success; in 2015, two of the 33 members to the National Assembly took their seats without running under the banner of any of the established political parties in the republic. Elections in Artsakh were not recognised by the European Union, the United States and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, as well as numerous other countries, who called them a source of increased tensions.

Artsakh was heavily dependent on Armenia, and in many ways &quot;de facto&quot; functioned and was administered as part of Armenia. However, Armenia was hesitant to officially recognise Artsakh.

===Constitution===

The founding documents of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic were the &quot;Proclamation of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic&quot; and the &quot;Declaration of State Independence of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic&quot;. For a long time no constitution was created, with the republic instead declaring Armenian law applied on its territory through a 1992 law. Even when new laws were passed, they were often copies of equivalent Armenian laws.

On 3 November 2006, the then-president of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, Arkadi Ghukasyan, signed a decree to hold a referendum on a draft Nagorno-Karabakh constitution. It was held on 10 December of the same year and according to official preliminary results, with a turnout of 87.2%, as many as 98.6 per cent of voters approved the constitution. The first article of the document described the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, alternatively called the Republic of Artsakh, as &quot;a sovereign, democratic state based on social justice and the rule of law.&quot; More than 100 non-governmental international observers and journalists who monitored the poll evaluated it positively, stating that it was held to a high international standard.

However, the vote was criticised harshly by the European Union, OSCE and GUAM, which rejected the referendum, deeming it illegitimate. The EU announced it was &quot;aware that a &#x27;constitutional referendum&#x27; has taken place,&quot; but emphasised its stance that only a negotiated settlement between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenians could bring a lasting solution. Secretary General of the Council of Europe Terry Davis asserted that the poll &quot;will not be recognized... and is therefore of no consequence&quot;.
In a statement, the OSCE chairman in office Karel De Gucht voiced his concern that the vote would prove harmful to the ongoing conflict settlement process, which, he said, had shown &quot;visible progress&quot; and was at a &quot;promising juncture&quot;.

The holding of the referendum was also criticised by Turkey, which traditionally supports Azerbaijan because of common ethnic Turkic roots, and has historically had severe tensions with Armenia.

Another referendum was held on 20 February 2017, with an 87.6% vote in favour on a 76% turnout for instituting a new constitution. This constitution among other changes turned the government from a semi-presidential to a fully presidential model. Its name was changed from &quot;Constitution of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic&quot; to &quot;Constitution of the Republic of Artsakh&quot;, though both remained official names of the country. The referendum was seen as a response to the 2016 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes.

===Administrative divisions===
Artsakh was divided into seven provinces and one special administrative city. According to its authorities, it consisted of the territories in which the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic was proclaimed in 1991: the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO), the Shahumyan Region and the Getashen subdistrict; and those territories that formed part of the Republic of Artsakh before the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War. Also claimed by Artsakh was the Shahumyan Region of the Azerbaijan SSR, which has been under Azerbaijani control since the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. While the Shahumyan Region was not part of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, representatives from Shahumyan declared independence along with the Oblast, and the proclamation of Artsakh includes the Shahumyan region within its borders.

After the end of the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, an agreement was signed according to which most of the controlled territories of the Republic of Artsakh were transferred to Azerbaijani control, but the Republic of Artsakh continues to claim these territories.

Following the Republic of Artsakh&#x27;s declaration of independence, the Azerbaijani government abolished the NKAO and created Azerbaijani districts in its place. As a result, some of Artsakh&#x27;s divisions corresponded with the Azerbaijani districts, while others had different borders.


===Law enforcement===
Law enforcement in Artsakh was inconsistent, as the region was a de facto independent republic and officially part of Azerbaijan. Law enforcement in Nagorno-Karabakh was the responsibility of the Interior Ministry and the NSS.

====Police of Artsakh====

After the annexation of Artsakh to the Azerbaijan SSR, on 4 August 1923, the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast was established. In the years following the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, the Republic of Artsakh created its own police force. In 2001, the National Assembly&#x27;s law &quot;On Police&quot; was adopted on 30 November 2006. On 11 March 2014, Police Day in Artsakh was declared for 16 April. The police force followed an organization similar to that of the Police of Armenia.

====National Security Service====
Artsakh had its own National Security Service, based on the NSS of Armenia. It was a republican body that elaborated and implemented the policies of the government in the national security sector. By decree of the NKR Supreme Council adopted on 18 January 2006, the NKAO State Security Department was named the State Department of National Security under the NKR Council of Ministers. By order of the NKR National Assembly on 26 November 2003, the NKR laws &quot;On National Security Bodies&quot; and &quot;On Service in National Security Bodies&quot; were adopted. The activities of the NSS were based in the decrees of 25 September 2012. The NSS was headed by Lieutenant General Kamo Aghajanyan.

===Military===
According to the Constitution of Artsakh, the army was under the civilian command of the government. The Artsakh Defense Army was officially established on 9 May 1992 as a defence against Azerbaijan, but was subsequently disbanded on 21 September 2023 under the terms of Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement following the 2023 Azerbaijani military offensive.

It fought the Azerbaijani army to a ceasefire on 12 May 1994. At its peak, the Artsakh Defense Army consisted of around 18,000–20,000 officers and soldiers. However, only around 8,500 citizens from Artsakh served in the army; some 10,000 came from Armenia. There were also 177–316 tanks, 256–324 additional fighting vehicles, and 291–322 guns and mortars. Armenia supplied arms and other military necessities to Artsakh. Several battalions of Armenia&#x27;s army were deployed directly in the Artsakh zone on occupied Azerbaijani territory.

The Artsakh Defense Army fought in Shusha in 1992, opening the Lachin corridor between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh (1992), and staged the defence of the Martakert front from 1992 to 1994.

===Foreign relations===

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was based in Stepanakert. Since no UN member or observer ever recognised Artsakh, none of its foreign relations were of an official diplomatic nature. However, the Republic of Artsakh operated five permanent Missions and one Bureau of Social-Politic Information in France. Artsakh&#x27;s Permanent Missions existed in Armenia, Australia, France, Germany, Russia, the United States, and one for Middle East countries based in Beirut. The goals of the offices were to present the Republic&#x27;s positions on various issues, to provide information and to facilitate the peace process.

In his 2015 speech, the President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan stated that he considered Nagorno-Karabakh &quot;an inseparable part of Armenia&quot;.

The Republic of Artsakh was neither a member nor observer of the UN or any of its specialised agencies. However, it was a member of the Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations, commonly known as the &quot;Commonwealth of Unrecognized States&quot;.

While no UN member states recognised Artsakh, some unrecognised and partially recognised states had done so, including Transnistria, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Various sub-national governments, including several U.S. states, had issued calls for recognition of Artsakh by their national governments.

==De facto independent Artsakh (1993–2023): conflicting ideologies and diplomacy==
===Artsakh–Armenia relations===

Artsakh was a &quot;de facto&quot; independent state, calling itself the &quot;Republic of Artsakh&quot;. It had close relations with Armenia and used the same currency, the dram. According to Human Rights Watch, &quot;from the beginning of the Karabakh conflict, Armenia provided aid, weapons, and volunteers. Armenian involvement in Artsakh escalated after a December 1993 Azerbaijani offensive. The Republic of Armenia began sending conscripts and regular Army and Interior Ministry troops to fight in Artsakh.&quot; The politics of Armenia and the de facto Artsakh are so intertwined that Robert Kocharyan served as the first President of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, from 1994 to 1997, then as prime minister of Armenia from 1997 to 1998, and then as the second President of Armenia, from 1998 to 2008.

However, Armenian governments have repeatedly resisted internal pressure to unite the two, due to ongoing negotiations under the auspices of the OSCE Minsk Group. In his case study of Eurasia, Dov Lynch of the Institute for Security Studies of WEU believes that &quot;Karabakh&#x27;s independence allows the new Armenian state to avoid the international stigma of aggression, despite the fact that Armenian troops fought in the war between 1991 and 1994 and continue to man the Line of Contact between Karabakh and Azerbaijan.&quot; Lynch also cites that the &quot;strength of the Armenian armed forces, and Armenia&#x27;s strategic alliance with Russia, are seen as key shields protecting the Karabakh state by the authorities in Stepanakert&quot;. Some sources consider Artsakh as functioning &quot;de facto&quot; as a part of Armenia.

===Negotiations, outside mediation (2001–2007)===
====2001 Paris, Key West talks====
Representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan, France, Russia and the United States met in Paris and in Key West, Florida, in early 2001. Despite rumours that the parties were close to a solution, the Azerbaijani authorities – both during Heydar Aliyev&#x27;s period of office, and after the accession of his son Ilham Aliyev in the October 2003 elections – have firmly denied that any agreement was reached in Paris or Key West.

====2004 Astana talks====
Further talks between the Azerbaijani and Armenian presidents, Ilham Aliyev and Robert Kocharyan, were held in September 2004 in Astana, Kazakhstan, on the sidelines of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) summit. Reportedly, one of the suggestions put forward was the withdrawal of the occupying forces from the Azeri territories adjacent to Artsakh and then holding referendums (plebiscites) in Artsakh and Azerbaijan proper regarding the future status of the region.

====2006 Rambouillet talks====
On 10 and 11 February 2006, Kocharyan and Aliyev met in Rambouillet, France, to discuss the fundamental principles of a settlement to the conflict. Contrary to the initial optimism, the Rambouillet talks did not produce any agreement, with key issues such as the status of Artsakh and whether Armenian troops would withdraw from Kalbajar still being contentious.

====2006 Bucharest meeting====
Talks were held at the Polish embassy in Bucharest in June 2006. Again, American, Russian, and French diplomats attended the talks that lasted over 40 minutes. Earlier, Armenian President Kocharyan announced that he was ready to &quot;continue dialogue with Azerbaijan for the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and with Turkey on establishing relations without any preconditions&quot;.

According to the Armenian foreign minister in 2006, Vardan Oskanyan, no progress was made at this latest meeting. Both presidents failed to reach a consensus on the issues from the earlier Rambouillet conference. He noted that the Kocharyan-Aliyev meeting was held in a normal atmosphere. &quot;Nevertheless,&quot; he added, &quot;the foreign ministers of the two countries are commissioned to continue talks over the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and try to find common points before the next meeting of the presidents.&quot;

The major disagreement between both sides at the Bucharest conference was the status of Artsakh. Azerbaijan&#x27;s preferred solution would be to give Artsakh the &quot;highest status of autonomy adopted in the world&quot;. Armenia, on the other hand, endorsed a popular vote by the inhabitants of Artsakh to decide their future, a position that was also taken by the international mediators. On 27 June, the Armenian foreign minister said both parties agreed to allow the residents of Artsakh to vote regarding the future status of the region. The Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially refuted that statement. According to Azeri opposition leader Isa Gambar, Azerbaijan did indeed agree to the referendum, but his claim was never substantiated.

====2006 Prague Process====
The &quot;Prague Process&quot; overseen by the OSCE Minsk Group was brought into sharp relief in the summer of 2006 with a series of rare public revelations seemingly designed to jump-start the stalled negotiations. After the release in June of a paper outlining its position, which had until then been carefully guarded, U.S. State Department official Matthew Bryza told Radio Free Europe that the Minsk Group favoured a referendum in Karabakh that would determine its final status. The referendum, in the view of the OSCE, should take place not in Azerbaijan as a whole, but in Artsakh only. This was a blow to Azerbaijan, and despite talk that their government might eventually seek a more sympathetic forum for future negotiations, this did not occur.

====2007 Azerbaijan&#x27;s PKK claim====
On 10 December 2007 Azerbaijan&#x27;s deputy foreign minister said Azerbaijan would be prepared to conduct anti-terrorist operations in Nagorno-Karabakh against alleged bases of the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK). Armenian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Vladimir Karapetian previously rejected the allegations as &quot;fabricated&quot; and suggested the accusations of the PKK presence were a form of provocation.

===Armenian, Artsakh fundamental positions (c. 2007–10)===
Armenia did not recognise Azerbaijani claims to Nagorno-Karabakh and believed the territory should have self-determination. Both the Armenian and Artsakhi governments emphasized that the independence of Artsakh was declared around the time the Soviet Union dissolved and its members became independent. The Armenian government insisted that the government of Artsakh be part of any discussions on the region&#x27;s future, and rejected ceding occupied territory or allowing refugees to return before talks on the region&#x27;s status.

In 2009, the president of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Bako Sahakyan declared that &quot;Artsakh will never be a part of Azerbaijan. Artsakh security should never be an article of commerce either. As to other issues, we are ready to discuss them with Azerbaijan&quot;. In 2010 president of Republic of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan in his speech in the Chatham House of the British Royal Institute of International Affairs declared that &quot;Karabakh was never a part of independent Azerbaijan: it was annexed to Azerbaijan by a decision of the Soviet Union party body. The people of Karabakh never put up with this decision, and upon the first opportunity, seceded from the Soviet Union fully in line with the laws of the Soviet Union and the applicable international law&quot;.

===Aliyev: fundamental position on Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh (2008)===
In 2008, Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev stated that &quot;Nagorno-Karabakh will never be independent; the position is backed by international mediators as well; Armenia has to accept the reality&quot; and that &quot;in 1918, Yerevan was granted to the Armenians. It was a great mistake. The khanate of Iravan was Azeri territory, the Armenians were guests here&quot;.

===UN, EU, Minsk Group diplomacy (2008–10)===
On 14 March 2008, the United Nations General Assembly passed a non-binding resolution by a vote of 39 to 7, with 100 abstentions, reaffirming Azerbaijan&#x27;s territorial integrity, expressing support for that country&#x27;s internationally recognised borders and demanding the immediate withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all occupied territories there. The resolution was supported mainly by members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and GUAM. Azerbaijan is a member of both groups, which include other nations facing breakaway regions. The resolution was opposed by all three members of the OSCE Minsk Group.

On 20 May 2010, the European Parliament adopted a resolution &quot;on the need for an EU strategy for the South Caucasus&quot;, which states that the EU must pursue a strategy to promote stability, prosperity and conflict resolution in the South Caucasus. The resolution &quot;calls on the parties to intensify their peace talk efforts for the purpose of a settlement in the coming months, to show a more constructive attitude and to abandon preferences to perpetuate the status quo created by force and with no international legitimacy, creating in this way instability and prolonging the suffering of the war-affected populations; condemns the idea of a military solution and the heavy consequences of military force already used, and calls on both parties to avoid any further breaches of the 1994 ceasefire&quot;. The resolution also calls for the withdrawal of Armenian forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan, accompanied by the deployment of international forces to be organised with respect of the UN Charter in order to provide the necessary security guarantees in a period of transition, which will ensure the security of the population of Artsakh and allow the displaced people to return to their homes and further conflicts caused by homelessness to be prevented; and states that the EU believes that the position according to which Artsakh includes all occupied Azerbaijani lands surrounding Artsakh should rapidly be abandoned. It also notes &quot;that an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh could offer a solution until the final status is determined and that it could create a transitional framework for peaceful coexistence and cooperation of Armenian and Azerbaijani populations in the region.&quot;

On 26 June 2010, the presidents of the OSCE Minsk Group&#x27;s co-chair countries, France, Russia, and United States made a joint statement, reaffirming their &quot;commitment to support the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan as they finalize the Basic Principles for the peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict&quot;.

===Armenian position (2019)===
During his August 2019 visit to Stepanakert, the Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan presented the strategic development goals set for Armenia for the next three decades. He added that he made no special provision for Nagorno-Karabakh because &quot;Artsakh is Armenia and there is no alternative&quot;. Soon afterwards, Armenia&#x27;s Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan commented on Pashinyan&#x27;s statement by saying he had &quot;nothing to add&quot; to Pashinyan&#x27;s formulation of Armenia&#x27;s position in the conflict.

== Displacement, landmines problem during conflict (1988–2023) ==

===Displaced people===
====Azeri and other non-Armenian refugees====
The first Nagorno-Karabakh conflict resulted in the displacement of 597,000 Azerbaijanis (this figure includes 230,000 children born to internally displaced people (IDPs) and 54,000 who had returned) including Artsakh, and 220,000 Azeris, 18,000 Kurds and 3,500 Russians fled from Armenia to Azerbaijan from 1988 to 1989. The Azerbaijani government estimated that 63% of IDPs lived below the poverty line, compared to 49% of the total population. About 154,000 lived in the capital, Baku. According to the International Organization for Migration, 40,000 IDPs lived in camps, 60,000 in dugout shelters, and 20,000 in railway cars. Forty-thousand IDPs lived in EU-funded settlements and UNHCR provided housing for another 40,000. Another 5,000 IDPs lived in abandoned or rapidly deteriorating schools. Others lived in trains, on roadsides in half-constructed buildings, or in public buildings such as tourist and health facilities. Tens of thousands lived in seven tent camps where poor water supply and sanitation caused gastrointestinal infections, tuberculosis, and malaria.

The government required IDPs to register their place of residence in an attempt to better target the limited and largely inadequate national and international assistance due to the Armenian advocated and US imposed restrictions on humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan. Many IDPs were from rural areas and found it difficult to integrate into the urban labour market. Many international humanitarian agencies reduced or ceased assistance for IDPs citing increasing oil revenues of the country. The infant mortality among displaced Azerbaijani children was 3–4 times higher than in the rest of the population. The rate of stillbirth was 88.2 per 1,000 births among the internally displaced people. As of 2003, the majority of the displaced had lived in difficult conditions for more than 13 years.

During the 2020 war President Aliyev stated he intended for refugees to return to the area. While many former cities are currently uninhabitable, the Azerbaijani government and some Azerbaijani companies have announced plans to rebuild infrastructure and invest in the newly controlled territories. The Azerbaijani military is clearing mines prior to resettlement, which may take 10–13 years.

====Armenian refugees====

280,000 peoplevirtually all ethnic Armenians who fled Azerbaijan during the 1988–1993 war over the disputed region of Artsakhwere living in refugee-like circumstances in Armenia. Some left the country, principally to Russia. Their children born in Armenia acquire citizenship automatically. Their numbers are thus subject to constant decline due to departure, and de-registration required for naturalisation. Of these, about 250,000 fled Azerbaijan (areas outside Nagorno-Karabakh); approximately 30,000 came from Nagorno-Karabakh. All were registered with the government as refugees at year&#x27;s end.

===Land mines===

Mines were laid in the region from 1991 to 1994 by both conflicting parties in the first Nagorno-Karabakh War. In 2005, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) claimed that 123 people had been killed and over 300 injured by landmines near Nagorno-Karabakh since the 1994 truce.

HALO Trust, a UK-based demining NGO, was the only international organisation conducting demining in Nagorno-Karabakh. They destroyed 180,858 small arms ammunition, 48,572 units of &quot;other explosive items&quot;, 12,423 cluster bombs, 8,733 anti-personnel landmines, and 2,584 anti-tank landmines between 2000 and 2016. By 2018, they had cleared 88% of the territory&#x27;s minefields, with a target to clear the rest by 2020. The main cities of Stepanakert and Shusha, as well as the main north–south highway, had been cleared and were safe for travel. The demining effort had been largely funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

==Economy==

The socio-economic situation of the Republic of Artsakh was greatly affected by the 1991–1994 conflict. Yet, foreign investments began to come. The origin of most venture capital comes from Armenians in Armenia, Russia, United States, France, Australia, Iran, and the Middle East.

Notably the telecommunications sector was developed with Karabakh Telecom investing millions of dollars in mobile telephony, spearheaded by a Lebanese company. Karabakh Telecom was disconnected from external communication on 27 September 2023, calls and internet traffic to the Nagorno-Karabakh region are carried out from then on only through telecom operators and providers of Azerbaijan.

Copper and gold mining has been advancing since 2002 with development and launch of operations at Drmbon deposit. Approximately 27–28 thousand tons (wet weight) of concentrates are produced with average copper content of 19–21% and gold content of 32–34 g/t. Azerbaijan considers any mining operations in Nagorno-Karabakh illegal and has vowed to engage an international audit company to determine the damages suffered by Azerbaijan&#x27;s state-run ore management company as a result. In 2018, the government of Azerbaijan announced that it was planning to appeal to an international court and the law enforcement agencies of the countries where the mining companies involved are registered.

The banking system was administered by Artsakhbank (a Yerevan-based Armenian bank fulfilling the functions of the state bank of Nagorno-Karabakh) and a number of other Armenian banks. The republic used the Armenian dram.

Wine growing and processing of agricultural products, particularly wine (i.e., storage of wine, wine stuffs, cognac alcohol) was one of the prioritised directions of the economic development.

===Tourism===

The republic developed a tourist industry geared to Armenia and the Armenian diaspora. The republic showed a major increase in tourists over the last several years of its existence because of Artsakh&#x27;s many cultural sights. Before the 2020 war there were nine hotels in Stepanakert. The Artsakh development agency said 4,000 tourists visited Artsakh in 2005. The figures rose to 8,000 in 2010 (excluding visitors from Armenia). The agency cooperated with the Armenia Tourism Development Agency (ATDA) as Armenia is the only way tourists (mainly Armenians) could access Artsakh. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Artsakh reported continuous expansion of visitors&#x27; geography. Tourist infrastructure was developed around sites such as monasteries that showcase the Armenian history in the region, with Islamic sites rarely restored, while some ghost cities and areas near the front line were off limit to tourists.

The Tourism Development Agency of Artsakh was established in Yerevan as a non-governmental organisation in the Republic of Armenia to promote tourism further in Artsakh. It made preparations for tour operators, travel agencies and journalists covering the region, and arranges for hotel services, shopping, catering, recreation centers.

Tourist attractions included:
* Gandzasar monastery, main tourist attraction.
* Ghazanchetsots Cathedral of the Holy Savior (Under Azerbaijani control since 2020 war)
* Church of the Holy Mother of God &quot;Kanach Zham&quot; (Under Azerbaijani control since 2020 war)
* Amaras Monastery
* Tsitsernavank Monastery (Under Azerbaijani control since 2020 war)
* St. Yeghishe Arakyal Monastery
* Dadivank Monastery
* Gtichavank monastery (Under Azerbaijani control since 2020 war)
* Bri Yeghtsi monastery
* Yerits Mankants
* Katarovank Monastery (Under Azerbaijani control since 2020 war)

Other tourist attractions included:
* Fort Mayraberd (10th–18th centuries) served as the primary bulwark against Turko-nomadic incursions from the eastern steppe. The fort is found to the east of the region&#x27;s capital city of Stepanakert.
* Govharagha Mosque (18th century), a mosque located in the city of Shusha, now under Azerbaijani control.

Janapar Trail is a marked trail, through mountains, valleys, and villages of Artsakh, with monasteries and fortresses along the way. It is not hikable since the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War. The trail was broken into day hikes, which brought tourists to a different village each night. The paths have existed for centuries but now are marked specifically for hikers. The Himnakan Janapar (backbone trail), marked in 2007, leads from the northwest region of Shahumian to the southern town of Hadrut, now under Azerbaijani control. Side trails and mini trails take one to additional parts of Artsakh. The important sites passed along this hike include Dadivank Monastery, Gandzasar monastery, Shusha, the Karkar Canyon with its high cliffs, Zontik Waterfall, and the ruins of Hunot and Gtichavank monastery.

One of the noteworthy side trails is the Gtichavank Loop Trail. This loop starts from Tugh Village, now under Azerbaijani control.

However, those who travelled to Artsakh without the Azerbaijani government&#x27;s prior consent and permission were denied entry to Azerbaijan since the country considered Artsakh their territory unlawfully occupied by the Armenian army. The Azerbaijani government also kept and published online a list of foreign nationals who visited these occupied areas without prior approval. In late 2017, the list contained 699 names with additional details (date, country, profession, purpose of visit). The earliest entry recorded a visit to Artsakh that occurred on an unspecified date sometime between 1993 and 1996. The list included many journalists and members of parliaments of foreign countries.

==== Artsakh Wine Fest ====
Before the 2020 war, the Artsakh Wine Fest took place annually in Togh since 2014. The festival was held on the third Saturday of each September.

The festival was initiated by the Department of Tourism and Protection of Historical Places of the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Youth Affairs of the Republic of Artsakh and was aimed to develop tourism in Artsakh. It was meant to restore Artsakh winemaking traditions. The festival provided a platform to the winemakers of Artsakh and Armenia giving them an opportunity to sell their products, exchange knowledge, promote their wine etc. The annual festival&#x27;s program included grape stomping, tasting of traditional Artsakh cuisine, an exhibition of artworks, an exhibition of ancient artefacts that belonged to the Melik Yegan&#x27;s Palace, as well as an exhibition and sale of local wine, where one could find products from 5 different regions of Artsakh and Armenia. Traditionally, the festival was accompanied by Armenian national singing and dancing. The festival evolved into a national holiday.

===Transportation===
The transportation system had been damaged by the 1991–1994 conflict. The North–South Artsakh motorway alone largely facilitated the development of the transportation system. Before the 2020 war, the Hadrut-Stepanakert-Askeran-Martakert motorway was the lifeline of Artsakh, and $25 million donated during the Hayastan All-Armenian Foundation telethons was allotted for the construction of the road. A new route from the Armenian capital Yerevan to Stepanakert was planned to bypass the 8–9 hours drive via the Lachin corridor. It was opened in September 2017. A third road was planned in 2019. 

Authorities in the USSR opened a railway line in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast in 1944. It connected the capital, Stepanakert, and Yevlax in Azerbaijan. It was built to Russian gauge of 1520mm. Due to the first Nagorno-Karabakh War, the line the railway was badly damaged and the line was closed.

Stepanakert Airport, the sole civilian airport of the Republic of Artsakh, located about east of the capital, has been closed since the onset of the war in 1990. It was expected that the airport would have regular flight services only to Yerevan, Armenia, with state-owned carrier Artsakh Air, but no flights had ever started.

===Communications===
Karabakh Telecom (KT), the only telecommunications company in Artsakh, was started on February 1, 2002 by the Lebanese-Armenian businessman and Chairman Pierre Fattouch. In 2019, Fattouch was charged with tax evasion in Lebanon and in July 2019 a Lebanese Prosecutor General ordered a closure of quarries owned by Fattouch for failure to acquire a legal license. On December 10, 2020, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) investigated the offshore firm Crossbridge Capital, which manages billions in shareholder assets, including those of Pierre Fattouch. KT was also run by the General Director Ralf Yerikian, a Lebanese-born businessman of Armenian origin. The company was considered a CJSC, a closed joint stock company, in which shares of company stock can be bought or sold by shareholders. The company had USD $9.9 million in revenue in the 4th quarter of 2019. From Q1 of 2020 until Q2 of 2021, it shared the same amount in revenue for every quarter – USD $11.1 million. The company has not publicly disclosed their accurate financials between 2020 and 2021. It has invested over USD $12 millions in mobile telecommunication projects throughout Artsakh.

==Demographics==


In September 2023, over half of Artsakh&#x27;s ethnic Armenian population fled the country. According to Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, 100,417 people arrived in Armenia from Artsakh. In 2015, the country&#x27;s population was 145,000, made up of 99.7% Armenians. This composition represents a sharp change from the 1979 and 1989 census, when the Azerbaijani population was 23 and 21.5 per cent, respectively. The annual birth rate was recorded at 2,200–2,300 per year, an increase from nearly 1,500 in 1999.

OSCE report, released in March 2011, estimates the population of the &quot;seven occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh&quot; to be 14,000, and states &quot;there has been no significant growth in the population since 2005.&quot; An International Crisis Group report published in December 2019 recorded the population of these territories to be 17,000, or 11.48% of the total population: 15,000 west and southwest of the former oblast, and 2000 in the Agdam District.

Until 2000, the country&#x27;s net migration was at a negative. For the first half of 2007, 1,010 births and 659 deaths were reported, with a net emigration of 27.

According to age group: 15,700 (0–6), 25,200 (7–17) 75,800 (18–59) and 21,000 (60+)

Population by province (2006):
* Stepanakert 54,500 (2013)
* Martuni 23,200
* Martakert 19,000
* Askeran 17,400 (2007)
* Hadrut 12,300 (2009)
* Kashatagh 9,800
* Shushi 5,000 (2009)
* Shahumyan 2,800

Population of the Republic of Artsakh (2000–2008)
===Resettlement attempts after 1994===
From 1989 to 1994, there was significant depopulation in the territory that ended up held by Artsakh, leaving only around 40% of the pre-war population. Much of this was due to the displacement and death of Azerbaijani residents in both the former NKOA and the surrounding territories, leaving some former urban areas virtually empty. The Russian minority present also declined, meaning the resulting population was almost 100% Armenian. Beginning in 1995, the population began to increase due to births and immigration.

While the territory captured outside the former NKAO was initially treated as a potential bargaining chip, it slowly began to be seen as part of the country by both officials and the general population. The Stepanakert-based administration launched various programs aimed at bringing in permanent Armenian settlers to the depopulated lands, including into regions previously populated by Azeris, with those that bordered Armenia – Lachin and Kalbajar – being the priority. Lachin was key to a land connection between Armenia and the former NKAO, and Kalbajar had water resources utilised by both Artsakh and Armenia.

Azerbaijan regards this as a violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Armenia became party in 1993, whereby &quot;[t]he Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies&quot;. The ruling party of Azerbaijan accuses the Armenian side of artificially changing the demographic situation and the ethnic composition of the occupied region so that it can lay future claims to them, comparing this to the 1950s campaign of resettling diaspora Armenians in previously Azeri-populated locales in Soviet Armenia where Azeris were forcibly deported from in 1948–1950.

In 1979, the total Armenian population of the districts of Kalbajar, Lachin, Qubadli, Zangilan, Jabrayil, Fuzuli and Agdam was around 1,400 people. An OSCE fact-finding mission established at Azerbaijan&#x27;s request visited these regions in February 2005 with the intention to assess the scale of the settlement attempts. The mission&#x27;s findings showed that these districts had as of 2005 an overall population of 14,000 people, mostly living in precarious social conditions. It consisted primarily of ethnic Armenians displaced from the non-conflict zones of Azerbaijan during the war. It was noted, however, that most of them had settled in the conflict zone after having lived in Armenia for several years and some held Armenian passports and even voted in Armenian elections. A smaller segment of the settlers was originally from the towns of Gyumri and Spitak in Armenia who had lived in temporary shelters following the devastating 1988 earthquake before moving to Karabakh, as well as a small number of natives of Yerevan who moved there for financial reasons. A field assessment mission revisited the region in October 2010, confirming that there had not been much growth in population or change in the living conditions of the settlers. The Co-Chairs of the Minsk Group who visited Nagorno-Karabakh, Kalbajar and Lachin in 2014 reported seeing signs of improvements in the infrastructure but could not observe any indications that the size of the population had changed in recent years.

By June 2015, an estimated 17,000 of Syria&#x27;s once 80,000-strong Armenian population had fled the civil war and sought refuge in Armenia. David Babayan, spokesperson of the Artsakh leader Bako Sahakyan, confirmed that some of those refugees had been resettled in Artsakh. &quot;The Economist&quot; put the number of the resettled families at 30 as of June 2017. In December 2014, Armenian media cited local municipal authorities in stating that dozens of Syrian Armenian families had been resettled in the disputed zone, in particular in the city of Lachin and the village of Xanlıq in Qubadli. Azerbaijan&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs Elmar Mammadyarov expressed his concern over Armenia&#x27;s attempts to change the demographic situation in the region and informed of his intention to raise this issue with the Minsk Group.

In February 2019, Armenia&#x27;s National Security Service director Artur Vanetsyan visited Nagorno-Karabakh amid public concern about Nikol Pashinyan&#x27;s government alleged readiness to cede some of the Armenian-controlled territories as part of a peace settlement. Vanetsyan pointed out that settling Armenians and investing into infrastructural projects along the Iranian border, in the previously Azeri-populated regions outside of the former autonomous province, was &quot;a clear message&quot; to the international community that there would be no territorial concessions. He referred to the ongoing settlement efforts as a method of &quot;guaranteeing security&quot;. Azerbaijan&#x27;s Foreign Ministry reacted by qualifying Vanetsyan&#x27;s statement as an &quot;attempt to undermine the peace talks and defy the work of the mediators&quot; and vowed to address the issue to the UN and the OSCE.

The ceasefire ending the 2020 war stipulated that these territories were to be turned over to Azerbaijani control. Armenian settlers in these areas evacuated prior to the arrival of Azerbaijani forces.

===Ethnic composition===
Ethnic Groups of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (1926–1989) and the Republic of Artsakh (2015) according to census data
===Languages===
Armenian functioned as the only state language and an official language in the Republic of Artsakh, and was the native language of over 99% of the population. Under Soviet rule, the ethnic Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh became more proficient in Russian than both Azerbaijanis in the region and Armenians in the Armenian SSR. Few Armenians learnt Azerbaijani, and the language was actively removed following the Nagorno-Karabakh War. While Russian remained in some use after this time, and was valued as a second language, it was not widely spoken at a native level.

Russian was widely spoken in Artsakh, with efforts having been made since late 2020 in the parliament in Stepanakert to establish it as an additional official language; the official justifications for this being that Russian was already the second language of many residents, and that it would create &quot;conditions for deepening cooperation in all spheres, [as well as contributing] to the development of relations within the legal framework.&quot; The Parliament of Artsakh approved a bill grating Russian official status on March 25, 2021, with 27 votes in favour, 0 votes against and 2 abstentions.

===Religion===


Most of the Armenian population in Artsakh was Christian and were adherents of the Armenian Apostolic Church, which is an Oriental Orthodox Church. Some Eastern Orthodox and Evangelical denominations also existed.

====Armenian monasteries and churches====
* Amaras Monastery (4th century), located near the villages of Sos and Machkalashen in the Martuni Province. According to medieval chroniclers Faustus Byuzand and Movses Kaghankatvatsi, St. Gregory the Illuminator, the patron saint and evangeliser of Armenia, founded the Amaras Monastery at the start of the fourth century. At the beginning of the fifth century Mesrop Mashtots, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet, established in Amaras the first-ever school that used his script.

It is one of the most architecturally and culturally significant monasteries in Artsakh. The western façade of Dadivank&#x27;s Memorial Cathedral bears one of the most extensive Armenian lapidary (stone-inscribed) texts, and has one of the largest collection of medieval Armenian frescoes. Dadivank is named after St. Dadi, a disciple of Apostle Thaddeus who preached the Holy Gospel in Artsakh in the first century. St. Dadi&#x27;s tomb was later discovered by archaeologists in 2007. The monastery is in the Shahumyan Province and has been placed under the protection of the Russian peacekeeping forces.

It is the main cathedral and headquarters of the Armenian Apostolic Church&#x27;s &quot;Diocese of Artsakh&quot;.
* Just uphill from the cathedral in Shusha is the church of Kanach Zham (&#x27;Green Church&#x27; in Armenian), built in 1847.

===Education===

Education in Artsakh was compulsory, and was free up to the age of 18. The education system was inherited from the old system of the Soviet Union. Artsakh&#x27;s school system was severely damaged because of the 1991–1994 conflict. But the government of the Republic of Artsakh with considerable aid from the Republic of Armenia and with donations from the Armenian diaspora, rebuilt many of the schools. Prior to the 2020 war, Artsakh had around 250 schools of various sizes, with more than 200 lying in the regions. The student population was estimated at more than 20,000, with almost half in the capital city of Stepanakert.

Artsakh State University was founded by Artsakh and Armenian governments&#x27; joint efforts, with main campus in Stepanakert. The university opening ceremony took place on 10 May 1992. Yerevan University of Management also opened a branch in Stepanakert.

==Culture==

===Monuments===

&quot;We Are Our Mountains&quot; () by Sargis Baghdasaryan is a monument located in Stepanakert. The sculpture was widely regarded as a symbol of the Republic of Artsakh. It is a large monument from tuff of an old Armenian man and woman hewn from rock, representing the mountain people of Artsakh. It is also known as &quot;Tatik yev Papik&quot; (Տատիկ և Պապիկ, &quot;Grandma and Grandpa&quot;) in Armenian. The sculpture was featured prominently on Artsakh&#x27;s coat of arms. Artsakh has often been portrayed as a &quot;shield&quot; to the Armenian nation that protects it from Pan-Turkism. When lecturing his fighters during the First Nagorno Karabakh-War, Monte Melkonian would say &quot;If we lose this land, we turn the last page on Armenian history.&quot;

===Museums===
Artsakh State Museum was the historical museum of the Republic of Artsakh. Located at 4 Sasunstsi David Street, in Stepanakert, the museum offered an assortment of ancient artefacts and Christian manuscripts. There were also more recent items, ranging in date from the 19th century to World War II and from events of the Karabakh Independence War.

===Publications===
&quot;Azat Artsakh&quot; (Armenian: , ) was the official newspaper of the Republic of Artsakh. It had a daily print and was offered in Armenian, English, and Russian. Typical topics included the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Armenian genocide, and other Armenian-related issues. Aside from Azat Artsakh, many print media were published in more than one language, usually offering Russian and English sections in addition to the main Armenian section.

===Sports===

Sports in the Republic of Artsakh were organised by the Artsakh Ministry of Culture and Youth. Due to the non-recognition of Artsakh, sports teams from the country could not compete in most international tournaments.

Football was the most popular sport in Artsakh. Stepanakert had a well-built football stadium. In mid-1990s, football teams from Artsakh started taking part in some domestic competitions in Armenia. Lernayin Artsakh FC represented the city of Stepanakert. In Artsakh, domestic football clubs played in the Artsakh Football League. The Artsakh football league was launched in 2009. The Artsakh national football team was formed in 2012 and played their first competitive match against the Abkhazia national football team in Sokhumi, a match that ended with a result of 1–1 draw. The return match between the unrecognised teams took place at the Stepanakert Stadium, on 21 October 2012, when the team from Artsakh defeated the Abkhazian team 3–0.

There was also interest in other sports, including basketball and volleyball. Sailing was practised in the town of Martakert. Artsakh sports teams and athletes also participated in the Pan-Armenian Games organised in Armenia.

<text>The Rolls-Royce Thrust Measuring Rig (TMR) was a pioneering vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft developed by Rolls-Royce in the 1950s. It has the distinction of being &quot;the first jet-lift aircraft to fly anywhere in the world&quot;.

The design of the TMR is unique. It was powered by a pair of Nene turbojet engines, which were mounted back-to-back horizontally within a steel framework; in turn, this framework was raised upon four legs fitted with castors for wheels. The TMR lacked any lifting surfaces, such as wings; instead, lift was generated purely by the thrust being directed downwards. Due to its unconventional appearance, it was nicknamed the Flying Bedstead.

The TMR had been envisioned specifically for conducting research, specifically to explore the potential applications of then-newly developed jet propulsion towards carrying out vertical flights. First flying in August 1954, extensive studies were conducted during a series of test flights into how stabilisation could be performed during the aircraft&#x27;s hover. It contributed to a greater understanding of the level of power and appropriate manners of stabilisation involved in a VTOL aircraft, as well as proving the feasibility of the concept in general.

== Development ==
The man largely responsible for the development of the TMR was Dr Alan Arnold Griffith, who had worked on gas turbine design at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), in the 1920s and was a pioneer of jet lift technology. In 1939, Griffith had been employed by Rolls-Royce. During the 1940s, he conceived of using jet propulsion as a method of directly providing vertical lift to produce an aircraft that could take off vertically. The construction of such an aircraft for research purposes was suggested by Griffith.

Being suitably impressed by Griffith&#x27;s concept, while also being keen to explore and harness the capabilities of its newly developed range of jet engines, Rolls-Royce commenced construction of the aircraft at the company&#x27;s facility at Hucknall Aerodrome, Nottinghamshire, England. The crucial auto-stabiliser for the aircraft was designed and produced by the Instrument and Air Photography Department of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE). The aircraft was designated as the &quot;Thrust Measuring Rig&quot; (TMR), two were constructed for the test program.

On 19 August 1953, the first TMR conducted its maiden flight at Hucknall Aerodrome. In order to perform these flights, a purpose-built gantry-like arrangement had been devised and assembled at Hucknall which, while not restricting the aircraft&#x27;s movement within a defined space, prevented it from exceeding that boundary; it also prevented excessive descent rates, allowing for a maximum descent rate of , from occurring in order to avoid sustaining damage and allowed struggling pilots to readily close the throttles without a resulting accident. During the first year of flights, the aircraft remained tethered within the gantry system for flight testing. On 3 August 1954, the TMR conducted its first &quot;free&quot; flight, piloted by Ronald Thomas Shepherd, Rolls-Royce&#x27;s chief test pilot.

In late 1954, the TMR was transferred to the RAE&#x27;s research facilities, firstly being assigned to RAE Farnborough. In June 1956, it was relocated to RAE Bedford, Bedfordshire, for the purposes of conducting further flight tests. While the practicalities surrounding controllability had been addressed during its time at Hucknall, the RAE were more interested in using the TMR to determine if artificial stabilisation would be necessary for such aircraft, both during the hover and the low-speed stages of flight, and to investigate desirable characteristics towards achieving stable vertical flight.

Information from typical flights was primarily acquired through the reported experiences of the pilots. During stability trials, more quantifiable data was gained by instructing multiple pilots to follow the same sequence of manoeuvres, many of which were intended to be representative of VTOL aircraft transitioning into hovering flight; multiple observers were also employed as well. Test flights had several safety restrictions placed upon them: the TMR was not typically flown if the wind speed was 10 knots or greater, it would only fly under weather conditions in which the aircraft could be controlled in the event of a fault. Pilots were able to perform take-offs and controlled landings, but found both feats to be more difficult if wind was present, particularly if the TMR was required to tilt in order to counteract the wind&#x27;s effects.

Reportedly, pilots found that the main initial difficulty in flying the TMR was the regulation of the aircraft&#x27;s height; this was partially due to the slow response of the engine to throttle movements being commanded by the pilot. The delay interval between the throttle and the engine response was often around the one-to-two second mark; pilots would typically adapt to this peculiarity of the aircraft and become adept at mastering height control. Two attempts were made to improve the height control, the addition of a simplistic trimmer on the throttle to restrict its possible speed of movement, and the installation of &#x27;throttle-anticipators&#x27; that failed to operate as intended. The TMR effectively demonstrated that delay in the height control response would be a major difficulty of VTOL aircraft, and the engines of later VTOL aircraft did typically feature faster response times.

The aircraft survived a failure of its thrust-vectored control system on 16 September 1957 whilst being piloted by Wing Commander Stan Hubbard of the RAE. On 28 November 1957, the second TMR, Serial &quot;XK426&quot;, was destroyed during a test flight, resulting in the death of Wing Commander H. G. F. Larsen, who had been piloting the aircraft for the first time.

The research from the TMR&#x27;s test programme were of considerable value to future VTOL aircraft, as least in some areas: an official report published by the Ministry of Aviation summarised that &quot;the main conclusion to be drawn from this experience is that any practical jet-lift aircraft must have some artificial stabilisation while hovering if it is to operate in other than very favourable weather conditions...the main difficulty in learning to fly the aircraft was the height control; any reduction in the time constant of the engine response would make the problem of learning to fly a jet-lift aircraft easier&quot;. Following the relatively successful trials of the TMR, Rolls-Royce decided to proceed with the development of the Rolls-Royce RB108 direct-lift turbojet; five of these engines were used to power the first true British VTOL aircraft, the Short SC.1.

== Design ==
The Rolls-Royce Thrust Measuring Rig (TMR) was a VTOL aircraft developed to explore the practicality, characteristics, and requirements of such an aircraft. It was widely known by its nickname of the &quot;Flying Bedstead&quot; due to its radically unconventional appearance for an aircraft, basically consisting of a rectangular tubular framework that was built around the engines, a platform being placed on top of which to accommodate a single pilot. It did not have any aerodynamic shape, lacking either wings or a tail; it instead generated all of its lift by directing the thrust of its engines directly downwards. Due its small size, the TMR had a maximum flight endurance of only six minutes.

It was powered by a pair of Nene turbojet engines, which were installed in a back-to-back configuration. The output of the jets was directed towards the centre of gravity of the rig; one jetpipe discharging downwards through a central nozzle while the other jet discharged downwards through two smaller nozzles on either side; this was so that, in the event of a single engine failing during flight, there would not be any sharp adverse movement as a result. Considerable precautions were taken to safely sustain such an engine failure; the four-leg undercarriage was designed to support a vertical velocity of , and to withstand a single-engine landing from any height below . The TMR possessed only marginal excess power, which complicated the act of flying the aircraft; this was further compounded by the slow response time of the engines to throttle changes. Accordingly, there was a considerable degree of anticipation in the use of engine power required to prevent overshooting of desired altitude, and to ensure a gentle touchdown when landing.

A total of four outrigger arms extended out from the rig, one on either side and one each at the front and rear, through which compressed air was released for control in roll, pitch and yaw when in flight. While the controls for yaw and height were mechanically based, the pitch and roll controls were electrically signalled, without any provision for reverting to mechanical operation. Initially, key components for the electrical control system components were duplicated; however, in order to make the detection of faults infallible, a safer partial-triplex arrangement was adopted for the RAE&#x27;s free flight testing phase. As the TMR possessed no inherent stability, it incorporated an experimental automatic stabiliser system. During its numerous test flights, varying degrees of intervention by the stabiliser were performed, including a few in which no stabilisation was active at all.

<text>Servizio per le Informazioni e la Sicurezza Militare (abbreviated SISMI, &quot;Military Intelligence and Security Service&quot;) was the military intelligence agency of Italy from 1977–2007.

With the reform of the Italian Intelligence Services approved on 1 August 2007, SISMI was replaced by Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Esterna (AISE).

==History==
Since the end of World War II, Italian intelligence agencies have been reorganized many times (SIM 1900–49, SIFAR 1949–65, SID 1965–77) and last SISDE (civil) and SISMI (military) from 1977 to 2007, in an attempt to increase their effectiveness and bring them more fully under civilian control.

The agency was established as part of a broader reform of the Italian intelligence community, which represented the latest in a long string of government attempts to effectively manage Italy&#x27;s intelligence agencies.

* In 1977, with Legislative Act n.801, the SISMI was created after a former chief of the SID, Vito Miceli, was arrested in 1974 for &quot;conspiring against the State&quot; (See Golpe Borghese of the 1970). Thus the intelligence agencies were reorganized in a democratic attempt. This re-organization mainly consisted of:
** The split of SID, the intelligence agency at that time, into two separate agencies with different roles: SISDE (the domestic one) and SISMI (the military one).
** The creation of CESIS, with a coordination role between the two intelligence agencies and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
** The creation of the Parliamentary Committee, COPACO, to oversee the activities of the two agencies.
* Since 1 August 2007, with Legislative Act n.124 of 08/03/2007, following the reform of the Italian intelligence agencies, SISDE, SISMI and CESIS were replaced respectively by AISI, AISE and DIS, and the COPACO was granted additional oversight and control powers.

The first director of the service was Giuseppe Santovito (1978–1981), succeeded by General Nino Lugaresi was SISMI&#x27;s director from 1981 to 1984; he testified on Gladio. General Nicolò Pollari was SISMI&#x27;s second-last director; he resigned on 20 November 2006 after being indicted in the &quot;Abu Omar case&quot;, so Prime Minister Romano Prodi replaced him with Admiral Bruno Branciforte.

Admiral Bruno Branciforte was SISMI&#x27;s last director, in charge until 3 August 2007.
With the reform of the Italian Intelligence Services approved on 1 August 2007 the military intelligence was eliminated, and the Italian intelligence was divided into internal and foreign.

==Mission==
SISMI was responsible for intelligence and security activities involving the military defence of Italy and for the integrity of the Italian State.

SISMI reported to the Italian Ministry of Defense and operated both inside and outside of Italy&#x27;s borders. It was feasible that domestic Intelligence and Security, which normally fell under SISDE&#x27;s jurisdiction (since it reported to the Ministry of the Interior), also involved SISMI, unless the security threat came from organized crime.

Its duties included:
* clearing activities with the Prime Minister;
* nominating the Director of the Service and his assistants under CIIS supervision.

== The directors ==
*General Giuseppe Santovito (First director, 13 January 1978 – August 1981)
*General Nino Lugaresi (August 1981 – 4 May 1984)
*Admiral Fulvio Martini (5 May 1984 – 26 February 1991)
*General Sergio Luccarini (27 February 1991 – 19 August 1991)
*General Luigi Ramponi (19 August 1991 – 9 August 1992)
*General Cesare Pucci (10 August 1992 – 12 July 1994)
*General Sergio Siracusa (12 July 1994 – 3 November 1996)
*Admiral Gianfranco Battelli (4 November 1996 – 30 September 2001)
*General Nicolò Pollari (1 October 2001 – 20 November 2006)
*Admiral Bruno Branciforte (21 November 2006 – 3 August 2007)

== Motto and logo ==
SISMI&#x27;s motto, as seen on its logo, was &quot;&quot; (Latin for &quot;Understanding hidden things&quot;). The verb &quot;&quot;, which literally means &quot;I comprehend&quot;, was chosen because «it evokes the noble root of intelligence, a discipline aimed at unravelling mysteries and holds in itself a constant tension directed to its final goal: knowledge».

Its coat of arms was granted by a decree of the President of the Republic dated 28 January 2004.

==Recent controversies==

=== Nicola Calipari and Giuliana Sgrena ===

In 2004, Nicola Calipari, a high-ranking SISMI hostage negotiator, was killed at a U.S. Army checkpoint in Baghdad by Mario Lozano, purportedly after a communication breakdown between the Italian intelligence community and the occupying forces.

=== Yellowcake forgery ===

In 2005, SISMI was implicated in the yellowcake forgery scandal. The forged documents purporting to detail an Iraqi purchase of yellowcake uranium from Niger were given to a &quot;cutout&quot; named Rocco Martino by a Colonel in SISMI, Antonio Nucera. The head of SISMI, after claiming his agency received the documents from external sources, met with then-Deputy National Security Advisor, Stephen Hadley, on 9 September 2002.

Reportedly, the SISMI director vouched for the documents&#x27; authenticity at the meeting; as a result, the White House attempted to insert a reference to uranium from Africa in President Bush&#x27;s upcoming address to the United Nations, scheduled for 12 September 2002. The CIA removed the reference 24 hours before the address was given. In bypassing the CIA, Pollari ignored the established protocol for contacts between Italian and American intelligence agencies.

President Bush later used the same discredited information when delivering his January 2003 State of the Union address.

=== Imam Rapito ===

In July 2006, the Italian judiciary power issued arrest warrants for several SISMI officials involved in the joint CIA-SISMI operation resulting in the unlawful extraordinary rendition of Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, which SISMI Director Pollari had formally denied in testimony before a committee of the national legislature. Among these were:

* former Deputy Director Marco Mancini
* General Gustavo Pignero, agency chief for Northern Italy
* Mancini&#x27;s aide Giuseppe Ciorra
* Pio Pompa, an aide to SISMI Director Nicolò Pollari (he was indicted for &quot;abusive interception&quot; against the vice-president of &quot;La Repubblica&quot;, Giuseppe D&#x27;Avanzo)
* former Trieste Station Chief Lorenzo Pillinini
* former Padua Station Chief Marco Iodice
* Milan Station Chief Maurizio Regondi

Nicolò Pollari himself would later be indicted on 5 December 2006 and sentenced to 10 years in jail on February 12, 2013. Marco Mancini was sentenced to 9 years in jail. They appealed against this ruling.

On 16 February 2007, an Italian judge ordered twenty-six Americans and five Italians (including Pollari) to stand trial over the case on 8 June 2007. 

As part of the judiciary investigation, a SISMI-run black operation targeting centre-left politician Romano Prodi and a vast domestic surveillance program was uncovered. Pompa prevailed upon the newspaper &quot;Libero&quot; to print allegations that Prodi, when serving as European Commissioner, had authorized the CIA prison flights via Italy. Targeted in the surveillance program were &quot;La Repubblica&quot; reporters Giuseppe D&#x27;Avanzo and Carlo Bonini, who broke the yellowcake forgery story.

=== Spying on magistrates ===

Italian magistrates searching the SISMI&#x27;s headquarters in August 2007 found documents proving that the intelligence agency had spied over various European magistrates between 2001 and 2006, whom it considered carrying a &quot;destabilization&quot; potential. These included the Medel, a European association of magistrates, as well as three French judges, including Anne Crenier, former president of the Syndicat de la magistrature French union, who is married to Italian magistrate Mario Vaudano who works at the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).

<text>Marvin M. Mitchelson (May 7, 1928 – September 18, 2004) was an American celebrity lawyer who pioneered the concept of palimony, calling it &quot;marriage with no rings attached&quot;.

== Early life ==
Mitchelson was born in Detroit, Michigan, the youngest child of three and only son of poor Russian immigrants. The family relocated to Los Angeles when Marvin was in high school. After graduation, he served a term in the United States Navy. After leaving the service, he entered UCLA, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. He obtained a Juris Doctor degree from Southwestern University School of Law, and was admitted to the State Bar of California on June 4, 1957. He had passed the bar exam on his second try. He then set up a private legal practice in Los Angeles.

== Legal career ==
In 1963, Mitchelson won a landmark United States Supreme Court decision, &quot;Douglas v. California&quot;, protecting indigent defendants&#x27; right to legal counsel.

He gained national publicity when he was hired by Michelle Triola, a lounge singer who lived with actor Lee Marvin as his romantic partner from 1964 until 1970, when Marvin told her to move out because he wanted to marry another woman. Mitchelson helped Triola—who claimed that she was entitled to the same benefits as a divorcée, which meant half of Marvin&#x27;s then-$3.6 million fortune—win her right to bring suit. Although Triola was awarded $104,000 for &quot;rehabilitation&quot; in 1978, that ruling was overturned in 1981, and Marvin never paid Triola any money. &quot;Marvin v. Marvin&quot; (Triola assumed Marvin&#x27;s name during the relationship) set a precedent.

Mitchelson&#x27;s celebrity clients included Pamela Mason (wife of James Mason), who received a $2 million divorce settlement from her ex-husband, Robert De Niro, Mickey Rooney, Sylvester Stallone, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Joan Collins, Mel Tormé, Bianca Jagger, Lesley-Anne Down, Carl Sagan, Mrs. William Shatner, and many ex-wives of errant playboy sheiks.

== Later years and death ==
 During his heyday, Mitchelson owned a 38-room Beverly Hills mansion and four Rolls-Royce automobiles. In his Century City office he had a chair owned by Rudolph Valentino and an illuminated ceiling of Botticelli&#x27;s Venus which matched his belt buckle.

He made a brief cameo appearance on &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; (&quot;There Goes the Bride&quot;); his role was as a lawyer for Stanley Zbornak, ex-husband of Dorothy Zbornak. In the episode, he produced a prenuptial agreement which Dorothy had to sign. She refused, and their remarriage was canceled.

Mitchelson was quoted as saying, &quot;A divorce lawyer is a chameleon with a law book.&quot;

He was accused of rape by two women in the early 1990s, but the authorities declined to prosecute. However, on April 12, 1993, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison on four counts of felony tax fraud and failure to properly oversee a trust account. In 1994, he was cited for failing to take the professional responsibility exam, had his probation revoked in 1995, and was disciplined in 1996 for failure to provide accountings or return unearned fees in 14 client matters. A 1993 conviction for not paying taxes on some $2 million in income resulted in suspension from the Bar, bankruptcy, and eventually two years in jail from 1996 to 1998. The case was initiated by a former girlfriend of Mitchelson&#x27;s and was investigated by IRS Special Agent James Lawrence Wilson.

He wept on his first day in Lompoc prison, but ultimately found white-collar incarceration stimulating. He organized an opera appreciation society, ran the library and helped other prisoners with their appeals.

Mitchelson was married to Italian-born actress Marcella Ferri.

Mitchelson died in a rehabilitation center in Beverly Hills, succumbing to cancer.

Jeff Marlow portrays Mitchelson in the final two episodes of the 2022-23 HBO series &quot;Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty&quot;. Mitchelson represents Honey Kaplan, the fictionalized second wife of Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss.

<text>Myrta Blanca Silva Oliveros (September 11, 1927 – December 2, 1987) better known as Myrta Silva, was a Puerto Rican singer, songwriter and television producer who was known affectionately as &quot;La Gorda de Oro&quot;. She rose to fame in 1949 as the lead vocalist for the Cuban ensemble Sonora Matancera.

==Early years==
Myrta Blanca Silva Oliveros was born in the city of Arecibo, Puerto Rico. Her father died when she was six years old and she was raised by her mother, who was her inspiration. Silva and her fans referred to her mother as &quot;Mama Yeya.&quot; In 1937, Silva made her first public presentation at the Oliver Theater in Arecibo. In these early years of her music career, she worked an average of twenty-five revue shows a week to support herself. 

Circa 1938, Silva and her mother moved to New York, where she started a career in radio, theater and musical plays. In 1939, she made her debut in Brooklyn at the Atlantic Theater, soon becoming a regular at venues like the Teatro Hispano, Teatro Puerto Rico, and Carnegie Hall in New York.

==Singing career==
Silva was working in a cabaret when she was discovered and offered a 10-year contract by RCA. In the late 1930s, she met the Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hernández, who convinced her to join his Cuarteto Victoria. Myrta traveled with the group all over Latin-America. Some time later, she also sang for another composer Pedro Flores in his Sexteto Flores, where she was joined by Daniel Santos and Pedro Ortiz Dávila.

===As a composer===
In 1941, aged 14, Silva composed her first song, &quot;Cuando Vuelvas&quot; (&quot;When You Return&quot;), recorded by Ruth Fernández. In 1942, she composed &quot;En Mi Soledad&quot; (&quot;In My Solitude&quot;), recorded by Daniel Santos, which became a hit in Latin America and in the Latin communities in the United States. Silva became the first woman certified as a &quot;timbalera&quot; by the American Federation of Music in 1943. In 1944, she wrote &quot;Asi es la Vida&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot;) and &quot;Facil de Recordar&quot; (&quot;Easy to Remember&quot;) while she was performing in Havana, Cuba.

Silva had become an international singing star and was known as &quot;The Queen of the Guaracha&quot; by her fans in Latin America. From 1949 to 1950, she was the lead singer in the popular Cuban ensemble, La Sonora Matancera, at the same time continuing to compose. She received a good deal of recognition for her groups&#x27; performances throughout Latin America. In Argentina, she was named the &quot;best-selling artist&quot; in that country. In 1950, she was proclaimed by the Cuban government &quot;The Most Popular Artist.&quot; When she decided to leave the group she was replaced by Celia Cruz, a young school teacher turned singer who went on to become known as the &quot;Queen of Salsa.&quot;

===Madame Chencha===
In the 1950s, together with the Cuban composer Ñico Saquito (Antonio Fernández), Silva wrote a humorous song titled “Camina Como Chencha” (“Walk Like Chencha”). In 1956, Silva produced and transmitted from New York a television program, &quot;Una Hora Contigo&quot; (&quot;An Hour with You&quot;). The show was transmitted by Canal 4 in Puerto Rico and Myrta moved back to the island. In her show she re-created the innovative character of &quot;Madame Chencha.&quot; &quot;Madame Chencha&quot; became the first T.V. character dedicated to &quot;rumors.&quot; This character created a lot of controversy between public figures and the television station, and as a consequence, Silva decided to leave the program and return to New York City.

===In New York City===
In New York City, she composed &quot;Puerto Rico del Alma&quot; (&quot;Puerto Rico of my Soul&quot;). Between 1962 and 1964, she composed the following hit songs: &quot;Que Sabes Tu&quot; (&quot;What do you know?&quot;), &quot;Tengo que Acostumbrarme&quot; (&quot;I Have To Get Used To It&quot;), &quot;Juguetes del Destino&quot; (&quot;Toys of Destiny&quot;), and many others. Among her recordings are &quot;Voces Romanticas de Puerto Rico&quot; (Romantic voices of Puerto Rico), &quot;La Bombonera de San Juan&quot; (The Bombonera of San Juan) and &quot;La Compositora E interprete&quot; (The Composer and Interpreter).

===&quot;Una Hora Contigo&quot; (&quot;An Hour with You&quot;)===
During the mid 1960s, Silva hosted a weekly music variety TV show &quot;Una Hora Contigo&quot; (&quot;An Hour with You&quot;) on New York City&#x27;s first Spanish language television station, WNJU-TV Channel 47. The program was hugely popular among the Latino audience, prompting the station to add an additional weekly program hosted by Silva titled &quot;Tira y Tapate&quot;.

In the 1970s, Silva wrote &quot;No Te Vayas de Mi Vida&quot; (&quot;Stay In My Life&quot;) which was recorded and made popular by Evelyn Souffront. 

In 1971, Silva returned to Puerto Rico with her television show &quot;Una Hora Contigo&quot; which this time was transmitted on Canal 11. This show was among the most popular programs in Puerto Rico.

==Later years==
Silva was active in many charities and she also participated in many pro-Hispanic activities in the US. During the 1980s, Silva had a program in the government television channel dedicated to music and composers. In 2016, Myrta Silva was inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Silva suffered from dementia in her last years. One day while showering, she accidentally scalded herself with the hot water and suffered third degree burns. Silva died on December 2, 1987, in Arecibo, aged 60 and was buried in Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

<text>Ependymin is a glycoprotein found in the cerebrospinal fluid of many teleost fish. The humans homolog is called ependymin related 1 that is encoded by the &quot;EPDR1&quot; gene.

Ependymin is associated with the consolidation of long-term memory, possibly providing protection from strokes, and contributing to neuronal regeneration. This encoded protein was originally detected in elevated amounts of fluid within the central nervous system of teleost fishes. Along with long-term memory and neuronal regeneration, ependymin has been connected to specific aspects of changes in signaling within nerve cells leading to brain plasticity, as well as behavioral performance in response to environment stress in fishes. For example, this glycoprotein interaction in the extracellular matrix influences cell adhesion and migration processes in the central nervous system of teleost fishes. The presence of ependymin-related proteins can be found in both vertebrates and invertebrates. They have variety of functional roles in non-neural sites of organisms. For example, an ependymin-related gene that is upregulated in colon cancer known as UCC1 was found in human colorectal tumor cells.

<doc id="1000557" wikidata="Q40356" url="?curid=1000557" title="Joseph Deniker">
<text>Joseph &quot;Yegorovich&quot; Deniker (, &quot;Yosif Yegorovich Deniker&quot;; 6 March 1852, in Astrakhan – 18 March 1918, in Paris) was a Russian-French naturalist and anthropologist, known primarily for his attempts to develop highly detailed maps of race in Europe.

==Life==
Deniker was born in 1852 to French parents in Astrakhan, Russian Empire. He first studied at the university and technical institute of St. Petersburg, where he adopted engineering as a profession, and in this capacity, traveled extensively in the petroleum districts of the Caucasus, in Central Europe, Italy and Dalmatia. Settling in Paris, France in 1876, he studied at the Sorbonne, where he received a doctorate in natural science in 1886. In 1888 he was appointed chief librarian of the Natural History Museum in Paris.

Deniker became one of the chief editors of the &quot;Dictionnaire de geographie universelle&quot;, and published many papers in the anthropological and zoological journals of France. In 1904 he was invited by the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain to give the Huxley Memorial Lecture. He died in Paris in 1918.

==Deniker&#x27;s classification system==
Deniker&#x27;s complicated maps of European races, of which he sometimes counted upwards of twenty, were widely referenced in his day, if only to illustrate the extremes of arbitrary racial classification.
Deniker had an extensive debate with another racial cartographer, William Z. Ripley, over the nature of race and the number of races. At the time, Ripley maintained that the peoples of Europe were composed of three main racial stocks, while Deniker held there were six primary European races (besides four secondary or subsidiary races). The six primary races are:
*&quot;Nordic&quot;, in the Germanic core territory in Scandinavia, Northern Germany and Frisia, the British Isles and the Baltic
*&quot;Littoral&quot; or &quot;Atlanto-Mediterranean&quot;, in the Pyrenees and parts of Spain, western and southern France and north-western Italy
* &quot;Oriental&quot;; also called &quot;Eastern&quot;, in the Slavic core territory (Belarus, Ukraine and eastern Poland)
* &quot;Adriatic&quot; or &quot;Dinaric&quot;, around the Adriatic Sea, with widespread remnants in parts of France, Austria, Ukraine and Ciscaucasia
* &quot;Ibero-Insular&quot; in the Iberian Peninsula, western France, southern Italy and the Mediterranean islands
* &quot;Occidental&quot; (also called &quot;Cevenole&quot;); corresponding to Ripley&#x27;s &quot;Alpine race&quot;, was supposedly the race of the paleolithic inhabitants of Europe, with scattered remnants throughout the continent
The four subtypes are:
*&quot;Sub-Nordic&quot;, on the fringes of Germanic settlement in southern Britain, Germany and the Baltic
*&quot;North-Occidental&quot;, in the contact zone of Celtic and Germanic, in the British Isles and northern France
*&quot;Vistulian&quot;, named for the Vistula, in the Germanic-Slavic contact zone in Poland
*&quot;Sub-Adriatic&quot;; in the Alps and the historical Continental Celtic core territory

According to Jan Czekanowski, both Deniker and Ripley omitted the existence of the &quot;Armenoid race&quot;, which Czekanowski claims to be one of the four main races of Europe, met especially among the Eastern Europeans and Southern Europeans. Deniker&#x27;s most lasting contribution to the field of racial theory was the designation of one of his races as &quot;la race nordique&quot;. While this group had no special place in Deniker&#x27;s racial model, this &quot;Nordic race&quot; would be elevated by the famous eugenicist and anthropologist Madison Grant in his Nordic theory to the engine of civilization. Grant adopted Ripley&#x27;s three-race model for Europeans, but disliked Ripley&#x27;s use of the &quot;Teuton&quot; for one of the races. Grant transliterated &quot;la race nordique&quot; into &quot;Nordic&quot;, and promoted it to the top of his racial hierarchy in his own popular racial theory of the 1910s and 1920s.

Deniker proposed that the concept of race was too confusing, and instead proposed the use of the word &quot;ethnic group&quot; instead, which was later adopted prominently in the work of Julian Huxley and Alfred C. Haddon. Ripley argued that Deniker&#x27;s idea of a race should be rather called a &quot;type&quot;, since it was far less biologically rigid than most approaches to the question of race.

<doc id="1000559" wikidata="Q274591" url="?curid=1000559" title="Électricité de France">
<text>Électricité de France SA (; ), commonly known as EDF, is a French multinational electric utility company owned by the government of France. Headquartered in Paris, with €139.7 billion in sales in 2023, EDF operates a diverse portfolio of at least 120 gigawatts of generation capacity in Europe, South America, North America, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. In 2009, EDF was the world&#x27;s largest producer of electricity. Its 56 active nuclear reactors in France are spread out over 18 sites (18 nuclear power plants). They comprise 32 reactors of 900 MWe, 20 reactors of 1,300 MWe, and 4 reactors of 1,450 MWe, all PWRs.

EDF was created on 8 April 1946 by the 1945 parliament, from the merging of various divided actors. EDF led France&#x27;s post-war energy growth, with a unique focus on civil nuclear energy, through reconstruction and further industrialization within the &quot;Trente Glorieuses&quot;, being a flagship of France&#x27;s new industrial landscape. In 2004, following integration into the European Common Market, EDF was privatized, although the government of France retained 84% equity. In 2017 EDF took over the majority of the reactor business Areva, in a French government-sponsored restructuring. That same year, following a wish to divest from nuclear energy, the possible closure of 17 of EDF&#x27;s French nuclear power reactors by 2025 was announced. By 2022, this decision had been reversed, with the administration of president Emmanuel Macron announcing plans for a &quot;nuclear renaissance&quot;, beginning with the projected construction of 6 EPR model 2 reactors with an option for 8 further reactors. Meanwhile, construction is ongoing on EPR model 1 reactors in France and Britain.

Following privatization, decades of under-investment, and the 2021–2022 global energy crisis, the French government announced the full renationalisation of the company for an estimated cost of €5 billion, which it completed on 8 June 2023.

==The EDF group==

===Activities===
EDF specialises in electricity, from engineering to distribution. The company&#x27;s operations include the following: electricity generation and distribution; power plant design, construction and dismantling; energy trading; and transport. It is active in such power generation technologies as nuclear power, hydropower, wind power, solar energy, biomass, geothermal energy and fossil-fired energy.

In November 2022, EDF agreed the acquisition of GE Steam Power&#x27;s nuclear activities, which include the manufacture of non-nuclear equipment for new nuclear power plants including steam turbines and the maintenance and upgrade of existing nuclear power plants outside America. The acquisition was completed on 31 May 2024, and GE Power&#x27;s nuclear business is now known as Arabelle Solutions.

====Distribution network (RTE and Enedis)====
The electricity network in France is composed of the following:
*a high- and very-high-voltage transmission system (100,000 km of lines). This part of the system is managed by RTE (electricity transmission system operator) who acts as an independent administrator of infrastructure, although it is a subsidiary of EDF;
*a low- and medium-voltage distribution system (1,300,000 km of lines), maintained by Enedis (ex-ERDF), formerly known as EDF-Gaz de France Distribution. Enedis (ex-ERDF) was spun off from EDF-Gaz de France Distribution in 2008 as part of the process of total separation of the activities of EDF and GDF Suez.

==History==

===Status of EDF===
EDF was founded on 8 April 1946, as a result of the nationalisation of around 1,700 smaller energy producers, transporters and distributors by the Minister of Industrial Production Marcel Paul. Mostly a state-owned &quot;EPIC&quot;, it became the main electricity generation and distribution company in France, enjoying a monopoly in electricity generation, although some small local distributors were retained by the nationalisation. This monopoly ended in 1999, when EDF was forced by a European Directive to open up 20% of its business to competitors.

Until 19 November 2004, EDF was a state-owned corporation, but became a limited-liability corporation under private law (&quot;société anonyme&quot;), after its status was changed by statute. The French government partially floated shares of the company on the Paris Stock Exchange in November 2005, although it retained almost 85% ownership as of the end of 2008.

On 22 November 2016, French competition regulators raided EDF offices, looking for evidence that EDF was abusing its dominant position to manipulate electricity prices and squeeze rivals.

===Finances===
Between 2001 and 2003, EDF was forced to reduce its equity capital by €6.4 billion total because of the performance of subsidiaries in South America and Europe. In 2001, it also acquired a number of British energy companies, becoming the UK&#x27;s biggest electricity supplier.

The company remains heavily in debt. Its profitability suffered during the recession which began in 2008. It made €3.9 billion in 2009, which fell to €1.02 billion in 2010, with provisions set aside amounting to €2.9 billion.

In January 2013 the company sold its 1.6% stake in U.S. utility Exelon for $470 million.

In March 2016 EDF&#x27;s Chief Financial Officer, Thomas Piquemal, who had argued that the final investment decision on building Hinkley Point C nuclear power station should be delayed for three years, resigned. With EDF&#x27;s market value halved over the preceding year, the cost of the Hinkley Point C project now exceeded the entire market capitalisation of EDF.

In March 2017 EDF offered a €4bn rights issue of new shares to increase capital availability, at a 34.5% discount. The French government committed to purchasing €3bn of the rights issue. Shares prices fell to an all-time low due to the heavy discount on new shares.

EDF&#x27;s net debt at the end of 2018 was €33 billion, but with future obligations such as pension liabilities and costs for managing nuclear waste allowed for, the adjusted net debt was €70 billion. In order to improve EDF&#x27;s finances, as of 2019 EDF has sold €10 billion of assets, with plans to sell a further €2 to €3 billion of assets by 2021, and shareholders have been allocated new shares rather than cash dividends. Bonds have been issued in Asian currencies to expand sources of funding. It has financial commitments for new builds at Flamanville and Hinkley Point C. EDF is committed to spending €49.4 billion by 2025 for life extension of its French nuclear reactor fleet, which as of 2019 has an average age of 33 years, to 50 years.

In December 2021, EDF had about €43 billion of debt, which investment analysts Morningstar expected to exceed €60bn by the end of 2022. EDF&#x27;s credit rating was downgraded in February 2022.

In February 2024, EDF took a €12.9 billion impairment charge on cost overruns building the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and a further €1.1 billion later for inflation.

===Energy policy===
France is the world&#x27;s largest user of nuclear power for electricity (78% of French production in 2007).

In May 2004, the French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy reasserted, in front of the French Parliament, the primacy of nuclear power, much to the relief of labour unions of EDF. In this speech, the minister re-phrased the famous slogan, &quot;We do not have oil, but we have ideas&quot;, by declaring: &quot;We do not have oil, we do not have gas, we do not have coal, but we had ideas&quot;.
Depleted uranium from reprocessing the spent fuel of the 58 French nuclear power plants were exported from Le Havre to Russia in the last years and stored in Seversk where it was enriched, and the new fuel was exported back to France.

In 2013 EDF acknowledged the difficulties it was having building the new EPR nuclear reactor design, with its head of production and engineering, Hervé Machenaud, saying EDF had lost its dominant international position in design and construction of nuclear power stations. In September 2015 EDF&#x27;s chief executive Jean-Bernard Lévy stated that the design of a &quot;New Model&quot; EPR was being worked on, which will be easier to build, to be ready for orders from about 2020.

In 2016 EDF&#x27;s chief executive Jean-Bernard Lévy stated that EDF&#x27;s 2030 strategy increased the emphasis on renewable energy, with a 2030 goal of doubling renewable energy capacity worldwide. He stated &quot;I am convinced that we will still have a centralised and secure system in the future but it will be supplemented by a more intermittent and local decentralised system, in which customers will take charge of their consumption. In readiness for this, we must press on with research into electricity storage and smart electricity systems&quot;.

===EDF spying conviction===
In 2011, a French court fined EDF €1.5m and jailed two senior employees for spying on Greenpeace, including hacking into Greenpeace&#x27;s computer systems. Greenpeace was awarded €500,000 in damages. Although EDF claimed that a security firm had only been employed to monitor Greenpeace, the court disagreed, jailing the head and deputy head of EDF&#x27;s nuclear security operation for three years each. Two employees of the security firm, Kargus, run by a former member of France&#x27;s secret services, received sentences of three and two years respectively.
Charges were mostly dismissed in appeal in 2013. 

===DDoS attack on EDF site===
EDF&#x27;s website was brought down by DDoS attacks three times in 2011, twice in April and once later in June.

The attacks were claimed by the hacktivist group Anonymous. Three men were later arrested and interviewed on charges of &quot;obstructing functionality of a data processing service&quot;, &quot;fraudulent access of a data processing service&quot; and &quot;participation in an association formed with the aim of preparing such infractions&quot;.

Motivations for the attack were thought to relate to the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan. Unlike Switzerland and Germany, which plan to close down all nuclear reactors at the end of their lifespan, the government of France had no such plans to move away from nuclear power and three months after the Fukushima meltdown, stated a budget increase for nuclear power.

The downtime of the EDF website cost the company an estimated €162,000.

===Suing No Dash For Gas===
In February 2013 EDF Energy sought an estimated £5 million in damages from environmental activists from the &quot;No Dash for Gas&quot; campaign that occupied the EDF-owned West Burton CCGT power station in October 2012.

It is unusual in the UK for companies to seek damages from protesters.
On 13 March 2013, EDF dropped their lawsuit against the protesters, after agreeing a permanent injunction against protesters entering EDF sites.

===Absorption of Areva reactor business===
In 2017 EDF took over the majority of the reactor business of Areva, excluding the fuel business, in a French government sponsored restructuring following financial and technical problems at Areva due to the building of new EPR nuclear plants. The reactor business has been named Framatome.

In October 2019 French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire released an audit report on the construction of the heavily delayed and nearly four times over-budget Flamanville 3 EPR development, started by Areva in 2007. The Finance Minister demanded EDF present within a month an action plan for the project, calling it a &quot;failure for the entire French nuclear industry&quot;.

===Effect of coronavirus pandemic===
In April 2020 EDF estimated the economic slowdown due to the coronavirus pandemic could potentially reduce electricity consumption in France by 20%. EDF estimated annual nuclear output in France would be about 300 TWh in 2020 and 330-360 TWh in 2021 and 2022, down from a pre-coronavirus estimate of 375-390 TWh. Some nuclear reactors will likely be taken offline in the summer of 2020. EDF announced it had withdrawn financial targets for 2020 and 2021. A delay of planned 10-year reactor upgrades this year may be necessary.

To mitigate the impact EDF is targeting €500 million of cost savings to 2022, and aims to sell €3 billion of assets to 2022.

===2021 stress corrosion cracking crisis===

In October 2021, stress corrosion cracking in stainless steel safety system piping was discovered, eventually requiring rolling fleet-wide shutdowns for inspections and repair during 2022 and 2023. This reduced electricity production in 2022 to 279 TWh, 82 TWh less than expected, with a continuing shortfall in 2023. To meet demand, EDF had to buy electricity on the European market at high prices, costing an estimated €29 billion to June 2023.

In late May 2022, when 12 nuclear reactors were offline, EDF increased the estimated earnings reductions for the inspections and repairs to €18.5 billion.

===2021 global energy crisis===
EDF had to sell a further 20 TWh of power to other domestic suppliers at a reduced price due to the government response to the 2021 global energy crisis. In January 2022, EDF calculated that the increase in reduced price wholesale supply would cost it €8.4 billion (£7 billion), and it withdrew its profit guidance. The EDF share price fell considerably. EDF&#x27;s debt is about €41 billion, and Fitch Ratings lowered EDF&#x27;s credit rating.

===2022 Re-nationalization===
On 6 July 2022, French prime minister Élisabeth Borne announced that &quot;the French government is aiming for a full nationalization of&quot; EDF. Borne &quot;vowed&quot; to limit the impact of the rise in energy prices through the state having &quot;full control over...electricity production and performance.” Borne told parliament, &quot;we must ensure our sovereignty in the face of...the colossal challenges to come.&quot; Earlier in 2022, President Emmanuel Macron had &quot;suggested&quot; a renationalization of EDF as well as a &quot;big expansion of nuclear energy in the coming decades&quot; however, in 2021, he had to scrap an &quot;overhaul&quot; of EDF, codenamed &quot;Project Hercules,&quot; that would have placed EDF&#x27;s profitable renewables sector in a new company, due to opposition by unions and objections raised by the European Commission.

In March 2023, EDF created the Nuward subsidiary to design and manufacture a small modular reactor, for construction from 2030. In July 2024, EDF announced it was discontinuing the existing design, and will work on an SMR design based on existing rather than innovative technologies, following discussions with prospective SMR customers. In January 2025, EDF announced that the new Nuward conceptual design would be completed by mid-2026 to come to market in the 2030s, with an output of about 400 MWe and usable heat output 100 MWt.

In May 2024, EDF raised a loan of €5.8 billion over 3-5 years to finance the life extension of its older 900 MWe reactors by 10 years beyond 40 years. The loan is part of EDF&#x27;s Green Financing Framework which is in accord with the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities which allows for private-public financing.

===Plug-in hybrids and V2G===
EDF has developed recharging points for the Toyota Plug-in HV in France

The French government has contributed $550 million to a partnership by Électricité de France with Renault-Nissan and with PSA Peugeot Citroen.

===Photovoltaics===
In 2018 EDF had plans to invest up to €25 billion in photovoltaics solar power generation, and introduce green electricity tariffs.

===Carbon Intensity===

===Tidal farms===
*Paimpol–Bréhat tidal farm

==Competitors==
As of 2017, EDF still held the business of 85.5% of France&#x27;s residential customers, though on a slow downward trend.

===Main competitors===

Apart from foreign producers and distributors, there are some significant competitors of EDF in France, although their market share is weaker in comparison:

*Engie: the company formed after the merger of Gaz de France and Suez clearly intends to produce its own electricity, has bought stake in the future EPR nuclear reactors and is poised to become the most credible competitor of EDF in the newly liberalised French electricity market;
*SNET (Société nationale d&#x27;électricité et de thermique): This company is the successor of depleting coal companies and primarily produce thermal electricity (2.5 TWh). Its capital (81%) belonged predominantly to Collieries of France and with EDF. A portion of the capital (30%) was sold to Endesa, the main Spanish electricity producer, another portion of 35% was sold in 2004. As of 2008 Endesa holds 65% of the equity of the generating company Snet;
*CNR (Compagnie nationale du Rhône): the capital of which is predominantly public, the company exploits 19 hydroelectric plants installed on the banks of the Rhône. Its production of 19 TWh makes it the second largest French producer with 4% of the market. CNR signed a partnership agreement with Electrabel;
*SHEM (Société hydro-électrique du Midi): a subsidiary of SNCF, of which produces about one-third of the electricity used by SNCF. A partnership agreement was signed with Electrabel.

===Locally controlled or between local councils===

Among the other rivals of EDF, one can count a number of municipally governed companies, known under the generic term &#x27;entreprises locales de distribution&#x27; (&#x27;local businesses of distribution&#x27;), who are electricity producers exploiting EDF&#x27;s network.

The nationalisation of electricity and gas on 8 April 1946, which profoundly changed the French electrical and gas organization, had however acknowledged the right of villages to keep their role in the public distribution of electricity and gas.

In 1946, certain firms, villages or groups of villages, did not accept the proposal of nationalisation and created autonomous state controls (who held the monopoly of distribution, until 2004, in their area). To note, contrary to the initial idea, local controllers of electricity, have had, since 1946, the choice to continue to produce electricity. In fact, their production was rather marginal, except in Rhône-Alpes; having often preferred buying the majority of the electrical power from EDF. With the recent opening of the electricity market, local controllers are considering developing, augmenting and diversifying their own production, (e.g. Ouest Énergie, the subsidiary company of SIEDS) and/or diversifying their sources of supply.

To date, the number of local businesses of distribution is approximately 170 and holds 5% of the distribution of French electrical power in 2,500 villages. Created by local authorities, they serve about 3 million people and represent 7,000 jobs. Around thirty of them – 9 during creation in 1962 – are federated in a national entity known as ANROC.

Several departments are not, therefore, served entirely or partly by EDF, for instance:
*Deux-Sèvres, supplied by SIEDS: partnership between local councils of Electricity of Deux-Sèvres;
*Vienne, supplied by SIEEDV: partnership between local councils of Electricity and Works of the Department of Vienne;
*Charente-Maritime, supplied by SDEER: partnership of Electricity and Rural Works of the Department of Charente-Maritime;
*Gironde, supplied by Gironde Electricity. However, the company was sold to EDF at the beginning of 2000 because it could not financially maintain the damage of the severe weather of December 1999, on its network;
*Alsace;
*Rhône-Alpes.

=== Security ===
Enedis was one of the first companies to carry out preventive maintenance on these wooden poles, with the aim of safeguarding the safety of its personnel, in particular with the Polux tool, which has become its reference standard.

<doc id="1000568" wikidata="Q1339127" url="?curid=1000568" title="Indiction">
<text>An indiction (, impost) was a periodic reassessment of taxation in the Roman Empire which took place every fifteen years. In Late Antiquity, this 15-year cycle began to be used to date documents and it continued to be used for this purpose in Medieval Europe, and can also refer to an individual year in the cycle; for example, &quot;the fourth indiction&quot; came to mean the fourth year of the current indiction. Since the cycles themselves were not numbered, other information is needed to identify the specific year.

==History==
Indictions originally referred to the periodic reassessment for an agricultural or land tax in the Roman Empire. There were three different cycles: a 15-year cycle used throughout the empire; a 14-year cycle used in Roman Egypt; and a five year cycle called the &quot;lustrum&quot;, derived from the Roman Republican census. Changes to the tax system usually took place at the beginning of one of these cycles and at the end of the indiction Emperors often chose to forgive any arrears. The 15-year cycle can be traced in literary and epigraphic references to taxation reforms and the cancellation of arrears.

===Principate===
The &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot; (c. 630 AD) claims that the 15-year cycle was instituted by Julius Caesar in 49 BC, which was also the first year of the Antiochene era, but there is no other evidence for this and, if the cycle were the same one known from later periods, the start date ought to be 48 BC. The earliest known event associated with the 15-year cycle is the establishment of a special board of three praetors to pursue arrears for the cycle ending in 42 AD, under Claudius. The beginning of the cycle in 58 AD coincides with a set of tax reforms and remissions instituted by Nero. Vespasian carried out a census of Italy at the start of the next indiction in 73 AD The indiction starting in 103 AD may coincide with the tax remission by Trajan depicted on the Plutei of Trajan. At the start of the next indiction in 118 AD, Hadrian wrote off 900,000,000 sesterces of tax arrears, which he refers to in an inscription as the largest remission ever granted. He again remitted arrears at the start of the next indiction in AD 133, as did Antoninus Pius at the start of the next indiction in 148 AD. Marcus Aurelius and Commodus carried out another remission at the start of the indiction beginning in 178 AD. 

The 14-year cycle used in Egypt derived from the fact that liability for the Egyptian poll tax began at the age of fourteen, necessitating a new survey of the population every fourteen years. Tax reforms and remissions recorded in papyrus sources indicate that it was also in existence in the first century AD. The first evidence is an edict by Marcus Mettius Rufus, the Prefect of Egypt in AD 89, requiring property and loans to be registered. The next cycle in 103 AD coincides with reforms to record-keeping. The beginning of the cycle in 117 AD coincided with the 15-year cycle and was the occasion of Hadrian&#x27;s large tax remission. This 14-year cycle is last attested in 257 AD. From 287 AD, at the latest, Roman Egypt used a system of 5-year cycles, then a non-cyclic series which reached number 26 by 318 AD.

===Late Antiquity and Middle Ages===
The 15-year cycle was introduced as a dating system on documents throughout the Roman empire by Constantine in 312 AD and it was in used in Egypt by 314 AD. The &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot; (c. 630 AD) assigned its first year to 312–313 AD, whereas a Coptic document of 933 AD assigned its first year to 297–298 AD, one cycle earlier. Both of these were years of the Alexandrian calendar whose first day was Thoth 1 on August 29 in years preceding common Julian years and August 30 in years preceding leap years, hence each straddled two Julian years. The reason for beginning the year at that time was that the harvest would be in, and so it was an appropriate moment to calculate the taxes that should be paid.

The indiction was first used to date documents unrelated to tax collection in the mid-fourth century. By the late fourth century it was being used to date documents throughout the Mediterranean. In the Eastern Roman Empire outside of Egypt, the first day of its year was September 23, the birthday of Augustus. During the last half of the fifth century, probably 462 AD, this shifted to September 1, where it remained throughout the rest of the Byzantine Empire. In 537 AD, Justinian decreed that all dates must include the indiction via , which eventually caused the Byzantine year to begin on . But in the western Mediterranean, its first day was according to Bede, or the following or , called the papal indiction. An &quot;indictio Senensis&quot; beginning is sometimes mentioned.

The 7,980-year Julian Period was formed by multiplying the 15-year indiction cycle, the 28-year solar cycle and the 19-year Metonic cycle.

==Terminology==
When the term &quot;indiction&quot; began to be used, it referred only to the full cycle, and individual years were referred to as being Year 1 of the indiction, Year 2 of the indiction, etc. It gradually became common to apply the term to the years themselves, which thus became the first indiction, the second indiction, and so on.

==Calculation==
A useful chart providing all the equivalents can be found in Chaîne&#x27;s book on chronology, and can easily be consulted online at the Internet Archive, from to . 

The Roman indiction for a modern Anno Domini year &quot;Y&quot; (January 1 to December 31) may be calculated as follows:
:(&quot;Y&quot; + 3) mod 15

For example, the indiction for the year 2017 is 10:
:(2017 + 3) mod 15 = 10

However, this formula will produce an error for the last year of an indiction, where the modulo value is 0 instead of the expected 15, as can be seen when applying it to the year 2022:

:(2022+3) mod 15 = 0

One can simply read 0 as 15, but in order to have the correct result directly, the addition of a value of 1 from the offset may be delayed until after the mod operation:
:(&quot;Y&quot; + 2) mod 15 + 1

That yields the expected answer, for 2022 again:
:(2022+2) mod 15 + 1 = 15
