<text>Fell&#x27;s Point is a historic waterfront neighborhood in southeastern Baltimore, Maryland, established around 1763 along the north shore of the Baltimore Harbor and the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River. Located 1.5 miles east of Baltimore&#x27;s downtown central business district, Fells Point is known for its maritime history and character.

The neighborhood has numerous antique, music, and other stores, restaurants, coffee bars, a municipal markethouse with individual stalls, and over 120 pubs.

Across its 250 year history, Fells Point has hosted large large immigrant communities, including Irish, Germans, Jews, Poles, Ukrainians, Russians, Czechs, and Slovaks. Since the 1970s, middle- to upper-middle-income residents have increasingly adopted the area, restoring and preserving historic homes and businesses. Sometimes now called &quot;Spanish Town,&quot; Upper Fell&#x27;s Point to the north along Broadway has gained a sizable Latino community, primarily Mexican and Central American immigrants, mostly since the 1980s

This Fells Point waterfront is an upscale residential area and tourist destination featuring first rate hotels and restaurants. A short walk from the Inner Harbor, the neighborhood can be reached by foot, water taxi barges, bus or car. It is one of several areas in and around Baltimore listed on the National Register of Historic Places, (maintained by the National Park Service), the first designated from Maryland, and is one of the first registered historic districts in the United States to combine two separate waterfront communities (along with Federal Hill to the southwest across the Patapsco River and the Harbor on the &quot;Old South Baltimore&quot; peninsula of &quot;Whetstone Point&quot; at Fort McHenry).

== History ==
First described by a European seafarer as &quot;Long Island Point&quot; in 1670, the area later to be known as Fells Point was a thin little peninsula jutting out southwestward between the streams of Jones Falls and Harford Run (later covered over by Central Avenue) to the west and Harris Creek to the east (now culverted beneath the community of Canton) and further east to Colgate Creek (now surrounded by the Dundalk and Sea Girt Marine Terminals). Later land was patented with the title of &quot;Copus Harbor&quot;. Nearby Baltimore Town to the west at the headwater of the Patapsco River&#x27;s Northwest Branch was land patented under the name of &quot;Cole&#x27;s Harbor&quot; and &quot;Todd&#x27;s Range&quot; to William Cole and later sold to Charles and Daniel Carroll. This area was later established as a &quot;port of entry&quot; by the General Assembly of the Province of Maryland in 1706. After several local farmers and plantation owners originally planning to establish a town on the northeastern shores of the Middle Branch of the Patapsco (also known as &quot;Ridgeley&#x27;s Cove&quot;) were stymied by the objections of local owner William Moale, who thought the land was too valuable as a site of iron ore deposits. So the new town site was moved further to the northeast to the head of the Northwest Branch. Established as a town by the authority of the Colonial Assembly on July 30, 1729, (and signed by Governor Benedict Leonard Calvert on August 8), several streets were laid out in the &quot;Original Survey&quot; of January 12, 1730, with the main one going east-to-west called &quot;Long Street&quot; (later by the 1760s as &quot;Market Street&quot;, then renamed East and West Baltimore Streets) and several others intersecting from north-to-south such as Forrest (later Charles), Calvert, running north from &quot;The Basin&quot; (today&#x27;s Inner Harbor) in 1730.

Joined in 1732, to the northeast along the banks of the stream &quot;Jones Falls&quot; (which originates in northern Baltimore County near the Pennsylvania border) by the laying out of several streets on a northwest to southeast angle by David Jones and named &quot;Jones&#x27;s Town&quot; with streets such as Front, High, and Low. Founded by William Fell, who was attracted by its deep water and proximity to agriculture and thick forests, Fell&#x27;s Point became a shipbuilding and commercial center. About 1763, William&#x27;s son Edward Fell laid out streets and began selling plots for homes. The waterfront village port grew quickly, and eventually incorporated with nearby Baltimore Town to the west and Jones Town to the northwest (which had merged in 1745) in 1773 to form a new Town of Baltimore and later beginning in 1796 and taking effect in January 1797, becoming incorporated by the State of Maryland&#x27;s act of the General Assembly to become the City of Baltimore (under the title of &quot;the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore&quot;).

In 1784, the combined town&#x27;s market house system was expanded from the original first Centre Market (later known as &quot;Marsh Market&quot;) on Market Place (between East Pratt Street to the south and Long Street (later called Market Street, then East Baltimore Street) to the north from 1767. Two additional market areas were established shortly after the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1784. Known first as the &quot;Western Precincts Market&quot; and renamed later as the Lexington Market (by future West Lexington and North Eutaw Streets) on land donated by Continental Army Col. John Eager Howard (1752-1827), an influential Baltimore citizen with a large estate named &quot;Belvidere&quot; surrounding the town to the west and north). To the east borders of the town in that same year was the new &quot;Eastern Precincts Market&quot;, also later renamed Fells Point Market or Broadway Market which was located for several blocks length between Fleet Street and Thames Street at the harborside. Later the municipal market system extended to include 12 markets spread throughout the center city by the early 20th century. All became focal point and gathering places for their neighborhoods and attracted customers from the entire city and metropolitan area. The area grew wealthy on the tobacco, flour, and coffee trades overseas through the 18th and 19th centuries.

Fell&#x27;s Point shipyards became best known for producing topsail schooners, sometimes called &quot;Baltimore clippers&quot;, renowned for their great speed and handling. They were excellent blockade runners, and were frequently used as armed privateers. The schooner &quot;Pride of Baltimore II&quot; is based on the &quot;Chasseur&quot;, built by Thomas Kemp, which was one of the most successful privateers built in Fell&#x27;s Point during the War of 1812.

During the War of 1812 (1812-1815), Fells Point&#x27;s yards built and supported dozens of privateers which preyed on British shipping vessels. Between 1810 and 1815, the yards produced over 150 schooners. Consequently, Baltimore became a principal target of the British during the war, which eventually led to the attack on the city and the bombardment of Fort McHenry in September 1814. Because of this, many people have claimed the British referred to Baltimore as a &quot;nest of pirates&quot;, citing Hezekiah Niles&#x27; &quot;Niles&#x27; Weekly Register&quot;, the famous nationally circulated newspaper. However, no such reference has ever been found to support that claim.

It has been an immigrant neighborhood since the 19th century, in part because it was a major point of entry into the United States, but mainly because jobs were available in Baltimore&#x27;s industries and on the waterfront. In the era before mass transportation, immigrants crowded into the cheap housing near the shipbuilding yards, warehouses and factories of Fells Point. This added to the multicultural fabric of the area, but also caused the more affluent to move into other parts of the city.

In 1835, the later famous abolitionist, writer/author, public speaker/orator, agitator and minister/ambassador Frederick Douglass (1818-1895), while still enslaved, was hired out to the shipbuilder John A. Robb as a caulker at the Fells Point shipyard. In his autobiography, Douglass recounts that, years earlier, the first time he had been sent to Baltimore, the Fells Point neighborhood was where he taught himself to read and write, copying the letters with which the men in the shipyard labeled boards and &quot;making friends of all the little white boys whom I met in the street. As many of these as I could, I converted into teachers.&quot;

Fells Point remained a shipbuilding center until the Civil War, when it could no longer handle the larger ships (also now built with steam power and paddle wheels/screw propellers) then coming into use. Likewise, the shipping industry slowly moved away to larger facilities, some of the newer shipyards further downriver with deeper waters close to shore on the outer Patapsco River, and the Fells Point area became a manufacturing center, with innovations in canning, along with nearby Canton to the east, which was an early commercial/industrial and residential development by the Canton Company of the O&#x27;Donnell family and Pattersons in the early 1800s. and packing. The neighborhood escaped serious damage during the Great Baltimore Fire of February 1904, which destroyed the downtown financial area further west. Eventually, much of the manufacturing left the city by the 1980s, resulting in urban decay until preservationists in the 1960s, 1970s and late 20th century organized to save the area&#x27;s historic buildings and neighborhood waterfront fabric along with Federal Hill on the other western side of the newly renamed with proposed redevelopment of the Inner Harbor (formerly called &quot;The Basin&quot;) from a proposed East-West Highway of Interstate 95 which was to run north to south down the East Coast states, begun in the mid-1960s.

After World War II (1939/41-1945), many out-migrants from rural Appalachia settled in Fell&#x27;s Point. In the 1960s, following the civil rights movement, many African Americans settled in the neighborhood.

In 1965, city, state and some federal transit planners proposed to link Interstate 83 (Jones Falls Expressway going north from downtown since 1962), with Interstate 70 (a cross-country highway stretching west to east - from Baltimore to Sacramento, California, but would be designated here as I-70 West) and Interstate 95, (the main East Coast, Maine to Florida super-highway) by building an elevated highway along the north shore of the Baltimore Harbor and Port. This project would have entailed extensive demolition within Fells Point, and across the river in Federal Hill/South Baltimore and the highway would have cut off the remainder of the neighborhood from the waterfront. An &quot;expressway revolt&quot; against the proposals was raised by local residents and derailed the project. Another proposal had I-83 going under the harbor in an alignment that completely avoided Fells Point, but that was scrapped as well. Fells Point&#x27;s addition to the National Register of Historic Places (supervised by the National Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior) prevented the use of federal funds for the road project, and contributed to the project&#x27;s cancellation. One of the leaders of the revolt was social worker Barbara Mikulski, who was later elected a City Council member and later a U.S. Representative followed by as a U.S. Senator from Maryland, one of the first women elected to that upper chamber of the United States Congress and by 2014, one of the longest serving when she retired.

Fells Point achieved some fame as the central setting for the 1990s NBC TV network police drama &quot;&quot;, (based on the book &quot;&quot; by David Simon of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, the city&#x27;s longtime daily newspaper) and has been the site of many films shot in Baltimore.

Fells Point, located to the east of the Inner Harbor, suffered extensive flooding during Hurricane Isabel in September 2003, with water as high as 10 feet.

== Architecture ==
Fells Point includes a diversity of historic architecture. Flemish bond brickwork is used in some of the earliest homes, while row housing is prominent of nineteenth and early twentieth century construction. Gabled roof buildings and Victorian homes are also interspersed with other housing and use types.

Historic buildings include:
* The Robert Long House, at 812 South Ann Street, built in 1765, is the oldest surviving home in Baltimore.
* Lloyd Street Synagogue, at Lloyd and Watson Streets, in adjacent Jonestown / Old Town neighborhood, an 1845, Greek Revival styled architecture building. Baltimore architects Robert Cary Long, Jr. and William Reasin designed the historic building. It is the third oldest Jewish synagogue building still standing in the United States.
* The Saint Patrick Catholic Church (founded in 1792, current building on Broadway, completed in 1898) one of the first parishes in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore, was unfortunately damaged in the 2011 Virginia earthquake. While the building was condemned and the steeple sustained significant damage, the building reopened for Mass on Ash Wednesday in 2012.

== Awards ==
In 2012, Fells Point was selected by the American Planning Association as one of the Great Places in America (neighborhood category), which &quot;celebrates places of exemplary character, quality, and planning&quot;.

== Annual festivals ==

&quot;Fell&#x27;s Point Fun Festival&quot; started in 1966 in response to the proposed I-95 freeway that was to run through the neighborhood. The original purpose of the festival was to raise money to help save Fell&#x27;s Point and to raise awareness of the historical significance of the neighborhood and its plight. The weekend-long Fun Festival, celebrated in October, has an estimated attendance of over 700,000. The event includes entertainment, arts and crafts vendors, and cultural and culinary offerings.

&quot;Fell&#x27;s Point Privateer Festival&quot; is an annual weekend-long festival in April celebrating the privateer and maritime history of Fell&#x27;s Point. Activities include educational demonstrations, a pub crawl, pet costume contest, and pyrate&#x27;s ball.

&quot;Halloween in Fell&#x27;s Point&quot; occurs annually on October 31 celebrating Halloween. The informal gathering takes place in and around Broadway Square and Thames Street. As the evening goes on, hundreds of individuals come dressed in costume and participate in taking photos, trick-or-treating, and pub crawling.

&quot;Fell&#x27;s Point Olde Tyme Christmas Festival&quot; is held during the first weekend in December and includes a traditional Christmas market, pet costume contest, and a Reindeer Run pub crawl.

<text>Samisdat debuted as &quot;The Berkeley Samisdat Review&quot; in June 1973 and over a period of two decades published 244 issues. &quot;Samisdat&quot; was from the beginning an anti-war, anti-establishment, anti-communist, anti-nuclear power, pro-animal, and pro-vegetarian literary magazine. Over 1000 authors appeared in &quot;Samisdat&quot;, and for some it was their first appearance in print; some of these authors went on to successful careers as authors or poets.

&quot;Samisdat&quot; was published by self-described &quot;Gandhian anarchist&quot; Merritt Clifton. Clifton and &quot;Samisdat&quot; were influenced by the Gandhian philosophical newspaper Manas Journal, published by the late Henry Geiger. Like many publications from the Underground Press, it was spurned by print shops because of its content. As a result, the publisher obtained his own offset press which he operated himself.

Clifton eventually published &quot;The Samisdat Method&quot; which described the practical aspects of purchase and use of an offset press by authors with no background in the printing trade. The book went through several editions and eventually saw publication and distribution by the book trade. It is now out of print.

<text>This is a list of known Taíno, some of whom were &quot;caciques&quot; (male and female tribal chiefs). Their names are in ascending alphabetical order and the table may be re-sorted by clicking on the arrows in the column header cells.

The Taíno were the Indigenous inhabitants of the Bahamas, Greater Antilles, and some of the Lesser Antilles – especially in Guadeloupe, Dominica and Martinique. The Taíno (&quot;Taíno&quot; means &quot;peace&quot;), were peaceful seafaring people and distant relatives of the Arawak people of South America.

Taíno society was divided into two classes: &quot;Nitaino&quot; (nobles) and the &quot;Naboria&quot; (commoners). Both were governed by chiefs known as &quot;caciques&quot;, who were the maximum authority in a &quot;Yucayeque&quot; (village). The chiefs were advised by priest-healers known as a &quot;Bohique&quot; and the &quot;Nitayno&quot;, which is how the elders and warriors were known.

This is an incomplete list, which may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. Anyone can help by expanding it with reliably sourced entries.

<text>Generation Warriors is a science fiction novel by American writers Anne McCaffrey and Elizabeth Moon. published by Baen Books in 1991. It concludes the &quot;Planet Pirates&quot; trilogy (1990–1991), which McCaffrey wrote alternately with Moon and Jody Lynn Nye, and is the last book in the &quot;Ireta&quot; series that she initiated with &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot; in 1978.

==Summary==
The title character from the first book of the trilogy - Sassinak - teams up with the main character from the second - her great-great-great-grandmother Lunzie - to end the threat posed by planet pirates. The granddaughter is over a decade older than her ancestor because the latter went through several lengthy periods of stasis (known as cold sleep) leading to questions of who is the &quot;more experienced&quot; elder.

<text>Dick Wilson (July 30, 1916 – November 18, 2007) was a British-American actor. He was best known as grocery store manager Mr. George Whipple in more than 500 Charmin bathroom tissue television commercials (1965–89, 1999–2000).

==Biography==
Wilson was born on July 30, 1916, in Preston, Lancashire. His father soon moved the family to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. He got his start in show business with a part-time job at CHML radio in Hamilton at age 15. He graduated from the Ontario College of Art &amp; Design. Paid in dance lessons, he became a comedic acrobatic dancer and performed in vaudeville for 20 years, according to Procter &amp; Gamble.

Wilson had taught himself to fly when he was 16 years old, working for a time as a bush pilot who flew supplies to mining camps in remote regions of Canada. His earlier experience got him into military flight training and he became a bomber pilot. After the Second World War where he served in the Royal Canadian Air Force and Royal Air Force, he moved to the United States and became an American citizen in 1954, heading to California that same year to work as a film and television actor.

Wilson made numerous appearances on &quot;Bewitched&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;Tabitha&quot; and &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, and &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;. Wilson was quoted as saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve done thirty-eight pictures and nobody remembers any of them, but they all remember me selling toilet paper.&quot; He made 504 commercials as Mr. Whipple, earning U.S. $300,000 annually while working only 12–16 days a year.

In an interview with ABC News on April 22, 1983, he mentioned that the first series of commercials for Charmin he appeared in were filmed in, appropriately enough, Flushing, New York City. He described acting in commercials as &quot;the hardest thing to do in the entire acting realm. You&#x27;ve got 24 seconds to introduce yourself, introduce the product, say something nice about it and get off gracefully.&quot;

==Death==
Wilson died on November 18, 2007, at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, California, at the age of 91. He was survived by his wife, Meg; his son, Stuart F. Wilson (a stunt coordinator); his two daughters (Wendy Wilson and actress Melanie Wilson); and his five grandchildren. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills.

<text>The northern crested newt, great crested newt or warty newt (Triturus cristatus) is a newt species native to Great Britain, northern and central continental Europe and parts of Western Siberia. It is a large newt, with females growing up to long. Its back and sides are dark brown, while the belly is yellow to orange with dark blotches. Males develop a conspicuous jagged crest on their back and tail during the breeding season.

The northern crested newt spends most of the year on land, mainly in forested areas in lowlands. It moves to aquatic breeding sites, mainly larger fish-free ponds, in spring. Males court females with a ritualised display and deposit a spermatophore on the ground, which the female then picks up with her cloaca. After fertilisation, a female lays around 200 eggs, folding them into water plants. The larvae develop over two to four months before metamorphosing into terrestrial juveniles (efts). Both larvae and land-dwelling newts mainly feed on different invertebrates.

Several of the northern crested newt&#x27;s former subspecies are now recognised as separate species in the genus &quot;Triturus&quot;. Its closest relative is the Danube crested newt (&quot;T. dobrogicus&quot;). It sometimes forms hybrids with some of its relatives, including the marbled newt (&quot;T. marmoratus&quot;). Although today the most widespread &quot;Triturus&quot; species, the northern crested newt was probably confined to small refugial areas in the Carpathians during the Last Glacial Maximum.

While the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists it as Least Concern species, populations of the northern crested newt have been declining. The main threat is habitat destruction, for example, through urban sprawl. The species is listed as a European Protected Species.

==Taxonomy==

The northern crested newt was described as &quot;Triton cristatus&quot; by Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in 1768. As Linnaeus had already used the name &quot;Triton&quot; for a genus of sea snails ten years before, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque introduced the new genus name &quot;Triturus&quot; in 1815, with &quot;T. cristatus&quot; as type species.

Over 40 scientific names introduced over time are now considered as synonyms, including &quot;Lacertus aquatilis&quot;, a &quot;nomen oblitum&quot; published four years before Laurenti&#x27;s species name. Hybrids resulting from the cross of a crested newt male with a marbled newt (&quot;Triturus marmoratus&quot;) female were mistakenly described as distinct species &quot;Triton blasii&quot;, and the reverse hybrids as &quot;Triton trouessarti&quot;.

&quot;T. cristatus&quot; was long considered as a single species, the &quot;crested newt&quot;, with several subspecies. Substantial genetic differences between these subspecies were, however, noted and eventually led to their recognition as full species, often collectively referred to as &quot;&quot;T. cristatus&quot; species complex&quot;. There are now seven accepted species of crested newts, of which the northern crested newt is the most widespread.

==Description==


The northern crested newt is a relatively large newt species. Males usually reach total length, while females grow up to . Rare individuals of have been recorded. Other crested newt species are more stockily built; only the Danube crested newt (&quot;T. dobrogicus&quot;) is more slender. Body shape is correlated with skeletal build: The northern crested newt has 15 rib-bearing vertebrae, only the Danube crested newt has more (16–17), while the other, more stocky &quot;Triturus&quot; species have 14 or less.

The newts have rough skin, and are dark brown on the back and sides, with black spots and heavy white stippling on the flanks. The female has a yellow line running along the lower tail edge. The throat is mixed yellow–black with fine white stippling, the belly yellow to orange with dark, irregular blotches.

During the aquatic breeding season, males develop crest up to high, which runs along the back and tail but is interrupted at the tail base. It is heavily indented on the back but smoother on the tail. Also during breeding season, the male&#x27;s cloaca swells and it has a blue–white flash running along the sides of the tail. Females do not develop a crest.

==Range==

The northern crested newt is the most widespread and northerly crested newt species. The northern edge of its range runs from Great Britain through southern Fennoscandia to the Republic of Karelia in Russia; the southern margin runs through central France, southwest Romania, Moldavia and Ukraine, heading from there into central Russia and through the Ural Mountains. The eastern extent of the great crested newt&#x27;s range reaches into Western Siberia, running from the Perm Krai to the Kurgan Oblast.

In western France, the species co-occurs and sometimes hybridises (see section &quot;Evolution&quot; below) with the marbled newt (&quot;Triturus marmoratus&quot;). In southeast Europe, its range borders that of the Italian crested newt (&quot;T. carnifex&quot;), the Danube crested newt (&quot;T. dobrogicus&quot;), the Macedonian crested newt (&quot;T. macedonicus&quot;) and the Balkan crested newt (&quot;T. ivanbureschi&quot;).

==Habitat==


Outside of the breeding season, northern crested newts are mainly forest-dwellers. They prefer deciduous woodlands or groves, but conifer woods are also accepted, especially in the far northern and southern ranges. In the absence of forests, other cover-rich habitats, as for example hedgerows, scrub, swampy meadows, or quarries, can be inhabited.

Preferred aquatic breeding sites are stagnant, mid- to large-sized, unshaded water bodies with abundant underwater vegetation but without fish (which prey on larvae). Typical examples are larger ponds, which need not be of natural origin; indeed, most ponds inhabited in the United Kingdom are human-made. Examples of other suitable secondary habitats are ditches, channels, gravel pit lakes, or garden ponds. Other newts that can sometimes be found in the same breeding sites are the smooth newt (&quot;Lissotriton vulgaris&quot;), the palmate newt (&quot;L. helveticus&quot;), the Carpathian newt (&quot;L. montadoni&quot;), the alpine newt (&quot;Ichthyosaura alpestris&quot;) and the marbled newt (&quot;Triturus marmoratus&quot;).

The northern crested newt is generally a lowland species but has been found up to in the Alps.

== Population structure, speciation, and phylogeny ==

=== Hybridization ===
In certain areas of France, the northern crested newt and the marbled newt overlap, and hybrids are present. As the northern crested newt&#x27;s population grows, and marbled newt population struggles, these hybrids have been shown to possess good qualities of both. They have more fecundity than the two newts however have a hard time keeping their eggs alive.

==Life cycle and behaviour==

Like other newts, &quot;T. cristatus&quot; develops in the water as a larva and returns to the water each year for breeding. Adults spend around seven months of the year on land. After larval development in the first year, juveniles pass another year or two before reaching maturity; in the north and at higher elevations, this can take longer. The larval and juvenile stages are the riskiest for the newts, while survival is higher in adults. Once the risky stages passed, adult newts usually have a lifespan of seven to nine years, although individuals have reached 17 years in the wild.

Adult newts begin moving to their breeding sites in spring when temperatures stay above , usually in March. In the aquatic phase, crested newts are mostly nocturnal and, compared to smaller newt species, usually prefer the deeper parts of a water body, where they hide under vegetation. As with other newts, they have to occasionally move to the surface to breathe air. The aquatic phase serves not only for reproduction, but also offers more abundant prey, and immature crested newts frequently return to the water in spring even if they do not breed.

During the terrestrial phase, the newts use hiding places such as logs, bark, planks, stone walls, or small mammal burrows; several individuals may occupy such refuges at the same time. Since the newts generally stay very close to their aquatic breeding sites, the quality of the surrounding terrestrial habitat largely determines whether an otherwise suitable water body will be colonised. Great crested newts may also climb vegetation during their terrestrial phase, although the exact function of this behaviour is not known at present.

The juvenile efts often disperse to new breeding sites, while the adults in general move back to the same breeding sites each year. The newts do not migrate very far: they may cover around in one night and rarely disperse much farther than . Over most of their range, they hibernate in winter, using mainly subterranean hiding places, where many individuals will often congregate.

===Diet and predators===

Northern crested newts feed mainly on invertebrates. During the land phase, prey include earthworms and other annelids, different insects and their larvae, woodlice, and snails and slugs. During the breeding season, they prey on various aquatic invertebrates (such as molluscs [particularly small bivalves], microcrustaceans, and insects), and also tadpoles and juveniles of other amphibians such as the common frog or common toad, and smaller newts (including conspecifics). Larvae, depending on their size, eat small invertebrates and tadpoles, and also smaller larvae of their own species.

The larvae are themselves eaten by various animals such as carnivorous invertebrates and water birds, and are especially vulnerable to predatory fish. Adults generally avoid predators through their hidden lifestyle but are sometimes eaten by herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and mammals such as shrews, badgers and hedgehogs. They secrete the poison tetrodotoxin from their skin, albeit much less than for example the North American Pacific newts (&quot;Taricha&quot;). The bright yellow or orange underside of crested newts is a warning coloration which can be presented in case of perceived danger. In such a posture, the newts typically roll up and secrete a milky substance.

===Courtship and reproduction===


Northern crested newts, like their relatives in the genus &quot;Triturus&quot;, perform a complex courtship display, where the male attracts a female through specific body movements and waves pheromones to her. The males are territorial and use small patches of clear ground as leks, or courtship arenas. When successful, they guide the female over a spermatophore they deposit on the ground, which she then takes up with her cloaca.

The eggs are fertilised internally, and the female deposits them individually, usually folding them into leaves of aquatic plants. A female takes around five minutes for the deposition of one egg. They usually lay around 200 eggs per season. Embryos are usually light-coloured, 1.8–2 mm in diameter with a 6 mm jelly capsule, which distinguishes them from eggs of other co-existing newt species that are smaller and darker-coloured. A genetic particularity shared with other &quot;Triturus&quot; species causes 50% of the embryos to die.

Larvae hatch after two to five weeks, depending on temperature. As in all salamanders and newts, forelimbs develop first, followed later by the back legs. Unlike smaller newts, crested newt larvae are mostly nektonic, swimming freely in the water column. Just before the transition to land, the larvae their external gills; they can at this stage reach a size of . Metamorphosis into terrestrial efts takes place two to four months after hatching, again depending on temperature. Survival of larvae from hatching to metamorphosis has been estimated at a mean of roughly 4%. In unfavourable conditions, larvae may delay their development and overwinter in water, although this seems to be less common than in the small-bodied newts.

==Evolution==

The northern crested newt sometimes hybridises with other crested newt species where their ranges meet, but overall, the different species are reproductively isolated. In a case study in the Netherlands, genes of the introduced Italian crested newt (&quot;T. carnifex&quot;) were found to introgress into the gene pool of the native northern crested newt. The closest relative of the northern crested newt, according to molecular phylogenetic analyses, is the Danube crested newt (&quot;T. dobrogicus&quot;).

In western France, the northern crested newt&#x27;s range overlaps with that of the marbled newt (&quot;T. marmoratus&quot;), but the two species in general prefer different habitats. When they do occur in the same breeding ponds, they can form hybrids, which have intermediate characteristics. Hybrids resulting from the cross of a crested newt male with a marbled newt female are much rarer due to increased mortality of the larvae and consist only of males. In the reverse cross, males have lower survival rates than females. Overall, viability is reduced in these hybrids and they rarely backcross with their parent species. Hybrids made up 3–7% of the adult populations in different studies.

Little genetic variation was found over most of the species&#x27; range, except in the Carpathians. This suggests that the Carpathians was a refugium during the Last Glacial Maximum. The northern crested newt then expanded its range north-, east- and westwards when the climate rewarmed.

==Threats and conservation==

The northern crested newt is listed as species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, but populations are declining. It is rare in some parts of its range and listed in several national red lists.

The major reason for decline is habitat destruction through urban and agricultural development, affecting the aquatic breeding sites as well as the land habitats. Their limited dispersal makes the newts especially vulnerable to fragmentation, i.e. the loss of connections for exchange between suitable habitats. Other threats include the introduction of fish and crayfish into breeding ponds, collection for the pet trade in its eastern range, warmer and wetter winters due to global warming, genetic pollution through hybridisation with other, introduced crested newt species, the use of road salt, and potentially the pathogenic fungus &quot;Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans&quot;.

The northern crested newt is listed in Berne Convention Appendix II as &quot;strictly protected&quot;. It is also included in Annex II (species requiring designation of special areas of conservation) and IV (species in need of strict protection) of the EU habitats and species directive, as a European Protected Species. As required by these frameworks, its capture, disturbance, killing or trade, as well as the destruction of its habitats, are prohibited in most European countries. The EU habitats directive is also the basis for the Natura 2000 protected areas, several of which have been designated specifically to protect the northern crested newt.

Preservation of natural water bodies, reduction of fertiliser and pesticide use, control or eradication of introduced predatory fish, and the connection of habitats through sufficiently wide corridors of uncultivated land are seen as effective conservation actions. A network of aquatic habitats in proximity is important to sustain populations, and the creation of new breeding ponds is in general very effective as they are rapidly colonised when other habitats are nearby. In some cases, entire populations have been moved when threatened by development projects, but such translocations need to be carefully planned to be successful.

Strict protection of the northern crested newt in the United Kingdom has created conflicts with local development projects, but the species is also seen as a flagship species, whose conservation also benefits a range of other amphibians. Government agencies have issued specific guidelines for the mitigation of development impacts.

<text>Planet of Adventure is a series of four science fiction novels by Jack Vance, published between 1968 and 1970. The novels relate the adventures of the scout Adam Reith, the sole survivor of an Earth ship investigating a signal from the distant planet Tschai.

==Setting==

Tschai is a planet orbiting the star Carina 4269, 212 light-years from Earth. It is populated by various sentient alien species. The native Pnume have been subjected to invasions by three species. In addition, there are humans, captured and brought to the planet long ago by one of the spacefaring species; some of them live as slaves or servants of each of the alien races, while others have managed to create their own societies. Each of the four novels relates Reith&#x27;s adventures with one of the species, and is named after that species. In order, the books are:

*City of the Chasch
*Servants of the Wankh
*The Dirdir
*The Pnume

==Tschai inhabitants==
===Chasch===
The somewhat reptilian Chasch arrived a hundred thousand years prior to the tale&#x27;s start, and are divided into three warring factions, the decadent Old Chasch, the creatively sadistic Blue Chasch, and the barbarian Green Chasch.

===Dirdir===
The birdlike, or feline, predatory Dirdir had warred with the Chasch and the Wankh in the past, but on Tschai maintain an uneasy peace due to their relative military parity. In the first book they are described as &quot;sheep-like&quot;, but Vance appears to have changed their characterization by the third, in which they are compared to leopards. The Dirdir are described as having a very complex sexuality, with many different genders that leads to many different combinations of gender-compatibility when it comes to sex and breeding, though each breeding still seems to involve only two individuals.

===Pnume===
The insect-like Pnume are the original inhabitants of Tschai, with a history that goes back ten million years. They view the invaders as welcome additions to the pageantry on their world stage. They were forced underground by the coming of the more powerful species.

===Phung===
Related to the Pnume are the Phung, solitary sentient predators with bizarre habits. The antics of a Phung feature early on in each of the first three books.

===Wankh (or Wannek)===
The amphibious Wankh (or Wannek) are comparatively recent arrivals and had warred with the Dirdir in the past, but subsided into an uneasy peace due to their relative military parity.

===Humans===
The human client races, the Pnumekin, Chaschmen, Dirdirmen and Wankhmen resemble their alien patrons to some degree, due to selective breeding, surgery and the desire of the humans to emulate their respective masters. The religious fiction that their dead are reborn as Chasch keeps the Chaschmen obedient. The Dirdirmen view themselves as degenerate Dirdir and strive to minimize their differences. The Wankhmen, on the other hand, act as the sole interpreters of the Wankh and as a result, are able to manipulate the alien race to their own advantage. The Pnumekin are kept docile by drugs; the Gzhindra, ostracised and exiled Pnumekin, act as agents for the Pnume. Vance&#x27;s depiction of the human race after tens of thousands of years on Tschai aims to show how foreign humanity can become in alien surroundings.

==Plot==
A human ship is sent to investigate a distress signal sent 212 years ago from the previously unknown planet. The mother ship is destroyed and nearly all of the crew killed in a surprise missile attack (in some editions the mother ship and its crew do not appear). Only two scouts survive, crash-landing on Tschai in their damaged scout-boat. After his companion is killed by human nomads early on, Adam Reith is left stranded alone on an unknown world. The four books describe the attempts of a man of singularly strong will and resource to return to Earth: in the first book to recover his damaged spacecraft, in the second to steal one, in the third to build one, and in the fourth to escape the Pnume, by whom he is kidnapped before he can depart Tschai. In the process, he overcomes the obstacles of dealing with four different alien races and various human groups, often profoundly disrupting the societies, human and alien, with which he is forced to deal. The vast teeming planet, with its clashing civilizations and wildly varying cultures, affects Reith to the point that he realizes that if he succeeds in returning to Earth, his life will seem dull and colourless in comparison.

Reith acquires two faithful human companions in the course of his travels: Traz Onmale, the dour, proud boy-chieftain of a nomad tribe obsessed with emblems, and Ankhe at Afram Anacho, a renegade Dirdirman who is loquacious, fastidious and flamboyant. (Vance has said that the novels were commissioned as a juvenile series, which was why he included Traz; but the action is no less &#x27;adult&#x27; than in his other works.) Anacho and Traz play lesser roles in the fourth book, which chronicles Reith&#x27;s adventures in the underground world of the Pnume, and subsequently on the surface with the rescued Pnumekin woman Zap 210. Romantic interest is provided both by Zap 210 and by the aristocratic Flower of Cath, who features in the first two novels. The third novel also introduces a human villain in the fat and avaricious contractor Aila Woudiver.

Tschai, like Earth, is a world of several discrete continents. The action covers most of the planet, and the second and fourth books describe lengthy sea voyages taken by Reith and his companions. Vance described blue-water sailing as one of his favorite recreations.

==Title changes==
The editors of the Vance Integral Edition restored the author&#x27;s preferred title for the first book: The Chasch. They also altered the second to The Wannek and replaced &#x27;Wankh&#x27; with &#x27;Wannek&#x27; throughout the text. Vance was convinced to change the name after learning of the meaning of the word &#x27;wank&#x27; in British and Commonwealth slang.

==Roleplaying game==
The &quot;Planet of Adventure&quot; setting and characters have also been translated into the form of a paper-and-pencil roleplaying game in the GURPS system. &quot;GURPS: Jack Vance&#x27;s Planet of Adventure&quot; was first published in September 2003 and was written by James L. Cambias.

==Comics adaptation==
A French comic adaptation in eight volumes of the books by Li-An (drawings) and Jean-David Morvan (story) was published by Delcourt from 1998 to 2008.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Planet of Adventure&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #74, and stated that &quot;The narrative is a near-triumph of ironic, exotic style over routinely grotty space-operatic plot [...] The good stuff lies in Tschai&#x27;s rich scents and colours, and in elaboration of style.&quot;

<text>A political organization is any organization that involves itself in the political process, including political parties, non-governmental organizations, and special interest advocacy groups. Political organizations are those engaged in political activities (e.g., lobbying, community organizing, campaign advertising, etc.) aimed at achieving clearly-defined political goals, which typically benefit the interests of their members.

While parties are one type of political organization that may engage in some or all of those activities, they are distinct in that they typically focus on supporting candidates for public office, winning elections and controlling government.

==Political parties==
The most well-known type of political organization is the political party. Political parties are directly involved in the political processes of countries with party systems, of which there are several types.

Some of the most common types are multi-party systems, single party dictatorships, and two party systems.

===Multi-party systems===
In multi-party systems such as India, Pakistan, etc., there is no restriction on the number of parties allowed to be in operation at any given time. Under these types of systems, people are free to participate in the political process both through elections and by forming their own political parties as they please.

Examples of multi-party systems are:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* Philippines
* 

===Single-party systems===
In single-party systems, one political party exercises control over the government. Unlike under other systems, single-party systems do not necessarily extend democratic privileges to the citizens. This means that citizens have little say regarding political subjects.

Examples of single-party systems are:
* 
* 

===Two-party systems===

Two-party systems are similar to multi-party systems in that power is not concentrated in one party and that parties have to consider the opinion of the general public in order to retain power by winning elections.
Most two-party systems are technically multiparty systems but all power is effectively concentrated amongst two parties or coalitions.

Examples of two-party systems are:
* 
* 

==Party coalitions==

Another type of political organization is the party coalition. A party coalition is a group of political parties operating together in parliament. Oftentimes, party coalitions are formed after elections have taken place and no party has clearly won a majority seat in parliament (e.g. the AAP-Congress Government in Delhi). Other coalitions are formed prior to elections and are effectively agreements between two or more parties to run jointly in elections and to pursue similar agendas (e.g. the National Democratic Alliance in India, and the Liberal/National Coalition in Australia). The electoral thresholds for multi-party alliances are set differently in many countries depending on the number of parties.

==Parliamentary groups or Caucus==

Parliamentary groups are groups of some members of the same political party or electoral fusion of parties, also called caucus in the United States Congress and the Parliament of Canada.

==Technical group==

A technical group or mixed group is a heterogenous parliamentary group composed of elected officials from political parties of differing ideologies (or independent of any party) who are not numerous enough to form groups on their own.

==Political group==

A political group is a group composed of multiple political parties or independents of aligned ideologies.

==Labour unions==
A labour union (or trade union) is a political organization formed to promote the interests of workers.

Labour unions have various roles in modern politics, including:
* Organizing strike actions and general strikes
* Negotiating with employers on behalf of workers
* Ensuring that workers are not fired without severance pay
* Assuring that workers receive reasonable salaries

Unlike other political organizations, labor unions do not directly participate in elections, although they may campaign for parties and politicians supporting their positions. Labour unionization is a way for workers to maintain unity and preserve their rights. Often, major corporations antagonize the principle of labor unionization since it results in heavier employment regulations which restrict the powers of big business to fire workers at will, effectively causing economic difficulties for such companies.

<text>Volpone (, Italian for &quot;sly fox&quot;) is a comedy play by English playwright Ben Jonson first produced in 1605–1606, drawing on elements of city comedy and beast fable. A merciless satire of greed and lust, it remains Jonson&#x27;s most-performed play, and it is ranked among the finest Jacobean era comedies.

==Characters==

* Volpone (the Sly Fox) – a greedy and rich childless Venetian &quot;magnifico&quot;
* Mosca (the Fly) – his servant
* Voltore (the Vulture) – a lawyer
* Corbaccio (the Raven) – an avaricious old miser
* Bonario – Corbaccio&#x27;s son
* Corvino (the Carrion Crow) – a merchant
* Celia – Corvino&#x27;s wife
* Sir Politic Would-Be – ridiculous Englishman and husband of Lady Would-Be
* Lady Would-Be (the parrot) – English lady and wife of Sir Politic Would-Be
* Peregrine (&quot;Pilgrim&quot;) – another, more sophisticated, English traveller
* Nano – a dwarf, companion of Volpone
* Androgyno – a hermaphrodite, companion of Volpone
* Castrone – a eunuch, companion of Volpone
* The Avocatori – the judges of Venice

==Synopsis==

Volpone &quot;(The Fox)&quot; is a Venetian gentleman who pretends to be on his deathbed after a long illness in order to dupe Voltore &quot;(The Vulture)&quot;, Corbaccio &quot;(The Raven)&quot; and Corvino &quot;(The Crow)&quot;, three men who aspire to inherit his fortune. In their turns, each man arrives to Volpone&#x27;s house bearing a luxurious gift, intent upon having his name inscribed to the will of Volpone, as his heir. Mosca &quot;(The Fly)&quot;, Volpone&#x27;s parasite servant, encourages each of the visitors to believe that he has been named heir to Volpone&#x27;s fortune. Mosca even persuades Corbaccio to disinherit his own son in favor of Volpone.

To Volpone, Mosca mentions that Corvino has a beautiful wife, Celia. Disguised as Scoto the Mountebank, Volpone goes to see Celia. Corvino drives away &quot;Scoto&quot; (Volpone), who then becomes insistent that he must possess Celia as his own. Mosca deceives Corvino into believing that the moribund Volpone will be cured of his illness if he lies in bed beside a young woman. Believing that Volpone has been rendered impotent by his illness, Corvino offers his wife in order that, when he is revived, Volpone will recognise Corvino as his sole heir.

Just before Corvino and Celia are due to arrive at Volpone&#x27;s house, Corbaccio&#x27;s son Bonario arrives to catch his father in the act of disinheriting him. Mosca guides Bonario to a sideroom, and Volpone and Celia are left alone. Upon failing to seduce Celia with fantastic promises of luxury and wealth, Volpone attempts to rape her. Bonario comes forward to rescue Celia. In the ensuing trial at court, the truth of the matter is well-buried by Voltore, using his prowess as a lawyer to convince the Avocatori, with false evidence given by Mosca, Volpone and the other dupes.

There are episodes involving the English travellers Sir and Lady Politic Would-Be and Peregrine. Sir Politic constantly talks of plots and his outlandish business plans, while Lady Would-Be annoys Volpone with her ceaseless talking. Mosca co-ordinates a mix-up between them which leaves Peregrine, a more sophisticated traveller, feeling offended. He humiliates Sir Politic by telling him he is to be arrested for sedition and making him hide inside a giant tortoise shell.

Volpone insists on disguising himself and having it announced that he has died and willed his wealth to Mosca, which enrages the would-be heirs Voltore, Corbaccio and Corvino, and everyone returns to court to dispute the will of Volpone, who becomes entangled in the circumstances of the plots that he and Mosca devised. Despite Volpone&#x27;s pleas, Mosca refuses to relinquish his new role as a rich man. Volpone reveals himself and his deceits in order to topple the rich Mosca. In the event, Voltore, Corbaccio, Corvino, Mosca and Volpone himself finally are punished.

==Text==
The play appeared in quarto in early 1607, printed by George Eld for publisher Thomas Thorpe. The quarto contains Jonson&#x27;s dedication to Oxford and Cambridge, as well as a great number of commendatory verses, in English and Latin, by fellow-poets such as Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher. Its next appearance was in the folio of 1616, and the latter, presumably having been subject to Jonson&#x27;s careful review, forms the basis of most modern editions.

==Productions==

The play premiered at the Globe Theatre in Spring 1606. It was performed by the King&#x27;s Men, but casting is uncertain. John Lowin may have performed the title role, as he is associated with the role in James Wright&#x27;s &quot;Historia Histrionica&quot; (1699). William Gifford hypothesized that Alexander Cooke may have played Lady Would-be. Either that summer or the next, an outbreak of plague closed the London theatres, and the company performed the play at Oxford and Cambridge. Jonson may have added the first act&#x27;s satire on Pythagoras for these audiences. The play certainly remained in the King&#x27;s Men&#x27;s repertoire throughout the period. It was performed for Charles in 1624 while he was still Prince of Wales, in 1630, and again at the Cockpit-in-Court in 1637.

After the Restoration, the play enjoyed a lengthy prominence: John Genest records over fifty performances before 1770. John Evelyn saw it performed at the court of Charles II on 16 October 1662. When the theatres reopened, the play was owned by the King&#x27;s Men of Thomas Killigrew; it was performed at Drury Lane in 1663. Michael Mohun played Volpone to Hart&#x27;s Mosca; Katherine Corey played Celia, and Rebecca Marshall played Lady Would-be. The same cast was seen by Samuel Pepys in 1665.

The play continued in performance throughout the 18th century. Richard Steele mentions a performance in a 1709 edition of &quot;Tatler&quot;. Famous eighteenth-century Volpones included James Quin; famous Moscas included Charles Macklin. Colley Cibber played Corvino in his productions; his wife Katherine Shore played Celia, as later did Elizabeth Inchbald. As with many other Jacobean plays, Volpone had lost its appeal before the end of the 18th century. Earlier in the century, critics had complained about the improbability of the fifth act, frequently likened to farce, and to Jonson&#x27;s highly Latinate language. An updated version by George Colman the Elder failed at Drury Lane in 1771. By the end of the century, the objections appeared insurmountable to producers, and the play fell into disuse.

The play was revived by the Phoenix Society at the Lyric Hammersmith in 1921; W. B. Yeats was in the audience and mentions the production approvingly in a letter to Allan Wade. The Birmingham Repertory Theatre staged the play at the Malvern Festival in 1935.

A 1938 production introduced two of the dominant elements of twentieth-century productions: the performance of Donald Wolfit and animal imagery. Wolfit&#x27;s dynamic performance in the title role, repeated several times over the next decades, set the standard for modern interpretations of Volpone: Politick&#x27;s plot was truncated or eliminated, and Mosca (played in 1938 by Alan Wheatley) relegated to a secondary role.

The play has since been staged by a number of famous companies. In 1952, George Devine directed Anthony Quayle (Mosca) and Ralph Richardson (Volpone) at the Stratford Memorial Theatre. At the same theatre in 1955, Eric Porter played Volpone. In 1968, Sir Tyrone Guthrie&#x27;s National Theatre production emphasized the beast-fable motif; this production featured stage design by Tanya Moiseiwitsch. In the same year, David Raeburn directed a modern dress performance featuring rock music settings of the songs at Beckenham Boys Grammar.

In 1972, the play was staged at the Bristol Old Vic. A most memorable production of the 1970s was Peter Hall&#x27;s staging for the Royal National Theatre in 1974, with Paul Scofield as Volpone, Ben Kingsley as Mosca, Sir John Gielgud as Sir Politick, and Ian Charleson as Peregrine. In 1971, the Stratford Festival mounted a Canadian production directed by David William, with William Hutt in the title role and Douglas Rain as Mosca.

Matthew Warchus received an Olivier Award nomination for his 1995 production at the Royal National Theatre; it featured Michael Gambon and Simon Russell Beale.

== Adaptations ==
&quot;Volpone&quot; was adapted by Jules Romains and Stefan Zweig in their 1928 production, with the ending changed so that Mosca ends up with Volpone&#x27;s money. This version was used by George Antheil in his 1953 opera &quot;Volpone&quot;.

In 1941 a French film version was released, under the direction of noted filmmaker Maurice Tourneur. Begun in 1938 by Jacques de Baroncelli, the production shut down because of financial difficulties. Tourneur took over and the shooting resumed in 1940. This version also used portions of the adaptation by Romains and Zweig.

An adaptation by Alphons Silbermann ran at the Independent Theatre, Sydney from 3 April to 21 June 1947.

A short-lived 1964 Broadway musical adaptation entitled &quot;Foxy&quot; moved the play&#x27;s setting to the Yukon during the gold rush of 1898.

It was adapted for Australian television in 1968.

The stage adaptation &quot;Sly Fox&quot;, by Larry Gelbart, updated the setting from Renaissance Venice to 19th century San Francisco, and changed the tone from satire to farce.

&quot;The Honey Pot&quot; is a 1967 film by Joseph L. Mankiewicz based on &quot;Volpone&quot;, although with a romantic subplot and sentimental trappings. It featured Rex Harrison in the main role, Cliff Robertson as Mosca (&quot;McFly&quot;), and Maggie Smith as the love interest. A portion of the original play is presented in private performance for Harrison&#x27;s character, who states that it is his favourite.

In France, there have been three further video and DVD adaptations of &quot;Volpone&quot; based on versions of the Stefan Zweig/Jules Romains script: in 1978, Jean Meyer directed a production in the &#x27;théâtre de boulevard&#x27; style for the Théâtre de Marigny and Panorama (Au Théâtre ce soir), starring himself as Corbaccio, Jean Le Poulain as Volpone, Francis Huster as Mosca and Claude Jade as Colomba (Celia). This was followed in 2001 by a production directed by Francis Perrin with a script that resembles the Zweig/Romains text but rewritten in pseudo-Elizabethan style by Jean Collette and Toni Cecchinato. Bernard Haller plays the part of Volpone, Francis Perrin plays Mosca, and Thibaut Lorain plays Lady Would-Be. In 2003, the play was rewritten for television by Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt for a production starring Gérard Depardieu as Volpone and Daniel Prévost as Mosca. The ending is changed to see Volpone and Mosca escaping together with Corbaccio&#x27;s wife.

In 1974 György Fehér adapted the play for the Hungarian Television with title &quot;Volpone&quot;. Volpone was played by Tamás Major.

In 1988 the film was adapted for Italian cinema by Maurizio Ponzi, with the title &quot;Il volpone&quot;. Set in modern Liguria, it features Paolo Villaggio as Ugo Maria Volpone and Enrico Montesano as Bartolomeo Mosca.

On 24 March 2004, Ian McDiarmid starred as Volpone in a BBC Radio 3 production directed by Peter Kavanagh that included Tom Hollander as Mosca, Malcolm Sinclair as Corvino, Patrick Barlow as Voltore and John Rowe as Corbacchio.

In 2004 the Wolf Trap Opera Company, Vienna, Virginia, commissioned and produced a new opera based on the play. The score was written by John Musto with libretto by Mark Campbell. The world premiere took place at The Barns at Wolf Trap on 10 March 2004. The opera was produced again in 2007 by the Wolf Trap Opera Company with a new cast featuring Joshua Jeremiah, Jeremy Little, Faith Sherman, and Lisa Hopkins. This production was recorded live at The Barns at Wolf Trap for Wolf Trap Recordings and was nominated in 2010 for a Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording.

<text>Hristo Ivanov Prodanov also known as Christo Prodanov (; 24 February 1943 – dissapeared 21 April 1984) was a Bulgarian mountaineer. Prodanov was the first Bulgarian to climb Mount Everest, doing it via the most difficult way—the West Ridge—as well as alone and without oxygen. Prodanov was the first person to climb Everest in April, when the weather conditions are generally too bad for an expedition, and also the thirteenth person (first person from the West Ridge) to climb Everest without using bottled oxygen. Climbing the summit at 18:15 local time, he had to descend overnight and got lost shortly after that. On the next afternoon, he reported he had lost his gloves and soon would be unable to hold the radio button long enough to talk. His body was never found.

Prodanov was still a student when he became involved in mountaineering. He began work as a metallurgical engineer in Kremikovtzi AD in 1976. He had his first 7000 m ascent on 6 August 1967 when he climbed Lenin Peak. He had previously climbed several peaks in the Alps.

His major successes were related to Hindu Kush (1976) and Lhotse. In 1981, he was the first Bulgarian to climb Lhotse without the use of supplementary oxygen.

== Personal Life ==
His niece, Mariana Prodanova Maslarova, attempted to climb Mt. Everest (without the use of supplemental oxygen) on the 20th anniversary of her uncle&#x27;s death. Maslarova died of exposure at 8,700 meters, exactly 20 years and 30 days after her uncle.

<text>Aggersund is a village in northern Denmark with a population of 264 (2024). The village is a part of Vesthimmerland Municipality in the North Jutland Region.

Evidence of settlement in Aggersund dates back to the stone age, and the village contains one of the oldest viking fortresses in Denmark, Aggersborg. Much of the village&#x27;s modern growth is associated with the commerce brought by the village&#x27;s bridge. The Aggersund bridge () was once one of few crossings on the Limfjord. Because of the bridge&#x27;s regional importance, it was a location of interest during the German occupation of Denmark and had a heavy occupying military presence during WWII.

==History==
There is evidence of a Stone Age settlement near Aggersund, from c. 5000 BCE. The remains of this settlement are located slightly north of the present day village, apparently because the strait of the fjord which it is located on was then significantly wider. During the Iron Age, a larger village emerged on the site. This village was torn down, likely to make room for the grounds of Aggersborg, a viking ring fortress, which was likely erected c. 980. Some archaeologist postulate that the displaced residents of this viking era village resettled in Øster Ørbæk on the southern bank on the fjord.

An 11th century estate adjoins the viking ring fortress. It was formed in 1086 as a royal estate, owned by the crown. The original buildings were destroyed by a fire in the 15th century, and were not rebuilt. The estate then briefly became known as &quot;Kongensgaard&quot;, which retained its rights over Aggersund as a fief. The estate was sold by the crown in 1579 to Vibeke Podebusk, who then constructed a new manor house on the property called &quot;Aggersborggaard&quot;. The estate&#x27;s main building was constructed during the 1750s from salvaged architectural elements from several older sites. Several restorations of the property have been carried out since the 20th century. The main building itself was restored in 1936 and rebuilt in 1978.

The village was traditionally a part of Hanherred, historically referred to as &quot;Hanæhæreth&quot;. The herred was an independent fief during the later middle ages, though alternately belonged to the Syssels of Thysyssel and Vendsyssel. In the 1660s, Hanherred was divided between several counties of Denmark: Aalborg County, Aastrup County, Sejlstrup County, and Thisted County. The village of Aggersund became part of Hjørring County in 1793 and constituted the administrative parish of Aggerborg Sogn. Although the majority of the village was settled along the northern shore of the Limfjord, by this time Aggersund was divided by the fjord, and a ferry crossed from North Aggersund to South Aggersund. The southern part of the village was part of a separate administrative district within Slet Herred of Aalborg County. 

Modern settlement of the area centered around the ferry port, which made the location an important commercial crossroad. In 1801 Aggerborg Sogn had a population of 373, which grew to 545 in 1859. At this point in time, the economy relied largely on farming and trade with Aalborg of grains, potatoes, and livestock. While the area had once supported a fishing industry, it was a declining profession in the region by this time and yields were only traded locally. By 1901, the sogn&#x27;s population peaked at 856. While the population of the sogn began to decline in the early 20th century, Aggersund itself continued to expand. In 1955, the village had a population of 475, and had many amenities and industrial works. Approximately 36% of the population was employed in industrial work, 24% in trade and transportation, and 8% in agriculture. The population of the village has since declined. This is due, in part, to the 1970 Danish Municipal Reforms, which amalgamated and moved many administrative jobs and associated businesses to Løgstør.

During the German occupation of Denmark, the village saw a heavy military presence, because of the strategic importance of its bridge. Beginning in 1940, several buildings were occupied for military purposes, including the hotel at Brogade 17, which was used as a headquarters. Unemployed workers from larger cities were recruited to carry out military construction in the city. Households within the city were required to provide accommodation to these workers. On land, both sides of the village were surrounded by armoured trenches, including barbed wire fences, a minefield, and roadblocks. 18 bunkers were built within the city to protect the bridge itself, 7 on the southern side, and 11 in the north. The village became like a military fortress, and movement within the city was difficult for residents. At its peak, more than 600 men were stationed in Aggersund. By 1944, many of these soldiers had been sent to the Eastern front. Occupying forces left the village after the war ended in 1945. The military infrastructure of the city was rapidly abandoned. Grenades, land mines and other equipment were left where they lay. A long process to demilitarize the village then began.

==Infrastructure==
A ferry had been established at Aggersund to cross the strait since the early Middle Ages. During this era, it was a major commercial crossing of the Limfjord, along with Aalborg. The ferry route remained in place for many years, though the boats grew reportedly dilapidated. In 1891 the town of Løgstør, located near the southern bank of the strait, petitioned with the state to improve the crossing and increase the flow of business. The state agreed to provide 285,000 DKK to establish a steam ferry and the construction of ferry slips in North Aggersund, South Aggersund, and Løgstør. In the agreement, the city of Løgstør was responsible for all other expenses. The new steam powered ferry, dubbed &quot;Aggersund&quot; was dedicated in 1902. Although the ferry greatly improved the crossing, it ran an annual deficit. As a result, the postal service took over operation of the ferry in 1918.

=== Aggersund bridge ===
Proposals for a fixed crossing of the fjord began circulating in the 1920s. There was debate over whether to build a bridge, tunnel, dam, or pontoon bridge. In 1938, it was ultimately decided to construct a fixed bridge across the strait, connecting North Aggersund to South Aggersund. The Aggersund bridge was designed by Christian Ostenfeld and construction began in 1939. Construction of the bridge cost about 3.5 million DKK and was initially funded by Aalborg, Hjørring and Thisted Counties. The project was delayed due to shortages in steel, severe weather, and price increases.

After Operation Weserübung, construction continued during the German occupation of Denmark. The location of the bridge made it strategically important to occupying forces for the transportation of soldiers and materials. On 18 June 1942, the bridge was inaugurated. German forces constructed an armoured trench and 18 bunkers, evidently guarding the location against attacks from the north. The steam ferry was also maintained during this period, in case the bridge were to be sabotaged, or otherwise destroyed. All of the military infrastructure from WWII was decommissioned after occupation ended in 1945, and the majority was removed shortly thereafter. Only one of the 18 bunkers constructed remains in the city to this day, although it has not been maintained.

Today, the Aggersund bridge is a small bascule bridge spanning the Limfjord between Vesthimmerland and Jammerbugt in Denmark. In 1977, two free standing steel truss pylons were completed across the strait just east of the Aggersund bridge (Aggersundbroen). They constitute part of the HVDC Cross-Skagerrak line and are 70 metres tall. In 2000, the bridge&#x27;s beams were strengthened, increasing the carrying capacity of the bridge.

<text>Timothy Sylvester Harris (born 6 December 1964) is a Saint Kittitian and Nevisian politician, who served as the third prime minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis from 2015 to 2022. He previously served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 10 August 2001 to 25 January 2008, as Minister of Finance from 2008 to 2010, and as Senior Minister and Minister for Agriculture from 2010 to 2013.

== Life and career==
Harris grew up in the village of Tabernacle, Saint Kitts. He attended the Cayon High School and Basseterre High School before going to six university campuses, two in the Caribbean and four in Canada. In 1988, Harris graduated from the University of the West Indies at Cave Hill with a B.Sc. degree with a First Class Honours in Accounting, the only graduate of the B.Sc. Accounting programme to obtain this distinction. He also received the Victor Crooke Prize for Best Accounting Student. He returned home and worked for two years at managerial level with S. L. Horsfords and Co Ltd.

In 1990–92 he pursued his M.Sc. degree in accounting at the University of the West Indies at St. Augustine in Trinidad and Tobago. He graduated top of the class with an M.Sc. degree with a Distinction.

In 2001 Harris successfully defended his Ph.D. dissertation at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada. The doctoral programme is a joint Ph.D. programme involving Concordia University, McGill and two francophone universities: H.E.C. (affiliated to Université de Montréal) and UQAM. Harris holds a Doctor of Philosophy degree in administration majoring in accounting.

Harris participated in elective politics in 1993 and was elected as a Member of Parliament on the St. Kitts-Nevis Labour Party ticket in parliamentary elections held in 1995, 2000, 2004, and 2010. He held various cabinet posts, including Minister of Agriculture, Lands and Housing, Minister of Education, Labour and Social Security, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Education and Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Trade, Industry and Commerce. He has published several works and received several awards, including the St. Kitts Youth Council Award for Excellence in Education, the FESTAB Community Award for outstanding contribution to FESTAB and a certificate for outstanding contribution to the Cayon High School.

In 2013 Prime Minister Denzil Douglas fired Harris from the cabinet. Harris established the People&#x27;s Labour Party (PLP) later in the year. In the buildup to the 2015 general elections, the PLP formed the Team Unity alliance with the People&#x27;s Action Movement and the Concerned Citizens&#x27; Movement. The alliance won the elections, and although the PLP won only one seat, Harris became the third Prime Minister of independent St. Kitts and Nevis on 16 February. He succeeded the incumbent, Denzil Douglas, who served a historic near 20-year tenure.

<doc id="976132" wikidata="Q920501" url="?curid=976132" title="Discipline (King Crimson album)">
<text>Discipline is the eighth studio album by English progressive rock band King Crimson, released on 2 October 1981 by E.G. Records in the United Kingdom and by Warner Bros. Records in the United States.

This album was King Crimson&#x27;s first following a seven-year hiatus. Only band co-founder and guitarist Robert Fripp and drummer Bill Bruford remained from the previous incarnation. They were joined by two American musicians: vocalist, guitarist and frontman Adrian Belew, previously a member of Frank Zappa and David Bowie&#x27;s backing bands and a touring member of Talking Heads, and bassist, Chapman Stick player, and backing vocalist Tony Levin, a session musician Fripp had met while both were working with Peter Gabriel. The album introduced a new sound for the band, influenced by new wave, post-punk, minimalism and Indonesian gamelan music, while retaining an experimental character, helping lay the groundwork for what would eventually become known as post-progressive rock.

== Background and composition ==
The musical style of &quot;Discipline&quot; has been described as art rock, progressive rock, new wave, post-progressive, and dance-rock.

The title of the ballad &quot;Matte Kudasai&quot; means “please wait” in Japanese (待って下さい). The original release of &quot;Discipline&quot; featured a guitar part on this track by Robert Fripp that was removed from the 1989 &quot;Definitive Edition&quot; remaster and most subsequent editions. The 30th and 35th anniversary editions of the album include both versions of the song.

The lyrics of &quot;Indiscipline&quot; were adapted from a letter written to Adrian Belew by his then-wife Margaret concerning a painting that she had made, with all direct references to its subject removed.

The title of &quot;Thela Hun Ginjeet&quot; is an anagram of &quot;heat in the jungle&quot;, itself a euphemism for city-based crime. When it was first performed live, some of its lyrics were improvised around an illicit recording made by Robert Fripp of his neighbours having a vicious argument when he was living in New York; this recording is featured on the track &quot;NY3&quot; on Fripp&#x27;s solo album &quot;Exposure&quot;. While the track was being recorded for the &quot;Discipline&quot; album, Adrian Belew, walking around Notting Hill Gate with a tape recorder looking for lyrical inspiration, was harassed first by a gang that took and played the tape and then by police who searched the tape recorder for drugs. On returning to the studio, he gave his bandmates a distraught account of what had just happened to him. Fripp covertly signaled to the recording engineer to record Belew, and this recording is featured on the &quot;Discipline&quot; version of the track.

&quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;, which heavily features Belew and Fripp on the Roland GR-300 guitar synthesizer, is named after and partially inspired by the 1949 novel of the same name by Paul Bowles. Bowles is often associated with the Beat generation, the writings of which would inspire King Crimson&#x27;s subsequent studio album &quot;Beat&quot;.

Some live versions of &quot;Elephant Talk&quot;, &quot;Indiscipline&quot;, and &quot;Thela Hun Ginjeet&quot; included partial vocal improvisation during the spoken-word sections.

The back cover features the statement, &quot;Discipline is never an end in itself, only a means to an end&quot;. The original front cover features a variation on a copyrighted Celtic knot design by George Bain. As it was found to be used without proper licensing, it was replaced on later releases by a knotwork designed by Steve Ball on commission from Robert Fripp. Ball&#x27;s design is also used as the logo of Fripp&#x27;s record label, Discipline Global Mobile.

==Reception==
&quot;Discipline&quot; reached number 41 on the UK Albums Chart and received mixed to positive reviews. John Piccarella&#x27;s review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised King Crimson&#x27;s talent and artistry, particularly Belew and Fripp&#x27;s &quot;visionary approach to guitar playing&quot;, but criticised the &quot;arty content&quot; of the album itself, hoping that &quot;this band of virtuosos [would stay] together long enough to transform all of their experiments into innovations.&quot; &quot;Record Mirror&quot;″s Alan Entwistle was generally enthusiastic, writing that the band &quot;tests new ground and revitalises older ground&quot;; he highlighted the &quot;more mature&quot; second side of the album, noting its &quot;distinct songs that are danceable as well as disciplined&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; described the album as &quot;not bad—the Heads meet the League of Gentlemen&quot;. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s year-end Pazz &amp; Jop poll, &quot;Discipline&quot; was voted by critics as the 35th best album of the year.

Greg Prato&#x27;s retrospective review in AllMusic commended the album&#x27;s &quot;inspired performances&quot;, particularly applauding the unexpectedly successful combination of Belew and Fripp&#x27;s disparate playing styles. According to Prato, &quot;the pairing of these two originals worked out magically.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; characterised the album&#x27;s songs as &quot;unfolding musical sculptures, played with precision and rare imagination&quot; and &quot;a mostly successful synthesis of ambition, simplicity and Kraftwerkian clarity.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 2002, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;Discipline&quot; at number 56 on its list of &quot;The Top 100 Albums of the 1980s&quot;; in the album&#x27;s entry on the list, staff writer Dominique Leone cited it as an influence on math rock and called it &quot;as angular and tense as any post-punk group while as precise and rhythmically propulsive as a Bartók string quartet.&quot;

<doc id="976138" wikidata="Q1330791" url="?curid=976138" title="The Power to Believe">
<text>The Power to Believe is the thirteenth and final studio album by English progressive rock band King Crimson. It was released on 24 February 2003 in the United Kingdom and on 4 March 2003 in the United States through Sanctuary Records and met with generally favourable reviews, with several critics appreciating its heightened aggression. &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; was preceded by the EP &quot;Happy with What You Have to Be Happy With&quot; (2002), which features alternate and otherwise unreleased tracks.

==Background==

After a tour opening for Tool in 2001, King Crimson refined and focused their four-piece structure for their second album in that configuration. The release of &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; was preceded by &quot;Level Five&quot; (2001) and &quot;Happy With What You Have to Be Happy With&quot; (2002), two EPs that functioned as work-in-progress reveals for the album, which Fripp described as &quot;the culmination of three years of Crimsonising&quot;. While &quot;Level Five&quot; was a live release featuring two songs that would appear on the full album, &quot;Happy With What You Have to Be Happy With&quot; was a limited-edition studio release that, much like 1994&#x27;s &quot;VROOOM&quot;, featured early studio versions of the upcoming album&#x27;s tracks.

==Content and composition==
Originally titled &quot;Nuovo Metal&quot;, &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; continued the aggressive and occasionally industrial metal-leaning experimentation of King Crimson&#x27;s previous album, 2000&#x27;s &quot;The Construkction of Light&quot;, with several critics appreciating its increased heaviness. Like that previous album, &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; was recorded with King Crimson as a four-piece.

The album derives its title from &quot;The Power to Believe&quot;, a four-part suite of songs that runs throughout the album. The phrase originally appeared in the song &quot;All Her Love Is Mine&quot; from Adrian Belew&#x27;s 1996 solo album &quot;Op Zop Too Wah&quot;. The album&#x27;s second track, &quot;Level Five&quot;, acts as the fifth and final entry in the group&#x27;s long-running &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot; suite. Lindsay Planer of AllMusic wrote that the track &quot;could easily be mistaken for the likes of Tool, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, or KMFDM.&quot;

&quot;Facts of Life: Intro&quot; features a sample of &quot;The Outer Darkness II: Perimeter I&quot;, from Fripp&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;The Gates of Paradise&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Power to Believe&quot; was met with mostly positive reviews. The album received an average score of 72/100 from 8 reviews on Metacritic, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Lindsay Planer praised the album&#x27;s aggression and &quot;sonic belligerence&quot;, writing, &quot;If the bandmembers&#x27; constant tone probing is an active search to find the unwitting consciousness of a decidedly younger, rowdier, and more demanding audience, their collective mission is most assuredly accomplished on &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; -- even more so than the tripped-out psychedelic prog rock behemoth from whence they initially emerged.&quot; David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; appreciated the album&#x27;s contrast of heavy, frightening periods against peaceful moments, concluding with, &quot;In the face of war, King Crimson make hopeful thunder.&quot; In their 2003 review, &quot;Mojo&quot; wrote, &quot;This is a more consistent set, and, hopefully, a revelation for a few young metal heads.&quot; Chris Jones of the BBC called the album &quot;simply stunning&quot;.

Writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Dominique Leone said, &quot;I can admit to feeling some of that old Crim magic a few times during [the album], but would be kidding myself if I thought it was as potent a spell as their adventures of yore.&quot; &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Ed Howard called &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; King Crimson&#x27;s best release since 1981&#x27;s &quot;Discipline&quot; but thought it did not live up to their earlier work.

==Re-issue==
In 2019, King Crimson announced that &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; would be the fifteenth and final phase of their &quot;40th Anniversary&quot; release schedule. An enhanced and expanded master of the album was released in hi-res stereo audio as well as lossless 5.1 Surround Sound.

<doc id="976139" wikidata="Q7397369" url="?curid=976139" title="Sacrificial lamb">
<text>A sacrificial lamb is a metaphorical reference to a person or animal sacrificed for the common good. The term is derived from the traditions of the Abrahamic religions where a lamb is a highly valued possession.

==In politics==

In politics, a sacrificial lamb candidate is a candidate chosen to contest an election with little chance of victory. The political party thus appoints the person as a sort of &quot;sacrifice&quot; to the stronger opponent.

In some cases, fielding a sacrificial lamb candidate can serve as an opportunity for the party to be more creative in choosing a candidate than would normally be considered acceptable in a closely contested race. Alan Keyes and Geraldine A. Ferraro are examples in American politics. In 1956, Adlai Stevenson was considered a sacrificial lamb candidate for president against Dwight Eisenhower. In 2004, Howard Mills was considered a sacrificial lamb candidate for the U.S. Senate from New York against Chuck Schumer.

==In the arts==
In cinema and literature, a &quot;sacrificial lamb&quot; is a supporting character who&#x27;s murdered by a villain, which prompts the protagonist to avenge them. The sacrificial lamb is often the protagonist&#x27;s family member, partner, or friend. They can also be a defenceless stranger, such as an orphan. The virtuous hero mourns the sacrificial lamb&#x27;s death, foiling the wicked villain who celebrates their enemy&#x27;s defeat. The lamb&#x27;s murder justifies the rivalry between the hero and the villain. Because no complex setup is needed to establish the trope, it is often criticised as a shallow way to create narrative conflict. A similar trope is the Women in Refrigerators, where the male hero&#x27;s girlfriend, sister, or mother gets murdered.

An example of this trope&#x27;s use in early literature is Macaria in &quot;Heracleidae&quot; by Euripides. The revenge tragedy theatrical genre is defined by this trope, coupled with the hero&#x27;s own tragic death.

In modern media, examples include Anthony Edwards&#x27; character Goose in &quot;Top Gun&quot;, as well as Phil Coulson in &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

<doc id="976140" wikidata="Q5135327" url="?curid=976140" title="Change step">
<text>The closed change is a Pre-Bronze, or newcomer waltz figure, performed in closed position.
Changes may start of the right foot or left foot, moving forward or backward. This makes four different types of closed changes. Combining two changes results in a box step.
In right changes the man starts from the right foot, while in left ones the man starts from the left foot.

The figures are called &quot;changes&quot; because they allow dancers to change from natural turn to reverse turn (i.e., left to right turn) and vice versa. For example, a basic practising variation in waltz goes as follows:
# Dance 1–6 steps of natural turn,
#then 1–3 steps of closed change from natural to reverse,
#then 1–6 steps of reverse turn,
#then 1–3 steps of closed change from reverse to natural,
# repeat until the music stops or partner drops.

Other change steps include the hesitation change and the outside change, described below.

==Closed change from natural to reverse turn==
The man steps forward on right foot while the lady steps backward on the opposing (i.e., left) foot. They will then step to the side (and possibly slightly forward, in relation to the man) on the other foot, and conclude the figure by closing the first foot beside the second. Each step takes up a full beat of the music.

A turn of up to is optional. There will be slight contra body movement (CBM) on 1, and sway on 2,3.

;Leader (man)

;Follower (lady)

==Other closed changes==
The closed change from reverse to natural turn is the mirror image of the move just described. Backward changes start with the leader stepping back and the follower stepping forward.

==Hesitation change==
The hesitation change is a Bronze syllabus figure. The first 3 steps are identical to the natural turn. The last 3 steps comprise the &quot;hesitation&quot;. The leader&#x27;s heel pull allows time to change directions or pause for floor craft.

;Leader (man)

==Outside change==
The outside change is a Bronze syllabus figure. It has regular waltz rise and fall over the three beat phrase.

;Leader (man)

;Follower (lady)

<doc id="976141" wikidata="Q3183235" url="?curid=976141" title="Jon Snow (character)">
<text>Jon Snow is a fictional character in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series of epic fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its HBO television adaptation &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, in which he is portrayed by Kit Harington. In the novels, he is a prominent point of view character. He is one of the most popular characters in the series, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; cites him as one of the author&#x27;s finest creations. Jon is a main character in the TV series, and his storyline in the season 5 finale generated a strong reaction among viewers. Speculation about the character&#x27;s parentage has also been a popular topic of discussion among fans of both the books and the TV series.

Jon is introduced in 1996&#x27;s &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; as the illegitimate son of Ned Stark, Lord of Winterfell in the North of Westeros. Knowing his prospects are limited by his status as a bastard, Jon joins the Night&#x27;s Watch, who guard the far northern borders from the wildlings living beyond The Wall. In &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; (1998), Jon joins a scouting party investigating the growing threat from the otherworldly &quot;Others&quot; beyond the Wall, and infiltrates the wildlings. Jon learns of their plans to invade Westeros in &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; (2000), and falls in love with the wildling woman Ygritte. Jon betrays the wildlings and Ygritte, returns to defend the Night&#x27;s Watch against the wildlings&#x27; invasion, and is elected Lord Commander of the Watch. He appears briefly in &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; (2005) and returns as a prominent character in &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; (2011), in which he works to negotiate an alliance between the Night&#x27;s Watch and the wildlings against the Others; his policies are met with hostility by some among the Watch, and he is left for dead in a mutiny at the novel&#x27;s end following a desired attempt to break his vows to fight House Bolton.

In the &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; television series, Jon&#x27;s storyline initially follows the character&#x27;s plot arc from the novel series. Seasons six through eight continue on from the events of Martin&#x27;s latest published installment, detailing Jon&#x27;s resurrection, and revealing him to have been born Aegon Targaryen, the legitimate son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, therefore possessing a stronger claim to the Iron Throne than Daenerys Targaryen. For the role, Harington was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama in 2019, two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 2016 and 2019, and two Critics&#x27; Choice Television Awards.
==Character==
===Description===
In &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, Jon Snow is introduced as the 14-year-old illegitimate son of Eddard &quot;Ned&quot; Stark, Lord of Winterfell, and half-brother to Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. Jon is described as having strong Stark features with a lean build, long face, dark brown hair, and dark grey eyes. Jon has the surname &quot;Snow&quot; (customarily used for illegitimate noble children in the North) and is resented by Ned&#x27;s wife Catelyn, who views him as a constant reminder of Ned&#x27;s infidelity. Jon is the same age as Robb and enjoys a warm relationship with his siblings, particularly the tomboy Arya (who resembles Jon and like him, does not feel like she fits in). Ned treats Jon as much like his other children as propriety and his honor will allow. Still, as somewhat of an outsider, Jon has learned to be independent and to fend for himself when necessary. Jon idolizes his father, but is wounded by Ned&#x27;s refusal to tell him about his mother. At the beginning of the story, Jon adopts the albino direwolf that he names Ghost. He later finds that at times, he can &quot;inhabit&quot; the wolf and share its experiences.

David Orr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; describes Jon as &quot;a complex, thoughtful and basically good character&quot;. David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, the creators and executive producers of the television adaptation of the series, explain that Jon is one of several characters in the series who must &quot;face hard truths about the world they live in, and adapt themselves to those truths&quot; because, &quot;The struggle many of them face is how to do that without losing their grip on who they are.&quot; Ned Stark teaches all his children about leadership, selflessness, duty and honor. Following his father&#x27;s example becomes more difficult as Jon faces challenges to his identity as a man, a Stark, and a brother of the Night&#x27;s Watch. Benioff and Weiss note that &quot;Jon Snow tries to live with honor, while knowing that honor often gets his family members murdered.&quot; Writing for &quot;Variety&quot; about the season 6 episode &quot;Battle of the Bastards&quot;, Laura Prudom suggests that Jon &quot;has the same shortcomings&quot; as his father: &quot;he fights with honor against opponents who are all too willing to use that predictable morality against him&quot;.

Jon is a prominent point of view character in the novels, and has been called one of Martin&#x27;s &quot;finest creations&quot;. Jon is introduced as the illegitimate son of a Northern Lord who, realizing he is an outsider in his own family, follows his uncle to the far north and accepts the honorable duty of serving in the Night&#x27;s Watch. But as much as he is a second-class Stark at home, initially his fellow recruits and brothers of the Watch set him apart as privileged and aloof. Jon adapts, soon proving himself to be wise, compassionate, and a natural leader. Over the course of the series, Jon&#x27;s loyalty to the Watch and its vows, his family, and even Westeros itself are tested as he becomes embroiled in the efforts of the wildlings from Beyond the Wall to force their way back into the Seven Kingdoms. He lives among them as a spy for the Watch, sympathetic to their cause and becoming romantically involved with the tenacious Ygritte. However he ultimately betrays them to defend The Wall. Later, as the newest Lord Commander of the Night&#x27;s Watch, he pursues an alliance with the wildlings.

Several reviews of 2011&#x27;s &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; noted the return to the narrative of Jon, Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister, the three popular characters whom fans had missed most from the previous volume, &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;. These &quot;favorites&quot; had last been featured 11 years before in Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;. In &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;, Jon&#x27;s leadership of the Night&#x27;s Watch is complicated by several unprecedented challenges, including a wildling alliance, the demands of would-be-king Stannis Baratheon and the conflicting factions developing within the Watch itself. &quot;The New York Times&quot; notes that &quot;Jon’s leadership is the best hope of Westeros, so naturally he’s in imminent danger throughout &quot;A Dance With Dragons&quot;.&quot; James Hibberd of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called Jon&#x27;s final chapter in &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; &quot;a harsh chapter in terms of fan expectations. You go from this total high of Jon giving this rousing speech about going after the evil Ramsay Bolton, to this utter low of his men turning against him.&quot; Jon&#x27;s presence in the forthcoming volume &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot; is uncertain.

When asked what he thought was &quot;Jon&#x27;s biggest &#x27;mistake&#x27;&quot;, Martin replied:
===Parentage===

The identity of Jon&#x27;s mother has created much speculation among readers of the series, and guessing her identity was the test Martin gave Benioff and Weiss when they approached him in March 2006 about adapting his novels into a TV series. In the novels, characters believe that she could be a servant named Wylla, or the noblewoman Ashara Dayne. The popular fan theory—called R+L=J, an abbreviation of &quot;Rhaegar + Lyanna = Jon&quot;—proposes that Jon is not the son of Ned at all, but is actually the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Ned&#x27;s younger sister Lyanna Stark, and Ned feigned dishonor and claimed the nephew to be his own child in order to protect Jon from harm.

Though the character is presented as the illegitimate son of Ned Stark, David Orr voiced the doubt of some readers when he wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2011, &quot;Jon Snow is presented as the illegitimate son of the Stark patriarch, although it&#x27;s uncertain whether Stark is indeed his father.&quot; Actor Sean Bean, who portrays Ned in the HBO television series, said when asked in a 2014 interview about returning to the series to appear in flashbacks, &quot;I&#x27;ve definitely got some unfinished business that needs to be resolved there. I&#x27;m obviously not Jon Snow&#x27;s dad. And you need that to be revealed at some point, don&#x27;t you?&quot; The uncertainty arises from anecdotal evidence in the texts interpreted by readers to connect the mysterious maternity of Ned&#x27;s son with the vague backstory of his sister Lyanna.

As recounted by Ned in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, at a tourney years before the events of the novel, Rhaegar had shown public favor to Lyanna in the presence of his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell. When Rhaegar and Lyanna disappeared a year later, her father Rickard and eldest brother Brandon confronted Rhaegar&#x27;s father, the &quot;Mad King&quot; Aerys Targaryen, demanding that his son return the abducted Lyanna. Aerys had Rickard and Brandon brutally executed for their insolence, inciting Ned and his friend Robert Baratheon, Lord of Storm&#x27;s End and Lyanna&#x27;s betrothed, to rebel against Aerys. In what later became known as Robert&#x27;s Rebellion, Aerys was overthrown and Rhaegar was killed by Robert in single combat. After a bloody battle against three of Aerys&#x27; Kingsguard protecting the Tower of Joy in Dorne, Ned found Lyanna inside, in a &quot;bed of blood.&quot; She died shortly after eliciting a promise from Ned. Once the war was won, he returned to Winterfell with his supposed illegitimate son Jon.

The R+L=J theory posits that rather than Rhaegar kidnapping Lyanna, they fell in love and ran away together. Living for a year in the Tower of Joy, they conceived a child—Jon. Rhaegar was killed in battle by Robert, and Lyanna died in childbirth. Ned promised Lyanna on her deathbed to claim the baby as his own to protect him from Robert, who sought to exterminate all Targaryens out of hatred and to secure his claim to the throne.

HBO&#x27;s &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; has included in its adaptation many of the &quot;hints&quot; identified by this theory. In the season 6 finale, &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot;, Bran Stark has a vision of the past which shows Ned reuniting with a dying Lyanna in the Tower of Joy. Lyanna makes him promise to protect her son—Jon. An infographic subsequently posted on the HBO-controlled website MakingGameofThrones.com confirmed Rhaegar as Jon&#x27;s father. Journalists later commented on the significance of two plot points in the season 7 episode &quot;Eastwatch&quot;. One of Daenerys Targaryen&#x27;s dragons, Drogon, approaches Jon calmly and allows the King in the North to pet him, seemingly recognizing him as a Targaryen. Later, Gilly learns from a book at the Citadel that a High Septon annulled Rhaegar&#x27;s marriage, and married him to someone else in Dorne, suggesting the possibility that Jon is the legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna. The season 7 finale episode &quot;The Dragon and the Wolf&quot; confirmed that Jon is indeed the legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, and that his birth name is actually Aegon Targaryen.

==Storylines==
===&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;===
Jon Snow is first introduced in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; (1996), as he and his five siblings adopt six orphaned direwolf cubs. Jon takes the runt of the litter, a white cub that he names Ghost. Known by all as Ned Stark&#x27;s illegitimate son and with Ned&#x27;s wife Catelyn despising him, Jon has always felt removed from the rest of the Stark family. He resolves to join the Night&#x27;s Watch, as his status as a bastard prevents him from holding lands or marrying into a good family, whereas a life in the Night&#x27;s Watch would offer opportunities for advancement. At The Wall, the other recruits resent Jon&#x27;s aura of superiority, but he makes amends by helping them master swordplay. He also befriends Samwell Tarly, a cowardly lordling who, despite being helpless with weapons, is keenly intelligent. Jon&#x27;s independence and his compassion for the recruits invite the ire of the harsh master-at-arms Alliser Thorne, who sees Jon as a threat to his authority. Jon gains the notice of Lord Commander Jeor Mormont, who names Jon his personal squire and grooms Jon for command. After a dead Night&#x27;s Watch brother brought back from beyond the Wall reanimates as an undead wight, Jon saves Mormont&#x27;s life by killing the creature. In thanks, Mormont gives Jon House Mormont&#x27;s ancestral sword Longclaw, made of Valyrian steel, with a wolf&#x27;s head pommel custom-made for Jon. However, Jon is torn between his vows to the Night&#x27;s Watch and his loyalty to his family after learning of Ned&#x27;s execution and his half brother Robb&#x27;s march south for justice. Jon resolves to desert the Night&#x27;s Watch and join Robb, but his friends convince Jon to remain loyal to his vows. Mormont is aware of Jon&#x27;s attempt at desertion, but convinces Jon that the new threat beyond the Wall is more concerning than events in the south. Mormont then orders a great ranging, with Jon accompanying him.

===&quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;===
In 1998&#x27;s &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;, Mormont leads a party of Night&#x27;s Watch rangers beyond the Wall to investigate the disappearance of Jon&#x27;s uncle Benjen, assess the intentions of the wildling leader Mance Rayder, and learn more of the threat posed by the Others. Jon is sent out with a scouting party led by Qhorin Halfhand. On the journey, Jon comes upon a wildling lookout and takes the spearwife Ygritte captive; though told to kill her, Jon lets her escape. Jon and Qhorin are subsequently captured by the wildlings. Facing execution by Mance&#x27;s hand, Qhorin commands Jon to infiltrate the wildlings and learn their plans at any cost. Jon pretends to disavow the Night&#x27;s Watch, and the wildlings force him to fight Qhorin to the death to earn their trust. With Qhorin&#x27;s silent consent, Jon kills him with the aid of Ghost.

===&quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;===
As &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; (2000) begins, Jon has infiltrated the wildlings and marches with their host. He learns that Mance Rayder intends to breach the Wall and march south to escape the Others, crushing the Night&#x27;s Watch if necessary. Jon breaks his vows of celibacy with Ygritte and becomes torn between his growing feelings for her and his loyalty to the Night&#x27;s Watch. After climbing over the Wall with Ygritte, Jon deserts them to warn the Watch of the impending attack. He helps defend Castle Black against the wildlings&#x27; attack despite his injuries. Ygritte is killed in battle, leaving Jon stricken with grief. Jon takes over Donal Noye&#x27;s command of the Wall&#x27;s defense after Noye is killed. When Thorne and Janos Slynt arrive at Castle Black, they attempt to have Jon executed for desertion. Jon is freed after the judges are convinced of his loyalty but Thorne orders Jon to kill Mance under the pretense of parley. As Jon negotiates with Mance, Stannis Baratheon arrives with his army and defeats the wildings. Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and declare him Lord of Winterfell if he will align the North with Stannis. Though greatly tempted by the prospect of becoming a true Stark, Jon ultimately chooses to remain loyal to his Night&#x27;s Watch vows. Due to Sam&#x27;s machinations, Jon is elected as the new Lord Commander in a landslide victory.

===&quot;A Feast for Crows&quot; and &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;===
Jon is not a POV character in 2005&#x27;s &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;, but appears briefly from Sam&#x27;s perspective as he sends Sam away from Castle Black with the Watch&#x27;s Maester Aemon and Mance&#x27;s newborn son to protect them from being sacrificed by the Red Priestess Melisandre. Jon also gives Sam the specific mission of traveling to the Citadel in Oldtown to become a maester, so that he may better understand the threat of the Others and eventually succeed Maester Aemon.

In &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; (2011), Jon prepares the defense of the realm against the Others. He attempts to juggle the integration of the wildlings, growing unrest within the Night&#x27;s Watch, and Stannis&#x27; attempts to use the Watch in his war for the Iron Throne, while trying to maintain the Watch&#x27;s strict political neutrality. When Slynt openly defies Jon&#x27;s orders multiple times, Jon executes him, which increases tension between factions. Later, he advises Stannis against attacking the Dreadfort. Jon plans to settle the wildlings in sparsely populated regions of the North and allows some of them to join the Watch to garrison the many abandoned Night&#x27;s Watch fortresses. Many members of the Watch dislike the idea of allowing their ancient enemies through the Wall and welcoming them into their ranks. Jon learns that his sister Arya is being married to Ramsay Bolton to secure the Bolton hold on Winterfell but in truth, the bride is Jeyne Poole posing as Arya. Jon allows Melisandre to send Mance to rescue her. He later receives a letter from Ramsay claiming that Stannis, who marched on Winterfell, has been defeated and Mance is a prisoner. Ramsay demands hostages, threatening to march on the Wall and kill Jon if he is defied. Finally pushed to his breaking point, Jon instead decides that he will seek out and kill Ramsay himself, openly compromising his neutrality, but he is stabbed by his Night&#x27;s Watch brothers in a mutiny.

Jon&#x27;s presence in the forthcoming volume &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot; is uncertain; when asked in 2011 by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;Why did you kill Jon Snow?&quot;, author Martin responded &quot;Oh, you think he’s dead, do you?&quot; Asked later whether Jon was killed or will survive, Martin responded with a laugh, &quot;I will not comment on that.&quot;

==TV adaptation==
===Overview===
Martin told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2014 that some early inquiries he received about adapting &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; suggested identifying the story&#x27;s &quot;important character&quot; and focusing on that individual plot line, Jon and Daenerys Targaryen being the two most popular choices. Martin was not interested in sacrificing so much of the overall story. When the pilot for the HBO adaptation went into production years later, one of the first parts cast was Jon, with Kit Harington announced in the role in July 2009. Alfie Allen and Iwan Rheon had also auditioned for the role, and were brought into the show to play Theon Greyjoy and Ramsay Snow instead, respectively. In October 2014, Harington and several other key cast members, all contracted for six seasons of the series, renegotiated their deals to include a potential seventh season and salary increases for seasons five, six, and seven. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called the raises &quot;huge&quot;, noting that the deal would make the performers &quot;among the highest-paid actors on cable TV&quot;. &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; put the number for season five at &quot;close to $300,000 an episode&quot; for each actor, and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote in June 2016 that the performers would each be paid &quot;upward of $500,000 per episode&quot; for seasons seven and the potential eight. In 2017, Harington became one of the highest paid actors on television and may have earned £1.2 million per episode for the show.

As the series premiered, &quot;TV Guide&quot; called Harington a &quot;soulful heartthrob&quot; whose Jon is idolized by his younger siblings and who &quot;seeks purpose&quot; by joining the Night&#x27;s Watch. Creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss later noted that Jon &quot;tries to live with honor, while knowing that honor often gets his family members murdered&quot;. They explained that he is one of several characters in the series who must &quot;face hard truths about the world they live in, and adapt themselves to those truths. The struggle many of them face is how to do that without losing their grip on who they are.&quot; Matt Fowler of IGN wrote in 2013 that while Jon and Daenerys&#x27; storylines in season 1 and season 2 &quot;felt very separate&quot; from the rest of the series&#x27; plot, for the first time in season 3, &quot;Jon&#x27;s entire situation felt incorporated into the larger picture.&quot; Fowler also added that Jon&#x27;s &quot;oath-breaking romance with Ygritte added a lot of heat to the story&quot;. In May 2015, &quot;International Business Times&quot; called Jon &quot;clearly the most popular character&quot; of the series.

In a 2015 interview Benioff said, &quot;The problem with Jon is, he’s not a cautious man. It&#x27;s the problem with him, and also the reason we love him. He is a hero, but heroes are inherently incautious.&quot; Weiss added, &quot;At the end of the day, Jon is his father’s son, he’s a person who’s honorable to a fault and does the right thing even when the right thing is extremely dangerous to him personally.&quot; In the June 2015 season 5 finale &quot;Mother&#x27;s Mercy&quot;, Jon is stabbed to death by Alliser Thorne and several men of the Night&#x27;s Watch after being labeled a traitor. With Martin&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; vague on Jon&#x27;s fate, Harington confirmed the character&#x27;s death in an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve been told I’m dead. I&#x27;m dead. I’m not coming back next season.&quot; He added, &quot;I loved how they brought [the orphan boy] Olly in to be the person who kills me. I love how the storyline with Thorne was wrapped up.&quot; Benioff also said of the episode:

Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jeremy Egner called Jon&#x27;s demise &quot;the biggest death on the show&quot; since Ned Stark&#x27;s beheading in season 1. Amid strong fan reaction over Jon&#x27;s death on social media, immediately following the episode journalists began theorizing how the show could resurrect the character. Nate Jones of &quot;Vulture&quot; noted:
A July 2015 sighting of Harington arriving in Belfast, a primary filming location for the series where other actors were arriving for season 6 script read-throughs, prompted further speculation about the character&#x27;s return. However, a story in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; pointed out that Charles Dance had been seen in Belfast the previous year after his character Tywin Lannister&#x27;s death as well, and he only appeared in the first episode of the subsequent season as a corpse. A season 6 &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; promotional poster released in November 2015 featured a bloodied Jon.

Jon is resurrected by Melisandre in &quot;Home&quot;, the May 2016 second episode of season 6. Though calling it a &quot;predictable move&quot; for a television series, David Sims of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; praised the plot development as &quot;the right choice&quot; for the show&#x27;s narrative. In a subsequent interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Harington said:
Joanna Robinson of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; credited Jon&#x27;s much-discussed cliffhanger death as a primary factor behind &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;″ subsequent 25% ratings increase for season 6. Harington&#x27;s performance in season 6 earned the actor his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination in July 2016. Harington as Jon had the most screen time of any other character in the first seven seasons of the show.

===Storylines===
====Season 1====
Jon Snow, the bastard son of Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, decides to join the Night&#x27;s Watch. He arrives at Castle Black with his direwolf Ghost to find that the once proud order is a shadow of its former self. Raised to be a skilled fighter with a strong sense of justice and honor, Jon is initially contemptuous of his fellow recruits, most of whom are lowborn criminals and exiles. He is persuaded by Tyrion Lannister to put aside his prejudices and help train the others. Jon befriends Samwell Tarly, an overweight, fearful recruit who is more an intellectual than a fighter. Jon takes his vows but is disappointed about being made steward to Lord Commander Jeor Mormont rather than a ranger. Sam points out that Jon is likely being groomed for future command. Jon saves Mormont from a wight and is given the House Mormont ancestral sword Longclaw, made of Valyrian steel, with a wolf&#x27;s head pommel custom-made for Jon. Jon learns of his father&#x27;s execution for apparent treason and, although tempted to leave the Wall to join Robb Stark&#x27;s army, is convinced to stay.

====Season 2====
Jon accompanies the Night&#x27;s Watch on the Great Ranging beyond the Wall. When the Night&#x27;s Watch seek shelter from the wildling Craster, an old man who marries his own daughters, Jon is horrified to discover that Craster sacrifices his sons to the White Walkers. Later, as part of a small scouting party led by legendary Night&#x27;s Watch ranger Qhorin Halfhand, Jon is tasked with killing a wildling prisoner, a woman warrior Ygritte. He finds himself unable to do so and she escapes, only to capture him with her comrades. Qhorin, also taken prisoner, orders Jon to pretend to defect and join the wildlings in order to discover their plans. Qhorin stages a fight and secretly instructs Jon to kill him to gain the wildlings&#x27; trust. Jon does and is taken to meet former Night&#x27;s Watch ranger Mance Rayder, the wildlings&#x27; King-Beyond-the Wall.

====Season 3====
Jon pledges his loyalty to Mance and travels with the wildlings, learning that they intend to scale the Wall and force their way south to escape the inevitable arrival of the White Walker army. Jon attempts to convince Mance not to attack the wall, falsely claiming Castle Black is home to over 1,000 Watchmen. Ygritte seduces Jon and takes his virginity, and they eventually fall in love. After scaling the Wall, Jon refuses to kill an innocent man to prove his loyalty. He is attacked by the other wildlings but escapes to Castle Black, despite being wounded by a devastated Ygritte.

====Season 4====
Jon survives his wounds and is tried for his defection to the wildlings, but Maester Aemon is convinced of Jon&#x27;s loyalty to the Watch and frees him. Jon leads an expedition to Craster&#x27;s Keep, where some Night&#x27;s Watchmen have mutinied and murdered Lord Commander Mormont. After defeating the mutineers, Jon is reunited with Ghost. Later, Tormund Giantsbane&#x27;s wildlings attack Castle Black while Mance&#x27;s army besieges the Wall. Acting-commander, Ser Alliser Thorne, is wounded forcing Jon to take command of the battle. Jon fights and kills Styr, leader of the Thenns. The wildlings are successfully repelled, although Ygritte is shot with an arrow and dies in Jon&#x27;s arms. Jon goes beyond the Wall to negotiate with Mance, but Stannis Baratheon&#x27;s army arrives and routs the wildling camp, taking Mance prisoner. At Tormund&#x27;s behest, Jon cremates Ygritte beyond the Wall.

====Season 5====
Stannis enlists Jon as an intermediary between himself and Mance, hoping to add the wildling army to his own. Mance refuses to kneel to Stannis, and he is subsequently burned at the stake by the red priestess Melisandre. Jon shoots Mance with an arrow before he succumbs to the fire. Stannis, who intends to take Winterfell from the traitorous House Bolton, offers to legitimize Jon as a Stark and name him Lord of Winterfell in exchange for his support, but Jon remains loyal to his vows.

As the Watch prepares to elect a new Lord Commander, Sam advocates for Jon who is unexpectedly elected as the new Lord Commander of the Night&#x27;s Watch, initially tying with his nemesis Thorne before the tie is broken by Maester Aemon&#x27;s vote. Jon&#x27;s intention to bring the wildlings into the Seven Kingdoms and grant them lands south of the Wall further enrages Thorne&#x27;s faction of the Watch, who all hold a hatred for the wildlings. Jon travels to the wildling village of Hardhome, seeking their support for his plan to ally the Night&#x27;s Watch and the wildlings against the growing threat of the White Walkers. Several thousand agree to come with Jon, but the rest are massacred when the White Walkers attack the village, although Jon discovers their vulnerability to Valyrian steel when he destroys one with Longclaw. Jon returns to the Wall, where he learns that Stannis has been defeated by the Boltons. Later, he is lured into a trap by his steward Olly and is killed by Thorne and his men. They assassinate Jon for his perceived betrayal of the Night&#x27;s Watch.

====Season 6====
Davos Seaworth finds Jon&#x27;s body. He, Dolorous Edd, and other brothers of the Watch loyal to Jon barricade themselves in a room with Ghost, and an attack by Thorne and his men is thwarted by the arrival of Tormund and his wildlings. Davos encourages Melisandre to attempt to resurrect Jon. The ritual seemingly fails but Jon suddenly awakens. After hanging Thorne and the other ringleaders of his assassination, Jon declares that he has been released from his Night&#x27;s Watch vows by death, and passes command to Edd. He makes plans to leave Castle Black. Jon is reunited with his half-sister Sansa Stark, who has fled her abusive husband Ramsay Bolton and seeks Jon&#x27;s aid in retaking Winterfell. Jon refuses until a threatening message arrives from Ramsay demanding Sansa&#x27;s return and announcing Ramsay&#x27;s possession of their brother Rickon. Jon, Sansa, Davos, and Tormund travel the North to recruit an army to take back Winterfell and rescue Rickon, but many houses refuse to support them. Jon convinces the wildlings to fight with him. As the armies assemble, Ramsay kills Rickon in order to provoke Jon and lure the Stark forces out of position. The ploy works and the outnumbered Stark forces are surrounded and nearly slaughtered, but the Knights of the Vale of House Arryn arrive with Sansa and Petyr Baelish and rout the Bolton army. Jon pursues Ramsay back into Winterfell and subdues him, but allows Sansa to decide his death. Jon gathers the lords of the North and warns them of the threat of the White Walkers. The Northern lords declare Jon the new King in the North.

Meanwhile, Bran Stark has a vision of the past which shows Ned reuniting with his dying sister Lyanna Stark in the Tower of Joy. She makes him swear to protect her son with Rhaegar Targaryen, who is revealed to be Jon.

====Season 7====
Jon prepares the North&#x27;s defense against the White Walkers. He receives a message from Cersei Lannister that he swear his allegiance to her, as well as an invitation to Dragonstone from Daenerys Targaryen&#x27;s Hand Tyrion. In a message from Sam, Jon learns Dragonstone has a deposit of dragonglass, to which the White Walkers and wights are vulnerable. He decides to meet with Daenerys. Daenerys wants Jon to bend the knee but Jon refuses, insisting that the White Walkers are a threat to all of humanity. Tyrion persuades Daenerys to let Jon mine dragonglass as a gesture of goodwill. Jon discovers cave drawings of the First Men and the Children of the Forest fighting the White Walkers and invites Daenerys to view them. As part of the plan to convince Cersei that the army of the dead is real, Jon leads an expedition beyond the Wall to capture a wight to provide proof of it. During the mission, when Jon kills a White Walker, the wights it had reanimated are destroyed. He realizes that killing the Night King will likely kill the entire army of the dead. When Jon and his party are surrounded by wights, Daenerys comes to their aid with her dragons. However, one of the dragons, Viserion, is killed by the Night King. Daenerys is forced to flee without Jon but Benjen Stark arrives to rescue him, sacrificing himself. Later, Daenerys vows to fight the Night King with Jon and he swears fealty to her as his queen.

Jon and Daenerys travel to King&#x27;s Landing to parley with Cersei. Cersei is apparently convinced to declare a truce so that the Lannisters may aid in the battle against the dead but later reveals to Jaime Lannister that she has no intention of keeping her word. Meanwhile, Sam and Bran have discovered that Jon was born Aegon Targaryen, the legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna and rightful heir to House Targaryen. Having fallen in love, Jon and Daenerys give in to their feelings for each other and have sex on their voyage north while unaware they are related by blood.

====Season 8====
Jon returns to Winterfell and is reunited with Bran and Arya Stark. He learns the Wall has been breached by the White Walkers. Though they have readied Winterfell for battle, Sansa and the Northern lords are angry over Jon bending the knee to Daenerys. Jon&#x27;s bond with Daenerys continues to grow, and he rides one of her dragons, Rhaegal. Sam tells Jon the truth about his identity as Aegon Targaryen. Later, Jon reveals this to Daenerys. The White Walkers arrive and Jon attempts to engage the Night King in single combat but is stopped when the Night King reanimates the dead to fight Jon. Jon attempts to pursue him to the Godswood, where Bran is waiting to lure the Night&#x27;s King, but is cornered by the undead Viserion. Jon prepares to fight Viserion, but the Night King is killed by Arya, destroying the army of the dead. In the celebrations afterwards, Jon is praised by the wildlings. This troubles Daenerys, who fears the people of Westeros would prefer Jon as their ruler over her. Jon is troubled by his blood relation to Daenerys, causing him to withdraw from their intimacy.

Jon assures Daenerys that he has no desire to take the Iron Throne, renouncing his claim for hers, but insists he must be honest with his sisters about his true parentage. Jon tells Sansa and Arya, swearing them to secrecy, but Sansa sees him as a preferable alternative to Daenerys and tells Tyrion. Tyrion informs Varys, who implores Jon to take the Iron Throne but Jon refuses to betray Daenerys.

Jon leads the Northern forces to help Daenerys claim the Iron Throne. They take King&#x27;s Landing and the city surrenders to Daenerys. However, having been driven mad by her recent losses and betrayals, Daenerys burns the city, killing hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. Afterward, she declares she will wage war on the rest of the world until she rules the entire planet. Arya and Tyrion warn Jon that Daenerys will view his heritage as a threat and she is a threat to the Starks. Tyrion tells Jon that despite Jon&#x27;s love for Daenerys, it is his duty to kill her to protect the people. Jon confronts Daenerys but, unable to dissuade her from further destruction, reluctantly kills her and she dies in his arms. Jon is imprisoned by Grey Worm and awaits execution. Tyrion convinces the lords of Westeros to set up a new system of kingship, with Bran elected the King of the Six Kingdoms (the North having been granted independence). Bran sentences Jon to the Night&#x27;s Watch to appease Daenerys&#x27; supporters as a compromise. Jon returns to Castle Black and leads the wildlings to return to their lands beyond the Wall.

<text>The Changos, also known as Camanchacos or Camanchangos, are an Indigenous people or group of peoples who inhabited a long stretch of the Pacific coast from southern Peru to north-central Chile, including the coast of the Atacama Desert.
Although much of the customs and culture of the Chango people have disappeared and in many cases they have been considered extinct, in Chile they are legally recognized as an original indigenous people since 2020, and about 4,725 people self-declare that they belong to this ethnic group.

==History==

===Definition and context of the Changos===
The culture originated in the 8,000-year-old Chinchorro tradition. Due to a combination of conquest and integration into other cultures and ethnicities, the Chango culture is now considered extinct. However, in Chile they are legally recognized as an original indigenous people since 2020, and about 4,725 people self-declare that they belong to this ethnic group.

The Changos were not a distinct tribe or ethnic group; rather, the term is used to refer to many disparate communities of indigenous people living along the northern Chilean and southern Peruvian coast in the Pre-Columbian era. The term &quot;chango&quot; was first documented in the 17th century by Spanish conquistadors who perceived little in the way of cultural difference between the local native communities. Therefore, &quot;chango&quot; describes a loose grouping of maritime peoples who shared a similar way of life rather than a common history or ethnicity. Chango culture developed adjacent to neighbouring cultures such as the Atacameños.
Chango culture is part of the Chinchorro tradition. The Chinchorro were hunter-fisher-gatherers with a particular reliance on the sea, who lived along the Atacama Desert coast from at least the 8th century BC. They are of special interest to modern anthropologists due to their practice of mummifying the dead.

Changos around Paposo appear by 1870 to have spoken a dialect of Mapudungun, the language of the Mapuche people of south-central Chile. In the coast of Antofagasta Region there are toponyms near the coast claimed to be Mapuche including Taltal and Quebrada Mamilla.

Some older works starting with Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna (1869) claim the Changos people extended once as far south as Valparaíso (33° S), but clear evidence for this is lacking.

===Chango economy===

Chango communities were organised into either nomadic or sedentary groups based on nuclear family units. Each group was independent of the others, providing food and other resources for itself.
The Changos were experts at exploiting the resources of the sea. Each group specialised in a particular type of fish, including tuna, conger eels, mullet, dart fish, mackerel and octopus. Rafts used for fishing developed from primitive reed constructions to craft made from three wooden planks, and later to seal skins fastened to wooden frames. Fish were caught using nets, hooks and harpoons.
The capture of seals was of crucial importance to the Chango way of life, with every part of the animal having its uses. The meat, fat and bones were used for food and tools, the skins were used to make rafts and the intestines to make fishing equipment.
As well as seal skins, the Changos used vicuña wool, feathers, bird skins, shells and the bones and teeth of sea creatures as materials to make practical and decorative items such as clothing, blankets, tools, cutlery and jewellery. They also made and painted ceramic utensils.
Despite their geographical isolation, the Changos traded with inland tribes, exchanging shellfish, dried fish, animal hide, guano, fat and shells for wool, fruit, maize and coca.
Chango cave paintings include images of men hunting and fishing and sea creatures such as seals, turtles and whales.

<text>HM Prison Cookham Wood is a male young persons&#x27; prison and Young Offenders Institution in the village of Borstal (near Rochester) in Kent, England. The prison is operated by His Majesty&#x27;s Prison and probation Service.

==History==
The prison was built in 1978, next to HMP Rochester and was named Cookham Wood Young Offenders Institution. The new prison was originally for young men, but its use was changed to meet the growing need for secure female accommodation at the time.

In 1998 the prison started accepting female juvenile offenders (aged 12–14), and was refurbished for that purpose. The costs involved with the refurbishment and the new facilities provided at the prison led to the media branding Cookham Wood &quot;Britain&#x27;s most controversial jail&quot;.

In a 2003 report the Prison Reform Trust criticised Cookham Wood for being one of the most overcrowded women&#x27;s prison in the UK. The report also highlighted serious drug misuse amongst inmates at the prison. However, a 2005 report by His Majesty&#x27;s Chief Inspector of Prisons commended the prison for improving standards.

In 2007 the Prison Service announced that Cookham Wood would be converted to accept male young offenders. This was due to increased demand for places in men&#x27;s prisons in the UK. Cookham Wood formally started taking male prisoners during 2008.

==The prison today==
Cookham Wood is a Young Persons establishment, holding males aged 15 to 18. Accommodation at the prison consists of single occupancy cells.

All young people have access to showers, and 45 minutes outside in the open air every day. The prison operates a resettlement programme for young people coming to the end of their sentences, and has links to community groups and employers.

In February 2014, the UK prison watchdog - the Independent Monitoring Boards - announced that they had serious concerns over the safety and decency for children at HMYOI Cookham Wood. The IMB 2022/23 IMB report highlighted the following concerns:

* An inhumane length of time spent locked in cells– up to 22 hours a day.
* Inconsistency and last-minute changes to the boys’ daily timetable due to a lack of available staff – a source of constant frustration for the boys.
* Far too many boys were separated from others, a strategy used to “keep boys safe by keeping them apart”. This, in the IMB’s view, generates fearfulness and an expectation of violence amongst the boys.
* Inadequate officer numbers to meet the boys’ needs.

The prison is scheduled to be repurposed as an adult prison in August/September 2024 and will initially accommodate those jailed arising from the 2024 United Kingdom riots.

<doc id="976166" wikidata="Q5276925" url="?curid=976166" title="Dillon Bell">
<text>Sir Francis Dillon Bell (8 October 1822 – 15 July 1898) was a New Zealand politician of the late 19th century. He served as New Zealand&#x27;s third Minister of Finance (the first parliamentary finance minister), and later as its third Speaker of the House. The town of Bell Block near New Plymouth – on land Bell bought from the Puketapu iwi in 1849 – is named after him, as is Bell Street, Whanganui. Bell&#x27;s son, Francis Henry Dillon Bell, became the first New Zealand born Prime Minister in 1925.

==Early life==
Bell is believed to have been born in Bordeaux, France, where his father, Edward Bell, was a merchant and the British consul. His mother was Frances Matthews, daughter of Reverend J. Matthews. He grew up speaking both English and French fluently. When his family ran into financial problems, his father&#x27;s cousin, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, managed to secure Bell a position as a clerk in the New Zealand Company&#x27;s head office in London. As a result of office politics, however, it eventually became expedient for Bell to go to New Zealand in person, acting as an agent for the company.

==New Zealand Company==
Bell arrived in New Zealand in 1843. He moved around New Zealand considerably, visiting Auckland, Nelson, and the Wairarapa before finally becoming the New Zealand Company&#x27;s resident agent in New Plymouth. While there, he successfully negotiated land deals with local Māori.

Later, following the resignation of William Fox as the company&#x27;s agent in Nelson, Bell was appointed to this position. Passing through Wellington on his way to take up the post, however, Bell found the company&#x27;s director in New Zealand, William Wakefield, to be in ill health. Bell postponed his journey to Nelson in order to help manage the company&#x27;s affairs, and Wakefield consequently recommended Bell as his successor before he died. In the end, however, Bell was outmanoeuvred by William Fox, who Bell was replacing as the company&#x27;s agent in Nelson.

Bell was very bitter at Fox&#x27;s victory, and it was possibly as a result of this bitterness that Bell became a strong supporter of Fox&#x27;s enemy, Governor George Grey. Grey appointed Bell to the Legislative Council of the New Munster Province. Bell&#x27;s reputation suffered considerably from his association with the Governor, however, and many thought of him as a time-server and a sycophant. Bell eventually returned to his company post in Nelson, although the New Zealand Company did not survive long after Wakefield&#x27;s death.

==Political career==


In 1851, Grey appointed Bell to the Legislative Council. When the Legislative Council was reformed, becoming merely the upper house of the new General Assembly (now called Parliament), Bell&#x27;s appointment was reconfirmed. In 1854, the Legislative Council demanded that one of its members should be appointed to Fitzgerald&#x27;s Executive Council (roughly corresponding to Cabinet). Bell was selected to join the four members of the lower house who had already been appointed, and took his place on 30 June. On 11 July, however, he was forced to resign due to the ill health of his wife.

He joined the Wellington Provincial Council for the Wairarapa and Hawkes Bay electorate and served from November 1853 to February 1856. He was a member of the Wellington Executive Council from 16 March 1854; the source does not state his end date.

In the 1855 election, Bell stood for the lower house in the Hutt electorate, and was successful. When Henry Sewell became New Zealand&#x27;s first Premier and formed the Sewell Ministry, Bell was appointed Colonial Treasurer on 7 May 1856 (the office from which the modern post of Minister of Finance is descended). Sewell&#x27;s premiership lasted only two weeks, however, and Bell lost his position. He resigned from Parliament on 10 October 1856 and moved to Otago.

Bell contested a 17 May 1858 by-election against Charles Brown in the Grey and Bell electorate. Brown and Bell received 75 and 61 votes, respectively. Brown was thus declared elected.

In 1859, he contested a supplementary election for the new electorate of Wallace, and was elected on 30 November. He was re-elected in the 1860 election, and elected as MP for Mataura in the following two elections. As an MP, he was highly active in campaigning for Southland to become an independent province, a goal which came to fruition on 1 April 1861.

He also joined the Otago Provincial Council and represented the electorates of Matau (1865–1867), Dunedin (1869–1870), and Otaramika (1871–1873).

When Alfred Domett became Premier in 1862, Bell became Colonial Treasurer once again, and also Minister of Native Affairs. Bell was relatively experienced in negotiating with Māori, and spoke the Māori language fluently. Bell was not particularly active in his Native Affairs role, however, as he believed that the Governor – not Parliament – should have primary responsibility for Māori relations. When Domett was ousted as Premier by William Fox, Bell lost both roles. From 1869 to 1871, Bell was a minister without portfolio.

After the 1871 election, Bell was appointed Speaker of the House. He is generally regarded to have been a competent speaker, having few strong views that might have biased him. He was knighted in 1873.

==Later life==
Although Bell initially intended to contest the 1875 election, he later decided to withdraw, expecting an appointment to the Legislative Council. A new government policy meant that this did not eventuate until 1877, however.

In late 1879 Bell, a pastoralist who by then had amassed a holding of , joined Fox as the other member of the West Coast Commission to inquire into Māori grievances with confiscated lands in Taranaki. The commission&#x27;s hearings, which had been prompted by friction between the Government and Te Whiti over plans to survey and sell previously confiscated land in central and south Taranaki, were closely connected with events at Parihaka, a settlement that became the centre of a passive resistance campaign against European encroachment on Māori land.

In 1880, Bell was offered a position as Agent-General in London. He served there until 1891. In London, Bell was involved in a large number of activities to promote New Zealand&#x27;s interests, including discussions with the French regarding their territories in the Pacific – his fluency in French was a considerable asset in this regard.

As Agent-General in London he was New Zealand&#x27;s senior representative at the World&#x27;s Fair and exhibition at Paris in 1889 which showcased our agricultural and natural resources. For his role at the exhibition, Sir Francis Dillon Bell was decorated with the &quot;Commandeur&quot; of the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; by the French Government in November 1889. He had previously been was awarded the KCMG in 1881 and a CB in 1886.

Apart from one brief visit in 1891, Bell did not return to New Zealand until 1896, when he retired to a farm in Otago. He died on his Shag Valley homestead in 1898.

==Family==

He married Margaret Hort in 1849. Her father, Abraham Hort, was a leading member of the Wellington Jewish community, but she became an ardent Christian. Their son, Francis Henry Dillon Bell became the first New Zealand born Prime Minister of New Zealand. Their second son Alfred managed their pastoral holdings; by 1874, he had over and nearly 80,000 sheep. Their fifth son, Arthur Bell, was active as an engineer in New Zealand and Western Australia.

<doc id="976172" wikidata="Q918287" url="?curid=976172" title="Viggo Kampmann">
<text>Olfert Viggo Fischer Kampmann (; 21 July 1910 – 3 June 1976) was a Danish politician who served as the leader of the Danish Social Democrats and prime minister of Denmark from 1960 to 1962. He formed his first cabinet just prior to the 1960 election, which was a coalition between the Social Democrats, the Justice Party and Social Liberal Party. Following the election, he formed another cabinet with the latter of the two parties. 

Before becoming prime minister he served as finance minister from 1953 to 1960 under Hans Hedtoft and H. C. Hansen.

Kampmann was born in Frederiksberg Denmark. He came from an academic background and was the first academic to rise to a high rank in the Danish Social Democratic Party. He studied economics at the University of Copenhagen, gaining a cand.polit. degree in 1934. Before becoming Minister of Finance, Kampmann worked in the newly formed economical secretariat as the Finance Minister&#x27;s closest adviser. He was first elected to the Folketing in 1953.

== Political career ==
When Prime Minister and Social Democrat H. C. Hansen died in February 1960 Kampmann succeeded him, creating the Cabinet of Viggo Kampmann I. H. C. Hansen had cooperated with the Danish Social Liberal Party and the Justice Party, but Kampmann had problems working with the Justice Party. After the 1960 Danish parliamentary election, the Justice Party failed to get into Folketinget and the Danish Social Liberal Party went from 14 to 11 mandates. But the Social Democrats gained 6 mandates to 76, and Kampmann was able to form a minority government with the Social Liberal Party.

A number of progressive reforms were introduced during Kampmann&#x27;s time as Prime Minister. The Rehabilitation Act of March 1960 established a unified framework providing rehabilitation, aids, vocational training, and special training centres for partially disabled and handicapped persons. Under the New Public Assistance Act of May 1961 (which replaced the 1933 Act) public assistance no longer resulted in the loss of political rights and restrictions on marriage. In 1961, health insurance was made compulsory.

In 1962 the oms, the precursor to the moms, was introduced.

Kampmann was one of the most intelligent and knowledgeable Danish Prime Ministers, though his conduct in office was erratic. Through most of his adult life he suffered from bipolar disorder, and in his darker moments he tended towards alcoholism and frequently &#x27;disappeared&#x27; from view for days at a time, leaving the government without its head. The press of the day, more discreet than their contemporary peers, never publicised any of this.

Kampmann resigned on 3 September 1962 after a series of heart attacks, and was succeeded by Jens Otto Krag as leader of the Social Democrats and as Prime Minister. In retirement he worked as a political commentator and head of the Press Complaints Commission. Kampmann died in Store Torøje on 3 June 1976.

<text>Kalsubai () is a mountain in the Western Ghats, located in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Kalsubai is the highest peak in Maharashtra and is located in Ahmednagar district in Akole Taluka. Its summit, situated at an elevation of , is the highest point in Maharashtra and hence it is known as the &quot;Everest of Maharashtra&quot;.

The mountain range lies within the Kalsubai-Harishchandragad Wildlife Sanctuary. It is visited throughout the year by avid trekkers, Kalsubai temple devotees and wildlife enthusiasts. It is named after one of the three tribal sisters Kalsubai, Ratnabai and Katrabai. The other peak, Ratangad, is named after Ratnabai.

== Geology ==
The mountain range was formed by the same geological events that gave birth to the Western Ghats. Resting on the Deccan Plateau, a large igneous province, it consists of solidified flood basalt dating back to the Cenozoic era.

== Geography and topography ==

The peak along with the adjoining hills spans alona downward-slanting east to the west axis eventually merging with the formidable escarpment of the Western Ghats at almost right angles. Along its length, they form a natural boundary demarcating the Igatpuri Taluka, Nashik district at its north from the Akole taluka, Ahmednagar district at its south. The mountain itself lies on the Deccan Plateau, with its base at an elevation of above mean sea level.

The mountain along with adjoining hills forms an enormous catchment area for the Arthur Lake which it overlooks.

== Reaching Kalsubai ==

The mountain can be viewed in its entirety from Bari village located on its eastern side, about from Bhandardara. It can be reached by road, via Igatpuri on the Mumbai-Nasik route. Trains leaving from Mumbai provide an alternate mode of transport to Kasara railway station, with connecting State Transport buses, plying on the Akole-Kasara route, leading up to the base village. Private vehicles from Kasara provide yet another alternative to public transport.

== Trekking ==
Kalsubai is a round-trip trek from Bari, with an elevation gain of around . This is a one-day trek having a moderately hard difficulty level, with lush green landscapes and multiple waterfalls. The peak attracts many trekkers and devotees determined to scale the mountain. To reach the summit there are well-designated trekking routes. The most popular route is through the eastern mountain face taking off from the base village Bari. The krushnavanti river, a tributary of Pravara, takes origin on its eastern slope and flows like a stream through the outer fringes of Bari. A short distance away from the stream a Hanuman temple has been built. This provides an important landmark to commence the trek as well as a resting post for those nearing the final lap of their trek. The route from behind this temple takes the hiker straight to the summit. The trek along this route is a mix of easy to ascend slopes as well as treacherous rocky outcrops overlooking the valley below. Considering the increasing footfall in recent years, the government has built iron ladders along the vertical hill slopes. These assist trekkers to allow for a convenient and safe ascent.

Regular route via Bari of the base village is easy for all trekkers, which has fixed ladders, cemented steps and several people flocking during the monsoon, the route via Indore is raw with stone steps and a huge iron chain for support at the dangerous patches.

It is recommended to wear full track pants as mosquito and other insects pose great problems. Be careful of honey bees. Having wooden stick is helpful.
== Kalsubai temple ==

The truncated summit provides a modest area of flat land which holds a sacred temple of a local deity.

A traditional prayer service is held every Tuesday and Thursday by a priest. During the festival of Navratri a fair comes to be organized each year with many stalls being set up near the summit to provide pooja materials to the devotees. On these special occasions, local villagers participate in this fair which helps to supplement their livelihood and as well as provides them an opportunity to revere the mountain.

== Ecology ==

Kalsubai comes to be protected under the precincts of a sanctuary. It nurtures nature in the vast stretches of forests nestled along their slopes and valleys. Open high-altitude forests dominate the scene. In the post-monsoon period, the region witnesses a dramatic makeover with flowers of different colors and varieties blossoming along the landscape. This attracts a hoard of butterflies, bees, dragon-flies, and other insects to feed upon the precious nectar.

During winter mornings, reptiles like lizards and snakes can be spotted sun-bathing near the ladders.

==Places of interest==

Bhandardara Dam, located 6 km away, impounds the Pravara river to form the Arthur Lake.

Arthur Lake: The clear and placid lake is bounded by thick canopied forests of the Sahyadri hills. The Lake gets its water from the Pravara River. It also attracts one&#x27;s attention from the summit.

Umbrella fall: it is formed as water from the Arthur lake is released periodically to drain downstream during the rainy season.

Ratanwadi temple: There is a beautiful historic temple in the village Ratanwadi.

To the north of the mountain range forts such as Ramsej, Harihargad, Brahmagiri, Anjaneri, Ghargad, Bahula, Tringalwadi, Kavnai can be seen. To the east one can spot Aundha, Vishramgad, Bitangad, to the west Alang, Madangad, Kulang, Ratangad (southwest), and to the south Pabhargad, Ghanchakkar, Harishchandragad can be seen.

== Culture and news ==
Touted as an unusual wedding, on 28 December 2014, in the presence of close family members, a couple tied knot at the temple situated on the summit.

Celebrations for India&#x27;s 69th Independence Day took place at the summit where the Navy unfurled the largest flag of India measuring 60 feet in length and 40 feet in breadth.

<text>Cordelia Bugeja (born 5 March 1976) is a British actress, best known for her roles as Julie in &quot;Not Going Out&quot;, Nikki in &quot;EastEnders&quot;, Melanie Hart in &quot;Family Affairs&quot;, and sex worker Kate in &quot;Respectable&quot;.

== Career ==
From 1993 to 1994 she appeared in the ITV sitcom &quot;Conjugal Rites&quot; as Gillian Masefield. In 2006, she appeared briefly in an episode of the sitcom &quot;Not Going Out&quot; as waitress Julie. (The producers had said in an interview that they had promised Bugeja a role after she stood in for someone at a read-through, but were forced to give her only a small part as &quot;Respectable&quot; was taking up most of her time.)

She appeared in over two dozen British TV commercials, most notably the award-winning campaign for Sure antiperspirant with the punchline &quot;Thank god you dumped him first!&quot;, and a hugely successful campaign for Yakult yoghurt drink.

She had guest roles in &quot;The Bill&quot; once in 2005, where she appeared as the girlfriend of a man who was holding his dad and three officers hostage at St Hugh&#x27;s and the second time in 2007 when she appeared in three episodes as Nina Lloyd, the ex-wife of CPS solicitor Matt Hinkley, who had driven her to a mental breakdown.

She has also appeared in &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; as Lilly Luxmore, in &quot;Cards on the Table&quot; in 2006; the 2008 British movie &quot;The Crew&quot; as Debs and in the &quot;Doctors&quot; episode &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Shoes&quot; as Branwen Owen in 2013.

<text>Kebby Sililo Kambu Musokotwane (5 May 1946 – 11 February 1996) was a politician from Zambia. He was a member of the United National Independence Party and one of the closest allies of former President Kenneth Kaunda. He was Minister of Finance from 1981 to 1982. Musokotwane served as the 5th Prime Minister of Zambia from 24 April 1985 until 15 March 1989. He then became secretary-general of the UNIP. When Kaunda stepped down as President of the party in 1992, following the party&#x27;s election defeat in 1991, Musokotwane was elected President of the party, with Kaunda&#x27;s support. In 1993 he was embroiled in scandal when he admitted that a radical faction of the party was conspiring to topple the new government of Frederick Chiluba. He died on 11 February 1996 at the age of 49.

<doc id="976183" wikidata="Q1368373" url="?curid=976183" title="Optimized Link State Routing Protocol">
<text>The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) is an IP routing protocol optimized for mobile ad hoc networks, which can also be used on other wireless ad hoc networks. OLSR is a proactive link-state routing protocol, which uses &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;topology control&quot; (TC) messages to discover and then disseminate link state information throughout the mobile ad hoc network. Individual nodes use this topology information to compute next hop destinations for all nodes in the network using shortest hop forwarding paths.

== Features specific to OLSR ==
Link-state routing protocols such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) elect a &quot;designated router&quot; on every link to perform flooding of topology information. In wireless ad hoc networks, there is different notion of a link, packets can and do go out the same interface; hence, a different approach is needed in order to optimize the flooding process. Using Hello messages the OLSR protocol at each node discovers 2-hop neighbor information and performs a distributed election of a set of &quot;multipoint relays&quot; (MPRs). Nodes select MPRs such that there exists a path to each of its 2-hop neighbors via a node selected as an MPR. These MPR nodes then source and forward TC messages that contain the MPR selectors. This functioning of MPRs makes OLSR unique from other link state routing protocols in a few different ways: The forwarding path for TC messages is not shared among all nodes but varies depending on the source, only a subset of nodes source link state information, not all links of a node are advertised but only those that represent MPR selections.

Since link-state routing requires the topology database to be synchronized across the network, OSPF and IS-IS perform topology flooding using a reliable algorithm. Such an algorithm is very difficult to design for ad hoc wireless networks, so OLSR doesn&#x27;t bother with reliability; it simply floods topology data often enough to make sure that the database does not remain unsynchronized for extended periods of time.

===Multipoint relays===
Multipoint relays (MPRs) relay messages between nodes. They also have the main role in routing and selecting the proper route from any source to any desired destination node.

MPRs advertise link-state information for their MPR selectors (a node selected as a MPR) periodically in their control messages. MPRs are also used to form a route from a given node to any destination in route calculation. Each node periodically broadcasts a Hello message for the link sensing, neighbor detection and MPR selection processes.

== Benefits ==
Being a proactive protocol, routes to all destinations within the network are known and maintained before use. Having the routes available within the standard routing table can be useful for some systems and network applications as there is no route discovery delay associated with finding a new route.

The routing overhead generated, while generally greater than that of a reactive protocol, does not increase with the number of routes being created.

Default and network routes can be injected into the system by &quot;Host and Network Association&quot; (HNA) messages allowing for connection to the internet or other networks within the OLSR MANET cloud. Network routes are something reactive protocols do not currently execute well.

Timeout values and validity information is contained within the messages conveying information allowing for differing timer values to be used at differing nodes.

== Criticisms ==
The original definition of OLSR does not include any provisions for sensing of link quality; it simply assumes that a link is up if a number of hello packets have been received recently. This assumes that links are bi-modal (either working or failed), which is not necessarily the case on wireless networks, where links often exhibit intermediate rates of packet loss. Implementations such as the open source OLSRd (commonly used on Linux-based mesh routers) have been extended (as of v. 0.4.8) with link quality sensing.

Being a proactive protocol, OLSR uses power and network resources in order to propagate data about possibly unused routes. While this is not a problem for wired access points, and laptops, it makes OLSR unsuitable for sensor networks that try to sleep most of the time.
For small scale wired access points with low CPU power, the open source OLSRd project showed that large scale mesh networks can run with OLSRd on thousands of nodes with very little CPU power on embedded devices. 

Being a link-state protocol, OLSR requires a reasonably large amount of bandwidth and CPU power to compute optimal paths in the network. In the typical networks where OLSR is used (which rarely exceed a few hundreds of nodes), this does not appear to be a problem.

By only using MPRs to flood topology information, OLSR removes some of the redundancy of the flooding process, which may be a problem in networks with moderate to large packet loss rates – however the MPR mechanism is self-pruning (which means that in case of packet losses, some nodes that would not have retransmitted a packet, may do so).

== Messages ==
OLSR makes use of &quot;Hello&quot; messages to find its one hop neighbors and its two hop neighbors through their responses. The sender can then select its multipoint relays (MPR) based on the one hop node that offers the best routes to the two hop nodes. Each node has also an MPR selector set, which enumerates nodes that have selected it as an MPR node. OLSR uses topology control (TC) messages along with MPR forwarding to disseminate neighbor information throughout the network. &quot;Host and network association&quot; (HNA) messages are used by OLSR to disseminate network route advertisements in the same way TC messages advertise host routes.

=== Hello ===
=== Topology control (TC) ===
== Other approaches ==
The problem of routing in ad hoc wireless networks is actively being researched, and OLSR is but one of several proposed solutions. To many, it is not clear whether a whole new protocol is needed, or whether OSPF could be extended with support for wireless interfaces.

In bandwidth- and power-starved environments, it is interesting to keep the network silent when there is no traffic to be routed. Reactive routing protocols do not maintain routes, but build them on demand. As link-state protocols require database synchronisation, such protocols typically use the distance vector approach, as in AODV and DSDV, or more ad hoc approaches that do not necessarily build optimal paths, such as Dynamic Source Routing.

For more information see the list of ad hoc routing protocols.

== OLSR version 2 ==
OLSRv2 was published by the IETF in April 2014 as a standards-track protocol. It maintains many of the key features of the original including MPR selection and dissemination. Key differences are the flexibility and modular design using shared components: packet format packetbb, and neighborhood discovery protocol NHDP. These components are being designed to be common among next generation IETF MANET protocols. Differences in the handling of multiple address and interface enabled nodes is also present between OLSR and OLSRv2.

<text>Michael Voss (born 7 July 1975) is a former professional Australian rules football player with the Brisbane Bears and Brisbane Lions, and current senior coach of the Carlton Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). 

Voss was a triple premiership captain with the Brisbane Football Club. He was also the first Brisbane player to win the Brownlow Medal (1996), which is considered the game&#x27;s most prestigious individual award; won the Leigh Matthews Trophy twice (2002 and 2003), which is awarded annually to the league&#x27;s most valued player; and has been inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. Additionally, he represented Australia in the 2006 International Rules Series. As a player, he was noted for his fearless play, inspirational leadership, and the ability to turn a game. As coach, Voss led Carlton to its first finals birth since 2013, coming back from 15th on the premiership ladder to ultimately finish the season in 5th place, losing to Brisbane in a Preliminary Final.

==Early life==
Voss was born in Traralgon, Victoria and lived as a child in Orbost until the age of 11, when he moved with his family to Beenleigh, a northern suburb of the Gold Coast at the time. Voss attended Trinity College during his high-school years in Queensland. His younger brother Brett also played for the Brisbane Lions before transferring to St Kilda Football Club to enhance his opportunities to play senior football.

Voss&#x27;s football skills were excellent from an early age. He made his senior debut for Morningside in the QAFL at the age of 15 years. A year later, he kicked 14 goals for Queensland in a second-division under-17 representative match, going on to win the inaugural Hunter Harrison Medal for the tournament.

Voss grew up supporting the Carlton Football Club.

==Playing career==
===Brisbane Bears===
====Rise to stardom====
At 17 years and 11 days of age in 1992, he debuted for the Brisbane Bears against Fitzroy at Princes Park in Melbourne in Round 18, 1992, the youngest-ever player to play a senior game for the club.

Although highly skilled, he was also slight, but he worked to get the most out of his body. By 1996, he was one of the most accomplished players in the competition, and at the end of the season he shared the Brownlow Medal, the game&#x27;s highest individual honour, with James Hird.

===Brisbane Lions===
At the end of 1996, following the merger of the Fitzroy Football Club and the Brisbane Bears, Voss and teammate Alastair Lynch were named as inaugural co-captains of the newly formed Brisbane Lions. In 2019, Kobe Howard described Voss as &quot;one of the game&#x27;s greatest players&quot; in Australian football history.

In 1998, Voss suffered a catastrophic injury while contesting a mark at Subiaco Oval in Perth in a match against Fremantle. He collided with Fremantle&#x27;s Shane Parker and broke his lower leg in half. The subsequent operation was at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, and it was a year before he was fit and in training to play again. This injury, along with the destabilisation caused by the merger of Fitzroy and the Bears, was a key factor in the Brisbane Lions finishing 16th (last) with a record of 5 wins, 16 losses, and 1 draw.

====Premiership and captaincy success====
Voss captained the Brisbane Lions in four consecutive AFL Grand Finals, yielding three premierships (2001–2003). His performance in the 2002 Grand Final against Collingwood was an outstanding example of courage, skill and leadership, only narrowly conceding the Norm Smith Medal to opposing captain and former Bears teammate Nathan Buckley.

====Later career====
In early 2004, Voss kicked a career-best seven goals against a struggling Adelaide at AAMI Stadium as coach Leigh Matthews looked to play him in the forward line during the latter part of his career. However, a heavy injury toll to the Lions meant that Voss continued his career in the midfield.

In 2005, Voss suffered a badly cut calf before Round 2 while renovating his home. He recovered to play his 250th game the following week, but the Lions suffered an embarrassing six-point loss to eventual premiers after they had led by 32 points at the final change. Prior to this, Voss had suffered from tendinitis of the knee but had been able to curtail the problem. The calf injury affected his performances, with the four games after the injury yielding a high possession count of only 16. Voss later improved, and in Round 21 picked up 35 possessions against Port Adelaide.

Soon after the completion of the 2006 season, Voss announced his retirement from his playing career after 289 games and 15 years at the Brisbane Bears and Lions with three premierships and a Brownlow Medal to his name. He was subsequently employed as a sports journalist by Channel 10 in Brisbane. Voss said farewell in what turned out to be his last game, at the Gabba in Round 22 against St Kilda, gathering 34 possessions and two Brownlow Medal votes as a struggling Brisbane Lions team went down by 50 points to finals-bound St Kilda, who won on Brisbane&#x27;s turf for the first time in a decade. Despite losing badly, the Lions received a long-standing ovation from a sold-out home crowd after the game for their prior premiership efforts as well as general farewell to several other players.

==Coaching career==
When announcing his retirement at the end of Brisbane&#x27;s 2006 season, there was speculation that Voss would soon become a senior coach or join Leigh Matthews in the Brisbane Lions coaching team. Voss instead joined the Channel 10 sports commentary team.

Voss coached Australia&#x27;s AIS Under-17 squad to victory against the South African national Australian rules football team at North West Cricket Stadium in Potchefstroom, South Africa.

Voss was often mentioned as a candidate to coach the Melbourne Demons after the resignation of Neale Daniher. He was also linked to various other coaching positions, most notably Carlton.

In May 2008, Voss accepted a consultancy role with the newly established GC17 bid team and was seen by many to be the likely inaugural coach of the Gold Coast side, but he instead signed a two-year deal with the West Coast Eagles as an assistant coach, which formally removed him from the running for the vacant Gold Coast senior coaching position.

===Brisbane Lions senior coach (2009–2013)===

When Leigh Matthews, senior coach of the Brisbane Lions, resigned at the end of their 2008 season, Eagles&#x27; chief executive Trevor Nisbett gave Voss permission to talk with his former club. The Lions later announced Voss as their new senior coach until the end of 2011.

Voss made his coaching debut in Brisbane&#x27;s defeat of the West Coast Eagles in Round 1, 2009.

In Voss&#x27;s first season as senior coach of the Brisbane Lions in the 2009 season, he guided the Brisbane Lions into their first finals campaign since 2004, including a comeback elimination final victory over Carlton after trailing by 30 points early in the fourth quarter. However, the Lions under Voss were eliminated in the semi-finals by the Western Bulldogs.

His next two years were not as successful on-field. After the club won its first four matches to be sitting on top of the ladder early in the 2010 season, the Lions under Voss would only win three more games, finishing 13th (out of 16) on the ladder. The Lions&#x27; 2011 Season was even worse, with the Lions under Voss finishing 15th (out of 17 teams), its worst placing since 1998 when it won the wooden spoon. This continued in the 2012 season, when the Lions under Voss finished 13th on the ladder. The Lions with Voss kept struggling in the 2013 season, where the Lions sat 12th on the ladder with eight wins and eleven losses after Round 19, 2013. 

On 13 August 2013, Voss was told that he would not be receiving a contract extension with the Lions for 2014. Voss then opted not to coach out his contract, which expired at the end of the 2013 season. Voss was then replaced by assistant coach Mark Harvey as caretaker senior coach of the Brisbane Lions for the remainder of the 2013 season. Justin Leppitsch was eventually appointed as the new senior coach of the Lions from 2014 onwards.

Voss left the club having coached 109 games for the Lions, achieving 43 wins, 65 losses, and 1 draw, for a winning percentage of 39.91%.

===Port Adelaide Football Club assistant coach (2015–2021)===

In October 2014, Voss joined the Port Adelaide Football Club as an assistant coach under senior coach Ken Hinkley in the position of midfield manager, replacing Phil Walsh, who had joined the Adelaide Football Club. One measure of his success at Port is the number of their midfielders selected for the All-Australian team Robbie Gray (2014, 2017, 2018) Chad Wingard (2015), Travis Boak (2020), Charlie Dixon (2020), and 2021 Brownlow medallist Ollie Wines (2021). Voss left the Port Adelaide Football club at the end of the 2021 season.

===Carlton Football Club senior coach (2022–)===
In September 2021, following seven years as an assistant with the Power, Voss officially returned to the AFL&#x27;s senior coaching ranks after being appointed senior coach of the Carlton Football Club. Voss replaced David Teague as Carlton&#x27;s senior coach, after Teague was sacked at the end of the 2021 season. Carlton Football Club President Luke Sayers on the appointment of Voss as senior coach said in a statement: &quot;After a thorough and considered selection process, Voss&#x27;s credentials and vast experience in football made him the right person for the job.&quot;

In the 2022 season, Voss took a leave of absence for one game in Round 2, 2022, against the Western Bulldogs after he tested positive for COVID-19. Assistant coach Ashley Hansen filled in as caretaker interim senior coach in the absence of Voss, and Carlton won the game by 12 points. Voss resumed his role as senior coach in Round 3, 2022, against Hawthorn, where Carlton won by a point. Carlton under Voss in his first year as senior coach, finished ninth with twelve wins and ten losses, just missing out of the finals, at the end of the 2022 season. 

Carlton under Voss in his second year as senior coach, finished fifth on the ladder with thirteen wins, nine losses and one draw, therefore making the finals at the end of the 2023 season, the Blues&#x27; first finals appearance in a decade, this included two finals win, which meant the team made a Preliminary Final for the first time in 23 years. Carlton under Voss were however eliminated by Brisbane Lions in the preliminary final.

==Post-playing career==
Voss joined the Network Ten AFL commentary team in 2007 in a special comments role. He was also appointed the role of sports anchor on &quot;10 News First Queensland&quot;.

In 2011, Voss was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame.

During the 2024 pre-finals bye, Voss witnessed a stolen car crash and flip outside Barton Café in Hawthorn, Victoria. After a short foot chase, assisted by Barton Milk Bar owner James Laskie, Voss tackled the 16-year-old suspect that was in possession of a kitchen knife and held the suspect through a citizen&#x27;s arrest until police arrived at the scene. An 18-year-old suspect evaded capture but was later arrested in connection to the theft. Michael Voss left the scene uninjured and collected his coffees from the café. Carlton player Sam Walsh was eating breakfast in the same café during incident.

== Controversy ==
In 2007, Voss was charged for his role in a melee with Simon Black, Fraser Gehrig and three other high-profile AFL players at a Melbourne nightclub. At the resulting trial, Voss agreed to enter a diversion program, and therefore no conviction was recorded.

<doc id="976189" wikidata="Q1901313" url="?curid=976189" title="Discovery (Daft Punk album)">
<text>Discovery is the second studio album by the French electronic music duo Daft Punk, released on 12 March 2001 by Virgin Records. It marked a shift from the Chicago house of their first album, &quot;Homework&quot; (1997), to a house style more heavily inspired by disco, post-disco, garage house, and R&amp;B. Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk described &quot;Discovery&quot; as an exploration of song structures, musical forms and childhood nostalgia, compared to the &quot;raw&quot; electronic music of &quot;Homework.&quot;

&quot;Discovery&quot; was recorded at Bangalter&#x27;s home in Paris between 1998 and 2000. It features extensive sampling; some samples are from older records, while others were created by Daft Punk. The electronic musicians Romanthony, Todd Edwards, and DJ Sneak collaborated on some tracks. For the music videos, Daft Punk developed a concept involving the merging of science fiction with the entertainment industry. Inspired by their childhood love for Japanese anime, the duo collaborated with Leiji Matsumoto to produce &quot;Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem&quot;, an anime film with &quot;Discovery&quot; as the soundtrack.
Before &quot;Discovery&quot;″s release, Daft Punk adopted robot costumes. They also launched Daft Club, a website which featured exclusive tracks and other bonus material. &quot;Discovery&quot; peaked high across several charts internationally on release. Critics praised Daft Punk for innovating in house music as they had done with &quot;Homework&quot;. The album produced six singles; &quot;One More Time&quot; was the most successful, and became a club hit. &quot;Discovery&quot; is credited for influencing pop production over subsequent decades. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it at number 236 in its updated list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Background and recording==
After their debut album, &quot;Homework,&quot; was released, Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo spent most of 1997 touring on the Daftendirektour. For the first half of 1998, the duo was focused on their own personal labels, while also working on the video collection &quot;D.A.F.T.: A Story About Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes&quot;. In 1999 and 2000, their time was split between making music for their own labels and recording &quot;Discovery&quot;. Bangalter noted that &quot;Homework&quot; influenced many other artists to mimic its sound, prompting Daft Punk to pursue a different direction to better distinguish themselves.

Daft Punk recorded &quot;Discovery&quot; in their studio, Daft House, in Bangalter&#x27;s home in Paris. Work started in 1998 and lasted two years. Bangalter and Homem-Christo made music together and separately, in a similar process to &quot;Homework&quot;. Rather than rely on the drum machines typical for house music, the Roland TR-808 and the TR-909, Daft Punk used a Oberheim DMX, a LinnDrum and a Sequential Circuits Drumtraks. They used samplers including the Akai MPC and E-mu SP-1200, and Fender Rhodes and Wurlitzer electric pianos, vocoders including a Roland SVC-350 and a DigiTech Vocalist, and various phaser effects. They used the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune on vocals &quot;in a way it wasn&#x27;t designed to work&quot;. Bangalter said: &quot;We&#x27;re interested in making things sound like something other than what they are. There are guitars that sound like synthesisers, and there are synthesisers that sound like guitars.&quot; &quot;Discovery&quot; was mastered by Nilesh Patel, who also had mastered &quot;Homework&quot;.

One of the first tracks to come out of the &quot;Discovery&quot; sessions, &quot;One More Time&quot;, was completed in 1998 and was left &quot;sitting on a shelf&quot; until its single release in 2000. After completing &quot;Too Long&quot; early in the album&#x27;s production, Daft Punk decided that they &quot;didn&#x27;t want to do 14 more house tracks&quot; in the way the genre is usually defined, and thus set out to incorporate a variety of styles for the record. The album features musical contributions from Romanthony, Todd Edwards, and DJ Sneak. Homem-Christo noted that Romanthony and Edwards were two of the producers that had a big influence on Daft Punk. The duo had wanted to work with them on &quot;Homework&quot;, but found it difficult to convince them to do so since Daft Punk were still relatively unknown. DJ Sneak wrote the lyrics to &quot;Digital Love&quot; and assisted in the song&#x27;s production.

==Music==
===Theme===
&quot;Discovery&quot; is recognized as a concept album. It relates strongly to Daft Punk&#x27;s childhood memories, incorporating their love of cinema and character. Bangalter specified that the album deals with the duo&#x27;s experiences growing up in the decade between 1975 and 1985, rather than it just being a tribute to the music of that period. The record was designed to reflect a playful, honest and open-minded attitude toward listening to music. Bangalter compared it to the state of childhood when one does not judge or analyze music. Bangalter noted the stylistic approach of the album was in contrast to that of their previous effort. &quot;&quot;Homework&quot; [...] was a way to say to the rock kids, like, &#x27;Electronic music is cool&#x27;. &quot;Discovery&quot; was the opposite, of saying to the electronic kids, &#x27;Rock is cool, you know? You can like that.&#x27;&quot; He elaborated that &quot;Homework&quot; had been &quot;a rough and raw thing&quot; focused on sound production and texture; in contrast, the goal of &quot;Discovery&quot; was to explore song structures and new musical forms, which was inspired by Aphex Twin&#x27;s &quot;Windowlicker&quot;.

===Composition===
In his review for AllMusic, John Bush wrote that &quot;Discovery&quot; is &quot;definitely the New York garage edition&quot; of &quot;Homework&quot;. He said Daft Punk produced a &quot;glammier, poppier&quot; version of Eurodisco and R&amp;B by over-embellishing their pitch-bend, and vocoder effects, including loops of divas, synth-guitars, and electric piano. &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;″s Keith Gwillim described &quot;Discovery&quot; as a disco album, with disco&#x27;s &quot;danceable&quot; and &quot;sappy&quot; elements, including its processed vocals and &quot;prefabricated&quot; guitar solos. Other critics described the album as post-disco and electro-funk. &quot;Uproxx&quot; said the album also incorporates French house.

The opening track, &quot;One More Time&quot;, features heavily Auto-Tuned and compressed vocals from Romanthony. &quot;Aerodynamic&quot;, has a funk groove, electric guitar solo, and ends with a separate &quot;spacier&quot; electronic segment. The solo, which contains guitar arpeggios, was compared to Yngwie Malmsteen by &quot;Pulse!&quot;. &quot;Digital Love&quot; contains a solo performed on Wurlitzer piano, vintage synthesisers and sequencers; it incorporates elements of pop, new wave, jazz, funk and disco. &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; is an electro song. It is followed by &quot;Crescendolls&quot;, an instrumental. &quot;Nightvision&quot; is an ambient track. &quot;Superheroes&quot; leans toward the &quot;acid minimalism&quot; of &quot;Homework&quot;. &quot;High Life&quot; is built over a &quot;gibberish&quot; vocal sample, and contains an organ-like section. &quot;Something About Us&quot; is a downtempo song, with digitally processed vocals and lounge rhythms.

&quot;Voyager&quot; has guitar riffs, harp-like 80s synths, and a funky bassline. &quot;Veridis Quo&quot; is a &quot;faux-orchestral&quot; synthesizer baroque song; according to Angus Harrison, its title is a pun on the words &quot;very disco&quot;. &quot;Short Circuit&quot; is an electro-R&amp;B song with breakbeats and programmed drum patterns. &quot;Face to Face&quot; is a dance-pop song featuring vocals from Todd Edwards, and is more pop-oriented than the other tracks on &quot;Discovery&quot;. In the context of the album, Bangalter noted that the preceding track &quot;Short Circuit&quot; represented the act of shutting down, and that &quot;Face to Face&quot; represents regaining consciousness and facing reality. &quot;Too Long&quot;, the album&#x27;s closer, is a ten-minute-long electro-R&amp;B song.

&quot;Discovery&quot; uses a number of samples. The liner notes credit samples from &quot;I Love You More&quot; by George Duke on &quot;Digital Love&quot;, &quot;Cola Bottle Baby&quot; by Edwin Birdsong on &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, &quot;Can You Imagine&quot; by The Imperials&#x27; on &quot;Crescendolls&quot;, and &quot;Who&#x27;s Been Sleeping In My Bed&quot; by Barry Manilow&#x27;s on &quot;Superheroes&quot;. &quot;One More Time&quot; contains a sample of the 1979 disco song &quot;More Spell on You&quot; by Eddie Johns. Daft Punk pay royalties to the publishing company that owns the rights, but Johns has never been located; as of 2021, he was owed an estimated &quot;six-to-seven-figure sum&quot; based on streams. Bangalter said Daft Punk also created their own &quot;fake samples&quot;, which listeners assumed were from disco or funk records. Homem-Christo estimated that Daft Punk played half of the sampled material on &quot;Discovery&quot; themselves.

==Promotion and release==
Daft Punk initially planned to release every song on &quot;Discovery&quot; as a single, according to Orla Lee-Fisher, who was head of marketing for Virgin Records UK at the time, although this plan was eventually shelved. &quot;One More Time&quot; was released in 2000, ahead of the album&#x27;s release. The album was available on 12 March 2001, with singles of &quot;Aerodynamic&quot;, &quot;Digital Love&quot;, &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot;, &quot;Something About Us&quot;, and &quot;Face to Face&quot; launched afterward.

The ideas for the album&#x27;s music videos formed during the early &quot;Discovery&quot; recording sessions. The album was originally intended to be accompanied by &quot;a live-action film with each song being a part of the film&quot;, according to Todd Edwards. The band decided instead to concentrate on an anime production. Daft Punk&#x27;s concept for the film involved the merging of science fiction with entertainment industry culture. The duo recalled watching Japanese anime as children, including favorites such as &quot;Captain Harlock&quot;, &quot;Grendizer&quot;, and &quot;Candy Candy&quot;. All three brought the album and the completed story to Tokyo in the hope of creating the film with their childhood hero, Leiji Matsumoto, who had created &quot;Captain Harlock&quot;. After Matsumoto joined the team as visual supervisor, Shinji Shimizu had been contacted to produce the animation and Kazuhisa Takenouchi to direct the film. With the translation coordination of Tamiyuki &quot;Spike&quot; Sugiyama, production began in October 2000 and ended in April 2003. The result of the collaboration was an anime film, &quot;Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem&quot;, which features the entirety of &quot;Discovery&quot; as the soundtrack.

Daft Punk adopted robot costumes in the lead up to &quot;Discovery&quot;″s release. The group told the press they were working in their studio at 9:09 am on 9 September 1999, when their sampler exploded. They had to undergo reconstructive surgery, and, regaining consciousness, they realized they had become robots.

Shortly before the album&#x27;s release, the group launched Daft Club, a website that offered exclusive tracks and other bonus material. Every &quot;Discovery&quot; CD included a Daft Club membership card bearing a unique number that provided personalized access to the website. Bangalter said this was &quot;our way of rewarding people who buy the CD&quot;. The service provided by the site ended in 2003; most of the tracks were then compiled into the remix album &quot;Daft Club&quot;. For the 20th anniversary of &quot;Interstella 5555&quot;, Daft Punk reissued &quot;Discovery&quot; with Japanese artwork, stickers, and Daft Club membership cards.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Discovery&quot; reached number two on the UK Albums Chart and the French Albums Chart, and number 23 in the US &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. It debuted at number two on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 13,850 copies in its first week. It was certified triple platinum in France in 2007 for shipments of 600,000 copies, and certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on 11 October 2010.

As of May 2013, &quot;Discovery&quot; had sold 802,000 copies in the US. &quot;One More Time&quot; was its most successful single, reaching number one on the French charts and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Songs charts, and reaching the top ten on seven other charts. It remained Daft Punk&#x27;s most successful single until the release of &quot;Get Lucky&quot; in 2013. The album&#x27;s fifth single, &quot;Face to Face&quot;, reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Songs chart in 2004. &quot;Discovery&quot; had sold at least 2.6 million copies as of 2005.

==Critical reception==

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, &quot;Discovery&quot; has an average score of 74, based on 19 reviews. AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush said that, with their comprehensive productions and loops, Daft Punk had developed a sound that was &quot;worthy of bygone electro-pop technicians from Giorgio Moroder to Todd Rundgren to Steve Miller&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; wrote that &quot;Discovery&quot; was vigorous and innovative in its exploration of &quot;old questions and spent ideals&quot;, hailing it as &quot;a towering, persuasive tour de force&quot; that &quot;transcends the dance label&quot; with no shortage of ideas, humor, or &quot;brilliance&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; named &quot;Discovery&quot; one of the best 50 albums of 2001.

Joshua Clover, writing in &quot;Spin&quot;, dubbed &quot;Discovery&quot; disco&#x27;s &quot;latest triumph&quot;. He felt that while it &quot;flags a bit&quot; near the end, the opening songs were on-par with albums such as Prince&#x27;s &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot; (1987) and Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; (1991). Stephen Dalton from &quot;NME&quot; found the pop art ideas enthralling and credited Daft Punk for &quot;re-inventing the mid-&#x27;80s as the coolest pop era ever&quot;. In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Will Hermes wrote that the &quot;beat editing and EQ wizardry still wow&quot;, but asked Daft Punk for &quot;less comedy, more ecstasy&quot;. &quot;Mixmag&quot; called &quot;Discovery&quot; &quot;the perfect non-pop pop album&quot; and said Daft Punk had &quot;altered the course of dance music for the second time&quot;.

Ben Ratliff from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that few songs on &quot;Discovery&quot; matched the grandiosity of &quot;One More Time&quot;. He found most of them &quot;muddled – not only in the spectrum between serious and jokey but in its sense of an identity&quot;. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alexis Petridis felt Daft Punk&#x27;s attempt to &quot;salvage&quot; older musical references resembled &quot;Homework&quot;, but was less coherent and successful. The &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Ryan Schreiber found the &quot;prog and disco&quot; hybrid &quot;relatively harmless&quot; and said that it was not &quot;meant to be judged on its lyrics&quot;, which he dismissed as amateurish and commonplace. Robert Christgau, writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, facetiously said the album may appeal to young enthusiasts of Berlin techno and computing, but it was too &quot;French&quot; and &quot;&quot; for American tastes. In a retrospective review for &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Douglas Wolk gave &quot;Discovery&quot; three and a half out of five and wrote that &quot;the more [Daft Punk] dumb the album down, the funkier it gets&quot;, with an emphasis on hooks over songs.

===Legacy===
In 2020, Petridis said he had reconsidered his review in the &quot;Guardian&quot;, describing the influence of &quot;Discovery&quot; on pop production over the following years. He wrote: &quot;Daft Punk were incredibly prescient: play &quot;Discovery&quot; today and it sounds utterly contemporary. My review, on the other hand, has not aged so well.&quot; In 2021, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; included &quot;Discovery&quot; on its list of review scores they &quot;would change if they could&quot;, upgrading its score from 6.4 to 10 out of 10. The &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Noah Yoo wrote: &quot;If scores are meant to indicate a work&#x27;s longevity or impact, the original review is invalidated by the historic record. Daft Punk&#x27;s second album, &quot;Discovery&quot;, is the centerpiece of their career, an album that transcended the robots&#x27; club roots and rippled through the decades that followed.&quot; 

In 2005, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named &quot;Discovery&quot; the 12th-best album of 2000–04. It was later named the third-best of the decade by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, 12th-best by &quot;Rhapsody&quot;, and fourth-best by &quot;Resident Advisor&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;Discovery&quot; the 30th-greatest EDM album, and included it at number 236 in its 2020 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. It was included on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Masterpieces&quot; in December 2009, highlighting its growing standing over the decade. In 2023, British &quot;GQ&quot; ranked &quot;Discovery&quot; as the sixth-best electronic album of all time. In 2024, Apple Music included &quot;Discovery&quot; at number 23 on their &quot;100 Best Albums&quot; list.

Several artists have sampled &quot;Discovery&quot;. Kanye West&#x27;s 2007 single &quot;Stronger&quot; features a sample of &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot;; Daft Punk performed &quot;Stronger&quot; with West at the 2008 Grammy Awards. Wiley&#x27;s 2008 single &quot;Summertime&quot; features a sample of &quot;Aerodynamic&quot;. &quot;Veridis Quo&quot; was sampled in the 2009 Jazmine Sullivan single &quot;Dream Big&quot; and in the 2023 Maluma song &quot;Coco Loco&quot;. &quot;One More Time&quot; was sampled in the 2022 single &quot;Circo Loco&quot; by Drake and 21 Savage.

<doc id="976204" wikidata="Q2753617" url="?curid=976204" title="John D. Bulkeley">
<text>John Duncan Bulkeley (19 August 1911 – 6 April 1996) was a vice admiral in the United States Navy and was one of its most decorated naval officers. Bulkeley received the Medal of Honor for actions in the Pacific Theater during World War II. He was also the PT boat skipper who evacuated General Douglas MacArthur from Corregidor in the Philippines and commanded at the Battle of La Ciotat.

Bulkeley&#x27;s PT-boat heroics in defending the Philippines from Japanese invasion in 1941-1942 was the subject of the novel &quot;They Were Expendable&quot; by William Lindsay White in 1942, which was turned into the big screen epic &quot;They Were Expendable&quot; three years later by director John Ford, starring John Wayne, with Robert Montgomery playing a somewhat fictionalized Bulkeley role.

The United States Navy named an guided missile destroyer after him: , commissioned in 2001.

==Early life and career==

Bulkeley was born in New York City and grew up on a farm in Hackettstown, New Jersey, where he graduated from Hackettstown High School. He was a 1933 graduate of the United States Naval Academy.

==Military career==
In December 1936, he was assigned to the United States Asiatic Fleet where he was appointed as engineering officer onboard in China and witnessed the Japanese invasions of the Chinese cities of Shantou and Shanghai, and the USS &quot;Panay&quot; incident during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

===World War II===
At the dawn of World War II, Bulkeley was a lieutenant in command of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, a Philippines-based detachment of six motor torpedo boats. He hit his stride as a daring, resourceful and courageous leader. On 11 March 1942, he picked up General Douglas MacArthur, his family, and his immediate staff, who had been ordered to flee the Philippines, and took them aboard and other motor torpedo boats through over of open ocean. On arriving at Mindanao, MacArthur said, &quot;You have taken me out of the jaws of death. I shall never forget it.&quot; Bulkeley earned many of his array of decorations while in command of that squadron and a subsequent one. He was evacuated to Australia by a B-17 aircraft in the final days of the campaign.

In September 1942, while back in the United States helping to raise War Bonds as a lieutenant commander, he met former Ambassador to Britain Joseph Kennedy at New York&#x27;s Plaza Hotel, and shortly after was instrumental in recruiting Lieutenant John F. Kennedy into the Navy&#x27;s Motor Torpedo Boat Training Center (MTBTC) at Mellville, Rhode Island. Kennedy&#x27;s command of would help to launch his first campaign for the United States Congress.

In 1944, he took part in the Normandy invasion. Bulkeley led torpedo boats and minesweepers in clearing the lanes to Utah Beach, keeping German E-boats from attacking the landing ships along the Mason Line, and picking up wounded sailors from the sinking minesweeper , destroyer escort , and destroyer . As invasion operations wound down, he received command of his first large ship, the destroyer . In August, 1944, Bulkeley was appointed to take charge of a diversion raid against the port of La Ciotat, an action that led to the Battle of La Ciotat. The two British gunboats under his command came under accurate fire from a German corvette and armed yacht. Charging in with only one gun working, he engaged both enemy vessels at point-blank range, sinking both. Afterwards, Bulkeley rescued the British sailors in the water and then rescued many of the German sailors as well. Later, he said, &quot;What else could I do? You engage, you fight, you win. That is the reputation of our Navy, then and in the future.&quot;

==Cold War==
During the Korean War in 1952, Bulkeley commanded Destroyer Division 132. After the war, he was Chief of Staff for Cruiser Division Five.

In the early 1960s, Bulkeley commanded Clarksville Base, Tennessee, then a tri-service command under the aegis of the Defense Atomic Support Agency. Having lost none of his wartime daring, Bulkeley was known to test the alertness of the Marines guarding the base by donning a ninja suit, blackening his face and endeavoring to penetrate the classified area after dark without detection. This was a dangerous endeavor, as the Marines carried loaded weapons. Ever popular with his men, who both respected and admired him, Bulkeley could be seen driving around the base in his fire-engine red Triumph TR3 sports car with a large silver PT boat as a hood ornament.

Promoted to rear admiral by President John F. Kennedy, who commanded &quot;PT-109&quot; during World War II, Bulkeley was dispatched to command the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, where he met Cuba&#x27;s threat to sever water supplies in response to the Bay of Pigs invasion and other assaults by ordering the installation of desalinization equipment to make the base self-sufficient.

==Retirement and return to duty==
Bulkeley retired from active duty in 1975. However, he was recalled to active duty in a retired-retained status in order to serve as the commander of the Navy&#x27;s Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) which conducts inspections and surveys of U.S. naval vessels before their commissioning and deployment. In 1986, Bulkeley conducted an inspection of the battleship , finding numerous deficiencies and recommending it be taken out of service immediately. His advice was not heeded, and three years later, it suffered a turret explosion, killing 47 crewmen. Later promoted to vice admiral, Bulkeley retired from the Navy in 1988, after 55 years of service.

==Personal life==
On 6 April 1996, Bulkeley died at his home in Silver Spring, Maryland, at age 84. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.

==Awards and decorations==
Bulkeley&#x27;s awards and decorations include:


===Medal of Honor citation===
Bulkeley&#x27;s Medal of Honor citation reads:
For extraordinary heroism, distinguished service, and conspicuous gallantry above and beyond the call of duty as commander of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 3, in Philippine waters during the period 1941 to 1942. The remarkable achievement of LCDR Bulkeley&#x27;s command in damaging or destroying a notable number of Japanese enemy planes, surface combatant and merchant ships, and in dispersing landing parties and land-based enemy forces during the 4 months and 8 days of operation without benefit of repairs, overhaul, or maintenance facilities for his squadron, is believed to be without precedent in this type of warfare. His dynamic forcefulness and daring in offensive action, his brilliantly planned and skillfully executed attacks, supplemented by a unique resourcefulness and ingenuity, characterize him as an outstanding leader of men and a gallant and intrepid seaman. These qualities coupled with a complete disregard for his own personal safety reflect great credit upon him and the Naval Service.

==Legacy==
The US Navy destroyer , commissioned in 2001, is named after him.

Route 57 in Mansfield Township, Warren County, New Jersey, is named the &quot;Admiral John D. Bulkeley Memorial Highway&quot; in his honor. 

The headquarters building of Naval Station Guantanamo Bay is named Bulkeley Hall. A quartering area for sailors at the naval station is named Camp Bulkeley.

==In the media==
Bulkeley&#x27;s version of PT boat heroics in defending the Philippines from Japanese invasion in 1941–1942 was the subject of the laudatory fictionalized novel &quot;They Were Expendable&quot; by William Lindsay White in 1942. Three years later John Ford directed a film version of the book, &quot;They Were Expendable&quot;, starring John Wayne and Robert Montgomery, who portrayed motor torpedo boat squadron commander LT Brickley, based on Bulkeley&#x27;s early experiences commanding Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three (MTBRON3) in the Philippines. Montgomery, a veteran PT-boat commander, assisted Ford in the direction. Donna Reed and Ward Bond were also featured.

Bulkeley was depicted in the 1977 movie &quot;MacArthur&quot; by William Wellman Jr. during the evacuation of General MacArthur and his family from Corregidor.

<doc id="976217" wikidata="Q592347" url="?curid=976217" title="Brandy &amp; Mr. Whiskers">
<text>Brandy &amp; Mr. Whiskers is an American animated television series created by sitcom writer Russell Marcus for the Disney Channel. It follows the lives of the titular characters – respectively, a pampered-yet-spunky dog and a hyperactive rabbit – who get stuck in the Amazon Rainforest together. The show originally aired from August 21, 2004, to August 25, 2006. Thirty-nine episodes were produced.

==Premise==
A pampered dog (Brandy) and an easily excited rabbit (Mr. Whiskers) face a new life of challenges together when they fall out of an airplane and become stranded in the Amazon rainforest. They make new friends: Lola, the boa constrictor; toucan sisters Cheryl and Meryl; and Ed the otter. Stories follow the titular duo as they attempt to adapt to their new surroundings.

==Episodes==

===Season 1 (2004–2005)===
Brandy and Mr. Whiskers start getting acquainted as they begin their new lives in the Rainforest. They build a treehouse to live in, using debris that fell out of the plane&#x27;s cargo compartment. A big part of the series is Brandy&#x27;s desperation to getting back to her home in Palm Beach, Florida. In the meantime, both she and Mr. Whiskers work together and build an unlikely but genuine friendship despite having a lot of differences, adapt by exploring the environment, and making friends with the native animals. Brandy makes attempts to get the jungle to become a civilized society by introducing elements such as fashion, hygiene, and shiny rocks, their type of currency. Mr. Whiskers prefers to mix things up by using the powers of invention and imagination to occupy his time, but it usually causes havoc in the jungle and affects his popularity.

===Season 2 (2006)===
As Brandy and Mr. Whiskers get more settled in the jungle, a lot of changes are put in order. They redecorate the treehouse by giving the interior a more &quot;homey environment&quot;, which includes flowery wallpaper, tasteful decor and an indoor bathroom (this was after Mr. Whiskers&#x27; new &quot;dream house&quot; was destroyed). The native animals also become more anthropomorphic as they have now established a new market economy in the Amazon. Brandy and Mr. Whiskers discover the mall in the first episode of season 2, &quot;Get a Job&quot;. They develop clothing, consumer products, restaurants, theme parks, TV commercials, a boy band called &quot;Sugartoad&quot; and a shopping mall. The adaptation has also lowered Brandy&#x27;s desire to getting back home as she grows to truly accept her new life in the Amazon.

==Characters==
===Main===
* Brandy Harrington (voiced by Kaley Cuoco) is a blonde-furred dog who was owned by an extremely wealthy couple and talks in a valley girl-accent. While on her way to a spa for the first time in an aircraft&#x27;s cargo room, a mishap with Mr. Whiskers caused the two of them to fall straight into the Amazon Rainforest. After she callously trades him to Gaspar for a map back home, Brandy hates Mr. Whiskers but on the plus side realizes that she cares for him deep down and rescues him. She prefers to make the most out of any situation, though she does attempt frequently for security to improve her own standing by abusing the kindness of her friends, despite loving and caring for them a lot. She believes herself to be a spaniel with a pedigree, but in the episode &quot;Pedigree, Schmedigree&quot;, it is revealed that she is a mongrel from a dog pound.
* Mr. Whiskers (voiced by Charlie Adler) is a white English Lop rabbit with an orange jumpsuit and a horrible case of body odor who has not had many friends during his lifetime. While he&#x27;s generally portrayed as goofy, hyperactive, dimwitted, and destructive, special moments display that he is actually intelligent and possesses a fairly large vocabulary. He is also very loving and caring, but he can be clumsy and clueless at times. When he first met Brandy, he was on his way to a zoo in Paraguay where he was going to be sold for 39 cents, though he soon made a mistake that caused the two of them to fall into the Amazon Rainforest. While Brandy is often embarrassed and irritated by his antics, Whiskers does his best to help her out and he does cherish his friendship with her, though she does not always reciprocate. Mr. Whiskers&#x27; other best friend is Ed, a river otter with whom he often spends most of his time.

===Recurring===
* Lola Boa (voiced by Alanna Ubach) is, as her name suggests, a pink and purple-striped boa constrictor who often serves as the voice of reason amongst Brandy&#x27;s friends. She speaks with a heavy Hispanic accent. While she often has great ideas, sometimes Brandy believes her ideas are not too bright and Brandy secretly believes Lola is gross because she swallows rodents whole while they are still alive. However, Lola remains Brandy&#x27;s best friend and she is usually there to help her out when the going gets tough, though Brandy&#x27;s vain and callous nature is sometimes too harsh for her to tolerate. A running gag with Lola is the fact that like a snake, she has no arms or legs. The others constantly make remarks about her lack of limbs, not seeming to notice until she acknowledges her &quot;disability&quot;. In the episode &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Snail&quot;, Lola&#x27;s profession seems to be as a nurse.
* Cheryl and Meryl (both voiced by Sherri Shepherd) are two twin toucan sisters that have a permanent grudge against one another and are Brandy&#x27;s closest friends next to Lola. While they care for one another, they often compete and bicker over petty matters, though they do agree with each other in certain rare circumstances. Cheryl and Meryl&#x27;s fights often lead to catastrophes that divert the paths of the plans concocted by Mr. Whiskers and Brandy.
* Ed (voiced by Tom Kenny) is a giant otter who is Mr. Whiskers&#x27; best friend. He is kind and easygoing, but also dimwitted. Both Ed and Mr. Whiskers usually come up with schemes, but sometimes Ed is the one who does the thinking. Despite the fact that most of their plans cause havoc, he is steadfast and loyal to his friend.
* Gaspar Le&#x27;Gecko (voiced by André Sogliuzzo) is the manipulative, self-appointed dictator/entrepreneur/musical director of the Amazon Rainforest, serving as the main antagonist of the series. However, the only reason he is the leader is that no one else bothered to take the position. He speaks with a French accent, though he is assumed to be from the local area. He has a strong desire to eat Mr. Whiskers and often (unsuccessfully) schemes in order to gain an opportunity to do such. Gaspar is one of the few individuals in the Rainforest who has the ability to help Brandy get back home to civilization, though after Brandy betrayed him by going back on her deal in the first episode, he hasn&#x27;t since offered to help her out again. Gaspar frequently partakes in using others to get what he wants or showing surface-level friendliness to suit his own personal interests. He also displays a more sensitive side that he usually keeps to himself, such as liking ballet and little dolls. He appears to be infatuated with Brandy. In the episode &quot;What Price Dignity?! (Cheap!)&quot;, Gaspar tells Brandy that his mother is coming to visit and says that he will give her a beautiful dress if she pretends to be his girlfriend while his mother is there, but it turns out that Gaspar&#x27;s mother is a fraud and the date was a sham.
* Margo (voiced by Jennifer Hale) is a walking stick who is rivals with Brandy in the social chain of the Amazon Rainforest. When Brandy first arrived in the Amazon, she helped her out by giving her some inside information on where the popular people hang out since she insists that Brandy shouldn&#x27;t hang out with Mr. Whiskers. Despite the fact that Margo hangs out with Brandy and her friends in some instances, she is far from afraid of belittling her in order to improve her own social standing. 
* The Monkeys (voiced by Tom Kenny and Jeff Bennett) are Gaspar&#x27;s minions. They are not very intelligent and either mindlessly do whatever they&#x27;re told or misunderstand what they are commanded.
** Lester (voiced by Bob Rubin) is a gorilla-like monkey who is usually seen as one of Gaspar&#x27;s henchmen. In one episode, he is portrayed as the bully of the rainforest who likes to beat up Mr. Whiskers.
* Whiskers&#x27; brain (voiced by Charlie Adler): He wears a bowler hat, speaks with a Yiddish accent and constantly leaves his owner&#x27;s head. He is more like a running gag but has come up numerous times.
* Harold (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) is a guinea pig who is shown in the second season as the pet of Mr. Whiskers.
* Mr. Sloth (voiced by André Sogliuzzo) is a three-toed sloth who often appears and almost never speaks.
* Gabriella (voiced by Kath Soucie and Grey DeLisle) is Gaspar&#x27;s girlfriend. She is often seen accompanied by Margo and the Lemur. Gabriella is an upscale basilisk lizard who takes care of her appearance and fashion. She is an enemy of Brandy.
* The Lemur (voiced by Tara Strong) is a lemur that is always with Margo and Gabriella. The three constantly tease Brandy, but always get their comeuppance.

===Supporting===
* Marvin (voiced by A.J. Trauth) is a marsh deer. Brandy got the idea she could only get his attention by whitening her teeth. In reality, he did like her but only started talking to her when she started talking to him, though her smiling creeped him out. He confessed this when they were being chased by a jaguar and his son. Their pursuers were tracking them by their bright teeth.
* The Vic (voiced by Thomas Lennon) is an emerald tree boa. He was the target of Lola Boa&#x27;s infatuation in &quot;The Skin of Eeeeeeeevil!!!&quot; In his second appearance, the Vic was the head of the jock-like Carnivore Club that Whiskers wanted to join. Unlike most of the other predators seen that chased after Brandy and Whiskers, the Vic and his two friends were not foiled but rather left hungry, feeling dejected that they were out-smarted by a plant eater. In &quot;Pop Goes the Jungle&quot; he is seen eating himself to stop hearing Brandy&#x27;s horrible singing voice.
* Wolfie Lobito (voiced by Diedrich Bader) is a wolf who was raised by a monkey who was raised by a panther who was raised by a coconut tree. Whiskers eventually turned him into a gentleman, but by then he was helpless to do anything as he watched Brandy fall off a cliff and into the water. Brandy instantly had a crush on him after he saved her from a similar predicament before. She&#x27;s seen him around before but never really had a chance to speak to him because she was too shy too. She was friends with him as well before but she had forgotten his name because they hadn&#x27;t seen each other in a few years. She wanted to date him and kept saying that she was going to make him &quot;the best boyfriend ever&quot; but she never really went out with him. Wolfie&#x27;s unmannered and impolite attitude got to Brandy so she started teaching him how to be a mannered wolf. Wolfie didn&#x27;t really like this so Brandy let him choose if he wanted to continue taking lessons from her or just go off on his own. Wolfie quickly took to this idea.
* Mama Croc (voiced by Kerri Kenney) is an American crocodile who Brandy and Mr. Whiskers had to babysit her nine eggs, or else she would eat them.
* Tito (voiced by Nestor Carbonell) is a monkey who teaches samba lessons. In the episode Brandy fights against bad weather to reach Tito before Margo; eventually, she learns Tito canceled the lessons due to his sick mother.
* Mr. Cantarious (voiced by Wayne Knight) is a jungle snail who was discovered to be the underside neighbor of Brandy and Whiskers when Whiskers&#x27; ball rolled into his house and smacked into him. When Cantarious refused to give Whiskers&#x27; ball back, Brandy and Whiskers did acts of revenge to him, including filling his yard with candy wrappers and having a loud party at night. However, Cantarious got back each time by sliming them with his snail slime, usually somehow orally. The running gag was Brandy, Whiskers, and anyone else who suffered his wrath running to a river, washing their mouths as they go &quot;Gross, gross, gross!&quot; They eventually made peace, but only for a short time when Whiskers offered to lend him salt.
* Isabelle (voiced by Jennifer Hale) is a giant tegu lizard. Whiskers had a crush on her and did all sorts of weird things to impress her like acting &quot;gangsta&quot;. She has a very short temper and lives with her parents. Isabelle didn&#x27;t like him back and ate him. Whiskers found a new crush inside her stomach and moved on after she threw them up.
* Dr. Phyllis (voiced by Hallie Todd) is a dugong who is a physician that helps people with their problems, especially Brandy and Whiskers&#x27; problems. She recommends Brandy to be like Mr. Whiskers, and Mr. Whiskers to be like Brandy, which by the way, ticked off Brandy. After Brandy turns the tables on Whiskers into going back to his normal self, they promised to Dr. Phyllis to never say THE blaming word ever again.
* Gina (voiced by Jennifer Hale) is an orange coati that Whiskers fell in love with.
* Tiffany Turlington (voiced by Amy Davidson) is very similar to appearance to Brandy and shares many interests with her. She has the same dog ears as Brandy&#x27;s, but brown colored and curved. Tiffany claimed to be very rich and has claimed to visit many different places. Brandy, feeling the need to prove she&#x27;s good friend material, lied to Tiffany about the places she&#x27;d been too when she really hadn&#x27;t. While Brandy has a musical leash, she has one with a tracker bug. She dislikes Mr. Whiskers.
* &quot;Poncho&quot; (voiced by Grey DeLisle) is a baby boar who appeared out of a bush. Brandy and Whiskers take Poncho in, much to Whiskers complaining. At first, Brandy tries to find Poncho&#x27;s parents. After failing to do so, she goes back to the treehouse. Later in the episode, Brandy teaches Whiskers about responsibility, and how others follow you as an example. Poncho is seen following whatever Whiskers does. Later, Poncho&#x27;s parents find him, and take him home.
* Sandy Carington (voiced by Sara Rue) is a fashionable dog who looks just like Brandy, but with orange wavy ears, green eyes, a mellow yellow shirt, blue cardigan, a darker blue skirt, and blue sandals. Sandy fell into the rainforest with Mr. Frisky the same way Brandy and Mr. Whiskers fell into the rainforest. She does not blame Mr. Frisky for confusing the hatch for a light switch, whereas Brandy thinks of Mr. Whiskers as a peabrain for confusing the two. Sandy is a nicer, more caring version of Brandy. Not only is she kinder, but better at everything than Brandy. Even Brandy&#x27;s friends and all the other locals like Sandy and Mr. Frisky more making their polar opposites jealous. Brandy and Mr. Whiskers try to sabotage Sandy and Mr. Frisky&#x27;s party and when that does not work, they accidentally fling them out of the jungle. They are both rescued and given a TV show, making them celebrities.
* Mr. Frisky (voiced by Charlie Schlatter) is a rabbit who is the best friend of Sandy Carington. He is very active and shares some habits with Mr. Whiskers, but he is far more agile and less devastating than him.
* Vlad (voiced by Tom Kenny) is a bat. When Brandy and Mr. Whiskers go to meet a new neighbor, Mr. Whiskers becomes scared because he believes that the neighboring creature is a vampire, despite the fact that nobody believes that Mr. Whiskers is correct. Eventually, Vlad admits he is a vampire bat, but keeps it secret because he&#x27;s annoyed with people thinking he is an actual vampire.

<doc id="976227" wikidata="Q6866042" url="?curid=976227" title="Minister of Aircraft Production">
<text>The Minister of Aircraft Production was, from 1940 to 1945, the British government minister at the Ministry of Aircraft Production, one of the specialised supply ministries set up by the British Government during World War II. It was responsible for aircraft production for the British forces, primarily the Royal Air Force, but also the Fleet Air Arm.

==History==

During the war, British aircraft production quickly expanded to be the largest industry in the country, involving hundreds of private firms and employing nearly two million workers. The Ministry was set up to co-ordinate the activity of this industry to maximise aircraft production. There was a headquarters in London and twelve regions, each with a controller and resident Ministry representatives in most of the larger factories.

The department was formed in May 1940 by the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, to produce large numbers of aircraft to fight the Battle of Britain. The first minister was Lord Beaverbrook; under his control the Ministry presided over an enormous increase in British aircraft production. Initially under the personal direction of the Minister, for a time it operated from his private home. The initial Chief Executive of the Ministry was Air Chief Marshal Sir Wilfrid Freeman, who left after frustrations with Lord Beaverbrook&#x27;s working methods but returned in October 1942 and served until 1945. The Director-General of Aircraft Production from April 1943 was Eric Fraser, who remained the most senior non-elected figure in the department. Fraser, whose pre-war career had been with Imperial Chemical Industries, was first appointed director-general of equipment production, before moving to the aircraft production post, which he held throughout the rest of the war. In 1945, Ben Lockspeiser was appointed director-general.

===Beaverbrook===
The first minister, Lord Beaverbrook, pushed for aircraft production to have priority for raw materials over virtually all other types of munitions production. This was needed in the summer and autumn of 1940 but it distorted the supply system of the war economy. It eventually came to be replaced by a quota system, with each supply ministry being allocated a certain amount of raw materials imports to be distributed amongst various projects within the ministries&#x27; purviews. Beaverbrook continued to push hard for increases in aircraft production until he left to become Minister of Supply. Controversially, under Beaverbrook&#x27;s tenure the aircraft programmes set bore little relation to expected aircraft production. Beaverbrook deliberately inserted an extra margin of 15 per cent over and above the very best that British industry could be expected to produce. The extra margin was added to provide an out-of-reach target to British industry so that it would push as hard as possible to increase production.

The ministry was characterised by, for its time, highly unorthodox methods of management, including its initial location at Beaverbrook&#x27;s home, Stornoway House. Personnel were recruited from outside the Air Ministry, interaction was informal, characterised by personal intervention, crisis management and application of willpower to improve output. &quot;Few records were kept, the functions of most individuals were left undefined and business was conducted mainly over the telephone&quot;. One important change made within days of the creation of the ministry was it taking over the RAF&#x27;s storage units and Maintenance Units which were found to have accepted 1,000 aircraft from the industry but issued only 650 to squadrons. These management and organisational changes bore results almost immediately; in the first four months of 1940, 2,729 aircraft were produced of which 638 were fighters, while in the following four months crucial to the Battle of Britain during May to August 1940, production rose to 4,578 aircraft, of which 1,875 were fighters.

This production rate achieved was two and a half times German fighter production and the ministry repaired and returned to service nearly 1,900 aircraft. The result of this effort and management style was that while the number of German fighters available for operations over England fell from 725 to 275, the RAF&#x27;s complement rose from 644 at the beginning of July 1940 to 732 at the beginning of October. Beaverbrook left the ministry at the end of April 1941. He was succeeded by John Moore-Brabazon, who was replaced in February 1942 by John Llewellin, who served until November 1942.

===Stafford Cripps===
Sir Stafford Cripps became the Minister of Aircraft Production on 22 November 1942, serving for two and a half years until the end of the war in Europe. He made a number of changes, including replacing unrealistic production targets, deliberately set too high to encourage effort, with realistic forecasts for each type of aircraft. Production levels were maintained at over 2,000 aircraft a month, with the number of heavy bombers – a priority – doubling to a monthly average of 458 by 1944. Production Efficiency Boards were established to monitor production and remove inefficiency with, in extreme cases, the ministry taking direct control of factories. Joint Production Committees were set up in each factory to aid an exchange of views between management and workers, with Cripps making over five hundred visits to factories in order to meet staff. Cripps left the ministry on 23 May 1945 when the wartime coalition ended.

===Post-war dissolution===
In May 1945 Ernest Brown, leader of the National Liberals was appointed the final Minister of Aircraft Production. In August 1945 the Ministry was abolished and a minister with responsibility for both aircraft production and the Ministry of Supply was appointed and the Ministry of Aircraft Production was fully merged into the Ministry of Supply on 1 April 1946.

<text>The Tees Transporter Bridge, also referred to as the Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge or, locally, as The Transporter, is a bridge over the River Tees in northern England. The northern side is in Port Clarence (Stockton-on-Tees) and the southern side is in Middlehaven (Middlesbrough). It is grade II* listed and the longest existing transporter in the world. Its winch house and piers are grade II listed.

It is the furthest downstream bridge crossing over the river. It is classed as the A178 road, the road between Middlesbrough and Hartlepool. the bridge has not been operational since 2019 due to safety concerns, and it is not expected to return to operation for a number of years, though a report on how to do this has been published. When working, the bridge carries a travelling &#x27;car,&#x27; or &#x27;gondola,&#x27; suspended below the fixed structure, across the river in 90 seconds. The gondola can carry 200 people, nine cars, or six cars and one minibus.

== History ==
The idea of a transporter bridge across the River Tees was first mooted in 1872 when Charles Smith, manager of the Hartlepool Iron Works, submitted a scheme to Middlesbrough Corporation. However, the scheme was not pursued, and it would not be until the new century that the idea of a transporter bridge across the river would again be revisited. Following a 1907 Act of Parliament, the bridge was built at a cost of £68,026 6s 8d (equivalent to £ in values), by Sir William Arrol &amp; Co. of Glasgow between 1910 and 1911 to replace the &#x27;Hugh Bell&#x27; and &#x27;Erimus&#x27; steam ferry services. A transporter bridge was chosen because Parliament ruled that the new scheme of crossing the river had to avoid affecting the river navigation. 
Construction work started in July 1909 with caissons being used to allow workers to dig down to bedrock. This turned out to be below the high tide mark on the Middlesbrough side and on the other. The shafts that had been dug out by this process were then filled with concrete. The formal laying of the foundation stones, made of Aberdeen granite, took place in August 1910 when they were laid by the Mayor of Middlesbrough, Thomas Gibson-Poole, and Alderman Joseph McLauchlan, the initiator of the transporter bridge scheme. The opening ceremony on 17 October 1911 was performed by Prince Arthur of Connaught. At its opening the bridge was painted red.

During the First World War, Middlesbrough was bombed by an L11 Zeppelin in April 1916. During this raid it was reported that a bomb fell through the structure before hitting the river below. During the Second World War, the superstructure of the bridge was hit by a bomb. In 1953, the gondola got stuck halfway. While it was stuck, gale force winds lashed water to within inches of it; despite this, the bridge continued to operate.

In 1961, the bridge was painted blue.

In 1974, the comedy actor Terry Scott, travelling between his hotel in Middlesbrough and a performance at the Billingham Forum, mistook the bridge for a regular toll crossing and drove his Jaguar off the end of the roadway, landing in the safety netting beneath.

In December 1993, the bridge was awarded the Institution of Mechanical Engineers&#x27; highest honour, the Heritage Plaque, for engineering excellence, in recognition of the council&#x27;s efforts in keeping the bridge in good working order. Its historical importance was also recognised in 1985 by its listing as a Grade II* Listed Building, and its prominence as a local landmark was further enhanced in 1993 by the installation of floodlights that operate during the winter months.

In July 2000, a visitor centre was opened on land previously occupied by the bridge workshop.

In 2011, the Tees Transporter Bridge received a £2.6 million Heritage Lottery Fund award for improvement and renovation work to mark the bridge&#x27;s centenary. The improvement works included the installation of a glass viewing lift to the landmark&#x27;s upper walkway and renovation of the gondola.

The bridge was closed on 27 August 2013 for 40 days of repainting. It was then discovered that repairs were needed. In the same year, the Tees Transporter Bridge Anniversary Award was inaugurated as part of the Transporter Bridge&#x27;s Heritage Lottery Fund-supported Visitor Experience Project in partnership with the Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation (CIHT) and Teesside University. The inaugural award winner was Stephen Brown in autumn 2013, with Jason Dunnett receiving the accolade in autumn 2014.

On 5 March 2015, the Royal Mail issued a set of 10 First Class commemorative postage stamps featuring iconic British bridges including the Tees Transporter Bridge. The bridge was re-opened for traffic on 6 April 2015, but improvement work continued with the bridge still in daily use. These were completed in September 2015 after more than £4 million had been spent on the structure.

In August 2019, the bridge was temporarily closed due to safety concerns.

It is thought that repairs could cost up to £7 million and it remains closed with its future under discussion.

==Local culture==

Locally, the bridge is often referred to simply as &#x27;the Transporter&#x27;. The bridge hosts an annual vintage bus running day, organised by The 500 Group. On this one day per year, usually a Sunday in April, vintage buses take people on free rides around Teesside. As part of the 2006 and 2007 events, the bridge made a special trip carrying a former Teesside Municipal Transport Daimler Fleetline, the first time a double-decker bus had used the bridge in 30 years.

It has been featured in films and TV programmes including &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot;, &quot;Billy Elliot&quot;, &quot;The Fast Show&quot;, &quot;Spender&quot;, &quot;Vera&quot;, and &quot;Steel River Blues&quot;. During the millennium celebrations of 2000, fireworks were fired from its length. The storyline of the third series of &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot; saw the bridge dismantled to be sold to and re-erected in the United States. The local council received calls from people worried that the bridge was really being pulled down, with the BBC adding a disclaimer on the end of the final episode of the series stating that &#x27;The Transporter Bridge is still in Middlesbrough&#x27;.

<doc id="976248" wikidata="Q999487" url="?curid=976248" title="Bairiki">
<text>Bairiki is a town located in South Tarawa, Kiribati. It is crucial to the country&#x27;s political and administrative structure as several governmental organizations and diplomatic missions are situated there.

== Landmarks ==
The State House, a building that serves as the official residence of Kiribati&#x27;s head of state, is located in the center of Bairiki. It serves as both a historical and diplomatic landmark and a representation of the country&#x27;s governance. The National Stadium, a location significant for holding numerous sporting events and national meetings.

==Overview==
The High Commissions of Australia and New Zealand, as well as the embassy of China, are located in Bairiki. The majority of Government Ministries have their headquarters in this community.

The Teinainano Urban Council (TUC), which is in charge of managing many facets of local government and community development, has administrative control over Bairiki. The TUC is essential in preserving Bairiki&#x27;s infrastructure and public services, assuring the welfare and prosperity of its residents.

The 2010 Census estimated Bairiki&#x27;s population to be 3,524.

== Geography ==
Bairiki is an islet near the Western end of South Tarawa. It is joined to Betio by the Nippon Causeway, which opened in 1989, and is also joined to Naanekai by a causeway, forming part of a continuous road which links South Tarawa from Betio in the West to Bonriki International Airport in the East.

Bairiki is a small islet, with a land area of less than half a square km. Much of the land is occupied by the Government itself, including the Bairiki National Stadium and the main offices of many of the Government ministries, and by foreign High Commissions with their associated residences. The village community of Bairiki lives in very crowded conditions, and rapid population growth is causing significant problems.

==Education==

King George V School, a secondary school for boys, opened in Bairiki in 1922. It later moved to Abemama.

==Transport==

The city has road connections to Betio and Nanikai

<text>The early Norwegian black metal scene of the 1990s is credited with shaping the modern black metal genre and producing some of the most acclaimed and influential artists in extreme metal.

The scene had a distinct ethos, and its core members referred to themselves as &quot;The Black Circle&quot; or &quot;Black Metal Inner Circle.&quot; This group consisted of men who congregated at the record shop Helvete (&quot;Hell&quot;) in Oslo. In interviews, they expressed anti-Christian and misanthropic views, presenting themselves as a cult-like group of militant Satanists intent on spreading terror, hatred, and evil. They adopted pseudonyms and appeared in photographs adorned with &quot;corpse paint&quot; and wielding medieval weaponry. The scene was exclusive, creating boundaries around itself and incorporating only those it deemed &quot;true&quot; or committed. Musical integrity was paramount, and artists sought to maintain black metal&#x27;s underground status.

In August 1993, several of its members were arrested, and in May 1994, they were convicted of arson, murder, assault, and possession of explosives, most notably Varg Vikernes for the murder of Euronymous. Most showed no remorse for their actions at the time. Some Norwegian media referred to them as &quot;Satanic terrorists,&quot; and one Norwegian TV channel interviewed a woman who claimed that Satanists had sacrificed her child and killed her dog. The early Norwegian black metal scene has since been the subject of numerous books and documentaries.
== Ideology ==
The Norwegian black metal scene was vehemently opposed to Christianity and organized religion as a whole. In interviews during the early 1990s, Euronymous and other members of the scene portrayed themselves as militant misanthropic devil worshippers who sought to spread hatred, sorrow, and evil. They criticized the Church of Satan for being too &quot;humane.&quot; The theistic Satanism they advocated was an inversion of Christianity. Euronymous was the key figure behind this ideology. He professed to support totalitarianism and to oppose compassion, peace, happiness, and fun. When asked why such statements were made to the press, Ihsahn of Emperor stated, &quot;I think that was very much to create fear among people.&quot; He added that the scene &quot;wanted to be in opposition to society&quot; and &quot;tried to concentrate more on just being &#x27;evil&#x27; than having a real Satanic philosophy.&quot; Vikernes claimed that the reason they professed to advocate &quot;evil&quot; was to provoke.

According to the book &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;, many who knew Euronymous claim that &quot;the extreme Satanic image he projected was, in fact, just that – a projection which bore little resemblance to his real personality.&quot; Those making this assertion include Necrobutcher, Kjetil Manheim, Vikernes, and Blackthorn (the latter two were convicted for his murder). Faust stated that with Euronymous, &quot;there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire.&quot; Mortiis, however, asserted that Euronymous &quot;was such a devil worshipper you wouldn&#x27;t believe it,&quot; while Metalion, who had known Euronymous since 1985 and considered him his best friend, remarked that Euronymous &quot;was always telling what he thought... worshipping death and being extreme.&quot; Regarding other members of the scene, Samuel Fridh suggests that there is no evidence to support their early claims of being devil worshippers, and Leif A. Lier, who led the police investigation following Euronymous&#x27;s death, stated that he and his team had not encountered a single Satanist. Faust remarked that &quot;for some people it [Satanism] was bloody serious, but to a lot of them it was all a big hype.&quot;

In retrospect, Metalion reflected, &quot;In the past, people just wrote about Satan, but now people meant it. I believe it was serious—maybe not all the Satanism, but definitely the approach to the music and the lifestyle. It was certainly more destructive than metal had been in the past.&quot; Tenebris from the Misanthropic Luciferian Order, a Swedish Satanic order, noted that the Norwegian scene &quot;meant a lot as long as it lasted. Back then, in 1991, things mainly concerned black metal and ideological Satanism (not so much practical Satanism, but anyway...)... It grew quickly to become a sort of black metal army... and kind of stood and fell with Euronymous and his shop. Therefore, it vanished with his death in &#x27;93... Sadly enough, many people involved at the time betrayed their ideals and lost their interest when things fell apart. Like it was nothing more than a hype of temporary nature.&quot;

Regarding the term &quot;black metal,&quot; Euronymous stated that it applies to any heavy metal band that identifies as theistic Satanists and writes Satanic lyrics. Such notions were echoed by other members of the scene, including Faust. At the time, bands with a style akin to Norwegian black metal but lacking Satanic lyrics tended to use alternative terms to describe their music.

Some bands within the scene were intrigued by pre-Christian Norway and its traditions, and there was an undercurrent of romantic nationalism present. Additionally, some scene members engaged with Nazi imagery, primarily as a means of provocation. In a private letter written in the early 1990s, Euronymous asserted that &quot;almost all&quot; Norwegian black metal bands at the time were &quot;more or less Nazis.&quot; He expressed an interest in totalitarian communist states, claiming he wished to see people &quot;rot under communist dictatorship.&quot;

== Origins ==
 
During the 1980s, &quot;black metal&quot; was a loose collective of a few heavy metal bands that shared Satanic lyrics; however, most of the &quot;first wave&quot; bands employed Satanism primarily for shock value.

Mayhem&#x27;s debut EP &quot;Deathcrush&quot; (1987) was one of the most influential releases from the first wave of black metal, largely founding the early Norwegian black metal scene. The band drew on the influence of the first wave of black metal such as Hellhammer, Venom and Bathory, the punk of Amebix, GBH, Discharge and the Misfits, as well as more experimental groups like Tangerine Dream and Pink Floyd. In the book &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;, Mayhem were credited as the band who combined the influence of the disparate styles of black metal&#x27;s first wave and created the style that is understood as black metal today.

In 1988, the band hired vocalist Per &quot;Dead&quot; Ohlin of the Swedish band Morbid. Dead wore corpse paint, black and white makeup to achieve a ghastly appearance. According to Mayhem bassist Necrobutcher, &quot;it wasn&#x27;t anything to do with the way Kiss and Alice Cooper used makeup. Dead actually wanted to look like a corpse. He didn&#x27;t do it to look cool.&quot; This would go on to become a hallmark of the Norwegian black metal scene. Dead would also bury his stage clothes and dig them up to wear on concert nights.

Other first wave Norwegian black metal bands included Old Funeral (formed in 1988), Stigma Diabolicum (formed in 1989 and later changed their name to Thorns) and Mortem (formed in 1989). Mayhem guitarist Øystein &quot;Euronymous&quot; Aarseth and Snorre &quot;Blackthorn&quot; Ruch of Thorns developed a style of riffing where guitarists played full chords utilising all the strings of the guitar instead of relying on power chords, which typically use only two or three strings, which would become a key element of the subsequent waves of black metal.

== Dead&#x27;s suicide == 
On 8 April 1991, Mayhem vocalist and lyricist Per Yngve Ohlin, known by the stage name &quot;Dead,&quot; committed suicide with a shotgun while alone in a house shared by the band. Fellow musicians described Dead as odd, introverted, and depressed. For performances, he made himself look like a corpse and engaged in self-harm while performing. Dead was discovered by Mayhem guitarist Euronymous with his wrists and throat slit and a gunshot wound to his forehead. Before calling the police, Euronymous took a camera and photographed the body after rearranging some items. One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album: &quot;Dawn of the Black Hearts&quot;.

Euronymous exploited Dead&#x27;s suicide to enhance Mayhem&#x27;s &quot;evil&quot; image, claiming that Dead had killed himself because black metal had become &quot;trendy&quot; and commercialized. He created necklaces purportedly made from fragments of Dead&#x27;s skull and distributed them to musicians he considered worthy. &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; writer Enrico Ahlig cited the notoriety of the event as beginning the second wave of black metal. Mayhem bassist Jørn &#x27;Necrobutcher&#x27; Stubberud noted, &quot;people became more aware of the black metal scene after Dead had shot himself [...]; I think it was Dead&#x27;s suicide that really changed the scene.&quot; The suicide caused a rift between Euronymous and some of his friends, particularly Necrobutcher, who were disgusted by his attitude towards Dead. Some claimed Euronymous &quot;went into a fantasy world&quot; and &quot;tried to be as extreme as he had talked about.&quot;

The months following the event saw the formation of Norwegian black metal bands Arcturus, Burzum, Carpathian Forest, Emperor, Enslaved, Immortal, Mysticum, Satyricon, Hades Almighty and Gorgoroth. Many of the musicians in these acts had previously been members of death metal bands, while other bands such as Darkthrone instead changed their sound from death metal to black metal.

Two other members of the scene would later commit suicide: Erik &#x27;Grim&#x27; Brødreskift (of Immortal, Borknagar, Gorgoroth) in 1999 and Espen &#x27;Storm&#x27; Andersen (of Strid) in 2001.

== Helvete and the &quot;Black Circle&quot; == 
Mayhem guitarist Euronymous was &quot;the central figure involved in the formation of the Norwegian black metal scene,&quot; which he &quot;almost single-handedly founded.&quot; During May–June 1991, he opened a record shop called Helvete (Norwegian for &quot;Hell&quot;). The shop was located at Schweigaards gate 56 in Oslo. Norwegian black metal musicians often gathered at the shop and in its basement. These included members of Mayhem, members of Emperor, Varg &quot;Count Grishnackh&quot; Vikernes of Burzum, and &quot;Blackthorn&quot; of Thorns. Euronymous also established an independent record label called Deathlike Silence Productions, which was based at Helvete. This label released albums by Norwegian bands Mayhem and Burzum, Swedish bands Merciless and Abruptum, and a Japanese band Sigh. Euronymous, Varg, and Emperor guitarist Tomas &quot;Samoth&quot; Haugen lived in the shop at various times. Emperor drummer Bård &quot;Faust&quot; Eithun also lived and worked there. The shop&#x27;s walls were painted black and adorned with medieval weapons, posters of bands, and picture discs, while its window featured a polystyrene tombstone.

During its operation, Helvete served as the focal point of the Norwegian black metal scene. Jon &quot;Metalion&quot; Kristiansen, the writer of the fanzine &quot;Slayer&quot;, stated that the opening of Helvete marked &quot;the creation of the whole Norwegian Black Metal scene.&quot; Daniel Ekeroth noted in 2008:

The individuals who gathered at Helvete have been referred to as the &quot;Black Circle&quot; or &quot;Black Metal Inner Circle,&quot; a term allegedly coined by Euronymous. Euronymous portrayed the &quot;Black Circle&quot; as an organized, cult-like group of militant Satanists, with activities funded by his record shop. A 1993 article in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; described them as &quot;Satanic terrorists.&quot; Faust later remarked that it was &quot;just a name that was invented for the people who hung around the shop... there wasn&#x27;t anything like members and membership cards and official meetings.&quot; Similarly, in his review of &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot;, Varg Vikernes claimed, &quot;The so-called &#x27;Black Circle&#x27; was something Euronymous made up because he wanted to make people believe there was such a thing, but it was nonsense and never existed. The media, on the other hand, believed it existed for a while, but quickly stopped talking about it when they understood it was a fake rumor.&quot;

According to Stian &quot;Occultus&quot; Johansen, the space that Euronymous rented &quot;was far too big and the rent was too high. That&#x27;s the reason why it never did well.&quot; Only a small part of the building was utilized for the shop itself. Euronymous closed Helvete in early 1993 when it began to attract the attention of the police and media. The store has since reopened under the name Neseblod Records, in the same location but with significantly less floor space. (&#x27;Neseblod&#x27; is Norwegian for &#x27;nosebleed&#x27;.) Many of the original artifacts still remain, and the store also identifies as a &quot;black metal museum.&quot;

== Church arsons and attempts == 

In 1992, members of the Norwegian black metal scene initiated a wave of arson attacks on Christian churches. By 1996, there had been at least 50 attacks in Norway; in every case that was solved, those responsible were identified as black metal fans. Some of the targeted buildings were hundreds of years old and regarded as significant historical landmarks. The first was Norway&#x27;s Fantoft Stave Church, which was reduced to ashes in June 1992. Authorities believe Varg Vikernes of Burzum was responsible, and the cover of Burzum&#x27;s EP &quot;Aske&quot; (&quot;ashes&quot;) features a photograph of the destroyed church. On 16 May 1994, Vikernes was found guilty of burning down the Holmenkollen Chapel, Skjold Church, and Åsane Church. Additionally, he was convicted of an attempted arson of a fourth church and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. Members of the Swedish black metal scene began burning churches as well in 1993. 

To coincide with the release of Mayhem&#x27;s &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot;, Vikernes and Euronymous allegedly plotted to bomb the Nidaros Cathedral, which appears on the album cover. The musicians Faust, Samoth, (both of Emperor), and Jørn Inge Tunsberg (of Hades Almighty) were also convicted of church arsons. Those convicted of church burnings expressed no remorse and described their actions as a symbolic &quot;retaliation&quot; against Christianity in Norway. Mayhem drummer Hellhammer stated he had called for attacks on mosques and Hindu temples, arguing that they were more foreign. Today, opinions regarding the church burnings vary within the black metal community. Many musicians, singers, and songwriters from the early Norwegian black metal scene, such as Infernus and Gaahl of Gorgoroth, continue to praise the church burnings, with the latter asserting, &quot;there should have been more of them, and there will be more of them.&quot; Conversely, others, such as Necrobutcher and Kjetil Manheim of Mayhem and Abbath of Immortal, view the church burnings as ultimately futile. Manheim claimed that many arsons were &quot;just people trying to gain acceptance&quot; within the black metal scene. Watain vocalist Erik Danielsson acknowledged respect for the attacks but commented on those responsible: &quot;the only Christianity they defeated was the last piece of Christianity within themselves. Which is a very good beginning, of course.&quot;

== Murder of Magne Andreassen == 
On 21 August 1992, Bård &quot;Faust&quot; Eithun murdered Magne Andreassen, a gay man, in Lillehammer. According to Faust, while walking home at night, a man made a sexual advance toward him, and Faust agreed to walk with him to the Olympic park. Once in the woods, Faust stabbed Andreassen 37 times, then proceeded to kick him in the head repeatedly as he lay on the ground.

Faust claimed that he felt no remorse at the time. In the late 1990s, he reflected on the murder, stating, &quot;I was outside, just waiting to get out some aggression. It&#x27;s not easy to describe why it happened. It was meant to happen, and if it was this man or another man, that&#x27;s not really important.&quot; Ihsahn, his bandmate in Emperor, remarked that Faust &quot;had been very fascinated by serial killers for a long time, and I guess he wanted to know what it&#x27;s like to kill a person.&quot; 

Initially, the police had no suspects, and Faust remained free for approximately a year. However, he confided in Euronymous, Vikernes, and a few others about his crime. The day following the stabbing, he returned to Oslo and allegedly burned down Holmenkollen Chapel with Vikernes and Euronymous. After the murder of Euronymous in August 1993, Faust was arrested and confessed to Andreassen&#x27;s murder. In 1994, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison but was released in 2003.

== &quot;Bergens Tidende&quot; article == 
In January 1993, an article in one of Norway&#x27;s largest newspapers, &quot;Bergens Tidende&quot; (&quot;BT&quot;), brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight. Two friends of Vikernes interviewed him and submitted the interview to the newspaper, hoping for publication. In the anonymous interview, &quot;Count Grishnackh&quot; (Vikernes) claimed to have burned churches and killed a man in Lillehammer. &quot;BT&quot; journalist Finn Bjørn Tønder arranged a meeting with &quot;Count Grishnackh.&quot; The journalists were summoned to an apartment and were allegedly warned they would be shot if they called the police. There, Vikernes and his companions told the journalists that they had burned the churches or knew who had done it and warned that the attacks would continue. They claimed to be devil worshippers and stated, &quot;Our intention is to spread fear and evil.&quot;

They provided the journalists with details about the arsons that had not yet been released to the press, prompting &quot;BT&quot; to consult with the police before publication, who confirmed these details. The article was published on 20 January as the front page of &quot;BT&quot;, headlined (&quot;We set the churches on fire&quot;), and included a photo of Vikernes, his face mostly obscured, holding two large knives. However, by the time the article was printed, Vikernes had already been arrested. The police allegedly tracked him down by visiting an address listed on a Burzum flyer, although Vikernes believes that Tønder betrayed him.

According to Vikernes, the anonymous interview was orchestrated by him and Euronymous with the aim of spreading fear, promoting black metal, and attracting more customers to Helvete. Vikernes remarked on the interview, &quot;I exaggerated a lot and when the journalist left we... had a good laugh, because he didn&#x27;t seem to understand that I was pulling his leg.&quot; He added that the interview disclosed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime. Vikernes claims that, after his arrest, &quot;the journalist edited the interview and... published an insane version of it the following day, without even letting me read through it.&quot; Some other members of the scene were also arrested and questioned, but all were released due to a lack of evidence.

Euronymous decided to close Helvete as it began to attract the attention of the police and media. Vikernes criticized Euronymous for shutting down the shop instead of capitalizing on the publicity, stating, &quot;by doing so he also made all my efforts more or less pointless. I spent six weeks in custody because of that.&quot; Norwegian magazine &quot;Rock Furore&quot; published an interview with Vikernes in February 1993. In it, he commented on the prison system, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s much too nice here. It&#x27;s not hell at all. In this country prisoners get a bed, toilet, and shower. It&#x27;s completely ridiculous. I asked the police to throw me in a real dungeon, and also encouraged them to use violence.&quot; He was released in March due to a lack of evidence.

Shortly after this incident, the Oslo police dispatched its Church Fire Group to Bergen, establishing a makeshift headquarters in the Hotel Norge. According to &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;, citing a police report, Vikernes knocked on their door and &quot;virtually forced his way into the suite.&quot; He was &quot;dressed in chain mail, carrying two large knives in his belt, and flanked by two young men who apparently behaved as if they were his bodyguards or henchmen.&quot; Vikernes &quot;stated that he was fed up with being harassed by the authorities, and that the police investigation into the Black Metal scene should be stopped.&quot; When police informed him that he had no right to issue orders, Vikernes &quot;took one step back and raised his right arm in a Roman salute.&quot;

== Murder of Euronymous ==
In early 1993, tensions escalated between Euronymous and Vikernes. On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes and Snorre &#x27;Blackthorn&#x27; Ruch traveled from Bergen to Euronymous&#x27; apartment in Oslo. Upon their arrival, a confrontation ensued, during which Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous. His body was discovered outside the apartment, bearing 23 stab wounds—two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back.

Speculation surrounding the murder suggests it stemmed from a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt to &quot;outdo&quot; a previous stabbing incident in Lillehammer. Vikernes, however, refutes these claims, asserting he killed Euronymous in self-defense. He contends that Euronymous had devised a plan to incapacitate him with an electroshock weapon, bind him, and torture him to death while filming the event, using a meeting regarding an unsigned contract as a ruse to ambush him. Vikernes claims he intended to present Euronymous with the signed contract that night and &quot;tell him to fuck off,&quot; but that Euronymous panicked and attacked him first. Faust has expressed skepticism regarding the self-defense narrative, while Necrobutcher believes Vikernes killed Euronymous due to the death threats he had received from him. Necrobutcher later claimed that he had also intended to murder Euronymous himself due to his tasteless exploitation of Dead&#x27;s suicide.

Vikernes was apprehended on 19 August 1993, and many other individuals within the scene were questioned around the same time. Some confessed to their crimes and implicated others. In May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway&#x27;s maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of four churches, and possession of 150 kg of explosives. Two churches were set ablaze on the day he was sentenced, &quot;presumably as a statement of symbolic support.&quot; Blackthorn received an eight-year prison sentence for his role as an accomplice in the murder. That month saw the release of the Mayhem album &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot;, featuring Euronymous on guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar. Euronymous&#x27;s family had requested that Mayhem&#x27;s drummer, Hellhammer, remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes, but Hellhammer stated, &quot;I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record.&quot; Vikernes was released from prison in 2009.

== Conflict with other music scenes ==
A strong rivalry existed between the Norwegian black metal and Swedish death metal scenes. Fenriz and Tchort noted that Norwegian black metal musicians had become &quot;fed up with the whole death metal scene&quot; and that &quot;death metal was very uncool in Oslo&quot; at that time. On multiple occasions, Euronymous sent death threats to some of the more &#x27;mainstream&#x27; death metal bands in Europe. Allegedly, a group of Norwegian black metal fans even plotted to kidnap and murder certain Swedish death metal musicians.

Rivalry also emerged between Norwegian and Finnish black metal bands. Impaled Nazarene printed &quot;No orders from Norway accepted&quot; and &quot;&quot; (&quot;Death to the arseholes of Norway!&quot;) on early pressings of their first album, while innuendos and snarky comments were exchanged in fanzines. Beherit&#x27;s vocalist, Nuclear Holocausto, utilized the rivalry to execute a series of telephone pranks on Mika Luttinen (of Impaled Nazarene), during which he would call him in the dead of night and play nursery rhymes at high speed on a cassette recorder. At that time, Luttinen claimed that the messages were threats from Norwegian black metallers. The Finnish band Black Crucifixion criticized the Norwegian band Darkthrone as &quot;trendies&quot; because Darkthrone had originally been a death metal band before transitioning to black metal.

<text>Walter Edward Washington (April 15, 1915 – October 27, 2003) was an American civil servant and politician. After a career in public housing, Washington was the chief executive of the District of Columbia from 1967 to 1979, serving as the first and only Mayor-Commissioner of the District of Columbia from 1967 to 1974, and as the first Mayor of the District of Columbia from 1975 to 1979.

He was the first African-American mayor of a major city in the United States, and in 1974 became the capital&#x27;s first popularly elected mayor since 1871. Congress had passed a law granting home rule to the capital, while reserving some authorities. Washington won the first mayoral election in 1974, and served from 1975 until 1979.

==Early life and family==
Washington was the great-grandson of enslaved Americans. He was born in Dawson, Georgia. His family moved North in the Great Migration, and Washington was raised in Jamestown, New York, attending public schools. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Howard University and a law degree from Howard University School of Law. He was a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity.

Washington married Bennetta Bullock, an educator. They had one daughter together, Bennetta Jules-Rosette, who became a sociologist. His wife Bennetta Washington became a director of the Women&#x27;s Job Corps, and First Lady of the District of Columbia when he was mayor. She died in 1991.

==Career==
After graduating from Howard in 1948, Washington was hired as a supervisor for D.C.&#x27;s Alley Dwelling Authority. He worked for the authority until 1961, when he was appointed by President John F. Kennedy as the Executive Director of the National Capital Housing Authority. This was the housing department of the District of Columbia, which was then administered by Congress. In 1966 Washington moved to New York City to head the much larger Housing Authority there in the administration of Mayor John Lindsay.

==Mayor of the District of Columbia==
===1967-1975: Mayor-Commissioner===
In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson used his reorganization power under Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 to replace the three-commissioner government that had run the capital since 1871 under congressional supervision. Johnson implemented a more modern government headed by a single commissioner, assistant commissioner, and a nine-member city council, all appointed by the president. Johnson appointed Washington Commissioner, which by this time had been informally retitled as &quot;Mayor-Commissioner.&quot; (Power brokers such as Katharine Graham, publisher of the &quot;Washington Post,&quot; had supported white lawyer Edward Bennett Williams.) Washington was the first African-American mayor of a major American city, and one of three blacks in 1967 chosen to lead major cities. Richard Hatcher of Gary, Indiana, and Carl Stokes of Cleveland were elected that year.

Washington inherited a city that was torn by racial divisions, and also had to deal with conservative congressional hostility following passage of major civil rights legislation. When he sent his first budget to Congress in late 1967, Democratic Representative John L. McMillan, chair of the House Committee on the District of Columbia, responded by having a truckload of watermelons delivered to Washington&#x27;s office.

In April 1968, Washington faced riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Although reportedly urged by FBI director J. Edgar Hoover to shoot rioters, Washington refused. He later told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1999, &quot;I walked by myself through the city and urged angry young people to go home. I asked them to help the people who had been burned out.&quot; Only one person refused to listen to him. His actions are credited with helping prevent large-scale riots in the area.

Republican President Richard Nixon retained Washington after being elected as president in 1968.

In 1971, the United States Department of Justice prohibited an anti-Vietnam demonstration on Pennsylvania Avenue. There were public concerns that violence would spark. Washington visited the White House, and he requested that President Nixon issue permits for the demonstration. The request was honored, and the demonstration commenced with 250,000 marchers.

===1975-1979: Elected Mayor===
Congress enacted the District of Columbia Self-Rule and Governmental Reorganization Act on December 24, 1973, providing for an elected mayor and city council. In early 1974, Washington began a vigorous campaign to win the Democratic nomination for the mayoral election. As Washington was heavily Democratic and (at the time) majority black, it was taken for granted that whoever won the Democratic primary would become the city&#x27;s first popularly-elected mayor since 1871. 

Washington faced six challengers in the Democratic primary. However, the primary eventually became a two-way contest between Washington and Clifford Alexander, future Army Secretary. Washington won the tight race by 4,000 votes. As expected, he won the November general election with a large majority. Home rule took effect when Washington and the newly elected council–the city&#x27;s first popularly-elected government in over a century–were sworn into office January 2, 1975. Washington was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.

Although personally beloved by residents, some who nicknamed him &quot;Uncle Walter,&quot; Washington slowly found himself overcome by the problems of managing what was the equivalent of a combination state and city government. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; opined that he lacked &quot;command presence.&quot; Council chair Sterling Tucker, who wanted to be Mayor, suggested that the problems in the city were because of Washington&#x27;s inability to manage city services. Council Member Marion Barry, another rival, accused him of &quot;bumbling and bungling in an inefficiently run city government.&quot; Washington was also constrained by the fact that then as now, the Constitution vested Congress with ultimate authority over the District. Congress thus retained veto power over acts passed by the council, and many matters were subject to council approval.

The &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; noted that Washington&#x27;s &quot;gentle ways did not move the city&#x27;s bureaucracy. Neither did it satisfy the black voters&#x27; yearning to see the city run by blacks for blacks. Walter Washington was black, but many blacks were suspicious that he was still too tied to the mostly white power structure that had run the city when he was a commissioner.&quot; During his administration he started many new initiatives, for example, the Office of Latino Affairs of the District of Columbia.

In the 1978 Democratic mayoral primary, Washington finished third behind Barry and Tucker. He left office on January 2, 1979. Upon his departure from office, he announced that the city had posted a $41 million budget surplus, based on the Federal government&#x27;s cash accounting system. When Barry took office, he shifted city finances to the more common accrual system, and he announced that under this system, the city actually had a $284 million deficit.

==Later life==
After ending his term as mayor, Washington joined the New York-based law firm of Burns, Jackson, Miller &amp; Summit, becoming a partner. He opened the firm&#x27;s Washington, D.C. office.

His first wife, Benneta, died in 1991. In 1994, he married Mary Burke Nicholas, an economist and government official. She died November 30, 2014, at age 88.

Washington went into semi-retirement in the mid-1990s. He fully retired at the end of the decade in his early eighties. Washington remained a beloved public figure in the District and was much sought after for his political commentary and advice. In 2002, he endorsed Anthony A. Williams for a second mayoral term. Washington&#x27;s endorsement carried sufficient weight to be noted by all local news outlets.

Washington died at Howard University Hospital on October 27, 2003. Hundreds of mourners came to see him lying in state at the John A. Wilson Building (City Hall), and also attended his funeral at Washington National Cathedral.

==Legacy and honors==
*13½ Street, the short alley running alongside the east side of the Wilson Building, was designated Walter E. Washington Way in his honor. 
*A new housing development in Ward 8 was named the Walter E. Washington Estates.
*In 2006, the Council of the District of Columbia named the Washington Convention Center at 801 Mt. Vernon Place NW, as the Walter E. Washington Convention Center.

<doc id="976263" wikidata="Q436546" url="?curid=976263" title="Bec Hewitt">
<text>Rebecca June Hewitt ( Cartwright; born 23 July 1983) is an Australian actress, television presenter and singer. From 1998 to 2005, Hewitt played Hayley Smith Lawson on the soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot;. As Bec Cartwright, Hewitt released an eponymous pop music album in 2002. In 2005, she married professional tennis player Lleyton Hewitt.

==Career==
Cartwright began her acting career at age 5 for television commercials. In 1992, she made her mainstream television debut on an episode of &quot;Police Rescue&quot;. She has also guest starred in &quot;Water Rats&quot; and &quot;Roar&quot;.

She won her breakout role and best-known role to date in 1998, portraying Hayley Smith Lawson on &quot;Home and Away&quot;. Cartwright became a series fan favourite and earned herself numerous Logie Award nominations until 2005. In the same year, Cartwright earned a Most Popular Actress win. She coincidentally fell pregnant within months of her &#x27;Home and Away&#x27; character, and then left the series to become a full-time mother. For a short period of time, Ella Scott Lynch replaced her as Hayley before the character departed the series in the 2005 season finale.

In 2002, Cartwright signed a recording contract with Warner Music Australia and East West Records. Her debut single &quot;All Seats Taken&quot; was released 18 November 2002 and peaked at 10 on the ARIA Music Charts. Her follow-up singles &quot;On the Borderline&quot; and &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; both failed to match the same success, both charting only the Top 30. Her self-titled debut album was released on 16 June 2003 and, despite high expectations, charted only at 21 and was certified Gold. The album was met with mixed reviews, with &quot;Smash Hits&quot; giving the album two out of five stars. In 2004, Cartwright ended her partnership with Warner Music.

Cartwright was announced as a contestant in the first season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She and her partner Michael Miziner won the first season on 23 November 2004. The couple returned in an opening performance in a dance routine during the second-season premiere.

She hosted &quot;Abba Mania&quot;, which premiered in November 2006 on Nine Network. The special was met with controversy surrounding the fact that the only celebrity performers were Nine Network personalities. Hewitt&#x27;s performance was met with largely negative reviews.

In 2018, Hewitt announced her return to television, 13 years since she left &quot;Home and Away&quot;, with the new Nine Network travel series &quot;Helloworld&quot; for the first two seasons. The series premiered on 7 October with Hewitt hosting in Episode 1 in Queensland – Hamilton Island.

==Personal life==
Cartwright was born in Sydney on 23 July 1983, the youngest child of Darrel and Michelle Cartwright. She has an older brother and sister. After a four-year relationship with fellow &quot;Home and Away&quot; co-star Beau Brady, Cartwright and Brady were briefly engaged.

Soon after the end of her engagement, Cartwright began a relationship with tennis player Lleyton Hewitt. On 5 May 2005, the couple announced they were expecting their first child. The pair married on 21 July 2005; the wedding was at the Sydney Opera House, and their reception took place at Taronga Zoo. The event attracted much media attention, with Bec and Lleyton selling exclusive coverage of the day to magazine &quot;New Idea&quot;. Fellow actresses and friends Ada Nicodemou and Kate Ritchie were bridesmaids. Commemorative stubby holders were given as gifts to all guests.

On 29 November 2005, Cartwright gave birth to a daughter at Sydney&#x27;s North Shore Private Hospital. Before her birth, a contract was made with women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; involving regular diaries from Bec and exclusive photos and interviews of the family for the first two years of Mia&#x27;s life. The couple attracted much criticism for the observation that they had effectively &quot;sold&quot; their daughter to the highest bidder. On 11 December 2008, Hewitt gave birth to a baby boy whom the couple named Cruz Lleyton Hewitt. Their third child, a daughter, Ava, was born on 19 October 2010. Her name was announced via a text message subscription service for the cost of $2, a move that attracted much criticism of Bec and Lleyton. 

In February 2009, after revelations about Hewitt&#x27;s previously unknown offshore income and bank accounts were revealed during a legal battle with his former management company, Octagon Sports Marketing, the couple relocated to a $3.8 million home at the Old Fort Bay estate in Nassau, Bahamas.

<doc id="976264" wikidata="Q6524042" url="?curid=976264" title="Leo McGarry">
<text>Leo Thomas McGarry is a fictional character of the NBC political drama series &quot;The West Wing&quot;, portrayed by American actor John Spencer. 

McGarry was the former Secretary of Labor, former White House Chief of Staff, Senior Counselor to Democratic President Josiah Bartlet, and Democratic Vice Presidential nominee for the 2006 election. The role earned Spencer the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2002.

==Creation and development==
In crafting the character of Leo McGarry, series creator Aaron Sorkin said he envisioned John Spencer in the part but did not think he would be available. Although Spencer had recently decided he did not want to act in another TV drama series because of the long hours, he was so impressed by the pilot script that he took the part. Like the character, Spencer was a recovering alcoholic, and said he found he could relate to McGarry because &quot;Leo&#x27;s in recovery, too.&quot;

In an earlier draft of the pilot script, dated February 6, 1998, McGarry is called &quot;Leo Jacobi&quot; and is described as being aged 55 and &quot;professorial&quot;.

==Character biography==
===Early life===
In &quot;The West Wing&quot;, Leo McGarry is from Chicago, Illinois. In addition, character Josh Lyman refers to a family connection of Leo&#x27;s to Boston, Massachusetts to discuss Leo&#x27;s alcoholism with him. He is of Irish and Scottish ancestry and has at least two sisters, Elizabeth and Josephine, the latter serving as a school district superintendent in Atlanta. During the first season, his wife of several decades, Jenny, divorces him due to his workaholic nature, prioritizing his job in the White House over his marriage. They share one daughter, Mallory O&#x27;Brien, a fourth-grade teacher. McGarry, a recovering alcoholic and Valium addict, comes from a family with a history of alcoholism, including his father, who committed suicide. He also speaks fluent Spanish.

McGarry is a U.S. Air Force veteran who achieved the rank of colonel and served in the Vietnam War. During the war, he flew an F-105 Thunderchief and was shot down and wounded. His friend and fellow pilot Ken O&#x27;Neill carried him on his back in the jungle for three days. Prior to working in the White House, McGarry had been Secretary of Labor during a presidency prior to the beginning of the show. McGarry amassed significant wealth during his time in the private sector as a member of the board of directors of a defense contractor, Mueller-Wright Aeronautics, with his friend Ken O&#x27;Neill, for ten or twelve years. On more than one occasion, it is made known that he is the wealthiest member of the staff - worth even more than the President himself. It is implied in the episode &quot;And It&#x27;s Surely to Their Credit&quot; (by the statement &quot;everyone in the room is a lawyer&quot;) that McGarry has a law degree. He attended the University of Michigan.

===White House Chief of Staff===
In 1997, Leo travels to New Hampshire in an attempt to persuade his old friend Governor Josiah Bartlet to run for the Democratic presidential nomination. Having persuaded Bartlet, McGarry becomes his campaign manager and general chairman of the &quot;Bartlet For America&quot; campaign, hiring Josh Lyman, Toby Ziegler, C.J. Cregg, and Sam Seaborn as advisors. Eventually, Governor Bartlet, who was considered to be an insurgent candidate by the media, defeats Senator John Hoynes of Texas for the nomination, and goes on to win the presidency, appointing McGarry as his Chief of Staff.

As President Bartlet&#x27;s top advisor, McGarry has an office adjacent to the Oval Office and sits in with the President in the Situation Room. McGarry is very involved in the formation of policy and the day-to-day operations of the White House and its staff. Some of his inspirations include &quot;Big Block of Cheese Day,&quot; where groups that would normally not be considered for White House attention get to have meetings with senior staffers, and a plan to make the staffers submit two-page reports on policy issues or get ignored. On more than one occasion, McGarry is said to be the man who &quot;runs the country&quot; and is treated with great respect by people on both sides of the aisle. When President Bartlet is giving instructions to the Cabinet member who is appointed the designated survivor during the State of the Union address, he asks the man if he has a best friend, if that friend is smarter than he is, and if he could trust that friend with his life. The Cabinet member says yes on all counts. Bartlet then says, &quot;That&#x27;s your Chief of Staff,&quot; not aware McGarry has heard him in the next room and broken into a smile, visibly moved.

In season six, during a Middle East peace negotiation at Camp David, McGarry finds it impossible to support Bartlet&#x27;s position about sending thousands of American soldiers to Jerusalem as part of an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, and Bartlet and McGarry come to an agreement that McGarry will resign at the first available opportunity. Minutes after the conversation, McGarry suffers a near-fatal heart attack and collapses while walking alone in the grounds. He is resuscitated, survives, and later returns to work after Bartlet&#x27;s last State of the Union address in a new role as Senior Counselor to the President. McGarry is succeeded as Chief of Staff by his personal recommendation, C. J. Cregg, who previously served as the White House Press Secretary.

===Senior Counselor to the President===
As Senior Counselor, Leo encourages staffers to present new ideas and resurrect old policy initiatives that have been abandoned out of political necessity, insisting that they could &quot;accomplish more in one day in the White House than in a lifetime&quot; once they leave. He maintains a board in his office that shows how many days remain for the Administration and the initiatives which have been proposed. Among these initiatives are a serious attempt at health care reform, new foreign policy approaches in Latin America, and trying to convince Congress to enact an earned income tax credit (called by Charlie Young and Annabeth Schott a &#x27;poor tax&#x27; to make it easier to defend). Leo also leads an attempt to open negotiations between the US and Cuba to lift the blockade and reestablish diplomatic relations, an issue which faces significant opposition from Republicans, Democrats, and the intelligence community. The initiative is eventually endorsed by President Bartlet in a televised address to the nation, vindicating Leo&#x27;s efforts and allowing him to accomplish what he had failed to do as Labor Secretary at a summit in 1995.

In the aftermath of Josh&#x27;s departure to run Matt Santos&#x27;s presidential campaign, Leo begins taking on some of the assignments from Josh&#x27;s portfolio at C.J.&#x27;s request. However, he points out to her that Josh&#x27;s departure has left a significant workload that requires a new Deputy White House Chief of Staff on a permanent basis. Seeing similarities with Josh, Leo champions lobbyist Cliff Calley to take over strategic planning and legislative affairs. Although C.J. is at first reluctant to hire the Republican to fill Josh&#x27;s position, Leo convinces her that Cliff is a good man who once saved him and the Bartlet administration from being humiliated. C.J. later sees the similarities herself between Cliff and Josh and convinces him to take over as his replacement.

===2006 vice presidential campaign===
Bartlet asks Leo to run the Democratic National Convention when it seems likely to deadlock. The Democratic Party&#x27;s eventual presidential nominee, Congressman Matt Santos, selects McGarry as his vice-presidential nominee, a move that both Josh and Bartlet strongly endorse. This is particularly ironic, because McGarry had earlier insisted that Santos drop out of the race for the sake of party unity to allow a less impressive candidate (Vice President Robert Russell) to take on the nod. But McGarry allows Santos to make a closing speech that was so impressive that it helped put him over the top and become the party&#x27;s presidential nominee. McGarry is not overly impressive on the campaign trail, because he is not familiar with playing the role of a candidate versus an advisor. However, he rebounds and becomes integral to the campaign, unofficially taking on the role of statesman.

In the episode &quot;Running Mates&quot;, McGarry is being prepared for the only vice-presidential debate against West Virginia Governor Ray Sullivan. The debate prep is a disaster, and the Santos campaign worries that Leo will be defeated by Sullivan. The situation worsens when the news is leaked to the press. Despite renewed efforts by Josh and Lou, they are unable to make Leo any better at debating. However, on the night of the debate, Leo not only proves his debating skills but easily wins the debate against Sullivan. Afterwards, he reveals to Annabeth that he had been the one to leak his failed debate prep news to lower expectations.

McGarry&#x27;s last screen appearance occurs in the episode &quot;The Cold&quot;. Following a private meeting between McGarry and Bartlet in the Oval Office to discuss troop deployment in Kazakhstan, a scene which exhibits the closeness of their relationship, Josh Lyman asks him: &quot;Everything okay?&quot; McGarry answers with the character&#x27;s last words on screen: &quot;Yeah.&quot;

On Election Night, it is said that McGarry has gone up to his hotel room in Houston to take a nap before the results come in. He is later found unconscious by Annabeth Schott who alerts McGarry&#x27;s Secret Service detail. He is rushed to the hospital, where he is pronounced dead. McGarry&#x27;s death comes ninety minutes before the polls close in California and other Western states, thus giving some voters this information prior to casting their vote. A hard-line Republican strategist wants to bring up McGarry&#x27;s death to benefit the Republican presidential nominee, Senator Arnold Vinick, but the visibly disgusted senator tells her that he has been friends with McGarry for decades and will do no such thing, win or lose. Despite McGarry&#x27;s death, the Santos-McGarry ticket narrowly wins the election over the Vinick-Sullivan ticket by a 30,000-vote margin in Nevada and McGarry posthumously becomes the Vice President-elect after Santos&#x27;s victory.

McGarry&#x27;s funeral is held at the Washington National Cathedral, though the funeral was actually filmed at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen in Baltimore, Maryland. President Bartlet, President-elect Matt Santos, Josh Lyman, Charlie Young, former DNC head Barry Goodwin, and McGarry&#x27;s unnamed son-in-law serve as pallbearers. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

===Relationship with staff===
He is characterized by the story he tells Josh Lyman in the second-season episode, &quot;Noël&quot;:

Spencer described his character&#x27;s relationship with Lyman as a mentoring one, with McGarry seeing Lyman as a younger version of himself: &quot;a workaholic, a person devoted to government service.&quot; He considered the world of &quot;The West Wing&quot; a boys&#x27; club at times, and felt McGarry could be harder on C. J. Cregg than he was on the male senior staffers.

Though apart from the opening credits he is not seen again onscreen, after his death McGarry&#x27;s presence is felt in the series finale when his daughter presents a gift to President Bartlet that she found in his possessions. In the show&#x27;s final scene, Bartlet opens the gift to find the napkin with the words &quot;Bartlet For America&quot;, which McGarry had written to introduce to Bartlet the idea of running for president. Also, when Josh Lyman goes to see C.J. Cregg just before the Santos inauguration during the final episode, Lyman asks if she ever stopped thinking the office of the White House Chief of Staff as McGarry&#x27;s office. Cregg replies &quot;No.&quot; She then hands Lyman (the incoming White House Chief of Staff) a note with &quot;WWLD?&quot; on it, meaning &quot;What would Leo do?&quot;

==Influence of John Spencer&#x27;s death==
McGarry appears in two of the five episodes which had been filmed, but not yet aired, at the time of Spencer&#x27;s death on December 16, 2005. The show&#x27;s producers decided to let those episodes air in his memory. The character&#x27;s death was written in response to the death of the actor, and McGarry is discovered dead offscreen in his hotel room. According to executive producer Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell, the writers originally intended for Vinick to win the election. However, the death of Spencer forced him and his colleagues to consider the emotional strain that would result from having Santos lose both his running mate and the election. It was eventually decided that the last episodes would be rescripted by John Wells. Other statements from Wells, however, have contradicted O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s claims about a previously planned Vinick victory. The script showing Santos winning was written long before the death of John Spencer. In 2008 O&#x27;Donnell stated that &quot;We actually planned at the outset for Jimmy Smits to win, that was our plan of how this was all going to work, but the Vinick character came on so strong in the show, and was so effective, it became a real contest and it became a real contest in the &quot;West Wing&quot; writers&#x27; room.&quot; Governor Eric Baker (D-Pennsylvania), played by Ed O&#x27;Neill, was written in as Leo&#x27;s vice presidential replacement, as chosen by President Santos.

In 2020, the surviving members of the cast reunited to film a special encore of &#x27;Hartsfield&#x27;s Landing&#x27; in celebration of the election and to encourage voting participation. The role of Leo McGarry was recast with Sterling K. Brown.

==Reception==
Leon Panetta, who served as White House Chief of Staff under Bill Clinton (and later as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and Secretary of Defense under Barack Obama), was impressed by the character, telling actor John Spencer that &quot;Any administration that would have Leo McGarry as a White House Chief of Staff would be very, very fortunate.&quot; John Podesta, another former White House Chief of Staff, also praised Spencer&#x27;s performance, saying, &quot;John plays this role in a calm, thoughtful, kindhearted, and loyal manner&quot; although he has commented that Leo is not mean enough.

===On the subject of alcoholism===
On the subject of the McGarry character&#x27;s portrayal of alcoholism, journalist Aiden Mason has said: The West Wing’s Leo McGarry explains addiction better than anything on TV ... I’d like to take you back to a scene from the very first season of West Wing in which Leo invites a young girl into his office to discuss an issue that many of us face: addiction. This particular scene revolves around substance abuse. If you watch closely, you’ll find it’s one of the most captivating scenes that gives one of the most accurate interpretations of the true nature of addicts and addiction itself.

Shelby Arnold said that in promoting public understanding, the Leo McGarry portrayal of alcoholism and addiction helped to weigh against some of the stigma caused by the &quot;old Reagan-era&quot; Just Say No campaign. The character showed alcoholism as a disease which was difficult to deal with, as opposed to a sin of temptation.

The &quot;Guardian&quot; takes a slightly different angle on it: [In season 3, episode 9] Leo is pushed through the wringer ... His alcoholism is explored in excruciating detail, in the present and in flashbacks where he meets Bartlet for the first time. An episode about a man with an addictive personality unravelling due to the pressures of work, released eight months after Aaron Sorkin was arrested for felony drug possession, this one feels as if it&#x27;s coming straight from the gut.

<doc id="976269" wikidata="Q3946354" url="?curid=976269" title="Sam Seaborn">
<text>Samuel Norman Seaborn is a fictional character played by Rob Lowe on the television serial drama &quot;The West Wing&quot;. From the beginning of the series in 1999 until the middle of the fourth season in 2003, he is deputy White House Communications Director in the administration of President Josiah Bartlet played by Martin Sheen. The character departed from subsequent seasons after Lowe decided to leave the series, although he returned for several episodes in the final season when he became Deputy Chief of Staff to the new president portrayed by Jimmy Smits.

Series creator Aaron Sorkin originally conceived Sam Seaborn as the main character in &quot;The West Wing&quot;. The pilot episode makes him the main protagonist and he remains a focal point through the first season. However, as other characters developed—particularly Sheen&#x27;s role as President and his ability to govern despite obstacles such as his previously undisclosed multiple sclerosis, his campaign for re-election, foreign policy, and terrorism—this greatly diminished the emphasis on the Seaborn character. When the series started, Lowe was the series&#x27; highest paid actor. However, due to the change in plot direction over subsequent seasons, many cast members negotiated or received significant pay increases as their roles expanded, while Lowe did not see any change. Unhappy with the situation, Lowe decided to leave the series in season 4.

==Casting==
The role of Sam Seaborn was initially offered to actor Bradley Whitford, who had auditioned for the part of Josh Lyman. However, Whitford wanted and was eventually given the role of Josh, and the part of Sam went to Rob Lowe, whose audition, said show creator Aaron Sorkin, &quot;left our jaws on the floor&quot;.

When the show premiered, Seaborn was considered the lead, and the pilot centered on the character. But the acclaimed cast of the show—including Allison Janney, Richard Schiff, Dulé Hill, John Spencer, Whitford, and Martin Sheen (whose role as President was initially scripted as a small role) and Stockard Channing (whose First Lady was initially scripted as a guest role)— were all strong actors and eventually Lowe&#x27;s character was no longer the lead. Lowe and series creator Aaron Sorkin soon found themselves at odds over the network&#x27;s meddling with the show, most notably the network demanding changes in the Sam Seaborn character. Eventually, Lowe left the series.

Lowe&#x27;s performance as Seaborn received a Emmy nomination, two Golden Globes nominations, three Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations and a Satellite Award win.

==Character role and development==
=== Early life and education ===
Sam grew up in Laguna Beach, California. He makes a reference to going to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; camp when he was younger in the episode &quot;The Two Bartlets&quot;. Sam graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University and Duke University School of Law. He makes repeated references to his alma mater, especially in the earlier seasons, indicating a certain pride in his attendance there. &quot;Princeton&quot; is his Secret Service code name, and he mentions being the recording secretary of the Princeton Gilbert and Sullivan Society. He can speak Spanish, as seen in Season 3 episode &quot;Ways and Means&quot;.

It is hinted in several episodes that Sam has a difficult relationship with his father and that they do not speak regularly.

Sam attended Duke Law School and was the editor of the &quot;Duke Law Review&quot; (which, in reality, is known as the &quot;Duke Law Journal&quot;). While Josh Lyman is also a lawyer, and it is implied in the episode &quot;And It&#x27;s Surely to Their Credit&quot; (by the statement &quot;everyone in the room is a lawyer&quot;) that several other senior staffers are also attorneys, Sam is the only one of these shown actually practicing law (before, during, and after serving in the White House) and is the only one who is ever consulted on legal matters.

=== Career prior to the White House ===
Sam was a staffer for several congressmen and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. He was also a practicing lawyer, working at the law firm of Dewey Ballantine in New York City before joining the fictional Gage Whitney Pace (aka &quot;Gage Whitney&quot;), reputedly the second biggest law firm in New York City. Sam worked there for seven years and was concentrating on helping an oil company with a deal that would protect them from litigation in the event of an oil spill when his &quot;old friend&quot; (though it is never made clear when or how they met) Josh Lyman comes to visit him. Josh is running John Hoynes&#x27; presidential campaign and comes to try to recruit Sam as a speechwriter. Sam declines, explaining that he is about to be made partner and is getting married soon (the engagement later fell through). Sam returns to work but, feeling guilty about the deal he is making, begins trying to convince the oil company to buy newer, better tankers than the ones they want, unleashing the wrath of his boss and jeopardising his promotion to partner. In the midst of this, Josh returns from a trip to New Hampshire during which he has seen Hoynes&#x27; dark-horse challenger, Jed Bartlet, speak to a small audience of voters. Josh has been sufficiently inspired to abandon Hoynes&#x27; campaign and go work for Bartlet, which in turn convinces Sam to do the same. Sam becomes part of the talented team of staffers who help Bartlet to a very unlikely victory in 1998.

=== Personality ===
Sam&#x27;s tragically flawed romantic relationships are something of a theme of the series with Josh once describing Sam&#x27;s love life as &quot;a moveable feast&quot;. After joining the campaign, Sam broke up with his fiancée, Lisa Sherborne, whom he was planning to marry in September of that year (the joke was that they broke up so that her name wouldn&#x27;t become Lisa Sherborne Seaborn). Sam&#x27;s other romantic relationships include a high-priced call girl named Laurie, played by Lisa Edelstein (with whom he slept without knowledge of her profession), and Leo McGarry&#x27;s daughter, Mallory O&#x27;Brien, a fourth-grade teacher — a relationship Leo jokingly tries to sabotage, telling Sam, &quot;I don&#x27;t mind you dating my &#x27;only&#x27; daughter, but you can&#x27;t expect me not to have some fun along the way.&quot;

Sam&#x27;s trademark — both his greatest strength and greatest flaw — is his unflinching idealism. His unwavering faith in and love for the American political process and the positive impact that government can have in its citizens&#x27; lives define his character. Sam believes in doing the right thing simply because it is right, even when the consequences might be politically disastrous. This often causes him to clash with the other members of the senior staff, who tend to be more practical when approaching political problems. Occasionally Sam&#x27;s idealism and faith in people are disappointed, to which he reacts very strongly. In the second-season episode &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Going to Emergency, Somebody&#x27;s Going to Jail&quot;, Sam finds out that his father has been having a 28-year affair while married to his mother, a revelation that deeply shakes his sense of what he can and cannot count on. This feeling is reinforced by his discovery that a White House staffer convicted of treason during the Cold War, who Sam has always believed was innocent, actually had been a spy.

Another trademark of Sam is his ability as a speechwriter. He is an extremely talented writer, one of the very few people Toby recognises as an equal in his field. Sam is seen in many episodes to rewrite speeches over and over, unwilling to put words in the President&#x27;s mouth that he isn&#x27;t completely satisfied with. 
=== White House ===
After the election, Sam becomes Deputy White House Communications Director in the Bartlet Administration, often collaborating with White House Communications Director Toby Ziegler to write the President&#x27;s most important public addresses, most notably States of the Union and his first inaugural address.

In an episode in the third season, Sam is awed by President Bartlet&#x27;s foresight and wisdom when resolving an apparent impasse among the Chinese, the Taiwanese and the United States. President Bartlet predicts that Sam will run for President someday and should not be scared; Bartlet believes that he can do it.

=== Run for Congress ===
During the fourth season, Sam decides to run for Congress in his home district — the California 47th in Orange County, California — in a special election held after deceased Democratic candidate Horton Wilde makes history by defeating arch-conservative Republican incumbent Chuck Webb. Sam first becomes familiar with the congressional race when he is sent to talk to Wilde&#x27;s campaign manager, Will Bailey, on behalf of the Democratic Party, to convince him to drop the campaign. Will continues running the campaign with earnestness and energy after Wilde died, an act that is seen as bizarre and pointless — or, as Sam puts it to him, &quot;a national joke&quot;. After seeing firsthand how dedicated Will is and realizing that he is a public servant in the mould of Bartlet&#x27;s own senior staff, Sam becomes impressed with how he ran Wilde&#x27;s campaign and offers his own name as a replacement candidate for election night in case Wilde wins, not thinking he will have to honor the promise. When Wilde does win, Sam decides not to back out but to use this opportunity to promote a truly liberal agenda in the traditionally conservative district. He goes to California with the blessing of Bartlet and his fellow White House staffers. Once he learns that Will Bailey is not going to stay on to manage his campaign, he recommends him as a temporary replacement for himself in the White House, to help Toby write Bartlet&#x27;s second inaugural address.

Sam is expected to lose in a landslide. President Bartlet goes to California to lend his support, taking with him Sam&#x27;s friends on the senior staff, who believe campaign manager Scott Holcomb is wasting Sam&#x27;s time by having him run a safe, timid campaign. In the midst of the visit, Sam learns that Bartlet is putting off announcing the Democratic tax plan Sam himself had helped design, so that Sam won&#x27;t feel pressured to support it and further stigmatize himself during the election. Sam is appalled and decides to put things right. While introducing the President at a campaign event, he adds that the audience shouldn&#x27;t &quot;let him off this stage&quot; until he has announced the tax plan. Backstage, Bartlet watches Scott Holcomb react with distress and asks why he is running Sam&#x27;s campaign the way he is. Holcomb admits that he is anticipating Sam&#x27;s loss and trying to smooth the way for a less divisive candidate the next time around, prompting Bartlet to (unofficially) fire him and get Toby to take over the campaign for the final weeks. Toby runs a thoroughly honest and liberal campaign, not until the very end of which does Sam realize, &quot;I&#x27;m going to lose&quot;. Toby confirms it, explaining, &quot;They&#x27;re going to throw rocks at you next week, and I wanted to be standing next to you when they did.&quot; They hug, and this is the last scene in which Sam appears until the end of the final season of the series.

When Sam does reappear, it is implied that Sam lost the election to Congressman Webb, and then declined the promotion to Senior Counselor to the President that had been suggested by Toby. Instead, he quit politics, remained in his home state of California, and joined an unnamed law firm in Los Angeles which pays him a salary that would &quot;make [Josh] puke&quot;.

===Return to the White House===
Although Sam is mentioned occasionally following his departure — most notably calling Josh to tell him to &quot;roll with the punches&quot; after the latter unwittingly caused the defection of a Democratic Senator. He is not seen in the series until the last episodes of the seventh and final season, following the election of Congressman Matt Santos as President.

In a development reminiscent of his recruitment of Sam into Josiah Bartlet&#x27;s campaign for the presidency eight years earlier(Ep 23), Josh Lyman (now Chief of Staff-designate in the incoming Santos Administration) flies to Los Angeles on a same day round trip to offer Sam the post of Deputy White House Chief of Staff. Although initially hesitant because he is again engaged, Sam ultimately agrees as he later sees that Santos is part of a bright future for the country. Sam accepts on the condition that Josh take a vacation after witnessing the toll of post-election stress, insisting that Josh will need to be at his best when helping govern the country.

Sam&#x27;s final appearance of the series comes in the final episode, meeting with new President Matt Santos and Josh Lyman in the Oval Office.

<doc id="976273" wikidata="Q5656906" url="?curid=976273" title="Josh Lyman">
<text>Joshua Lyman is a fictional character played by Bradley Whitford on the television drama series &quot;The West Wing&quot;. The role earned Whitford the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2001. For most of the series, he is White House Deputy Chief of Staff and Chief Political Advisor in the Josiah Bartlet administration.

Josh is portrayed as having one of the sharpest minds on the President&#x27;s staff; he is a witty, somewhat cocky, boyishly charming know-it-all.

==Creation and development==
Aaron Sorkin, the creator of &quot;The West Wing,&quot; originally wrote Josh Lyman with long-time friend Whitford in mind. An early draft of the pilot script, dated February 6, 1998, describes Josh as being &quot;a youthful 38&quot; and &quot;a highly regarded brain.&quot; After reading the script, Whitford said he loved the character immediately and &quot;desperately wanted&quot; the part. While his audition impressed the show&#x27;s executive producers, with Sorkin describing it as &quot;simply the best audition for anything I&#x27;d ever seen,&quot; Warner Brothers casting director John Levey was not convinced Whitford had enough sex appeal to play a lead character and executive producer Thomas Schlamme was concerned that he did not have enough depth to carry the more dramatic scenes. After a second audition, Whitford was offered the role of Sam Seaborn. Whitford called Sorkin for help. &quot;I just said, &#x27;Aaron, I just feel this very strongly. This is not about me wanting a job. This is the only time in my life I will play this card. I am this guy; I am not the other guy.&#x27;&quot; Sorkin was impressed, and soon after Whitford was cast as Josh.

In researching the role, Whitford said he found former Clinton communications director George Stephanopoulos&#x27;s book &quot;All Too Human&quot; very helpful, &quot;just because it gave a sense of the sort of smell and the texture and the level of intimacy with the president, which I was just unaware of.&quot;

Josh shares his name with a character in the Garry Trudeau cartoon strip &quot;Doonesbury&quot;, a White House deputy cabinet liaison encountered by &quot;Doonesbury&quot; regular Joanie Caucus. A framed copy of a &quot;Doonesbury&quot; strip hangs in Josh&#x27;s office. The character is said to be based in part on Rahm Emanuel, although executive producer Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell denies this claim. In the Season 1 episode, &quot;Mandatory Minimums&quot;, Josh is called &quot;Rambo&quot; by one of the staff after an intense telephone conversation. In other instances, the character is said to be based on former Clinton advisor Paul Begala who notes that some of Josh&#x27;s experiences in the first season are some of the same experiences he went through.

==Character biography==

===Personal history===
Josh was born and raised in Westport, Connecticut. A Fulbright scholar, he graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from Harvard University (where he worked at the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot;), and Yale Law School, graduating c. 1984. Josh mentions that one of his classmates was the law professor Akhil Amar. He received a 760 on the verbal section of the SAT, which he has been known to boast about. However, when trying to explain his lack of skill in serious relationships, he claims that his IQ does not &quot;break the bank,&quot; so he had to work hard in college, quipping that &quot;by the time [his] roommates notched their 100th party of the year, I think I got my first full night of sleep.&quot;

Josh is a non-practicing Jew; his grandfather was held in the Nazi concentration camp Birkenau during World War II. He had an elder sister, Joanie, who died when he was a child. She was babysitting him when a fire broke out in her home and died trying to put out the fire while Josh ran outside - an event which continues to haunt Josh. His father, Noah Lyman, was a lawyer and old friend of Leo McGarry. Although Josh thinks his father would have preferred grandchildren to a son in politics, Noah was proud that Josh was working for Bartlet and often bragged about his son to his friends and neighbors. His father died in 1998 on the night of the Illinois primary, after developing an unexpected pulmonary embolism while undergoing chemotherapy for an unspecified form of cancer. His mother splits her time between Westport and West Palm Beach, Florida, before she moves to Florida full-time.

Though idealistic like every other member of the Bartlet administration, Josh is perhaps the most willing to resort to less-than-honorable tactics and on occasion suggests solutions and methods that others in the staff would not condone. He sometimes resorts to threats, intimidation, lies and even blackmail to achieve what needs to be done for the Bartlet administration.

===Professional history===
Before working for President Josiah Bartlet, Josh worked in several positions as an advisor and manager for Democratic politicians. Josh later became a staffer for then-Senator John Hoynes, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for president in the upcoming 1998 election. However, Hoynes&#x27;s tendency to go against Josh&#x27;s advice and to prioritize politics over his own ideas and convictions frustrated Josh. Thirteen weeks before the New Hampshire primary, Josh receives a visit from Leo McGarry, an old friend of his father&#x27;s. At Leo&#x27;s request, a skeptical Josh travels to New Hampshire to hear then-Governor Bartlet speak. After hearing Bartlet give a surprisingly honest answer to a politically sensitive question, Josh immediately leaves Hoynes&#x27; campaign to work for Bartlet; he also recruits his old friend Sam Seaborn to the campaign.

Shortly after joining the Bartlet for America campaign, Josh hires recent college dropout Donna Moss, who had been volunteering for the campaign, as his assistant. Donna remains as Josh&#x27;s assistant until the sixth season. A largely unspoken friendship and romantic tension exists between the two for the majority of the series. In the first-season finale, Josh is critically wounded by gunfire during an assassination attempt on African-American presidential aide Charlie Young. Josh undergoes fourteen hours of surgery and is subsequently put through intensive psychotherapy with psychiatrist Stanley Keyworth after displaying symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, including raising his voice to President Bartlet in the Oval Office and breaking a window in his apartment.

Josh&#x27;s position in the Bartlet administration is temporarily compromised after he leaks information to the press about an anonymous hold on military promotions placed by Idaho Senator Chris Carrick. Carrick tries to secure a promise from the White House that a missile defense system will be built in his home state, but Josh&#x27;s competitive nature will not allow him to make a compromise. After the leak, Carrick releases the hold but resigns from the Democratic Party, informing Josh that he will seek re-election as a Republican and citing Josh as a key reason for his defection.

The resulting embarrassment to the administration and to the party leads Leo to leave Josh out of key budget negotiations, negotiations which eventually result in a complete shutdown of the federal government. Josh soon finds himself stripped of much of his political authority, as freelance political advisor Angela Blake takes up many of his duties. He eventually returns from isolation after the First Lady pointedly asks President Bartlet &quot;Where&#x27;s Josh?&quot; Josh is the only senior staffer to support the President&#x27;s firm stand against Speaker Jeff Haffley, and the President&#x27;s eventual political victory over Haffley during this conflict is largely due to Josh&#x27;s advice.

After John Hoynes publishes an autobiography praising Josh for his time in Hoynes&#x27; campaign and attempts to recruit Josh for another presidential run, he decides that he does not want Hoynes (or current Vice President Bob Russell) to be president, and instead convinces Texas Congressman Matt Santos to run for president, much in the same way Leo McGarry recruited Bartlet eight years earlier. Josh leaves his position at the White House to run Santos&#x27;s presidential campaign, leaving his legislative portfolio to be taken up by Clifford Calley, a move encouraged by Leo after he and later C. J. Cregg notice that Clifford&#x27;s personality and his skills are not unlike Josh. The Santos campaign initially loses the Iowa caucus, comes third in the New Hampshire primary and then goes on to win an upset victory in the California primary. Santos wins the Texas primary and the final New Jersey primary by a slim margin.

Going into the Democratic National Convention, no candidate has enough delegates to win the nomination, with delegates split among Russell, Santos, and Hoynes. At the convention, Pennsylvania Governor Eric Baker attempts an upstart campaign from the convention floor that further fractures the delegates. Ultimately Santos wins the nomination after an inspiring convention speech that was expected to be a concession, and behind-the-scenes maneuvering by President Bartlet. Josh is influential in recruiting Leo McGarry as the vice presidential nominee.

After Matt Santos is elected President of the United States in a narrow victory over Republican Senator Arnold Vinick, Josh becomes the White House Chief of Staff in the incoming Santos Administration. In his last appearance in the series, he is meeting privately with President Santos in the Oval Office.

==Relationships with other characters and with the series==

===Leo McGarry===
John Spencer, who played Leo McGarry, described his character&#x27;s relationship with Josh as a mentoring one, with Leo regarding Josh as a younger version of himself. Leo was an old friend of Josh&#x27;s father, Noah Lyman. It is this connection that Leo uses to get Josh to travel and see then Governor Bartlet speak and later to join Bartlet&#x27;s presidential campaign in the first place.

Assistant Secretary of State Albie Duncan refers to Josh as &quot;McGarry&#x27;s boy,&quot; and Bartlet believes that Josh would throw out the baby, the bath water, and the bathtub in order to avoid letting Leo down. Both show strong loyalty to one another, with Josh going to great lengths to prevent damaging details of Leo&#x27;s past drug addiction and alcoholism from being made public and Leo supporting Josh as he struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder, promising that &quot;as long as I got a job, you got a job.&quot; After Leo&#x27;s death, President Bartlet says that Leo loved Josh like a son. On one occasion, Bartlet jokingly remarks to Leo that Josh, &quot;frankly, is a lot smarter than you.&quot;

===Donna Moss===
Josh&#x27;s assistant Donna Moss, portrayed by Janel Moloney, was originally slated to be a minor recurring character; however, the chemistry between the two actors caught producers&#x27; attention early on. After seeing Moloney and Whitford perform together in the pilot, Aaron Sorkin added a scene in which Donna argues with Josh to change his shirt before attending a meeting, eventually convincing him by saying that &quot;All the girls think you look really hot in this shirt.&quot; Although Mandy Hampton was originally intended to be Josh&#x27;s romantic interest, by the end of the show&#x27;s first season the character had been written out and the role taken over by Donna.

During the first four seasons, the relationship remains in stasis, with neither daring to make any real romantic move. Sorkin admits that he was more inclined to move the relationship forward, but every time he discussed the possibility fellow executive producer Thomas Schlamme would shout, &quot;No! Wait another year!&quot; &quot;Besides&quot;, adds Sorkin, &quot;Sexual and romantic tension is, to me, much more fun than taking the tension away by having the sex and romance.&quot;

Other characters occasionally speculate on the pair&#x27;s relationship. When Donna encourages Josh to ask Joey Lucas on a date, Joey guesses that Donna is attempting to cover her own feelings for Josh through misdirection. During the same episode, Josh and Sam Seaborn discuss why Donna was so pushy about asking out Joey; Josh comments that he wonders why Donna would not be jealous. To this, Sam asks if Josh gets jealous when Donna dates. Josh says he does not but does everything in his power to stop or hinder the dates from happening. During her first meeting with Josh, Amy Gardner asks him if he is dating his assistant, and later asks Donna directly, &quot;Are you in love with Josh?&quot;, we do not see Donna&#x27;s answer. When Donna recruits Josh to help her get a date with Jack Reese, Josh&#x27;s behavior leads Jack to wonder whether he is getting &quot;in between anything&quot;.

Following Sorkin and Schlamme&#x27;s departure from the series at the end of the fourth season, the relationship takes some new turns, with Donna attempting to broaden her horizons past Josh and pursue her own social life outside of the White House. In season 5, when Donna is badly injured in a terrorist attack in Gaza, Josh rushes to keep vigil at her bedside at a military hospital in Germany. In the sixth-season episode &quot;Impact Winter,&quot; Donna quits her job as assistant to Josh, seeing no chance of career advancement. She begins working for Vice President Bob Russell&#x27;s presidential campaign. About the same time, Josh leaves his job to work on Matt Santos&#x27; campaign. This puts Donna and Josh in direct confrontation as their candidates battle each other for the Democratic nomination. Santos beats Russell for the nomination in the season 6 finale &quot;2162 Votes.&quot; Donna applies for a job in the Santos for President campaign in the Season 7 premiere &quot;The Ticket,&quot; but Josh finds himself forced to reject her as she is on record trashing his candidate while she was working for the other team. During their conversation he reveals that he misses her &quot;every day.&quot; Later, Lou Thornton hires Donna to work on the Santos campaign with Lou corralling the two into a meeting room for a quick reconciliation.

In the Season 7 episode &quot;The Cold,&quot; Josh and Donna kiss passionately as she brings him the good news that Congressman Santos has caught up to Vinick and that they are tied in the national tracking polls. Josh later apologizes, saying the kiss was &quot;inappropriate,&quot; but Donna says, &quot;It was bound to happen sometime.&quot; Donna talks to Will, who says pursuing a relationship with Josh would not be inappropriate. Later in the episode, Donna discreetly leaves the key to her hotel room on the table for Josh, but Edith Ortega notices the key before Josh can retrieve it and returns the key to Donna. In &quot;Election Day,&quot; Josh and Donna consummate their relationship, sleeping together twice, both times at her initiative. Donna gives Josh four weeks to figure out &quot;what they want from each other.&quot; She insists that if this cannot happen within four weeks, their relationship will remain in a constant state of ambiguity, which is not what Donna wants. After talking to Lou as well as his deputy-of-choice Sam Seaborn, Josh realizes that he desperately needs to take a break from work. At the end of the episode, Josh and Donna go on vacation together.

In the series finale &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; Josh and Donna wake up in bed together on the morning of Inauguration Day, ten weeks after Donna set the four-week deadline.

===Sam Seaborn===
Sam is Josh&#x27;s close friend, remarking that he &quot;love[s] Josh like a brother.&quot; After Leo recruits Josh to the campaign, Josh&#x27;s first stop is to recruit Sam (who is working, unhappily, at a law firm) to join him. As two of the youngest members of the senior staff, they occasionally get in trouble for their various schemes and incidents, usually with the best intentions. Much like the relationship between Jed Bartlet and Leo McGarry, Josh and Sam&#x27;s friendship extends far past their role as co-workers and the two are each other&#x27;s confidants on personal matters and relationship troubles. They even spend some holidays together when not going home.

After Sam leaves the White House at the end of Bartlet&#x27;s first term to run for Congress, the role of Josh&#x27;s counterpart is taken over by Toby Ziegler, although that relationship becomes frayed when Josh leaves the White House to run the presidential campaign of Matthew Santos. After Santos is elected, Josh quickly resolves to include Sam (who lost his congressional bid) by flying out to Los Angeles on a same day round trip and offering him the position of Deputy Chief of Staff. Sam is initially reluctant because he is engaged and aware of the job commitment involved but ultimately accepts, though after giving a frazzled Josh an ultimatum: get much-needed rest for a week or watch Sam return to California and never come back. Josh and Sam&#x27;s last scene shows them together in the Oval Office for the new President&#x27;s first briefing.

=== President Bartlet ===
Throughout the series, Bartlet (along with Leo) appears as a fatherly figure to Josh. Although flashbacks reveal that President Bartlet initially had trouble remembering Josh&#x27;s name and telling him apart from his other advisors, the President develops a special affection for Josh and even refers to Josh as his son in the season two finale &quot;Two Cathedrals&quot;. When Josh&#x27;s father dies, Josh books a plane trip back to Connecticut when Bartlet makes a surprise appearance at the airport terminal. Bartlet offers his condolences and asks Josh if he wants him to go to Connecticut with him, to which a visibly moved Josh says no. Josh tells Bartlet that his father was proud to have him working on the campaign, and that his father wanted Bartlet to win the election. Bartlet regards his young Deputy Chief of Staff as an integral part of the machine that makes the White House run properly; the brain behind the political strategic planning of the administration. When a powerful but difficult Hollywood studio chief threatens to cancel a critical fundraiser over an issue, he bosses Josh around in the process and later prompts an infuriated Bartlet to demand that Josh be treated with respect. When Josh tells the President he wants to leave the Bartlet administration to run the Santos campaign, he says he had never imagined having the conversation, and tells Leo that he does not &quot;know how to tell him.&quot; During the primary and general election, Josh works to keep Santos from making any comments that would put Bartlet in any form of negative light. An example of this is very early in the campaign, Bartlet gives Josh some New Hampshire dropout numbers for Santos to use when talking about education, urging Josh to have Santos say Bartlet had not done enough. Immediately after the conversation, Josh burns the numbers. After Leo&#x27;s funeral, a grieving Josh confides to Bartlet that &quot;Leo and I were supposed to be doing this together&quot; upon working under the new Santos presidency. Bartlet responds with &quot;Leo and I are the past. You are the future.&quot; Bartlet informs Josh that he can always call him if he needs advice.

=== President Santos ===
When Josh first meets then-Congressman Matt Santos he is impressed by his conviction and sees in him the same willingness to put his beliefs before political profit as he did in President Bartlet. Santos is ready to leave Washington and national politics to go back to Houston and spend more time with his family. When Josh gets caught up between offers from both major Democratic candidates for the presidential nomination in 2006, Vice President Bob Russell and former Vice President John Hoynes, he decides that he does not want to work for either of them. After a discussion with his mentor Leo McGarry, Josh discovers that he has already found his guy, Congressman Santos. He flies to Houston to pitch Santos his plan to make him President of the United States and after a few days Santos accepts by telling Josh &quot;I&#x27;m in, if you&#x27;re in with me&quot;. The two start a close relationship which appears to be complicated when they got into a number of fights—for example, in the Season 6 episode &quot;La Parabla&quot;, Josh urges Santos not to put his personal financial future at risk just to continue the campaign—but they clearly care for each other.

In &quot;The Wedding&quot;, during the general election campaign, Santos seems to be ready to fire Josh as campaign manager. At Leo&#x27;s persuasion, Santos keeps him on and ends up winning the election. In &quot;Election Day Part II&quot;, just after the final state (Nevada) is called, Santos looks at Josh across the room and thanks him, acknowledging Josh as the major architect behind his victory. Despite their close relationship, Santos has his own mind and disagrees with Josh at times due to Josh&#x27;s willingness to resort to dirty politicking. When Santos passes over Josh to run his presidential transition team, he argues that it keeps Josh from &quot;saying no&quot; to the people Josh would later have to deal with in his capacity as Santos&#x27; Chief of Staff. Santos considers Josh his top advisor (akin to Leo McGarry to Jed Bartlet) and tends to listen to Josh more often than not. For example, Santos takes his advice when Josh recommends McGarry as Santos&#x27;s running mate and when he tells Santos not to meddle in the speakership race. Another example of the connection the two have is shown when Santos begins to have concern for Josh&#x27;s well-being when Josh seems to overwork himself during the transition. Santos questions Donna Moss about Josh&#x27;s personal life and asks her whether Josh is seeing anyone or ever has any fun. When Josh decides to take a vacation, Santos remarks that he &quot;would&#x27;ve driven you to the airport myself if it didn&#x27;t require a motorcade.&quot;

In the final episode of the series Josh assumes his new position as White House Chief of Staff.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; focuses on Josh&#x27;s romantic tension with Donna Moss, Josh&#x27;s assistant. They go on to say that while Josh and Donna&#x27;s relationship was perceived as flirtatious and romantic in the time it was released, viewing the show after the Me Too movement shed a negative light on their story. &quot;The Post&quot; calls it &quot;The Donna Problem&quot; - that society and culture have moved on from what was acceptable back then, and now shows that are still well-written and produced are relics of that older time. They remark that Josh&#x27;s behavior as the boss romantically interested in his subordinate is &quot;an example of what we’re currently trying to educate men &quot;not&quot; to do in the workplace.&quot;

&quot;The Atlantic Wire&quot; ranked Josh as 17th on their list of characters in &quot;The West Wing&quot;, remarking that Lyman is &quot;inarguably the show&#x27;s most consistently dominant character&quot; and &quot;Arrogant, blustery and often tragically funny.&quot; The ranking was an average of the three writers who created that list, and while two of the writers ranked Josh Lyman as just below the main characters, a third writer ranked Josh as middle of the pack, bringing down the average. The relative public anger at the release of the list on social media, particularly of Lyman&#x27;s low ranking, prompted two of the writers to interview themselves on a separate piece. The writer who gave the bad ranking, Kevin O&#x27;Keefe, explained that he saw Josh as &quot;loud and immature... his attitude towards women – including and especially his treatment of his assistant Donna – is pretty terrible.&quot; O&#x27;Keefe also drew a parallel to Will McAvoy on another television show by Aaron Sorkin, &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, talking about a similarity in their pattern of sexual harassment. O&#x27;Keefe also mocked the internet response to his decision, saying that &quot;the defense seems to be &#x27;but it&#x27;s Josh! Josh is great!&#x27;... all the tweets and comments we got just baffled me.&quot; The writer who rated Lyman the highest, David Sims, argued that Josh is well-written regardless of his attitude, and is a central figure to the show. He also says that Josh has a complete character arc rivaled only by C. J. Cregg, and agreed that the internet response was silly by nature of those who were willing to defend Josh without clear reasoning.

&quot;Vulture&quot; ranked Josh as 7th on their list of all characters created by Aaron Sorkin, remarking that he takes his professional position quite personally. They also lauded Josh&#x27;s drive, quipping that &quot;not even a bullet could dampen his enthusiasm for governing.&quot;

<doc id="976279" wikidata="Q1345373" url="?curid=976279" title="Toby Ziegler">
<text>Tobias &quot;Toby&quot; Zachary Ziegler was a fictional character in the television serial drama &quot;The West Wing&quot;, played by Richard Schiff. The role of Toby Ziegler earned actor Richard Schiff the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2000. For most of the series&#x27; duration, he was White House Communications Director. In the final season, Ziegler was involved in a storyline around a leak of classified information, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared to the leak investigation of the Valerie Plame affair.

==Creation and development==
According to series creator Aaron Sorkin, Schiff was cast in the role of Toby Ziegler over many other actors who auditioned, including Eugene Levy. Schiff created a backstory for the character as a widower and wore his own wedding ring. Sorkin and fellow executive producer Thomas Schlamme were planning for the character to be divorced, and did not notice until the show&#x27;s eighth episode. &quot;I had always imagined that his first wife had died, which accounts for his sadness, and why someone would devote himself to public service and be so singular about it&quot;, Schiff said. &quot;But then, Aaron and Tommy threw that right out the window.&quot;

Schiff had publicly praised the show&#x27;s writers, and creator Aaron Sorkin in particular, for the characters&#x27; richness in the series. However, during the show&#x27;s final season, Schiff said he felt let down by the writers as some of his episodes were cut &quot;purely on a financial decision.&quot; He was particularly critical of the military shuttle leak storyline, which saw his character indicted for leaking classified information. &quot;Toby would never in 10 million years have betrayed the president in that fashion,&quot; Schiff said. &quot;Even if he had, there would have been seven episodes&#x27; worth of fights before he did it.&quot; He justified the story to himself by reasoning that Toby was covering for somebody else.

==Character biography==
The character is Jewish and grew up in the New York City borough of Brooklyn with an immigrant father who was a convicted member of Murder, Inc., the Jewish mafia&#x27;s enforcement arm. Before joining the Bartlet presidential campaign, Toby was a professional political operative who worked for various campaigns, including New York City Council seats, Bronx Borough President and U.S. House and Senate races.

Toby is rather morose, yet he is something of an idealist, often less willing than his colleagues and the president to compromise his political values. He is shown to be a more than formidable opponent in an argument, easily able to hold his own against even Bartlet himself. He is also known for his acerbic wit.

== Plot ==

In season 1 of The West Wing, Toby Ziegler was Communications Director and senior domestic policy advisor to President Bartlet. Season 1 began in their first year in office, detailing the teams&#x27; efforts to pass legislation despite unfavorable political circumstances and a powerless administration in the face of the opposition. Toby works with his ex-wife Andrea &quot;Andy&quot; Wyatt, a member of the House of Representatives, on criminal justice legislation. The season ends on a cliffhanger with an assassination attempt but no information on who has been hit.

=== Season 2 ===
Season 2 of The West Wing details President Bartlet&#x27;s second and third years in office. The season begins with the assassination attempt from the last episode of the prior season. After the attack, Toby is in a morose mood and eager to punish hate groups he sees as responsible for the assassination attempt. It is revealed once in the White House, Toby was rewarded for his work on the campaign, with Bartlet naming him Communications Director and senior domestic policy advisor. In episode 18, Toby argues with the President after finding out about the latter&#x27;s multiple sclerosis diagnosis. Later in the season, he reveals the news to less senior members of the team.

=== Season 3 ===
The third season covers the second half of Bartlet&#x27;s first term and begins with the news that he was seeking re-election. It is revealed that Toby&#x27;s mother has been dead for 12 years. Both he and his father mention sisters, who Toby said took him to protest rallies in the mid-1960s, as well as nieces and nephews. His younger brother, David, is a mission specialist at NASA who commits suicide after learning that he has terminal cancer. Toby also refers to a grandfather who lived to be 96 years old, but for the last 20 years of his life, &quot;thought the Habsburgs still lived in a big palace in Vienna.&quot;

=== Season 4 ===
In Season 4, the team surrounding President Bartlet deal with their second election campaign - which they win halfway through the season - on the foreign affairs front, a genocide and assassination of a foreign political leader, and the abduction of the president&#x27;s daughter. Toby&#x27;s ex-wife gave birth to their twins toward the end of the season. 

In Episode 19, Toby says that his draft number for Vietnam was not called. Toby was married to Andrea Wyatt, who serves as a congresswoman from Maryland. They divorced during the first year of the Bartlet administration after unsuccessful attempts to have children. However, toward the end of the Bartlet re-election campaign, Andy became pregnant with twins. Toby subsequently pursues a renewed relationship with Andy. After his initial proposals of marriage are rejected, and imagining that she was making him chase her, he sets about attempting to eradicate the behaviors that Andy had found irritating in the past. He forces himself to eat salads, and sells his bachelor pad, buying Andy the property she had always considered her &quot;dream house.&quot; Andy was mortified by the gesture, refusing his proposal once more and telling him that he is &quot;too sad&quot; for her. Moments later, her water breaks, and the twins—a boy and a girl—are born shortly thereafter. Huck is named for Andy&#x27;s grandfather, and Molly for Molly O&#x27;Connor, a U.S. Secret Service agent who is killed in the line of duty on the day of their birth.

=== Season 5 ===
The fifth season opens with the rescue of the kidnapped Zoey Bartlet. Before, Toby was seen to prepare two speeches, covering both the possibility of her death and her rescue. In episode 4, Toby and Will mock the Vice President, their mocking revealed as the remarks are inadvertently shown on the President&#x27;s teleprompter. 

His most notable accomplishment was &quot;fixing&quot; Social Security, the sixth year of the Bartlet administration. He thinks of it early one morning, almost resigns after it was leaked by the senator who he is persuading to break with partisan politics, but then fixes it with the help of Josh Lyman.

=== Season 6 ===
After C.J. Cregg&#x27;s promotion from Press Secretary to White House Chief of Staff, he also serves as the de facto White House Press Secretary in addition to his role as Communications Director. Toby initially has trouble facing the press in the new role and makes several gaffes, but learns to perform well with the help of new Deputy Press Secretary Annabeth Schott.

When Will Bailey leaves the president&#x27;s staff to work for the vice president, Toby interprets the move as a betrayal and develops an antagonistic attitude toward Will that never is truly fixed (they simply go from being constantly at odds to having little or nothing to do with each other, though Will was shocked and left near tears when a devastated C.J. tells him about the shuttle leak and installs him as the new Director of Communications). Similarly, when Josh leaves the White House to run a presidential campaign for Matt Santos, Toby views this as a betrayal and was extremely hostile to Josh until long after. His reaction is eventually explained by the revelation that his brother David, recently diagnosed with terminal cancer, took his own life rather than live what time he had left: &quot;He could have had years. But instead, he just dropped everything and walked away.&quot; Toby feels &quot;walking away&quot; is what Josh has also done. Josh later (successfully) moved to keep their friendship alive, and Toby kept advising Josh as he tries to get Santos elected president.

In the episode &quot;Things Fall Apart,&quot; the International Space Station develops a critical oxygen leak. With no civilian shuttles available to perform a rescue mission in time, a three-person crew finds itself trapped aboard the ISS. While the president contemplated rescue options, C.J. becomes aware of the possibility that a secret military space shuttle could be prepared in time to rescue the crew. However, this would involve revealing the shuttle&#x27;s existence, particularly as one of the ISS crew was a Russian military officer. C.J. shared her speculation with several senior White House staff, including Toby. The information is leaked to Greg Brock, a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which triggered a full-scale investigation.

=== Season 7 ===
In the episode &quot;Mr. Frost&quot;, Toby admitted to C.J. that he leaked the classified information, which estranges the two. He knew that if the military shuttle&#x27;s existence became public knowledge, the public would demand the safe return of the astronauts, which is what ultimately occurred. White House Counsel Oliver Babish debriefs Toby until his lawyer ends the interview. Toby reveals that he discussed the possible existence of the shuttle with C.J., but does not state that C.J. initiated the conversation. Toby offered his resignation to Bartlet, but Bartlet does not accept the resignation because he must dismiss Toby &quot;for cause&quot;. Babish waits with Toby before he was escorted out of the White House, saying that someone should at least thank Toby for his years of service and waited with him to soften the blow.

Toby attends Leo McGarry&#x27;s funeral, but sits in the back of the church to avoid press coverage. He was similarly unable to attend Leo&#x27;s burial at Arlington National Cemetery because of the press circus his attendance would cause. Later C.J. is at an impasse about what to do after the administration&#x27;s time ends and visits Toby. The two have a heartfelt reconciliation, with Toby advising her to take a leap of faith when C.J. finds herself at a personal and professional crossroad. Despite strong mixed emotions, Bartlet&#x27;s final official act as president is to pardon Toby and thus spare him from having to serve his prison sentence. In the episode &quot;The Ticket&quot;, a flash forward reveals that, at the time of the dedication of Bartlet&#x27;s presidential library three years later, Toby had been teaching at Columbia University. Toby had been invited to the dedication by Bartlet and it appeared they have moved on from the shuttle leak incident with Toby quietly offered to help Bartlet write his speech for the dedication. Schiff had rationalised that the leak had in fact came from Toby&#x27;s recently deceased astronaut brother, David, an idea hinted at in-show in a later scene between Toby and his ex-wife Andy; it was left hanging whether Bartlet and Ziegler&#x27;s reconciliation in the &#x27;flash forward&#x27; may have been enabled by his becoming aware of Toby having actually protected the reputation of his brother, or the passage of time since the incident simply allowed tempers to cool.

<doc id="976284" wikidata="Q1080587" url="?curid=976284" title="C. J. Cregg">
<text>Claudia Jean Cregg is a fictional character played by Allison Janney on the American television drama &quot;The West Wing&quot;. From the beginning of the series in 1999 until the sixth season in 2004, she was the White House Press Secretary in the administration of President Josiah Bartlet. After that, she serves as the president&#x27;s chief of staff until the end of the show in 2006. The character is partially inspired by real-life White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers, who worked as a consultant on the show.

Aaron Sorkin, the show&#x27;s creator, designed C.J. to be assertive and independent from the show&#x27;s men; though she is portrayed as a smart, strong, witty, and thoughtful character, she is frequently patronized and objectified by her male coworkers. She is sometimes shown as overly emotional, a trait criticized by reviewers as a misogynistic stereotype. Her onscreen romance with Danny Concannon (Timothy Busfield), a senior White House reporter, was also criticized by commentators as giving the impression she was betraying her coworkers. Initially, she is portrayed as politically inept, but she quickly becomes one of the most savvy characters on the show.

Despite C.J.&#x27;s shortcomings and surroundings, she is considered among the best characters ever written by Aaron Sorkin. The character proved to be Janney&#x27;s breakthrough role and earned her widespread critical acclaim, as well as multiple offers to enter the real-life American political realm. For her performance, she received four Primetime Emmy Awards, as well as four Screen Actors Guild Awards and four nominations for the Golden Globe Award. She reprised her role at a real-life 2016 White House press briefing, the 2017 Not the White House Correspondents&#x27; Dinner, and a 2020 special episode to benefit When We All Vote.

==Creation==
On &quot;The West Wing&quot;, C.J. Cregg is played by Allison Janney. The character is said to have been partially inspired by Dee Dee Myers, who worked as the White House Press Secretary to Bill Clinton and was a consultant to the show. &quot;West Wing&quot; creator Aaron Sorkin denied this, commenting that &quot;I&#x27;m a fiction writer. I make stuff up&quot;.

=== Casting ===

Aaron Sorkin had previously seen Janney in the 1998 film &quot;Primary Colors&quot; and was impressed by a scene in which Janney tripped down a flight of stairs. Janel Moloney tried out for the role, but she was asked to play assistant Donna Moss instead. Moloney later became a regular on the show.

The casting of C.J. Cregg was jeopardized by worries of a lack of racial diversity in the show&#x27;s original lineup. According to Sorkin, both the show&#x27;s crew and the network were concerned that every actor who had been selected so far was white. Janney, a white woman, was the favorite for the role – despite her impression that she had botched the audition. CCH Pounder, who is Guyanese, was also auditioning well. In the end, Sorkin remarked, &quot;when we closed our eyes at night we wanted Allison. So we cast Allison&quot;. Pounder later guest-starred in the season one episode &quot;Celestial Navigation&quot; as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

Janney has stated that she is not like C.J., quipping to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that &quot;C.J. is incredibly brilliant – and I am an actor who memorizes lines&quot;. She notes that politics overwhelm her, unlike her savvy and well-adapted character, and recalled that fans of the show initially expect her to behave like C.J. before discovering who she really is. Janney also remarked that she enjoyed acting in episodes that were more focused on the personal lives of the characters, noting, &quot;I&#x27;m more of a person who loves to deal with relationships and emotions&quot;.

=== Appearance ===
C.J.&#x27;s usual costume on the show was a dark pantsuit, sometimes by Calvin Klein or Armani. To convey a casual feel, a dove grey or beige blouse would be included under the pantsuit, as well as an occasional dark tank top. Another option was a skirt that fell at or past the knees. The costume was designed with more masculine effects; costume designer Lyn Paolo commented that Allison Janney&#x27;s height of allowed for a &quot;longer drape&quot;. C.J.&#x27;s height was the subject of multiple jokes on the show, including being assigned the Secret Service code name &quot;Flamingo&quot; during her time in the White House. Paolo also remarked on a podcast that the clothing was designed to not distract from the show; in one episode set in a gala, a reporter asks what C.J. is wearing. She simply replies, &quot;it&#x27;s a dress&quot;.

In the episode &quot;Isaac and Ishmael&quot;, which was produced in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, C.J. wore a piece of jewelry called the &quot;Lagos Heart of Freedom&quot;, which depicted a silver heart studded with precious gems to depict the flag of the United States. The jewelry was sent to Lyn Paolo for free by the designer&#x27;s public relations firm; the Universal Press Syndicate referred to it as &quot;fall&#x27;s No. I fashion statement&quot;.

C.J. is frequently portrayed as clumsy or even dyspraxic. In her very first scene on the show, she falls off a treadmill while attempting to answer her pager. Over the course of the show, C.J. falls into her own swimming pool, hurls a basketball through a window, falls over from recoil at a target range, and clumsily fails to cast a fishing line, while her father (who has Alzheimer&#x27;s disease) encounters no such difficulties.

== Character role and development ==
In the first six seasons of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, C.J. works as the White House Press Secretary under President Josiah Bartlet. In the sixth-season episode &quot;Liftoff&quot;, she was promoted to succeed Leo McGarry as White House Chief of Staff, following Leo&#x27;s resignation after a major heart attack. She remains chief of staff until the final episode, leaving the White House after the inauguration of President Matt Santos. She had joined Bartlet&#x27;s first presidential campaign after being fired from her job at an entertainment industry public relations firm in Beverly Hills.

Initially, C.J.&#x27;s character was poorly developed; Aaron Sorkin admitted in a companion book that C.J. was &quot;the most underwritten role of the pilot&quot;. Sorkin commented that after several episodes, it became clear to the crew that Allison Janney and her character were going to be a key part of the show. Janney appears in all 154 episodes of &quot;The West Wing&quot;. She reprised her role in a 2020 reunion special with nearly all of the original cast, termed &quot;A &quot;West Wing&quot; Special to Benefit When We All Vote&quot;.

=== Personality ===
According to Aaron Sorkin, C.J. was designed to stand out from other female characters of the era; he writes in the pilot of the &quot;West Wing Script Book&quot; that C.J.&#x27;s role is not about &quot;when is Mr. Right going to come along and save me from this?&quot; C.J.&#x27;s character was shown to be an adept, empathetic, confident, witty, and independent one with considerable depth, and the only female character portrayed as intellectually on par with the male senior staff. Patrick Webster, in his book &quot;Windows into The West Wing&quot;, attributed this partially to the acting ability of Allison Janney. C.J. also suffers from anxiety and self-doubt, as well as what &quot;Elle&quot; referred to as the &quot;standard office-gal trope&quot; of &quot;bitchiness and hysteria&quot;. A flashback from &quot;In The Shadow of Two Gunmen Part 2&quot;, the second episode of the second season, shows that C.J. is the only character to doubt whether she is qualified for the role in the Bartlet campaign she is being offered, despite her not being the only character to have a thin political résumé.

C.J. is often shown to be a more emotionally vulnerable character, and sometimes stereotyped as subject to her own feelings. Since &quot;The West Wing&quot; frequently mixes the personal lives and professional careers of its characters, this tendency has the effect of letting her feelings influence her views on policy. In the third-season episode &quot;The Women of Qumar&quot;, C.J. learns that the United States is renewing its lease on a military base there. She has a deep-seated emotional reaction to this news throughout the episode, culminating in a scene in her office with the National Security Advisor, Nancy McNally. C.J. reveals her reasoning for her opposition, telling her that &quot;they beat women, Nancy. They hate women. The only reason they keep Qumari women alive is to make more Qumari men&quot;. McNally is not swayed by this reasoning, arguing that the base is strategically pragmatic, and after C.J. unsuccessfully counters with a long-winded analogy to apartheid, she simply pleaded, &quot;they&#x27;re beating the women, Nancy!&quot; After McNally walks away, C.J. regains control of her emotions and neutrally delivers the news to the press in her briefing. Webster opined that although this scene allowed for a powerful emotional statement on the issue for the viewer, it also revealed a gender bias in the writing of C.J.&#x27;s character. Author Shawn Parry-Giles commented that scenes like these play into the stereotype in which women are portrayed as too subjective and emotional for rational, political decision-making.

=== White House press secretary ===

As White House press secretary, C.J. is the most influential and visible woman on &quot;The West Wing&quot;. However, this role still positions her as a supporting character – her job is to spin the actions and policies of the president, but she does not have a hand in shaping that policy the way the male characters do.

Initially, C.J. is portrayed as politically inept. She was shown to be clueless with respect to basic government functions, needing to be informed of the purpose of the U.S. census by Sam Seaborn in one first-season episode. She also admits elsewhere to having little understanding of White House economic policies. Her romance with White House reporter Danny Concannon also entangles with her job, causing her colleagues to distrust her; in the first-season episode &quot;Lord John Marbury&quot;, the senior staff chooses to lie to her about troop movement in an Indo-Pakistani conflict, because they thought that she was too friendly with the press, particularly Danny, and would not be able to lie from the podium. In the press briefing room, she is asked by a reporter about the troop movement, which she laughingly denies; her having to retract the statement later damages her credibility with the press. Also, in the first-season episode &quot;Mandatory Minimums&quot;, C.J. receives the staff&#x27;s blame when Danny publishes a memo from a staffer, criticizing the president&#x27;s performance. C.J. tells Danny in another episode that a relationship would damage her reputation; Shawn Parry-Giles opined that C.J. could not be involved with Danny while in the White House because the staff would see her only as the &quot;woman-as-traitor&quot; trope.

C.J. develops into a politically astute character, sometimes more so than her male counterparts. Drawing on the previous incident in &quot;Lord John Marbury&quot;, C.J. lies to the press in the first-season finale &quot;What Kind of Day Has It Been&quot;, confidently delivering the misinformation directly to Danny. In &quot;The Leadership Breakfast&quot;, C.J. correctly assesses that Toby Ziegler is ordering her to make a political mistake, which results in a congressman directly criticizing the president during a joint presidential and congressional press conference. Josh Lyman later comments to her that &quot;you had a lot of opportunities to say &#x27;I told you so&#x27; and score some points with Leo. You&#x27;re a class act&quot;. In another episode, she thwarts a general who plans to give a television interview that would embarrass the president by questioning his military authority. Though the general calls her &quot;kitten&quot; when they meet, C.J. remains calm and points out that in her background research, she noticed that he has fraudulently obtained a medal for an act of service he never performed; the general attempts to return the conversation to Bartlet, but C.J. ends the conversation, cutting him off with &quot;is there anything else, sir?&quot;

=== Romance ===
As well as her on-again-off-again romance with Danny, C.J. has another love interest throughout the third season – a secret service agent named Simon Donovan (Mark Harmon), assigned to protect her after she receives death threats. C.J. is initially resistant to Donovan&#x27;s assignment, struggling to preserve her autonomy. Over time, she falls in love with Donovan and submits to his protection; Shawn Parry-Giles argued that this transformation shows that she is treated like a &quot;prized and revered object of protection&quot; with no need or capability for autonomy. Donovan refuses to return her affection while he is assigned to her, but the threat to C.J. abates, meaning that he was no longer tasked with her protection. Just as the two are about to begin a relationship, Donovan is shot and killed while stopping a robbery at a local store.

In the final season premiere, &quot;The Ticket&quot;, a scene showing the characters &quot;three years later&quot; forecast C.J. as married to Danny with one child. This is realized in the series finale, &quot;Tomorrow&quot;; in the episode, C.J. leaves the White House, choosing to pursue a relationship with Danny instead.

=== Sexism from other characters ===
Like many female characters on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, C.J. is frequently condescended to, and even objectified by, the show&#x27;s men. In a scene from the first-season episode &quot;The Crackpots and These Women&quot;, the president and Leo look around a room full of women working in the White House, complimenting each one in a gendered manner. C.J. in particular is compared to &quot;a fifties movie star, so capable, so loving and energetic&quot;. Essayist Laura K. Garrett writes that the president&#x27;s comment makes C.J. seem like &quot;a lovable pet, not a professional woman&quot;.

In another first-season episode, &quot;Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics&quot;, the president&#x27;s senior staff predicts the results of an upcoming poll. Most staffers predicted that the president&#x27;s poll numbers would drop, or hold steady at best, but C.J. predicted a large bump. Leo, who relayed the staffers&#x27; guesses to the president, left out C.J.&#x27;s predictions; she suspected this was because she was a woman. In the end, C.J. was shown to have made the correct prediction.

In the second-season episode &quot;Bartlet&#x27;s Third State of the Union&quot;, C.J. appears on a television show to discuss the president&#x27;s State of the Union address, where she is introduced by the host as the &quot;very lovely, the very talented – Claudia Jean Cregg&quot;. The host then tells the entire room during a commercial break that C.J. is not wearing pants. In &quot;Ways and Means&quot;, C.J. is sexualized by Bruno Gianelli, manager of the president&#x27;s re-election campaign, who remarks &quot;man, you have got a killer body, you know that?&quot;

==Reception==
Reviewers have praised C.J.&#x27;s portrayal, both during and after the show&#x27;s run. Frazier Moore with the Associated Press described her in 2000 as &quot;a scrapper with an enormous heart, many fallibilities, and a gift for snappy repartee&quot;. The BBC remarked that C.J. &quot;might make the list for best chief of staff of all time, save for the fact that she&#x27;s fictional&quot;. In 2014, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; ranked C.J. highest on their list of the 144 best characters on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, writer Joe Reid commenting that &quot;her capability and combination of strength and simple compassion represented the fantasy of the Bartlet White House better than anyone&quot;. In their list of the best characters from all television serials created by Sorkin, &quot;Vulture&quot; ranked C.J. second, commenting that &quot;if all the Sorkin women were as classy, self-assured, and legitimately funny (the turkey pardon!) as C.J., we&#x27;d never have had the Sorkin woman argument in the first place&quot;.

Reviewers also lauded Janney&#x27;s performance; &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; wrote in 2001 that Janney &quot;combines comedy, drama, and political savvy&quot; in C.J., approving of her ability to alternate between wit and seriousness throughout each episode. C.J. Cregg proved to be Allison Janney&#x27;s breakthrough role. Janney&#x27;s performance was also lauded by her fellow cast members. In an interview with &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, Martin Sheen (who played President Bartlet) recounted an instance in which the cast, in a confidential, anonymous poll, unanimously agreed that Janney was &quot;the very best among us&quot;. Janney&#x27;s four Emmy awards from &quot;The West Wing&quot; outpaced every other cast member. She also received four Screen Actors Guild awards for her performance on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, and many other awards and nominations. Janney reported receiving letters of appreciation for her portrayal of C.J. from women viewers.

==Legacy==

After the show ended in 2006, Allison Janney was offered political punditry roles in several news organizations, as well as several requests to campaign for Democratic candidates. Janney declined, telling &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;you really don&#x27;t want to hire me. I&#x27;m not good in that area&quot;. In 2018, Janney remarked on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; that people often assumed that she was similar to C.J., but that the two were not alike in reality. Janney commented that &quot;it made me very shy of meeting people because I wasn&#x27;t her. I would love to be like her, she was thrilling&quot;.

On April 29, 2016, Janney made an appearance at a White House Press Briefing in place of actual Press Secretary Josh Earnest to raise awareness of opioid use disorder. Janney made humorous references to her time on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, including a joke about &quot;Josh [Earnest] getting a root canal&quot;, a reference to an episode in which Josh Lyman conducts a press briefing while C.J. recovers from an emergency root canal.

In 2017, Janney reprised her role as C.J. for the pre-taped introduction of Not the White House Correspondents&#x27; Dinner. Appearing to brief the press, C.J. answers several bad-faith questions from reporters before going on a monologue, arguing that this kind of questioning detracts from real journalism and that these kinds of reporters should not be listened to.

In 2021, C.J. Cregg became a &quot;trending topic&quot; on Twitter after the first press conference of Joe Biden&#x27;s press secretary, Jen Psaki. Psaki was compared favorably to C.J. online for her dry wit, as well as her straightforward answers, Allison Janney commenting that she was &quot;flattered&quot; by the comparison. Mary McNamara of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; criticized the comparison, commenting that although she loved C.J.&#x27;s character, the comparisons were indicative of the outgoing press secretary&#x27;s constant battles with the press being over; not Psaki&#x27;s objective merit. In 2022, &quot;Teen Vogue&quot; highlighted the comparison between C.J. and Psaki as a negative; the article criticized Psaki&#x27;s style as glib and attention seeking, attitudes expected instead from television characters like C.J.

<doc id="976291" wikidata="Q6748296" url="?curid=976291" title="Mandy Hampton">
<text>Madeline &quot;Mandy&quot; Hampton is a fictional character from the American serial drama &quot;The West Wing&quot;, portrayed by Moira Kelly. She is the White House media director during the first season of the show and the former girlfriend of Deputy White House Chief of Staff Josh Lyman, with whom she often clashes. A savvy political strategist and no-nonsense negotiator, the character is said to have been based on Mandy Grunwald, a real-life Democratic political consultant and media adviser who worked on the presidential campaigns for both Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. Moira Kelly said of her character, &quot;She&#x27;s a fighter in a difficult business and has a lot of strength.&quot;

Although Kelly was a primary cast member during the first season, Mandy is featured less frequently as the season progressed; Aaron Sorkin said early on in Season 1 that he and Kelly had agreed that the character was not working out and that she would have less of a focus because she would not be returning for Season 2.

==Storyline==
Mandy Hampton is a political consultant who left a high-paying and prestigious public relations firm to work for top politicians in the public sphere. Extremely ambitious, Mandy has a reputation as a savvy political strategist and no-nonsense negotiator. She has a bachelor&#x27;s degree in art history, a master&#x27;s degree in communications, and a Ph.D. in political science. Mandy starts out the show as an advisor to Democratic Senator Lloyd Russell, a political challenger to President Josiah Bartlet who opposes many of his policies. She is also dating the senator, which angers Deputy White House Chief of Staff Josh Lyman, who used to date her himself.

In the second episode of Season 1, &quot;Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc&quot;, Mandy leaves the employ of the senator, and stops dating him, when he defies her wishes and tables a bill in committee for which she planned to fight vigorously. As a result, she is hired as a media consultant for Bartlet, much to Josh&#x27;s chagrin. In her new capacity, she reports directly to him and to Toby Ziegler, the White House communications director.

Before leaving Russell&#x27;s employment, Mandy writes a memo to him deeply critical of Bartlet&#x27;s administration. This memo eventually becomes public, and an embarrassment for the Bartlet administration in the episode &quot;Let Bartlet Be Bartlet&quot;, leading to her being cut out of the policymaking loop for a while until the President orders his senior staff to let her out of the doghouse. In &quot;The State Dinner&quot;, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation wants to use force to take down a militia involved in a hostage situation, Mandy strongly urges the President to exhaust all peaceful solutions first, despite Josh&#x27;s advice to the contrary. Mandy argues &quot;the greatest threat to democracy&quot; is not &quot;the nuts&quot; but rather &quot;the unbridled power of the state over its citizens.&quot; However, the situation ends poorly when the hostage-takers shoot and critically injure an FBI mediator and the FBI then ends the standoff by force, making Mandy physically sickened by the events.

==Departure==
The character appeared only in the first season, and her appearances became sporadic as the episodes progressed. She departed the show without plot explanation after the first season ended. Series creator Aaron Sorkin said that the character was not working out and that the decision for Moira Kelly&#x27;s departure from the show was amicable:

The ensemble nature of the cast contributed toward making it difficult to focus adequately on the character. When the season 1 finale, &quot;What Kind of Day Has It Been&quot;, featured a cliff-hanger ending with an unknown character getting shot, many fans speculated it would be Mandy Hampton due to the character&#x27;s ongoing departure.&quot;The St. Petersburg Times&quot; quoted an unnamed &quot;West Wing&quot; writer as suggesting that actors with two-year contracts are the most likely to have been shot, which the newspaper said suggests it could be Mandy due to her pending departure. However, the newspaper also suggested that could be a red herring since it was not clear that Mandy was even present in the scene when the shots were fired. The shooting victims ultimately turned out to be Josh Lyman and President Bartlet.

Owing to Mandy&#x27;s unexplained departure, &quot;going to Mandyville&quot; became a euphemism among &quot;West Wing&quot; fans; it was used for any character being removed from a show with no justification.

Sorkin originally planned to reintroduce Mandy in the second-season episode &quot;The War at Home&quot;, as the campaign operator of junior senator and environmentalist Seth Gilette, played by Ed Begley, Jr. However, that appearance never happened.

==Themes==
Mandy Hampton has been cited in arguments that, particularly in the first season, the series placed its female characters in largely marginalized roles while the male characters occupied most of the powerful positions. They pointed out that even Mandy, who held a relatively important position as political consultant, was not predominantly featured in major storylines and departed from the show quickly. In response, authors Peter C. Rollins and John E. O&#x27;Connor, who published a book about the series, wrote, &quot;This televised representation may not be so much the result of a conscious or even unconscious bias on the part of the scriptwriters but a reflection of Washington reality.&quot; In an article for the &quot;Straits Times&quot;, writer Richard Feinberg acknowledged most of the important characters in the show were white males but pointed to &quot;very smart women&quot; characters like Mandy as evidence that the show included a fair mix.

<text>The Lenzing Group is an international group with its headquarters in Lenzing, Austria, and production sites in all major markets. Lenzing produces wood-based viscose fibers, modal fibers, lyocell fibers and filament yarn, which are used in the textile industry — in clothing, home textiles and technical textiles — as well as in the nonwovens industry. In addition, the company is active in mechanical and plant engineering. The Lenzing Group markets its products under the brand names TENCEL, VEOCEL, LENZING ECOVERO and LENZING.

== History ==
The company initially focused solely on fiber production, but it needed plastic wrappings for its fiber bales, so Lenzing Plastics was founded to produce them. The plastics division is still active, making 11.7% of total sales in 2009.

The company&#x27;s history goes back to 1892, when Emil Hamburger, an industrialist, operated a paper mill in Lenzing, Austria.

In 1935/36, the share majority was acquired by the Bunzl family and the company was affiliated to the Bunzl &amp; Biach AG circle of interests, Vienna. The company was expanded and modernized.

== Nazi era ==

After the incorporation of Austria into the German Reich in the Anschluss of 1938, Zellwolle Lenzing AG was founded in Lenzing by Thüringische Zellwolle AG, Schwarza/Saale, with Austrian industry subscribing to 50% of the share capital. At the beginning of July, construction of a new rayon factory was started in Lenzing. Production started in September 1939. The general director was the Nazi multifunctional SS brigadier Walther Schieber. The Bunzl Group was aryanized by the Oesterreichische Kontrollbank für Industrie und Handel, the Lenzinger Papierfabrik-Aktiengesellschaft, renamed Lenzinger Zellstoff- und Papierfabrik AG in 1939, was merged into the company in 1940. The merged company was renamed Lenzinger Zellwolle- und Papierfabrik Aktiengesellschaft. In order to remedy the labor shortage caused by the ongoing call-ups for military service, forced laborers were soon employed. Three camps were set up on the site of the disused Pettighofen paper mill on the Agerstrasse. The &quot;civilian labor camp&quot; (Wohnlager 505) housed people from more than 17 nations. The &quot;Russian barracks&quot; were set up for Russian prisoners of war. Finally, a detachment of the Mauthausen concentration camp was set up in order to be able to use female concentration camp prisoners. The first women arrived at Lenzing from Mauthausen on November 3, 1944, and in January 1945, the number peaked at 565 women. The camp was liberated by the 3rd U.S. Army on May 8, 1945, after Paul Le Caër informed the troops of the camp&#x27;s existence.

The planned destruction of the plant was prevented by resistance groups.

== After 1945 ==
By the end of the 1940s, the total complex of social enterprises included a wood grinding mill, a pulp and paper mill and a rayon mill in Lenzing, a sawmill in Schörfling, and a hydroelectric power plant each in Lenzing and Pettighofen. The products were cellulose, paper, groundwood pulp, lumber and Glauber&#x27;s salt (as a waste product). The number of employees at that time was over 2300 workers and salaried employees.

In 1949, the Lenzing pulp and paper mill, which had been taken over in 1940, was restituted to the previous owners of this company before 1938 (the Bunzl-Konzern Holding AG, Zug/Switzerland), which in turn incorporated it into the restored Lenzinger Zellulose- und Papierfabrik AG. At the same time, the company name was changed back to the original form Zellwolle Lenzing AG. Appropriate agreements were made to take account of the many economic interconnections that continued to exist between the social and the separated production sites.

In 1962, the company name was changed to Chemiefaser Lenzing Aktiengesellschaft in view of the planned start of production of synthetic fibers. At that time, the company&#x27;s holdings included the rayon factory, a cellulose glass factory that had been put into operation in the fall of 1951, and its own power plant. In 1964, an agreement was concluded with Courtaulds Limited, London, providing for close cooperation in the field of research, processes and production for viscose fibers. In 1965, the construction of a plant for sulfuric acid production[11] was started at Lenzing, which went into operation at the end of the same year. In 1967, a plant was built for the production of synthetic films and tapes made of polyethylene and polypropylene for the packaging industry. In 1966, Austria Faserwerke GesmbH was founded jointly with Farbwerke Hoechst AG formerly Meister Lucius &amp; Brüning, Frankfurt a. M. This company built a plant at Lenzing, which went into operation in 1967, for the production of polyester fibers with the brand name Trevira as well as converter and rupture cables made of polyethylene terephthalate according to a licensing process of Farbwerke Hoechst AG. The company was also responsible for the production of polyethylene terephthalate.

The old calcium bisulphite method was used for fiber production until 1963, when the new more eco-friendly magnesium bisulphite method was introduced. In 1975, the company established a department responsible for the environment and introduced a more &quot;green&quot; bleaching process for pulp in 1977. In 1984, the company name changed to Lenzing AG and its shares were listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange in 1986.

Lenzing Group has international branch offices in the United States and Asia (China, India, Indonesia). Its production facilities are located mainly within the European Union, with the fibers being produced in Austria, United Kingdom, the US, China, and Indonesia, and starting a production facility in Thailand by 2022, while its plastics factories are located in Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, and the US. The pulp is produced in the Czech Republic and Brazil and the engineering research is done in Lenzing, Austria which is also the largest integrated pulp and viscose fiber production site worldwide.

Total 2009 sales were EUR 1.25 billion, with a workforce of 6,021. The main fiber markets of Lenzing are Asia (52%) and Europe (39%). The majority owner of Lenzing, with 90.15% of voting rights, is B &amp; C Industrieholding GmbH along with its subsidiaries. As of 2007, the corporate group has an annual production of over 500,000 tons of fibers, over 27,000 tons of plastics, and over 80,000 tons of paper. The paper division was sold out in 2008.

In April 2015 Lenzing sold its German subsidiary Dolan, along with Kelheim and a 91-percent stake in European Carbon Fiber GmbH to WHEB Partners&#x27; Growth Fund 2 and Jan Verdenhalven. The sale price remains confidential.

Since 2022 Lenzing has been implementing a cost reduction program reducing costs by over 70 Mio. Euro.

<doc id="976295" wikidata="Q1777874" url="?curid=976295" title="Fishnet">
<text>In the field of textiles, fishnet is hosiery with an open, diamond-shaped knit; it is most often used as a material for stockings, tights, gloves or bodystockings. Fishnet is available in a multitude of colors, although it is most often sported in traditional matte black. Fishnet is commonly worn on the legs and arms by practitioners of goth and punk fashion, but is also commonly worn by the mainstream as a fashion statement. Similar to the lingerie, fishnet is generally considered to be a sexually attractive garment and is typically associated with adult entertainment. Fishnets are used mostly as a type of undergarment, and in as much as it defines curves by applying a grid close to the body it generally accentuates the wearer&#x27;s muscular definition.

A more practical use of fishnet textiles is in high performance next-to-skin apparel used in cold weather outdoor sports, including hiking, hunting, fishing, skiing, and mountaineering. In this context, fishnet is usually knitted from fibers of polypropylene, merino wool, or nylon, and offers a number of benefits over traditional densely knitted base layer apparel. These benefits are related to the presence of large void spaces in the fishnet fabric structure that trap insulating air for warmth in cool conditions, and allow for the rapid transport of moisture from the skin surface to outer layers to minimize conductive heat loss. 

== History ==
During the 1920s, fishnets emerged as a more alternative trend in the U.S. and were favored by women like showgirls, in large part due to the fact that fishnets were more revealing than typical regular stockings of the day.

Fishnets later emerged as an eminent fashion staple in the post-war pin-up and print-porn world with models like Bettie Page, Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe frequently appearing in fishnets.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the punk counterculture&#x27;s fashion aesthetic included fishnets, often worn extra torn up with huge holes on the stockings or shredded up, as a reference to BDSM subculture.

==In pop culture==
* An early (perhaps the earliest) written reference to fishnet as an erotic device can be found in the Westcar Papyrus, specifically the tale of Baufra – which is expanded in the &#x27;Wonder of Djadjaemankh&#x27;.
* Fishnet stockings are commonplace roller derby regalia.
* DC Comics features two superheroines who have incorporated fishnet stockings into their crime-fighting costume, Black Canary and Zatanna.
* &quot;Cucumber Sandwiches &amp; Fishnet Tights&quot;, a book by Margaret Walker (2006).
* The Stray Cats recorded a song entitled &quot;Fishnet Stockings&quot; on their European debut album in 1981.
* Some characters from &quot;&quot; wear undershirts made of fishnet.
*Nearly every major character in &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; is seen wearing fishnets during the film.
* In the anime and manga &quot;One Piece&quot; the surgeon of the pirate crew &quot;Thriller Bark&quot;, Dr. Hogback, wears a fishnet shirt. His character and the whole Thriller Bark are based on horror movies, so he may be based on &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; itself. Nico Robin in the Thriller Bark arc wears fishnet stockings. Kalifa of CP9 also wears fishnets. Zambai of the Franky Family wears fishnets under his armor.
*&quot;Fishnet Inc&quot; is a cast which performs live before and during the film &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; at the Naro Theater in Norfolk, Virginia. It is named after the fishnets worn in the movie.
* Morris Day recorded the song &quot;Fishnet&quot; for the album &quot;Daydreaming&quot; in 1987. The song had airplay on several urban contemporary stations and ultimately reached No. 23 on the Billboard charts during 1988. The title and/or content of the song made airplay very limited in some cities. The song was remixed for a club mix album in 1994, and Day added a live version to his &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot; album in 2004.

<doc id="976296" wikidata="Q1377684" url="?curid=976296" title="Lake Scugog">
<text>Lake Scugog is an artificially flooded lake in Scugog, Regional Municipality of Durham and the unitary city of Kawartha Lakes in central Ontario, Canada. It lies between the communities of Port Perry and Lindsay. The lake has been raised and lowered several times over its history. Though not technically part of the Kawartha lakes due to its shallow depths, it is often geographically linked to them. Its sole outflow, the Scugog River, connects to Sturgeon Lake. Lake Scugog is in the Great Lakes Basin and forms part of the Trent–Severn Waterway.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Scugog&quot; may be an Ojibwe word meaning &quot;marshy waters&quot;. However, according to &quot;Place Names of Ontario&quot; by Alan Rayburn, Scugog is a Mississauga word meaning &#x27;waves leap over a canoe&#x27; in reference, perhaps, to the flooding of the river valley, or, more likely, the quickness that waves can be whipped up in winds, owing to its shallowness.

==Geography==
With 68 km² with an average depth of 1.4 metres, Lake Scugog is amongst the largest five lakes of the Kawarthas by surface area. It is also the shallowest, alongside Mitchell Lake It is fed by the Blackstock and Cawkers Creeks and the Nonquon River, as well as by many small unnamed tributaries. The Scugog River is the only outflow from the lake, flowing into Sturgeon Lake which drains through the Trent watershed. Other communities surrounding the lake include Seagrave, Port Perry, View Lake and Caesarea. Scugog Island (whose island status is debatable due to the south-western edge being a seasonally flooded swamp) lay in the centre of the lake.

A Mississaugian Indian Reserve of about 50 residents exists on Scugog Island, and includes the Great Blue Heron Casino, amongst the many seasonal cottagers on the island and around the lake.

==Hydrology==

It is a hard-water marl-producing lake, and the lake bottom consists of deep deposits of it. This gives the lake a murky appearance in warm weather, especially during the summer. The lake is reportedly filling in with this marl by about 1 millimetre per year.

In dry summer weather, the Scugog River ceases to flow out of the lake, and its tributary streams of Mariposa Brook and East Cross Creek flow backward into the lake via the river to offset the high evaporative losses off the lake and marsh surfaces.

==History==

The lake has had a history of water level changes. Originally, it was essentially two lakes connected via a broad channel flowing through a marshy area along the north end. The lake was flooded approximately ten feet when William Purdy and his sons dammed the Scugog River at Lindsay (Upstream from the current dam and locks) in 1834 to power his grist mill. During this period of high water levels through the 1930s, today&#x27;s so-called islands of Washburn, Nonquon (now Seven Mile), Ball, Platten, and the enormous centrally located Scugog came into existence as islands. Today, these form part of the mainland, with the exception of Scugog Island, which is generally maintained as an island by man-made channels around the swampy south end of the island.

The stagnant waters of the lake caused a wave of deadly fevers in the surrounding farms, and the new lake limits quickly became very unpopular with the local residents. On one day in the summer of 1838, settlers from the countryside surrounding the lake rose up and using axes, flintlocks and pitchforks, tore the dam apart, lowering the lake once more. No charges were laid due to the general anger towards the water height by residents, and because of a deal reached between Purdy and the Board of Works of the Province of Canada, on December 18, 1843. Mr. Purdy was forced to lower the elevation to something approximating its natural maximum spring high-water level, a reduction in the height of the previous dam by about three feet. The Board of Works constructed the dam and a lock for navigation into Lake Scugog, which was completed in 1844 and included a log flume. In exchange, Purdy relinquished all claims against the damage done by residents, and maintained the dam and flume.

==Natural history==

The original body of water consisted of the upper sections of the current lake and was more ideally a shallow marsh than an actual lake.

The marshes of the lake prior to flooding were filled with wild rice stands and cranberries harvested by the native Mississaugas. The flooding of the lakes contributed greatly to their destruction.

It is surrounded by swamps and marshes which provide ideal habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife.

Lake Scugog has an array of fish, including an abundant supply of largemouth bass, walleye, crappie, musky, perch, carp, catfish, rock bass, smallmouth bass and minnows. Due to a dwindling walleye population, there is no season to catch or keep walleye. It is a renowned fishing location in southern Ontario.

==Economy==
Like many of the lakes of southern Ontario, Scugog served for a time as a vessel for transporting logs downstream to Trenton in the early nineteenth century. This resource became quickly exhausted with the rapid sawing of pine in the area. The Trent Canal (Now the Trent-Severn Waterway) was constructed through Lindsay in late 1800s to facilitate steamboat travel to Sturgeon Lake and Lake Ontario as the boats were constructed in Port Perry.

Today, the lake is a tourist area, forming the southern boundary to &quot;Cottage Country&quot;. The towns of Port Perry and Lindsay benefit from the recreational boating through the Trent-Severn Waterway by vacationers in the summer. Fishing is also a major attraction of the lake, as its shallow weed-filled bed is host to an abundance of species.

==Watershed==
A list of rivers feeding to and from the lake:
* Nonquon River - flows from the southwest (near Utica) towards Seagrave. The river empties into Lake Scugog southeast of Seagrave.
* Cawkers Creek - flow from southwest end of Port Perry southwards for 16 km
* Mariposa Brook - also known as Big Creek, Black Creek, Davidson&#x27;s Creek, and West Cross Creek begins in swamps near Manilla then flows northeast to then south past Little Britain and then east to empty into the Scugog River at Ops
* Blackstock Creek - found southeast of Lake Scugog between the Lake Scugog and East Cross Creek 
* Scugog River

==Osler Marsh==

The marsh on the lake along the Port Perry Causeway south of Port Perry, Ontario is named for Henry Smith Osler, who was one of the earlier owners of land which contains the marshes. The current marsh area covers of wetlands.

<text>Donnatella Moss is a fictional character played by Janel Moloney on the television serial drama &quot;The West Wing.&quot; During most of the series, Donna works for White House Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman as a senior assistant (or, as she jokingly calls herself in one episode, the &quot;&quot;deputy&quot; deputy chief of staff&quot;), until she quits her job to work for the presidential campaign of Bob Russell in season 6. Although all the senior staffs&#x27; assistants are continuing characters with personal backgrounds, Donna is the best defined and most often featured staff member on the assistant level, and her difficult, semi-romantic relationship with Josh is a recurring plotline throughout the show. She later works for Bob Russell&#x27;s campaign for President as a spokeswoman, taking the same job for Matt Santos&#x27;s campaign after Russell loses the primary.

== Creation and development ==
Donna was initially scripted as a minor character, having only two lines in the pilot episode. However, as Aaron Sorkin remarked, &quot;Janel turned a recurring character who has a couple of lines every once in a while into what became a weekly set piece: the Josh-Donna Scene.&quot; By the third episode, Donna&#x27;s onscreen chemistry with Josh Lyman had convinced the producers to make the opening scene feature her character engaging in back-and-forth dialogue with Josh about a message from C.J. Janel Moloney quipped in the same interview that &quot;I think I maybe quit my job after that&quot;, meaning that she would be staying with the show after that scene. Donna was still credited as a recurring character during the first season due to the uncertainty, but she appears in every episode of that season, and Janel Moloney was credited as a full cast member from the second season onward.

During the first four seasons, Donna&#x27;s relationship with Josh Lyman remains in stasis, with neither daring to make any real romantic move on the other. Aaron Sorkin admits that he was more inclined to move the relationship forward, but, every time he discussed the possibility, fellow executive producer Thomas Schlamme would shout, &quot;No! Wait another year!&quot; &quot;Besides&quot;, adds Sorkin, &quot;Sexual and romantic tension is, to me, much more fun than taking the tension away by having the sex and romance&quot;.

==Character role==
A script of the pilot episode provided by Warner Bros. to an interviewer introduces Donna as &quot;Josh’s assistant... devoted to Josh and hates admitting it.&quot; As Josh&#x27;s assistant, Donna&#x27;s role in the show consisted primarily of interactions with Josh for the first five seasons, until she quits her job to work for Bob Russell&#x27;s campaign for President on the show. Donna&#x27;s relationship with Josh was one of the ways the show could explore both sides of an issue on the show; often featuring Donna asking questions to Josh so that he can provide information to both Donna and the audience. During her time as Josh&#x27;s assistant, her flirtatious onscreen chemistry with Josh garnered attention, with The &quot;Associated Press&quot; describing Donna&#x27;s role in the show as &quot;Josh&#x27;s pokerfaced foil&quot; and &quot;mother hen.&quot; Other characters within the show occasionally speculate on the pair&#x27;s relationship; When Donna encourages Josh to ask Joey Lucas on a date, Joey guesses that Donna is attempting to cover her own feelings for Josh through misdirection. In the Season 7 episode &quot;The Cold,&quot; Josh and Donna kiss passionately as she brings him the good news that Congressman Santos has caught up to Vinick and that they are tied in the national tracking polls. In &quot;Election Day,&quot; Josh and Donna consummate their relationship, sleeping together twice, both times at her initiative. Donna gives Josh four weeks to figure out &quot;what they want from each other.&quot; In the Season 7 episode &quot;Transition,&quot; Josh attempts to recruit Sam Seaborn to be his deputy. Sam agrees on the condition that Josh takes a vacation. In one of the last scenes of the episode, Josh is joined by Donna on a plane to his vacation site. In the series finale &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; Josh and Donna wake up in bed together on the morning of Inauguration Day.

==Reaction and influence==
&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described Donna as &quot;undoubtedly one of &quot;The West Wing&quot; most indelible characters.&quot;

&quot;The Atlantic&quot; ranked Donna as 39th on their list of every character in &quot;The West Wing&quot;, describing her as &quot;Easily the most controversial of the core cast members not named &#x27;Mandy.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; focuses on Donna&#x27;s romantic tension with Josh Lyman, writing that while Josh and Donna&#x27;s relationship was perceived as positively romantic in the time it was released, viewing the show after the Me Too movement soured the story. They named it &quot;The Donna Problem&quot;–that society and culture have moved on from what was acceptable a short while ago, and that well-written shows can still be relics of that older time.

<text>Sir Simon Kirwan Donaldson (born 20 August 1957) is an English mathematician known for his work on the topology of smooth (differentiable) four-dimensional manifolds, Donaldson–Thomas theory, and his contributions to Kähler geometry. He is currently a permanent member of the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics at Stony Brook University in New York, and a Professor in Pure Mathematics at Imperial College London.

== Biography ==
Donaldson&#x27;s father was an electrical engineer in the physiology department at the University of Cambridge, and his mother earned a science degree there. Donaldson gained a BA degree in mathematics from Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1979, and in 1980 began postgraduate work at Worcester College, Oxford, at first under Nigel Hitchin and later under Michael Atiyah&#x27;s supervision. Still a postgraduate student, Donaldson proved in 1982 a result that would establish his fame. He published the result in a paper &quot;Self-dual connections and the topology of smooth 4-manifolds&quot; which appeared in 1983. In the words of Atiyah, the paper &quot;stunned the mathematical world.&quot;

Whereas Michael Freedman classified topological four-manifolds, Donaldson&#x27;s work focused on four-manifolds admitting a differentiable structure, using instantons, a particular solution to the equations of Yang–Mills gauge theory which has its origin in quantum field theory. One of Donaldson&#x27;s first results gave severe restrictions on the intersection form of a smooth four-manifold. As a consequence, a large class of the topological four-manifolds do not admit any smooth structure at all. Donaldson also derived polynomial invariants from gauge theory. These were new topological invariants sensitive to the underlying smooth structure of the four-manifold. They made it possible to deduce the existence of &quot;exotic&quot; smooth structures—certain topological four-manifolds could carry an infinite family of different smooth structures.

After gaining his DPhil degree from Oxford University in 1983, Donaldson was appointed a Junior Research Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. He spent the academic year 1983–84 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and returned to Oxford as Wallis Professor of Mathematics in 1985. After spending one year visiting Stanford University, he moved to Imperial College London in 1998 as Professor of Pure Mathematics.

In 2014, he joined the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics at Stony Brook University in New York, United States.

==Awards==
Donaldson was an invited speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1983, and a plenary speaker at the ICM in 1986, 1998, and 2018.

In 1985, Donaldson received the Junior Whitehead Prize from the London Mathematical Society. In 1994, he was awarded the Crafoord Prize in Mathematics. In February 2006, Donaldson was awarded the King Faisal International Prize for science for his work in pure mathematical theories linked to physics, which have helped in forming an understanding of the laws of matter at a subnuclear level. In April 2008, he was awarded the Nemmers Prize in Mathematics, a mathematics prize awarded by Northwestern University.

In 2009, he was awarded the Shaw Prize in Mathematics (jointly with Clifford Taubes) for their contributions to geometry in 3 and 4 dimensions.

In 2014, he was awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics &quot;for the new revolutionary invariants of 4-dimensional manifolds and for the study of the relation between stability in algebraic geometry and in global differential geometry, both for bundles and for Fano varieties.&quot;

In January 2019, he was awarded the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry (jointly with Xiuxiong Chen and Song Sun). In 2020 he received the Wolf Prize in Mathematics (jointly with Yakov Eliashberg).

In 1986, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and received a Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Berkeley. In 2010, Donaldson was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

He was knighted in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to mathematics. In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

In March 2014, he was awarded the degree &quot;Docteur Honoris Causa&quot; by Université Joseph Fourier, Grenoble. In January 2017, he was awarded the degree &quot;Doctor Honoris Causa&quot; by the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain.

==Research==
Donaldson&#x27;s work is on the application of mathematical analysis (especially the analysis of elliptic partial differential equations) to problems in geometry. The problems mainly concern gauge theory, 4-manifolds, complex differential geometry and symplectic geometry. The following theorems have been mentioned:

* The diagonalizability theorem : If the intersection form of a smooth, closed, simply connected 4-manifold is positive- or negative-definite then it is diagonalizable over the integers. This result is sometimes called Donaldson&#x27;s theorem.
* A smooth h-cobordism between simply connected 4-manifolds need not be trivial . This contrasts with the situation in higher dimensions.
* A stable holomorphic vector bundle over a non-singular projective algebraic variety admits a Hermitian–Einstein metric , proven using an inductive proof and the theory of determinant bundles and Quillen metrics.
* A non-singular, projective algebraic surface can be diffeomorphic to the connected sum of two oriented 4-manifolds only if one of them has negative-definite intersection form . This was an early application of the Donaldson invariant (or instanton invariants).
* Any compact symplectic manifold admits a symplectic Lefschetz pencil .

Donaldson&#x27;s recent work centers on a problem in complex differential geometry concerning a conjectural relationship between algebro-geometric &quot;stability&quot; conditions for smooth projective varieties and the existence of &quot;extremal&quot; Kähler metrics, typically those with constant scalar curvature (see for example cscK metric). Donaldson obtained results in the toric case of the problem (see for example ). He then solved the Kähler–Einstein case of the problem in 2012, in collaboration with Chen and Sun. This latest spectacular achievement involved a number of difficult and technical papers. The first of these was the paper of on Gromov–Hausdorff limits. The summary of the existence proof for Kähler–Einstein metrics appears in . Full details of the proofs appear in .

=== Conjecture on Fano manifolds and Veblen Prize ===

In 2019, Donaldson was awarded the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry, together with Xiuxiong Chen and Song Sun, for proving a long-standing conjecture on Fano manifolds, which states &quot;that a Fano manifold admits a Kähler–Einstein metric if and only if it is K-stable&quot;. It had been one of the most actively investigated topics in geometry since its proposal in the 1980s by Shing-Tung Yau after he proved the Calabi conjecture. It was later generalized by Gang Tian and Donaldson. The solution by Chen, Donaldson and Sun was published in the &quot;Journal of the American Mathematical Society&quot; in 2015 as a three-article series, &quot;Kähler–Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds, I, II and III&quot;.

<text>Charles Young is a fictional character played by Dulé Hill on the television serial drama &quot;The West Wing&quot;. For the majority of the series, he is the Personal Aide to President Josiah Bartlet.

==Creation and development==
The character of Charlie Young was originally to appear in the pilot, with a draft dated February 6, 1998, describing him as a &quot;fresh-faced&quot; 19-year-old who is taking a year off from Georgetown University to work as the President&#x27;s personal aide. The character was written out of later drafts, and was not introduced in the show until &quot;The West Wing&quot;″s third episode after the all-Caucasian main cast came under criticism from the NAACP. Aged 21 when he enters the White House, the character that made it into the show is slightly older than the early pilot draft called for, and has a somewhat modified history.

Actor Dulé Hill said he decided to audition for the role due to the involvement of Martin Sheen (who portrayed President Bartlet) and show creator Aaron Sorkin, whose work he admired. In preparing for the role, Hill met with his character&#x27;s real-life counterpart, Kris Engskov, then personal aide to President Bill Clinton. Hill said the experience helped him realize how important and potentially powerful the job was.

Charlie&#x27;s interracial romance with President Bartlet&#x27;s daughter sparked hate mail from some viewers, inspiring the first season&#x27;s cliffhanger in which the President and his staff are fired upon by white supremacists.

The character shares his name with that of African American historical figure Charles Young, the first African-descended American to earn the title of Colonel in the United States Army and the third to graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point.

==Character biography==
Charlie Young is introduced in the episode &quot;A Proportional Response&quot; as a young man applying at the White House personnel office for a part-time job as a messenger. He is interviewed by Deborah De LaGuardia who recommends him to Josh Lyman for another job, as the President&#x27;s personal aide. Prior to this, he had worked as a waiter at the Gramercy Club and for three summers as a golf caddy at Sandy Hook.

Charlie&#x27;s mother was a police officer in Washington, D.C., who was killed in the line of duty in June 1999. She was not supposed to be working on the night of her death, having been persuaded to switch shifts by Charlie. His father is said to be &quot;long gone,&quot; leaving Charlie to look after his younger sister Deena (later called Deanna). Charlie graduated from Theodore Roosevelt High School, a public school in D.C., but later says that he would have preferred to go to Gonzaga College High School, a Catholic school with a better academic reputation and a comparatively crime-free history. Despite achieving high grades at school, Charlie decides to put off attending college, in order to take up a job and support himself and his sister financially until Deena has finished high school. During the summer of 2001, he enrolls at Georgetown University, taking night classes while still keeping up with the demands of his job.

During season one, Charlie begins dating the President&#x27;s youngest daughter, Zoey Bartlet. Because of this, he receives death threats from white supremacist groups, and is later the target of an assassination attempt while leaving an event in Rosslyn, Virginia. While Charlie is unharmed, Josh Lyman is critically wounded, and the President, the head of the President&#x27;s Secret Service Detail and a woman in the crowd are all injured less seriously. The two are seen going out on a date once after the assassination attempt, but later break up for reasons unspecified. He develops a renewed interest in Zoey when she returns in season four with a new boyfriend and, even after receiving a Dear John email, refuses to stop pursuing her, stating that he is still in love with her. On the night of Zoey&#x27;s graduation, he hikes through the National Arboretum to dig up a bottle of champagne the two had buried three years earlier, intending to give it to her as a graduation gift. Instead, he finds Zoey waiting with the champagne, and she confesses that she is confused about him.

Charlie briefly dates Meeshel Anders, played by Gabrielle Union, during season five before learning that she will be working in the White House press room. He later asks Zoey out on a date, and they are subsequently seen sitting next to one another at Zoey&#x27;s birthday party in the East Room watching Penn and Teller allegedly burn a flag as part of a magic trick. During season six, it is confirmed that they are dating, when the President catches Charlie leaving Zoey&#x27;s room late at night. The next day, Charlie hints that he has thought about asking Zoey to marry him, but the storyline is never revisited.

At the beginning of season four, C. J. Cregg asks Charlie to become a Big Brother to Anthony Marcus, a troubled young man whose previous Big Brother, Secret Service agent Simon Donovan, has recently been killed. He declines initially until he witnesses Anthony disrespect C. J. to her face saying &quot; I don&#x27;t need a babysitter bitch are you deaf?&quot; Charlie (while walking by) turns around and slams Anthony against a wall telling him he can &quot;go to juvenile detention or meet me at Cosmo&#x27;s on Saturday the choice is yours.&quot;

Although initially quiet and subservient toward the President and his staff, as Charlie settles into his job he becomes more open with his colleagues and develops a strong rapport and close protective bond with Bartlet. Their relationship shares a greater degree of familiarity and levity not shared by any of the other staff. Bartlet demonstrates his affection for Charlie by giving him the family&#x27;s carving knife made for Bartlet&#x27;s ancestors by Paul Revere — the Bartlets having no biological son to inherit the knife — stating that it was something passed down: &quot;My father gave it to me and his father gave it to him, and now I&#x27;m giving it to you.&quot; This father-son dynamic grows stronger as the show progresses, and following the abduction of Zoey Bartlet, Charlie is the only non-family member to attend a private mass held for the Bartlets.

Charlie displays strong loyalty towards Bartlet and his colleagues, turning down an offer of legal immunity during the President&#x27;s MS scandal because he feels it would effectively be telling Bartlet that he was wrong to trust him. When a number of gunshots are fired on the White House, he bursts through security into the Oval Office to ensure Bartlet is unhurt.

After graduating from Georgetown, Charlie is forced to make good on a promise he made to the President to move on and leave his job as the President&#x27;s body man once he graduated, as Bartlet says to Charlie &quot;Let&#x27;s fatten up that résumé.&quot; Charlie finds it hard to leave the White House and begins passing his résumé around the West Wing. C. J. Cregg, the newly appointed Chief of Staff, asks Charlie to stay in the West Wing as a special aide to the Chief of Staff. A man named Curtis replaces Charlie as President Bartlet&#x27;s body man. As C. J.&#x27;s aide, Charlie begins to interact more importantly with the other members of the staff, and starts to have influence in the development of several policy initiatives. Namely, he is encouraged by Leo to fight for a proposed earned income tax credit which would help working families, a measure he calls &#x27;a poor tax&#x27; with help from Annabeth Schott.

On the last day of Bartlet&#x27;s tenure as President of the United States, Charlie reveals to President Bartlet that he has been accepted to the early admission program of Georgetown University Law Center, thanks in part to Bartlet&#x27;s letter of recommendation. Bartlet gives Charlie one final gift: a copy of the United States Constitution that Bartlet&#x27;s father had given to him when he was in high school.

==Reception==
Rica Rodman, who served in the White House press office between 1993 and 1997, says that of all the characters, Charlie is the most realistic in his relationship with the President, &quot;accurately [portraying] the typical young, obliging White House staffer.&quot; &quot;The Atlantic&quot; ranked Charlie the series&#x27; ninth best character and praised Hill&#x27;s performance, writing &quot;Hill was so good in the role—so dryly funny, sharp when he needed to be, who had great chemistry with everyone he worked alongside (particularly Sheen). And he did such an effective job reminding of us Charlie&#x27;s backstory (his mother was a cop shot in the line of duty) just by flashing a haunted look or reacting with understated but powerful emotion as he becomes a crucial part of the Bartlet family.&quot; They did criticize, however, that the character was &quot;backgrounded in later seasons&quot;, opining that &quot;the show suffers for it.&quot; A &quot;Vulture&quot; ranking of characters created by Aaron Sorkin ranked Charlie twelfth place.

For his performance in the third season, Hill received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. He was nominated alongside co-stars Richard Schiff, John Spencer, and Bradley Whitford; Spencer won the award. In addition, Hill received six consecutive nominations alongside his co-stars for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, winning in 2001 and 2002.

<doc id="976310" wikidata="Q4351879" url="?curid=976310" title="Cocaine Anonymous">
<text>Cocaine Anonymous (CA) is a twelve-step program formed in 1982 for people who seek recovery from drug addiction. It is patterned very closely after Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), although the two groups are unaffiliated. While many CA members have been addicted to cocaine, crack, speed or similar substances, CA accepts all who desire freedom from &quot;cocaine and all other mind-altering substances&quot; as members.

CA uses the book &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; as its basic text. Complementing this are the CA Storybook, &quot;Hope, Faith and Courage: Stories from the Fellowship of Cocaine Anonymous&quot;. and the AA book &quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions&quot;.

CA was formed in Los Angeles in 1982 by Tom K. who worked in the film industry and saw a number of people who had difficulty finding help from anyone knowledgeable about the special difficulties presented by cocaine addiction. 

Co-Anon (formerly CocAnon) is a program for families of cocaine users, analogous to Al-Anon for the friends and family of alcoholics.

<text>John Francis Alexander Heath-Stubbs (9 July 1918 – 26 December 2006) was an English poet and translator. He is known for verse influenced by classical myths, and for a long Arthurian poem, &quot;Artorius&quot; (1972).

==Biography and works==
Heath-Stubbs was born in Streatham, London. The family later lived in Hampstead. His parents were Francis Heath-Stubbs, a non-practising, independently wealthy solicitor, and his wife Edith Louise Sara, a concert pianist under her maiden name, Edie Marr. His boyhood was largely spent near the New Forest.

The Stubbs family were gentry from Staffordshire; Heath-Stubbs&#x27;s great-great-grandfather Joseph, a younger son, married Mary, the only child of a judge named Heath, this eventually becoming part of the family name. Heath-Stubbs stated in his autobiography &quot;Hindsights&quot; (1993), &quot;In my grandfather&#x27;s day, the last of the Heaths made us Stubbses her heirs, so long as we changed our name to Heath-Stubbs.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;according to family tradition&quot;, they were related to the pamphleteer John Stubbs, who was sentenced to the loss of his right hand by Queen Elizabeth I for his opposition to negotiations for her marriage to Francis, Duke of Anjou, and yet remained a staunch royalist. &quot;Family pride, combining with a poised self-irony&quot; marked Heath-Stubbs&#x27;s poem &quot;Epitaph&quot;, beginning, &quot;Mr Heath-Stubbs as you must understand/Came of a gentleman&#x27;s family out of Staffordshire/Of as good blood as any in England/But he was wall-eyed and his legs too spare.&quot;

Heath-Stubbs was educated at Bembridge School on the Isle of Wight and at the age of 21 entered Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he read English, finding the lectures of Nevill Coghill and C. S. Lewis particularly rewarding. He became a poetry adviser to the firm of Routledge, co-editing &quot;Eight Oxford Poets&quot; in 1941, with Sidney Keyes and Michael Meyer, and helping to edit &quot;Oxford Poetry&quot; in 1942–1943.

By that time Heath-Stubbs had recognised his homosexuality, though his love for the poet and artist Philip Rawson was returned only in the form of strong friendship. In the early 1940s, Heath-Stubbs reverted to regular Anglican worship.

Heath-Stubbs held the Gregory Fellowship of Poetry at Leeds University in 1952–1955, followed by professorships in Alexandria, Egypt in 1955–1958 and Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1960–1961, and teaching posts at the College of St Mark and St John in Chelsea in 1962–1972, and at Merton College, Oxford for twenty years from 1972. He lived for a time, in the 1950s, at Zennor in Cornwall.

Heath-Stubbs&#x27;s translations include work by Sappho, Horace, Catullus, Hafiz, Verlaine and Giacomo Leopardi. He was a central figure in British poetry in the early 1950s, editing, for example, the poetry anthology &quot;Images of Tomorrow&quot; (1953) and with David Wright the &quot;Faber Book of Twentieth Century Verse&quot;. He was elected to the RSL in 1954, awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry in 1973, and appointed OBE in 1989.

Although diagnosed with glaucoma at the age of 18, a condition he inherited from his father, he was able to read with his left eye until 1961, but was completely blind from 1978. Nonetheless, he continued to write almost to the end. A documentary film about him, entitled &quot;Ibycus: A Poem by John Heath-Stubbs&quot;, was made by the Chilean director Carlos Klein in 1997.

John Heath-Stubbs died in London on 26 December 2006, aged 88.

==Writing style==
As a Romantic poet, Heath-Stubbs&#x27;s diction was strong, yet subtle. Running through his work was a nostalgia for &quot;classicism&quot;. He was consciously literary and his work elaborately wrought rather than spontaneous, which meant his was not the kind of poetry likely to have mass appeal. However, his devotion to the craft of poetry makes his work impressive. As Edward Lucie-Smith put it, &quot;Few writers of his time had a deeper knowledge of the English language, or cared for it more devotedly.&quot;

<doc id="976322" wikidata="Q1018108" url="?curid=976322" title="The Chocolate War">
<text>The Chocolate War is a 1974 young adult novel by American writer Robert Cormier. It was adapted into a film in 1988. Although it received mixed reviews at the time of its publication, some reviewers have argued it is one of the best young adult novels of all time. Set at a fictional Catholic high school, the story depicts a secret student organization&#x27;s manipulation of the student body, which descends into cruel and ugly mob mentality against a lone, non-conforming student. Because of the novel&#x27;s language, the concept of a high school secret society using intimidation to enforce the cultural norms of the school and various characters&#x27; sexual ponderings, it has been embroiled in censorship controversies and appeared as third on the American Library Association&#x27;s list of the Top 100 Banned/Challenged Books in 2000–2009. A sequel was published in 1985 called &quot;Beyond the Chocolate War&quot;.

==Plot==
Jerry is a freshman attending an all-boys Catholic high school called Trinity while coping with depressive feelings and existential questions that stem largely from his mother&#x27;s recent death and his father&#x27;s enduring grief. Jerry quickly is recruited onto Trinity&#x27;s football team, where he meets Roland &quot;The Goober&quot; Goubert, a fellow freshman and instant friend.

Vice-principal Brother Leon has recently become acting headmaster and overextends his rising ambition by committing Trinity to selling double the previous year&#x27;s amount of chocolates during an annual fundraising event, quietly enlisting the support of Archie Costello, the genesis and leader behind The Vigils: the school&#x27;s cruelly manipulative secret society of student pranksters.

Archie arrogantly plans to alternate between betraying and supporting Leon in a frenzied series of power plays. His first &quot;assignment&quot; is to incite Jerry to refuse to sell any chocolate for 10 days. However, Jerry, inspired after reading a quotation inside his locker: &quot;Do I dare disturb the universe?&quot; from T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,&quot; feels strangely determined to sell nothing even after the ten days have passed, thus estranging himself from both Leon and The Vigils.

At first, Jerry&#x27;s refusal to cooperate with the corrupt school culture and fundraiser is seen by many classmates as heroic, but the gesture threatens Brother Leon and The Vigils&#x27; ability to coerce the student population. Leon presses Archie to put The Vigils&#x27; full force behind the chocolate sales, so they set up Jerry as an enemy for the rest of the student body to harass through bullying, prank calls, and vandalism. Only The Goober remains Jerry&#x27;s friend but does little to protect him. Ultimately, Archie enlists the school bully Emile Janza to beat up Jerry just outside the school, but, even in the aftermath, Jerry maintains his defiant nonconformity.

Finally, Archie concocts a showdown: a boxing match at night between Jerry and Emile. On the football field, the match is watched by all students, who can select which blows will be laid during the fight through a randomized lottery system; however, the fight ends when a teacher shuts down the electrical power on the field, and Jerry is brutally injured in the ensuing darkness. Half-conscious, he tells The Goober that there was no way to win and he should have just complied, conceding that it is best, after all, not to &quot;disturb the universe.&quot; Though Archie is apprehended as the mastermind of the fight, Brother Leon intervenes on his behalf and privately praises his efforts in the unprecedented success of the chocolate sales. Leon implies that next year, if he is officially made the new headmaster, he will work to preserve Archie&#x27;s power.

==Critical reception==
The book was well-received by critics. Theodore Weesner wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;&quot;The Chocolate War&quot; is masterfully structured and rich in theme; the action is well crafted, well timed, suspenseful; complex ideas develop and unfold with clarity.&quot;

Children&#x27;s Book Review Service wrote &quot;Robert Cormier has written a brilliant novel.&quot;

Cormier explained in an interview that he was &quot;interested in creating real people, dramatic situations that will keep the reader turning pages.&quot; He went on to say that although some adults dislike the book because of the topics discussed, &quot;the kids can absorb my kind of book because they know this kind of thing happens in life.&quot;

The &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; declared &quot;Mr. Cormier is almost unique in his powerful integration of the personal, political and moral&quot; and &quot;The Australian&quot; wrote that young readers &quot;recognised his vision as authentic and admired his willingness to tell things as they are&quot;. However, the book has been banned from many schools and it was one of the more challenged books of 2006, for its sexual content, strong language, and violence.

Reviewers compared the book to &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. 

==Reception==

=== Awards ===
&quot;The Chocolate War&quot; has received the following accolades:

* 1974 ALA Best Books for Young Adults
* 1974 New York Times Notable Books of the Year
*1979 Lewis Carroll Shelf Award

=== Challenges ===
According to the American Library Association, &quot;The Chocolate War&quot; has frequently been banned and challenged in the United States over concerns about the book&#x27;s sexual content, offensive language, religious viewpoint and violence. The book landed on the list of the top ten most banned and challenged books in 2001 (3), 2002 (3), 2004 (1), 2005 (4), 2006 (10), 2007 (2), and 2009 (10). as well as the top 100 books from 2000 to 2009 (3). When the book reached the number one spot in 2004, it marked the first time in five years in which the Harry Potter series did not top the list.

==Film adaptation==
&quot;The Chocolate War&quot; inspired the 1988 film of the same name, directed by Keith Gordon. It starred John Glover, Wallace Langham, Ilan Mitchell-Smith, Jenny Wright, Adam Baldwin, and Corey Gunnestad.

<text>The Rosenbauer Group is the world’s third largest manufacturers of fire-service vehicles and firefighting equipment, based in Leonding, Austria.

Rosenbauer supplies the fire fighting sector in over 100 countries with a wide range of custom fire and rescue apparatus and services. It produces its extensive series of fire fighting vehicles and aerials in three continents, to both European and US standards.

==History==

===Founding and development===

The first Austria-wide firefighting enterprise was founded by Johann Rosenbauer in Linz in 1866. Beside manual fire pumps from different manufacturers, helmets, buttons and so on, the company was also selling equipment for fencing, sports and playgrounds. Konrad Rosenbauer took over the company in 1888, a turning point from which it would manufacture its own fire extinguishing equipment. After moving to a larger site, the company traded its name for &quot;K. Rosenbauer &amp; Kneitschel, Fabrik für Lösch- und Wehrgerät und Metallwaren&quot;.

In 1908, Rosenbauer started producing gas-powered pumps. The first fire truck was built 1918. In 1926, the new &quot;Automobilspritzengesellschaft Lohner &amp; Rosenbauer&quot; shipped its first vehicle to China. From 1930 onward, Rosenbauer was also able to produce its own two-stroke engines (today, engines are provided by others, notably BMW and Volkswagen).

The company had a production site in Iran, until the fall of the Shah.

Since the 1970s, Rosenbauer has collaborated with Carvatech, for the manufacture of firefighting vehicle bodies.

In the middle of the 1980s, Rosenbauer introduced the Falcon, a vehicle which had a chassis developed especially for firefighting vehicles. The Falcon, with many custom and unproven parts, was prone to failures and long down-time, dooming custom chassis apparatuses to failure in Europe.

===Recent times===

Rosenbauer International AG has been listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange since 1994.

2010, Rosenbauer had over 2,000 employees worldwide and turnover was about €595 million. Over 90% of the production is exported and the company has sites in Luckenwalde, Passau, Karlsruhe, Oberglatt (Switzerland), Madrid, Lyons (Sioux Falls, South Dakota), Wyoming (Minneapolis, Minnesota) and Singapore.

The company has expanded activities to flying firefighting vehicles, water cannons for police forces and has come back on the firefighters fittings (uniforms, helmets...).

Beginning of 2011, German antitrust authorities sentenced Rosenbauer, Schlingmann GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Albert Ziegler GmbH &amp; Co. KG and Iveco Magirus Brandschutztechnik GmbH to a total of €28 million fines for cartel practices.

The Rosenbauer RT, for Revolutionary Technology, was an electric vehicle built in 2014 in Austria as a concept model. As of 2021, the electric trucks had been introduced in Berlin, Amsterdam and Dubai. The electric truck that was stationned in Amsterdam was around the end of November 2024 transferred to the Fire department located in Tiel for further testing. Vice president of sales and marketing Mark Fusco said the company would start building them in its Minnesota plant in 2023. The BMW diesel engine was used only to charge the batteries. The truck was closer to the ground, making it safer and easier for firefighters to enter and exit, though a hydraulic suspension could lift the truck if it was needed. Fusco estimated the cost at $1.1 to $1.2 million but claimed savings on fuel and maintenance would make up for the extra cost in three to five years.

==Shareholders==
As of July 2011, 51% of the company belongs to the Rosenbauer Beteiligungsverwaltungs GmbH, 5% to institutional investors and the remaining 44% is free float.

<text>Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG is a manufacturer in the paper and packaging industry, based in Vienna, Austria.
The company is 65% family owned, with the rest free-float, and is listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange (Wiener Börse).

Mayr-Melnhof packaging is a multi-national company with plants in Austria, Chile, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Iran, Jordan, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, Tunisia, Ukraine, and Vietnam.
==History==
=== Origins ===
The Mayr-Melnhof family hailed from Spielberg, Styria and was first mentioned in a written document from 1423. Industry owner, Franz Mayr (1810–1889) was ennobled in 1859 with the title &quot;Edler of Melnhof&quot;. Since then the family was styled Mayr von Melnhof.

In 1872 Franz Mayr, Edler von Melnhof, received the hereditary title of Baron in Austria for him and his legitimate male-line descendants, by Franz Joseph I. The family owned town palaces in Graz and Vienna, as well as several other castles across Austria, such as Glanegg, Kogl, Neu-Pfannberg, Jagdschloss Hochalm, which served as their country residencies. The most notable member of the family is Marianne, Princess of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn, a German socialite and a professional photographer.

=== 1950 to 1990s ===
In 1950, industrial production of cardboard commenced with the introduction of the first cardboard machine at the main mill in Frohnleiten, Styria. By 1994, the Mayr-Melnhof Group transitioned into a stock corporation and was listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange. The initial offering was priced at ATS 500, approximately EUR 35.

=== Early 2000s ===
In 2008, MM Packaging expanded its operations by acquiring 60% of Superpack, a Turkish folding cardboard manufacturer based in İzmir, which employed 120 people and operated two offset printing lines processing 8,000 tonnes of cardboard annually. However, the same year saw the closure of the Nikopol (Bulgaria) cardboard plant, incurring a liquidation cost of EUR 22.6 million.

In 2010, the Mayr-Melnhof Group (MM) closed its cartonboard mill in Deisswil near Stettlen, Switzerland, citing the emissions tax introduced in the country as the reason. However, the Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC) countered this claim, noting that the mill had been exempted from the CO2 tax since it had committed to various CO2 reduction measures in 2008. Despite producing 112,000 tonnes of cardboard in 2009, MM considered the mill non-competitive. A plan was implemented for the 255 employees affected by the closure, as MM aimed to shift focus towards other more high-performance sites.

In mid-2013, MM Karton acquired the Folla CTMP mill in Norway from Södra, which had been shut down in September 2012 due to unprofitability. MM Karton resumed production at the mill to secure an autonomous raw material supply with semi-chemical pulps (CTMP and TMP) for its own cardboard production. A portion of the mill&#x27;s annual capacity of 130,000 tonnes was also made available for free trade in the market.

Over the last decade, the main plant in Frohnleiten, Styria, has seen significant investment totaling more than 150 million euros aimed at modernising and expanding its logistics. Notably, in 2014, approximately 50 million euros were invested in developing the ‘Foodboard’ cardboard, a sustainable product designed to replace plastic packaging in the food industry.

=== 2020 to present day ===
In August 2021, MM sold its cardboard mills in Baiersbronn, Germany, and Eerbeek, Netherlands, to the US financial investor Oaktree Capital Management. Additionally, at the beginning of August, the Mayr-Melnhof Group expanded its operations by acquiring the cardboard and paper mills in Kwidzyn, Poland, and Kotkamills, Finland.

In April 2022, MM further diversified its portfolio by acquiring the Nordic pharmaceutical packaging group Eson Pac, headquartered in Veddige, Sweden. This acquisition marked a strategic expansion into the pharmaceutical packaging sector.

In October of the same year, MM continued its expansion in this sector by acquiring Essentra Packaging, a British pharmaceutical folding cardboard producer, along with its US subsidiary.

In 2020, plans were announced to invest about 100 million euros in the Frohnleiten site, focusing not only on the modernisation of the two existing carton machines, KM2 and KM3—handled by Graz-based Andritz AG—but also on enhancing the site’s infrastructure and logistics. These upgrades included modernising the boiler house and wastewater treatment plant, as well as expanding parking areas for employees and delivery traffic. The conversion work was successfully completed by mid-2023. However, due to the economic impacts stemming from the Russian war against Ukraine, which led to a decline in global market demand, the plant had to temporarily reduce its production in the summer of 2023 and shut down its cardboard machines. This situation also necessitated a reduction in the short-term profit outlook, although the modernisation measures implemented remain intact.

== MM Board &amp; Paper Production Sites ==
The production facilities of MM Board &amp; Paper are distributed across several countries including the following key locations:

* Austria:
** Frohnleiten: This is the main plant, employing 570 workers. It serves as a central hub for the company’s operations in Austria.
* Germany:
** Gernsbach
** Neuss
* Finland:
** Kotkamills in Kotka: Acquired in 2021, this facility is one of the newer additions to MM Board &amp; Paper&#x27;s portfolio, enhancing the company’s production capabilities in the Nordic region.
* Norway:
** FollaCell A.S. in Follafoss: This site adds to the company&#x27;s presence in Scandinavia.
* Poland:
** Kwidzyn: Another acquisition in 2021, this plant produces both cardboard and paper, and is part of the expansion of MM Board &amp; Paper’s operations into Eastern Europe.
* Slovenia:
** Kolicevo
*** Frohnleiten: This is the main plant, employing 570 workers. It serves as a central hub for the company’s operations in Austria.
* United Kingdom:
** Bootle, Merseyside: The Bootle plant worked closely with companies including Kellogg Company
** Deeside, Wales: the operations at Deeside focus mainly upon food and tissue, while manufacturing for companies including Georgia-Pacific and Unilever. Both UK plants run a weekday 3-shift system as well as a dedicated weekend crew. At both UK plants, the company runs mainly Bobst group machinery in the cut-and-crease and finishing department, the Bootle plant operates a fully automated end of line department. In the print department of both, machinery from Koenig &amp; Bauer is used.

<text>The mirror test—sometimes called the mark test, mirror self-recognition (MSR) test, red spot technique, or rouge test—is a behavioral technique developed in 1970 by American psychologist Gordon Gallup Jr. to determine whether an animal possesses the ability of visual self-recognition. In this test, an animal is anesthetized and then marked (e.g. paint or sticker) on an area of the body the animal normally cannot see (e.g. forehead). When the animal recovers from the anesthetic, it is given access to a mirror. If the animal then touches or investigates the mark on itself, it is taken as an indication that the animal perceives the reflected image as an image of itself, rather than of another animal.

The MSR test became the traditional method for measuring physiological and cognitive self-awareness. Very few species passed it. However, several critiques have emerged that call into question the value of Gallup&#x27;s test. Studies have challenged Gallup&#x27;s results; others have found that animals can be self-aware in ways not measured by the test, such as distinguishing between their own and others&#x27; songs and scents.

==Method and history==
The inspiration for the mirror test comes from an anecdote about Charles Darwin and a captive orangutan. While visiting the London Zoo in 1838, Darwin observed an orangutan named Jenny throwing a tantrum after being teased with an apple by her keeper. This started him thinking about the subjective experience of an orangutan. He also watched Jenny gaze into a mirror and noted the possibility that she recognized herself in the reflection.

In 1970, Gordon Gallup Jr. experimentally investigated the possibility of self-recognition with two male and two female wild preadolescent chimpanzees (&quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;), none of which had presumably seen a mirror previously. Each chimpanzee was put into a room by itself for two days. Next, a full-length mirror was placed in the room for a total of 80 hours at periodically decreasing distances. A multitude of behaviors was recorded upon introducing the mirrors to the chimpanzees. Initially, the chimpanzees made threatening gestures at their images, ostensibly seeing their reflections as threatening. Eventually, the chimps used their reflections for self-directed responding behaviors, such as grooming parts of their body previously not observed without a mirror, picking their noses, making faces, and blowing bubbles at their reflections.

Gallup expanded the study by manipulating the chimpanzees&#x27; appearance and observing their reaction to their reflection in the mirror. Gallup anesthetized the chimps and then painted a red alcohol-soluble dye on the eyebrow ridge and the top half of the opposite ear. When the dye dried, it had virtually no olfactory or tactile cues. Gallup then removed the mirror before returning the chimpanzees to the cage. After regaining full consciousness, he recorded the frequency with which the chimps spontaneously touched the marked areas of skin. After 30 minutes, the mirror was reintroduced into the cage, and the frequency of touching the marked areas was again determined. With the mirror present, the frequency increased from four to ten, compared to only one when the mirror had been removed. The chimpanzees sometimes visually or olfactorily inspected their fingers after touching the marks. Other mark-directed behavior included turning and adjusting the body to better view the mark in the mirror or tactile examination of the mark with an appendage while viewing the mirror.

An essential aspect of the classical mark test (or rouge test) is that the mark/dye is nontactile, preventing attention from being drawn to the marking through additional perceptual cues (somesthesis). For this reason, animals in the majority of classical tests are anesthetized. Some tests use a tactile marker. If the creature stares unusually long at the part of its body with the mark or tries to rub it off, then it is said to pass the test.

Animals that are considered to be able to recognize themselves in a mirror typically progress through four stages of behavior when facing a mirror:
Gallup conducted a follow-up study in which two chimps with no prior experience with a mirror were put under anesthesia, marked, and observed. After recovery, they made no mark-directed behaviors before or after being provided with a mirror.

The rouge test was also done by Michael Lewis and Jeanne Brooks-Gunn in 1979 for the purpose of self-recognition with human mothers and their children.

== Implication and alternate explanations ==
The default implication drawn from Gallup&#x27;s test is that those animals who pass the test possess some form of self-recognition. However, a number of authors have suggested alternative explanations of a pass. For example, Povinelli suggests that the animal may see the reflection as some odd entity that it is able to control through its own movements. When the reflected entity has a mark on it, then the animal can remove the mark or alert the reflected entity to it using its own movements to do so. Critically, this explanation does not assume that the animals necessarily see the reflected entity as &quot;self&quot;.

==Criticism==
The MSR test has been criticized for several reasons, in particular because it may result in false negative findings.

===Perception===
It may be of limited value when applied to species that primarily use senses other than vision. Humans have been determined by biologists to have some of the best eyesight amongst animals, exceeding the overwhelming majority in daylight settings, though a few species have better. By contrast, dogs for example mainly use smell and hearing; vision is used third. This may be why dogs fail the MSR test. With this in mind, biologist Marc Bekoff developed a scent-based paradigm using dog urine to test self-recognition in canines. He tested his own dog, but his results were inconclusive. Dog cognition researcher Alexandra Horowitz formalized Bekoff&#x27;s idea in a controlled experiment, first reported in 2016 and published in 2017. She compared the dogs&#x27; behavior when examining their own and others&#x27; odors, and also when examining their own odor with an added smell &quot;mark&quot; analogous to the visual mark in MSR tests. These subjects not only discriminated their own odor from that of other dogs, as Bekoff had found, but also spent more time investigating their own odor &quot;image&quot; when it was modified, as subjects who pass the MSR test do. A 2016 study suggested an ethological approach, the &quot;Sniff test of self-recognition (STSR)&quot; which did not shed light on different ways of checking for self-recognition. Dogs also show self-awareness in the size and movement of their bodies. Garter snakes, a relatively social snake species, have also passed an odor based &quot;mirror&quot; test.

===Social motivation===
Another concern with the MSR test is that some species quickly respond aggressively to their mirror reflection as if it were a threatening conspecific, thereby preventing the animal from calmly considering what the reflection actually represents. This may be why monkeys fail the MSR test.

===Disinterest===
In an MSR test, animals may not recognise the mark as abnormal, or may not be sufficiently motivated to react to it. However, this does not mean they are unable to recognize themselves. For example, in an MSR test conducted on three elephants, only one elephant passed the test, but the two elephants that failed still demonstrated behaviors that can be interpreted as self-recognition. The researchers commented that the elephants might not have touched the mark because it was not important enough to them. Similarly, lesser apes infrequently engage in self-grooming, which may explain their failure to touch a mark on their heads in the mirror test. In response to the question of the subject&#x27;s motivation to clean, another study modified the test by introducing child subjects to a doll with a rouge spot under its eye and asking the child to help clean the doll. After establishing that the mark was abnormal and to be cleaned, the doll was put away and the test continued. This modification increased the number of self-recognisers.

===Ambiguity===
Frans de Waal, a biologist and primatologist at Emory University, has stated that self-awareness is not binary, and the mirror test should not be relied upon as a sole indicator of self-awareness, though it is a good test to have. Different animals adapt to the mirror in different ways.

==Non-human animals==
Several studies using a wide range of species have investigated the occurrence of spontaneous, mark-directed behavior when given a mirror, as originally proposed by Gallup. Most marked animals given a mirror initially respond with social behavior, such as aggressive displays, and continue to do so during repeated testing. Only a few species have touched or directed behavior toward the mark, thereby passing the classic MSR test.

Findings in MSR studies are not always conclusive. Even in chimpanzees, the species most studied and with the most convincing findings, clear-cut evidence of self-recognition is not obtained in all individuals tested. Prevalence is about 75% in young adults and considerably less in young and aging individuals.

Until the 2008 study on magpies, self-recognition was thought to reside in the neocortex area of the brain. However, this brain region is absent in nonmammals. Self-recognition may be a case of convergent evolution, where similar evolutionary pressures result in similar behaviors or traits, although species arrive at them by different routes, and the underlying mechanism may be different.

=== Animals that have passed ===

==== Mammals ====

===== Cetaceans =====
* Bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;): Researchers in a study on two male bottlenose dolphins observed their reactions to mirrors after having a mark placed on them. Reactions such as decreased delay in approaching the mirror, repetitious head circling and close viewing of the eye or genital region that had been marked, were reported as evidence of MSR in these species.
* Killer whale (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;): Killer whales and false killer whales (&quot;Pseudorca crassidens&quot;) may be able to recognise themselves in mirrors.

===== Primates =====
* Bonobo (&quot;Pan paniscus&quot;)
*Bornean orangutan (&quot;Pongo pygmaeus&quot;): However, mirror tests with an infant (2-year-old), male orangutan failed to reveal self-recognition.
* Chimpanzee (&quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;): However, mirror tests with an infant (11 months old) male chimpanzee failed to reveal self-recognition. Two young chimpanzees showed retention of MSR after one year without access to mirrors.
* Western gorilla (&quot;Gorilla gorilla&quot;): Findings for western gorillas have been mixed; more so than for the other great apes. At least four studies have reported that gorillas failed to show self-recognition. However, other studies have shown self-recognition in captive gorillas with extensive human contact. Such gorillas show less aversion to direct eye contact than wild gorillas. In wild gorillas, as in many other animals, prolonged direct eye contact is an aggressive gesture, and gorillas may fail the mirror test because they deliberately avoid closely examining or making eye contact with their reflections. Gorillas who have passed the MSR were habituated to the mirror before testing and were not subject to anesthesia during the marking process. Koko was among the gorillas who passed the MSR test under these circumstances.

===== Proboscidea =====
*Asian elephant (&quot;Elephas maximus&quot;): In a study performed in 2006, three female Asian elephants were exposed to a large mirror to investigate their responses. Visible marks and invisible sham-marks were applied to the elephants&#x27; heads to test whether they would pass the MSR test. One of the elephants showed mark-directed behavior, though the other two did not. An earlier study failed to find MSR in two Asian elephants; it was claimed this was because the mirror was too small.

===== Rodents =====

* House mouse (&quot;Mus musculus)&quot;

==== Birds ====

* Eurasian magpie (&quot;Pica pica&quot;): The Eurasian magpie is the first non-mammal to have been found to pass the mirror test. In 2008, researchers applied a small red, yellow, or black sticker to the throat of five Eurasian magpies, where they could be seen by the bird only by using a mirror. The birds were then given a mirror. The feel of the sticker on their throats did not seem to alarm the magpies. However, when the birds with colored stickers glimpsed themselves in the mirror, they scratched at their throats—a clear indication that they recognised the image in the mirror as their own. Those that received a black sticker, invisible against the black neck feathers, did not react. In 2020, researchers attempted to closely replicate the 2008 study with a larger number of magpies, and failed to confirm the results of the 2008 study. The researchers stated that while these results did not disprove the 2008 study, the failure to replicate indicated the results of the original study should be treated with caution.

* Some pigeons can pass the mirror test after training in the prerequisite behaviors. In 1981, American psychologist B. F. Skinner found that pigeons are capable of passing a highly modified mirror test after extensive training. In the experiment, a pigeon was trained to look in a mirror to find a response key behind it, which the pigeon then turned to peck to obtain food. Thus, the pigeon learned to use a mirror to find critical elements of its environment. Next, the pigeon was trained to peck at dots placed on its feathers; food was, again, the consequence of touching the dot. The latter training was accomplished in the absence of the mirror. The final test was placing a small bib on the pigeon—enough to cover a dot placed on its lower belly. A control period without the mirror present yielded no pecking at the dot. When the mirror was revealed, the pigeon became active, looked in the mirror and then tried to peck on the dot under the bib. However, untrained pigeons have never passed the mirror test.

==== Fish ====
* Bluestreak cleaner wrasse (&quot;Labroides dimidiatus&quot;): According to a study done in 2019, cleaner wrasses were the first fish observed to pass the mirror test. The bluestreak cleaner wrasse is a tiny tropical reef cleaner fish. Cleaner fish have an adapted evolutionary behavior in which they remove parasites and dead tissue from larger fish. When put through the mirror test, using a benign brown gel injected into the skin of the fish, and resembling a parasite, the cleaner wrasse showed all the behaviors of passing through the phases of the test. When provided with a colored tag in a modified mark test, the fish attempted to scrape off this tag by scraping their bodies on the side of the mirror. Gordon Gallup believes the cleaner wrasses&#x27; behavior can be attributed to something other than recognizing itself in a mirror. Gallup has argued that a cleaner wrasse&#x27;s job in life is to be aware of ectoparasites on the bodies of other fish, so it would be hyper aware of the fake parasite that it noticed in the mirror, perhaps seeing it as a parasite that it needed to clean off of a different fish. The authors of the study retort that because the fish checked itself in the mirror before and after the scraping, this means that the fish has self-awareness and recognizes that its reflection belongs to its own body. The cleaner wrasses, when tested, spent a large amount of time with the mirror when they were first getting acquainted with it, without any training. Importantly, the cleaner wrasses performed scraping behavior with the colored mark, and they did not perform the same scraping behavior without the colored mark in the presence of the mirror, nor when they were with the mirror and had a transparent mark. Following various objections, the researchers published a follow-up study in 2022, where they did the mirror test on a larger sample of wrasses and experimented with several marking techniques. The new results &quot;increase[d] [the researchers&#x27;] confidence that cleaner fish indeed pass the mark test&quot;, although wrasses attempted to scrape off the mark only when it resembled a parasite. Another study in 2024 found that cleaner wrasse that initially showed aggression to photographs 10% larger and 10% smaller than themselves ceased confrontation with 10% larger photographs upon encountering their reflection.
*Giant oceanic manta ray (&quot;Mobula birostris&quot;): In 2016 a modified mirror test done on two captive manta rays showed that they exhibited behavior associated with self-awareness (i.e. contingency checking and unusual self-directed behavior).

====Crustaceans====
*Atlantic ghost crab (&quot;Ocypode quadrata&quot;): A 2023 study found that these crabs seem to be capable of recognizing themselves in a mirror. The study&#x27;s author concluded that the data indicate that the crabs have &quot;a rudimentary form of self-awareness&quot;.
Cephalopods
*Mimic octopus (&quot;Thaumoctopus mimicus&quot;): A video in 2025 showed a Mimic Octopus recognising itself in a mirror

=== Animals that have failed ===
Some animals that have reportedly failed the classic MSR test include:

==== Mammals ====

===== Carnivorans =====
* Sea lions (&quot;Zalophus californianus&quot;)
* Giant panda (&quot;Ailuropoda melanoleuca&quot;): In one study, 34 captive giant pandas of a wide range of ages were tested. None of the pandas responded to the mark and many reacted aggressively towards the mirror, causing the researchers to consider the pandas viewed their reflection as a conspecific.
*Dogs (&quot;Canis lupus familiaris&quot;): Dogs either treat the image as another animal, or come to ignore it completely.

===== Primates =====
* Stump-tailed macaque (&quot;Macaca arctoides&quot;)
* Crab-eating macaque (&quot;Macaca fascicularis&quot;)
* Black-and-white colobus (&quot;Colobus guereza&quot;)
* Hamadryas baboon (&quot;Papio hamadryas&quot;)
* Cotton-top tamarin (&quot;Saguinus oedipus&quot;)
* Chacma Baboon (Papio Ursius)

==== Birds ====
* Grey parrot
* New Caledonian crow
* Jackdaw
* Great tit (&quot;Parus major&quot;)

==== Fish ====
*The Tanganyikan cichlid, or daffodil cichlid (&quot;Neolamprologus pulcher&quot;), is another fish that has failed the mirror test, according to a study done in 2017. Although not cleaner fish like the cleaner wrasses, these fish are typically regarded as socially intelligent and can recognize conspecifics in their social groups. Therefore, they would theoretically make good candidates for the mirror test, but they ended up failing. Similar to the cleaner wrasse, the Tanganyikan cichlid first exhibited signs of aggression towards the mirrored image. After a colored mark was injected, the researchers found no increased scraping or trying to remove the mark, and the cichlids did not observe the side with the mark any longer than it would have otherwise. This demonstrates a lack of contingency checking and means that the Tanganyikan cichlid did not pass the mirror test.

==== Cephalopods ====
* Octopodes oriented towards their image in a mirror, but no difference in their behaviour (as observed by humans) was seen in this condition when compared with a view of other octopodes.

=== Animals that may pass ===

==== Mammals ====

===== Primates =====
Gibbon (g. &quot;Hylobates&quot;, &quot;Symphalangus&quot; and &quot;Nomascus&quot;) have failed to show self-recognition in at least two tests. However, modified mirror tests with three species of gibbons (&quot;Hylobates syndactylus&quot;, &quot;H. gabriellae&quot;, &quot;H. leucogenys&quot;) in 2000 showed convincing evidence of self-recognition even though the animals failed the standard version of the mirror test. Another study published in 2009 documents 12 cases of spontaneous self-recognition in front of the mirror by a pair of siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus). Capuchin monkey (&quot;Cebus apella&quot;) did not pass in one test but recognized the reflection as special in another.

Rhesus macaque (&quot;Macaca mulatta&quot;) Though macaques failed the original mark test, they have been reported to exhibit other behaviours that indicate self-recognition. Rhesus macaques have been observed to use mirrors to study otherwise-hidden parts of their bodies, such as their genitals and implants in their heads. It has been suggested this demonstrates at least a partial self-awareness, although further study is needed.

===== Pigs =====
Pigs can use visual information seen in a mirror to find food. In a 2009 experiment, seven of the eight pigs who spent 5 hours with a mirror were able to find a bowl of food hidden behind a wall and revealed using a mirror. Pigs that had no experience with mirrors, looked behind the mirror for the food. BBC Earth also showed the food bowl test, and the &quot;matching shapes to holes&quot; test, in the &quot;Extraordinary Animals&quot; series.

There is evidence of self-recognition when presented with their reflections. So far, pigs have not been observed to pass the mirror mark test, however.

==== Fish ====
Two captive giant manta rays showed frequent, unusual and repetitive movements in front of a mirror, suggesting contingency checking. They also showed unusual self-directed behaviors when exposed to the mirror. Manta rays have the largest brains of all fish. In 2016, Csilla Ari tested captive manta rays at the Atlantis Aquarium in the Bahamas by exposing them to a mirror. The manta rays appeared to be extremely interested in the mirror. They behaved strangely in front the mirror, including doing flips and moving their fins. They also blew bubbles. They did not interact with the reflection as if it were another manta ray; they did not try to socialize with it. However, only an actual mirror test can determine if they actually recognize their own reflections, or if they are just demonstrating exploratory behavior. A classic mirror test has yet to be done on manta rays.

Another fish that may pass the mirror test is the common archerfish, &quot;Toxotes chatareus&quot;. A study in 2016 showed that archerfish can discriminate between human faces. Researchers showed this by testing the archerfish, which spit a stream of water at an image of a face when they recognized it. The archerfish would be trained to expect food when it spat at a certain image. When the archerfish was shown images of other human faces, the fish did not spit. They only spit for the image that they recognized. Archerfish normally, in the wild, use their spitting streams to knock down prey from above into the water below. The study showed that archerfish could be trained to recognize a three-dimensional image of one face compared to an image of a different face and would spit at the face when they recognized it. The archerfish were even able to continue recognizing the image of the face even when it was rotated 30, 60 and 90°.

==Humans==

The rouge test is a version of the mirror test used with human children. Using rouge makeup, an experimenter surreptitiously places a dot on the face of the child. The children are then placed in front of a mirror and their reactions are monitored; depending on the child&#x27;s development, distinct categories of responses are demonstrated. This test is widely cited as the primary measure for mirror self-recognition in human children.

There is criticism that passing a rouge test may be culturally motivated, and that what is commonly thought about mirror self-recognition actually applies only to children of Western countries. A study from 2010 tested children from rural communities in Kenya, Fiji, Saint Lucia, Grenada and Peru, as well as urban United States and rural Canada. The majority of children from the US and Canada passed the MSR test, but fewer children from the other regions passed the MSR test. In the Kenya test, only 3% of children aged 18–72 months touched the mark. In the Fiji test, none of the children aged 36–55 months touched the mark. The other non-Western rural children scored much better, but still markedly worse than their Western counterparts.

===Developmental reactions===
In a study in 1972, from the ages of 6 to 12 months, children typically saw a &quot;sociable playmate&quot; in the mirror&#x27;s reflection. Self-admiring and embarrassment usually began at 12 months, and at 14 to 20 months, most children demonstrated avoidance behaviors. By 20 to 24 months, self-recognition climbed to 65%. Children did so by evincing mark-directed behavior; they touched their own noses or tried to wipe the marks off. In another study, in 1974, at 18 months, half of children recognized the reflection in the mirror as their own.

Self-recognition in mirrors apparently is independent of familiarity with reflecting surfaces. In some cases, the rouge test has been shown to have differing results, depending on sociocultural orientation. For example, a Cameroonian Nso sample of infants 18 to 20 months of age had an extremely low amount of self-recognition outcomes at 3.2%. The study also found two strong predictors of self-recognition: object stimulation (maternal effort of attracting the attention of the infant to an object either person touched) and mutual eye contact. A strong correlation between self-concept and object permanence have also been demonstrated using the rouge test.

===Implications===
The rouge test is a measure of self-concept; the child who touches the rouge on their own nose upon looking into a mirror demonstrates the basic ability to understand self-awareness. Animals, young children, and people who have gained sight after being blind from birth, sometimes react to their reflection in the mirror as though it were another individual.

Theorists have remarked on the significance of this period in a child&#x27;s life. For example, psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan used a similar test in marking the mirror stage when growing up. Current views of the self in psychology position the self as playing an integral part in human motivation, cognition, affect, and social identity.

==Robots==
In 2012, early steps were taken to make a robot pass the mirror test.

<text>Wienerberger AG is an Austrian brick maker which is Europe&#x27;s leading manufacturer of roof tiles and the world’s largest producer of bricks. 

In addition to clay products, the company is one of the leading suppliers of plastic pipe in Europe. With its over 200 production sites, the Wienerberger Group generated revenues of €4,224 million and EBITDA of €783,3 million in 2023. It is based in Vienna, Austria. Founded in 1819, the company&#x27;s shares have been listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange since 1869 and currently have a free float of 100%.

== History ==
In 1819 Wienerberger was founded in Vienna by Alois Miesbach and got its start making use of clay deposits in the Wienerberg area of Vienna. The company embraced innovations such as circular kiln designs, allowing it to have near-continuous production and achieve early success. Miesbach continued to increase manufacturing capacity as the business grew, and by the time of his death in 1857 the company had nine factories, a clay plant, and multiple coal mines. Miesbach&#x27;s nephew, Heinrich Drasche, took over the company and maintained its dominant position. Starting in 1869 the company traded on the Vienna Stock Exchange.

For the next hundred years Wienerberger was the market leader in Austria. They branched into other related industries, such as ornamental sculptures, roof tiles, and architectural terracotta. After World War One and the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire Wienerberger lost many of its foreign operations and rebuilt around its core Austrian businesses.

The company began using mechanical presses for brick production around the 1920s, allowing them to produce perforated bricks. Advanced tunnel kilns were adopted starting in the 1950s, leading to increased manufacturing efficiency. They purchased Bramac, a concrete roof tile manufacturer, in 1972.

Starting with its purchase of Germany&#x27;s Oltmanns-Gruppe company in 1986, Wienerberger expanded into other regions of Europe and entered the plastic pipe business. In 1999 the company acquired General Shale in the United States and became the world&#x27;s leading manufacturer of bricks.

The company continued to undertake numerous international acquisitions, including Baggeridge PLC in 2007, Semmelrock in 2010, and Tondach Gleinstätten and Keymer Tiles in 2014. In 2021 the company&#x27;s American branch, General Shale, acquired Meridian Brick of Georgia, doubling revenues in the United States.

Wienerberger finalized its purchase of French tile manufacturer Terreal in 2024, dramatically expanding its presence throughout Europe and giving it ownership of Creaton and Ludowici Roof Tile. Around the same time General Shale completed its purchase of Summitville Tile, an Ohio floor tile and facing brick manufacturer.

== Architecture Award - Brick Award ==
In 2004, Wienerberger launched the Brick Award, an architecture prize that is presented every two years. Its goal is to recognize outstanding and innovative brick architecture. Projects are evaluated based on their sustainability, climate resilience, energy efficiency, functionality and architectural quality. The competition features five categories, honoring projects that showcase the versatility of ceramic building materials in unique ways. The use of wienerberger products is not a prerequisite for participation. Winners are honored at an award ceremony and published in the Brick Book. The award is endowed with prize money of 7,000 Euro for the grand prize winner (incl. category winner) and 5,000 Euro for each of the remaining four category winners.

<doc id="976346" wikidata="Q6961537" url="?curid=976346" title="Name of Sweden">
<text>In Modern English, the name of Sweden ( ) is derived from 17th century Middle Dutch and Middle Low German. In Old English, the country was named &quot;Swēoland&quot; (literally &quot;Swede land&quot;) and &quot;Swēorīċe&quot; (literally &quot;Swede kingdom&quot;); the latter is cognate with Old Norse &quot;Svíaríki&quot;. Anglo-Norman of the 12th and 13th centuries used &quot;Suane&quot; and &quot;Swane&quot; (with the adjective as &quot;Suaneis&quot;). In Scots, &quot;Swane&quot; and &quot;Swaine&quot; appear in the 16th century. Early Modern English used &quot;Swedeland&quot;.

The Old English name for Sweden was &quot;Swēoland&quot; or &quot;Swēorīċe&quot;, land or kingdom of the &quot;Swēon&quot;, whereas the Germanic tribe of the &quot;Swedes&quot; was called &quot;Svíþjóð&quot; in Old Norse. The latter is a compositum consisting of &quot;Sví&quot; which means Swedish and &quot;þjóð&quot; which means people. The word &quot;þjóð&quot; has its origin in the elder Indo-European word &quot;teuteh&quot;.

The name of the &quot;Sviar&quot; is derived from a self-designation containing the Germanic reflexive &quot;&quot; &quot;one&#x27;s own&quot; or &quot;self&quot;.

==Sweden==
The Modern English name &quot;Sweden&quot; was loaned from Dutch. Before the gradual introduction of &quot;Sweden&quot; in the 17th century, English used &quot;Swedeland&quot; or &quot;Sweathland&quot;.

It is based on Middle Dutch &quot;Zweden&quot;, the Dutch name of Sweden, and in origin the dative plural of &quot;Zwede&quot; &quot;Swede&quot;.
It has been in use in English from about 1600, first recorded in Scottish &quot;Swethin, Swadne&quot;. Country names based on a dative plural in &quot;-n&quot; became productive in German and Dutch in the 15th century; compare German &quot;Italien&quot; &quot;Italy&quot;, &quot;Spanien&quot; &quot;Spain&quot;, &quot;Rumänien&quot; &quot;Romania&quot;, &quot;Ungarn&quot; &quot;Hungary&quot;.

Outside of Dutch (&quot;Zweden&quot;), German (&quot;Schweden&quot;), and English, the name &quot;Sweden&quot; has also been adopted in Welsh. The English form in &quot;-n&quot; has also influenced several non-European languages, including Japanese スウェーデン (&quot;Suwēden&quot;), South Korean (&quot;Seuweden&quot;), Hindi (&quot;Svīḍan&quot;), Bengali (&quot;Śuiḍen&quot;), Yoruba &quot;Swídìn&quot; and the Chinese rendition (Southern Min &quot;Sūi-tián&quot;, Cantonese &quot;seoi6 din2&quot;), and via the Chinese Hanzi spelling various other languages in the larger Sinosphere (such as Mandarin &quot;Ruìdiǎn&quot;, Vietnamese &quot;Thụy Điển&quot;, etc.).

==Sverige==
In Sweden, the form &quot;Swerike&quot; is attested from the end of the 13th century, &quot;Svearike&quot;, from the 14th century, as well as the Icelandic &quot;Svíaríki&quot; and the Old Gutnish &quot;Suiariki&quot;.

In those days the meaning was restricted to the older Swedish region in Svealand and did not always include Götaland, the land of the Geats. The word &quot;rike&quot; translates to &quot;realm&quot; and also appears in the name of the legislature, &quot;Riksdag&quot; (c.f. Danish &quot;rigsdag&quot;, German &quot;Reichstag&quot;).

Towards the end of the 15th century, the form had changed to &quot;Swerighe&quot; both in Swedish and Danish, like &quot;baker&quot; (&quot;baker&quot;) to &quot;bager is&quot; and &quot;mik&quot; (&quot;me&quot;) to &quot;mig&quot;. This was due to a linguistic sound change. 17th-century spellings include &quot;Swerghe&quot;, &quot;Swirghe&quot;, &quot;Swirge&quot;.

Much is made about the difference between the medieval forms &quot;Svearike&quot; and &quot;Sverige&quot;. Medieval Swedes, though, were unlikely to see it as anything else but a matter of pronunciation.

==Names in Finnic languages==
A naming that stems from a completely different root is the one used in some Finnic languages, in Finnish &quot;Ruotsi&quot;, in Estonian &quot;Rootsi&quot;, in Northern Sami &quot;Ruoŧŧa&quot;, probably derived from various uses of &quot;rōþs-&quot;, i.e., &quot;related to rowing&quot; in Old Swedish, cf. Rus, probably through the old name of the coast of North Svealand, Roslagen, and to the fact that before sailboats were established in the Baltic Sea, row boats were used to traverse it. The etymology of the name shares the same root as the name &quot;Russia&quot;.

==Names in other languages==
The name of Sweden was Latinized as &quot;Suecia&quot; adopted in various Romance and Slavic languages, including Spanish &quot;Suecia&quot;, Catalan &quot;Suècia&quot;, Portuguese &quot;Suécia&quot;, Bulgarian &quot;Shvetsiya&quot;, and in non-European languages influenced by such languages, In these languages, there is frequent confusion between the names of Sweden and of Switzerland (Spanish &quot;Suiza&quot;, Catalan &quot;Suïssa&quot;, Portuguese &quot;Suíça&quot;, Bulgarian &quot;Shveytsariya&quot;). There is a historical tradition going back to at least the 15th century to the effect that Schwyz (the settlement which gave its name to Switzerland) was indeed named after the Swedes.
Ericus Olai in his &quot;Chronica regni Gothorum&quot; () notes the similarity in toponymy, &quot;Swycia, quasi Suecia&quot;. This tradition was taken seriously in 19th-century scholarly reception of the Swiss Swedish origin legend, especially in Swedish romantic nationalism (e.g. Erik Gustaf Geijer&#x27;s 1836 &quot;History of the Swedes&quot;), but is now considered unlikely.

Chinese uses to represent a phonetic approximation of the name (Early 20th century Mandarin: &quot;Shuì Diǎn&quot;, Modern Mandarin &quot;Ruì Diǎn&quot;, Cantonese &quot;Seoi6Din2&quot;.). Also in China, there has been frequent confusion with the name of Switzerland (Both Mandarin and Cantonese names beginning with the same character &quot;ruì&quot; (meaning &quot;auspicious&quot;), to the point where the Swiss and Swedish consulates in Shanghai launched a campaign to help Chinese tourists distinguish between the two countries in 2013.)

In Arabic, the name is rendered as &quot;Suwayd&quot; , the pertaining adjective being &quot;suwaydī&quot; &quot;Swedish&quot;, which happens to form a homonym with a pre-existing Arabic name &quot;Suwayd&quot; &quot;black, dark, swarthy&quot; (c.f. &quot;Sudan&quot;) and the nisba pre-existing in various parts of the Arab world (such as Riyadh&#x27;s as-Suwaidi district).

<text>Paul Dudley FRS (September 3, 1675 – January 25, 1751), Attorney-General of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, was the son of colonial governor Joseph Dudley and grandson of one of the colony&#x27;s founders, Thomas Dudley.

Dudley was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts in 1675. After graduating from the Roxbury Latin School and then, at the age of 15, from Harvard in 1690, he studied law at the Temple in London, and became Attorney General of Massachusetts from 1702 to 1718. He was associate justice of the province&#x27;s highest court, the Superior Court of Judicature, from 1718 to 1745, and chief justice from 1745 until his death in January 1751.

He was a member of the Royal Society, to whose &quot;Transactions&quot; he contributed several valuable papers on the natural history of New England, as well as the founder of the Dudleian lectures on religion at Harvard University. Dudley was an investor in the Equivalent Lands. Along with his brother, William, he was the first proprietor and namesake of Dudley, Massachusetts. In 1705, Dudley was recorded as owning an enslaved boy, and he acquired another slave in 1745 named Guinea.

Dudley died in Roxbury, and is buried in the Eliot Burying Ground next to his father and grandfather.

<doc id="976354" wikidata="Q6795906" url="?curid=976354" title="Maximum operating depth">
<text>In underwater diving activities such as saturation diving, technical diving and nitrox diving, the maximum operating depth (MOD) of a breathing gas is the depth below which the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of the gas mix exceeds an acceptable limit. This limit is based on risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity, and is somewhat arbitrary, and varies depending on the diver training agency or Code of Practice, the level of underwater exertion expected and the planned duration of the dive, but is normally in the range of 1.2 to 1.6 bar.

The MOD is significant when planning dives using gases such as heliox, nitrox and trimix because the proportion of oxygen in the mix determines a maximum depth for breathing that gas at an acceptable risk. There is a risk of acute oxygen toxicity if the MOD is exceeded. The tables below show MODs for a selection of oxygen mixes. Atmospheric air contains approximately 21% oxygen, and has an MOD calculated by the same method.

== Safe limit of partial pressure of oxygen==
Acute, or central nervous system oxygen toxicity is a time variable response to the partial pressure exposure history of the diver and is both complex and not fully understood.

Central nervous system oxygen toxicity manifests as symptoms such as visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may be followed by a tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day. In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.

The maximum single exposure limits recommended in the NOAA Diving Manual are 45 minutes at 1.6 bar, 120 minutes at 1.5 bar, 150 minutes at 1.4 bar, 180 minutes at 1.3 bar and 210 minutes at 1.2 bar.

==Formula==
The formula simply divides the absolute partial pressure of oxygen which can be tolerated (expressed in atm or bar) by the fraction of oxygen in the breathing gas, to calculate the absolute pressure at which the mix can be breathed. (for example, 50% nitrox can be breathed at twice the pressure of 100% oxygen, so divide by 0.5, etc.). Of this total pressure which can be tolerated by the diver, 1 atmosphere is due to surface pressure of the Earth&#x27;s air, and the rest is due to the depth in water. So the 1 atmosphere or bar contributed by the air is subtracted to give the pressure due to the depth of water. The pressure produced by depth in water, is converted to pressure in feet sea water (fsw) or metres sea water (msw) by multiplying with the appropriate conversion factor, 33 fsw per atm, or 10 msw per bar. 

In feet

formula_1

In which pO2 is the chosen maximum partial pressure of oxygen in atmospheres absolute and the FO2 is the fraction of oxygen in the mixture. For example, if a gas contains 36% oxygen (FO2 = 0.36) and the limiting maximum pO2 is chosen at 1.4 atmospheres absolute, the MOD in feet of seawater (fsw) is 33 fsw/atm x [(1.4 ata / 0.36) − 1] = 95.3 fsw.

In metres

formula_2

In which pO2 is the chosen maximum partial pressure in oxygen in bar and the FO2 is the fraction of oxygen in the mixture. For example, if a gas contains 36% oxygen and the maximum pO2 is 1.4 bar, the MOD (msw) is 10 msw/bar x [(1.4 bar / 0.36) − 1] = 28.9 msw.

<text>María de la Concepción Jesusa Basilisa Rodríguez-Espina y García-Tagle, short form Concha Espina (, 15 April 1869 or 1877 or 1 April 1879 or 15 April 1879 in Santander – 19 May 1955 in Madrid), was a Spanish writer. 
She was nominated for a Nobel prize in literature 25 times in 28 years.

== Life ==
María de la Concepción Jesusa Basilisa Rodríguez-Espina y García-Tagle was born in Santander, the seventh of 10 children of Víctor Rodríguez-Espina y Olivares and Ascensión García-Tagle y de la Vega. On 12 January 1893 she married Ramón de la Serna y Cueto, and they moved to Valparaíso, Chile during some years. The marriage had 5 children: Ramón, Víctor, José, Josefina (wife of Regino Sainz de la Maza) and Luis. The couple separated in 1909, and legally in 1934. In 1940 she went blind, but she continued to write. She died at 86, on 19 May 1955 in Madrid.

Her best known novel is called That Luzmela Girl (&quot;La niña de Luzmela&quot;) and describes life in the Cantabrian village of Mazcuerras, today also known as Luzmela after her. A Madrid metro station of line 9, Concha Espina, is named after her. A major avenue in the same area is called Avenida de Concha Espina.

<doc id="976365" wikidata="Q2993265" url="?curid=976365" title="Divided differences">
<text>In mathematics, divided differences is an algorithm, historically used for computing tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions. Charles Babbage&#x27;s difference engine, an early mechanical calculator, was designed to use this algorithm in its operation.

Divided differences is a recursive division process. Given a sequence of data points formula_1, the method calculates the coefficients of the interpolation polynomial of these points in the Newton form.

==Definition==
Given &quot;n&quot; + 1 data points
formula_2
where the formula_3 are assumed to be pairwise distinct, the forward divided differences are defined as:
formula_4

To make the recursive process of computation clearer, the divided differences can be put in tabular form, where the columns correspond to the value of &quot;j&quot; above, and each entry in the table is computed from the difference of the entries to its immediate lower left and to its immediate upper left, divided by a difference of corresponding &quot;x-&quot;values:
formula_5

=== Notation ===
Note that the divided difference formula_6 depends on the values formula_7 and formula_8, but the notation hides the dependency on the &quot;x&quot;-values. If the data points are given by a function &quot;f&quot;,
formula_9
one sometimes writes the divided difference in the notation
formula_10Other notations for the divided difference of the function &quot;ƒ&quot; on the nodes &quot;x&quot;0, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; are:
formula_11

==Example==

Divided differences for formula_12 and the first few values of formula_13:
formula_14 

Thus, the table corresponding to these terms upto two columns has the following form:
formula_15 is somehow an &quot;eigenmatrix&quot; of formula_16: formula_17. However, all columns of formula_18 are multiples of each other, the matrix rank of formula_18 is 1. So you can compose the matrix of all eigenvectors of formula_16 from the formula_21-th column of each formula_18. Denote the matrix of eigenvectors with formula_23. Example formula_24 The diagonalization of formula_16 can be written as formula_26

===Polynomials and power series===
The matrix 
formula_27
contains the divided difference scheme for the identity function with respect to the nodes formula_28, thus formula_29 contains the divided differences for the power function with exponent formula_30.
Consequently, you can obtain the divided differences for a polynomial function formula_31 by applying formula_31 to the matrix formula_33: If
formula_34
and
formula_35
then
formula_36
This is known as &quot;Opitz&#x27; formula&quot;.

Now consider increasing the degree of formula_31 to infinity, i.e. turn the Taylor polynomial into a Taylor series.
Let formula_38 be a function which corresponds to a power series.
You can compute the divided difference scheme for formula_38 by applying the corresponding matrix series to formula_33:
If
formula_41
and
formula_42
then
formula_43

==Alternative characterizations==

===Expanded form===
formula_44

With the help of the polynomial function formula_45 this can be written as
formula_46

===Peano form===
If formula_47 and formula_48, the divided differences can be expressed as
formula_49
where formula_50 is the formula_51-th derivative of the function formula_38 and formula_53 is a certain B-spline of degree formula_54 for the data points formula_28, given by the formula
formula_56

This is a consequence of the Peano kernel theorem; it is called the &quot;Peano form&quot; of the divided differences and formula_53 is the &quot;Peano kernel&quot; for the divided differences, all named after Giuseppe Peano.

===Forward and backward differences===
When the data points are equidistantly distributed we get the special case called forward differences. They are easier to calculate than the more general divided differences.

Given &quot;n&quot;+1 data points
formula_58
with
formula_59
the forward differences are defined as
formula_60whereas the backward differences are defined as:
formula_61
Thus the forward difference table is written as:formula_62whereas the backwards difference table is written as:formula_63

The relationship between divided differences and forward differences is
formula_64whereas for backward differences:formula_65

<text>The Progressive Labour Party (PLP) was a left-wing political party in Australia. In 2021, it merged into the Australian Progressives.

== History ==
The party was founded by dissident former members of the Australian Labor Party and the original Communist Party of Australia in 1996. The party claimed that the ALP has abandoned its traditional working-class supporters as it has moved towards the political right. The party ran Senate tickets in New South Wales and Western Australia and contested several House of Representatives seats at the 9 October 2004 election.

The party regularly made submissions to Senate and other committees on a broad range of issues.

Rod Noble, the national secretary of the Progressive Labour Party, described the Progressive Labor Party as a &quot;broad alliance&quot; of socialists. Blogger Andy Fleming stated the group has &quot;been largely eclipsed&quot; since the formation of Socialist Alliance. The party was de-registered by the Australian Electoral Commission in December 2006. The party merged with the Australian Progressives in 2021, with the merged party being deregistered due to having insufficient members the following year.

<text>John Romeyn Brodhead (January 2, 1814 – May 6, 1873) was an American historical scholar. During his service in the diplomatic corps, he transcribed many rare documents related to the colonial history of New York.

==Biography==

===Early life===
John Romeyn Brodhead was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Jacob Brodhead (1782–1855), a prominent clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church. He was named after his uncle, Presbyterian clergyman, John Brodhead Romeyn.

He was descended from one Captain Daniel Brodhead, a soldier from Yorkshire, who, after the English acquired New Netherland, was in command of the garrison at Esopus. His grandfather was Captain Charles W. Brodhead, who was present at the surrender of Burgoyne at Saratoga in 1777.

The family moved to New York City when he was twelve years old. Brodhead graduated from Rutgers College in 1831 at the age of seventeen. (Rutgers was established in 1766 as &quot;Queen&#x27;s College&quot; by Dutch Reformed ministers.) In 1835 was admitted to the bar in New York City. After 1837, however, he devoted himself principally to the study of the history of early New York. When his father&#x27;s health began to fail, he retired to Saugerties, New York, and as the only surviving son, John accompanied him.

===The Hague===
President Martin Van Buren of Kinderhook, New York appointed his friend, Albany lawyer and former congressman Harmanus Bleecker to the post of Chargé d&#x27;Affaires to the Netherlands. Both were from old Dutch families and interested in Dutch language and culture. As Bleecker was fluent in old-style Dutch and familiar with Dutch customs, he was well received in the Netherlands.

On arriving at his post, Bleeker discovered that he was not provided with a secretary to assist with correspondence and scheduling. As he was related to Brodhead&#x27;s mother, he offered the position to John. Bleeker was not allocated any funds for a clerk but apart from a small salary, an attaché of the legation would be in society and have the opportunity of learning German, Dutch, and French. Bleecker was also a highly regarded teacher in the law, and offered instruction in general law and jurisprudence.

With his father&#x27;s approval, Brodhead accepted. He booked a passage on the steamer &quot;President&quot; but was unable to arrive in time for boarding. The ship sailed without him and was never heard of again. Thereafter, Brodhead preferred sailing ships.

He learned that in 1818, the old records of the Dutch West India company for the period prior to 1700 had been sold as scrap to paper mills. Nonetheless, his research in various European archives discovered a good deal material on the early history of New York. After diligent search he found many official documents preserved in other archives, such as the minutes of the States General.

The year 1809 had seen Washington Irving&#x27;s satirical &quot;A History of New-York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, by Diedrich Knickerbocker&quot;. In 1829, the New York Historical Society published William Smith Jr.&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Province of New York: From Its Discovery to the Appointment of Governor Colden in 1762&quot;. Smith was a New Yorker, who did not consult Dutch-language sources directly, but did use some translations. According to historian Joseph Meany, Smith&#x27;s presentation of the Dutch was not a balanced one.

The Board of Trustees of New York Historical Society included members of some of New York&#x27; s most prominent old Dutch families. 
At the urging of the New-York Historical Society, the state legislature appropriated funds to appoint an agent to gather and transcribe documents relating to New York&#x27;s colonial history from various European archives. Brodhead was appointed (1841) by Governor William H Seward to undertake the work, and in four years gathered from England, France and the Netherlands some eighty manuscript volumes of transcriptions, largely of documents which had not hitherto been used by historians. According to historian J. Franklin Jameson, &quot;[n]ever did an American state send out a better record-agent.&quot; Little escaped his search. During this time, he made the acquaintance of Edward Everett, American ambassador to the Court of St James&#x27;s. He returned to New York in August, 1844.

These transcriptions were subsequently edited by Edward O&#x27;Callaghan (vols. i.-xi., md.) and by Berthold Fernow (vols xii.-xv., md.), and published by the state under the title &quot;Documents relating to the Colonial History of New York&quot; (15 vols., 1853–1883). Together they produced &quot;...the single most important collection of primary documents on New York&#x27;s colonial period.&quot;

===London===
In 1846, President James K. Polk appointed George Bancroft as minister to London. Gansevoort Melville, older brother of author Herman Melville, was secretary of the American legation in London, where he also served as his brother&#x27;s literary agent. When Gansevoort died in May 1846, his boyhood friend John Brodhead, was appointed to succeed him, and also took on the role of Herman Melville&#x27;s literary representative. During the unrest of the Chartist demonstrations, Brodhead was among many gentlemen sworn in as special constables. While posted to Great Britain, he also took the opportunity to take in performances on the London stage. With the election of Zachary Taylor as president, Bancroft&#x27;s political appointment ended, and he and Brodhead returned to the United States in 1849.

===Later life===
From 1853 to 1857, he was naval officer of the port of New York. In 1855 he was asked by President Franklin Pierce to become Ambassador to Japan, a position he declined because he preferred to remain in New York.

He was an active member of both the New York Historical Society and the St. Nicholas Society, and a trustee of Rutgers College from 1853 to 1873. on November 27, 1856 he married Eugenia Bloodgood at Grace Church (Manhattan). In 1867 he was appointed a Trustee of the Astor Library.

He published several addresses and a scholarly &quot;History of the State of New York&quot; (2 vols., 1853–1871), sometimes considered the best for the brief period covered (1609-1690). When the first volume, which covers New Netherland, was published, George Bancroft wrote, &quot;It is so full, so accurate, so marked by research and an honest love for historic truth, that we have only to bid him go and finish what he has so worthily begun.&quot;

He died of pneumonia in New York City on 6 May 1873 and was interred in the Trinity Church Cemetery in Upper Manhattan.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Jacob Brodhead Prize&quot; is a prize of $100 from a fund given by Reverend Jacob Brodhead, D.D., and his son J. Romyn Brodhead, LL.D., awarded annually to a Rutgers student in her or his junior or senior year who displays all-around excellence in Classics.

<text>WWE Superstars, or simply Superstars, is an American professional wrestling television program that was produced by WWE that originally aired on WGN America in the United States and later broadcast on the WWE Network. It debuted on and ended its domestic broadcasting on . After the final domestic television broadcast, the show moved to an Internet broadcast format while maintaining a traditional television broadcast in international markets. The show featured mid-to-low card WWE Superstars in a format similar to the former shows &quot;Heat&quot; and &quot;Velocity&quot; which served the same purpose. &quot;Enhancement talent&quot; bouts also happened often. Big names such as John Cena, Randy Orton, The Undertaker, and Triple H appeared on the show at its beginning.

On , WWE and WGN America announced an agreement to create a new weekly, one-hour prime time series entitled &quot;WWE Superstars&quot; that was to debut in (the show was based on 1 to 4 matches occurring where superstars from both WWE SmackDown, WWE Raw and formerly &quot;WWE ECW&quot; &quot;(2006–2010)&quot; compete in matches to determine who is the best for the WWE audience&#x27;s entertainment). Until early 2010, the replay also aired on WGN-TV. However, it was removed, hence eliminating distribution of the show from the Canadian fanbase. &quot;Superstars&quot; had its debut show on .

On , WGN America announced that they would not renew their domestic broadcasts rights to &quot;WWE Superstars&quot;, and the last episode they would air would be shown on . Online reports stated that the network did not renew the series because it didn&#x27;t live up to its expectations. WWE.com aired the show from to and again from to . The show continued to be produced for international broadcasting until .

On November 28, 2016, it was announced that &quot;Superstars&quot; had been canceled by WWE and would be replaced on the WWE Network by &quot;205 Live&quot;. &quot;WWE Main Event&quot; would serve as the complementary show featuring Raw and SmackDown talents (and would later replace &quot;WWE Superstars&quot; for international markets).

Select episodes are viewable on the WWE Network, and episodes from September 17, 2009, until September 20, 2012, are available to watch on WWE&#x27;s official YouTube channel.

== Production ==
The last theme song for &quot;WWE Superstars &quot;was &quot;New Day Coming&quot; by CFO$ featuring Todd Clark, which replaced &quot;Invincible&quot; by Adelitas Way on May 17, 2013. The final commentators were Tom Phillips and Corey Graves, and JoJo was the last ring announcer.

Matches featured on &quot;Superstars&quot; were taped earlier in the week, during the &quot;Raw&quot; events on Monday nights. The program aired on Thursdays until January 2015 when &quot;SmackDown&quot; moved to same night. &quot;Superstars &quot; was then moved to Fridays on WWE Network, with its first Friday night airing on January 16.

<text>Ferrymead Heritage Park is an outdoor museum in Christchurch, New Zealand.

First known as the &quot;Museum of Science and Technology&quot; and later &quot;Ferrymead Historic Park&quot;, it was founded in 1964 by a collection of local heritage enthusiast groups who had a common need for space to store and display their assets. It is in the Heathcote Valley, at the site of New Zealand&#x27;s first public railway. The museum is open to the public and operated mostly by volunteers.

==Features==
Ferrymead is built around a replica Edwardian era village. The buildings of the village are a mixture of replicas and genuine historic buildings that have been moved to the site. The buildings include a church, a theatre, residential cottages, a prison, and a Masonic lodge. The interiors of many buildings are fully decorated as static demonstrations, including functional kitchens in some cottages. The town centre also has a train station to serve the short stretch of track used for moving and demonstrating trains. The village has a main street, which is lined with electrified tram tracks that loop around the town.

The various heritage societies that operate from the park exhibit their collections in the buildings around the park. Most of the exhibits are static displays of heritage equipment and vehicles. On major event days (typically once a month) the societies provide an interactive experience for visitors. Guest can take tram or train rides, see demonstrations of typesetting and printing, use heritage telecommunication equipment, see a working model railway, and more. Park volunteers often dress in period costume to create a greater sense of immersion for guests.
The park houses a number of notable heritage vehicles. The oldest running steam locomotive in New Zealand, the NZR F Class F13 Peveril, is preserved at the park. The world&#x27;s only remaining operating Kitson and Company steam tram—No. 7 &quot;Kitty&quot;—is maintained at the park. The bright green Christchurch No. 1 tram, built in New York in 1905 and one of the first electric trams to run in Christchurch, is also still in operation at the park.

==History==
===Early railway===
During the early European settlement of Christchurch, Ferrymead was the location of a ferry that took passengers across the Heathcote River on their way between Lyttelton and Christchurch. For approximately the first 17 years of the colony, beginning in 1850, Ferrymead was a hub of activity, and was the location of the first railway in New Zealand. The railway, opened to steam trains in 1863, was a service built on gauge rail that connected the Bridle Path to the wharves at the Heathcote Estuary. However, the opening of the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel relegated the Ferrymead tracks to little more than a branch line, and the service was closed in around 1867. This made it both New Zealand&#x27;s first railway to open, and the first to close. After the tracks and buildings were removed, the area remained undeveloped as it was a low-lying swampy area and prone to flooding.

===Museum of Science &amp; Industry===
In the mid-1960s an association was formed to create a museum dedicated to &quot;science and industry&quot;. This was in part brought about by the prospect of vintage NZR F class locomotives being relocated from the South Island to the North Island at the Auckland Museum of Transport and Technology, so the initial focus was very much on preserving trains. Initial proposals for a location were at Hornby, Prebbleton or Heathcote, with the Prebbleton location being preferred initially. This was due to the proximity of existing track and an existing station building, but ultimately the deal fell through when the government Railways Department decided that increasing industrial activity in the area required the track to remain open. The association finally settled on Hornby. The museum association began outfitting buildings in Hornby in September 1964. The museum initially planned to open to the public in a large warehouse on Garvins Road in Hornby in October 1965, but vandalism at the site delayed this to March 1966.

===Move to Ferrymead===
The location in the Heathcote Valley had been on the table from as early as October 1964, but existing train tracks and buildings at Hornby had made that a more viable option in the short term. Within only a few months of the Hornby site being opened, the organisers turned to establishing a presence on the Ferrymead site. This quick move was because the museum had received an unexpectedly large amount of interest from heritage equipment owners keen to provide exhibits, and so needed a larger site to accommodate them all. Additionally, the Tramway Historical Society had been formed with the intention of creating a replica tram track for their rolling stock, which required the additional space available at Ferrymead. The Ferrymead site was provided by the Heathcote County Council. By October 1966 work was well under way to convert the site into a heritage museum, and by April the following year tracks were already being laid.

===Financial issues===
Over the following decades, a number of other historical preservation groups came to join the park, and it grew steadily. However, from the very beginning it struggled to remain financially stable. It relied almost entirely on fundraising and volunteers from member organisations contributing their time and expertise to maintain the exhibits. It was initially intended to become a tourist attraction and fund itself through ticket sales, but tourists to Christchurch did not show any interest in visiting the site. Additionally, many of the organisations that moved to the park were not interested in supporting it as a commercial tourist venture; rather, they saw it as a convenient place to have clubrooms and store equipment. This meant exhibits were open at uncoordinated times, or for only a few hours a week, limiting the interest of the park to public visitors.

The park continued to struggle financially through the 1980s and 1990s. In 1985 park management proposed a levy on Christchurch ratepayers to fund the park, though this would have required an act of parliament and never eventuated. In 1995, the financial issues came to a head, and the trust that oversaw the park turned to the Christchurch City Council for help. In February 1996, the park was placed under interim management, and later the same year a deal was struck. Under this deal, the council would purchase a large portion of the park land, and then vest back to the park trust for their use. This effectively served as a bailout of the park to pay off their debt in exchange for the council acquiring the land. The council would also adopt responsibility for park management. The move was controversial among the societies that operated at the park, with some seeing it as a secret plan to eventually close the park and sell the land. The deal ultimately went through, and the park remained open.

===Modern operation===
 the governance structure of the park is complex. At the top level the park is operated by the Ferrymead Trust, with day-to-day operations handled by Ferrymead Park Ltd, which is wholly owned by the trust. The trust also represents the 15 non-profit societies that operate at the park. Since 2015, the park has received annual grants from the city council averaging . The remaining balance of the park&#x27;s annual expenses are met through other means.

In 2024 the park again came up against major financial difficulties, this time attributed to low public attendance in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and a reduction in funding from local and central government agencies. The park was given a grant of by the Christchurch City Council to remain operating. After a change in management at the trust, several board members resigned, apparently in protest of planned changes to make the park more profitable. Executive director Jarrod Coburn said that the park had to become &quot;more than just a men&#x27;s shed.&quot;

In mid-2024 controversy arose at a plan to demolish a brick oven in the replica bakery at the park. The oven was built in the 1970s and had been unused since the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Park management claimed that the oven was irreparably damaged in the earthquake and was &quot;riddled with asbestos&quot;. Groups and individuals associated with the park objected to the proposed demolition, with one saying it would be &quot;sacrilege&quot; to destroy the oven. The demolition plans were put on hold after a &quot;robust&quot; meeting of the member societies.

==Member societies==
Over the decades since it was opened, a number of non-profit societies have become associated with the park.

===Canterbury Railway Society===

The Canterbury Railway Society were a founding member of the park. The society operates the narrow gauge railway at Ferrymead. They own, restore and maintain heritage locomotives and rolling stock on the site. The society runs the trains for visitors to ride during select park open days.

===Diesel Traction Group===

The Diesel Traction Group owns and preserves a number of English Electric diesel-electric locomotives on the site. The locomotives were formerly part of the fleet operated by the New Zealand Railways Department during the mid-twentieth century.

===Tramway Historical Society===
The Tramway Historical Society restores and operates trams at the park. During open days, the historic trams make short pleasure journeys on the standard gauge Ferrymead Tramway, between the Ferrymead historical village and the tramway maintenance sheds to the north-east. The society also maintains and operates the trams that run in the central city on the Christchurch tramway system, with the support of the Ferrymead workshop.

===Other societies===

The Fire Services Historical Society maintains the largest collection of historic fire engines in the southern hemisphere on the site.

The Ferrymead Post and Telegraph Historical Society maintains historic communication equipment from New Zealand postal, telegraphy and telephone services. They maintain historic telephone exchange switching equipment including a manual switchboard and an automated rotary system. The equipment is operable and can be used to make phone calls between rooms.

The Radio Preservation Society operates a broadcast station and transmitter at Ferrymead. The society broadcasts music on 1413 kHz AM at 900 watts from a nearby aerial during weekends. The stations&#x27;s historic call sign was 3XP. In addition to a working radio broadcast studio, the society maintains a museum of historic radio equipment for visitors.

A number of other smaller historical societies have operated from the park, including:
* Canterbury Centre for Historic Photography &amp; Film Inc.
* Ferrymead Aeronautical Society Inc.
* Ferrymead Printing Society Inc.
* Friends of Ferrymead Fraternity Inc.
* Garden City Model Railroad Club Inc.
* Heathcote Studios Theatrical Society Inc.
* Lions Club of Ferrymead Inc.
* Society of Rural History Inc.

==Geography==
The heritage park is in the lower Heathcote Valley. To the north is a bend in the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River just before it enters the estuary. To the south-west the Main South Line passes the park, and provides a connection between the park and the national rail system. A large amount of land in the area, including the heritage park itself, is owned by the Christchurch City Council.

Being close to the sea and low-lying, the entire area is part of a flood management zone. Since the involvement of the Christchurch City Council, portions of the unused land surrounding the park have been sold or leased for development by other recreational businesses including a golf club and paintball field. In 2024 a large area of unused land was set aside for ecological restoration into a wetland as part of the Ferrymead Regional Park.

An area near the park was used by the Heathcote County Council as a landfill. The raised location known as &quot;Woods Hill&quot; was formed artificially by the large-scale compacting of refuse dumped there over a number of years. In 2020 the landfill was one of several identified as presenting a risk of releasing toxic material into the estuary.

<doc id="976385" wikidata="Q337408" url="?curid=976385" title="Nivea">
<text>Nivea (, stylized as NIVEA) is a German personal care brand that specializes in skin and body care. It is owned by the Hamburg-based company Beiersdorf Global AG. This was the origin of the Eucerin brand. &quot;Nivea&quot; comes from the Latin adjective &quot;niveus&quot;, &quot;nivea&quot;, &quot;niveum&quot;, meaning &quot;snow-white&quot;.

In the 1930s, Beiersdorf produced various products such as tanning oil, shaving cream, shampoo, facial cleanser, and toners. During World War II, the trademark &quot;NIVEA&quot; was expropriated in many countries. After the war, Beiersdorf repurchased the rights. During the 1980s, the NIVEA brand expanded into a wider market.

==History==
Paul Beiersdorf established Beiersdorf AG on 28 March 1882. Beiersdorf collaborated with dermatologist Paul Gerson Unna to produce gutta-percha plasters in his laboratory based on his patent, laying the foundations for modern plaster technology. In 1890, pharmacist Oscar Troplowitz took over the company and collaborated with Unna, who recommended Isaac Lifschütz, inventor of the lanolin-based emulsifier Eucerit, which was patented in 1900. Nivea soap was released in 1906, and in 1911, its signature creme was introduced.

===Timeline===
* 1900: Patent application for Lanolin, an emulsifying agent. Eucerit was the basis for Eucerin and, later on, for NIVEA Creme.
* 1906: The first overseas branch was established in London.
* 1909: Labello was launched on the market. It was the first lip care product in sliding tube packaging. &quot;Labello&quot; is derived from the Latin for &quot;beautiful lip&quot; (labea = lip; bello = beautiful).
* 1911: NIVEA Creme – the first stable water-in-oil emulsion – was introduced. The emulsifying agent Eucerit is made from lanolin, found in sheep&#x27;s wool, and is the key to NIVEA Creme&#x27;s unique properties.
* 1918: The deaths of Oskar Troplowitz and his partner Otto Hanns Mankiewicz resulted in the formation of a formal company on 1 June 1922.

=== 1920s ===

* 1922: Willy Jacobsohn took over as chairman of the executive board of the newly formed stock corporation. The first self-adhesive plaster was introduced under the name Hansaplast.
* 1925: NIVEA is relaunched in a new packaging: a blue tin with a white logo.
* 1928: Beiersdorf shares were listed on the Hamburg stock exchange for the first time. Over 20 production sites worldwide were already in operation.

=== Nazi period in Germany and aftermath ===
* 1933: Under pressure of Nazi propaganda, the Jewish members of the executive board stepped down. Willy Jacobsohn, the former chairman of the executive board, headed the foreign affiliates from Amsterdam until 1938.
* By adopting a policy of &quot;honorable tactics&quot;, the Beiersdorf Executive Board, under the leadership of Carl Claussen, steered the company through the Nazi period. Although Beiersdorf retained its business culture, it cooperated with the regime.
* 1936: tesafilm, an innovative transparent adhesive film, was launched.
* 1941: tesa was introduced as the umbrella brand for self-adhesive technology.
* During World War II, marketing manager Elly Heuss-Knapp distanced the brand from Nazi ideology. In 1949, her husband Theodor Heuss became first President of Germany.
* 1945: At the end of the Second World War, most of the Hamburg production plants and administrative buildings in Hamburg were destroyed during bombing in WW2.
* 1945–1949: The Beiersdorf company lost most affiliates and international trademarks in almost all countries, particularly the US, the UK, the Commonwealth, and France. However, it began to regain its trademarks again.

=== Rest of 20th century ===

* 1950: ph5 Eucerin was launched on the market. This innovative ointment emphasizes the importance of the skin&#x27;s own natural protective acid barrier in maintaining good skin health.
* 1951: The first deodorizing soap, 8x4, was introduced. During the 1950s and 1960s, the brand was extended into a product family.
* 1953: NIVEA milk, liquid NIVEA Creme in a water-in-oil emulsion, was introduced &quot;for all-over body care&quot;.
* 1955: Beiersdorf launched a 
protective hand cream called &quot;atrix&quot; on the market.
* 1974: Beiersdorf diversified its business and introduced a divisional structure. Currently, the divisions are cosmed, medical, pharma, and tesa.
* 1982: The steady expansion of NIVEA as a skin and body care brand started through many subbrands with an international focus—the introduction of NIVEA Gesicht (face) in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.
* 1989: Change of strategy: Start implementing a strategic re-orientation process focusing on the core competencies of skin care, wound care, and adhesive technology.
* 1990: Acquisition of the Juvena brand, developed by the Divapharma pharmaceutical laboratory, founded in 1945 in Zurich.
* 1991: The acquisition of the La Prairie brand originated at the famous La Prairie clinic in Montreux.
* 1992: Launch of NIVEA&#x27;s Blue Harmony advertising campaign. It was placed the last time in 2005.
* 1995: Acquisition of the Futuro brand. The company was founded in 1917 by German Georg Jung, who produced bandages in Ohio, USA. The black-and-yellow packaging of the Futuro brand was introduced in 1936.
* 1999: The company&#x27;s strategy was further streamlined to focus on a few strong consumer brands. Professional wound care and self-adhesive technology were allowed to introduce organizational structures.

=== Twenty-first century ===

* 2001: The new strategy enabled tesa to become an independent affiliate. Tesa AG was formed as a wholly owned affiliate of Beiersdorf, enabling it to react more flexibly to consumers and industrial customers.

Professional wound care was spun off in line with the new strategy and contributed to a joint venture between Beiersdorf and Smith &amp; Nephew. BSN Medical, domiciled in Hamburg, was founded.
* 2002: Florena became a wholly owned subsidiary of Beiersdorf. The cooperation dates back to 1989 and intensified following Germany&#x27;s reunification.
* 2003: The previous divisional organization was replaced by a new functional group focusing on brands, supply chain management, finance, and human resources.
* 2004: The new skin research center opened in Hamburg, underscoring the innovative strength of the globally successful Beiersdorf group.
* 2008: NIVEA began sponsoring the Times Square New Year&#x27;s Ball Drop on 31 December 2008, along with the Carson&#x27;s Countdown on &quot;NBC New Year&#x27;s Eve specials.
* 2010: NIVEA launched its new product, NIVEA Happiness Sensation, featuring the song &quot;Touch&quot; by singer-songwriter Natasha Bedingfield in the commercial.
*2011: NIVEA celebrates its &quot;100 Years of Skincare&quot; festivities featuring several performances by Barbadian singer and actress Rihanna. Rihanna&#x27;s song &quot;California King Bed&quot; was featured as a part of the &quot;100 Years of Skincare&quot; commercial campaign.

==Controversies==
In 2011, NIVEA was fined $900,000 by the US Federal Trade Commission for falsely claiming that consumers could slim down by regularly applying NIVEA My Silhouette! cream to their skin. The same year, NIVEA published a world map on its website that omitted Israel; Simon Wiesenthal Center protests.

In June 2019, the marketing and media industry journal Ad Age reported on 26 June 2019 that FCB, Nivea&#x27;s long-time ad agency, had ended its relationship with the company. Among the primary reasons cited was NIVEA&#x27;s rejection of a proposed ad that featured two men&#x27;s hands touching because, according to a NIVEA executive, &quot;we don&#x27;t do gay at NIVEA.&quot; Crain&#x27;s Chicago Business reported that FCB had ended the relationship of more than a century. Noting that the breakup occurred at the end of LGBT pride month, Crain&#x27;s noted that FCB would be forgoing the management of NIVEA&#x27;s $21.8 million US advertising budget. It represented 1% of FCB&#x27;s revenue globally.

<doc id="976392" wikidata="Q5283771" url="?curid=976392" title="DivX, LLC">
<text>DivX, LLC (; also formerly known as DivXNetworks, Inc. and DiVX, Inc.) is a privately held video technology company based in San Diego, California. DivX, LLC is best known as a producer of three codecs: an MPEG-4 Part 2-based codec, the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC DivX Plus codec and the High Efficiency Video Coding DivX HEVC Ultra HD codec. The company&#x27;s software has been downloaded over 1 billion times since January 2003. DivX, LLC&#x27;s offerings have expanded beyond the codec to include software for viewing and authoring DivX-encoded video. DivX, LLC also licenses its technologies to manufacturers of consumer electronics devices and components used in these devices, of which over 1 billion DivX-enabled devices have shipped worldwide. DivX certifies that these licensed products are able to properly play DivX-encoded video.

==History==
The origin of DivX, Inc. began with video engineer Jérôme Rota (aka Gej), who made the original &quot;DivX ;-)&quot; codec available on his personal website after he had reverse-engineered the Microsoft MPEG-4 V3 codec. Gej was looking for a way to compress his portfolio so he could transmit it using the Audio Video Interleave file format (AVI). The codec became popular because it enabled reasonable quality video transmission over the internet (see DivX). Co-founder Jordan Greenhall, a former Mp3.com executive, learned of the codec from friends, and used it to download a copy of &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Greenhall eventually got in touch with Gej through an underground Dutch hacker group after a multi-month search. In early 2000, Greenhall put forward the idea of using the &quot;DivX ;-)&quot; codec to found a company. With co-founders Joe Bezdek, Darrius Thompson and, Greenhall and Gej created DivXNetworks, Inc. After coming under scrutiny for the original &quot;DivX ;-)&quot; codec, which was not a clean room design codec, DivXNetworks created a new, clean room codec.

In 2005, the company was renamed DivX, Inc. The company incurred net losses from its creation through the second quarter of 2005. The company was profitable for fiscal years 2005–07.

DivX, Inc. went public on September 27, 2006. It was listed on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol DIVX. In December 2006, DivX, Inc. was added to the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Indexes.

In November 2007, DivX bought MainConcept AG, a specialist provider of video and audio codec solutions.

In October 2010, Sonic Solutions completed their acquisition of DivX.

In February 2011, Rovi Corporation acquired Sonic Solutions (including the DivX business).

In April 2014, Rovi Corporation sold the DivX and MainConcept business to Parallax Capital Partners and StepStone Group.

In February 2015, NeuLion, Inc. acquired DivX, LLC.

In February 2018, a deal was finalized to sell certain DivX assets, intellectual property and subsidiaries from NeuLion, Inc. to Fortress Investment Group.

==Revenue streams==
DivX, LLC licenses its technologies to manufacturers of consumer electronic devices. DivX, LLC also licenses its technologies to manufacturers of integrated circuits designed to be used in consumer electronic devices. For example, on September 12, 2007, DivX, Inc. announced a licensing agreement with Qualcomm that allows the chip manufacturer to include DivX, Inc.&#x27;s technology in its video-enabled chipsets.
In addition to licensing, DivX, Inc. also certifies devices that can encode and/or play-back videos using the company&#x27;s codec according to DivX, Inc.&#x27;s standards. The company has certified DVD players, digital televisions, digital cameras, portable video players, and portable video recorders. DivX, Inc.&#x27;s partners have shipped over 1 billion certified consumer electronic devices, representing over 2500 product models. 
Partners include LG Electronics, Philips Electronics, Samsung Electronics, and Sony Electronics.

The licensing and certification agreements that DivX, Inc. strikes with its partners usually entitle DivX, Inc. to receive a per-unit royalty for every device shipped that incorporates DivX, Inc.&#x27;s technology and is certified by DivX, Inc. Approximately 75% of all royalties DivX, Inc. received are for products sold in countries outside of the United States, as DivX-encoded video is more popular in certain regions outside of the United States than it is in the United States. Royalties resulting from licensing are approximately $1 to $2 per unit shipped.
Prior to November 2007, DivX, Inc. also received revenue from Google by providing the option to download the Google Toolbar when downloading the DivX Player from the company&#x27;s website. In November 2007, DivX, Inc.&#x27;s contract with Google expired, and the company started distributing a co-branded version of the Yahoo! Toolbar and a version of Internet Explorer 7 that was pre-configured with Yahoo! tools.
DivX Inc.&#x27;s financial reporting for the third quarter of 2008 indicated that the Yahoo! deal was proving to be more lucrative than the previous Google deal. 
Soon after the company reported third quarter results, however, Yahoo! advised DivX, Inc. that it would cease making payments under the contract.
DivX, Inc. responded by suing Yahoo! in California Superior Court seeking damages and specific performance of the contract.
The company acknowledged, though, that its breach of the prior contract would materially affect its financial performance for 2008 and 2009. (In the first nine months of 2008, the Yahoo! deal accounted for 21% of DivX, Inc.&#x27;s revenue.) DivX, Inc. and Yahoo! settled their dispute in August 2009. 
Under the settlement, Yahoo! paid $9.5 million to DivX, Inc. In March, 2009, DivX, Inc. entered into a new promotion and distribution agreement with Google. Under the agreement DivX, Inc. would distribute Google products such as the Chrome browser and Google Toolbar along with its own products and would receive fees from Google for successful activations of these products.

==Stage6==

Stage 6 was a user-generated content site run by DivX, Inc. that was similar to YouTube but that allowed for uploading and viewing of high-definition video. Anyone could upload a video to Stage6 and make it available for viewing for free. All videos on Stage6 were playable on all consumer electronics devices that DivX had certified as being capable of playing DivX encoded video. Stage6 contributed to divx.com becoming one of the top 200 most-visited websites according to the site Alexa.com. Stage6 received a &quot;Very Good&quot; rating from PC World Magazine.

On September 6, 2007, DivX, Inc. filed a declaratory judgment action in federal district court in San Diego against Universal Music Group, Inc. In the lawsuit, DivX, Inc. sought a declaration from the court that DivX Inc.&#x27;s operation of Stage6 fell within the safe harbor protection provided by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act for hosting websites against claims of copyright infringement. Previously, UMG had demanded that DivX, Inc. take a license from the company to cover works on Stage6 that it owned and, in addition, pay UMG $30 million for past damages.
On October 16, 2007, UMG filed an action against DivX, Inc. in federal district court in Los Angeles for copyright infringement. UMG then moved to have the San Diego action dismissed in favor of the Los Angeles action. On February 5, 2008, the judge in the San Diego action granted UMG&#x27;s motion to dismiss.

On July 24, 2007, DivX, Inc. announced that it intended to separate Stage6 into its own separate private company because Stage6&#x27;s success has resulted in significant expenses that have impacted DivX, Inc.&#x27;s bottom line. In December 2007, DivX, Inc. announced that it needed additional time to consider the alternatives available to the company with respect to the future of Stage6.

On February 25, 2008, DivX, Inc. announced its plan to permanently shut down Stage6 on February 28, 2008, instead of selling it or spinning it off.

Prior to the decision to close the site, disagreements within DivX, Inc. on what to do with site appears to have led to the resignations of senior personnel, including co-founders Jordan Greenhall and Darrius Thompson.

==Acquisitions and investments==
In August 2007, DivX, Inc. announced that it had acquired the assets of Veatros, LLC, a Lawrence, Kansas-based company. Veatros developed video processing technology at the University of Kansas&#x27; Information and Telecommunication Technology Center. The technology can be used for video search and discovery. The deal was for $2 million in cash plus an additional $2.5 million upon completion of certain technology-related milestones.

In November 2007, DivX, Inc. purchased Aachen, Germany based MainConcept AG. DivX, Inc. paid $22 million for the company, and will pay up to additional $6 million upon the completion of certain milestones in 2008. MainConcept developed and distributes one of the most popular codecs using the H.264 standard.

==Awards==
* DivX, Inc. was selected as a Top 100 Private Company Award Winner 2006 by OnHollywood.
* DivX, Inc. was ranked No. 1 in Entrepreneur Magazine&#x27;s Hot 500 list for 2007.

<text>Stuart Charles Glyndwr MacGill (born 25 February 1971) is an Australian former cricketer who played 44 Test matches and three One Day Internationals for the Australian national cricket team. He is a right-arm leg spin bowler, who has been credited with having the best strike rate of any modern leg-spin bowler, but he did not have a regular place in the Australian Test team due to the dominance of Shane Warne in the position of sole spinner. 

In domestic cricket, he played for Western Australia, New South Wales, Nottinghamshire, Devon and Somerset.

He was brought back in 2007 after the retirement of Warne, as spinner for the first Test against the Sri Lankan cricket team. He announced his retirement from international cricket during the second Test of Australia&#x27;s 2008 tour of the West Indies. Moving into commentary, MacGill co-hosted the 2009 Ashes series on SBS with Damien Martyn and Greg Matthews. MacGill was a radio co-host on the Triple M Sydney breakfast program &quot;The Grill Team&quot;, 2009–2010.

In 2021, MacGill was the victim of an alleged kidnapping in the Sydney suburb of Cremorne. In 2023, he was charged with conspiracy to supply cocaine.

== Early years ==
MacGill was born in the Perth suburb of Mount Lawley and began his first-class career in the 1993/94 season playing for Western Australia. Both his father, Terry MacGill, and his grandfather, Charlie MacGill, had previously played cricket for Western Australia. He was an AIS Australian Cricket Academy scholarship holder in 1990–1991. He managed just one game, against New South Wales at the SCG but did not take a wicket and did not play again for over two years. When he returned in 1996/97 it was for New South Wales and he took 6 wickets in the match, the first being Darren Berry. He finished the season with 16 wickets at 37.00.

He spent the English summer playing club cricket for Heathcoat CC in Tiverton, Devon, and played a game for Somerset against the touring Pakistan A side.

The 1997/98 season was a breakthrough for MacGill, he made his Test debut and finished with 35 wickets at 28.14 in the Sheffield Shield.

==International career==
=== Test career ===
In the 3rd Test against South Africa at Adelaide in January 1998, MacGill was selected as Australia&#x27;s second spinner and helped them to draw the match with 3 for 22 in the second innings. He next appeared in October of that year for a tour of Pakistan, finishing the series as Australia&#x27;s top wicket taker with 15 wickets at 27.46.

MacGill kept his spot in the side when they returned home for an Ashes series, again finishing as Australia&#x27;s most successful bowler with 27 wickets at 17.70. His tally included his then career best innings figures of 7 for 50, made in the 5th Test at Sydney. He took a total of 12 wickets in that match and had done enough to convince the selectors to use two spinners for their tour of the West Indies. The leg-spin duo of Warne and MacGill had limited success: Warne, who was returning from injury, took 2 wickets in three tests, while MacGill took 12 wickets in four tests, as Australia drew the series 2–2.

The following summer, with Warne back to full fitness, MacGill was dropped from the side, only returning when Warne was again injured in the summer of 2000–2001, when Australia hosted the West Indies. In a series whitewash, all the Australian bowlers bar MacGill, who took 16 wickets at 31.31, managed to average under 20 with the ball.

He played his next Test in January 2002 against South Africa, taking 7 wickets. With Warne unavailable for the 4th and 5th Tests of the 2002/03 Ashes series, MacGill came in and despite taking 12 wickets he averaged over 40.

With Shane Warne serving a drugs ban, MacGill returned to the Caribbean in 2003 and for the next year acted as Australia&#x27;s sole spinner. In the 11 Tests that he played, including the Caribbean tour, he took 53 wickets. He played series against Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and India.

Sri Lanka toured Australia in 2004 and despite Warne returning to the side MacGill kept his spot. He struggled throughout the Test series and took just 5 wickets at 46.40. He lost his spot in the side and over the next year and a half played just two Tests, both on the spin friendly SCG wicket. The first was against Pakistan and his 8 wickets earned him the Man of the Match award. The second was against the ICC World XI and he managed 9 wickets. He was called up as part of Australia&#x27;s 2005 Ashes squad but was not used throughout the series.

MacGill partnered Warne when Australia hosted the West Indies for a Test series in 2005/06. He took 5 wickets at Hobart and just 2 in Adelaide. He played again in the Tests that followed, against South Africa, and won a place in Australia&#x27;s squad for their inaugural tour of Bangladesh. At Fatullah he took 8 for 108 in the first innings, his career best figures.
Warne retired from Test cricket at the end of the 2006–07 Ashes series, although MacGill faced competition for a place in the side from several younger players. MacGill is the quickest spinner to 150 Test wickets in terms of deliveries, when he reached 150 wickets by 8312 deliveries.

MacGill played 3 ODIs taking 6 wickets in three games at an economy of 3.50.

===Retirement===
MacGill announced that he would retire after the 2nd Test against the West Indies, due to recurring injuries to his knee and nerves in the arm leading to the fingers. Over his career, he has scored more 5-wicket innings than Shane Warne at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Both Warne and MacGill&#x27;s records were etched on the home (international) team dressing room&#x27;s honours board in SCG.

MacGill returned to cricket in the 2011–12 season, signing to play for the Sydney Sixers in Australia&#x27;s inaugural Big Bash League at the age of 40. He was a key member of the side&#x27;s Premiership triumph against the Perch Scorchers at the WACA, despite being one of the least-fancied sides.

== Personal life ==
MacGill&#x27;s father, Terry MacGill, and grandfather, Charlie MacGill, both played first-class cricket for Western Australia.

MacGill married 1989 Logie winning actress and journalist Rachel Friend, in 2000. The couple separated in late 2013.

MacGill is noted for his fondness for wine, holding a degree in viticulture, and books, once reading 17 novels during a tour of Pakistan. In retirement he appeared as a guest in the Australian wine comedy show Plonk. Known for his individuality, he was the only Australian cricketer to declare himself unavailable to tour Zimbabwe in 2004 on moral grounds. He also refused to appear in an advertisement for Cricket Australia sponsor KFC, saying: &quot;The problem for me is that KFC and Cricket Australia are hitting parents where they’re vulnerable. Parents are already under a lot of pressure from kids to buy this stuff and when you get the Australian cricket team endorsing it you just increase that pressure. It’s just wrong in so many ways.&quot;

In 2015, MacGill sued Cricket Australia for A$2.6 million for not making injury payments following his retirement in 2008. The matter was settled out of court in 2017.

==Alleged kidnapping and trial==

MacGill was the victim of an alleged kidnapping in the Sydney suburb of Cremorne on 14 April 2021. MacGill was allegedly dragged into a car at around 8pm local time and driven to a property in Bringelly in Sydney&#x27;s west where he was assaulted by four men, who were arrested over the incident a month later. Marino Sotiropoulos, the brother of Stuart MacGill&#x27;s partner Maria O&#x27;Meagher was also among those who were arrested by the police in connection with the alleged kidnapping, allegedly linked to a cocaine supply deal involving MacGill that had gone wrong. In September 2023, MacGill was charged with taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of cocaine.

<text>The Seal of Guam appears in the middle of the flag of the United States territory of Guam. It depicts Agaña Bay near Hagåtña, a local proa and a coconut tree. Charles Alan Pownall approved the seal in 1946. It depicts a coconut palm on the shore with a sailboat nearby on the water. The name &quot;Guam&quot; appears in red across the center of the seal.

==Symbolism==
The coconut tree, also known as the Tree of Life, holds a dominant position on Guam&#x27;s symbol. The shape of the seal is that of a Chamorro sling stone used as a weapon for warfare and hunting. The sling stone was quarried from basalt and coral. The coconut tree, growing in infertile sand, symbolizes self-sustenance and determination to grow and survive under any circumstance, with its fronds open to the sky—defies the elements to bend its will. Its bent trunk attests to a people which have been tested by famine, natural calamities, genocide and foreign wars but have continued to endure as a race. The seal also includes a flying Proa, a seagoing craft built by the Chamorro people, which was fast and agile in the water requiring great skill to build and sail. The Hagåtña River channel, where fresh water rushes out to interact with the ocean, symbolizes a willingness to share the resources of the land with others. The permanence of the land mass of Hila&#x27;an in the background demonstrates the Chamorro&#x27;s commitment to their homeland and environment, be it sea or land. Also in the background, &quot;Ritidian&quot; juts majestically into the endless waters of the sea, portraying the people&#x27;s faithful commitment to passing their proud heritage, culture, and language to the endless sea of future generations. Ritidian is often mistaken for Two Lover&#x27;s point, although the famous location is not visible from the point in Agana Bay.

<text>Mary Rosalyn Gentle (born 29 March 1956) is a British science fiction and fantasy author.

==Literary career==

Mary Gentle&#x27;s first published novel was &quot;Hawk in Silver&quot; (1977), a young-adult fantasy. She came to prominence with the &quot;Orthe&quot; duology, which consists of &quot;Golden Witchbreed&quot; (1983) and &quot;Ancient Light&quot; (1987).

The novels &quot;Rats and Gargoyles&quot; (1990), &quot;The Architecture of Desire&quot; (1991), and &quot;Left to His Own Devices&quot; (1994), together with several short stories, form a loosely linked series (collected in &quot;White Crow&quot; in 2003). As with Michael Moorcock&#x27;s series about his antihero Jerry Cornelius, Gentle&#x27;s sequence retains some basic facts about her two protagonists Valentine (also known as the White Crow) and Casaubon while changing much else about them, including what world they inhabit. Several take place in an alternate history version of 17th century and later England, where a form of Renaissance Hermetic magic has taken over the role of science. Another, &quot;Left To His Own Devices&quot;, takes place in a cyberpunk-tinged version of our own near future. The sequence is informed by historically existing ideas about esotericism and alchemy and is rife with obscure allusions to real history and literature.

&quot;Grunts!&quot; (1992) is a &quot;grand guignol&quot; parody of mass-market high fantasy novels, with orcs as heroes, murderous halflings, and racist elves.

Gentle formed part of the Midnight Rose collective in the early 1990s.

&quot;&quot; (published in four volumes in the US) was a long science fantasy epic that won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History in 2000. Gentle has since published &quot;Ilario&quot;, set in the same timeline.

She has also written a number of erotic novels under the name Roxanne Morgan.

<text>Spyro is a platform game series originally created by Insomniac Games as an exclusive for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation console. The series features the adventures of the main protagonist of the title character, a dragon. Since the series&#x27; introduction in 1998, there have been numerous sequels and a reboot trilogy. The series was originally produced by Universal Interactive, later became known as Vivendi Games; the rights to the intellectual property were acquired by Activision after its merge with Vivendi in 2008.

The series went dormant for a decade, until a collection of remakes of the original &quot;Spyro&quot; PlayStation trilogy called &quot;Spyro Reignited Trilogy&quot;, developed by Toys for Bob, was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2018, and later for Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch in September 2019.

== Development and history ==
=== PlayStation exclusivity (1998–2000) ===

&quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot; was released in North America on 9 September 1998 and Europe in October 1998 for the PlayStation. It is a platform game that placed the player as Spyro, a small purple dragon set with the task of freeing his fellow dragons from crystal prisons, which are scattered around their world. Each level is accessed through &#x27;portals&#x27; from a main world. The game closes out with the climatic battle between Spyro and the primary antagonist, Gnasty Gnorc. The game sold well, with a total of five million copies being sold worldwide. The game received favorable reviews from IGN giving &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot; a 9 out of 10. It received acclaim for its musical score by Stewart Copeland.

&quot;Ripto&#x27;s Rage!&quot;, known as &quot;Gateway to Glimmer&quot; in PAL regions, followed on from the success of the first title, making its release on 2 November 1999 in North America and 5 November 1999 in Europe for the PlayStation. The game introduced new characters including Hunter, a cheetah; Elora, a faun; The Professor, a mole; and Zoe, a fairy. The structure of the game is similar to the first, with levels being accessed from the three main home worlds: Summer Forest, Autumn Plains, and Winter Tundra. The game ends with the climatic duel between Spyro and the primary antagonist, Ripto. The game introduces some abilities for Spyro, including hovering after a glide, swimming underwater, climbing ladders, head-bashing, and the ability to use power-ups. Like its predecessor, it was critically acclaimed.

&quot;Year of the Dragon&quot; was released in North America on 24 October 2000 and Europe on 10 November 2000 for the PlayStation, and it was Insomniac&#x27;s last &quot;Spyro&quot; game. In the game, the dragons are celebrating the Year of the Dragon, an event held every twelve years in which new dragon eggs arrive in the dragon worlds. Bianca, an anthropomorphic rabbit, steals the eggs, and Spyro follows her down a rabbit hole. The rabbit hole leads to the Forgotten Realms, which are under the rule of the game&#x27;s primary antagonist, The Sorceress, to whom Bianca is apprenticed. As in the previous games, levels are accessed from a central home world, of which there are four: Sunrise Spring, Midday Gardens, Evening Lake, and Midnight Mountain. The game also features levels in which the player controls &quot;Sparx&quot;, Spyro&#x27;s companion dragonfly, in a bird&#x27;s eye view shooting game as well as four new playable characters: Sheila the Kangaroo, Sgt. Byrd, Bentley the Yeti, and Agent 9 the Monkey.

=== Multiplatform and handhelds (2001–05) ===

&quot;Season of Ice&quot; was the first Spyro game not to be developed by Insomniac Games or be on a Sony console, released for the Game Boy Advance and developed by Digital Eclipse. It is known as &quot;Spyro Advance&quot; in Japan. Spyro must use his fire breath to rescue the fairies in the various Fairy Realms after they are frozen by an evil monster named Grendor.

&quot;Season of Flame&quot; was the second Digital Eclipse title and was released for the Game Boy Advance. It is the sequel to &quot;Season of Ice&quot;, and introduces new features, such as the ability to breathe other elements besides fire. In the game, Spyro must recover the stolen fireflies scattered across the Dragon Realms and foil an evil plot by Ripto and his minions.

&quot;Enter the Dragonfly&quot; is available for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube, and was developed by Equinox Digital Entertainment and Check Six Studios. It had received mixed to negative responses from reviewers, referring to the numerous glitches, lack of storyline, originality, and long load times. The story begins with the baby dragons preparing to receive their dragonflies and celebrating. Ripto captures the dragonflies, making the dragons helpless, and accidentally scatters the dragonflies across the world with a spell. Spyro must recover the dragonflies.

&quot;Attack of the Rhynocs&quot;, also known as &quot;Spyro Adventure&quot; in Europe and Australia, is the third and final game to be developed by Digital Eclipse. Spyro is tasked with collecting the &quot;Heart&quot; of each land in order to stop Ripto&#x27;s latest evil scheme after a machine malfunctions opening a portal, bringing Ripto back into the dragon realms following the events of Enter The Dragonfly.

&quot;The Cortex Conspiracy&quot;, known as &quot;Spyro Fusion&quot; in Europe and Australia, and &quot;Spyro Advance Wakuwaku Tomodachi Daisakusen!&quot; in Japan, introduces multiple game screening. It is a crossover game between &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot; and &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot;, and a companion game to &quot;Crash Bandicoot Purple: Ripto&#x27;s Rampage&quot;. In the game, Spyro travels through Crash&#x27;s universe in a side-scroller, rather than the traditional isometric, top-down view.

&quot;A Hero&#x27;s Tail&quot; is available for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube, and was created by Eurocom. The game revolves around an evil plot by the villain Red, a former Dragon Elder, who begins to plant Dark Gems around the Dragon Realms, sucking the life out of these worlds. He also works alongside Gnasty Gnorc and Ineptune. Spyro then begins his journey to destroy all the Dark Gems, alongside Sparx, Hunter, Sgt. Byrd, and Blink.

&quot;Shadow Legacy&quot; acts as a sequel to &quot;Spyro: A Hero&#x27;s Tail&quot; and was released only on the Nintendo DS. This is the first &quot;Spyro&quot; game that plays as a role-playing game as opposed to a platformer and the game allows Spyro to gain experience, level up and learn new spells and combat moves. Spyro must use his new skills to save his allies when they are trapped in the &quot;Shadow Realm&quot; which features returning levels from the Dragon Kingdom, Avalar, and the Forgotten Realms.

=== &quot;The Legend of Spyro&quot; reboot trilogy (2006–08) ===

&quot;The Legend of Spyro&quot; is a game trilogy that is part of the &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot; series. It acted as a reboot to the original series. The games use a combination of close-combat and platforming gameplay, though the gameplay is more oriented towards combat than previous games in the Spyro series were. The story revolves around Spyro, the protagonist, and his efforts to stop Malefor, The Dark Master, from destroying the world.

The first installment of this game is titled &quot;The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning&quot;. It focuses on Spyro&#x27;s origins as a legendary purple dragon and his quest to stop Cynder, the black dragon waging war against the world. He meets Ignitus the Fire Guardian, a red dragon who tells him about his past and offers to train him in his newly discovered ability to breathe fire. Spyro must then embark on a quest to various worlds to rescue the other three Guardians; Volteer, the Electric Guardian, Cyril, the Ice Guardian, and Terrador, the Earth Guardian. Each guardian trains him in a new elemental breath to help him on his journey and eventual fight with Cynder herself.

=== &quot;Spyro Reignited Trilogy&quot; (2018) ===

Discussions around the relaunch of Spyro began as early as 2014. In a July 2014 interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph,&quot; Sony Computer Entertainment CEO, Andrew House stated that his team was considering bringing &quot;Spyro&quot; back. House stated that he believed video gamers would be interested in revisiting a character from their youth. Later that same year, Insomniac Games CEO Ted Price also stated that making a new &quot;Spyro&quot; game was a possibility. In 2017, developer Vicarious Visions stated that they were aware of how high the popular demand was for a revival of the classic Spyro series. In a statement they said, &quot;just keep asking&quot;. &quot;Spyro Reignited Trilogy&quot; was officially announced on 5 April 2018 and was originally going to be released on 21 September 2018 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, before being delayed to 13 November 2018. The game was developed by Toys for Bob and was ported to Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch, with a release date of 3 September 2019.

=== Other games ===
In addition to &quot;Crash Purple&quot; and &quot;Spyro Orange&quot;, Spyro has made various crossover appearances in the &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; series. Spyro appears as a playable character in the Game Boy Advance version of &quot;Crash Nitro Kart&quot;, and makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Crash Twinsanity&quot;. The characters Spyro, Cynder, Dark Spyro, Sparx the Dragonfly and Malefor also made appearances in the &quot;Skylanders&quot; series, including all six mainline games and the television series. Elements from the &quot;Spyro&quot; series were added to &quot;Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled&quot; as part of a post-launch game update in August 2019. Spyro, Hunter, and Gnasty Gnorc appear as playable characters, along with &quot;Spyro&quot;-themed karts and a &quot;Spyro Circuit&quot; race track. Spyro-themed parade and pool floats appear in &quot;Crash Bandicoot 4: It&#x27;s About Time&quot;, while both Spyro and Dark Spyro have major roles in &quot;Crash Bandicoot: On the Run!&quot; Spyro, Elora and Ripto made appearances as playable characters in season 3 of &quot;Crash Team Rumble&quot;.

=== Cancelled games ===
&quot;Spyro Ever After&quot; was going to be the first Spyro educational game where Spyro meets fairy tale characters like The Three Little Pigs, Little Red Riding Hood, Puss in Boots, Goldilocks and the Three Bears and Golden Goose. However, the game never passed the storyboard, and was cancelled.

&quot;Agent 9&quot; was a James Bond-like parody spin-off game starring Agent 9 as the main character as he does spy missions. It was set to be developed by Blue Tongue Entertainment and Backbone Entertainment and be published by Universal Interactive. The game&#x27;s production was cancelled for undisclosed reasons.

After the cancellation of &quot;Agent 9&quot;, Digital Eclipse reworked the game into a full &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot; title, that took place in a large desert environment. The video game title was never released to the market, and was scrapped by Digital Eclipse.

== List of games ==
== Common elements ==
=== Characters ===
The main character of the series is Spyro the Dragon, a young purple dragon. In the original series, he is accompanied by Sparx, a dragonfly that performs many functions such as helping protect Spyro from damage and collecting gems. Most of the games before the &quot;Legend of Spyro&quot; series include Hunter the Cheetah, a loyal friend of Spyro&#x27;s who sometimes helps him on quests; Moneybags, a money-obsessed bear who in some games is needed to make pathways for Spyro for a small fee; and Zoe, a fairy who serves as checkpoints in each land that Spyro visits.

=== Locations ===
The Dragon Realms are the main setting of the series where most of the dragons including Spyro live. Avalar is a separate world that was being threatened by Ripto in &quot;Spyro: Ripto&#x27;s Rage&quot;. The Forgotten Realms are the ancient home of the dragons before being driven out by the Sorceress and serve as the setting for Spyro: Year of the Dragon. The Fairy Realms are a separate series of realms that are inhabited by fairies and only appear in &quot;&quot;. After collecting enough orbs in &quot;Spyro 2: Riptos Rage&quot;, the Dragon Shores can be accessed, which has games and a special power-up for Spyro.

=== Collectibles ===
A large part of the original series revolves around item collection. When the player collects a certain amount of items, they can move on to the next area. The most common of these are gems, which are often used not only for collecting, but also for buying skills, passageways, items, and more. In &quot;A Hero&#x27;s Tail&quot; there were special dark gems, which the player had to destroy to proceed to new areas within the game, while collecting light gems allowed use of some of the professor&#x27;s inventions and opened certain doors.

Freeing dragons is the main goal in &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot;, while retrieving dragon eggs is the main goal in &quot;&quot;. In &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot;, dragon eggs are also collected by chasing down thieves (but their color designs are different from those of the third installment). They also appear in &quot;Spyro: A Hero&#x27;s Tail&quot;, and collecting them will unlock concept art. Collecting Talismans and Orbs are the primary goal in &quot;Spyro 2: Ripto&#x27;s Rage!&quot;, as the devices are used in a portal to get Spyro back to his home. Dragonflies are the primary collectibles in &quot;&quot; where Spyro catches them using his bubble breath. In &quot;&quot; freeing fairies is the main goal, and in &quot;Spyro 2: Season of Flame&quot; collecting fireflies is the goal.

== Music ==
Stewart Copeland composed the soundtracks for the first four &quot;Spyro&quot; games. Copeland made music for each world in the games as well as music devoted to each level, often playing each level so he could tailor the mood of the music to the level. As with the voice cast in &quot;A Hero&#x27;s Tail&quot;, Stewart Copeland was replaced and the soundtrack was composed by Steve Duckworth and Paul Lawler. Rebecca Kneubuhl and Gabriel Mann of the a cappella band Spiralmouth composed the music for &quot;The Legend of Spyro&quot; trilogy. Finally, for &quot;Reignited Trilogy&quot;, Copeland&#x27;s music was remixed in-house by the developer and remained mostly faithful to the original scores; Copeland himself composed a main theme for the compilation.

== Reception ==

As of 2007, the &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot; series has sold over 20 million units worldwide. According to the Los Angeles Times, the first &quot;Spyro&quot; game has sold over 4.8 million units worldwide as of November 2007 making it the seventeenth best-selling PlayStation game of all time, &quot;Ripto&#x27;s Rage!&quot; sold 3.45 million units and &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot; sold 3.28 million units.

<doc id="976423" wikidata="Q5042617" url="?curid=976423" title="Carlos Sandoval">
<text>Carlos Sandoval Mendoza (born 1956, Mexico City) is a Mexican/German multidiscipline artist mostly recognized for his work joining technology and a Gestalt approach to the art of music composition, multi channel video, time-lapsed performance, AI-assisted art and Ink-Pen Drawing. Michael Zwenzner describes him as a &quot;Socio-critical magician of the extended-multimedia instrumental theater.&quot; On more recent Sandoval&#x27;s work, Davood wrote: &quot;[...] Each piece, whether sound or video art, music composition or intricate drawings, reflects an artist who is as much a global citizen as he is a silent observer of the internal human odyssey&quot;.

==Life and Work==
Sandoval was born in an archetypal barrio in downtown Mexico City. Since his childhood, he was exposed to harrowing social and cultural conditions which were later reflected in his work. In 2009 he became a German citizen and now holds a dual Mexican-German passport/nationality. Having abandoned his music studies at Escuela Nacional de Música UNAM 1976-79, Sandoval went on to study composition, analysis and theory, privately, with Julio Estrada (1985–90). He also assisted and took part in private sessions with several other composers. In Europe he learned Piano tuning and building at the Bösendorfer Klavier Fabrik in Vienna (1980–82). This stint radically changed his outlook on sound in general. Later on, as a photographer and videographer he studied with Sirgo (Mexico), Fabri (Austria), and Fathi (Germany). Sandoval is internationally active. From 1999 until 2018, he was a fellow of the SNCA which is one of the highest recognitions awarded to Mexican artists by the Mexican Government. He also worked as an assistant to Conlon Nancarrow (1991–94).

Sandoval identifies himself with diverse Edmund Husserl&#x27;s phenomenological concepts like Lifeworld (&quot;In whatever way we may be conscious of the world as universal horizon, as coherent universe of existing objects, we, each &quot;I-the-man&quot; and all of us together, belong to the world as living with one another in the world; and the world is our world, valid for our consciousness as existing precisely through this &#x27;living together.&#x27;), &quot;Empathy and Subjectivity&quot; (the subjectivity of others, as well as our intersubjective engagement with them), Evidence (&quot;the successful presentation of something whose truth becomes manifest in the evidencing itself&quot;), Intuition (&quot;...having a cup of coffee in front of you, for instance, seeing it, feeling it, or even imagining it: these are all &quot;filled intentions&quot;, and the object is then intuited&quot;) and Intentionality of consciousness (&quot;the power of minds to be about, to represent, or to stand for, things, properties and states of affairs&quot;). All these concepts are linked in Sandoval&#x27;s work with an ethical use of technology, (or Technoethics: using technology not just without renouncing humanism but stressing and empowering Humanism). He has been invited to take part in numerous events and contemporary music festivals around Western countries. He is also the author of multiple articles and speculative essays about music. During (and after) the COVID-19 pandemic, he is focused mainly on ink-pen drawing.

==Early Work – Estradian-Xenakian period (1987-1990)==
His early work can be identified with Julio Estrada&#x27;s Techniques and the Xenakian school and includes the use of Cartesian graphics representing sonic trajectories and its evolutions, multi parametrics (utilizing several simultaneous performance and compositional resources in a single line or stave) as well as internal sonic imagination analysis. &quot;Ginantria&quot;, for cello solo, 1990, is the best example of this period. A number of out-of-catalogue pieces also belong to this stage:

* &quot;Traepes&quot;, 1985, 4:58&quot;, Glissandi studies, made before his studies). Chamula harp and tuning forks.
* &quot;Filos&quot;, 1987–89, 12:00&quot; Chamber concert, never premiered.
* &quot;Lomos&quot;, 1989, 7:35&quot; UPIC System
* &quot;Ginantria&quot;, 1990, 12:05&quot; Violoncello.
* &quot;Homenaje&quot;, 1991, 7:39&quot; UPIC system

==Postmodern-Synthesis Period (1993-04)==
In 1991 Sandoval met Conlon Nancarrow and began work as his assistant (1991–94). The influence of Nancarrow&#x27;s music was strong at this time while some remains of Xenakian style were also present. Sandoval&#x27;s musical thinking began to lose . This lack of &quot;school&quot;, &quot;channelized impulse&quot; or &quot;Style&quot; (&quot;Style is just a super thin ham slice between your &quot;freedom&quot; and your own limitations&quot; (Sandoval, 2009)) remained a characteristic of his work and can be easily identified with a radical postmodern approach. Besides this, it took Sandoval almost four years to assimilate and synthesize the influence of both Estrada and Nancarrow, apparently the polar opposites of one another but in fact both belonging to a Cartesian, rational, object-oriented way of thinking. 
Sandoval&#x27;s music from this period is described well by the list of 16 postmodern music characteristics defined by Kramer (Kramer 2002, 16–17). Between 2002 and 2003, just prior to relocating to Germany, Sandoval published two of his &quot;manifestos&quot;: &quot;Imaginación, análisis y posmodernismo&quot; and &quot;De la fenomenología al ejercicio estético, o una apología del cinismo&quot;.

==German Period 1 (2003-2007)==
Carlos Sandoval moved to Berlin, Germany in September 2003. His first German project was &quot;Mextoys&quot;, 2003–04, 80:00&quot;, commissioned by the Festival Eigenarten and the Culture Ministry in Hamburg and premiered at the city&#x27;s prestigious Hochschule für Musik und Theater in Hamburg. This piece constituted a breakthrough in Sandoval&#x27;s work: it was his first true &quot;phenomenological&quot; work, his first full multimedia piece, and his first work joining video and music into a single conceptual and constructive layer. This point marked Sandoval&#x27;s departure from traditional score writing and deterministic thinking, towards developing either an experience-oriented connection to music and a Piagetian approach to animism towards music and life in general. Jean Piaget&#x27;s theories of language as an object and the cognitive inability to distinguish the external world from one&#x27;s psyche, still have a strong influence on Sandoval&#x27;s work.

* &quot;Mex-toys&quot;, 2003–04, three movements., 80:00&quot;, percussion, dance, video and tape. Scenes from videoclips projected during the performance are reenacted live by the musicians performing on stage.

==German Period 2 (2006-2012)==
While living in Berlin, Sandoval met a number of computer-science specialists and began developing work incorporating the use of sensors. His third &quot;manifesto&quot;, published in Germany in 2009 interjects cultural, artistic and political values to the pure act of sonification via the use of technology. His work incorporating living trees, accelerometers and hands equipped with tactile sensors is based on random-picking software, and adds a mystical quality to the otherwise objective process of transduction of physical phenomena.

<text>Christopher Columbus Langdell (May 22, 1826 – July 6, 1906) was an American jurist and legal academic who was Dean of Harvard Law School from 1870 to 1895. As a professor and administrator, he pioneered the casebook method of instruction, which has since been widely adopted in American law schools and adapted for other professional disciplines, such as business, public policy, and education. He has been referred to as &quot;arguably the most influential teacher in the history of professional education in the United States&quot;.

Dean Langdell&#x27;s legacy lies in the educational and administrative reforms he made to Harvard Law School, a task he was entrusted with by President Charles Eliot. Before Langdell&#x27;s tenure the study of law was a rather technical pursuit in which students were simply told what the law is. Langdell applied the principles of pragmatism to the teaching of law as a result of which students were compelled to use their own reasoning powers to understand how the law might apply in a given case. This dialectical process came to be called the case method and has been the primary method of pedagogy at American law schools ever since. The case method has since been adopted and improved upon by schools in other disciplines, such as business, public policy, and education.

==Life==

Christopher Langdell was born in the town of New Boston, New Hampshire, of English and Scots-Irish ancestry. He studied at Phillips Exeter Academy in 1845–48, at Harvard College in 1848–50 and at Harvard Law School in 1851–54. As a student, he served as one of the Harvard Law School&#x27;s first librarians. From 1854 to 1870 he practiced law in New York City. In January 1870 he received an invitation from Charles Eliot to take up the chair of Dane Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. Langdell accepted the offer and soon after became Dean of the Law Faculty, succeeding Theophilus Parsons, to whose &quot;Treatise on the Law of Contracts&quot; (1853) he had contributed as a student. As Dean he introduced sweeping changes to the curriculum of the Law school, extending the length of the academic programme from one to three years and replacing the old-style lecture system with a new system of tuition which required a significantly greater level of engagement and input from students. He rejected the tradition in English-speaking countries of learning law by professional apprenticeship, in favor of the European tradition of a university education. He insisted that law teaching had to be supported by an extensive law library, for &quot;law is a science&quot; and &quot;all the available materials of that science are contained in printed books&quot;. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1870 and received the degree of LL.D. in 1875.

Langdell resigned the deanship in 1895, in 1900 became Dane Professor Emeritus, and on July 6, 1906, died in Cambridge. In 1903 a chair in the law school was named in his honor and after his death the school&#x27;s primary academic building, housing both the world&#x27;s largest academic law library and classrooms, was named Langdell Hall.

Langdell made the Harvard Law School a success by remodeling its administration. In a private correspondence of April 13, 1915, Charles W. Eliot wrote: &quot;the putting of Langdell in charge of the Law School was the best piece of work I did for Harvard University, except the reconstruction of the Medical school in [18]70 and [18]71, and the long fight for the development of the elective system.&quot;

==Influence on legal teaching==

Dean Langdell&#x27;s greatest innovation was his introduction of the case method of instruction.
Until 1890, no other U.S. law school used this method, which is now standard. 
Moreover, the standard first-year curriculum at all American law schools — Contracts, Property, Torts, Criminal Law, and Civil Procedure — stands, mostly unchanged, from the curriculum Langdell instituted.

Langdell, who came from a relatively unknown family, was conscious of the fact that students from more privileged backgrounds often received higher grades in their coursework purely because of their family&#x27;s wealth and social status. Dean Langdell instituted the process of blind grading, now common at U.S. law schools, so that students already known by professors or from esteemed families would have no advantage over others.
