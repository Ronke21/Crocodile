<text>Strictly Come Dancing (commonly referred to as Strictly) is a British dance contest show in which celebrities partner with professional dancers to compete in mainly ballroom and Latin dance. Each couple is scored by a panel of judges. The title of the show is a continuation of the long-running series &quot;Come Dancing&quot;. The format has been exported to 60 other countries under the title &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, licensed by BBC Worldwide, and led to a modern dance-themed spin-off &quot;Strictly Dance Fever&quot;. The &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; named &quot;Strictly&quot; as the world&#x27;s most successful reality television format in 2010. The series is currently presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman. Bruce Forsyth co-presented the series with Daly until 2013, returning for special episodes until November 2015.

The series has been broadcast on BBC One since 15 May 2004, typically on Saturday evenings with a following Sunday night results show. From series 2 onwards, the show has been broadcast in the run up to Christmas. With its high viewing figures, &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; has become a significant programme for dancing on British television. Eighteen stand-alone Christmas specials and nineteen charity specials have also been produced.

==Development==
Producer Richard Hopkins, who had produced the first British series of &quot;Big Brother&quot;, unsuccessfully pitched the idea of a modern &quot;Come Dancing&quot; to the BBC under the title of &quot;Pro-Celebrity Dancing&quot; in 2003. Later, entertainment executive Fenia Vardanis also suggested reviving &quot;Come Dancing&quot;, so Jane Lush, the then head of BBC Entertainment, put Hopkins and Vardanis together to develop the show.

Hopkins then called in Karen Smith, who had just produced &quot;Comic Relief Does Fame Academy&quot; for BBC One and &quot;The Games&quot; for Channel 4, to help lead the development of the show and launch the series. Smith was the show-running Executive Producer of the first three series, and of sister show &quot;It Takes Two&quot;. She then took the role of Creative Director of BBC Entertainment whilst still overseeing series 4 and 5.

Hopkins later took the format to America himself when the BBC dismissed the idea of selling it abroad, as they felt it was too British.

The title is an amalgamation of the titles of the 1992 Australian film &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; and &quot;Come Dancing&quot;.

==Format==
From series 1 to 11, Sir Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly presented the pro-celebrity ballroom dancing competition. From series 8 to 11, Forsyth only presented the main show and was replaced for the results show by Claudia Winkleman, at which point Daly assumed Forsyth&#x27;s role as main presenter and Winkleman assumed Daly&#x27;s role as co-presenter. Winkleman joined Daly as full-time co-presenter for series 12 following Forsyth&#x27;s departure after the 2013 series. Through telephone voting, viewers vote for who they would like to be in the next round, the results of the poll being combined with the ranking of the judges. For example, with ten contestants left, the judges&#x27; favourite would receive ten points, second favourite nine points, and so on, and similarly with the viewers&#x27; rankings. The bottom ranked couple gets one point. In the event of tied scoring from the judges by two or more contestants, the couple immediately below them gets one point below them, until the bottom ranked couple on the leaderboard who ends up getting at least 2 points instead of one. The profits from the telephone lines were donated to Sport Relief in series 1, to Children in Need from series 2, until series 8 when donations to charity stopped.

The show is broadcast live on BBC One on Saturday evenings, and is currently presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman (with Zoe Ball covering for Winkleman for a number of weeks in 2014). Sir Bruce Forsyth presented the live shows alongside Daly from 2004 to 2013, announcing his departure in 2014. He was to continue to present special editions of the show. For most of the second series, Natasha Kaplinsky stood in temporarily for Daly while she took maternity leave; Claudia Winkleman hosted the results show and editions that Forsyth had missed between 2010 and 2013. The judging panel initially consisted of Bruno Tonioli, Arlene Phillips, Len Goodman and Craig Revel Horwood. Alesha Dixon took Phillips&#x27; place from series 7 to 9, after which she left the programme to judge &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; which led retired ballerina Dame Darcey Bussell to replace her. Goodman left the show after the 2016 series and was replaced by Shirley Ballas. Bussell remained as judge until 2018, and was replaced by Motsi Mabuse in 2019. Up until 2020, Tonioli commuted weekly between Hollywood and London to judge both the American and British versions of the show simultaneously - however, due the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, he could no longer juggle both the UK and US shows - he was not replaced for the 2020 series; but pro dancer Anton Du Beke took his place from the 2021 series, and has now replaced Tonioli full-time on the panel. The current judging panel consists of Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Shirley Ballas and Anton Du Beke, making Horwood the only judge to remain with the programme since its inception. Each judge gives the performance a mark out of ten, giving an overall total out of forty. The voice-over announcer is Alan Dedicoat. During series four, an hour-long highlights show was shown on Sundays at 19:00 on BBC Two, and during series five and six, the results show moved to Sunday evenings, although it was filmed on Saturday and then broadcast &quot;as live&quot; on the Sunday.

The singers on the show are Tommy Blaize, Hayley Sanderson, Lance Ellington, Andrea Grant and, formerly, the well-known British dance music vocalist Tara McDonald. The music director is David Arch. Tommy Blaize has been part of &quot;Strictly&quot; since its beginning. David Arch joined in the fourth series and Hayley Sanderson in the fifth. The original musical director from series 1 to 3 was Laurie Holloway. In the seventeenth series, the singers were joined by Mitchell.

The show was broadcast from a specially constructed set at BBC Television Centre (primarily in the largest studio, TC1) until its closure in 2013, with the show moving to Elstree Studios&#x27; George Lucas Stage 2 from 2013 onwards. However, in the first two series, shows were also filmed at the Tower Ballroom in Blackpool, where the original &quot;Come Dancing&quot; series was filmed in the 1970s.

In the second series, two shows were filmed at the Tower Ballroom – show five and the Grand Final, which was broadcast live on 11 December 2004. In 2005 though the BBC announced that they would not be returning to the venue for the third series due to &quot;logistical problems&quot;. In October 2008, Craig Revel Horwood called for the series to return to the Tower Ballroom, saying, &quot;The atmosphere was electric. It&#x27;s huge and has so much history. The Tower Ballroom puts a lot of pressure on the professionals and the celebrities to perform to the best of their potential. What a wonderful place to go live to 12 million people. We have got to get the BBC to bring Strictly Come Dancing back to Blackpool.&quot; Eventually, for series 7, the show did return to the Tower Ballroom, where Blackpool-born Craig Kelly was eliminated. The episode was aired live on 7 November 2009. &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; returned to Blackpool for the 2010 and 2011 series. After series 10, when &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; did not go to Blackpool, they announced that they would return for series 11.

===Presenters and judges===
;Colour key:
;Notes
===Professional dancers===
Each season, celebrities are paired with professional dance partners who instruct them in the various dance styles, design their choreography, and perform with them each week in the competition.
Many of the dancers from the show have formed both professional and personal partnerships. Darren Bennett and Lilia Kopylova are married, as are James and Ola Jordan. Aljaž Škorjanec and Janette Manrara, who became engaged after joining the show in 2013, were married in 2017. Matthew and Nicole Cutler are divorced, but remain professional partners; Karen Hauer and Kevin Clifton were engaged when Clifton entered the show in 2013 and were married prior to the 2015 series, before divorcing in 2018, while Neil and Katya Jones entered the show as a married couple before separating in 2019. Anton Du Beke and Erin Boag have danced as a professional couple since 1997, while Vincent Simone and Flavia Cacace are former Argentine tango world champions as a duo and have done multiple tours together. Brendan Cole and Camilla Dallerup danced together for many years, including a stint on the original series of &quot;Come Dancing&quot;; following their split in 2004, Cole and Katya Virshilas formed a professional partnership before splitting in November 2009. Other current and former professional partnerships featured on the show include Dallerup and Ian Waite, Paul Killick and Hanna Karttunen, Andrew Cuerden and Hanna Haarala, Brian Fortuna and Kristina Rihanoff, Rihanoff and Robin Windsor, Pasha Kovalev and Anya Garnis, siblings Kevin and Joanne Clifton, AJ Pritchard and Chloe Hewitt, and Gorka Márquez and Karen Hauer.

== Presentation ==

===Dances===
On average, dances last for approximately 90 seconds. Musical accompaniment is provided by The Strictly Come Dancing Band.

===Results show===
From series 1 to 4, the results show was shown live on Saturday night one hour after the performances.

As of series 5, the results show is recorded on the Saturday night directly after the live show and incorporates the result of the viewers&#x27; votes, which are completed by 21:30. This was confirmed by the official BBC website in 2008:

Throughout the Sunday results show, the presenters refer to &#x27;Saturday night&#x27; in reference to the main show due to the timing of the Sunday programme, and the outfits of Tess Daly, Claudia Winkleman and the judges are changed to present an illusion of a second live broadcast.

For series 7, the Sunday results show was axed and put back to Saturday nights as a result of a revamp of the show. It then reverted to Sundays from series 8.

===Dance-off===

A new system called the Dance-off, which takes place in the results show, was introduced in series 5. It continued until series 7, but did not return in series 8. It was then reinstated in series 10 and has remained a feature of the show ever since.

The Dance-off consists of the two couples who received the lowest totals that week from the combined judges&#x27; scores and public vote. The aim of the dance-off is for the couples to convince the judges that they deserve to go through to the following week&#x27;s competition. Before they attempt their dance a second time, the couples sometimes get advice from the judges. The judges then decide which couple remains in the competition based on the dance-off performances. If three of the judges agree that one of the couples should be saved, that couple is through to the following week&#x27;s competition and the Head Judge&#x27;s vote is not counted. If one couple has two votes and the other couple has one vote, then the deciding vote is cast by the head judge, originally Len Goodman and currently Shirley Ballas. Afterwards, the eliminated couple perform one final dance – sometimes known as &quot;waltzing out of the ballroom&quot;. The Monday after their elimination, they appear on &quot;It Takes Two&quot; to discuss their time on the programme.

On two occasions, the dance-off was cancelled; firstly, in series 14, in which one of the celebrity contestants, Anastacia, sustained an injury and was unable to compete in the Dance-off as a result. Under the rules of the show, the couple with the lowest combined total was eliminated. The second occasion in which the Dance-off was cancelled was in Series 20, again due to an injury sustained by Tony Adams. Tess Daly announced on the results show that Adams had decided to withdraw from the competition as a result of being unable to compete in the Dance-off.

===&quot;It Takes Two&quot;===

During the run of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, &quot;Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two&quot; is broadcast each weeknight on BBC Two. The series was previously hosted by Claudia Winkleman but, due to her pregnancy in 2011, she had to leave the series, and was replaced by Zoe Ball, who hosted the show from Series 9 to 18. Rylan Clark-Neal joined as co-host in series 17. In May 2021, it was announced that Ball was to leave the show after 10 years, and on 10 June 2021, her replacement was confirmed to be former professional Janette Manrara.

The show features reviews of the performances during the previous Saturday&#x27;s show and interviews with, and training footage of, the couples preparing for the next show. The judges and other celebrities also provide their opinions on how the couples are progressing. &quot;It Takes Two&quot; replaced &quot;Strictly Come Dancing on Three&quot;, hosted by Justin Lee Collins, which ran on BBC Three during the first series. Prior to 2010, BBC Two Scotland aired the programme on four nights only, running its own Gaelic-language programming on Thursdays instead.

Additionally, the two couples at the bottom of the table after the public vote were subject to a dance-off, where they performed their routine again for the judges, who decided which couple would leave the competition.

===Series 6 (2008)===

A sixth series was confirmed after the dancers&#x27; pay dispute was called off in June 2008. The sixth series began in September with a behind-the-scenes look at the new series, while the first live show aired on 20 September.

The series started on 7 September 2014 with a launch show, followed by the live shows starting on 26 and 27 September. This series was the first not to be presented by Sir Bruce Forsyth after announcing his departure from the live shows on 4 April (he made his final regular appearance in this series&#x27; launch show). However, Forsyth would continue to present special editions of the show, such as Children in Need and Christmas specials. It was announced on 9 May that Claudia Winkleman would join the main show as co-presenter and that her duties would mirror the existing result show format, with Tess Daly taking over Forsyth&#x27;s role as main presenter and Winkleman taking Daly&#x27;s role as co-presenter.

It was announced on 1 June 2014 that professional dancers Artem Chigvintsev, James Jordan and Anya Garnis would not be returning for the new series, although Garnis would remain on the show&#x27;s choreography team. It was also announced that Tristan MacManus and Joanne Clifton would be joining the show&#x27;s professional line-up. It was then announced in August that Robin Windsor had pulled out of the competition due to a back injury. Windsor was replaced by new professional Trent Whiddon. In week three, entertainer Donny Osmond joined the four regular judges, making the maximum score that week 50 points. Due to Winkleman&#x27;s absence in weeks 6, 7 and 8, &quot;It Takes Two&quot; presenter Zoë Ball co-presented with Daly.

===Series 13 (2015)===

&quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; returned for its thirteenth series with a launch show on 5 September 2015, followed by the live shows starting on 25 and 26 September.

On 23 April 2015, the list of professionals participating in the thirteenth series was revealed. Professionals from the last series who did not return included Trent Whiddon, Iveta Lukošiūtė and Joanne Clifton. Clifton would remain involved in group dances and would feature on &quot;Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two&quot; as a dance expert. Robin Windsor, absent from the previous series because of injury, also did not return for this series. Three new professional dancers were introduced: Russian dancer Gleb Savchenko (from the American, Australian and Russian versions of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;), South African dancer Oti Mabuse (from Germany&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;) and Italian dancer Giovanni Pernice.

On 3 October 2015, the judges performed The Strictly, a signature dance made up of some iconic moves from the show&#x27;s history for fans to do at home when they hear the theme tune; subsequently, a tutorial for the dance was made available on the show&#x27;s website and iPlayer hosted by Natalie Lowe and Tristan MacManus.

Series 13 was the last to feature Tristan MacManus, Kristina Rihanoff, Ola Jordan, Gleb Savchenko and Aliona Vilani as professional dancers. Jordan later announced that she had quit the show, claiming that the results were &quot;fixed&quot;. Vilani announced three days after winning that she was leaving the show; however, she participated in the 2016 live tour. Savchenko announced that he was leaving the show on 28 June 2016.

===Series 14 (2016)===

&quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; returned for its fourteenth series with a launch show on 3 September 2016 on BBC One. This was Len Goodman&#x27;s final series as head judge.

On 28 June 2016, the list of professionals who were returning for the fourteenth series was revealed. Professionals from the last series who would not return included the previous series&#x27; champion and two-time professional winner of the show Aliona Vilani, former professional winner Ola Jordan and two-time professional finalist Kristina Rihanoff, as well as Gleb Savchenko and Tristan MacManus. Joanne Clifton returned after a one-series hiatus. The leaving professionals were replaced by Katya Jones, &quot;Burn the Floor&quot; dancer Gorka Márquez and former &quot;Dancing with the Stars US&quot; troupe member Oksana Platero. On 26 July 2016, three more new professional dancers – AJ Pritchard, Chloe Hewitt and Neil Jones, husband of new dancer Katya – were announced. Hewitt and Neil Jones did not partner a celebrity as the professionals outnumbered the celebrities, although they were still in group dances and appeared on &quot;It Takes Two&quot;.

===Series 15 (2017)===

On 4 May 2017, it was announced that series 7 finalist Natalie Lowe would be departing the show. Five days later, on 9 May, Shirley Ballas announced that she would be replacing Len Goodman as head judge. On 21 June 2017, Oksana Platero and the previous series&#x27; professional champion, Joanne Clifton, announced that they would also be leaving. The new professionals replacing them were Australian Open champion Dianne Buswell, Welsh dancer Amy Dowden, and Ukrainian two-time world champion Nadiya Bychkova. On 7 August, Nick Grimshaw announced that Mollie King was the first celebrity known to be taking part in the series. This was the first series to be broadcast since Sir Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s death in August that year.

===Series 16 (2018)===

On 30 January 2018, it was announced that Brendan Cole would no longer appear on the show. On 30 May 2018, the full lineup of professional dancers was announced. Chloe Hewitt left the series and three new professional dancers – Graziano Di Prima, Johannes Radebe and Luba Mushtuk – were announced to be joining the show. This meant that there were 18 professional dancers, the most in the show&#x27;s history.

===Series 17 (2019)===

On 13 February 2019, professional dancer Pasha Kovalev announced that he was leaving the show after competing on it for eight years. On 10 April 2019, it was announced that judge Darcey Bussell had left the show after seven years. On 22 July 2019, Motsi Mabuse was announced as the replacement for Bussell. On 30 July 2019, it was announced that Nancy Xu would be joining the cast of professional dancers. On 5 September 2019, it was announced that Jamie Laing had withdrawn from the show due to a foot injury. He was later replaced by Kelvin Fletcher. In late October, Will Bayley left the competition due to a sustained leg injury.

===Series 18 (2020)===

On 6 March 2020, Kevin Clifton announced that he was leaving the show after seven years. On 26 March 2020, AJ Pritchard also announced that he was leaving the show after four years. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was confirmed that the series would be slightly shorter than planned. Before the series began, the professional dancers and some of the crew isolated and tested for COVID-19 to then become a household. &quot;Strictly&quot; took over a hotel near the studios and the pro dancers learnt and filmed all the group routines for the series at once. This allowed for the show to still include the professional group dances each week. On 21 August 2020, it was announced that Bruno Tonioli would not be on the judging panel but would appear virtually while he filmed &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in the US. It was the first series since 2012 to begin in October. On 12 November 2020, Nicola Adams and Katya Jones were forced to withdraw from the competition after Jones tested positive for COVID-19. On 19 December 2020, Bill Bailey and Oti Mabuse were crowned the winners of the series, making Mabuse the second professional dancer to win the show twice and the first to win it consecutively, following her 2019 victory. This series featured the first all-female and same-sex partnership of Nicola Adams and Katya Jones.

===Series 19 (2021)===

On 10 June 2021, it was announced that Janette Manrara would leave the show as a professional dancer and replace Zoe Ball as a new &quot;It Takes Two&quot; presenter. On 24 June, Anton Du Beke was announced as having joined the judging panel for this series instead of returning as a professional dancer, replacing Bruno Tonioli, who missed a second year due to continuing travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the remaining fourteen professional dancers from Series 18, all of whom returned for this series, four new professional dancers joined the show: Cameron Lombard, Jowita Przystał, Kai Widdrington and Nikita Kuzmin.

This series marked the first time that two contestants withdrew from the competition. On 13 October 2021, Robert Webb withdrew from the competition for health reasons. On 17 December 2021, AJ Odudu was forced to pull out of the final after tearing a ligament in her right ankle.

The series saw the first couple with a deaf contestant, actress Rose Ayling-Ellis and the first all-male partnership of John Whaite and Johannes Radebe.

===Series 20 (2022)===

The twentieth series began in September 2022.

===Series 21 (2023)===

The twenty-first series began in September 2023.

In April 2023, Rylan Clark announced that he was stepping down as co-host of &quot;It Takes Two&quot;. Fleur East, who was one of the finalists in series 20, was later announced as his replacement.

===Series 22 (2024)===

The twenty-second series began in September 2024.

===Specials===

Since the inception of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in 2004, several special editions of the show have been transmitted by the BBC each year. These have included seasonal specials, charity specials, and variations of the &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; format.

==&quot;Strictly Come Dancing Live!&quot; ==

&quot;Strictly Come Dancing Live!&quot; is a nationwide arena tour staged every year since 2008.

== Controversies ==
=== 2008 voting system ===
On 13 December 2008, &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; became the subject of press attention and viewer complaints about an error in the voting system during the semi-final of series six. In the show, three couples remained in the competition. After all three had performed and the judges had given their scores, two of the couples were in joint-first position on the leaderboard, with Tom Chambers and Camilla Dallerup in last place. This meant that, no matter how many public votes were cast in their favour, it was mathematically impossible for Chambers and Dallerup to avoid the dance-off. This oversight was initially unnoticed by producers until after the public vote became live and viewers were invited to call in and save their favourites at a cost of 15p per vote. Once the mistake was finally realised and the public vote was closed, it was announced that all three couples would be put through to the final, all the votes already cast would count towards the final result of the competition, and viewers could apply for a refund if they wished.

The BBC received 1800 complaints about the incident, while media regulator Ofcom received 297. Jon Beazley, the BBC&#x27;s Head of Entertainment Production, was interviewed on &quot;Strictly&quot;&#x27;s spin-off show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two&quot; on 15 December. He apologised for the oversight, referring to it as an &quot;unprecedented situation&quot;. On the same day, the BBC posted a statement on its website, which clarified that an independent adjudicator had been consulted to reach a solution that would offer &quot;fairness to the viewers who voted and the contestants themselves&quot;. The BBC also stated that, following the mistake, &quot;the voting and judging mechanisms used in all BBC voting programmes [had] been thoroughly examined&quot;.

After conducting an investigation, Ofcom concluded that &quot;the mistake had resulted from an oversight, rather than any shortcomings in the technical arrangements for voting or in the handling of votes received&quot;, and that they were &quot;satisfied that appropriate steps were taken by the BBC and the disadvantage to viewers minimised&quot;. Ofcom also opined that &quot;the BBC had been open and transparent with viewers about the mistake it made and the solution adopted&quot;.

=== Sacking of Arlene Phillips ===
In June 2009, tabloid newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; reported that the then 66-year-old judge Arlene Phillips, who had judged the show since its inception in 2004, was to be replaced by series five winner Alesha Dixon, then aged 30. This was later confirmed by the BBC in July of that year. Subsequently, the BBC was accused of ageism and sexism by several sources, an accusation the corporation has faced before over the removal of several older female presenters, including Moira Stuart, Juliet Morris, Miriam O&#x27;Reilly, Michaela Strachan, Charlotte Smith and Anna Ford. The BBC denied the allegations that the decision to remove Phillips was due to her age.

Furthermore, Dixon herself was criticised after the debut episode of the seventh series, the first to feature her as a judge. A total of 272 complaints were received by the BBC – bringing the total number about Dixon joining the programme to over 4000 – along with over 5000 comments on &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;&#x27;s internet message board. Dixon was compared unfavourably to Phillips, with claims that the former was &quot;unsuitable&quot;, &quot;unqualified&quot; and lacked &quot;knowledge, experience and talent&quot;. However, Dixon was praised and defended from her critics by the BBC, by fellow judge Craig Revel Horwood and by Phillips herself.

=== 2009 racism scandal ===
In 2009, during the seventh series, professional dancer Anton Du Beke issued a public apology for his use of a racial slur during a conversation with his dance partner Laila Rouass. Rouass accepted his apology and said that he should &quot;[a]bsolutely not&quot; be fired: &quot;Anton has apologised and I&#x27;ve accepted it. This happened a couple of weeks ago now and we are just having a really good time. We just want to move on from it.&quot; Over 600 complaints were received by the BBC, including those about comments Bruce Forsyth, then host of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, made about the controversy on a Talksport radio programme, in which he suggested that Britain &quot;used to have a sense of humour&quot; about such incidents, and that Du Beke&#x27;s apology should be accepted.

Following the incident, and Forsyth&#x27;s response, the BBC stated:Racially offensive language in the workplace is entirely unacceptable. Anton was right to apologise quickly and without reservation and Laila has wholly accepted his apology. Everyone is very clear that there can be no repetition of this behaviour.Forsyth also clarified his position:What Anton said to Laila was wrong and he has apologised unreservedly for this. Nor do I in any way excuse or condone the use of such language. To be absolutely clear, the use of racially offensive language is never either funny or acceptable. However, there is a major difference between this and racist comments which are malicious in intent and whilst I accept that we live in a world of extraordinary political correctness, we should keep things in perspective.

=== Same-sex couples ===
In 2015, in an interview with the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, &quot;Egghead&quot; C. J. de Mooi said that he was turned down for the show because he had wanted to dance with a same-sex partner. The BBC denied that de Mooi had ever been under consideration for the show, and also declared that &quot;&quot;Strictly&quot; is a family show and we have chosen the traditional format of mixed-sex couples&quot;. The press has reported on the issue on numerous occasions when gay celebrities have appeared on the show, including Will Young, Susan Calman, Robert Rinder, Richard Coles and Ranj Singh. &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; judges Shirley Ballas and Craig Revel Horwood have both expressed their support for introducing same-sex couples.

Same-sex partnerships have been featured on several international versions of the show, including Italy (2018), Australia (2019) and Denmark (2019). On 3 November 2019, Johannes Radebe and fellow professional Graziano Di Prima performed together to Emeli Sandé&#x27;s &quot;Shine&quot; on the Sunday results episode, the show&#x27;s first individual same-sex dance. On 2 September 2020, it was announced that boxer Nicola Adams would feature in the show&#x27;s first same-sex couple for its eighteenth series. She was partnered with professional dancer Katya Jones. In 2021, it was announced that John Whaite would feature in the first all-male same-sex couple with Johannes Radebe for the nineteenth series, with the two of them eventually finishing as the runners-up. The United States version of the show would also have a same-sex couple that same year, with JoJo Siwa &amp; Jenna Johnson. Series 20 also included same-sex partnerships with Richie Anderson and Giovanni Pernice in an all-male partnership and Jayde Adams and Karen Hauer in an all-female partnership. In Series 21, Layton Williams and Nikita Kuzmin competed as an all-male partnership, eventually finishing as one of the two runners-up couples.

===Professional dancers&#x27; misconduct ===
In January 2024, &quot;The Sun&quot; reported that Amanda Abbington requested footage of her time training with Giovanni Pernice and was seeking legal advice over his training methods. In March 2024, &quot;The Sun&quot; said that Abbington, Laura Whitmore and Ranvir Singh had met to discuss their negative experiences with Pernice on the show. Legal firm Carter Ruck told BBC News there were &quot;numerous serious complaints&quot; about his behaviour while filming &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. On 16 May, it was reported by &quot;The Sun&quot; that Pernice had quit the show. Pernice denied all accusations of wrongdoing. His departure was confirmed by the BBC on 10 June.

In July 2024, the BBC&#x27;s probe into misconduct brought further claims made by production staff, who observed Graziano Di Prima&#x27;s behaviour towards dance partner Zara McDermott during the 2023 series. A source speaking to &quot;The Sun&quot; claimed that footage showing Di Prima&#x27;s alleged treatment of McDermott &quot;reduced those who have seen it to tears&quot;. In a statement Di Prima said that he &quot;deeply regretted his actions that led to his departure from [the show]&quot;. The BBC has announced that Di Prima has left the show, and in the future a member of the production team would be present at all times during rehearsals.

A third professional dancer has been identified as a &quot;person of interest&quot;.

==Ratings==
An example of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;″s popularity is that, after episodes, electricity use in the United Kingdom rises significantly as viewers who have waited for the show to end begin boiling water for tea, a phenomenon known as TV pick-up. National Grid personnel watch the show to know when closing credits begin so they can prepare for the surge.

All ratings are from BARB. Series averages exclude Christmas special and launch show.
==Awards==
The show has won a highly prestigious Rose D&#x27;Or award for &#x27;Best Variety Show&#x27;, beating off competition from reality shows from twelve other different countries. It has also won two awards for &#x27;Best Reality Show&#x27; at the TRIC Awards and two at the TV Quick Awards for &#x27;Best Talent Show&#x27;. It has also received four BAFTA Award nominations.

The show won the award of &#x27;Most Popular Talent Show&#x27; at the National Television Awards in 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 , 2023 and 2024

In the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; 2010 edition, the format of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; was named the most successful television show with the format being sold to more than 38 countries worldwide.

==&quot;Strictly Come Dancing: The Game&quot;==
In 2016, BBC Worldwide commissioned a match-3 mobile app game published by Donut Publishing and developed by Exient Entertainment. The game uses a mix of hand animation and motion-captured data for all the dances in the game, using pro dancers from the show (Chloe Hewitt and Neil Jones). The mo-cap process was featured on &quot;It Takes Two&quot; in the build-up to the release of the app. The game features over 150 dresses and 9 dances: Quickstep, Jive, Tango, Salsa, Charleston, Viennese Waltz, Rumba, Cha Cha Cha, and Paso Doble. It was released on the App Store and Google Play in early 2016 and is regularly updated with new dance features alongside new seasons of the show.

<doc id="975337" wikidata="Q1234407" url="?curid=975337" title="The F.B.I. (TV series)">
<text>The F.B.I. is an American police procedural television series created by Quinn Martin and Philip Saltzman for ABC and co-produced with Warner Bros. Television, with sponsorship from the Ford Motor Company, Alcoa and American Tobacco Company (Tareyton and Pall Mall brands) in the first season. Ford sponsored the show alone for subsequent seasons. The series was broadcast on ABC from 1965 until its end in 1974. Starring Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Philip Abbott and William Reynolds, the series, consisting of nine seasons and 241 episodes, chronicles a group of FBI agents trying to defend the American government from unidentified threats. For the entirety of its run, it was broadcast on Sunday nights.

==Premise==
Produced by Quinn Martin and based in part on concepts from the 1959 Warner Bros. theatrical film &quot;The FBI Story&quot;, the series was based on actual FBI cases, with fictitious main characters carrying the stories. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. played Inspector Lewis Erskine, a widower whose wife had been killed in an ambush meant for him. Philip Abbott played Arthur Ward, assistant director to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Although Hoover served as series consultant until his death in 1972, he never appeared in the series.

Stephen Brooks played Inspector Erskine&#x27;s assistant, Special Agent Jim Rhodes, for the first two seasons. Lynn Loring played Inspector Erskine&#x27;s daughter and Rhodes&#x27; love interest, Barbara, in the twelve episodes of the show&#x27;s first season. Although the couple were soon engaged on the show, that romantic angle was soon dropped.

In 1967, Brooks was replaced by William Reynolds, who played Special Agent Tom Colby until 1973. The series would enjoy its highest ratings during this time, peaking at No. 10 in the 1970–1971 season. For the final season, Shelly Novack played Special Agent Chris Daniels.

Some episodes ended with a &quot;most wanted&quot; segment hosted by Zimbalist, noting the FBI&#x27;s most wanted criminals of the day, decades before the Fox Network aired &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. The most famous instance was in the April 21, 1968, episode, when Zimbalist asked for information about fugitive James Earl Ray, who was being hunted for the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.

The series aired on ABC at 8 p.m. Sunday from 1965 to 1973, when it was moved up to 7:30 p.m. for the final season. The series was a co-production of Quinn Martin Productions and Warner Bros. Television, as Warner Bros. held the television and theatrical rights to any project based on &quot;The FBI Story&quot;. It was the longest-running of all of Quinn Martin&#x27;s television series, airing nine seasons.

Every detail of every episode of the series was carefully vetted by F.B.I. second-in-command Clyde Tolson. Actors playing F.B.I. agents, and other participants, were given background checks to guarantee that no &quot;criminals, subversives, or Communists&quot; were associated with the show. The premiere episode of the first season, &quot;The Monster,&quot; about a handsome serial killer who strangled women with their own hair, so shocked Tolson that he recommended the show be cancelled. J. Edgar Hoover attempted to cancel the show on at least seven other occasions. Upon Tolson&#x27;s direction, the violence in the show was severely curtailed in the final three seasons.

Warner Bros. (under the Warner Home Video label) has released all nine seasons of &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; on DVD in region 1 via their Warner Archive Collection. These are Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) releases and are available through Warner&#x27;s online store and Amazon.com. The ninth and final season was released on September 23, 2014.

* An updated and revamped version of the series, &quot;Today&#x27;s FBI&quot;, executive produced by David Gerber for Columbia Pictures Television, aired on ABC from October 1981 through April 1982 in the same Sunday 8 p.m. time slot as its predecessor.
* A remake of the original series, produced by Ron Howard&#x27;s Imagine Entertainment for Fox, was set for air in Fall 2008, but it didn&#x27;t materialise.
* In September 2018, a similar series, titled &quot;FBI&quot;, debuted on CBS; this series was co-created by Dick Wolf and Craig Turk for Universal Television. Unlike &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; and &quot;Today&#x27;s FBI&quot;, however, the cases presented are largely fictional. Would be followed by two spinoffs: &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="975338" wikidata="Q25686" url="?curid=975338" title="Artemisia absinthium">
<text>Artemisia absinthium, otherwise known as common wormwood, is a species of &quot;Artemisia&quot; native to North Africa and temperate regions of Eurasia, and widely naturalized in Canada and the northern United States. It is grown as an ornamental plant and is used as an ingredient in the spirit absinthe and some other alcoholic beverages.

==Etymology==
Wormwood&#x27;s relative mugwort was traditionally used as a remedy for a variety of complaints, especially those of a gynaecological nature, and so the wormwood genus bears the name of the Greek goddess of childbirth, Artemis. The specific name derives from &quot;apsínthion&quot;, the Greek term for the plant.

&quot;Wormwood&quot; itself is an alteration of Old English &quot;wermod&quot;, which is of obscure origin. The German cognate &quot;Wermut&quot; is the source of the term vermouth, used in French and English to describe a kind of wine traditionally flavoured with wormwood.

==Description==
&quot;A. absinthium&quot; is a herbaceous perennial plant with fibrous roots. The stems are straight, growing to (and rarely over ) tall, grooved, branched, and silvery-green.

Leaves are spirally arranged, greenish-grey colored above, white below, covered with silky silvery-white trichomes, and bearing minute oil-producing glands. The basal leaves are up to long, bi- to tripinnate with long petioles, with the cauline leaves (those on the stem) smaller, long, less divided, and with short petioles. The uppermost leaves can be both simple and sessile (without a petiole).

Flowers are pale yellow, tubular, and clustered in spherical bent-down heads (capitula), which are in turn clustered in leafy and branched panicles. Flowering occurs from early summer to early autumn; pollination is anemophilous. The fruit is a small achene. Seed dispersal occurs by gravity.

&quot;A. absinthium&quot; grows naturally on uncultivated arid ground, on rocky slopes, and at the edge of footpaths and fields. Although once relatively common, it is becoming increasingly rare in Britain, where it has recently been suggested to be an archaeophyte rather than a true native.

==Cultivation==

The plant can easily be cultivated in dry soil. It should be planted under bright exposure in fertile, midweight soil. It prefers soil rich in nitrogen, and can be propagated by ripened cuttings taken in spring or autumn in temperate climates, or by seeds in nursery beds. Growing the plant with others tends to stunt their growth; accordingly, it is not considered to be a good companion plant. &quot;A. absinthium&quot; also self-seeds generously. It is naturalised in some areas away from its native range, including much of North America and Kashmir Valley of India.

This plant, and its cultivars &quot;Lambrook Mist&quot; and &quot;Lambrook Silver&quot; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. These two short cultivars are very similar and more silver than typical British absinthium material and probably derive from southern Europe. &quot;Lambrook Silver&quot; is the earliest of these cultivars, having been selected in the late 1950s by Margery Fish, who developed the garden at East Lambrook Manor. &quot;Lambrook Mist&quot; was selected about 30 years later by Andrew Norton, a subsequent owner of the garden. Both gained their Awards of Garden Merit during the RHS Artemisia Trial 1991–3.

Cultivar &quot;Silver Ghost&quot; is a taller, silver plant, which flowers much later (August–September) than typical absinthium (June–July) in Britain, so holds its silver appearance for longer. This and a more feathery-leaved cultivar &quot;Persian Lace&quot; were selected by National Collection Holder John Twibell in the 1990s.

==Constituents==
Wormwood herb contains bitter substances from the group of sesquiterpene lactones; absinthin, at 0.20 to 0.28%, is the main component of these bitter substances. Essential oils make up 0.2 to 0.8% and contain (-) - thujone, (+) - isothujone, thujyl alcohol and its esters, chamazulene and other mono- and sesquiterpenes. In Bailen et al 2013 and Gonzalez-Coloma et al 2013 the Gonzalez-Coloma group discovered a chemotype that does not produce β-thujone but does contain terpenoids not seen elsewhere.

==Uses==
Artemisia absinthium is claimed to have antifungal, neuroprotective, insecticidal, antimicrobial, anthelmintic, acaricidal, antimalarial, antidepressant, and hepatoprotective properties.

It is an ingredient in the spirit absinthe, and is used for flavouring in some other spirits and wines, including bitters, bäsk, vermouth, and pelinkovac. As medicine, it is used for dyspepsia, as a bitter to counteract poor appetite, for various infectious diseases, Crohn&#x27;s disease, and IgA nephropathy.

Wormwood was traditionally relatively common as a bittering spice in farmhouse brewing in Denmark, and to some extent Estonia. In 18th-century England, wormwood was sometimes used instead of hops in beer. According to Nicholas Culpeper, a stinking breath can be cured by &quot;drinking a glass of Wormwood beer every morning&quot;.

Wormwood clippings and cuttings are added to chicken nesting boxes to repel lice, mites, and fleas. Bailen &quot;et al.&quot; 2013 and Gonzalez-Coloma &quot;et al.&quot; 2013 find the unique terpenoids of the Gonzalez-Coloma chemotype make this strain especially promising for insect control. a company named EcoflorAgro is investing heavily into increasing the planted area of this strain, hoping to commercialize it to a degree attempted but never achieved due to unreliable supply for other botanical insecticides before.

==Toxicity==
Most chemotypes of &quot;A. absinthium&quot; contain (−)-α- and/or (+)-β-thujone, though some do not. (−)-α-Thujone by itself is a GABA receptor antagonist that can cause convulsions and death when administered in large amounts to animals and humans. However, there is only one case of documented toxicity of wormwood involving a 31-year-old man who drank 10 mL of steam-distilled volatile oil of wormwood, wrongly believing it was absinthe liqueur. Medicinal extracts of wormwood have not been shown to cause seizure or other adverse effects at usual doses. Thujones have not been shown to be the cause of excessive doses&#x27; toxicity for any kind of wormwood extracts, including absinthe.

==Cultural history==
Nicholas Culpeper insisted that wormwood was the key to understanding his 1651 book &quot;The English Physitian&quot;. Richard Mabey describes Culpeper&#x27;s entry on this bitter-tasting plant as &quot;stream-of-consciousness&quot; and &quot;unlike anything else in the herbal&quot;, and states that it reads &quot;like the ramblings of a drunk&quot;. Culpeper biographer Benjamin Woolley suggests the piece may be an allegory about bitterness, as Culpeper had spent his life fighting the Establishment, and had been imprisoned and seriously wounded in battle as a result.

William Shakespeare referred to wormwood in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;: Act 1, Scene 3. Juliet&#x27;s childhood nurse said, &quot;For I had then laid wormwood to my dug&quot; meaning that the nurse had weaned Juliet, then aged three, by using the bitter taste of wormwood on her nipple. He also referred to wormwood in &quot;Hamlet&quot;: Act 3, Scene 2. Hamlet said, &quot;That&#x27;s wormwood&quot; in response to the Player Queen expressing distaste for remarriage.

John Locke, in his 1689 book titled &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;, used wormwood as an example of bitterness, writing, &quot;For a child knows as certainly before it can speak the difference between the ideas of sweet and bitter (i.e. that sweet is not bitter), as it knows afterwards (when it comes to speak) that wormwood and sugarplums are not the same thing.&quot;

Edwin Arlington Robinson relates in a poem how Cliff Klingenhagen gave a guest a glass of wine while drinking a glass of wormwood himself. He concludes, &quot;I have spent / Long time a-wondering when I shall be / As happy as Cliff Klingenhagen is.&quot;

In the apocalyptic Book of Revelation ending the Bible, the star named &quot;Wormwood&quot; falls to earth and turns a third of its waters bitter. Similarly where the Biblical Hebrew word לענה (&quot;la&#x27;anah&quot;) appears in the Hebrew Bible, it is generally translated into English as &quot;wormwood&quot;.

<text>William Edgar Rayner Goddard, Baron Goddard, (10 April 1877 – 29 May 1971) was Lord Chief Justice of England from 1946 to 1958, known for his strict sentencing and mostly conservative views despite being the first Lord Chief Justice to be appointed by a Labour government, as well as the first to possess a law degree. Goddard&#x27;s no-nonsense reputation was reflected in a number of nicknames that he acquired, which included: &#x27;The Tiger&#x27;, &#x27;Justice-in-a-jiffy&#x27;, and—from Winston Churchill—&#x27;Lord God-damn&#x27;. He is considered one of the last hanging judges.

==Early life and career==

William Edgar Rayner Goddard was born on 10 April 1877 at Bassett Road, Notting Hill, London, the second of three sons and the third of five children of the solicitor Charles Goddard (22 February 1843 – 27 May 1922) and his wife Janet née Jobson, who was from Sheffield (1851 – 8 June 1934). He went by his third name Rayner throughout his life.

Goddard attended Marlborough College, where he decided on a career in law. In later life he vigorously denied the frequent claims of Lord Jowitt that he had amused his school contemporaries by reciting, word for word, the form of the death sentence upon those whom he disliked. He later attended Trinity College, Oxford and graduated with an upper second-class degree in jurisprudence in 1898, and gained a Blue in athletics. He was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1899.

On 31 May 1906 Goddard married Marie Schuster, the daughter of the banker Sir Felix Otto Schuster, with whom he was to have three daughters. She died on 16 May 1928 during an operation at the age of 44. Goddard never remarried.

Goddard built a strong reputation in commercial cases on the Western Circuit and was appointed as Recorder of Poole (a part-time Judgeship) in 1917. Goddard was appointed a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1923, transferred to be Recorder of Bath in 1925, and eventually Recorder of Plymouth in 1928. He was elected a Bencher of his inns in 1929 and undertook work for the Barristers&#x27; Benevolent Association. In the general election of 1929, Goddard agreed, against his better judgement, to contest the Kensington South constituency as an unofficial Conservative candidate. The sitting Conservative MP, Sir William Davison, had been a defendant in a divorce case, and a local committee thought the newly enfranchised young women voters would refuse to support him. In the end, Goddard, running under the slogan &quot;Purity Goddard&quot;, came last in the poll, winning only 15 per cent of the vote, and the sitting member was returned.

==Judicial appointment==
On 5 April 1932 Goddard was appointed a Justice of the High Court and assigned to the King&#x27;s Bench Division, receiving the customary knighthood later that year. As a judge of the first instance, Goddard acquired a good reputation as a commercial judge, who conducted trials with efficiency and had little tolerance for dilatory practices.

In 1938, the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act authorized the appointment of three additional Lords Justices of Appeal: Goddard was one of the three new Lords Justices appointed under the Act, after only six years in the High Court. During the Second World War, he also sat as a supplementary judge in the King&#x27;s Bench Division. In 1943, he conducted a Home Office inquiry into the use of corporal punishment by Hereford magistrates, later known as the &#x27;Hereford birching inquiry&#x27;.

Goddard was known for turning out well-argued and legally convincing judgments. He would deliver stern diatribes to criminals, but his sentences were usually moderate, even when he was personally offended by the crime. After another six-year stint, he was appointed as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary upon the death of Lord Atkin in 1944 and received a life peerage. He chose the title Baron Goddard of Aldbourne in the County of Wiltshire.

==Lord Chief Justice==
Viscount Caldecote, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, suffered a stroke in 1945 and suddenly resigned, creating a vacancy at an inopportune moment. The tradition was for the appointment to be a political one, with the Attorney-General stepping up to take it. However, Sir Hartley Shawcross was unwilling and considered too young. The appointment of a stop-gap candidate was expected. As Goddard explained in an August 1970 interview with David Yallop: &quot;They had to give the job to somebody. There wasn&#x27;t anybody else available, so Attlee appointed me.&quot; At the time Attlee and Goddard did not know each other.

The appointment, in January 1946, came at a time when the crime rate, and public concern over crime, were both increasing. Through his judgments, Goddard made it clear that he felt that stronger sentences were the way to tackle both. However, Goddard was also known to give young offenders probation rather than custodial sentences, if he believed that they would respond.

Despite his appointment as a stop-gap, Goddard served twelve and a half years as Lord Chief Justice before stepping down in September 1958.

===Drunk drivers===

On 5 December 1950 Goddard said that in most cases drunk drivers should be jailed.

===ID cards===

In June 1951, Goddard ruled in &quot;Willcock v Muckle&quot; that giving police the power to demand an ID card &quot;from all and sundry, for instance, from a lady who may leave her car outside a shop longer than she should&quot;, made people resentful of the police and &quot;inclines them to obstruct the police instead of to assist them.&quot; Therefore, for the police to demand that individuals show their ID cards was unlawful because it was not relevant to the purposes for which the card was adopted. ID cards, in force since the start of World War II, were abolished in February 1952.

===Craig and Bentley===

In December 1952 Goddard presided over the trial of Christopher Craig and Derek Bentley, accused of the murder of PC Sidney Miles at a Croydon warehouse on 2 November 1952. 16-year-old Craig had shot and killed PC Miles while resisting arrest on the roof of a factory he intended to break into. Bentley, who was 19 but of limited intelligence, had gone with him and was accused of urging Craig to shoot, having called out to him, &quot;let him have it, Chris&quot;, when a policeman, Sergeant Frederick Fairfax, asked Craig for the gun. Fairfax was wounded by Craig.

Lord Goddard directed the jury at the trial that, in law, Bentley was as guilty of firing the shot as Craig, even though there was contradictory evidence as to whether Bentley was aware that Craig was carrying a gun. During the trial, Goddard made no reference to Bentley&#x27;s mental state, apart from when Christmas Humphreys asked Bentley to read a statement he had allegedly made to police officers after his arrest. Goddard told Humphreys that Bentley couldn&#x27;t read.

After 75 minutes of deliberations, the jury returned a guilty verdict in respect of both defendants. Craig was too young for a death sentence, but Bentley was not. Nevertheless, the jury had exceptionally returned a plea of mercy in favour of Bentley along with the guilty verdict. The decision passed to the Home Secretary, David Maxwell Fyfe, to decide whether clemency should be granted. After reading Home Office psychiatric reports and a petition signed by 200 MPs, he rejected the request and Bentley was hanged by Albert Pierrepoint on 28 January 1953. Craig was sent to prison and released in 1963 after serving ten-and-a-half years. Derek Bentley had his conviction quashed in July 1998 with the appeal trial judge, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, noting that Lord Goddard had denied the defendant &quot;the fair trial which is the birthright of every British citizen.&quot;

===Political context===

Goddard chose to continue his involvement with trials on the front line, and opted to judge ordinary High Court cases as he was entitled to do.

He presided over the libel trial at which Harold Laski, Chairman of the Labour Party, attempted unsuccessfully to sue the &quot;Daily Express&quot; for damages when it quoted him as saying that the party must take power &quot;even if it means violence&quot;. On 13 June 1965, Goddard told Laski&#x27;s brother, Neville Laski, &quot;I didn&#x27;t agree with the findings of the jury. I have always been unhappy about the case and I often think about it. I can say it has been on my conscience. I want to add that your brother was not a good witness. He couldn&#x27;t answer simple yes or no when questioned and made long speeches. Slade was no match for Pat Hastings&quot;.

In 1948 backbench pressure in the House of Commons forced through an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill to the effect that capital punishment should be suspended for five years and all death sentences automatically commuted to life imprisonment. The Bill also sought to abolish judicial corporal punishment in both its then forms, the cat-o&#x27;-nine-tails and the birch. Goddard attacked the Bill in the House of Lords, making his maiden speech, saying he agreed with the abolition of the &quot;cat&quot; but not birching, which he regarded as an effective punishment for young offenders. He also disagreed with the automatic commutation of death sentences, believing that it was contrary to the Bill of Rights.

In a debate, he once referred to a case he had tried of an agricultural labourer who had assaulted a jeweller; Goddard gave him a short two months&#x27; imprisonment and twelve strokes of the birch because &quot;I was not then depriving the country of the services of a good agricultural labourer over the harvest&quot;. The suspension of capital punishment was reversed by 181 to 28, and a further amendment to retain the birch was also passed (though the Lords were later forced to give way on this issue). As the crime rate continued to rise, Goddard became convinced that the Criminal Justice Act 1948 was responsible as it was a &#x27;Gangster&#x27;s Charter&#x27;. He held a strong belief that punishment had to be punitive in order to be effective, a view also shared at the time by Lord Denning.

===Bodkin Adams case===

During the committal hearing of John Bodkin Adams on a charge of murder in January 1957, Goddard was seen dining with Sir Roland Gwynne (Mayor of Eastbourne from 1929 to 1931) and chairman of the local panel of magistrates, and ex-Attorney-General Hartley Shawcross at an hotel in Lewes: the subject of their conversation is unreported and unknown. Goddard had already appointed Mr Justice Devlin to try Adams&#x27;s case. Three months later, on 15 April, while the jury was out discussing the verdict on Adams&#x27;s first charge of murder, Goddard telephoned to Devlin to suggest to him, if Adams were found not guilty, to grant Adams bail before he was tried on a second count of murder. Devlin was at first surprised since a person accused of murder had never been given bail before in British legal history, but on consideration saw its merit, but this move has been plausibly suggested as a warning to the prosecution of strong judicial displeasure over the Attorney-General&#x27;s plan to proceed with the second indictment. As Lord Chief Justice, Goddard had a responsibility for the conduct of all courts in England and Wales, from magistrates&#x27; courts to the Court of Appeal.

Adams was acquitted on the first count of murder, and the second charge was controversially dropped via a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot;—an act by the prosecution that was later called by Devlin an &quot;abuse of process&quot;, saying: &quot;The use of nolle prosequi to conceal the deficiencies of the prosecution was an abuse of process, which left an innocent man under the suspicion that there might have been something in the talk of mass murder after all&quot;. The pathologist Francis Camps considered the deaths of up to of 163 of Adams&#x27; patients might be suspicious, but he only conducted post-mortem examinations on two of these which produced nothing of significance. The assistant investigating officer, Charles Hewett suspected political interference to ensure Adams&#x27; acquittal, rather than accepting that the police investigation was sloppy, and their case was weak.

A month after Adams&#x27; trial, on 10 May 1957, Goddard heard a contempt of court case against Rolls House Publishing, publishers of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and chain of newsagents W.H. Smith, who on 1 April during Adams&#x27;s trial had respectively published and distributed an issue of the magazine containing two paragraphs of material &quot;highly prejudicial to the accused&quot;, saying that Adams&#x27;s victim count could be &quot;as high as 400&quot;. Each company was fined £50. Goddard made no mention of his contact with Roland Gwynne or of a potential conflict of interest, if any existed.

==Retirement and death==

After his retirement as Lord Chief Justice, Goddard was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) on 30 September 1958. In January 1959, four months after retiring as Lord Chief Justice, Goddard resumed regular judicial sittings in the House of Lords, continuing until 1964 when he fully retired. During this period he was a member of the judicial committee of the House of Lords in several controversial appeal cases, including &quot;Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith&quot; (1961), &quot;Sykes v Director of Public Prosecutions&quot; (1962), and &quot;Attorney-General for Northern Ireland v Gallagher&quot; (1963). In April 1959 Goddard took the unprecedented step of returning to sit in the Court of Appeal for almost a year to help clear a backlog of appeal cases.

After retiring as Lord Chief Justice, Goddard continued to intervene occasionally in Lords debates and public speeches to put forward his views in favour of judicial corporal punishment. On 12 December 1960 he said in the House of Lords that the law was too much biased in favour of the criminal. Goddard also expressed his opposition to the legalisation of homosexual acts on 24 May 1965. His final speech in the House of Lords was in April 1968 at the age of 91, praising the City of London&#x27;s law courts.

===August 1970 interview===

In the final interview he gave, in August 1970, Goddard told David Yallop that being Lord Chief Justice was not an easy job. When Yallop, who believed that Craig should have been imprisoned for manslaughter and Bentley thus cleared, asked Goddard about Derek Bentley&#x27;s execution, he received the following reply, &quot;Yes, I thought that Bentley was going to be reprieved. He certainly should have been. There&#x27;s no doubt in my mind whatsoever that Bentley should have been reprieved&quot;. Goddard also said if Fyfe had consulted him he would have recommended a reprieve.

Goddard remarked that what troubled him was not Bentley being hanged when he was close to the minimum age, but the hard facts of the case.

Goddard went on to criticise David Maxwell Fyfe in the two-hour interview, saying that he made the recommendation to mercy to Maxwell-Fyfe and that &quot;Bentley&#x27;s execution was an act of supreme illogicality. I was never consulted over it (the decision and execution). In fact he (Maxwell Fyfe) never consulted anyone. The blame for Bentley&#x27;s execution rests solely with Fyfe&quot;. It is true that Maxwell Fyfe, who died in January 1967, was as much a supporter of the death penalty as Goddard. However, despite stating his opposition to Bentley&#x27;s execution, Goddard still expressed his strong support for the death penalty and asserted that the law was biased in favour of the criminal.

Whether Goddard felt this at the time of Bentley&#x27;s execution, or was saying it in hindsight, remains a moot point. Goddard&#x27;s claims were disputed by John Parris in his book &quot;Scapegoat&quot; (Duckworth), published in 1991. Parris, who died in September 1996, was Craig&#x27;s barrister at the 1952 trial, and wrote that Goddard told Maxwell Fyfe to ignore the jury&#x27;s recommendation for mercy, and that Bentley must be hanged.

=== Death ===
Goddard died at his home in The Temple, London on 29 May 1971. He was cremated four days later. No memorial service was held. When alive, Goddard said he did not want one as they were &quot;exercises in hypocrisy&quot;. He left over £100,000 in his will, published in July 1971.

==Criticism==

After Goddard&#x27;s death, he was attacked in the columns of &quot;The Times&quot; by Bernard Levin, who described him as &quot;a calamity&quot; and accused him of vindictiveness and of being a malign influence on penal reform. Levin had also attacked Goddard when he retired as Lord Chief Justice 13 years earlier in a &quot;Spectator&quot; article, saying he walked hand in hand with ignorance on one side of him and barbarism on the other. In &quot;The Times&quot; on 8 June 1971, Levin wrote (referring to Goddard&#x27;s assertion in 1970 that he had been &quot;very unhappy&quot; about Bentley being hanged) that &quot;if Goddard did indeed claim this, it was a breathtaking piece of hypocrisy, in view of his conduct of the case&quot;. Afterwards Levin was blackballed by the Garrick Club, a favourite resort of both lawyers and journalists, when his application for membership came up.

On 30 July 1998, the Court of Appeal quashed Derek Bentley&#x27;s conviction on the basis of Goddard&#x27;s misdirection to the jury which, according to Lord Bingham, &quot;must [...] have driven the jury to conclude that they had little choice but to convict.&quot; He added that the summing-up of the case was &quot;such as to deny the appellant [Bentley] the fair trial which is the birthright of every British citizen&quot;. Bingham also, however, acknowledged that Goddard was &quot;one of the outstanding criminal judges of the century&quot;, and underlined the change in social standards between 1953 and 1998. Bentley was not, contrary to occasional media reports, acquitted; but in view of the passage of time it is scarcely possible that he would ever have been retried. The decision to review the case decades after Bentley&#x27;s death was not without criticism.

==In popular culture and legal legend==

Lord Goddard was portrayed by the actor Michael Gough in the film &quot;Let Him Have It&quot; in 1991.

In &quot;Prisoner and Escort&quot;, the first episode of the popular 1973 sitcom &quot;Porridge&quot;, Norman Stanley Fletcher says about strict and authoritarian Prison Officer Mackay: &quot;I bet he&#x27;s the secretary of the Lord Chief Justice Goddard appreciation society&quot;. A remark referring to strict views on criminals, society and justice which Mackay and Goddard largely shared.

According to his clerk, Goddard ejaculated when passing a death sentence on such a regular basis, that a fresh pair of trousers had to be brought to court on those occasions.

<doc id="975345" wikidata="Q1346160" url="?curid=975345" title="Maxi Jazz">
<text>Maxwell Alexander Fraser (14 June 1957 – 23 December 2022), better known by his stage name Maxi Jazz, was a British musician, rapper, singer, songwriter and DJ. He was the lead vocalist of British electronic band Faithless from 1995 to 2011 and 2015 to 2016.

== Music career ==
=== Hip hop beginnings ===
Maxi Jazz was born Maxwell Alexander Fraser on 14 June 1957 in Brixton, South London. He founded the Soul Food Café System as a DJ in 1984, having discovered hip hop a year earlier. He first aired the sound as a DJ calling it &quot;In the Soul Kitchen with DJ Maxi Jazz&quot; on pirate radio station Reach FM London from 1985 to 1986. He transferred this sound to pirate radio station LWR in 1987.

In 1989, the Soul Food Café Band was picked up by Tam Tam Records, which is the dance wing of Savage Records. Jazz founded Namu Records in 1992 to release the band&#x27;s material in the form of three EPs and the band toured as a support act to various artists, including Jamiroquai in Amsterdam, Soul II Soul in Barcelona, Galliano in Switzerland, and Jason Rebello in Brazil. In 1996, Maxi Jazz and the Soul Food Cafe recorded and released the album &quot;Original Groovejuice Vol. 1&quot; with Revco Records in Deptford, South London. After the band dissolved, Jazz worked throughout Europe, and took time out to collaborate with Jah Wobble on the &quot;Invaders of the Heart&quot; album, followed by live dates with the Wobble Collective.

=== Faithless ===

In 1995, Jazz met Rollo Armstrong in a studio and went on to form Faithless, together with Jamie Catto and Sister Bliss. As a Soka Gakkai Buddhist, his strong beliefs and the band&#x27;s own strong individual beliefs contrast with the name &#x27;Faithless&#x27;, which was chosen during the writing of the song &quot;Salva Mea&quot;. Armstrong had asked Jazz to write and sing on a dance track about frustration, which was something to which Jazz could relate from his own experiences. The subject matter of Jazz&#x27;s lyrics range from upbeat to melancholic. His work covered a range of personal and social issues, including current affairs and social commentary.

In 2006, Jazz provided the vocals for the hit Tiësto track &quot;Dance4life&quot;. He also sang alongside Robbie Williams on the single &quot;My Culture&quot; from the collaborative album &quot;1 Giant Leap&quot;.

In 2009, he raised £1,440,000 for the UK charity Comic Relief by singing non stop for 24 hours.

Jazz celebrated his 50th birthday on 15 June 2007 in Hyde Park, London, with Faithless headlining the O2 Wireless Festival that evening. In the encore, he was greeted by thousands of fans wishing him happy birthday.

He performed and recorded with Faithless from their founding in 1995 until 2011. He re-joined the group in 2015 and 2016 while they performed under the Faithless 2.0 banner. His final live appearance with the band was at Ibiza Rocks on 31 August 2016.

=== Maxi Jazz and the E-Type Boys ===
In 2015, he began fronting a newly assembled band of musicians named Maxi Jazz &amp; the E-Type Boys. Jazz provided lead vocals and also played guitar in the band. They made a number of festival appearances, including some at the same events at which Faithless were billed.

===Other===
On 20 October 2018, he performed on stage as part of the Gatecrasher Classical event at Sheffield Arena, celebrating 25 years of the Gatecrasher brand.

In 2022, Jazz provided vocals on the Vintage Culture single &quot;Commotion&quot; while under the guidance of music manager John Proctor at Total Artist Management .

== Motor sports ==

Jazz founded Maxi Jazz Racing in 2000 when he asked Rae Claydon to enter him in the Ford Fiesta Championship for the 2000 season, but was only able to race occasionally due to his musical obligations.

On 9 December 2001, Jazz was involved in a serious car accident, causing several of Faithless&#x27;s UK tour dates to be postponed. In 2005, he raced a Ginetta G20 in the Ginetta GT5 Challenge, and in 2006 and 2007 he raced in the Porsche Carrera Cup GB in a Porsche 997 GT3 Cup.

Jazz&#x27;s notable car collection was featured on Sky One&#x27;s &quot;Vroom Vroom&quot; motoring show. He owned a Subaru Impreza P1, a Ford Escort Mk2 RS2000, a Ford Fiesta Zetec S, a Ford Sierra Cosworth, and a Marcos LM500 R. He also owned a Nissan 350Z, which is referenced in the 2010 Faithless song &quot;Flyin&#x27; Hi&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Jazz lived in West Norwood, in the London Borough of Lambeth. A Soka Gakkai Buddhist, he advocated the work of the Burma Campaign UK.

A supporter of Crystal Palace F.C., in September 2012 he became an associate director of the club.

In 2011, a portrait of Jazz was painted by British artist Joe Simpson; the painting was exhibited around the UK, including in a solo exhibition at the Royal Albert Hall. The portrait was shortlisted for the 2011 BP Portrait Award and exhibited at The National Portrait Gallery.

== Death ==
Jazz died &quot;peacefully in his sleep&quot; at his home in South London, after a long illness, on 23 December 2022 at the age of 65. His funeral was held on 30 January 2023.

===Tributes===
Faithless shared their tribute, &quot;He was a man who changed our lives in so many ways. He gave proper meaning and message to our music. He was also a lovely human being with time for everyone and a wisdom that was both profound and accessible. It was an honour and, of course, a true pleasure to work with him. He was a brilliant lyricist, a DJ, a Buddhist, a magnificent stage presence, car lover, endless talker, beautiful person, moral compass and genius.&quot; Dido, sister of Rollo and a regular collaborator with Faithless tweeted her tribute, &quot;RIP Maxi. It was an absolute honour to know you, be inspired by you, listen to you and sing with you. Your voice and words will never leave my head.&quot;

On 28 May 2023, Crystal Palace supporter&#x27;s group, the Holmesdale Fanatics, unveiled their tribute to Jazz, with a full stand tifo display of his face, the largest seen in English football, alongside lyrics from &quot;God Is a DJ&quot;, reading &quot;This is our church. This is where we heal our hurts&quot;.

<doc id="975346" wikidata="Q2312958" url="?curid=975346" title="Gautrekr">
<text>Gautrekr was a legendary Geatish king who appears in several sources, such as &quot;Gautreks saga&quot;, &quot;Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar&quot;, &quot;Bósa saga ok Herrauðs&quot;, &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, &quot;Nafnaþulur&quot; (part of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;) and &quot;Af Upplendinga konungum&quot;.

He appears in different temporal settings, and he could represent different kings named Gautrekr, as the name simply means &quot;Geatish ruler&quot;. In the various settings, he also has different offspring. However, all settings present him as the son of a Gaut or Gauti, and in one of the later settings, his father Gaut gave his name to Götaland (Geatland).

In &quot;Nafnaþulur&quot;, he is mentioned as one of the sea-kings, after his father Gauti.

==Early setting==
In the early setting, Gautrekr is the contemporary of legendary characters such as Starkad and the Swedish kings Erik and Alrik.

&quot;Gautreks saga&quot; tells that Gautrekr was born out of the meeting between Gauti, the king of Västergötland, and Snotra who was the most intelligent of a family of backwoods skinflints. Her family committed suicide for having lost too much food supporting Gauti as their guest. Snotra took the child Gautrek to Gauti&#x27;s court and King Gauti, years later on his deathbed, made Gautrek his heir.

Gautrekr married Álfhildr, the daughter of king Harald of Wendland. When she died, Gautrekr went somewhat out of his mind, ignored all matters of state, and spent all his time on Álfhildr&#x27;s burial mound, flying his hawk. 

Through trickery and the advice of Neri, one of Gautrekr&#x27;s earls, a man named Ref gained the 
hand of Gautrek&#x27;s daughter Helga. He also gained the earldom that Neri held from King Gautrekr.

If &quot;Gautreks saga&quot; tells that Gautrekr had the daughter Helga, &quot;Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar&quot; adds two sons, Ketill and Hrólfr Gautreksson. They both succeeded Gautrekr and Hrólfr spent many years pillaging in Brittany and Great Britain until he finally kidnapped the Scandinavian princess and made her his wife.

==Gautrekr the Mild==
In the late setting, Gautrekr the Mild is the father of Algautr, the last Geatish king, in Scandinavian legends. 

Both &quot;Af Upplendinga konungum&quot; and &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; describe him as the son of Gaut, after whom Götaland (Geatland) took its name. &quot;Af Upplendinga konungum&quot; tells that Gautrekr was married to Alof, the daughter of Olaf the Clear-Sighted, the king of Närke. Both sources tell that Gautrekr had a son named Algautr whose daughter Gauthildr married the pre-Swedish king Ingjald Ill-ruler.

The &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; then continues by telling how the pre-Swedish king invited Algautr and several other petty kings to a banquet at Uppsala only to be burnt to death inside the hall where they had the banquet. Ingjald then proceeded to conquer the kingdoms of the dead kings.

==Gautrekr the Generous==
In &quot;Bósa saga ok Herrauðs&quot;, Gautrekr the Generous is shortly mentioned as the son of Gauti, the son of Odin. It adds that his brother Ring was the king of Östergötland and the father of Herrauðr. This Herrauðr is the same as the Geatish earl who gave his daughter Þóra Town-Hart to Ragnar Lodbrok, when he had saved her from the Lindworm in a number of other sagas.

<doc id="975347" wikidata="Q58673" url="?curid=975347" title="Data manipulation language">
<text>A data manipulation language (DML) is a computer programming language used for adding (inserting), deleting, and modifying (updating) data in a database. A DML is often a sublanguage of a broader database language such as SQL, with the DML comprising some of the operators in the language. Read-only selecting of data is sometimes distinguished as being part of a separate data query language (DQL), but it is closely related and sometimes also considered a component of a DML; some operators may perform both selecting (reading) and writing.

A popular data manipulation language is that of Structured Query Language (SQL), which is used to retrieve and manipulate data in a relational database. Other forms of DML are those used by IMS/DLI, CODASYL databases, such as IDMS and others.

==SQL==
In SQL, the data manipulation language comprises the &quot;SQL-data change&quot; statements, which modify stored data but not the schema or database objects. Manipulation of persistent database objects, e.g., tables or stored procedures, via the SQL schema statements, rather than the data stored within them, is considered to be part of a separate data definition language (DDL). In SQL these two categories are similar in their detailed syntax, data types, expressions etc., but distinct in their overall function. 

The &quot;SQL-data change&quot; statements are a subset of the &quot;SQL-data&quot; statements; this also contains the SELECT query statement, which strictly speaking is part of the DQL, not the DML. In common practice though, this distinction is not made and &quot;SELECT&quot; is widely considered to be part of DML, so the DML consists of all &quot;SQL-data&quot; statements, not only the &quot;SQL-data change&quot; statements. The codice_1 form combines both selection and manipulation, and thus is strictly considered to be DML because it manipulates (i.e. modifies) data.

Data manipulation languages have their functional capability organized by the initial word in a statement, which is almost always a verb. In the case of SQL, these verbs are:

* codice_2 (strictly speaking DQL)
** codice_1
* codice_4
* codice_5
* codice_6

For example, the command to insert a row into table employees:

INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, fname) VALUES (&#x27;John&#x27;, &#x27;Capita&#x27;, &#x27;xcapit00&#x27;);
==Variants==
Most SQL database implementations extend their SQL capabilities by providing imperative, i.e. procedural languages. Examples of these are Oracle&#x27;s PL/SQL and IBM Db2&#x27;s SQL_PL. 

Data manipulation languages tend to have many different flavors and capabilities between database vendors. There have been a number of standards established for SQL by ANSI, but vendors still provide their own extensions to the standard while not implementing the entire standard.

Data manipulation languages are divided into two types, procedural programming and declarative programming.

Data manipulation languages were initially only used within computer programs, but with the advent of SQL have come to be used interactively by database administrators.

<doc id="975350" wikidata="Q719868" url="?curid=975350" title="Polish Film School">
<text>Polish Film School () refers to an informal group of Polish film directors and screenplay writers active between 1956 and approximately 1963. Among the most prominent representatives of the school are Andrzej Wajda, Andrzej Munk, and Jerzy Kawalerowicz.

== Overview ==
The group was under the heavy influence of Italian neorealists. It took advantage of the liberal changes in Poland after 1956 Polish October to portray the complexity of Polish history during World War II and German occupation. Among the most important topics were the generation of former Home Army soldiers and their role in post-war Poland and the national tragedies like the German concentration camps and the Warsaw Uprising. The political changes allowed the group to speak more openly of the recent history of Poland. However, the rule of censorship was still strong when it comes to history after 1945 and there were very few films on contemporary events. This marked the major difference between the members of the Polish Film School and Italian neorealists.

The Polish Film School was the first to underline the national character of Poles and one of the first artistic movements in Central Europe to openly oppose the official guidelines of Socialist realism. The members of the movement tend to underline the role of individual as opposed to collectivity. There were two trends within the movement: young directors such as Andrzej Wajda generally studied the idea of heroism, while another group (the most notable being Andrzej Munk) analyzed the Polish character via irony, humor, and dissection of national myths.

<text>Nicholas Bowen &quot;Topper&quot; Headon (born 30 May 1955) is an English drummer and multi-instrumentalist, best known as the drummer of punk rock band the Clash. Known for his contributions to the drumming world, Headon was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the rest of the Clash in 2003.

He joined the Clash in 1977 and became famed for his drumming skills. He received his nickname owing to his resemblance to Mickey the Monkey from the &quot;Topper&quot; comic.

==Early life==
Headon spent his early childhood in Crockenhill, northwest Kent, before attending Dover Grammar School for Boys. He started playing drums at an early age and was a jazz fan, citing Billy Cobham as a strong influence. In 1973, he joined the cult progressive rock outfit Mirkwood. He appeared with them for a year and a half, and they supported major acts such as Supertramp. He later played with a band that opened for American R&amp;B legends the Temptations and admits to falsely claiming that he played with the Temptations.

==The Clash==
Originally Headon had joined the Clash in 1977 with the intention of establishing a reputation as a drummer before moving on to other projects, but he soon realised their full potential and remained with them for four-and-a-half years. His first live performance was at Le Chartreux Cinema, Rouen, France on April 26, 1977. Headon appeared on the albums &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot; (1978), &quot;The Clash&quot; (1979 US version), &quot;London Calling&quot; (1979), &quot;Sandinista!&quot; (1980) and &quot;Combat Rock&quot; (1982), as well as several landmark singles the Clash recorded during their early period. He performed lead vocal on &quot;Ivan Meets G.I. Joe&quot; from &quot;Sandinista!&quot; and composed most of the music and played drums, piano and bass guitar on the hit single &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; from &quot;Combat Rock&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;Super Black Market Clash&quot; (1993), which included B-sides from the band&#x27;s single releases.

Clash singer/guitarist Joe Strummer said Headon&#x27;s drumming skills were a vital part of the band. Tensions rose between Headon and his fellow band members due to his addiction, and he left the band on 10 May 1982, at the beginning of the &quot;Combat Rock&quot; tour. The band covered up the real reason for Headon&#x27;s departure, the apparent growing use of heroin, claiming Headon&#x27;s exit was due to exhaustion. Strummer had even asked Headon once: &quot;How can I be singing anti-drug songs with you sitting behind me?&quot;

In a later interview for the rockumentary &quot;The Clash: Westway to the World&quot;, he apologised for his addiction and speculated that, had he not been asked to leave the Clash, the band might have lasted longer and might possibly still be together. He also lamented that the best known Clash line-up had been considering a reunion at the time of Strummer&#x27;s death, after the positive reunion during the &quot;Westway to the World&quot; rockumentary.

== After the Clash ==
After leaving the Clash, he was considered as drummer in Mick Jones&#x27;s post-Clash band Big Audio Dynamite and played in a short-lived group called Samurai, with bassist Pete Farndon, guitarist Henry Padovani (from The Police), organist Mick Gallagher (from The Blockheads), and vocalist Steve Allen (formerly of Deaf School). Headon subsequently focused on recording a solo album, &quot;Waking Up&quot; (1986), which featured Mick Gallagher, Bobby Tench and Jimmy Helms. He also released a cover version of the Gene Krupa instrumental &quot;Drumming Man&quot; as a single, which featured Headon&#x27;s &quot;DuKane Road&quot; on the B-side. His own composition &quot;Hope for Donna&quot; was included on the Mercury Records sampler &quot;Beat Runs Wild&quot;, in the same year. During the 1980s Headon produced albums for New York band Bush Tetras. In 1989 he contributed drums to the punk rock band Chelsea&#x27;s &quot;Underwraps&quot; (1989).

During the late 1980s Headon drove mini-cabs to finance his heroin addiction, and later busked on the London Underground with bongo drums.

After a live show in 2002, he was informed of the death of Clash frontman Joe Strummer. An emotional Headon stated: 

Headon was extensively interviewed for the &quot;Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten&quot; documentary film about the late Clash frontman, which was released in 2007. Headon related his experiences during this period, how he became addicted to heroin and how there were problems before his dismissal. Headon also stated that seeing the video of &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; with &quot;someone else (Terry Chimes) in &quot;my&quot; place playing &quot;my&quot; song&quot; caused him to fall in even greater depression and heavier drug addiction.

On 11 January 2008, he performed with Carbon/Silicon at the Carbon Casino Club in Portobello London, being included with the line-up of Mick Jones, Tony James, Leo Williams and Dominic Greensmith. Headon joined the band on stage during the Clash&#x27;s &quot;Train in Vain (Stand by Me)&quot;. An encore followed with Headon playing drums on &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot;. This performance marked the first time since 1982 that Headon and Jones had performed together on stage.

In a February 2008 newspaper article Headon revealed that in 2003 he started to experience serious back pain, a frequent complaint of ageing rock drummers. Diagnosed with hyperkyphosis, a forward curvature of the back, he underwent intense posture adjustment treatment and continues to exercise daily. He notes that, on his recent appearance with Jones, he exhibited his new upright stance.

At some point in the 1980s, Headon contracted Hepatitis C, which, along with his alcohol intake, led to severe liver problems. Headon successfully underwent interferon treatment for his hepatitis in 2007 and became a spokesman for the Hepatitis C Trust.

The BBC featured Headon in a February 2009 feature on drumming as therapy. He shares some of his story in a brief video interview. In 2012 Headon was interviewed by fellow drummer Spike Webb, sharing stories from his years drumming for The Clash and his experience writing &#x27;Rock The Casbah&#x27;.

Actor Alex Gold portrayed Headon in the 2016 film &quot;London Town&quot;, which tells the story of a Clash-obsessed teenager who crosses paths with Joe Strummer by happenstance in 1979 and finds his life changing as a result.

==Drumming style==
As a drummer, Headon often employed a distinctive style which emphasised a simple bass-snare up-down beat, accentuated with closed hi-hat flourishes. Such a method can be found in the songs &quot;Clash City Rockers&quot;, &quot;Clampdown&quot;, &quot;Train in Vain&quot;, and &quot;Lost in the Supermarket&quot;. His drumming on &quot;Train in Vain&quot; has been characterised as one of the most important and distinctive beats in rock music. Scott Kenemore of &quot;PopMatters&quot; writes, &quot;his contribution to the music was tremendous, and his drumming remains an undiscovered treasure for too many.&quot;

<doc id="975353" wikidata="Q602477" url="?curid=975353" title="Hammer toe">
<text>A hammer toe, hammertoe or contracted toe is a deformity of the muscles and ligaments of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the second, third, fourth, or fifth toe, bending it into a shape resembling a hammer. In the early stage, a flexible hammertoe is movable at the joints; a rigid hammertoe joint cannot be moved and usually requires surgery.

Mallet toe is a similar condition affecting the distal interphalangeal joint.

Claw toe is another similar condition, with dorsiflexion of the proximal phalanx on the lesser metatarsophalangeal joint, combined with flexion of both the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. Claw toe can affect the second, third, fourth, or fifth toes.

==Types==
There are three types of hammer toe, as categorized by podiatrists.

*Flexible hammer toes are where patients are still able to bend and move the affected toes, but where a noticeable curl has begun to form.

*Semi-rigid hammer toes are where the affected toes are hard to bend and are noticeably stiff.

*Rigid hammer toes are frozen in a curled position. These are most likely to require surgery. 

==Risk factors==
Older people are more likely to develop hammer toes. Women are at higher risk, due to the construction of women&#x27;s shoes. Injuries to the toes, and being born with a big toe that is short in comparison to the second toe, increase risk. Arthritis and diabetes may also increase the risk of foot deformities.

==Causes==
Hammertoes and clawtoes have multiple causes. Hammer toe most frequently results from wearing poorly fitting shoes that can force the toe into a bent position, such as high heels or shoes that are too short or narrow for the foot. Having the toes bent for long periods of time can cause the muscles in them to shorten, resulting in the hammer toe deformity. This is often found in conjunction with bunions or other foot problems (e.g., a bunion can force the big toe to turn inward and push the other toes).

The toe muscles work in pairs; if the muscles pulling in one direction are much weaker than those pulling in the other direction, the imbalance can bend the toe. If the bend persists, then as the tendons and ligaments tighten (as they do if not stretched), the bend may become permanent. Ill-fitting shoes are especially likely to push the toes out of balance.

Toe deformities can also be caused by muscle, nerve, or joint damage, resulting from conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, stroke, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, complex regional pain syndrome or diabetes. Hammer toe can also be found in Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia (GAA trinucleotide repeat).

==Treatment==
In many cases, conservative treatment consisting of physical therapy and new shoes with soft, spacious toe boxes is enough to resolve the condition, while in more severe or longstanding cases hammertoe surgery may be necessary to correct the deformity. The patient&#x27;s doctor may also prescribe some toe exercises that can be done at home to stretch and strengthen the muscles. For example, the individual can gently stretch the toes manually, or use the toes to pick things up off the floor.

<doc id="975358" wikidata="Q7269957" url="?curid=975358" title="King's Colour Squadron">
<text>The King&#x27;s Colour Squadron, formerly the Queen&#x27;s Colour Squadron, is the unit of the Royal Air Force charged with the safe-keeping of the King&#x27;s Colour for the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom. Since its formation, it has been formed exclusively by Officers and Gunners of No. 63 Squadron RAF Regiment. 

The Squadron is tasked with representing the Royal Air Force at events and ceremonies, both at home and abroad. In addition to Royal Air Force events, the Squadron has the privilege of mounting the King&#x27;s Guard at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and The Tower of London each year, and regularly has the honour of welcoming visiting heads of state on their arrival to the United Kingdom. The Squadron also supports State ceremonial tasks. This routinely includes providing ceremonial guards for the State Opening of Parliament, the National Service of Remembrance parade at the Cenotaph, and large UK hosted events such as the G7 Summit in Cornwall in 2021. The Squadron is also responsible for the ceremonial repatriation of serving Royal Air Force personnel from overseas and members of the Royal Family; in 1997, following the untimely death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the Squadron provided the bearer party that recovered the coffin from Paris. The Squadron provided the Bearer Party and Guard of Honour when an RAF C-17 delivered Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s coffin to London from Scotland on her death in September 2022.

== History ==
The Royal Air Force formed a ceremonial drill unit based at the Royal Air Force Depot at Uxbridge, Middlesex, in the early 1920s and first performed public duties when it mounted the King’s Guard at Buckingham Palace on 1 April 1943 for King George VI. This honour was bestowed upon the Royal Air Force which, at the time, whilst eligible to mount the guard due to being a formed military unit for 25 years, were ineligible due to not being an infantry unit. This led to the Royal Air Force Regiment, despite being only created by Royal Warrant a year prior, mounting the King’s Guard on behalf of the Royal Air Force, a duty which it has carried out every year since.

In 1960, the RAF Drill Unit was charged with the task of guarding and escorting the Queen&#x27;s Colour for the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom, and was renamed the Queen&#x27;s Colour Squadron. It was a pure ceremonial unit for 30 years, providing the sole escort to the Colour, and famed for its displays of continuity drill, which are performed without a single word of command. The most notable displays include the Royal British Legion&#x27;s Festival of Remembrance and Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo. More recently, Hong Kong, also the Squadron was privileged to take part in the RAF Regiment’s 80th anniversary parade held at Buckingham Palace. This saw all Squadrons of the RAF Regiment parading their Standards on the forecourt of the palace, during a unique Changing of the Guard ceremony consisting of the Old and New Guard being formed entirely of Queen’s Colour Squadron personnel, all under the watchful eye of The Duke of Kent.

The 1990 Options for Change defence reforms led to the Squadron being given an operational role as a field Squadron in addition to its ceremonial role. For this, it was given the &#x27;number plate&#x27; of No 63 Squadron, being renamed The Queen&#x27;s Colour Squadron RAF 63 Squadron RAF Regiment. Alongside members of the ship&#x27;s company from HMS Illustrious, and those of the Black Watch, 12 serving members of the QCS were the last military presence in Hong Kong before it was handed back in 1997. Also in 1997, eight members of the squadron were provided to be coffin-bearers at RAF Northolt on the repatriation of Diana, Princess of Wales, after her death in Paris.

The Squadron provided the Bearer Party and Guard of Honour when an RAF plane delivered Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s coffin to RAF Northolt at London from Scotland following her death in September 2022.

Following the accession of King Charles III, The Queen&#x27;s Colour Squadron became the custodians of The King&#x27;s Colour for the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom, the squadron name was changed to King&#x27;s Colour Squadron on 27 October 2022.

<text>Ellis James Abdnor (February 13, 1923 – May 16, 2012) was an American politician who served as a member of the United States Senate from South Dakota. He was also the 15th Administrator of the Small Business Administration under presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush.

Abdnor had previously represented South Dakota&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives and served as the 30th Lieutenant Governor of South Dakota and a member of the South Dakota Senate.

==Early life and education==
Abdnor was born in Kennebec, South Dakota, on February 13, 1923, the son of Mary (née Wehby) and Samuel J. Abdnor. Abdnor served in the United States Army during World War II and then graduated from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in 1945 where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.

== Career ==
From 1946 to 1948, James Abdnor worked as a teacher and coach. Abdnor was chief clerk of the South Dakota Legislature in the early-1950s.

He was a member of the South Dakota Senate from 1957 to 1969. A common, decent, plain spoken man, he was affectionately known as &quot;the people&#x27;s Senator.&quot; He was also described as a &quot;nice-guy public servant&quot; with a &quot;down-home, warm and fuzzy way. His staff considered him to be a friend as well as an honorable mentor and public servant. Like his South Dakota congressional colleague James Abourezk, he was a second-generation Lebanese American and second U.S. Senator of Lebanese descent after Abourezk, as well.

Abdnor was the 30th Lieutenant Governor of South Dakota from 1969 to 1971, and unsuccessfully sought the nomination for the House of Representatives in 1970.

==Tenure in Congress==
In 1972, he was elected to the House of Representatives as a Republican.

Abdnor ran in the 1980 election against three-term incumbent and 1972 Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern for the United States Senate. Abdnor claimed McGovern was out of touch with the state and unseated him by a large margin. During his term as a senator, Abdnor served on the Appropriations Committee and Environment and Public Works Committee, and chaired three subcommittees, including the Environment and Public Works Water Resources Subcommittee.

In 1986, after winning by a wide margin a bruising re-election primary campaign against then Governor Bill Janklow, Abdnor narrowly lost his Senate seat to then-Representative Tom Daschle. He served as the administrator of the Small Business Administration from 1987 to 1989, and served in an advisory capacity for John Thune&#x27;s successful campaign against Daschle in 2004.

===Legislation===
Abdnor&#x27;s accomplishments included authorization of the Grassropes irrigation project and the Walworth, Edmunds, Brown (WEB) rural water system, reauthorization of the Belle Fourche irrigation project, and the inclusion of oats (of which South Dakota is a major producer) in the farm program.

As a fiscal conservative, on April 2, 1984, he introduced S. 2516, the Deficit Reduction Act, a forerunner to the Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget Act. As chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Water Resources, he exerted leadership in passage of legislation requiring cost-sharing for Federal water development projects. His interest in chairing the subcommittee was spawned by the importance of water to South Dakota&#x27;s primary industry, agriculture, and the fact the state had been promised irrigation development in trade for inundation of its Missouri River bottom land behind massive dams in order to provide flood control and navigation benefits to downstream states.

===Notable Abdnor staffers===
United States Senator John Thune had been a member of Senator Abdnor&#x27;s staff.

Other notable members of Abdnor&#x27;s staff who went on to fill important public service roles include:John Hamre, Undersecretary of Defense; Jeff Trandahl, Clerk of the House; Bruce Knight, Undersecretary, Marketing and Regulatory Programs, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); Larry Parkinson, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Law Enforcement and Security, U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and Director, Office of Enforcement, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC); Phil Hogen, Chairman of the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC); Vern Larson, South Dakota State Treasurer and Auditor; South Dakota State Senators Walter Conahan, Mike Vehle, Lee Schoenbeck and Scott Heidepriem; South Dakota State Representative Sean O&#x27;Brien; Charlotte Fischer, South Dakota Public Utilities Commissioner; Roland Dolly, Commissioner of Economic Development for the State Of South Dakota; and Stephen Censky, Administrator of the Foreign Agricultural Service, CEO of the American Soybean Association, and United States Deputy Secretary of Agriculture.

==Death==
Abdnor died on May 16, 2012, at the age of 89.

<text>Gelelemend (c.1737 of 1741–1811) (Lenape), also known as Killbuck or John Killbuck Jr., was an important Delaware (Lenape) principle Chief during the American Revolutionary War. He supported the rebel Americans, known as Patriots. His name signifies &quot;a leader.&quot; He became principal chief of the Lenape in November 1778, following the death of White Eyes, a war chief and Speaker of the Delaware Head Council. Gelelemend succeeded his maternal grandfather &quot;Netawatwees&quot;.

Due to undifferentiated American attacks against the Lenape during the war, chiefs of other clans switched to ally with the British. After being pushed out as principal chief, Gelelemend led an American attack on a major Lenape town. He retreated to Fort Pitt. After the war, he converted to Christianity at the Moravians’s Salem, Ohio mission, where he took the Christian name of &quot;William Henry.&quot;

==Biography==
&quot;Gelelemend&quot; was born near the Lehigh River in Pennsylvania, son of &quot;Bemino&quot; (John Killbuck Sr.) and his wife. His father became a renowned war leader during the French and Indian War. Under the matrilineal kinship system of the Lenape, Gelemend was born into his mother&#x27;s Turtle clan, which had responsibility for providing hereditary chiefs for the tribe. His paternal grandfather was &quot;Netawatwees&quot; (&quot;Newcomer&quot;), principal chief of the Delaware.

At that time, the Lenape had three clans or phratries: Turtle, Turkey, and Wolf. Children were considered born into their mother&#x27;s clan, which determined their social status in the tribe. The mother&#x27;s eldest brother was more important to them in shaping their lives than was their biological father. The Lenape were required to marry outside their clan. Each clan had its own chiefs, councilors, and war captains, as well as a distinct role for serving the tribe.

The Turtle phratry was considered the senior clan, with the role of leading the tribe. Their hereditary chief served as principal chief of the Lenape. By early 1776, the Moravian missionary David Zeisberger recorded that &quot;Gelelemend&quot; had been &quot;designated&quot; as the successor to his paternal grandfather &quot;Netawatwees,&quot; who was thought to be close to 100 years old. After Netawatwees died on October 31, 1776, Gelelemend became Chief of the Turkey Clan (Munsee). 

The British controlled Detroit as well as areas of the Eastern seaboard, where the Patriot rebels were most active. The Delaware tried to remain neutral in the British-American conflict. They were subjected to strong pressure to enter the conflict from the British, the Americans, and other Indian nations (most of whom allied with the British, in the hope of pushing American colonists out of their territories). Under these circumstances, White Eyes, who by 1773 had become Speaker of the Delaware Head Council, was in line matrilineally to become Chief of the Turtle Clan, and principal chief. With White Eyes and Captain Pipe (war captain of the Wolf clan), &quot;Gelelemend&quot; signed the Delaware Treaty with the United States in 1778. Only after the death of White Eyes later that year, who was murdered on November 5, 1778, by an American militia officer, did Gelelemend become principal chief of the Lenape.

But the Lenape remained deeply divided over how to respond to the encroachments and war. Following indiscriminate attacks by Continentals against the Lenape, bands led by Captain Pipe and Buckongahelas broke away from the pro-American leadership of Gelelemend. They allied with the British for the rest of the war. After the war, they resettled in Upper Canada, where they were granted land by the Crown.

By 1781, Gelelemend had been forced from power. He was commissioned as a colonel and helped guide Colonel Daniel Brodhead in an expedition to destroy the Delaware capital of Coshocton in Ohio, where he had lived and served as chief. The raid found only 15 young warriors, who were bound and killed. With a few of his followers, Gelelemend returned with the Americans to Fort Pitt. The raid on Coshocton was condemned; Washington court-martialed Broadhead and removed him from command. Gelelemend had become a man without a country. He lived at Fort Pitt until 1785.

Long interested in Christianity, Gelelemend joined the Moravian mission at Salem, Ohio in 1788. At the baptism ceremony, he took the name William Henry, supposedly to honor a man who had rescued him during the French and Indian War. He was the most prominent convert in the Lenape community. Gelelemend died in Goshen Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio in 1811.

==Legacy==
*The village of Killbuck, Ohio in Holmes County is named for him. (However, the town of Kill Buck, New York is not.)
*To honor William Henry, many of Gelelemend&#x27;s descendants were given Henry as a middle name. This included a great-grandson, John Henry Kilbuck, who became a Moravian missionary in Alaska. He named his daughter Katherine Henry Kilbuck in honor of his ancestor.

<text>John Henry Kilbuck (May 15, 18611922) — sometimes spelled Killbuck (Lenape)— and his wife, Edith Kilbuck (née Romig; April 16, 18651933), were Moravian missionaries in southwestern Alaska in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. John H. Kilbuck was the first Lenape to be ordained as a Moravian minister. They served the Yup&#x27;ik, used their language in the Moravian Church in their area, and supported development of a writing system for Yup&#x27;ik. 

John was the great-grandson of the Delaware (Lenape) principal chief &quot;Gelelemend,&quot; who signed the Treaty of Fort Pitt (1778). It was the first American Indian treaty with the recently declared United States. Born in Kansas, John Henry Killbuck was educated by Moravians in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where he went to seminary. Edith was the daughter and granddaughter of Moravian missionaries in Kansas.

==Biography==
John Kilbuck was born in Franklin County, Kansas on May 15, 1861, into a family of the Christian Munsee band of the Lenape (Delaware). His mother was Mahican, a related Algonquian tribe. Through his father, Kilbuck was the great-grandson of the Lenape principal chief, &quot;Gelelemend&quot; of the Turtle Clan, the first American Indian to sign a treaty with the United States. Traditionally, the Lenape had a matrilineal kinship system, in which descent and inheritance were figured through the mother&#x27;s line. 

Many Munsee had relocated from Ohio and Indiana to Kansas Indian Territory by 1821, forced out of their former territory in the Midwest by continued settler pressure. The United States pushed to remove all the American Indians from east of the Mississippi River and offered land in the west. Moravian missionaries in Kansas recognized that Killbuck was a bright youth. They encouraged him to go East for studies at the Moravian center of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to obtain an education, first at the Nazareth Boys’ School and later at the Moravian College and Seminary. In 1884 Killbuck was the first Lenape to be ordained as a Moravian minister.

Edith Romig was born on April 16, 1865, also in Franklin County, Kansas, the daughter of Joseph Romig, a Moravian minister among the Munsee in Ottawa, Kansas, and his wife. Her maternal grandparents were Levi Ricksecker and his wife. Ricksecker was Romig&#x27;s predecessor as missionary to the Munsee in Kansas. Both Ricksecker and Romig preserved important historical information about the Munsee of that period. Edith Romig was teaching in the mission school and was 19 years old when she met John Kilbuck at his return to Kansas.

==Marriage and family==
In 1885, John Henry Kilbuck (age 23) and Edith Romig (age 19) married. Two years before, when John was still in the seminary, Sheldon Jackson had invited the Moravian Church to send missionaries to Alaska. It wasn&#x27;t until 1885 that the Kilbuck newlyweds and John&#x27;s friend and classmate William Weinland and his new wife set out with Hans Torgersen for Alaska to establish the first Moravian mission station, named Bethel, which has since grown into an important city along the Kuskokwim River . The Kilbucks served as missionaries and educators in Alaska for most of their adult lives. Their four children, all born at the Bethel Mission, carried the traditional Kilbuck middle name of Henry, to honor Major William Henry who had saved the life of their ancestor, Chief Gelelemend, in 1775. John and Edith Kilbuck&#x27;s four children were Katherine Henry (b. 1886), William Henry (b. 1887), Joseph Henry (b.1889), and Ruth Henry (b.1891). All four children spent their early years with their parents in Alaska, then attended Moravian schools in North Carolina

==Career in Alaska==
The Kilbucks went to Alaska as part of the first group of missionaries, establishing a mission at what became Bethel. They spent their adult lives in southwestern Alaska as missionaries and teachers among the Yup&#x27;ik people. In 1896, they were joined by Edith&#x27;s younger brother Joseph H. Romig and his wife Ella.

The Kilbucks were perhaps the most influential missionaries during the period around 1900. They quickly learned the Yup&#x27;ik language. John developed his missionary work based on existing Yup&#x27;ik villages, rather than establishing separate mission stations, as had been done by Moravian missionaries in Greenland and Labrador. He adopted Yup&#x27;ik as the language of the Moravian Church in Alaska, a policy which continues to the present in Yup&#x27;ik-speaking areas.The diaries of the Kilbucks provide much of what is known of Yup&#x27;ik life in the late 1800s. The Kilbuck Mountain Range in southwestern Alaska bears their name.

Reverend John Hinz, another missionary, had begun to translate scripture and other material into Yup&#x27;ik written with Roman (English) letters. Uyaquq, a local &quot;helper,&quot; convert and later missionary, translated some of these texts into Yup&#x27;ik using a script which he had created to write Yugtun. Hinz and the Kilbucks supported both of these efforts. The Hinz script became the standard for writing Yup&#x27;ik until about 1970. It was replaced by a script developed by a group of native Yup&#x27;ik speakers and linguists at the University of Alaska.

John Henry Kilbuck died in 1922 in Akiak, Alaska. Edith died in 1933.

==Legacy and honors==
* The Kilbuck Family Scholarship for Native Americans is awarded annually to a Native American college student from Alaska or Oregon.
* The diaries and letters of John and Edith Kilbuck provide much information otherwise unavailable about Yup&#x27;ik life in the late 19th century. 
* The book, &quot;The Real People and the Children of Thunder&quot; by Ann Fienup-Riordan, is about their ministry and the Yup&#x27;ik. 
* The Kilbuck Mountain range and the Kilbuck Elementary School in Bethel, Alaska, were named for them.

<text>Valle San Giovanni is a small village in the province of Teramo, in the Abruzzo region of central Italy. It is a &quot;frazione&quot; of the town of Teramo.

==Geography==
The village has a population of about 350 people and lies about six miles from Teramo. The Adriatic Sea and the Gran Sasso are about 25 km away. It sits in the Tordino Valley, near the spot where two small streams, the Lete and the Fiumicello, flow into the Tordino river.

Located off the main &quot;piazza&quot;, Largo della Chiesa, is Via del Casale. The residents of Valle San Giovanni call themselves &quot;Vallaroli&quot;.

Adjacent to Valle San Giovanni are the nearby villages of Frondarola, Travazzano and Valle Soprana.

==History==
According to some sources the town takes its name from a powerful Teramo family with the last name &quot;Di Valle&quot;. Others claim that the name derives from its proximity to an ancient monastery, San Giovanni in Pergullis (Saint John amongst the Pergolae), a location surrounded by many vineyards.

Over the years, the history of Valle San Giovanni has been closely linked with two neighboring communities, Frunti, a feudal holding of the &quot;De Frunto&quot; family, and Teramo, with which there was an enduring reciprocal alliance. At one point Teramo briefly annexed Frunti leading to renewed efforts by it inhabitants to break these feudal ties and traditions. In 1338 the townspeople declared their independence from Teramo, thereby reaffirming their autonomous civil liberties. This arrangement lasted until 1457 when Frunti became part of the county Montorio al Vomano. In 1668 Frunti passed into the hands of the Count Crescenzio De Crescentiis. In the beginning of the 18th century Frunti became aligned with neighboring Valle San Giovanni, which at that time was becoming increasingly developed due to having annexed the surrounding church and vineyards of San Giovanni in Pergulis and to serving as a sheep herding way station. This great migration of sheep from Abruzzo to Puglia and Lazio was known as the transumanza. Valle San Giovanni sits on one such trail known as the San Quirico.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, Valle San Giovanni witnessed a number of brigand skirmishes, these arising from struggles over control of the surrounding forest areas. At least a few of these brigands were local townsfolk.

In the midst of these ongoing struggles, San Giovanni in Pergulis, the monastery on the outskirts of Valle San Giovanni, had a rapid and irreversible decline. In 1561 Pope Paul IV deeded these holdings, along with the remains of the old convent, to the collegiate church of Montorio al Vomano, with the understanding that they would be restored. The church did not restore the properties, which continued to deteriorate. In 1775 the church authorities of Montorio al Vomano ceded San Giovanni in Pergulis and all of its associated religious functions, to the main church of Valle San Giovanni, Madonna della Neve. The latter sits in the center of Valle San Giovanni, and takes its name, Madonna della Neve (Our Lady of Snow), from a legend in which a church was to be erected on the spot where a summer snowfall was to occur. Madonna della Neve is known for its frescoes dating to 1458. A religious festival held the first weekend in August of each year serves to commemorate its founding.

In 1603 the Marquis Baltassarre Caracciolo had three brigands executed in an effort to put an end to the ongoing rivalries arising at that time. In 1682, two groups of brigands fought for control of the land surrounding Valle San Giovanni. One such battle lasted six days and came to an end only when soldiers from Teramo were summoned to put an end to the conflict. A year later in 1683, the town was sacked and almost completely destroyed by Don Alfonso di Villaparte in an attempt to capture the famous brigand, Santuccio Di Froscia, who for years had been terrorizing the countryside.

In 1799 a group of soldiers from Valle San Giovanni, under the leadership of the brigand leader, Vincenzo Rolli, fought valiantly against the French occupying forces. In 1809 the French Napoleonic forces, who would rule for ten years under the Kingdom of Naples, chose Valle San Giovanni as the center of vast communal territory which included the ex feudal states of Frunti, Valle Piola, Abetemozzo, Borgonovo e Poggio Rattieri.

In the first half of the 19th century, coal deposits were discovered and mined very near the town. From the early 20th century onward, many of the citizens of Valle San Giovanni emigrated to New Jersey in the United States; Montreal, Quebec, Canada; and elsewhere in search of work. This served to further impoverish the small village and greatly reduced its population.

In 1868 the town (comune) of Cortino was administratively established and Valle San Giovanni came under the jurisdiction of Montorio al Vomano. In 1929 Valle San Giovanni separated from Montorio al Vomano and became a suburb (frazione) of Teramo.

According to local sources and histories, during the Second World War the grottoes located immediately above Valle San Giovanni served as places of refuge for the Italian partisans then battling the German forces.

<doc id="975385" wikidata="Q844910" url="?curid=975385" title="Pandya dynasty">
<text>The Pandya dynasty (), also referred to as the Pandyas of Madurai, was an ancient Tamil dynasty of South India, and among the four great kingdoms of Tamilakam, the other three being the Pallavas, the Cholas and the Cheras. Existing since at least the 4th to 3rd centuries BCE, the dynasty passed through two periods of imperial dominance, the 6th to 10th centuries CE, and under the &#x27;Later Pandyas&#x27; (13th to 14th centuries CE). Under Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I and Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I, the Pandyas ruled extensive territories including regions of present-day South India and northern Sri Lanka through vassal states subject to Madurai. The Pandya dynasty is the longest ruling dynasty in the world.

The rulers of the three Tamil dynasties were referred to as the &quot;three crowned rulers (the mu-ventar) of the Tamil Region&quot; in the southern part of India. The origin and the timeline of the Pandya dynasty are difficult to establish. The early Pandya chieftains ruled their country (Pandya Nadu) from the ancient period, which included the inland city of Madurai and the southern port of Korkai. The Pandyas are celebrated in the earliest available Tamil poetry (Sangam literature). Graeco-Roman accounts (as early as the 4th century BCE), the edicts of Maurya emperor Ashoka, coins with legends in Tamil-Brahmi script, and Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions suggest the continuity of the Pandya dynasty from the 3rd century BCE to the early centuries CE. The early historic Pandyas faded into obscurity upon the rise of the Kalabhra dynasty in south India.

From the 6th century to the 9th century CE, the Chalukyas of Badami or Rashtrakutas of the Deccan, the Pallavas of Kanchi, and Pandyas of Madurai dominated the politics of south India. The Pandyas often ruled or invaded the fertile estuary of Kaveri (the Chola country), the ancient Chera country (Kongu and central Kerala) and Venadu (southern Kerala), the Pallava country, and Sri Lanka. The Pandyas fell into decline with the rise of the Cholas of Thanjavur in the 9th century and were in constant conflict with the latter. The Pandyas allied themselves with the Sinhalese and the Cheras against the Chola Empire until it found an opportunity to revive its frontiers during the late 13th century.

The Pandyas entered their golden age under Maravarman I and Jatavarman Sundara Pandya I (13th century). Some early efforts by Maravarman I to expand into the Chola country were effectively checked by the Hoysalas. Jatavarman I () successfully expanded the kingdom into the Telugu country (as far north as Nellore), south Kerala, and conquered northern Sri Lanka. The city of Kanchi became a secondary capital of the Pandyas.The Hoysalas, in general, were confined to the Mysore Plateau and even king Somesvara was killed in a battle with Pandyas. Maravarman Kulasekhara I (1268) defeated an alliance of the Hoysalas and the Cholas (1279) and invaded Sri Lanka. The venerable Tooth Relic of the Buddha was carried away by the Pandyas. During this period, the rule of the kingdom was shared among several royals, one of them enjoying primacy over the rest. An internal crisis in the Pandya kingdom coincided with the Khalji invasion of south India in 1310–11. The ensuing political crisis saw more sultanate raids and plunder, the loss of south Kerala (1312), and north Sri Lanka (1323) and the establishment of the Madurai sultanate (1334). The Pandyas of Ucchangi (9th–13th century) in the Tungabhadra valley were related to the Pandyas of Madurai.

According to tradition, the legendary Sangams (&quot;the Academies&quot;) were held in Madurai under the patronage of the Pandyas, and some of the Pandyan rulers claimed to be poets themselves. Pandya Nadu was home to several renowned temples, including the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai. The revival of the Pandya power by Kadungon (late 6th century CE) coincided with the prominence of the Shaivite nayanars and the Vaishnavite alvars. It is known that the Pandya rulers followed Jainism for a short period of time.

==Etymology and origin legends==
The etymology of Pandya is still a matter of considerable speculation among scholars. One theory is that the word &quot;pandya&quot; is derived from the ancient Tamil word &quot;pandu&quot; meaning &quot;old&quot;. The theory suggests that in early historic Tamil lexicon the word pandya means &quot;old country&quot; in contrast with Chola meaning &quot;new country&quot;, Chera meaning &quot;hill country&quot; and Pallava meaning &quot;branch&quot; in Sanskrit. Another theory is that the word Pandya is derived from the Sanskrit word Pandu to mean white or pale, in reference to king Pandu and the Pandavas. Apart from these derivations mentioned, several other theories do appear in historical studies.

According to the ancient Tamil legends, the three brothers &quot;Cheran&quot;, &quot;Cholan&quot; and &quot;Pandyan&quot; ruled in common at the southern city of Korkai. While Pandya remained at home, his two brothers Cheran and Cholan after a separation founded their own kingdoms in north and west. Epic poem &quot;Silappatikaram&quot; mentions that the emblem of the Pandyas was that of a &quot;fish&quot;.
Indian traditions such as the Great Epics and the Puranas often associate southern India with Sage Agastya (who had his ashrama in the south). Agastya appears prominently in medieval Tamil literature also.

Folklores attribute Alli Rani (meaning &quot;the queen Alli&quot;) as one of the early historic rulers of the Pandyas. She is attributed as an &quot;amazonian queen&quot; whose servants were men and administrative officials and army were women. She is thought of ruling the whole western and northern coast of Sri Lanka from her capital Kudiramalai, where remains of what is thought of as her fort are found. She is sometimes seen as an incarnation of the Pandya associated gods, Meenakshi and Kannagi.

=== Chandra-vamsa ===
The medieval Pandya kings were claimed to have belonged to the Chandra-vamsa or the Lunar Race. They claimed Pururavas and Nahusha as ancestors. Pururavas is listed as one of the ancestors in the Velvikudi Inscription of Nedunjadaiyan Varaguna-varman I (Jatila Parantaka Nedunjadaiyan).

==Sources of Pandya history==
The Greek ambassador to Chandragupta Maurya, Megasthenes mentions Queens of Pandyas as &#x27;Pandaia&#x27; and locates them in the south of India extending into the ocean. It consisted of 365 villages which met the needs of the royal palace each day of the year. He described the queen Pandaie as daughter of Heracles (by some author as Shiva or Krishna). Madurai, capital of Pandyas is mentioned in Kautilya&#x27;s Arthashastra (4th century BCE) as &#x27;Mathura of the south&#x27;.

=== Archaeological sources ===
Pandyas are also mentioned in the inscriptions of Maurya emperor Asoka (3rd century BCE). In his inscriptions (2nd and 13th Major Rock Edict), Asoka refers to the peoples of south India – the Cholas, the Cheras, Pandyas and Satiyaputras. These polities, possibly not part of the Maurya empire, were on friendly terms with Asoka:

The earliest Pandya to be found in epigraph is Nedunjeliyan, figuring in the Tamil-Brahmi Mangulam inscription (near Madurai) assigned to 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE. The record documents a gift of rock-cut beds, to a Jain ascetic. It is assumed that the people found in the Mangulam inscription, Nedunjeliyan, Kadalan, and Izhanchadikan predate rulers such as Talaiyanganam Nedunjelyan and Palyaga-salai Mudukudimi Peruvaludi.

Kharavela, the Kalinga king who ruled during c. 1st century BCE, in his Hathigumpha inscription, claims to have destroyed an old confederacy of Tamil countries (&quot;the tamira–desa–sanghata&quot;) which had lasted 132 years, and to have acquired a large number of pearls from the Pandyas.

Silver punch-marked coins with the fish symbol of the Pandyas dating from around the same time have also been found.

=== Early Tamil literature ===
The early historic Pandyas are celebrated in the earliest available Tamil poetry. The poems refers to about twelve Pandya rulers. According to tradition, the legendary Sangams (&quot;the Academies&quot;) were held in Madurai under the patronage of the Pandyas. Several Tamil literary works, such as Iraiyanar Agapporul, mention the legend of three separate Sangams and ascribe their patronage to the Pandyas.

Pandya rulers from early historic south India
* Mudattirumaran
* Koon Pandya
* Nedunjeliyan I (&quot;Aariyap Padai Kadantha&quot;)
* Puda-Pandya
* Palyagasalai Mudukudumi Peruvaludi

* Maran Valudi
* Kadalan Valuthi
* Musiri Mutriya Cheliyan
* Ukkirap Peruvaludi

* Arivudainampi

Pandya rulers – such as Nedunjeliyan, the Victor of Talaiyalanganam, and Mudukudimi Peruvaludi, the Patron of Several Sacrificial Halls (&quot;the Palyaga-salai&quot;) – find mention in several poems (such as &quot;Mathuraikkanci&quot;).

Besides several short poems found in the &quot;Akananuru&quot; and the &quot;Purananuru&quot; collections, there are two major works – &quot;Mathuraikkanci&quot; and &quot;Netunalvatai&quot; – which give a glimpse into the society and commercial activities in the Pandya country during the early historic period. The &quot;Purananuru&quot; and &quot;Agananuru&quot; collections contain poems sung in praise of various Pandya rulers and also poems that were claimed to be composed by the rulers themselves.

Besides the poems, king Peruvaludi is also mentioned in later copper-plate grant (8th–9th century CE). In the work &quot;Mathuraikkanci&quot;, the author Mankudi Maruthanar, refers to his patron, Talaihalanganum Nedunjeliyan, as the Lord of Korkai and the Warlord of the Southern Parathavar People. It contains a full-length description of Madurai and the Pandya country under the rule of Nedunjeliyan. In the famous battle of Talaiyalanganam (in east Tanjore), the Pandya is said to have defeated his enemies (which included the Chera and the Chola). He is also praised for his victory of Mizhalai and Mutturu, two &quot;vel&quot; centres along the ocean (in Pudukkottai). The &quot;Netunalvatai&quot; (in the collection of &quot;Pattupattu&quot;) by Nakkirar contains a description of king Nedunjeliyan&#x27;s palace.

=== Foreign sources ===

The Buddhist text Mahavamsa (composed in the 5th century CE) mentions a Pandya king in the context of Prince Vijaya&#x27;s (543–505 BCE) arrival in Sri Lanka with his 700 followers.
* According to the Mahavamsa, emissaries laden with precious gifts were sent from Sri Lanka to the city of Madhura in southern India. Their mission was to secure a bride for Prince Vijaya. The Pandya King of Madurai agreed to the proposal. He not only sent his own daughter to marry Prince Vijaya but also requested other families to offer their daughters to marry the prince&#x27;s ministers and retainers. So, along with the Princess and hundreds of maidens, craftsmen and a thousand families from the eighteen guilds were also sent to Sri Lanka.
*Greek and Latin sources (early centuries CE) refer to the ancient Tamil country, same as the Tamilakam, as &quot;Lymyrike&quot; or &quot;Damirice&quot; (or Dymirice/Dimirixe or Damirice) and its ruling families.
* Pandyas are also mentioned by Greek author Megasthenes (4th century BCE) where he writes about the south Indian kingdom being ruled by women. He described the Pandya country in &quot;Indika&quot; as &quot;occupying the portion of India which lies southward and extends to the sea&quot;. According to his account, the kingdom had 365 villages, each of which was expected to meet the needs of the royal household for one day in the year. He described the Pandya queen at the time, &quot;Pandaia&quot; as the daughter of Herakles.

== History ==

=== Early historic Pandyas ===

Mauryan emperor Asoka (3rd century BCE) seems to have been on friendly terms with the people of south India and Sri Lanka (the Cholas, the Pandyas, the Satiya Putras, the Kerala Putras and the Tamraparnis). There are no indications that Asoka tried to conquer the extreme south India (the Tamilakam – the Abode of the Tamils).

The three chiefly lines of early historic south India – the Cheras, Pandyas and Cholas – were known as the mu-vendar (&quot;the three vendars&quot;). They were traditionally based at their original headquarters in the interior Tamil Nadu (Karur, Madurai and Uraiyur respectively). The powerful chiefdoms of the three ventar dominated the political and economic life of early historic south India. The frequent conflicts between the Chera, the Chola and the Pandya are well documented in ancient (the Sangam) Tamil poetry. The Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas also controlled the ports of Muziris (Muchiri), Korkai and Kaveri respectively (for the trade with the Graeco-Roman world). The gradual shift from chiefdoms to kingdoms seems to have occurred in the following period.The famous inscription of king Kharavela at Hathigumpha (mid-first century BCE) mentions the defeat of a confederacy of the &quot;Tramira&quot; countries which had been a threat to Kalinga. It also remembers the precious pearls brought to the capital as booty from the &quot;Pandya&quot; realm. The Pandya chiefdom was famous for its pearl fisheries and silk industry. Korkai and Alagankulam are believed to have been the exchange centres of the Pandyas. Korkai, a port at the mouth of the river Tambraparni, was linked to the famous pearl fisheries and Alagankulam was also developed as a port.

Several coins attributed to early historic Pandyas are found were Severalin the region. Inscriptions, datable to c. 2nd century BCE, recording royal grants – both from royals and wealthy commoners – were also discovered from the Pandya country.

The Pandya seems to be the most prominent of the three &quot;ventar&quot; rulers. There are even references to a Pandya queen from 3rd century BCE representing a confederacy of the Tamil countries. Madurai, in south Tamil Nadu, was the most important cultural centre in south India as the core of the Tamil speakers. Megalithic relics such as menhirs, dolmens, urn burials, stone circles and rock-cut chambers/passages can be found in south India. Burial goods include iron objects, ivory ornaments, Black-and-Red Ware and even some Roman Imperial coins. The so-called &quot;velir&quot; hill chieftains are assumed to be associated with these megalithic burials.

Greek and Latin accounts (early centuries CE), coins with legends in Tamil-Brahmi script, and Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions suggest the continuity of the Pandya dynasty from the 3rd century BCE to early centuries CE. The early Pandyas, along with the Cheras and the Cholas, were eventually displaced by the Kalabhra dynasty.

=== Medieval Pandyas ===
==== Pandya revival (7th–10th centuries CE) ====

The Pandya kingdom was revived by king Kadungon (r. 590–620 CE) towards the end of the 6th-century CE. In the Velvikudi inscription, a later copper-plate, Kadungon appears as the &quot;destroyer&quot; of the &quot;anti-Brahmanical&quot; Kalabhra kings. With the decline of the Kalabhra dynasty, the Pandyas grew steadily in power and territory. With the Cholas in obscurity in Uraiyur, the Tamil country was divided between the Pallavas of Kanchi and the Pandyas of Madurai.

From the 6th century to the 9th century CE, the Chalukyas of Badami, the Pallavas of Kanchi, and the Pandyas of Madurai dominated the politics of south India. The Badami Chalukyas were eventually replaced by the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. The Pandyas took on the growing Pallava ambitions in south India, and from time to time they also joined in alliances with the kingdoms of the Deccan Plateau (such as with the Gangas of Talakad in late 8th century CE). In the middle of the 9th century, the Pandyas had managed to advance as far as Kumbakonam (north-east of Tanjore on the Kollidam river).

Sendan (r. 654–70 CE), the third king of the Pandyas of Madurai, is known for expanding his kingdom to the Chera country (western Tamil Nadu and central Kerala). Arikesari Maravarman (r. 670–700 CE), the fourth Pandya ruler, is known for his battles against the Pallavas of Kanchi. Pallava king Narasimhavarman I (r. 630–668 CE), the famous conqueror of Badami, claimed to have defeated the Pandyas. Chalukya King Paramesvaravarman I &quot;Vikramaditya&quot; (r. 670–700 CE) is known to have fought battles with the Pallavas, the Gangas, and probably with the Pandyas too, on the Kaveri basin.

Kirtivarman II (r. 744/5–55 CE), the last Chalukya king, managed to lose to his southern countries as a result of his battles with the Pandyas. Pandya kings Maravarman Rajasimha I (r. 730–65 CE) and Nedunjadaiyan/Varagunavarman I (r. 765–815 CE) threatened Pallava king Nandivarman II Pallavamalla (r. 731–96 CE) who had managed to defeat the Gangas in . Varagunavarman I invaded the Pallava country and conquered the Kongu country (western Tamil Nadu) and Venadu (south Kerala). King Srimara Srivallabha (r. 815–62 CE) sailed to Sri Lanka, subjugated and overpowered King Sena I, and sacked his capital Anuradhapura (the Panya invasion of Sri Lanka followed a period of vassalage). However, Srimara Srivallabha was soon overpowered by Pallava king Nripatunga (r. 859–99 CE). Sena II, the king of Sri Lanka, invaded the Pandya country, sacked Madurai and chose Varagunavarman II (r. c. 862–880 CE) as the new king soon after. It is proposed that the start of the Kollam Era, the Kerala calendar, in 825 CE marked the liberation of Venadu from Pandya control.

During the rule of Dantivarman (r. 796–847 CE), the Pallava territory was reduced by the encroachment from the Pandyas from the south (and Rashtrakutas and the Telugu-Cholas from nand orth). Pallava king Nandivarman III (r. 846–69 CE) was able to defeat the Pandyas and Telugu-Cholas (and even the Rashtrakutas) with the help of the Gangas and the emerging Cholas.

====Under Chola influence (10th–13th centuries)====
While the Pandyas and the Rashtrakutas were busy engaging the Pallavas, with the Gangas and the Simhalas (Sri Lanka) also in the mix, the Cholas emerged from the Kaveri delta and took on the chieftains of Thanjavur (the Mutharaiyar chieftain had transferred their loyalty from the Pallava to the Pandya). The Chola king Vijayalaya conquered Thanjavur by defeating the Mutharaiyar chieftain around . The Pandya control north of the Kaveri river was severely weakened by this move (and straightened the position of the Pallava ruler Nripatunga). Pandya ruler Varaguna-varman II (r. c. 862–880 CE) responded by marching into the Chola country and facing a formidable alliance of Pallava prince Aparajita, the Chola king Aditya I and the Ganga king Prithvipati I. The Pandya king suffered a crushing defeat () in a battle fought near Kumbakonam.

By , Chola king Aditya I was the master of the old Pallava, Ganga and Kongu countries. It is a possibility that Aditya I conquered the Kongu country from the Pandya king Parantaka Viranarayana (r. 880–900 CE). Parantaka I, successor to Aditya, invaded the Pandya territories in 910 CE and captured Madurai from king Maravarman Rajasimha II (hence the title &quot;Madurai Konda&quot;). Rajasimha II received help from the Sri Lankan king Kassapa V, still got defeated by Parantaka I in the battle of Vellur, and fled to Sri Lanka. Rajasimha then found refuge in the Chera country, leaving even his royal insignia in Sri Lanka, the home of his mother.

The Cholas were defeated by a Rashtrakuta-lead confederacy in the battle of Takkolam in 949 CE. By mid-950s, the Chola kingdom had shrunk to the size of a small principality (its vassals in the extreme south had proclaimed their independence). It is a possibility that Pandya ruler Vira Pandya defeated Chola king Gandaraditya and claimed independence. Chola ruler Sundara Parantaka II (r. 957–73) responded by defeating Vira Pandya I in two battles (and Chola prince Aditya II killed Vira Pandya on the second occasion). The Pandyas were assisted by the Sri Lanka forces of King Mahinda IV.

Chola emperor Rajaraja I (r. 985–1014 CE) is known to have attacked the Pandyas. He fought against an alliance of the Pandya, Chera and Sri Lankan kings, and defeated the Cheras and &quot;deprived&quot; the Pandyas of their ancient capital Madurai. Emperor Rajendra I continued to occupy the Pandya kingdom, and even appointed a series of Chola viceroys with the title &quot;Chola Pandya&quot; to rule from Madurai (over Pandya and Western Chera/Kerala countries). The very beginning of Chola emperor Kulottunga&#x27;s rule (r. from 1070 CE) was marked by the loss of Sri Lanka and a rebellion in the Pandya country.

The second half of the 12th century witnessed a major internal crisis in the Pandya country (between princes Parakrama Pandya and Kulasekhara Pandya). The neighbouring kingdoms of Sri Lanka, under Parakramabahu I, Venadu Chera/Kerala, under the Kulasekharas, and the Cholas, under Rajadhiraja II and Kulottunga III, joined in and took sides with any of the two princes or their kins.

Pandya kings (10th century–first half of 11th century CE):
* Sundara Pandya I
* Vira Pandya I (Veerapandyan)
* Vira Pandya II
* Amarabhujanga Tivrakopa
* Srivallabha Manakulachala (1101–1124 CE)
* Maravarman Srivallabha (1132–1161 CE)
* Parakrama I (1161–1162 CE)
* Kulasekara III
* Vira Pandya III
* Jatavarman Srivallabha (1175–1180 CE)
* Jatavarman Kulasekara I (1190–1216 CE)

=== Imperial Pandyas (13th–14th centuries) ===
The Pandya empire included extensive territories, at times including large portions of south India and Sri Lanka. The rule of the empire was shared among several royals, one of them enjoying primacy over the rest. The Pandya king at Madurai thus controlled these vast regions through the collateral family branches subject to Madurai.

==== Maravarman Sundara I ====
The foundation for the Pandya supremacy in south India was laid by Maravarman Sundara I early in the 13th century. He succeeded his older brother Jatavarman Kulasekhara in 1216. He invaded the Chola country, sacked Uraiyur and Thanjavur, and drove the Chola king Kulothunga III into exile. The Chola king subsequently made a formal submission to Maravarman Sundara I and acknowledged his overlordship. Attempts by the next Chola king Rajaraja III (1216 – 46 CE) for self-rule (to stop the Pandya invasion into the Chola country), with the help of the Hoysalas king Narasimha II (r. 1220 – 1238 CE), resulted in a battle between the Pandya and Hoysala forces at Mahendramangalam on the Kaveri Valley. Maravarman Sundara I was defeated and Rajaraja III was restored in the Chola country. Sometime later Chola prince Rajendra III attacked the Pandyas and defeated two Pandya royals including Maravarman Sundara II. Hoysala king Somesvara (r. 1233 – 1267 CE) then came to the aid of the Pandyas, defeated Rajendra III and then made peace with the Cholas.

==== Jatavarman Sundara I ====
 Jatavarman Sundara I ascended the Pandya throne in 1251 CE. He led his army to the Chola country (even as far as Nellore), to Sri Lanka and to south Kerala. He was also successful in confining the Hoysala control to the Mysore Plateau (the ancient Chola country was now overrun by the Pandyas). Kanchi functioned as the second major city in the kingdom. In his conquests, Jatavarman Sundara I assisted joined number of Pandya royals such as Jatavarman Vira Pandya.

Jatavarman Sundara I subdued Rajendra II around 1258–1260 CE and made him pay tribute. The rule of the Cholas ended with Rajendra III. The Pandya attacked the Hoysalas in the Kaveri and captured the fort of Kannanur Koppam. Hoysala king Somesvara was forced to fall back into the Mysore Plateau. The Hoysala king, pressed by enemies from north and south, &quot;assigned&quot; the southern half of his kingdom to his younger son Ramanatha (r. 1254–1292). Somesvara was eventually killed by the Pandya in 1262 CE. Ramanatha managed to recover Kannanur and hold against the Pandya power. Jatavarman Sundara I also came into conflict with the Kadava ruler Kopperunjinga II. It seems that Bana (Magadai) and Kongu countries came under the Pandya rule during the wars against the Hoysalas and the Kadavas. Jatavarman Sundara I also fought the Kakatiya ruler Ganapati (1199–1262). Sri Lanka was invaded by Jatavarman Sundara I in 1258 and on his behalf by his younger brother Jatavarman Vira II between 1262 and 1264 CE. The island was again invaded and defeated by Jatavarman Vira II in 1270 CE.

==== Maravarman Kulasekara I ====
Sundara Pandya I (died in 1268) was succeeded by Maravarman Kulasekara I. Around 1279 the combined force of Hoysala king Ramanatha and Rajendra III was defeated by Maravarman Kulasekara I. Maravarman Kulasekara I, now virtually unchallenged, ruled over the Chola country and southern Tamil speaking portions of Hoysala kingdom. He also invaded Sri Lanka, ruled by Bhuvanaikabahu I, who &quot;carried away to the Pandya country the venerable Tooth Relic&quot;, and the wealth of the island. Sri Lanka remained under Pandya control until c. 1308–1309 CE.

====Decline of Pandyas====
After the death of Maravarman Kulasekhara I (1310), his sons Vira Pandya IV and Sundara Pandya IV fought a war of succession for control of the empire. It seems that Maravarman Kulasekhara wanted Vira Pandya to succeed him (who in turn was defeated by Sundara Pandya after a short period). Unfortunately, the Pandya civil war coincided with the Khalji raids in south India. Taking advantage of the political situation, the neighbouring Hoysala king Ballala III invaded the Pandya territory. However, Ballala had to retreat to his capital, when Alauddin Khalji&#x27;s general Malik Kafur invaded his kingdom at the same time. After subjugating Ballala III, the Khalji forces marched to the Pandya territory in March 1311. The Pandya brothers fled their headquarters, and the Khaljis pursued them unsuccessfully. By late April 1311, the Khaljis gave up their plans to pursue the Pandya princes, and returned to Delhi with the plunder. By 1312 the Pandya control over south Kerala was also lost.

After the departure of the Khaljis, Vira and Sundara Pandya resumed their conflict. Sundara Pandya was defeated and sought help from the Khaljis. With their help, he regained control of the South Arcot region by 1314. Subsequently, there were two more expeditions from the sultanate in 1314 led by Khusro Khan and in 1323 by Jauna Khan under the Punjab-born sultan Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq.

The family quarrels and the sultanate invasions shattered the Pandya empire beyond revival and coinage discoveries made imply that the Pandyas were left with the old South Arcot region. In 1323, the Jaffna kingdom declared its independence from the crumbling Pandya influence.

=== Tenkasi Pandyas (14th–16th centuries) ===
The Pandya kings from Sadaavarman Parakrama Pandya to his successors who ruled with Tenkasi as their capital. With the invasion of the Sultanates, Vijayanagaras, and Nayakars from the fourteenth century onwards, the Pandyas lost their traditional capital of Madurai and shifted to cities like Tenkasi and Tirunelveli. Tenkasi was the last capital of the Pandyas. All the Pandyas from Sadaavarman Parakrama Pandya and his next generations were crowned in the Adheenam Mutt in Kasi Viswanathar temple. During the same period, some Pandyas ruled with Tirunelveli as their capital. Kayatharu, Vadakkuvalliyur, and Ukkirankottai are some of their major cities. Inscriptions on them are found in Tenkasi&#x27;s Kasi Viswanathar temple, Brahmadesam, Tirunelveli, Cheranmadevi, Ambasamudram, Kalakkad and Pudukkottai. The last Pandyan king to be known in the history of the Pandyas was Kolakonda, who was also among the Tenkasi Pandyas.

Although the Vijayanagara Empire and the Nayaks ruled Madurai after the 14th century, they were occasionally opposed by the Pandyas. Sometimes they have ruled Madurai. Prominent among them were Saadavarman Vikrama Pandya (1401–1422 AD) and his son, Arikesari Parakrama Pandya. They had built 32 forts around Madurai. Later, when Vishwanatha Nayakkar became the Madurai Mandalasuvaran, he feared Pandya&#x27;s resurgence in Madurai. He divided Madurai into 72 districts, including 16 districts of those closest to the Pandyas. He gave them positions and made them separate from the Pandyas. This made Pandyas lose Madurai forever.
==== Legacy ====
While the previous sultanate raids were content with plunder, the Tughluqs under Ulugh Khan (later Muhammad bin Tughluq) annexed the former Pandya dominions to the sultanate as the province of Ma&#x27;bar. Most of south India came under the sultanate rule and was divided into five provinces – Devagiri, Tiling, Kampili, Dorasamudra and Ma&#x27;bar. Jalal ud-Din Hasan Khan was appointed governor of the newly created southernmost Ma&#x27;bar province. In , Jalal ud-Din Hasan Khan declared his independence and created Madurai sultanate. The Pandyas shifted their capital to Tenkasi and continued to rule a small area until the end of the 16th century as Tenkasi Pandyas.

Bukka Raya I of Vijayanagara empire conquered the city of Madurai in , imprisoned the sultan, released and restored Arcot&#x27;s prince Sambuva Raya to the throne. Bukka Raya I appointed his son Veera Kumara Kampana as the viceroy of the Tamil region. Meanwhile, the Madurai sultanate was replaced by the Nayak governors of Vijayanagara in 1378. In 1529 the Nayak governors declared independence and established Madurai Nayak dynasty.

==Economy==
=== Early history ===
The Pandya country, located at the extreme southwestern tip of South Asia, served as an important meeting point throughout the history of India. The location was economically and geopolitically significant as a key point connecting the shipping between Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Graeco-Roman merchants frequented the ancient Tamil country, present day south India and Sri Lanka, securing contacts with the Tamil chiefdoms of the Pandya, Chola and Chera families. The western sailors also established several trading settlements on the harbours of the ancient Tamil region. The trade with South Asia by the Greco-Roman world flourished since the time of the Ptolemaic dynasty a few decades before the start of the Common Era and remained long after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The contacts between south India and the Middle East continued even after the Byzantium&#x27;s loss of the ports of Egypt and the Red Sea in the 7th century CE.

The early historic Pandya country was famous for its supply of pearls. The ancient port of Korkai, in present-day Thoothukudi, was the centre of the pearl trade. Written records from Graeco-Roman and Egyptian voyagers give details about the pearl fisheries off the Gulf of Mannar. Greek historian Megasthenes reported about the pearl fisheries, indicating that the Pandyas derived great wealth from the pearl trade. Convicts were according to the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; used as pearl divers in Korkai. The &quot;Periplus&quot; even mentions that &quot;pearls inferior to the Indian sort are exported in great quantity from the marts of Apologas and Omana&quot;. The pearls from the Pandya country were also in demand in the kingdoms of north India. Literary references of the pearl fishing mention how the fishermen, who dive into the sea, avoid attacks from sharks, bring up the right-whorled chank and blow on the sounding shell.

=== Pandya coinage ===
The early coins of Tamilakam bore the symbols of the Three Crowned Kings, the tiger, the fish and the bow, representing the symbols of the Cholas, Pandyas and Cheras. Coins of Pandyas bear the legend of different Pandya ruler in different times. The Pandyas had issued silver punch-marked and die-struck copper coins in the early period. A few gold coins were attributed to the Pandya rulers of this period. These coins bore the image of fish, singly or in pairs, which were their emblem.

Some of the coins had the names Sundara, Sundara Pandya or merely the letter &#x27;Su&#x27; were etched. Some of the coins bore a boar with the legend of &#x27;Vira-Pandya. It had been said that those coins were issued by the Pandyas and the feudatories of the Cholas but could not be attributed to any particular king. The coins of Pandyas were square. Those coins were etched with an elephant on one side and the other side remained blank. The inscription on the silver and gold coins during the Pandyas were in Tamil-Brahmi and the copper coins bore the Tamil legends. The coins of the Pandyas, which bore the fish symbols, were termed as &#x27;Kodandaraman&#x27; and &#x27;Kanchi&#x27; Valangum Perumal&#x27;. Apart from these, &#x27;Ellamthalaiyanam&#x27; was seen on coins which had the standing king on one side and the fish on the other. &#x27;Samarakolahalam&#x27; and &#x27;Bhuvanekaviram&#x27; were found on the cois having a Garuda, &#x27;Konerirayan&#x27; on coins having a bull and &#x27;Kaliyugaraman&#x27; on coins that depict a pair of feet.

== Religion ==
The Pandya period (c. 13th century CE) was characterised by several elite forms of Hinduism, a popular bhakti religion and an even more widespread local form of Hinduism. The distinctions between the three were not differentiated. The worship of the gods Vishnu and Shiva was generally supported by the elite and Shiva was generally later supported by the elite. The bhakti movement emphasized the mutual intense emotional attachment between the god and the devotee.

The Pandya country was home to several renowned temples including the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai. As some of the largest employers and landowners of the Pandya country, the temples played an important part in the Tamil economy and society. They generally also served as banks, schools, dispensaries, and poorhouses (thus performing valuable social functions). The large walled temple complexes of the Pandya country also contained several administrative offices and bazaars.

It is known that the early Pandya rulers followed Jainism while at some point they converted to Hinduism. They supported the Bhakti movement from both Vaishnavism and Shaivism of Hinduism.

==Architecture==

The early temple architecture phase in Tamil Nadu opens with the rock-cut cave temples.

The Tamil country is home to the &#x27;South Indian&#x27; or &#x27;Dravidian&#x27; style of medieval temple architecture.
* Typical temple consists of a hall and a square sanctum (the gabhagrha)
* The foundation block, or socle, is known as the adhisthana.
* Walls of the sanctum are generally divided by pilasters.
* Superstructure: &#x27;kutina&#x27; type (stepped stories in pyramidal form with decorative bands/parapets or the hdras)
* The parapet is composed of miniature shrines (called the kutas and salas) connected by wall elements (the harantaras).
* On top, a necking that supports a solid dome, or cupola (crowned by a pot and finial)—the sikhara.
* Gopura: the great entrance buildings

The major Pandya contributions to Dravidian architecture come after the Pallava (7th–9th centuries) and the Chola periods (9th–12th centuries).
* Gopuras are extremely large and elaborately decorated (capped by a barrel vault).
* Successively built walls and gopuras.

Finest Pandyan architectures:

Jambukeswarar Temple, Tiruchirapalli
* Kallalagar temple, Alagar Koyil
* Meenakshi Temple, Madurai
* Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram

== In popular culture ==
The Pandyas are a secondary subject of the Tamil films &quot;Aayirathil Oruvan&quot; (2010), &quot;Ponniyin Selvan: I&quot; (2022), &quot;Ponniyin Selvan: II&quot; (2023), and &quot;Yaathisai&quot; (2023).

<text>The Atharvaveda or Atharva Veda (, , from &quot;&quot;, &quot;priest&quot; and &quot;&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot;) or is the &quot;knowledge storehouse of &quot;s&quot;, the procedures for everyday life&quot;. The text is the fourth Veda, and is a late addition to the Vedic scriptures of Hinduism.

The language of the Atharvaveda is different from Rigvedic Sanskrit, preserving pre-Vedic Indo-European archaisms. It is a collection of 730 hymns with about 6,000 mantras, divided into 20 books. About a sixth of the Atharvaveda texts adapt verses from the Rigveda, and except for Books 15 and 16, the text is mainly in verse deploying a diversity of Vedic meters. Two different recensions of the text – the and the – have survived into modern times. Reliable manuscripts of the Paippalada edition were believed to have been lost, but a well-preserved version was discovered among a collection of palm leaf manuscripts in Odisha in 1957.

The Atharvaveda is sometimes called the &quot;Veda of magical formulas&quot;, a description considered incorrect by other scholars. In contrast to the &#x27;hieratic religion&#x27; of the other three Vedas, the Atharvaveda is said to represent a &#x27;popular religion&#x27;, incorporating not only formulas for magic, but also the daily rituals for initiation into learning (&quot;upanayana&quot;), marriage and funerals. Royal rituals and the duties of the court priests are also included in the Atharvaveda.

The Atharvaveda was likely compiled as a Veda contemporaneously with Samaveda and Yajurveda, or about 1200 BCE – 1000 BCE. Along with the Samhita layer of text, the Atharvaveda includes a Brahmana text, and a final layer of the text that covers philosophical speculations. The latter layer of Atharvaveda text includes three primary Upanishads, influential to various schools of Hindu philosophy. These include the Mundaka Upanishad, the Mandukya Upanishad and the Prashna Upanishad.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The Veda may be named, states Monier Williams, after the mythical priest named &quot;Atharvan&quot; who was first to develop prayers to fire, offer Soma, and who composed &quot;formulas and spells intended to counteract diseases and calamities&quot;. The name Atharvaveda, states Laurie Patton, is for the text being &quot;Veda of the Atharvāṇas&quot;.

The oldest name of the text, according to its own verse 10.7.20, was &quot;Atharvangirasah&quot;, a compound of &quot;Atharvan&quot; and &quot;Angiras&quot;, both Vedic scholars. Each scholar called the text after itself, such as &quot;Saunakiya Samhita&quot;, meaning the &quot;compiled text of Saunakiya&quot;. The &quot;Atharvan&quot; and &quot;Angiras&quot; names, states Maurice Bloomfield, imply different things, with the former considered auspicious while the latter implying hostile sorcery practices. Over time, the positive auspicious side came to be celebrated and the name Atharva Veda became widespread. The latter name Angiras which is linked to Agni and priests in the Vedas, states George Brown, may also be related to Indo-European &quot;Angirôs&quot; found in an Aramaic text from Nippur.

Michael Witzel states the etymology of &quot;Atharvan&quot; is Proto Indo-Iranian &quot;*atharwan&quot; &quot;[ancient] priest, sorcerer&quot;, and it is cognate to Avestan &quot;āθrauuan&quot; &quot;priest&quot; and possibly related to Tocharian &quot;*athr&quot;, &quot;superior force&quot;.

The Atharvaveda is also occasionally referred to as &quot;Bhrgvangirasah&quot; and &quot;Brahmaveda&quot;, after Bhrigu and Brahma, respectively.

==Dating and historical context==
The Atharvaveda is dated by Flood at ca. 900 BCE, while Michael Witzel gives a dating at, or slightly after, c. 1200/1000 BCE.

The ancient Indian tradition initially recognized only three Vedas. The Rigveda, the verse 3.12.9.1 of Taittiriya Brahmana, the verse 5.32-33 of Aitareya Brahmana and other Vedic era texts mention only three Vedas. The acceptance of the Atharvanas hymns and traditional folk practices was slow, and it was accepted as another Veda much later than the first three, by both orthodox and heterodox traditions of Indian philosophies. The early Buddhist Nikaya texts, for example, do not recognize Atharvaveda as the fourth Veda, and make references to only three Vedas. Olson states that the ultimate acceptance of Atharvaveda as the fourth Veda probably came in the 2nd half of the 1st millennium BCE. However, notes Max Muller, the hymns of Atharvaveda existed by the time Chandogya Upanishad was completed (~700 BCE), but were then referred to as &quot;hymns of Atharvangirasah&quot;.

Frits Staal states that the text may be a compilation of poetry and knowledge that developed in two different regions of ancient India, the Kuru region in northern India and the Pancalas region of eastern India. The former was home to Paippalāda, whose name was derived from the sacred fig tree named &quot;Pippala&quot; (Sanskrit: पिप्पल). This school&#x27;s compositions were in the Rigvedic style. The Pancalas region contributions came from composer-priests Angirasas and Bhargavas, whose style was unlike the metric Rigvedic composition, and their content included forms of medical sorcery. The Atharvaveda editions now known are a combination of their compositions.

The core text of the Atharvaveda falls within the classical Mantra period of Vedic Sanskrit, during the 2nd millennium BC - younger than the Rigveda, and roughly contemporary with the Yajurveda mantras, the Rigvedic Khilani, and the . There is no absolute dating of any Vedic text including the Atharvaveda. The dating for Atharvaveda is derived from the new metals and items mentioned therein; it, for example, mentions iron (as , literally &quot;black metal&quot;), and such mentions have led Michael Witzel to the estimate that the Atharvaveda hymns were compiled in the early Indian Iron Age, at, or slightly after, c. 1200/1000 BCE. corresponding to the early Kuru Kingdom.

The priests who practised the Atharvaveda were considered to be the lowest tier of Brahmins, in comparison to the priests who practised the Rigveda, Samaveda, or Yajurveda [considered by whom?]. A stigma held by some against Atharvaveda priests is documented in Odisha well into the modern day.

==Text==

The Atharvaveda is a collection of 20 books, with a total of 730 hymns of about 6,000 stanzas. The text is, state Patrick Olivelle and other scholars, a historical collection of beliefs and rituals addressing practical issues of daily life of the Vedic society, and it is not a liturgical Yajurveda-style collection.

===Recensions===
The &quot;&quot;, a later era Sanskrit text, states that the Atharvaveda had nine shakhas, or schools: , , , , , , , and .

Of these, only the Shaunakiya recension, and the more recently discovered manuscripts of Paippalāda recension have survived. The Paippalāda edition is more ancient. The two recensions differ in how they are organized, as well as content. For example, the Book 10 of Paippalada recension is more detailed and observed carefully not doing a single mistake, more developed and more conspicuous in describing monism, the concept of &quot;oneness of Brahman, all life forms and the world&quot;.

===Organization===
The Atharvaveda Samhita originally was organized into 18 books (), and the last two were added later. These books are arranged neither by subject nor by authors (as is the case with the other Vedas), but by the length of the hymns. Each book generally has hymns of about a similar number of verses, and the surviving manuscripts label the book with the shortest hymns as Book 1, and then in an increasing order (a few manuscripts do the opposite). Most of the hymns are poetic and set to different meters, but about a sixth of the book is prose.

Most of the hymns of Atharvaveda are unique to it, except for the one sixth of its hymns that it borrows from the Rigveda, primarily from its 10th mandala. The 19th book was a supplement of a similar nature, likely of new compositions and was added later. The 143 hymns of the 20th book of Atharvaveda Samhita is almost entirely borrowed from the Rigveda.

The hymns of Atharvaveda cover a motley of topics, across its twenty books. Roughly, the first seven books focus primarily on magical poems for all sorts of healing and sorcery, and Michael Witzel states these are reminiscent of Germanic and Hittite sorcery stanzas, and may likely be the oldest section. Books 8 to 12 are speculations of a variety of topics, while Books 13 to 18 tend to be about life cycle rites of passage rituals.

The &quot;Srautasutra&quot; texts and the are attached to the Atharvaveda Shaunaka edition, as are a supplement of Atharvan &quot;Prayascitthas&quot;, two &quot;Pratishakhyas&quot;, and a collection of &quot;Parisisthas&quot;. For the Paippalada edition of Atharvaveda, corresponding texts were Agastya and Paithinasi Sutras but these are lost or yet to be discovered.

==Contents==
The Atharvaveda is sometimes called the &quot;Veda of magical formulas&quot;, an epithet declared to be incorrect by many scholars. The Samhita layer of the text likely represents a developing 2nd millennium BCE tradition of magico-religious rites to address superstitious anxiety, spells to remove maladies believed to be caused by demons, and herbs- and nature-derived potions as medicine. Many books of the Atharvaveda Samhita are dedicated to rituals without magic and to theosophy. The text, states Kenneth Zysk, is one of oldest surviving record of the evolutionary practices in religious medicine and reveals the &quot;earliest forms of folk healing of Indo-European antiquity&quot;.

The Atharvaveda Samhita contains hymns many of which were charms, magic spells and incantations meant to be pronounced by the person who seeks some benefit, or more often by a sorcerer who would say it on his or her behalf. The most frequent goal of these hymns, charms, and spells were long life of a loved one or recovery from some illness. In these cases, the affected would be given substances such as a plant (leaf, seed, root) and an amulet. Some magic spells were for soldiers going to war with the goal of defeating the enemy, others for anxious lovers seeking to remove rivals or to attract the lover who is less than interested, some for success at a sporting event, in economic activity, for bounty of cattle and crops, or removal of petty pest bothering a household. Some hymns were not about magic spells and charms, but prayer qua prayer and philosophical speculations.

The contents of the Atharvaveda contrasts with the other Vedas. The 19th century Indologist Weber summarized the contrast as follows,

Jan Gonda cautions that it would be incorrect to label Atharvaveda Samhita as mere compilation of magical formulas, witchcraft and sorcery. While such verses are indeed present in the Samhita layer, a significant portion of the Samhita text are hymns for domestic rituals without magic or spells, and some are theosophical speculations such as &quot;all Vedic gods are One&quot;. Additionally, the non-Samhita layers of Atharvaveda text include a Brahmana and several influential Upanishads.

===Samhita===

====Surgical and medical treatment====
The Atharvaveda includes mantras and verses for treating a variety of ailments. For example, the verses in hymn 4.15 of the recently discovered Paippalada version of the Atharvaveda, discuss how to deal with an open fracture, and how to wrap the wound with Rohini plant (&quot;Ficus infectoria&quot;, native to India):

====Charms against fever, jaundice and diseases====
Numerous hymns of the Atharvaveda are prayers and incantations wishing a child or loved one to get over some sickness and become healthy again, along with comforting the family members. The Vedic era assumption was that diseases are caused by evil spirits, external beings or demonic forces who enter the body of a victim to cause sickness. Hymn 5.21 of the Paippalāda edition of the text, for example, states,

====Remedy from medicinal herbs====
Several hymns in the Atharvaveda such as hymn 8.7, just like the Rigveda&#x27;s hymn 10.97, is a praise of medicinal herbs and plants, suggesting that speculations about the medical and health value of plants and herbs was an emerging field of knowledge in ancient India. The Atharvavedic hymn states (abridged),
====Spells and prayers to gain a lover, spouse====
The contents of the Atharvaveda have been studied to glean information about the social and cultural mores in the Vedic era of India. A number of verses relate to spells for gaining a husband, or a wife, or the love of a woman, or to prevent any rivals from winning over one&#x27;s &quot;love interest&quot;.

====Speculations on the nature of man, life, good and evil====
The Atharvaveda Samhita, as with the other Vedas, includes some hymns such as 4.1, 5.6, 10.7, 13.4, 17.1, 19.53-54, with metaphysical questions on the nature of existence, man, heaven and hell, good and evil. Hymn 10.7 of Atharvaveda, for example, asks questions such as &quot;what is the source of cosmic order? what and where is planted this notion of faith, holy duty, truth? how is earth and sky held? is there space beyond the sky? what are seasons and where do they go? does &quot;Skambha&quot; (literally &quot;cosmic pillar&quot;, synonym for Brahman) penetrate everything or just somethings? does &quot;Skambha&quot; know the future? is &quot;Skambha&quot; the basis of Law, Devotion and Belief? who or what is &quot;Skambha&quot;?&quot;

The Atharvaveda, like other Vedic texts, states William Norman Brown, goes beyond the duality of heaven and hell, and speculates on the idea of &quot;Skambha&quot; or &quot;Brahman&quot; as the all pervasive monism. Good and evil, &quot;Sat&quot; and &quot;Asat&quot; (truth and untruth) are conceptualized differently in these hymns of Atharvaveda, and the Vedic thought, wherein these are not dualistic explanation of nature of creation, universe or man, rather the text transcends these and the duality therein. Order is established out of chaos, truth is established out of untruth, by a process and universal principles that transcend good and evil.

====Prayer for peace====
Some hymns are prayer qua prayer, desiring harmony and peace. For example,

===Brahmana===
The Atharvaveda includes Gopatha Brahmana text, that goes with Atharva Samhita.

===Upanishads===
The Atharvaveda has three primary Upanishads embedded within it.

====Mundaka Upanishad====
The Mundaka Upanishad, embedded inside the Atharvaveda, is a poetic-style Upanishad with 64 verses, written in the form of mantras. However, these mantras are not used in rituals; rather they are used for teaching and meditation on spiritual knowledge. In ancient and medieval era Indian literature and commentaries, the Mundaka Upanishad is referred to as one of the Mantra Upanishads.

The &quot;Mundaka Upanishad&quot; contains three &quot;Mundakams&quot; (parts), each with two sections. The first Mundakam, states Roer, defines the sciences of &quot;Higher Knowledge&quot; and &quot;Lower Knowledge&quot;, and then asserts that the acts of oblations and pious gifts are foolish and do nothing to reduce unhappiness in the current life or the next - rather, it is knowledge that frees people. The second Mundakam describes the nature of the Brahman, the Atman (Self, Soul), and the path to know Brahman. The third Mundakam continues the discussion and then asserts that the state of knowing Brahman is one of freedom, fearlessness, liberation and bliss. The &quot;Mundaka Upanishad&quot; is one of text that discuss the pantheism theory in Hindu scriptures. The text, like other Upanishads, also discusses ethics.

====Mandukya Upanishad====
The Mandukya Upanishad is the shortest of all the Upanishads, found in the Atharvaveda text. The text discusses the syllable Om, presents the theory of four states of consciousness, and asserts the existence and nature of the Atman (Soul, Self).

The Mandukya Upanishad is notable for inspiring Gaudapada&#x27;s &quot;Karika&quot;, a classic of the Vedanta school of Hinduism. The Mandukya Upanishad is among the oft-cited texts on chronology and the philosophical relationship between Hinduism and Buddhism.

====Prashna Upanishad====
The Prashna Upanishad is from the &quot;Paippalada&quot; school of Atharvavedins.

The text contains six &quot;Prashna&quot; (questions), and each forms a chapter with a discussion of its answers. The first three questions are profound metaphysical questions but, states Eduard Roer, they do not contain any defined philosophical answers; they are mostly embellished mythology and symbolism. The fourth section, in contrast, contains some substantial philosophy. The last two sections discuss the symbol Om and the concept of Moksha.

The Prashna Upanishad is notable for its structure and its sociological insights into the education process in ancient India.

==Manuscripts and translations==
The Shaunakiya text was published by Rudolf Roth and William Dwight Whitney in 1856, by Shankar Pandurang Pandit in the 1890s, and by Vishva Bandhu in 1960–1962. The first complete English translation was made by Ralph T.H. Griffith in 1895-96, followed shortly by Maurice Bloomfield&#x27;s translation of about one third of the hymns in 1897. These were followed by a nearly complete translation (missing Book 20) with textual commentary by William Dwight Whitney, published in 1905, which is still cited in contemporary scholarship.

A corrupted and badly damaged version of the text was edited by Leroy Carr Barret from 1905 to 1940 from a single Kashmirian manuscript (now in Tübingen). Durgamohan Bhattacharyya discovered palm leaf manuscripts of the Paippalada recension in Odisha in 1957. His son Dipak Bhattacharya has published the manuscripts. Thomas Zehnder translated Book 2 of the Paippalada recension into German in 1999, and Arlo Griffiths, Alexander Lubotsky and Carlos Lopez have separately published English translations of its Books 5 through 15.

The Gopatha Brahmana was translated by Hukam Chand Patyal as a dissertation at Pune University.

==Influence==
===Medicine and health care===
Kenneth Zysk states that the &quot;magico-religious medicine had given way to a medical system based on empirical and rational ideas&quot; in ancient India by around the start of Christian era, still the texts and people of India continued to revere the ancient Vedic texts. Rishi Sushruta, remembered for his contributions to surgical studies, credits Atharvaveda as a foundation. Similarly, the verse 30.21 of the Caraka Samhita, states it reverence for the Atharvaveda as follows,

The roots of Ayurveda – a traditional medical and health care practice in India—states Dominik Wujastyk, are in the texts called Caraka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita, both of which say that doctors, when asked, should assert their allegiance and inspiration to be the Vedas, especially Atharvaveda. Khare and Katiyar state that the Indian tradition directly links Ayurveda to Atharvaveda.

Wujastyk clarifies that the Vedic texts are a religious discourse and while herbal health care traditions are found in Atharvaveda, the systematic, scholarly medical literature of ancient India is first found in the Caraka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita. Kenneth Zysk adds &quot;Bhela Samhita&quot; to this list.

===Literature===
The verse 11.7.24 of Atharvaveda contains the oldest known mention of the Indic literary genre the Puranas.

The 1st millennium AD Buddhist literature included books of magico-religious mantras and spells for protection from evil influences of non-human beings such as demons and ghosts. These were called &quot;Pirita&quot; (Pali: Paritta) and &quot;Rakkhamanta&quot; (&quot;mantra for protection&quot;), and they share premises and style of hymns found in Atharvaveda.

<text>Skye Alexandra Sweetnam (born May 5, 1988) is a Canadian rock and metal singer. She first entered the music industry in 2003 with the release of her debut single &quot;Billy S.&quot; More than a year later, her debut studio album, &quot;Noise from the Basement&quot;, was released along with the singles &quot;Tangled Up in Me&quot; and &quot;Number One&quot;. Sweetnam is also known for her singing work as Barbie in &quot;The Barbie Diaries&quot;. In 2006, she was nominated for a Juno Award for New Artist of the Year. Her second studio album, &quot;Sound Soldier&quot;, was released in 2007. She is currently the lead singer of the band Sumo Cyco; upon joining the band, she took the stage name Sever.

==Early life==
Skye was born on May 5, 1988, to Deirdre and Greg Sweetnam. She was named after the Isle of Skye in Scotland. Along with her sister, Aurora, and her brother, Cam, she was born and raised in Bolton, a community in Caledon, Ontario, where she studied dancing and singing from a young age. She began singing at the age of five, performing for family members and friends.

==Career==
===2002–2006: Noise from the Basement===
In 2002, Sweetnam began working with Canadian producer and instrumentalist James Robertson on what would later become &quot;Noise from the Basement&quot;, her Capitol Records/EMI debut. She recorded this album on a Shure 57 microphone. The album was recorded as demos and then it was officially mastered by producers at Capitol Records. The single &quot;Billy S.&quot; appeared in July 2003 on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;How to Deal&quot; and quickly took off in Canada. Two more singles were released from the debut album; they fared moderately on the charts. In 2004, Sweetnam went on tour over Europe and North America as the opening act for Britney Spears on her Onyx Hotel Tour.

Sweetnam also provided the theme songs for various television shows including &quot;The Buzz on Maggie&quot; for Disney Channel, &quot;Wayside&quot; for Teletoon, and &quot;Radio Free Roscoe&quot;. She also covered &quot;Part of Your World&quot; from the 1989 Disney film &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; for the compilation albums &quot;Disneymania 3&quot; and &quot;DisneyRemixMania&quot;. In 2006, Sweetnam provided the singing voice for Barbie in &quot;The Barbie Diaries&quot;. Her songs &quot;Girl Most Likely To&quot;, &quot;Note to Self&quot;, &quot;Real Life&quot;, and &quot;This Is Me&quot;, were also included in the soundtrack to &quot;The Barbie Diaries&quot;.

===2007–2008: &quot;Sound Soldier&quot;===
In March 2007, Sweetnam and Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong released the single &quot;Into Action&quot;, a song written by Armstrong for Sweetnam&#x27;s upcoming 
&quot;Sound Soldier&quot; album. The song also featured The Aggrolites. Sweetnam was the opening act for Canadian Idol winner Kalan Porter on tour.

Her album &quot;Sound Soldier&quot; was released October 30, 2007; its lead single, &quot;Human&quot;, was nominated for a 2008 MuchMusic Video Award for Best Cinematography, but lost to Hedley&#x27;s &quot;She&#x27;s So Sorry&quot;. For the second single EMI picked &quot;(Let&#x27;s Get Movin&#x27;) Into Action&quot;, a rework of her previous single with Armstrong. Sweetnam directed two music videos herself for &quot;Music Is My Boyfriend&quot; and &quot;Babydoll Gone Wrong&quot;. Throughout the late 2000s, she utilized MySpace to release several songs from &quot;Sound Soldier&quot;. Meanwhile, in her YouTube make-up tutorials, Sweetnam has used the songs &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Baby&quot;, &quot;Love Sugar Sweet&quot;, &quot;Heartbreak&quot;, &quot;Boomerang&quot;, &quot;MuSick&quot;, and &quot;Wolves and Witches&quot;. Sweetnam also released a song entitled &quot;Stay&quot;, along with &quot;Boomerang&quot;, &quot;MuSick&quot; and &quot;Wolves and Witches&quot;, on her MySpace page.

Sweetnam&#x27;s song &quot;(Let&#x27;s Get Movin&#x27;) Into Action&quot; was also used in an episode of the Canadian teen drama &quot;&quot;, in one deleted scene from &quot;Bandslam&quot;, and in the films &quot;Balls Out: Gary the Tennis Coach&quot;, &quot;Hotel for Dogs&quot;, and the 2010 popular film &quot;Ramona and Beezus&quot; (starring Joey King and Selena Gomez). It was also included in the soundtrack for &quot;Music from Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot;.

Sweetnam also recorded &quot;Where I Want to Be&quot; for Jun Senoue&#x27;s album, &quot;The Works&quot;, and directed a music video for Leah Daniels&#x27; song &quot;Northern Señorita&quot; as well as for Ashes&#x27; song &quot;Explode (Makes My Head)&quot;. Sweetnam also co-wrote two songs for Ashes.

===2009–present: Sumo Cyco===
Sweetnam began working on new music in 2009 and formed a new band, Sumo Cyco, a four-piece heavy metal and punk rock band that opened for Hollywood Undead in Toronto in April 2011. Sweetnam now went by the name Sever, which was her current alter-ego.

, Sumo Cyco has released six singles: &quot;Mercy&quot;, &quot;Limp&quot;, &quot;Interceptor&quot;, &quot;Danger&quot;, &quot;Loose Cannon&quot;, and a cover of Oingo Boingo&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Want to Be?&quot;. With each new song, Sumo Cyco would direct and put together their music videos for their YouTube channel which, , has received over seven million views.

On June 9, 2012, Sweetnam posted a video on her YouTube channel that promised that new material would eventually be released.

In April and May 2014, Sumo Cyco toured Ireland and the UK after performing at Indie Week Ireland. Then, on June 10, 2014, they released their debut album, &quot;Lost in Cyco City&quot;, in Canada.

On March 10, 2015, Sumo Cyco announced that they had signed with TKO (The Kirby Organization) Booking Agency, known for its representation of hard rock and metal acts, for worldwide representation.

Sumo Cyco released their second album, &quot;Opus Mar&quot;, in 2017.

In January 2020, the band announced they had signed a deal with Napalm Records. They released their third album, &quot;Initiation&quot;, through Napalm Records on May 7th, 2021.

<doc id="975393" wikidata="Q768045" url="?curid=975393" title="Terraplane">
<text>The Terraplane was a car brand and model built by the Hudson Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan, between 1932 and 1938. In its maiden year, the car was branded as the Essex-Terraplane; in 1934 the car became simply the Terraplane. They were inexpensive, yet powerful vehicles that were used in both town and country. The Terraplane name was used for both cars and trucks.



== Changing marketplace ==
Hudson had manufactured the inexpensive Essex from 1919 as a lower-priced vehicle line; the company merged Essex into itself in 1922. The Essex is generally credited with helping to make the fully enclosed automobile an affordable model for inexpensive automobiles. The low-priced closed model Essex coach &quot;had promoted the sensational recovery of Hudson&quot; as an automaker in 1922.

Declining sales of the Essex, combined with the growing economic pressure and suffering from the effects of the Great Depression forced Hudson to replace the Essex with a re-designed automobile with a lower manufacturing cost and selling price. Roy D. Chapin decided to repeat the successful strategy in 1932 by producing &quot;a very light car in the bottom price class, a vehicle which would combine style, comfort, and reliability&quot;. Although it was daring to launch a car during the Great Depression, Chapin was convinced that the Terraplane name would have &quot;great public appeal&quot; as it also linked with the public interest in aviation that was so prevalent at that time.

The Terraplane contributed greatly to Hudson Motor&#x27;s sales during the Depression in the 1930s. Sales of the Terraplane outpaced Hudson vehicles in the late mid-1930s and it is said that Hudson management was not fond of that fact and that was partly why they chose to eliminate the car as a make. One unique feature was &quot;Duo-Automatic&quot; brakes. Terraplanes had two brake systems—hydraulic and mechanical. Should the hydraulic brakes fail (i.e. the brake line had a leak in it), the mechanical brakes would be used to stop the car.

The most memorable sales slogan of the Terraplane years came from 1933: &quot;On the sea that&#x27;s aquaplaning, in the air that&#x27;s aeroplaning, but on the land, in the traffic, on the hills, hot diggity dog, THAT&#x27;S TERRAPLANING&quot;.

===1932===
The new Essex-Terraplane was launched on July 21, 1932, &quot;with [such] sensational vigor&quot; that &quot;accounts of the affair appeared in newspapers throughout the United States.&quot; The special event included over 2,000 dealers who came from 40 states to Detroit. Hudson also had famous aviator Amelia Earhart helping to introduce the first Essex-Terraplane. It was a small, but very powerful, car with a steel frame, built to exacting standards, which is probably why Orville Wright purchased one of the first Essex-Terraplanes for himself. The 1932 model bore a slight resemblance to its Essex predecessors. The 1932 model had just the name &quot;Essex&quot; on the radiator ornament, but the 1933 models had the name &quot;Essex-Terraplane&quot; on the radiator ornament.

In 1932, only the Model K on the wheelbase with a 6-cylinder engine was available.

===1933===
The Essex-Terraplanes were available in all the common U.S. automobile body styles. For 1933 offerings were expanded. The Model K was retained. A Model KU 6-cylinder on wheelbase was added. Also a Model KT with a straight-8-cylinder was offered on the 113-inch wheelbase. There were &quot;Standard&quot; and &quot;Deluxe&quot; trim levels for the KU and KT. A limited selection of light commercial vehicles was offered starting in 1933.

Only the 1933 Essex-Terraplanes were made with an optional eight-cylinder engine. The Hudson had the identical basic engine, but with earlier style updraft carburetor carried over, and a displacement of due to a larger cylinder bore than the Essex-Terraplane Eight. The Terraplane Eight engines featured more efficient downdraft carburetion. Both engines had the same crankshaft and stroke.

The 1933 Essex-Terraplane 8-cylinder cars were believed to have the highest horsepower-to-weight ratio of any production automobiles in the world, and were favored by several gangsters of the day, particularly John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and John Paul Chase, for their lightness, acceleration, handling, and discreet appearance.

The Essex-Terraplane Eight was distinguished by having vent doors on the hood as opposed to all six-cylinder versions that had stamped hood louvers. A 1933 Terraplane 8 convertible coupe set a record for the race to the summit of Mount Washington that remained unbroken for over twenty years. Essex-Terraplanes participated in innumerable record events around the United States, and some others around the world setting dozens of records at many venues. Their particular strength was in hillclimbs. Period road tests showed 0-60 mph in 14.4 seconds, and 10-60 mph in top gear in 18 seconds.

===1934===
For 1934 the word &quot;Essex&quot; was dropped and the car became the Terraplane. The cars were slightly heavier and rarely joined competitive events, particularly as they now lacked the eight-cylinder powerplant. The name Terraplane remained constant through the 1937 model year. By 1936, Terraplane commercial cars were produced in larger numbers.

===1938===
In 1938, knowing they were going to drop the Terraplane, Hudson management chose to phase out the Terraplane name similarly to how it had been introduced, and the 1938 cars were named Hudson-Terraplanes. Concurrently for the 1938 model year, Hudson offered a Model 112 which was virtually indistinguishable in equipment from the Hudson Terraplane, but on a shorter wheelbase and with a smaller engine. The Terraplane did not have an ammeter or an oil pressure gauge. Price for a Terraplane in 1938 was about US$900 ($ in dollars ).

==International markets==
Hudson vehicles were assembled in other countries under license. The British sounding names of &quot;Hudson&quot; and &quot;Essex&quot; had made them popular in countries of the Commonwealth, and thus Terraplanes also were built outside the U.S. in Canada, England, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa in low volume.

===Australia===

Australian law in the early 20th Century made it impractical to import a fully assembled car and thus main bodies were built by local vehicle body builders over an imported chassis. In a few cases these bodies included styles not available in the U.S. market such as tourers (U.S. equivalent phaeton) and coupe utilities (the Australian car-based pickup truck).

In 1915 the Sydney branch of Dalgety &amp; Co. Ltd became the distributor of Hudson and Essex vehicles as well as other marques for New South Wales. From 1922, Sydney company Smith &amp; Waddington built vehicle bodies for Dalgety and other companies. Smith &amp; Waddington built the majority of the early Terraplane bodies with some also built by Sydney coach builder G.H Olding &amp; Sons. In February 1934 Ruskins Body Works of West Melbourne secured the contract to build Hudson and Terraplane bodies for the whole of Australia. In June 1937 Neal&#x27;s Motors celebrated assembling its 30,000th automobile: a 1937 Hudson Terraplane.

===New Zealand===

Hudson and Essex vehicles were imported into New Zealand by Dominion Motors of Wellington which began operations in 1912. After Dominion Motors amalgamated with Universal Motor Company of Christchurch in 1919 the company added other marques from the United States and Britain. Vehicles, including Terraplanes, were assembled in-house from knock-down kits.

For South Island, Hudson and Essex vehicles were imported by W.G. Vining Limited of Nelson, beginning in 1912. Other U.S. and European brands were added and after the business was sold on 30 September 1927 Vining&#x27;s son formed a new business, P. Vining &amp; Scott, and continued the Hudson and Essex franchise.

From 1935, Hudson and Terraplane vehicles (along with Nash, Studebaker, and Standard) were assembled by Christchurch company Motor Assemblies Limited. Production of all other marques ended when the company was acquired by Standard-Triumph International in 1954.

===United Kingdom===
Following the First World War, Hudsons and Essex vehicles were sold through ten concessionaires. In 1922 Hudson-Essex Motors of Great Britain Limited was formed, with new premises on Dordrecht Road, in Acton Vale. In 1926 a factory was built on 4½ acres of ground on the recently opened Great West Road in Brentford. The plant opened in 1927 and a year later a three-story building was built as a service department for Hudson and Essex vehicles. The factory assembled the vehicle chassis locally but the bodies were imported as complete units from Detroit.

From 1932, the bodies came over from the United States in sections to be assembled at the Great West Road factory. After the Essex marque was retired in 1932 the British company was renamed Hudson Motors Ltd.

Hudson&#x27;s new Terraplane model was equally as popular in the U.K as it was in the United States. English-designed and built bodies were built on the Terraplane frames and the cars were even entered in a number of races including the Monte Carlo Rally. Some of the cars entered were driven by personnel from the Great West Road factory. The Team Award was won by two Terraplane tourers and a Terraplane saloon in the 1933 Scottish Rally.

=== British Railton cars ===

The Terraplane 8-cylinder chassis and engine was also used in the British Railton automobiles for their initial production year 1933.

The 1934 Light Sports Tourer used a lightweight open four-seater body and mildly modified engine. It achieved 0-60 mph in 8.8 seconds, a sensational time pre-war, and a top speed of 107 mph on the 3.3:1 rear axle. The engine was so flexible that it could be driven in circles on full lock in top gear without snatching.

Numerous coach builders constructed Railton bodies for the Terraplane and later Hudson chassis. Railton cars continued to be built on 1934 Hudson 8, and later Hudson 6- and 8-cylinder chassis through 1939. The company was bought by Hudson in 1939.

<text>Radnor is a community which straddles Montgomery and Delaware Counties, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located approximately 13 miles west of Philadelphia, in the Main Line suburbs. The community was named after Radnor, in Wales.

Radnor is home to Cabrini University and a large office complex by the train station. The southern portion, by Lancaster Avenue, was rapidly commercialized in the 1980s, and it is currently one of suburban Philadelphia&#x27;s premier office destinations.

==History==
The community of Radnor was founded in 1686 at the Radnor Friends Meetinghouse, which was located on Conestoga Road, a bypass of Lancaster Avenue connecting Devon and Bryn Mawr. During the Revolutionary War, the meetinghouse was used as an outpost for General George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army. In 1872, the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Main Line was constructed, which briefly passed through the southern section of Radnor. A station serving the town was established at King of Prussia Road, approximately one mile south of the Meetinghouse.

For much of its history, Radnor was primarily a farming community, and relatively undeveloped, even past World War II. Its town center, around the Meetinghouse, remained quaint and secluded from denser development seen in the nearby communities of Wayne and Bryn Mawr. However, starting in the 1980s, Radnor started to see great residential and commercial development, mostly stemming from suburban development for Philadelphia. Additionally, office parks began to spring up in the southern portion of the community, by the train station, primarily due to safety concerns in Center City. Some big name firms, such as Lincoln National Corporation, moved their headquarters from Center City to Radnor, and currently the community is best known for its financial hub around the train station.

In the 1970s, highway planners envisioned the Blue Route expressway passing through Radnor, approximately .3 mile east of the Meetinghouse. The project faced severe backlash from the Radnor community, as what was initially known as a quiet, rural feeling town would have a lot more noise. Despite attempts to quell the project, the community eventually lost, and the Blue Route opened in the 1990s on the initial alignment.

Radnor is where the SEPTA Paoli/Thorndale Line and Norristown High Speed Line intersect. However, the stations are not located at the intersection requiring a small bus ride to transfer. There are plans to build a transfer station where the two lines intersect. A shopping district is also planned here. Work is expected to commence in 2022.

== Geography ==
Like many Main Line communities, Radnor straddles Montgomery and Delaware Counties. The Delaware County portion is very affluent, and was developed prior to World War II. However, both the Montgomery County portion and the extreme southern portion (south of the train line), were developed much later.

Radnor does not have a traditional developed town center, though there are a couple shops and restaurants immediately north of the train station on King of Prussia road. The nearby communities of Wayne, Bryn Mawr, and King of Prussia offer shopping and entertainment.

Radnor is bounded to the west by Wayne, to the south by Villanova, to the east by Gladwyne, and to the northeast by Gulph Mills.

The community is served by the Paoli/Thorndale Line of SEPTA Regional Rail, as well as Lancaster Avenue and Interstate 476. It is also not too far from Interstate 76, providing access to King of Prussia and Center City Philadelphia.

Radnor has a humid continental climate with hot summers, bordering a humid subtropical climate. It is considerably cooler than Center City Philadelphia due to a relatively higher elevation and the urban heat island effect.

== Demographics ==
Radnor Township Demographics include White 76%, Asian. 9%, Hispanic. 6% , African American. 5% , Two or more races. 4% , Other race. 0%.
The population of the township is 31875

==Economy==
Radnor contains the largest commercial business district on the Main Line. Located immediately around the town&#x27;s train station are several suburban office complexes. Among the companies based in Radnor are real estate company Brandywine Realty Trust, energy company Penn Virginia, insurer Lincoln National, wholesaler VWR, technology company Qlik, and financial company Mondrian Investment Partners.

Radnor&#x27;s town center around the Meetinghouse isn&#x27;t well developed, but the nearby communities of Wayne and Bryn Mawr offer several shops and restaurants. Radnor is also easily accessible to King of Prussia.

==Education==
Public education in Radnor is administered by Radnor Township School District.

Closest universities include Cabrini University, Eastern University, and Villanova University.

==In popular culture==
Radnor is identified in the script as the setting for Philip Barry&#x27;s play &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;.

Radnor is also the setting of Judy Blume&#x27;s young adult novel, &quot;Blubber&quot;.

Radnor High School was the model for Rydell High School in &quot;Grease&quot;; the director, Randal Kleiser, is a member of the Class of 1964.

<text>The Yajurveda (, , from , &quot;worship&quot;, and , &quot;knowledge&quot;) is the Veda primarily of prose mantras for worship rituals. An ancient Vedic Sanskrit text, it is a compilation of ritual-offering formulas that were said by a priest while an individual performed ritual actions such as those before the yajna fire. Yajurveda is one of the four Vedas, and one of the scriptures of Hinduism. The exact century of Yajurveda&#x27;s composition is unknown, and estimated by Witzel to be between 1200 and 800 BCE, contemporaneous with Samaveda and Atharvaveda.

The Yajurveda is broadly grouped into two – the &quot;black&quot; or &quot;dark&quot; (&quot;Krishna&quot;) Yajurveda and the &quot;white&quot; or &quot;bright&quot; (&quot;Shukla&quot;) Yajurveda. The term &quot;black&quot; implies &quot;the un-arranged, unclear, motley collection&quot; of verses in Yajurveda, in contrast to the &quot;white&quot; which implies the &quot;well arranged, clear&quot; Yajurveda. The black Yajurveda has survived in four recensions, while two recensions of white Yajurveda have survived into modern times.

The earliest and most ancient layer of Yajurveda samhita includes about 1,875 verses, that are distinct yet borrow and build upon the foundation of verses in Rigveda. The middle layer includes the Satapatha Brahmana, one of the largest Brahmana texts in the Vedic collection. The youngest layer of Yajurveda text includes the largest collection of primary Upanishads, influential to various schools of Hindu philosophy. These include the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the Isha Upanishad, the Taittiriya Upanishad, the Katha Upanishad, the Shvetashvatara Upanishad and the Maitri Upanishad.

Two of the oldest surviving manuscript copies of the &quot;Shukla Yajurveda&quot; sections have been discovered in Nepal and Western Tibet, and these are dated to the 12th-century CE.

==Etymology==

Yajurveda is a compound Sanskrit word, composed of &quot;yajus&quot; (यजुस्) and &quot;Veda&quot; (वेद). Monier-Williams translates &quot;yajus&quot; as &quot;religious reverence, veneration, worship, sacrifice, a sacrificial prayer, formula, particularly mantras uttered in a peculiar manner at a sacrifice&quot;. &quot;Veda&quot; means &quot;knowledge&quot;. Johnson states &quot;yajus&quot; means &quot;(mostly) prose formulae or mantras, contained in the Yajur Veda, which are muttered&quot;.

Michael Witzel interprets Yajurveda to mean a &quot;knowledge text of prose mantras&quot; used in Vedic rituals. Ralph Griffith interprets the name to mean &quot;knowledge of sacrifice or sacrificial texts and formulas&quot;. Carl Olson states that Yajurveda is a text of &quot;mantras (sacred formulas) that are repeated and used in rituals&quot;.

==Dating and historical context==
The core text of the Yajurveda falls within the classical Mantra period of Vedic Sanskrit at the end of the 2nd millennium BCE – younger than the Rigveda, and roughly contemporary with the Atharvaveda, the Rigvedic Khilani, and the . The scholarly consensus dates the bulk of the Yajurveda and Atharvaveda hymns to the early Indian Iron Age, after c. 1200 and before 800 BCE.

==Text==

===Recensions===
The Yajurveda text includes Shukla Yajurveda of which about 16 recensions (known as &quot;Shaakhaa&quot;s) are known, while the Krishna Yajurveda may have had as many as 86 recensions. Only two recensions of the Shukla Yajurveda have survived, Madhyandina and Kanva, and others are known by name only because they are mentioned in other texts. These two recensions are nearly the same, except for a few differences. In contrast to Shukla Yajurveda, the four surviving recensions of Krishna Yajurveda are very different versions.

====Shukla Yajurveda====
The samhita in the Shukla Yajurveda is called the &quot;Vajasaneyi Samhita&quot;. The name &quot;Vajasaneyi&quot; is derived from Vajasaneya, the patronymic of Yajnavalkya, and the founder of the Vajasaneyi branch. There are two (nearly identical) surviving recensions of the Vajasaneyi Samhita (VS): &quot;Vajasaneyi Madhyandina&quot; and &quot;Vajasaneyi Kanva&quot;. The lost recensions of the White Yajurveda, mentioned in other texts of ancient India, include &quot;Jabala&quot;, &quot;Baudhya&quot;, &quot;Sapeyi&quot;, &quot;Tapaniya&quot;, &quot;Kapola&quot;, &quot;Paundravatsa&quot;, &quot;Avati&quot;, &quot;Paramavatika&quot;, &quot;Parasara&quot;, &quot;Vaineya&quot;, &quot;Vaidheya&quot;, &quot;Katyayana&quot; and &quot;Vaijyavapa&quot;.


====Krishna Yajurveda====
There are four surviving recensions of the Krishna Yajurveda – , , and . A total of eighty six recensions are mentioned to exist in Vayu Purana, however vast majority of them are believed to be lost. The Katha school is referred to as a sub-school of &quot;Carakas&quot; (wanderers) in some ancient texts of India, because they did their scholarship as they wandered from place to place. In contrast to the Shukla Yajurveda, the saṃhitās of the Krishna Yajurveda contained both mantras and explanatory prose (which would usually belong to the brāhmaṇas).

The most modern recensions is the &quot;&quot;. Some attribute it to Tittiri, a pupil of Yaska and mentioned by Panini. The text is associated with the &quot;Taittiriya&quot; school of the Yajurveda, and attributed to the pupils of sage Tittiri (literally, partridge birds).

The &quot;&quot; is the oldest Yajurveda Samhita that has survived, and it differs largely in content from the Taittiriyas, as well as in some different arrangement of chapters, but is much more detailed.

The &#x27; or the &#x27;, according to tradition was compiled by Katha, a disciple of Vaisampayana. Like the Maitrayani Samhita, it offers much more detailed discussion of some rituals than the younger &quot;Taittiriya samhita&quot; that frequently summarizes such accounts. The &#x27; or the &#x27;, named after the sage Kapisthala is extant only in some large fragments and edited without accent marks. This text is practically a variant of the &quot;&quot;.

===Organization===
Each regional edition (recension) of Yajurveda had Samhita, Brahmana, Aranyakas, Upanishads as part of the text, with Shrautasutras, Grhyasutras and Pratishakhya attached to the text. In Shukla Yajurveda, the text organization is same for both Madhayndina and Kanva shakhas. The texts attached to Shukla Yajurveda include the &quot;Katyayana Shrautasutra&quot;, &quot;Paraskara Grhyasutra&quot; and &quot;Shukla Yajurveda Pratishakhya&quot;.

In Krishna Yajurveda, each of the recensions has or had their Brahmana text mixed into the Samhita text, thus creating a motley of the prose and verses, and making it unclear, disorganized.

==Contents==

===Samhitas===
The &quot;Vajasaneyi Samhita&quot; has forty chapters or &quot;adhyayas&quot;, containing the formulas used with the following rituals:
;Structure of the mantras
The various ritual mantras in the Yajurveda Samhitas are typically set in a meter, and call on Vedic deities such as the Savita (Sun), Indra, Agni, Prajapati, Rudra and others. The Taittiriya Samhita in Book 4, for example, includes the following verses for the Agnicayana ritual recitation (abridged),
===Satapatha Brahmana===

The title &quot;Satapatha Brahmana&quot; means &quot;Brahmana of the Hundred Paths&quot;. It is one of the largest Brahmana text that has survived. It includes, states Staal, a &quot;veritable encyclopedia of meandering opinions on ritual and other matters&quot;.

The Satapatha Brahmana was translated by Eggeling in late 19th-century, reprinted often and has been well read because of the translation. However, it has been misinterpreted and misused, states Staal, because &quot;it contains enough material to support &quot;any&quot; theory&quot;. Eggeling, the first translator of Satapatha Brahmana called it &quot;flimsy symbolism rather than serious reasoning&quot;, similar to &quot;speculative vaporings&quot; found in the Christian and non-Christian variety of Gnosticism.

===Upanishads===
The Yajurveda has six primary Upanishads embedded within it.

====Brihadaranyaka Upanishad====
The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is found in the White Yajurveda. It is one of the Mukhya Upanishads, and among the largest and oldest as well (~700 BCE). It is a key scripture of Hinduism that has influenced all schools of Hindu philosophy. The text is a treatise on Ātman (Soul, Self), with passages on metaphysics, ethics and a yearning for knowledge that influenced various Indian religions, ancient and medieval scholars.

The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is among the earliest extensive discussions of the Hindu concept of dharma, karma and moksha (liberation from sorrow, freedom, emancipation, self-realization). Paul Deussen calls it, &quot;unique in its richness and warmth of presentation&quot;, with profoundness that retains its full worth in modern times. Max Muller illustrated its style as follows,

====Isha Upanishad====
The Isha Upanishad is found in the White Yajurveda. It is one of the shortest Upanishads, embedded as the final chapter of the Shukla Yajurveda. A key scripture of the Vedanta sub-schools of Hinduism, its name is derived from &quot;hidden in the Lord (Self)&quot;.

The Isha Upanishad discusses the Atman (Soul, Self) theory of Hinduism, and is referenced by both Dvaita (dualism) and Advaita (non-dualism) sub-schools of Vedanta. It is classified as a &quot;poetic Upanishad&quot; along with Kena, Katha, Svetasvatara and Mandukya Upanishads.

==== Taittiriya Upanishad====
The Taittiriya Upanishad is found in the black Yajurveda. It is the seventh, eighth and ninth chapters of Taittiriya Aranyaka, which are also called, respectively, the &quot;Siksha Valli&quot;, the &quot;Ananda Valli&quot; and the &quot;Bhrigu Valli&quot;.

The Taittiriya Upanishad includes verses that are partly prayers and benedictions, partly instruction on phonetics and praxis, partly advice on ethics and morals given to graduating students from ancient Vedic &quot;gurukul&quot; (schools), partly a treatise on allegory, and partly philosophical instruction.

The text offers a view of education system in ancient India. It also includes sections on ethics and invocation for one&#x27;s personal development. Max Muller translates the text&#x27;s tenth anuvaka, for example, as an affirmation of one&#x27;s Self as a capable, empowered blissful being. The tenth anuvaka asserts, &quot;I am he who shakes the tree. I am glorious like the top of a mountain. I, whose pure light (of knowledge) has risen, am that which is truly immortal, as it resides in the sun. I (Soul, Self) am the treasure, wise, immortal, imperishable. This is the teaching of the Veda, by sage Trisanku.&quot;

====Katha Upanishad====
The Katha Upanishad is found in the black Yajurveda. The Upanishad is the legendary story of a little boy, Nachiketa – the son of sage Vajasravasa, who meets Yama – the Indian deity of death. Their conversation evolves to a discussion of the nature of man, knowledge, Ātman (Soul, Self) and moksha (liberation).

The Kathaka Upanishad is an important ancient Sanskrit corpus of the Vedanta sub-schools. It asserts that &quot;Atman (Soul, Self) exists&quot;, teaches the precept &quot;seek Self-knowledge which is Highest Bliss&quot;, and expounds on this premise like the other primary Upanishads of Hinduism. The detailed teachings of Katha Upanishad have been variously interpreted, as Dvaita (dualistic) and as Advaita (non-dualistic).

The Katha Upanishad found in the Yajurveda is among the most widely studied Upanishads. Philosophers such as Arthur Schopenhauer praised it, Edwin Arnold rendered it in verse as &quot;The Secret of Death&quot;, and Ralph Waldo Emerson credited Katha Upanishad for the central story at the end of his essay &quot;Immortality&quot;, as well as his poem &quot;Brahma&quot;.

==== Shvetashvatara Upanishad====
The Shvetashvatara Upanishad is found in the black Yajurveda. The text opens with metaphysical questions about the primal cause of all existence, its origin, its end, and what role if any did time, nature, necessity, chance, the spirit had as primal cause? It then develops its answer, concluding that &quot;the Universal Soul exists in every individual, it expresses itself in every creature, everything in the world is a projection of it, and that there is Oneness, a unity of souls in one and only Self&quot;.

The Shvetashvatara Upanishad is notable for its discussion of the concept of personal god – Ishvara, and suggesting it to be a path to one&#x27;s own Highest Self. The text is also notable for its multiple mentions of both Rudra and Shiva, along with other Vedic deities, and of crystallization of Shiva as a central theme.

==== Maitrayaniya Upanishad====
The Maitrayaniya Upanishad, also known as the Maitri Upanishad, is found in the black Yajurveda. It consists of seven &quot;Prapathakas&quot; (lessons). The first &quot;Prapathaka&quot; is introductory, the next three are structured in a question-answer style and discuss metaphysical questions relating to Atman (Self, Soul), while the fifth to seventh &quot;Prapathaka&quot; are supplements. However, several manuscripts discovered in different parts of India contain lesser number of &quot;Prapathakas&quot;, with a Telugu-language version showing just four.

The common kernel of the Maitri Upanishad across different recensions, states Max Muller, is a reverence for soul, that can be summarized in a few words as, &quot;(Man) is the Self – the immortal, the fearless, the Brahman&quot;. The Maitrayaniya Upanishad is notable for its references to theories also found in Buddhism, elements of the Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hinduism, as well as the Ashrama system.

===Srautasutras===
The Yajurveda had Shrautasutras and Grhyasutras attached to it, from fifteen schools: Apastamba, Agastya, Agniveshyaka, Baudhayana, Bharadvaja, Hiranyakeshi, Kaundinya, Kusidaka, Katyayana, Lokaksita, Madhyamdina, Panca-Kathaka, Satyasadha, Sakala, Sandilya, Vaikhanasa, and Vadula. Of these nine have survived, along with portions of Kaundinya.

==Manuscripts and translations==
Most surviving manuscripts and recensions of Yajurveda&#x27;s Samhitas, Aranyakas and Brahmanas remain untranslated into Western languages. The two reliable translations are from British India colonial era, and have been widely studied. These are AB Keith&#x27;s translation of Taittiriya Samhita of the Black Yajurveda, and Juliu Eggeling&#x27;s translation of Satapatha Brahmana of the White Yajurveda.

Ralph Griffith published an early translation of White Yajurveda Samhita. However, Frits Staal has questioned his translations and considers them &quot;fantasies and best discarded&quot;.

Devi Chand published a re-interpreted translation of Yajurveda in 1965, reprinted as 3rd edition in 1980, wherein the translation incorporated Dayananda Saraswati&#x27;s monotheistic interpretations of the Vedic text, and the translation liberally adds &quot;O Lord&quot; and &quot;the Creator&quot; to various verses, unlike other translators.

===Ezourvedam forgery===

In 18th century, French Jesuits published Ezourvedam, claiming it to be a translation of a recension of the Yajurveda. The Ezourveda was studied by Voltaire, and later declared a forgery, representing Jesuit ideas to Indians as a Vedic school.

==Significance==
The text is a useful source of information about the agriculture, economic and social life during the Vedic era. The verses, for example, list the types of crops considered important in ancient India,

<doc id="975403" wikidata="Q4532597" url="?curid=975403" title="Eroica (1958 film)">
<text>Eroica (released in some territories as Heroism) is a 1958 Polish film by Andrzej Munk, and his second feature film after &quot;Man on the Tracks&quot; (1956). &quot;Eroica&quot; is composed of two separate stories, presenting satirical critiques of two aspects of the Polish character: acquisitive opportunism, and a romantic fascination for heroic martyrs.

The film’s title is an ironic reference to Ludwig van Beethoven’s Third Symphony, which the composer initially dedicated to then French head Consulate Napoleon Bonaparte. When Napoleon declared himself Emperor, Beethoven, a devout republican, withdrew the dedication in disgust and titled the work simply “Eroica.”

&quot;Eroica&quot; premiered on Polish Television in 1972 and depicts wartime couriers crossing the Tatra Mountains.

Eroica won the FIPRESCI Award at the 1959 Mar del Plata Film Festival.

== Synopsis ==

===&quot;Scherzo Alla Pollacca&quot;===
The first part is a bitter, tragicomic story of Dzidziuś (&quot;Babyface&quot;), a street-wise bon-vivant, drunkard, and coward who unwillingly joins the Home Army during the Warsaw Uprising. Dzidziuś&#x27; wife, Zosia, is having an affair with a Hungarian officer and Dzidziuś reluctantly becomes the messenger between the Home Army and the Hungarian unit, which is considering changing sides.

===&quot;Ostinato Lugubre&quot;===
The second part is set in a POW camp for Polish soldiers. Lt. Zawistowski, one of the internees, decides to attempt to escape. While none of his fellow inmates are sure whether he succeeded, his absence upsets the guards and provides hope and inspiration for the prisoners. Soon his legend grows, making him a hero within the camp and helping to boost the prisoners&#x27; morale. However, it turns out that Lt. Zawistowski didn&#x27;t actually follow through on his escape plans, but is hiding in the attic of one of the barracks. It turns out that he was hiding from his colleagues, whose ostentatious patriotism he simply could not stand.

<doc id="975409" wikidata="Q3024775" url="?curid=975409" title="Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad">
<text>The Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad operated from 1905 to 1983 between its namesake cities of Detroit, Michigan, and Ironton, Ohio, via Toledo. At the end of 1970, it operated 478 miles of road on 762 miles of track; that year it carried 1,244 million ton-miles of revenue freight.

==Early history==
In 1901, the merger of the Detroit and Lima Northern Railway and the Ohio Southern Railway formed the Detroit Southern Railroad. This company was purchased at foreclosure on May 1, 1905, by Harry B. Hollins &amp; Company of New York, which reincorporated it in the state of Michigan under the name of the Detroit, Toledo &amp; Ironton Railway.

The president of the Detroit Southern, Samuel Hunt, was to remain as president of the reorganized road but died suddenly on May 15, 1905. George Miller Cumming, a New York City lawyer who was formerly first vice-president of the Erie Railroad and the former chairman of the board of the Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton Railway, was elected president in June and served for one month. F. A. Durban was elected president in July but resigned in November, and was replaced by Eugene Zimmerman. Cumming and Durban continued to serve as officers under Zimmerman&#x27;s presidency.

The name was changed to Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad on March 1, 1914.

Though the company went bankrupt in 1908, it remained solvent until it was purchased by Henry Ford in 1920. Ford recognized the strategic importance of the line to his automobile business; the line connected Dearborn, Michigan, to all of the major east–west rail lines in the Midwest. This gave Ford direct control over shipments of raw materials and finished goods to and from his factories in Dearborn.

Under Ford&#x27;s management, the line thrived. In the words of a later historian, &quot;the line was transformed from a streak of rust into an extremely efficient and profitable operation, the likes of which has or will seldom be seen in this country.&quot; Ford double-tracked the Detroit area main lines, and made a deal with the workers that they would take better care of the equipment in exchange for unusually high wages. Moreover, Ford funded the purchase of new equipment. For the daily Detroit-Bainbridge, Ohio train, the DT&amp;I purchased a pair of &quot;doodlebugs&quot;; for the intensive Detroit-area freight service, the line electrified as far as Flat Rock yard. Ford hoped to electrify the entire line, and thence to an interchange with the Virginian, but electrified at 22 kV 25 Hz AC, the wrong voltage for interoperable equipment (the Virginian electrified at 11 kV AC). The concrete catenary masts of the electric years survived for decades after de-electrification, as it was deemed too expensive to demolish them; some remain today.

In 1929, Ford sold the line to a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad after becoming disgusted with what he considered interference and over-regulation from the Interstate Commerce Commission. In 1930, the railroad de-electrified in favor of standard equipment.

==Ann Arbor Railroad==
In June 1905, the Detroit, Toledo &amp; Ironton Railway took control of the Ann Arbor Railroad (AA), which they purchased from Rudolph Kleybolte &amp; Co. The acquisition connected Toledo with Frankfort, Michigan, and essentially doubled the DT&amp;I system. But the 1908 bankruptcy forced the DT&amp;I to divest its acquisition.

In 1963, the DT&amp;I, by then a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad, once again gained control of the AA. The Ann Arbor lines became part of Conrail in April 1976, and were facing abandonment. In October 1977, they were purchased by the state of Michigan, which intended to preserve rail service over its tracks. In 1977 Michigan Interstate was designated operator of the entire line from Toledo to Frankfurt. A series of disputes arose during the early 1980s and multiple railroads were designated by the tracks owners, the State of Michigan, to operate the line. The line from Toledo to just south of Osmer (a passing siding north of Ann Arbor) was sold to the trustee for the estate purchased the remaining portion of the Michigan Interstate from Toledo, Ohio to Ann Arbor, Michigan in September 1985. The line north of Osmer remains under the ownership of the State of Michigan, except where the tracks have been removed. For a period in the 1980s three different companies operated the Ann Arbor tracks. Michigan Interstate operated from Toledo to Osmer. Tuscola and Saginaw Bay from Osmer north to Alma, and the Michigan Northern operated north of Alma. The collapse of the Michigan Northern resulted in the Tuscola and Saginaw Bay taking all operations north of Osmer. The Tuscola and Saginaw Bay later re-branded itself as the Great Lakes Central, the current operator of all remaining lines north of Osmer. The Michigan Interstate trackage was sold in 1988 to the Ann Arbor Acquisition Corporation, who later sold the line to WATCO, the current operator the segment from Toledo to Osmer. 
==The Pennsylvania years==
The line operated as an independent subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad from 1929 until 1970. In 1955, the line replaced its steam locomotives with diesel locomotives. The DT&amp;I relied exclusively on diesel locomotives built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division.

==The later years==

In 1968, the DT&amp;I&#x27;s parent company, the Pennsylvania Railroad, merged with its longtime rival, the New York Central Railroad, to become the Penn Central, which declared bankruptcy two years later and sold off the DT&amp;I to private investors. In 1980, the DT&amp;I was acquired by the Grand Trunk Western Railroad (GTW). Under the GTW, the DT&amp;I locomotives were painted in the red and blue livery of the GTW, but retained the DT&amp;I logo. In December 1983, the DT&amp;I was completely assimilated into the GTW.

==End of service on southern portion==

In April 1982, a collapse in Royersville Tunnel (the only tunnel on the old DT&amp;I) prompted GTW to shut down the line between Jackson and Ironton. The tunnel had suffered collapses many times in the past but limited remaining business south of Jackson and the operational problems of the tunnel led to GTW&#x27;s decision. At the same time, GTW bypassed the steep and treacherous Summithill section between Bainbridge and Waverly by rerouting trains onto Chessie System trackage from Washington Court House, Ohio to Waverly, then back onto the former DT&amp;I to Jackson. In 1984 all operations south of Washington Court House were suspended, the Jackson Shops closed, and the track dismantled.

A short section of the DT&amp;I main west out of Jackson is still in place serving as a connection from industries to the only remaining line into Jackson. A short section of the DT&amp;I north from the junction with the B&amp;O Southwestern near Greenfield is still in place to serve local industry. Portions of the line between Greenfield and Washington Court House were purchased by Washington Court House with the intention of creating a rail-trail, but they were unable to acquire enough conjoined sections to build a trail.

==Central and northern portions==

GTW continued to operate the northern and central portions of the former DT&amp;I as part of their network for many years. The DT&amp;I trackage from Springfield to Lurray (near Washington Court House) was sold by GTW to the West Central Ohio Port Authority (formerly Clark County - Fayette County Port Authority) January 18, 1991. This section was then operated in conjunction with the former section of the B&amp;O Toledo Division from Lurray to Washington Court House by the Indiana and Ohio Railway, a division of Railtex. In 1997, GTW sold the former DT&amp;I from Dundee (Diann) Michigan to Springfield, Ohio to the Indiana and Ohio Railway. Included in the sale was trackage rights from Dundee to Flat Rock, MI over the old DT&amp;I. Railtex was merged into RailAmerica, which was then purchased by Genesee &amp; Wyoming. G&amp;W operates the former DT&amp;I from Dundee (Diann) Michigan to Washington Court House, still as part of their Indiana and Ohio Railway.

<text>The Renault Twingo is a city car made by the French company Renault since 1992 across three generations. The name is a portmanteau of &quot;twist&quot;, &quot;swing&quot;, and &quot;tango&quot;.

The first-generation Twingo (two door, front engine) debuted at the Paris Motor Show on 5 October 1992, receiving its formal market launch in continental European markets beginning in April 1993. Renault launched the second-generation Twingo (two door, front engine) in the summer of 2007 – and the third-generation Twingo (four door, rear engine) debuted at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show, receiving its formal market launch in September 2014. Production of the Twingo ended in the summer of 2024, to be replaced by the upcoming, all-electric Renault Twingo E-Tech.


==First generation (1993)==
The original Twingo was launched in April 1993, was sold in European LHD markets until August 2007, and received intermediate restylings in 1998, 2000, and 2004. It was notably similar to the original Honda Today in design, including the overall shape and the headlamps partially set into the front bumper.

===Development===
Designed under the direction of Patrick Le Quément, Renault&#x27;s chief designer, the car derived a concept developed through the W60 project when Gaston Juchet was Renault&#x27;s chief designer. The project was aimed at replacing the Renault 4 with a minivan model.

Le Quément chose a Jean-Pierre Ploué design to develop the production version. Le Quément stretched the original prototype and added an unconventional front-end layout resembling a &quot;smile&quot;. The interior equipment was mounted on a central console to free space. Renault had participated in the 1981 to 1984 &#x27;Mono-Box&#x27; ECO 2000 car project, along with PSA Peugeot Citroën and the French Government.

The Twingo I&#x27;s electronic, centrally mounted instrument panel had a speedometer, fuel gauge, clock, odometer, and trip recorder controlled via a stalk-located button. A strip of warning lights was located behind the steering wheel. The rear seat featured a sliding mechanism to enable either increased boot space or more rear-seat legroom. The boot parcel shelf was attached to the inside of the tailgate, and lifted with the tailgate – or could clip back against the rear window when not required.

===Engines===
All engines were replaced with an eight-valve 1.15-litre unit. A 16-valve, version was added in 2000.

Manufactured at the Flins Renault Factory from the time of its launch until 28 June 2007, the Twingo I was also manufactured in Taiwan, Spain, Colombia, and Uruguay from 1999 to 2002, remaining in production until 8 June 2012 in Colombia, by the Sofasa conglomerate, strictly for the domestic market.

===Timeline===
In April 1993, the Twingo launched with only one trim level, and four exterior colours: coral red, Indian yellow, coriander green, and ultramarine blue. The car retailed at a price of 55,000FF (approximately €8,400). In June 1994, new exterior colours were introduced along with minor interior changes, as well as optional electric windows and mirrors, and locks with remote keyless entry. Four months later, the Twingo Easy model was launched, with an automated clutch on the manual gearbox.

In September 1995, the first of many special Twingo editions launched, while inbuilt airbags become optional. In July 1996, a new 1149 cc engine (from the Clio) was fitted to replace the previous engine from the Renault 5. Alongside the new engine came the Twingo Matic model, equipped with a three-speed automatic gearbox. Also, various improvements were made, including the addition of a third brake light.

Two years later, the Twingo underwent its first major restyling of the interior and dashboard. The front and rear lights were revised, and front orange indicator lights were merged into the headlamp housings. The front of the car is reinforced for added safety in a frontal impact. Two months later, the top-of-the-range Twingo Initiale model launched.

In September 2000, the Twingo underwent its second major restyling. Additions included larger, 14-inch wheels, revised door trims with larger door pockets, a black trunk opener lever (instead of shiny metal), and cup holders in front of the gearstick.

December 2000, a new 1.2-litre single overhead camshaft, 16-valve version of the D-series engine launched, with . In April 2001, a new automated manual gearbox launched, called Quickshift. Additional revisions followed in September 2002, including new interior trims and wheel covers.

In Japan, Renault was formerly licensed by Yanase Co., Ltd., but in 1999, Renault purchased a stake in Japanese automaker Nissan after Nissan had faced financial troubles following the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in 1991 and subsequent lost decade. As a result of Renault&#x27;s purchase of interest, Yanase cancelled its licensing contract with Renault in the spring of 2000, and Nissan Motor Co., Ltd took over as the sole licensee, hence sales of the Twingo I in Japan were transferred from Yanase Store locations to Nissan Red Stage Store locations. Despite Japan being a right-hand drive market, the first generation was sold exclusively as left-hand drive, with the only change being the headlights.

September 2004 marked the third major Twingo revision. The Renault logo was fitted to the boot lid, side rubbing strips were added, and a new range of exterior colours launched. On 28 June 2007, Twingo I production ended in France, being replaced by the Twingo II. By 30 June 2007, 2,478,648 units from the Twingo I were produced. The Renault Twingo I production went on into Colombia until 8 June 2012. In total, 2.6 million units of the first-generation Twingo were produced.

=== Special models ===

==== Limited edition ====
The first generation Twingo knew an important number of limited editions, including co-brandings with premium brands such as Perrier, Benetton, L&#x27;Oréal, Kenzo, Elite Model Management, and artistic references including Metropolis, Grease and Tintin.

==== Twingo Lecoq ====
The Renault Twingo &quot;Lecoq&quot; was a special edition produced in less than 50 units. It was an independent initiative of &quot;Carrosserie Lecoq&quot;.

==== Electric ====
A French company, &quot;Lormauto,&quot; presented at the 2022 Paris Motor Show a kit to transform the Renault Twingo 1 into a fully electric car.

==Second generation (2007)==


After presenting an initial concept at the 2006 Mondial de l&#x27;Automobile, Renault debuted the production Twingo II at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show with French market trim levels named &quot;Authentique, Expression, Initiale, Dynamique&quot;, and &quot;GT&quot;. Using the floorpan of the Renault Clio II, the Twingo II offered improved crash protection and was available in both RHD and LHD configurations. Production began in France and subsequently moved to the Revoz plant in Novo Mesto, Slovenia.

In January 2008, Renault debuted the Twingo Renaultsport 133, with a new 1,598 cc engine, at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show. In August 2013, ordering and production of the 133 model ended.

In July 2011, Renault debuted a facelifted Twingo II at the Frankfurt Motor Show, featuring a design language subsequently used on their entire range and offering revised fascias, as well as redesigned front and rear light clusters.

On series 14, episode four of &quot;Top Gear&quot;, presenter Jeremy Clarkson road tested the Twingo 133 on Belfast streets and barrel rolled upside down through a sewage tunnel. After numerous accidents, he raced to catch a departing ferry, instead landing in the ocean.

On 16 March 2011, the Renault Twingo won the &quot;best city car award&quot; in the Parkers&#x27; New Car Awards.

Special editions in the UK included the Twingo Renaultsport Gordini, Twingo Gordini TCe 100, Twingo Bizu, Twingo Pzaz, Twingo Renaultsport Silverstone GP, Twingo Miss Sixty, and Twingo Renaultsport Red Bull RB7.

In Japan, the Twingo II was licensed by Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. and sold exclusively through Nissan Store locations.

==Third generation (2014)==


The third generation Renault Twingo debuted in March 2014 at the Geneva Motor Show in a five-door, rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. It was co-developed with Daimler&#x27;s third generation Smart Fortwo and second generation Smart Forfour. The third generation Twingo and second generation Forfour are manufactured at the same factory in Novo Mesto, Slovenia. Production ended in June 2024.

The third-generation Twingo entered into production in May 2014 at Novo Mesto and was launched into the European market in September.

===Design and development===
In March 2010, Renault and Daimler, as part of their existing partnership, announced &quot;Project Edison&quot;, a collaboration aimed at conceiving a shared platform for small city cars to be used by both companies. The Edison platform was designed from the start for mounting either an internal combustion engine or an electric motor as the main power source.

The first cars using the platform were the third-generation Twingo and the second-generation Smart Forfour. Renault and Daimler AG invested equally during the research and development phase, with Renault subsequently specializing in the engines and Daimler in transmissions.

Both companies tried to ensure a distinctive design. Renault designers took inspiration from the Renault 5 and the first generation Twingo. This can be seen by the &quot;smile&quot; at the front which was a design feature of the Twingo I. The engine was moved to the rear to allow them to expand the passenger cabin forwards, and allowed the car to have a 45° steering angle which means it was capable of making tight turns in a city environment. The car was originally launched with four colour options, as with the original Twingo.

In January 2019, an updated Twingo was introduced with a new front fascia, cosmetic changes inside and out, and a new base 1.0 L engine; at the same time, declining sales in the UK (just 877 were sold in 2018) led Renault UK to discontinue marketing the right-hand drive model.

===Technical details===

The Twingo III was about 10 mm shorter than the Twingo II. The rear-engine layout improved the manoeuvrability and the cabin space, but reduced the boot capacity. The suspension was composed of MacPherson struts on the front axle and a De Dion tube on the rear. The car used a five-door architecture, which differed from its three-door predecessors.

Brakes were ventilated disks on the front and drums on the rear, except in the base model (SCe 70), which used drum brakes all round. The bonnet featured a special opening mechanism and allowed only partial opening to give access to the windscreen washer fluid, brake fluid and coolant reservoirs, and to the battery.

====Equipment====
The car originally offered four trim levels: Expression, Play, Dynamique, and Dynamique S, with various customization packs. One option connects a smartphone with an instrument panel cradle (R&amp;Go) and has an infotainment system (R-Link). Other levels such as the &quot;Energy&quot; trim have since been added. The GT model arrived in November 2016.

====Safety====
As standard, the car incorporates tyre pressure sensors, seatbelt reminders, four airbags, and four head and chest side airbags. It achieved a four star Euro NCAP test rating in 2014.

====Engines====
The car originally came with a three-cylinder petrol engine, either a 0.9-litre turbocharged unit or a 1-litre atmospheric. Both are fitted low and in a 49° angle to increase boot&#x27;s capacity. In November 2016 a more powerful version of the petrol engine, the TCe 110, arrived for the sporting Twingo GT model.
===Advertising===
In February 2014, Renault organised a &quot;strip tweet&quot; online event to promote the Twingo III. The manufacturer commissioned to Publicis the conception of the car&#x27;s European advertising. Publicis hired French artists duo Kuntzel+Deygas for the design of the visual campaign with the theme &quot;Go Anywhere, Go Everywhere.&quot;

In 2015, Renault released a short music video, &quot;All new Twingo : Show me a car !&quot;, in which a &quot;twee&quot; styled woman is searching a &quot;nifty&quot; car. It ends with a reference to &quot;Papa &amp; Nicole&quot; adverts for the Renault Clio : &quot;Papa! – Nicole? – Your seatbelt!&quot;. The brief video got a viral success in the United Kingdom, with approximately views in four weeks. A Pop Up Store was opened at the Crémerie de Paris.

Bēhance produced Life Designed software as part of Twingo launch.

===Reception and awards===
In the United Kingdom, the new Twingo won the &quot;City Car of the Year&quot; 2014, &quot;TopGear&quot; Magazine Awards, &quot;City Car of the Year&quot; in the &quot;UK Car of the Year Awards&quot; and &quot;Best City Car&quot; in the &quot;Daily Expres&quot;s 2014 Motoring Oscars, &quot;Best City Car&quot; at the 2015 British &quot;GQ&quot; Car Awards.

Paul Horrell of &quot;Top Gear&quot; gave the car a score of seven out of 10, calling it: &quot;a genuinely different approach to design and engineering that has brought real dividends, not just in being different for its own sake. Most important, it&#x27;s much more fun than a base model supermini for the same cash.&quot; &quot;Auto Express&quot; and its sister publication &quot;CarBuyer&quot; scored it four out of five stars, praising its manoeuvrability, design, and rear passenger space but criticizing its wind noise and high price compared to its rivals. &quot;What Car?&quot; gave the car three out of five stars, saying: &quot;The Renault Twingo mixes cheeky retro styling with genuine practicality. It’s neither as refined nor as comfortable as the best city cars, though.&quot;

===Concept cars===
The third-generation Twingo was previewed through two concepts, the Twin&#x27;Z and the Twin&#x27;Run.

====Twin&#x27;Z====
The Twin&#x27;Z is a city car concept unveiled in April 2013. Its styling was created in partnership with British designer Ross Lovegrove. According to Renault&#x27;s chief designer Laurens van den Acker, the purpose of its introduction was to &quot;break down the boundaries between the world of an object whose calling is to be in movement, the automobile, and that of furniture.&quot; The concept has a rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and is powered by an electric motor with a power output and torque of . It has no B-pillar or dashboard and its doors open in conventional doors up front and suicide doors in the rear.

====Twin&#x27;Run====

The Twin&#x27;Run is a rear wheel drive hot hatch concept developed by Renault with assistance of Tork Engineering and Poclain Véhicules, unveiled in May 2013. It is powered by a mid-mounted V6 engine with , coupled to a twin clutch six speed sequential gearbox and limited slip differential. It has double-wishbone independent suspension on both axles. The chassis is a tubular steel frame inspired by the Mégane Trophy and Renault 5 Turbo Maxi from WRC.
===Twingo E-Tech Électrique===

After plans to roll out new electric vehicles, including an electric Twingo, were confirmed in September 2019, Renault announced the Twingo Electric, marketed as the Twingo Z.E. (Zero Emissions) and in France as the Twingo E-Tech Électrique, the first-ever electric version of its city car, in February 2020 at the Geneva Motor Show. It is the second electric car from Renault, following the Zoe. The Twingo Z.E. drive train is based on that of the Smart EQ Forfour, with a larger battery. Renault CEO Luca de Meo confirmed in 2021 the entire Twingo range would be discontinued after the third generation, driven in part by the forthcoming Euro 7 emissions standards which will be implemented in 2025. It is expected the A-segment Twingo will be replaced by the larger B-segment Renault 5 EV.

The starting price, announced the following September, was . It was not marketed in the United Kingdom, following Renault&#x27;s withdrawal of the Twingo range from the UK market after the car model&#x27;s facelift in 2019. A limited edition &quot;Vibes&quot; model, based on the regular &quot;Intens&quot; trim, was announced in July 2020; the special Valencia Orange colour was only available for the Vibes limited edition, but the Vibes could also be specified for any regular production colour, and was later made available for the conventional petrol-engines Twingo. Trim levels in 2022 included the Life (), Zen (), Intens (), and Urban Night (). Although the suggested retail price was high compared to a petrol-powered Twingo, the French government electric car subsidy of up to or 27% of the price made the cost of the electric version comparable.

The car has a rated driving range of on the WLTP driving cycle (Full or City, respectively). The on-board charger, branded Caméléon, can accept AC electric supply at up to 22 kW; the lithium-ion battery, with 22 kW-hr capacity, incorporates lessons learned from the Renault Zoe. The battery itself weighs and is positioned beneath the front seats. The vehicle is limited to AC charging sources only, as the vehicle supply interface port does not accept a DC fast charge plug. The rear-mounted R80 traction motor has an output of and , and the car has a kerb weight of . The top speed is , and can accelerate from 0– in 12.6 seconds. The default driving mode &quot;D&quot; emulates the behaviour of a petrol-powered car with moderate &quot;engine braking&quot; when the driver&#x27;s foot is lifted from the throttle; a more aggressive and adjustable &quot;B&quot; regeneration mode is selectable, but does not allow one-pedal driving at the highest regeneration level.

The base trim (&quot;Life&quot;) was criticized for lacking expected basic features like a radio and air conditioning; however, the lack of vibrations and abundant low-end torque from the electric traction motor were appreciated for city traffic. The Twingo Electric was marketed against other low-cost city cars, such as the base model of the Fiat New 500, as well as Volkswagen E-up! and the VW&#x27;s rebadged versions, the SEAT Mii electric and Škoda Citigo-e iV; internally, the Twingo also competed with the Dacia Spring; compared to the VW and Dacia, the Twingo Electric offered a smaller driving range.

==Twingo Concept (2023)==
In November 2023, it was confirmed that the Twingo would be returning as an electric model with a price tag under €20,000. A prototype for the new Twingo was shown at the Capital Markets Day press conference, featuring retro styling heavily reminiscent of the first generation Twingo, continuing Renaults trend of retro styling for its future electric models, such as the Renault 4Ever Trophy and the Renault 5 EV. Efficiency figures of 10kWh/100 km were also announced.

Renault Groupe CEO, Luca De Meo, stated at the conference that development was to begin immediately and the car could be expected to reach production within two years, matching the development speed of Chinese OEM vehicles, meaning a release date of around 2026 is likely.

<doc id="975415" wikidata="Q2296145" url="?curid=975415" title="Noise from the Basement">
<text>Noise from the Basement is the debut album by Canadian singer-songwriter Skye Sweetnam, released on September 21, 2004, by Capitol Records. It debuted and peaked at number 124 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 15 on the Oricon Album Charts. The album sold 71,000 copies in United States as June 2007.

== Development and recording ==
Originally planned for a late 2003 release, the release of Sweetnam&#x27;s debut album was postponed several times by the record label, being pushed back to April, then May and finally August of the following year before its official release in September of that year.

== Music and lyrics ==
&quot;Noise From The Basement&quot; was subject to many comparisons among critics with Avril Lavigne due to their similarities – same nationality and resembling attitude although Skye has described herself as being more &quot;girly-girl&quot; than her and mentioned that after hearing both albums, she could not find any real similarities between their sound.

==Promotion==
Three songs from &quot;Noise from the Basement&quot; were released as singles. &quot;Billy S.&quot; was released as the lead single, followed by &quot;Tangled Up In Me&quot; and &quot;Number One&quot;. &quot;Superstar&quot; was released as a standalone track on iTunes.

Prior to the release of her debut album, Sweetnam toured in summer camps in the American Camplified Tour, from July to August 2003. In September, she performed in some venues in Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. She was also the opening act for Britney Spears&#x27; Onyx Hotel Tour and performed in the United States, Canada and Europe in the Spring of 2004. About that experience, she said:

&quot;I love catching people off guard. That&#x27;s why opening for Britney was so great. I was playing for people who had no idea who I was and had never heard my music. And by the end of the set, a lot of them found themselves really getting into it.&quot;

Skye was supposed to continue opening for Britney in the Summer, when the tour was going to return for a second round of concerts, but the Onyx Hotel Tour was eventually cancelled due to Spears injuring her knee. Following cancellation, Sweetnam regretted that it could no longer be used to promote &quot;Noise from the Basement&quot;, stating:

&quot;It was kind of disappointing (when Britney hurt her knee) because we had this whole media hype behind the tour. It would have worked really well for a lead up for my album.&quot; 

On August 5, 2004, she performed in the Fourth Annual Pantene Pro-Voice Concert, in New York City. Starting that month, she was a featured artist on AOL breakers for two months, and was also featured in a series of magazines, namely &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Blender&quot;, &quot;Teen People&quot; and &quot;Teen Vogue&quot;. Further promotion was backed up by a live performance of &quot;Tangled Up In Me&quot; in &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, one day before album&#x27;s final release, and Sessions@AOL live performances a week earlier that same month.

In November 2004, Sweetnam went on tour with Ryan Cabrera and praised the positive reception from the audience in both Cabrera and Spears tours, mentioning she was fortunate to open for artists with different musical styles. Earlier that year, the track &quot;Imaginary Superstar&quot; was featured in &quot;Sleepover&quot; soundtrack and a shorter version of &quot;Number One&quot; was used in Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association television commercials. This version had different lyrics from the album version, being recorded exclusively for the campaign.

<text>Robert Walter Kasten Jr. (born June 19, 1942) is an American Republican politician from the state of Wisconsin who served as a U.S. Representative from 1975 to 1979 and as a United States Senator from 1981 to 1993.

==Background==
Kasten was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He attended the Milwaukee Country Day School before graduating in 1960 from The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, in 1964 from the University of Arizona in Tucson, and received his M.B.A. from the Columbia Business School in 1966. He served in the Wisconsin Air National Guard from 1966 to 1972.

==Elected office==

Kasten was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate in 1972. In 1974, he was elected to the House of Representatives after defeating incumbent Glenn R. Davis in a Republican primary election. He was reelected in 1976. He ran for Governor of Wisconsin in 1978, but lost the Republican nomination to Lee S. Dreyfus, who went on to win the general election.

Kasten ran for the United States Senate in 1980 and narrowly defeated Democrat and incumbent Senator Gaylord Nelson. The victory was propelled in part by the popularity of Ronald Reagan at the top of the Republican ticket. In the Senate, Kasten was an outspoken conservative. He was the first Republican to represent Wisconsin in the U.S. Senate since Alexander Wiley left office in 1963.

In 1985, Kasten was arrested and charged with driving under the influence after a District of Columbia police officer observed him running a red light and driving on the wrong side of the road. The DUI charges were later dropped.

In 1986, Kasten narrowly defeated Democrat Ed Garvey to win a second term after a very bitter campaign, one that was characterized by personal attacks and is remembered as one of the nastiest elections in Wisconsin history. Kasten was defeated by Democratic state Senator Russ Feingold in 1992.

Kasten voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto). Kasten voted in favor of the nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court.

==After the Senate==
Since 1993, he has been President of Kasten &amp; Company, a consulting firm. In July 2007, Kasten joined the presidential campaign of Republican Rudy Giuliani as a foreign policy adviser. He chaired Giuliani&#x27;s Wisconsin campaign, along with former U.S. Representative Scott Klug and former State Senator Cathy Stepp.

After Giuliani dropped out, Kasten endorsed his close friend and former Senate colleague John McCain. In April 2016, Kasten endorsed Republican frontrunner Donald Trump for president in 2016, becoming part of Trump&#x27;s foreign policy advisory team.

==Electoral history==





==Cultural references==
Writer Mike Baron named a recurring character in his Wisconsin-based comic book &quot;Badger&quot; after Kasten, then Wisconsin&#x27;s junior senator. The character, a peg-legged, vampire-hunting pig named &quot;Senator Bob Kasten&quot;, made several appearances in the series. A student political party on the University of Wisconsin Madison campus satirically named themselves the &quot;Bob Kasten School of Driving&quot; (a reference to his DUI arrest); it won the campus-wide elections in 1986 and 1987.

<doc id="975436" wikidata="Q2865256" url="?curid=975436" title="Arthur Morgan (Australian politician, born 1856)">
<text>Sir Arthur Morgan (1856–1916) was an Australian politician who was Premier of Queensland from 1903 to 1906.

==Early life==
Morgan was born in Warwick, Colony of New South Wales, the fourth son of James Morgan, who later represented Warwick in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland and became the chairman of committees, and his wife Kate (&quot;née&quot; Barton). Morgan was educated at a public school at Warwick and then joined the staff of the Warwick &quot;Argus&quot;, which was owned and edited by his father. Morgan married Alice Augusta Clinton, daughter of H. E. Clinton, on 26 July 1880.

==Career==
Morgan became a member of the Warwick Municipal Council in 1885 and served as mayor since 1886–1890 and again in 1898. In 1887 he was elected a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for the district of Warwick, and held this seat until 1896. In 1899, he was re-elected to this seat, and in that same year was chosen as the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland.

In 1903, businessman and politician Robert Philp resigned as Premier of Queensland on account of defections from his party, and the leader of the Labor party being unable to form a ministry. Morgan was asked to lead a combination of a group of liberals and the labour party. He later resigned the speakership, and went on to form a ministry. After that, he held the positions of the premier, chief secretary, secretary for railways, and vice-president of the executive council. Morgan&#x27;s policy of retrenchment made him unpopular, and his alliance with the labour party was seen as questionable by his former associates. In January 1906, after the death of Sir Hugh Nelson, Morgan was appointed as president of the Queensland Legislative Council and was acting-governor on two occasions. In 1908 he was appointed to the seat of Lieutenant-Governor of Queensland.

He published a manuscript in 1902 entitled &quot;Discovery and Development of the Downs&quot;, and was knighted in 1907.

==Later life==

In his later years, Morgan&#x27;s health began to fail, and he died on 20 December 1916. Morgan was survived by his wife, five sons and three daughters.

<doc id="975439" wikidata="Q128443" url="?curid=975439" title="The Smithereens">
<text>The Smithereens are an American rock band from Carteret, New Jersey. The group formed in 1980 with members Pat DiNizio (vocals and guitar), Jim Babjak (guitar and vocals), Mike Mesaros (bass guitar and vocals), and Dennis Diken (drums and percussion). This original lineup continued until 2006, when Mesaros left the band and Severo Jornacion took over on bass guitar until Mesaros&#x27; return in 2016. After DiNizio died in 2017, the band continued performing live shows as a trio (Babjak, Mesaros and Diken) with various guest vocalists.

The band had a string of hits in the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, including &quot;Only a Memory&quot;, &quot;A Girl Like You&quot; and &quot;Too Much Passion&quot;. The Smithereens have collaborated with numerous musicians, both in the studio (Belinda Carlisle, Julian Lennon, Lou Reed, Suzanne Vega) and live (Otis Blackwell, Graham Parker and The Kinks). The band named themselves after a favorite word of cartoon character Yosemite Sam.

==History==

Babjak, Diken, and Mesaros are all from Carteret, New Jersey, and graduated from Carteret High School in 1975. In 1980, they formed the band with DiNizio, who was from Scotch Plains, New Jersey. DiNizio had placed a classified ad in &quot;The Aquarian Weekly&quot; looking for a drummer to help on a demo tape – Diken answered it and later introduced his schoolmates Babjak and Mesaros as well.

The band&#x27;s name derives from the cartoon character Yosemite Sam who often used the expression &quot;I&#x27;m-a-gonna blow ya to smithereens!&quot; In 1980 they released the single &quot;Girls About Town&quot; followed by a mini-LP &quot;Beauty and Sadness&quot; in 1983. In the same period they toured as Otis Blackwell&#x27;s backing band on a Scandinavian tour in 1984.

After playing mostly around the New York area, the band signed with Enigma. The single &quot;Blood and Roses&quot; from their first album was included on the soundtrack for &quot;Dangerously Close&quot;, and the music video got moderate rotation on MTV. &quot;Blood and Roses&quot; was also featured on the 1980s TV show &quot;Miami Vice&quot; during the episode &#x27;The Savage&#x27; (first aired February 6, 1987).
The Smithereens are known for writing and playing catchy 1960s-influenced power pop. Along with a basic East coast roots-rock sound that owed much to musicians who inspired DiNizio, including the Who, the Clash, Elvis Costello and Nick Lowe, The Smithereens deployed a uniquely retro obsession with Mod, the late British Invasion pop of John&#x27;s Children and the Move and other artifacts of 1950s and 1960s culture that lent its music substance. DiNizio said his single biggest influence was Buddy Holly: &quot;Listening to Buddy Holly, I rediscovered my enjoyment of simple pop structures and pretty melodies...I&#x27;ve always thought of him as a kindred spirit.&quot; Likewise, The Who and The Kinks were major influences on Babjak and Diken.

The title and lyrics of their song, “In a Lonely Place,&quot; appear to be based on the 1950 Humphrey Bogart film of the same title because of Bogart&#x27;s lines: &quot;I was born the day I met you, lived a while when you loved me, died a little when we broke apart.&quot; The title and artwork for the album &quot;11&quot; were a nod to the original 1960 &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; film.

The Smithereens starred as themselves and were featured as entertainment in the indoor beach party scene of the 1986 Troma film &quot;Class of Nuke &#x27;Em High&quot;, playing the song &quot;Much Too Much&quot;. The soundtrack to the film was not released until 2014.

The highest position a Smithereens album attained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop charts was in 1990, when &quot;11&quot; peaked at No. 41 on the strength of the single &quot;A Girl Like You&quot; (which hit No. 38). &quot;A Girl Like You&quot; was originally written to be the title track for the 1989 Cameron Crowe film &quot;Say Anything...&quot;. The album also featured a duet between DiNizio and Belinda Carlisle on &quot;Blue Period&quot;.
The basic tracks for their most recent studio album of original material, titled &quot;2011&quot;, were recorded in early October 2010 and the album was released on April 5, 2011.

The Smithereens were the final band to perform at the fabled Bleecker Street nightclub Kenny&#x27;s Castaways in Greenwich Village, New York City, in October 2012.

In June 2013, The Smithereens toured as support for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.

Original bass player Mike Mesaros reunited with the band in 2016 and 2017 for select performances and continued to tour in 2018 through the present.

DiNizio died in Scotch Plains, New Jersey, on December 12, 2017, at the age of 62. According to bandmates, his health declined following a series of issues that began in 2015, resulting in nerve damage that limited the use of his right hand and arm.

The surviving members of the band, including Mesaros, performed together as The Smithereens in a tribute show to DiNizio on January 13, 2018, at the Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank, NJ. In a five-hour concert, the band was joined by Steven Van Zandt, Dave Davies, Ted Leo, Robin Wilson, Lenny Kaye, Southside Johnny, Marshall Crenshaw, Bebe Buell, Richard Barone, Tony Shanahan, Graham Maby, Freedy Johnston, Kenny Howes, John Jorgenson, Peter Zaremba, Keith Streng, producer Ed Stasium, Andy Burton, and various other musicians. The Pat DiNizio Musical Performance Scholarship was established at the Count Basie&#x27;s Performing Arts Academy.

In 2018, Babjak, Diken and Mesaros decided to continue the band&#x27;s musical legacy and tour with different guest vocalists, including Marshall Crenshaw and Robin Wilson of the Gin Blossoms, separately taking over lead vocal duties at concerts throughout the United States, including shows in NYC, Chicago, Massachusetts, Colorado and Virginia.

On May 25, 2018, the band released &quot;Covers&quot; on Sunset Blvd. Records, featuring 22 of the band&#x27;s favorite songs first recorded by other artists. The CD collects b-sides and movie soundtrack recordings, and some previously unreleased tracks.

On November 16, 2018, The Smithereens were nominated for induction into the New Jersey Hall of Fame, Performing Arts Category, Class of 2018.

In July 2020, the band released a 7-inch vinyl single of their cover of the Beatles&#x27; 1962 single &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and its B-side &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;. &quot;Love Me Do&quot; was originally recorded in 2008 during sessions for &quot;B-Sides The Beatles&quot; but was not considered for inclusion on the album. Both tracks feature session drummer Andy White, who originally performed on the Beatles versions. Mike Mesaros added new bass parts to both tracks and Kristin Pinell of the Grip Weeds guests on melodica.

In September 2022, The Smithereens released &quot;The Lost Album&quot;. It was originally recorded in 1993 between their recording contracts with Capitol and RCA. Eleven of the songs on &quot;The Lost Album&quot; (minus the Babjak-penned &quot;I&#x27;m Sexy&quot;) previously appeared on DiNizio&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Song Demos&quot; release (MCA Publishing). Selected songs were also previously included on DiNizio&#x27;s &quot;Songs and Sounds&quot; (1997)&quot;,&quot; &quot;Pat DiNizio&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Best of Pat Dinizio&quot; (2015)&quot;.&quot;

<text>Glendon College is a public liberal arts college in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Formally the federated bilingual campus of York University, it is one of the school&#x27;s nine colleges and 11 faculties with 100 full-time faculty members and a student population of about 2,100. 
Founded as the first permanent establishment of York University, the school began academic operation under the mentorship of the University of Toronto in September 1960. Under the &quot;York University Act 1959&quot; legislation, York was once an affiliated institution of the University of Toronto, where the first cohort of faculty and students originally utilized the Falconer Hall building (now part of the Faculty of Law) as a temporary home before relocating north of the St. George campus to Glendon Hall — an estate that was willed by Edward Rogers Wood for post-secondary purposes.

In 1962, a landlot grant was offered by the Province of Ontario to build a new university, which eventually ceased the bilateral partnership between the two schools. York University became an independent institution; however, Glendon refused to transfer to the main Keele Campus, as the University of Toronto had no interest in reacquiring or maintaining the donated Wood property. Murray G. Ross and diplomat Escott Reid, who mutually proposed a novel plan for the college to educate students for fields in civil service, governance and academia, were appointed president and principal in 1959 and 1965, respectively. In 1966, Glendon was officially inaugurated by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson with the objective of &quot;helping its students develop an informed and active interest in public affairs; by encouraging them to become committed to improving the community in which they live; the country of which they are citizens; and the world which they occupy.&quot;

== Bilingualism ==
Glendon College&#x27;s undergraduate curriculum emphasizes languages, communication, international affairs, and public policy. Due to this, the Government of Ontario declared Glendon the country&#x27;s first &quot;Centre of Excellence for French language and Bilingual Postsecondary Education,&quot; in collaboration with Collège Boréal. Because of Glendon&#x27;s bilingual nature, the campus received partial designation as an institution offering French services under the province&#x27;s &quot;French Language Services Act&quot;.

Language skill assessments are given to new students to determine the level needed to take to fulfil Glendon&#x27;s second-language requirement. Students who attain higher levels can either take advanced-level language instruction in their second language, or a discipline course taught solely in their second language. In addition, a variety of non-credit classes and programmes are offered by the college to students, faculty and the general public including introductory courses in foreign languages (Arabic, Cantonese, German, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Persian, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Tibetan); indigenous languages in Inuktitut and Ojibway; and professional development courses in English and French. Students also have the opportunity to take other language courses available through the Languages, Literature and Linguistics department at York University.

This bilingual approach to university education is said to be unique in Canada, because all students within Glendon College are required to study both English and French. Canada&#x27;s other bilingual post-secondary institutions, including portions of Concordia University, Laurentian University, University of Alberta (Faculté St-Jean), and the University of Ottawa, often educate students in one language or the other. Although each one offers students the option of a fully bilingual education, Glendon is the only institution in Canada where all anglophone and francophone students are required to take at least one compulsory class in their second language, regardless of their initial ability in the language.

The Université de l&#x27;Ontario français was established in April 2018 whose &quot;sole&quot; instructional language was French to serve francophones in the Central and Southwestern Ontario region. The Ontario and federal governments came to a funding agreement for the new university, which could start offering courses to full-time students in 2021. Some data suggest that Franco-Ontarian participation rates in university are comparable to that of English speakers, obviating the need for a French-language university. Advocates for a university whose sole instructional language is French have suggested that once it begins to accept full-time students, Glendon College should cease to offer courses in French.

== Degrees ==
Glendon is a primarily undergraduate institution where academics are rooted in the liberal arts tradition, although the college mainly specializes in the social sciences and humanities. Glendon offers 19 undergraduate degrees (BA) and 20 international Bachelor of Arts (iBA) concentrations. Glendon has a unique concurrent and consecutive Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) focused specifically on preparing teachers for French immersion, extended French and core French teaching positions in anglophone schools. Recently, Glendon initiated its first BSc/iBSc degrees in psychology and biology, a new BA/iBA degree in communications, and a business administration and international studies dual degree (BBA/iBA) in partnership with the EMLYON Business School in France.

There are also concurrent/consecutive certificate programs in a variety of fields (teaching English as an international language (D-TEIL), law and social thought, rédaction professionnelle (offered in French only), refugee and migration studies, sexuality studies, Spanish/English – English-Spanish translation, and technical and professional communication).

Since its inception in the early 1960s, Glendon has expanded to include graduate programs in French Studies (M.A.), Public and International Affairs (M.P.I.A.), Translation Studies (M.A.), and Conference Interpretation (M.C.I.). The translation and interpreting master&#x27;s programs build on the college&#x27;s strength in languages, while the public and international affairs degree is affiliated with the Glendon School of Public and International Affairs. Additionally, there is a doctoral degree in Francophone Studies (Ph.D.).

Any student attending Glendon can enroll in up to 50 percent of his or her classes at the larger Keele campus, and vice versa. This policy is meant to give students the resources of a larger university while retaining the qualities and features of a small college.

== Student life ==
Mirroring the campus life of small-scale American institutions like Swarthmore and Williams, Glendon has a tight-knit community within the larger student population of their sister campus. Various campus events are organized by the Glendon College Student Union/l&#x27;Association Étudiante du Collège Glendon (GCSU/AÉCG) and its membership includes all students enrolled in courses at Glendon College and elects a council to represent them. Students can join and access a number of clubs and organizations on both of the campuses. Glendon has a newspaper (&quot;Pro Tem&quot;), York University&#x27;s premier and longest student-run campus publication that is published in both English and French; a campus radio station (Radio Glendon); the Grand Rassemblement de l’Éducation en Français (GREF): Glendon&#x27;s French-language publishing house; and a black box theatre company, Theatre Glendon/Théâtre Glendon, in addition to similar media from York University.

Other facilities exist for students, such as a student lounge, a cafeteria, campus gym memberships, workshops, IT services, and a liaison office for prospective students. The college also encourages students to utilize academic resources on both campuses. The college&#x27;s proximity to Yonge and Eglinton and Downtown Toronto makes its location ideal for students who want to partake in the city&#x27;s diverse array of social and cultural attractions. Glendon College is also where the first issue of the &quot;Toronto Special&quot; newspaper was published, according to the &quot;National Post&quot;. The Salon Francophone, situated in the main building, is a social resource centre and a club, which organizes multiple activities to promote the French language.

Glendon was initially planned on being a residential college where students were required to live on campus, however, over the past few decades increases in the student population outnumbered the available residential spaces. Therefore, the majority of students commute, while only around 400 students live on campus. Glendon&#x27;s international profile attracts students from over 100 countries, in particular, a significant number of francophone students from across Canada (notably Quebec) and around the world, including France, Haiti, Belgium, Morocco, and Algeria. Approximately 1/3 of the student population are francophone. Additionally, Glendon has a visible hispanophone presence with more than 20% studying Spanish as a third language. The Spanish Resource Centre library at Glendon is a joint initiative between the Ministry of Education of the Government of Spain and the Hispanic studies department of York University.

== Campus ==

Glendon occupies the former country estate of Edward Rogers Wood, a prominent Toronto financier and philanthropist of the early 1900s. The estate was built in 1924 and is located at the intersection of Bayview and Lawrence Ave. between the midtown neighbourhoods of Lawrence Park and Bridle Path. The estate was the original York University campus when it was bequeathed by the University of Toronto, and it remained a liberal arts college when York&#x27;s Keele Campus was inaugurated in 1966. The college is formally one of York&#x27;s nine colleges and eleven faculties, and it is considered semi-autonomous within York University.

Glendon&#x27;s founder and first principal was Canadian diplomat Escott Reid, who foresaw the institution&#x27;s key mandate to educate future leaders of Canada in both official languages. Historically, the manor served as a temporary home for the Ontario College of Art in 1952, and the Faculty of Law of the University of Toronto in 1956. Moreover, the natural landscape of the 85-acre estate was used as an arboretum by the botany and forestry department at the University of Toronto.

Presently, the college is the institutional home of the Glendon School of Public &amp; International Affairs, the first bilingual graduate school in Canada to offer a MPIA, in collaboration with &quot;The Global Brief&quot;, Canada&#x27;s top international affairs publication. The graduate school also operates an interdisciplinary research institute for public policy — the Centre for Global Challenges. The Faculty of Graduate Studies also manages a PhD program and three other distinct MA programs. The Centre of Excellence for French language and Bilingual Post-secondary Education is Glendon&#x27;s recent expansion and was created to accommodate the growth of incoming students and the increasing demand for multilingual post-secondary education in Southern Ontario. The campus has also played host to several productions, namely &quot;American Psycho 2: All American Girl&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Time Traveler&#x27;s Wife&quot; (2009), which were extensively filmed in and around Glendon. Often, students are incorporated into shooting when the campus is sealed off for the weekends.

In 2011, the Canadian Language Museum was established to promote an appreciation of all the languages used in Canada and their role in the development of this nation.

=== Buildings and abbreviations ===

* York Hall (YH) / Pavillon York: The main building, shaped like an &#x27;h&#x27;, divided into four sections (the main wing, and the &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; wings). York Hall has two large lecture halls (one located in the Penthouse; the other in the Centre of Excellence), and houses smaller classrooms; departmental and professors&#x27; offices; the bookstore; the Rejean Garneau laboratory; the circular senate chamber; the theatre; as well as the school&#x27;s cafeteria and dining hall. The renovated expansion within &quot;B&quot; Wing—a space enclosed with full-size glass windows housing Glendon Recruitment and Liaison, the office of the student union, dedicated club space, the Salon Francophone, as well as a spacious social common area (to replace the former Salon Garigue lounge).
* The Centre of Excellence (COE) / Le Centre d&#x27;excellence: The latest extension to the existing &quot;A&quot; Wing of York Hall. The glass box building was designed by Montreal architect, Renée Daoust, and houses an amphitheatre, a studio, language labs, offices and additional commons space.
*Glendon Hall (GH) / Manoir Glendon: Originally the Italianate villa where the Edward R. Wood family resided (his brother Frank Porter Wood lived next door, where the Crescent School is now located). Today, it has two classrooms; an all-purpose room now known as the Bank of Montreal (BMO) Conference Centre; the CKRG campus radio station; the Career and Counselling Centre; Glendon&#x27;s administrative faculty offices (including that of the principal); the Canadian Language Museum; the Glendon School of Public and International Affairs; as well as the Lunik Café — a student-run cooperative that opened in September 2011. It is known informally as &quot;The Manor.&quot;
*Leslie Frost Library (FL) / Bibliothèque Leslie Frost: Opened in 1963, the library is named after Leslie Frost, the late Premier of Ontario and graduate of Osgoode Hall Law School. With a collection of over 300,000 items, the library features a computer lab, study rooms, and quiet reading spaces available for all York University students. Adjacent to the library is the Bruce Bryden Rose Garden, a rare and well-preserved example of British landscaping, with characteristics of Victorian &amp; Edwardian influences.
*Proctor Field House (PFH) / Pavillon Proctor: The campus athletics building houses the Glendon Athletic Club (GAC). The Glendon Athletic Club offers full gym facilities to students and the public, including a weight room, a cardio room, a pool, tennis and squash courts, an instructional studio, and a gymnasium. Proctor also holds group exercise programs such as spinning classes, yoga, martial arts, and dance lessons. In 1995, Proctor Field House served as the Toronto Raptors&#x27; practice facility.
*Hilliard Residence (HR) / Résidence Hilliard: A 215-room residence building, named after famed obstetrician Marion Hilliard. Students are divided between 6 dormitory-style houses (A, B, C, E, F, and G, respectively). With the exception of D-house, which is used for some professors&#x27; offices and classroom space, and G-house, which has suite-style rooms for upper-year students. A house can hold as many as 40 students. Each house is under the charge of a resident &quot;don&quot;, as well as Residence Life Assistants (RLAs) that oversee activities in both residence buildings. Differing from the Wood Residence, each of Hilliard&#x27;s houses do not exceed a single floor in reach, with two houses per floor. Hilliard also contains the offices of &quot;Pro Tem&quot;, the Women &amp; Trans Centre and Theatre Glendon storage space in Hilliard&#x27;s non-residential houses, D and H. The basement of Hilliard Residence contains a recreational room, available for all members of the residence.
*Wood Residence (WR) / Résidence Wood: A 189-room residence building. It houses students in typical dormitory-style rooms. Wood is the smaller of the two residences with only 22–30 students per house (section of the building). Students are divided into five houses A through E; each house spans four floors (including the basement) with a single shared common room on the ground floor. Changes in Residence Life programming have led to the creation of a &quot;Quiet Floor&quot; on the third floor of A House for students who wish to enjoy an extension of the regular late-night quiet hours when all residents must avoid inappropriately loud noises. As well, the entirety of C House will become &quot;Green&quot; for students who wish to enjoy a more environmentally friendly lifestyle within the residence.
*Greenhouse (GR) / La Serre: The Greenhouse was the Woods&#x27; old greenhouse, primarily under the care of Agnes Euphemia Smart, the widow of Mr. Wood. It is now used for the Security, Parking and Transportation Services offices, Housing and Residence services offices, as well as the campus goSAFE student escort service. Generally, students visit the Greenhouse to resolve security and campus fine issues, or for residence related issues such as keys/keycards, tax-exempt stickers for the cafeteria or any maintenance or service required in residence.

<text>A toxidrome (a portmanteau of &quot;toxic&quot; and &quot;syndrome&quot;, coined in 1970 by Mofenson and Greensher) is a syndrome caused by a dangerous level of toxins in the body. It is often the consequence of a drug overdose. Common symptoms include dizziness, disorientation, nausea, vomiting and oscillopsia. It may indicate a medical emergency requiring treatment at a poison control center. Aside from poisoning, a systemic infection may also lead to one. Classic toxidromes are presented below, which are variable or obscured by co-ingestion of multiple drugs.

A common tool for assessing for the presence of toxidrome in the United Kingdom is the CRESS tool. 
==Anticholinergic==

The symptoms of an anticholinergic toxidrome include blurred vision, coma, decreased bowel sounds, delirium, dry skin, fever, flushing, hallucinations, ileus, memory loss, mydriasis (dilated pupils), myoclonus, psychosis, seizures and urinary retention. Complications include hypertension, hyperthermia and tachycardia. Substances that may cause this toxidrome include antihistamines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiparkinsonian drugs, atropine, benztropine, datura, diphenhydramine and scopolamine.

==Cholinergic==

The symptoms of a cholinergic toxidrome include bronchorrhea, confusion, defecation, diaphoresis, diarrhea, emesis, lacrimation, miosis, muscle fasciculations, salivation, seizures, urination and weakness. Complications include bradycardia, hypothermia and tachypnea. Substances that may cause this toxidrome include carbamates, mushrooms and organophosphates.

==Hallucinogenic==
The symptoms of a hallucinogenic toxidrome include disorientation, hallucinations, hyperactive bowel sounds, panic and seizures. Complications include hypertension, tachycardia and tachypnea. Substances that may cause this toxidrome include substituted amphetamines, cocaine and phencyclidine.

==Opiate==

The symptoms of an opiate toxidrome include the classic triad of coma, pinpoint pupils and respiratory depression as well as altered mental states, shock, pulmonary edema and unresponsiveness. Complications include bradycardia, hypotension and hypothermia. Substances that may cause this toxidrome are opioids.

==Sedative/hypnotic==
The symptoms of sedative/hypnotic toxidrome include ataxia, blurred vision, coma, confusion, delirium, deterioration of central nervous system functions, diplopia, dysesthesias, hallucinations, nystagmus, paresthesias, sedation, slurred speech and stupor. Apnea is a potential complication. Substances that may cause it include anticonvulsants, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid, Methaqualone and ethanol. While most sedative-hypnotics are anticonvulsant, some such as GHB and methaqualone instead lower the seizure threshold, so can cause paradoxical seizures in overdose.

==Sympathomimetic==
The symptoms of a sympathomimetic toxidrome include anxiety, delusions, diaphoresis, hyperreflexia, mydriasis, paranoia, piloerection and seizures. Complications include hypertension and tachycardia. Substances that may cause this toxidrome include cocaine, amphetamine and compounds based upon amphetamine&#x27;s structure such as ephedrine (Ma Huang), methamphetamine, phenylpropanolamine and pseudoephedrine. The bronchodilator salbutamol may also cause this toxidrome. It may appear very similar to the anticholinergic toxidrome, but is distinguished by hyperactive bowel sounds and sweating.

<doc id="975450" wikidata="Q2269302" url="?curid=975450" title="Argument of periapsis">
<text>The argument of periapsis (also called argument of perifocus or argument of pericenter), symbolized as &quot;ω (omega)&quot;, is one of the orbital elements of an orbiting body. Parametrically, &quot;ω&quot; is the angle from the body&#x27;s ascending node to its periapsis, measured in the direction of motion. 

For specific types of orbits, terms such as argument of perihelion (for heliocentric orbits), argument of perigee (for geocentric orbits), argument of periastron (for orbits around stars), and so on, may be used (see apsis for more information).

An argument of periapsis of 0° means that the orbiting body will be at its closest approach to the central body at the same moment that it crosses the plane of reference from South to North. An argument of periapsis of 90° means that the orbiting body will reach periapsis at its northmost distance from the plane of reference.

Adding the argument of periapsis to the longitude of the ascending node gives the longitude of the periapsis. However, especially in discussions of binary stars and exoplanets, the terms &quot;longitude of periapsis&quot; or &quot;longitude of periastron&quot; are often used synonymously with &quot;argument of periapsis&quot;.

== Calculation==
In astrodynamics the argument of periapsis &quot;ω&quot; can be calculated as follows:
:formula_1 
::If &quot;ez&quot; &lt; 0 then &quot;ω&quot; → 2 − &quot;ω&quot;.

where:
* n is a vector pointing towards the ascending node (i.e. the &quot;z&quot;-component of n is zero),
* e is the eccentricity vector (a vector pointing towards the periapsis).

In the case of equatorial orbits (which have no ascending node), the argument is strictly undefined. However, if the convention of setting the longitude of the ascending node Ω to 0 is followed, then the value of &quot;ω&quot; follows from the two-dimensional case:
formula_2 
::If the orbit is clockwise (i.e. (r × v)&quot;z&quot; &lt; 0) then &quot;ω&quot; → 2 − &quot;ω&quot;.

where:
*&quot;ex&quot; and &quot;ey&quot; are the &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-components of the eccentricity vector e.

In the case of circular orbits it is often assumed that the periapsis is placed at the ascending node and therefore &quot;ω&quot; = 0. However, in the professional exoplanet community, &quot;ω&quot; = 90° is more often assumed for circular orbits, which has the advantage that the time of a planet&#x27;s inferior conjunction (which would be the time the planet would transit if the geometry were favorable) is equal to the time of its periastron.

<text>Charles Francis Adams (October 18, 1876 – October 2, 1947) was an American businessman and sports promoter who was the owner of the Boston Bruins, Boston Braves, Suffolk Downs, and The First National grocery store chain.

==Early life==
Adams was born in Newport, Vermont, on October 18, 1876, to Frank and Elizabeth (Benoit) Adams. His family struggled financially and at a young age Adams took a job as a chore boy at a corner grocery store to help subsidize the family&#x27;s income. As a teenager Adams purchased logs for his father&#x27;s sawmill.

==Grocery career==
After graduating from Jenney Business College in Enosburgh, Vermont, Adams moved to Springfield, Vermont, where he worked for his uncle Oscar Adams&#x27; wholesale grocery business. After working for a time as a traveling grocer and tobacco salesman, Adams moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he became treasurer of the New England Maple Syrup Company. He later worked for the Fitzgerald, Hubbard &amp; Company banking and brokerage firm.

Adams left Fitzgerald, Hubbard &amp; Company to work for the John T. Connor Company, which later became the First National Store Finast chain.

==Sports==

===Boston Bruins===
Adams was an avid hockey fan, watching amateur hockey in Boston and traveling to Montreal to watch professional hockey. After a scandal involving Boston amateur hockey players resulted in many Boston fans becoming disenchanted with amateur hockey, Adams decided to try to bring professional hockey to the United States. On November 1, 1924, Adams was awarded the Bruins franchise for $15,000.

In 1926 Adams bought the entire Western Canada Hockey League from Frank Patrick and Lester Patrick for $300,000. This gave the Bruins the rights to Eddie Shore, Harry Oliver, Duke Keats, and Frank Boucher. To ensure the team had a fitting arena to play in, Adams guaranteed $500,000 toward the construction of the Boston Garden.

Under his leadership the Bruins won their first Stanley Cup in 1929.

In 1936 he transferred his stock to his son Weston Adams and minority owners Art Ross and Ralph Burkard.

===Boston Braves===
On May 15, 1927, Charles Adams bought out the shares of Albert H. Powell to become a minority owner and vice-president of the National League baseball club, the Boston Braves. In 1935, after Emil Fuchs&#x27; attempt to revive interest in the team by signing Babe Ruth failed, Adams demanded that Fuchs either step down as President or buy out his shares. On July 31, 1935, Emil Fuchs forfeited his shares to Charles F. Adams, who planned to sell the team as soon as possible. On November 26, the National League took over control of the Braves due to the club&#x27;s failure to fulfill its contractual obligations. The club was awarded to Bob Quinn on December 10. Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis did not allow Adams to be part of the new ownership group due to his stake in Suffolk Downs.

===Suffolk Downs===
Adams was the head of Eastern Racing Association, the syndicate that founded Suffolk Downs. He remained involved with the race track until 1945, when he sold his shares for $4 million.

==Death and legacy==
Adams died in Boston on October 2, 1947, 16 days before his 71st birthday, after a long illness.

He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1960.

The NHL&#x27;s Adams Division was formed in 1974 as part of the Prince of Wales Conference. The division existed for 19 seasons until 1993. It was named in honor of Adams. The Bruins were a member of the Adams Division for the entirety of its existence, winning nine division titles and appearing in four Stanley Cup Finals in that time. It was succeeded by the Northeast Division, which was dissolved with the league&#x27;s 2013 realignment, and can be considered the fore-runner of the NHL&#x27;s current Atlantic Division.

Adams was inducted into the Vermont Sports Hall of Fame in 2013.

<doc id="975474" wikidata="Q2718934" url="?curid=975474" title="Longitude of periapsis">
<text>In celestial mechanics, the longitude of the periapsis, also called longitude of the pericenter, of an orbiting body is the longitude (measured from the point of the vernal equinox) at which the periapsis (closest approach to the central body) would occur if the body&#x27;s orbit inclination were zero. It is usually denoted &quot;ϖ&quot;.

For the motion of a planet around the Sun, this position is called longitude of perihelion ϖ, which is the sum of the longitude of the ascending node Ω, and the argument of perihelion ω.

The longitude of periapsis is a compound angle, with part of it being measured in the plane of reference and the rest being measured in the plane of the orbit. Likewise, any angle derived from the longitude of periapsis (e.g., mean longitude and true longitude) will also be compound.

Sometimes, the term &quot;longitude of periapsis&quot; is used to refer to &quot;ω&quot;, the angle between the ascending node and the periapsis. That usage of the term is especially common in discussions of binary stars and exoplanets. However, the angle ω is less ambiguously known as the argument of periapsis.

==Calculation from state vectors==
&quot;ϖ&quot; is the sum of the longitude of ascending node Ω (measured on ecliptic plane) and the argument of periapsis &quot;ω&quot; (measured on orbital plane):
formula_1

which are derived from the orbital state vectors.

==Derivation of ecliptic longitude and latitude of perihelion for inclined orbits==
Define the following:
Then:
The right ascension α and declination δ of the direction of perihelion are:

If A &lt; 0, add 180° to α to obtain the correct quadrant.

The ecliptic longitude ϖ and latitude b of perihelion are:

If cos(α) &lt; 0, add 180° to ϖ to obtain the correct quadrant.

As an example, using the most up-to-date numbers from Brown (2017) for the hypothetical Planet Nine with i = 30°, ω = 136.92°, and Ω = 94°, then α = 237.38°, δ = +0.41° and ϖ = 235.00°, b = +19.97° (Brown actually provides i, Ω, and ϖ, from which ω was computed).

<text>KSJS (90.5 MHz) is a college radio station that broadcasts 24 hours a day from the campus of San Jose State University in San Jose, California, United States. The brainchild of Professor Clarence Flick, it went on the air on February 11, 1963, with only 85 watts of power. The studio is located in Hugh Gillis Hall, easily accessible to majors. Originally, its transmitting antenna was installed atop the Walquist Library Building on campus, but broadcasting range was adversely affected due to the nearby Bank of America Building&#x27;s superior height. Today, however, its transmitter atop Coyote Peak broadcasts 1,500 watts, allowing the station to be heard by the entire Santa Clara Valley and much of the San Francisco Peninsula. Currently, the station features five musical formats: urban, electronic, alternative rock, rock en Español, and jazz. In addition, KSJS has student-produced broadcasts of San Jose State Spartans sports teams, including football, basketball, and baseball.

==History==
KSJS carried regular news programs produced by San Jose State&#x27;s Radio-Television News Center, which had been started by Professor Gordon Greb in 1957. The programs in the 1960s included a world and national news program, broadcast shortly after the daily sign-on, and &quot;Spectrum,&quot; a college news program with emphasis on San Jose State news.

In 1958, San Jose State created closed-circuit radio station KOED.

From the 1970s through the early 1980s, KSJS was heavily formatted, with students learning to &quot;talk up&quot; records, play public service announcements at appropriate times and even &quot;backtime&quot; songs to a top-of-the-hour newscast. In recent years, the station has taken on more of a free-form approach. KSJS has been named &quot;Station of the Year&quot; twice by the National Association of College Broadcasters.

<text>Cape Sounion (Modern Greek: Aκρωτήριο Σούνιο &quot;Akrotírio Soúnio&quot; ; &quot;Άkron Soúnion&quot;, latinized &quot;Sunium&quot;; Venetian: &quot;Capo Colonne&quot; &quot;Cape of Columns&quot;) is the promontory at the southernmost tip of the Attica peninsula, south of the town of Lavrio (ancient Thoricus), and 69.5 km (43.1 miles) southeast of Athens in the Athens Riviera. It is part of Lavreotiki municipality, East Attica, Greece. 

Cape Sounion is noted for its Temple of Poseidon, one of the major monuments of the Golden Age of Athens. Its remains are perched on the headland, surrounded on three sides by the Aegean sea.

==Climate==

Cape Sounio has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSh&quot;). Cape Sounio experiences hot, dry summers and mild, wetter winters.

==History==
The earliest literary reference to Sounion is in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; (III. 278–285). The story recounts that as the various Greek commanders sailed back from Troy, the helmsman of the ship of King Menelaus of Sparta died at his post while rounding &quot;Holy Sounion, Cape of Athens.&quot; Menelaus landed at Sounion to give his companion full funeral honours (i.e., cremation on a funeral pyre on the beach).

Archaeological finds on the site date from as early as 700 BC. Herodotus (VI.87) mentions that in sixth century BC, the Athenians celebrated a quinquennial festival at Sounion, which involved Athens&#x27; leaders sailing to the cape in a sacred boat.

===Deme===

Sounion was a deme of the Leontis tribe (phyle) even before its fortification in the Peloponnesian War. It sent four men to the ancient Boule of 500 at the time of Cleisthenes, and later (3rd century BC) six men to the Boule of 600. In the 2nd century BC, Sounion is still on record as a deme, but now considered part of the recently-introduced &quot;Attalid&quot; phyle (created in honour of Attalus I).

The deme was located between Amphitrope to the west and Thorikos to the north. Its territory included parts of the Mines of Laurion. According to Traill (1986), the center of the settlement was situated somewhat to the north of the cape, between the modern settlements of &quot;Ano Sounio&quot; and &quot;Kato Sounio&quot; (close to ).

Sounion was fortified in the nineteenth year of the Peloponnesian War (413 BCE) for the purpose of protecting the passage of the cornships to Athens, and was regarded from that time as one of the principal fortresses of Attica. Its proximity to the silver mines of Laurium probably contributed to its prosperity, which passed into a proverb; but even in the time of Cicero it had sunk into decay. The circuit of the walls may still be traced, except where the precipitous nature of the rocks afforded a natural defence. The walls which are fortified with square towers, are of the most regular Hellenic masonry, and enclose a space of a little more than half a mile in circumference. The southern part of Attica, extending northwards from the promontory of Sounion as far as Thoricus on the east, and Anaphlystus on the west, is called by Herodotus the Suniac angle (τὸν γουνὸν τὸν Σουνιακόν). Though Sounion was especially sacred to Athena, we learn from Aristophanes that Poseidon was also worshipped there.

===Temple of Poseidon===

The original, Archaic-period temple of Poseidon on the site was built of tufa. The Sounion Kouros, discovered in 1906 in a pit east of the temple alongside fragments of other statues, was probably one of a number of votive statues dedicated to Poseidon which probably stood in front of the god&#x27;s sanctuary. The archaic temple was probably destroyed in 480 BC by Persian troops during Xerxes I&#x27;s invasion of Greece. After they defeated Xerxes in the naval Battle of Salamis, the Athenians placed an entire captured enemy trireme (warship with three banks of oars) at Sounion as a trophy dedicated to Poseidon.

The temple of Poseidon at Sounion was constructed in 444–440 BC. This was during the ascendancy of the Athenian statesman Pericles, who also rebuilt the Parthenon in Athens. It was built on the ruins of a temple dating from the Archaic period. It is perched above the sea at a height of almost . The design of the temple is a typical hexastyle, i.e., it had a front portico with six columns. Only some columns of the Sounion temple stand today, but when intact it would have closely resembled the contemporary and well-preserved Temple of Hephaestus beneath the Acropolis, which may have been designed by the same architect.

As with all Greek temples, the Poseidon building was rectangular, with a colonnade on all four sides. The total number of original columns was 34, of which 15 still stand today. The columns are of the Doric Order. They were made of locally quarried white marble. They were 6.10 m (20 ft) high, with a diameter of 1 m (3.1 ft) at the base and 79 cm (31 inches) at the top. At the center of the temple, there would have been a hall of worship (&quot;naos&quot;), a windowless rectangular room, similar to the partly intact hall at the Temple of Hephaestus. It would have contained, at one end facing the entrance, the cult image, a colossal, ceiling-height () bronze statue of Poseidon.

===Temple of Athena===
The temple of Athena Souniados (Ναός της Αθηνάς Σουνιάδος ), was located on a low hill some 300 m northeast of the temple of Poseidon. It was built in 470 BC, replacing an older building of the 6th century BCE (https://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/temple-athena-sounio.html). Its architecture was unusual, as it had colonnades on the southern and eastern sides, but not on the western or northern sides, a peculiarity mentioned by Vitruvius. It was built adjacent to a peribolos identified as the burial mound and shrine to Phrontis, the helmsman of Menelaus whose burial at Sounion is mentioned in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

A smaller Doric temple next to the temple of Athena is thought to have been dedicated either to the hero Phrontis or to Artemis.
A deep pit southeast of the temenos was used to deposit the remains of the Archaic-period offerings destroyed during the Persian invasion.

The temple of Athena was demolished in the 1st century AD, and parts of its columns were taken to Athens to be used in the South-East temple of the Agora.

===Fortress===

In 413 BC, during the Peloponnesian War against the Spartans, the Athenians fortified the site with a wall and towers to prevent it from falling into Spartan hands. This would have threatened Athens&#x27; seaborne grain supply route from Euboea. Athens&#x27; supply situation had become critical since the city&#x27;s land supply lines had been cut by the Spartan fortification of Dekeleia, to the north of Attica. The Sounion fortress was soon later seized from the Athenians by a force of rebel slaves from the nearby silver mines of Laurium.

The Temple of Poseidon was situated in the southeastern corner of the fortress, with the garrison quarters arranged along a main stream on the western slope of the hill. The fortress included a small naval base, with a shipshed for two warships in the northwestern corner (). The fortress was maintained well into the Hellenistic period. Repairs and additions to the fortress were made during the Chremonidean War (266–261 BC).

==Literary reception==
The name &quot;Capo Colonne&quot; (graecicized &quot;Kavokolones&quot;) is reported from the 17th century, for the reason that unusually, several columns of the temple of Poseidon had remained standing since antiquity. Early modern descriptions in travelogues include those by G. Wheler (1676), Lady Mary Wortley Montague (1718),J.-D. Le Roy (1754), R. Chandler (1765) and E. Dodwell (1805). Scottish poet William Falconer (1732–1769) was shipwrecked off Cape Colonna, as Sounion was then known, in 1750, an event depicted in the central scene of his &quot;The Shipwreck&quot; (1762).

The inscribed name of George Lord Byron, carved into the base of one of the columns of the Temple of Poseidon, possibly dates from his first visit to Greece, on his Grand Tour of Europe before he acquired fame. Byron spent several months in 1810–11 in Athens, including two documented visits to Sounion. There is, however, no direct evidence that the inscription was made by Byron himself. Byron mentions Sounion in his poem &quot;Isles of Greece&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;Place me on Sunium&#x27;s marbled steep,
Where nothing, save the waves and I,
May hear our mutual murmurs sweep...&lt;/poem&gt;

Martin Heidegger visited Sounion during his journey to Greece in 1962, as described in his book &quot;Sojourns&quot;. He refers to the &quot;gleaming-white ruins of the temple&quot;. In the strong sea breeze &quot;these few standing columns were the strings of an invisible lyre, the song of which the far-seeing Delian god let resonate over the Cycladic world of islands&quot;. He marvels at &quot;the way that this single gesture of the land suggests the invisible nearness of the divine and dedicates to it every growth and every human work&quot; (ibid.). He goes on to reflect &quot;the people of this country knew how to inhabit and demarcate the world against the barbarous in honour of the seat of the gods. ...they knew how to praise what is great and by acknowledging it, to bring themselves in front of the sublime, founding, in this way, a world&quot; (ibid.).

==Modern development==
Cape Sounion remains a popular day-excursion for tourists from Athens, with the sunset over the Aegean Sea, as viewed from the ruins, a sought-after sight since the first development of modern tourism in the early 19th century.

The Lavreotiki municipality was established in 1890 under the name of &quot;Sounio&quot;, and renamed to Lavreotiki in 1891. Cape Sounion itself is located between the villages of Kato Sounio and Legrena.

The Sounio national park (Εθνικός Δρυμός τού Σουνίου) was established in 1974 with a core area of 750 hectares.

Forming the southeastern endpoint of the Athens Riviera, Sounion is now an upscale summer home location for Athenians. Construction of villas across the bay northwest of Cape Sounion flourished in the 1960s to 1970s. The Grecotel Cape Sounio luxury resort was built in 1973.

The project Arrangement of the Archaeological Site of Sounion (2011–2013) was co-financed by the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports and the European Union (ERDF).

<text>Street photography is photography conducted for art or inquiry that features unmediated chance encounters and random incidents within public places. It usually has the aim of capturing images at a decisive or poignant moment by careful framing and timing. Street photography overlaps widely with candid photography, although the latter can also be used in other settings, such as portrait photography and event photography.

Street photography does not necessitate the presence of a street or even the urban environment. Though people usually feature directly, street photography might be absent of people and can be of an object or environment where the image projects a decidedly human character in facsimile or aesthetic.
Street photography can focus on people and their behavior in public. In this respect, the street photographer is similar to social documentary photographers or photojournalists who also work in public places, but with the aim of capturing newsworthy events. Any of these photographers&#x27; images may capture people and property visible within or from public places, which often entails navigating ethical issues and laws of privacy, security, and property.

Much of what is regarded, stylistically and subjectively, as definitive street photography was made in the era spanning the end of the 19th century through to the late 1970s, a period which saw the emergence of portable cameras that enabled candid photography in public places.

==History==
Depictions of everyday public life form a genre in almost every period of world art, beginning in the pre-historic, Sumerian, Egyptian and early Buddhist art periods. Art dealing with the life of the street, whether within views of cityscapes, or as the dominant motif, appears in the West in the canon of the Northern Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, of Romanticism, Realism, Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. With the type having been so long established in other media, it followed that photographers would also pursue the subject as soon as technology enabled them.

===Nineteenth-century precursors===

In 1838 or 1839 the first photograph of figures in the street was recorded by Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre in one of a pair of daguerreotype views taken from his studio window of the Boulevard du Temple in Paris. The second, made at the height of the day, shows an unpopulated stretch of street, while the other was taken at about 8:00 am, and as Beaumont Newhall reports, &quot;The Boulevard, so constantly filled with a moving throng of pedestrians and carriages was perfectly solitary, except an individual who was having his boots brushed. His feet were compelled, of course, to be stationary for some time, one being on the box of the boot black, and the other on the ground. Consequently his boots and legs were well defined, but he is without body or head, because these were in motion.&quot;
Charles Nègre was the first photographer to attain the technical sophistication required to register people in movement on the street in Paris in 1851. Photographer John Thomson, a Scotsman working with journalist and social activist Adolphe Smith, published &quot;Street Life in London&quot; in twelve monthly installments starting in February 1877. Thomson played a key role in making everyday life on the streets a significant subject for the medium.

Eugene Atget is regarded as a progenitor, not because he was the first of his kind, but as a result of the popularisation in the late 1920s of his record of Parisian streets by Berenice Abbott, who was inspired to undertake a similar documentation of New York City. As the city developed, Atget helped to promote Parisian streets as a worthy subject for photography. From the 1890s to the 1920s he mainly photographed its architecture, stairs, gardens, and windows. He did photograph some workers, but people were not his main interest.

First sold in 1925, the Leica was the first commercially successful camera to use 35 mm film. Its compactness and bright viewfinder, matched to lenses of quality (changeable on Leicas sold from 1930) helped photographers move through busy streets and capture fleeting moments.

===Twentieth-century practitioners===

====United Kingdom====
Paul Martin is considered a pioneer, making candid unposed photographs of people in London and at the seaside in the late 19th and early 20th century in order to record life. Martin is the first recorded photographer to do so in London with a disguised camera.

Mass-Observation was a social research organisation founded in 1937 which aimed to record everyday life in Britain and to record the reactions of the &#x27;man-in-the-street&#x27; to King Edward VIII&#x27;s abdication in 1936 to marry divorcée Wallis Simpson, and the succession of George VI. Humphrey Spender made photographs on the streets of the northern English industrial town of Bolton, identified for the project&#x27;s publications as &quot;Yorktown&quot;, while filmmaker Humphrey Jennings made a cinematic record in London for a parallel branch of investigation. The chief Mass-Observationists were anthropologist Tom Harrisson in Bolton and poet Charles Madge in London, and their first report was produced as the book &quot;May the Twelfth: Mass-Observation Day-Surveys 1937 &quot;by over two hundred observers&quot;&quot;

====France====

The post-war French Humanist School photographers found their subjects on the street or in the bistro. They worked primarily in black‐and‐white in available light with the popular small cameras of the day, discovering what the writer Pierre Mac Orlan (1882–1970) called the &quot;fantastique social de la rue&quot; (social fantastic of the street) and their style of image-making rendered romantic and poetic the way of life of ordinary European people, particularly in Paris. Between 1946 and 1957 Le Groupe des XV annually exhibited work of this kind.
Street photography formed the major content of two exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York curated by Edward Steichen, &quot;Five French Photographers: Brassai; Cartier-Bresson, Doisneau, Ronis, Izis&quot; in 1951 to 1952, and &quot;Post-war European Photography&quot; in 1953, which exported the concept of street photography internationally. Steichen drew on large numbers of European humanist and American humanistic photographs for his 1955 exhibition &quot;The Family of Man,&quot; proclaimed as a compassionate portrayal of a global family, which toured the world, inspiring photographers in the depiction of everyday life.

Henri Cartier-Bresson&#x27;s widely admired &quot;Images à la Sauvette&quot; (1952) (the English-language edition was titled &quot;The Decisive Moment)&quot; promoted the idea of taking a picture at what he termed the &quot;decisive moment&quot;; &quot;when form and content, vision and composition merged into a transcendent whole&quot;. His book inspired successive generations of photographers to make candid photographs in public places before this approach &quot;per se&quot; came to be considered déclassé in the aesthetics of postmodernism.

====America====
Walker Evans worked from 1938 to 1941 on a series in the New York City Subway in order to practice a pure &#x27;record method&#x27; of photography; candid portraits of people who would unconsciously come &#x27;into range before an impersonal fixed recording machine during a certain time period&#x27;. The recording machine was &#x27;a hidden camera&#x27;, a 35 mm Contax concealed beneath his coat, that was &#x27;strapped to the chest and connected to a long wire strung down the right sleeve&#x27;. However, his work had little contemporary impact as due to Evans&#x27; sensitivities about the originality of his project and the privacy of his subjects, it was not published until 1966, in the book &quot;Many Are Called&quot;, with an introduction written by James Agee in 1940. The work was exhibited as &quot;Walker Evans Subway Photographs and Other Recent Acquisition&quot;s held at the National Gallery of Art, 1991–1992, accompanied by the catalogue &quot;Walker Evans: Subways and Streets&quot;.

Helen Levitt, then a teacher of young children, associated with Evans in 1938–39. She documented the transitory chalk drawings that were part of children&#x27;s street culture in New York at the time, as well as the children who made them. In July 1939, MoMA&#x27;s new photography section included Levitt&#x27;s work in its inaugural exhibition. In 1943, Nancy Newhall curated her first solo exhibition &quot;Helen Levitt: Photographs of Children&quot; there. The photographs were ultimately published in 1987 as &quot;In The Street: chalk drawings and messages, New York City 1938–1948&quot;.

The beginnings of street photography in the United States can also be linked to those of jazz, both emerging as outspoken depictions of everyday life. This connection is visible in the work of the New York school of photography (not to be confused with the New York School). The New York school of photography was not a formal institution, but rather comprised groups of photographers in the mid-20th century based in New York City.

Robert Frank&#x27;s 1958 book, &quot;The Americans&quot;, was significant; raw and often out of focus, Frank&#x27;s images questioned mainstream photography of the time, &quot;challenged all the formal rules laid down by Henri Cartier-Bresson and Walker Evans&quot; and &quot;flew in the face of the wholesome pictorialism and heartfelt photojournalism of American magazines like LIFE and Time&quot;. Although the photo-essay format was formative in his early years in Switzerland, Frank rejected it: &quot;I wanted to follow my own intuition and do it my way, and not make any concession – not make a Life story&#x27;. Even the work of Cartier-Bresson he regarded as insufficiently subjective: &quot;I&#x27;ve always thought it was terribly important to have a point of view, and I was also sort of disappointed in him [Cartier-Bresson] that that was never in his pictures&#x27;.

Frank&#x27;s work thus epitomises the subjectivity of postwar American photography, as John Szarkowski prominently argued; &quot;Minor White&#x27;s magazine &quot;Aperture&quot; and Robert Frank&#x27;s book &quot;The Americans&quot; were characteristic of the new work of their time in the sense that they were both uncompromisingly committed to a highly personal vision of the world&quot;. His claim for subjectivism is widely accepted, resulting more recently in Patricia Vettel-Becker&#x27;s perspective on postwar street photography as highly masculine and centred on the male body, and Lili Corbus Benzer positioning Robert Frank&#x27;s book as negatively prioritising &#x27;personal vision&#x27; over social activism. Mainstream photographers in America fiercely rejected Frank&#x27;s work, but the book later &quot;changed the nature of photography, what it could say and how it could say it&quot;. It was a stepping stone for fresh photographers looking to break away from the restrictions of the old style and &quot;remains perhaps the most influential photography book of the 20th century&quot;. Szarkowski&#x27;s recognition of Frank&#x27;s subjectivity led him to promote more street photography in America, such as his curation of the 1967 New Documents exhibition featuring Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander and Garry Winogrand or of Mark Cohen&#x27;s work in 1973. Both at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).

===Individual approaches in the later twentieth and early twenty-first centuries===
Inspired by Frank, in the 1960s Garry Winogrand, Lee Friedlander and Joel Meyerowitz began photographing on the streets of New York. Phil Coomes, writing for BBC News in 2013, said &quot;For those of us interested in street photography there are a few names that stand out and one of those is Garry Winogrand&quot;; critic Sean O&#x27;Hagan, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2014, said &quot;In the 1960s and 70s, he defined street photography as an attitude as well as a style – and it has laboured in his shadow ever since, so definitive are his photographs of New York.&quot;

Returning to the UK in 1965 from the US where he had met Winogrand and adopted street photography, Tony Ray-Jones turned a wry eye on often surreal groupings of British people on their holidays or participating in festivals. The acerbic comic vein of Ray-Jones&#x27; high-contrast monochromes, which before his premature death were popularized by &quot;Creative Camera&quot; (for which he conducted an interview with Brassaï), is mined more recently by Martin Parr in hyper-saturated colour.

== Characteristics and Distinctions ==
Street photography is a vast genre that can be defined in many ways, but it is often characterized by the spontaneous capturing of an unrepeatable, fleeting moment, often of the everyday going-ons of strangers. It is classically shot with wider angle lenses (e.g. 35mm) and usually features urban environments.

=== Street photography versus documentary photography ===
Street photography and documentary photography are similar genres of photography that often overlap while having distinct individual qualities.

Documentary photographers typically have a defined, premeditated message and an intention to record particular events in history. The gamut of the documentary approach encompasses aspects of journalism, art, education, sociology and history. In social investigation, documentary images are often intended to provoke, or to highlight the need for, societal change. Conversely, street photography is reactive and disinterested by nature and motivated by curiosity or creative inquiry, allowing it to deliver a relatively neutral depiction of the world that mirrors society, &quot;unmanipulated&quot; and with usually unaware subjects.

=== Candid street photography versus street portraits ===
Street photography is generally seen as unposed and candid, but there are a few street photographers who interact with strangers on the streets and take their portraits. Street portraits are unplanned portraits taken of strangers while out doing street photography, however they are seen as posed because there is interaction with the subject.

==Legal concerns==
The issue of street photographers taking photographs of strangers in public places &quot;without their consent&quot; (i.e. &#x27;candid photography&#x27; by definition) for fine art purposes has been controversial. Photographing people and places in public is legal in most countries protecting freedom of expression and journalistic freedom. There are usually limits on how photos of people may be used and most countries have specific laws regarding people&#x27;s privacy.

Street photography may also conflict with laws that were originally established to protect against paparazzi, defamation, or harassment and special laws will sometimes apply when taking pictures of minors.

===Canada===
While the common-law provinces follow the United Kingdom, with respect to the freedom to take pictures in a public place, Quebec law provides that, in most circumstances, their publication can take place only with the consent of the subjects therein.

===European Union===
The European Union&#x27;s Human Rights Act 1998, which all EU countries have to uphold in their domestic law, establishes in a right to privacy. This can result in restrictions on the publication of photography. The right to privacy is protected by Article 8 of the convention. In the context of photography, it stands at odds to the Article 10 right of freedom of expression. As such, courts will usually consider the public interest in balancing the rights through the legal test of proportionality.

===France===
While also limiting photography in order to protect privacy rights, street photography can still be legal in France when pursued as an art form under certain circumstances. While in one prominent case the freedom of artistic expression trumped the individual&#x27;s right to privacy, the legality will much depend on the individual case.

===Germany===
Germany protects the right to take photos in public, but also recognizes a &quot;right to one&#x27;s own picture&quot;. That means that even though pictures can often be &quot;taken&quot; without someones consent, they must not be published without the permission of the person in the picture. The law also protects specifically against defamation&quot;.

This right to one&#x27;s picture, however, does not extend to people who are not the main focus of the picture (e.g. who just wandered into a scene), or who are not even recognizable in the photo. It also does not usually extend to people who are public figures (e.g. politicians or celebrities).

If a picture is considered art, the courts will also consider the photographer&#x27;s freedom of artistic expression; meaning that &quot;artful&quot; street photography can still be legally published in certain cases.

===Greece===
Production, publication and non-commercial sale of street photography is legal in Greece, without the need to have the consent of the shown person or persons. In Greece the right to take photographs and publish them or sell licensing rights over them as fine art or editorial content is protected by the Constitution of Greece (Article 14 and other articles) and free speech laws as well as by case law and legal cases. Photographing the police and publishing the photographs is also legal.

Photography and video-taking is also permitted across the whole Athens Metro transport network, which is very popular among Greek street photographers.

===Hungary===
In Hungary, from 15 March 2014 anyone taking photographs is technically breaking the law if someone wanders into shot, under a new civil code that outlaws taking pictures without the permission of everyone in the photograph. This expands the law on consent to include the taking of photographs, in addition to their publication.

===Japan===
In Japan permission, or at least signification of intent to photo and the absence of refusal, is needed both for photography and for publication of photos of &quot;recognisable&quot; people even in public places. &#x27;Hidden photography&#x27; (&quot;kakushidori&quot; hidden, surreptitious photography) &#x27;stolen photography&#x27; (&quot;tōsatsu&quot; with no intention of getting permission) and &quot;fast photography&#x27; (&quot;hayayori&quot; before permission and refusal can be given) are forbidden unless in the former permission is obtained from the subject immediately after taking the photo. People have rights to their images (&quot;shōzōken&quot;, &quot;droit de image&quot;). The law is especially strict when that which is taken, or the taking, is in any sense shameful. Exception is made for photos of famous people in public places and news photography by registered news media outlets where favour is given to the public right to know.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, photographing people in public is legal. Reproducing and selling photographs of people is legal for editorial and limited fair use commercial purposes. There exists no case law to define what the limits on commercial use are. Civil law requires the consent of any identifiable persons for advertorial and promotional purposes. Property, including animals, do not enjoy any special consideration.

===South Korea===
In South Korea, taking pictures of women without their consent, even in public, is considered to be criminal sexual assault, punishable by a fine of up to 10 million won and up to 5 years imprisonment. In July 2017 an amendment to the law was voted on in favour of allowing for chemical castration of people taking such photographs.

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom has enacted domestic law in accordance with the Human Rights Act, which limits the publication of certain photographs in the context of the news media. However, as a general rule, the taking of photographs of other people, including children, in a public place is legal, whether or not the person consents.

In terms of photographing property, in general under UK law one cannot prevent photography of private property from a public place, and in general the right to take photographs on private land upon which permission has been obtained is similarly unrestricted. However, landowners are permitted to impose any conditions they wish upon entry to a property, such as forbidding or restricting photography. There are however nuances to these broad principles, and even where photography is restricted as a condition of entry, the landowner&#x27;s remedies for a breach will usually be limited to asking the photographer to leave the premises. They cannot confiscate cameras or memory cards nor can they require photographs be deleted.

===United States===
In the US, the protection of free speech is generally interpreted widely, and encompasses art speech, including photography. As such, street photography is exempt from right to privacy claims.

For example, the case &quot;Nussenzweig v. DiCorcia&quot; established that taking, publishing and selling street photography (including street portraits) is legal, even without the consent of the person being portrayed, because photography is protected as free speech and art by the First Amendment. However, the Court of Appeals for the State of New York upheld the &quot;Nussenzweig&quot; decision solely on the basis of the statute of limitations expiring and did not address the free speech and First Amendment arguments.

Street photography is additionally protected by court precedent. As courts regularly uphold that individuals have no right to privacy in public places, there is little, if any, legal action that can be taken against a street photographer.

== Ethical concerns ==
Street photography&#x27;s nonconsensual nature can raise concerns about privacy and autonomy.

=== Privacy ===
An invasion of privacy occurs when an individual&#x27;s right to privacy is infringed upon by unwelcome intrusion into their private life, including public disclosure of private information. While a person may lose their reasonable expectation of privacy when going out in public according to court precedent, some feel that individuals should be able to control their information (such as their image) even in public. These critics would contend that it cannot be said that every person in public accepts the possibility of being photographed because assumption of risk is based on conscious consent, and might also argue that a photograph&#x27;s ability to accentuate details means that it does more than just record what the public sees.

=== Autonomy ===
As the right to privacy can be seen as protecting representations of oneself and since nonconsensual use of an individual&#x27;s image in street photography denies the subject control of the final image, some view street photography as taking away autonomy. When a person is not asked for consent to use their picture, they do not get to decide whether or where the picture is published or how it is viewed.

<doc id="975496" wikidata="Q17110191" url="?curid=975496" title="Sly Fox">
<text>Sly Fox is a comedic play by Larry Gelbart, based on Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Volpone&quot; (&quot;The Fox&quot;), updating the setting from Renaissance Venice to 19th century San Francisco, and changing the tone from satire to farce.

The play revolves around the character of the very wealthy Foxwell J. Sly, and his indentured servant Simon Able. Sly has the town duped into believing that he is dying, and four citizens vie for his inheritance. Jethro Crouch is willing to will away his son’s inheritance to Sly on the promise that he receives Sly’s money after Sly has died; Abner Truckle solicits his wife to Sly under the impression that it will sway Sly to name him as his heir; Lawyer Craven defends the dignity of Sly in court after the Captain discovers him molesting Mrs. Truckle, for the same promise of riches; Merrilee Fancy, the most popular harlot in the bay town, finds herself in the family way and hopes to marry Sly for his wealth. None of them realize the trick, and even Able, Sly’s closest confidant and student, is unable to outfox the master of deception.

It premiered on Broadway December 14, 1976 at the Broadhurst Theatre. Directed by Arthur Penn, the play featured George C. Scott, Bob Dishy, Hector Elizondo, Jack Gilford, Gretchen Wyler, and Sandra Seacat. Scott was succeeded by Robert Preston.

According to his biography at tcm.com, Jackie Gleason was touring in the lead role of &quot;Sly Fox&quot; in 1978 when he suffered a heart attack and had to permanently leave the show, undergoing a triple bypass.

The play was revived on April 1, 2004 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, again directed by Arthur Penn, featuring Richard Dreyfuss, Bob Dishy, Eric Stoltz, René Auberjonois, Professor Irwin Corey, Elizabeth Berkley, Rachel York, Peter Scolari, and Bronson Pinchot.

<doc id="975498" wikidata="Q7563204" url="?curid=975498" title="Soprano clarinet">
<text>A soprano clarinet is a clarinet that is higher in register than the basset horn or alto clarinet. The unmodified word &quot;clarinet&quot; usually refers to the B clarinet, which is by far the most common type. The term &quot;soprano&quot; also applies to the clarinets in A and C, and even the low G clarinet—rare in Western music but popular in the folk music of Turkey—which sounds a whole tone lower than the A. Some writers reserve a separate category of sopranino clarinets for the E and D clarinets, while some regarded them as soprano clarinets. All have a written range from the E below middle C to about the C three octaves above middle C, with the sounding pitches determined by the particular instrument&#x27;s transposition.

Orchestral composers largely write for soprano clarinets in B and A. Clarinets in C were used likewise from the Classical era until about 1910. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart also called for clarinets in B when writing in very sharp keys (e.g. the E major arias in &quot;Idomeneo&quot; and &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;), but this became obsolete far sooner. There have also been soprano clarinets in C, A, and B with curved barrels and bells marketed under the names Saxonette, Claribel, and Clariphon.

Shackleton lists also obsolete &quot;sopranino&quot; clarinets in (high) G, F, and E, and soprano clarinets in B and A.

==Contemporary works for clarinet in C==

* Richard Barrett: &quot;knospend-gespaltener&quot; for solo clarinet in C

<doc id="975500" wikidata="Q1357633" url="?curid=975500" title="Ceremony of the Keys (London)">
<text>The Ceremony of the Keys is an ancient ritual, held every evening at the Tower of London, when the main gates are locked for the night. It is said to be the oldest extant military ceremony in the world, and is the best-known ceremonial tradition of the Tower.

==Ceremony==
At exactly 9.52 pm, the Chief Yeoman Warder, dressed in Tudor watchcoat and bonnet, and carrying a candle lantern, leaves the Byward Tower and falls in with the Escort to the Keys, a military escort made up of armed members of the Tower of London Guard. The Warder passes his lantern to a soldier, and marches with his escort to the outer gate. The sentries on duty salute the King&#x27;s Keys as they pass.

The Warder first locks the outer gate and then the gates of the Middle and Byward Towers. The Warder and escort march down Water Lane, until they reach the Bloody Tower archway where a sentry challenges the party to identify themselves:

The Warder and escort march down to the foot of Broadwalk Steps where the main Tower Guard is drawn up to meet them. The party halts, and the officer in charge gives the command to present arms. The Chief Warder steps forward, doffs his bonnet, and proclaims:

On the answering &quot;Amen&quot;, the clock of the Waterloo Barracks strikes 10pm and the Last Post is sounded, marking the end of the ceremony.

The Guard is dismissed, and the Chief Warder takes the keys to the King&#x27;s House for safekeeping overnight.

==History==

The origins of the ceremony are unknown. It may have begun during the Middle Ages, and it is often stated that a ceremony in some form has been held since the 14th century. Written instructions that the keys should be placed in a safe place by a Tower officer, after securing the gates, date back to the 16th century. In its current form the ceremony is likely to date to the 19th century when the institution of the Yeomen Warders was reformed by the then Constable of the Tower, the Duke of Wellington.

The ceremony has never been cancelled, and has been delayed only on a single occasion due to enemy action during the Second World War.

During much of the First World War, the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) provided the Tower garrison but in 1919 after handing back the Tower Guard to the Foot Guards, the HAC&#x27;s 3rd Battalion presented a lantern to the Yeomen Warders on the 12 May 1919 as a mark of friendship during their time on duty. The lamp was used for the ceremony of the keys that night and every night ever since.

==Access==
Between 40 and 50 visitors are allowed access to the ceremony each night, under escort. Tickets are £5 and must be obtained in advance from Historic Royal Palaces, the organisation that looks after the Tower. Tickets go on sale usually on the first working day of the month, for the following month. For example, tickets for June can be purchased on the 1st of May.

Following the suspension of public visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, the ceremony was opened to the public again from 1 June 2021.

<text>Carny, also spelled carnie, is an informal term used in North America for a traveling carnival employee, and the language they use, particularly when the employee operates a game (&quot;joint&quot;), food stand (&quot;grab&quot;, &quot;popper&quot;, or &quot;floss wagon&quot;), or ride (&quot;ride jock&quot;) at a carnival. The term &quot;showie&quot; is used synonymously in Australia, while &quot;[[showman]]&quot; is used in the United Kingdom.

==Etymology==
&quot;Carny&quot; is thought to have become popularized around 1931 in North America, when it was first colloquially used to describe one who works at a carnival. The word &quot;carnival&quot;, originally meaning a &quot;time of merrymaking before Lent&quot; and referring to a time denoted by lawlessness (often ritualised under a lord of misrule figure and intended to show the consequences of social chaos), came into use around 1549.

==Carny language==
The carny vocabulary is traditionally part of carnival cant, a secret language. It is an ever-changing form of communication, in large part designed to be impossible to understand by an outsider. As words are assimilated into the culture at large, they lose their function and are replaced by more obscure or insular terms. Most carnies no longer use cant, but some owners/operators and &quot;old-timers&quot; (&quot;half yarders&quot;) still use some of the classic terms.

In addition to carny jargon, some carnival workers used a special infix (&quot;earz&quot; or &quot;eez&quot; or &quot;iz&quot;) to render regular language unintelligible to outsiders. This style eventually migrated into wrestling, hip hop, and other parts of modern culture.

The British form of fairground cant is called &quot;Rocker&quot;.

<text>In computing, the Oracle Call Interface (OCI) consists of a set of C-language software APIs which provide an interface to the Oracle database.

OCI offers a procedural API for not only performing certain database administration tasks (such as system startup and shutdown), but also for using PL/SQL or SQL to query, access, and manipulate data. The OCI library, based on Oracle&#x27;s undocumented User Programmatic Interface (UPI), acts as an &quot;interpreter&quot; between applications and the low-level database network protocol.

==History==
Oracle Corporation first released OCI (under the name HLI, the Host Language Interface) with Oracle Database version 6 in 1988. As HLI (and subsequently OCI) operated as wrappers for UPI, their original naming conventions closely resembled those of the UPI calls they were based upon. For example, the rollback statement: the call codice_1 in UPI became codice_2 in OCI.

Later, in Oracle8 (released in 1997), OCI calls acquired more descriptive names; codice_2 became codice_4. Subsequent improvements have been made in every version of OCI, including 11g (released in 2007). Oracle Corporation claims that OCI is &quot;So reliable that every SQL statement in the Oracle Database executes with OCI&quot;.

==Implementations==
OCI is so popular that, in addition to Oracle, several other vendors have implemented their own libraries compatible with the OCI API. To date, OCI-compatible libraries exist for the ANTs Data Server (ADS), EnterpriseDB, and the Linter SQL RDBMS

==OCI-based libraries==
Several libraries are based on top of OCI, including:

* Oracle&#x27;s Type-II JDBC Driver (part-Java, part native)
* Oracle&#x27;s enhanced C++ library, Oracle C++ Call Interface (OCCI), which provides an object-oriented interface with the object-relational features of the Oracle database.
* Oracle&#x27;s OLE DB Driver
* Oracle&#x27;s ODBC Driver
* Oracle&#x27;s .NET Data Provider, ODP.NET
* Microsoft&#x27;s ODBC Driver for Oracle
* Easysoft&#x27;s ODBC-Oracle Driver
* Trolltech&#x27;s Qt C++ toolkit OCI driver (QOCI)

Due to the complexity of the OCI API, several easier-to-use OCI wrapper libraries also exist, such as:

* the open-source libsqlora8 library (deprecated).
* the open-source OCILIB library.
* the Open BSD licensed Oracle Template Library OTL library.

<doc id="975516" wikidata="Q714152" url="?curid=975516" title="Xu Beihong">
<text>Xu Beihong (; 19 July 1895 – 26 September 1953), also known as Ju Péon, was a Chinese painter.

He was primarily known for his Chinese ink paintings of horses and birds and was one of the first Chinese artists to articulate the need for artistic expressions that reflected a modern China at the beginning of the 20th century. He was also regarded as one of the first to create monumental oil paintings with epic Chinese themes – a show of his high proficiency in an essential Western art technique. He was one of the four pioneers of Chinese modern art who earned the title of &quot;The Four Great Academy Presidents&quot;.

==Biography==

Xu was born on 19 July 1895 in Yixing, Jiangsu, during the late Qing dynasty. He began studying classic Chinese works, beginning with calligraphy at the age of six, and Chinese painting at the age of nine. He was taught by his father Xu Dazhang, who was a private school teacher. Xu came from rural Yixing, Jiangsu province. He started from the scratch and in the end became a well-known figure in the world due to his contributions in the art industry.

In 1915, he moved to Shanghai, where he made a living off commercial and private work. In 1916, Xu was admitted into Fudan University to learn French. He then traveled to Tokyo in 1917 to study arts. When he returned to China, he began to teach at Peking University&#x27;s Arts school at the invitation of Cai Yuanpei. Xu won a scholarship at the prestigious National High School of Art in Paris in the year 1919. He studied and travelled in Europe in more than a decade and was mainly inspired by Classic traditions of European art and culture, which helped him in incorporating improved creativity and innovation elements in his artwork.

Beginning in 1919, Xu studied overseas in Paris at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, where he studied oil painting and drawing. He was known as Ju Peon while studying in Paris. His painting has been showcased in various platforms and used by learner in understanding what transpired during the early period in relation to Chinese art industry.

His travels around Western Europe allowed him to observe and learn Western art techniques. Xu Beihong still wrote regularly for the &quot;Daily University of Peking University&quot; that dealt with wider issues then just campus politics. Xu addressed issues of Art and Art History and in 1920 a university art journal called &quot;Painting Miscellany&quot; was published.

He and his partner Jiang Biwei came back to China in 1927 and, from 1927 to 1929, he gained a number of posts at institutions in China, including teaching at National Central University (now Nanjing University) in the former capital city Nanjing.

In 1933, Xu organized an exhibition of modern Chinese painting that traveled to France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, and the Soviet Union. He studied and traveled in Europe in more than a decade and was mainly inspired by Classic traditions of European art and culture, which helped him in incorporating improved creativity and innovation elements in his artwork. 

During World War II, Xu traveled to Southeast Asia, holding exhibitions in Singapore and India. All the proceeds from these exhibitions went to Chinese people who were suffering as a result of the war.
After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, Xu became president of the Central Academy of Fine Arts and chairman of the China Artists Association.
Xu Beihong was a master of both oils and Chinese ink. Most of his works, however, were in the Chinese traditional style. Xu Beihong had a free technique of brush in his art works; he also believed that painting should be more real and should be more understood by people.

In his efforts to create a new form of national art, he combined Chinese brush and ink techniques with Western perspective and methods of composition. He integrated firm and bold brush strokes with the precise delineation of form. As an art teacher, he advocated the subordination of technique to artistic conception and emphasizes the importance of the artist&#x27;s experiences in life. Of all of the Painters of the modern era, it can be safely said that Xu is the one painter most responsible for the direction taken in the modern Chinese Art world. In the painting of Beihong in 1949 and the specific influence such has in the art as well as politics. It is evident that Xu&#x27;s art was aimed at creating a picture to the viewers to understand various events occurring in China. Nonetheless, Xu&#x27;s work could also be used in understanding not only social but also political events specifically in the New China.

The policies enacted by Xu at the beginning of the Communist Era continue to control not only official Government Policy towards the arts, but they continue to direct the overall direction taken in the various Art Colleges and Universities throughout China.

Xu enjoyed massive support from art collectors across Asia. Between 1939 and 1941, he held solo exhibitions in Singapore, India and Malaya (Penang, Kuala Lumpur and Ipoh) to help raise funds for the war relief effort in China. In one war benefit exhibition in March 1939, Xu held a group exhibition with Chinese ink painting masters Ren Bonian and Qi Baishi, and showcased 171 works of art at the Victoria Memorial Hall.

He also met Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi during his stay in India, and received inspiration which led to the creation of iconic works such as the 4.21m-wide &quot;The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains&quot; painting on show at the Singapore Art Museum (SAM). Artworks including &quot;After a Poem of the Six Dynasties&quot;, &quot;Portrait of Ms Jenny&quot; and &quot;Put Down Your Whip&quot; were also created during his sojourns in Southeast Asia. SAM Director Kwok Kian Chow mentioned that Xu&#x27;s name tops the list in Asian modern realism art, and his connections with various parts of Asia and Europe opened a new chapter of historical narratives, exchanges and influences of aesthetics and ideas in art.
Xu developed new visual art techniques and international aesthetics, in a bid to reinvent Chinese art. In fact, Xu&#x27;s influence extends beyond China in the early 20th-century. Many notable Singaporean artists including Chen Wen Hsi, Lee Man Fong and Chen Chong Swee looked up to him as a mentor and a worthy peer, sharing Xu&#x27;s desire to closely observe nature and inject realism into Chinese painting.

Xu died of a stroke in 1953. After his death, a Xu Beihong Memorial Museum was established at his home in Beijing by his wife Liao Jingwen.

=== Family feud ===
In 2008, two ceramic vases created by Xu Beihong scheduled for an art exhibition in Singapore spurred local media attention. Family disputes broke out over the vases sales and profits, which led to legal tussles between the Huang descendants and the Singapore Art Museum. The Singaporean art collectors, Huang Man Shi and Huang Meng Gui, were famously supportive of Xu Beihong. The 18-cm high vases were made in the 1940s, titled &quot;Malay Dancers&quot; and &quot;Orchid&quot; were to be shown in a Jack Bonn curated exhibition in collaboration with the Singapore Art Museum, &quot;Xu Beihong in Nanyang&quot;, as an attribution to the late grandfather and granduncle for the periods when Xu was a guest at his grandfather&#x27;s estate. These items were returned as certain family members&#x27; feud led to the eventual auction failure and cancellation. The Museum maintained they were unaware of the legal implications surrounding the artifacts. Members of the Huang family adheres to the artifacts returning to the &quot;original owners&quot;, in 2009.

=== Controversy ===
Xu&#x27;s son, Xu Boyang, signed an affidavit that a nude portrait that had been found was of his mother Jiang Biwei. The painting was then sold for approximately $11m in 2010 at Beijing Jiuge Auctions. After the sale it was claimed that the painting was not by Xu Beihong but it was a piece created in 1983 by a student at the Central Academy of Fine Arts.

==Gallery==
==Personal life==
Xu Beihong went to Japan to study arts in 1917. Jiang Biwei, who was already engaged to another man, went with him to Japan without the consent of her family. Her family said that she had died to cover their embarrassment. In 1927, Xu Beihong and Jiang Biwei had a son and a daughter. Three years later, Xu Beihong had a love affair with his student Sun Duoci. The affair ended with Jiang Biwei&#x27;s intervention, but the damage to their marriage was done. This account is questioned in a biography written by Xu Beihong&#x27;s later wife - Liao Jingwen states that there was no improper relationship between Xu Beihong and the student. It goes on to describe how Jiang Biwei was having an affair herself with the married official Zhang Daofan. It was Zhang who suggested Xu had been having an improper relationship in order to further drive a wedge between the couple. However, finally their 20-year painful relationship ended with a divorce in 1945. In 1942, Xu Beihong took Liao Jingwen, a librarian who took care of his life, as his mistress, they married in 1946 until he died in 1953. They had a son and a daughter.

==Other media==
A 24-episode historic television series depicting Xu&#x27;s life from early adulthood until 1949 was produced in Hebei and aired in Chinese television in 2013.

<doc id="975517" wikidata="Q1812326" url="?curid=975517" title="German legal citation">
<text>As in most countries, Germany has a standard way of citing its legal codes and case law; an essentially identical system of citation is also used in Austria.

There is, however, no authoritative citation style similar in importance to the &quot;Bluebook&quot; (in the United States) or OSCOLA (in the United Kingdom). Legal journals use self-made &quot;house&quot; citation styles, and the most influential style guide probably are the &quot;Author&#x27;s Instructions&quot; of the Neue Juristische Wochenschrift, arguably the most important legal journal in Germany.

==Citing portions of the German legal code==
As an example, the famous or notorious Paragraph 175, which formerly made male homosexuality a crime in Germany, would most properly be cited in an English-language text as &quot;§ 175 StGB (Germany)&quot;. &quot;§&quot; simply denotes &quot;paragraph&quot; (and can be pluralized as &quot;§§&quot;). &quot;StGB&quot; stands for &quot;Strafgesetzbuch&quot; (penal code); other similar usages would be &quot;BGB&quot; (&quot;Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch&quot;, the Civil Code) and &quot;ZPO&quot; (&quot;Zivilprozessordnung&quot;, the Civil Procedure Code). Paragraphs with the same number from these different codes are completely unrelated; thus, § 175 ZPO has nothing to do with § 175 StGB.

Finally, unless the context is clear, &quot;(Germany)&quot; may be added to distinguish this from the similar system of citation for Austria; again, paragraphs with the same number in German and Austrian legal codes are unrelated, except in laws that were introduced in Austria with the Anschluss in 1938, such as the AktG (Stock Corporations Act), which, of course, has frequently been amended in different ways in both countries since then. A method that is sometimes employed in Austrian legal writing to distinguish between Austrian and German law is to add a lower case &quot;d&quot; for Germany () and an &quot;ö&quot; for Austria () before the abbreviation of the respective code, e.g. &quot;dAktG&quot; and &quot;öAktG&quot; referring to the German and Austrian stock corporations acts.

Within such a paragraph, there may be numerous &quot;Absätze&quot; (singular &quot;Absatz&quot;, i.e. &quot;passages&quot;, &quot;sections&quot;). The &quot;Absätze&quot; are cited as &quot;Abs.&quot;. Thus, a particular portion of Paragraph 175 might be cited as &quot;§ 175 Abs. 2 StGB (Germany)&quot;. Texts addressed at a purely legal audience commonly make use of an informal shorthand, abbreviating &quot;Absätze&quot; for example as Roman numerals. Thus, in such texts, this same provision might be cited simply as &quot;§ 175 II StGB&quot; or even &quot;§ 175 II&quot; depending on the amount of available context. In Austria, the &quot;Absätze&quot; are usually cited as &quot;Abs&quot; (without a dot), e.g. &quot;§ 1295 Abs 2 ABGB&quot;. Occasionally parentheses are used instead, e.g. &quot;§ 1295 (2) ABGB. Numbered lists are cited with a capital &quot;Z&quot; (standing for &quot;Ziffer&quot; i.e. number), e.g. &quot;§ 73 Abs 1 Z 4 BWG&quot;. By contrast, in Germany, the abbreviation &quot;Nr.&quot; (standing for &quot;Nummer&quot; i.e. number) is used instead.

In non-legal contexts, for example in text formatting, the word &quot;Absatz&quot; would normally be equivalent to English &quot;paragraph&quot;, but in legal usage an &quot;Absatz&quot; is a subdivision of a &quot;Paragraph&quot;; we must either use the German word or translate it as &quot;sub-paragraph&quot;. 

The Basic Law (constitution) of Germany is divided into &quot;Artikel&quot; or articles, not sections. To cite the Basic Law a notation like &quot;Artikel 1 GG&quot; or &quot;Art. 1 GG&quot;, where GG stands for &quot;Grundgesetz&quot;, basic law, is used.

==Citing German case law==
The &quot;Entscheidungen des Bundesgerichtshofs in Strafsachen&quot; (cited as &quot;BGHSt&quot;) covers criminal case law in the present-day Federal Republic of Germany that was decided by the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof). Case law from German unification (1871) until 1945, decided by the Empire Court of Justice (Reichsgericht), would be in the &quot;Entscheidungen des Reichsgerichts in Strafsachen&quot; (cited as &quot;RGSt&quot;). Similarly, decisions in private law can be found in the &quot;Entscheidungen des Bundesgerichtshofs in Zivilsachen&quot; (&quot;BGHZ&quot;) and &quot;Entscheidungen des Reichsgerichts in Zivilsachen&quot; (&quot;RGZ&quot;). E.g. &quot;BGHZ 65, 182&quot; would refer to a case published in BGHZ, volume 65, beginning at page 182.

Alternatively, cases may be cited to law reviews where they have been rendered, e.g. &quot;BGH, NJW 1982, 473&quot;. Ideally, the date of the court decision and the docket number should be given before the citation, but whether this is required usually depends on the publisher. 

A third type (yet not too widely spread) is the citation by using the European Case Law Identifier, a ″neutral″ citation system introduced by the Council of the European Union in 2011, which Germany is participating in.

It is not general practice to cite case names, since the names of parties are anonymized. However, in some areas of law (e.g. corporate law), where the name of a party (usually the company involved in the case) is generally known, some cases have gained notoriety under that name (e.g. the &quot;Holzmüller&quot; decision). Other cases, especially in criminal law, have become known under names emphasising the peculiar story that made them notorious, such as the or the . In such cases, it may be helpful for readers to render that name, even though it is entirely optional and such case names are not official.

==Austrian case law==
Similar rules apply to Austrian case law. Decisions by the Supreme Court (&quot;Oberster Gerichtshof&quot;) can be cited to the official collections (SZ for private law and SSt for criminal law) or to law reviews. In the case of the official collections, other than in Germany, the cite normally does not refer to the page number, but to the number of the case, e.g. SZ 82/123 (referring to case number 123 in volume 82 of the official collection of private law cases).

<text>Extol is an extreme metal band from Bekkestua, Norway, that was formed in 1993. The band is known for playing a variety of different styles of metal which include progressive metal, Christian death metal, black metal and thrash metal.

Over the course of their career, the band has released five studio albums and two EPs, beginning with their debut, &quot;Burial&quot;, in 1998. The band are noted for their precise, technical musicianship. The fourth album, &quot;The Blueprint Dives&quot;, received a Spellemannsprisen nomination for Best Metal Album of 2005. Extol has toured the United States and Europe several times with such bands as Mastodon, God Forbid and Opeth. Collectively, Extol has sold over 500,000 albums worldwide.

The last line-up before the hiatus included vocalist Peter Espevoll, guitarists Tor Magne Glidje and Ole Halvard Sveen, drummer David Husvik, and bass player John Robert Mjåland. Notable original guitarists were Ole Børud (of Schaliach fame) and Christer Espevoll, who contributed significantly to the band&#x27;s songwriting. After reforming in 2012, the band consisted of Peter Espevoll, Husvik, and Børud. The band released its fifth album, &quot;Extol&quot;, in 2013. The band was again on hiatus from 2017 until 2023. The band reformed again in 2023 with Peter and Christer Espevoll, David Husvik, and Ole Børud. In addition to touring live in 2023, with Elisha Mullins as a live vocalist, the band released two singles in 2024. In 2024, Bruce Fitzhugh served as a live vocalist for touring the United States.

== History ==
===1993–1999: Formation and &quot;Burial&quot;===
Extol was formed in Bekkestua, Norway by cousins drummer David Husvik and guitarist Christer Espevoll, who were both 16 at the time. The two had jammed together since fall 1993 and wanted to start a band. Christer&#x27;s brother Peter, 14 was recruited for vocal duties. Bassist Eystein Holm joined on 17 May 1994 as the band was rehearsing for a show that day. In an interview, Peter explained the band&#x27;s name: &quot;Extol means to exalt, to lift up what you give glory to, and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s we&#x27;re all about. We want to give God all the glory with our lives and with our music.&quot; Extol wanted to expand their musical style beyond regular heavy metal music—according to AllMusic writer Mike DaRonco, the band intended to show &quot;more of a progressive side; rather than a typical run of the mill group of burnouts who focused more on their image.&quot; The style change necessitated another guitarist, a position Emil Nikolaisen of the band Royal filled in 1995.

The group soon garnered a reputation in the local scene. In January 1996, Extol made their first record appearance on a Norwegian metal compilation called &quot;Northern Lights&quot;. The album featured other local Christian artists Antestor, Schaliach, and Groms. Steve Rowe of Australian Christian metal band Mortification released the compilation on his record label, Rowe Productions. The band ventured to Stockholm, Sweden two months later for their first show outside their homeland. At the end of 1996, Nikolaisen departed so he could devote more time to Royal, and was replaced by Ole Børud of Schaliach and Arnold B Family.

In 1997, Extol released an independent three-song demo: &quot;Embraced&quot;. A studio album was recorded at the end of the year even though a record label had not signed them. Almost a year passed before Endtime Productions picked up the band. Their debut album, &quot;Burial&quot;, was released in December 1998. The album was licensed in the United States on Solid State Records, and in Japan on Avalon Records. Critical reception was very positive from Christian and secular publications. DaRonco commented that it was &quot;a breath of fresh air among a genre that relies on satanic gimmicks.&quot;

Shortly after, the band played their first shows in the US at Cornerstone Festival and Texas Rockfest. Extol conducted a four-week tour with Swedish rock band Blindside in summer 1999. An EP, &quot;Mesmerized&quot;, was released in November. It featured three remixed tracks from &quot;Burial&quot;, which were reworked by Swedish industrial groups Raison d&#x27;être and Sanctum, and three other songs; a recently recorded one, an outtake, and a track from the Japanese release. The reception from fans was generally negative. Holm soon left the band and was replaced by Tor Magne Glidje, who played guitar in the Norwegian metal band Lengsel.

===2000–2003: &quot;Undeceived&quot; and &quot;Synergy&quot;===
Extol returned to the studio in December 1999 to record a follow-up album. In June 2000, their second studio album, &quot;Undeceived&quot;, was released. The release saw their music become &quot;harder and darker&quot; than their previous work, opting to move towards a death metal sound. The song &quot;Ember&quot; proved to be a popular song among their fans. Børud then left the band, so Glidje switched over to guitar, and John Robert Mjåland joined as bassist.

In 2001, another EP, &quot;Paralysis&quot;, was recorded; it was only released in Sweden. This EP featured a cover of &quot;Shadow of Death&quot; by the American thrash metal group Believer, whom the band considers to be a great influence. After &quot;Paralysis&quot;, Glidje left the band to focus on his other project, Ganglion, and Børud returned to the line-up. After &quot;Undeceived&quot; was released, Extol was no longer obligated to Endtime Productions, and they signed with Century Media in 2002. Their album, &quot;Synergy&quot;, released in 2003, showed an even greater appreciation of the band Believer and their style of thrash metal. Following the release, Extol toured Europe and US with the Swedish progressive death metal group Opeth.

===2004–2008: &quot;The Blueprint Dives&quot; and hiatus===
In June 2004, Børud and Christer Espevoll left Extol to &quot;invest their time and energy elsewhere&quot;. Taking their place as permanent members in the band were Tor Magne Glidje and Ole Halvard Sveen, both from Ganglion, which merged with Extol when four out of five band members ended up playing in both bands.

In 2005, the band released what could be considered their most diverse album, &quot;The Blueprint Dives&quot;. A music video was shot for the song &quot;Pearl&quot;. The album was nominated for the Norwegian Grammy, Spellemannprisen, for best Norwegian metal album in 2005. The album was voted among the top five metal albums of the year by readers of Norway&#x27;s largest newspaper, &quot;Dagbladet&quot;. Afterwards, Extol toured Europe with Mastodon, God Forbid, and Opeth, and the US with Winter Solstice, Becoming the Archetype, and The Showdown. The album received rave reviews: Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic gave the album 4.5/5 and writes that &quot;to Extol&#x27;s greatest credit, offhand comparisons to other bands are almost impossible!&quot; According to Glidje, a majority of the songs on &quot;The Blueprint Dives&quot; had previously been written as Ganglion songs.

On 9 August 2007 the band announced through their MySpace page that they were taking a hiatus. Glidje, Mjåland and Sveen went on to form Mantric, signed to Prosthetic Records. Husvik joined Dr. Midnight and the Mercy Cult, which includes members from Turbonegro, Apoptygma Berzerk and Satyricon.

===2012–present: Documentary, &quot;Extol&quot;, hiatus and reunion===
In 2012, Extol reformed as a trio consisting of Peter Espevoll, Husvik, and Børud, and announced that a documentary about the band, titled &quot;Extol: of Light and Shade&quot;, was being produced. On 23 April 2013, Extol announced that their fifth album, &quot;Extol&quot;, was to be released in June. Upon this announcement, the single &quot;Open the Gates&quot; was released for streaming on YouTube. Indie Recordings released the album on 21 June in Norway, Germany, and Austria, and on 24 June worldwide. Facedown Records released the album on 25 June for North America. The album debuted at No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Christian Albums chart. In July 2014, the band performed their first live concert since 2006. On 17 July, they introduced the names of the additional two touring members: Marcus Bertilsson (Inevitable End, Miseration) on guitar and Ole Vistnes (Shining, Tristania, Fleshkiller) on bass. The documentary was later released. The band made it onto a list of the top 20 best Norwegian progressive metal bands in 2017. The band went on hiatus until 2023. During the hiatus, Espevoll quit the band due to other commitments, leaving Husvik and Børud as sole members. Husvik went on to play in a project called Azusa with Christer Espevoll, one of the original members, while Børud went on to perform in Fleshkiller.

On January 18, 2023, Extol announced a reunion for Furnace Fest of 2023, hosted in Alabama, alongside additional reunited acts A Plea for Purging, Training for Utopia, Haste the Day and Becoming the Archetype. Unfortunately, citing visa issues, they were forced to withdraw less than a week before the event. Shortly after, it was announced Extol would also do a European reunion show for Brainstorm Festival on November 4, 2023, in Apeldoorn, The Netherlands, alongside acts like Xandria, Serenity, Temperance and In Vain. With the announcements, they released the band&#x27;s live lineup consisting of Husvik, Børud, Christer Espevoll, Tor Magne Glidje, and vocalist Elisha Mullins (A Hill to Die Upon, War of Ages, Fleshkiller). The band expressed their want for Peter to return but that he had other commitments. They also teased new music with Peter on August 10. On September 6, 2024 Furnace Fest announced Extol would be playing at the fest in 2024 and visas had already been secured.

==Influences==
During the early 2000s, the band cited influence from Believer, Death, Galactic Cowboys, Meshuggah, early Mortification, Rush, and early Tourniquet. Christer Espevoll stated in an interview that the primary influences for his guitar playing were bandmates Emil Nikolaisen and Ole Børud. In an interview after the release of 2005&#x27;s &quot;The Blueprint Dives&quot;, the band cited influences from A-ha, Anathema, Believer, Nick Cave, The Crucified, The Cure, Cynic, Death, Faith No More, Kings X, Metallica, Joni Mitchell, Refused, Sixteen Horsepower, Tool, and Tourniquet, among others. After the reformation of the band in 2012, Børud stated in one interview that his influences range &quot;from Death to Yes to Steely Dan to Jason Falkner and so forth.&quot; In another interview, he cited the band&#x27;s influences as &quot;old stuff such as Rush, Genesis or Yes. But it could as easily be an old church hymn or a jazz tune from Chris Potter. Or it might even be just a mood from a certain day that will trigger a certain melody. As far as groove and beat goes we are all fans of the old school death metal approach such as old Death, Pestilence and all of those guys.&quot;

<text>Weston Woollard Adams (August 9, 1904 – March 19, 1973) was an American hockey executive with the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League. He is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Adams was born in Springfield, Massachusetts. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy and graduated from Harvard where he played Goaltender on the varsity team.

==Boston Bruins==

===Early experience===
In 1924, Adam&#x27;s father, Charles Adams, founded the Boston Bruins. Although he was still a student at the time, Adams was very involved with the team. In 1932 he became president of the Canadian American Hockey League farm team, the Boston Tigers. His ability to recognize talent was invaluable to the growth of the Bruins&#x27; player development system.

===First tenure as president===
In 1936, Adams became majority owner and team president of the Bruins when his father transferred his stock to him, Art Ross, and Ralph Burkard. While Adams was president of the Bruins, the team finished first in the NHL American Division from 1937–38 season to the 1940–41 regular season. They won the Stanley Cup in 1939, and 1941. During his tenure as president Adams remained involved in the player development process, monitoring the progress of players with the Tigers and the Providence Reds of the American Hockey League.

During World War II, Adams served the United States Navy from January 1942 to May 1946, eventually working his way up to the rank of commander. He served in both the Atlantic and Pacific, mostly on escort and convoy duty.

===Sale of team===
In 1951 the Boston Garden-Arena Corporation purchased controlling interest in the team. Adams remained a major stockholder in the Garden-Arena Corporation and he became its chairman in 1951. The team&#x27;s struggled during the first few seasons under the Garden-Arena Corporation, until Adams took on a more proactive role in player procurement.

===Second tenure as president===
Adams was again named president of the Bruins after Walter A. Brown&#x27;s death in 1964. Upon regaining control of the team, Adams worked to rebuild Boston&#x27;s farm system. He fostered strong working relationships with powerful junior clubs, including the Niagara Falls Flyers and the Estevan Bruins, which could develop and supply players. Adams logged many hours traveling across Canada to scout players. Over the next few years, he brought in such players as Bobby Orr, Wayne Cashman, Dallas Smith, Don Awrey, Don Marcotte, Derek Sanderson and Eddie Westfall. He also developed the concept of the sixth attacker and secured the relationship with the AHL&#x27;s Boston Braves due to the AHL&#x27;s loss of many players to the expanding NHL.

On March 31, 1969, he was succeeded as team president by his son, Weston Adams, Jr. He remained on as chairman of the board until 1973. Boston would win 2 more Stanley Cups in 1970, and 1972.

Weston was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as an Honoured Builder in 1972.

==Other teams==
In addition to the Bruins, Adams owned the Boston Braves, Oshawa Generals, Boston Rovers, a horse racing stable, and was a member of the Suffolk Downs board of directors. He also served as travelling secretary of the Boston Braves baseball club.

==Boston Stock Exchange==
Adams was a member of the Boston Stock Exchange from 1929 to 1969. From 1938 to 1942 and from 1962 to 1969 he was a member of the BSE&#x27;s board of directors. From 1953 to 1962 he served as its vice president. He then served as president of the exchange from 1962 to 1963.

==Personal life and death==
On January 8, 1933, Adams married Mildred Culver Boyd of Lansdowne, Pennsylvania. The couple had two children. They divorced in 1936. On September 26, 1936, he married Nancy E. (Atkins) Gordon, ex-wife of playwright Leon Gordon. Adams had two children with her.

Adams died on March 19, 1973, at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts.

<text>Rodion Yakovlevich Malinovsky (; ; – 31 March 1967) was a Soviet military commander and Marshal of the Soviet Union. He served as Minister of Defence of the Soviet Union from 1957 to 1967, during which he oversaw the strengthening of the Soviet Army.

Born to an impoverished Ukrainian household in Odessa, Malinovsky volunteered for the Imperial Russian Army during the First World War and served with distinction in both the German Front and the Western Front. He was serving in the Russian Legion in France on the outbreak of the October Revolution, after which he returned to Russia and joined the Red Army in the Russian Civil War. After graduating from the Frunze Military Academy, Malinovsky volunteered to fight on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War, where he again served with great distinction and was later awarded the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner in recognition of his service.

Malinovsky emerged as one of the few competent Soviet generals in the opening phase of the German invasion. He played a crucial role in the Soviet victory at Stalingrad in December 1942, and helped drive German troops out of Ukraine following the Dnieper–Carpathian offensive. He then commanded the Soviet drive into the Balkans, forcing Romania to switch to the Allies side, for which he was made a Marshal of the Soviet Union by Joseph Stalin. He further took part in the liberation of Budapest, Vienna and Prague, cementing Soviet military supremacy in Central Europe. After the German surrender in May 1945, Malinovsky was transferred to the Far East, where he crushed the Japanese Kwantung Army in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. He received the Soviet Union&#x27;s highest distinction, the title Hero of the Soviet Union, as a reward.

After the war, Malinovsky remained in the Far East and held a succession of important commands. After Stalin&#x27;s death, Nikita Khrushchev recalled Malinovsky to Moscow and named him commander-in-chief of the Soviet Ground Forces. In 1957, he replaced the ousted Georgy Zhukov as Minister of Defence, a position he served until his death. Malinovsky was a strong advocate for the importance of conventional forces, and maintained a delicate balance with Khrushchev&#x27;s missile-based approach regarding Soviet military policy. He retained considerable autonomy in military affairs following the fall of Khrushchev in 1964. Malinovsky died in March 1967 from pancreatic cancer, and is remembered as one of the most important military leaders in Russian and Soviet history.

==Early life==

===Before and during World War I===
A Ukrainian, Malinovsky was born in Odessa to a single mother, after the death, or the home abandoning, of his father. The ethnic background of his father is disputed. Some claim he was a Karaite Jew, however others claim he was descended from a noble family in the Tambov Governorate. Malinovsky&#x27;s mother soon left the city for the rural areas of Southern Russia, and married. Her husband, a poverty-stricken peasant, refused to adopt her son and expelled him when Malinovsky was only 13 years old. The homeless boy survived by working as a farmhand, and eventually received shelter from his aunt&#x27;s family in Odessa, where he worked as an errand boy in a general store.
After the start of World War I in July 1914, Malinovsky, who was only 15 years old at the time (too young for military service), hid on the military train heading for the German front, but was discovered. He nevertheless convinced the commanding officers to enlist him as a volunteer, and served in a machine-gun detachment in the frontline trenches. In October 1915, as a reward for repelling a German attack, he received his first military award, the Cross of St. George of the 4th class, and was promoted to the rank of corporal. Soon afterwards, he was badly wounded and spent several months in the hospital.
After his recovery, he was sent to France in 1916 as a member of the Western Front Russian Expeditionary Corps. Malinovsky fought in a hotly contested sector of the front near Fort Brion and was promoted to sergeant. He suffered a serious wound in his left arm, and received a decoration from the French government. After the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, the French government disbanded some Russian units, but others were transferred to a newly created unit called the Russian Legion, which was attached to the Moroccan Division. Malinovsky fought against the Germans until the end of the war. During this time, he was awarded the French Croix de guerre and promoted to senior NCO.

===Interwar===
He returned to Odessa in 1919, where he joined the Red Army in the Civil War against the White Army and fought with distinction in Siberia. He remained in the army after the end of the conflict, studying in the training school for the junior commanders, and rose to commander of a rifle battalion. In 1926, he became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, membership of which was a prerequisite for promotion in the military.

In 1927, Malinovsky was sent to study at the elite Frunze Military Academy. He graduated in 1930, and during the next seven years he rose to the Chief of Staff of the 3rd Cavalry Corps, where his commander was Semyon Timoshenko (a protégé of Joseph Stalin).
After the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Malinovsky volunteered to fight for the Republicans against the right-wing nationalists of General Francisco Franco and their Italian and German allies. He participated in planning and directing several main operations. In 1938, he returned to Moscow, being awarded the top Soviet decorations, the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner, in recognition of his service in Spain; he was appointed a senior lecturer at the Frunze Military Academy.

In the spring of 1941, Timoshenko, who then served the People&#x27;s Commissar for Defence, was alarmed by the massive German military buildup on the Soviet borders, as the Wehrmacht was secretly preparing for Operation Barbarossa. In order to strengthen the Red Army field command, he dispatched some of the top officers from the military academies to the field units. Malinovsky was promoted to Major General, and took command over the freshly raised 48th Rifle Corps, 9th Army in the Odessa Military District. A week prior to the start of the war, Malinovsky deployed his corps close to the Romanian border.

==World War II==

===Early assignments===
After Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, with the Red Army suffering enormous defeats and losing hundreds of thousands of troops in German encirclements, Malinovsky emerged a competent general. His corps of three partly formed rifle divisions faced German Blitzkrieg along the line of the Prut River. While, as a rule, Red Army generals would lead their forces from behind the frontline, Malinovsky went to the crucial sectors of the battles to be with his soldiers and encourage them. Unable to stop the Wehrmacht, Malinovsky had to retreat along the Black Sea shore, while frustrating enemy attempts to encircle his troops. The Germans succeeded in cornering his corps in Nikolaev, but Malinovsky breached their ring and retreated to Dnipropetrovsk.

In August, he was promoted to Chief of Staff of the badly battered 6th Army, and soon replaced its commander. He halted the German advance in his section of the front and was promoted to Lieutenant General. After the retreat of the Red Army to the Donbas, Malinovsky commanded a joint operation of the 6th and 12th armies, managing to drive the Wehrmacht out of the region. In December 1941, Malinovsky received command of the Southern Front, consisting of three weak field armies and two division-sized cavalry corps. They were short of manpower and equipment, but Malinovsky managed to push deep into the defenses of the Germans, who, after 6 months of fighting, were suffering from fatigue and shortages as well.

===Battle of Kharkov===
On 12 May 1942, Malinovsky and the Southwestern Front, under the overall command of Timoshenko, launched a joint attack in the Second Battle of Kharkov pushing the Germans back . Timoshenko overestimated the Red Army&#x27;s offensive capabilities and suffered a heavy defeat. Although Stalin, in spite of opposition by his top military advisers, supported the ill-fated Kharkov attack, he became suspicious that Malinovsky had intentionally failed his troops (he feared that Malinovsky had established and kept connections with foreign interests during his World War I stay in France). In July 1942, the Southern Front was taken out of combat, its units and staff were transferred to the North Caucasian Front as a Don Operational Group under the command of Malinovsky (who also became Front&#x27;s deputy commander). Stalin ordered Malinovsky to stop the intrusion of the German Army Group A towards Rostov-on-Don and the vital oilfields of Caucasus; the Germans had a sizeable technical superiority over Malinovsky, and cut through his weak defenses. As a consequence, Stavka disbanded the Don Operational Group in September.

===Stalingrad and Ukrainian Front===
The Red Army was hard-pressed by Germans in the Battle of Stalingrad, and Stalin entrusted Malinovsky with the command of the hastily formed 66th Army to hold positions north-east of Stalingrad. At the same time Stalin ordered Nikita Khrushchev, who served as his top political officer in Stalingrad, to &quot;keep an eye&quot; on Malinovsky.

The 66th Army had no combat experience, but this was the first time in the war Malinovsky had commanded a unit that was near full strength in both troops and equipment. In September and October 1942, he went on the offensive. His territorial gains were marginal, but he denied the Germans an opportunity to encircle Stalingrad from the north, and, slowed down, they decided to push into the city. Later that month, Stavka dispatched Malinovsky to the Voronezh Front as its deputy commander; in December 1942, he was sent back to Stalingrad. There the Red Army achieved its greatest success to that point in the war: on 22 November the Red Army fronts encircled the German Sixth Army. The German Army Group Don, commanded by Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, gathered its Panzer troops in the town of Kotelnikovo west of Stalingrad and launched a desperate counterattack to save the Sixth Army.

Malinovsky led the powerful Soviet Second Guards Army against Hoth. In vicious fighting he forced the Germans to retreat, breached deeply echeloned and well-prepared German defenses, and destroyed the Kotelnikovo army grouping. It was the first World War II large-scale clash of armor to be lost by Germany. Malinovsky&#x27;s victory sealed the fate of 250,000 German and other Axis Powers soldiers trapped in the Stalingrad pocket. Stalin promoted Malinovsky to colonel general, and awarded him with the highest Soviet decoration for outstanding generalship — the Order of Suvorov of the 1st degree.

In February 1943, Malinovsky resumed his command of Southern Front, and in less than two weeks he expelled Manstein from Rostov-on-Don, opening the road to Ukraine to the Red Army. In March 1943, Stalin elevated him to rank of Army General and gave him command of Southwestern Front, tasked to drive German troops away from the industrially rich Donbas. Through a sudden attack in mid-October, Malinovsky managed to surprise a large German force in the region&#x27;s key city of Zaporizhia and captured it. The campaign split German forces in the South and isolated German forces in Crimea from the rest of the German Eastern Front.

On 20 October, the Southwestern Front was renamed 3rd Ukrainian Front. From December 1943 to April 1944, Malinovsky smashed the German Army Group South, and liberated much of the southern Ukraine, including Kherson, Nikolaev and his home city of Odessa. By that time, according to Khrushchev&#x27;s opinion, Stalin grew much more confident of Malinovsky&#x27;s loyalty.

===Romania and Hungary===

In May 1944, Malinovsky was transferred to the 2nd Ukrainian Front. He expelled the Germans from the remaining Soviet territory and participated in an unsuccessful invasion of the Balkans (the first Jassy–Kishinev Offensive) together with Marshal Ivan Konev and Army General Fyodor Tolbukhin (who received Malinovsky&#x27;s former command over the smaller 3rd Ukrainian Front). However, during the second Jassy–Kishinev Offensive in late August and early September 1944, Malinovsky unleashed a highly successful Soviet version of the Blitzkrieg. Together with Tolbukhin, he destroyed or captured some 215,000 German, and 200,000 Romanian troops, forcing Romania to overthrow pro-German &quot;Conducător&quot; Ion Antonescu, and switch from the Axis to the Allies camp (&quot;see Romania during World War II&quot;). A triumphant Stalin recalled Malinovsky to Moscow, and on 10 September 1944 made him Marshal of the Soviet Union. Malinovsky was also nominal head of the Allied Commission in Romania (represented by Vladislav Petrovich Vinogradov).

He continued his offensive drive, crossed the Southern Carpathians into Transylvania (entering Hungarian-ruled Northern Transylvania), and on 20 October 1944, captured Debrecen, defended by a large Axis force. His troops were tired after several months of combat and needed to be replenished and resupplied, but Stalin ordered Malinovsky to take the Hungarian capital Budapest, in order to open the road to Vienna and take Vienna before the Western Allies. With the help of Tolbukhin and the Romanian First and Fourth armies, Malinovsky carried out Stalin&#x27;s order, and faced Adolf Hitler&#x27;s determination to defend Budapest at any cost. The Germans and their Hungarian Arrow Cross Party allies tried to turn Budapest into a &quot;German Stalingrad&quot;; Hitler engaged the bulk of his Panzer troops (among them six Waffen SS divisions and five army Panzer divisions; one-fourth of the Wehrmacht&#x27;s armor), weakening German forces fighting the Red Army in Poland and Prussia, as well as those engaging the Western Allies on the Rhine. Malinovsky&#x27;s strategic and operational skills enabled him to overcome his troops&#x27; weakness and to conquer Budapest on 13 February 1945, following an exceptionally harsh battle. He captured 70,000 prisoners. Continuing his drive westward, Malinovsky routed Germans in Slovakia, liberated Bratislava, on 4 April 1945 captured Vienna, and finally, on 26 April 1945 freed Brno, second largest city in Czechoslovakia.

These new victories established the Soviet&#x27;s supremacy over the Danubian heartland of Europe. In return, Stalin rewarded him with the highest Soviet military decoration of the period, the Order of Victory. Malinovsky ended his campaign in Europe with the liberation of Brno in the Czech lands, observing a jubilant meeting of his and American advance forces.

===Japanese Front and Far East Command===
After the German surrender in May 1945, Malinovsky was transferred to the Russian Far East, where he was placed in command of the Transbaikal Front. In August 1945, he led his forces during the last Soviet offensive of the war under the overall command of Aleksandr Vasilevsky. Vasilevsky&#x27;s forces invaded Manchuria, which was under the occupation of the 700,000 strong Japanese Kwantung Army and crushed the Japanese in ten days. Malinovsky was awarded the Soviet Union&#x27;s greatest honor, the order of a Hero of the Soviet Union, and was appointed a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union by Stalin himself. Following the Japanese surrender, Malinovsky was made supreme commander of the Far Eastern Military District. During the Soviet occupation of North Korea, Malinovsky was an influential figure in the establishment and training of the Korean People&#x27;s Army, and continued to provide support for them during the early phases of the Korean War.

== Minister of Defence ==

After Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, Khrushchev became the Soviet leader and, during the De-Stalinization process and the consolidation of his power in the Kremlin, he promoted Malinovsky to Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Ground Forces and First Deputy to Minister of Defense Marshal Georgy Zhukov. To confirm Malinovsky&#x27;s high status in the Soviet Party-state hierarchy, he was selected a full member of the Communist Party Central Committee. In October 1957, Khrushchev, who had grown apprehensive of Zhukov&#x27;s political ambitions, ousted him and entrusted his post as minister to Malinovsky, who served in this position until his death.Although a personal friend of Khrushchev, Malinovsky maintained his independent position regarding military affairs. Khrushchev and several members of the Soviet military establishment were convinced that future wars would be won by nuclear missile attack. They advocated main investment to the development of the missiles and a drastic reduction of conventional forces. Malinovsky supported the adoption of strategic nuclear missiles, but saw them as a useful deterrent of war, rather than as a main weapon within it. He developed the concept of a broad based military and vigorously argued that while the nature of war had changed, the decisive factor would still be a standing army proficient in modern military technology and capable of conquering and controlling the enemy&#x27;s territory. Soviet military policy during these years was a compromise between the views of Malinovsky and of Khrushchev.

The Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the world to the brink of nuclear catastrophe, alienated Malinovsky. Following the crisis, he publicly demanded in army publications for the military to be given a greater say in formulating Soviet strategic policy. The army&#x27;s discontent with Khrushchev encouraged a coup within the Party, which resulted in the removal of Khrushchev from power in October 1964. The new Party leadership accepted Malinovsky&#x27;s demand for an autonomous and professional military establishment, as well as his concept of balanced development of the armed forces. In a meeting in Romania in the next month, between USSR and Chinese delegations, Malinovsky worsened Sino-Soviet relations, already deeply frayed in the Sino-Soviet split. Historian Daniel Leese noted that improvement of the relations &quot;that had seemed possible after Khrushchev&#x27;s fall evaporated&quot; as they became more elusive after an allegedly drunken Malinovsky approached Chinese Marshal He Long, member of the Chinese delegation to Moscow, and asked when China would finally eliminate Mao Zedong in the manner in which the CPSU eliminated Khrushchev, &quot;we‘ve already got rid of Khrushchev, you should get rid of Mao Zedong.&quot; Outraged, He Long reported the incident to Premier of China Zhou Enlai, who in turn, reported the incident to Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev. China refused to accept the Soviet Union&#x27;s apology.

Malinovsky was a staunch opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, accusing the Americans of waging a &quot;murderous war against the Vietnamese people&quot;. In response to escalating U.S. aggression, Malinovsky called for a major Soviet military buildup. He also criticized China&#x27;s involvement in the war, accusing the Chinese government of obstructing Soviet aid to North Vietnam.

== Death and legacy ==
Malinovsky died from pancreatic cancer on 31 March 1967. He was honoured with a state funeral and cremated. His urn was placed in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. The government gave his name to the leading Soviet Military Academy of Tank Troops in Moscow and to the 10th Guards Uralsko-Lvovskaya Tank Division. Malinovsky continued to be regarded as one of the most important military leaders in the history of Russia even after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

<text>An extra attacker in ice hockey, ringette, and box lacrosse is a forward or, less commonly, a defenceman who has been substituted in place of the goaltender. The purpose of this substitution is to gain an offensive advantage to score a goal. The removal of the goaltender for an extra attacker is colloquially called &quot;pulling the goalie&quot;, resulting in an empty net. This article deals chiefly with situations which apply to the sport of ice hockey.

==Ice hockey==
The extra attacker is typically utilized in two situations:
*Near the end of the game—typically the last 60 to 90 seconds—when a team is losing by one or two goals (especially when opponent team is short-handed). In this case, the team risks a goal being scored on its empty net. In &quot;do-or-die&quot; situations such as playoff elimination games, a team may pull the goaltender for an extra attacker earlier in the game or when the team is down by more goals.
*During a delayed penalty call. In this case, once the opposing team regains possession of the puck, play will be stopped for the penalty. This means there will be no chance for a shot to be taken by the penalized team rendering the goaltender of little use. On rare occasions (and much to the humiliation of the team which has pulled its goalie), however, the puck can find its way into the empty net (without the penalized team ever gaining possession) as a result of an errant pass or other mishandling of the puck by the team with the man advantage. Hockey rules specify that in this case, the goal is awarded to the player on the penalized team who had last touched the puck and the serving of the penalty begins after the faceoff at centre ice.

The term sixth attacker is also used when both teams are at even strength; teams may also pull the goalie when shorthanded by a player, in which case the extra attacker would be a fifth attacker. It is exceptionally rare for a penalized team to do so during five on three situations.

Also, in four-on-four overtime, an extra attacker is added to a team on a power play in the case where another minor penalty is committed against them. This results in a five-on-three. In leagues with a three-on-three overtime, each minor penalty results in an extra attacker for the team on the power play (up to a maximum of five total skaters plus goalie). Penalized players return to the ice when their penalty expires, and the proper on-ice strength (e.g. 4-3, 4-4, or 3-3) is corrected at the first appropriate stoppage.

In leagues like the National Hockey League (NHL) where regular season standings are based on a point system (i.e. two points are awarded for a win, one point for an overtime/shootout loss, and no points for a loss in regulation), a team may be forced to use an extra attacker even when the score is tied near the end of regulation of a game at or near the end of the regular season to avoid being eliminated from playoff contention, division title contention, or even home-ice advantage. Beginning in 1999–2000 season, the league discourages from pulling their goaltender in overtime; if a team does so, and subsequently loses the game when their opponent scores an empty net goal, the losing team is charged with a regulation loss and forfeited the one point in the standings they would otherwise have received for an overtime loss.

Russian and Soviet coaches are known for refusing to pull their goalies when behind late in games, as was the case in the 1980 Winter Olympics medal game between the Soviet Union and the USA.

The extra attacker concept was first utilized in the NHL by Art Ross, coach and general manager of the Boston Bruins, who picked up the idea from experimental incidents in amateur and minor-league hockey. In a playoff game against the Montreal Canadiens on March 26, 1931, Ross had goaltender Tiny Thompson go to the bench for a sixth skater in the final minute of play; the Bruins failed to score and lost the game 1–0.

Milt Schmidt was the first NHL coach to pull the goaltender for a delayed penalty on April 16, 1958 while coaching the Boston Bruins against the Montreal Canadiens.

A 2018 model by Aaron Brown and Cliff Asness based on the 2015–16 NHL season suggested that, for a team down one point where losing 2–0 is no worse than losing 1–0, the ideal time to pull the goalie is somewhere between 5 and 6 minutes from the end of the match.

<text>Francis Grasso (March 25, 1948 – March 20, 2001) was an American disco music disc jockey from New York City, best known for being one of the first people to beatmatch.

Grasso, who attended Brooklyn Technical High School and Long Island University, started his DJ career in 1967–1968 at New York nightclub Salvation II. When the primary DJ Terry Noel failed to show up on time one night, the owners offered Grasso a chance at the job. The crowd responded almost immediately and soon he had his first regular gig. It was there and at subsequent New York clubs such as Tarots and his most famous nightclub, Sanctuary — a former German Baptist church at 43rd Street &amp; 9th Avenue (featured in the movie &quot;Klute&quot;) — where Grasso perfected his craft.

The key addition Grasso brought to DJ culture was music programming, or the art of picking up on the energy of the crowd and sending that energy right back to them via the next track. At his early Salvation II gigs Grasso used Rek-O-Kut direct drive turntables and a basic cross-fader. Initially he would change between records quickly, catching the rhythm of the current track by expertly starting the next record at the exact point he wanted. Later he used turntables with pitch controls, which allowed him to develop beatmatching, syncing the tempo of two records for an extended period while fading between them. He soon passed these techniques on to other DJs, including Michael Cappello and Steve D’Acquisto, which helped spread the style throughout New York City.

The skills and techniques he pioneered remain the foundation of what is heard in a modern nightclub. Francis was interviewed in Josell Ramos&#x27; 2003 feature-length documentary &quot;Maestro&quot;.

==Musical stylings==
DJ Francis completely changed the game of Disco music. Before him, DJs submitted to what the patrons wanted, supplying recognizable music that would appeal to the crowd. Occasionally, DJs would add a different spin on top of these popular charts. DJ Francis was not interested in what the customers wanted, and instead provided a new, exotic array of songs, which the crowd would not have thought to ask for. He offered a full, creative performance with a narrative. He demonstrated to the DJs of later generations that the power belonged to them to create environmental moods, and that there were techniques for creating different atmospheres, and thus manipulating dancers.

His musical choices were also quite different from his predecessors. He played on the funkier side of rock music, using The Rolling Stones or Led Zeppelin on top of heavy black rhythms such as Dyke &amp; The Blazers or Kool &amp; The Gang. He introduced drum-heavy African sounds, and used Latin beats to entice people to dance, as well as James Brown and Motown (including The Four Tops, The Supremes, and the Temptations).

==Cultural significance==
While DJing at the Sanctuary, a New York dance club known as &quot;the first totally uninhibited gay discothèque in America,&quot; Grasso was known for the danceability of his musical work. On nights when he was DJing, doormen were known to stop counting entrances of audience members after they got to the thousands, even though the Sanctuary had a capacity of 346 people. Being a safe haven for newly sexually liberated gay men and women, DJ Francis&#x27;s music was the backdrop for recreational drug usage and promiscuity. With his long-held position at the Sanctuary, Grasso was able to develop his musical techniques and perfect his powers to mesmerize crowds.

==Death==
Grasso was found dead on March 23, 2001, at his home in Brooklyn. He was estimated to have died 3 days prior.

<doc id="975556" wikidata="Q593362" url="?curid=975556" title="Draper">
<text>Draper was originally a term for a retailer or wholesaler of cloth that was mainly for clothing. A draper may additionally operate as a cloth merchant or a haberdasher.

==History==
Drapers were an important trade guild during the medieval period, when the sellers of cloth operated out of drapers&#x27; shops. However the original meaning of the term has now largely fallen out of use.

In 1724, Jonathan Swift wrote a series of satirical pamphlets in the guise of a draper called the &quot;Drapier&#x27;s Letters&quot;.

==Historical drapers==
A number of notable people who have at one time or another worked as drapers include:
* Sir Thomas Adams, 1st Baronet (1586–1667/1668), Lord Mayor of the City of London
* William Barley (1565?–1614), bookseller and publisher
* Norman Birkett
* Margaret Bondfield
* Thomas Burberry, Founder of fashion brand &quot;Burberry&quot;
* Eleanor Coade (1733–1821), successful businesswoman with Coade stone
* John Graunt, founder of the science of demography
* Antonie van Leeuwenhoek
* John Spedan Lewis
* William McGregor (1846–1911), chairman of Aston Villa Football Club and founder of the Football League
* Anthony Munday
* Hector MacDonald, was a drapers apprentice until at 18 he joined the army.
* Harry S. Truman, haberdasher before he became a Senator, Vice President and President of the United States
* H. G. Wells and his fictional characters Kipps and Mr Polly were draper&#x27;s assistants 
* Edward Whalley, regicide, cousin of Oliver Cromwell
* George Williams, founder of the YMCA
* John Woodward, geologist and physician to King Charles II

==Current usage==
A draper is now defined as a highly skilled role within the fashion industry. The term is used within a fashion design or costume design studio for people tasked with creating garments or patterns by draping fabric over a dress form; draping uses a human form to physically position the cloth into a desired pattern. This is an alternative method to drafting, when the garment is initially worked out from measurements on paper.

A fashion draper may also be known as a &quot;first hand&quot; because they are often the most skilled creator in the workshop and the &quot;first&quot; to work with the cloth for a garment. However a first hand in a costume studio is often an assistant to the draper. They are responsible for cutting the fabric with the patterns and assisting in costume fittings.

<doc id="975566" wikidata="Q2739271" url="?curid=975566" title="How Clean Is Your House?">
<text>How Clean Is Your House? is a British entertainment/lifestyle television programme in which expert cleaners Kim Woodburn and Aggie MacKenzie visit dirty houses and clean them up. The thirty-minute show was produced by Talkback Thames, the UK production arm of Fremantle (itself part of the RTL Group), and aired on Channel 4 from 2003 to 2009. Though a ratings success, Channel 4 announced that they had decided to cancel the series in 2009 in order to make way for new programming.

==Format==
Each episode of the programme followed the same formula. Accompanied by a dramatic score of horror movie music, Woodburn and MacKenzie explore the house on their own, examining the extent of the mess and looking for any particularly horrible areas. They then meet the resident before the cleaning begins, assisted by several professional cleaners. During this process, which takes up the bulk of the show, tips are shared for tackling particular cleaning tasks with the residents, often utilising traditional cleaning methods in addition to typical chemical cleaning products.

During the cleaning, MacKenzie takes swab samples from the filthiest areas of the house and has them analysed in a lab, often revealing numerous kinds of bacteria, frequently &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;Salmonella&quot;. Residents of the homes often have health problems that directly stem from the air quality or pathogens present before cleaning; MacKenzie will show the residents her findings in an effort to make them understand the connection between their health and their home&#x27;s condition.

The final section of the show has Woodburn and MacKenzie unveiling the freshly cleaned home to the resident. In earlier episodes, they would return to the home two weeks later to see if the cleaning was being maintained.

The show makes a point of thoroughly cleaning carpets and furniture the resident owns, and not replacing dirty or worn items just for the sake of the final reveal. In a few particular cases in which a resident lacked basic items of furniture (such as one who might have been sleeping on a mattress on the floor rather than a bed), Kim and Aggie might coordinate with neighbours or local secondhand shops to donate items.

Woodburn takes the role of a dominating woman, scolding residents for letting their homes get so bad. She is sometimes playfully flirtatious with male residents. In contrast, MacKenzie (whose previous jobs included associate editor in &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; and working for MI6) assumes the more serious &quot;dirt detective&quot; role, performing such tasks as the bacterial analysis. She plays at being more squeamish than Woodburn, claiming that she will be sick or run away from a particularly horrific home. While cleaning, both wear industrial white suits and rubber gloves adorned with marabou feathers and fake gemstones.

Actor Paul Copley provides tongue-in-cheek, often alliterative voice-over narration for each episode. The show is light-hearted and often camp, falling just as much into the entertainment category than the factual genre. Much of the appeal comes from the voyeuristic pleasure of seeing how untidy some people let their houses become (many have not been cleaned for years) and the reactions of the show&#x27;s two stars, though the cleaning tips add some practical value to the show.

== Final series ==
The sixth and final series aired in the UK on Channel 4 from 13 August–24 September 2009, and was (for the first time) also broadcast in High Definition on Channel 4 HD. Primarily the same format as previous editions, Kim and Aggie continued to seek out &quot;the UK&#x27;s filthiest homes&quot;, however, the programme was promoted as delving far deeper into the psyche of the home owners. In addition, the two-week &quot;check-up&quot; was omitted from the show&#x27;s formula, but Kim and Aggie undertook a roadshow style appearance in each episode where they would meet members of the public to answer questions and offer cleaning tips.

In November 2009, Channel 4 announced that they had decided to end the series after six years as part of its ongoing &quot;creative renewal&quot; for programming. Channel 4&#x27;s head of programming, Julian Bellamy, said the series had been one of several &quot;huge hits&quot; for the channel, but that his focus was now on &quot;finding the next generation of groundbreaking shows&quot;.

==DVD &amp; VHS Releases==
&quot;How Clean Is Your House?&quot; received a release on both DVD and VHS in the UK on 8 November 2004.

&quot;How Clean Is Your House? USA Seasons 1 &amp; 2&quot; was released on DVD in the US on 4 March 2008.

== Spin-offs and international adaptations ==
The format has been adapted to many other countries. A United States version, also starring Kim and Aggie, premiered in September 2004 on the Lifetime network and ran for two seasons. This edition also aired in the UK on Channel 4. This version has been criticized for using product placement such as Mr Clean and Bounty instead of the homemade cleaning solutions that the UK version uses. Both the UK &amp; US versions aired in Canada on the W Network and in Australia on cable television channel UK.TV.

A Dutch version titled &quot;Hoe schoon is jouw huis?&quot; (a literal translation of the original English title) has been made with two Dutch ladies performing the same role as Kim and Aggie do in the original. The show aired on the commercial RTL-4 channel and has been rerun on RTL-5. The original British series also aired on Dutch television under the Dutch title.

A French version titled &quot;C&#x27;est du Propre!&quot; (&quot;Now &quot;That&#x27;s&quot; Clean!&quot;) aired on M6 and on other channels of the M6 group (Téva, W9). The French &quot;cleaning ladies&quot; are Danièle Odin and Béatrice de Malembert. Two tie-in books have been published.

A spin-off book, &quot;How Clean Is Your House?&quot;, written by Kim and Aggie, was published in 2003. FreemantleMedia has also signed licensing and merchandising deals with many cleaning product manufacturers and other companies.

In 2004, Kim and Aggie made a spin-off series called &quot;Too Posh to Wash&quot; about the personal hygiene of upper-class people, including one participant who had never washed her bra. They also did a one-off special, &quot;When Kim &amp; Aggie Went to Hospital&quot; which aired on 30 August 2006, about how to keep our hospitals clean. In this hour-long special, the pair traveled to Ealing Hospital which has often been criticised for poor hygiene conditions and regularly finishes at the bottom of the NHS Hospital League Tables. It was more serious in tone compared to &quot;How Clean Is Your House?&quot;

<text>A fixed-term election is an election that occurs on a set date, which cannot be changed by incumbent politicians other than through exceptional mechanisms if at all. The office holder generally takes office for a set amount of time, and their term of office or mandate ends automatically.

Most modern democracies hold fixed-terms elections. The term of office varies, but in many countries it is five years. Fixed-term elections are common for directly elected executive officers, such as directly elected mayors, governors and presidents, but less common for prime ministers and parliaments in a parliamentary system of government.

==Examples==

* The Australian Senate has a semi-fixed term that can be cut short only by a double dissolution under Section 57 of the Australian constitution, used if there is a prolonged deadlock over a bill supported by the Australian House of Representatives. While the term itself is fixed, the election date can be shifted with the government having a ten month window it can schedule the election on. After a double dissolution election, to restore rotation, newly elected Senators&#x27; terms are backdated to the previous 1 July so that they serve less than three or six years. Since the Australian House of Representatives has a maximum term of only three years but no minimum term, elections for the two houses can become desynchronised, resulting in separate elections for each house. However, this has not happened since 1970. The Australian states and territories of New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria, Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) have semi-fixed terms in that dissolution at any time in mid-term is allowed only to resolve a serious deadlock.
* Elections to the European Parliament are considered the second largest democratic elections in the world and occur every five years on a weekend in June. Each country is relatively free to set its own election rules and each chooses one out of the four days of the selected weekend to hold its election.
* In Hong Kong, according to the Hong Kong Basic Law, the Chief Executive is elected every five years and the Legislative Council is elected every four years. Under some circumstances the Chief Executive may dissolve the Legislative Council, and under some other circumstances the Chief Executive is obliged to resign. In 2005 it was resolved that if the office of the Chief Executive is left vacant, the successor serves only the remainder of the term of his or her predecessor.
* Elections in Norway take place every two years, alternating between parliamentary and local elections. Norway is unusual in that the legislature cannot be dissolved early (a trait it shares with the United States but few other countries): the Storting always serves its full four-year term; the constitution does not allow snap elections, nor does it give the monarch the right to dissolve parliament even if the government wants to do so.
* Elections in Russia to the State Duma are for a five-year term. The President of Russia has the authority to dissolve the Duma and call a snap election in two cases: if the Duma refuses to approve the President&#x27;s appointee for Prime Minister of Russia three times in a row, or if the Duma passes a motion of no-confidence in the Government of Russia twice in three months.
* Elections in Sweden take place every four years. Extra elections can be called by the Prime Minister. They happen automatically when and if the Speaker fails four times to present a candidate for Prime Minister that Parliament can accept. Extra elections do not replace regular ones - they do not move the four-year schedule.
* In the United Kingdom, the only fixed-term election for the House of Commons was in 2015, the date having been determined by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. Under the act, elections were set for the 25th working day following the day when a parliamentary term ended on its fifth year. The UK Parliament voted to bring the 2020 election forward to 2017, followed by its fast-tracking of the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019. Both acts were repealed by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022. Fixed-term elections to the UK&#x27;s devolved parliaments are held on the first Thursday in May every five years. Unlike Canada, Germany, and Australia, provision is not made for early dissolving Parliament through exceptional means, with the monarch able to dissolve parliament at their pleasure.
* Elections in the United States: Members of Congress and the President serve fixed terms, and no mechanisms exist for early elections. General elections for Congress occur every two years on Election Day in November. The President is technically elected every four years by the Electoral College. However, it is customary today for electors to be chosen based on the outcome of popular votes for President, held along with Congressional elections when applicable. Congress and the President remain in office until January the following year. Most U.S. states and territories also have fixed terms for their legislatures and executives, and most hold their general elections on the federal Election Day, though several states hold off-year elections instead.

===Maximum terms===
A number of countries do not provide for fixed terms for elected officials, instead stipulating the maximum length of a term, permitting elections to be held more frequently as determined by the government. Such examples include the House of Commons of the UK, the Australian House of Representatives, the Canadian House of Commons, the New Zealand Parliament, and the Folketing of Denmark; in each case the prime minister may advise the monarch to call an election earlier than the constitutional maximum term of the parliament.

<text>Najeh Trenadious Monté Davenport (born February 8, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League. He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes and was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the fourth round of the 2002 NFL draft. In addition to the Packers, Davenport played in the NFL for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Indianapolis Colts.

==College career==
Davenport attended the University of Miami, where he played primarily as a halfback. Chosen as the offensive captain, he won an NCAA Division I-A national football championship as a member of the Hurricanes in 2001. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in theatre with a minor in education at the University of Miami. He was chosen by the Packers in the fourth round of the 2002 NFL draft with the 135th overall pick.

==Professional career==

===Green Bay Packers===
During his NFL career, Davenport struggled with fumbles and with injuries that kept him off the playing field. Davenport&#x27;s abilities exceed a fourth-round selection, but as many scouts predicted, Davenport was plagued by injuries throughout his career. In his rookie campaign, he rushed for a respectable 4.7 yards per carry average before fracturing his left eye socket.

In 2003, injuries were minimal and he rushed for 5.45 yards per carry, good for the second highest in the NFL, and 30.1 yards per kick return. However, in the 2004 season, Davenport started the season with a lingering hamstring injury that kept him out for a month. On November 29, 2004, Davenport, in his first NFL start, rushed for 178 yards, third highest debut start yardage in the NFL for the past 20 years. Later that year, Davenport broke his ribs, resulting in playing at far less than 100 percent.

In 2005, after starting running back Ahman Green went down with a quadriceps injury, Davenport took over as starter. In what would be his only start of the season, versus the New Orleans Saints, Davenport scored two first-half touchdowns before breaking his ankle. He was subsequently placed on injured reserve, effectively ending his season.

===Pittsburgh Steelers===
Davenport was released by the Packers on September 2, 2006, when the team made their final roster cuts. Six days later, on September 8, 2006, however, Davenport was signed to the roster of the Pittsburgh Steelers. He finished the 2006 season with a total of 221 rushing yards.

After the Steelers signed veteran running back Kevan Barlow, Davenport was facing competition with Barlow for the second and third string positions. However, Barlow was cut during training camp, and Davenport assumed the second-string responsibilities for Pittsburgh&#x27;s opener against Cleveland. Davenport rushed for 43 yards on eight carries in the Steelers&#x27; 34–7 win.

Arguably his best game with the Steelers came on Thursday, December 20, 2007, against the St. Louis Rams. Davenport had 24 carries for 123 yards and a touchdown, as well as two catches for 44 yards and another touchdown. Davenport came into the game to relieve Willie Parker, who broke his fibula in the first quarter.

The Steelers released Davenport on June 28, 2008. He was re-signed on September 30 following injuries to Willie Parker, Rashard Mendenhall and Carey Davis. The Steelers released him again on November 8, only to re-sign him on November 27 due to the injury to Parker. Davenport was released once more on December 2.

===Indianapolis Colts===
Davenport was signed by the Indianapolis Colts on December 9, 2008. In two games with the Colts, he had eight rushes for 26 yards and caught four passes for 54 yards. He was released on January 3, 2009, after the team elevated offensive tackle Michael Toudouze from the practice squad.

==Personal life==

=== Burglary and criminal mischief charge ===
Prior to entering the NFL, Davenport broke into the dorm room of a Barry University woman and defecated in a laundry basket on April 1, 2002. A woman sleeping in the room told police she was startled by a strange grunting sound and observed Davenport in a squatted position, evacuating his bowels and voiding into a laundry hamper in her closet. In a plea bargain, his felony charge of second-degree burglary and misdemeanor count of criminal mischief were dropped in exchange for his completing 100 hours of community service. Davenport maintained his innocence after the hearing, demanding outside of the courthouse, &quot;Where&#x27;s the evidence? Where&#x27;s the manure? I know I didn&#x27;t do it – I just wanted to get it over with.&quot;

During his career, Davenport was given the nicknames &quot;Dookie&quot; and &quot;The Dump Truck.&quot; While playing for the Packers, a portable commode was placed inside of his locker during training camp as a rookie hazing prank, and a spirited letter writing campaign to the Green Bay team equipment manager asked in jest that he be issued jersey Number Two for practice, which was referenced for many years during the opening of the &quot;D-List&quot; show on WAUK ESPN 540 in Milwaukee before the station flipped format from sports talk to progressive talk. All are plays on the incident.

=== Alleged domestic violence ===
Davenport was charged in Cleveland with domestic violence, endangering, and unlawful restraint in an October 2007 incident involving the mother of his five-year-old son. He entered a plea of not guilty days later and the case went to trial on April 4, 2008. After a four-day trial, an eight-member jury spent three and a half hours deliberating before finding Davenport not guilty of all counts.

=== Race-based Discrimination in NFL Concussion Settlement ===
On October 25, 2020, Davenport and another ex-NFL player, Kevin Henry (cousin of professional wrestling great Mark Henry and coincidentally also an ex-Steeler), filed a lawsuit against the NFL stating the NFL used &quot;race-norming&quot; as a factor to determine neurocognitive impairment as part of the NFL&#x27;s Concussion Settlement. The complaint stated that Black players&#x27; neurocognitive impairment score was adjusted by making an assumption that Black players started with a lower cognitive ability than a non-Black player. This adjustment made it more difficult for Black players to prove cognitive decline compared to non-Black players. On October 21, 2021, the NFL and lawyers for thousands of retired NFL players reached an agreement to end race-based adjustments in cognitive testing related to the NFL&#x27;s Concussion Settlement.

<doc id="975580" wikidata="Q781461" url="?curid=975580" title="Quartz monzonite">
<text>Quartz monzonite is an intrusive, felsic, igneous rock that has an approximately equal proportion of orthoclase and plagioclase feldspars. It is typically a light colored phaneritic (coarse-grained) to porphyritic granitic rock. The plagioclase is typically intermediate to sodic in composition, andesine to oligoclase. Quartz is present in significant amounts. Biotite and/or hornblende constitute the dark minerals. Because of its coloring, it is often confused with granite, but whereas granite contains more than 20% quartz, quartz monzonite is only 5–20% quartz. Rock with less than five percent quartz is classified as monzonite. A rock with more alkali feldspar is a syenite whereas one with more plagioclase is a quartz diorite. The fine grained volcanic rock equivalent of quartz monzonite is quartz latite.

The term adamellite was originally applied by A. Cathrein in 1890 to orthoclase-bearing tonalite (likely a granodiorite) at Monte Adamello, Italy, in 1890, but later came to refer to quartz monzonite. The term is now deprecated.

Quartz monzonite porphyry is often associated with copper mineralization in the porphyry copper ore deposits.

==Geographic distribution==

===United States===
In the White Mountains and western highlands of New Hampshire, the Kinsman Quartz Monzonite is an extensive formation that underlies Kinsman Mountain, parts of Franconia Notch, Mount Cardigan, and Mount Sunapee.

Stone Mountain in Georgia is a large quartz monzonite monadnock.

Quartz monzonite extracted from a quarry in Little Cottonwood Canyon was used to build several buildings in Salt Lake City, Utah, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&#x27; Salt Lake Temple, Church Administration Building, and Conference Center, as well as the Utah State Capitol.

The large boulders of Joshua Tree National Park in southern California are quartz monzonite.

A large pluton in the Atlanta lobe of the Idaho Batholith, near McCall, Idaho, is made of quartz monzonite.

The Guilford Quartz Monzonite and Woodstock Quartz Monzonite, probably comagmatic, are located in central Maryland.

===Australia===
In Queensland, Castle Hill, Mount Stuart and Mount Louisa around Townsville represent a large quartz monzonite province.

<doc id="975582" wikidata="Q192876" url="?curid=975582" title="Tanah Abang">
<text>Tanah Abang () is a district of Central Jakarta, Indonesia. The district hosts the biggest textile market in Southeast Asia, Tanah Abang Market. It also hosts Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Kelurahan Gelora and the western half of the largely skyscraper-dominated Sudirman Central Business District.

==Namesakes==
It is also the name of two historic roads in Kelurahan South Petojo, Gambir District. One of these roads, Tanah Abang 1, hosts the old Dutch Cemetery, now partly a museum, &quot;Museum Taman Prasasti&quot;, and the burial place of Olivia Mariamne Devenish, Eurasian wife of Stamford Raffles.

Contrary to what is colloquially stated, the city&#x27;s important Textile Museum is in West Jakarta (Kelurahan Kota Bambu Selatan, Palmerah District), just over the western border.

==Tanah Abang market==


Tanah Abang market is in Kelurahan Kebon Kacang, next to Tanah Abang station on the western edge. The market has been known to exist since 1735. The market is the main forum for textile trade orders in Indonesia and the biggest in Southeast Asia, with much of its business conducted by sample, enabling side-by-side comparisons of competitors in quality, design, and innovation in all types of textile applications and fashion. Major manufacturers and smaller, niche ones compete for market space. Before 2003, the market was divided into three parts. Part of the market was ravaged by fire in February 2003 but soon rebuilt. Extensions and dominant parts, &quot;Blok A&quot; and &quot;Blok B&quot;, were added in 2005 and 2010. Blok A is the largest, covering 160,000 square meters, having almost 8,000 kiosks, and is visited by about 80,000 buyers on busy days, with daily transactions averaging about Rp 500 billion ($43 million). It is well known among traders from Africa, Australasia, and much of Asia.

==Traffic congestion==
In November 2017, Governor Anies Baswedan claimed that congestion in the Tanah Abang district was caused by pedestrians instead of street vendors conducting business on the area&#x27;s sidewalks and roads. The city administration closed a 400-meter road stretch for traffic (except for Transjakarta buses) to accommodate the street vendors, against criticism from pedestrians, public transport drivers, and regular vendors. Although some observers noted that the move might violate national regulations, the street vendors and some city officials praised the move. On 7 December 2018, a sky bridge was opened above the road to accommodate the street vendors.

==Kelurahan (administrative villages)==
The district is divided into seven &quot;kelurahan&quot; (administrative villages) and their area codes are given:
==List of important places==

* Gelora Bung Karno Stadium
* Hotel Grand Indonesia (western extension)
* Jakarta Convention Center
* Karet Bivak Cemetery
* Petamburan Cemetery
* Senayan City
* Tanah Abang market
* Grid Network
* Wisma 46
* Tanah Abang railway station
TVRI Tower

<text>Lego Duplo (trademarked as DUPLO and stylised in the logo as duplo) is a core product range of the construction toy Lego by The Lego Group, designed for children from to 5 years old. Duplo bricks are twice the size of traditional Lego bricks in each of their three dimensions, making them easier to handle and less likely to be swallowed and choked on by younger children. Despite their size, they are still compatible with traditional Lego bricks.

Initially launched in 1969, the Duplo range has expanded since then to include sets with figures, animals, cars, houses, and trains. Duplo products are manufactured in Nyíregyháza, Hungary.

== Development ==
Before its introduction in 1969, The Lego Group investigated ways to produce safe, age-appropriate Lego bricks that were larger than traditional bricks to target young children aged one-and-a-half years and above. The company initially struggled to find a scale that would fit with the existing Lego System of Play, exploring 3:1 and 4:1 scales, but eventually settled on a 2:1 scale. In 1968, second-generation owner Godtfred Kirk Christiansen provided the idea of hollowing out the studs on the Duplo bricks to make them compatible with the system. Duplo is derived from the Latin word for &quot;duplex&quot;, meaning double.

== History ==


Duplo bricks were introduced in 1969, in four colours: red, yellow, blue, and white. The following year, two more sets were added with blue and red wheel plates. In the product catalogue for 1971, the sets were described as being for children from 1 to 2 years but were still sold mixed with Lego bricks, normally designed for ages 3 to 12. In 1972, the Duplo brick with two rows of two studs was introduced.

In 1975, Duplo became its product brand, with five sets made up exclusively of Duplo bricks. New additions included a round-topped two-by-two stud brick and a small four-wheeled wagon with two rows of six studs. With these new Duplo sets, Lego began targeting children years old with the intention that when the children became older, their Duplo bricks could be used together with regular Lego bricks.

In 1977, the Duplo name was dropped in favour of Lego Preschool. Small figures the size of two-by-two bricks were introduced, made up of a cylindrical head and a tapered, limbless body, similar in design to Fisher-Price&#x27;s Little People. Another new brick was a half arch. The new sets included figures, doors, and two-by-six brick wagons that could act as a car or train.

The name Duplo was brought back in 1979, along with a new reworked logo. Some brick sets were sold inside a plush version of the rabbit from the logo, that zipped closed.

In 1983, other Duplo figures appeared, often called Duplo people. These figures have moveable heads, arms, and legs and look like large Lego minifigures, but cannot be taken apart, making them safer for small children. Also in 1983, set number 2700 was introduced with a model of a steam engine with two train cars. In 1986, a Duplo doll house with sliding doors was introduced. This included a Duplo people mother, father, and smaller child.

In 1992, Duplo Toolo was introduced, which was a range of construction sets using screwdrivers and was aimed at children between the ages of three and six.

1993 brought a grey rail train system with a stop-and-start track. Later, two more train systems arrived. In 2005, Lego started selling Duplo trains themed after Thomas &amp; Friends.

In 1995, Duplo Primo was launched, which was a line aimed at children aged between 6 and 24 months. Most of the products in this line were not construction toys. Duplo Primo was later renamed Lego Primo.

The name Duplo was dropped again in favour of Explore in 2002. The new brand name was used to emphasise the relationship between the bricks and the child&#x27;s learning. Explore introduced four different ways of exploring play: explore being me; explore together; explore imagination and explore logic. In the 2004 spring catalogue, there was a reminder that Duplo was now called Explore, but that fall the well-known Duplo name was back yet again with a new rabbit logo designed to match the new elephant logo for the Lego Quatro range.

Lego has made Duplo sets licensed with Bob the Builder and Thomas &amp; Friends characters. Those Duplo ranges have been discontinued, but Duplo sets now include farm, zoo, town, castle, and pirate lines. a doll house and princess castle are available. Some Duplo sets have cars, trucks, and buildings which cannot be disassembled. Some DUPLO sets do not include building manuals.

== Production ==
Lego Duplo is manufactured at a factory in Nyíregyháza, Hungary. Over 90% of all Duplo elements are manufactured at the plant, alongside traditional Lego bricks. Csaba Tóth, Communications Director, commented, &quot;Every year, about 14 million Duplo boxes come out of the Nyíregyháza factory. For this, we inject 2 million Duplo cubes and Duplo parts a day&quot;.

==Other media==
In 1995, Lego Duplo was the sponsor of the British children&#x27;s preschool television series &quot;Tots TV&quot; on Children&#x27;s ITV.

In 2014, Lego Duplo made an appearance in &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;, as aliens built from Duplo bricks that threaten the citizens of Bricksburg. They reappear in the 2019 sequel, &quot;The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part&quot;, as the same alien invaders, with the story picking up from the events of the previous film.

==Theme park attraction==
In March 2020, a new theme park attraction was announced at Legoland Windsor Resort. The Duplo Dino Coaster was introduced as part of Duplo Valley, an area of the park designed for children aged five and under. The area also includes Duplo Valley Airport, which involves fully controllable helicopters.

==Reception==
In October 2019, &quot;Lego Duplo World&quot; was launched, which is an educational game app that was designed to help children between the ages of two and five reach their key learning goals. It was developed by StoryToys in partnership with The Lego Group. The app has won several awards, including a 2020 Licensing International Award, a 2020 KAPI award at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, a 2021 Notable Children&#x27;s Digital Media award from the American Library Association and a 2021 Kidscreen Award for Best Learning App (branded).

== Awards and nominations ==
In 2009, Feeding Zoo (set number: 5634) was awarded &quot;DreamToys&quot; in the Construction category by the Toy Retailers Association.

In 2019, Submarine Adventure! (set number: 10910) was awarded &quot;DreamToys&quot; in the Trains, Planes and Automobiles category by the Toy Retailers Association.

<text>Egg rolling, or an Easter egg roll is a traditional game played with eggs at Easter. Different nations have different versions of the game, usually played with hard-boiled, decorated eggs.

==History==
In Christianity, for the celebration of Eastertide, Easter eggs symbolize the empty tomb of Jesus, from which he was resurrected. Additionally, eggs carry a Trinitarian significance, with shell, yolk, and albumen being three parts of one egg. During Lent, the season of repentance that precedes Easter, eggs along with meat, lacticinia, and wine are foods that are traditionally abstained from, a practice that continues in Eastern Christianity and among certain Western Christian congregations that do the Daniel Fast. After the forty-day Lenten season concludes and Eastertide begins, eggs may be consumed again, giving rise to various traditions such as egg rolling, which also symbolizes the angel rolling away the stone at the entrance of the tomb.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom the tradition of rolling decorated eggs down grassy hills goes back hundreds of years and is known as &quot;pace-egging&quot;. The term originates from the Old English &quot;Pasch&quot;, taken from the Hebrew &quot;Pesach&quot; meaning Passover. In Lancashire there are annual egg rolling competitions at Holcombe Hill near Ramsbottom and Avenham Park in Preston. Egg rolling has been a tradition at Avenham Park for hundreds of years, but in recent years chocolate eggs have been used. Other traditional egg rolling sites are the castle moat at Penrith, Bunkers Hill in Derby, Arthur&#x27;s Seat in Edinburgh, Hill 60 on the Beverley Westwood and on Penshaw Hill in Tyne and Wear at Penshaw Monument.

Traditionally, the eggs were wrapped in onion skins and boiled to give them a mottled, gold appearance (although today they usually are painted), and the children competed to see who could roll their egg the farthest. There is an old Lancashire legend that says the broken eggshells should be crushed carefully afterward, or these would be stolen and used as boats by witches. The eggs were eaten on Easter Sunday or given out to pace-eggers – fantastically dressed characters who processed through the streets singing traditional pace-egging songs and collecting money as a tribute before performing traditional mumming plays. At the Wordsworth Museum in Grasmere, there is a collection of highly decorated eggs made for the poet&#x27;s children.

In Scotland, &quot;pace-eggin&quot; is traditional from Shetland to The Borders although the day varied with location. &quot;Pace-egg day&quot; variously was Holy Saturday, Easter Sunday, or Easter Monday. &quot;Paiss-braes&quot;, hills, were used or other grassy slopes or areas such as seaside links. There is some variation in the spelling and pronunciation of the term &quot;pace&quot;, including &quot;pash&quot;, &quot;peace&quot; and &quot;paste&quot;.

==United States==

In the United States, the Easter Egg Roll is held on the White House South Lawn each Easter Monday for children (age 13 and younger) and their parents. It is hosted by the president of the United States and the first lady of the United States.
The Egg Roll is a race where children push an egg through the grass with a long-handled spoon. Surrounding events include live entertainment, appearances by White House personalities in Easter Bunny costumes, speeches and book-reading by cabinet secretaries or celebrity guests, and exhibits of artistically decorated eggs. The event traditionally begins with a performance of the national anthem, followed by opening remarks by the President and the First Lady.

According to tradition, Dolley Madison, the wife of President James Madison, began the event in 1814. Hundreds of children brought their decorated eggs to join in games. Rolling Easter eggs was a popular annual custom in Washington, D.C., and Alexandria, Virginia, as early as the 1850s. Children rolled eggs on Easter Monday (and sometimes Good Friday) at the Capitol, the White House, and other parks and open spaces. Easter eggs were rolled at the Capitol as early as 1855 and at the White House as early as 1860. By the 1870s, the Capitol had become the most popular place to roll eggs, although they were also rolled at the White House and other places.

In 1876, shortly after a particularly rambunctious Easter egg roll destroyed much of the lawn at the Capitol, Congress passed a law making it illegal to use the Capitol complex as a children&#x27;s playground. Heavy rain prevented much egg rolling in 1877, so the ban was not tested until 1878.

At the request of a number of children, including his own, then president Rutherford B. Hayes and his wife Lucy Hayes brought the event to the White House lawns in 1878. From that year on, the egg roll would be an annual White House event, with the exception of 1917 (moved to the Washington Monument), 1918–1920 (canceled due to food shortages and influenza concerns), 1942 (moved to the Capitol West Lawn), 1943–1945 (World War II), 1946–1947 (food conservation), 1948–1952 (restoration of the White House) and 2020–2021 (social distancing measures to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic), then resumed in 2022. 

In 1953, Mamie Eisenhower proposed that the event be opened to black children, who were allowed to participate starting in 1954. Since 1977 the marketing group The American Egg Board has heavily supported the event.

The event was featured in the 2007 film &quot;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&quot;.

==Other countries==
In Germany, a prize is awarded to the contestant whose egg rolls the fastest down a track made of sticks. In Denmark, decorated eggs are rolled down slopes in grassland or forest, and the contestant whose egg rolls farthest is the winner, with unbroken eggs eaten after the game. The tradition is widespread around the town of Køge. In Lithuania, one collects those eggs touched by the one rolled.

In Egypt, children bowl red and yellow eggs toward another row of eggs, and whoever&#x27;s egg cracks one egg may claim them all.

In eastern Europe, there are other traditions such as egg tapping and egg decorating.

<text>Keswick railway station was a station on the Adelaide-Wolseley line and served by Adelaide Metro Belair, Noarlunga and Tonsley line services. It was located in the inner western Adelaide suburb of Keswick, 3.8 kilometres from Adelaide station.

==History==
Keswick station was opened on 6 April 1913. Within months of opening, a station master was appointed to manage bulk goods business, including firewood and sand bricks. A ticket office was added in 1927. The station lay adjacent to Adelaide Parklands Terminal.

The station was closed and demolished in March 2013 during the closure of the Noarlunga and Tonsley lines, in preparation for the electrification of those lines. At the time of its closure, it was the only station on the Adelaide suburban system without wheelchair access, the steep terrain and sparse patronage being prohibitive. A new Adelaide Showground station south of the Keswick Bridge opened on 17 February 2014, replacing Keswick as well as the annual temporary Showground Central station.

<doc id="975610" wikidata="Q918756" url="?curid=975610" title="Clodomiro Almeyda">
<text>Clodomiro Almeyda Medina (February 11, 1923 – August 25, 1997) was a Chilean politician. A leading member of the Socialist Party, served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Chile from 1970 to 1973 during the Presidency of Salvador Allende.

== Biography ==
He did his first studies at the German and Application High Schools of Santiago, and then studied at the Faculty of Law, University of Chile. He graduated in 1948 with a thesis entitled &quot;Towards a Marxist theory of the State&quot;. He later became a professor of political science in the domain of his studies, especially in the School of Sociology.

He joined the Socialist Party of Chile in 1941, participating in the Popular Socialist Party during the internal bankruptcy in the first part of the 1950s. During the second government of Carlos Ibáñez del Campo he was head of the Ministries of Labor and Mining, standing out in his first ministry for being a promoter for the Single Central of Workers (CUT). With the reunification of the party in 1957, he rejoined the organization and was elected for Chamber of deputies for the period of 1961–1965.

With the victory of Salvador Allende in the 1970 Chilean presidential elections, Almeyda was appointed to the post of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  During the Popular Unity government, he remained in office, except for a brief period in which he served as Minister of National Defense. This was when he made a &quot;castling&quot; with Orlando Letelier (then Minister of the Interior), in order to avoid being the object of censorship by National Congress by means of a motion of no confidence.

After the coup d&#x27;état of September 11, 1973, which overthrew the constitutional government, he was arrested and transferred along with 99 other leaders and leaders of the Popular Unity to the Dawson Island Concentration Camp, where he was tortured and he remained under arrest for a long time. He was eventually exiled, living in the German Democratic Republic and Mexico. where he worked as a university teacher and leader of the political opposition in exile.

In a daring maneuver, he clandestinely returned to Chile in March 1987, crossing the Andes on the back of a mule. He later appeared publicly to the surprise of the authorities of the Pinochet government. This led to him being imprisoned and being the only person declared &quot;unconstitutional&quot; by the Constitutional Court of Chile, in use of the missing article 8 of the Constitution of Chile.

This article outlawed political parties and individuals that propagated doctrines of the left (that is, those that promoted a doctrine &quot;founded on the class struggle&quot;). Such conviction mainly meant the loss of the exercise of their citizenship rights and he could only be rehabilitated as a citizen once the country had returned to democratic normality, by the same court that sentenced it.

During the aftermath of the Pinochet dictatorship and during the first years of the so-called &quot;Chilean transition to democracy&quot; Almeyda led the leftist faction of Chilean socialism, with the renewed wing led by the leader Ricardo Núñez. In this role, &quot;Don Cloro&quot; (as he was popularly known), tried to establish contacts with the communists or even further to the left, through formations such as Izquierda Unida or the short-lived Broad Party of Socialist Left. During the government of Patricio Aylwin he was in charge of reopening the Chilean embassy in the Soviet Union during the last months of the Eastern Bloc. During his stay in Moscow in 1991, he accepted as &quot;guest&quot; former East German President Erich Honecker, who was wanted by the German authorities to be tried for crimes during the socialist regime. Despite Chile&#x27;s objections, President of Russia Boris Yeltsin ordered his deportation to Berlin, in what turned into a serious diplomatic incident.

Back in Chile he devoted himself to private life, writing his memories and working as an academic at the University of Chile, School of Sociology until his death on August 25, 1997.

== Tributes ==
In homage to Almeyda, the &quot;Extraordinary Congress&quot; of the Socialist Party of Chile in May 1998 as well as its library was named after him.

<text>Abbot is a small lunar impact crater that lies on the rugged ground between the Mare Fecunditatis in the south and west, and the Mare Crisium to the north. It is a circular crater with a cup-shaped interior. The inner walls slope downward to the midpoint, and no impacts of significant mark the interior or the rim.

Abbot is named after the American astrophysicist Charles Greeley Abbot. It was designated Apollonius K before being given its name by the IAU. Apollonius itself lies to the east of the crater Abbot.

<doc id="975635" wikidata="Q1810196" url="?curid=975635" title="Dandelion Wine">
<text>Dandelion Wine is a 1957 novel by Ray Bradbury set in the summer of 1928 in the fictional town of Green Town, Illinois, based upon Bradbury&#x27;s childhood home of Waukegan, Illinois, and serving as the first novel in his &quot;Green Town Trilogy&quot;. The novel developed from the short story &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot;, which appeared in the June 1953 issue of &quot;Gourmet&quot; magazine.

The title refers to a wine made with dandelion petals and other ingredients, commonly citrus fruit. In the story, dandelion wine, as made by the protagonist&#x27;s grandfather, serves as a metaphor for distilling all of the joys of summer.

The main character of the story is Douglas Spaulding, a 12-year-old boy loosely patterned after Bradbury. Most of the book is focused upon the routines of small-town America, and the simple joys of yesterday.

==Background and origins==
Bradbury noted in &quot;Just This Side of Byzantium&quot;, a 1974 essay used as an introduction to the book, that &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; is a recreation of a boy&#x27;s childhood, based upon an intertwining of Bradbury&#x27;s own experiences and imagination.

&quot;Farewell Summer&quot;, the official sequel to &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot;, was published in October 2006. While &quot;Farewell Summer&quot; is a direct continuation of the plot of &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot;, &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;, a novel with a completely different plot and characters, is often paired with the latter because of their stylistic and thematic similarities. Together, the three novels form a Green Town trilogy. A fourth volume, &quot;Summer Morning, Summer Night&quot;, published in 2008, contains twenty-seven Green Town stories and vignettes, seventeen of which had never been published before.

==Plot introduction==
&quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; is a series of short stories loosely connected to summer occurrences, with Douglas and his family as recurring characters. Many of the chapters were first published as individual short stories, the earliest being &quot;The Night&quot; (1946), with the remainder appearing between 1950 and 1957.

==Main characters==
Douglas Spaulding: The protagonist of the novel, the entire summer is seen mostly through his eyes as a time of joys and sorrows. Douglas is imaginative, fanciful, and occasionally meditative on the state of the world. Most of the time, he aims to have fun as a 12-year-old kid, but sometimes he lapses into philosophical brooding on topics, including life and death, more mature topics than what would be expected of his age. Bradbury has stated that Douglas is based on the childhood version of him, and in fact, &quot;Douglas&quot; is Bradbury&#x27;s actual middle name, while &quot;Spaulding&quot; is his father&#x27;s middle name.

Tom Spaulding: Douglas&#x27; younger brother, Tom is the more logical and skeptical one, often questioning his brother&#x27;s seemingly inexplicable actions. Tom is also somewhat more childish and naïve than Douglas, often failing to understand the seriousness of Douglas&#x27; thoughts about his life; nonetheless, he often acts as the voice of reason when Douglas&#x27; imagination gets the better of him.

Charlie: A friend of Douglas and Tom, Charlie often hangs around with them. Charlie sometimes comments on a situation or on the behavior of other characters. Other than that, he gets little character development and acts as more of a side character for Douglas and Tom&#x27;s adventures.

==Critical reception==
Some critics consider &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; to be Bradbury&#x27;s most personal work. According to Electric Literature, &quot;The book is Bradbury’s masterpiece, his fullest, most deeply felt and lyrical expression, touching on his usual themes of youth, old age and small-town life but stripped of their usual layer of sci-fi remove.&quot; Georges D. Todds of the SF Site said that the novel&#x27;s power lies in the &quot;emotional attachment&quot; it stirs in readers, because it is almost completely nostalgia in contrast to Bradbury&#x27;s usual blend of horror/science fiction and nostalgia. He stated that this trait was what set it apart from his other works:

Certainly I would tell anyone wanting to know what makes Ray Bradbury the human being he is to read &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot;, and anyone wanting to know what makes Ray Bradbury the renowned writer he is to read &quot;The October Country&quot; or &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;.

The novel&#x27;s heavy reliance on poetical imagery has produced mixed criticism. Many critics say that these are the novel&#x27;s greatest strengths because the tone matches the spirit of Bradbury&#x27;s memories and optimistic outlook. John Zuck classified it as &quot;spiritual fiction,&quot; paying particular attention to the religious theme of holding on to ephemeral beauty, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the short-lived summer. Floyd C. Gale wrote that &quot;Admirers of Bradbury will welcome this tender volume and even his decriers will find passages of pure evocative magic to soften their flinty hearts&quot;.

Other critics, however, label this style as overwrought and too &quot;feel-good&quot;. Alan David Price stated that while &quot;Bradbury is at his most effective when evoking a New World joy and optimism&quot;, there are times when his prose becomes overly sentimental and his &quot;gently fantastic style becomes plain tiring&quot;. He nonetheless classifies &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; as &quot;an engrossing read&quot;.

The noted critic and author Damon Knight was also downbeat:

Childhood is Bradbury&#x27;s one subject, but you will not find real childhood here, Bradbury&#x27;s least of all. What he has had to say about it has always been expressed obliquely, in symbol and allusion, and always with the tension of the outsider—the ex-child, the lonely one. In giving up this tension, in diving with arms spread into the glutinous pool of sentimentality that has always been waiting for him, Bradbury has renounced the one thing that made him worth reading.

Knight remarks further that &quot;The period is as vague as the place; Bradbury calls it 1928, but it has no feeling of genuine recollection; most of the time it is like second-hand 1910.&quot;

==Sequel==
&quot;Farewell Summer&quot;, published in 2006, is Bradbury&#x27;s sequel to &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot;.

==Film, television, theatrical and radio adaptations==
The first stage adaptation of &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; was a 1975 production in New York City arranged and adapted by Peter John Bailey, directed by William Woodman, and starring Matthew Anton and Doug McKeon. It was produced by The New Phoenix Repertory Company, under the artistic direction of Stephen Porter and Harold Prince. The production was reviewed by Mel Gussow of the &quot;New York Times&quot; on February 8, 1975.

Bradbury co-wrote a musical of &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; in 1988 with Jimmy Webb. It was workshopped at the University of Tulsa and directed by Dr. Nancy Vunovich in 1989. Webb and Bradbury were in attendance. 

A stage production was done in 1992 in Manistee Michigan. Ray Bradbury was present at the Ramsdell theater for the opening night.

The novel was also made into a 1997 Russian film adaptation, titled &quot;Vino iz oduvanchikov&quot;. Currently, there is no English film adaptation available for the book.

&quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; was produced as a full-cast radio play by the Colonial Radio Theatre on the Air, in 2006. Ray Bradbury wrote the script from his stage play, and the production was released by Blackstone Audio. The cast included Jerry Robbins as Bill Forrester, William Humphrey as Douglas Spaulding, Rik Pierce as Grandpa, and James McLean as Tom Spaulding. The production was directed by Nancy Curran Willis, with music by Jeffrey Gage, and was produced by Jerry Robbins.

After hearing the production, Ray Bradbury sent a letter to producer Jerry Robbins: &quot;I&#x27;ve just played for the second time your production of &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; and it&#x27;s fabulous. I&#x27;m so very proud of it. In fact, it made me weep. In your own way you&#x27;ve told me that I have a chance of part of me living beyond the day that I leave this earth. This production is simply incredible.&quot; Phil Nichols of www.Bradburymedia.co.uk said of this recording, &quot;The audio production is extravagant, and benefits from some strong performances and an extensive musical score...one of the most lively and energetic Bradbury productions for many years.&quot; The production won the Ogle Award for best Fantasy Production of 2006.

In August 2011, Hollywood producers Mike Medavoy and Doug McKay of Phoenix Pictures announced a new American feature adaptation of &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot;, destined for release in 2012 or 2013. Bradbury, RGI Productions&#x27; husband and wife team Rodion Nahapetov and Natasha Shliapnikoff are working with Medavoy and McKay to produce the adaptation, with Nahapetov penning the script.

In 2011, BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcast an adaptation of Bradbury&#x27;s novel. This was repeated annually until at least 2014.

==In popular culture==
* In 1971, the Apollo 15 astronauts named a Moon crater &quot;Dandelion&quot; to honor Bradbury&#x27;s novel.
* &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot;, a song from Blackmore&#x27;s Night&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Ghost of a Rose&quot;, is named after the novel and shares with it the theme of childhood memories in the summer.
* In the 2014 horror adventure game &quot;The Vanishing of Ethan Carter&quot;, the protagonist&#x27;s name is shown on the cover of a fictional science fiction magazine as the featured author of a story set on Mars, a reference to author Ray Bradbury&#x27;s 1950 book &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;. The game contains a theme of a child&#x27;s imagination much like &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot;.
* Gregory Alan Isakov&#x27;s song &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; is named after the novel.
* The book is shown in the 2015 film &quot;The Age of Adaline&quot;.

<text>Moustache wax is a stiff pomade applied to a moustache as a grooming aid to hold the hairs in place, especially at the extremities. The required product strength (or stiffness) is based on whisker length and the desired style. It can also have restorative properties, which become more important as the hair length increases. The wax is usually scented and sometimes pigmented with dyes; high end products utilize various combinations of iron oxide to create darker shades.

Generally less than a fingernail of wax is used when applied. More sophisticated recipes may include gum arabic and a soap, scent and colouring may also be added if desired, to either strengthen the hold or for comfort.

==Common ingredients==

*Beeswax
*Coconut oil or shea nut butter (or any saturated vegetable oil, solid at room temperature, and not prone to rancidity)
*Lanolin
*Petroleum jelly (Vaseline)
*Gum arabic or pine resin
*Scented oils
*Tallow

In addition to the wax itself, more-experienced &quot;waxers&quot; use a moustache wax remover and conditioner. The reason for this is that warm soapy water (used by the novice) removes wax build-up but damages the bristles by stripping them of natural oils, so an oilbased moustache wax remover, that may double as a leavein conditioner, is preferred by some.

<text>Alpetragius is a lunar impact crater located on the eastern edge of Mare Nubium, to the southwest of the much larger crater Alphonsus. In the southeast is the prominent crater Arzachel, and to the west lies the flooded Lassell. Alpetragius is a Latinization of the name of Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji, a Spanish-Arab astronomer. 

The most notable feature of this crater is the disproportionately large central peak, which forms a rounded rise that occupies almost the entire crater floor—one-third the crater diameter—and rises to a height of 2.0 km. There is evidence that this peak has been enlarged through volcanic eruptions, and there appears to be an eroded vent at its summit. The rim has fine terraces that slope down to near the edge of the central rise along the south and east sides. This outer wall is nearly round, with slight protrusions on the north and west sides.
The outer rim is joined to the southwest rim of Alphonsus by a rise in the surface. An arc of craterous depressions from the south rim of Alphonsus curves to the west, dividing Alpetragius from Arzachel crater. To the west-northwest is the crater-like outline of Alpetragius X, now flooded by the mare and overlain across the east by ejecta from Alpetragius. Alpetragius is similar in appearance to Behaim crater, although Behaim is larger.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Alpetragius.

<text>Wanamaker, originally known as John Wanamaker Department Store, was one of the first department stores in the United States. Founded by John Wanamaker in Philadelphia in 1861, it was influential in the development of the retail industry including as the first store to use price tags.

At its zenith in the early 20th century, Wanamaker&#x27;s also had a store in New York City at Broadway and 9th Street in Manhattan. Both employed extremely large staffs. By the end of the 20th century, there were 16 Wanamaker&#x27;s outlets. After years of change, the chain was bought by A. Alfred Taubman in late 1986, and added to Taubman&#x27;s previous purchase of Woodward &amp; Lothrop, the Washington, D.C., department store.

In 1994, Woodies, as it was known, filed for bankruptcy. The assets of Woodies were purchased by the May Company Department Stores and JCPenney. In 1995, Wanamaker&#x27;s transitioned to Hecht&#x27;s, one of the May Company brands.

In 2006, Macy&#x27;s opened in the former Philadelphia Wanamaker&#x27;s Department Store, now called Macy&#x27;s Center City. The building is a National Historic Landmark. One of its expansions was designed by master architect Daniel Burnham. It contains the Wanamaker Organ, the largest functional organ in the world.

In January 2025, Macy&#x27;s announced that the Macy&#x27;s store in the Wanamaker Building was closing in March 2025 as part of Macy&#x27;s closing of 66 stores that were underperforming.

==History==
===19th century===


John Wanamaker was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1838. Due to a persistent cough, he was unable to join the U.S. Army to fight in the American Civil War, so instead started a career in business.

In 1861, he and his brother-in-law Nathan Brown founded a men&#x27;s clothing store in Philadelphia called Oak Hall. Wanamaker carried on the business alone after Brown&#x27;s death in 1868. Eight years later, Wanamaker purchased the abandoned Pennsylvania Railroad station for use as a new, larger retail location. The concept was to renovate the terminal into a &quot;Grand Depot&quot; similar to London&#x27;s Royal Exchange or Paris&#x27;s Les Halles and forerunners of the modern department store that were well known in Europe at that time.

The Wanamaker&#x27;s Grand Depot opened in time to service the public visiting Philadelphia for the American Centennial Exposition of 1876, and in fact resembled one of the many pavilions at that world&#x27;s fair because of its fanciful new Moorish Revival façade. In 1877, the interior of Wanamaker&#x27;s was refurbished and expanded to include not only men&#x27;s clothing, but women&#x27;s clothing and dry goods as well. This was Philadelphia&#x27;s first modern-day department store, and one of the earliest founded in America. A circular counter was placed at the center of the building, and concentric circles radiated around it with 129 counters of goods. The store also accepted mail orders, though it was not a large business until the early twentieth century.

Wanamaker first thought of how he would run a store on new principles when, as a youth, a merchant refused his request to exchange a purchase. A practicing Christian, he chose not to advertise on Sundays. Before he opened his Grand Depot for retail business, he let evangelist Dwight L. Moody use its facilities as a meeting place, while Wanamaker provided 300 ushers from his store personnel. His retail advertisements—the first to be copyrighted beginning in 1874—were factual, and promises made in them were kept.

Wanamaker guaranteed the quality of his merchandise in print, allowed his customers to return purchases for a cash refund and offered the first restaurant to be located inside a department store. Wanamaker also invented the price tag.

His employees were to be treated respectfully by management (including not being scolded in public), and John Wanamaker &amp; Company offered its employees access to the John Wanamaker Commercial Institute, as well as free medical care, recreational facilities, profit sharing plans, and pensions—long before these types of benefits were considered standard in corporate employment.

Innovation and &quot;firsts&quot; marked Wanamaker&#x27;s. The store was the first department store with electrical illumination (1878), first store with a telephone (1879), and the first store to install pneumatic tubes to transport cash and documents (1880).

Wanamaker&#x27;s commissioned a Philadelphia/New Jersey artist, George Washington Nicholson (1832–1912), to paint a large landscape mural, &quot;The Old Homestead&quot;, which was finished in March 1892. The mural was still owned by Wanamaker&#x27;s in 1950, but has since passed into a private collection.

===20th century===

In 1910, Wanamaker replaced his Grand Depot in stages, and constructed a new, purpose-built structure on the same site in Center City Philadelphia. The new store, built in the Florentine style with granite walls by Chicago architect Daniel H. Burnham, had 12 floors (nine for retail), numerous galleries and two lower levels totaling nearly two million square feet. The palatial emporium featured the Wanamaker Organ, the former St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair pipe organ, at the time one of the world&#x27;s largest organs. The organ was installed in the store&#x27;s marble-clad central atrium known as the Grand Court. Another item from the St. Louis Fair in the Grand Court is the large bronze eagle, which quickly became the symbol of the store and a favorite meeting place for shoppers. All one had to say was &quot;Meet You at The Eagle&quot; and everyone knew where to go. The store was dedicated by President William Howard Taft on December 30, 1911.

Despite its size, the organ was deemed insufficient to fill the Grand Court with its music. Wanamaker&#x27;s responded by assembling its own staff of organ builders and expanding the organ several times over a period of years. The &quot;Wanamaker Organ&quot; is the largest fully operational pipe organ in the world, with some 28,750 pipes. It is famed for the delicate, orchestra-like beauty of its tone as well as its incredible power. The organ still stands in place in the store today and free recitals are held twice every day except Sunday. Visitors are also invited to tour the organ&#x27;s console area and meet with staff after recitals. Once a year, usually in June, &quot;Wanamaker Organ Day&quot; is held, which is a free recital which lasts most of the day. The New York store also housed a large organ; it was sold at auction in 1955 for $1,200 (~$ in ) after the New York store closed the year prior.

News of the &quot;Titanic&#x27;s&quot; sinking was transmitted to Wanamaker&#x27;s wireless station in New York City, and given to anxious crowds waiting outside—yet another first for an American retail store. Public Christmas Caroling in the store&#x27;s Grand Court began in 1918.

In 1919, , a Spanish newspaper, reported that Wanamaker&#x27;s New York store had 100 specialized departments all under one roof, including a (The Department of Personal Service for Latin-Americans).

Other innovations included employing buyers to travel overseas to Europe each year for the latest fashions, the first White sale (1878) and other themed sales such as the February &quot;Opportunity Sales&quot; to keep prices as low as possible while keeping volume high. The store also broadcast its organ concerts on the Wanamaker-owned radio station WOO beginning in 1922. Under the leadership of James Bayard Woodford, Wanamaker&#x27;s opened piano stores in Philadelphia and New York that did a huge business with an innovative fixed-price system of sales. Salons in period decor were used to sell the higher-price items. Wanamaker also tried selling small organs built by the Austin Organ Company for a time.

After John Wanamaker&#x27;s death in 1922, the business carried on under Wanamaker family ownership. Rodman Wanamaker, John&#x27;s son, enhanced the reputation of the stores as artistic centers and temples of the beautiful, offering imported luxuries from around the world. After his death in 1928, the stores (managed for the family by a trust) continued to thrive for a time. The men&#x27;s clothing and accessories department was expanded into its own separate store on the lower floors of the Lincoln-Liberty Building, two doors down on Chestnut Street, in 1932. This building, which also had a private apartment for the Wanamaker family on its top floor, was sold to Philadelphia National Bank in 1952; the initials on the building&#x27;s crown read &quot;PNB&quot; until November 2014, even though the bank no longer existed.

====Christmas Light Show====
In 1956, the Philadelphia Wanamaker&#x27;s premiered a Christmas Light Show, a large musical and blinking light display several stories high, viewable from several levels of the building. Its popularity with Philadelphia parents and children, as well as tourists, ensured a continuous run, even after the building was sold to different business interests.

For decades until 1994, the melodic baritone narrator of the show was John Facenda, known to Philadelphians for decades reporting the news on radio and television and known nationally as the voice of NFL Films. NFL Films&#x27; Ed Sabol referred to Facenda as &quot;The Voice of God&quot;. His wordsmithing and dramatic baritone delivery were highlights of the shows and did much to boost Facenda&#x27;s stock and mystique. Various announcers narrated the show between 1995 and 2005.

In the late 20th century, Wanamaker&#x27;s lost business to other retail chains, including Bloomingdale&#x27;s and Macy&#x27;s, in the Philadelphia market. The Wanamaker Family Trust finally sold John Wanamaker and Company, with its underpatronized stores, to Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale Stores for US$60 million (~$ in ) cash in 1978. Carter Hawley Hale poured another $80 million into renovating the stores, but to no avail—customers had gone elsewhere in the intervening decades and did not come back.

In late 1986, the now 15-store chain was sold to Woodward &amp; Lothrop, owned by Detroit shopping-mall magnate A. Alfred Taubman, for around $180 million (~$ in ). Taubman reorganized the business with a shortened corporate name (Wanamaker&#x27;s Inc.), and poured millions more into store renovations and public relations campaigns. This too was no help, as Taubman&#x27;s retail interests were heavily in debt and the stores&#x27; combined sales were a disappointment.

Believing that the Wanamaker Building space was more valuable than portions of the historic Wanamaker store, the Philadelphia flagship store was reduced to its first five stories, the Juniper Street side became the lobby of an office building for the upper stories, and the former basement budget &quot;Downstairs Store&quot; became a parking garage. The Crystal Tea Room restaurant was closed and eventually leased to the Marriott Corporation for use as a ballroom. Personal effects of Mr. Wanamaker from his until-then preserved office on the eighth floor, and the store archives, were donated to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. In October 1987, the Wanamaker Building was sold to developer John Kusmiersky. Beloved huge Easter paintings &quot;Christ before Pilate&quot; (1881) and &quot;Golgotha&quot; (1884) by Mihály Munkácsy that had been personal favorites of Mr. Wanamaker and were displayed every year in the Grand Court during Lent were unceremoniously sold at auction in 1988.

Woodward &amp; Lothrop collapsed in bankruptcy, filing for Chapter 11 on January 17, 1994, and with it the Wanamaker stores, which were sold to May Department Stores Company on June 21, 1995. Wanamaker&#x27;s Inc. was formally dissolved, and operations were consolidated with May&#x27;s Hecht&#x27;s division in Arlington, Virginia. After 133 consecutive years, the Wanamaker&#x27;s name was removed from all stores and replaced with Hecht&#x27;s. In 1997, May acquired Wanamaker&#x27;s historic rival Strawbridge &amp; Clothier and re-branded all Philadelphia-area Hecht&#x27;s locations with the Strawbridge&#x27;s name. The Center City Hecht&#x27;s (temporarily named Strawbridge&#x27;s) was closed for a lengthy renovation and refurbishment that saw the former Wanamaker retail space reduced in size again to three floors, and the former selling floors on the upper floors further subdivided into commercial office space. This was to prepare the way, in 1997, for New York-based Lord &amp; Taylor, another division of May Department Stores, to open in the former Wanamaker&#x27;s flagship in Center City Philadelphia. In August 2006 the store was converted to Macy&#x27;s, operated by the Macy&#x27;s East Division of Federated Department Stores Inc., now Macy&#x27;s, Inc., which acquired May in late 2005. The New York Wanamaker&#x27;s store on Broadway had retail space occupied by Kmart by 1996, and later Wegmans (2023).

The store was not immune to the major change in retailing away from regional chains to national chains. The uniformity of brand offerings and the cost savings available to national chains all worked against the viability of the store as an independent personality, although customers generally had a major say in determining store offerings and the magnificence of its commercial space did tend to cause it to be stocked with better offerings. Other retailers had also learned to offer goods with much smaller staff rosters. The ability of retailers to go national in opposition to regional tastes is still an experiment-in-progress with mixed results.

The Wanamaker&#x27;s flagship store, with its famous organ and eagle from the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978. In 1992, a nonprofit group, the Friends of the Wanamaker Organ, was founded to promote the preservation, restoration and presentation of the famous pipe organ.

As a retail site, the Philadelphia flagship store has proved profitable for later tenants Lord &amp; Taylor and now Macy&#x27;s. With a long tradition of parades and fireworks displays, Macy&#x27;s has taken a prominent civic role in fostering historic Wanamaker traditions, especially the Wanamaker Organ and the Christmas Light Show.

===21st century===
Beginning in 2006, under Macy&#x27;s, Julie Andrews became the show&#x27;s narrator. Also in 2006, the Santa Express Train at the top of the Grand Court returned.
In 2007, the entire Christmas Light Show was completely modernized and rebuilt by Macy&#x27;s Parade Studio on new trusses with lighter materials and LED lighting. In 2008, a new and bigger Magic Christmas Tree with LED lights debuted. However, due to safety concerns and logistical issues, the dancing water fountains were retired and sold.

In 2008, Macy&#x27;s celebrated its 150th birthday in the Philadelphia flagship store with a concert featuring the Wanamaker Organ and the Philadelphia Orchestra that attracted a capacity audience. Currently only 3 floors of the building are still used as department store sales area.

In September 2023 the building went into receivership after a substantial loss of its commercial tenants. As of January 2024 the owners were considering the possibility of converting the building to residential spaces.

On January 9, 2025 Macy&#x27;s announced that the Wanamaker Building store would be closing in March 2025.

==Flagship store setup==
* Ground floor: 2,500-pound &quot;Durana&quot; bronze eagle statue in the Grand Court, made by German sculptor August Gaul for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exhibition and purchased by John Wanamaker; to this day, Philadelphians frequently agree to &quot;meet me at the eagle&quot; at Wanamaker&#x27;s.

===Crystal Tea Room===

Wanamaker&#x27;s also was home to the Crystal Tea Room restaurant on the 9th floor, which closed to the public in 1995; it was restored as a private banquet hall, accommodating sit-down receptions of up to 1,000 people. A Wanamaker&#x27;s guidebook from the 1920s states that the Crystal Tea Room was the largest dining room in Philadelphia, and one of the largest in the world. It once could serve 1,400 people at a time. It served breakfast in the morning, luncheon, and afternoon tea. The kitchen&#x27;s big ovens could roast 75 turkeys at a time and the facility was equipped with lockers and baths for the employees. In acknowledgment of John Wanamaker&#x27;s promotion of temperance causes, alcohol was not served in the Tea Room until after the family trust sold the store. There was informal modeling in the Tea Room.

There was also a balcony café, the Terrace on the Court, on the third floor facing the Grand Court, where shoppers could hear the Wanamaker Organ as they dined. Macy&#x27;s closed this restaurant in 2008.

== Suburban branch stores ==
Wanamaker&#x27;s opened a store in Wilmington, Delaware in 1950. After the New York store closed in 1954, Wanamaker&#x27;s expanded to the Philadelphia suburbs, starting with the Wynnewood store in December 1954. The second suburban branch opened in 1958 in Jenkintown, not far from the Strawbridge and Clothier store. The store at Moorestown Mall opened in 1963. Other prominent suburban branch stores included King of Prussia Mall (1963), Harrisburg Mall (1969), Berkshire Mall (1970), Oxford Valley Mall (1973), Springfield Mall (1974), Deptford Mall (1975), Roosevelt Mall (1976), Lehigh Valley Mall (1976), Montgomery Mall (1977) and Christiana Mall (1991, last Wanamaker&#x27;s store built).

==In popular culture==
* In the 1950 musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, in the song &quot;Marry the Man Today&quot;, Adelaide sings the line, &quot;In Wanamaker&#x27;s and Saks and Klein&#x27;s, a lesson I&#x27;ve been taught. You can&#x27;t make alterations on a dress you haven&#x27;t bought.&quot;
* In 1981, scenes in the film &quot;Blow Out&quot; were filmed outside Wanamaker&#x27;s.
* In 1987, much of the movie &quot;Mannequin&quot; was filmed at Wanamaker&#x27;s, as was the 1991 sequel, &quot;Mannequin Two: On the Move&quot;.
* In 2006, in the HBO TV series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, jailed Lupertazzi crime boss, John &quot;Johnny Sack&quot; Sacramoni, tells his lawyer that he met his wife Ginny while she was working at the tie counter at Wanamaker&#x27;s.

<text>Anville is a relatively small, solitary lunar impact crater located in the north part of the Mare Fecunditatis. It is named after French cartographer Jean-Baptiste d&#x27;Anville. This is a circular, cup-shaped formation with a sharp edge and little appearance of wear. Some minor slumping has occurred in the eastern half of the interior wall. It was designated Taruntius G prior to being assigned a name by the IAU. Taruntius itself lies to the north-northwest, at the edge of the mare.

<doc id="975647" wikidata="Q7672922" url="?curid=975647" title="Tabarak Dar">
<text>Tabarak Dar (; born 3 May 1976) is a Pakistani-born former international cricketer who played for Hong Kong and is now an umpire.

Dar played as a specialist batsman, though his medium-pace bowling yielded seven wickets at the 2001 ICC Trophy, which was his international debut event. Dar played two first-class matches and four One Day Internationals (ODIs) for Hong Kong.

== Playing career ==
Dar took four for 34 from six overs in his first official match for Hong Kong, a 49-run loss to the United States in the third match of the 2001 ICC Trophy. He also made 19 with the bat, but scored at a rate of 3.8 an over, well below the required rate to chase the target of 245.

The next two matches saw him promoted in the bowling order, first to second change against Papua New Guinea where he took two wickets but did not bat in a 106-run win, and he opened the bowling against Bermuda, taking one wicket for 30 runs. Batting at six, however, he could only make three against Bermuda, as Hong Kong fell to 102 all out and lost by 104 runs.

Dar remained in the team for the 2004 Asia Cup, and top scored in both matches, making 20 against Bangladesh and 36 off 43 balls against Pakistan. His ODI batting average of 28 is thus the highest by any Hong Kong cricketer. However, he could not prevent Hong Kong being knocked out at the group stage, after losses by 116 and 173 runs respectively.

Dar also played in the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup, but was dismissed in single figures in all three innings, as Hong Kong finished on the bottom of the Asian group. Hong Kong finished fifth at the Asian Cricket Council Fast Track Tournament.

Dar was named Hong Kong team captain in 2006 and played in various ACC and ICC matches till 2009. Dar led the Hong Kong team to their first ever ACC trophy championship in 2008 in Malaysia. Hong Kong beat Afghanistan in the semi-final and UAE in the final. Later that year, Dar led the Hong Kong team in the 2008 Asia Cup held in Karachi. Hong Kong played their first match against Pakistan and second against India. Dar was the highest scorer for Hong Kong in both matches.

== Umpiring career ==
Dar made his international umpiring debut in a Twenty20 International between Hong Kong and Scotland in January 2016. He stood in his first One Day International match between Hong Kong and Papua New Guinea on 4 November 2016. In April 2019, he was named as one of the eight on-field umpires for the 2019 ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament in Namibia.

<text>March Fong Eu (; March 29, 1922 – December 21, 2017) was an American diplomat and politician who served as the 24th secretary of state of California for five terms from 1975 to 1994. A member of the Democratic Party, she served in the California State Assembly from 1967 to 1974 and later as the United States ambassador to Micronesia under Bill Clinton from 1994 to 1996.

The daughter of Chinese immigrants, Eu was the first Asian American woman to hold statewide constitutional office in the United States and was also the first woman to serve as Secretary of State of California. She is the adoptive mother of Matt Fong, a Republican who served one term as treasurer of California.

== Early life and education ==
Eu was born March Kong on March 29, 1922, in Oakdale, California, a city in the San Joaquin Valley, where her Chinese immigrant parents Yuen Kong and Shiu Shee ran a hand-wash laundry. Her grandparents immigrated to the U.S. from Huaxian County (now Huadu District) in the South China province of Guangdong. The family later moved to Richmond, California.

Eu earned a Bachelor of Science in dentistry from the University of California, Berkeley in 1943 and a Master of Education from Mills College. She earned an Ed.D. from the Stanford Graduate School of Education in 1954.

== Career ==

She became a dental hygienist working in the Oakland Unified School District and served a term as president of the American Dental Hygienist Association. She served on the Alameda County Board of Education from 1954 to 1964.

=== California State Assembly ===
In 1966, Eu was elected as a Democrat to the California State Assembly from the 15th District, representing Oakland and Castro Valley. She served four terms. She is perhaps best known for her successful campaign to ban pay toilets, arguing that they discriminated against women since urinals were free.
=== California Secretary of State ===
Eu was elected Secretary of State of California in 1974, becoming the first Asian American woman ever elected to a state constitutional office in the United States. She remained the only woman to serve as California Secretary of State until 2006, when voters elected Debra Bowen. Eu was elected Secretary of State five times. In 1978 she won every county in the state, even heavily Republican Orange County, making her one of only five Democrats to win the county in a statewide race in the last half century. She resigned in 1994 when President Bill Clinton nominated her for an ambassadorship.

Innovations she introduced during her 19 years as Secretary of State included voter registration by mail; providing absentee ballots to anyone who requested them; posting results on the Internet; and including candidate statements in ballot pamphlets. In 1976, she became the first woman to serve as Governor of California, serving as acting governor while Governor Jerry Brown was out of the state.

=== Later career ===
In 1987, Eu was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate, running against Leo McCarthy for the right to challenge the Republican incumbent, Pete Wilson. Amid poor fundraising totals and her husband&#x27;s unwillingness to release details of his business interests, Eu dropped out later that year.

President Bill Clinton appointed Eu as United States Ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia in 1994. She served in that post until 1996, when she resigned to work on Clinton&#x27;s re-election campaign.

Eu campaigned for her son Matt in the 1998 U.S. Senate election, when he was the Republican nominee against incumbent Democratic senator Barbara Boxer. In 2002, Eu, then age 79, ran again for Secretary of State, saying she was doing so because &quot;Florida made me angry&quot;, referring to the voting problems in Florida during the 2000 United States presidential election. She lost in the Democratic primary to Kevin Shelley, who went on to win the election.

== Personal life and death ==
Eu resided both in California and Singapore with her second husband Henry Eu, a multimillionaire industrialist. Eu was assaulted by a burglar who broke into her Hancock Park home in 1986. Her adopted son, Matt Fong, was a Republican activist who served as California State Treasurer for a four-year term that began January 1995. She also had a daughter, Suyin. Her hobbies in retirement included Chinese brush painting and calligraphy. Eu died in Irvine, California, on December 21, 2017, following a fall; she was 95 years old.

== Recognition ==
In 2019 California&#x27;s Secretary of State building in Sacramento was named after Eu (as the March Fong Eu Secretary of State Building); this made it the first state-owned building to be named for an Asian-American woman.

The National Notary Association gives an annual March Fong Eu Award to &quot;the individual who or organization that, in the judgment of the Association&#x27;s Executive Committee, has done the most to improve the standards, image and quality of the office of Notary Public.&quot; Eu was the first recipient of the award in 1979, named after her &quot;for her extraordinary leadership in spearheading enactment of progressive Notary reform legislation, despite opposition from powerful lobbies who preferred lower notarial standards.&quot;

<text>Alexander Niall French (born 1 December 1980) is a Hong Kong cricketer who has played two One Day Internationals and nine ICC Trophy matches for Hong Kong. French made his debut aged 16 at the 1997 ICC Trophy in Malaysia, and played four matches, scoring 22 runs with a highest score of 13 in the debut match against Italy. Despite having the third-worst batting average of the entire team — only ahead of Steven Foster and specialist bowler Mohamed Zubair — French was also in the squad for the 2001 ICC Trophy, where he managed to contribute even less. In four innings, he compiled five runs, although his off breaks also yielded three wickets — all falling in losing causes. French&#x27;s batting average of 1.25 in the tournament was now the second-worst, although three wickets was the fifth-best of the team.

Though his batting performances thus far had been less than impressive, French was retained for the 2004 Asia Cup, and was even chosen to bat at number three, usually the position occupied by the best batsman. He made double figure scores against both Bangladesh and Pakistan, but it was not enough to stay in the team for the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup. French has also played for Cardiff UCCE, Glamorgan&#x27;s Second XI, and Wales Minor Counties.

<doc id="975654" wikidata="Q626519" url="?curid=975654" title="Aratus (crater)">
<text>Aratus is a small lunar impact crater located on the highland to the south and east of the rugged Montes Apenninus range. It is a circular, cup-shaped crater with a relatively high albedo. It was named after Greek astronomer Aratus of Soli. To the east is the Mare Serenitatis, and to the southwest is the somewhat larger crater Conon. North-northeast of Aratus is the landing site of the Apollo 15 mission, just beyond Mons Hadley Delta.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Aratus.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Aratus A—&quot;See&quot; Galen (crater).
==Aratus CA==
This three-pronged feature is located in western Mare Serenitatis. It is formed from a merged group of depressions in the lunar surface, and may be a volcanic vent. The dimensions are with an estimated depth.

The three elongated depressions have been given individual names:

Two small craters in the vicinity of Aratus CA have also been assigned names:
Manuel is just beyond the eastern tip of Vallis Krishna, while Yoshi is just beyond the western tip of Vallis Christel. Manuel is very difficult to see, even on high-resolution photos.

The five names listed above first appeared on the Defense Mapping Agency&#x27;s Topophotomaps 42A4/S1 and 42A4/S2 and were approved by the IAU in 1976. Because of a ban on the use of lettered crater names that was in effect at the time those maps were prepared, Aratus CA was given the provisional new name Lorca. The name Lorca was never approved by the IAU, despite notations to the contrary on Defense Mapping Agency maps LM-41 and LM-42, and the former name Aratus CA (which had first appeared on LAC-42, published in 1965 ) was officially re-adopted by the IAU in 2006.

Trending to the north from Aratus CA is a wrinkle ridge in the surface that has been designated Dorsum Owen. To the east is a longer, parallel wrinkle-ridge named Dorsum von Cotta. Further to the north-northeast is Linné, surrounded by a bright skirt of high-albedo material. About the same distance to the southwest is the Montes Haemus mountain range at the edge of the lunar mare.

The selenographic colongitude of this grouping at dawn is 349°.

<text>John Patrick Roy Lamsam (born 15 May 1980) is a Hong Kong cricketer who has played 8 One Day Internationals and four ICC Trophy matches between 1997 and 2008. He is a specialist batsman who has batted between five and eight in the batting order for Hong Kong, scoring 15 ICC Trophy runs and 24 One Day International runs. In his debut match in the ICC Trophy, he was the seventh-choice bowler for Hong Kong, bowling the final over against Canada. However, he first bowled two wides (one of which was run for three), and then was injured. Because of the runs off wides counting against the bowler, but the wide not counting as a ball bowled, Lamsam ended with no balls bowled - and four runs conceded. As that was his only bowling in the ICC Trophy, this is still his career record.

Lamsam was selected to play for Hong Kong in the 2004 Asia Cup, scoring eight runs and taking zero wickets against Bangladesh. He played a second ODI against India at the 2008 Asia Cup, scoring 16 before being run out by MS Dhoni.

<text>Sher Lama (born 9 January 1973) is a Nepali born Hong Kong cricketer who has played one One Day International and four ICC Trophy matches for Hong Kong. He is the first Nepal-born cricketer to play a One Day International when he debuted against Bangladesh in 2004 Asia cup. His only One Day International saw him hit 16 unbeaten runs against Bangladesh at the 2004 Asia Cup from number nine in the batting order, which was the second-highest score of the Hong Kong innings. However, it did not prevent him being left out of the second match against Pakistan. Lama also played four matches at the 2001 ICC Trophy, scoring 38 runs with the highest score of 19 (against United States) and bowling 16 overs without taking a wicket. He has also coached Hong Kong national women&#x27;s team.

<text>Khalid Khan (born 7 February 1971) is a Hong Kong cricketer who has played two One Day Internationals and two first class matches for Hong Kong. He is a seam bowler who has been named at 10 or 11 in the batting order, making a total of five international runs, but he has also got three wickets in official internationals - those of Khaled Mashud and both Pakistani openers, Imran Nazir and Imran Farhat, at the 2004 Asia Cup.

Khan&#x27;s first class cricket career began on 24 April 2005 in Sharjah against the United Arab Emirates, where he took a wicket with his third ball, dismissing Asghar Ali lbw. In his next over, number three Fahad Usman was bowled, but his next wicket came two hours later, with the number 11 Rizwan Latif bowled as the UAE were bowled out for 127, the same score that Hong Kong had made in the first innings, where Khan had hit his first boundary before he was bowled by Latif. Despite a second innings total of 184, however, Hong Kong failed to defend the total as Khan only got one more wicket - Asghar Ali lbw again.

In his next match against Nepal rain struck to shorten the match to 78 overs in three days, and Khan bowled 11 of those without reward, but he did make a career highest score of nine runs from number 11 - an unbeaten score.

<text>Argelander is a lunar impact crater that is located in the south-central highlands of the Moon. It was named after the German astronomer Friedrich Argelander. It lies in the midpoint between the smaller crater Vogel in the north and the larger Airy to the south. To the northwest is the worn remnant of Parrot. Just to the west is a shallow cleft in the surface that follows a course to the north-northwest, intersecting the southeast rim of Parrot.

The rim of Argelander is somewhat worn and indented, although less distorted than Airy to the south. The bottom is relatively flat and there is a small central rise. There is a curved depression in the surface following the western rim, giving the wall a on that side.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Argelander.
