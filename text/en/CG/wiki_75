<text>In the gravitational two-body problem, the specific orbital energy formula_1 (or specific &quot;vis-viva&quot; energy) of two orbiting bodies is the constant quotient of their mechanical energy (the sum of their mutual potential energy, formula_2, and their kinetic energy, formula_3) to their reduced mass. 

According to the orbital energy conservation equation (also referred to as &quot;vis-viva&quot; equation), it does not vary with time:
formula_4
where
*formula_5 is the relative orbital speed;
*formula_6 is the orbital distance between the bodies;
*formula_7 is the sum of the standard gravitational parameters of the bodies;
*formula_8 is the specific relative angular momentum in the sense of relative angular momentum divided by the reduced mass;
*formula_9 is the orbital eccentricity;
*formula_10 is the semi-major axis.

It is a kind of specific energy, typically expressed in units of formula_11 (megajoule per kilogram) or formula_12 (squared kilometer per squared second). For an elliptic orbit the specific orbital energy is the negative of the additional energy required to accelerate a mass of one kilogram to escape velocity (parabolic orbit). For a hyperbolic orbit, it is equal to the excess energy compared to that of a parabolic orbit. In this case the specific orbital energy is also referred to as characteristic energy.

==Equation forms for different orbits==
For an elliptic orbit, the specific orbital energy equation, when combined with conservation of specific angular momentum at one of the orbit&#x27;s apsides, simplifies to:

formula_13
where
*formula_14 is the standard gravitational parameter;
*formula_10 is semi-major axis of the orbit.

For a parabolic orbit this equation simplifies to
formula_16

For a hyperbolic trajectory this specific orbital energy is either given by
formula_17

or the same as for an ellipse, depending on the convention for the sign of &quot;a&quot;.

In this case the specific orbital energy is also referred to as characteristic energy (or formula_18) and is equal to the excess specific energy compared to that for a parabolic orbit.

It is related to the hyperbolic excess velocity formula_19 (the orbital velocity at infinity) by
formula_20

It is relevant for interplanetary missions.

Thus, if orbital position vector (formula_21) and orbital velocity vector (formula_22) are known at one position, and formula_23 is known, then the energy can be computed and from that, for any other position, the orbital speed.

==Rate of change==

For an elliptic orbit the rate of change of the specific orbital energy with respect to a change in the semi-major axis is
formula_24
where
*formula_25 is the standard gravitational parameter;
*formula_26 is semi-major axis of the orbit.

In the case of circular orbits, this rate is one half of the gravitation at the orbit. This corresponds to the fact that for such orbits the total energy is one half of the potential energy, because the kinetic energy is minus one half of the potential energy.

==Additional energy==

If the central body has radius &quot;R&quot;, then the additional specific energy of an elliptic orbit compared to being stationary at the surface is

formula_27

The quantity formula_28 is the height the ellipse extends above the surface, plus the periapsis distance (the distance the ellipse extends beyond the center of the Earth). For the Earth and formula_10 just little more than formula_30 the additional specific energy is formula_31; which is the kinetic energy of the horizontal component of the velocity, i.e. formula_32, formula_33.

==Examples==
===ISS===
The International Space Station has an orbital period of 91.74 minutes (5504s), hence by Kepler&#x27;s Third Law the semi-major axis of its orbit is 6,738km.

The specific orbital energy associated with this orbit is −29.6MJ/kg: the potential energy is −59.2MJ/kg, and the kinetic energy 29.6MJ/kg. Compared with the potential energy at the surface, which is −62.6MJ/kg., the extra potential energy is 3.4MJ/kg, and the total extra energy is 33.0MJ/kg. The average speed is 7.7km/s, the net delta-v to reach this orbit is 8.1km/s (the actual delta-v is typically 1.5–2.0km/s more for atmospheric drag and gravity drag).

The increase per meter would be 4.4J/kg; this rate corresponds to one half of the local gravity of 8.8m/s2.

For an altitude of 100km (radius is 6471km):

The energy is −30.8MJ/kg: the potential energy is −61.6MJ/kg, and the kinetic energy 30.8MJ/kg. Compare with the potential energy at the surface, which is −62.6MJ/kg. The extra potential energy is 1.0MJ/kg, the total extra energy is 31.8MJ/kg.

The increase per meter would be 4.8J/kg; this rate corresponds to one half of the local gravity of 9.5m/s2. The speed is 7.8km/s, the net delta-v to reach this orbit is 8.0km/s.

Taking into account the rotation of the Earth, the delta-v is up to 0.46km/s less (starting at the equator and going east) or more (if going west).

===&quot;Voyager 1&quot;===
For &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, with respect to the Sun:

*formula_34 = 132,712,440,018 km3⋅s−2 is the standard gravitational parameter of the Sun
*&quot;r&quot; = 17 billion kilometers
*&quot;v&quot; = 17.1 km/s

Hence:
formula_35

Thus the hyperbolic excess velocity (the theoretical orbital velocity at infinity) is given by
formula_36

However, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; does not have enough velocity to leave the Milky Way. The computed speed applies far away from the Sun, but at such a position that the potential energy with respect to the Milky Way as a whole has changed negligibly, and only if there is no strong interaction with celestial bodies other than the Sun.

==Applying thrust==

Assume:
*a is the acceleration due to thrust (the time-rate at which delta-v is spent)
*g is the gravitational field strength
*v is the velocity of the rocket

Then the time-rate of change of the specific energy of the rocket is formula_37: an amount formula_38 for the kinetic energy and an amount formula_39 for the potential energy.

The change of the specific energy of the rocket per unit change of delta-v is
formula_40
which is |v| times the cosine of the angle between v and a.

Thus, when applying delta-v to increase specific orbital energy, this is done most efficiently if a is applied in the direction of v, and when |v| is large. If the angle between v and g is obtuse, for example in a launch and in a transfer to a higher orbit, this means applying the delta-v as early as possible and at full capacity. See also gravity drag. When passing by a celestial body it means applying thrust when nearest to the body. When gradually making an elliptic orbit larger, it means applying thrust each time when near the periapsis. Such maneuver is called an Oberth maneuver or powered flyby.

When applying delta-v to &quot;decrease&quot; specific orbital energy, this is done most efficiently if a is applied in the direction opposite to that of v, and again when |v| is large. If the angle between v and g is acute, for example in a landing (on a celestial body without atmosphere) and in a transfer to a circular orbit around a celestial body when arriving from outside, this means applying the delta-v as late as possible. When passing by a planet it means applying thrust when nearest to the planet. When gradually making an elliptic orbit smaller, it means applying thrust each time when near the periapsis.

If a is in the direction of v:
formula_41

<text>The Weldon process is a process developed in 1866 by Walter Weldon for recovering manganese dioxide for re-use in chlorine manufacture. Commercial operations started at the Gamble works in St. Helens in 1869. The process is described in considerable detail in the book, The Alkali Industry, by J.R. Partington,D.Sc.

The common method to manufacture chlorine at the time, was to react manganese dioxide (and related oxides) with hydrochloric acid to give chlorine:

: MnO2 + 4 HCl → MnCl2 + Cl2 + 2H2O

Weldon&#x27;s contribution was to develop a process to recycle the manganese. The waste manganese(II) chloride solution is treated with lime, steam and oxygen, producing calcium manganite(IV):

: 2 MnCl2 + 3 Ca(OH)2 + O2 → CaO·2MnO2 + 3 H2O + 2 CaCl2

The resulting calcium manganite can be reacted with HCl as in related processes:

: CaO·2MnO2 + 10 HCl → CaCl2 + 2 MnCl2 + 2 Cl2 + 5 H2O

The manganese(II) chloride can be recycled, while the calcium chloride is a waste byproduct.

The Weldon process was first replaced by the Deacon process and later by the Chloralkali process.

<doc id="997400" wikidata="Q25039726" url="?curid=997400" title="Power hitter">
<text>Power hitter is a term used in baseball for a skilled player that has a higher than average ability in terms of his batting, featuring a combination of dexterity and personal strength that likely leads to a high number of home runs as well as doubles and triples. In baseball, a power hitter typically bats fourth or &quot;cleanup&quot; in a Major League lineup, which consists of 9 hitters in a rotating order. 

In terms of detailed analysis, looking at a player&#x27;s ability as a power hitter often involves using statistics such as someone&#x27;s &#x27;slugging percentage&#x27; (a function that&#x27;s calculated by evaluating someone&#x27;s number of moments at bat in relation to the nature of their hits and strikes). &#x27;Isolated Power&#x27; (ISO), a measure showing the number of extra bases earned per time at bat that&#x27;s calculated by subtracting someone&#x27;s batting average from his slugging percentage, is another statistic used.

The concept generally is analogous to that of a power pitcher, a player who relies on the velocity of his pitches (perhaps at the expense of accuracy) and a high record of strikeout associated with them (statistics such as strikeouts per nine innings pitched are common measures).

==Famous power hitters in baseball history==
Barry Bonds, who set the record for the most home runs in a season in Major League Baseball history, is often cited as a power hitter. His career was later bogged down by allegations regarding performance enhancing drugs. However, he managed a total of 762 home runs while also earning a comparatively high ISO compared to his rivals, with the publication &quot;Business Insider&quot; labeling him #3 in a list of the greatest power hitters of all time.

Prior to Barry Bonds breaking the single season home run record in 2001, Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire closely competed for the record in 1998 with Sosa finishing at a respective 66 home runs and McGwire with a respective 70 home runs to secure the title.

Other baseball figures so cited include the famous hitters Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron, Lou Gehrig, and Ted Williams. Popular newspaper writer Victor O. Jones wrote about Williams in particular, &quot;Ted is lucky to come along in a baseball age that worships on the shrine of power, pure, unadulterated power.&quot;

<doc id="997405" wikidata="Q1699295" url="?curid=997405" title="John Beaumont, 4th Baron Beaumont">
<text>John Beaumont, 4th [[Baron Beaumont]] (1361–1396) was an English military commander and Admiral who served in the Hundred Years&#x27; War against the partisans of Antipope Clement VII.

==Origins==
John Beaumont was born in 1361 at Folkingham Castle, Lincolnshire, the only son of Henry Beaumont, 3rd Baron Beaumont (1340–1369), by his wife Margaret, daughter of John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford, by his wife Maud de Badlesmere. His paternal grandparents were John Beaumont, 2nd Baron Beaumont (aft. 1317–1342) and Eleanor of Lancaster (1318–1372), the fifth daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster (c. 1281–1345).

==Career==
He was knighted by King Edward III. He served in the French wars and against the partisans of Pope Clement VII. He accompanied John of Gaunt to Spain in the attempted conquest of Castile in 1386. He tilted against the Great Chamberlain of France in a tournament at Calais in 1388. In 1390 he tilted with the famous Boucicaut at St. Inghelbert. He was appointed Admiral of the North from 20 May 1388 – 22 June 1389 jointly with Sir John Roches. From 23 June 1389 until 22 March 1390, Admiral Lord Beaumont held the office solely. In 1389 he was briefly Warden of the West Marches towards Scotland. In 1392 he was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. In 1393 he was created a Knight of the Garter and was one of the Ambassadors to France to demand Princess Isabella in marriage for King Richard II.

==Marriage==
In 1389 he married Katherine Everingham (1367–1426/8), daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas Everingham, Knt. of Laxton, Nottinghamshire. They had the five children:
*Henry Beaumont, 5th Baron Beaumont (d.1413), eldest son and heir, who married Elizabeth Willoughby, daughter of William Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby de Eresby (c.1370–1409), by whom he had issue John Beaumont, 1st Viscount Beaumont KG, the first Viscount to be created in England. His daughter Elizabeth married Thomas Neville of Brancepeth, son of John Neville (died 1420)
*Richard Beaumont, 2nd son.
*Sir Thomas Beaumont, Lord of Bacqueville in France, 3rd son, who married Philippa Marward, daughter of Thomas Marward of Quartermarshe, Leicestershire. From this union descended the Beaumonts of Gracedieu in Leicestershire, the Beaumonts of Gittisham, near Honiton in Devon (inherited &quot;for the sake of the name&quot; from the also ancient but unrelated family of Beaumont of Shirwell in North Devon) and the Beaumonts of Coleorton in Leicestershire, which latter were the ancestors of the Beaumont baronets. His great grandson was John Beaumont
*Eleanora Beaumont, a nun at Amesbury Abbey.
*Elizabeth (or Cecilia) Beaumont, married, as his first wife, William de Botreaux, 3rd Baron Botreaux(1389–1462), whose sole heiress was his daughter Margaret Botreaux who married Robert Hungerford, 2nd Baron Hungerford.

<doc id="997409" wikidata="Q906957" url="?curid=997409" title="Deacon process">
<text>The Deacon process, invented by Henry Deacon, is a process used during the manufacture of alkalis (the initial end product was sodium carbonate) by the Leblanc process. Hydrogen chloride gas was converted to chlorine gas, which was then used to manufacture a commercially valuable bleaching powder, and at the same time the emission of waste hydrochloric acid was curtailed. To some extent this technically sophisticated process superseded the earlier manganese dioxide process.

==Process==

The process was based on the oxidation of hydrogen chloride: 
:4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2H2O

The reaction takes place at about 400 to 450 °C in the presence of a variety of catalysts, including copper chloride (CuCl2). Three companies developed commercial processes for producing chlorine based on the Deacon reaction:

*The Kel-Chlor process developed by the M. W. Kellogg Company, which utilizes nitrosylsulfuric acid.
*The Shell-Chlor process developed by the Shell Oil Company, which utilizes copper catalysts.
*The MT-Chlor process developed by the Mitsui Toatsu Company, which utilizes chromium-based catalysts.

The Deacon process is now outdated technology. Most chlorine today is produced by using electrolytic processes. New catalysts based on ruthenium(IV) oxide have been developed by Sumitomo.

==Leblanc-Deacon process==
The Leblanc-Deacon process is a modification of the Leblanc process. The Leblanc process was notoriously environmentally unfriendly, and resulted in some of the first Air and Water pollution acts. In 1874, Henry Deacon had derived a process to reduce HCl emissions as mandated by the Alkali Act. In this process, hydrogen chloride is oxidized by oxygen over a copper chloride catalyst, resulting in the production of chlorine. This was widely used in the paper and textile industries as a bleaching agent, and as a result sodium carbonate was no longer the primary product of these plants, and henceforth sold at a loss.

<doc id="997410" wikidata="Q1211586" url="?curid=997410" title="Ram pickup">
<text>The Ram pickup (marketed as the Dodge Ram until 2010 when Ram Trucks was spun-off from Dodge) is a full-size pickup truck manufactured by Stellantis North America (formerly Chrysler Group LLC and FCA US LLC) and marketed from 2010 onwards under the Ram Trucks brand. The current fifth-generation Ram debuted at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, in January of that year.

Previously, Ram was part of the Dodge line of light trucks. The &quot;Ram&quot; name was introduced in October 1980 for model year 1981, when the Dodge D series pickup trucks and B series vans were rebranded, though the company had used a ram&#x27;s-head hood ornament on some trucks as early as 1933.

Ram trucks have been named &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Truck of the Year eight times; the second-generation Ram won the award in 1994, the third-generation Ram heavy-duty won the award in 2003, the fourth-generation Ram Heavy Duty won in 2010 and the fourth-generation Ram 1500 won in 2013 and 2014, and the current fifth-generation Ram pickup became the first truck in history to win the award four times, winning in 2019, 2020, 2021 and most recently, 2025.


==First generation (1981; D/W)==
The first-generation Dodge Ram trucks and vans introduced in October 1980 feature a Ram hood ornament first used on Dodge vehicles from 1932 until 1954. Not all of the first-generation trucks have this ornament and is most commonly seen on four-wheel-drive models. Dodge kept the previous generation&#x27;s model designations: &quot;D&quot; or &quot;Ram&quot; indicate two-wheel drive while &quot;W&quot; or &quot;Power Ram&quot; indicate four-wheel drive. Just like Ford&#x27;s F-Series, Dodge used &quot;150&quot; to indicate a half-ton truck, 250 for a three-quarter-ton truck, and 350 for a one-ton truck. The truck models were offered in standard cab, &quot;Club&quot; extended cab, and crew cab configurations. They also were offered along with and bed lengths and &quot;Utiline&quot; and &quot;Sweptline&quot; styled boxes along with standard boxes. Externally, the first-generation Rams were facelifted versions of the previous generation Dodge D-Series pickups introduced in 1972. The new model introduced larger wraparound tail lamps, dual rectangular headlamps, and squared-off body lines. Engine choices were pared down to the 225 slant-6 and 318 and 360 V8s. The interior was updated, included a new bench seat, a completely new dashboard and an instrument cluster with an optional three-pod design – a speedometer in the center, with the two side pods containing an ammeter on the top left, a temperature gauge on the bottom left, a fuel gauge on the top right and an oil pressure gauge bottom right. Models without the full gauge package had only indicator lights in the place of the temperature and oil pressure gauges. Among the options offered on the Ram were front bumper guards, a sliding rear cab window, air-conditioning, cruise control, tilt steering column, power door locks and windows, AM/FM stereo with a cassette tape player, styled road wheels, aluminum turbine-style mag wheels, special paint and stripe packages, two-tone paint, and a plow package for four-wheel-drive models (referred to as the &quot;Sno Commander&quot;).

The &quot;Club Cab&quot; was dropped from the lineup after 1982, but Dodge kept the tooling and reintroduced it nearly a decade later in the 1990 models. The four-door crew cab and Utiline beds were dropped after the 1985 model year, to make room on the assembly line for the then-upcoming 1987 Dodge Dakota, and were never reintroduced in this generation.

Basic Ram 100 models were reintroduced for 1984, replacing the previous &quot;Miser&quot; trim level available on the Ram 150. A &quot;Ram-Trac&quot; shift-on-the-fly transfer case was added for the 1985 Power Rams, and both the crew cab and Utiline flared bed versions were discontinued for 1986, the latter not to return on any Chrysler-built pickup. In 1988, the slant-6 engine was replaced by a fuel-injected V6 engine first introduced with the Dodge Dakota. The engine, on which the 3.9 L V6 is based, also received electronic fuel injection in 1988. Because of the new computer-controlled fuel injection, ignition, and ABS system, more vehicle information needed to be displayed through any warning or notification lights; so inside the cab where a small compartment was once located on the dash, a new &quot;message center&quot; with four small rectangular light spots, contained the check engine light and other tell-tales including one for the parking brake and the ABS if the truck was so equipped. The message center later included &quot;wait to start&quot; and &quot;water in fuel&quot; lights on diesel models. Diagnostic fault codes were stored in the computer&#x27;s memory, and cycling the ignition key three times allowed the computer to flash the trouble codes through the check-engine light for diagnosis of some problems. Rear ABS became standard equipment in 1989.

The Ram 100 model designation was dropped and these models folded back into the 150 range for 1990, due to the introduction and sales success of the Dodge Dakota pickup. Additionally, the instrument cluster was slightly revised; the ammeter was replaced by a voltmeter while maintaining the 3-pod arrangement of the speedometer and gauges. Also for 1990, Dodge reintroduced the Club Cab, equipped with fold-out jump seats for the 1991–1993 models. Entry was made through the passenger or driver&#x27;s doors because there were no rear doors for this configuration. For 1991, all versions received standard rear-wheel anti-lock brakes.

These trucks, though popular with fleets, sold poorly compared to the Ford F-Series and the General Motors C/K trucks, with sales rarely breaking 100,000 units for most years of their production. Part of this was due to the dated cab and chassis design which had been in production since 1972, the lack of a powerful diesel option until 1989, and the lack of a big-block gasoline V8 option. Additionally, the interior had been given few updates since the October 1980 market launch.

===Engines and transmissions===
For 1989, the 5.9 L V8 received throttle-body fuel injection for a 20 hp (15 kW) gain. Additionally, Dodge introduced a new overdrive automatic transmission for reduced fuel consumption. This light-duty transmission was designated the A500, and was offered with the 3.9 L V6 and 5.2 L V8. An &quot;O/D off&quot; pushbutton switch to lock out the overdrive 4th gear was added to the message center. The A727 automatic saw continued use for some 5.2 L engines, all 5.9 L engines, and heavy-duty applications.

The grille was redesigned for 1991 but kept the large rectangular headlamps and crossbar appearance. The engines were substantially upgraded for 1992 (3.9 L and 5.2 L) and 1993 (5.9 L) with multi-port fuel injection, new manifolds, and higher-compression cylinder heads for noticeably higher output. These newly revised engines were marketed under the &quot;Magnum&quot; name. A heavy-duty automatic transmission with overdrive called the A518 was offered with the 5.2 L and 5.9 L engines. As part of Chrysler&#x27;s overhaul of corporate transmission nomenclature, the A500 and A518 were redesignated 42RH and 46RH, respectively, in 1992. The initial &quot;4&quot; signified a 4-speed transmission, the second digit identified the transmission&#x27;s relative torque capacity, the letter &quot;R&quot; in the third position denoted a rear-wheel-drive transmission, and the final letter &quot;H&quot; signified hydraulic shift control. The 3-speed automatic remained available; the A727 was redesignated 36RH, and the A904, A998, and A999 became the 30RH, 31RH, and 32RH, respectively.

====Cummins Turbo Diesel====

After 1978, the Chrysler RB engine was discontinued and therefore no longer offered in Dodge pickup trucks. Without a &quot;big-block&quot; gasoline engine or diesel, Dodge&#x27;s heavier-duty models had a severe power disadvantage over the competition, and thus began losing potential customers in the commercial market. Rather than developing a brand-new engine, Chrysler signed a deal with commercial engine manufacturer Cummins to use a version of its 5.9L B Series engine in the Ram trucks. This proved to be a mutually beneficial deal, allowing Cummins to expand its product output and Dodge to have a competitive engine for its heavy-duty models. The introduction of the Cummins Turbo Diesel model in 1989 coincided with the first sales increase for Ram trucks in several years. The Cummins was coupled with a heavier-duty version of the A727 automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission and was available on 250 and 350 pickups and pickup-based chassis-cab trucks above 8,500 pounds GVWR. This diesel engine option was different from the diesel engines offered in Ford and GM trucks in that the Cummins features direct injection, whereas the Ford and GM diesels feature indirect injection. This also means that the Cummins does not have to rely on glow plugs. The Cummins is a straight-six engine, whereas the GM and Ford diesel engines are V8 engines. Additionally, the Cummins is turbocharged, while the 6.2L GM/DDC and 7.3L IDI Ford/IH are naturally aspirated.

This was not actually the first engine to debut in Dodge pickup trucks as a diesel option. The 1978 D-series models were available with a Mitsubishi naturally-aspirated diesel, but it was seldom ordered. The Cummins diesel was in short supply the first two years, but for 1991, Dodge managed to ramp up production.

Partway through the 1991 model year, Dodge started using 350 (one-ton) frames in Ram 250 Cummins and Club Cab models.

===Special editions===
*Prospector – Prospector was a package available throughout the 1980s that usually included a different fuel tank, cloth seat, and carpeting. In the late 1980s, a light package and the large 6×9 mirrors were added to the list of options. This trim package was carried on until the end of production in 1993. 

==Second generation (1994; BR/BE)==
The second-generation Dodge Ram began development in 1986. The original concept, dubbed the &quot;Louisville Slugger&quot; by Chrysler&#x27;s Advanced Packaging Studio, was to be a modular platform that would accommodate a full-size truck and full-size van, which would have provided a roomy cab and cargo bed. The modular design was scrapped in 1987 and was replaced with a more conventional truck design when the design was moved to the American Motors design studio. The more conventional design, dubbed &quot;Phoenix&quot;, was originally scheduled for a 1991 production; when Bob Lutz showed it to the new styling designers, chief designer Phillip E. Payne told him, &quot;It looks like nothing more than a rehash of everybody else&#x27;s truck.&quot; At that, Lutz told him he had six months to come up with something better. The exterior styling of the truck that was eventually released was the result of design concepts by Payne during 1988–1990. A review by the Dodge pick-up truck studio designers felt that modern pick-ups looked &quot;too flat and sedan-like&quot;, while the early 1950s Studebaker pick-up and the semi-trailer trucks had just the right &quot;macho&quot; look to them. The design included a big-rig-style front end and a large grille that was deemed risky at its introduction, but ultimately proved popular with consumers.

Debuted on January 5, 1993, at the North American International Auto Show and going on sale on October 1, 1993, the redesigned 1994 Ram was a sales success and was named &quot;Truck of the Year&quot; by &quot;Motor Trend&quot; in 1994. Sales increased from 95,542 units in 1993 to 232,092 in 1994, 410,000 in 1995, and 411,000 by 1996. The latter third year, it was prominently shown as the hero vehicle in the film &quot;Twister&quot;, as well as the CBS television series &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;. Sales of this generation peaked at just over 400,000 in 1999 before declining against the redesigned Ford and GM trucks. By 2001, Ram sales figures trailed those of Ford and GM trucks.

The engine offerings were carried over from the last generation, which were the 3.9L V6, 5.2L V8, 5.9L V8, and 5.9L I6 Cummins turbo diesel options. Added to the lineup was a 8.0L gasoline V10 designed as an alternative for those who wanted superior pulling power, but did not want a diesel (similar to GM&#x27;s 7.4L V8), thus making the former the first factory V10 truck. The V10 and diesel were available in 2500/3500 models above 8,500 pounds GVWR. Models were now the 1500 half-ton, 2500 three-quarter-ton, and 3500 dual-rear-wheel only one-ton in both two- and four-wheel drive. Ram 1500s offered both short and long cargo beds on both regular and extended Club Cabs, Ram 2500s offered only long beds with regular cabs or a choice of beds on Club Cabs, and Ram 3500s only offered long beds on both cabs.

Dodge offered the 2500 series in two different GVWRs (7,500 and 8,800 pounds) from 1994 to 1996. The purpose of the difference between the light-duty and heavy-duty 2500 trucks was for the heavy-duty 2500 to take the place of the discontinued one-ton single-rear-wheel trucks. Rear axles for the light-duty 2500 trucks were semi-floating, while the heavy-duty 2500 rear axles were full-floating. Light-duty 2500 trucks shared the frame with the 1500, were only available in regular cabs in two- or four-wheel drive, and were equipped with either the 5.2L or 5.9L V8 engine. All Ram 2500s and 3500s had eight-lug wheels.

On the inside, special attention was paid to in-cab storage features, with a large glovebox, a center armrest storage area, and extra storage space behind the seat.

===1998 updates===
In 1998, Dodge introduced the 4-door Quad Cab, which used smaller clamshell doors directly behind the main doors. This was the first extended cab pickup to have four doors (the 2-door Club Cab remained available through 2002). Other changes for 1998 included new rounded black plastic sideview mirrors, new plastic fold-out towing mirrors, a revised interior and instrument panel, dual airbags, a chime replacing the buzzer for seat belts/door ajar/headlights, and a digital odometer. The OBD-II system was also standard, with a computer port near the driver&#x27;s-side footwell and a code-checking system via the new digital odometer readout.

In late 1998, Dodge introduced a revised front end for the 1999 model year Sport models with a restyled bumper, quad-beam clear-lens headlamps, and body-color grille. A 6-speed manual transmission was made optional for diesel models in late 2000 for the 2001 model year. A small percentage of the diesel engines for the 1999 and 2000 model years were subject to problems with the water jackets and fuel injectors. The most problematic was the &quot;53&quot; stamped engine block which had a defect that would cause fracturing in the structure of the block itself.

The 2000 models offered the option of heated leather seats. The braking system was upgraded to dual-piston calipers in the front. An Off-Road Edition was offered as a package with a 2-inch lift, accomplished with stiffer front springs and rear lift blocks, unique 17×8&quot; wheels, 275/70/17 all-terrain tires, 4.10:1 rear axle ratio, trussed Dana 44 front axle, limited-slip differential, and skid plates. The Off-Road Edition models are also distinguishable with an additional &quot;Off Road&quot; decal on the tailgate under the 4×4 decal. The 2000 model was cut short, ending production in January 2000 to avoid a CAFE requirement. After that, 2001 models began production.

While Dodge introduced a new Ram 1500 for 2002, the second-generation Ram was carried over for the 2002 heavy-duty 2500 and 3500 trucks. The new third-generation Ram would not debut in the 2500 or 3500 series until 2003. Part of this delay was due to the then-new 5.7 L Hemi engine not being ready for production.

====Mexico-only applications====

Unencumbered by CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) restrictions, DaimlerChrysler&#x27;s Mexican subsidiary developed a three-door SUV version of the Ram, called the Ramcharger as was its predecessor. It debuted in 1998, but was never available in the United States.

There were also medium-duty Ram trucks that were only manufactured and marketed in Mexico. Built in the Saltillo Plant from 1994 until 1998, the medium-duty Dodge Ram 6500 and 7000 had a grille almost twice as tall as the original, and sizable filler plates beneath the headlights to accommodate the much taller chassis and engine. The range included a 3500 and 4000 with the 5.9-liter V8 with at 4,000 rpm and a four-speed manual transmission; these look quite similar to the US version, albeit on a heftier chassis. Payloads are respectively. The much larger 6500 and 7000 have a bigger engine, available to run on LPG.

===Drivetrain===
====Transmissions====
Ram transmissions are labeled such that the first number indicates the number of gears (including overdrive), the second number is the capacity rating, and the last letter is either E for electronic or H for hydraulic.

*A500/42RH-RE lower geared light-duty applications found behind the 3.9 L V6. The 42RE + RH are both 4-speed automatic transmissions with identical gear ratios. This transmission came available in 1989 and it is paired with a 10.75-inch diameter torque converter. The RH is a hydraulic governor system that is rated as a medium-duty transmission. The RE is an electronic hydraulic system that is considered for heavy-duty use. Both transmissions are also used in the Dodge Dakota and Jeep Cherokee among other Chrysler models. Gear ratios in both transmissions are 2.74:1 for first gear, 1.54:1 for second gear, 1.00:1 for third gear, and 0.69:1 for fourth gear.
*A518/46RH-RE for more heavy-duty applications found behind the 5.2 L and 5.9 L V8 engines. The 46RH and RE are 4-speed automatics that were born from the A518 family. The A727 was replaced by the A518 family in the early 1990s. The 46RH was the first to replace the A727 and was preceded by the 46RE. The improvement with both models included the overdrive being added. The difference in the two transmissions was the RH had a hydraulically controlled governor versus the computer-controlled one on the RE.
*A618/47RH-RE for heavy-duty use behind the V10 gasoline and Cummins diesel engines. The 47RH was used in the 1994 and 1995 model years, while the 47RE was used from 1996 through 2002. The 47RH was released first and was only used in the Ram 2500 and 3500 series trucks. The transmission was able to produce 450 lb-ft of torque and was able to tow trailers up to 19,000 pounds. This transmission was rated to be the highest capacity in the one-ton series of trucks produced by any manufacturer. The RH was a hydraulically operated 3-speed transmission with a hydraulically controlled overdrive gear. The RH was later replaced by the RE however it was by name only since they are both hydraulically controlled.
The NV3500 was offered in 1500 and light-duty 2500 trucks. The NV4500 was standard in heavy-duty 2500 and 3500 trucks; the NV4500HD for V10 and diesel models. An NV5600 was offered in 1999 and 2000 Rams and was the only transmission offered behind the High Output diesel in 2001 and 2002.

====Transfer cases====
There were a total of five transfer cases available for the four-wheel-drive Ram. All are part-time and have a low range of 2.72:1. The 1500 featured an NP231 and NP231HD. The NP241 was standard on V8 3500s. The 2500 and 3500 V10 and diesel featured an NP241DLD from 1993 until 1997. In 1997, the NP241DHD became an option for 2500s and was standard on 3500s from 1998 to 2002.

====Axles====
The Dodge Ram features a wide variety of axles. For the front axle of 4×4 Rams, a Dana 44 was used on all 1500s and the early (light-duty) 2500s. However, most of the 2500 and all 3500 Rams use Dana 60 front axles. The 1500s and some early light-duty 2500s used a 9.25 Chrysler (Spicer) axle in the rear. A Dana 60 rear axle was used on heavy-duty 2500s with the 5.9L V8. A Dana 70 rear axle was used in 2500s with a V10 or diesel and automatic transmission combination. A Dana 80 rear axle was used on 2500s with a manual transmission and V10 or diesel engine combination. Every 3500 was made with a Dana 80. The front-drive axles in 3500s were unique in the fact they did not have locking hubs, but featured a center axle disconnect. The 2002 2500s and 3500s saw the eventual phase-out of the center axle disconnect, in favor of front axles that were permanently locked in. Dodge continued to include front axles like this for its 2500 through 5500 trucks until the 2013 models.

===Engines===
A natural-gas-powered engine debuted for the 1995 model year, but was not popular and was only used in fleet vehicles on a limited production run. The Cummins B Series engine was switched from the 12-valve to the 24-valve (ISB) version in the middle of the 1998 model-year Dodge Rams to comply with emissions regulations. The ISB featured a new computer-controlled electronic injection pump and a 24-valve head design.

===Special editions===

*Limited Edition Indy and SS/T Package – The Dodge Ram Indy Official Truck was available in 1996. It included longitudinal stripes similar to those on the Dodge Viper along with an optional door sticker stating &quot;Official Truck of the 80th Indianapolis 500&quot;. These trucks had a engine with upgraded exhaust and more power. These also included wheels with Goodyear Eagle II 275/60R17 tires. 3212 were built. The SS/T (Super Sport Truck) version was available from 1997 until 1998 and included all the upgrades except the door sticker. The SS/T also had &quot;SS/T&quot; designed into the stripe on both the hood and tailgate. The Indy Trucks were available only in blue with white stripes. The SS/Ts were available in white/blue, red/silver, black/silver, and green/silver. All include a specialty sticker on the inner door stating, &quot;Built with pride in the U.S.A.&quot; A real Indy 500 Official Truck will have the code AGJ, which is the INDY 500 SPECIAL EDITION GROUP.
*High Output – The Ram trucks started offering a diesel High Output package for 2001 models. 2001/2002 high-output engines were rated 10 horsepower higher than the standard engine.
*Off-Road Edition – The Dodge Ram 1500 SLT Off-Road &quot;Edition&quot; (package) was available in the latter portion of the second generation. It included 17-inch alloy wheels (standard were 16-inch), added 4×4 transfer case skid plate, 4.10:1 rear axle ratio, limited-slip rear differential, heated dual-power side mirrors, fog lamps, and frame-mounted front tow hooks.
* Dodge Ram VTS Concept – This concept from Dodge was meant to be a design study highly inspired by Viper GTS-inspired bumpers, mirrors, 17-inch wheels, Blue Paint, dual white stripes and Viper GTS sourced 415 bhp V10. VTS was vital in the development of 500 bhp Ram SRT-10 that were built from 2004 until 2006.

==Third generation (2002; DR/DH/D1/DC/DM)==
In development from 1996 (styling by Cliff Wilkins finalized in 1998), the third-generation Dodge Ram debuted on February 7, 2001, at the 2001 Chicago Auto Show. Production later began for the 2002 model year on 1500 models, and 2003 on 2500 and 3500 models. This major update included an all-new frame, suspension, powertrains, interiors, and sheet metal. The crew cab models for this generation were actually Quad Cab trucks that had conventional-opening rear doors. The four-wheel-drive light trucks (1500 series) remove their beam axles in favor of an independent front suspension, but the 2500 and 3500 series retained the live axles for maximum longevity and durability; rear-wheel-drive 2500 and 3500 trucks had class-exclusive rack-and-pinion steering for their independent front suspension (the 1500 also received rack-and-pinion steering for the first time). This body style drew heavily from the previous generation.

The redesigned trucks bolstered sales, with 400,000 sold during 2001–2002 and nearly 450,000 sold during 2002–2003, a new high point for the Ram name. At the same time, both Ford and GM trucks were increasing in sales from a 2001 peak of over 850,000 to the 900,000 range. However, with 400,543 Rams sold that year, the total did not keep up with the eleventh-generation F-150 in 2004.

===2006 refresh===
The entire lineup was updated for the 2006 model year. One notable addition was the &quot;Mega Cab,&quot; featuring a cargo box and of extra cab space, allowing seating for six with rear recliners. A full-screen-mapping in-dash navigation system became an option, and the front fascia was modernized.

For 2006, the steering wheel design was changed to the same as seen in the Dodge Dakota and Dodge Durango. The Bluetooth Uconnect radio was now available as an option, and a facelift was given to all Ram models. SIRIUS Satellite Radio was available, as well as a rear-seat DVD entertainment system with wireless headphones. The high-performance SRT-10 was discontinued after the 2006 model year.

For 2007, the taillights were slightly revised. For 2008, the RAM 1500 emblems on the front doors were replaced with RAM emblems.

===Chassis Cab===
In 2007, a 3500 Chassis Cab model was introduced with industry-standard rear frame width and wiring to accommodate outfitters. In addition to the V8, a Cummins diesel rated at and was available. Automatic transmissions used were the 545RFE with the and the AS68RC with the . The G56 transmission was the only manual transmission offered.

For 2008, Dodge introduced two more Chassis Cab models, the all-new 4500 and 5500 (to compete with Ford&#x27;s F-450/F-550). These were Class 4 and Class 5 trucks with a gross weight rating of and , respectively. Both trucks came equipped with the same version of the Cummins diesel as the 3500 chassis-cab model. Sterling, who worked with Dodge in development, had their own version, called the Sterling Bullet with a unique grille. Sterling is a division of Freightliner Trucks which, like Dodge, was owned by the former DaimlerChrysler. Sterling Trucks was licensed to sell Dodge Ram 4500 series trucks as the Sterling Bullet. When the Sterling brand was phased out by Chrysler Corporation, the Bullet was discontinued.

===Engines===
Models built after January 1, 2007, offered a new 6.7 L Cummins turbo diesel introduced as an option in 2500/3500 models replacing the 5.9 L. It produces and . Unlike the 5.9 L, which was backed by the 4-speed 48RE transmission, the 6.7 L was equipped with the new 6-speed 68RFE transmission.

2005 was the last year for the first version of the Hemi V8. 2006 half-ton models offered the Multi-Displacement System Hemi V8 engine that also became available in Chrysler and Dodge sedans. This engine featured the same performance but had a cylinder-deactivating feature enabled under light loads to increase fuel economy by 3 MPG city and 4 MPG highway. This new Hemi still delivered and .

===Axles===
For the 2003 model year, AAM axles replaced the Dana Corp axles. In the front, all 2500 and 3500 trucks were 9.25-inch with 33 spline axles. The rear options for the 2500 and 3500 were the AAM Corporate 10.5&quot; and 11.5&quot;. Rear-axle shafts are 30 spline. The rear 11.5&quot; has a gear ratio &quot;carrier split&quot; at 3.73 and numerically higher, but the General Motors AAM axles used a different carrier spacing preventing the installation of a Chrysler carrier into some GM axles, but the GM carrier can be installed in the Chrysler axle if a ring gear spacer is installed. Strength is similar to their earlier Dana 70 and 80 counterparts. Direct comparisons are difficult as the axles are made with completely different metallurgy.


===Special editions===
* Hemi Sport – The Hemi Sport Edition was the Quad Cab version of the Rumble Bee, and was introduced in 2004. It was available in black, red, or silver, and with either two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. It was equipped similarly to the Rumble Bee, but without the number plaque. The Hemi Sport was discontinued after 2006.
* Dodge Ram SRT-10 – This is a regular or quad-cab body with the Dodge Viper&#x27;s 8.3L V10 engine, Pirelli tires on 22&quot; rims, lowered suspension, bucket seats, body modifications, and a spoiler. The 2004 version was available only in a regular cab with a 6-speed manual transmission and a Hurst shifter. For 2005, Dodge released a Quad Cab version of the Viper V10–powered truck with a modified 48RE four-speed automatic transmission from the Ram with the Cummins turbodiesel engine. In 2004, the truck held the Guinness World Record for &quot;World&#x27;s Fastest Production Pickup Truck&quot; with a speed of 154.587 mph (247.3 km/h). This record stood until overtaken by the Australian HSV Maloo R8, a sport utility coupe, in May 2006. SRT-10 production ended on June 30, 2006.
* Power Wagon – This model, introduced for 2005, is an off-road–focused version of the Ram. The name is drawn from Dodge&#x27;s line of four-wheel-drive trucks made from the early 1940s through the 1980s. It comes with the Hemi engine, electronic locking differentials, electronic disconnecting front sway bar, 285/70R17 off-road tires mounted on power wagon specific 17&quot; wheels with dual safety beads, factory lift springs with power wagon specific spring rates, fender flares, full underbody skid plates, &quot;Power Wagon&quot; nameplates instead of the standard Ram badging, and a 12,000-pound winch. This truck was built on the 2500 platform and was available with the regular cab long bed or quad cab short bed.
* Rumble Bee – The Rumble Bee package is a limited sport-truck version of the Ram. It was available only on regular-cab/short-box pickups; however, some other versions of the Ram were modified to look like Rumble Bees. It includes lower body cladding, 20&quot; wheels, a hood scoop, and an SLT interior specially trimmed with yellow dashboard and door panel inserts and a serialized number plate. On the rear of the box is a stripe with a &quot;Rumble Bee&quot; emblem, similar to that of the Super Bee. All Rumble Bees are either black with &quot;solar yellow&quot; trim or yellow with black trim. 4,858 were produced in 2004, and 5,174 in 2005.
* Hemi GTX – The Hemi GTX package is a limited sport-truck version of the Ram. Introduced in 2004 and only made in 2004 and 2005, these were customized by LA West of Indiana as ordered from dealers, adding an additional $8,300.50 in the sticker price. It was available on regular-cab/short-box and quad-cab/short-box pickups and include a custom overall paint from Mopar&#x27;s Impact colors from the 1970s (this includes Hemi Orange, Plum Crazy Purple, Sublime Green, and Banana Yellow). 20&quot; American Racing Motto chrome wheels, a new cowl &quot;blacked-out&quot; hood, and a specially trimmed leather 2-tone interior including a serialized number plate on the driver&#x27;s-side doorjamb were offered. On the sides is a &quot;hockey-stick&quot; stripe with &quot;HEMI GTX&quot; that extended from the hood to the rear of the box. The airbox was also painted to match the body color, and a color-matched steering wheel was added as well. There were only 433 produced in 2004 and roughly the same number in 2005. A certificate of authenticity was given to all original owners.

* Daytona – Introduced for 2005, the Ram Daytona was a new sport-truck edition of the Ram. It was available as a 5.7L Hemi V8 in Regular Cab or Quad Cab styles and featured lower-body cladding, 20&quot; chrome wheels, SRT-10 hood, Borla dual exhaust, serialized number plate, and a tall rear spoiler reminiscent of the 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona. The Daytonas had a black body stripe to match the rear spoiler and came in silver or &quot;Go Mango&quot; paint (a metallic orange color reminiscent of the Dodge&#x27;s &quot;high impact&quot; colors from the 1960s and 1970s) with matching interior trim. The Dodge Ram Daytona had a 3.92 ratio rear end, the same rear end as the Dodge Ram Rumble Bee. Several exterior items were unique to the Daytona package (such as the gas door and dual side-exit exhaust tips) which made it different from other equipment packages. It was equipped with chrome wheels and performance tires. Replacing the standard hood is one with a non-functional hood scoop. The most noticeable feature is the large spoiler which is attached at the rear of the cargo box. The spoiler lined up with the flat black stripe that ran along the back of the bed side with the word &#x27;Daytona&#x27; written in the middle. This spoiler is reminiscent of the 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona.
*Contractor&#x27;s Special hybrid – Dodge announced a hybrid version of the Ram, dubbed the &quot;Contractor&#x27;s Special&quot;, in 2003. However, the schedule for delivery slipped as Dodge backed away from the vehicle. The hybrid Ram was available only for fleet purchasers (if at all) and did not enter mass production. It offered an AC electrical outlet panel for running an entire job site worth of power tools, but the through-the-road method of balancing the gas engine and electric motor reportedly did not work as desired. Dodge has announced that it would use a hybrid transmission developed jointly with General Motors and BMW.
*NightRunner – 400 of these were assembled from January 2006 to December 2006 (200 regular cab and 200 quad cab). The Limited Edition NightRunner trim includes Brilliant Black Paint, 22&quot; (510 mm) black chrome wheels, black chrome grille, the 8.3L Viper engine, dark shaded headlamps, NightRunner graphics on the sides of the rear bed, Piano black dash, and a numbered plate below the climate controls. 
==Fourth generation (2009; DS)==
The fourth-generation Dodge Ram was introduced at the 2008 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. This generation was sold as the 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 starting in Fall 2008. The 2500 and 3500 pickups were added for 2010, and the 3500, 4500, and 5500 chassis cabs were added for 2011. In 2010, the Ram Trucks brand was separated from Dodge starting with the 2011 model year.

Chrysler LLC attempted to keep the Ram competitive in the market through various developments for the 2009 model, including a new four-door cab style offering, new suspension, a new Hemi engine option, and the Rambox, a new storage system that allows secure storage inside the truck&#x27;s bed walls. Later models have the Rambox system tied in with the remote keyless system.

In 2010, Ram was separated from Dodge, and made a separate marque. This was supposedly done so Dodge could focus more on passenger and performance cars. Despite having split from Dodge in 2010, it was actually still marketed as one until the 2013 refresh.

From 2011 through 2018, Ram 2500/3500 models were marketed as having a &quot;class-exclusive&quot; manual transmission option, as General Motors and Ford had discontinued manual transmissions for North American models for 2007 and 2011 respectively.

The Ram 1500 (2010–2018), Ram 1500 Classic (2019–2024), Ram 2500 through 5500, and Ram DX chassis cab (Mexican market) were assembled at Saltillo Truck Assembly Plant in Coahuila, Mexico. From 2009 to 2018, the Ram 1500 (DS) was assembled at Warren Truck Assembly in Warren, Michigan, and the 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 was also assembled at Saint Louis Assembly in Fenton, Missouri, until its closure in 2009.

===Cab and bed options===
The Ram was available with three bed lengths (5.5&#x27;, 6.3&#x27;, and 8&#x27;) and four cab styles. Regular cab models offered a 6.3&#x27; or 8&#x27; bed (with the former exclusive to the 1500), Quad Cab models were now exclusive to the 1500 and were only available with the 6.3&#x27; bed, and the all-new Crew Cab was available with the 5.5&#x27; (1500 only), 6.3&#x27;, or 8&#x27; bed (2500/3500 only). The Mega Cab option was still available, but only remained on the heavy-duty models, and had a 6.3&#x27; bed. Improvements made from the previous generation meant the rear seats in the Mega Cab were now able to recline.

Dual rear wheels were available with long-wheelbase Ram 3500 pickups as well as the Ram 3500 Mega Cab. For 2013, the Crew Cab became available with the 6.3&#x27; bed.

===Handling===
A coil spring five-link rear suspension replaces the leaf springs for the 1500. This was the first traditional full-size pickup truck with rear coil springs since the 1972 Chevrolet/GMC C10 and C20 (although the Chevrolet Avalanche, an SUV-based pickup truck, used rear coil springs).

===Payload capacities===
The 2009 model&#x27;s towing capacity was originally rated at for 2WD Ram 1500 with regular cab, long-bed, Hemi engine, 3.92 differential and 17-inch wheels, but the rating increased to without changing the setup. For the 2010 model, payload was increased by to for the regular cab 2WD model with the 3.7-liter V6 engine.

Towing capacity for the regular cab Ram 1500 with 3.21 differential is rated at with 17-inch wheels and with 19-inch wheels. Crew Cab and Quad Cab models are rated at and respectively.

GCWRs are for all Ram 1500s with 3.21 axles; max for 2WD Ram 1500 with long bed, 5.7L Hemi engine, and 3.92:1 rear axle ratio.

==== Heavy Duty Chassis Cab ====
Chassis Cab versions were available on 3500, 4500, and 5500 models. The 3500 Heavy Duty model debuted at the 2009 Chicago Auto Show for the 2011 model year.

Engine choices include the Hemi V8 rated at at 5,600 rpm and at 4,000 rpm for Ram 3500, and the 6.7 L Cummins turbo diesel rated at at 3,013 rpm and at 1,500 rpm for Ram 3500 (optional), 4500, and 5500. Late-model 2011 diesel trucks were uprated to of torque.

Transmission choices included a standard 6-speed manual or optional 6-speed Aisin automatic. Both transmissions support the power take-off option.

The 3500 model has the regular or crew cab with single or dual rear wheels. Four cab-axle lengths (60, 84, 108, and 120 inches) for 4500/5500 or two cab-axle lengths (60 and 84 inches) for 3500, and three trim levels (ST, SLT, and Laramie).

The Ram 3500 has three axle ratios (3.42, 3.73, and 4.10) and 17&quot; wheels. Ram 4500/5500 has three axle ratios (4.10, 4.44, and 4.88) and 19.5-inch wheels. The 4500/5500 Rams rear axle is a Dana S 110. The front axle on 4×4 models is manufactured by Magna, while 2-wheel-drive models just have a solid, non-drive axle.

====Concept truck====
The Ram concept truck &quot;Long Hauler&quot; from 2012 is mostly based on existing Ram truck parts. The powertrain, frame, and wheels are all components of the Ram 5500 Chassis Cab. It is a &quot;Mega Cab&quot; which is optional on the lighter Rams. The GCWR for this truck is 37,500 lb and the weight of the truck is 9,300 lb.

===Model year changes===
====2013 changes====
The 1500 receives a minor restyling. It features a new front fascia, optional projector-beam halogen headlamps with LED turn signals/parking lamps, wheels, and interior, where the &quot;DODGE&quot; name was removed from the dashboard and replaced with &quot;RAM&quot;.

All models offered for 2012 continue to be available for 2013 with the addition of a new high-end trim, the Laramie Longhorn Limited. The base ST model also becomes the Tradesman model. Other trim levels for 2013 include Express, SLT, Big Horn, Lone Star, Sport, R/T, Laramie, and Laramie Longhorn. The RamBox cargo management system continues to be available on most models for 2013.

2013 models have revised engine and transmission options. The 3.7 L V6 is discontinued, and the 4.7 L V8 equipped with the 6-speed 65RFE automatic takes its place as the new base engine, still producing and . New to the lineup is Chrysler&#x27;s corporate 3.6 L Pentastar V6, coupled to the new ZF 8-speed Torqueflite8 automatic. It achieves best-in-class fuel efficiency and makes and . The Pentastar/ZF 8-speed is optional. Due to a new electric power steering system, the Hemi V8 no longer has a power steering pump, and gains 5 horsepower, now making and . It is still available with the 65RFE 6-speed automatic, with the new 8-speed Torqueflite8 automatic optional.

Air suspension is optional for 2013 models, offering four ride height settings. Electronic stability control becomes standard on 2500 and 3500 models. For 2013, the Ram is also the first North American pickup truck to offer keyless ignition.

New infotainment systems are available for the Ram 1500 for 2013:

* The base Uconnect 3.0 (RA1) radio includes an AM/FM radio, Radio Data System (RDS), a monochrome LCD display screen, a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack, and a single USB port for charging purposes only.
* The &quot;up-level&quot; Uconnect 5.0BT (RA2) radio adds a full-color, 5.0-inch color touch-screen display, voice control for the phone, a microSD card slot, Bluetooth for the phone, and A2DP wireless stereo audio streaming capabilities, and vehicle customization options on-screen.
* The &quot;top-of-the-line&quot; radios are the Uconnect ACCESS 8.4A (RA3) and Uconnect ACCESS 8.4AN (RA4). These radios add a full-color, 8.4-inch color touch-screen display, full voice control, SiriusXM satellite radio, the Uconnect ACCESS System, featuring roadside assistance and 911 emergency call buttons on the rearview mirror, mobile app compatibility, remote USB ports for the integration of compatible devices, enhanced in-vehicle customization options, automatic notification of airbag deployment, concierge services, remote control via an app installed on a compatible smartphone, and the ability to add GPS navigation from Garmin for vehicles not equipped with the option from the factory (it is activated by a dealership for a fee, however, does not include SiriusXM Travel Link or 3D mapping). The Uconnect ACCESS 8.4AN (RA4) adds GPS navigation from Garmin, HD Radio SiriusXM Travel Link, 3D mapping, and enhanced mobile app compatibility. The system also includes a built-in 3G internet router, allowing for wireless connection to the internet while the vehicle is parked with a monthly service subscription. The system can also be updated to add features via a USB stick inserted into one of the remote USB ports. Remote steering wheel-mounted controls are also included with this system.
* Options such as a CD player (mounted in the center console of the vehicle), SiriusXM satellite radio, and a rearview backup camera can be added to any radio.
=====3500=====
The 2013 models move up to 18&quot; standard wheels, with 18&quot; forged Alcoa wheels as an option. 3500 models offer a High Output package for the diesel. The rear differential ring gear is increased from 11.5&quot; to 11.8&quot; on H.O. trucks. The 11.8 axle cover doubles as a heat sink.

=====4×4=====
Ram installed the center axle disconnect (CAD) system into the 3500 4×4 models. Ram trucks did not have a CAD system until the 2014 models. Ram states this technology improves fuel economy by 1 MPG, although EPA fuel economy tests do not include trucks over 8,500 pounds GVWR. The 4×4 saw additional changes with the transfer case now being made by BorgWarner instead of New Venture Gear.

=====High Fuel Efficiency=====
A new model offered for the 2013 Ram was the HFE (High Fuel Efficiency). Based on the SLT model, the HFE offered 18/25 MPG out of its Pentastar V6 engine and eight-speed TorqueFlite transmission. It was available only on the two-wheel-drive regular cab model with a 6.3-foot bed. Standard features included a 220-amp alternator and an 800-amp battery to assist with the start-stop system. A 3.21:1 rear axle ratio was also standard.

====2014 changes====

An air suspension option became available on the rear of the 2014 model year 2500 and 3500 pickups. 1500 models added the option of an EcoDiesel V6. 2500 models now feature a coil spring suspension, instead of leaf springs. The cast iron, flex-fuel, 4.7L V8 Chrysler PowerTech engine was discontinued, ending Corsair engine production, leaving the Ram 1500 with two engine choices. The aluminum, flex-fuel 3.6L V6 Pentastar is now the base engine, along with the 8-speed Torque-Flite transmission. The 3.6L V6 was now available on Laramie and Longhorn trims. The Ram heavy-duty series of trucks (2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500) received a new interior design and revised exterior styling from the Ram 1500, which was restyled in 2013. Also for 2014, the new Outdoorsman trim became available, particularly intended for buyers who hunt, fish, and camp. The Mossy Oak special edition (first available in 2012) also returned for 2014.

====2016 changes====

For 2016, the all-new Ram 1500 Rebel debuted, offering off-road suspension with a higher ride height, larger tires, and a unique interior to add to the Ram 1500 Big Horn and Lone Star trim levels. It features a unique blacked-out grille with powder coated front bumper and exclusive aluminum hood, skid plates, and tow hooks. It is available with either a and 3.6L Pentastar VVT flex-fuel capable V6 engine or a and 5.7L Hemi V8 engine. Four-wheel drive is available with either powertrain, but the two-wheel drive model is V8-only. The sole body configuration offered is a crew cab with a 5.5&#x27; bed.

SLT models of all Ram trucks now receive the Uconnect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio as standard equipment, adding steering wheel-mounted remote phone controls, Bluetooth hands-free calling and wireless audio streaming, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, a USB port, and 3.5 mm auxiliary input jack, Radio Data System (RDS), voice control, in-radio vehicle customization, and a full-color five-inch LCD touch-screen display. This was previously a $495.00 option on the Ram SLT.

====2017 changes====
For 2017, the Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn and Limited trims received the new RAM front grille and &quot;RAM&quot; emblem across the rear tailgate that debuted on the 2016 RAM 1500 Rebel.

The 3.0L EcoDiesel V6 turbodiesel engine, produced by VM Motori, was dropped in mid-2017 in response to emissions cheating allegations. The engine was reintroduced in early 2018, after being recertified by the EPA.

The 1500 SLT model lost the Uconnect ACCESS 8.4 infotainment system (RA3) option, leaving the UConnect 5.0BT (RA2) radio as the only radio option. However, all Ram heavy-duty (2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500) SLT models still offered the Uconnect ACCESS 8.4 infotainment system (RA3) as an option.

The Rebel trim level of the Ram 1500 gains the previously optional Uconnect ACCESS 8.4A infotainment system as standard equipment, as do the Big Horn and Lone Star trim levels. A Rebel Black Edition Package is available that adds black accents to the Rebel.

The Laramie trim level of the Ram 1500, 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 gets a standard nine-speaker, 506-watt Alpine 7.1-channel surround-sound premium audio system as standard equipment.

Three new special edition trim levels debut for 2017 for the Ram 1500 model:

* The Lone Star Silver Edition, available exclusively at Ram dealerships in Texas and based on the Texas-only Lone Star trim level, adds additional chrome trim pieces to the trim level. It debuted at the 2016 Texas State Fair.
* The Lone Star Yellow Rose Edition, also available exclusively at Ram dealerships in Texas and also based on the Texas-only Lone Star trim level, is available only in a model-exclusive Stinger Yellow Clear Coat exterior paint color. It debuted at the 2016 Texas State Fair.
* The Night Edition, available at Ram dealerships nationwide, is based on the Sport trim level and adds black-finished emblems, twenty-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, front grille, door handles, and emblems.

There is also a new Off-Road Package available for all Ram 2500 models (aside from the Power Wagon trim level, which includes the package as standard equipment), and includes unique pickup bedside graphics, off-road suspension, front tow hooks, and the protection package.

The mid-level SLT trim level of the Ram 1500 is no longer available to retail customers, as it is now a lesser-equipped model reserved exclusively for fleet customers. However, the SLT trim level still remains for the Ram 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 models, and is available to retail customers. However, retail customers wanting SLT features such as chrome front and rear bumpers and front grille, seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, power windows and door locks with keyless entry, the Uconnect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio, cloth seating surfaces, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, a rear-view backup camera system, and floor carpeting, can still opt for the Chrome Appearance and Popular Equipment Packages on the Tradesman model.

A less expensive Bluetooth option for the Ram trucks is a new Uconnect 3.0BT (RA2) radio that includes an AM/FM radio and SiriusXM Satellite Radio tuner, Radio Data System (RDS), Uconnect Bluetooth hands-free phone system with audio streaming and voice command, steering wheel-mounted remote voice command controls, a USB port, and 3.5 mm auxiliary audio input jack, and a three-inch (3.0&quot;) monochrome LCD display screen. This radio option is available for the Tradesman trim level of all Ram trucks, and the Express trim level of the Ram 1500, and is included as part of a Popular Equipment Package on the latter model. Previously, customers wanting Bluetooth on a Ram Tradesman or Ram 1500 Express would have to upgrade to the Uconnect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio, which would add the same features as described above, as well as onscreen vehicle customization via the radio, and a full five-inch (5.0&quot;) color touch-screen display, and cost an additional $495.00. In order to do this, the customer would also have to select the Popular Equipment Package on both models.

The Ram 2500 Power Wagon returned with a 6.4L Hemi gasoline V8 engine, a unique graphics package (delete option), black front grille, door handles, larger tires, and black aluminum-alloy wheels as well as the Off-Road Package. The Power Wagon Package is also available for the Ram 2500 Tradesman trim level, and also adds the 6.4L Hemi gasoline V8 engine.

====2018 changes====
Changes to the Ram for 2018 included the addition of HD Radio to all Uconnect 8.4 infotainment systems, as well as a new 4G LTE wireless hot-spot provided by AT&amp;T Wireless, an AT&amp;T Wireless 4G LTE in-vehicle modem (both the AT&amp;T Wireless 4G LTE modem and 4G LTE mobile hot-spot replace the Sprint 3G CDMA modem and 3G CDMA mobile hot-spot offered on previous Ram models), Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration for the Uconnect 8.4 infotainment systems, and the SiriusXM Guardian service replacing the Uconnect ACCESS service offered on previous RAM models for the Uconnect 8.4 infotainment systems. In addition, all Uconnect 8.4 infotainment systems get a new user interface design for easier navigation of menus and applications.

The VM Motori–produced 3.0L EcoDiesel V6 turbodiesel engine returned in early 2018 for the RAM 1500, as it has been re-certified by the EPA after allegations of emissions cheating in 2017.

Most upper trim levels of the RAM 1500 (Sport, Rebel, Laramie Longhorn, and Limited) get the new RAM front grille introduced for 2016, as well as a large &#x27;RAM&#x27; emblem on the rear tailgate. Lower to mid-trim levels of the RAM 1500 (Tradesman, Express, Big Horn, Lone Star, and Laramie) retain the standard RAM &quot;Cross-Hair&quot; front grille.

The Night Edition and Lone Star Silver Edition trim levels were continued.

For 2018, there are two new special editions:
* The Harvest Edition (also available on the Ram 2500 and 3500), are based on the Big Horn and Lone Star models. Available in only four paint colors, two of which are unique to the Harvest Edition (Case IH Red, New Holland Blue, two-tone Black Clear Coat and Bright Silver Metallic, or Bright White Clear Coat). Aimed at farmers, the Harvest Edition adds features that are otherwise optional on the Big Horn and Lone Star, such as seventeen-inch chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels with all-terrain tires on 4×4 models, the Uconnect 8.4 infotainment system with GPS navigation, SiriusXM Travel Link with five years of service included and one year of SiriusXM Guardian service, a trailer tow package with integrated trailer brake control, rear-mounted tow hitch, and trailer tow side mirrors. Also included are front bucket seats with power front driver&#x27;s seat trimmed in premium cloth, chrome side steps, chrome side mirror covers, chrome door handles, and chrome front tow hooks. It is available as either a Quad Cab or a Crew Cab.
* The Laramie Longhorn Southfork Edition Package, available on 1500, 2500, and 3500 Laramie Longhorn models, adds even more luxury features to the already luxurious truck, such as unique twenty-inch polished aluminum-alloy wheels, unique real wood interior trim, and a unique two-tone brown-and-beige interior color scheme.

====2019 changes====

For 2019, the current fourth-generation Ram 1500 continued to be produced alongside its successor, the fifth-generation Ram 1500. Virtually identical to 2018 models, 2019 trucks were given a new name, the Ram 1500 Classic, to distinguish them from their all-new fifth-generation successors. The Ram 1500 Classic offers a 2-door Regular Cab model, which the fifth-generation Ram 1500 does not. In addition, Quad and Crew Cab models are also offered.

In addition, the current-generation Ram 2500, Ram 3500, and Ram 3500/4500/5500 Chassis Cab models were redesigned for the 2019 model year. In addition to a totally new front clip, the 2019 Ram 2500 and 3500 received new frames and updated interiors that borrowed heavily from the new DT 1500 interior. The Hemi 5.7L engine was dropped (except only Mexico-market Ram 4000), and the Hemi 6.4L becomes the base engine. For 2500 and 3500 pickups with the 6.4L, a ZF 8HP75-LCV 8-speed automatic is mated. The 6.7-liter Cummins turbo-diesel returns in both Standard and High-Output form, but with a new compacted graphite iron (CGI) block. Only automatic transmissions are available (except on Mexico-market Ram 4000).

====2020 changes====
Tradesman, Express, SLT (fleet only), Warlock, Big Horn, and Laramie trims are available. A Black Appearance Package becomes available for the Warlock trim, which adds 20-inch black-finished aluminum-alloy wheels, and other black accents to the exterior of the truck. Flex-fuel capability in the V6 engine was removed.

====2021 changes====
For 2021, the Ram 1500 Classic Warlock trim receives an Off-Road Package, which includes all-terrain tires, as well as unique aluminum-alloy wheels. Base Tradesman and Express trims receive a newly available Infotainment Package, which includes the Uconnect 4C 8.4-inch touchscreen infotainment system, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, HD Radio, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. The base Uconnect 3.0 and Uconnect 3.0BT radios are discontinued, as the Uconnect 3 5.0BT touchscreen radio becomes standard equipment on all models, also adding the Uconnect Bluetooth hands-free phone system with audio streaming and steering wheel-mounted phone controls as standard equipment on all models.

====2022 changes====
For 2022, all Ram 1500 Classic models receive an optional upgraded Uconnect 5 8.4-inch touchscreen infotainment system, which now includes wired and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, as well as a new Android operating system. The older Uconnect 4C GPS navigation radio, as well as the Uconnect 3 5.0BT touchscreen radio, both remain available.

====2023 changes====
For 2023, the regular cab short bed configuration and Express trim were dropped. Newly optional on both models (Tradesman and Warlock) is the new Uconnect 5 infotainment system with an 8.4-inch touchscreen display, featuring wired and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration as part of the Electronics Group. Both models still include the Uconnect 3 5.0BT touchscreen radio as standard equipment, and buyers can also still opt for the older Uconnect 4C 8.4-inch touchscreen GPS navigation and infotainment system.

====2024 changes====

For 2024, the EcoDiesel option was dropped. In addition, all versions come standard with a tailgate ajar warning; the Warlock package returned for the Tradesman trim which comes with black exterior trim, rear-locking differential, 1-inch raised suspension, performance-tuned shocks, and off-road gear, such as 33-inch tires, skid plates, and Bilstein front and rear performance-tuned shock absorbers.

===Engines===
===Plug-in hybrid===
A two-mode hybrid version was planned to begin production in 2010, but Chrysler decided to cancel it in favor of a smaller test fleet of 140 plug-in hybrid (PHEV) Rams developed with support from a million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy financed through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Chrysler PHEV pickup project has an estimated total cost of million. The RAM 1500 pickup PHEV was introduced at the January 2011 Washington Auto Show. The vehicle is part of a three-year demonstration program intended to field test and evaluate battery performance across a wide range of drive cycles and temperature ambients, and also to evaluate customer acceptance. The PHEV demonstrator pick-up trucks are assembled at the Warren Truck Assembly plant in Michigan and the plug-in hybrid conversion takes place at the Chrysler Technology Center in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The demonstrators are being allocated for field testing among local and state governments, utility companies, and a US Army base. Chrysler has no plans for a production version.

The Ram 1500 PHEV demonstrator has a 345 hp Hemi V8 gasoline engine mated to a two-mode hybrid transmission and a 12.9 kWh 355V lithium-ion battery from Electrovaya. This setup allows an all-electric range of more than , but as a blended plug-in hybrid, the RAM PHEV does not run exclusively all-electric during EV mode. The fully charged plug-in starts off with charge depletion with limited regeneration at the high end of the state of charge (SoC). That ramps up to a full regenerative capability somewhere in the 70 to 95% range and depletes down to about 20%. Once depleted, it comes into a narrow charge-sustaining range. The plug-in pick-up meets AT-PZEV emissions standards, making it the only full-size V8 pickup with an AT-PZEV rating. Its fuel economy in charge-depleting mode is more than in city driving. The Ram 1500 PHEV is capable of towing up to .

The first 20 Ram PHEV demonstrators were delivered in May 2011 to Clark County, Nevada and Yuma, Arizona, with 10 units each city. Other cities that received the demonstration PHEVs are San Francisco and Sacramento, California, Albany, New York, and Charlotte, North Carolina. In September 2011, another 10 units were delivered to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). Another 5 units were delivered to Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric and National Grid. DTE Energy in Detroit was scheduled to receive 10 Ram PHEVs.

===Special editions===
*Dodge Ram R/T – A concept truck with a blue body, 22&quot; forged wheels, SRT stripes, and a new front bumper with chin spoiler. It was unveiled in 2008 at the SEMA Show. Production of the Dodge Ram R/T began for the 2009 model year. It is a regular cab, short bed, 2WD 1500 Ram with 22&quot; wheels, a 4.10 final drive gear ratio (the only way to get a 4.10 rear in a 1500), an R/T badge in the lower-right corner of the grille, and a Hemi. It also has the performance hood from the Sport Appearance Package on other Ram Sport models, but does not have the striping package that the concept had.
*2014 Ram 1500 Urban Concept – The 2014 Ram 1500 Urban Concept features a Hemi V8 producing and of torque. The engine comes from the Dodge Challenger SRT8 which is paired with a 5-speed automatic W5A580 transmission or a 6-speed manual Tremec TR6060 transmission. The concept features a regular cab painted in dark blue clear coat with an off-center light blue stripe. It sits on 22&quot; wheels painted &quot;hyper black.&quot;
*2016 Ram Rebel – The Ram Rebel is the Ram 1500&#x27;s off-road trim. It is available with the Hemi and 3.6 L Pentastar. The Rebel was available in the third quarter of 2015.
*2019 Ram Warlock – The reintroduction of the &quot;Warlock&quot; nameplate on the Ram 1500 Classic marks its return, having last been used as a trim package for the Dodge D/W series during the years 1976–1979. It is available with the Hemi and 3.6 L Pentastar. The Warlock was available in the first quarter of 2019.

===Issues===
====Fire incident, Hybrid, 2012====

In September 2012, Chrysler temporarily suspended the demonstration program. All 109 Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrids and 23 Chrysler Town &amp; Country plug-in hybrids deployed by the program were recalled due to damage sustained by three separate pickup trucks when their 12.9 kWh battery packs overheated. The carmaker plans to upgrade the battery packs with cells that use a different lithium-ion chemistry before the vehicles go back into service. Chrysler explained that no one was injured from any of the incidents, and the vehicles were not occupied at the time, nor any of the minivans were involved in any incident, but they were withdrawn as a precaution. The demonstration is a program jointly funded by Chrysler and the U.S. Department of Energy that includes the first-ever factory-produced vehicles capable of reverse power flow. The experimental system would allow fleet operators to use their plug-in hybrids to supply electricity for a building during a power outage, reduce power usage when electric rates are high or even sell electricity back to their utility company. The company reported that the demonstration fleet had collectively accumulated 1.3 million miles (2.1 million km) before the vehicles were recalled. Chrysler also reported that the plug-in pickups delivered peak average fuel economy of , while the plug-in hybrid minivans delivered .

====Remote Control, Software, Uconnect Entertainment System, 2015====
Charlie Miller, security researcher for Twitter and former NSA hacker, and Chris Valasek, director of vehicle security research at the consultancy IOActive, showed how a Jeep Cherokee can be remote controlled. FCA recalled 1.4 million vehicles with the Uconnect entertainment system on board.

===Safety===
The Ram comes standard with four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, side curtain airbags, and an electronic stability program or ESP. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tests, the 2009 Ram received a &quot;Good&quot; overall score in the frontal crash test, and a &quot;Marginal&quot; score in the side impact test, as well as the roof strength test.
:1 
:2 

It received a 5-star frontal crash test rating from the NHTSA, however under later testing methods it received an overall 3-star rating. In the side-pole test it was given a single star rating, because of excessive forces to the thoracic region. While the Ram 1500 features standard side-curtain airbags it does not include side torso airbags. The vehicle was redesigned and retested, and received a 5-star rating.

== Fifth generation (2019; DT) ==

The fifth-generation Ram made its debut at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, on January 15, 2018, while its HD version made its debut at the next year&#x27;s show on January 14, 2019.

2019 Ram 1500 sales began the first quarter of 2018 as an early 2019 model year vehicle. The 2019 Ram 1500 pickup truck offered just seven trim levels, compared to the previous 11 different trim levels.

Ram added eTorque to the 2019 Ram 1500 as an option. eTorque combined a belt-drive generator with a battery pack to provide short-term torque and energy regeneration to increase torque output by up to to the 5.7-liter Hemi. Also introduced in 2019 was the new Uconnect platform sporting a 12-inch touchscreen display, the largest in its class.

The 2019 Ram 1500 saw increases in capability for this new model year with payload increasing to and maximum trailer towing capacity reaching when properly equipped. This pairs with a total weight reduction of about compared to the previous generation.

For the 2025 model year, the Ram 1500 received a mid-cycle refresh, and the Hemi V8 engine was discontinued in favor of the 3.0L Hurricane turbocharged inline-six engine.

==Concept vehicles==
===Revolution===
The Ram Revolution is Ram&#x27;s first all-electric concept pickup truck. Featured for the 2024 model year, the Revolution is a body-on-frame design, with two motors providing all-wheel drive. As of January 2023, Ram has not provided any motor specifications other than stating that 100 miles of charge can be achieved within 10 minutes at a Level 3 DC fast-charging station.

==World markets==
In 2022, Ram trucks were available in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Europe, the Philippines, and the Middle East. The Ram trucks officially sold in many Latin American countries are outfitted with UNECE WP.29 lighting equipment, including the taillights with separate amber turn signal indicators.

No right-hand-drive version has been built for the Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, South Africa, and other countries where the rule of the road is on the left. In 2016, FCA via the Ateco commenced selling the Ram 2500 and 3500 in Australia and New Zealand and the Ram 1500 in 2018. These are converted to right-hand drive in Australia before the sale. Pricing commences from $80,000AUD (approximately US$54,000 as of 28/08/19) for the 1500.

Production of the Ram 1500 at the Warren Truck Assembly plant outside of Detroit was discontinued in 2024.

Ram trucks are provided for the European market in cooperation with FCA by AEC Europe in Germany and the Swiss company AutoGlobal Trade. Germany and Scandinavian countries are some of the largest European markets for the Ram. A thriving gray market exists in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom that has imported and converted Ram trucks to right-hand-drive and to meet the local regulations, being more common in Australia since LHD cars less than 30 years old (or 15 years old if registered in Western Australia) cannot be legally driven on Australian public roads unless they are granted a diplomatic or a research and development exception to the rule. In the United Kingdom and Japan, there is no such restriction, so a stock LHD Ram (or any other LHD vehicle) is not required to undergo the costly and time-consuming process of an RHD conversion in order to be compliant with EU regulations.

===Nissan Titan===
Following the collapse of Nissan Titan sales in 2008, there were talks that the next generation of Nissan&#x27;s full-sized pickup would be outsourced to Chrysler as a version of the Ram 1500. Nissan had been planning to phase out Titan production in its Canton, Mississippi factory in 2010 with the new Nissan-only design for a cab, body and interior riding on the Dodge Ram chassis assembled in Chrysler&#x27;s truck assembly lines in Saltillo, Mexico. However, the deal to build Nissan Titan pickups utilizing the full-sized Dodge Ram pickup starting in 2011 was delayed with the changes at Chrysler and Fiat. Nissan eventually decided to keep the Titan, and went on to release the second generation Titan as a 2016 model.

==Special editions==
*Express – The Express is an edition that offered special badges, 20&quot; tires and wheels from the SLT, cloth seating surfaces, and a 5.7 L Hemi V8 engine.
*2012 Detroit Red Wings Edition – The Detroit Red Wings Edition is a Crew Cab model with 4×4, special Red Wings seats, and &quot;Detroit Red Wings Edition&quot; decals (on both sides of the box and on the lower left of the tailgate). It is available in red, white, and black. 1,593 were built in two different editions (Edition No. 1: 1,283; Edition No. 2: 310).

==Motorsport==

The Ram Pickup represented both the Dodge and Ram brands in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series from 1995 to 2016, having won the Manufacturer&#x27;s Championship in 2001, 2003, and 2004.

The Ram Pickup also won the San Felipe 250 in 2008 and 2009.

<text>The Dodge Dakota, marketed as the Ram Dakota for the final two years of production, is a mid-size pickup truck manufactured by Chrysler and marketed by its Dodge Truck division (model years 1987-2009) and later its Ram Truck division (2009-2010) — across three generations.

The Dakota was larger than the compact pickups from Ford and Chevrolet, the Ford Ranger and Chevrolet S-10, and was smaller than full-sized pickups such as Dodge&#x27;s own Ram. It used body-on-frame construction and a leaf spring/live axle rear end and was the first mid-size pickup with an optional V8 engine. For its entire production, the Dakota was manufactured at Chrysler&#x27;s Warren Truck Assembly in Michigan.

The Dakota was nominated for the North American Truck of the Year award for 2000.


== First generation (1987–1996) ==

The Dodge Dakota was developed by Chrysler as a mid-sized pickup. To keep investment low, many components were shared with existing Chrysler products and the manufacturing plant was shared with the full-size Dodge D/W series. The N-body platform was the result of operational efforts by Harold K. Sperlich, who was in charge of Chrysler&#x27;s product planning in the early 1980s.

The first generation of the Dakota was produced from 1986 through 1996 (for the 1987–1996 model years). The Dakota was the first pickup truck with rack-and-pinion steering (2WD only, and early years were available without power steering). Inline-four and V6 engines were offered along with either a five-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission. Four-wheel drive was available only with the V6. Both 6.5- and 8-foot beds were offered.

Additional options in first-generation trucks included:
* Lowered suspension
* 15-inch chromed road wheels
* Chrome bars along the beds
* AM/FM stereo that optionally included a cassette player, CD player, or both
* Sliding rear windows
* Chromed bumpers
* 5.2L V8 engine
* Infinity sound systems

The sport package was added as a mid-year release. Exterior colors came in black, bright white, and graphic red. Available in both 2WD and 4WD, the sport option included:
* AM/FM stereo radio with cassette player
* Carpeted logo floor mats
* Center armrest bench seat
* Charcoal-silver deluxe cloth interior with fold-down armrest
* Color-keyed leather-wrapped sport steering wheel
* Deluxe wipers
* Dual remote control outside mirrors
* Floor carpet
* Gauge package
* Mopar air dam with Bosch fog lamps
* Mopar light-bar with Bosch off-road lamps (4WD only)
* Bodyside tape stripes
* Black grille and bumpers
* Sliding rear window
* 3.9L V6 engine
* 15-inch aluminum wheels
Fuel injection was added to the 3.9L V6 for 1988, but the rated output remained the same. Power windows and locks were now optional.

For 1989, the Dakota convertible was introduced. It featured a fixed roll bar and a simple manual top. The idea came from Jerry York and they were manufactured by ASC (American Sunroof Company). About 2,482 were sold during the first year.

Another addition that year was Carroll Shelby&#x27;s V8-powered Shelby Dakota, his first rear-wheel drive vehicle in two decades.

An extended Club Cab model was added for 1990, still with two doors. This model offered six-passenger seating, though the rear seat was best suited for cargo, children, and shorter adults.


The 1991 model year featured a new grille and hood for better access with optional 5.2 L V8, which was included with the previous Shelby Dakota V8 option. By the end of 1991, the standard square sealed-beam glass headlamps were phased out for the aerodynamic-style molded plastic headlamps attached to the grille components. It was equipped with halogen lights, making 1991 the only model year for a unique front-end for the Dakota. Also debuting on 1991 models were six-bolt road wheels (replacing the earlier five-bolt versions).

This was the last year for the Dakota convertible. To fulfill the Dodge division&#x27;s commitment to the American Sunroof Company, production of the convertible version was extended into the 1991 model year. A total of eight were built. Unlike the previous years, colors and options varied more than before. This version was not advertised and did not appear in sales literature.

The 3.9L V6 and 5.2L V8 engines were updated to Magnum specifications for 1992, increasing rated power to about for the V8. The engines now had multiport electronic fuel injection (EFI) with Chrysler&#x27;s powertrain control module which was partially responsible for the improved performance.

The 1994 model year had a few minor changes, with the most notable being the addition of a standard driver&#x27;s-side airbag, located in a new, two-spoke steering wheel (also found in the Ram). Other changes included the discontinuation of the &quot;SE&quot; and &quot;LE&quot; trims. In following with the all-new Ram full-sized pickups, the top-end trim was renamed to &quot;SLT,&quot; with these models (along with select others) including new chrome-finished, styled six-bolt steel wheels styled similar to the five-bolt type found on the larger Ram. Other changes included revisions to color and overall trim options. SRS airbags were also added for 1994. A CD player became optional, as did a combination cassette player and CD player unit. Leather seats were also available on LE models. New alloy wheels were available.

The 1996 model was the final year of the first-generation. The base K-based 2.5-liter SOHC I4 engine was discontinued; it had been considered vastly underpowered compared to the competition. It was replaced by the 2.5L AMC straight-4 engine, with an OHV valvetrain and rated at . This was the only major change for 1996, and the AMC 2.5L engine continued as the standard engine in the new, larger 1997 model.

=== Li&#x27;l Red Express Dakota and Dakota Warrior ===

Two special editions of the first were constructed with step-side beds. Both were constructed by L.E.R. Industries of Edwardsburg, Michigan. The step-side beds were constructed out of fiberglass and galvanneal. Wooden bed rails were also available.

The Li&#x27;l Red Express Dakota was made to resemble the original 1978–1979 Express models that were based on the Dodge D series. It featured the step-side bed and dual vertical exhaust stacks behind the cab that were non-functional. The Dakota Warrior was made to resemble the Warlock trim from the late 1970s. Warriors included the bed as the Express, but lacked the vertical exhaust stacks. Both the Express and Warrior Dakotas had a graphics package made to resemble those of the original models.

Production numbers for the Expresses and Warriors were in the hundreds. A few were made with the 5.2L Magnum V8 engine, which was only an option during 1992, the final model year of Express and Warrior.

=== Models ===

The 1987–1996 Dodge Dakota came in three basic models:

The Dakota S was the base trim level. It included the following standard features: base vinyl seating surfaces, radio delete package, and audio system delete package (later, an AM/FM stereo with a two-speaker audio system became standard equipment on the Dakota model with a two-speaker audio system), a heater with fan control, vinyl flooring, a black front grille and front bumper, full-faced steel wheels, all-season tires, and manual &quot;roll-up&quot; windows and door locks. A black painted back step bumper, air conditioning, AM/FM or AM/FM/cassette radio, and power steering were extra-cost options. This model was not typically seen as a Club Cab model, and also was not available with a V8 engine option like the other Dakota models were.

The Sport was the mid-range trim level. It added features such as vinyl-and-cloth-trimmed seating surfaces, an AM/FM stereo with a two-speaker audio system, sport-styled steel wheels, bodyside cladding delete, a tilt-adjustable steering column and wheel, and interior accents to the base Dakota model. Later, it also added chrome-clad steel wheels, as well as a color-keyed front fascia and front grille, and &quot;Sport&quot; decals that adorned the doors and pickup bed sides of the Dakota. V6 and V8 engines were available on the Sport model.

The Sport convertible was the only convertible Dakota available, and only from 1989 until 1991, when it was discontinued. It added the following features to the mid-range Sport trim level: sport-styled alloy wheels, cloth seating surfaces with vinyl inserts and accents, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player and a four-speaker audio system, air conditioning, a manual-folding vinyl convertible roof, and &quot;Sport&quot; decals on the doors of the Dakota. The V6 engine and two-door regular cab was the only available configuration of the Sport convertible.

The LE, later renamed SLT, was the top-of-the-line trim level. It added features such as cloth seating surfaces, air conditioning, an AM/FM stereo with cassette player and a four-speaker audio system, alloy wheels, bodyside cladding, carpeted flooring, and power windows and door locks to the mid-range Sport model. V6 and V8 engines were available on LE or SLT models.

== Second generation (1997–2004) ==
The second-generation Dakota began development in 1991, with an exterior design proposal by Dennis Myles under design director John R. Starr approved in mid-1993 and frozen for production in January 1994, 30 months ahead of Job 1. Design patents were filed on May 20, 1994, under D373,979 at the USPTO. The 1997 model year Dakota was presented by press release in the summer of 1996 and manufactured from July 1996 through July 2004. The Dakota inherited the semi truck styling of the larger Ram, and used mostly the same mechanicals as its predecessor — with the exception of its steering, which was updated to rack-and-pinion. 

That year had the introduction of the &quot;R/T&quot; model with the 5.9L Magnum V8. At the time of its introduction, it was seen as one of the most radical in its class, not only for its styling, but also because it remained the only truck in its class with an available V8 engine that rivaled many V8s found in full-sized trucks with payloads up to .
In the spring of 1998, a limited-edition R/T package was available as an option on the Dakota Sport model from 1998 to 2003. Available in 2WD, it included a 360 cid/5.9-liter V8 which produced at 4,400 rpm and 345 lb-ft of torque at 3,200 rpm, mated to a 46RE four-speed automatic. Notable features included special 17×9&quot; cast aluminum wheels mounted on P255/55R17 tires, monotone paint, bucket seats (with optional center console), thicker front and rear stabilizer bars, a rear axle with limited-slip differential, and suspension, braking, exhaust, and steering systems that were tuned for performance (the steering system from the R/T is the same as that from the standard Dakota), giving the R/T a ride height that was one inch lower than the standard Dakota. Chrome wheels were available on 2002 and 2003 models. Some of the last models made in 2003 came with the new stampede lower body cladding package and a chromed version of the original cast 17×9&quot; aluminum wheels at no extra charge. This version of the R/T Dakota was produced through 2003, with the newer 2003 R/T trucks designated as their own trim line, and no longer as part of an option package on the Dakota Sport trim. The Dakota R/T could accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 6.9 seconds and complete a quarter-mile sprint in just over 15 seconds. It had a maximum towing capacity of and a maximum payload capacity of .

Also in 1998, the Dakota R1 was released for production in Brazil through the efforts of a small team known as &quot;Truck Special Programs&quot; and featured a base four-cylinder engine and offered a 2.5L VMI turbodiesel along with a V8, all designed around a reinforced four-wheel-drive chassis used on both two- and four-wheel-drive models. Altogether, 28 roll-in-chassis R1 configurations were designed for the Brazilian market to be built at the Curitiba assembly facility as CKDs. This program was cancelled when Chrysler was purchased by Daimler.

Gone for 2000 was the 8-foot bed on the regular cab, but new for that year was the Quad Cab. Four-door Quad Cab models had a slightly shorter bed, , but riding on the Club Cab&#x27;s wheelbase. The Quad Cab featured a full-sized flip-up rear seat to provide room for three passengers in the back or room for cargo. The aging 5.2L Magnum V8 was replaced by the 4.7L SOHC PowerTech V8 that year, and the new 45RFE automatic transmission was introduced.

A revision of the interior was made for the 2001 models, including a completely redesigned dash, door panels, and revised seats. Other minor trim revisions were made, including redesigned aluminum wheels on various models. There were also new radio options, with only the standard AM/FM radio (with no cassette deck) being discontinued, making an AM/FM radio with a cassette deck standard on all models. The AM/FM radio with CD player or with both the cassette and CD players was also available.

The 2002 model was the final year for the four-cylinder engine in the Dakota, as Chrysler ended production of the American Motors Corporation design. Most were built with the V6 or V8 engines that were more powerful. An automatic transmission was not available with the four-cylinder engine. SIRIUS Satellite Radio was also now available as an option, and revised radios with new wiring harnesses could accommodate this new feature. A CD changer radio was also available, eliminating the need for a separately mounted unit located elsewhere inside the truck. The drivers could load up to six discs into the unit at a time and could switch out the discs at any time. Radio Data System became standard equipment on some radios.

The 2003 model marked the end of the OHV V6 and the big R/T V8; the 2004 model year vehicles were available with a new 3.7 L PowerTech V6 engine and the 4.7 L V8 variant.

In 2004, the cassette deck option was discontinued, and a CD player became standard equipment on all models.

This generation was also assembled and sold in Brazil from 1998 to 2001.

=== Trim levels ===
The 1997–2004 Dodge Dakota was available in several different trim levels:

The ST served as the base model of the Dakota. It included features such as an AM/FM stereo (later with cassette player) and a four-speaker sound system, vinyl-trimmed seating surfaces, front (or front and rear) bench seats, styled steel fifteen-inch (later sixteen-inch) wheels, and vinyl flooring. It also included, and was only available with, the 3.9L (later 3.7L) V6 engine. The ST was not offered as a four-door Quad Cab model.

The Sport served as the &quot;step-up&quot; Dakota model. It added the following features to the ST model: an AM/FM stereo with a cassette player (later, a single-disc CD player), cloth seating surfaces, sport-styled alloy wheels, and carpeted flooring. It was available with all engines except for the high-performance 5.9L V8 engine.

The SXT, introduced for the 2001 model year served as the &quot;mid-range&quot; Dakota model. It added the following features to the Sport model: an AM/FM stereo with a single-disc CD player, air conditioning, power windows and door locks with keyless entry (available as an option), and a premium interior. It was available with all engines except for the high-performance 5.9L V8 engine. An SXT Plus model was available that added &quot;value&quot; features such as an AM/FM stereo with cassette and single-disc CD players with integral CD changer controls, a premium cloth interior, and sixteen-inch alloy wheels.

The SLT was the &quot;top-line&quot; Dakota model from late 2000. It added the following features to the SXT model (2001 to 2004 model years) or the Sport model (1997 to 2000 model years): power windows and door locks (Sport only) with keyless entry, a premium interior (Sport only), and premium-styled alloy or chrome-clad wheels. It was available with all available engines on the Dakota. An SLT Plus Package was available that added &quot;value&quot; features to the SLT model, such as sixteen-inch alloy wheels, an AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD players (and integral CD changer controls on 2001 through 2004 model years), and a premium cloth interior.

The R/T, otherwise known as the 5.9 R/T, was known as the &quot;high-performance&quot; and &quot;top-line&quot; Dakota model from 1997 to 2003. It added the following features to the SLT model: sport front seats, sport-styled chrome-clad wheels, larger performance-rated tires, an AM/FM stereo with cassette and single-disc CD players, a six-speaker Infinity amplified premium audio system, and the high-performance 5.9L V8 engine. It was available in all available Dakota models except for the 4-door Quad Cab model.

== Third generation (2005–2011) ==
The redesigned 2005 Dakota still shared its platform with the new Dodge Durango SUV (which was now even more similar to the Ram platform). This model was longer and wider, and features a new front and rear suspension, and rack-and-pinion steering. This new generation model also reverted to five-lug wheels from the prior generation&#x27;s six-lug wheels to reduce costs and assembly times.

A V6 and two V8 engines were available: The standard engine is a 3.7L PowerTech V6; the two 4.7L V8 engines are the standard PowerTech V8 and the V8 High Output or HO. The 3.7L V6 produces and of torque. The standard-output 4.7L V8 produces and of torque. The high-output 4.7L V8 produces and of torque. Both the 3.7L and standard output 4.7L V8s were available with the six-speed manual transmission in 2005 and 2006. For 2007, that option was deleted on the V8 models.

In addition to a refresh of the styling, this generation was not offered in a regular cab model. Only the Club and Quad Cab configurations were available. The Dakota R/T returned in late 2005 for the 2006 model year, but only with cosmetic modifications. Despite the &quot;R/T&quot; moniker which signifies &quot;Road and Track,&quot; the newest Dakota R/T was simply an option package, characterized by a non-functional hood scoop, exclusive gauge cluster, and hockey stick–style side stripes. The package was available on both two- and four-wheel-drive models.

The facelifted third-generation Dakota was unveiled at the 2007 Chicago Auto Show as a 2008 model. The Dakota received another facelift and interior upgrade along with a few other upgrades, including built-in cargo-box utility rails, heated bench seats, best-in-class towing (up to ), the largest and longest standard bed in the class, and the largest mid-size truck cab. Its new 4.7L V8 produced and of torque. The standard engine remained the 3.7L V6 with and of torque. Production began in August 2007.

As of 2010, the Dakota was considered a part of the Ram lineup. However, the &quot;Dodge&quot; emblem still existed on the tailgate, and the truck was interchangeably referred to as a Ram Dakota or Dodge Dakota. Its Mitsubishi Raider sibling was discontinued in 2009.

The IIHS gave this generation a &quot;Good&quot; rating in the frontal offset crash test.

=== Models ===
Throughout its production run, the 2005 to 2011 Dodge Dakota was available in three basic models:

The ST served as the base Dakota model. It included the following features: sixteen-inch styled steel wheels, sixteen-inch tires, front cloth bench seats, vinyl-trimmed seating surfaces, manual windows and door locks, black plastic bumpers, an AM/FM stereo with a single-disc CD player (later, single-disc CD/MP3 player), and auxiliary audio input jack (on most models), a four-speaker sound system, air conditioning, a 3.7L &quot;PowerTech&quot; V6 engine came standard, or the optional 4.7L &quot;PowerTech&quot; V8 Engine also available on the ST model.

The SLT served as the &quot;mid-level&quot; Dakota model. It added the following features to the base ST model: sixteen-inch sport-styled alloy wheels, cloth seating surfaces, and power windows and door locks with keyless entry. The SLT was available with any engine offered on the Dakota. A Big Horn (or Lone Star in Texas) package was also available for the SLT model, which included &quot;value-added&quot; features, as was an SXT package that added a color-keyed front grille, color-keyed front and rear bumpers, and &quot;sport&quot; cloth seating surfaces.

The Laramie, otherwise known as the SLT Laramie, was the &quot;top-line&quot; Dakota model. It added the following features to the &quot;mid-level&quot; SLT model: seventeen-inch chrome-clad alloy wheels, seventeen-inch tires, an AM/FM stereo with a six-disc, in-dash CD/MP3 changer and auxiliary audio input jack (on most models), a premium Infinity (later Alpine) six-speaker amplified audio system, leather-trimmed heated seating surfaces, power front seats, a security system, a five-speed automatic transmission, and the base 4.7L &quot;PowerTech&quot; V8 engine, though the high-output version of the same engine was also available on the Laramie or SLT Laramie.

=== Safety ===
== Discontinuation ==
The third-generation Dakota was discontinued in 2011, with the last unit coming off the assembly line on August 23, 2011, ending the truck&#x27;s 25-year run. As of 2011, according to Sergio Marchionne, the CEO of Chrysler Group, the Dakota will probably not be replaced by a similar vehicle, mostly because of the declining popularity of compact trucks on the North American market (see Ford Ranger for similar outcome). Another problem was that buyers complained that the smaller pickup was not priced lower than the full-sized Ram 1500; nevertheless, the Dakota&#x27;s return continues to be reported since 2012. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced in September 2014 an agreement with Mitsubishi Motors to codevelop the next-generation Mitsubishi Triton/L200 to be sold globally by both companies. It is sold as RAM 1200 in some Middle Eastern countries.

<doc id="997416" wikidata="Q5427214" url="?curid=997416" title="FTP bounce attack">
<text>FTP bounce attack is an exploit of the FTP protocol whereby an attacker is able to use the command to request access to ports indirectly through the use of the victim machine, which serves as a proxy for the request, similar to an Open mail relay using SMTP.

This technique can be used to port scan hosts discreetly, and to potentially bypass a network&#x27;s Access-control list to access specific ports that the attacker cannot access through a direct connection, for example with the nmap port scanner. 

Nearly all modern FTP server programs are configured by default to refuse commands that would connect to any host but the originating host, thwarting FTP bounce attacks.

<text>The Dodge Durango is a mid-size SUV produced by Dodge starting with the 1998 model year. The first two generations were very similar in that both were based on the Dodge Dakota and Dodge Ram, both featured a body-on-frame construction and both were produced at the Newark Assembly Plant in Newark, Delaware through the 2009 model year.

The third-generation Durango began with the 2011 model year. It is built on the same platform as the Jeep Grand Cherokee, features unibody construction, and has been assembled at the Jefferson North Assembly Plant in Detroit, Michigan, since late 2010.

Each generation had options for different engine sizes and power ratings, with different transmissions also. In 2009 a hybrid variant was introduced, but ended quickly with the second generation Durango. From 2007 to 2009 the Durango was available as the Chrysler Aspen from Chrysler. Over two million Durangos have been sold since it was introduced in 1998.


==First generation (DN; 1997)==
The Durango was marketed as a sturdy truck-based SUV designed to hold up to seven passengers and tow up to when properly equipped. The Durango shared a front end, instrument panel, and front seats with the Dakota pickup on which it was based, and its taillights and liftgate handle with Chrysler&#x27;s minivan models of the time (the Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country). Original designs of the eight-passenger Durango featured a rear-facing third-row similar to many older station wagons. To make room for a more practical forward-facing third row, Dodge shortened the length of the front doors and raised the roof two inches (5 cm) beyond the front seats, allowing for stadium seating. The Durango&#x27;s roof rack was designed to mask the appearance of the raised roof.

The 4.7 L Magnum V8 replaced the 5.2 L Magnum V8 engine for 2000; however, the 5.2 was still available in the early 2000 models. In that same year, a special AWD performance version called the R/T was released with a 5.9 L Magnum V8. In 1999 and 2000, a limited-edition Shelby S.P.360 version was offered that featured a supercharged version of the 5.9 L Magnum V8 engine. Output is and of torque. Exterior modifications include unique wheels, tires, suspension, and bumpers. It came standard with Viper blue paint with two racing stripes down the center of the truck. It had a time of 7.1 seconds. The top speed was .

===Model year changes===

For 1999, the Durango was made available with two-wheel drive. A 3.9 L Magnum V6 engine was available, but few were sold. Minor changes were made for the second year, two new paint colors, and options that included heated rearview mirrors and steering-wheel-mounted radio controls. Leather seats became standard on SLT Plus models, and body-color wheel flares became standard on SLT Plus and four-wheel drive models.

The 2000 model year included a new 4.7 L Magnum V8 engine, which replaced the reliable 5.2 L Magnum V8, as the standard engine for four-wheel drive models. The 3.9 L Magnum V6 engine was no longer available, leaving only V8s for the rest of the production run. The high-performance Durango R/T came equipped with a performance-tuned 5.9 L Magnum V8 and all-wheel drive.

For 2001, Dodge focused on interior upgrades as Durango&#x27;s interior trim panels, dash-mounted controls, instrument panel, overhead console, and steering wheel were all redesigned. The transfer case selector on 4X4 models changed from a manual lever on the console to a switch on the dash. The instrument cluster was updated, and an electronic vehicle information center was incorporated into the overhead console. For improved rear passenger comfort, a dual-zone climate-control system was added as standard equipment. Sound systems were improved on all models and now came standard with six speakers. Other minor changes included door panels, revised seats, aluminum wheels, and minor changes to trim options.

In 2002, the new SXT version of the Durango was offered as the entry-level trim package. Optional side curtain airbags were added for safety. The 2003 Durango featured minor mechanical changes, most notable was the addition of four-wheel disc brakes.

In 1999, the 4WD 5.2 L V8 and the 4WD 5.9 L V8 held the best crash test results, earning a 6.8 out of 10 total rating.

===Trim levels===

==Second generation (HB; 2003)==
The second-generation Durango was first shown as a concept dubbed Dodge Durango R/T concept at the 2003 Detroit Auto Show. It debuted shortly before the companion Dakota. Like the Dakota, it has much in common with the large Dodge Ram pickup, including a fully boxed frame. It is longer, wider, and taller than the previous model. It also offered a third-row bench with three seats, giving it an eight-seat capacity. The design took its styling primarily from the Dodge Powerbox concept, which was itself based on the 1999 Dodge Power Wagon concept, and the 2003-2004 Durango R/T concept. The steering wheel and gauges are shared with the Dakota (2005-2011), and the steering wheel was only shared the Ram Pickup (2004-2008).

Debuting for 2004 was a new coil-spring rear suspension for the solid rear axle. A Watt&#x27;s linkage system is fitted to the rear axle, centering the axle and reducing rear-end skate over rough surfaces, and allowing a lower and wider cargo floor.

All trim levels offered the 4.7 L Power-Tech V8 engine as standard equipment, though the 5.7 L Hemi V8 engine was available on all trim levels, except for the base SXT trim level. The base SXT trim level also offered the 3.7 L Power-Tech V6 engine as standard equipment in place of the 5.7 L Hemi V8 engine option, though the V6 engine option was only available on the base SXT trim level, and only between 2004 and 2007.

The 2004 Dodge Durango was the first SUV in DaimlerChrysler&#x27;s lineup to introduce the 5.7 L Hemi V8 engine, as well as a new radio design and modernized interior features.

===Facelift===
The 2007 model year featured a facelift that debuted at the Dallas Auto Show in April 2006. It featured a redesigned grille, hood, headlamps, fenders, and wheels. New features included electronic stability control, rear park assist, and a one-touch turn signal.

In 2006, DaimlerChrysler introduced a full-size luxury SUV based on the Durango, called the Chrysler Aspen, for the 2007 model year.

=== Hybrid ===
For 2009, a hybrid variant of the Dodge Durango and its brother, the Chrysler Aspen, was introduced, This system used the GM-designed two-stage hybrid system and added two 87 hp electric motors to the 5.7L V8 with a total system output of around 400 horsepower. All Durango and Aspen hybrids came standard with 4-wheel drive. The whole hybrid setup increased the weight of the car by and cost an additional $4,000 over the standard 5.7L Durango/Aspen. The fuel economy for the Durango/Aspen hybrid was improved to 19 miles per gallon in the city, and 20 on the highway, increased from the Hemi&#x27;s 13 city, 18 highway. But, two months after the car debuted, Chrysler discontinued the hybrid, citing demand had dropped for their full size SUVs due to economic slowdown. They also announced the shutting down of Newark Assembly plant where the hybrid versions were made. Estimated overall production figures for the Durango and Aspen hybrid is around 800 cars.

===Chrysler Aspen===

The Chrysler Aspen is a luxury SUV from Chrysler. Launched for the 2007 model year, the Aspen was based on the second generation Durango.

The Aspen was the first truck-based SUV commercialized under the Chrysler brand, although the PT Cruiser was the first truck-based Chrysler brand vehicle as classified under Corporate Average Fuel Economy&#x27;s (CAFE) regulation. With this introduction, as of 2007, all American automobile brands had an SUV in their range. The Aspen was unveiled at the 2005 North American International Auto Show. It came equipped with three rows of seating for eight passengers and available all-wheel drive, and was only available in one single trim, Limited.

The vehicle appears in the 2006 film &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; and game &quot;The Movies: Stunts and Effects&quot; released the same year.

Partly due to slow sales, but mostly because the Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep network of dealers merged, it was discontinued after the 2009 model year. However, the Dodge Durango Citadel covers the mid-size luxury SUV segment as of 2011.

===Discontinuation===
In October 2008, Chrysler announced that the shutdown of the Newark Assembly facility, which produced the Durango and the Chrysler Aspen, would be moved up to the end of 2008, thereby ending production of the Aspen and Durango after the 2009 model year. Production ceased on December 19, 2008.
==Third generation (WD; 2011)==
=== Overview ===
After announcing the discontinuation of the Durango after the 2009 model year, Dodge released an Internet site and teaser photos of the third-generation Dodge Durango on August 16, 2010.

The 2011 Dodge Durango entered production on December 14, 2010, alongside the second-generation Charger in the 2011 vehicle lineup. It went on sale for general dealership availability in mid-January 2011.

The third-generation Durango is built alongside the Jeep Grand Cherokee at the Jefferson North Assembly Plant in Detroit, Michigan, sharing the assembly line, running gear, powertrains, and chassis parts with the Grand Cherokee. With a slightly longer wheelbase than the Grand Cherokee, the Durango features three rows of seating.

The third-generation Durango features four engines. The base engine is a new 3.6-liter V6 engine producing and of torque at 4,800 rpm; 90% of peak torque is available from 1,600 to 6,400 rpm. The Pentastar V6 engine is backed by a Mercedes W5A580 five-speed automatic, with Chrysler&#x27;s controls and the driver-interactive control. Since 2014, Dodge had exclusively used the ZF eight-speed gearbox in two versions in the Durango. All V8&#x27;s have the ZF 8HP, with all V6s using the Chrysler-built 850re version of the ZF 8HP. The 5.7-liter Hemi VVT V8 returned with and of torque, which features the 545RFE five-speed automatic. The Hemi V8 also comes with a &quot;fuel-saver&quot; (cylinder deactivation) mode. This feature is primarily used when the vehicle is cruising at constant speeds on level ground. In 2021, a supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8 was introduced for the SRT Hellcat trim level. The supercharged 6.2 L Hemi V8 along with the Durango SRT Hellcat trim level was discontinued for the 2022 model year as the engine was unable to be modified further to comply with more stringent automotive emissions requirements. However, emissions changes were adopted for the 2023 model year that allowed the SRT Hellcat trim to return. 

===Updates===

Dodge unveiled its revised 2014 model Durango at the 2013 New York International Auto Show. The 2014 Durango was redesigned with sportier-looking lines, an eight-speed automatic transmission, and a new design trim similar to the Rallye, with a blackened plastic bumper and outline. The taillights were reworked to feature a single LED &#x27;Racetrack&#x27; tail lamp similar to the Charger and Dart. On the inside, Dodge added a revised steering wheel, instrument cluster, rotary shift knob, and a reconfigurable thin film transistor display first seen on the Dart.

The 2015 Durango received a new package available for the R/T trim, consisting of a Premium Nappa Leather Group option featuring radar red leather seats, , black headlamp bezels, HID low beams and LED DRL&#x27;S, optional R/T embroidery on the seats, a nine-speaker sound system with a subwoofer, a 5.7 L Hemi paired with ZF&#x27;s eight-speed transmission, and a Granite Crystal wheel finished in black.

For 2016 the Durango received the Pentastar Upgrade V6 which adds Stop/Start, Variable Valve Lift and better engine refinement through a 15% enhanced torque curve and increasing the Variable Valve Timing from 50 degrees to 70 degrees. Other technologies include Cooled EGR and friction reduction. Despite the added tech, the engine weighs less. Power output and torque remain the same at and (single exhaust) or and torque (dual exhaust). The Durango also added new packages to its two trims, with the Anodized Platinum package for the Citadel trim and the Brass Monkey package for the Limited trim.

For 2017, the Dodge Durango Limited trim was discontinued and replaced by the new GT trim and the Base SXT trim level will now be available with three-row seating fitting seven passengers.

For 2018, all models received the new Uconnect radios and the second-generation ZF 8-speed automatic transmission. The rotary transmission gear shifter has been replaced with a T-grip handle like in the Dodge Charger. The steering wheel has also been changed to a more sporty wheel like found in the Dodge Charger. Other changes include suede insert leather seats and black chrome inserts in the interior on the GT model.

For 2019: The Tow Group IV package gets an integrated trailer brake controller. The Dodge Durango GT trim gets the R/T- and SRT-style grille. A new GT Plus trim is added which adds several amenities to the GT trim, such as heated front and second-row seats and steering wheel; 6-way passenger power seat with 4-way lumbar adjustment; two-position memory for the driver&#x27;s seat, radio, and mirrors; a power liftgate; and 150W inverter.

For 2021, the Durango receives updated exterior styling, with a revised bumper and headlights, three grille textures, and six new wheel designs. The interior features a new instrument panel with Uconnect 5; an 8.4-inch screen is standard on SXT and GT models, while R/T and Citadel models have a 10.1-inch touchscreen. An SRT Hellcat model with a 710 hp supercharged 6.2 L Hemi V8 was available for 2021 only, after which it was discontinued due to emissions requirements. With the discontinuation of the smaller Journey, the Durango becomes the only SUV in the Dodge vehicle lineup as of 2021.

For 2023, Dodge restructured the entire Durango lineup, dividing each individual model into three different trim levels: &quot;Base&quot; (without an additional trim level designation), &quot;Plus&quot;, and &quot;Premium&quot; (the latter available on GT models and above). A new &quot;HEMI Orange Edition&quot; R/T model, based on the R/T Premium trim, adds an asymmetrical HEMI Orange accent strip on the front hood of the vehicle, as well as a HEMI Orange-accented Dodge emblem on the front grille, HEMI orange-painted brake calipers (only when equipped with the R/T HEMI Orange Tow N Go Package), dark exterior accents, and HEMI orange stitching on the interior. Due to the restructuring of the trim lineup, there are now fewer available options and package on each model, as the previously-available options and packages are now consolidated into the three trim levels. The SXT Plus now carries a lower Manufacturer&#x27;s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) than the base SXT, starting $450 less at $40,140 versus $40,590. SXT, SXT Plus, and GT are now the only trims of the Durango lineup to feature the standard U Connect 5 8.4 infotainment system, as all other trims now feature the upgraded U Connect 5 10.1 infotainment system as standard equipment.

=== Recalls ===
On August 16, 2012, Chrysler recalled 1,661 2013-model Dodge Durango sport utility vehicles in the United States and Canada because some airbags may not deploy in an accident. The recall affects 1,449 of the seven-passenger versions of the SUVs in the United States and 212 in Canada and other markets.

On July 24, 2015, Chrysler recalled all 2014-2015 Dodge Durangos with the touch-screens due to security concerns with the software that controls the vehicle because it could be hacked. The vulnerability was discovered by software engineers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek and initially posted on &quot;Wired&quot;. This vulnerability would allow hackers to remotely access and take over a variety of features, including those key parts of driving via a vulnerability in the Uconnect infotainment system.

On November 26, 2019, Chrysler issued a recall of 700,000 2011-2013 Durangos and Jeep Grand Cherokees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, because of an electrical failure that can cause the engine not to start or stop functioning while it is driving. There are no reports of accidents. The FCA group announced a free revision to both models and replacement of these pieces involved in the problem.

<text>The Dodge Aspen, and its badge engineered variant, the Plymouth Volaré, are compact rear-drive cars manufactured and marketed by Chrysler for model years 1976-1980 in four-door sedan, two-door coupe, and four-door wagon styles.

During the Volaré/Aspen&#x27;s production, North American automakers were actively &quot;downsizing&quot; their lineups, reducing size and weight for improved fuel economy — and the industry was reclassifying its size nomenclature. The Volaré/Aspen were thus classified originally as compact cars and as intermediate-sized cars by the time their production ended.

The Volaré/Aspen were discontinued following the 1980 model year prior to the introduction of the front-wheel-drive Plymouth Reliant and Dodge Aries, known collectively as K-cars.

== Background ==
The Volaré and the Aspen were introduced mid-cycle for model year 1976 as successors to the Chrysler &quot;A-platform&quot; models, the Plymouth Valiant/Plymouth Duster and Dodge Dart. During the 1976 model year, Valiant/Duster models were marketed alongside the Volaré at Chrysler/Plymouth dealerships, and the Dart models were marketed alongside the Aspen at Dodge dealerships. After the 1976 model year, Valiant and Dart models were discontinued.

Chrysler conceived the Volaré and Aspen as modern, fuel-efficient cars, more luxurious their Valiant and Dart predecessors. They were together named Motor Trend&#x27;s &quot;Car of the Year&quot; for 1976, and they were noted by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; magazine for their modern design and good performance. The Volaré and Aspen ultimately suffered numerous quality problems, frequent product recalls, and early rust damage that seriously damaged the cars&#x27; reputation and sales.

== Production history ==
During development, the Volaré/Aspen models were extensively wind-tunnel tested to improve their aerodynamics, reduce wind drag and improve fuel economy, improve crosswind stability, reduce wind noise, and increase interior ventilation performance. The testing led designers to soften the front end contours and remove roof-drip moldings, and at the same time improve internal airflow ducting. Body engineering for the Volaré/Aspen implemented computer-aided design and clear plastic stress models to reveal stress points in the design phase before any sheet metal was formed, to reduce weight and improve fuel economy by using thinner glass, lighter side door beams, and high-strength/low alloy steel (HSLA) — four times as strong as conventional mild steel. A reduced number of steel stampings offered improved panel fits with fewer welds. Larger glass areas increased visibility, with a total glass area increase of 25% on two-door models and 33% on sedans.

With the Volare/Aspen twins, Chrysler introduced a new front suspension system using crossed torsion bars mounted transversely beneath the engine (marketed as &quot;Isolated Transverse Suspension System&quot;), provided a noticeable improvement over Chrysler&#x27;s long used the longitudinal torsion bar suspension, introduced in 1957. The new torsion bar system, though not geometrically as favorable as its predecessor, saved space and weight — as was marketed as giving a &quot;big car ride&quot; with a softer, fore-and-aft compliance. This allowed the wheels to move rearward, instead of straight up and down, when the tires encountered an object, thereby dampening the blow and &quot;rolling with&quot; the bump rather than resisting it. The two transverse torsion bars were mounted along with an anti-sway bar forward of the front wheels, integrating both into a spring-strut front suspension. These components were attached to a K-shaped structural cross member, which itself was isolated from the unitized car body by four rubber mounts. The steering column was also rubber-isolated. Wheel alignment adjustments such as caster and camber could be made by removing plates over the wheel housings. Chrysler Corporation also employed the Isolated Transverse Suspension System with their M- and J-platform models.

The rear suspension of the Volaré/Aspen was more traditional for Chrysler passenger cars,using a conventional leaf spring (semi-elliptical) suspension system. However, this leaf spring arrangement was also rubber-isolated, which eliminated a metal-to-metal path through which road noise or vibration could be transmitted to the body.

Several 1976 Dodge Aspen sedans served as test vehicles for a gas turbine engine installation, in a project sponsored by the United States Department of Energy. Testing began in August 1976. This new turbine engine was a smaller version of Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s earlier turbine engine. At the time, the hope was that turbine engines would be cleaner and more efficient than comparably powerful V8 engines, but numerous technical challenges eventually ended automotive turbine engine development.

=== Marketing ===
According to R. M. &quot;Ham&quot; Schirmer, manager of Dodge car and corporate advertising for Chrysler, the &quot;Aspen&quot; name originated from the codename &quot;Aspen-Vail&quot; when development for it and the Plymouth &quot;sister car&quot; began in 1971. &quot;Aspen is a very pleasant name&quot;, Schirmer said, &quot;people think of the outdoors, but not necessarily skiing when they hear it ... it won&#x27;t inhibit where we want to position the car because it&#x27;s basically neutral.&quot; Nonetheless, Chrysler sponsored the 1976 Dodge Aspen Team K2 Freestyle and opened up World Pro Skiing&#x27;s seventh season, in Aspen, Colorado, as the Dodge Aspen Cup, running courses on Aspen Highlands and Aspen Mountain. Actor Rex Harrison served as pitchman in an advertising campaign for the Dodge Aspen that was inspired by the &quot;Ascot Gavotte&quot; scene in the 1964 movie &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, which starred Harrison. In TV and radio advertisements, Harrison performed a &quot;patter song&quot; using the word &quot;unbelievable&quot; spoken in rhythm.

The &quot;Volaré&quot; name is Spanish for &quot;I will fly away&quot; or &quot;I will blow away&quot;; it is also Italian for &quot;to fly&quot;. In print and broadcast media, singer Sergio Franchi was featured in Volaré advertisements. Franchi sang the pop song &quot;Volare&quot;, with altered lyrics, in TV and radio commercials for the car. (The accent mark used in the car&#x27;s name is not in the Italian word or the song title; Volaré commercials described it as an &quot;accent on quality&quot;.)

=== 1976 ===
As replacements for the venerable Plymouth Valiant and Dodge Dart, the Volaré/Aspen twins shared the same engine and transmission choices and three-box body style with their predecessors, but not much else.

Available as a four-door wagon, four-door sedan or a two-door coupe, Volaré/Aspen models came in three trim levels: The base model, the &quot;custom&quot; (for both models), and the &quot;Premier&quot; for the Volaré and &quot;SE&quot; (special edition) for the Aspen.

In their introductory year, the Volaré and the Aspen differed only in their rear taillight styling, front grill and parking light location, and location of their side trim strips (lower for the Volaré, higher for the Aspen). Their interiors were completely identical and lacked any kind of branding or differentiation as it was not possible to tell from inside the car whether it was a Volaré or an Aspen. Body styles, engine and transmission options, colors, trim options, and other features were identical.

Coupes featured frameless door glass but—likely to improve rollover safety—a thick &quot;B&quot; pillar was used, replacing the popular hardtop body style of the Valiant and Dart. The &quot;performance&quot; packages (&quot;Road Runner&quot; for the Volaré, &quot;R/T&quot; for the Aspen) were available only on two-door models; they featured mostly trim items and heavy duty suspension systems. The standard engine was Chrysler&#x27;s slant six, and was available with a single-barrel carburetor. Optional engines were a V8 or a V8, both with two-barrel carburetors.

Total production was 189,900 (Aspen) and 255,008 (Volaré).

=== 1977 ===
The second model year for the Volaré/Aspen was mostly a carryover, but there were some significant changes. The standard slant-six engine was supplemented by an optional &quot;Super Six&quot; version that employed a two-barrel carburetor; this setup had previously been available in Australian and Latin American markets roughly ten years prior. Along with improved performance, this option also helped with the poor drivability problems that plagued the 1976 models. A new T-top removable roof panel option was available for the coupe. Both the Volaré and the Aspen coupe models also offered &quot;performance&quot; appearance packages that consisted of front and rear spoilers, wheel opening flares, and louvered rear windows; the Volaré Road Runner package called these additional options the &quot;Fun Runner&quot; options, while the Aspen R/T package called these additions the &quot;Super Pak&quot; option.

The Plymouth Volaré was Canada&#x27;s top-selling car this year. Total production was 327,739 (Volaré) and 266,012 (Aspen).

=== 1978 ===
The trim line arrangement was changed for 1978. Instead of having separate base, custom, and high-line Volaré premier/Aspen SE models, there was simply the base model, to which the buyer could add custom and premier/SE option packages. For their third production year, the Volaré and Aspen received their first visual update in the form of new front grille and fascia treatments. Starting with the 1978 model year, the standard three-speed manual transmission was no longer available with its shift lever mounted on the steering column; both the standard three-speed and the four-speed overdrive transmissions were only available with their shift levers mounted on the floor. New performance and trim packages for both models included the &quot;kit car&quot; and the &quot;Super Coupe&quot;, which combined performance trim with the V8, but the six-cylinder engine was standard.

The Volaré or Aspen &quot;kit car&quot;, made in honor of NASCAR legend Richard Petty, was supposed to look as much like a race car as possible. The wheels had no hubcaps, the wheel opening flares had a bolted-on look, and even the windshield had metal tie-downs just like the race cars. Unlike a race car, the kit car came standard with an automatic transmission. A special addition was a decal kit with large door mountable &quot;43&quot; decals and &quot;360&quot; decals for the hood. These decals were shipped in the trunk either to be installed by the dealer or by the owner. It was available in blue for the Volaré or red for the Aspen. Only 131 Dodges and 145 Plymouths were built. 

The Volaré and Aspen Super Coupe packages (order code A67) included GR60x15 Goodyear GT radial tires on 15x8-inch wheels, Code &quot;E58&quot; 360CID 4bbl engine,727HD transmission, heavy-duty suspension with a rear sway bar. The appearance was altered drastically from a standard Aspen/ Volare by adding Matte Black finishes on the entire hood, top of fenders, half the roof, both bumpers and misc. other trim. Along with that Blacked out look were full Matt Black wheel well flairs giving a widebody appearance along with a front spoiler attached to the front flairs. A 3-piece trunk tail spoiler was also included. Each were offered as a design package leaving no choice of paint colors. All Dodge Aspen versions were Sable Tan Sunfire Metallic (a rich Dark Brown) with orange, blue and yellow stripes to separate Body color from the Black. Volaré versions were all painted Crimson Sunfire Metallic (a Maroon/Red) with its own special three-color stripes in Yellow, Orange and Red separating the body color from the Black. Only 494 Volare and 531 Dodge Super Coupes were built.
Wider tail light lenses with amber turn signals replaced the previous all-red lenses on Volaré and Aspen coupes and sedans.

For the 1978 model year, sales were down over 30% from 1977; total production came to 166,419 (Aspen) and 217,795 (Volaré). 

=== 1979 ===
The 1979 model year saw few changes. The only visible difference was the replacement of the amber rear turn signals with red ones. For the Volaré, a new coupe-only &quot;Duster&quot; trim package mirrored the Aspen &quot;Sunrise&quot; package, consisting mainly of new stripes and louvered rear windows. The 1978 option packages continued into 1979, with the exception of the super coupe and kit car options. A federally-mandated maximum speedometer, new colors, and a diagnostic connector for the engine were added. Station wagon models were available with a &quot;sport package&quot; (Volaré) or as a &quot;sport wagon&quot; (Aspen) with special stripes, a front air dam, and wheel arch flares.

Total 1979 production came to 178,819 (Volaré) and 121,354 (Aspen). 

=== 1980 ===

For its final year of production, and at the insistence of Lee Iacocca, the Volaré and Aspen were restyled. They gained new front styling (very similar to the Ford Fairmont) with a thin grille and rectangular headlamps. This was achieved by sharing the hood, fenders, and front bumper with the Dodge Diplomat. Premier and SE packages were available, but now only available on the sedan and coupe. The Volaré Duster trim package was also available for the 1980 model year. The R/T package was installed on 285 Aspens for this year.

The V8 was dropped for 1980, leaving the V8 as the top engine choice. Power from the 318 V8 engine was reduced from at 4,000 rpm to at 3,600 rpm in two-barrel models. Four-barrel versions of the 318 V8 saw their output increase from (non-California) at 4,000 rpm to at 4,000 rpm. The slant six engine remained the base engine offering. The Super Six two-barrel carburetor option was dropped, leaving only the single-barrel, Holley 1945 carburetor for the venerable slant six engine. In this configuration, the slant six produced at 3,600 rpm.

Total production came to 67,318 (Aspen) and 90,063 (Volaré), though a significant portion of the sales were for fleet (police and taxi) use.

=== Volaré Road Runner / Aspen R/T ===

The Plymouth Volaré Road Runner and the Dodge Aspen R/T coupes were the &quot;performance&quot; trim levels of the Volaré/Aspen models. They came with E70x14 tires, &quot;rallye&quot; wheels, a grille blackout treatment, body striping, and identifying decals and medallions. A V8 option, with a and of torque, was offered. (The V8 option was unavailable in California because the engine, which averaged did not meet California fuel economy regulations.) In a &quot;Motor Trend&quot; road test, a Dodge Aspen R/T equipped with this engine turned in a standing quarter mile at 17.4 seconds at a speed of . The R/T also made a run in 13.8 seconds. Unlike the 225 slant six and both the 318 and 360 &quot;LA&quot; V8s were not available with the four-speed overdrive transmission, only Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s Model 727 three-speed automatic transmission.

=== Station wagons ===
The Volaré/Aspen twins offered station wagon models that became the first domestic compact-sized competition for the AMC Hornet four-door &quot;sportabout&quot; wagon. The Volaré/Aspen wagons also featured a liftgate with a fixed rear window, rather than the more typical drop-down tailgate with roll-down rear window.

The new models had cargo volumes of and load capacities of , which was only less than the intermediate and standard size Chrysler wagons. The liftgate opening was nearly wide and high. With the rear seat folded down, the cargo area was long at the beltline and wide between the wheelhouses. Side covers of the cargo area were made of one-piece injection molded polypropylene. Covered, lockable stowage compartments of capacity were provided in these panels; these compartments were standard on the Volaré Premier and the Aspen SE, and optional on the low-line wagons.

Top-trim Volaré Premier and Aspen SE station wagon models featured simulated woodgrain on its exterior side panels. Volaré Premier wagons trimmed the &quot;woodgrain&quot; side panels with stainless steel frames accented in matte black; Aspen SE models offered frames that were simulated blond (painted metal) wood-look trim. Aside from the brand badging and grilles unique on each brand, this station wagon trim element remains one of the few visual clues that differentiated the Volaré from the Aspen.

== International markets ==
Between 1977 and 1979, the small Swiss specialty automaker Monteverdi built 20 modified versions of the Volaré/Aspen called the Sierra to compete in Europe&#x27;s luxury car market.

The &quot;Dart&quot; name (rather than &quot;Aspen&quot;) was applied to Dodge-branded F-platform cars in Mexico and Colombia, corresponding to the local Chrysler-branded F-platform cars badged as &quot;Valiant Volarés&quot;. F-body Volaré models were not marketed under the &quot;Plymouth&quot; brand in Mexico because that brand was dropped after 1969.

During 1981 and 1982, Dart coupes built for the Mexican market used an M-platform Diplomat coupe that was fitted with a 1980 Volare header panel. Chrysler de México also sold less-expensive versions of the American K-cars: The Plymouth Reliant and Dodge Aries (in 1982–1987) and Plymouth Caravelle (1988) as &quot;Chrysler Volarés&quot;.

The 1988 Chrysler Volaré E (an inexpensive version of the 1988 Plymouth Caravelle modified with a 1986–1988 Plymouth Reliant front end) served as Mexican Highway Patrol units from 1988 to 1990. They used Chrysler Turbo II 2.2 L engines and three-speed automatic transmissions (arm shifter on the steering columns, like U.S. patrol cars). In Mexico, they were known as &quot;turbo-patrols&quot;.

The Volaré also became known as the &quot;Volaré Duster&quot; in Canada.

==Recalls and reputation==
The Volaré/Aspen were recalled numerous times; for the 1976 model year, there were at least eight serious recalls alone.

They included:
* Potential failure of a component in the front suspension, which could cause the suspension to detach from the front subframe under hard braking;
* Possibility that the secondary hood latch could not properly hold the hood closed;
* Front brake lines, routed underneath the battery, that could corrode from spilled battery acid and lead to brake failure;
* Seat belts that could unlatch during hard deceleration (such as an accident or hard braking), thereby preventing them from protecting the occupant;
* Misrouted fuel vapor line that could rub against the alternator drive belt, possibly resulting in a fire;
* Replacement of front fenders that corroded prematurely (sometimes in less than a year) because of an ill-advised cost-saving decision not to install front inner fender shields;
* At least one recall to address chronic stalling and drivability problems.

Chronic problems with stalling and poor drivability led to a horrible reputation that the Volaré/Aspen quickly gained as new buyers were to discover for themselves; premature rusting problems soon followed. In 1977, 1,300,000 Chrysler Corporation models were recalled for these drivability problems.

It is possible that much of the product-defect difficulty with the Volaré/Aspen models could have been avoided if Chrysler Corporation had taken more time to fully develop the cars before offering them to the market, but in an effort to boost sales and get a badly needed infusion of cash, Chrysler Corporation launched the Volaré/Aspen models as quickly as possible. This reputation for poor-build quality led to a decline in sales as the Volaré/Aspen twins became the most-recalled automobile models to that date. Winners of the Motor Trend &quot;Car of the Year&quot;, the Aspen and Volaré later received the &quot;Lemon of the Year&quot; award from the Center for Auto Safety, the consumer watchdog group founded by Ralph Nader.

== Replacements for the Volaré/Aspen ==
In 1980, the Volaré/Aspen cars were replaced with the front-wheel drive Plymouth Reliant and Dodge Aries for the 1981 model year.

However, a new class of the F-platform emerged as the M-Body vehicles that included the Dodge Diplomat and Plymouth Gran Fury four-door sedans, which were very similar in structure, size, and engineering with the Aspen and Volaré.

The Aspen model name was revived in 2007 for the Chrysler Aspen luxury sport utility vehicle (SUV).

<doc id="997426" wikidata="Q6776376" url="?curid=997426" title="Martin Pike (Australian footballer)">
<text>Martin Pike (born 14 November 1972) is a former professional Australian rules footballer, who played in four Australian Football League (AFL) premiership sides. A tough, versatile wingman, Pike has been described as a &quot;natural player&quot; of the game. Highlights of his career included a premiership with the North Melbourne Football Club, three more with Brisbane, the final AFL best-and-fairest winner with Fitzroy in 1996, and selection in the 1998 South Australian State-Of-Origin side.

==Early career==
Pike was born in Glenelg, South Australia, and made his senior debut with South Australian National Football League (SANFL) side Norwood in 1990. He was drafted by Melbourne Football Club with their first choice (ninth overall) in the 1992 AFL Draft. Pike made his AFL debut in 1993, playing eight games at centre half-back and a further 16 matches in 1994, including three finals.

Despite his strong on-field performance, Melbourne traded Pike to Fitzroy Football Club at the end of 1994 due to his off-field problems with alcohol.

After playing 14 games for Fitzroy in 1995, Pike played all 22 games in 1996, winning Fitzroy&#x27;s best-and-fairest award, beating later Port Adelaide captain Matthew Primus for the honour. However, in late 1996, via a deal with the administrator of the Fitzroy Football Club at the time, the Brisbane Bears took over Fitzroy&#x27;s AFL operations. Pike was not selected as one of the eight Fitzroy players to move north to Brisbane at the end of 1996, largely due to his poor off-field reputation. In July 1996 he was found guilty of drink driving for the third time and was fined $1000, lost his licence for five years and sentenced to six months jail, but avoided having to go to jail, being able to serve the sentence at home under an intensive correction order.

==North Melbourne 1997–2000==
Hoping in part to capitalise in part on the bad feeling many Victorian based Fitzroy supporters had about the failed merger with the North Melbourne Football Club, and about the way the deal with Bears was executed, the 1996 Premiers, North Melbourne, recruited a number of former Fitzroy players, including Pike, in the 1996 AFL Draft.

Pike had a solid year in 1997: North finished third and South Australia included him in their 1998 State of Origin squad. His work off the halfback line and on the wings generated many opportunities for the team&#x27;s forwards. Pike was a member of the North Melbourne Grand Final team that lost to Adelaide Football Club in 1998 after winning the minor premiership that year before becoming a member of the Kangaroos&#x27; premiership winning team in 1999, fulfilling a lifelong ambition.

However, due to poor form in 2000, combined with discipline issues off the field (including a widely reported late arrival to a compulsory club function), North Melbourne delisted him at the end of 2000.

==Brisbane Lions 2001–2005==
The Brisbane Lions recruited Pike in the 2000 AFL Draft after impressing coach Leigh Matthews in an interview, although Pike&#x27;s reputation was poor enough for Matthews to consult his leading players before committing to the wayward footballer. Pike quickly proved himself at his fourth club, playing 22 games in 2001 as the club won its first premiership. Now with family commitments, Pike was a reformed character, with increased professionalism and none of the poor off-field behaviour that had marred his career at his previous clubs.

In 2002, Brisbane won their second successive premiership with Pike playing a wide variety of roles. He again played a key role in many of the games won in 2003, including kicking three goals in the final quarter of the preliminary final against the Sydney Swans to get the team into its third successive winning grand final.

The Lions reached their fourth successive grand final in 2004 but lost to Port Adelaide Football Club in the grand final. Pike was disappointed with his performance in that match, and was reportedly involved in an altercation with a club official in the early hours of the morning on return to Brisbane, the only display of the behaviour which caused him problems before signing with the Lions. Despite resulting speculation that his contract would not be renewed he accepted a one-year contract for 2005. However, Pike&#x27;s season was heavily disrupted by injury and he was unable to add more than a handful of games to his career tally before announcing his retirement on 2 August 2005 with four matches remaining in the regular season.

==After retirement==
In February 2006, the Hastings Football Club in the rural Victorian Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League announced that Pike had accepted an offer to coach the club for the upcoming season. He made an appearance in the 2006 AFL Legends Match. He continued as senior coach of the Hastings Football Club in 2007. He was the coach of VFL reserve side, Northern Bullants for the 2009 season. In 2010 Pike was appointed to the position of Senior Coach of the Power House Football Club in the Victorian Amateur Football Association.

<doc id="997431" wikidata="Q655498" url="?curid=997431" title="Dodge Diplomat">
<text>The Dodge Diplomat is an American mid-size car that was produced by Dodge from 1977 to 1989. At launch, it shared a common design with the Chrysler LeBaron and for much of its later production run was the counterpart of the more upscale Chrysler Fifth Avenue and lower priced Plymouth Gran Fury. It was also sold in Mexico between 1981 and 1982 as the Dodge Dart, and in Colombia as the Dodge Coronet. The Diplomat was initially offered in a coupe and a sedan; in 1978, station wagons were added as replacements for the discontinued full-sized C-body wagons.

The Diplomat was offered with a straight-6 engine a well as optional and V8s. The Diplomat, along with its Plymouth Gran Fury/Caravelle twin, were popular police cars both in North America. The three-speed Torqueflite automatic transmission was most popular, but a manual transmission was available until 1981 only on six cylinder and 318 V8 models.

==Background==
The Diplomat name was originally used by Dodge on 2-door hardtop models from 1950 to 1954. It was also used on the export version of the DeSoto from 1946 through 1962. From 1975 through 1977, the Diplomat name was also used on a trim package available on the Royal Monaco two-door hardtop. Starting with the 1977 model year, the Diplomat became a full model line, rather than as the name of a particular body style.

==First generation (1977)==

Introduced as a late 1977 model during spring 1977, the first generation Diplomats were a longer, designated as Chrysler&#x27;s M Body cars sharing much with the Chrysler LeBaron, both of which shared much with F-body Aspen and Plymouth Volare. The chassis and mechanical components are similar with doors and various other body panels interchangeable with the Aspens. Unique to the Diplomat were the front and rear header panels, bumpers, hood and trunk lid. Larger taillights extended into the rear hatch of the station wagon. The station wagons were shorter than the sedans and coupes, which had unique bodywork with a longer rear overhang. The station wagon, introduced for the 1978 model year, used the same rear sheetmetal as the Aspen/Volaré, albeit with its own wraparound taillights.
The first year models were available in base and Medallion trim levels; the base engine was the 318 Lean Burn V8 developing and the Slant Six was a credit option. A vinyl roof was standard on sedans, while a simulated landau roof cover was an option on coupes. For 1978 the Slant Six with a four-speed manual transmission became the base drivetrain, and the station wagon was added. The wagon featured &quot;teakwood&quot;-grain body appliques (a delete option) and was only available in base trim. The sedans and coupes continued largely unchanged, but a low-cost &quot;Diplomat S&quot; was added. This model was offered for one year, and the 3,322 produced represented only about 5% of overall Diplomat production in 1978. The V8&#x27;s output dropped by five horsepower, but on the other hand, a V8 became a new option.

For the 1979 model year, the Diplomat received a minor facelift. The grille was now divided into three rows of eight rectangular openings with an internal crosshatch pattern and a broad band on top. The sedan and coupe taillights were also altered, now with a horizontal theme while divided down the middle. The lineup was rearranged, with the base model decontented and a Salon model (corresponding to last year&#x27;s base version) fitting in the middle below the Medallion. The new base model did not receive the padded vinyl roof (sedans). Coupes had a new landau top design, with much smaller rear side windows. The station wagon came in Salon trim, without any actual changes in equipment. The Slant Six, meanwhile, was available with a single-barrel carburetor and . V8 outputs dropped by five horsepower, to respectively, but optional was a four-barrel 360 producing . This was the last year for the 360 engine in the Diplomat.

==Second generation (1980)==

The 1980 model year brought new exterior sheet metal for the Diplomat, although wagons were unchanged from the doors back. While the previous coupes used the same 112.7 inch wheelbase as the other models, the 1980 coupe used the 108 inch wheelbase of the Aspen coupe (though the square body was very different). The front end was more evolutionary than revolutionary, but in order to share a hood with the newly restyled Chrysler LeBaron the grille was narrowed considerably. The roofline of the sedan was also made more square, marginally improving headroom, and conservative, Buick-like taillights appeared on all but the wagons. Manual transmissions were dropped. Following the discontinuing of the Dodge St. Regis R-body in 1981, the Diplomat became the largest sedan in the Dodge lineup, despite technically being a mid-size car. Dodge would not market another truly full-size car (at least based upon United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) passenger volume statistics) until the Monaco debuted as a 1990 model.

By 1981, Chrysler was switching to smaller front-wheel drive designs. However, its older and larger rear-wheel drive Dodge Diplomat (as well as the Chrysler LeBaron and Fifth Avenue) continued to sell. Chrysler&#x27;s then executive vice president for manufacturing, Steve Sharf, met with officials at American Motors (AMC) to use the extra capacity at an assembly plant in Kenosha, Wisconsin to build the cars. Chrysler&#x27;s tooling was moved from St. Louis to Kenosha, and from 1987 until 1989 about 250,000 Chrysler and Dodge models were built by AMC at a lower cost than Chrysler could. This relationship evolved into Chrysler&#x27;s purchase of AMC in 1987.

In 1982, the coupe and station wagon were discontinued and Canada&#x27;s Plymouth version of the Diplomat came south of the border. The Plymouth Caravelle was offered in the United States as the Plymouth Gran Fury. 1983 was the last year for the Slant Six, and afterwards, the only available engine was the 318-cid V8 with a two-barrel carburetor. A four-barrel 318 remained the optional engine choice for the police package. For 1984, the appearance of the upscale Special Edition or SE used the Fifth Avenue&#x27;s front end with its parking lights located above the headlights, and a bright metal cross overlaid on the Chrysler grille&#x27;s thin vertical bars. The SE had more exterior trim and an interior that placed the SE between the Diplomat Salon and the Chrysler Fifth Avenue.

As the 1980s progressed, fewer private customers purchased the Diplomat, and the M-body was eventually dropped during the 1989 model year. Sales of cars equipped with the Police Package represented about half of the Diplomat production after the discontinuation of the coupe and station wagons. Late in the Diplomat&#x27;s run, the car was subject to the federal &quot;Gas Guzzler Tax&quot; and it also required premium unleaded gasoline. Although sales remained strong, Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca held a low opinion of the M-body line as a relic of the pre-K car era and declined to invest any money in them. Despite lower gas prices in the mid- to late-1980s and a 2.26:1 rear-end gear ratio, the Diplomat&#x27;s carbureted engine and lack of an overdrive gear on its TorqueFlite automatic transmission resulted in poor fuel economy compared with its larger competitors from Ford and General Motors, as evidenced by comparing the EPA estimates for 1986 models:

* Dodge Diplomat (5.2 L V8, 3-speed automatic): 16 city, 21 highway, 18 combined
* Chevrolet Caprice (5.0 L V8, 4-speed automatic with overdrive): 17 city, 25 highway, 20 combined
* Ford LTD Crown Victoria (5.0 L V8, 4-speed automatic with overdrive): 18 city, 26 highway, 21 combined

However, Diplomats built from mid-1988 until the end of production were among the first Chrysler-built products to have a driver&#x27;s side airbag as standard equipment, some two model years before the remainder of Chrysler&#x27;s lineup and they were also among the only cars at the time to offer a tilt steering column with an airbag. Diplomats with airbags differed from earlier models in that they were also equipped with a padded, color-keyed knee blocker which extended out from beneath the instrument panel in front of the driver.

Production Figures:

(For 1979 and 1981, coupe and sedan figures were not listed separately)
==Discontinuation==
When the Diplomat and similar Plymouth Gran Fury were discontinued, it marked the last rear-wheel drive sedan sold by the corporation until the Dodge Magnum and Chrysler 300 were introduced in 2005. The Diplomat&#x27;s other rear-wheel drive sibling, the Chrysler Fifth Avenue, also ended production, but the nameplate was continued on a front-wheel drive chassis. In the Dodge lineup, the Monaco became the top-of-the-line sedan until the introduction of the LH platform.

<text>.sk is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Slovakia. It is administered by SK-NIC a.s.

SK-NIC, a. s., is the administrator of the top-level domain .sk. It has been recognised since the mid-1990s by the manager of the DNS root zone, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, as the delegated manager of .SK (changing its name from EUNET Slovakia to EuroWeb Slovakia in 1999 and to SK-NIC in 2006).

In 2006, SK-NIC transferred some of the competences of domain administration to the State, and submitted to levels of service requirements and a policy-making committee comprising representatives of the internet community as well as the Government.

SK-NIC is the country-code Top Level Domain registry in Europe with most resellers, with over 5900 accredited registrars at its maximum in Slovakia. There are three other ccTLDs registries in the European region with over 1000 registrars, and as an example there are over 40 registrars in neighbouring Czech Republic or over 300 in Germany, largest registry domain-wide.

All staff and technology used by SK-NIC, a.s., is situated in Slovakia, where it advertises 100% of DNS availability rate.

CentralNic acquired SK-Nic from a private Netherlands-based company in December 2017.

Before the split in 1993, the former Czechoslovakia used the domain .cs.

<doc id="997438" wikidata="Q5346053" url="?curid=997438" title="Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche">
<text>Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche (6 June 1556 – 18 August 1625) was an English diplomat. He is remembered chiefly for his lone vote against the condemnation of Mary, Queen of Scots, and for organising the stag hunt where his guest, the Archbishop of Canterbury, accidentally killed a man.

==Early life==
Zouche was the son of George la Zouche, 10th Baron Zouche, of the noble Breton-origin Zouche dynasty, and his wife Margaret, &quot;née&quot; Welby. He was a royal ward from 1570, under the care of William Cecil. In a letter to Cecil written in 1596, Zouche confessed that he spent his patrimony as a youth, having indulged in &quot;little searching for knowledge&quot;.

==Marriage==
In or around 1578, Zouche married his cousin Eleanor Zouche, daughter of Sir John Zouche and Eleanor, &quot;née&quot; Whalley. They had two daughters, Elizabeth and Mary, but, shortly after Mary&#x27;s birth in 1582, Zouche left Eleanor and they lived apart until her death in 1611. Eleanor wrote to Lord Burghley, from her lodging in the Strand on 19 May 1593, following her father&#x27;s death, still hoping to be reconciled with Zouche. Sir John Holles wrote to Sir Edward Phillips describing her treatment; 

Within a year of Eleanor&#x27;s death, Zouche married again, to Sarah Harington (1565–1629), daughter of Sir James Harington. There were no children of this marriage. Sarah Harington had been twice widowed, having been previously married to Francis Hastings, Lord Hastings, who would have been Earl of Huntingdon but predeceased his father, and Sir George Kingsmill. With the death of Zouche, Sarah married Sir Thomas Edmondes. Her portrait was painted by Isaac Oliver and by Cornelius Johnson. The portraits by Johnson show her aged 63 wearing a large miniature case referring to Frederick V of the Palatinate with the Greek letter &quot;phi&quot;. A similar miniature case was described in an inventory of a Scottish soldier.

==Career==

Zouche matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge in Easter 1570, M.A. 1571; and was admitted to Gray&#x27;s Inn, 1575, though he was not admitted to the bar.

Zouche was appointed a Commissioner for the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, at Fotheringhay. He was the only Commissioner to offer any dissent against her judgement and subsequent sentence of death.

In later years he served as Ambassador to Scotland, Lord President of the Council of Wales and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. He was a Privy Counsellor from 1603.

Zouche was ambassador in Scotland from 5 January to 6 April 1594, at the time of the birth of Prince Henry. Sir Robert Cecil complained that he had not received updates from Zouche, and he was very displeased to hear that Zouche and the diplomat Robert Bowes had lent money to Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell on the security of a jewel and some silver plate. They had sent the jewel to London. Cecil wanted Zouche to make the loan seem a private transaction, a purchase of a jewel, and not to be known as an action of Queen Elizabeth to fund and support Bothwell, who was suspect in Scotland.

Zouche showed an interest in the New World, and was a Commissioner of the Virginia Company from 1608. He was also interested in horticulture; his house in Hackney included a physic garden and he employed Matthias L&#x27;Obel as his gardener.

The house in Hackney lay on the north side of Homerton High Street, probably on the site of the present Dean Close. The herbalist, John Gerard, visited Hackney and was given foreign seeds from Zouche&#x27;s garden. Zouche ceased to be a Hackney resident before his death in 1625 and it is likely his house was sold in 1620, to Sir Julius Caesar, Master of the Rolls.

In 1605, Zouche purchased the manor of Bramshill in Hampshire and almost immediately began to build the mansion that currently stands on the site. James I stayed at Bramshill in 1620 and the next year George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, went down to Bramshill to consecrate a chapel for Lord Zouche. The visit had disastrous consequences for the Archbishop when he accepted Zouche&#x27;s invitation to a stag-hunt, where Abbot unintentionally killed a gamekeeper who strayed into his line of fire. Although all the witnesses, including Zouche, agreed that the gamekeeper&#x27;s death was a tragic accident, Abbot&#x27;s reputation never recovered from the incident. He remains the only Archbishop of Canterbury ever to kill a man.

Bramshill was used as the UK Police Staff College from 1960 to 2015.

==Connection with More children on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;==

In 1620, Lord Zouche provided counsel and other help in an incident involving him and his longtime secretary Samuel More, who was in his employ at the time of Zouche&#x27;s death in 1625. More was the eldest son of a respected parliamentarian from Shropshire, Richard More. He had married in 1610/11 to a cousin Katherine More, and by 1616 was charging that she had committed adultery with a longtime lover, conceiving four children by him: Elinor, Jasper, Richard and Mary. Four rancorous years and twelve court appearances followed, culminating in 1620 with the four children being sent without their mother&#x27;s knowledge to the Plymouth Colony on the ship &quot;Mayflower&quot; as indentured servants, upon the counsel of Lord Zouche, who was a New England Council commissioner, acting on the request of Samuel More and his father Richard, who were searching for a location far away to which the children could be sent.

==Death==

Zouche died in 1625, after suffering illness for some time. His resting place is unknown. He was not buried in the parish church at Hackney, despite the verses penned by Ben Jonson.
&lt;poem&gt;
:Wherever I die, oh, here may I lie
:Along by my good Lord Zouche,
:That when I am dry, to the tap I may hie,
:And so back again to my couch.
&lt;/poem&gt;
On Zouche&#x27;s death, the Barony of Zouche fell into abeyance between his daughter Mary (who married in 1610 Thomas Leighton, son of Sir Thomas Leighton the Governor of Guernsey) and the heirs of his daughter Elizabeth (died 1617, wife of Sir William Tate). The abeyance was terminated in 1815 in favour of Cecil Bisshopp, 12th Baron Zouche, whose grandmother Catherine Tate was Elizabeth&#x27;s heir-at-law.

<text>Barclay James Littlewood (born 1978 in Huddersfield) is a British barrister and entrepreneur who founded Ukessays.com, a commercial writing service which sells essays and other academic work. The work is sold over the Internet to students in the UK, the US and Western Europe. Despite criticism about the fact that students represent the work as their own, the company maintains copyright in all their work and they claim that the essays they sell are to be used as a study guide.

== Career ==
After training as a barrister at Gray&#x27;s Inn, Littlewood set up his company in 2003, based in Arnold, Nottinghamshire.

The sale of academic work by Littlewood&#x27;s and other companies has proved controversial and there have been frequent accusations in the media, especially from universities, that Littlewood&#x27;s businesses encourage plagiarism. Littlewood claims that the essays are sold to aid students with their research.

<doc id="997443" wikidata="Q1132716" url="?curid=997443" title="Grey hat">
<text>A grey hat (greyhat or gray hat) is a computer hacker or computer security expert who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but usually does not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker.

The term came into use in the late 1990s, and was derived from the concepts of &quot;white hat&quot; and &quot;black hat&quot; hackers. When a white hat hacker discovers a vulnerability, they will exploit it only with permission and not divulge its existence until it has been fixed, whereas the black hat will illegally exploit it and/or tell others how to do so. The grey hat will neither illegally exploit it, nor tell others how to do so.

A further difference among these types of hacker lies in their methods of discovering vulnerabilities. The white hat breaks into systems and networks at the request of their employer or with explicit permission for the purpose of determining how secure it is against hackers, whereas the black hat will break into any system or network in order to uncover sensitive information for personal gain. The grey hat generally has the skills and intent of the white hat but may break into any system or network without permission.

According to one definition of a grey-hat hacker, when they discover a vulnerability, instead of telling the vendor how the exploit works, they may offer to repair it for a small fee. When one gains illegal access to a system or network, they may suggest to the system administrator that one of their friends be hired to fix the problem; however, this practice has been declining due to the increasing willingness of businesses to prosecute. Another definition of grey hat maintains that grey hat hackers only arguably violate the law in an effort to research and improve security: legality being set according to the particular ramifications of any hacks they participate in.

In the search engine optimization (SEO) community, grey hat hackers are those who manipulate websites&#x27; search engine rankings using improper or unethical means but that are not considered search engine spam.

A 2021 research study looked into the psychological characteristics of individuals that participate in hacking in the workforce. The findings indicate that grey hat hackers typically go against authority, black hat hackers have a strong tendency toward thrill-seeking, and white hat hackers often exhibit narcissistic traits.

==History==
The phrase &quot;grey hat&quot; was first publicly used in the computer security context when DEF CON announced the first scheduled Black Hat Briefings in 1996, although it may have been used by smaller groups prior to this time. Moreover, at this conference a presentation was given in which Mudge, a key member of the hacking group L0pht, discussed their intent as grey hat hackers to provide Microsoft with vulnerability discoveries in order to protect the vast number of users of its operating system. Finally, Mike Nash, Director of Microsoft&#x27;s server group, stated that grey hat hackers are much like technical people in the independent software industry in that &quot;they are valuable in giving us feedback to make our products better&quot;.

The phrase &quot;grey hat&quot; was used by the hacker group L0pht in a 1999 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; to describe their hacking activities.

The phrase was used to describe hackers who support the ethical reporting of vulnerabilities directly to the software vendor in contrast to the full disclosure practices that were prevalent in the white hat community that vulnerabilities not be disclosed outside of their group.

In 2002, however, the Anti-Sec community published use of the term to refer to people who work in the security industry by day, but engage in black hat activities by night. The irony was that for black hats, this interpretation was seen as a derogatory term; whereas amongst white hats it was a term that lent a sense of popular notoriety.

Following the rise and eventual decline of the full disclosure vs. anti-sec &quot;golden era&quot;—and the subsequent growth of an &quot;ethical hacking&quot; philosophy—the term &quot;grey hat&quot; began to take on all sorts of diverse meanings. The prosecution in the U.S. of Dmitry Sklyarov for activities which were legal in his home country changed the attitudes of many security researchers. As the Internet became used for more critical functions, and concerns about terrorism grew, the term &quot;white hat&quot; started referring to corporate security experts who did not support full disclosure.

In 2008, the EFF defined grey hats as ethical security researchers who inadvertently or arguably violate the law in an effort to research and improve security. They advocate for computer offense laws that are clearer and more narrowly drawn.

==Examples==
In April 2000, hackers known as &quot;{}&quot; and &quot;Hardbeat&quot; gained unauthorized access to Apache.org. They chose to alert Apache crew of the problems rather than try to damage the Apache.org servers.

In June 2010, a group of computer experts known as Goatse Security exposed a flaw in AT&amp;T security which allowed the e-mail addresses of iPad users to be revealed. The group revealed the security flaw to the media soon after notifying AT&amp;T. Since then, the FBI opened an investigation into the incident and raided the house of weev, the new group&#x27;s most prominent member.

In April 2011, a group of experts discovered that the Apple iPhone and 3G iPads were &quot;logging where the user visits&quot;. Apple released a statement saying that the iPad and iPhone were only logging the towers that the phone could access. There have been numerous articles on the matter and it has been viewed as a minor security issue. This instance would be classified as &quot;grey hat&quot; because although the experts could have used this for malicious intent, the issue was nonetheless reported.

In August 2013, Khalil Shreateh, an unemployed computer security researcher, hacked the Facebook page of Mark Zuckerberg in order to force action to correct a bug he discovered which allowed him to post to any user&#x27;s page without their consent. He had tried repeatedly to inform Facebook of this bug only to be told by Facebook that the issue was not a bug. After this incident, Facebook corrected this vulnerability which could have been a powerful weapon in the hands of professional spammers. Shreateh was not compensated by Facebook&#x27;s White Hat program as he violated their policies, thus making this a grey hat incident.

<text>The Dodge Monaco is an automobile that was marketed by the Dodge division of Chrysler Corporation. Introduced as the flagship of the Dodge product line, the Monaco was introduced for the 1965 model year to replace the Custom 880, then later joined as a sub-model of the Dodge Polara. During its production, the Monaco was offered in several body configurations, including two-door and four-door hardtop sedans, four-door sedans, two-door convertibles, and station wagons.

From 1965 to 1977, three generations of the Monaco were produced with the full-size Chrysler C platform. For 1977 and 1978, Dodge shifted the Monaco to the intermediate Chrysler B platform, effectively downsizing the model line. For 1979, the model line was redesigned and renamed the Dodge St. Regis.

After a 12-year hiatus, the full-size Monaco was revived for the 1990 model year as the flagship Dodge sedan, replacing the Diplomat. This was a rebadged version of the Eagle Premier which was developed by Renault and American Motors Corporation (AMC). The Monaco was replaced by the Dodge Intrepid for the 1993 model year.

It is named after the Principality of Monaco.

== First generation (1965–1968)==
===1965===
Upon its introduction on September 25, 1964, for the 1965 model year, the Dodge Monaco was intended to compete with the Pontiac Grand Prix in what came to be known as the personal luxury market, but ended up filling in for Dodge in the full-size, luxury line instead.

The 1965 Monaco was based on the Custom 880 two-door hardtop body. The Monaco received special badging, different taillight and grille treatment, and a sportier interior with a full-length center console, as well as a V8 engine as standard equipment. Larger, more powerful engines were also available as options. The Monaco competed with the Ford LTD, a top-of-the-line model in the Galaxie 500 series, the Caprice package for the Impala Sport sedan, as well as the 1966 Plymouth VIP model for its Fury series and the Ambassador DPL offered by American Motors. These models provided competition for mid-priced sedans like Chrysler, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Mercury.

In Canada, a version of the Plymouth Sport Fury was marketed as the Dodge Monaco. It was available in hardtop coupe or convertible body styles. The Canadian Monacos were equipped with Plymouth dashboards in 1965 and 1966. Unlike the U.S. Monaco versions, the Canadian Monacos were available with V8s or the slant six.

===1966===
For the 1966 model year, in the U.S., the Monaco replaced the Custom 880 series, and the former Monaco became the Monaco 500. The basic Monaco was available in hardtop coupe, four-door (pillarless) hardtop sedan, conventional four-door (pillared) sedan, and four-door station wagon body styles. In the U.S., the Monaco 500 was available only as a two-door hardtop. Although there was no convertible in the 1966 U.S. Monaco range, there was in the 1966 Canadian Monaco lineup. The Canadian Dodge used the &quot;Monaco&quot; name for the Sport Fury equivalent and the Polara 880 for the Fury III competitor.

===1967===
The 1967 model year full-sized Dodges, the Monaco included, received significant facelifts with all-new exterior sheet metal. Chief designer Elwood Engel&#x27;s work featured generally flat body planes with sharp-edged accent lines. The hardtop coupes featured new semi-fastback rooflines with reverse-slanted trailing edges on the rear quarter windows.

In Canada, the &quot;Monaco&quot; name was applied for 1967 to all of the premium full-sized Dodge cars, replacing the Polara 880 at the top of the Dodge line. Taking the Monaco&#x27;s place as a premium full-size model was the Monaco 500, which was available only as a two-door hardtop and convertible.

===1968===
Marker lights in the fenders and full-width tail lights were added. The Monaco 500 was dropped at the end of the 1968 model year in the United States and at the end of the 1970 model year in Canada.


==Second generation (1969–1973)==
===1969===

For the 1969 model year, the wheelbase of the Monaco was increased from 121 inches to 122 inches, and the length was increased to about 220 inches. Returning for 1969 was the &quot;500&quot; option, which in the U.S. market gave the Monaco front bucket seats and a center armrest. In Canada, the Monaco 500 was a separate series that used the side trim of the Polara 500 sold in the U.S. Canadians could also buy a Monaco convertible; U.S. Dodge full-size convertible shoppers had only the lower-end Polara and Polara 500 to choose from.

All full-sized Dodge cars, including the Monaco, adopted Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s new &quot;fuselage&quot; styling, in which the upper and lower body are melded into a uniformly curved unit. Curved side glass adds to the effect, as does deleting the &quot;shoulder&quot; along the rear. The look starts in the front of the car, with a nearly straight-across bumper—demanded by a Chrysler executive after a Congressional committee attacked him over the seeming inability of car bumpers to protect vehicles from extensive damage in low-speed collisions—and a five-segment egg-crate grille that surrounds the headlamps. When the cars failed to spark buyers&#x27; interest, Dodge executives demanded a change. By the summer of 1969, the division released new chrome trim for the front fender caps and leading edge of the hood as an option, which gives the appearance of a then-fashionable loop bumper without the tooling expense. At the rear, Dodge&#x27;s signature delta-shaped taillamps were presented in a new form that required the top of the bumper to slope downward toward each end.

The standard-equipment engine on the 1969 Monaco is Chrysler&#x27;s B-block V8 engine with a two-barrel 2245 Holley carburetor. Buyers could order the 383 with a four-barrel carburetor that increased power to , or they could opt for the Magnum RB-block engine. Station wagons with the 440 were rated at .

The 1969 Monaco offered, as a $50 option, the first modern polyellipsoidal (projector) automotive road lamp. Called &quot;Super-Lite&quot; and mounted in the driver&#x27;s side of the grille, this auxiliary headlamp was produced in a joint venture between Chrysler Corporation and Sylvania. It uses an 85-watt halogen bulb and was intended as a mid-beam, to extend the reach of the low beams during turnpike travel when low beams alone were inadequate, but high beams would produce excessive glare to oncoming drivers.

Available models for 1969 included a two-door hardtop coupe, four-door hardtop sedan, four-door pillared sedan, and four-door station wagons with six- or nine-passenger capacity. A new Brougham option package included a vinyl roof on sedans and hardtops and a split-bench front seat with a reclining mechanism on the passenger side (except on the two-door hardtops). Monaco wagons received wood-grained vinyl trim along their sides and across the dual-action (side- and bottom-hinged) tailgate.

Sales of the Polara and Monaco were down by nearly 20,000 cars compared with 1968, with the Monaco line accounting for 38,566 of the 127,252 full-size cars made by Dodge for the year.

===1970===

The 1970 models featured new front and rear styling, including complex loop-type bumpers front and rear. In the front, the new bumper enclosed a new diecast grille and the headlamps. At the rear, the double-loop bumper enclosed the taillamps. Reversing lamps were moved up into the endcaps that terminated the quarter panels, in slotted body-color housings. The designers chose to emphasize the length of the hood this year, which meant that the redesigned front end grew by three inches. However, the new rear end was four inches (102 mm) shorter. 

Improvements to the suspension were promoted as the new &quot;Torsion-Quiet&quot; system, which used strategically placed rubber isolators to reduce road noise and vibrations. The rear wheel track was broadened by nearly three inches as Dodge installed the rear axle that had been used only on Wagons on all 1970 Monaco models.

The Brougham and 500 option packages continued, as did the availability of the Super-Lite, but the 440 Magnum V8 was dropped. The version 440, available only in wagons for 1969, became the new top engine for all Monacos. Despite all of the changes, which cost Chrysler a rather large sum of money, Monaco (and Polara) sales declined, with 24,692 Monacos built for the model year.

===1971===
The 1971 model year Monaco received a facelift featuring a new grille within the bumper that had been used the previous year, and other minor styling changes focused mainly on the rear. The Super-Lite was no longer available because of a lack of consumer interest and challenges to its legality in some states. A new single-loop rear bumper and larger taillamps were installed.

The 500 option package was discontinued. A stereo cassette player-recorder with a microphone was new on the option list. Bucket seats remained available despite the loss of the 500 package, and the Brougham package was also available for $220, despite the addition of a separate Polara Brougham series.

All engines had their compression ratio reduced so they could all run satisfactorily on regular-grade gasoline. The two-barrel 383 versions still has the same power rating , the four-barrel 383 dropped to , and the 440 dropped to .

Monaco station wagons, which in 1969 and 1970 featured woodgrain trim on the lower bodysides, now had woodgrain high on the sides, including around the side windows. The new vinyl decals were translucent, allowing some paint color to shine through.

Despite the power losses and mild styling change, sales slightly rose. About 900 more Monacos were built for 1971 (approximately 25,544 — an exact number is unknown).

===1972===

For the 1972 model year, the full-sized Dodges featured all-new sheet metal that had been initially planned for 1971.

Setting off the new look for the Monaco was a new front end with hidden headlamps set above a completely new bumper and grille assembly. The car&#x27;s sides lost their previous plump appearance in favor of a new, lean look with a new feature line that started on the front fenders and ran back through the doors, kicking up ahead of the rear wheels. Sedan and hardtop rooflines were new and more formal-looking. At the rear, there was another new loop bumper and full-width taillamp. Station wagons received a new rear appearance with &quot;stacked&quot; vertical taillamps.

The standard V8 for 1972 Monacos was the LA-block engine, which had been introduced in 1971 as an option on Polaras. It was rated at , as measured net instead of gross. A new engine optional, B-block V8. The 440 remained available, but it now produced (net). Sales for 1972 nearly matched 1969 levels, with 37,013 built for the model year.

===1973===

For its last year in the fuselage body, the Monaco continued with its 1972 styling, except for another new rear bumper with redesigned taillamps, along with a new decklid and rear-quarter endcaps. Large black rubber guards were added to the bumpers to comply with new Federal five-mile-per-hour impact standards. Hardtop and sedan models gained about due mostly to the bumper guards.

Inside, new fire-retardant materials in virtually every visible part of the interior meant added safety. Under the hood, all three available engines gained reliability with the addition of Chrysler&#x27;s new electronic ignition system as standard equipment, which extended spark plug life and virtually eliminated periodic ignition system maintenance.

Despite the improvements, sales dropped again to 29,396.

The 1973 model year was to be the Monaco&#x27;s final year as Dodge&#x27;s top-of-the-line full-size car. After 14 years, the Polara name was discontinued, and, in 1974, all big Dodges carried the Monaco name.

===South Africa===
In July 1969, Chrysler South Africa introduced a rebadged locally built version of the Dodge Monaco as the &quot;Chrysler 383&quot;. This badge remained in use for about four years, being dropped in early 1973. This was the first time they had used the &quot;Chrysler&quot; badge on a locally built product in ten years. It was also one of the biggest cars built there, and had the biggest engine as well. The V8 was rated at , and the fully equipped car featured power windows and a standard vinyl roof.

==Third generation (1974–1977)==
===1974===
The full-size C-body 1974 Dodge Monaco was completely redesigned for the 1974 model year with an all-new unibody platform and sheet metal. However, the 1973 oil crisis began within days of their introduction. Chrysler was excoriated in the media for bringing out huge new cars, and sales suffered accordingly. Many in the automotive press also criticized the car&#x27;s new design as being too derivative of what they thought resembled a 3-year-old Buick or Oldsmobile full-size car. The Dodge Polara and Polara Custom models were discontinued after the 1973 model year. The Monaco and Monaco Custom replaced them respectively. The previous Monaco was renamed Monaco Brougham. The Brougham name was used on a luxury option package from 1969 to 1973. Fixed headlamps on all Monacos replaced the hidden headlamps of the previous models. The standard engine on all Monacos was a with a 2-barrel carburetor—engine options included a with a 4-barrel carburetor, a with a 2- or 4-barrel carburetor, and a with a 4-barrel carburetor.

===1975===
For the 1975 model year, changes to the base Monaco were minimal. However, the Monaco Custom was renamed the Royal Monaco, and the Monaco Brougham became the Royal Monaco Brougham. These newly named models featured hidden headlamps. 1975 was the last model year in which the four-door hardtop was available. Some models, depending on equipment and the state they were sold in, received catalytic converters to comply with increasingly strict vehicle emissions control regulations. After the start of the 1975 model year, a limited-production option for Royal Monaco Brougham coupes was introduced: the Diplomat package featured a landau vinyl roof with opera windows and a wide steel roof band. It was available in only three colors—Cold Metallic, Silver Cloud Metallic, and Maroon Metallic. The standard Monaco and Royal Monaco engine was a with a 2-barrel carburetor. At the same time, Royal Monaco Broughams and wagons received a with a 4-barrel carburetor. Engine options for the Monaco and the Royal Monaco were a with a 2- or 4-barrel carburetor, and all Monacos could be upgraded to a with a 4-barrel carburetor. The car weighed over two tons with a top speed of 127 mph.

===1976===
At the start of the 1976 model year, exterior changes on the full-size C-body 1976 Dodge Monaco were minimal. However, all models (including police packages) now had the former high-series front panel with hidden headlights. Chrysler&#x27;s new Lean Burn system was introduced to reduce exhaust emissions (only on the 400 cubic inch engine). The four-door hardtop, which had been part of the Dodge Monaco lineup during the previous ten model years (from 1966 to 1968, from 1969 to 1973 and from 1974 to 1975) ever since the Dodge Monaco made its debut from eleven model years earlier (1965), had been discontinued during the end of the previous model year (1975), which reduced the choice of body styles to just three offerings, the four-door wagon, four-door sedan, and two-door hardtop for the 1976 model year. A with a two-barrel carburetor and 150 bhp became standard on the base Monaco. At the same time, the Royal Monaco Broughams and wagons were downgraded to with 2-barrel carburetors, but the Royal Monaco continued with 1975&#x27;s with a two-barrel carburetor. The with a four-barrel carburetor could still be ordered.

===1977 (Royal Monaco)===
For the 1977 model year, the Monaco was effectively split into two model lines, with the Royal Monaco retaining the full-size C-platform alongside the Chrysler New Yorker, with the standard Monaco replacing the Coronet B-platform intermediate. Offered in standard and Brougham trims, the Royal Monaco was produced as a two-door hardtop sedan, four-door sedan, and five-door station wagon.

The 318 cubic-inch V8 became the standard engine for the first time. Outside of California, the 360 V8 (with a two-barrel carburetor) and the 400 V8 remained available; the 440 V8 was offered as an option. A 3-speed automatic was the only transmission available.

The Royal Monaco was discontinued for the 1978 model year, as Chrysler offered the C-platform only through its namesake division.


==Fourth generation (1977–1978)==
=== 1977 ===
The 1977 model year brought changes to the Dodge Monaco lineup as a lingering result of the 1973–1974 energy crisis, especially as Chrysler decided to move the Dodge Monaco, in name form only, from the full-size C platform-body to the mid-size B platform-body line up for the 1977 model year. The entire 1977 Dodge Monaco lineup received a make-over. The previous model year&#x27;s full-size C-body Dodge Monaco (from 1976) became, just for one year only, the full-size C-body 1977 Dodge Royal Monaco until its discontinuation from all production at the end of the 1977 model year. The mid-size B-body 1977 Dodge Monaco two-door coupe, four-door wagon, and four-door sedan replaced the previous model year&#x27;s Coronet hardtop coupe, four-door wagon, and four-door sedan. These cars were &quot;corporate twins&quot; to the new-for-1975 &quot;downsized&quot; Plymouth Fury. The 1977 Dodge Monaco Brougham four-door sedan replaced the previous year&#x27;s Coronet Brougham four-door sedan. The 1977 Dodge Monaco Crestwood four-door wagon replaced the last year&#x27;s Coronet Crestwood four-door wagon. Aside from the name change, the 1977 Dodge Monacos differed only slightly from the 1976 Coronet equivalents, receiving a revised front-end design with stacked rectangular headlamps.

=== 1978 ===
The 1978 mid-size, B-body Dodge Monaco was unchanged from the previous model year. It became Dodge&#x27;s largest car during the 1978 model year. The Dodge Monaco was discontinued at the end of the 1978 model year. The B-body cars continued in the form of the Dodge Magnum until 1979.

=== Replacement ===
The Dodge Monaco was replaced by the Dodge St. Regis for the 1979 model year, using the Chrysler R platform (a smaller revision of the B platform). Struggling to compete against the all-new designs of General Motors and Ford, sales of the St. Regis were heavily supported by fleets, primarily as law enforcement vehicles. After 1981, the St. Regis was discontinued (in favor of the Diplomat), becoming the longest-wheelbase sedan, Chrysler had produced until the 2005 Dodge Magnum debuted.

Production Figures:


==Fifth generation (1990–1992)==

For the 1990 model year, Dodge revived the Monaco nameplate after a 12-year hiatus. Replacing the long-running Diplomat sedan, the model line was the first full-size Dodge sedan since the 1981 Dodge St. Regis. Slotted above the slightly smaller Dodge Dynasty in size, the fifth-generation Monaco was the Dodge counterpart of the Eagle Premier, available in standard LE and deluxe ES trims.

The Dodge Monaco and Eagle Premier were assembled by the Bramalea Assembly in Brampton, Ontario (opened by AMC in 1986). Although produced in Canada, Chrysler Canada did not sell the model line; following the discontinuation of the Diplomat, the largest Dodge sedan sold in Canada was the mid-size Spirit (the Dynasty was badged as a Chrysler).

For the 1993 model year, Dodge consolidated its two large sedan lines, as the Dodge Intrepid replaced both the Monaco and the Dynasty; the Eagle Vision replaced the Premier. 

=== Background and development ===
In August 1987, Chrysler completed its acquisition of American Motors Corporation (AMC). Along with its ownership of the Jeep model line, the AMC Eagle sedan/station wagons, and the Renault lineup of the Alliance and Encore (and the newly introduced Medallion), AMC was sought after for ability to develop and engineer cars quicker (and at lower cost) than other American auto manufacturers. Beginning in 1985, AMC had begun to build the Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon and the Dodge Diplomat/Plymouth Gran Fury/Chrysler Fifth Avenue for Chrysler under contract.

At the time of the sale, AMC was nearing the release of the Premier, a collaboration between AMC and Renault to develop a full-size car for the North American market. The largest AMC-branded vehicle since the 1978 Matador, the Premier was to become a full model line, including a four-door sedan, station wagon, and two-door coupe (named the Allure). Derived from the chassis of the Renault 25 (the flagship Renault model line in Europe), the Premier adopted the suspension of the Renault (later Eagle) Medallion (a Renault 21 developed for North America, replacing the Renault 18i and AMC Concord). To further distinguish the AMC Premier from the Renault 25, the model line received an exterior update by Giorgetto Giugiaro; the interior was restyled by AMC designer Dick Teague (one of his final designs). The standard engine was an AMC-sourced 2.5 L inline-4 (shared with Jeep) and an optional 3.0 L PRV V6. 

The Premier began production in September 1987 for the 1988 model year. While prototypes wore Renault badging, all production vehicles wore the badging of the newly created Eagle brand (though designated with AMC VINs). The flagship of the Eagle brand, the Premier, was slotted above the Medallion (a nearly direct rebrand of the Renault 21) and the Eagle Wagon (the former AMC Eagle, ending production in December 1987).

Along with its purchase of AMC, Chrysler contractually agreed to use 260,000 PRV V6 engines. For 1988 and 1989, Eagle sold less than 90,000 Premiers, forcing Chrysler to shutter the Bramalea plant on several occasions. To expand production of the facility and also to fulfill its obligation to Renault sooner, Chrysler opted to offer a Dodge-branded version of the model line alongside the Premier for the 1990 model year.

=== Model overview ===
==== Chassis ====
The Dodge Monaco and Eagle Premier use the front-wheel drive Chrysler B platform. Developed in collaboration with AMC and Renault, the architecture was the final AMC vehicle platform and the automaker&#x27;s only front-wheel drive chassis. Originally codenamed X-58, the chassis was renamed following its acquisition by Chrysler. Sharing only its letter designation with the 1962-1979 Chrysler intermediate architecture, the 1988-1992 B platform is derived from the Renault 25, sharing the rear torsion-bar suspension design of the Renault 21.

The Dodge Monaco was fitted with four-wheel disc brakes (introduced to the Premier for 1990), with anti-lock brakes (ABS) becoming added in 1991. The first-generation Dodge Viper shares its rear disc brakes with the Dodge Monaco/Eagle Premier (&quot;without&quot; ABS).

Engineered by former Renault product engineer François Castaing, the B platform adopted a longitudinal engine configuration, allowing for better engine access and more stable handling. To increase compatibility with other Chrysler vehicles (and to increase reliability), the B platform shifted from Renault to Chrysler electrical components for the 1990 model year.

===== Powertrain =====
The Dodge Monaco was powered by the Renault-produced 3.0 L &quot;Douvrin&quot; PRV V6, paired with a ZF-produced 4-speed automatic transmission

==== Body ====
For 1990, the Eagle Premier underwent a minor revision (leading to the deletion of the &quot;Design Giugiaro&quot; badges). The Dodge Monaco shared its entire body with the Premier, differing in turn signal lenses (amber instead of clear), trunk lid design (gray trim between the taillamps), and the adoption of the Dodge &quot;crosshair&quot; grille. 

In contrast to the Dodge Dynasty (six-passenger with a 50/50 split front bench seat and column-mount shifter), the Monaco was a five-passenger vehicle with front bucket seats and a console-mounted shifter.

For 1991, the Monaco replaced chrome trim on all models with black or body-color trim. To streamline production, air conditioning, and automatic climate control became standard.

<doc id="997456" wikidata="Q478810" url="?curid=997456" title="Chrysler Neon">
<text>The Neon is a compact car built from November 1993 until 2005 by the American Chrysler Corporation over two generations. It has a front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout and was available in two-door and four-door sedan body styles. In the United States and Canada, it was sold as either a Dodge or a Plymouth, while in Europe, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Egypt, Australia, South Africa, and South America, it was branded as a Chrysler. 

The Neon was offered in multiple versions and configurations over its production life, which lasted from the 1995 model year until 2005. The Neon nameplate was subsequently resurrected in 2016 for the Dodge Neon, a rebadged variant of the Fiat Tipo sedan for the Mexican market.

==1991 concept car==
The Neon nameplate first appeared as a environmentally-friendly concept car in 1991 at the Frankfurt Motor Show under the Dodge brand. It was radically styled and not production-ready, but some design elements resembled the future production vehicle. The concept car incorporated unique features that included four power sliding doors opening from the center with no B-pillar, a power-operated full-length fabric sunroof with a drop-down rear window, a trash compactor to help eliminate litter, and the car was powered by a two-stroke, three-cylinder, 1.1 L engine rated at supplied by Mercury Marine. 

The Neon concept was designed by Chrysler designers who had joined the company from Chrysler&#x27;s buyout of American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987. The goals for the former AMC designers were for a car that was &quot;lightweight, fuel sipping, powerful, comfortable in an American manner, yet to cost no more than a bit under $4,000 to build, with a retail sales price of no more than $8,000&quot;. They also incorporated recycled materials or components throughout the car that could be recycled including identifying interior plastics so that they could be easily processed into reusable elements. The Dodge Neon concept car earned a gold IDEA91 award by the Industrial Designers Society of America.

==First generation (1994)==

The first generation Neon was introduced at the 1993 Frankfurt Motor Show and went on sale in January 1994 for the 1995 model year. It was available as a four-door notchback sedan and a two-door notchback coupe. Available engines were SOHC and DOHC versions of Chrysler&#x27;s 2.0 L 4-cylinder engine producing at 6,000 rpm and at 5,000 rpm or at 6,500 rpm and at 5,600 rpm, respectively; transmission options were a 3-speed Torqueflite automatic or a five-speed manual.

The car was badged and sold as both a Dodge and a Plymouth in the United States and Canada; in Mexico and Gulf Cooperation Council it was sold as a Dodge and a Chrysler, and in Europe, Australia, and other export markets it was sold as the Chrysler Neon. At the Neon&#x27;s release, then president of Chrysler Corporation Bob Lutz said, &quot;There&#x27;s an old saying in Detroit: &#x27;Good, fast, or cheap. Pick any two.&#x27; We refuse to accept that.&quot; The Japanese press touted the Neon as the &quot;Japanese car killer&quot;, due to a spiraling Yen due to the Japanese &quot;bubble economy&quot; crash and the lower production cost of the Neon. The Neon also became the first Chrysler small car sold in Japan but despite focused attention, only 994 were sold in Japan between June and December 1996. The Neon was classed in the larger &quot;Normal sized Passenger vehicles&quot; tax bracket according to the Japanese Government dimension regulations which obligated Japanese owners for additional yearly road taxes which affected sales. The Neon received praise for its appearance, price, and power when compared to competing cars such as the Honda Civic DX at , the Civic EX at , the Nissan Sentra at , the Ford Escort ZX2 at , the Toyota Corolla at , the Saturn S-Series at for SOHC variants and for DOHC variants, and the Chevrolet Cavalier Base and LS models at , among others. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; tested the DOHC 5-speed equipped Neon R/T and reported that it could run 0–60 in 7.6 seconds and 16.0 seconds in the quarter mile. First-generation Neons were competitive in SCCA Solo autocross and showroom-stock road racing.

===Equipment===
Neons had unconventional option availability, including the lack of power windows in the rear doors. Certain color base-model Neons, including red and black, had bumper covers molded in color rather than painted. These covers, while textured and not as glossy as paint, absorbed scuffs and scrapes with less visible damage. The mid-level Highline models for 1995 and 1996 used wheel covers with a bubble design. Initially, Neons were available in many bold colors including Nitro yellow-green, Lapis Blue, Aqua, and Magenta. Paint color choices became more subdued by the 1998-1999 model years, as the majority of buyers opted for more conventional tones.

In the Australian market, Chrysler Neons came in two models, the SE and the better-equipped LX. Later, the LX model was replaced by the LE with the updated model in 1999.

In Japan, only the sedan was offered. It was very similar to those sold in the Australian market. it was equipped with amber turn signal indicators next to the tail lights to comply with Japanese regulations and a side indicator installed in the fender behind the front wheel opening.

In the United States, the lineup started out as Base, Highline, and Sport, with different styles and options in each line, but the lineup titles changed frequently (other trim lines included Expresso, SE, ES, SXT, ACR, and R/T).

In Europe, the car was available with a 1.8 L engine. Europe received one limited edition model, the CS that came only in Platinum paint. It was fitted with the SOHC engine, North American R/T specification suspension (slightly lower, rear, front), rear spoiler, unique alloy wheels, standard leather interior, dual stainless steel exhaust, a six-CD changer, and a shorter 5-speed manual gearbox.

===Special models===

====ACR====
The ACR Neon, available with the DOHC engine, featured four-wheel disc brakes, Arvin non-adjustable struts for 1995–1996 models and Koni adjustable dampers for 1997–1999 models, thicker anti-sway bars, stiffer suspension bushings, fast-ratio steering, heavy-duty wheel hubs, and a five-speed manual transmission with a shorter .81 fifth gear and final drive ratio of 3.94 for quicker acceleration. 1995 through 1997 models featured adjustable camber. The computer-controlled speed limiter was removed from 1995 ACR models (limited to on later models), and ABS was also, to save weight. The ACR offers no badging to distinguish it from other Neon models; the only visible differences are a bumper with fog light holes, but no fog lights and a lack of side moldings. For the 1995 model year, the ACR was only offered to SCCA members, but in subsequent years it was available to the general public. The name &quot;ACR&quot; was initially the internal ordering code for the &quot;Competition Package&quot;, as it was termed in dealer materials; however, as knowledge of the model spread, the ACR name stuck. The backronym &quot;American Club Racer&quot; was coined due to its popularity with club and grassroots racers. To save weight, both the standard A/M-F/M radio with cassette player and air conditioning could be deleted, both for credit.

====R/T====

The R/T model (Road/Track) debuted in the 1998 model year. Offered only with a 5-speed DOHC configuration, the R/T featured many of the ACR&#x27;s mechanical upgrades including the numerically higher ratio 3.94 5-speed manual transmission, with the .81 5th gear and 130 mph speed limit. The R/T, however, was intended for the street, with more comfort and convenience features standard or available, and specialized parts like the adjustable dampers removed, although the dampers, as well as the front coil springs found on R/T models, were slightly stiffer, offering an advantage over standard model Neons. R/Ts featured optional stripes over the top of the car, silver &quot;R/T&quot; badging on the front door panels and the right side of the trunk deck lid, and a functional wing. The &quot;Stripe Delete&quot; option was available from the factory, but with no reduction to the Neon&#x27;s price. All striped R/Ts (black, red, blue) had silver-colored stripes, with the exception of the White R/Ts, which came with dark blue colored stripes. The R/T was available in the 4-door body style with limited numbers made.

== Second generation (2000) ==
Sales of the second generation model started with the 2000 model year and production ended with the 2005 model year. The second-generation Neon was only available as a four-door sedan. In some global sales regions, including the U.S., the sole engine was the 2.0 L SOHC engine, the power output remaining at . An optional Magnum engine configuration (with an active intake manifold, and other engine revisions to increase power) that produced was available. Both engines had a redline of 6762 rpm.

The second generation was more refined than the first-generation car. It was advertised that the second-generation Neon had over 1,000 refinements from the original generation. The first generation&#x27;s frameless windows were replaced with a full-framed door. Other NVH refinements were implemented. The new interior and greater size increased weight. The DOHC engine (Chrysler code name ECC) was no longer available.

In 2000, the R/T trim returned after a one-year hiatus. The R/T consisted of a new SOHC Magnum 2.0 L Engine, wheels, spoiler, dual chrome exhaust tips, quicker steering box, and stiffer springs. The 2001 and 2002 R/Ts had a flat, &#x27;hammerhead&#x27; spoiler. From 2000 to 2003, the R/T was sold as a Chrysler in the United Kingdom. The Neon was offered with a sport package for the 2001 model year only commemorating Dodge&#x27;s return to the NASCAR scene, called the Motorsports Edition. It was available on SE, ES, and R/T and on SE/ES models, consisted of an R/T wing, R/T wheels, R/T springs, Goodyear NASCAR raised yellow-lettering tires, &#x27;Dodge Motorsports&#x27; side decals, white instrument cluster, and R/T steering box. SE and ES cars were an R/T visually except for the lack of dual exhaust, R/T lower moldings, fog lamps, and R/T exclusive front bumper. The SE and ES only came equipped with the base model&#x27;s engine and was available with an automatic transmission (unlike the manual-only R/T model), the R/T retained the 150 hp Magnum engine. In 2001, there was also a Sport Appearance Package available on SE and ES, which added the R/T wing and 16” wheels as well as other option availability. 2001 was the last year for the Plymouth Neon, and the Plymouth brand as well. The last Plymouth Neon, which was also the last Plymouth ever produced (a silver four-door sedan), rolled off the assembly line on June 28, 2001.

The former Dodge and Plymouth Neon were briefly sold under the Chrysler name in Canada from 1999 until 2002, until being renamed as Dodge SX 2.0 for 2003. As before, in Europe, Australia, Mexico, Asia, South Africa and South America, it continued to be sold as a Chrysler, as Dodge and Plymouth passenger cars were not marketed outside the U.S. and Canada at the time. Besides the 2.0 L engine, it used the same Tritec 1.6 L unit found in the MINI prior to 2007. The 1.6 L unit is a variation of the 2.0 L SOHC engine designed by Chrysler and built by Tritec.

Originally, the second-generation Neon featured a five-speed manual transmission using the former ACR gear ratios to improve acceleration. However, this hurt gas mileage and made the car noisier on the highway, and eventually, the original gear ratios were restored. A four-speed automatic (41TE) was offered in the Neon for the 2002 model year, and the 03-05 received an updated 40TE four-speed auto, replacing the earlier 3-speed 31TH.

The Chrysler Neon was renamed Dodge SX 2.0 in Canada for 2003 and sold at Dodge dealerships. In Australia and Canada, the Chrysler Neon was discontinued in 2002.
In 2002, the front clip was changed to match the R/T and ACR front clip with the exception of missing a lower lip.

The Neon was facelifted once again for 2003 with large &quot;crosseyed&quot; headlights and a crosshair grille to make it look more like a Dodge Caravan and Dodge Stratus.

The ACR model was discontinued for 2003; the R/T model for 2004. The Chrysler Neon continued to be sold in Europe until 2004.

In Brazil, the Neon was marketed as a luxury mid-size sedan; for Mexico, it was a competitor to the Ford Escort, and sold as a Chrysler with either the 1.6 or 2.0 L engine and European-style taillights (with separate amber indicator lights), except for the R/T model, which was a Dodge, with U.S.-style taillights.

For the Dutch market, the Neon proved more successful than for the rest of the Continent. Trim levels were 2.0 LX and 2.0 SE. However, some grey import versions came in from Mexico.

This generation continued to be offered in Japan from 1999 to 2001. The Japanese version was installed with a leather interior and was marketed as a small luxury car to Japanese consumers. In 2002, the Neon was replaced by the Chrysler PT Cruiser in Japan.

=== SX 2.0: 2003-2005 (Canada) ===
The Chrysler Neon was renamed to the Dodge SX 2.0 for the Canadian market for the 2003 model year and coinciding with the 2003 facelift of the Neon. Aside from badging and minor trim differences, as well as metric instruments, it was identical to the US-market Neon.

===Final year===
DaimlerChrysler discontinued the Neon, with the final cars assembled on September 23, 2005 at the Belvidere Assembly plant in Belvidere, Illinois. The Neon was replaced in the spring of 2006 with the 2007 Dodge Caliber, which is based on the shared Chrysler/Mitsubishi Motors GS platform. Like the Neon, the Caliber had an SRT-4 variant, but like the standard Caliber, it used a completely different engine. The Belvidere plant underwent retooling for the Caliber, Jeep Compass, and Patriot.

In markets like Australia, the Neon range was reduced to either 2.0 LX or 2.0 SE models.

===Safety===
The first generation Neon earned a &quot;Poor&quot; rating in an offset frontal Crash test conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The second-generation Neon earned a higher &quot;Marginal&quot; rating. The second generation were rated as &quot;Poor&quot; in the side impact crash test (IIHS Safety ratings go from &quot;Poor&quot;, to &quot;Marginal&quot;, &quot;Acceptable&quot; and &quot;Good&quot;). By comparison, the Chevrolet Cavalier performed worse in the small car category in 2005, the Neon&#x27;s final year. Other cars made from 2000 to 2005 that were rated &quot;Poor&quot; when tested without optional side airbags included the Ford Focus, Toyota Corolla, Toyota Prius, Mitsubishi Lancer, and Chevrolet Cobalt. No small car made in this period, tested without side airbags, achieved better than a &quot;Poor.&quot;

In 2005, the Institute carried out side-impact tests on 14 small car models, simulating an impact with an SUV. Among these, the Neon performed the worst. IIHS stated that the Neon had &quot;...major problems beginning with its structure. This car is a disaster...The structure is poor...If this had been a real driver in a real crash, it&#x27;s likely it wouldn’t have been survivable...if safety is a priority, the Neon is a small car to be avoided.&quot;

Second generation headrests were rated as &quot;Poor&quot;.

&quot;Driver deaths&quot; fatality risks statistics — published by the IIHS — rated the Neon and 15 other vehicles among the &quot;Highest rates of driver deaths.&quot;, The Neon had 161 driver deaths per million registered vehicle years, while the average for the Neon class (4-door small) was 103. Other small cars on the list included the Acura RSX (202), Kia Spectra hatchback (191), and the Mitsubishi Eclipse (169).

===Sales===
==Third generation (2016)==

The third generation of the Dodge Neon is the sedan version of Fiat&#x27;s Project Ægea, adapted for the Mexican and Middle Eastern markets as well as marking a comeback of the Neon nameplate after an 11-year absence.

Released for the 2017 model year, the new Neon was positioned for the Mexican market as a &quot;new breed of compact sedan.&quot; The new Neon was introduced in 2016, around the same time the Dodge Dart was expected to end production and there were reports that it would be sold in the U.S. and Canadian markets by 2018 as a replacement for the Dart. Consistent with FCA&#x27;s plans to dedicate U.S. production to Jeep and Ram vehicles while using the North American Free Trade Agreement to make Chrysler and Dodge passenger cars in Canada and Mexico, the Neon was planned to be built and imported from Turkey. Utilizing the Fiat Tipo (2015) platform, the cars were co-developed and produced in Tofaş by Fiat and Turkish Koç Holding. Although marketed in Turkey, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, only Mexico received the Dodge Neon variant.

Plans to market the third-generation Neon vehicle north of Mexico were dropped following General Motors and Ford each paring down their own passenger car lineups in the U.S., including ending sales of potential compact-sized rivals Chevrolet Cruze and Ford Focus in the US and Canada. The Neon was discontinued in Mexico after the 2020 model year, with the final 70 units sold in 2021.

<doc id="997464" wikidata="Q7100057" url="?curid=997464" title="Orbit equation">
<text>In astrodynamics, an [[orbit]] equation defines the path of orbiting body formula_1 around central body formula_2 relative to formula_2, without specifying position as a function of time. Under standard assumptions, a body moving under the influence of a force, directed to a central body, with a magnitude inversely proportional to the square of the distance (such as gravity), has an orbit that is a conic section (i.e. circular orbit, elliptic orbit, parabolic trajectory, hyperbolic trajectory, or radial trajectory) with the central body located at one of the two foci, or &quot;the&quot; focus (Kepler&#x27;s first law).

If the conic section intersects the central body, then the actual trajectory can only be the part above the surface, but for that part the orbit equation and many related formulas still apply, as long as it is a freefall (situation of weightlessness).

== Central, inverse-square law force ==

Consider a two-body system consisting of a central body of mass &quot;M&quot; and a much smaller, orbiting body of mass formula_4, and suppose the two bodies interact via a central, inverse-square law force (such as gravitation). In polar coordinates, the orbit equation can be written as
formula_5
where 
* formula_6 is the separation distance between the two bodies and
* formula_7 is the angle that formula_8 makes with the axis of periapsis (also called the &quot;true anomaly&quot;).
* The parameter formula_9 is the angular momentum of the orbiting body about the central body, and is equal to formula_10, or the mass multiplied by the magnitude of the cross product of the relative position and velocity vectors of the two bodies.
* The parameter formula_11 is the constant for which formula_12 equals the acceleration of the smaller body (for gravitation, formula_11 is the standard gravitational parameter, formula_14). For a given orbit, the larger formula_11, the faster the orbiting body moves in it: twice as fast if the attraction is four times as strong.
* The parameter formula_16 is the eccentricity of the orbit, and is given by
*:formula_17
*:where formula_18 is the energy of the orbit.

The above relation between formula_6 and formula_7 describes a conic section. The value of formula_16 controls what kind of conic section the orbit is:
* when formula_22, the orbit is elliptic (circles are ellipses with formula_23);
* when formula_24, the orbit is parabolic;
* when formula_25, the orbit is hyperbolic.

The minimum value of formula_6 in the equation is:
formula_27
while, if formula_22, the maximum value is:
formula_27

If the maximum is less than the radius of the central body, then the conic section is an ellipse which is fully inside the central body and no part of it is a possible trajectory. If the maximum is more, but the minimum is less than the radius, part of the trajectory is possible:
*if the energy is non-negative (parabolic or hyperbolic orbit): the motion is either away from the central body, or towards it.
*if the energy is negative: the motion can be first away from the central body, up to formula_27 after which the object falls back.

If formula_6 becomes such that the orbiting body enters an atmosphere, then the standard assumptions no longer apply, as in atmospheric reentry.

==Low-energy trajectories==
If the central body is the Earth, and the energy is only slightly larger than the potential energy at the surface of the Earth, then the orbit is elliptic with eccentricity close to 1 and one end of the ellipse just beyond the center of the Earth, and the other end just above the surface. Only a small part of the ellipse is applicable.

If the horizontal speed is formula_32, then the periapsis distance is formula_33. The energy at the surface of the Earth corresponds to that of an elliptic orbit with formula_34 (with formula_35 the radius of the Earth), which can not actually exist because it is an ellipse fully below the surface. The energy increase with increase of formula_36 is at a rate formula_37. The maximum height above the surface of the orbit is the length of the ellipse, minus formula_35, minus the part &quot;below&quot; the center of the Earth, hence twice the increase of formula_39 minus the periapsis distance. At the top the potential energy is formula_40 times this height, and the kinetic energy is formula_41. This adds up to the energy increase just mentioned. The width of the ellipse is 19 minutes times formula_32.

The part of the ellipse above the surface can be approximated by a part of a parabola, which is obtained in a model where gravity is assumed constant. This should be distinguished from the parabolic orbit in the sense of astrodynamics, where the velocity is the escape velocity.

See also trajectory.

==Categorization of orbits==
Consider orbits which are at one point horizontal, near the surface of the Earth. For increasing speeds at this point the orbits are subsequently:
*part of an ellipse with vertical major axis, with the center of the Earth as the far focus (throwing a stone, sub-orbital spaceflight, ballistic missile)
*a circle just above the surface of the Earth (Low Earth orbit)
*an ellipse with vertical major axis, with the center of the Earth as the near focus
*a parabola
*a hyperbola

Note that in the sequence above, formula_43, formula_44 and formula_36 increase monotonically, but formula_16 first decreases from 1 to 0, then increases from 0 to infinity. The reversal is when the center of the Earth changes from being the far focus to being the near focus (the other focus starts near the surface and passes the center of the Earth). We have
:formula_47

Extending this to orbits which are horizontal at another height, and orbits of which the extrapolation is horizontal below the surface of the Earth, we get a categorization of all orbits, except the radial trajectories, for which, by the way, the orbit equation can not be used. In this categorization ellipses are considered twice, so for ellipses with both sides above the surface one can restrict oneself to taking the side which is lower as the reference side, while for ellipses of which only one side is above the surface, taking that side.

<text>The Dodge Neon SRT-4 (also known and later labeled as Dodge SRT-4) is a sport compact car manufactured by Dodge from 2003 to 2005. A turbocharged variant of the Neon, the car was developed by DaimlerChrysler&#x27;s in house PVO (Performance Vehicle Operations) tuner group. PVO was officially renamed SRT (Street and Racing Technology) in 2004. The &quot;4&quot; in the SRT-4&#x27;s name denotes the number of cylinders of the engine. ACR (American Club Racing) and Commemorative Edition models were later introduced as well.

==History==
In 1998, Tom Gale, (then Executive Vice President of Chrysler Product Development and Design), attended the 1998 Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) Show in Las Vegas. Gale noted a list of performance features he saw on the sport compact cars at the show, and wanted to integrate those features into Chrysler&#x27;s compact production car, the Dodge Neon. Gale was the design chief of the original Dodge Viper concept vehicle, and recognized an opportunity to build a sport compact that would appeal to the younger auto generation who grew up on tuner cars, who may prefer a new car with the same performance appeal right off the showroom floor.

A group of young Dodge and Chrysler talent was assembled to put together a vehicle to meet Gale&#x27;s request, with all of the team members sharing first-hand knowledge and familiarity of the existing Dodge Neon. They created a concept car, the 2000 Neon SRT, in just 4 months, with a 2.0 L 16-valve four-cylinder topped with a 45-cubic-inch Eaton supercharger, which produced and of torque at the flywheel on of boost. (Sport Compact Car magazine tested the car in the Feb. 2001 issue and dynoed and torque at the wheels.)

The group put more than 1000 miles on the test track with the vehicle in under two weeks. In November 1999, the car was shown at the SEMA show with a glowing response. The vehicle was then shown at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2000, center stage on a turntable. The team continued to work on the car, to try to bring it to the level of production vehicle, creating a second car using more production-oriented parts in an effort to lower the costs necessary to justify production. They even parked the second car in Gale&#x27;s parking spot in order to get it noticed. Regardless, in fall of 2000, the executive committee rejected the production car proposal. The team put together a list of reasons why the car was not approved, and worked through the list item by item to find solutions to every issue presented. After three more versions of the car, the company&#x27;s Specialty Vehicle Engineering (SVE) team took over the project. The executive committee once again considered the vehicle in the spring of 2001, and this time gave the go ahead for the project.

In January 2002, SVE became known as Performance Vehicle Operations (PVO). The PVO group was responsible for developing the concept car into a production car. A turbocharged 2.4 liter inline-4 gasoline engine (A853 engine) was used. This engine was nearly identical to the 2003 Chrysler PT Cruiser (A855 engine), except the SRT-4 did not have the unique intake manifold required to fit the engine into the PT Cruiser engine bay. The car was then given a New Venture Gear T-850 five-speed manual transmission (based on the unit from the European turbodiesel minivans), equal-length half shafts, and a high capacity Sachs performance clutch. The suspension had stiffer springs, SRT-tuned Tokico struts (with travel reduced to provide clearance for the larger wheels), and larger front and rear sway bars were added. A unique steering gear, PT Cruiser steering knuckles, and an updated K member were also incorporated. Front brakes used 11.0 in (280 mm) vented disc brakes with extra thick rotors to prevent warping, and 10.6 in (270 mm) non-vented disc brakes in the rear, with single piston calipers (57mm front, 36mm rear).

17 x 6 inch cast aluminum wheels were used, with an offset of 43mm, along with 205/50/17 Michelin Pilot Sport performance tires. The wheels were designed with a unique spoke pattern to allow for improved airflow to the brakes, and were similar to that of the TSW VX1 wheels used on the original 2000 Neon SRT. Unique side skirts, rear fascia, and a large rear wing (spoiler) were used to upgrade the exterior look of the vehicle. The cooling ducts (front nostrils) were added to the pre-production car in late 2002 on the front fascia to help reduce temperatures in the engine bay of the vehicle.

On the interior, the standard agate-colored front seats were modeled after the Dodge Viper SRT-10 seats, and featured enhanced lumbar and lateral side bolsters to stabilize occupants during performance driving. In 2004, base Neon side airbag seats were added as an option. A faux carbon fiber steering wheel and shift boot were used, along with a satin silver “cue ball” type shift knob and silver aluminum floor pedals. Unique gauge designs in the SRT-4 (which were exclusive to the SRT lineup) featured special silver faces with satin silver ring accents, and the SRT-4 logo on the facing. The same satin metal trim was also featured on the instrument panel center stack, climate control knobs and on the door handles. A silver (white in early 2003 models) Auto-Meter brand turbo boost/vacuum gauge was set to the right of the instrument cluster. Like all other Neon models, the SRT-4 had power front windows, and manual rear windows, a costs saving feature. Overall, the vehicle&#x27;s entire powertrain (engine and transmission), suspension, braking system, exhaust, wheels, and tires were upgraded from that of the base model Neon, along with the interior upgrades. The production model was produced in Belvidere, Illinois, with 84% US content.

In 2003, the Dodge Neon SRT-4 went on sale to the public. At the time, the car was the second fastest stock production vehicle in the Chrysler/Dodge lineup, second only to the Viper. In 2004, PVO changed their name to Street &amp; Racing Technology (SRT), Chrysler&#x27;s high-performance automotive group. The 2004 model was updated with more power and torque, and included a torque-sensing Quaife limited-slip differential, larger fuel injectors, new engine management software, BF Goodrich g-Force T/A KDW-2 three season ultra-high-performance tires, and paint/trim changes. Dodge removed the “Neon” designation from the vehicle in 2004, marketing the car simply as the “SRT-4”. In 2005, an American Club Racer (ACR) package and limited edition numbered Commemorative version of the SRT-4 were also offered.

Initially, Dodge expected to sell a conservative number of only 2,500 units per year. However, during the three year production run (2003 through 2005), more than 25,000 Neon SRT-4s were produced. With the discontinuation of the PL platform after model year 2005, the SRT-4 ceased production. In 2008 Dodge introduced the Caliber SRT-4 as a replacement.

==Performance==

==Engine details==
The SRT-4 used the same basic engine block as the naturally aspirated 2003+ 2.4L, and was different from the years previous used in the naturally aspirated Chrysler 2.4L mid-size cars such as the PT Cruiser and four-door Stratus. The SRT4 engine had many improvements, including: stronger crank case webbing, a thicker deck with 11 mm head bolts (vs 10 mm), an oil drain back for the turbo, a cast aluminum structural oil pan, a higher capacity oil pump, a crankshaft of higher hardness steel, improved machining of bearing journals, oil squirters (to cool underside of pistons), eutectic aluminum alloy pistons made specially by Mahle, and forged connecting rods with cracked caps and 9 mm bolts. The cylinder head was also different for turbo engines, from naturally aspirated. The turbo version (PT Cruiser GT Turbo and SRT-4) included: larger diameter valves and seats, exhaust valves made of Inconel, improved cooling and larger oil drain back passages, different camshafts. The PT Cruiser Turbo engine package differs from the SRT-4 because the intake manifold, turbocharger plumbing and intercooler are different. The SRT-4 intercooler was a front-mounted cast aluminum 8-row unit produced by Valeo, unique in its efficiency and computer designed end tanks for air flow.

The turbocharger was a reverse rotation Mitsubishi TD04LR-15Gk with a turbine inlet. Tight packaging forced some creative thinking on the turbocharger. The TD04 compressor has a compressor bypass valve built right into the compressor housing. The exhaust manifold and turbine housing were cast in one piece by Mitsubishi from high-nickel Ni-Resist steel. The one-piece design improved flow, reduced size and reduced thermal mass for quicker cat light-off. The turbine discharge was also part of the manifold/turbine housing casting, and it looped back around and hit the manifold again on its way to the catalytic converter. Where they met, there was a wastegate valve; keeping the wastegate valve away from the turbine housing improved flow where it mattered most. Maximum boost in stock form was around . Piston velocities and valve-train components force a rev limit of 6240 rpm although MOPAR upped the ante with their Stage 2 and 3 kits which have a rev limit of 6500 rpm.

The exhaust system for the vehicle consists of steel tubing, which is run first through the catalytic converter, then through two resonators. The exhaust then splits into two separate sections of piping, exiting through two stainless steel tips at the rear of the vehicle. The exhaust system is unique in that there is no muffler, instead relying on the turbocharger and resonators to reduce the exhaust volume. The result is a very distinctive and audible exhaust note.

==2005 Commemorative Edition==

In 2005, Dodge released an SRT-4 Commemorative Edition. This model (along with the Commemorative Edition versions of the Viper SRT-10 and Ram SRT-10) was created to celebrate the SRT vehicles.

This limited, numbered version included:

*&quot;Electric Blue&quot; painted &quot;Viper&quot; stripes over the &quot;Stone White&quot; colored body.
*Blue stitching on the floor mats, shift boots, seats, and steering wheel.
*Stainless steel &quot;SRT-4&quot; door sill plates.

*A Commemorative Edition booklet (same booklet included with the Commemorative Vipers and Ram SRT-10&#x27;s).
*No performance extras were added on the Commemorative Edition.

==2003 SRT-4 Extreme LightWeight==
In 2003, Dodge engineers built a special SRT-4 Extreme LightWeight for the 2003 SEMA show. It was designed to showcase the factory upgrade parts available for the SRT-4 from Mopar. The vehicle featured lightweight, carbon fiber body pieces (produced in-house), a polycarbonate rear window, and the front window glass removed for weight reduction. The interior was stripped completely, with only the stock dash remaining. A single Recaro racing seat, a harness, and a roll cage were installed for safety. The car featured the first stage 3R Mopar engine performance kit and stage 3R coilovers. Overall, the weight of the vehicle was reduced by to wet, and was dyno&#x27;d at 360 hp (270 kW) and 383 lb•ft (519 N•m) (at the wheels) by &quot;Sport Compact Car&quot; magazine. On drag slicks, it ran an 11.83-second pass at 123 mph (198 km/h) in 70 °F (21 °C) weather. This one-off SRT-4 was used for media events and testing of the Mopar development parts, and was destroyed as an asset reduction move in 2009.

==Awards==

==Racing==
In 2003, Cory O&#x27;Brien and Erich Heuschele drove an SRT-4 to a 1st in class and 8th overall finish in the Tire Rack Cannonball One Lap of America.

In SCCA ProRally racing, the SRT-4 (and more recently the ACR version) has dominated the Group 5 (2WD) class since 2003. In just its first year competing, the Dodge ended the stranglehold that the FWD DSMs and Volkswagens had on the class. With three competing the following year, the SRT-4 won every 2004 series race and end-of-season award. The SRT-4 has won every Group 5 and 2-Wheel-Drive class championship in US ProRally and Sno Drift since 2003, and its unprecedented dominance in 2004 helped Dodge earn its first US ProRally Manufacturers Championship in 28 years.

In 2005, Jeff Lepper drove the SRT-4 to its first ever national road racing win in the NASA US Touring Car Championship at California Speedway in Fontana.

In 2005, Dale Seeley, Kolin Aspergren, and Jamin Cummings drove an SRT-4 to a 1st in class and 8th overall finish in the Tire Rack Cannonball One Lap of America.

In 2006, the Dodge SRT-4 officially became the world&#x27;s fastest production 4-cylinder car, averaging at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in a car driven by Jorgen Moller. The vehicle was tuned by Dave Harris and Phil Hurst for Racedeck Racing.
Multiple SRT-4s were raced in the SCCA SPEED World Challenge – Touring Car Series, and in 2006 – their second year of competition – had become one of the more successful platforms in the series. Robb Holland, of 3R Racing, became the first Pro driver to put the SRT-4 on the podium with his 3rd-place finish at Road America in August 2006. This was Dodge&#x27;s first podium and first manufacturer&#x27;s points in World Challenge Touring Car competition. Holland would finish the season with 3 top 10 finishes and two top 5 qualifying efforts in the SRT-4.

In 2007, Doug Wind, Devin Clancy, and Ken Brewer drove an SRT-4 to a 1st in class and 5th overall finish in the Tire Rack Cannonball One Lap of America.

In 2007, George Biskup drove an SRT-4 Neon to several SCCA T-2 National wins, and set the Track Qualifying Record at Road America. His lap time of 2:33.922 remained the record for several years. Earlier in 2005, Biskup won the first SCCA National race he entered at Gingerman Raceway. Due to snowy conditions, the race was run under yellow and finishing positions were as qualified, Biskup&#x27;s SRT-4 was on the pole with the fastest qualifying time.

In 2007, Curt Simmons won the U.S. Touring Car Championship in an SRT-4 and Dodge won the season manufacturers points championship by 29 points over Honda behind the strength of several SRT-4&#x27;s.

In 2007, Stan Wilson won the Speed World Challenge Touring Car Rookie Driver of the Year and the Sunoco Hard Charger of the Year awards driving the Sorted Performance Dodge SRT-4. This was Dodge&#x27;s first title in Speed World Challenge Touring Car.

In 2008, Curt Simmons attempts to defend his USTCC series championship, winning on June 29, 2008, at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, CA.

In 2012, Russ Deane set a new world land speed record for four-cylinder production cars (SRT-4) of more than . He surpassed the previous record of 224 mph for a Class F/PS vehicle. Deane and his Hinckley Automotive race team were participating in Speed Week at the Bonneville Salt Flats. His race team included Jim Hinckley, Dave Harris (chief), Craig Ohlson, &quot;Camel&quot; Joe George, Troy Cheney, Stuart Gosswein, and Jim Hinckley Jr.

<text>The night sky is the nighttime appearance of celestial objects like stars, planets, and the Moon, which are visible in a clear sky between sunset and sunrise, when the Sun is below the horizon.

Natural light sources in a night sky include moonlight, starlight, and airglow, depending on location and timing. Aurorae light up the skies above the polar circles. Occasionally, a large coronal mass ejection from the Sun or simply high levels of solar wind may extend the phenomenon toward the Equator.

The night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. In the past, for instance, farmers have used the status of the night sky as a calendar to determine when to plant crops. Many cultures have drawn constellations between stars in the sky, using them in association with legends and mythology about their deities.

The history of astrology has generally been based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or explain events on Earth. The scientific study of objects in the night sky takes place in the context of observational astronomy.

Visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by light pollution. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of sky brightness. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. Optical filters and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for optimal views, both professional and amateur astronomers seek locations far from urban skyglow.

== Brightness ==


The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night, even in the absence of moonlight and city lights, can be easily observed, since if the sky were absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.

The intensity of the sky brightness varies greatly over the day and the primary cause differs as well. During daytime when the Sun is above the horizon direct scattering of sunlight (Rayleigh scattering) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. In twilight, the period of time between sunset and sunrise, the situation is more complicated and a further differentiation is required. Twilight is divided in three segments according to how far the Sun is below the horizon in segments of 6°.

After sunset the civil twilight sets in, and ends when the Sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the nautical twilight, when the Sun reaches heights of −6° and −12°, after which comes the astronomical twilight defined as the period from −12° to −18°. When the Sun drops more than 18° below the horizon, the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.

Several sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely airglow, indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial light pollution.

== Visual presentation ==
Depending on local sky cloud cover, pollution, humidity, and light pollution levels, the stars visible to the unaided naked eye appear as hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of white pinpoints of light in an otherwise near black sky together with some faint nebulae or clouds of light. In ancient times the stars were often assumed to be equidistant on a dome above the Earth because they are much too far away for stereopsis to offer any depth cues. Visible stars range in color from blue (hot) to red (cold), but with such small points of faint light, most look white because they stimulate the rod cells without triggering the cone cells. If it is particularly dark and a particularly faint celestial object is of interest, averted vision may be helpful.

The stars of the night sky cannot be counted unaided because they are so numerous and there is no way to track which have been counted and which have not. Further complicating the count, fainter stars may appear and disappear depending on exactly where the observer is looking. The result is an impression of an extraordinarily vast star field.

Because stargazing is best done from a dark place away from city lights, dark adaptation is important to achieve and maintain. It takes several minutes for eyes to adjust to the darkness necessary for seeing the most stars, and surroundings on the ground are hard to discern. A red flashlight can be used to illuminate star charts and telescope parts without undoing the dark adaptation.

=== Constellations ===
Star charts are produced to aid stargazers in identifying constellations and other celestial objects. Constellations are prominent because their stars tend to be brighter than other nearby stars in the sky. Different cultures have created different groupings of constellations based on differing interpretations of the more-or-less random patterns of dots in the sky. Constellations were identified without regard to distance to each star, but instead as if they were all dots on a dome.

Orion is among the most prominent and recognizable constellations. The Big Dipper (which has a wide variety of other names) is helpful for navigation in the northern hemisphere because it points to Polaris, the north star.

The pole stars are special because they are approximately in line with the Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation so they appear to stay in one place while the other stars rotate around them through the course of a night (or a year).

=== Planets ===
Planets, named for the Greek word for &#x27;wanderer&#x27;, process through the starfield a little each day, executing loops with time scales dependent on the length of the planet&#x27;s year or orbital period around the Sun. Planets, to the naked eye, appear as points of light in the sky with variable brightness. Planets shine due to sunlight reflecting or scattering from the planets&#x27; surface or atmosphere. Thus, the relative Sun-planet-Earth positions determine the planet&#x27;s brightness. With a telescope or good binoculars, the planets appear as discs demonstrating finite size, and it is possible to observe orbiting moons which cast shadows onto the host planet&#x27;s surface. Venus is the most prominent planet, often called the &quot;morning star&quot; or &quot;evening star&quot; because it is brighter than the stars and often the only &quot;star&quot; visible near sunrise or sunset, depending on its location in its orbit. Because of its brightness, Venus can sometimes be seen after sunrise. Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are also visible to the naked eye in the night sky.

=== The Moon ===
The Moon appears as a grey disc in the sky with cratering visible to the naked eye. It spans, depending on its exact location, 29–33 arcminutes – which is about the size of a thumbnail at arm&#x27;s length, and is readily identified. Over 29.53 days on average, the moon goes through a full cycle of lunar phases. People can generally identify phases within a few days by looking at the Moon. Unlike stars and most planets, the light reflected from the Moon is bright enough to be seen during the day.

Some of the most spectacular moons come during the full moon phase near sunset or sunrise. The Moon on the horizon benefits from the Moon illusion which makes it appear larger. The Sun&#x27;s light reflected from the Moon traveling through the atmosphere also appears to color the Moon orange and/or red.

=== Comets ===
Comets come to the night sky only rarely. Comets are illuminated by the Sun, and their tails extend away from the Sun. A comet with a visible tail is quite unusual – a great comet appears about once a decade. They tend to be visible only shortly before sunrise or after sunset because those are the times they are close enough to the Sun to show a tail.

===Clouds===
Clouds obscure the view of other objects in the sky, though varying thicknesses of cloud cover have differing effects. A very thin cirrus cloud in front of the moon might produce a rainbow-colored ring around the moon. Stars and planets are too small or dim to take on this effect and are instead only dimmed (often to the point of invisibility). Thicker cloud cover obscures celestial objects entirely, making the sky black or reflecting city lights back down. Clouds are often close enough to afford some depth perception, though they are hard to see without moonlight or light pollution.

=== Other objects ===
On clear dark nights in unpolluted areas, when the Moon appears thin or below the horizon, the Milky Way, a band of what looks like white dust, can be seen.

The Magellanic Clouds of the southern sky are easily mistaken to be Earth-based clouds (hence the name) but are in fact collections of stars found outside the Milky Way known as dwarf galaxies.

Zodiacal light is a glow that appears near the points where the Sun rises and sets, and is caused by sunlight interacting with interplanetary dust.

Gegenschein is a faint bright spot in the night sky centered at the antisolar point, caused by the backscatter of sunlight by interplanetary dust.

Shortly after sunset and before sunrise, artificial satellites often look like stars – similar in brightness and size – but move relatively quickly. Those that fly in low Earth orbit cross the sky in a couple of minutes. Some satellites, including space debris, appear to blink or have a periodic fluctuation in brightness because they are rotating. Satellite flares can appear brighter than Venus, with notable examples including the International Space Station (ISS) and Iridium Satellites.

Meteors streak across the sky infrequently. During a meteor shower, they may average one a minute at irregular intervals, but otherwise their appearance is a random surprise. The occasional meteor will make a bright, fleeting streak across the sky, and they can be very bright in comparison to the night sky.

Aircraft are also visible at night, distinguishable at a distance from other objects because their navigation lights blink.

==Future and past==
Beside the Solar System objects changing in the course of them 
and Earth orbiting and changing orbits over time around the Sun and in the case of the Moon around Earth, appearing over time smaller by expanding its orbit, the night sky also changes over the course of the years with stars having a proper motion and changing brightness because of being variable stars, by the distance to them getting larger or other celestial events like supernovas.

Over a timescale of tens of billions of years the night sky in the Local Group will significantly change when the coalescence of the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way merge into a single elliptical galaxy.

<doc id="997483" wikidata="Q5442453" url="?curid=997483" title="Feller buncher">
<text>A feller buncher is a type of harvester used in logging. It is a motorized vehicle with an attachment that can rapidly gather and cut a tree before felling it.

&quot;Feller&quot; is a traditional name for someone who cuts down trees, and &quot;bunching&quot; is the skidding and assembly of two or more trees. A feller buncher performs both of these harvesting functions and consists of a standard heavy equipment base with a tree-grabbing device furnished with a chain-saw, circular saw or a shear—a pinching device designed to cut small trees off at the base. The machine then places the cut tree on a stack suitable for a skidder, forwarder, or yarder for transport to further processing such as delimbing, bucking, loading, or chipping.

Some wheeled feller bunchers lack an articulated arm, and must drive close to a tree to grasp it.

In cut-to-length logging a harvester performs the tasks of a feller buncher and additionally does delimbing and bucking.

== Components and Felling attachment ==
Feller buncher is either tracked or wheeled and has self-levelling cabin and matches with different felling heads. For steep terrain, tracked feller buncher is being used because it provides high level of traction to the steep slope and also has high level of stability. For flat terrain, wheeled feller buncher is more efficient compared to tracked feller buncher. It is common that levelling cabins are matched with both wheeled and tracked feller buncher for steep terrain as it provides operator comfort and helps keeping the standard of tree felling production. The size and type of trees determine which type of felling heads being used.

=== Types of felling heads ===
Disc Saw Head – It can provide a high speed of cutting when the head is pushed against the tree. Then, the clamp arms will hold the tree when the tree is almost completed cutting. It is able to cut and gather multiple trees in the felling head. The disc saw head with good ground speed provides high production, which allows it to keep more than one skidder working continuously.

Shear Blade Head -  It is placed against the tree and the clamp arms will hold the tree firmly. Then, the blade will activate and start cutting the tree. Same as disc saw head, it can hold multiple trees before they are placed on the ground.

Chain Saw Head – The floppy head provides minimal control to place the trees on the ground. It might not suit to collect the cut trees or gather the cut stems in the felling head.

==Cost-effectiveness==

The purchase cost of a feller buncher is around $180,000 USD and its fuel consumption and lubricant consumption is high among other mechanical harvesting equipment. The feller buncher also has the highest hourly cost which is around $99.5 when comparing other equipment such as a harvesters and grapple skidders. Although the total cost of feller buncher is high in overall, the unit production price is the lowest which explains why feller buncher is considered the most cost-effective harvesting equipment. The average unit cost of the feller buncher is $12.1/m3 while the unit cost of the harvesters is $16.5/m3. The unit cost of the feller buncher is primary affected by the tree size and the tree volume. The unit felling cost is lower when the tree size increased. For example, tree with 5 inches at DBH has the unit cost of $70 while tree with 15 inches at DBH has the unit cost of $12. As the cost of feller buncher is high, only large tree volume can produce more profit to cover the high average cost. In terms of stump height, lower stump height can maximise the use of natural resources and prevent wood waste. Mechanical felling such as using feller buncher can prevent 30% of value loss caused by the high stumps.

== Maintenance ==
Feller buncher requires daily maintenance before operation and some components only require periodic maintenance. It could ensure the safety of operators and all the workers around the operation. If damaged or faulty machine is operated, it could result in further damage to the machine which can be more expensive to repair.

=== Daily or Every 8 hours ===
==== Lubrication ====
The felling head is considered one of the hardest part of the feller buncher and it is necessary to apply lubricant to every joint for daily maintenance. It is suggested to apply lubricant to saw head clamps, wrist attachment and driveshaft bearings during every maintenance. The use of grease should meet the extreme pressure performance standard and contains 3% of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2). MoS2 can prevent the wear takes place where the metal to metal contact exists.

==== Fuel ====
It is also important to check if there is enough fuel for the operation. Feller bunchers use diesel fuel to generate power. In most of the cases, the fuel is preferably to have cetane number greater than 50 (minimum 40). This is suitable for operation at temperatures below -20 °C (-4 °F) or elevations more than 1500m (5000 Ft.). The Cloud Point of the fuel is preferably at least 5 °C (9 °F) lower than the expected low temperature. It is also suggested that the sulphur content of the fuel should not be more than 0.5% as it could reduce 50% of the service interval for the engine oil and filter.

==== Engine coolant ====
Operators have the responsibility to check the engine coolant level of the feller buncher before starting the engine. The coolant prevents cylinder linear erosion and pitting, and provides protection during extremely low temperature for up to -37 °C (-34 °F). It is recommended to use coolants for heavy-duty engines which are relatively low silicate ethylene glycol base. There are two forms of coolants: pre-diluted or concentrate. Water is required to dilute the concentrated coolant with an approximate ratio of 50:50. The use of supplemental coolant addictive might be also required in the concentrated coolant in order to provide protection against corrosion. Distilled, deionised, or demineralised water is suggested for mixing the concentrated coolant because when some water compositions mix with other substances could form a precipitate, causing damage or blockage in the engine.

=== Risk management approach ===
During maintenance, there are common working hazards related to two main areas: working environment and exhaust system. When working on the exhaust system, be aware of the hot components around the engine. Workers could wear personal protective equipment such as safety spectacles, heat-proof gloves and safety boots. When feller buncher is elevated for service or maintenance, falls from height might happen. Related injuries could be avoided by ensuring dryness of all the walking surface, wiping any oils or other liquid substances on the floor. Also, ensure the feller buncher is parked on a level and stable ground during maintenance. When getting in and out of the machinery, workers are suggested to use three point of contact with two hands holding the handrails and one foot on a step. It is also important to provide sufficient lighting for all the working sites at all time of service.

==Safety==

Logging is considered one of the most dangerous occupations. This is because many loggers are injured by the falling objects which are large in size and heavy. “Struck by object” is the most common injuries that reported in the logging industry due to the manual use of equipment during the logging procedures. There is evidence that using mechanized harvesting equipment could reduce the rate of “struck by” injuries. One study indicates that total injury claims could be reduced by 14.2%, while the “struck by” injuries could be reduced by 8.2%, when comparing the changes before and after the use of feller buncher. The significant decline in the number of “struck by” injuries after using the feller buncher in the logging companies supported the statement that using mechanized harvesting equipment could lessen overall injuries. The evidence also found that the rate of injuries in the logging companies without using feller bunchers had increased slightly throughout a period of time, increasing from 14.5% to 17.5%, in five years. In terms of trees fatality, areas with lower levels of mechanization in harvesting resulted in higher rate of trees fatality. For instance, in Eastern areas of the United States, research which compared the conventional and mechanized logging operations, indicated the number of injuries, when using the conventional approach, is three times greater than that of using the mechanized equipment such as a feller buncher. However, mechanized related injury could be raised accordingly, especially when performing machine maintenance or repair. These kinds of injuries could be serious and also costly.

==Limitations==
Feller buncher could be highly productive and cost-effective but there are several limitations. Feller buncher is less beneficial when performing operations on a very rough and relatively steep land. For example, in Appalachian hardwood area, trees have heavy crowns and are grown on the steep slopes which requires tracked feller bunchers in the operations. Although tracked feller bunchers allow operations on a steep slope, the cost-effectiveness is not well studied. Also, manual felling can operate on the steeper slopes than the feller bunchers do. On the other hand, feller bunchers are cost-effective only when there is a high volume of trees in the operations. If there is not enough timber to harvest, the unit cost can be expensive, especially when the majority of the operation site is steep slopes. A 2013, University of Maine study suggests that the use of feller bunchers could cause medium to high level of stand damage from 7% to 25%. However, in comparison with other equipment such as harvesters, the damage that is caused by the feller bunchers is less severe.

<doc id="997497" wikidata="Q1332289" url="?curid=997497" title="Black hat (computer security)">
<text>A black hat (black hat hacker or blackhat) is a computer hacker who violates laws or ethical standards for nefarious purposes, such as cybercrime, cyberwarfare, or malice. These acts can range from piracy to identity theft. A black hat is often referred to as a &quot;cracker&quot;.

The term originates from 1950s westerns, with &quot;bad guys&quot; (criminals) typically depicted as having worn black hats and &quot;good guys&quot; (heroes) wearing white ones. In the same way, black hat hacking is contrasted with the more ethical white hat approach to hacking. Additionally, there exists a third category, called grey hat hacking, characterized by individuals who hack, usually with good intentions but by illegal means.

== Description ==
Criminals who intentionally enter computer networks with malicious intent are known as &quot;black hat hackers&quot;. They may distribute malware that steals data (particularly login credentials), financial information, or personal information (such as passwords or credit card numbers). This information is often sold on the dark web. Malware can also be used to hold computers hostage or destroy files. Some hackers may also modify or destroy data in addition to stealing it. While hacking has become an important tool for governments to gather intelligence, black hats tend to work alone or with organized crime groups for financial gain.

Black hat hackers may be novices or experienced criminals. They are usually competent infiltrators of computer networks and can circumvent security protocols. They may create malware, a form of software that enables illegitimate access to computer networks, enables the monitoring of victims&#x27; online activities, and may lock infected devices. Black hat hackers can be involved in cyber espionage or protests in addition to pursuing personal or financial gain. For some hackers, cybercrime may be an addictive experience.

== History ==

One of the earliest and most notorious black hat hacks was the 1979 hacking of The Ark by Kevin Mitnick. The Ark computer system was used by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to develop the RSTS/E operating system software.

The WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017 is another example of black hat hacking. Around 400,000 computers in 150 countries were infected within two weeks. The creation of decryption tools by security experts within days limited the extortion payments to approximately $120,000, or slightly more than 1% of the potential payout.

The notable data breaches typically published by major news services are the work of black hat hackers. In a data breach, hackers can steal the financial, personal, or digital information of customers, patients, and constituents. The hackers can then use this information to smear a business or government agency, sell it on the dark web, or extort money from businesses, government agencies, or individuals. The United States experienced a record number of 1,862 data breaches in 2021, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center&#x27;s 2021 Data Breach Report. Data breaches have been on the rise for some time. From 2013 to 2014, black hat hackers broke into Yahoo and stole 3 billion customer records, making it possibly the largest data breach ever. In addition, the adult website Adult FriendFinder was hacked in October 2016, and over 412 million customer records were taken. A data breach that occurred between May and July 2017 exposed more than 145 million customer records, making the national credit bureau Equifax another victim of black hat hacking.

== Strategies ==

=== Concealing ===
One of the most famous black hat methods is to utilize nasty &quot;doorway pages&quot;, which are intended to rank highly for specific search queries. Accordingly, the substance of these doorway pages is stowed away from both the clients and the web indexes. Doorway pages are designed to deceive search engines so that they cannot index or rank a website for synonymous keywords or phrases.

=== Keyword stuffing ===
Another form of black hat search engine optimization (SEO) is known as keyword stuffing, which involves repeatedly using the same keywords to try to trick search engines. This tactic involves using irrelevant keywords on a webpage (such as on the homepage or in metadata tags) to make it appear more relevant for particular keywords, deceiving people who visit the site.

=== Link farming ===
Link farming occurs when multiple websites or pages link to a particular website. This is done to profit from the pay-per-click (PPC) advertisements on these websites or pages. The issue is that the links only point to the specific website because it promises something in return, when in fact they are only there to increase traffic to the desired website and its popularity. These websites are unethical and will damage the credibility of the website&#x27;s other pages, possibly reducing its income potential.

=== Shrouding ===
Shrouding involves showing different content to clients and web search tools. A website may present search engines with information irrelevant to the website&#x27;s real content. This is done to boost the website&#x27;s visibility in search results.

=== Spamdexing ===
Spamdexing is a form of black hat SEO that involves using software to inject backlinks to a website into search engine results. This is done solely to raise the website&#x27;s ranking in search engines.

=== Unethical redirects ===
A redirect link is considered unethical if it takes the user to a webpage different from the one indicated in the link. For instance, it is unethical to have a link that should take the user to the website &quot;ABC&quot; but instead takes them to &quot;XYZ&quot;. Users are tricked into following an unintended path, even though they might not be interested in the website they land on.

== Examples of famous black hats ==

* Kevin Mitnick is one of the most well-known black hat hackers. At one point, he was the most wanted cybercriminal in the world. He hacked into over forty major corporations, including Motorola and IBM, and even the US National Defense warning system. He was taken into custody and incarcerated in 1995. He became a cybersecurity consultant after his release in 2001, utilizing his hacking expertise for white hat hacking.
* Vladimir Levin is a Russian hacker who, while working with a dial-up connection and a laptop from his Saint Petersburg apartment in 1994, accessed the accounts of several large corporate customers of Citibank, stealing USD$10.7 million. He ended up spending three years in jail. However, in 2005, an anonymous hacker group claimed responsibility for the theft, stating that they only sold Vladimir the data needed to steal the money.

== Other hat types ==

=== White hat ===
An ethical security hacker is referred to as a white hat or white hat hacker. The term &quot;ethical hacking&quot; is meant to mean more than just penetration testing. White hat hackers aim to discover any flaws in the current system with the owner&#x27;s permission. Many organizations engage white hat hackers to enhance their network security through activities such as vulnerability assessments. Their primary objective is to assist the organization.

=== Grey hat ===
A grey hat is a hacker who typically does not have malicious intent but often violates laws or common ethical standards. A vulnerability will not be illegally exploited by a grey hat, nor will it instruct others on how to do so; however, the grey hat may trade this information for personal gain. A special group of gray hats are hacktivists, who hack to promote social change.

The ideas of &quot;white hat&quot; and &quot;black hat&quot; hackers led to the use of the term &quot;grey hat&quot; at the end of the 1990s.

Another difference between these types of hackers is how they find vulnerabilities. The black hat will break into any system or network to uncover sensitive information for personal gain, whereas the white hat does so at the request of their employer or with explicit permission to determine how secure it is against hackers. The grey hat typically possesses the white hat&#x27;s skills and intentions and the black hat&#x27;s disregard for permission or laws. A grey hat hacker might request organizations for voluntary compensation for their activities.

<doc id="997509" wikidata="Q5073245" url="?curid=997509" title="Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire">
<text>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court in which the Court articulated the fighting words doctrine, a limitation of the First Amendment&#x27;s guarantee of freedom of speech.

== Background ==
On April 6, 1940, Walter Chaplinsky, a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, was using the public sidewalk as a pulpit in downtown Rochester, passing out pamphlets and calling organized religion a &quot;racket&quot;. After a large crowd had begun blocking the roads and generally causing a scene, a police officer removed Chaplinsky to take him to police headquarters. Upon seeing the town marshal (who had returned to the scene after warning Chaplinsky earlier to keep it down and avoid causing a commotion), Chaplinsky attacked the marshal verbally. He was then arrested. The complaint against Chaplinsky stated that he shouted: &quot;You are a God-damned racketeer&quot; and &quot;a damned Fascist&quot;. Chaplinsky admitted that he said the words charged in the complaint, with the exception of &quot;God&quot;.

For this, he was charged and convicted under a New Hampshire statute forbidding intentionally offensive speech directed at others in a public place. Under New Hampshire&#x27;s Offensive Conduct law (chap. 378, para. 2 of the NH. Public Laws) it is illegal for anyone to address &quot;any offensive, derisive or annoying word to anyone who is lawfully in any street or public place ... or to call him by an offensive or derisive name.&quot;

Chaplinsky appealed the fine he was assessed, claiming that the law was &quot;vague&quot; and that it infringed upon his First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech.

=== Alternate views ===
Some modern legal historians have disputed the generally accepted version of events that led to Chaplinsky&#x27;s arrest.

Columbia Law School professor Vincent Blasi&#x27;s article on the topic describes the events thus: while preaching, Chaplinsky was surrounded by men who mocked Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; objections to saluting the flag. One man attempted to hit Chaplinsky in full view of the town marshal, who warned Chaplinsky that he was in danger but did not arrest his assailant. After the marshal left, another man produced a flagpole and attempted to impale Chaplinsky; while Chaplinsky was pinned against a car by the pole, other members of the crowd struck him. A police officer arrived and, rather than dispersing the crowd, took Chaplinsky into custody.

En route to the station, the officer, as well as members of the crowd, insulted Chaplinsky and his religion. Chaplinsky responded by calling the town marshal, who had returned to assist the officer, a &quot;damn fascist and a racketeer&quot; and was arrested for the use of offensive language in public.

== Opinion of the Court ==
The Court, in a unanimous decision, upheld the arrest. Writing the decision for the Court, Justice Frank Murphy advanced a &quot;two-tier theory&quot; of the First Amendment. Certain &quot;well-defined and narrowly limited&quot; categories of speech fall outside the bounds of constitutional protection. Thus, &quot;the lewd and obscene, the profane, the slanderous&quot;, and (in this case) insulting or &quot;fighting&quot; words neither contributed to the expression of ideas nor possessed any &quot;social value&quot; in the search for truth.

Murphy wrote:
There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or &quot;fighting&quot; words those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.

== Subsequent case law ==
Subsequent cases, in the Supreme Court, lower federal courts, and state courts have reached diverse conclusions on what constitute fighting words that are outside the protection of the First Amendment. The cases have also varied on what contexts – such as the reaction of hearers (public officials, police officers, ordinary citizens) – make a difference for the limits on protected speech. A particularly provocative example occurred in &quot;Cohen v. California&quot; (1971) in which an individual was criminally charged for wearing, in a courthouse, a jacket on which was written &quot;Fuck the Draft&quot;. The Supreme Court held that the &quot;Chaplinsky&quot; doctrine did not control this case, and overturned the conviction. The Court&#x27;s opinion, by Justice John Marshall Harlan II, declared, &quot;For while the particular four-letter word being litigated here is perhaps more distasteful than most others of its genre, it is nevertheless often true that one man&#x27;s vulgarity is another&#x27;s lyric.&quot;

David L. Hudson Jr., a legal scholar writing in 2003, over 60 years after the &quot;Chaplinsky&quot; decision, noted that lower courts &quot;have reached maddeningly inconsistent results&quot; on what is and is not protected by the First Amendment in the area of fighting words.

<text>A vigilance committee is a group of private citizens who take it upon themselves to administer law and order or exercise power in places where they consider the governmental structures or actions inadequate. Prominent historical examples of vigilance committees engaged in forms of vigilantism include abolitionist committees who, beginning in the 1830s, worked to free enslaved people and aid fugitive slaves, in violation of the laws at the time. However, many other vigilance committees were explicitly grounded in racial prejudice and xenophobia, administering extrajudicial punishment to abolitionists or members of minority groups.

==American vigilance committees==

===Abolition and fugitive slaves===
Abolitionists met at Faneuil Hall in the 1830s and formed the Committee of Vigilance and Safety to &quot;take all measures that they shall deem expedient to protect the colored people of this city in the enjoyment of their lives and liberties.&quot; The abolitionist New York Committee of Vigilance and Vigilant Committee of Philadelphia were also established in the 1830s and assisted fugitive slaves and the Underground Railroad.

Between 1850 and 1860, following the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, professional bounty hunters began swarming through Northern states searching for missing enslaved people. In response, vigilance committees were set up in several places in the North to assist the escaped enslaved people. For example, Gerrit Smith called the Fugitive Slave Convention of 1850 &quot;on behalf of the New York State Vigilance Committee.&quot; Many such committees were integral parts of the Underground Railroad.

===In the American West===
In the Western United States, before and after the Civil War, various vigilance committees formed with the stated purpose of maintaining law and order and administer summary justice where governmental law enforcement was inadequate. In reality, those high in the social hierarchy often used them to attack maligned groups, including recent immigrants and racial or ethnic groups. In newly settled areas, vigilance committees promised security and mediated land disputes. In ranching areas, they ruled on ranch boundaries, registered brands, and protected cattle and horses. In the mining districts, they defended claims, settled claim disputes, and attempted to protect miners and other residents. In California, some residents formed vigilance committees to take control of officials whom they considered to be corrupt. This occurred in San Francisco during the 1856 trial of Charles Cora (Belle Cora&#x27;s husband) and James Casey.

=== Other United States vigilance committees ===

*In 1835, after a kangaroo court &quot;conviction&quot;, a vigilance committee in Nashville, Tennessee was responsible for the public whipping of Rev. Amos Dresser for the crime of distributing abolitionist publications (which he claimed he did not do). The names of all 62 members of the self-appointed vigilance committee were published by the American Anti-Slavery Society, annotating some as &quot;Elder in the Presbyterian Church&quot; and the like.
*Philadelphia Vigilance Committee, 1840s and 1850s: abolitionists who worked to subvert the Fugitive Slave Act and helped escaped enslaved people, including Henry Box Brown
*Jackson County, Indiana Vigilance Committee (a.k.a. the Scarlet Mask Society or Southern Indiana Vigilance Committee), 1868: captured and hanged ten members of the Reno Gang
*Know-Nothing Riot, 1850s, New Orleans, Louisiana
*San Francisco Committee of Vigilance, 1851 and 1856, San Francisco, California
*San Luis Obispo Vigilance Committee, 1850s, San Luis Obispo, California: known to have hanged six Californios and engaged in battles around the area
*3-7-77 Vigilance Committee, 1860s–1870s, Virginia City, Montana
*Anti Horse Thief Association, 1860s, Fort Scott, Kansas
*Baldknobbers, 1880s, Taney, Christian, and Greene Counties, Missouri
*Knights of Liberty, 1917–1918, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and California

==English vigilance committees==
*Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, 1888, London: founded to capture Jack the Ripper
*The Oxford Vigilance Committee was formed during World War I in Oxford, UK, a town whose own men of military age had gone to war and where soldiers were stationed. The Committee ran volunteer patrols of women to discourage, observe, and report on what was perceived as &quot;immoral&quot; behaviour of the town&#x27;s women. In November 1916, the Committee issued a report &quot;on the Moral Condition of Oxford&quot;, warning that the town&#x27;s streets were &quot;crowded with young girls, whose dress [and] behaviour show that they are deliberately laying themselves out to attract men&quot;. Their reports included detailed accounts of casual or adulterous sexual liaisons in the town. Births out of wedlock in Oxford decreased from 1914 to 1925, but the Committee attributed the reduction to &quot;forced marriages&quot; and abortions.

==Other vigilance committees==
*Biddulph Peace Society, 1876, Biddulph, Ontario, Canada
*Vigilance Committee of Gaelic Athletic Association: A committee tasked with identifying association members who either played or attended &quot;foreign games&quot; (predominantly soccer and rugby union) in contravention of the association&#x27;s rules. The rule was in place until 1971, up to which point many GAA players who also wished to play other sports had to resort to elaborate tactics, including the wearing of disguises, the use of false names, and travelling covertly (e.g. in the boot of a car) to attend matches.

== In film and media ==
* &quot;The Ox-Bow Incident&quot; (1943) is a movie directed by William A. Wellman, based on the novel of the same name written by Walter Van Tilburg Clark (1940). The story tells of a group of men pursuing cattle rustlers, capturing and hanging them, and the moral consequences.
* &quot;Ride in the Whirlwind&quot; (1966) is a movie, directed by Monte Hellman and written by Jack Nicholson, that tells the story of innocent men who are thought to be part of a gang on the run from members of a vigilance committee.

<doc id="997513" wikidata="Q7788380" url="?curid=997513" title="Thomas Cheney">
<text>Sir Thomas Cheney (or Cheyne) (c. 1485 – 16 December 1558) of the Blackfriars, City of London and Shurland, Isle of Sheppey, Kent, was an English administrator and diplomat, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in south-east England from 1536 until his death.

==Early life==
Thomas Cheney, born about 1485, was the son of William Cheney (d.1487) of Shurland Hall near Eastchurch, in the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, Constable of Queenborough Castle and Sheriff of Kent in 1477, by his second wife, Margaret Young.

Thomas Cheney&#x27;s father, William, was the eldest surviving of eight sons and a daughter, and at his death in 1487 his property in Kent was inherited by Francis Cheney (d.1512), his son and heir by his first marriage, but was in the possession of Francis Cheney&#x27;s uncle, John Cheyne, Baron Cheyne until the latter&#x27;s death without issue in 1499. Baron Cheyne&#x27;s heir, his brother, Robert Cheney, died without issue in 1503, at which time Francis Cheney &#x27;wrongfully took possession of their lands in Berkshire and Kent which should by an earlier settlement have passed to John, the son of a younger brother Roger&#x27;. Francis Cheney died without issue in January 1512, and Thomas Cheney succeeded to his father William&#x27;s lands; however the other properties wrongfully acquired by Francis Cheney were awarded in 1515 to his cousin, John son of Roger Cheyne (d. 1499) of West Woodhay, Berkshire.

==Career==

Cheney was appointed Sheriff of Kent in 1515, and was Justice of the Peace for Kent from 1526 until his death.

He was a favourite of Henry VIII&#x27;s mistress, Anne Boleyn to whom he was distantly related, and she fought Cardinal Wolsey for his promotion in 1528 and 1529. However, it was not until 1535–40 that Cheney consolidated his authority as one of the most powerful men in the south-east of England. From Henry VIII&#x27;s coming to the throne of England in 1509, Cheney served as Lord Warden, spanning the reigns of all five of the Tudor monarchs. Cheney was present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520, and served three times as an ambassador to France, under the authority of Henry VIII and Francois I of France, between 1549 and 1553. He was Treasurer of the Household from early 1530, and he is recorded as being present at over half of the Privy Council meetings held between 1540 and 1543.

He represented Kent as a knight of the shire in every parliament from 1539 to 1558 with the single exception of the election in 1555.

Cheney was among those councillors entrusted with the government of the realm during Somerset&#x27;s Scottish campaign of 1547. He was among those who sanctioned Gardiner&#x27;s imprisonment in June 1548, and he was involved in the interrogation of Sir Thomas Seymour in 1549.

In 1550, he became a privy counsellor and owner of the Manor of Ospringe (in the parish of Faversham).

==Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports==
As the Constable of Saltwood Castle (near Hythe), Queenborough Castle (in Sheppey), Rochester Castle and Dover Castle, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Lord Lieutenant of Kent (1551–3), Thomas Cheney was much &#x27;involved with musters and coastal defence&#x27;. Sir Thomas Cheyne was appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports on 17 May 1536 and appears to have been deprived of the office soon after Edward VI&#x27;s accession, but was granted it back to him the following April.

In April 1545 Cheney suffered a bout of illness, and was temporarily replaced in his duties as the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports by Sir Thomas Seymour, Hertford&#x27;s brother. For the next four months Cheney delegated his responsibilities in the Cinque Ports and Kent to Seymour.

==Reign of Mary I==
Cheney opposed the plan to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne, and although he acquiesced with Northumberland&#x27;s policy, he pledged his support for Mary I as soon as he felt it safe so to do. Mary sent him as ambassador to Charles V at Brussels in August 1553 to announce her accession to the throne. He was known by the title of his office as &quot;Lord Warden&quot;.

In January 1554, Cheney gathered a force in Kent to resist Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion. In London, there was a rumour that he held Dover Castle for the rebels. So fickle a courtier was he that the Marian Court privately distrusted his loyalty during the outbreak of the rebellion by his friend and neighbour Sir Thomas Wyatt, but the very fact that he sent men against Northumberland indicates something of his position. Cheney was initially distrusted by Mary, as she confessed to the imperial ambassador Simon Renard. His early show of support proved shrewd as Cheney retained his position as Treasurer of the Household whilst other household officers were replaced.

==Death==
Cheney died on 16 December 1558 at the Tower of London, and was buried on 3 January 1559 in St Katherine&#x27;s chapel of Minster Abbey on the Isle of Sheppey. He was survived by his son, Henry, and three daughters, Anne, Frances and Katherine. His will and the elaborate proceedings at his funeral were entirely consistent with the orthodox Catholicism of the period, showing him to have been conservative. In his will dated 6 December 1558, Cheney mentioned various properties which together gave him an annual rent of over £950, and after his death it was estimated that he maintained between 200 and 300 servants and retainers.

==Marriages and issue==
Cheney married firstly, by 1515, Frideswide Frowyk (died c. 1528), the daughter of Sir Thomas Frowyk, by whom he had a son and three daughters:

*John Cheney, who predeceased his father
*Anne Cheney (d. 1553), who married Sir John Perrot, Lord Deputy of Ireland
*Frances Cheney (d. 1561), who married Nicholas Crispe (d. 1564)
*Katherine Cheney (d. before 1550), who married Sir Thomas Kempe (d. 7 March 1591) of Olantigh in Wye, Kent, by whom she had three daughters, Margaret Kempe, who married William Cromer (d. 12 May 1598); Anne Kempe, who married Sir Thomas Shirley, and Alice Kempe, who married firstly Sir James Hales (d. 1589), grandson of Sir James Hales (d. 1554), and secondly Sir Richard Lee (d.1608), illegitimate half-brother of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s champion, Sir Henry Lee

According to Lennard, Anne, Frances and Katherine were all daughters of Cheney&#x27;s first marriage:

Sir Henry Cheyne, knight, summoned in 1572 as Lord Cheyne of Toddington, died s.p. in 1587, having wasted his estate. His three half-sisters, daughters of the first marriage of his father Sir Thomas Cheyne of Sheppey, K.G., were his coheirs. Anne Cheyne, the third of these, was the first wife of Sir John Perrot, the lord deputy of Ireland, and mother of Sir Thomas Perrot his heir. Sir John Perrot, who was reckoned a bastard son of Henry VIII., died in 1592.

Cheney married secondly, by dispensation dated 24 May 1539, Anne Broughton (d. 16 May 1562), stepdaughter and ward of John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, and daughter of Sir John Broughton (d. 24 January 1518). of Toddington, Bedfordshire, by Anne Sapcote (d. 14 March 1559), and granddaughter of Sir Robert Broughton by his first wife, Katherine de Vere, said to have been the illegitimate daughter of John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, by whom he had a son, Henry Cheyne, 1st Baron Cheyne of Toddington, and a daughter. There is a monument to Cheyney&#x27;s second wife at Toddington.

Cheney also had an illegitimate son and daughter.

<text>Kim Ki-hoon (born July 14, 1967) is a retired short-track speed skater and the first gold medalist in the Winter Olympics for South Korea. Kim is a three-time Olympic Champion and 1992 Overall World Champion.

==Career==
Kim first garnered attention when he participated in the short-track demonstration event at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, winning the gold medal in the 1500 metres.

Kim swept all the gold medals available in short-track speed skating at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, winning won the gold medal in the 1000 metres in a world record time of 1:30.76, and claiming another gold in the 5000 metre relay in a world record time of 7:14.02. Kim went on to win his first world overall champion at the 1992 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships in Denver. At the championships, Kim captured all five individual gold medals (overall, 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m, 3000 m), which made him become the second skater to sweep all five individual world championship gold medals available (Canada&#x27;s Sylvie Daigle first achieved the feat at the 1983 World Championships), and the first male one.

Kim Ki-hoon defended his gold medal at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, winning the 1000 metres with a time of 1:34.57.

==Post career==
In 2002, Kim was appointed as a coach of the Korean national short-track speed-skating team. He participated in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver as the head coach of the South Korean national team.

Kim Ki-hoon is known as the leader who helped Viktor An (Ahn Hyun-soo) to become a world-class player.

In addition, the Korean national team won two gold, four silver and two bronze medals at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, while he headed the team. However, in March 2010, the match-fixing between the two Olympic medalists, Lee Jung-su and Kwak Yoon-gy, and the deal for the right to participate in the Olympics and the World Championships became a big issue in the Korean society, and they received a three-years suspension from the Korea Sports Council after it was confirmed that it took place under the instructions and supervision of the coaches. The Korean Sport &amp; Olympic Committee did not pay Kim the reward that successfully led the Olympics at the time. In August 2012, Kim filed a lawsuit with the Korean Sport &amp; Olympic Committee and won a court lawsuit and was able to receive his Olympic reward three years later.

He was the head of the Gangneung Athletes&#x27; Village during the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.

Kim is currently serving as a full professor at Ulsan College.

<doc id="997518" wikidata="Q1234173" url="?curid=997518" title="Dodge Coronet">
<text>The Dodge Coronet is an automobile that was marketed by Dodge in seven generations, and shared nameplates with the same bodyshell with varying levels of equipment installed. Introduced as a full-size car in 1949, it was the division&#x27;s highest trim line and moved to the lowest level starting in 1955 through 1959. The name was reintroduced on intermediate-sized models from the 1965 until 1976 model years. Muscle car versions were available starting in 1965 with the 383 and 426 wedge cu in (7.0 L) Chrysler RB engine, followed in 1966 by the powerful 426 cu in (7.0 L) Chrysler Hemi. Other performance models included the &quot;Superbee&quot;, and featured, the 383 cu in (6.3 L) Magnum, among other engine options. The nameplate &quot;&quot; is a type of crown worn by royalty.

In the 1980s, the Coronet was used on Dodge models marketed in Colombia.

==First generation (1949–1952)==
The Dodge Coronet was introduced with the division&#x27;s first postwar body styles. Lower trim lines were the Wayfarer and Meadowbrook, with the Wayfarer being built on a shorter 115 inch wheelbase. The only engine for Dodge was a flat-head straight six cylinder engine with a single barrel Stromberg carburetor, producing (gross). The stock Dodge Coronet was a smooth-running car, and the six-cylinder engine could power the car to . A limited production model was a four-door, eight-passenger limousine, an extended version of the stock Dodge Coronet which was related to the DeSoto Suburban. One of the most notable features of the first-generation Coronet was Chrysler&#x27;s four forward-speed, a fluid-driven semi-automatic transmission that Dodge Division called Gyromatic. After using the clutch and gear shift to select the high range, upshifts and downshifts were operated by the accelerator pedal on the floor. The clutch did not need to be depressed in stop-and-go driving once underway. It had full instrumentation and 37 inches of head room both front and rear.

All Dodge vehicles received a facelift for 1950 but like the 1949 models were still divided into Wayfarer, Meadowbrook, and Coronet lines. The 1950 models can be identified easily by the new grille design which featured 3 heavy horizontal bars. The upper and lower bars formed a stylish oblong shape. Within this oblong grille was a thick center bar with parking lights on each end and a large chrome plaque in the center bearing the Dodge crest. The 8-passenger sedan&#x27;s length was .

Dodge received yet another facelift in 1951 but this time the cars remained virtually unchanged for two model years. Busy manufacturing military vehicles for use in Korea, they chose not to dedicate valuable resources to completely redesign civilian vehicles. Still divided into Wayfarer, Meadowbrook, and Coronet lines through 1952, by 1953 the Wayfarer line had been discontinued. The grille of the 1951 model was similar in shape to the 1950 grille, but with the elimination of the thick vertical center bar and the addition of six vents running horizontally between the top and center bars, a whole new look was achieved. The Coronet Diplomat was Dodge&#x27;s first hardtop coupe, featuring a pillarless steel roof styled after the contemporary Chrysler Newport. The speedometer was now circular, and the other four gauges were rectangles. For 1952 the Coronet had a painted lower grille louver.


==Second generation (1953–1954)==

For 1953, the Coronet was totally redesigned. It gained an optional &quot;Red Ram&quot; Hemi Engine and set over 100 land speed records at the Bonneville Salt Flats. The windshield finally became one-piece. Electric windshield wipers were standard, while the radio cost $83.

The Dodge Royal line was added above the Coronet in 1954. Dodge was putting more luxury into all of its models which included the Meadowbrook, Coronet and new Royal lines. Still, styling changes for 1954 were modest. The chrome molding on the hood lip was wider than on the 1953 models and a large chrome upright in the center of the grille replaced the five vertical dividers used previously. It still came with full instrumentation.
1954 saw Chrysler&#x27;s first fully automatic transmission, two-speed PowerFlite, offered as an extra-cost option on all Dodges.

==Third generation (1955–1956)==
The 1955 Coronet dropped to the lower end of the Dodge vehicle lineup, with the Wayfarer and Meadowbrook names no longer used and the Custom Royal added above the Royal, Lancer, and La Femme. Bodies were restyled with help from newly hired Virgil Exner to be lower, wider, and longer than the lumpy prewar style, which in turn generated a healthy boost in sales over 1954. Power came from either a Chrysler Flathead engine straight-6, now producing 
Two V8 engines were offered: Polyspheric (poly or semi-hemi) heads producing and a (the &quot;Hemi&quot;). Driven almost out of business in 1953 and 1954, the Chrysler Corporation was revived with a $250 million loan from Prudential and new models designed by Virgil Exner. The Dodge lineup was positioned as the mainstream line in Chrysler&#x27;s hierarchy, between DeSoto and Plymouth.

The Coronet (and Suburban station wagon) was the base model. This was the only line to feature the 230 in3 (3.8 L) &quot;Getaway&quot; I6 as well as the 270 in3 (4.4 L) &quot;Red Ram&quot; V8. Coronets were available in all body styles except the convertible. Sedans feature &quot;Coronet&quot; badges on the fenders, while the station wagons are called &quot;Suburban&quot;. Although the hardtop coupe was officially named &quot;Lancer&quot;, it wore only &quot;Coronet&quot; badges. Turn signals were standard on the Royal and Custom Royal models but optional on the base Coronet.

Power windows were added to the available options. Wheelbase was 120 inches. They were 212.1 inches long. The trim lines available:
*2- or 4-door station wagon — The Coronet wagon used the Suburban name and had the V8 or six
*hardtop coupé — The V8 Coronet Lancer
*2- or 4-door sedan — V8 or Six
*2-door sedan — V8 or Six
*4-door, eight-passenger limousine

1956 (&quot;See also: Plymouth Fury&quot;) was the last year of this body style before the change in 1957, the only differences offered in 1956 from the previous year were trim packages and the new Dodge D-500. The D-500 was the first Dodge factory high-performance production version as a tribute to the (D-500-1) &quot;Super Stock&quot; model. The only external clues were small crossed checkered flags and &quot;500&quot; lettering on its hood and lower rear deck. It was also available for order from the dealer on Coronet models, including station wagons and two-door sedans. The standard D-500 trim included a V8 with hemispherical heads (unlike other Dodge V8s (List of Chrysler engines) which used Polyspheric heads), a unique camshaft, valve lifters, pushrods, carburetor, ignition, and pistons. With a compression ratio of 9.25:1, four-barrel Carter WCFB carburetor, and dual-point distribution, peak horsepower was while torque was a solid . The D-500 also received an upgraded suspension with stiff front coil springs; heavy-duty Oriflow shock absorbers, with the same valving specified for Dodge police cars, were mounted in the springs. Similar units were used in the rear. The overall height of the D-500 was lower than its standard Dodge counterpart. The D-500 came standard with 15x5.5 inch wheels with 7.60x15 inch tubeless tires. New for safety were safety door locks.
The D-500-1 the first 500 made required by NASCAR, was intended for NASCAR competition. The D-500-1 had an even stiffer suspension than the D-500. Under the hood, the engine received larger valves (about 18% larger), a full-race camshaft, and a double log intake manifold that used two four-barrel Carter WCFB carburetors and a shaved deck for 8.25:1 compression. The meant it was the fastest car that year from the factory.

==Fourth generation (1957–1959)==
The 1957 model year debuted a new D-501, which replaced the D-500 from the year before as the top Coronet. The D-501 received Chrysler&#x27;s proven Hemi V8, which were actually leftover engines from the 1956 Chrysler 300B production. Camshafts from the 1957 Chrysler engines were installed in the V8s. A pair of Carter four-barrel carburetors fed the 10.0:1 compression ratio to produce , shared with the DeSoto Adventurer and the Chrysler 300C. Other changes included the addition of the Torsion-Aire Ride (torsion bar) front suspension and a heavy-duty suspension with heavy-duty shock absorbers and a heavy-duty leaf-sprung rear. A 3.73:1 rear axle was standard with the three-speed manual transmission and automatic cars included a 3.18:1 rear axle. There were 13 optional rear axles available, ranging from 2.92:1 through 6.17:1. The D-501 received 7.60x15 tires on 15x8-inch wheels. Brakes were diameter drums. Only 101 D-501s were produced. A padded dash was optional.

In the September 1957 issue of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, owners of both the Coronet six-cylinder and eight-cylinder were surveyed. Many (37.6% of I6 owners and 34.8% of V8 owners) complained that there were too many water leaks. When PM tested a V8 Coronet for water resistance, water got into the engine and pooled in &quot;two spark plug wells&quot; which had to be siphoned out before the engine could run with all cylinders again. However, many did like the exterior styling and the ride comfort. Acceleration from 0-60 mph on 90 octane gasoline was 12.3 seconds.

The 1958 and 1959 Coronet, Royal, and Custom Royal used a DeSoto Fireflite chassis but had less ornate trim. Power came from the &quot;Getaway&quot; L-head straight-6 or the &quot;Red Ram&quot; V8. In 1959 a Silver Challenger model was also offered on the Coronet line. This was a six-cylinder or V-8 model available only in silver paint and only on a two-door body. It came with many extra features at no cost, such as wall-to-wall deep pile carpeting, premium white wall tires and wheel covers, luxury fabrics and upgraded interior and electric windshield wipers. The overall length was increased to 217.4 inches.

A Dodge Coronet was the only known example of the JATO Rocket Car legend. To publicize Dodge&#x27;s &#x27;total contact&#x27; front dual-leading shoe drum brakes a JATO unit was fitted to a 1958 Coronet and driven at speed across the El Mirage dry lake. A TV advertisement was broadcast during Dodge-sponsored Lawrence Welk Show.

===1959 Dodge Silver Challenger===
The first car that carried the Challenger name was introduced as the limited edition &quot;Dodge Silver Challenger&quot; Club Sedan, an addition to the 1959 full-sized Dodge Coronet model line. and was related to the Dodge Matador.

The Silver Challenger came only in silver paint and exclusively on Chrysler&#x27;s long two-door, on a wheelbase. It was available with either the &quot;Getaway&quot; L-head straight-six engine for $2,297 ($ in dollars ), or the &quot;Red Ram&quot; V8 for $2,408 ($ in dollars ). This car was marketed for the spring selling season to &quot;new-car buyers who&#x27;ve been waiting to get the most for the least.&quot; A column-shifted three-speed manual transmission was standard and an automatic was optional.

The 1959 Silver Challenger was marketed with extra features at no extra cost. These included premium white wall tires, full wheel covers, electric windshield wipers, as well as an upgraded interior with silver metallic vinyl and black &quot;Manchu&quot; fabric upholstery, dual arm rests and sun visors, as well as deep pile wall-to-wall carpeting.

==Fifth generation (1965–1970)==
===1965–1967===
The Coronet reappeared for the 1965 model year as the intermediate-sized B-body using a 117-inch wheelbase, continuing what had been the Dodge Polara, which was once again full-size. For 1965, Dodge sold slightly over 209,000 units, making the Coronet the most popular model sold by Dodge that year. Trim levels initially were base Coronet including a Deluxe version, Coronet 440, and Coronet 500.

The base Coronet and Deluxe were available as two-door sedans, four-door sedans, and station wagons. For 1965 only, Dodge also sold 101 units of a modified wheelbase version of the base Coronet two-door sedans and 440 hardtops specifically for NHRA drag racing. 

The model known as A990 came with a racing version of the Hemi engine. The car A990 was stripped of all features and included lightweight base bucket seats from Dodge&#x27;s A100 truck/van line of vehicles. 

Most were built as standard wheelbase, however there were 2 Dodge &amp; Ply 2% AWB 1965 A990 2dr sedans - and 13 Factory 10+% AWB acid dipped bodies and fiberglass noses &amp; doors. These were supplied with 1965 Dodge &amp; Ply H/T A990 drivelines.

These altered wheelbase vehicles eventually became popularly known as &quot;funny cars&quot; due to their unique wheel spacing.

The front and rear axles were moved forward significantly from the stock location, putting the front wheels directly behind the front fender, and the rear wheels almost under where the rear seat would normally go; this alteration transferred weight to the rear tires, increasing traction on launch. Front seat belts and padded dash were standard.

The middle of the Coronet line-up was the 440 which was available as a two-door hardtop, convertible, or station wagon. The 440 designation did not indicate engine displacement as commonly assumed (both then and now, which helped sales to an extent). The nomenclature was a carryover theme from the 1963–64 Polara series.
The top of the Coronet line-up was the Coronet 500 which was available as a two-door hardtop or convertible in 1965. Slightly over 33,300 units were sold in 1965 and included as standard, a V8 engine (273 cubic inches), exterior trim and badging, bucket seats, padded dash, and chrome floor console.

Coronets were manufactured at Chrysler&#x27;s Los Angeles assembly plant and at the Lynch Road assembly plant in Detroit and ST. Louis plant in Missouri. Engines offered for 1965 included the base 225 Slant-Six, 273, 318 (Polyhead), 361 (the last year for this big block engine was 1966), 383, and 426 in multiple HP choices ( the 383 came in a special version rated at 330 HP). Sales brochures list the 413 (its last year offered) as available, but no records exist of this engine, commonly used in Imperials, being installed in Coronets for 1965. A tachometer was optional.

In 1966 a four-door Coronet 500 was added, called the Coronet 500 SE (Special Edition). It had special &quot;SE&quot; logos on the C-pillars and on the seatback. There would be no Coronet 500 wagon until 1968. Coronet received a redesign in 1966, and a facelift in 1967. Trim levels initially were base Coronet, Coronet 440, and Coronet 500. In 1966, the Coronet Deluxe was introduced, fitting between the base Coronet and the Coronet 440. The Coronet R/T was introduced in 1967.

The Coronet R/T was available as a two-door hardtop or convertible. The standard engine was Chrysler&#x27;s largest, the V8 producing 375 bhp and dubbed the Magnum. The only engine option was the 426-cid Hemi, now in its second year in &quot;Street&quot; trim and again rated at 425 bhp. It was a $908 option. Transmission choices were Mopar&#x27;s excellent heavy-duty three-speed TorqueFlite automatic or a four-speed manual.

When the 426ci Hemi was made available to the general public for the 1966 model year, it could be ordered in any Coronet model or trim level. No Hemi-powered Coronet wagons have been verified, but a few Coronet Deluxe four-door sedans are known to exist. A total of 136 Coronet 500 Street Hemis were built for 1966. Beginning in 1967, Chrysler decided that the Hemi should be available only in their badged muscle cars: the Dodge Charger, Coronet R/T, and the Plymouth Belvedere GTX. The top engine option for the rest of the Coronet line was supposed to be the 383-ci, 4-barrel V8. Despite this, some Hemi-powered 1967 Coronet Deluxe two-door sedans were produced. There is also one Hemi-powered 1967 Coronet 440 two-door hardtop known, and One Hemi-powered 1967 Coronet 500 two-door hardtop known, which is not among the 55 WO23 Super Stock cars produced for Dodge drag racers.

===1968–1970===
The Coronet and similar Plymouth Belvedere received complete redesigns in 1968, as did the Dodge Charger, which shared the B-body platform. There was a mild facelift in 1970. Trim levels initially included the base Coronet, Coronet Deluxe, Coronet 440, Coronet 500, and Coronet R/T. The Coronet Super Bee was introduced in early 1968 as a companion to the Plymouth Road Runner. In keeping with Dodge&#x27;s position as a step above Plymouth, the Super Bee shared the Charger&#x27;s Rallye instrument cluster and the Coronet 440&#x27;s rear finish panel.

As in 1967, the 440ci RB V8 was only available in the Coronet R/T in 1968. The 426ci Hemi V8 was supposed to be limited to the R/T and Super Bee, but two 1968 Coronet 440s are known to have been built with this engine.

In mid-1969, the A12 package was introduced on the Super Bee. It included a version of the 440 with three 2bbl Holley carburetors on an aluminum intake manifold, a black fiberglass lift-off hood secured with metal pins, heavy-duty suspension, and 15-inch steel wheels with no hubcaps or wheel covers. The hood had an integrated forward-facing scoop which sealed to the air cleaner assembly and bore a decal on each side with the words &quot;SIX PACK&quot; in red letters, &quot;Six Pack&quot; being the name used for the 6-bbl induction setup when installed on a Dodge (Plymouth went with &quot;440 6bbl&quot; on the A12 Road Runners). The A12 Super Bee could be had with most Super Bee options, with the exception of air conditioning and tire-wheel packages. The A12 option was a 1969-only package, but the 440 6bbl returned in 1970 as an optional engine on the Super Bee. This engine option was exclusive to the Super Bee and not available on any other Coronet.

The base Coronet and Deluxe were available as 2-door coupes, 4-door sedans, or station wagons. The base Coronet was dropped in 1969, leaving the Deluxe as the lowest trim level through 1970. The Coronet 440 convertible was dropped for 1968, but a 2-door coupe was added along with the 2-door hardtop, 4-door sedan, and station wagon. This would remain the lineup through 1970. Coronet 500 retained its 2-door hardtop, convertible, and 4-door sedan through 1970. A Coronet 500 station wagon made its debut in 1968, continuing through 1970. Simulated woodgrain trim was standard on the Coronet 500 wagon.

The Coronet R/T 2-door hardtop and convertible continued through 1970.

The Super Bee was available as a 2-door coupe or 2-door hardtop. Chrysler displayed a convertible with Super Bee stripes at car shows in 1968, but never offered it as a production model.

The Dodge Super Bee was a limited-production muscle car from 1968 through 1971. The original Super Bee was based on the Dodge Coronet, a 2-door model, and was produced from 1968 until 1970. It was Dodge&#x27;s low-priced muscle car, the equivalent to Plymouth Road Runner, and was priced at $3,027. Available with the Hemi engine, this option increased the price by 33% thus 125 models were sold with this engine option. The Super Bee included a heavy-duty suspension, an optional Mopar A-833 four-speed manual transmission, high-performance tires, and a stripe (with the bee logo) wrapped around the tail. The name &quot;Super Bee&quot; was derived from the &quot;B&quot; Body designation given Chrysler&#x27;s mid-size cars which included the Coronet.

A “six-pack” (three two-barrel carburetors) version of the 440 engine was added to the list mid-year. This engine was between the standard engine and the Hemi as a $463 option. The 1969 model year included the base 383 hp (high performance) with the 440 six-pack and 426 Hemi optional. The 440 Magnum (4-bbl) was not available in the Coronet R/T.

In 1970, the Super Bee was given a different front-end look that consisted of a dual oval-shaped grill that was referred to as “bumble bee wings”. Engines, as well as the &quot;ramcharger&quot; hood (that carried over from the 1969 model). Sales fell for the 1970 model. In 1970, four Super Bee convertibles were built.


==Sixth generation (1971–1974)==
The new Coronet was a twin of the four-door Plymouth Satellite and featured more flowing styling. It was offered as a sedan and wagon, the related and also restyled Dodge Charger covering the coupe market. Slight alterations of the front grille, headlights, and taillights followed in 1972. Sales of the Coronet were low from this point onwards, with around 80–90,000 produced each year through 1973 (compared with 196,242 as recently as 1968), due both to the fuel crisis and to a proliferation of Dodge and Plymouth models, and the growing effect of overlap with the other Chrysler Corporation brands. In addition to the usual changes to the grille, lights, and interior, Dodge introduced in 1973 to mid-size models its &quot;TorsionQuiet&quot; system of additional silencers and rubber vibration insulators, providing a much smoother ride and a quieter interior.

The front and rear fascias were redesigned, most notably the rear bumper, which met the 1974 DOT requirements. The sedan body style would be the basis of the later Coronets (and its twin, the Plymouth Fury) until the 1978 model year.

==Seventh generation (1975–1976)==
===1975===

For 1975 the Coronet received a refreshed squarer-appearing body as well as a new front fascia with two round dual-beam headlights shared with its Plymouth Fury stablemate. After a four model year absence, a Dodge Coronet 2-door returned for 1975.

===1976===
1976 was the final model year for the Dodge Coronet and its body style choices were reduced to four-door wagon and four-door sedan. The former Dodge Coronet 2-door model was replaced by the Dodge Charger Sport for the 1976 model year.

For the 1977 model year, the mid-size Dodge Coronet was renamed Monaco, and the full-size Dodge Monaco was renamed Royal Monaco.

==Coronet in Colombia==
Coronet was used as the model name for the Colombian market Dodge Diplomat during the 1980s.

<text>Heather Leigh Whitestone McCallum (born February 24, 1973) is an American conservative activist and beauty queen who was the first deaf Miss America title holder, having lost most of her hearing at 18 months.

==Early life and education==
Whitestone was born in Dothan, Alabama, to Bill Whitestone and Daphne Gray. When she was 18 months old, she lost her hearing due to a serious ear infection. In fourth grade, she learned about the story of Helen Keller, who would forever change her life. Keller became her role model. She was unable to keep up with her classwork and began to fall behind her peers. She asked her family to send her to a special school that would enable her to catch up with other students in her class. While at the Central Institute for the Deaf in St. Louis, Missouri, she learned two grade levels per year. After three years, she caught up with her peers and returned to Alabama to graduate from public high school with a 3.6-grade point average (GPA).
Whitestone moved to Birmingham at age sixteen, following her parents&#x27; divorce. She attended the Alabama School of Fine Arts for a year and graduated from Berry High School (now Hoover High School) in 1991. Her passion was ballet, and she had spent most of her time developing her ballet skills, especially after hearing loss. She then went on to study at Jacksonville State University.

==Pageant record==
Whitestone first participated in the Shelby County Junior Miss program. While not actually a beauty pageant, the experience gave her the confidence to begin entering pageants. Her first year in the Miss America system, she won the Miss Jacksonville State University title, and went on to be Miss Alabama. She stood next to Miss Virginia (Cullen Johnson) in the finals of the Miss America 1995 pageant. When the first runner-up was announced, she could not hear the host, Regis Philbin, but could read his lips. Surprised, she looked to her fellow contestant for confirmation that she had won.

As Miss America, Whitestone showcased her S.T.A.R.S. program around the country. S.T.A.R.S. stands for &quot;Success Through Action and Realization of your dreams&quot;. It has five points: positive attitude, belief in a dream, the willingness to work hard, facing obstacles, and building a strong support team.

Whitestone also served as an executive member on the President&#x27;s Committee on Employment of People Disabilities. She has written four books.

==After Miss America==

Since her Miss America win, Whitestone has completed her studies at Jacksonville State University and continued to promote awareness of deaf issues. She has also spoken out in detail about her close relationship with God, one that she has had ever since she rediscovered church as a teenager. She wrote about her life experiences in her third book, &quot;Let God Surprise You: Trust God with Your Dreams&quot;.

A volunteer for Republican causes, she spoke at the party&#x27;s National Conventions of 1996 and 2000, for GOP presidential nominees Bob Dole and George W. Bush.

In 2002, Whitestone elected to have a cochlear implant operation in order to hear to an extent in her right ear, the hearing of which she had lost at 18 months. It was implanted by Dr. John Niparko on August 6 at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and activated on September 19. She said the primary motivation for electing the surgery was an incident when she did not hear her son&#x27;s cries for help. She said that she had not regretted her decision, thanking her family for supporting her.

Whitestone is a motivational speaker and lives in Georgia with her husband, John McCallum, whom she met when he served as a Congressional aide to Speaker Newt Gingrich. They have four children named John Jr., James, Wilson, and William.
Whitestone was appointed by President Bush and confirmed by the US Senate to the National Council on Disability, but she resigned in 2010. She was also a board member of the Helen Keller Foundation for Research and Education from 1995 to 2002.

Whitestone was appointed to the Advisory Council for the National Institutes of Health on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, in 2002.

Whitestone has appeared on CNN, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;The View&quot;. She has also been in print articles for &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;People Magazine&quot;.

In 2003, Whitestone filmed two public service announcements to bring awareness about &quot;Dogs for the Deaf&quot;, which is a hearing-dog organization.

Whitestone became a spokesperson for the Starkey Hearing Aid Foundation and Cochlear America.

Whitestone has written four books called &quot;Listening with My Heart&quot;, &quot;Believing in the Promise&quot;, &quot;Let God Surprise You&quot;, and &quot;Heavenly Crowns&quot;. She has also spearheaded the nation&#x27;s largest multimedia public service campaign to identify early hearing loss, which was created by the Miss America Organization and the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf.

<text>Hawk Nelson was a Canadian Christian pop-punk band from Peterborough, Ontario. Formed in 2000, the band has released eight studio albums. Bassist/backing vocalist Daniel Biro was the band&#x27;s only founding member to remain throughout their entire history.

==History==
===Early independent releases (2000–2003)===
In 2000, Dunn, Clark, and Paige founded a Peterborough-based group called &quot;SWISH&quot;, while Biro sang lead vocals for a four-piece group called the &quot;Cheese Monkeys from Planet Nine&quot; from Barrie, Ontario. In 2000, SWISH released their first independent album, &quot;Riding Around the Park&quot; on Mime Radio, an independent record label based in Peterborough. In January 2002, Biro moved to Peterborough to join Dunn, Clark and Paige and SWISH was renamed &quot;Reason Being&quot;, before finally settling with the name &quot;Hawk Nelson&quot;. In 2003, they released their second independent album, &quot;Saturday Rock Action&quot;.

===&quot;Letters to the President&quot; (2004–2005)===
They continued to perform and tour independently in Ontario, Canada, before being signed with Tooth &amp; Nail Records, largely on the recommendation of Trevor McNevan, the lead singer of fellow Tooth &amp; Nail bands Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static. McNevan, also from Peterborough, Ontario, is credited with discovering the band. In July 2004, Hawk Nelson released their debut album &quot;Letters to the President&quot;. It was produced by Aaron Sprinkle and McNevan, who also co-wrote the album&#x27;s fourteen songs. He has also appeared on some of the band&#x27;s songs, as well as in their video for the song &quot;California&quot;.

Popular with Christian rock fans, the band has achieved some success in the mainstream as well. They portrayed The Who on an episode of the NBC drama &quot;American Dreams&quot;, and they recorded a song named &quot;Bring &#x27;Em Out&quot; as the theme for the 2005 motion picture &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot; featuring Drake Bell. This song and another hit song &quot;The Show&quot; were both used on Sunday Night Football commercials. &quot;Things We Go Through&quot; from &quot;Letters to the President&quot; was also featured in &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot;. In October 2005, the band re-released &quot;Letters to the President&quot;, with new material including their cover of The Who&#x27;s &quot;My Generation&quot;, three acoustic versions of some of their hits, and a limited edition cover. Hawk Nelson plays the party band for the film &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot; (2005). On December 20, 2005, Hawk Nelson released an extended play titled &quot;Bring &#x27;Em Out&quot;.

===&quot;Smile, It&#x27;s the End of the World&quot; (2006–2007)===
Hawk Nelson continued to gain popularity and was voted &quot;Favorite New Artist&quot; by &quot;CCM Magazine&quot; in their February 2006 Reader&#x27;s Choice Awards.

On April 4, 2006, Hawk Nelson released &quot;Connect Sets&quot; with six acoustic tracks, including &quot;Bring Em&#x27; Out&quot;, &quot;Thing We Go Through&quot;, and &quot;California&quot;.

The band released their second studio album, &quot;Smile, It&#x27;s the End of the World&quot;, on April 4, 2006. The album was also co-written by Trevor McNevan of Thousand Foot Krutch. The album won a GMA Canada Covenant Award for &quot;Modern Rock/Alternative Album of the Year&quot; in 2006. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Everything You Ever Wanted&quot;, went on to hit No. 1 for 9 weeks on the &quot;R&amp;R&quot; Christian CHR chart, and was the fourth most-played song of 2006. The band spent the middle of 2006 touring the major Christian music festivals, and also took part in Jeremy Camp&#x27;s &quot;Beyond Measure&quot; tour. Hawk Nelson released a three-track Christmas extended play titled &quot;Gloria&quot; on November 21, 2006, and then toured with TobyMac&#x27;s Winter Wonder Slam tour along with The Afters, Family Force 5, and Ayiesha Woods.

Bulletproof Records and producer Ralph Sall have assembled the compilation &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web: Music Inspired By The Motion Picture&quot; featuring music by Christian artists including Hawk Nelson, Amy Grant, Selah, and Billy Ray Cyrus, which was released December 12, 2006. In addition, Bob Carlisle, Leigh Nash (Sixpence None The Richer), and The Send have all contributed exclusive tracks.

Hawk Nelson performed in 2006 on the Fringe Stage at Creation Festival Northwest, then again on the main stage at Creation in 2007. They performed sometime between July 25–28, 2007, at Creation Festival Northwest on the Main Stage, and they played again on the Fringe Stage at Creation Festival Northeast sometime between June 27–30, 2007. In 2007, (and again in 2009), Hawk Nelson performed at Winter Jam with a variety of other Christian bands, including Newsong, Jeremy Camp, Steven Curtis Chapman, Sanctus Real, and Britt Nicole. Hawk Nelson also toured with MxPx, Run Kid Run, Project 86, The Fold, and The Classic Crime on the Tooth and Nail Tour.

On March 27, 2007, Hawk Nelson released a &quot;Double Take&quot; which includes selections from &quot;Letters to the President&quot; and &quot;Smile It&#x27;s the End of the World&quot;. They then released a holiday-themed extended play titled &quot;Holiday Trio&quot; on November 20, 2007.

In 2007, Aaron Tosti left the band to pursue other musical ventures and was replaced by Justin Benner.

===&quot;Hawk Nelson Is My Friend&quot; and &quot;Live Life Loud&quot; (2008–2010)===

The band&#x27;s third full album, &quot;Hawk Nelson Is My Friend&quot; was released on April 1, 2008, and featured songs co-written by Trevor McNevan of Thousand Foot Krutch, Raine Maida of Our Lady Peace and Richard Marx.

In 2008, the band also contributed a cover of &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot;, originally by Simple Minds, off the &quot;Don&#x27;t You Forget About Me: The Covers&quot;. The song was also featured in back-to-school commercials for J.C. Penney. On June 8, 2010, &quot;Hawkology: Anothology of Hawk Nelson&quot; was released containing three previously released albums: &quot;Letters to the President&quot;, &quot;Smile, It&#x27;s the End of the World&quot;, and &quot;Hawk Nelson Is My Friend&quot;. On June 16, 2009, &quot;Summer&quot; was released through digital outlets only.

In January 2008, the band headlined their own tour that they called &quot;The Green T Tour&quot; which also featured Capital Lights and Run Kid Run.

Hawk Nelson was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award in the category for Best Recording Package, for their 2008 album &quot;Hawk Nelson Is My Friend&quot;.

On July 21, 2009, Hawk Nelson released their second single from their fourth album &quot;Live Life Loud&quot; called &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;, and on August 8, the song &quot;Alive&quot; began to be played on Christian Radio. They released their fourth album, &quot;Live Life Loud&quot; on September 22, 2009. The title song &quot;Live Life Loud&quot; was made available in the Rock Band store during the first week of April 2010. The song &quot;Live Life Loud&quot; was featured in the trailer for the movie, &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid 2: Rodrick Rules&quot;.

===&quot;Crazy Love&quot; and departure of Jason Dunn (2011–2012)===
On February 8, 2011, Hawk Nelson released their fifth studio album titled &quot;Crazy Love&quot;, which was bundled together with a new acoustic extended play titled &quot;The Light Sides&quot;.

Hawk Nelson released another Christmas extended play, titled &quot;Christmas&quot; on November 1, 2011, and it included the songs &quot;Hark the Herald Angels Sing&quot;, &quot;The Wassail Song&quot;, and &quot;Up on the Housetop&quot;. On March 27, 2012, Hawk Nelson released a compilation album titled &quot;The Songs You&#x27;ve Already Heard: Best of Hawk Nelson&quot;.

On February 1, 2012, lead vocalist Jason Dunn announced he would be leaving the band in order to pursue his solo project, Lights Go Down, recording an album tentatively titled &quot;Abandon Progress&quot;. On March 11, 2012, in Fresno, California, Dunn performed his final US show with Hawk Nelson.

Following Dunn&#x27;s departure, guitarist Jonathan Steingard took over as lead vocalist and bassist Daniel Biro became the last remaining original member of the band.

=== Post-Dunn releases, Steingard&#x27;s departure and possible break-up (2012–2020) ===

After Dunn&#x27;s departure from the band, Steingard replacing him on vocals marked a shift in the band&#x27;s genre from fast-paced pop punk to softer, contemporary alternative and pop rock. On December 11, 2012, Hawk Nelson announced they had signed with Fair Trade Services. &quot;Made&quot; was released on April 2, 2013. The album&#x27;s release was preceded by the release of the album&#x27;s debut single on January 15, 2013, &quot;Words&quot;, featuring Bart Millard of MercyMe, which reached No. 1 on the Christian Hot AC/CHR charts.

On December 10, 2014, Hawk Nelson released the first single off an upcoming album, &quot;Drops In the Ocean&quot; via YouTube and made available on iTunes January 13. The album, &quot;Diamonds&quot; was announced on January 21. &quot;Diamonds&quot; is Jonathan Steingard&#x27;s second album as lead vocalist for the band and first for guitarist Micah Kuiper and drummer David Niacaris. &quot;Just Getting Started&quot;, another song from &quot;Diamonds&quot;, was heard in several &quot;American Idol&quot; promo spots ahead of the album&#x27;s release. The album was released on iTunes and other major music websites on March 17, 2015.

On December 15, 2017, the band released the single, &quot;He Still Does (Miracles)&quot;, as part of a new album, &quot;Miracles&quot;, which was released April 6, 2018, through Fair Trade Services.

In May 2020, Steingard announced on his Instagram page that he had lost his faith in God and was no longer a Christian. In response, Daniel Biro made a post on the band&#x27;s official Instagram page the following day thanking his bandmates and expressed continued support for them on and off the road.

<text>Thomas Kelsey (died c. 1680) rose from obscurity as a &quot;London tradesman&quot; to become an important figure in the government of Oliver Cromwell.

Kelsey enlisted in the New Model Army and fought on the side of Parliament during the English Civil War, displaying a zeal that led him to become a major-general in 1645. He became a lieutenant-colonel in Colonel Ingoldsby&#x27;s regiment from 1646. After the war he was elected as Deputy-Governor of Oxford, and in 1651 he was further appointed a lieutenant of Dover Castle.

As a member of the &#x27;fifth Monarchist congregation&#x27; in London, led by John Simpson, during the early 1650s, he supported Oliver Cromwell in the establishment of the Protectorate and was elected MP for Sandwich in Kent for the First Protectorate Parliament, and was appointed the Major-General for Surrey and Kent during the Rule of the Major-Generals.

Thomas Kelsey was returned for Dover during the Second Protectorate Parliament, when he supported John Desborough&#x27;s move to establish the Major-Generals as a permanent form of government.

After the collapse of the Protectorate in 1659, Thomas Kelsey supported John Lambert&#x27;s attempts to resist the Restoration. Major-General Kelsey was deprived of his commands under the recalled Rump Parliament (Jan 1660), and was ordered to leave London. With the return of King Charles II in May 1660, Kelsey felt safer removing himself to the Netherlands, but with others including John Desborough was instructed to return to England in 1666.

Thereafter little more is known of his life, except that it has been suggested he turned his skills to becoming a brewer, and that he died around 1680.

<doc id="997534" wikidata="Q1234275" url="?curid=997534" title="Dodge Mirada">
<text>The Dodge Mirada is a mid-sized, rear-wheel drive coupe manufactured and marketed by Dodge for the model years 1980 to 1983, sharing the Chrysler J platform along with its badge engineered variants, the second generation Chrysler Cordoba and the Imperial. Production of the Mirada reached just under 53,000 units, staying relatively unchanged during its four-year run, with the exception of paint colors and engines. The Mirada was marketed as a sporty personal luxury car with limited advertising and marketing during a period when Chrysler was in deep financial difficulty.
==Design==
To help Chrysler meet the ever stricter Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, the Mirada/Cordoba were downsized considerably from their predecessors, with the new models sitting on a modified version of the Dodge Aspen/Plymouth Volaré&#x27;s platform. The Mirada was designed after the Cordoba&#x27;s design was locked in, with various changes made to distinguish it and make it more sporting. Chief designer Ernie Barry had to include the landau roof even though the design team would have preferred not to, as such &quot;classic&quot; features were favored by Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca. The front end was from flexible plastic, with a grille design inspired by the &quot;coffin-nosed&quot; Cord 810/812.

==Trims and options==
The base models all received a basic metal roof with a chrome beauty strip extending from the bottom of the opera windows and across the roof. A power sunroof, or a glass T-top roof, were both offered as options for a sportier look; while a vinyl landau roof, or a &quot;cabriolet roof&quot;, which was basically a mock convertible top with a blocked out quarter window, were both offered for a more luxurious look. The T-tops and landau were offered every year except for 1983, and the cabriolet top was offered every year. A power sunroof was offered for 1980 and 1981.

Base models came with 15” steel wheels with turbine-like hubcaps, or polished ten-spoke, 15” aluminum wheels with painted sections and bright chrome center caps.

The Mirada was offered in the following trims:

*Base
*S (also referred to as &quot;SE&quot;)
*CMX

===Interior===

The Mirada came standard with a brushed aluminum finish on the instrumental panel, with faux woodgrain finish offered as an option. The base seats were cloth Sport bucket seats, while optional seats included vinyl Sport bucket seats, cloth and vinyl 60/40 split bench seats, and leather and vinyl bucket seats. Since the Mirada could be chosen with either a column shift or floor shift, the bench seat was only offered with the column shifter. Buyers had the choice of either an AM/FM stereo or an AM/FM/cassette stereo, an AM/FM/8-track stereo, and a Chrysler CB radio could be chosen as well. Available steering wheels included two iterations of base 2-spoke wheels, an optional 3-spoke Mopar &quot;Tuff Wheel&quot; and an optional 4-spoke sport wheel. Manual windows were standard on the base model, but the power windows from the CMX could be ordered on the base models as well.

Production Figures:
==Powertrain==
The 3.7 L inline slant-6 engine was available in the base Mirada, with the 5.2 L V8 offered as optional, and the code E58 360 5.9 L V8 available in the Mirada CMX, though only in 1980. For unexplained reasons the 360 was not available in any Chrysler automobiles from 1981 and on. All of these engines were mated to the A904 automatic transmission except the 360 (5.9L), which received the stronger A727. With the 185-horsepower 360, it was one of the fastest American cars available in 1980, on par with the Chevrolet Corvette.

==Suspension==
The suspension of the Mirada utilized transverse torsion bars in the front and leaf springs with a sway bar in the rear. A &quot;sport handling package&quot; was offered, which included heavy-duty shock absorbers, torsion bar bushings, springs, as well as anti-sway bars in both the front and rear. The braking system used power assisted disc brakes in the front and drum brakes in the rear.

==NASCAR==

It was hoped that the Mirada would reopen the door to Dodge success in NASCAR racing, as the nameplate had not won a race since November 1977. Lee Iacocca personally called Richard Petty, a longtime Dodge driver, in late October 1980 and asked him to build and test a race spec Mirada, saying Chrysler would supply Petty Enterprises the necessary body sheetmetal and engine parts Petty would need to build and campaign the car. Petty, who had left Dodge for General Motors in 1978, agreed, and had his team immediately set about and built a Mirada-based race-car. A few other teams including Junior Johnson&#x27;s team built race-spec Miradas to test. Johnson&#x27;s team would have been a major coup for Dodge, as they had been running GM cars since the team&#x27;s inception and the team had just signed Darrell Waltrip away from DiGard Motorsports to drive for them (Waltrip having won 22 races in GM cars prior to this).

After their car was built, the Petty team thought the Mirada looked like a great race car, and some initial testing pleased the longtime Dodge driver. A January 17, 1981, test session at Daytona Speedway where around 15,000 Petty fans showed up to watch. However the Mirada was slower than the GM and Ford cars of the day. This testing of the car, as well as the Junior Johnson team&#x27;s testing, revealed that while it looked fairly aerodynamic, the bodystyle actually had a very high coefficient of drag that made it incapable of speeds over 185 mph. The Petty team removed the Mirada sheet metal (passing it to Buddy Arrington) and, like the Johnson team, elected to build GM G platform bodied racecars (as shared by the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Buick Regal), and this put an end to Chrysler&#x27;s attempt to re-establish itself in NASCAR. 

However, two small and independent racing teams, Arrington Racing (which was using secondhand rebadged Petty Dodges) and Negre Racing, decided to make a go of the car and campaigned it during the 1981 to 1984 racing seasons. Arrington managed 17 top-ten finishes during those years, though all were on short (1 mile or less) length tracks. A few other drivers (Dave Marcis in four races, and Dick May in three) ran Miradas occasionally in 1981, but the cars were either plagued with mechanical issues, or finished several laps off the leaders. Up until the end of 1984, Miradas raced from time to time, but without much success, and ultimately led to Dodge disappearing from NASCAR until 2001.

<text>The J platform was a designation used for two automobile platforms from Chrysler Corporation in the 1980s.

The first was a rear-wheel drive platform, in production from 1980. It was very similar to the 4-door Chrysler F platform and Chrysler M platform.

The J platform was only used for coupés between 1980 and 1983:
* 1980–1983 Chrysler Cordoba
* 1980–1983 Dodge Mirada
* 1981–1983 Chrysler Imperial.

A second, unrelated, AJ platform was a variant of the front-wheel drive K platform produced between 1987 and 1995, which made its debut with the introduction of the newly redesigned Chrysler LeBaron coupe and convertible.

<doc id="997557" wikidata="Q611694" url="?curid=997557" title="Master of Architecture">
<text>The Master of Architecture (M.Arch or MArch) is a professional degree in architecture qualifying the graduate to move through the various stages of professional accreditation (internship, exams) that result in receiving a license.

==Overview==
The degree is earned through several possible paths of study, depending on both a particular program&#x27;s construction, and the candidate&#x27;s previous academic experience and degrees. M.Arch degrees vary in kind, so they are frequently given names such as &quot;M.Arch I&quot; and &quot;M.Arch II&quot; to distinguish them. All M.Arch degrees are professional degrees in architecture. There are, however, other master&#x27;s degrees offered by architecture schools that are not accredited in any way.

Many schools offer several possible tracks of architectural education. Including study at the bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s level, these tracks range up to 7.5 years in duration.

* One possible route is what is commonly referred to as the &quot;4+2&quot; course. This path entails completing a four-year, accredited, pre-professional Bachelor of Arts in architecture or a Bachelor of Science in architecture. This degree is not 3-year, depending on the nature and quality of your undergraduate study performance, and the evaluation of your master&#x27;s degree program school of your undergraduate study) Master of Architecture program. This route offers several advantages: your first four years are a bit more loose, allowing the inclusion of some liberal arts study; you can attend two different institutions for your undergraduate and graduate study, which is helpful in that it allows you to have a more varied architectural education, and you can pick the best place for you to complete your thesis (because chances are, you might not pick the program that has the exact focus that you will want when it becomes time for your thesis study); and you will finish the 4+2 course of study with a master&#x27;s degree that will provide you the career option of teaching architecture at the collegiate level.
* The second route to obtaining an accredited master&#x27;s degree begins in graduate school, with a 3 or 3.5-year master&#x27;s degree (commonly called an &quot;M.Arch I&quot;). The advantage to this route is that the student can study something else they are interested in their undergraduate study. Because students come from different undergraduate backgrounds, the breadth of knowledge and experience in the student body of an M.Arch I program is often considered an advantage. One possible disadvantage is that the total time in school is longer (7 or 7.5 years with an undergraduate degree). Another disadvantage is that the student has a very short time to cover the extremely broad scope of subject areas of which architects are expected to have a working knowledge. Nevertheless, major schools of architecture including MIT and Harvard often offer a 3.5-year program to students already with strong architectural background, fostering a competitive and productive academic environment.
* A third possible route is what schools are calling a &quot;post-professional&quot; master&#x27;s degree. It is research-based and often a stepping-stone to a Doctor of Philosophy in Architecture. Schools include Cornell, Harvard, Princeton, MIT, and RISD.

Some institutions offer a 5-year professional degree program. Depending on the school and course of study, this could be either a Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) or an M.Arch. In the U.S., it is typically a 5-year B.Arch Either degree qualifies those who complete it to sit for the ARE (the Architectural Registration Exam, the architecture equivalent of the bar exam), which leads to an architect&#x27;s license in the U.S.. One disadvantage of the B.Arch degree is that it is rarely considered as sufficient qualification for teaching architecture at the university/college level in the U.S. (though there are many exceptions). Many architects who wish to teach and have only received a B.Arch choose to pursue a 3-semester master&#x27;s degree (not an M.Arch) to obtain further academic qualification.

Graduate-level architecture programs consist of course work in design, building science, structural engineering, architectural history, theory, professional practice, and elective courses. For those without any prior knowledge of the field, coursework in calculus, physics, computers, statics and strengths of materials, architectural history, studio, and building science is usually required. Some architecture programs allow students to specialize in a specific aspect of architecture, such as architectural technologies or digital media. A thesis or final project is usually required to graduate.

In the United States, The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) is the sole accrediting body for professional degree programs in architecture. Since most state registration boards in the United States require any applicant for licensure to have graduated from an NAAB-accredited program, obtaining such a degree is an essential aspect of preparing for the professional practice of architecture. First time students matriculating with a 5-year B.Arch degree can also qualify for registration without obtaining a master&#x27;s degree. Some programs offer a concurrent learning model, allowing students the opportunity to work in the profession while they earn their degree, so that they can test for licensure immediately upon graduation.

In Canada, Master of Architecture degrees may be accredited by the Canadian Architectural Certification Board (CACB), allowing the recipient to qualify for both the ARE and the Examination for Architects in Canada (ExAC).

As of June 2022, there were 120 accredited Master of Architecture programs in the United States, including Puerto Rico.

<text>Regency romances are a subgenre of romance novels set during the period of the British Regency (1811–1820) or early 19th century. Rather than simply being versions of contemporary romance stories transported to a historical setting, Regency romances are a distinct genre with their plot and stylistic conventions. These derive not so much from the 19th-century contemporary works of Jane Austen, but rather from Georgette Heyer, who wrote over two dozen novels set in the Regency starting in 1935 until she died in 1974, and from the fiction genre known as the Novel of Manners. In particular, the more traditional Regencies feature a great deal of intelligent, fast-paced dialogue between the protagonists and very little explicit sex or discussion of sex.

==Subgenres==
Many readers and writers of Regency romance make a distinction between &quot;Traditional Regency Romance&quot; and &quot;Regency Historical&quot;. Many authors have started by writing Traditionals and subsequently written Historicals, including Mary Balogh, Jo Beverley, Loretta Chase, and Mary Jo Putney.

===Traditional Regency romance===
The distinction rests on the genre definition of Regency Romance: works in the tradition of Georgette Heyer, with an emphasis on the primary romance plot, are considered traditional. Traditional Regency Romance writers usually pay close attention to historical detail, as their readers are notorious for noting errors, and the writers often do extensive research so they can clearly understand and replicate the voice of the genre. After Heyer&#x27;s novels became popular in the United States in the 1960s, many publishers began publishing other Regency-set books by new authors, including Clare Darcy and Elizabeth Mansfield. Signet, Dell, and Fawcett were among those publishing Traditional Regencies in paperback; the latter eventually began a special imprint, Fawcett Coventry, which published Regencies and romances from other historical periods.

===Regency historical romance===
The Regency-set books written by authors such as Christina Dodd, Eloisa James, and Amanda Quick are generally considered to be Regency Historical works. Regency romances which may include more social realism, or, conversely, anachronistically modern characterization, might be classed by some as &quot;Regency Historical&quot;, signifying that their general setting is in Regency England, but the plot, characterization, or prose style of the work extends beyond the genre formula of the Regency romances published by Heyer and her successors. Characters may behave according to modern values, rather than Regency values.

The sensual Regency historical romance has been made popular in recent years by Mary Balogh, Jo Beverley, Loretta Chase, as well as Lisa Kleypas, and Stephanie Laurens. These novels are much more explicit than the &quot;Traditional Regency&quot; works and include many more love scenes.

==Common elements==

Many Regency romance novels include the following:

* References to the ton (le bon ton)
* Depictions of social activities are common during the social season such as carriage rides, morning calls, dinner parties, routs, plays, operas, assemblies, balls, etc. 
* References to, or descriptions of, athletic activities engaged in by fashionable young men of the period, including riding, driving, boxing, fencing, hunting, shooting, etc.
* Differences in social class
* Marriages of convenience: a marriage based on love was rarely an option for most women in the British Regency, as securing a steady and sufficient income was the first consideration for both the woman and her family. 
* False engagements 
* Cyprians (sex workers), demireps (women of ill repute), mistresses and other women employed by rakehell and men from the upper classes
* Mistaken identity, deliberate or otherwise
* Mystery or farce elements in the plot
* The rank system of the peerage of England plays a large role in the &quot;marriage mart&quot; of Regency Romance. Observers have noted a historically inaccurate and statistically unlikely overabundance of Dukes in the genre.
# Duke
# Marquess
# Earl
# Viscount
# Baron

==Popularity of the genre==
Like other fiction genres and subgenres, Regencies experience cyclic popularity swings.
The readership waned during the 1990s with the rise of historical romances (and the switch of many Regency writers to the historical genre). In the early 2000s, both Regencies and other historical romances lost popularity in favor of contemporary settings. The market in the United States was hurt by changes in distributing and retailing romances. The last two major U.S. publishers to produce the shorter &quot;traditional&quot; Regencies regularly were Zebra and Signet. This ended in 2005 when Zebra stopped their traditional Regency line, and in early 2006, when Signet ended its Regencies. There are some new &quot;traditional&quot; Regencies still published in the United States; some of the few publishers that still do so are Avalon Books, Five Star Books, and Cerridwen Press (Cotillion). Previously published Regencies are also available through the second-hand book market, via Belgrave House (which publishes out-of-print books), and as e-book reprints.

The Regency subgenre changed somewhat during the 1990s and 2000s, when authors began incorporating more sex into their novels, under pressure from a changing reader base. While some long-time readers balked, publishers viewed the inclusion of sex scenes as a means of keeping the subgenre afloat. The goal was to appeal to a new generation of readers while still delivering the witty and clever plotlines loyal readers love. Regency romance authors such as Sandra Heath, Anita Mills, and Mary Balogh were the first to write about sexual relationships between the hero and heroine (or more rarely, between the hero and his mistress).

Not all Regency romance novels are frothy period pieces. Such authors as Balogh, Carla Kelly, Sheila Bishop, Anna Harrington, and Mary Jo Putney all depict the underbelly of Regency society, exploring a variety of social ills in their novels. Some authors feature seriously troubled heroes and heroines, who suffer from post-battle trauma, alcoholism, depression, and the like.

<doc id="997573" wikidata="Q3460953" url="?curid=997573" title="Sackville Gardens">
<text>Sackville Gardens is a public space in Manchester, England. It is bounded by Manchester College&#x27;s Shena Simon Campus on one side and Whitworth Street, Sackville Street, the Rochdale Canal and Canal Street on the others.

The land was purchased by Manchester Corporation in 1900 and laid out with walks, lawns and flower beds. Known as Whitworth Gardens, it was planned to complement the Municipal College of Technology&#x27;s Sackville Street Building. It is regularly used for events, such as Village People and Manchester Pride, and as the meeting point each morning for Free Manchester Walking Tours.

== Turing memorial ==
The gardens contain the Alan Turing memorial statue, which depicts the &quot;father of modern computing&quot; sitting on a bench at a central position in the park. Sculptor Glyn Hughes said the park was chosen as the location for the statue because &quot;It&#x27;s got the university science buildings...on one side and it&#x27;s got all the gay bars on the other side, where apparently he spent most of his evenings.&quot;

The statue was unveiled on 23 June, Turing&#x27;s birthday, in 2001. It was conceived by Richard Humphry, a barrister from Stockport, after seeing Hugh Whitemore&#x27;s play &quot;Breaking the Code&quot;, and he set up the Alan Turing Memorial Fund in order to raise the necessary funds. Glyn Hughes, an industrial sculptor from Adlington near Westhoughton, was commissioned to sculpt the statue. The fund eventually raised around £15,000, which was far short of the £50,000 needed to have the statue cast in Britain, so it was cast in China.

Turing is shown holding an apple, a symbol classically used to represent forbidden love, as well as being the fruit of the tree of knowledge, the object that inspired Isaac Newton&#x27;s theory of gravitation, and the means of Turing&#x27;s own death. The text on the bronze bench reads &quot;Alan Mathison Turing 1912–1954&quot; and &quot;IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ&quot;. The latter is described by Glyn Hughes as &quot;a motto as encoded by the German &#x27;Enigma&#x27;&quot;. The original message is often given as &quot;Founder of Computer Science&quot;, however this is unlikely as the Enigma ciphering system does not allow a letter to be enciphered to itself, while the fourteenth letter of that message (the &quot;U&quot; in &quot;Computer&quot;) is the same as the fourteenth letter of the encoded inscription.

A plaque at the statue&#x27;s feet says &quot;Father of Computer Science, Mathematician, Logician, Wartime Codebreaker, Victim of Prejudice&quot;, followed by a Bertrand Russell quotation: &quot;Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth but supreme beauty, a beauty cold and austere like that of sculpture.&quot; The sculptor buried his own old Amstrad computer (a popular early home computer) under the statue, as a tribute to &quot;the godfather of all modern computers&quot;.

== Beacon of Hope ==
The gardens also contains the Beacon of Hope, the UK&#x27;s only permanent memorial for people living with HIV or AIDS and lives lost to it. The sculpture, a decorated steel column designed by Warren Chapman and Jess Boyn-Daniel, was erected in the year 2000.

On World AIDS Day a candlelight vigil generally takes place at the Beacon. For several years the vigil, the traditional closing event of the Manchester Pride LGBT celebration weekend, had been held at the city&#x27;s Castlefield Arena, but because of the siting of the beacon, it was decided that the vigil should be held in the gardens. Following a highly successful event in 2002, organised by the Village Business Association, George House Trust took control of the vigil for EuroPride in 2003, in collaboration with Manchester City Council and local HIV/AIDS groups such as Body Positive North West, the Lesbian and Gay Foundation and the Black Health Agency. George House Trust no longer runs the vigil annually at Manchester Pride.

During 2021 and 2022, community organisations worked together to refurbish the Beacon of Hope. This work included the repainting of the railings around the Beacon, re-gilding of lettering on the plinth, replacement of missing and broken mosaic tiles and repairs to the internal lighting inside the Beacon itself. The restoration project included George House Trust, Friends of Sackville Gardens, Manchester City Council, LGBT Foundation and Manchester Pride, supported by venues from across the Gay Village. The project has also been supported by Greater Manchester Mayor’s LGBTQ+ Advisor, Carl Austin-Behan.

In July, 2022 George House Trust held a re-dedication event of the Beacon of Hope HIV Memorial in Sackville Gardens.

== National Trans Memorial ==
 A monument called the National Transgender Memorial was unveiled in July 2013. After being vandalised in August 2013, it was restored in March 2014.

During the night of the 29 august 2022 just after the Manchester Pride, the monument was set on fire and damaged.

Plans for a new monument have been submitted to the city council on the 9th of April 2024.

<doc id="997576" wikidata="Q259425" url="?curid=997576" title="Alpine salamander">
<text>The alpine salamander (Salamandra atra) is a black salamander that can be found in the French Alps, and through the mountainous range in Europe. It is a member of the genus &quot;Salamandra&quot;. Their species name, &quot;atra&quot;, may be derived from the Latin &quot;ater&quot;, meaning dull black. The salamanders&#x27; coloration has evolved over time, as some species are completely monochrome black and others have yellow spotting and marks. Their life expectancy is at least 10 years. There are four subspecies of the alpine salamander, with varied distribution and physical coloration. Unlike other salamanders, whose larvae are developed in water, the alpine salamander and its subspecies are a fully terrestrial species in life and gestation. They give birth to live young.

Alpine salamanders produce toxic compounds from their skin. These compounds may protect them from both predator and microbial threats.

== Description ==
Alpine salamanders are often small in size, and dark brown or black. Members of the subspecies are not wholly black or brown monochrome, but rather have mosaic or spotted patterns. Members of the subspecies &quot;Salamandra atra aurorae&quot; have bright splotches on its dorsal side and head. The color is often bright yellow, but can range to shades of white or even gray. Distribution of the pigment is dependent on the distribution of certain cells, so may be smooth and even or patchy.

Female &quot;S. atra&quot; tend to be larger than the males, and can grow up to 151 millimeters, or around 5.9 inches. Males will grow to around 144 millimeters, or 5.6 inches: both measurements include the tail. Males have swollen, visible cloacae, and are more slender than females. The salamanders have parotid glands posterior and lateral to their eyes, giving them an elongated head shape. They tend to have between 11 and 13 costal grooves along the sides of their bodies, and a double row of dorsal glands runs down their backs on either side of their spines, down to the tips of their tails.

=== Coloration ===
Most alpine salamanders that are either completely black (melanistic) or predominantly black have the dark pigment as a baseline, but the evolution behind this dark coloring has a winding history. Scientists have studied the hypothesis of if the salamanders start completely black, or if they evolved like that over time. DNA-evidence traced through maternal lineages suggest the latter: that salamanders evolved their black coloration over time.

Biological pigmentation is determined by presentation of specific color-producing cells, called chromatophores, which absorb and/or reflect light in a particular way to then appear as a color. In &quot;S. atra&quot;, there are different cells present or activated, which yield different colors: melanophores contribute to the dark coloration by producing the dark pigment melanin, while xanthophores produce a yellow pigment, and iridophores are simply light-reflecting. The fully-black phenotype seen in &quot;S. a. atra&quot; results from the salamanders&#x27; melanophores in the dermis and epidermis, producing melanin alone. Xanthophore-iridophore complexes are responsible for production of yellow spotting, which appears bright. In species without yellow patches, it appears that they do not ever develop these cells. In &quot;S. a. aurorae&quot; or other salamanders with different coloration on different parts of their body, two distinct skin types are present: one that only contains melanophores (black), and one that has melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores in combination.

The yellow coloring on some alpine salamanders is thought to be an aposematic strategy to fend off predation. The pure black coloring is also hypothesized to be a form of thermoregulation, though it may also be considered a warning to some predators.

== Taxonomy and subspecies ==
*&quot;S. a. atra&quot; is a fully melanistic (black) subspecies from central, eastern and Dinaric Alps. This subspecies is the most widespread.
*&quot;S. a. aurorae&quot;, the golden alpine salamander, has golden or yellow spots on its back and primarily lives in a small area in the Venetian Prealps near Asiago, and in the Italian Alps.
*&quot;S. a. pasubiensis&quot;, with fewer yellow spots than &quot;S. a. aurorae&quot;, lives in a different part of the Venetian Prealps.
*&quot;S. a. prenjensis&quot; lives on Prenj Mountain, part of the Dinaric Alps in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The validity of this subspecies is yet to be confirmed, and some scientists in the field debate if this salamander should be considered its own independent species.

Genetic analysis suggests that the Corsican fire salamander (&quot;Salamandra corsica&quot;) is the closest related species, and the black-yellow coloration is an ancestral feature of alpine salamanders. Proposed colonization from south (Prealps) to Alps was carried out by the fully melanistic (derived feature) &quot;S. a. atra&quot; after the last retreat of the ice sheets.

== Habitat and distribution ==
=== Habitat ===
As terrestrial organisms, these salamanders live on land. &quot;S. atra&quot; tend to live underneath stones or logs, or in rocky crevices in their mountainous habitat. They also are diurnal, and most active in the day with periods of inactivity, rest, or sleep at night. They will engage in nocturnal activity on a weather-dependent basis. Ideal weather for alpine salamanders is rainy or post-rain, at temperatures between .

=== Geographic distribution ===
The alpine salamander is found from the France–Switzerland border at the western end of its range, all the way through Austria to the Dinaric Alps at the eastern edge of its territory. This salamander typically lives at altitudes above above sea level, even reaching of elevation. The western Alps (in France and Italy) are inhabited by a similar species, Lanza&#x27;s alpine salamander (&quot;Salamandra lanzai&quot;), in only one small area. &quot;S. atra&quot; generally live in forested biomes, particularly deciduous-coniferous mixes. They also can inhabit meadows or grasslands in the mountains, and tend to do well with a mix of tree types.

Their range spans several nations, including: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Hersegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo, France, Italy, Austria.

==Home range and territoriality==
They thrive in forest environments that have silver fir and beech trees. Coniferous forests that have high proportions of Norway spruce and European larch trees also provide adequate habitats, even though the salamanders live on the ground floor. Because alpine salamanders are completely terrestrial, they have on-land territories that they tend to return to throughout the day and for refuge. They often return to the same sites for much of their lives. Any time that they leave their sites, they expose themselves to predation and also to the chance of losing their site. Alpine salamanders are ectothermic, so losing a refuge or shelter could leave them exposed to the elements and be extremely costly, if not fatal, due their lack of an internal thermoregulation mechanism. 

This high dependency on a quality nest site supports the theory that many terrestrial salamanders, including &quot;S. atra&quot;, engage in territorial behaviors. Capture-recapture methods suggest that the species is very stationary; was the maximum observed distance traveled by one individual during the summer season. About 120 individuals per hectare were counted in most suitable areas with over 2000 individuals per hectare also observed, suggesting that this rather cryptic species is quite abundant.

=== Territorial behavior ===
They employ scent-marking techniques for territorial behaviors, and to mark their territories using fecal pellets so they can identify their own shelters. Scent-marking is an intra-species communication, where chemical signals convey specific messages to other &quot;S. atra&quot; individuals. Alpine salamanders can determine if a found fecal pellet has been left by a member of their same sex and/or species. Thus, this technique serves a double purpose to warn other salamanders that that particular location has already been claimed.

Females are more likely to return to their home site, while males are more emboldened to enter another male&#x27;s territory. Their fecal pellets allow them to both participate in homing behavior, or returning to their own site, and territoriality, and determine intruders on their territory or invade the spaces of others.

== Conservation ==
Alpine salamanders are not resilient to habitat changes— few terrestrial salamanders are— so risks of climate change altering their living spaces is severe. Although alpine salamanders are listed as Least Concern on IUCN Red List, their numbers are decreasing. Additionally, some subspecies of &quot;S. atra&quot; are in greater danger. Population numbers are declining in &quot;S. a. aurorae&quot;, for example.

One of the greatest dangers to alpine salamanders overall is commercial deforestation in their habitats. Machinery like tractors or other forestry tools can compress the soil, eliminating some of the small insects that &quot;S. atra&quot; eat or eliminating potential nooks and burrows for them to use as shelters. Many scientists propose changes in the lumber industry as an attempt to heal these habitats. These salamanders may also change their morphology as global temperatures rise. Amphibians and other organisms that do not internally regulate their body temperature may need adaption mechanisms to remain at ideal physiological temperatures in the face of changing climates. Other issues like acid rain or precipitation changes could prompt many animals, including alpine salamanders, to be forced into new habitats. Alpine salamanders play a crucial role in their ecosystems. There are already animal and ecosystem conservation laws in Europe, but many scholars recommend additional ones to protect the flora and fauna.

== Predators ==
Due to their toxicity, as well as decreased concentration of animals at high altitudes, researchers are unsure of consistent predators for alpine salamanders with limited observation. These salamanders do move slowly, which could increase their risk of being caught. Generally, predators of the broad category of toxic &quot;Salamandra&quot; species can include birds, rats and snakes, as well as other, larger carnivorous mammals like raccoons, minks, wild boars and foxes.

One notable predator of &quot;S. atra&quot; is young snakes. In particular, juvenile European adders (&quot;Vipera berus&quot;) pose a risk because they live at similarly high altitudes to alpine salamanders. &quot;S. atra&quot; have been suggested to make up just under half of these snakes&#x27; diets in some locations. They may hunt for alpine salamanders during early morning hours, when &quot;S. atra&quot; is most active. There also has been recorded evidence of these snakes swallowing alpine salamanders. &quot;V. berus,&quot; alongside the grass snake (&quot;Natrix natrix&quot;), are noted predators of alpine salamanders in the Italian Alps.

== Feeding ==
Male and female alpine salamanders have relatively similar diets. Some specific organisms they prey on include species such as beetles, snails, millipedes, and spiders, but alpine salamanders display preferences among prey. &quot;S. atra&quot; typically consume organisms from the Coleoptera and mollusca taxa. These taxa are the most crucial component of their diet. They also tend to eat larger prey since they themselves are larger salamanders. Such preference indicates a dimensional selectivity, in which the energy intake of prey consumption is maximized. Though alpine salamanders have definite dietary preferences, they have a substantial amount of variation in their diet that corresponds to their own optimized physical needs and prey-catching abilities.

== Mating and interactions ==
=== Mating pattern ===
The alpine salamander engages in a promiscuous mating pattern, meaning that they engage in multiple partner pairings. Males travel farther than females do, potentially to follow a scent emitted by females, and typically while still in their juvenile stage. Female &quot;S. atra&quot; find and defend their shelters, which is a potential reason that they may stay more local than males.

=== Male-male behavior ===
Males are more likely to engage in chasing other males, as well as actually fighting with each other. Oftentimes, one male will mount the other, loosely grasp it with his forearms, and start rubbing his head on the other male. The two males will switch roles, and in one studied interaction, continued like this for seven minutes before parting ways. In a second documented fight, the behavior was more intense. When one member tried to leave, the other male chased it to re-engage. This encounter lasted eight minutes. There is both photographic and video evidence of these behaviors. Researchers are unsure if it is caused by territoriality, confusion on sexual identification and mistaken mating, or true combat.

== Gestation and reproduction ==
Alpine salamanders live in a sex ratio of 1:1. Mating occurs on land. The male clasps the female at the forelegs, and fertilization is internal. &quot;S. atra&quot; are categorized as viviparous, meaning that their young are born alive and unlike many other amphibians, do not go through metamorphosis They give birth to 2 young, sometimes 3 or 4. New young alpine salamanders may measure as long as at birth, with the mother measuring only .

Female alpine salamanders have uteruses that are composed of a single luminal epithelial cell layer, connective tissue, and smooth muscle. The uterine eggs are large and numerous, but, as a rule, only one fully develops in each uterus. The embryo is nourished on the yolk of the other eggs, which more or less dissolve to form a large mass of nutrient matter. The egg mass can be as long as between 25 mm and 40 mm long. The embryo passes through three stages:

# The first stage is when they are still enclosed within the egg and living on its own yolk.
# The second stage is when they are free, within the vitelline mass, eating it directly with their mouths.
# The final stage occurs when there is no more vitelline mass. The embryo is possessed of long external gills, which serve as an exchange of nutritive fluid through the maternal uterus, these gills functioning in the same way as the chorionic villi of the mammalian egg.

Generally, at altitudes of above sea level, a pregnancy lasts two years, and at altitudes of 1,400-1,700 m above sea level, the pregnancy lasts around three years, though anything within a 2-4 year range is considered standard. Alpine salamander embryos are unique in how they are able to take in these nutrients through a long gestation. A portion of the mother&#x27;s uterine wall becomes nourishment after the salamanders have already eaten the unfertilized eggs, (called oophagy or stage 1 and 2). They then partake in epitheliophagy, or stage 3, where they ingest these zona trophica cells until birth, and have special tooth-like developments that allow it to do so without detriment to the mother.

== Physiology ==

=== Glands and toxins ===
As mentioned above, alpine salamanders have poison glands. They are known to produce some alkaloid molecules and peptide products, and thus have a mustard-like scent associated with them. &quot;Salamandra&quot; bioproduction is still a developing research area. Salamandarines are a chemical secretion produced by the skin of alpine salamanders, as well as some fire salamanders. They are neurotoxins, and are synthesized via a biochemical pathway, completely independent of dietary intake. This means that they make these chemicals within their bodies, not as a result of ingesting poisonous substances.The starting material for this nerve-block is most likely cholesterol, and it is about twice as potent as cyanide. This pales in comparison to other toxins produced by salamanders, but &quot;S. atra&quot; do not only use this powerful substance to paralyze prey: they may have antimicrobial properties that protect them against bacterial and fungal infections. Salamandorone is another biochemical compound produced by &quot;S. atra,&quot; and though it is less potent against prey it is the strongest antimicrobial weapon these salamanders have.

There are two main categories of toxin studied, samandarine and samandarone. There also exist many other compounds, as well as miscellaneous alkaloid secretions. Both samandarine and samandarone are produced by &quot;S. atra&quot; species. It is hypothesized that salamandarine is more commonly produced in alpine salamanders as a predator defense mechanism, and salamandorones are produced where there is greater infection risk. There is also noted geographic variation in toxin production by alpine salamanders.

=== Immunobiology and protection ===
Samandarone, a toxin they produce via skin secretion, has noted antimicrobial activity. In one study, this toxin was present where there was infection risk, but at low concentration. There is a wide arsenal of toxins produced by &quot;S. atra&quot; , many of which are antimicrobial or could be precursors to other protective molecules. Nonetheless, the alpine salamander has been relatively lucky in avoiding infection with amphian chytrid fungus compared to other amphibian species. This dangerous fungal infection, caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has decimated amphibian populations on every continent. Bd is present in the Alps where alpine salamanders live, but in a study performed in 2012, there were no salamanders who tested positive when swabbed. This may be because Bd infections are more common in species who spend more of their time in water, and since the alpine salamanders are terrestrial, they are less susceptible. An alternate hypothesis proposes that &quot;S. atra&quot; are resistant via their skin microbiome or a produced molecule, thus granting them immunity. This theory is untested, but considering how many salamanders excrete biological toxins, plausible.

<text>14 Herculis or 14 Her is a K-type main-sequence star away in the constellation Hercules. It is also known as HD 145675. Because of its apparent magnitude, of 6.61 the star can be very faintly seen with the naked eye. As of 2021, 14 Herculis is known to host two exoplanets in orbit around the star.

== Stellar components ==
14 Herculis is an orange dwarf star of the spectral type K0V. The star has about 98 percent of the mass, 97 percent of the radius, and only 67 percent of the luminosity of the Sun. The star appears to be 2.7 times as enriched with elements heavier than hydrogen (based on its abundance of iron), in comparison to the Sun. It may have been the most metal rich star known as of 2001.

== Planetary system ==
In 1998 a planet, 14 Herculis b was discovered orbiting 14 Herculis via radial velocity. This was formally published in 2003. The planet has an eccentric orbit with a period of 4.8 years. In 2005, a possible second planet was proposed, designated 14 Herculis c. The parameters of this planet were very uncertain, but an initial analysis suggested that it was in the 4:1 resonance with the inner planet, with an orbital period of almost 19 years at an orbital distance of 6.9 AU. The existence of the planet 14 Herculis c was confirmed in 2021, along with a rough orbit determination.

A 2021 study combining radial velocity and astrometry found that the planetary orbits are not coplanar, which may indicate a strong planet-planet scattering event in the past. Subsequent astrometric studies have found differing results; a 2022 study found inclinations consistent with aligned orbits, while a 2023 study again found misaligned orbits. The latter study also found signs of a third candidate planet with a period of about 10 years, but this signal is most likely related to the star&#x27;s magnetic activity cycle.

Direct imaging of the outer planet 14 Herculis c with the James Webb Space Telescope is planned.

&quot;Bessie Smith in stereo,&quot; wrote jazz critic Leonard Feather of Dane in the late 1950s. &quot;Time&quot; wrote of Dane: &quot;The voice is pure, rich ... rare as a 20-carat diamond&quot; and quoted Louis Armstrong&#x27;s exclamation upon hearing her at the Pasadena jazz festival: &quot;Did you get that chick? She&#x27;s a gasser!&quot; On the occasion of her 85th birthday, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; music critic James Reed called her &quot;one of the true unsung heroes of American music.&quot;

==Early life==
Dane&#x27;s parents were from Arkansas, and arrived in Detroit where she was born in the 1920s. Her father Gilbert Spillman was a pharmacist who ran his own store, and her mother Dorothy (Roleson) Spillman was a professional bridge player. She was the oldest of three children. In the 1930s, when she was nine years old, her father chastised her for serving a Coca-Cola to a Black man, and he ejected the man from his store. She later remembered that watershed moment: &quot;I took him inside my heart and bonded with his hurt, identified with the denial of his personhood.&quot;

She graduated from Redford High School in Detroit and briefly attended Wayne State University. She began to sing regularly at demonstrations for racial equality and economic justice. While still in her teens, she sat in with bands locally and won the interest of local music promoters. She received an offer to tour with Alvino Rey&#x27;s band, but she turned it down in favor of singing at factory gates and in union halls.

==Career as singer==
To &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine, she seemed &quot;startlingly blonde, especially when that powerful dusky alto voice begins to moan of trouble, two-timing men and freedom ... with stubborn determination, enthusiasm and a basic love for the underdog, [she is] making a name for herself ... aided and abetted by some of the oldest names in jazz who helped give birth to the blues.&quot; The seven-page article was filled with photos of Dane working with Memphis Slim, Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Clara Ward, Mama Yancey, Little Brother Montgomery, and others.

By 1959, Louis Armstrong had asked &quot;Time&quot; magazine readers: &quot;Did you get that chick? She&#x27;s a gasser!&quot; After his invitation, she appeared with Armstrong on the nationally screened Timex All-Star Jazz Show hosted by Jackie Gleason on January 7, 1959. She toured the East Coast with Jack Teagarden, appeared in Chicago with Art Hodes, Roosevelt Sykes, Little Brother Montgomery, Memphis Slim, Otis Spann, Willie Dixon, and others, played New York with Wilbur De Paris and his band, and appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; as a solo guest artist. Dane&#x27;s other television work included &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, Bobby Troup&#x27;s &quot;Stars of Jazz&quot;, and &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;.

In 1961, she opened her own club, Sugar Hill: Home of the Blues, on San Francisco&#x27;s Broadway in the North Beach district, with the idea of creating a venue for the blues in a tourist district where a larger audience could hear it. At this location, Dane performed regularly with her two most constant musical companions: Kenny &quot;Good News&quot; Whitson on piano and cornet and Wellman Braud, a former Duke Ellington bassist.

In her speech to the GI Movement of the Vietnam War Era (whose text can be found in the booklet included in Paredon Records&#x27; 1970 &quot;FTA! Songs of the GI Resistance&quot; LP), Barbara Dane said, &quot;I was too stubborn to hire one of the greed-head managers, probably because I&#x27;m a woman who likes to speak for herself. I always made my own deals and contracts, and after figuring out the economics of it, I was free to choose when and where I worked, able to spend lots more time with my three children and doing political work, and even brought home more money in the end, by not going for the &#x27;bigtime.&#x27; I did make some really nice records, because I was able to choose and work with wonderfully gifted musicians.&quot;

Dane will be portrayed by singer Sarah King in the forthcoming film &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot;.

==Political activism==

She was the Michigan teenage director of American Youth for Democracy in the early 1940s , which was at that time the youth wing of the Communist Party USA. She was expelled from the Communist Party in the late 1940s, along with her husband at the time, folk musician Rolf Cahn.

She was part of a successful campaign in the early 1960s to prevent Pacific Gas &amp; Electric from constructing the Bodega Bay Nuclear Power Plant. In organizing the resistance to that plan, she recorded an album on the Fantasy label with Wally Rose, Bob Helm, Bob Mielke, and Lu Watters. It included the title track, &quot;Blues Over Bodega&quot;, and another tune, &quot;San Andreas Fault&quot;.

She stepped up her work in the movements for peace and justice as the struggle for civil rights spread and the Vietnam War escalated. She sang at peace demonstrations in Washington, D.C., and throughout the U.S. and toured anti-war GI coffeehouses all over the world. In 1966, Dane became the first U.S. musician to tour post-revolutionary Cuba, during which Fidel Castro visited with her for three hours while she was doing her laundry at her hotel.

In January 1964, Bob Dylan praised Dane&#x27;s commitment in an open letter he wrote to &quot;Broadside&quot; magazine: &quot;the heroes of this battle are not me and Joan [Baez] and The Kingston Trio... but there&#x27;s some that could use the money I mean people like Tom Paxton, Barbara Dane and Johnny Herald... they are the heroes if such a word has to be used here... we need more kind a people like that people that can&#x27;t go against their conscience no matter what they might gain and I&#x27;ve come to think that that might be the most important thing in the whole wide world.&quot;

In 1970, Dane founded Paredon Records with husband Irwin Silber, a label specializing in international protest music. She produced nearly 50 albums, including three of her own, over a 12-year period. The label was later incorporated into Smithsonian Folkways, a label of the Smithsonian Institution, and is available through its catalog.

In 1978, Dane appeared with Pete Seeger at a rally in New York for striking coal miners.

==Blues singer and role model==
When Dane was in her late 70s, Philip Elwood, jazz critic of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, said of her: &quot;Dane is back and beautiful... she has an immense voice, remarkably well-tuned... capable of exquisite presentations regardless of the material. As a gut-level blues singer, she is without compare.&quot; Blues writer Lee Hildebrand calls her &quot;perhaps the finest living interpreter of the classic blues of the 1920s.&quot; In a 2010 KALW profile on Dane, produced by Steven Short, blues musician Bonnie Raitt said &quot;she&#x27;s always been a role model and a hero of mine – musically and politically. I mean, the arc of her life so informs mine that – she&#x27;s – I really can&#x27;t think of anyone I admire [more], the way that she&#x27;s lived her life.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Dane was married three times. Her first marriage (1946-1950) was with folk singer Rolf Cahn. Their son, Jesse Cahn, also became a folk musician. Dane had two children with her second husband, jeweler Byron Menéndez, whom she divorced in 1963. Their son Pablo Menéndez leads Mezcla, a multicultural musical ensemble in Cuba. Nina Menéndez, Dane&#x27;s daughter, is the artistic director of the Bay Area Flamenco Festival and Festival Flamenco Gitano. In 1964, Dane married Irwin Silber, a New Communist movement activist and former editor of &quot;Sing Out!&quot; magazine. They remained married until Silber died in 2010. They resided in Oakland, California.

On October 20, 2024, Dane, who had heart failure, died through assisted suicide at her home in Oakland, under the provisions of the California End of Life Option Act. She was 97.

<text>Chun Lee-kyung (; born January 6, 1976, in Okcheon, Chungcheongbuk-do) is a retired South Korean short track speed skater. She is a four-time Olympic Champion and three-time Overall World Champion for 1995–1997. She was a dominant force in International Short Track Speed Skating during the mid-1990s.

Chun took part in the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, at the age of 15, but failed to win much attention. In 1994, however, Chun won two gold medals at the Lillehammer Winter Olympic Games. She won the women&#x27;s 1000 m final, defeating the reigning World Champion Nathalie Lambert and former World Champion Kim So-hee, and was part of the team that won the 3000 m relay in a world record time along with Kim.

Between 1994 and 1998 Winter Olympics, Chun won the Overall World Championship three times in a row, in 1995, 1996 and 1997 (becoming the second person to have won three consecutive Overall World Championships). She shared the 1997 title though with Yang Yang (A), her most significant career rival. She also won the Overall World Cup title for 1997–1998 season.

In 1998, at the Nagano Winter Olympics, Chun successfully defended both of her Olympic titles, by defeating China&#x27;s Yang Yang (A) and Yang Yang (S) in the 1000 m final after trailing for most of the race. Yang Yang (A) crossed the line together with Chun in what was ruled and reviewed as a photo finish, but was then disqualified for cross tracking Chun at the very end as Chun tried to pass on the inside (although the photo finish seemed to show Chun having defeated her for the gold regardless). She led the relay team to another Olympic victory with world record time, completing the first &quot;double-double&quot; in Olympic short track history. She also added a 5th Olympic medal, a surprising bronze in the 500 metres, her weakest event and which she had never won a World Championship medal in. She was advanced to the bronze after winning the B final, due to a major fall in the A final leading to the disqualification of Isabelle Charest, and the refusal to finish of Wang Chunlu. She became the first quadruple Olympic Champion in Short Track Speed Skating and the first one from Korea. One month later at the 1998 World Championships, her final major international meet, Chun won 4 medals including her 3rd title at 3000 metres, but was still narrowly denied a 4th consecutive Overall World Championship by Yang Yang (A) (the 2nd of Yang Yang (A)&#x27;s own 6 consecutive titles, after having tied Chun for the 97 title). The key event to the final overall result was the 1000 metres, where just as in Nagano Chun and Yang Yang (A) crossed in a virtual dead heat over the distance, but this time with Yang emerging the victor and getting the crucial 1st place points to the overall title with it. This provided the final chapter to the intense rivalry of the 2 all-time greats, as Chun would retire immediately after the meet.

In 2002, Chun was elected to the Athletes&#x27; Committee of the International Olympic Committee.

<text>The Battle of Beth Zechariah took place around May 162 BC during the Maccabean revolt fought between Jewish rebels under the leadership of Judas Maccabeus (Judah Maccabee) against an army of the Seleucid Empire, the Greek successor state (diadochi) to the Macedonian conquests that controlled Syria and Babylonia. The battle was fought at Beth Zechariah (modern Khirbet Beit Zakariyyah) and was a Seleucid victory, with the rebels driven from the field in retreat. Judas&#x27;s brother Eleazar Avaran died in combat with a war elephant. The defeat allowed the Seleucids to continue their campaign and besiege the Jewish holy city of Jerusalem.

== Primary sources ==
The Battle of Beth Zechariah is recorded in the book of 1 Maccabees () and in two of Josephus&#x27;s histories: &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; Book 12, Chapter 9 and &quot;The War of the Jews&quot; Book 1.1.41–46. 1 Maccabees is considered the main source on the battle; its detailed description of the Seleucid forces suggests that the author either was an eyewitness, or was able to interview an eyewitness in detail. &quot;Antiquities&quot; largely echoes 1 Maccabees, Josephus&#x27;s main source, although he adds additional details based on his first-hand knowledge of Judean topography and geography; &quot;War of the Jews&quot; contains new material that is absent from and sometimes contradicts 1 Maccabees, however, suggesting other Greek sources were used by Josephus in its composition, such as Nicolaus of Damascus. 

2 Maccabees describes Lysias&#x27;s expedition in very general terms (), although it focuses on a raid undertaken by Judas at night as well as a Jewish traitor Rhodocus who was caught passing secrets to the Seleucids. It seems the author knew the truth of the battle as 2 Maccabees describes Lysias&#x27;s eventual retreat as due to political concerns and not the result of a military defeat, and did not want to linger on an embarrassing setback for the rebellion. 2 Maccabees also dates the expedition to 149 SE (163 BC), slightly earlier than 1 Maccabees; which date is preferred is disputed by scholars.

== Background ==
In autumn 164 BC, Regent Lysias launched an expedition to Judea to defeat the Maccabean rebellion. The Maccabees under Judas Maccabeus fought the Greeks at the Battle of Beth Zur. Whether from losses in the battle or from news of the death of King Antiochus IV reaching Judea, Lysias left Judea and negotiated a compromise. He returned to the Seleucid capital of Antioch to fend off a political challenge for leadership from Philip (Greek: Philippus), a prominent Seleucid official from Media in the eastern half of the Empire who claimed Antiochus IV had appointed him regent before his death. The Maccabees captured Jerusalem, cleansed the temple, and rededicated the altar for Jewish worship. However, Seleucid forces still controlled the Acra, a strong fortress within the city that faced the Temple Mount. The Maccabees participated in a number of campaigns across greater Palestine while the Seleucid government was concerned with internal politics in the capital. Around April 162 BC (Year 150 of the Ancient Macedonian calendar), Judas laid siege to the Acra, attempting to eradicate the most prominent symbol of Seleucid power in Judea. This drew a strong Seleucid response: Lysias left Antioch and made a second expedition to Judea to relieve the Acra.

An issue both sides would struggle with was food shortages. The sources say that it was a fallow year previously; the exact implications of that statement are unclear, but it appears food supplies were thin if not at famine level. The problem had been exacerbated by a wave of Jewish refugees from outlying regions that had been brought to Judea for their own safety as the outlying regions descended into disorder with raids and civilian violence and murders between the Jewish and Gentile populations. Lysias&#x27;s expeditionary force was quite large, and armies acquired a substantial amount of their provisions from local foraging and requisitions in antiquity.

According to Josephus, the Seleucids had an army of about 50,000 infantry, about 5,000 cavalry, and approximately 80 war elephants. 1 Maccabees describes an even larger infantry army but only 32 elephants; historians generally take the lesser and assume Josephus was more accurate on his infantry estimate, and 1 Maccabees was more accurate on the number of elephants. The size of the Jewish army is unknown, but they appear to have trained a Hellenistic-style army in the year and a half since taking Jerusalem, as Josephus mentions a Jewish phalanx. Historians speculate that the Jews may have had anywhere from 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers.

==Lysias&#x27;s expedition==

Lysias and the Seleucid army of Syrian Greeks approached Judea from the southwest through Mount Hebron and besieged Beth-zur. After Beth-zur surrendered, they continued northward toward Jerusalem, about away. Judas declined to revert to the guerrilla tactics of earlier in the revolt, as this would likely mean ceding southern Judea and Jerusalem without contest. Instead, he rallied an army to intercept the expedition and positioned his troops on the high ground on the main road to Jerusalem. The Seleucids would be required to enter via a valley approach, restricting their numeral advantage. Near the end of May 162 BC, the two armies clashed at a narrow pass near Beth Zechariah.

Lysias sent a force to take the nearby ridges to cover his main force&#x27;s advance and their flanks, likely his cavalry and possibly skirmishers. The high ground there would also provide scouting and better visibility to the battle&#x27;s progress. The bulk of the troops marched through the valley path with light infantry at the front, and war elephants and the heavy infantry, a Greek phalanx armed with sarissas, behind. The light infantry could remove any obstacles found in the elephant&#x27;s path, and slow any surprise attack on the formation.

The war elephants unnerved Judas&#x27;s troops. As the Jews began to break for the rear, Judas&#x27;s brother, Eleazar Avaran, attempted to show his fellow soldiers that the elephants were vulnerable. Charging into the mouth of the Syrian forces, he attacked a large elephant. Eleazar cast himself under the animal and thrust his sword into its belly. The elephant crushed Eleazar, killing him, although the elephant eventually perished as well. This show of bravery was not enough to rally the Jewish forces, which collapsed under the heavy pressure of the Greek phalanx. The Maccabees retreated to mountainous and defensible Aphairema, near the original center of the revolt.

Lysias marched north to Jerusalem and laid siege to the rebel forces there. However, Lysias was limited by time: he could not spend too long away from the capital without risking his position as leader. Both sides were running short on food. The siege eventually ended with a peace deal: Lysias agreed to end his siege of Jerusalem, and the Maccabees ended their siege of the Acra. Lysias confirmed the repeal of Antiochus IV&#x27;s anti-Jewish decrees. The Greeks also tore down a defensive wall at &quot;Mount Zion&quot;, possibly referring to the Temple Mount. With the peace deal in place, Lysias was able to return to Antioch to fend off a renewed challenge from Philip for leadership of the Seleucid empire and guardianship of the young Antiochus V Eupator. He left around June or July 162 BC, although he may have sent some of his forces back earlier. According to Josephus, Philip was captured and executed; it is unknown whether Josephus had some unknown and lost source for Philip&#x27;s eventual fate, or this was simply a conjecture based on the fact that Philip never did attain leadership of the Empire.

==Analysis==
 writes that 300 scythed chariots were deployed as part of the expedition. As scythed chariots were generally used for lowland combat on flat plains, this information is doubtful; the ground in Judea is not very level, and it would be difficult to accelerate the chariots to the speed needed to make them effective. It is uncertain that the Seleucids even had so many chariots to send even if they wanted to. Neither 1 Maccabees nor Josephus mention chariots, both sources more interested in military details than 2 Maccabees is. Polybius describes 140 chariots at the military parade at Daphne in 166–165 BC, but does not indicate scythes on them; it is possible that these were merely ceremonial and utilitarian chariots meant for normal transportation rather than warfare.

1 Maccabees describes a larger army than Josephus does, saying that the expedition consisted of one hundred thousand foot-soldiers, twenty thousand horsemen, and thirty-two elephants. Scholars believe these numbers grossly exaggerated - such manpower likely exceeds the entire Seleucid army, and if actually sent, would have been even more of a logistics nightmare to feed and supply than Josephus&#x27;s suggestion of 50,000 infantry and 5,000 cavalry. The number of elephants is more unclear; Josephus writes that eighty elephants were with the expedition, although historian Bezalel Bar-Kochva argues for a lower figure. He suggests that Josephus might have misread an &quot;8&quot; (, an Eta) as an &quot;80&quot; (, a Pi) and notes that only 36–42 elephants were recorded by Polybius at the Daphne parade. Since elephants do not reproduce while in captivity and new elephants were likely difficult to procure due to losses in Seleucid territories closest to India, it is unlikely the Seleucids would have sent nearly all of those elephants that survived to 162 BCE to Judea, making a lower estimate more reasonable. 

A point of uncertainty on the conflict between Eleazar and the elephant is that 1 Maccabees writes that &quot;the king&quot; was on the elephant that Eleazar attacked. The ten-year old king is not described as accompanying the expedition, though. It is possible that king really referred to regent, and Eleazar somehow thought that Lysias or some other important commander must have been on the elephant, perhaps due to some impressive royal seal or decoration; if he did, this belief was likely incorrect, as Hellenistic commanders almost always rode on horses in the style of Alexander the Great. 1 Maccabees also describes the elephant as dying &quot;instantly&quot;; this is likely an exaggeration from the fog of war. The elephant may have eventually died, but as elephant hunters can attest to, they do not die quickly or easily. With the technology of the era, only an arrow fired nearly point-blank from a powerful bow to the brain or heart could instantly fell an elephant, and even a grave abdominal wound could take a few hours to bleed the elephant to death.

A final point of uncertainty is when Alcimus would come to power as High Priest. According to 1 Maccabees, it is only after Demetrius I Soter comes to power, suggesting a later date of 162–161 BC. However, 2 Maccabees suggests Alcimus was appointed during Antiochus V&#x27;s reign. If the version in 2 Maccabees is trusted, then it is possible that Lysias arranged for Alcimus to be High Priest as part of the peace deal that concluded his expedition.

==Legacy==
The use of war elephants was possibly banned by the Treaty of Apamea, the peace treaty that ended the Roman–Seleucid War in 188 BC which had required the Seleucids to give up their war elephants. The Seleucids generally considered the Treaty to only apply to the elephants they handed over at the time, however. The Romans sent a delegation in 162 BC a few months after the battle, and interpreting the treaty in the harshest possible way, they hamstrung the remaining elephants they could find and burnt some Seleucid warships. As a result, this battle was one of the last ones where the Seleucids could deploy a major force of war elephants; their use afterward was rarer.

The Maccabees were a more common topic in Christian art and literature than Jewish works from the Roman era to the Industrial age, as the Hasmoneans were not well-regarded by the Jewish rabbis and sages who compiled the Jewish canon after the fall of the Hasmonean kingdom for a number of reasons. Eleazar was seen in Christian works as prefiguring Jesus Christ for his selfless sacrifice. European Christian artists also made works at least partially due to the opportunity to draw an elephant, an exotic and exciting subject in the medieval and Renaissance era. 

Jews did eventually return to the topic of the Maccabean Revolt, but largely in the 19th and 20th centuries. Eleazar&#x27;s heroism was commemorated in a Hanukkah coin issued by the Bank of Israel in 1961.

The town of Elazar in the West Bank was named after the son of Mattathias, since it is on the road to Beit Zur (near present-day Karmei Tzur and the Arab town of Halhul). The small Arab hamlet of Hirbeit Zakariya (sitting on an ancient Byzantine site), and the large single oak tree of Alon Shvut, are the location of ancient Zechariah / Zakariya.

<doc id="997595" wikidata="Q243924" url="?curid=997595" title="Mythopoeic Society">
<text>The Mythopoeic Society (MythSoc) is a non-profit organization devoted to the study of mythopoeic literature, particularly the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, Charles Williams, and C. S. Lewis. These men were all members of The Inklings, an informal group of writers who met weekly in Lewis&#x27; rooms at Magdalen College, Oxford, from the early 1930s until late 1949.

== History ==

The Mythopoeic Society was founded in 1967 by Glen H. GoodKnight. Originally composed of discussion groups based in the Los Angeles area, it expanded to include organized branches across North America; in 1972 it assimilated the Tolkien Society of America. Membership is open to those who read, study, or write in the genres of myth and fantasy.

== Publications ==

Three periodical publications are produced by the society:

* &quot;Mythprint&quot; is a quarterly newsletter with notices of Society activity, book reviews and articles; Mythopoeic Society membership includes electronic Mythprint (PDF), also available in print format by subscription.
* &quot;Mythlore&quot;, edited by Janet Brennan Croft, publishes peer-reviewed articles on mythic and fantastic works, available by subscription; since 2017, back numbers are freely available at an archive provided by SWOSU.
* &quot;The Mythic Circle&quot; is a collection of original fiction and poetry, published yearly, available by subscription.

In addition to the periodicals, the society formed The Mythopoeic Press to publish material by and about writers of mythopoeic and fantastic literature, especially focused on The Inklings. Works published include out-of-print materials, collections of short articles and essays, and scholarly items.

== Activities ==

The society sponsors local discussion groups throughout the United States and the &quot;Annual Mythopoeic Conference&quot;, also known as &quot;Mythcon&quot;, generally held on college or university campuses in various locations, primarily within the United States. Mythcon XX was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1989. Mythcon XXIII was held at Keble College, Oxford, England, in 1992 as part of &quot;The J. R. R. Tolkien Centenary Conference&quot;, co-sponsored with The Tolkien Society. Likewise, Mythcon XXXVI in 2005 was held at Aston University, Birmingham, England, combined with &quot;Tolkien 2005 - 50 Years of The Lord of the Rings&quot;, sponsored by The Tolkien Society.

== Mythopoeic Awards ==

Since 1971 the Mythopoeic Society has bestowed a series of annual awards to outstanding works. In 1991 the literary award was broken into two categories: the &quot;Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature&quot; and the &quot;Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Children’s Literature&quot;.

The &quot;Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Inklings Studies&quot; is given to books on J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and/or Charles Williams that make significant contributions to Inklings scholarship. The &quot;Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Myth and Fantasy Studies&quot; is given to scholarly books on other specific authors in the Inklings tradition, or to more general works on the genres of myth and fantasy. For the scholarship awards, books first published during the previous three years are eligible, including finalists for previous years.

<text>How to Boil Water is an American television program. One of the first shows on the Food Network, it began broadcasting in 1993 and was first hosted by Emeril Lagasse. The focus of the show is simple cooking, as the show&#x27;s title suggests, and is directed at those who have little cooking skill or experience.

In the beginning of the history of Food Network, &quot;How to Boil Water&quot; was the trademark show of the network. As Emeril&#x27;s personal popularity grew, he eventually moved on to his own show, &quot;Essence of Emeril&quot;. &quot;How to Boil Water&quot; continued with the tandem chefs Cathy Lowe and Sean Donnellan. With this duo, the show followed the formula of a chef teaching somebody with no experience.

After Lowe and Donnellan, Frédéric Van Coppernolle along with comedian Lynne Koplitz, and then later Jack Hourigan, were the show&#x27;s hosts. This version of the show followed a formula similar to when Emeril hosted. It later returned to the chef-and-student model with chef Tyler Florence and Jack continuing as co-host.

<text>Veepstakes is an informal term for the quadrennial process in which candidates for president of the United States select a running mate. If the ticket wins, the running mate becomes the vice president of the United States and first in line to the presidency.

==Etymology==
A blend word of the words and &quot;sweepstakes&quot;, the neologism has been found in print as far back as 1952.

==Selection process==
Once the Republican Party and the Democratic Party choose their presumptive presidential nominees for the election, the candidates themselves choose their running mates. Running mates are heavily vetted before being announced in the weeks prior to the party national convention. The selection of a running mate is given considerable attention because the individual chosen can be seen to broaden the ticket&#x27;s appeal by complementing and balancing its strengths, ideologically, geographically, and with respect to credentials on either foreign or domestic policy.

Occasionally, the running mate is chosen from the pool of candidates who also ran in the primary, as was the case in 1960 with John F. Kennedy choosing Lyndon B. Johnson, 1980 with Ronald Reagan choosing George H. W. Bush, 2004 with John Kerry picking John Edwards, 2008 with Barack Obama picking Joe Biden, and in 2020 with Biden picking Kamala Harris.

Some presidential candidates who did not win their party&#x27;s nomination have prematurely announced running mates, such as Ronald Reagan selecting Richard Schweiker in 1976, and Ted Cruz selecting Carly Fiorina in 2016.

==Historical examples==
In 1960, when Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts won his party&#x27;s presidential nomination, he chose Senator Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas in an effort to win that state&#x27;s critical electoral votes and to enhance his appeal in the South.

In 2000, Texas Governor George W. Bush attempted to counter a perception of his inexperience by choosing Dick Cheney, a former White House Chief of Staff, House Representative, Secretary of Defense, and CEO of Halliburton.

<doc id="997645" wikidata="Q5080854" url="?curid=997645" title="Charles McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway">
<text>Charles Benjamin Bright McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway, (12 May 1850 – 23 January 1934), known as Sir Charles McLaren, 1st Baronet, between 1902 and 1911, was a Scottish jurist and Liberal Party politician. He was a landowner and industrialist.

==Early life and education==
Born in Edinburgh, McLaren was the son of the politician Duncan McLaren and Priscilla Bright. Priscilla was McLaren&#x27;s third wife, and was the daughter of Jacob Bright and the sister of the Liberal statesman John Bright and temperance activist Margaret Bright Lucas. His full siblings included the Liberal MP Walter McLaren and the philanthropist Helen Priscilla McLaren, wife of Italian dietitian Andrea Rabagliati. Among McLaren&#x27;s half-siblings were the judge John McLaren from his father&#x27;s first marriage and the doctor Agnes McLaren from his father&#x27;s second marriage.

McLaren was educated at Grove House School and then studied at the University of Heidelberg as well as the University of Bonn. He finally graduated from the University of Edinburgh first class honours with a Master of Arts.

==Political career==
McLaren began his career in journalism, but turned to the law and in 1874, he was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn as a barrister. In 1880, he was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Stafford; he served that constituency until 1886. In 1892, he returned to the Commons as MP for Bosworth, which he represented until 1910.

McLaren&#x27;s political career advanced during his second term, and in 1897 he was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel. It was announced that he would receive a baronetcy in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902 for the (subsequently postponed) coronation of King Edward VII, and on 24 July 1902 he was created a Baronet, of Bodnant, in the County of Denbigh. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1908, and held the office of Justice of the Peace in Middlesex, Flint, Denbighshire, and Surrey. In 1911, a year after he had left the Commons (his son replaced him), he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom with the title Baron Aberconway, of Bodnant, in the County of Denbigh.

McLaren was decorated with the 3rd class of the Japanese Order of the Sacred Treasure and received the Serbian Order of the Cross of Takovo. He was awarded a Commander of the Greek Order of the Redeemer.

==Career in industry==
His father-in-law, a noted industrialist, died in 1895, and McLaren became increasingly involved in the management of the companies inherited from him. He would become chairman of the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company and the British Iron Trade Association. McLaren chaired also the London-based Metropolitan Railway Company and the shipbuilding firm John Brown &amp; Company.

==Family==
On 6 March 1877, McLaren married Laura, the daughter of the chemist Henry Davis Pochin and suffragist Agnes Heap, in Westminster; the couple had four children. He and his wife were neighbours and friends of James McNeill Whistler, owning several of his works.

Laura died in 1933 and McLaren survived her until the following year. They are buried at a mausoleum called &quot;The Poem&quot; within Bodnant Garden, which became the traditional burial place of the Lords Aberconway. On his death in 1934, in Belgrave Square in London, the barony and baronetcy passed to his eldest son, Henry. His second son Francis sat also in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, however was killed during the First World War in his father&#x27;s lifetime. The older daughter Priscilla was a socialite as well as activist and married the journalist Sir Henry Norman, 1st Baronet. Her younger sister Elsie was the wife of Sir Edward Johnson-Ferguson, 2nd Baronet.

<doc id="997647" wikidata="Q5328390" url="?curid=997647" title="East Freetown, Massachusetts">
<text>East Freetown is one of two villages in the town of Freetown, Bristol County, Massachusetts, United States. Added to the town in 1747, East Freetown was originally an outpost settlement of Tiverton, Rhode Island, then a part of Massachusetts. It rests on the shore of Long Pond.

==History==
East Freetown was made a part of Freetown as a result of the Pocasset Purchase of 1747. It remained less economically developed and industrialized than its sister village, Assonet well into the 20th century. The village was the birthplace of Massachusetts Governor Marcus Morton.

===Historic District===

The East Freetown Historic District has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1999. It contains many buildings, sites, and features of local historical significance. The district is located roughly along Howland, Gurney, Washburn County Roads.

==Geography==
East Freetown is located in Southeastern Massachusetts. It is bounded by Dartmouth, Fall River, New Bedford, Lakeville, Assonet, Rochester, Acushnet, and Long Pond. It has a hilly terrain, with many outcroppings of bedrock. Maple, elm, oak, pine, and birch trees are common throughout. Numerous streams and brooks flow through the village, including Fall Brook.

Many peninsulas exist around Long Pond, laying site for summer resorts such as Heaven&#x27;s Heights and Hemlock Point. A small portion of the village comprises a part of the Freetown-Fall River State Forest.

==Churches==
Several churches have been built in East Freetown.

===St. John Neumann Church===
St. John Neumann Church is a Roman Catholic parish covering the village of East Freetown. On the grounds of the church are Cathedral Camp and Our Lady of the Lake camp, both of which combined to form the co-ed Cathedral Camp. The camp has an extensive outdoor program, including swimming and boating on Long Pond.

===East Freetown Congregational-Christian Church===

The East Freetown Congregational-Christian Church is a gathering of people who emphasize music, prayer, and Bible-based preaching as part of their worship life together. The congregation is bound by a covenant and is considered &quot;non-credal&quot;. That means there is no declared statement which is used as a filter of membership. The congregation has not been part of any other denomination or structure since its gathering in 1831. From its inception in the New England Christian Connexion movement of the 18th-19th century, the congregation has maintained five tenets of that movement: 1. the Lordship of Jesus Christ as the sole head of the church; 2. the use of no other name than &quot;Christian&quot;; 3. the canonical Scriptures as the only rule of faith and practice; 4. individual duty of the interpretation of the Scriptures; 5. Christian character as a test of fellowship. The church took on the additional title &quot;Congregational&quot; in 1931 as a recognition of the historical roots of its polity, and as part of an emerging spirit of communion among Reformed tradition American churches.
ed

==Schools==
From the early 19th century until 1950, Freetown was serviced by several neighborhood grammar schools, several of which existed in East Freetown.

*Furnace School
*Mason&#x27;s Corner School

===Today===
From 1950 forward, students have attended the Freetown Elementary School, first for grades 1-8, later K-6, and currently PreK-3. Students also attend George R. Austin Intermediate School (4-5), and Freetown-Lakeville Middle School (6-8).

For secondary education, students have three options: Apponequet Regional High School serves students with an academic focus for grades 9-12. Old Colony Regional Vocational Technical High School in Rochester accepts students from Assonet when there are openings, and provides a voc-tech atmosphere. Bristol County Agricultural High School serves students wanting to focus primarily in agricultural and animal studies.

<text>James J. Bradley (born February 19, 1945) is a politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a long-serving Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, sitting as an MPP from 1977 until 2018. He represented the riding of St. Catharines and served in the provincial cabinets of David Peterson, Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne. He was elected as a regional councillor in the St. Catharines municipal election of 2018. He is currently the Chair of the Regional Municipality of Niagara.

His 41-year term as an MPP is the second longest tenure in Ontario history, behind only Harry Nixon.

==Background==
Before entering politics, Bradley was a teacher with the Lincoln County Board of Education. He was elected as a city councillor to the St. Catharines City Council in 1970, but also remained in the classroom until 1977.

==Politics==
After failed bids in the elections of 1967 and 1971, Bradley was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1977 election in the riding of St. Catharines, and served as MPP for that riding until the 2018 election. He fended off strong challenges from the New Democratic Party in the 1990 election and the Progressive Conservative Party in 1995 election. On all other occasions until 2018, he was re-elected easily.

===Peterson government===
When the Liberals came to power under David Peterson following the 1985 election, Bradley became Minister of the Environment and held that position until the Liberals were defeated in the 1990 election. He is generally regarded as Ontario&#x27;s most effective Environment Minister, although some believe that his ambitions for the portfolio were undermined by Peterson and Finance Minister Robert Nixon. As Environment Minister, Bradley expanded Blue Box Recycling, making it a province-wide initiative, as well as instituting tough new penalties for polluters, enforced by a strengthened investigation and enforcement branch.


===In opposition===
Bradley was a vocal opponent of Peterson&#x27;s plans to call an election in 1990, preferring that the party wait until 1992 before going to the polls. While the Liberals were defeated, Bradley was personally re-elected and had a prominent position in the Opposition benches.

When Nixon, the interim leader of the Liberals, left Queen&#x27;s Park to accept an appointment, he was replaced by Murray Elston. Elston resigned as interim leader to run in the 1992 leadership convention, and Bradley became interim leader of the party and interim Leader of the Opposition from November 1991 until the election of Lyn McLeod in February 1992. He remained an opposition stalwart until the Liberals won the 2003 election under Dalton McGuinty.





===McGuinty government===
There was some speculation that Bradley would be re-appointed Minister of the Environment in McGuinty&#x27;s government, but this did not occur. Instead, he was named Minister of Tourism and Recreation on October 23, 2003. He was also given ministerial responsibility for Seniors on June 29, 2005. On October 11, 2005, Bradley was also appointed to replace Dwight Duncan as Government House Leader, following Duncan&#x27;s appointment as Minister of Finance. Bradley is also the province&#x27;s wine secretary, as well as the minister responsible for the Greenbelt.

On October 30, 2007, Bradley was sworn in as Minister of Transportation in McGuinty&#x27;s new cabinet. As Transportation Minister, Bradley supervised the introduction of an Ontario Enhanced driver&#x27;s licenses to be used at Canada/US border crossings. He introduced legislation to merge GO Transit and Metrolinx. Enacted tougher penalties for drivers who have a BAC of .05 or higher. Mandated that all commercial trucks that operate in Ontario be equipped with speed limiters to ensure heavy trucks don&#x27;t exceed 105 km/h. And in April 2009, it was announced that GO Transit would be expanded to the Niagara region, with bus service to Burlington in September and with weekend rail service to Toronto starting at the end of June.

On January 18, 2010, Bradley moved to the position of Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. In August he was moved to the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services.

On October 20, 2011, Bradley moved to become Minister of Environment once again in the wake of the 2011 election that saw the previous Minister of Environment, John Wilkinson, defeated.



===Wynne government===
Bradley continued as Environment Minister in Kathleen Wynne&#x27;s first cabinet after she won the leadership of the Liberal Party. Following the 2014 provincial election, the 69-year-old Bradley became a minister without portfolio with the title of Chair of Cabinet and was also appointed Deputy Government House Leader. He left cabinet in June 2016 as part of a cabinet shuffle, and later served as Chief Government Whip and Deputy Government House Leader.

In the 2018 election, Bradley lost his seat as the Liberal Party was defeated, losing official party status and suffering the greatest loss for any governing party in provincial history. He had served as St. Catharines MPP for 41 years.


===Municipal politics===
On July 27, 2018, the last day registration was open, Bradley registered to run for Niagara Regional Council.

Bradley was elected on October 22, 2018, finishing first out of 23 candidates with 18,954 votes.

On December 6, 2018, Bradley was selected as the Niagara Regional Chair, being elected on the first ballot receiving 19 out of 31 votes against two other candidates.

<doc id="997654" wikidata="Q691969" url="?curid=997654" title="Catwalk (Canadian TV series)">
<text>Catwalk is a Canadian musical drama television series that ran for 49 episodes on the YTV network from 1992 until 1994. The series&#x27; first season aired in syndication in the United States, while the second season aired on MTV.

== Synopsis ==
The series was based around six twenty-something adults who formed a band named Catwalk. The episodes centered on the band&#x27;s personal relationships and struggles to land a record deal, while also featuring their musical performances in nightclubs. Their main gathering place was a downtown loft.

Singer/guitarist Johnnie Camden (Keram Malicki-Sanchez) was at the focus of the show; it was in his loft where the band gathered to rehearse. Relationships were also a major part of the show; there were two couples within the cast, as Daisy (Neve Campbell) dated the group&#x27;s manager Billy K., and Mary (Kelli Taylor) dated the drummer Jesse (Paul Popowich). The relationship was tumultuous and the couple broke up before the end of the first season.

The second season featured a new character, Maggi (Nicole de Boer), who in the first season (in the episode &quot;Toxic Love&quot;) became briefly involved with lead guitarist Johnnie Camden, causing tension within the band.

<text>Used goods, also known as secondhand goods, are any item of personal property that have been previously owned by someone else and are offered for sale not as new, including metals in any form except coins that are legal tender. Used goods may also be handed down, especially among family or close friends, as a hand-me-down.

==Risks==
Furniture, especially bedding or upholstered items, may have bedbugs, if they have not been examined by an expert and some goods may be of poor quality.

==Benefits==
Recycling goods through the secondhand market reduces use of resources in manufacturing new goods and diminishes waste which must be disposed of, both of which are significant environmental benefits. Another benefit of recycling clothes is for the creation for new pieces of clothing from combining parts of recycled clothes to make a whole new piece. This has been done by multiple fashion designers recently and has been growing in recent years. 

However, manufacturers who profit from sales of new goods lose corresponding sales. Scientific research shows that buying used goods significantly reduces carbon footprint (including emissions) compared to the complete product life cycle. In most cases, the relative carbon footprint of production, raw material sourcing, and the supply chain—which comprise a great deal of the product&#x27;s life cycle—is unknown. A scientific methodology has been made to analyze how much emissions are reduced when buying used goods like secondhand computer hardware versus new hardware.

Quality secondhand goods can be more durable than equivalent new goods.

==Types of transfers==
Many items that are considered obsolete and worthless in developed countries, such as decade-old hand tools and clothes, are useful and valuable in impoverished communities in the country or in developing countries. Underdeveloped countries like Zambia are extremely welcoming to donated secondhand clothing. At a time when the country&#x27;s economy was in severe decline, the used goods provided jobs by keeping &quot;many others busy with repairs and alterations.&quot; It has created a type of spin-off economy at a time when many Zambians were out of work. The used garments and materials that were donated to the country also allowed for the production of &quot;a wide range of fabrics&quot; whose imports had been previously restricted. The trade is essentially executed by women who operate their small business based on local associations and networks. Not only does this provide self-employment, but it also increases household income and enhances the economy. But while many countries would be welcoming of secondhand goods, it is also true that there are countries in need who refuse donated items. Countries like Poland, the Philippines, and Pakistan have been known to reject secondhand items for &quot;fear of venereal disease and risk to personal hygiene&quot;. Similar to these countries, India also refuses the import of secondhand clothing but will accept the import of wool fibers, including &quot;mutilated hosiery&quot; which is a term meaning &quot;woollen garments shredded by machine in the West prior to export.&quot; Through the production of &quot;shoddy&quot; (recycled wool), most of which is produced in Northern India today, unused clothing can be recycled into fibers that are spun into yarn for reuse in &quot;new&quot; used goods.

There has been concern that export of electronic waste is disguised as trade of used goods, with the equipment ending in poor-country waste dumps. 

==Types==
=== Used clothing ===

In developed countries, unwanted used clothing is often donated to charities that sort and sell it. Some of these distribute some of the clothing to people on low incomes for free or at a very low price. Others sell all of the collected clothing in bulk to a commercial used clothing redistributor and then use the raised funds to finance their activities. In the U.S., almost 5 billion pounds of clothing are donated to charity shops each year, only about 10% of which can be re-sold by the charity shops. About a third of the donated clothing is bought, usually in bulk and at a heavy discount, by commercial dealers and fabric recyclers, who export it to other countries. Some of the used clothes are also smuggled into Mexico.

Whereas charity shops dominated the secondhand market from the 1960s to the 1970s, more specialized, profit-oriented shops emerged in the 1980s. These shops catered primarily to the fashionable female demographic and offered women and children designer clothes, and occasionally high-end formal wear for men. Resale boutiques specialized in contemporary high-end used designer fashion (for example, 2nd Take, or Couture Designer Resale), while others (such as Buffalo Exchange and Plato&#x27;s Closet) specialize in vintage or retro fashion, period fashion, or contemporary basics and one-of-a-kind finds. Still, others cater to specific active sports by specializing in things such as riding equipment and diving gear. The resale business model has now expanded into the athletic equipment, books, and music categories. Secondhand sales migrated to a peer-to-peer platform—effectively cutting out the retailer as the middleman—when websites such as eBay and Amazon introduced the opportunity for Internet users to sell virtually anything online, including designer (or fraudulent) handbags, fashion, shoes, and accessories.

Used clothing unsuitable for sale in an affluent market may still find a buyer or end-user in another market, such as a student market or a less affluent region of a developing country. In developing countries, such as Zambia, secondhand clothing is sorted, recycled, and sometimes redistributed to other nations. Some of the scraps are kept and used to create unique fashions that enable the locals to construct identity. Not only does the trade represent a great source of employment for women as well as men, but it also supports other facets of the economy: the merchants buy timber and other materials for their stands, metal hangers to display clothing, and food and drinks for customers. Carriers also find work as they transport the garments from factories to various locations. The secondhand clothing trade is central to the lives of many citizens dwelling in such countries. 
Importation of used clothing is sometimes opposed by the textile industry in developing countries. They are concerned that fewer people will buy the new clothes that they make when it is cheaper to buy imported used clothing. Nearly all the clothes made in Mexico are intended for export, and the Mexican textile industry opposes the importation of used clothes.

=== Electronics and home appliances ===
Electronics usually are traded as secondhand goods, and may represent a hazard if disposed of incorrectly. Many of them may still be used despite being possibly outdated; for example, an older television set or computer may be sold or handed down to someone who is in need of one. In some cases, older electronics (such as home audio equipment) may outlast new equipment.

This is also the case for home appliances, from microwave ovens and toaster ovens to refrigerators and kitchen stoves.

=== Design and furniture ===
Design items and furniture are also seeing an increase in being traded as secondhand goods. With some designer items being sought after in marketplaces. When trading design furniture and items you usually must be aware of the original retail price as most of the goods, if kept well, retain their value quite well.

=== Other items ===
The Sierra Club, an environmental organization, argues that secondhand purchasing of furniture is the &quot;greenest&quot; way of furnishing a home.

<doc id="997665" wikidata="Q35729" url="?curid=997665" title="Makalero">
<text>Makalero or Maklere is a Papuan language spoken in the Lautém district of East Timor. It was previously considered to be a dialect of Makasae, but is nowadays seen as a separate language, both by its speakers and linguists.

==Phonology==
The data in this section are from Huber (2017).

===Vowels===
Makalero has five vowel phonemes. Most long vowels occur in predictable contexts; thus Huber argues long vowels are marginal phonemes at best.

Syllables are commonly CV; some are CVC. Epenthetic vowels are often inserted between series of two consonants, and echo vowels are often added to the end of phonological phrases.

===Consonants===
Makalero has 11 native consonant phonemes.

==Grammar==
All information in this section is from Huber 2011.

===Lexical Categories===

Makalero does not have a definitive noun/verb distinction. Nearly all content words can be heads of NPs as well as predicates. In the following examples, &quot;isit&quot; can be a predicate or a nominal.

Content words must be bimoraic, unlike function words, which may be monomoraic.

===Valency===

Makalero has only avalent verbs and divalent verbs. There are no trivalent verbs; instead, biclausal constructions are used.

The avalent verbs are adverbial verbs such as &quot;atanana&quot; &#x27;first,&#x27; &quot;hana’e&quot; &#x27;a long time ago,&#x27; &quot;aire’&quot; &#x27;now,&#x27; &quot;kamunei&quot; &#x27;tomorrow,&#x27; &quot;mu’it&quot; &#x27;for a long time,&#x27; &quot;raine’&quot; &#x27;last night,&#x27; and &quot;tone’&quot; &#x27;maybe.&#x27;

Divalent verbs allow for a subject and either an object or complement.

In the following example, &quot;Kiloo&quot; is the subject and &quot;ani&quot; is the object.

In the following example, &quot;ani&quot; is the subject and &quot;rau-rau&quot; is the complement.

<doc id="997667" wikidata="Q7438739" url="?curid=997667" title="Scranton Button Company">
<text>The Scranton Button Company was a U.S. corporation that was founded in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1885.

==History==
For much of its early history, this company was controlled by Canadian immigrant William Connell (September 10, 1827 – March 21, 1909). Connell&#x27;s family moved to Scranton when he was a small child, and, at the age of seven he left school to work in the coal industry to help support his family. With time, he moved up to supervisory positions and became wealthy enough to buy the company when its charter expired. Connell then became an influential Scranton businessman, serving on several boards of directors, and purchased the Scranton Button Company shortly after its founding.

In addition to buttons, the company manufactured parts for telephones and advertising novelties. By 1915, the company was pressing three million buttons per day. Many of the buttons were made from shellac. During the 1920s, the company branched out from making buttons into pressing phonograph records by expanding its use of the same material. It subsequently offered full-service record production to any retailer that desired its own label.

In 1924, it bought Emerson Records and in July 1929 it merged with Regal Records, Cameo Records, Banner Records and the US branch of Pathé Records to form the American Record Corporation.

From 1929 on, the company pressed Brunswick, Melotone, Perfect, Banner, Regal, Domino, Conqueror, Vocalion and other ARC labels. (Even though Columbia was bought by ARC in 1934, Columbia records were pressed at Columbia&#x27;s Bridgeport, CT. plant.)

The Scranton plant was acquired in 1946 by Capitol Records. Though some sources have asserted that Capitol closed the factory in 1970, the label continued to operate the plant until July 1973 and then sold it in November of that same year to a Pittsburgh firm, North American Music Industries, which kept the plant in business until its final closure .

<text>Pamela Dorothy Iorio (born April 27, 1959) is an American politician and author, who served as mayor of Tampa, Florida from 2003 to 2011.

==Early life, education, and family==
Iorio moved with her family to Temple Terrace as an infant and attended Hillsborough County public schools.
Iorio earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree from American University and followed up with her masters at the University of South Florida. Iorio has been married to Mark Woodard, County Administrator for Pinellas County, since 1987, and they have two children, Caitlin and Graham. Her father, John Iorio, was an Italian immigrant and English professor, and one of the first professors at the University of South Florida.

==Career==
In 1985, at the age of 26, she became the youngest person ever elected to the Hillsborough County Commission. For a decade before her successful run for mayor, she served as Supervisor of Elections for Hillsborough County. During the 2000 presidential election recount, she was the president of the State Association of County Elections Supervisors propelling her into the role of spokesperson.

In 2001, her account of the white supremacist White Municipal Party was published in &quot;The Florida Historical Quarterly&quot;.

On April 1, 2003, she was sworn in as Mayor of Tampa, becoming the second woman to hold the office. Her first term dealt largely with re-energizing the downtown area, as well as the economic revitalization of Tampa’s most neglected neighborhoods. Iorio was also a big supporter of the arts, working to make Tampa a major arts center in the South. Iorio has also been credited with a sharp drop in drug trafficking in the city limits and a significant drop in major crimes. In her second term, Iorio advocated for improved mass transit, favoring a multi-modal plan which included a light rail system. While mayor, Tampa hosted a Super Bowl and successfully attracted the 2012 Republican National Convention.
In her official capacity as mayor, Iorio represented the city at important events such as the opening of the Tampa Bay History Center on January 17, 2009. On January 28, 2010, when Iorio welcomed U.S. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, Governor of Florida Charlie Crist, and Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, all of whom came to the University of Tampa for a national &quot;Town Hall Meeting&quot; to announce federal funding for Florida High Speed Rail and other projects. Iorio criticized Florida Governor Rick Scott&#x27;s decision to veto the high speed rail project, claiming he did so &quot;purely on ideological reasoning.&quot;

Her book, &quot;Straightforward&quot;, was released in November 2011. In the book she draws from her own experiences and shares the skills and characteristics needed to become an effective leader.

Since her time as mayor ended, Iorio has focused her time on working with Tampa area non-profits and spending time with her family. She has been involved with the Tampa Bay History Center, the Curtis Hixon Park and Riverwalk, and the USF Foundation

She had been mentioned as a possible Democratic Party candidate for governor of Florida in 2014. Iorio ultimately did not run. Iorio has also proposed changes to Florida&#x27;s election laws in order to avoid long lines at the polls and other irregularities.

In February 2014 Iorio was named as the President and CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, effective March 31, 2014.

In November 2018, Iorio was included in PEOPLE Magazine&#x27;s &quot;25 Women Changing the World in 2018.&quot;

<doc id="997680" wikidata="Q778298" url="?curid=997680" title="Endurance">
<text>Endurance (also related to , , resilience, , , , , , , , and hardiness) is the ability of an organism to exert itself and remain active for a long period of time, as well as its ability to resist, withstand, recover from and have immunity to trauma, wounds, or fatigue.

The term is often used in the context of aerobic or anaerobic exercise. The definition of &quot;long&quot; varies according to the type of exertion – minutes for high intensity anaerobic exercise, hours or days for low intensity aerobic exercise. Training for endurance can reduce endurance strength unless an individual also undertakes resistance training to counteract this effect.

When a person is able to accomplish or withstand more effort than previously, their endurance is increasing. To improve their endurance they may slowly increase the amount of repetitions or time spent; in some exercises, more repetitions taken rapidly improve muscle strength but have less effect on endurance. Increasing endurance has been proven to release endorphins resulting in a positive mind. The act of gaining endurance through physical activity decreases anxiety, depression, and stress, or any chronic disease. Although a greater endurance can assist the cardiovascular system this does not imply that endurance is guaranteed to improve any cardiovascular disease. &quot;The major metabolic consequences of the adaptations of muscle to endurance exercise are a slower utilization of muscle glycogen and blood glucose, a greater reliance on fat oxidation, and less lactate production during exercise of a given intensity.&quot;

The term stamina is sometimes used synonymously and interchangeably with endurance. Endurance may also refer to an ability to persevere through a difficult situation, to &quot;endure hardship&quot;.

In military settings, endurance is the ability of to sustain high levels of combat potential relative to its opponent over the duration of a campaign.

== Philosophy ==
Aristotle noted similarities between endurance and self control: To have self control is to resist the temptation of things that seem immediately appealing, while to endure is to resist the discouragement of things that seem immediately uncomfortable.

== Endurance training ==

Different types of endurance performance can be trained in specific ways. Adaptation of exercise plans should follow individual goals.

Calculating the intensity of exercise the individual capabilities should be considered. Effective training starts within half the individual performance capability. Performance capability is expressed by maximum heart rate. Best results can be achieved in the range between 55% and 65% of maximum heart rate. Aerobic, anaerobic and further thresholds are not to be mentioned within extensive endurance exercises. Training intensity is measured via the heart rate.

===Endurance-trained effects are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms===
Between 2012 and 2019 at least 25 reports indicated a major role of epigenetic mechanisms in skeletal muscle responses to exercise.

Gene expression in muscle is largely regulated, as in tissues generally, by regulatory DNA sequences, especially enhancers. Enhancers are non-coding sequences in the genome that activate the expression of distant target genes, by looping around and interacting with the promoters of their target genes (see Figure &quot;Regulation of transcription in mammals&quot;). As reported by Williams &quot;et al.&quot;, the average distance in the loop between the connected enhancers and promoters of genes is 239,000 nucleotide bases. 

====Endurance exercise-induced long-term alteration of gene expression by histone acetylation or deacetylation====

After exercise, epigenetic alterations to enhancers alter long-term expression of hundreds of muscle genes. This includes genes producing proteins and other products secreted into the systemic circulation, many of which may act as endocrine messengers. Of 817 genes with altered expression, 157 (according to Uniprot) or 392 (according to Exocarta) of the proteins produced according to those genes were known to be secreted from the muscles. Four days after an endurance type of exercise, many genes have persistently altered epigentically regulated expression. Four pathways altered were in the platelet/coagulation system, the cognitive system, the cardiovascular system, and the renal system. Epigenetic regulation of these genes was indicated by epigenetic alterations in the distant upstream DNA regulatory sequences of the enhancers of these genes. 

Up-regulated genes had epigenetic acetylations added at histone 3 lysine 27 (H3k27ac) of nucleosomes located at the enhancers controlling those up-regulated genes, while down-regulated genes had epigenetic acetylations removed from H3K27 in nucleosomes located at the enhancers that control those genes (see Figure &quot;A nucleosome with histone tails set for transcriptional activation&quot;). Biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle showed expression of 13,108 genes at baseline before an exercise training program. Six sedentary 23-year-old Caucasian males provided vastus lateralis biopsies before entering an exercise program (six weeks of 60-minute sessions of riding a stationary cycle, five days per week). Four days after the exercise program was completed, biopsies of the same muscles had altered gene expression, with 641 genes up-regulated and 176 genes down-regulated. Williams &quot;et al.&quot; identified 599 enhancer-gene interactions, covering 491 enhancers and 268 genes, where both the enhancer and the connected target gene were coordinately either upregulated or downregulated after exercise training.

====Endurance exercise-induced alteration to gene expression by DNA methylation or demethylation====

Endurance muscle training also alters muscle gene expression through epigenetic DNA methylation or de-methylation of CpG sites within enhancers. In a study by Lindholm &quot;et al.&quot;, twenty-three 27-year-old, sedentary, male and female volunteers had endurance training on only one leg during three months. The other leg was used as an untrained control leg. Skeletal muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis were taken both before training began and 24 hours after the last training session from each of the legs. The endurance-trained leg, compared to the untrained leg, had significant DNA methylation changes at 4,919 sites across the genome. The sites of altered DNA methylation were predominantly in enhancers. Transcriptional analysis, using RNA sequencing, identified 4,076 differentially expressed genes. 

The transcriptionally upregulated genes were associated with enhancers that had a significant decrease in DNA methylation, while transcriptionally downregulated genes were associated with enhancers that had increased DNA methylation. In this study, the differentially methylated positions in enhancers with increased methylation were mainly associated with genes involved in structural remodeling of the muscle and glucose metabolism. The differentially decreased methylated positions in enhancers were associated with genes functioning in inflammatory/immunological processes and transcriptional regulation.

<doc id="997686" wikidata="Q735400" url="?curid=997686" title="Edwin Barclay">
<text>Edwin James Barclay (5 January 1882 – 6 November 1955) was a Liberian politician, poet, and musician who served as the 18th president of Liberia from 1930 until 1944. He was a member of the True Whig political party, which dominated the political governance of the country for decades. Under Barclay&#x27;s leadership, Liberia was an ally of the United States during World War II.

== Early life ==
Edwin Barclay&#x27;s paternal grandparents moved from Barbados to Liberia with their children in 1865. They were among a minority of immigrants from the Caribbean but shared with the Americo-Liberians a culture with an English base, considerable mixed-race ancestry, and a shared history. Edwin&#x27;s father, Ernest Barclay, and uncle, Arthur Barclay, became important politicians in Liberia.

In 1901, at the age of 19, Edwin wrote a Liberian patriotic song, &quot;The Lone Star Forever.&quot; Barclay and his wife Euphemia had three children: Mary Barclay Dumbar, Siata Isabel Barclay, and Earnest Barclay. In addition, they fostered future Liberian Ambassador to the U.S., George Arthur Padmore (1915–2005).

==Career==

Edwin Barclay, a member of the True Whig Party which ruled at that time, served as secretary of state of Liberia in the government of Charles D. B. King from 1920 until 1930. He became President of Liberia in 1930 when President King and Vice President Allen Yancy resigned after being implicated by a League of Nations investigation as having profited from forced labor. He was elected in his own right for the first time in 1931.

==Presidency (1930–44)==
Barclay was selected to complete King&#x27;s term as president. One of his first official decisions was to repeal the famous Port of Entry Law of 1864 that had restricted the economic activities of foreigners in the country. Subsequently, in the early 1930s concession agreements were signed between the Liberian Government and Dutch, Danish, German and Polish investors. Barclay is credited with helping the country survive some of Liberia&#x27;s greatest threats to its sovereignty in that country&#x27;s history. These included threats by the League of Nations led by the German, British and American governments to occupy the country unless reforms were made, aggressive diplomatic intrigues by France and a coup attempt by the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company which owned much of Liberia&#x27;s land.

===Renegotiation of loan payments===
In 1926, the Liberian government had granted a major rubber concession to the Firestone Tire and Rubber company and undertook to borrow $5 million (~$ in ) from a Firestone subsidiary.

The Great Depression of the 1930s brought Liberia to the verge of bankruptcy. As the global economy collapsed, so too did prices of all commodities, including those for rubber. By 1932, rubber prices had fallen to a low of 3¢ a pound. Although the trees planted by the Firestone Company in 1926 and 1927 were reaching tapping age, the market price of rubber would cover only a small fraction of the cost of tapping, processing and transportation to market. Firestone did not bother to harvest and produce the rubber. Without this revenue, government revenues fell steadily to a low of $321,000 (~$ in ) in 1933.

By 1931, it became apparent to the Liberian administration that the revenue shortfall made continued loan repayments impossible. The government asked the lending bank and Firestone for forbearance on the loan payments but to no avail. Harvey Firestone attempted to persuade the United States government to employ &quot;gunboat diplomacy&quot; to compel compliance with the loan agreement. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt refused to interfere in Liberian internal affairs, writing in a memorandum to the State Department: &quot;At all times we should remember that (Harvey) Firestone went to Liberia at his own financial risk, and it is not the business of the State Department to pull his financial chestnut out of the fire except as a friend of the Liberian people.&quot;

In 1932, the Liberian Legislature passed the Moratorium Act suspending payment of the Firestone loan until terms could be negotiated that were more in line with Liberia&#x27;s ability to pay. The US suspended diplomatic relations but did not take further action.

When Barclay appealed to the League of Nations for help, the Council of the League of Nations established a commission of inquiry. The report of the commission recommended providing financial aid to Liberia with certain conditions that reflected concerns that the government of Liberia would not be able to pay a renegotiated loan without some level of monitoring. Some European powers in the League of Nations had advocated mandate status for Liberia, a move which would have abrogated the independence of the republic.

Barclay and other members of his cabinet objected to the proposed conditions on the grounds that they would infringe upon the sovereignty of Liberia. For example, one of the conditions would have required that the League&#x27;s delegates be placed in key positions within the Liberian government.

After Barclay implemented some of the measures that had been proposed by the League of Nations, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt restored diplomatic relations with Liberia in 1934. After three years of negotiation, an agreement was reached along lines suggested by the League. Two key League officials were placed in positions to advise the government, but with limitations set forth by the Liberian government. With this assistance program in place, Liberia was able to resume making loan payments.

===World War II===

In 1937 President Barclay, under pressure from the United States, withdrew the concession agreement with the German investors, who were accused of sympathies with the Nazi regime in their home country. Until 3 January 1944, Barclay was Liberian President, to be succeeded by William Tubman.

====Strategic importance of Liberia====
After the fall of Malaysia and Singapore to the Japanese during World War II, Liberia became very strategically important as its rubber plantation was the only source of natural latex rubber available to the Allies, apart from plantations in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Among many other uses, natural rubber was needed to build tires for war planes, military jeeps, aircraft guns, and sensitive radar equipment. As a result of the simultaneous sharp increase in demand and drastic reduction in supply, prices soared for natural rubber in the United States and measures were taken to reduce demand.

Writing in his memoirs, former U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull wrote, &quot;With Japan&#x27;s occupation of the Rubber producing areas in the Far East, Liberia became of greatly increased importance to us as one of the few remaining available sources of natural rubber.&quot; President Barclay assured the Americans that Liberia would supply all the natural rubber that the United States and its allies needed for the war effort.

====Defense Pact with the United States (1942)====

In 1942 Liberia signed a Defense Pact with the United States. This commenced a period of strategic development, including the construction of roads, airports and other infrastructure projects. Robertsfield Airport was built with runways long enough for B-47 Stratojet bombers to land for refueling, giving Liberia the longest runway in Africa to this day.

====Provision of war supplies to the North African theater====

The provision of war supplies to the North African theater was difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. German U-boats had taken complete control of the North Atlantic Ocean routes, making shipping in the North Atlantic Ocean hazardous to American warships and merchant vessels. In order to transport American soldiers and war supplies to North Africa, the United States needed to open up a South American-Liberian air corridor.

Because of its proximity to South America, Liberia became the first major West African bridgehead for the South Atlantic air ferry route. For this reason, the Liberian Government also granted to the United States use of its territory to store war supplies and to construct military bases in Montserrado County and Grand Cape Mount County at Fisherman&#x27;s Lake. United States military supplies were collected in Florida, transported through South America to Brazil, then flown from Brazil to the military depot at Roberts Field. There 5,000 United States African-American troops stored and maintained the inventory. From Roberts Field, the war supplies were flown to their final destinations in Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria.

====Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s visit to Liberia (1943)====
Liberia&#x27;s strategic importance to the Allied war effort was evidenced by the fact that, in January 1943, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt traveled to Liberia after participating in the Casablanca Conference in order to secure Liberia&#x27;s support. Roosevelt&#x27;s objectives were to negotiate the establishment of U.S. military bases in Liberia, secure Liberia&#x27;s commitment to continue supplying the U.S. with natural rubber, urge the Liberian government to expel German citizens and persuade it to abandon its neutrality and declare war on the Axis powers.

In May 1943, Edwin Barclay visited the United States. He was the first black man to be officially introduced from the rostrum of the United States Congress as a guest of honor.

==Retirement==
Barclay retired in 1944 and was replaced by William Tubman. He ran against Tubman in the 1955 presidential election, but received only about 1,100 votes. He died a few months later.

<text>The Leiden scale (°L or ÐL) is a temperature scale that was used to calibrate low-temperature indirect measurements in the early 20th century, by providing conventional values (in kelvins, then termed &quot;degrees Kelvin&quot;) of helium vapour pressure. The scale dates back at around 1894, when Heike Kamerlingh Onnes established his cryogenics laboratory in Leiden, Netherlands. It was used below −183 °C, the starting point of the International Temperature Scale in the 1930s (Awbery 1934). The boiling points of standard hydrogen (−253 °C), consisting of 75% orthohydrogen and 25% parahydrogen, and oxygen (−183 °C) were used as fixed points, corresponding to zero and 70 on the scale respectively.

<doc id="997696" wikidata="Q3366073" url="?curid=997696" title="Administrative share">
<text>Administrative shares are hidden network shares created by the Windows NT family of operating systems that allow system administrators to have remote access to every disk volume on a network-connected system. These shares may not be permanently deleted but may be disabled. Administrative shares cannot be accessed by users without administrative privileges.

==Share names==
Administrative shares are a collection of automatically shared resources including the following:
* Disk volumes: Every disk volume on the system is shared as an administrative share. The name of these shares consists of the drive letters of shared volume plus a dollar sign ($). For example, a system that has volumes codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3 has three administrative shares named C$, D$ and E$. (NetBIOS is not case sensitive.) 
* OS folder: The folder in which Windows is installed is shared as codice_4
* Fax cache: The folder in which faxed pages and cover pages are cached is shared as codice_5
* IPC shares: This area, which is used for inter-process communication via named pipes and is not part of the file system, is shared as codice_6
* Printers folder: This virtual folder, which contains objects that represent installed printers is shared as codice_7
* Domain controller shares: Windows Server family of operating system creates two domain controller-specific shares called codice_8 and codice_9 which do not have dollar signs ($) appended to their names.

==Characteristics==
Administrative shares have the following characteristics:
# Hidden: The &quot;$&quot; appended to the end of the share name means that it is a hidden share. Windows will not list such shares among those it defines in typical queries by remote clients to obtain the list of shares. One needs to know the name of an administrative share in order to access it. Not every hidden share is an administrative share; in other words, ordinary hidden shares may be created at user&#x27;s discretion.
# Automatically created: Administrative shares are created by Windows, not a network administrator. If deleted, they will be automatically recreated.

Administrative shares are not created by Windows XP Home Edition.

==Management==
The administrative shares can be deleted just as any other network share, only to be recreated automatically at the next reboot. It is, however, possible to disable administrative shares.

Disabling administrative shares is not without caveats. Previous Versions for local files, a feature of Windows Vista and Windows 7, requires administrative shares to operate.

==Restrictions==
Windows XP implements &quot;simple file sharing&quot; (also known as &quot;ForceGuest&quot;), a feature that can be enabled on computers that are not part of a Windows domain. When enabled, it authenticates all incoming access requests to network shares as &quot;Guest&quot;, a user account with very limited access rights in Windows. This effectively disables access to administrative shares.

By default, Windows Vista and later use User Account Control (UAC) to enforce security. One of UAC&#x27;s features denies administrative rights to a user who accesses network shares on the local computer over a network, unless the accessing user is registered on a Windows domain or using the built in Administrator account. If not in a Windows domain it is possible to allow administrative share access to all accounts with administrative permissions by adding the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy value to the registry.

<text>JDeveloper is a freeware IDE supplied by Oracle Corporation. It offers features for development in Java, XML, SQL and PL/SQL, HTML, JavaScript, BPEL and PHP. JDeveloper covers the full development lifecycle from design through coding, debugging, optimization and profiling to deploying.

With JDeveloper, Oracle has aimed to simplify application development by focusing on providing a visual and declarative approach to application development in addition to building an advanced coding-environment. Oracle JDeveloper integrates with the Oracle Application Development Framework (Oracle ADF) - an end-to-end Java EE-based framework that further simplifies application development.

The core IDE exposes an API that other teams in Oracle use to build extensions to JDeveloper. BPEL, Portal, Business Intelligence and other components of the Oracle platform all build their design-time tools on top of JDeveloper. To accommodate to Sun Microsystems (and thus NetBeans) acquisition versions released after 2012 are sharing significant code with NetBeans platform. The same IDE platform also serves as the basis of another Oracle product, SQL Developer, which Oracle Corporation promotes specifically to PL/SQL and database developers.

==Features==
Prior to JDeveloper 11g, JDeveloper came in three editions: Java Edition, J2EE Edition, and Studio Edition. Each one offered more features on top of the others, and all of them came for free.

In 2005, Oracle released JDeveloper as freeware.

In 2006, still under the 10g tag, and after significant delays, Oracle released version 10.1.3 - the latest major 10g release.

In October 2006, Oracle released version 10.1.3.1 that added support for the final EJB 3.0 spec along with BPEL and ESB design time.
In January 2007, Oracle released version 10.1.3.2 incorporating WebCenter capabilities such as creating and consuming portlets, portlet/JSF bridge, and content-repository data control.

In January 2007 Oracle had more than 150 people working in various roles on the product, including (in no particular order): developers, development managers, QA engineers, build engineers, doc writers, product managers, customer evangelists, and usability engineers. Development centers operated in Redwood Shores, in Bangalore, in Reading (UK), and in Pleasanton, Colorado.

In May 2007 Oracle released a technology-preview release of version 11g.

In October 2008 the production version of Oracle JDeveloper 11&quot;g&quot;, code-named BOXER, became available.

In July 2009 JDeveloper 11&quot;g&quot; version 11.1.1.1.0, code-named Bulldog, became available

In June 2011 JDeveloper 11&quot;g&quot; (11.1.2.0.0), code name Sherman, became available.

In September 2011 JDeveloper 11&quot;g&quot; (11.1.2.1.0 Build 6081), R2/PS1 became available.

In May 2012 JDeveloper 11&quot;g&quot; (11.1.2.2.0 Build 6183), R2/PS2 became available.

In September 2012 JDeveloper 11&quot;g&quot; (11.1.2.3.0 Build 6276.1), R2/PS3 became available.

In May 2013 JDeveloper 11&quot;g&quot; (11.1.2.4.0 Build 6436), R2/PS4 became available.

In July 2013 JDeveloper 12&quot;c&quot; (12.1.2.0.0 Build 6668) became available.

In June 2014 JDeveloper 12&quot;c&quot; (12.1.3.0.0) became available.

In October 2015 JDeveloper 12&quot;c&quot; (12.2.1.0.0) became available.

In June 2016 JDeveloper 12&quot;c&quot; (12.2.1.1.0) became available.
In August 2017 JDeveloper 12&quot;c&quot; (12.2.1.3.0) became available.
In September 2019 JDeveloper 12&quot;c&quot; (12.2.1.4.0) became available.
==Visual and declarative==
The JDeveloper code editor offers a rich set of coding features including visual and non-visual utilities that provide different views of the code. The software provides dialogs that guide the use of Java EE components.

For example, JDeveloper provides a visual WYSIWYG editor for HTML, JSP, JSF, and Swing. The visual editor allows developers to modify the layout and properties of components visually: the tool re-generates the code. Any changes in the code will be immediately reflected in the visual view. JDeveloper provides a similar feature for generating JSF and Struts page flows.

Declarative features enable programmers to generate EJBs or POJOs based on tables in relational databases. JDeveloper automates the creation of Java EE artifacts. For example, with a click on a visual artifact one can turn a Java class into a web service. JDeveloper generates the associated WSDL (Web Services Descriptive Language) document and related JAX-RPC components.

==License==
JDeveloper is free proprietary software for development and deployment. Oracle ADF has a runtime license when deployed outside of an Oracle Application Server.

<doc id="997701" wikidata="Q1808987" url="?curid=997701" title="Breaker High">
<text>Breaker High is a teen comedy-drama series that ran from 1997 to 1998, airing on YTV in Canada and on UPN&#x27;s weekday &quot;Kids&quot; block in the United States. The series was created by Cori Stern, while David Winning directed the pilot and seven episodes of the series.

Ownership of the series passed to Disney in 2001 when Disney acquired Fox Kids Worldwide, which also includes Saban Entertainment.

==Synopsis==
The series is set at a high school located on a cruise ship (equivalent to the real Semester at Sea program), allowing the episodes to be set in different exotic locations, although the series was, in fact, filmed entirely in Vancouver, British Columbia. Like most series of its kind, it featured events such as dating, finances, and friendship, although as a daytime series, it tended to steer away from the &quot;tougher&quot; situations (pregnancy, sexuality, etc.) outlined in other primetime teen dramas at the time.

== Cast and characters ==

*Terri Conn as Ashley Dupree
*Ryan Gosling as Sean Stanley Hanlon

<doc id="997705" wikidata="Q7237071" url="?curid=997705" title="Pozzo (Waiting for Godot)">
<text>Pozzo is a character from Samuel Beckett&#x27;s play &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;. His name is Italian for &quot;well&quot; (as in &quot;oil well&quot;).

On the surface he is a pompous, sometimes foppish, aristocrat (he claims to live in a manor, own many slaves and a Steinway piano), cruelly using and exploiting those around him (specifically his slave, Lucky and, to a lesser extent, Estragon). He wears similar clothes to Vladimir and Estragon (i.e. a bowler and suit), but they are not in the dire condition theirs are.

== &quot;Godot&quot;&#x27;s antagonist ==

While by no means a villain in a conventional sense of the word, Pozzo is sometimes considered (nominally) the &quot;antagonist&quot; of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;. Although he is not technically in opposition to the so-called heroes of the play (Vladimir and Estragon) he does bring chaos into their sheltered world. Upon his first entrance, he immediately goes about attempting to exert authority on the hapless &quot;Didi&quot; and &quot;Gogo&quot; by shouting at them, ordering them about, and generally making a nuisance of himself. Along the way he mercilessly abuses Lucky (physically and mentally) into performing menial and sometimes pointless tasks. However, despite his authoritative presence, he has the tendency of falling to pieces at the (literal) drop of a hat. At certain points in the first act (and for most of the second act; see below) he has minor nervous breakdowns when things don&#x27;t go his way (e.g. when he misplaces things, when Vladimir and Estragon don&#x27;t understand him/berate him, etc.). Pozzo should not be seen, however, as merely a mindless, weak oppressor. He has a developed intellectual side: he philosophises intelligently and optimistically.

== On his blindness ==
Pozzo goes through a rather radical transformation between the first and second acts: he goes blind. When he makes his second (final) entrance, he almost immediately falls over and cannot get up. He remains this way for the rest of his scene, helplessly moaning and bemoaning his fate and condition. This change supposedly only occurs in the past day. Some critics interpret this as representing his failure to see the suffering in others, and thus has brought suffering upon himself.

== Pozzo and Estragon ==
Pozzo is often compared to Estragon (just as Lucky is compared to Vladimir) as being the impulsive, right-brained part of his character duo. The idea is that Pozzo and Lucky are simply an extreme form of the relationship between Vladimir and Estragon (the hapless impulsive, and the intellect who protects him), and thus extreme forms of those very characters.

He, like Estragon, has an awful memory, and since he cannot rely on Lucky for memory (as Estragon can on Vladimir), he is even more in the dark (e.g. he cannot even remember one day before). Vladimir claims that he and Estragon know him, but this is naturally not corroborated by Estragon, and the nature of their former relationship remains unknown. He occasionally comes up with poetic metaphors for the current situation, again, just as Estragon does.

<text>Demon Diary (ko: 마왕일기 &quot;mawang ilgi&quot;, &quot;Diary of a Demon King&quot;) is a 7-volume &quot;soonjung&quot; Japanese style manhwa (Korean comic) illustrated by Kara. &quot;Kara&quot; is the name of the duo team consisting of Kim Yoon-gyeong and Jeong Eun-sook. The name Kara is taken from the Hebrew Bible - Jeremiah 35:17 - and it means &quot;to invite&quot;. &quot;Demon Diary&quot; was originally published by Sigongsa and has been licensed in North America by Tokyopop. In Scandinavia, it was published by Mangismo between 2005-2006.

A number of writers have worked with Kara on the production of &quot;Demon Diary&quot;. The story for volume 1 was written by Lee Jeehyung. Lee stopped writing, because he had to prepare for the upcoming high school exams. The stories for volumes 2 through 7 were written by Lee Yun-hee.

==Story==
&quot;Demon Diary&quot; is a light story about Raenef, a newly appointed Demon Lord, and Eclipse, his instructor, who is both a powerful demon and a veteran of a human-versus-demon war. Because of his actions during the Hangma War (which are not elaborated upon), he became known for his cruelty and incredible power. However, when attempting to teach Raenef, Eclipse&#x27;s &#x27;anger&#x27; is often played for laughs.

==Characters==
Raenef V
: A sweet, somewhat naive boy who is the complete opposite of a proper Demon Lord. Though he drives Eclipse to endless distraction, he warms the stoic demon&#x27;s heart quite quickly. Despite his happy-go-lucky personality (even as a thief), he harbors a dark past, which includes joining the thieves&#x27; guild in order to survive because he was an orphan. At first, he is quite an idiot but somewhat cute. However, as the series progresses, he becomes weary of his own sweetness and another side of his personality is revealed. The &quot;other Raenef&quot; is a particularly cruel Demon Lord with high intelligence and a strong grasp of magic. In the end, the two personalities are blended. Raenef IV said he is his child.

Eclipse
: A powerful and ancient high ranking demon whose occupation consists of serving those of the Raenef name. It is revealed that his services are highly sought after by many demon lords. He is charged with finding the newest Lord Raenef (Raenef V) and educating him. Though the newest demon lord never ceases to annoy and exasperate him, he comes to care very deeply for the innocent boy. He and Raenef IV are implied to have had a relatively close relationship, which becomes a point of conflict later in the series.

Erutis
: A young Swordsmaster and former mercenary who originally came to kill the &quot;fearsome demon lord,&quot; only to find Raenef. Not believing that such a naive, innocent boy could be an evil demon lord, she tried to leave, only to be attacked by a somewhat miffed Raenef. Though she easily beats him in a fight, when she tried to kill him, her sword broke, leaving her with no weapon. Thinking quickly, she managed to trick Raenef into thinking that she would work as a henchman for him. Her intentions were to slip away once he fell asleep. Unfortunately, she ran into Eclipse, who trapped her in a bubble shield and later coerces her into really becoming a servant. Her ambiguous gender becomes a running joke throughout the series (in a character omake, she is seen kicking the artist and writer for deliberately making her seem so boyish). Despite her role as comic relief for most of the series, she is quite skilled as a warrior, with an enchanted blade (which unfortunately broke when Raenef defended himself), replaced with a handmade wooden sword that she is able to use almost as well because of her abilities as a Swordsmaster. To her dismay, her fearsome temper only attracts the attentions of the eccentric Demon Lord Krayon, who insists on following her around and quite inadvertently gets her a position as the head of her own mercenary group.

Chris
: He is a hot-headed, over-zealous High-Priest-in-training. Chris accidentally summons Raenef with a summoning circle, almost causing another war. Because of his infraction, the High Priest sends Chris to Raenef&#x27;s palace to learn some humility. With his delusions of grandeur, Chris acts as another source of comic relief. However, like most of the characters, he has a tragic past. As a child, he watched as his mother was killed and his entire village was destroyed by demons, leaving him in a catatonic state. The High Priest of Rased saved him in time, only to be visited by the God of Light, Rased, who had chosen to protect the boy, declaring that Chris was &quot;someone very precious&quot; to him. Though it is yet to be seen how important Chris is to the demon and human world, it is only due to Chris&#x27;s clerical magic that an evil Raenef is able to be stalled and weakened long enough to be stabilized.

Meruhesae
: She is one of the main Demon Elders. She is a seductive and elegant female demon also known for her abilities as a seer. She directs Eclipse to the location of Raenef V and is one of the few characters able to unsettle the normally stoic demon. Flirtatious and somewhat vain, she has a serious side, revealed in her particular relationship with the previous Raenef. She particularly likes to annoy Eclipse, who has a curious dislike of her, asking for &quot;payment&quot; for her services. In the case of information on Raenef V, she asks for a kiss--however, she simply kisses Eclipse on the forehead. She states her reasoning as not wanting to bring on the wrath of Eclipse&#x27;s fans by going for more.

Krayon
: He is one of the five elders. He is a very eccentric and flamboyant demon who nevertheless is not to be underestimated (As shown in the last volume when he burns down a town after a family there &quot;wronged&quot; Euritis). He is the Demon Lord of Dreams, therefore he is able to throw Raenef, Erutis, and Chris into a dream world when he comes to the castle to buy Eclipse&#x27;s services from Raenef. During the ensuing battle with the trio, he comes to be particularly attracted to Erutis, who blanches at his declarations of love. He goes as far as to ask Raenef IV to protect her if any upheavals were to happen in the demon world and ceaselessly follows her around. He took care of Raenef IV and tutored him at one point (when both were much younger), and seems to be somewhat wary of the other Demon Lord.

Raenef IV
: He is the previous Demon Lord Raenef. A powerful Demon Lord, he specialized in incantations, written spells that increase the user&#x27;s power tremendously when memorized or written correctly. Much of him is shrouded in mystery, particularly the circumstances of his death. Though he is portrayed as eccentric and even a little mischievous (particularly by a very irritated Krayon, who had to &quot;tutor&quot; the younger demon lord in years past), he is ruthless and somewhat self-serving. Though he has been dead for some time, his spirit still appears, though the older demons Meruhesae and Krayon don&#x27;t seem to be particularly ruffled by his apparition. It is revealed that Raenef IV caused his own death to avoid a powerful curse, called &quot;the Destruction of the Name,&quot; placed on him during the war. He had a particularly close relationship with Eclipse, which could echo the latter&#x27;s growing bond with Raenef V.

Leeche
: A young girl from a noble human family who runs off to find adventure and/or kill the Demon Lord. She drugs the actual Demon Lord&#x27;s bride - a young human maiden sent off to marry the Demon Lord in order to please him - and takes her place. She meshes quite well with Chris, although they fight a lot, they agree on one thing: they must kill the Demon Lord. However, as Leeche got to know Raenef better, she found out that he isn&#x27;t at all like the Demon Lord she expected. Her father comes with the actual Demon Lord&#x27;s bride and brings her home, along with the bride after Raenef - by the way of Eclipse - refuses the bride. Before she leaves, she confesses her love for Raenef with a kiss on his lips (Eclipse and Leeche&#x27;s father are shocked and pull them apart quickly). She said that Raenef should wait ten years and that she wouldn&#x27;t forgive him if he finds another girl and marries her.

<doc id="997711" wikidata="Q905346" url="?curid=997711" title="Delta State (TV series)">
<text>Delta State is a fantasy teen animated television series, based on the comic book of the same name by Douglas Gayeton and Matt Rockman featuring four amnesiac roommates with the ability to enter an realm known as the &quot;Delta State&quot;. They face the dual tasks of piecing together their past lives and battling a group of Delta State denizens called Rifters, who seek to control the human mind. The main characters are Claire (Ilona Elkin), Martin (Dusan Dukic), Luna (Lizz Alexander), and Philip (Nicholas Wright).

The series debuted September 11, 2004 on Teletoon (now as Cartoon Network Canada), the Canadian animation-aimed television network. It is the first animated television series to be entirely rotoscoped, taking over 2 ½ years to complete.

Delta State is a Canadian and French co-production with designs, storyboards, etc., done by Alphanim in Paris, Europe. Shooting and recording were provided by Nelvana (initially Cinar [now as WildBrain]) in Montreal. The series was created by Douglas Gayeton, who also directed the original pilot and wrote the bible for the show.

The show has won the Special Award for a TV program at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival, and the Frames 2004 for best Asian Production.

The series aired in France on France 2 and Canal+.

==Synopsis==
Four people each become aware that they possess superhuman abilities of the mind, and are charged by their friend and mentor Professor Brodie with saving the world from Rifter forces. Brodie trains them to battle Rifters in the Delta State, a reference to the brain wave pattern achieved during deep sleep. The main characters, Professor Brodie, and the Rifters are able to enter and exit this state of consciousness at will. As in dreams, rules of physics or logic do not necessarily apply; yet, as in lucid dreaming, a measure of control over the situation can be achieved while in this state.

==Characters==
===The Group===
*Luna Palacios: Red hair in ponytail, 22 years old and of Mexican heritage. She has the power of precognition. She is the only non-white among the group who doesn&#x27;t have control over her power; her visions of the future appear to her either randomly or shortly before the actual event. Luna is described to be shy and reserved. However, it is implied that her personality might have drastically changed after she lost her memories, and she was much more outgoing, carefree and socially confident in her past life. Luna works in a pub where all the characters gather regularly during the series. Before she lost her memories, she was a bank teller at the Bank of Mexico. There was a robbery at the bank and the getaway car hit and killed Carlita, Luna&#x27;s little sister. There is often tension between her and Martin due, apparently, to their past relationship. She is also the one Phillip prefers to confide in with his more sensitive and personal issues.
*Philip Graff: Shaggy black hair, 20 years old, a perpetually unemployed slacker. He has the power of psychometry, the ability to see the past experiences of selected objects. His mother abandoned him on a bus when he was a baby and he grew up in an orphanage. She&#x27;s seen in robes being chased by others in matching robes, suggesting a possible cult membership of some kind, and that Philip&#x27;s birth went against this group&#x27;s beliefs. He has an aversion to lockers, likely because he spent much of third grade being stuffed into them. It&#x27;s later revealed that of the four he was the first one found, and that he&#x27;s the &quot;most special&quot; in the grand scheme of things.
*Claire Donally: Blue hair in buns, 21 years old. She has the power of remote viewing. Now Martin&#x27;s girlfriend. Luna is her best friend. Claire&#x27;s previous boyfriend before she lost her memories was David, who was murdered by a friend named Thomas, because Thomas wanted the full share of the treasure he and David had found while scuba diving. She&#x27;s shown to be the least capable of dealing with the new life/Rifter situation they&#x27;re in.
*Martin Gold: Spiked white hair, 21 years old, and the de facto leader of the group. He has the power of telepathy (mind reading). Presently the boyfriend of Claire, though he was Luna&#x27;s in his past life. He was a baseball catcher before a couple of thugs, hired by his own father (for not also pursuing the family practice), broke his arm, ending his career.
*Professor Robert Brodie: The group&#x27;s guardian and mentor. He was involved in a government project but left. He&#x27;s shown to be able to hold powerful Rifters like Sven at bay.

===Rifters===
*Sven Ragnar: Arguably the most powerful rifter. Commonly assumed to be the &quot;brother&quot; of Maria and heads the acquisition of human minds by rifters. He seeks to kill Brodie, and bears a grudge against Martin. He&#x27;s able to change his appearance, he doesn&#x27;t hesitate to kill people, and is able to kill other rifters, in both the Delta State and in reality. His goal and motivation appears to be world domination.
*Maria Ragnar: Though only female of the &quot;bad guys&quot;, she has deep feelings for Philip and has put herself in danger for him on more than one occasion. She is a powerful rifter in her own right, including the ability to change her appearance in reality, but harbours a healthy fear of Sven&#x27;s power.
*Karla Schneider: The rifter featured in &quot;First Contact&quot; who displeased Sven and was disintegrated for her transgression.
*Professor Stork: A rifter who was expelled by Luna and Philip in &quot;A Case Study.&quot;
*Dr. Ludwig Von Hayek: A mad scientist rifter who worked at Icharus, perfecting cold fusion as an unlimited power source for rifters. Von Hayek was destroyed by Martin, Philip, Luna, and Claire in &quot;Fusion.&quot;
*Louisa Forterre: The girl Philip has fallen for. Philip expels a rifter from her at the end of &quot;The Girlfriend.&quot;
*Aldous Brant: A human possessed by a rifter 15 years until the start of the series. He has Enzio&#x27;s Rachnosis, a neural degenerative disease, and has less than a year to live. The rifter in Aldous Brant took advantage of a situation to jump into Raymond Woodly, leaving Aldous dying in a coma.
*Raymond Woodly: Aldous Brant&#x27;s best friend and campaign manager. Woodly became possessed when a rifter jumped into him from Brant. The Rifter was NOT expelled at the end of &quot;Vote Rifter.&quot;
*Dr. Van Heusen: A rifter destroyed by Philip, Luna, and Claire in &quot;Cabin Fever.&quot;

===Other===
*Dan: Luna&#x27;s boyfriend. He also works with Martin at &quot;Soundz&quot;, a music store. He is shown to be a fairly-skilled computer hacker. Luna states her situation truthfully to him, which he simply believes without hesitation or further question.
*Chantal Thomas: A TV psychic. Brodie described her as &quot;sensitive to the vibrations of the membrane of our reality&quot;. She was found and killed by Sven in &quot;The Reading.&quot;
*Jack Staffer: A friend of Philip&#x27;s. They met when they both worked at Icharus, in &quot;Fusion.&quot;
==Release==
The series was released to DVD soon after its telecast began, with three-episode volumes being released intermediately. &quot;First Contact&quot; (episodes 1 – 3) was released on May 16, 2006, followed by &quot;The Reading&quot; (episodes 4 – 6) on October 10, 2006. The first season, containing all thirteen of its episodes, was made available in a two-disc box set on February 13, 2007. The first season was later re-released by Kaboom! Entertainment on October 6, 2009. As of 2009, the releases are now out of print.

In the late Summer/early Fall 2010, the complete series became available for download from the iTunes Store, however it was later delisted a year later.

The series is currently available to watch on YouTube via Corus&#x27; channel Retro Rerun.

==Production==

=== The Comic ===

The comic was written by Douglas Gayeton, with artwork by Matt Rockman, in 1997 while both worked at Sunshine Amalgamedia. Before the comic released, the rights to it were bought by Alphanim, who commissioned Gayeton to turn the comic into an animated series. He shot the pilot with friends of his in Los Angeles on a shoestring budget and used Macromedia Flash for rotoscoped animation. The pilot would be completed in 2000, one year before the release of &quot;Waking Life&quot;. After writing the original show bible and directing the pilot for the series, Gayeton moved on to other projects, though he remains a fan of the work. As of 2022, The comic and the pilot have yet to be released as they are owned by Alphanim&#x27;s successor Gaumont Animation.

=== The Series ===
The series utilized rotoscoped animation, shot on a budget of $11 million (CAD) with a multicamera setup directed by Wayne Moss, was done using a blue screen studio in Montreal with minimal props and locations. It was also shot in the 16:9 aspect ratio and converted to fullscreen to stretch out the characters. The actors had black lines drawn on their faces to distinguish noses, eyebrows and jawlines and hair was customized in order to make it easy for the animators. The animation was later done in Paris, directed by Pascal David &amp; Giles Cazaux, which used a mix of Flash, Photoshop and After Effects for the series, with character designs being done by Jan Van Rijsselberge. Originally, the series was renewed for a second season and a theatrical film by Alphanim, however, negotiations with Nelvana were broken down, and the project was cancelled, with Nelvana buying out Alphanim&#x27;s share of the series.

==Soundtrack==
The music for the show was composed by French DJ and producer Kid Loco. Only two tracks from the original soundtrack have been released. The first one is the Delta State theme song, which is an extended version of the main theme. The second track is called &quot;Another Snake&quot; and has been released on a compilation CD called &quot;Ethnic Odyssey — Natural Born Travellers&quot; in 2007. Other songs from the show have not been officially released.

<doc id="997715" wikidata="Q385696" url="?curid=997715" title="Spin isomers of hydrogen">
<text>Molecular hydrogen occurs in two isomeric forms, one with its two proton nuclear spins aligned parallel (orthohydrogen), the other with its two proton spins aligned antiparallel (parahydrogen). These two forms can be called &quot;spin isomers&quot; or more specifically &quot;nuclear spin isomers&quot;.

Parahydrogen is in a lower energy state than is orthohydrogen. At room temperature and thermal equilibrium, thermal excitation causes hydrogen to consist of approximately 75% orthohydrogen and 25% parahydrogen. When hydrogen is liquified at low temperature, there is a slow spontaneous transition to a predominantly para ratio, with the released energy having implications for storage. Essentially pure parahydrogen form can be obtained at very low temperatures, but it is not possible to obtain a sample containing more than 75% orthohydrogen by heating.

A mixture or 50:50 mixture of ortho- and parahydrogen can be made in the laboratory by passing it over an iron(III) oxide catalyst at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) or by storing hydrogen at 77 K for 2–3 hours in the presence of activated charcoal. In the absence of a catalyst, gas phase parahydrogen takes days to relax to normal hydrogen at room temperature while it takes hours to do so in organic solvents.

== Nuclear spin states of H2 ==

Each hydrogen molecule () consists of two hydrogen atoms linked by a covalent bond. If we neglect the small proportion of deuterium and tritium which may be present, each hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron. Each proton has an associated magnetic moment, which is associated with the proton&#x27;s spin of . In the molecule, the spins of the two hydrogen nuclei (protons) couple to form a triplet state known as orthohydrogen, and a singlet state known as parahydrogen.

The triplet orthohydrogen state has total nuclear spin &quot;I&quot; = 1 so that the component along a defined axis can have the three values &quot;M&quot;&quot;I&quot; = 1, 0, or −1. The corresponding nuclear spin wavefunctions are formula_1, formula_2 and formula_3. This formalism uses standard bra–ket notation; the symbol ↑ represents the spin-up wavefunction and the symbol ↓ the spin-down wavefunction for a nucleus, so ↑↓ means that the first nucleus is up and the second down. Each orthohydrogen energy level then has a (nuclear) spin degeneracy of three, meaning that it corresponds to three states of the same energy (in the absence of a magnetic field). The singlet parahydrogen state has nuclear spin quantum numbers &quot;I&quot; = 0 and &quot;M&quot;&quot;I&quot; = 0, with wavefunction formula_4. Since there is only one possibility, each parahydrogen level has a spin degeneracy of one and is said to be non-degenerate.

== Allowed rotational energy levels ==
Since protons have spin , they are fermions and the permutational antisymmetry of the total wavefunction imposes restrictions on the possible rotational states of the two forms of . Orthohydrogen, with symmetric nuclear spin functions, can only have rotational wavefunctions that are antisymmetric with respect to permutation of the two protons, corresponding to odd values of the rotational quantum number &quot;J&quot;; conversely, parahydrogen with an antisymmetric nuclear spin function, can only have rotational wavefunctions that are symmetric with respect to permutation of the two protons, corresponding to even &quot;J&quot;.

The para form whose lowest level is &quot;J&quot; = 0 is more stable by 1.455 kJ/mol than the ortho form whose lowest level is &quot;J&quot; = 1. The ratio between numbers of ortho and para molecules is about 3:1 at standard temperature where many rotational energy levels are populated, favoring the ortho form as a result of thermal energy. However, at low temperatures only the &quot;J&quot; = 0 level is appreciably populated, so that the para form dominates at low temperatures (approximately 99.8% at 20 K). The heat of vaporization is only 0.904 kJ/mol. As a result, ortho liquid hydrogen equilibrating to the para form releases enough energy to cause significant loss by boiling.

== Thermal properties ==

Applying the rigid rotor approximation, the energies and degeneracies of the rotational states are given by:

: formula_5.

The rotational partition function is conventionally written as:

: formula_6.

However, as long as the two spin isomers are not in equilibrium, it is more useful to write separate partition functions for each:

: formula_7

The factor of 3 in the partition function for orthohydrogen accounts for the spin degeneracy associated with the +1 spin state; when equilibrium between the spin isomers is possible, then a general partition function incorporating this degeneracy difference can be written as:

: formula_8

The molar rotational energies and heat capacities are derived for any of these cases from:

: formula_9

Plots shown here are molar rotational energies and heat capacities for ortho- and parahydrogen, and the &quot;normal&quot; ortho:para ratio (3:1) and equilibrium mixtures:


Because of the antisymmetry-imposed restriction on possible rotational states, orthohydrogen has residual rotational energy at low temperature wherein nearly all the molecules are in the &quot;J&quot; = 1 state (molecules in the symmetric spin-triplet state cannot fall into the lowest, symmetric rotational state) and possesses nuclear-spin entropy due to the triplet state&#x27;s threefold degeneracy. The residual energy is significant because the rotational energy levels are relatively widely spaced in ; the gap between the first two levels when expressed in temperature units is twice the characteristic rotational temperature for :

: formula_10.

This is the &quot;T&quot; = 0 intercept seen in the molar energy of orthohydrogen. Since &quot;normal&quot; room-temperature hydrogen is a 3:1 ortho:para mixture, its molar residual rotational energy at low temperature is (3/4) × 2&quot;Rθ&quot;rot ≈ 1091 J/mol, which is somewhat larger than the enthalpy of vaporization of normal hydrogen, 904 J/mol at the boiling point, &quot;T&quot;b ≈ 20.369 K. Notably, the boiling points of parahydrogen and normal (3:1) hydrogen are nearly equal; for parahydrogen ∆Hvap ≈ 898 J/mol at &quot;T&quot;b ≈ 20.277 K, and it follows that nearly all the residual rotational energy of orthohydrogen is retained in the liquid state.

However, orthohydrogen is thermodynamically unstable at low temperatures and spontaneously converts into parahydrogen. This process lacks any natural de-excitation radiation mode, so it is slow in the absence of a catalyst which can facilitate interconversion of the singlet and triplet spin states. At room temperature, hydrogen contains 75% orthohydrogen, a proportion which the liquefaction process preserves if carried out in the absence of a catalyst like ferric oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds, chromic oxide, or some nickel compounds to accelerate the conversion of the liquid hydrogen into parahydrogen. Alternatively, additional refrigeration equipment can be used to slowly absorb the heat that the orthohydrogen fraction will (more slowly) release as it spontaneously converts into parahydrogen. If orthohydrogen is not removed from rapidly liquified hydrogen, without a catalyst, the heat released during its decay can boil off as much as 50% of the original liquid.

== History ==
The unusual heat capacity of hydrogen was discovered in 1912 by Arnold Eucken. The two forms of molecular hydrogen were first proposed by Werner Heisenberg and Friedrich Hund in 1927. Taking into account this theoretical framework, pure parahydrogen was first synthesized by Paul Harteck and Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer in 1929 at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry. When Heisenberg was awarded the 1932 Nobel prize in physics for the creation of quantum mechanics, this discovery of the &quot;allotropic forms of hydrogen&quot; was singled out as its most noteworthy application. Further work on the properties and chemical reactivity of parahydrogen was carried out in the following decade by Elly Schwab-Agallidis and Georg-Maria Schwab. 

== Uses ==
=== In infrared spectroscopy ===
Isolation of pure parahydrogen uses continuous in-vacuum deposition, resulting in millimeters thick solid parahydrogen (p–) samples which are notable for their excellent optical qualities. Parahydrogen is used as a host for matrix isolation studies: since hydrogen interacts weakly with other molecules, the infrared spectrum of these molecules embedded in parahydrogen films has sharp linewidths.

=== In NMR and MRI===
When an excess of parahydrogen is used during hydrogenation reactions (instead of the normal mixture of orthohydrogen to parahydrogen of 3:1), the resultant product exhibits hyperpolarized signals in proton NMR spectra, an effect termed PHIP (Parahydrogen Induced Polarisation) or, equivalently, PASADENA (Parahydrogen And Synthesis Allow Dramatically Enhanced Nuclear Alignment; named for first recognition of the effect by Bowers and Weitekamp of Caltech), a phenomenon that has been used to study the mechanism of hydrogenation reactions.

Signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) is a technique to hyperpolarize samples without chemically modifying them. Compared to orthohydrogen or organic molecules, a much greater fraction of the hydrogen nuclei in parahydrogen align with an applied magnetic field. In SABRE, a metal center reversibly binds to both the test molecule and a parahydrogen molecule facilitating the target molecule to pick up the polarization of the parahydrogen. This technique can be improved and utilized for a wide range of organic molecules by using an intermediate &quot;relay&quot; molecule like ammonia. The ammonia efficiently binds to the metal center and picks up the polarization from the parahydrogen. The ammonia then transfers the polarization to other molecules that don&#x27;t bind as well to the metal catalyst. This enhanced NMR signal allows the rapid analysis of very small amounts of material and has great potential for applications in magnetic resonance imaging.

==Deuterium==
Diatomic deuterium () has nuclear spin isomers like diatomic hydrogen, but with different populations of the two forms because the deuterium nucleus (deuteron) is a boson with nuclear spin equal to one. There are six possible nuclear spin wave functions which are ortho or symmetric to exchange of the two nuclei, and three which are para or antisymmetric. Ortho states correspond to even rotational levels with symmetric rotational functions so that the total wavefunction is symmetric as required for the exchange of two bosons, and para states correspond to odd rotational levels. The ground state (&quot;J&quot; = 0) populated at low temperature is ortho, and at standard temperature the ortho:para ratio is 2:1.

== Other substances with spin isomers ==
Other molecules and functional groups containing two hydrogen atoms, such as water and methylene (CH2), also have ortho- and para- forms (e.g. orthowater and parawater), but this is of little significance for their thermal properties. Their ortho:para ratios differ from that of dihydrogen. The ortho and para forms of water have recently been isolated. Para water was found to be 25% more reactive for a proton-transfer reaction.

Molecular oxygen () also exists in three lower-energy triplet states and one singlet state, as ground-state paramagnetic triplet oxygen and energized highly reactive diamagnetic singlet oxygen. These states arise from the spins of their unpaired electrons, not their protons or nuclei.

<doc id="997730" wikidata="Q3328726" url="?curid=997730" title="Doris Haddock">
<text>Doris &quot;Granny D&quot; Haddock (born Ethel Doris Rollins; January 24, 1910 – March 9, 2010) was an American political activist from New Hampshire. Haddock achieved national fame when, between the ages of 88 and 90, starting on January 1, 1999, and culminating on February 29, 2000, she walked over across the continental United States to advocate for campaign finance reform. In 2004, she ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic challenger to incumbent Republican Judd Gregg in the U.S. Senate election in New Hampshire.

Haddock&#x27;s walk across the country followed a southern route and took more than a year to complete, starting on January 1, 1999, in southern California and ending in Washington, D.C., on February 29, 2000.

Haddock requested a name change of her middle name to &quot;Granny D&quot;, the name by which she had long been known. On August 19, 2004, Haddock&#x27;s request was officially granted by Judge John Maher during a hearing at the Cheshire County probate court.

==Personal life==
Ethel Doris Rollins was born in Laconia, New Hampshire, the daughter of Ethel and Carl Rollins. She attended Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts, for three years before marrying James Haddock. Emerson students were not allowed to marry at that time, so she was expelled. She was, however, later awarded an honorary degree in 2000.

After marrying, she started a family; she had a daughter, Betty and a son, James Jr.. She worked during the Great Depression and was employed for twenty years as an executive secretary in the offices of the BeeBee Shoe factory in Manchester, New Hampshire. Haddock and her husband retired to Dublin, New Hampshire, in 1972. Her husband later developed Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, dying after a ten-year struggle with the illness. At about the same time, Haddock&#x27;s best friend died. During her 1999 walk across the nation, the hat that Haddock was seen in was one that belonged originally to her best friend. Haddock had eight grandchildren: Heidi, Gillian, David Bradley, William, Alice, Joseph, Lawrence, and Raphael. She also had 16 great-grandchildren: Kyle, David, Jennie, Kendall, Peyton, Matthew, Richard, Grace, Justin, William, James, Beatrix, Tucker, Mathilda, Parker, and Clay.

Haddock celebrated her 100th birthday on January 24, 2010, and died six weeks later on March 9, 2010, at her son&#x27;s home in Dublin, New Hampshire, following a bout with respiratory illness.

She was a life-long member of the United Methodist Church.

==Activist career==
In 1960, Haddock began her political activism when she and her husband successfully campaigned against planned hydrogen bomb nuclear testing in Alaska that threatened an Inuit fishing village at Point Hope. The couple retired to Dublin, New Hampshire, in 1972, and there, she served on the Planning Board and was active in the community.

===Campaign finance reform advocate===

After the first efforts of Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold to regulate campaign finances through eliminating soft money failed in 1995, Granny D became increasingly interested in campaign finance reform and spearheaded a petition movement. On January 1, 1999, at the age of 88, Granny D left the Rose Bowl Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California, in an attempt to walk across the United States to raise awareness of and attract support for campaign finance reform.

Granny D walked roughly ten miles each day for 14 months, traversing California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, making many speeches along the way. The trek attracted a great deal of attention in the mass media. When Granny D arrived in Washington, D.C., she was 90 years old (having begun the journey at 88 and having two birthdays en route), had traveled more than 3,200 miles, and was greeted in the capital by a crowd of 2,200 people. Several dozen members of Congress walked the final miles with her during the final day&#x27;s walk from Arlington National Cemetery to the Capitol on the National Mall. A film, &quot;Granny D
Goes to Washington,&quot; by Alidra Solday, documents her walk across America, and was broadcast on PBS stations nationwide, 2006-2008.

In the 2000 presidential election, Haddock endorsed Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.

Haddock worked closely with state representative Betty Hall, another New Hampshire grandmother, on campaign finance reform.

===Arrest at the Capitol===
On April 21, 2000, 90 year old Granny D, with 31 other Americans, was arrested for reading the Declaration of Independence in the Capitol and charged with the offense of Demonstrating in the Capitol Building. It was said to be a peaceable assembly, but the demonstrators were arrested by Capitol Police.

She entered a plea of guilty, then made a statement to the court reiterating &quot;campaign finance reform&quot; as the purpose of their demonstration.

The judge sentenced Granny D and her companions to time served and a $10 administrative fee.

==Post-election==

&quot;Granny D&quot; co-authored several books with Dennis Burke. These include &quot;Granny D: Walking Across America in My Ninetieth Year&quot; (Villard, 2001), &quot;Granny D: You&#x27;re Never Too Old to Raise a Little Hell&quot; (Villard, 2003), and &quot;Granny D&#x27;s American Century (University Press of New England&quot;, 2012). She was awarded an honorary degree by Franklin Pierce College on October 21, 2002. In 2005, she gave the commencement speech at Hampshire College. 

She was the Democratic candidate for a U.S. Senate seat in New Hampshire during the 2004 election when the leading Democratic primary candidate left the race unexpectedly (days before the filing deadline), because of a campaign-finance scandal. Haddock was, at 94, one of the oldest major-party candidates to ever run for the U.S. Senate. True to her &quot;clean elections&quot; ideals, Haddock funded her late-entry campaign by accepting only modest private-citizen donations. She captured approximately 34 percent of the vote (221,549), losing to incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Judd Gregg, as he sought his third term. Gregg won about 66 percent (434,847) of the ballot. 

In 2007, HBO released a documentary, &quot;Run Granny Run&quot;, directed by Marlo Poras, about &quot;Granny D&quot;&#x27;s 2004 Senate campaign. In 2009, she founded Coalition for Open Democracy. Granny D continued to be active in politics to the end of her life, and celebrated her 98th, 99th and 100th birthdays by lobbying for campaign finance reform at the New Hampshire State House.

<text>Arthur Roy Brown, (23 December 1893 – 9 March 1944) was a Canadian flying ace of the First World War, credited with ten aerial victories. The Royal Air Force officially credited Brown with shooting down Manfred von Richthofen, the &quot;Red Baron&quot;, although historians, doctors, and ballistics experts consider it all but certain that Richthofen was actually killed by a machine gunner firing from the ground.

==Early years==
Brown was born to upper-middle-class parents in Carleton Place, west of Ottawa. His family home still exists, located at 38 Mill Street, just down from the Town Hall. Another source, the Carleton Place and Beckwith Heritage Museum, refers to the family home as being on Judson Street, and says that this was his birthplace. That house also still exists. He was the middle of five children. He had two older sisters, Margaret and Bessie, and two younger brothers, Horace and Howard. His father had started business as a miller, but branched out into electrical generation when the first power grids were being set up around the start of the 20th century. His father eventually owned a power company in the town.

Though Brown did well in high school, he transferred to a business school to study accounting to eventually take over the family business. Following this course, he wanted to continue to university to study business administration, but he needed to have graduated from high school which he had not done. He took a course at the Victoria High School in Edmonton from 1913 to 1915 to get his high-school diploma. There he befriended Wilfrid R. &quot;Wop&quot; May.

==Flight training==
Brown enlisted in 1914 as an Officer Cadet at the Army Officers&#x27; Training. As a prerequisite to joining the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS), Brown received flight training at the Wright Flying School near Dayton, Ohio, from September to November 1914. He was awarded Aero Club of America Pilot&#x27;s Certificate No. 361 on 13 November, and was confirmed as a flight sub-lieutenant in the RNAS on the 15th.

==Wartime service==
Brown set sail for England on 22 November 1914 and underwent further training at Chingford Aerodrome. On 2 May 1916, Brown crashed his Avro 504 emerging apparently unscathed, though next morning he experienced severe back pain as he had broken a vertebra. He spent two months in hospital and in September 1916 was posted to Eastchurch Gunnery School. In January 1917, he was sent to Cranwell to complete advanced training.

In March 1917, Brown was posted to No. 9 Naval Squadron, flying coastal patrols off the Belgian coast in Sopwith Pups. In April, &quot;B&quot; Flight, which included Brown, was attached to the Army&#x27;s Royal Flying Corps to assist during the Battle of Arras. Brown fell ill at this time and missed &quot;Bloody April&quot;, a period when British casualties were very high.

In June 1917, Brown was posted to No. 11 Naval Squadron, and in July he was briefly posted to No. 4 Naval Squadron before returning to No. 11 Naval Squadron later that month. On 17 July, he achieved his first &quot;kill&quot;, an Albatros D.III, while flying a Pup, and gathered another three unconfirmed kills.

No. 11 was disbanded in mid-August 1917, and Brown returned to No. 9, equipped with the Sopwith Camel. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 October, and on 6 October, Brown was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). His citation read:
Soon after, Brown was made a flight commander, a role in which he excelled. No. 9 was posted to the Somme area in early 1918, and was forced to retreat during the German spring offensive between 20 and 29 March. The tempo of operations increased, with the entire squadron typically flying two missions a day. Colonel Raymond Collishaw noted on an April visit that Brown looked exhausted: he had lost , his hair was prematurely turning grey, and his eyes were bloodshot and sunken. Also eating contaminated rabbit had left him severely sickened with gastritis. Against Collishaw&#x27;s suggestions, Brown refused to quit flying, and shot down another two aircraft on 11 and 12 April.

On 1 April 1918, the RFC and RNAS were merged into the Royal Air Force. Brown&#x27;s No. 9 Squadron RNAS became No. 209 Squadron RAF.

==Fighting the Red Baron==


On the morning of 21 April 1918, No. 209 was on patrol when they became engaged in combat with fighters of &quot;Jagdstaffel 11&quot;, led by Manfred von Richthofen, the &quot;Red Baron&quot;. A newcomer to No. 209, Brown&#x27;s school friend, Lieutenant Wilfrid &quot;Wop&quot; May, had been instructed to stay clear of any fight and watch. May noticed an enemy pilot doing the same thing. That pilot was the Red Baron&#x27;s cousin, Lt. Wolfram von Richthofen, who had been given the same instructions as May. May attacked Wolfram and soon found himself in the main fight, firing at several fleeting targets until his guns jammed. May dived out of the fight, and Manfred von Richthofen gave chase down to ground level. Brown saw May in trouble and dived steeply in an attempt to rescue his friend. His attack was necessarily of fairly short duration, as he was obliged to climb steeply to avoid crashing into the ground, losing sight for the moment of both Richthofen and May.

What happened next remains controversial to this day, but it seems highly probable that Richthofen turned to avoid Brown&#x27;s attack, and then, instead of climbing out of reach of ground fire and prudently heading for home, remained at low altitude and resumed his pursuit of May, who was still zig-zagging, as he had not noticed that Richthofen had been momentarily distracted. It would have been physically impossible for Richthofen to have done this had he already received the wound from which he died. May and Richthofen&#x27;s route now took them at low level over the heavily defended Allied front line. Franks and Bennett have suggested that Richthofen had become lost, as the winds that day were blowing the &quot;wrong way&quot;, towards the west, and the fight had drifted over to the Allied side. The front was also in a highly fluid state at the time, in contrast to the more common static trench lines earlier in the Great War, and landmarks can be confusing in very low level flight.

Australian machine gunners on the ground fired at Richthofen, who eventually crashed near the Australian trenches. Brown&#x27;s initial combat report was that the fight with Richthofen was &quot;indecisive&quot; – this was altered by his commanding officer to &quot;decisive&quot;. Modern historical consensus suggests that Australian anti-aircraft gunner Sergeant Cedric Popkin is the person most likely to have been responsible for the shot that actually downed the Baron.

Brown was officially credited with the kill by the RAF, shortly after receiving a Bar to his DSC, at least partly in recognition of this feat. The citation read:
==Later years==
Nine days after the combat with von Richthofen, Brown was admitted to hospital with influenza and nervous exhaustion. In June, he was posted to No. 2 School of Air Fighting at Marske Aerodrome, as an instructor. He was involved in a bad air crash on 15 July, and spent five months in hospital.

Brown left the RAF in 1919 and returned to Canada where he took up work as an accountant at a small town grocery store and later moved to Toronto to work at Imperial Varnish and Color Company until he retired in 1934. He also founded a small airline in 1928, General Airways Limited in Amos, Quebec and in same year married Edythe Moneypenny. Brown worked for a while as editor of &quot;Canadian Aviation&quot;. When the Second World War broke out, he attempted to enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force, but was refused. He instead entered politics, losing an election for the Ontario legislature in 1943. The Browns moved to Stouffville in 1939 and in 1943 purchased a dairy farm at Bethesda Road and Warden Avenue near Stouffville, Ontario (now part of the property of Rolling Hills Golf Club). Brown was inducted into the Canadian Aviation Hall of Fame in 2015.

Brown died on 9 March 1944, of a heart attack, in Stouffville, Ontario shortly after posing for a photograph with a current Canadian flying ace, George Beurling. He was 50 years old. He is buried, with his wife, Edythe, in the Toronto Necropolis.

==Memorials, tributes and relics==
In 1918, Brown acquired the seat of the Fokker Dr.| triplane in which Richthofen made his final flight; in 1920 he donated his souvenir to the Royal Canadian Military Institute.

A memorial plaque titled &quot;Captain A. Roy Brown, D.S.C. 1893–1944&quot;, was erected at the Carleton Place Public Library by the Ontario Heritage Foundation, in memory of Brown.

In November 2012, the town of Carleton Place further paid tribute to Brown with a prominent mural on the town&#x27;s main street. A museum dedicated to Brown was also opened in Carleton Place.

In 2015, Brown was posthumously inducted into Canada&#x27;s Aviation Hall of Fame.

In 2016, a new headstone was erected for Brown in the Toronto Necropolis. The stone was unveiled by his nieces, Carol Nicholson and Nadine Carter.

On 28 November 2020, a bronze statue depicting Arthur Roy Brown was unveiled in Carleton Place. The most beloved son of the town, the statue sits in a park facing the Mississippi Lake close to the Roy Brown Museum and the mural of the famous dogfight (deadly air battles).

==Brown in film and fiction==
Although Roy Brown has left a much smaller mark in popular culture than Manfred von Richthofen&#x27;s, his legacy is remembered sporadically.

Brown was a minor character in Karl Ritter&#x27;s 1938 film, &quot;Pour Le Merite&quot;. He is shown as a captured aviator who shares a meal with the German squadron that shot him down. He then is allowed to escape. 

Brown was portrayed by Don Stroud in the 1971 film &quot;Von Richthofen and Brown&quot;. He is depicted as a cynical, cocky, ruthless rebel without a cause who doesn&#x27;t believe in honour. He bullies his way to leadership and has his squadron hunt in packs with a plane as bait. This movie depicts Brown being responsible for Richthofen&#x27;s death.

In the 2008 film &quot;The Red Baron&quot;, he was portrayed by Joseph Fiennes. He is depicted as Richthofen&#x27;s rival, being shot down by Richthofen early on in the film and subsequently escaping from a German Prisoner of War camp. In a dogfight later, Brown and Richthofen are forced to ditch their aircraft in no man&#x27;s land, where they share a friendly drink. At the end of the film, Brown assists Richthofen&#x27;s fictional love interest, Käte Otersdorf, in crossing into allied lines to visit his grave.

<doc id="997743" wikidata="Q8056611" url="?curid=997743" title="You're Welcome (Angel)">
<text>&quot;You&#x27;re Welcome&quot; is the twelfth episode of the fifth season of the American television series &quot;Angel&quot;. Written and directed by David Fury, it is the 100th episode of the series, and originally broadcast on February 4, 2004 on the WB network. In &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome,&quot; former series regular Charisma Carpenter returns as a guest star, when the character of Cordelia Chase miraculously awakens from her coma. It is her duty to put Angel, who has recently been feeling ineffective at fighting the powers of darkness, back on the right path. Meanwhile, Angel&#x27;s old enemy Lindsey McDonald has resurfaced and is plotting revenge. This episode features the death and final onscreen appearance of Cordelia.

The episode was written to reinforce the show&#x27;s earlier themes, and examine the evolution of the characters in the show&#x27;s one hundred episodes. The original plan was for Sarah Michelle Gellar to return as Buffy Summers, but when she could not appear due to the death of her aunt and work obligations, it instead focused on rounding off the character of Cordelia. The episode proved generally popular with critics, who praised Charisma Carpenter&#x27;s final performance as Cordelia and the sense of resolution for the character.

==Plot==
Cordelia emerges from her coma after experiencing a vision of the symbols painted on Eve&#x27;s apartment door and tattooed on Lindsey&#x27;s chest. After Angel and Wesley collect Cordelia from the hospital, she reveals that the vision which woke her from the coma showed Angel in peril. She finds the symbols from her vision in a book, and Wesley recognizes them as runes to protect and conceal, effective against surveillance. Cordelia apologizes to Wesley for killing Lilah while under Jasmine&#x27;s control.

Spike complains to Lindsey (who is impersonating Doyle) that the deranged slayer chopped off his hands. Lindsey reveals he also had one of his hands severed. Spike bites Cordelia until Angel fights him off. Spike explains he was tasting whether she was evil, as his source claimed. Angel questions the source, and Spike says it was Doyle. Angel confronts Eve, suggesting she is working with the Doyle impersonator manipulating Spike. Eve confesses that Lindsey is activating a fail-safe left by the Senior Partners to destroy Angel. When Spike mentions &quot;Doyle&quot; had a hand chopped off, Angel deduces that &quot;Doyle&quot; is Lindsey. Angel battles Lindsey, who is strengthened by his runes. While Angel and Lindsey fight, Cordelia disables the fail-safe. Wesley and Fred perform a spell that causes Lindsey&#x27;s tattoos to disappear, making him visible to the Senior Partners. Lindsey is sucked into a portal.

Angel and Cordelia say their goodbyes and share a kiss. Angel receives a phone call informing him that Cordelia has died. He realizes, with teary eyes, that Cordelia never awoke from her coma.

==Production==
The fight scene between Lindsey and Angel in the underground chamber, which took three days to film, was written by Steven S. DeKnight. Christian Kane, who went through months of sword training for his role in &quot;Secondhand Lions&quot;, approached the writers to see if they could work his new skills into the episode; Kane ended up performing his own stunts for the sword fight sequence, including wire work.
He also did his own stunts for the scene when Lindsey moves through the lasers in the tunnel, which were not CGI, but actual lasers. During the fight scene between Eve and Harmony, Sarah Thompson says Mercedes McNab slapped her accidentally. &quot;She was... so worried she&#x27;d hurt me but it actually worked well for the take because I reacted by really screaming,&quot; Thompson says.

David Boreanaz had just had knee surgery prior to filming, so writer David Fury did his best to keep Angel sitting down as much as possible. Fury used tight camera angles during Spike&#x27;s apartment scene with Lindsey to disguise the fact that the same set was used earlier for the opening teaser. &quot;Everything is a bit contained; the reason is if I turn around, this is where they found the dead nuns,&quot; Fury explains.

===Writing===
Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the &quot;mission statement&quot; of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to - through Cordelia, who was &quot;there at the beginning&quot; - ask of Angel, &quot;Where are you now? Where were you when you started and where are you now and how do you feel about that?&quot; The return to the show&#x27;s &quot;original concerns&quot; is echoed by the flashback to Doyle&#x27;s first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel &quot;You forgot who you are,&quot; bringing back the show&#x27;s link to the city. This episode, written as a stand-alone as per the network&#x27;s request, also sets up a critical plot-thread for the season arc that &quot;will begin to reveal itself toward the end of the season,&quot; Whedon says.
The character of Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode, focusing on the rivalry between Angel and Spike and their feelings for Buffy, but Sarah Michelle Gellar was unavailable. Writer/director David Fury explains that since &quot;we couldn&#x27;t get Sarah,&quot; the episode was instead written for Cordelia Chase. He adds, &quot;This turned out to be a Godsend because Charisma was fantastic.&quot; In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because &quot;the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn&#x27;t want to tip it too soon,&quot; says Fury.

Christian Kane was genuinely upset when an addition by Joss Whedon in the script called for Angel to refer to Lindsey as a &quot;tiny Texan.&quot; Although born in Texas, Kane identifies as a &quot;Sooner&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m stronger than David, bigger than David, I&#x27;m just shorter.&quot; Kane says Joss &quot;likes to take shots at me. He&#x27;s like, &#x27;I can&#x27;t build this character up too much without cutting his nuts just a little bit.&#x27;&quot;

Carpenter says she was satisfied with the way her character left the show, as she feels Cordelia&#x27;s story has been fully resolved. Creator Joss Whedon agreed, saying, &quot;In seven years, we&#x27;d sort of run through our course of [the] character and didn&#x27;t want to start just doing hollow riffs on what we&#x27;d done.&quot; Since Whedon suspected this season would be the last, Carpenter says, &quot;we didn&#x27;t want to just leave Cordelia in a coma..this would be a very big story left untold.&quot; Carpenter says the 100th episode was a momentous time to have her character die, calling it &quot;bittersweet...a love letter to Cordelia&quot; and the story &quot;one of the sweetest they&#x27;d ever told.&quot; David Fury agrees: &quot;It&#x27;s a beautiful farewell to Charisma for the series&quot; and it gives &quot;Charisma a send off that was respectful to her and Cordelia Chase. I was very proud to have my name on it.&quot;

Actor Christian Kane says he had a difficult time calling himself &#x27;Doyle&#x27; because he felt on some level he was masquerading as deceased Glenn Quinn. &quot;It was a very awkward situation for me and David because we were close to Glenn,&quot; says Kane. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know how the fans were going to react to it.&quot; Kane says the memory of Quinn upset Boreanaz: &quot;I could see it in his eyes... it’s got to be a tough deal for him.&quot; However, Kane thinks that &quot;Joss is brilliant because he used that. How do you turn me and David against each other? You really can’t because we’re such close friends. So to use that for Angel and Lindsey, I think has a little bit of brilliance to it. It’s kind of sick...but it did the job.&quot; David Fury adds, &quot;I think [the fans] appreciated it from the standpoint that we were honoring him. That Doyle&#x27;s not a forgotten piece of this world.&quot;

==Reception==
This episode was rated as one of the series&#x27; top five episodes in a poll done by &quot;Angel Magazine&quot;. TV Guide praised Charisma Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;blithe comic delivery&quot;; the BBC noted that Carpenter&#x27;s return elevated the script from &quot;merely great to something close to awesome,&quot; but griped because the show&#x27;s tight budget left Lindsey&#x27;s activation of the fail-safe an &quot;unfulfilled promise.&quot;

Reaction to the death of long-time character Cordelia was generally positive. After being disgusted by Cordelia&#x27;s fourth season arc, which she claims &quot;destroyed Cordy&#x27;s character and viewer trust&quot;, author Jennifer Crusie applauds this episode. &quot;The writers play fair,&quot; she says, &quot;foreshadowing the Gotcha to come&quot; - Cordelia is in a private room, yet hastily draws the curtains around a bed-ridden roommate, and remarks to Angel that she understands why Doyle used his &quot;last breath to make sure [Angel] kept fighting.&quot; Rather than undercutting the emotional impact of the story, the twist of Cordelia&#x27;s tragic ending reinforces and honors her character. &quot;She is...our Cordy again,&quot; Crusie says. Cordelia exits the series &quot;needed, loved, and wanted&quot;; her final words are &quot;You&#x27;re welcome,&quot; Janine R. Harrison argues, because &quot;she &quot;knows&quot; her worth.&quot;

<doc id="997762" wikidata="Q379898" url="?curid=997762" title="Ezana of Axum">
<text>Ezana (, &quot;‘Ezana&quot;, unvocalized ዐዘነ &quot;‘zn&quot;), (, &quot;Aezana&quot;) was the ruler of the Kingdom of Aksum (320s – ). One of the best-documented rulers of Aksum, Ezana is important as he is the country&#x27;s first king to embrace Christianity and make it the official religion. Tradition states that Ezana succeeded his father Ella Amida (Ousanas) as king while still a child but his mother, Sofya then served as regent until he came of age.

==Reign==

Ezana was the first monarch of the Kingdom of Aksum to embrace Christianity, after his slave-teacher, Frumentius, converted him. He was the first monarch after Zoskales to be mentioned by contemporary historians, a situation that lead Stuart Munro-Hay to comment that he was &quot;the most famous of the Aksumite kings before Kaleb.&quot; In early life he considered himself a son of Ares, but later inscriptions show a growing attachment to Christianity. His childhood tutor, the Syrian Christian Frumentius, became head of the Ethiopian Church. A surviving letter from the Arian Roman emperor Constantius II is addressed to ‘Ezana and his brother Saizana and requests that Frumentius be sent to Alexandria to be examined for doctrinal errors and be replaced by Theophilos the Indian; Munro-Hay assumes that ‘Ezana either refused or ignored this request.

Ezana also launched several military campaigns, which he recorded in his inscriptions. A pair of inscriptions on a stela in Ge&#x27;ez found at Meroë is thought of as evidence of a campaign in the fourth century, either during Ezana&#x27;s reign, or by a predecessor like Ousanas. While some authorities interpret these inscriptions as proof that the Aksumites destroyed the kingdom of Meroë, others say that archaeological evidence points to an economic and political decline in Meroë around 300. Moreover, some view the stela as military aid from Axum to Meroë to quell the revolt and rebellion by the Nuba. However, conclusive evidence and proof as to which view is correct is not currently available.

On some of the Aksumite coins minted during ‘Ezana&#x27;s reign appears the motto in Greek &quot;ΤΟΥΤΟ ΑΡΕΣΗ ΤΗ ΧΩΡΑ&quot; – &quot;May this please the country&quot;. Munro-Hay comments that this motto is &quot;a rather attractive peculiarity of Aksumite coinage, giving a feeling of royal concern and responsibility towards the people&#x27;s wishes and contentment&quot;. A number of coins minted bearing his name were found in the late 1990s at archaeological sites in India, indicating trade contacts in that country. A remarkable feature of the coins is a shift from a pagan motif with disc and crescent to a design with a cross. ‘Ezana is also credited for erecting several stelae and obelisks. An inscription in Greek gives the regnal claims of Ezana:
Ezana is unknown in the King Lists even though the coins bear this name. According to tradition, Emperors Abreha and Asbeha ruled Ethiopia when Christianity was introduced. It may be that these names were later applied to ‘Ezana and his brother or that these were their baptismal names.

== Veneration ==
Along with his brother, Saizan (Sazan), Ezana (Aizan) is regarded as a saint by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Catholic Church, with a feast day of the first of October and on 27 October.

<text>Benning Road is a major traveled street in Washington, D.C., and Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland.

The street&#x27;s western terminus is at the &quot;Starburst intersection&quot; in the northeast quadrant of the city at Bladensburg Road, Florida Avenue, Maryland Avenue, H Street and 15th Street. It passes over the Anacostia River via the Ethel Kennedy Bridge into the neighborhood of Benning. It continues southeast across East Capitol Street into the southeast quadrant, crossing Southern Avenue and the D.C.-Maryland boundary into Maryland, ending at an intersection with Marlboro Pike (a former alignment of Maryland Route 4).

==History==
In the late 18th century, &quot;Captain&quot; William Benning came from Virginia and purchased in the area. Around 1830 (though not all sources agree on the date), he bought what was then known as the Anacostia Bridge or the Upper Bridge as a toll bridge, one of the earliest crossings over the Anacostia River. The bridge would later be known as &quot;Benning Bridge.&quot; &quot;Benning&#x27;s Road&quot; appears on maps as far back as 1861, and the bridge was an important eastern route in and out of the District. An 1886 U.S. Geological Survey map shows Benning&#x27;s Road ending at &quot;Bowen Road&quot;, which was later named Marlboro Pike in Maryland (and routed as Maryland Route 4 through about 1960).

In 1920, the Army Corps of Engineers used material dredged from the Anacostia to build Kingman Island and Kingman Lake, which Benning Road crossed over top of. Previously it had crossed the mudflats along the Anacostia on a causeway. In 1929, a concrete culvert was installed under Benning Road to create a connection between the two sections of Kingman Lake. At the time, 92% of the city&#x27;s electricity passed under the road and the WB&amp;A railroad ran along it. The bridge created by the culvert was replaced in 2000

In 1955, the department of transportation built two ramps connecting Benning Road to DC-295. In 1988, the ramp from 295 to Benning road was rehabilitated.
Benning Road was long bisected by railroad lines owned by the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad and the B&amp;O Railroad. In 1917 work began on the Benning Road Viaduct and Bridge that would carry the road over the tracks. That work was completed in 1919. In 1937, the road was widened and a 2nd viaduct built next to the 1919 one. The old one became the eastbound bridge and the new one the westbound bridge. The westbound bridge was replaced in 1959 and the eastbound bridge in 1961, because the existing bridges could no longer carry the necessary weight. The westbound bridge had its entire deck removed and replaced in 1982 and the eastbound bridge deck was replaced in 1988. In 2007, the District Council voted to rename the Benning Road Viaduct and Bridge (by then called the &quot;Benning Road Bridge&quot;) over the railroad tracks between 34th Street, N. E., and Minnesota Avenue, N. E. the Lorraine H. Whitlock Memorial Bridge. In 2020, the name was removed from the bridge by the same act that renamed a DC School for Whitlock.

In 2008, the Benning Road Bridge over the Anacostia was renamed the Ethel Kennedy Bridge after the widow of the late Robert F. Kennedy, for whom a nearby stadium was named. In a May 20, 2014 ceremony, the bridge was officially renamed the Ethel Kennedy Bridge to honor her for her devotion to many social and environmental causes during her later years, especially in the neighborhoods along and near the Anacostia River.

In 2009, work commenced on a $38 million improvement project for the road which included adding streetcar tracks. The DC Streetcar line was anticipated to open in 2014, but it did not actually open until February 27, 2016.

A Metro station was opened at the intersection of Benning Road and East Capitol Street in 1980 but this is not within easy walking distance of the local facilities as the neighborhood has a suburban style with access mainly by automobile.

<text>State Route 620 in Fairfax and Loudoun Counties, Virginia is a secondary state highway. The entire length of SR 620 is also known as Braddock Road (except for a small section in Centreville called Spindle Court). SR 620 also has a short concurrency with SR 659 / Union Mill Road in Centreville.

In Centreville and Eastern Loudoun County, SR 620 is a major commuter route, as it empties onto SR 28 (Sully Rd.), which in turn has a nearby interchange with Interstate 66. SR 620 also has major junctions with SR 123, Fairfax County Parkway, and Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway). It has a very large number of residential neighborhoods lining the road, so most of the remainder is also a major commuter artery. The length and positioning of the highway attract motorists that are traveling from one part of Fairfax County to another.

== Route description ==

===East and Central Fairfax County===

SR 620 begins in Fairfax County at Columbia Pike (SR 244) near Lake Barcroft and runs southward, crossing the Little River Turnpike. It then intersects the Capital Beltway, Interstate 495. SR 620, heading westward at this point, then passes north of Burke and intersects SR 123 near George Mason University. It remains well south of Fairfax City and meets the freeway portion of Fairfax County Parkway. It then intersects SR 645 (Clifton Road) in Clifton, and next meets Union Mill Road. At this point, the road becomes New Braddock Road and SR 7783. New Braddock Road continues to SR 28.

===In Centreville===
While New Braddock Road continues straight, SR 620 itself is concurrent with SR 659 / Union Mill Road for one block. A new segment of Braddock Road (which shortly matches the old alignment of Braddock Road) starts here and heads west into Centreville. However, SR 620 quickly turns off onto a side-street, Spindle Court, and unceremoniously dead-ends behind Mountain View Alternative High School, creating another gap. The road that was SR 620 continues ahead as Old Braddock Road, SR 7759. Old Braddock Road continues ahead to Old Centreville Road (SR 898). That road connects to the beginning of the third segment of Braddock Road, which is located at a four-way intersection with US 29. This third segment was originally connected with what is now Spindle Court, but when a shopping center was built, a dead end on Braddock Road was created, and was renamed Spindle Ct. This segment only lasts for 0.32 mile, before turning into Pickwick Road (SR 1021).

===Western Fairfax County===
Braddock Road picks up again on the other side of I-66, at an intersection with SR 28. This fourth segment of SR 620 continues to the northwest, through several residential areas. It intersects with SR 609 (Pleasant Valley Road) and enters Loudoun County.

===Loudoun County===
Keeping the SR 620 designation, Braddock Road forms the southern border of South Riding where it intersects with and is the southern terminus of Loudoun County Parkway, SR 606. It then intersects with SR 659 (Gum Spring Road). It ends at the roundabout with SR 705 (Lightridge Farm Rd.) in Stone Ridge. Braddock Road, now designated SR 705, continues northwest to US 15 near Gilberts Corner.

Among the cities, towns and other landmarks traversed by SR 620 are:
*the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology lies near the intersection with Little River Turnpike
*Annandale
*an intersection with the Capital Beltway
*Burke
*George Mason University
*Centreville
*Sully Station
*South Riding

==Future construction==
Many residents oppose the possible new construction of a shopping center at the southwestern corner of the intersection of SR 620 and SR 659 (Gum Springs Road), directly behind the Virginia Manor neighborhood, due to concerns of increased traffic. Loudoun County supervisors will vote on a proposal in September 2019 for a different shopping center, located at the southeastern corner of the intersection. This proposal would include a new intersection being constructed for an entrance off SR 620 to the shopping center.

Fairfax County is currently considering changes to SR 620 between Guinea Road and I-495. These include the improvement of pedestrian walkways and reconfiguration of certain intersections to decrease congestion in the area. The county&#x27;s Department of Transportation has ruled out adding travel lanes to SR 620 or constructing a new park-and-ride and transit center due to the high costs.

==History==
Historically, SR 620 was known as Braddock Road. The road has historical significance in the American Civil War, and portions of the road were established prior to British colonization of northern Virginia. Although the original Braddock Road was unified throughout its length, many portions of the original road have been transected, relocated or disjointed since the original path was defined (especially since the modern paved road system was constructed).

===Establishment, including pre-colonization era===
Braddock Road was originally composed of paths established by the Native American inhabitants of Northern Virginia. Later, British colonialists and Virginian governments developed and improved the paths into what became known as &quot;Braddock&#x27;s Road.&quot;

===Colonial and revolutionary era===
Price&#x27;s Common, a market that operated during the colonial administration and was the site of the drafting of the Virginia Declaration of Rights signed by George Mason (and after which the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution was modeled), was located by the intersection of Braddock Road and Backlick Road.

Braddock Rd is so named as it was believed to be the route of the English General Edward Braddock&#x27;s force during the French and Indian War. At the outset of the Braddock Expedition, the force was split into two groups. Braddock led the first group across the Potomac near Rock Creek and up to Frederick and Sir Peter Halkett led a second group through Northern Virginia. Halkett&#x27;s group marched past the Old Fairfax County courthouse (today Tysons Corner) and up to Coleman&#x27;s Ordinary (today Northern Herndon, Virginia). It is unlikely that today&#x27;s Braddock Road was the actual route taken by Halkett&#x27;s group. Rather, they roughly followed the route of present-day Leesburg Pike (Route 7).

===Civil War===
During the American Civil War, both Union and Confederate troops traversed Braddock Road during various battles in Fairfax County and other parts of Northern Virginia.

One of Mosby&#x27;s Raiders, Robert Spindle, was a native of Centreville. Later, the part of SR 620 that was formed when Braddock Road was cut at US 29 was named after him, Spindle Court.

===Modern era===
With the advent of the modern road system, Braddock Road changed. In the 1930s after the Virginia Secondary Road system was created Braddock Road in Fairfax and Loudoun Counties was given the designation SR 620.

In the 1960s I-66 was built coming through Centreville. At this point the section of SR 620 between SR28 south of I-66 and a point north of the new I-66 was deleted, and a new SR 620 entrance was created intersecting with SR 28 north of I-66.

When SR 28 was widened from a 4-lane highway to a 6-lane one SR 620 was changed again. SR 620 south of I-66 no longer intersected with SR 28; SR 620 ended where Willoughby Newton Drive is now.

In the 1980s a shopping center was built at the corner of U.S. 29 and Old Centreville Road. At that time the non-SR 620 section of Braddock Road was constructed linking SR 620 to Old Centreville Road. The intersection between SR 620 and U.S. 29 was cut, and this small portion of SR 620 was renamed Spindle Court.

The Loudoun County Board of Supervisors undertook an effort in 1989 to give the county&#x27;s roads names that were determined to be more historically accurate. The plan proposed to rename the county&#x27;s portion of Braddock Road to Colchester Road, but this single change was removed immediately before adoption.

In the 1990s New Braddock Road was constructed linking Union Mill Road to SR 28. This is when SR 620 was cut, so that, on the east side of Union Mill Road, the road is Braddock Road, and on the west side it is New Braddock Road. Braddock Road heading west now intersects with Union Mill Road one block to the north.

The final change came in 2009. A barrier was erected on SR 28 that forced all traffic coming from SR 620 from the west to turn south on SR 28.

Fairfax County considered changing the intersection between SR 123 and SR 620 to a full interchange. The designs considered are diamond, a modified diamond interchange, an SPUI, and a tight SPUI. Ultimately, one left turn lane in each direction of SR 123 was added at the intersection, the left turn lane on eastbound SR 620 was extended, and new traffic signals were installed.

<text>Pindamonhangaba is a municipality in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, located in the Paraíba Valley, between the two most active production and consumption regions in the country, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. It is accessible by the Via Dutra (BR-116 – SP-60 highway) at the 99th kilometer. This place name comes from the Old Tupi language meaning &quot;where hooks are made&quot; or, according to a different interpretation, &quot;where the river bends&quot;.

==History==
The region then occupied by the Portuguese was Pindamonhangaba at least since July 22, 1643, registering more remote occupation by a certain Captain João Prado Martins. Six years later, on May 17, 1649, the area was formalized as a land grant and donated to the captain. It seems there is no information about what occurred between that date and August 12, 1672, so 13 years later, a chapel was built in honor of São José by brothers Antônio Bicudo Leme and Braz Esteves Leme. These brothers have acquired of the Countess of Vimieiro (Condesa de Vimieiro), the lands north of the town of Taubaté. There is no news of how the allotment had passed from the hands of Captain Prado Martins to the Countess. Given the uncertainties, two recent mayors of the city solved the problem by fiat: Caio Gomes Mayor officiated at the date of August 12, 1672 (Leme brothers) as the founding date of the city and later, Mayor João Bosco Nogueira decreed magna that date the county was founded was the date of emancipation, July 10, 1705.

On April 16, 1858, it lost part of the territory that was located in the Serra da Mantiqueira, turning into a new municipality São Bento do Sapucaí. Later it was fragmented into two new municipalities, Campos do Jordão and Santo Antônio do Pinhal. On November 30, 1944, it lost part of the territory to Aparecida, on its border, for the creation of the Roseira district, which two decades later became a city.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>Congress Heights is a residential neighborhood in Southeast Washington, D.C., in the United States. The irregularly shaped neighborhood is bounded by the St. Elizabeths Hospital campus, Lebaum Street SE, 4th Street SE, and Newcomb Street SE on the northeast; Shepard Parkway and South Capitol Street on the west; Atlantic Street SE and 1st Street SE (as far as Chesapeake Street SE) on the south; Oxon Run Parkway on the southeast; and Wheeler Street SE and Alabama Avenue SE on the east. Commercial development is heavy along Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue and Malcolm X Avenue (formerly Portland Street, SE).

==History of the neighborhood==

===Pre-development years===

Prior to its development, the area known as Congress Heights was forest and farmland. The bay between Poplar Point and Giesborough Point was open water, and would not be filled in and reclaimed for use until the 1880s. The area was served primarily by the Navy Yard Bridge (now known as the 11th Street Bridges), constructed in 1820. The first residential development east of the river was Uniontown (now the neighborhood of Anacostia), begun in 1854. The following year, the federal government constructed the Government Hospital for the Insane (later known as St. Elizabeths Hospital). To serve the hospital, Asylum Avenue (now Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue) was constructed from the Navy Yard Bridge to the new hospital and then, running on the east side of a line of hills, down to the District-Maryland line.

Additional construction in the area occurred during the American Civil War (1861 to 1865). The United States Department of War constructed the George Washington Young cavalry magazine on of land on Giesborough Point. Two forts, Fort Carroll (near the present intersection of South Capitol Street and Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue) and Fort Greble (near the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue and Blue Plains Drive SW), were constructed on the bluffs that began just west and adjacent to Asylum Road. After the war, the Barry Farm housing development for freed slaves opened in 1867 on the north side of the St. Elizabeths campus and was rapidly occupied. Asylum Avenue was named Nichols Avenue in 1879 in honor of St. Elizabeths Hospital superintendent Charles Henry Nichols.

Asylum Avenue/Nichols Avenue was the only major southward road through the area until the development of Congress Heights itself. The only other major street was a military road (now known as Alabama Avenue SE) which ran in an east-northeasterly direction toward other Civil War forts.

===Founding of Congress Heights===

Congress Heights itself was founded in 1890. Colonel Arthur E. Randle, a successful newspaper publisher, decided to found a settlement east of the river which he called Congress Heights. The Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge (which was replaced by the John Philip Sousa Bridge) began construction in November 1887, and by June 1890 was nearing completion. Randle understood that this new bridge would bring rapid development east of the Anacostia River, and he intended to take advantage of it.

The development was immediately successful. To ensure that his investment continued to pay off, Randle invested heavily in the Belt Railway, a local streetcar company founded in March 1875. On March 2, 1895, Randle founded the Capital Railway Company to construct streetcar lines over the Navy Yard Bridge and down Nichols Avenue to Congress Heights. The Belt Railway was purchased on June 24, 1898, by the Anacostia and Potomac River Railway Company. This made Randle a majority owner of the Anacostia and Potomac River Railway. Randle sold his interest in the Capital Railway in 1899, and used this fortune to buy a large section of land known as &quot;East Washington Highlands&quot; at the foot of the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge. This became the development of Randle Highlands, and the success of that development allowed him to create &quot;North Randle Highlands&quot; (now the neighborhoods of Dupont Park, Penn Branch, and the lower portion of Greenway) In October 1906, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called Randle&#x27;s developments &quot;among the largest real estate enterprises ever successfully carried through in the District.&quot;

The rapid development of Congress Heights and the areas adjacent to the streetcar line on Nichols Avenue led the government of the District of Columbia to extend South Capitol Street into the area east of the Anacostia River. The topography of the area largely dictated the route. Beginning near St. Elizabeths Hospital, a line of bluffs extended roughly southward until it reached what is now Chesapeake Street SW. (Fort Greble sat atop the southernmost of these cliffs.) To the west of these bluffs were broad, flat lowlands which provided pleasant views of the Potomac River and the city of Alexandria, Virginia. In 1893, the city surveyed South Capitol along the western side of these bluffs, laying out a broad, grand avenue. Once the bluffs ended, the route followed existing local roads and curved eastward to connect with Livingston Road (now the Indian Head Highway) at the District-Maryland line. But because of the lack of development south of Congress Heights, South Capitol Street was only constructed to its intersection with Nichols Avenue.

===20th-century development===
From the 1930s until the 1950s, Congress Heights was an almost all-white working-class neighborhood. Many of these white working-class people were rural Southerners and Appalachians who had migrated from Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Many of them worked at the Navy Yard or at nearby Bolling Air Force Base.

Congress Heights was the location of the last working farm within the District of Columbia. George Lindner had been growing vegetables on his farm for over 50 years and it had been in the family since the Civil War. The farm shut down in 1939.

Prior to World War II the D.C. National Guard was housed at Camp Simms. The facility included firing ranges up to 1,000 yards. It was on Alabama Avenue at the intersection of Stanton Road and Barry Farm Housing Project. During World War II, it had anti-aircraft gun emplacements to defend Washington from air attack. After the war, the U.S. Army built a military reserve facility in the central part of Congress Heights. Many early residents worked at the U.S. Naval Gun Factory, which stopped production about 1960, or at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory.

Congress Heights experienced great urban neglect after World War II. However, in the 21st century, Congress Heights has received a great deal of attention from the city and urban developers. Nineteen development projects worth a total of $455 million are underway or completed in Congress Heights as of November 2006. Among these are a redevelopment of St. Elizabeths West Campus for federal use; a request for proposals from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority for the area around the Congress Heights Metro station; and a planned redevelopment of Camp Simms as a mixed-use project, including a new Giant Grocery Store, enhancement to an existing shopping center, and 75 new residential units. The ARC cultural arts center, and the Tennis and Learning Center, are nearby on Mississippi Avenue.

The neighborhood is served by the Congress Heights station on the Green Line of the Washington Metro. Most residents live in garden apartments, but there are also older single-family bungalows. Frank W. Ballou High School (rebuilt in 2014) and Hart Middle School serve the neighborhood.

Destination Congress Heights (Congress Heights Main Street) was chartered by the National Trust for Historic Preservation Main Street program in January 2016. Destination Congress Heights is a program created by Congress Heights Community Training &amp; Development Corporation, a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization led by a combination of community development professionals and local volunteers. The main street program is based on the National Trust for Historic Preservation nationally proven model The Main Street Four Point Approach which includes in emphasis in the areas of: organization of commercial revitalization efforts, promotion of neighborhood businesses and business districts, design and economic revitalization. The approach includes an underlying historic preservation ethic and provides local organizations with a mechanism to manage their neighborhood commercial districts and a structure to implement commercial revitalization activities that will achieve the stakeholders&#x27; goals for the commercial district.
