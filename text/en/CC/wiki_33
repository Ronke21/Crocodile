<text>In mathematics, an unfoldable cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number.

Formally, a cardinal number κ is λ-unfoldable if and only if for every transitive model &quot;M&quot; of cardinality κ of ZFC-minus-power set such that κ is in &quot;M&quot; and &quot;M&quot; contains all its sequences of length less than κ, there is a non-trivial elementary embedding &quot;j&quot; of &quot;M&quot; into a transitive model with the critical point of &quot;j&quot; being κ and &quot;j&quot;(κ) ≥ λ.

A cardinal is unfoldable if and only if it is an λ-unfoldable for all ordinals λ.

A cardinal number κ is strongly λ-unfoldable if and only if for every transitive model &quot;M&quot; of cardinality κ of ZFC-minus-power set such that κ is in &quot;M&quot; and &quot;M&quot; contains all its sequences of length less than κ, there is a non-trivial elementary embedding &quot;j&quot; of &quot;M&quot; into a transitive model &quot;N&quot; with the critical point of &quot;j&quot; being κ, &quot;j&quot;(κ) ≥ λ, and V(λ) is a subset of &quot;N&quot;. Without loss of generality, we can demand also that &quot;N&quot; contains all its sequences of length λ.

Likewise, a cardinal is strongly unfoldable if and only if it is strongly λ-unfoldable for all λ.

These properties are essentially weaker versions of strong and supercompact cardinals, consistent with V = L. Many theorems related to these cardinals have generalizations to their unfoldable or strongly unfoldable counterparts. For example, the existence of a strongly unfoldable implies the consistency of a slightly weaker version of the proper forcing axiom.

==Relations between large cardinal properties==
Assuming V = L, the least unfoldable cardinal is greater than the least indescribable cardinal.p.14 Assuming a Ramsey cardinal exists, it is less than the least Ramsey cardinal.p.3

A Ramsey cardinal is unfoldable and will be strongly unfoldable in L. It may fail to be strongly unfoldable in V, however.

In L, any unfoldable cardinal is strongly unfoldable; thus unfoldable and strongly unfoldable have the same consistency strength.

A cardinal k is κ-strongly unfoldable, and κ-unfoldable, if and only if it is weakly compact. A κ+ω-unfoldable cardinal is indescribable and preceded by a stationary set of totally indescribable cardinals.

<text>Gżira () is a town in the Central Region of Malta. It is located between Msida and Sliema, also bordering on Ta&#x27; Xbiex. It has a population of 11,699 as of January 2019. The word &quot;Gżira&quot; means &quot;island&quot; in Maltese, and the town is named after Manoel Island which lies to the east of Gżira, between the Sliema peninsula and Valletta. The seafront of Gżira has views of the walled city of Valletta, which is illuminated at night, forming a backdrop to Manoel Island, the yacht marina and a seafront public garden. The hamlet of Kappara is located close to Gżira. The Orpheum Theatre is located in Gżira.

== Town history ==

In the mid-19th century a villa was built in Gżira by Chevalier Jacob Tagliaferro. Slowly Gżira started developing into a working-class suburb of Sliema. Until the 1970s, Gżira had many bars, particularly the Snake Pit, Britannia and the Granada along and in proximity of the Strand, which economic activity ended when the British Service left Malta on 31 March 1979.

A regenerated Gżira is now host to a business community of hoteliers, restaurants, financial institutions, legal firms, online betting companies, real estate and offices amidst a multi-ethnic and multicultural community of residents. Since the last decade, Gżira had a real estate boom, and new buildings, mainly apartments, have replaced the old buildings.

As a result, much of the character and charm of the seafront houses has changed, although in the heart of Gżira there are still examples of traditional Maltese façades, with timber balconies (Gallarija) and bow-fronted, wrought iron balconies. The proliferation of modern apartments in Gżira as well as the development of high rise buildings, namely Metropolis and 14 East, led to an inflation of housing prices, as the town became sought after by both Maltese and foreigners.

Gżira&#x27;s population has been fairly stable over the past few years, hovering around 11,699 people as of January 2019. It is known as being quite a multicultural town, with well-established and fairly integrated immigrant groups.

The main reason behind the area&#x27;s popularity is that it is fairly centrally located in Malta, being close to the University of Malta, Sliema, and the capital Valletta. Service industries, commercial outlets and educational services are the town&#x27;s main activities.

The crime rate in Gżira is very low, and the town is generally as safe as the rest of Malta and Gozo.

=== Religion ===

The Roman Catholic parish church of Gżira is also known locally as &quot;tal-Ġebla&quot;. Its literal translation means &quot;of the stone&quot;, a reference to an incident which took place in Gżira on 10 July 1902. Three British drunken sailors, William Walls, Charles Thurbull and John Packhun, wanted to enter a bar, which at that time of day was closed. When Karmnu Brincat, the owner of the bar, refused to open, the sailors started throwing stones at the place. One of these stones hit a small shrine depicting a picture of Our Lady of Mount Carmel hanging outside the bar. The stone broke the glass of the frame, but did not make contact with the portrait itself, which remained intact. Notwithstanding the wind, the stone remained fixed within the broken glass.

The stone was removed by Anton Manché and taken to the Stella Maris Parish Church in Sliema, whose parish priest at the time was Francis Vincent Manché, the brother of Anton Manché.

For three days, prayers and services for reparation were held. Anton Anton Manché managed to set up a small chapel in Gżira where the small shrine was taken.

On 7 July 1913 Bishop Pietro Pace declared the chapel as a vice-parish.

On 15 May 1921, Bishop Don Mauro Caruana declared the chapel as a parish. Anton Anton Manché was the first parish priest of Gżira. The existing parish church was built between 1921 and 1935.

The second parish priest in the history of the Gżira parish was Carlo Manché, a man revered by many locals as a saint. He became parish priest of Gżira on 12 March 1935 until his death on 18 November 1950.

The frame, the broken glass and the stone that was thrown at the portrait of The Madonna have been very well preserved, and today they can still be seen at the parish church of Gżira.

The parish church of Gżira is dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, and its annual festa (village feast) is celebrated on the second Sunday of July.

==Twin cities==
Gżira has been twinned with Glyfada (Greece) and Wałbrzych (Poland).

==Zones in Gżira==
* Village Core – area surrounding the Gżira Parish Church
* The Strand and Promenade
* Council of Europe Gardens, Gżira – a public garden
* Empire Stadium
* Gżira Marina
*Manoel Island

=== Manoel Island ===
Manoel Island in Gżira&#x27;s Marsamxett Harbour, was originally known as &quot;l&#x27;Isola del Vescovo&quot; or &quot;il-Gżira tal-Isqof&quot; in Maltese (literally translated as &quot;the Bishop&#x27;s Island&quot;). It was the property of the Mdina Cathedral. In 1643 Jean Paul Lascaris, Grandmaster of the Knights of Malta, constructed a quarantine hospital (&quot;Lazzaretto&quot;) on the island, in an attempt to control the periodic influx of plague and cholera. In 1675, another Grand Master, this time, Nicola&#x27; Cottoner, decided to construct another isolation hospital with an additional forty beds, a chapel and a cemetery.

The island was renamed after António Manoel de Vilhena, a Portuguese Grandmaster of the Knights of Malta under whose leadership Fort Manoel was built in 1726. Fort Manoel is considered a marvel of 18th-century military engineering. The original plans for the fort are attributed to Louis d&#x27;Augbigne Tigné, and are said to have been modified by his friend and colleague Charles François de Mondion, who is buried in a crypt beneath Fort Manoel. At one time, the Knights of Malta considered developing a walled city on Manoel Island, but instead they settled on a fort designed to house up to 500 soldiers. The fort has a magnificent quadrangle, parade ground and arcade, and once housed a baroque chapel dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua, under the direct command of the Order.

During World War II, Manoel Island and its fort were used as a naval base by the Royal Navy, at which time it was referred to variously as &quot;HMS Talbot&quot; or &quot;HMS Phœnicia&quot;. The Chapel of St. Anthony was virtually destroyed following a direct hit by Luftwaffe bombers in March 1942.
 Manoel Island formerly housed a quaint, informal sanctuary for ducks and other waterfowl, created and maintained by a local volunteer, and funded entirely by private donations near the bridge connecting the island with the main island.

As of November 2006, the historic fort was undergoing significant restoration and renovation works, and a new housing development was under construction on Manoel Island. The Manoel Island redevelopment project, however, has been heavily criticized due to its proximity to the island&#x27;s important historical buildings. A guarded barrier some 300 yards after the bridge makes it clear that the public is not welcome on the largest part of the island.

<text>Nena, an acronym for Northern Europe–North America, was the Early Proterozoic amalgamation of Baltica and Laurentia into a single &quot;cratonic landmass&quot;, a name first proposed in 1990. Since then several similar Proterozoic supercontinents have been proposed, including Nuna and Arctica, that include other Archaean cratons, such as Siberia and East Antarctica.
In the original concept Nena formed in the Penokean, Makkovikan, Ketilidian, and Svecofennian orogenies. However, because Nena excludes several known Archaean cratons, including those in India and Australia, it is strictly speaking not a supercontinent. Although Nena and Nuna share many similarities, Nena accounted for a larger landmass than Nuna. This extended landmass included the Angara, Antarctica, Baltica, Laurentia, and Siberia bodies. Nena, or Nuna, can, nevertheless be thought of as the core of Columbia, another supercontinent concept with several proposed configurations.

The first concept of the Nena supercontinent originated with the southern regions of proto-Laurentia and the western regions proto-Baltica merging throughout the Proterozoic eon. This concept would eventually be developed to the modern day conceptualization of the Nena supercontinent which includes additions of the Angara, Antarctica, and Siberia landmasses.

Throughout the amalgamation of the microcontinents which would form proto-Nena, several significant geologic processes occurred including orogenesis and continental magmatic accretion. The by-products of these processes can be found numerous regions such as southwest Ontario, northwest British Isles, and Greenland. These by-products include the Marquette Range supergroup and the Moran Lake and lower Aillik groups northwest of the Makkovik orogen. These geologic findings provided a basis for the concept of the Nena supercontinent. 

Nena as a continent has been associated with the Sudbury Basin Impact.

<doc id="853798" wikidata="Q101500289" url="?curid=853798" title="Purple-faced langur">
<text>The purple-faced langur (Semnopithecus vetulus), also known as the purple-faced leaf monkey, is a species of Old World monkey that is endemic to Sri Lanka. The animal is a long-tailed arboreal species, identified by a mostly brown appearance, dark face (with paler lower face) and a very shy nature. The species was once highly prevalent, found in suburban Colombo and the &quot;wet zone&quot; villages (areas with high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year, whilst rain occur during the monsoon seasons), but rapid urbanization has led to a significant decrease in the population level of the monkeys. It had traditionally been classified within the genus &quot;Trachypithecus&quot; but was moved to the genus &quot;Semnopithecus&quot; based on DNA evidence indicating that is it more closely related to the gray langurs.

In Sinhala, it is known as ශ්‍රී ලංකා කළු වඳුරා [kʌlu vʌⁿðura] (Sri Lanka black monkey).

== Description ==
In the purple-faced langur, males are usually larger than females. Males measure in head-body length with a tail of . Females possess a head-body length and tail length of . The pelage may generally vary from blackish to grayish. The species tends to have whitish to gray short &#x27;trousers&#x27; rounded off by purplish-black faces with white sideburns. Part of the back is covered with whitish fur, and tail is also furred with black and white mixed colors. The feet and hands are also purplish-black in color. Size varies among the subspecies. Typically adults will weigh somewhere between , averaging about . The smallest subspecies (&quot;S. v. nestor&quot;) commonly weighs between . Average weight from other subspecies has been recorded up to in females and in males with some exceptionally big langurs weighing up to perhaps . Among the primates that live in Sri Lanka, it is somewhat smaller than the tufted gray langur despite leading males of the group of purple-faced langurs often being larger than the tufted gray langur that lived together in the habitats. In the subspecies known as the &quot;bear monkey&quot; (&quot;S. v. monitcola&quot;) usually has a darker coat and usually sports a heavy mustache. In this species, the hair of crown directed backwards throughout, not radiating. it lacks the crest of tufted gray langurs and has hair on the crown no longer than on temples and nape. Purple-faced langurs have a rump that is pure white or whitish gray.

=== Subspecies ===
According to the Mammals of Sri Lanka, the 4 subspecies are recognized as follows.
* Southern lowland wetzone purple-faced langur, &quot;Semnopithecus vetulus vetulus&quot; – &quot;Color varies greatly. Black upper torso, light brown cap, well defined silvery rump patch that extends to legs. Prominent white whiskers. Tail is also white colored. Many white morphs are observed in this subspecies. They can be all-white to partly white leucistic.&quot;
* Western purple-faced langur or north lowland wetzone purple-faced langur, &quot;Semnopithecus vetulus nestor&quot; – &quot;It is the smallest of all subspecies. Upper torso dark grayish brown with light grayish brown rump patch, darker grayish brown legs and white cap.&quot;
* Dryzone purple-faced langur, &quot;Semnopithecus vetulus philbricki&quot; – &quot;Largest subspecies. Grayish brown torso, ill-defined grayish rump patch, dark cap. Prominent white cheeks with tufts. Exceptionally long slimy tail.&quot;
* Montane purple-faced langur or Bear Monkey, &quot;Semnopithecus vetulus monticola&quot; – &quot;Dark gray brown coat. Large but ill-defined grayish rump patch. Prominent white cheek tufts, light brownish gray cap. Fur long and shaggy due to habitat they live is cold.&quot;

All four recognizable subspecies exhibit different cranial and pelage characteristics, as well as body size. The western purple-faced langur is one of the 25 most endangered primates in the world.
Most groups of langurs contain only one adult male.

A possible subspecies called &quot;Semnopithecus vetulus harti&quot; is recognized, but not yet given validity. This subspecies is known from some skins found from Jaffna peninsula and north of the Vavuniya. Uniquely, this subspecies has yellowish golden hair on its scalp and a golden sheen to its fur. Other than these differences, anatomy and all the other aspects are similar to the &quot;Semnopithecus vetulus philbricki&quot;.

Although traditionally classified within the genus &quot;Trachypithecus&quot; based on morphological similarities, DNA and vocal evidence suggests that the purple-faced langur actually is more closely related to the gray langurs of the genus &quot;Semnopithecus&quot;.

== Habitat and status ==
The purple-faced langur is found in closed canopy forests in Sri Lanka&#x27;s mountains and the southwestern part of the country, known as the &quot;wet zone&quot;. Only 19% of Sri Lanka consists of forested areas. This habitat has decreased from 80% in 1980 to ~25% in 2001. Currently, this range has decreased to below 3%. The range consists of the most densely populated lowland rainforest areas of Sri Lanka. Deforestation has resulted in the langurs home ranges to be exposed to direct sunlight. Purple-faced langurs are most often found in small and widely scattered groups. Ninety percent of the langurs range, now consists of human populated areas. Populations are critically low within and between sites. Threats to this species include infringement on range by croplands, grazing, changing agriculture, road production, soil loss/erosion and deforestation, poisoning from prevention of crop raiding, and hunting for medicine and food.

Its range has constricted greatly in the face of human encroachment, although it can still be seen in Sinharaja, Kitulgala, Kandalama, Mihintale, in the mountains at Horton Plains National Park or in the rainforest near the city of Galle.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
=== Diet ===
The purple-faced langur is mostly folivorous, but will also feed on fruits, flowers, and seeds. While they normally avoid human habitations, fruit such as jak (&quot;Artocarpus heterophyllus&quot;), rambutan (&quot;Nephelium lappaceum&quot;), banana (&quot;Musa balbisiana&quot;), and mango (&quot;Mangifera indica&quot;) may contribute up to 50% to their diet in cultivated areas. In the wild, food such as the fruits of &quot;Dimocarpus longan&quot; and &quot;Drypetes sepiaria&quot; are taken. Purple-faced langur digestion is adapted to derive the majority of required nutrients and energy from complex carbohydrates found in leaves, with the help of specialized stomach bacteria. Where the species&#x27; diet is currently heavily dependent cultivated fruits, the ability to derive sufficient nutrition may become impaired. Seasonal availability of fruit may serve to increase this effect.

&quot;Semnopithecus vetulus&quot; feed on a less diverse diet than &quot;S. priam&quot;, with a greater proportion of leaves. Food plants that have been identified include &quot;Holoptelea integrifolia&quot;, &quot;Hydnocarpus venenata&quot;, &quot;Macaranga peltata&quot;, &quot;Manilkara hexandra&quot;, &quot;Mikania scandens&quot;, &quot;Mischodon zeylanica&quot;, &quot;Pterospermum suberifolium&quot;, &quot;Tetrameles nudiflora&quot;, &quot;Vitex altissima&quot;, and &quot;Wrightia angustifolia&quot;. The purple-faced langur was found to be dominated by tufted gray langurs in mixed feeding groups.

=== Communication ===
Loud calls are often used to distinguish between individual purple-faced langurs. The elements of a call fall into three categories: harsh barks, whoops, and residuals. Individuals can be differentiated by the number of phrases and residuals within a call. Calls occur more often in the morning mostly stimulated by neighboring groups and territorial battles. More calls occur during sunny periods than cloudy. The fewest calls occur in the evening. Daytime calls usually aid in the defense of home ranges. The loud barking call, particularly of the highland form, can be mistaken for the roar of a predator such as a leopard. Calls of the purple-faced langur differ from those of any of the subspecies. Environmental characters impact call times as well as anthropogenic disturbance. Vocalization can be used to alert members of predators, attract mates, defend territory, and locate group members. Vocalization is extremely important for the use in conservation especially because they are very difficult to observe directly. Adult males are the most vocal among the entire group. Defensive whooping calls are also accompanied by intense visual and locomotive displays. Vocalizations are also helpful in determining taxonomic identification. Based on alarm calls issued in response to these and known predators of the similar tufted gray langur, the main potential predators of this species are likely to be leopards followed infrequently perhaps by Indian pythons and mugger crocodile. For young or infirm langurs, black eagles, spot-bellied eagle-owls and possibly other larger birds of prey are perhaps not infrequently a threat. Monitor lizards may also feed on purple-faced langurs (possibly through scavenging or picking off the young or sickly).

== Conservation ==
Some conservation strategies consist of improving management of the already protected areas as well as locate and protect new areas and corridors within ranges. Efforts to help increase populations may help survival. It would be beneficial to lower human-langur conflicts. Rope bridges could be established for langurs to move between ranges safely, which may decrease the crossing of power lines and roads. Replanting pine plantations with native species exploited by these langurs, could possibly increase its preferred habitat as well. Public education of conservation to the local people emphasizing compassion and kindness as well as explaining the importance and necessity of these mammals to the ecosystems overall biodiversity.

<text>Girl power is a slogan that encourages and celebrates women&#x27;s empowerment, independence, confidence and strength. The slogan&#x27;s invention is credited to the US punk band Bikini Kill, who published a zine called &quot;Bikini Kill #2: Girl Power&quot; in 1991. It was then popularized in the mainstream by the British girl group Spice Girls in the mid-1990s. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, the Spice Girls&#x27; usage of &quot;girl power&quot; was one of the defining cultural touchstones that shaped the Millennial generation, particularly during their childhood in the 1990s. The usage of the slang term is still considered relevant three decades later in the 2020s through continued feminist movements. Although the term has become much more discreated in the last decade, particularly with the rise of &quot;Woke Hollywood&quot; since 2015.

==Early usage and origins==

In 1990, US punk band Bikini Kill started to make their self-titled feminist zine. Its first issue had the subtitle, &quot;A color and activity book&quot;. A year later the band published the second issue of their &quot;Bikini Kill&quot; zine, with the new subtitle &quot;Girl Power&quot;. The band&#x27;s lead singer, Kathleen Hanna, said it was inspired by the Black Power slogan. The authors of &quot;Young Femininity: Girlhood, Power and Social Change&quot; argue that the term also draws inspiration from 80s Black female, hip hop vernacular, &quot;You go girl&quot;.

The term became popular in the early and mid 90s punk culture. &quot;The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; credits the zine with coining the slogan: &quot;In their feminist fanzine Bikini Kill they articulated an agenda for young women in and outside of music; the band put those ideas to practice. Bikini Kill earned a reputation in the punk underground for confronting certain standards of that genre; for example, asking people to slam at the side of the stage, so that women would not get pushed out of the front, and inviting women to take the mic and talk about sexual abuse.&quot;

The phrase is sometimes sensationally spelled &quot;grrrl power&quot;, based on the spelling of &quot;riot grrrl&quot;. The Riot Grrrl movement was pioneered by Bikini Kill in the 1990s through their music and pushback on the punk industry’s sexist culture.

Some other musical artists who have used the slogan in their music are Welsh band Helen Love, with it appearing in the chorus of their 1992 song &quot;Formula One Racing Girls&quot;, and pop-punk duo Shampoo, who released an album and single titled &quot;Girl Power&quot; in 1995. The slogan was integrated into children’s entertainment as well, The Cheetah Girls released their single &quot;Girl Power&quot; in 2003 through Disney. 

== Spice Girls ==
British pop quintet Spice Girls brought the mantra into the mainstream consciousness in the mid-1990s. The Spice Girls&#x27; version of &quot;girl power&quot; focused on the importance of strong and loyal friendship among females, with a message of empowerment that appealed to young girls, adolescents and adult women. According to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, they demonstrated real, noncompetitive female friendship, singing: &quot;If you wannabe my lover, you gotta get with my friends. Make it last forever; friendship never ends.&quot;

In all, the focused, consistent presentation of &quot;girl power&quot; formed the centrepiece of their appeal as a band. Some commentators credit the Spice Girls with reinvigorating mainstream feminism in the 1990s, with the &quot;girl power&quot; mantra serving as a gateway to feminism for their young fans. On the other hand, some critics dismissed &quot;girl power&quot; as no more than a shallow marketing tactic, while others took issue with the emphasis on physical appearance, concerned about the potential impact on self-conscious and/or impressionable youngsters: As American feminist Jennifer Pozner famously remarked, it was &quot;probably a fair assumption to say that a &#x27;zig-a-zig-ah&#x27; is not Spice shorthand for &#x27;subvert the dominant paradigm. Regardless, the phrase became a cultural phenomenon, adopted as the mantra for millions of girls and even making it into the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.
In summation of the concept, author Ryan Dawson said, &quot;The Spice Girls changed British culture enough for Girl Power to now seem completely unremarkable.&quot;

In 2018, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named the Spice Girls&#x27; brand of &quot;girl power&quot; on &quot;The Millennial 100&quot;, a list of 100 people, music, cultural touchstones and movements that have shaped the Millennial generation.

== Scholarship ==
In her 2002 book &quot;Girl Heroes: The New Force in Popular Culture&quot;, Susan Hopkins suggested a correlation between &quot;girl power&quot;, Spice Girls, and female action heroes at the end of the 20th century. A later book, &quot;Growing Up With Girl Power&quot;, by Rebecca Hains (2012) found that the phrase &quot;girl power&quot; and the media associated with it—such as the Spice Girls and girl heroes—diluted the phrase&#x27;s impact from the riot grrrls&#x27; intent, making it more about marketing and selling the idea of empowerment than about furthering girls&#x27; actual empowerment.

The slogan has also been examined within the context of the academic field, for example Buffy studies. Media theorist Kathleen Rowe Karlyn in her article &quot;Scream, Popular Culture, and Feminism&#x27;s Third Wave: I&#x27;m Not My Mother&quot; and Irene Karras in &quot;The Third Wave&#x27;s Final Girl: Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; suggest a link with third-wave feminism. Frances Early and Kathleen Kennedy in the introduction to &quot;Athena&#x27;s Daughters: Television&#x27;s New Women Warriors&quot;, discuss what they describe as a link between girl power and a &quot;new&quot; image of women warriors in popular culture.

===&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;===

A 2001 update to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defined &quot;girl power&quot; as:

The dictionary further offers an example of this term by quoting from &quot;Angel Delight&quot;, an article in the March 24, 2001, issue of &quot;Dreamwatch&quot; about the television series &quot;Dark Angel&quot;:

==Criticism==
The communications scholar Debbie Ging was critical of the &quot;girl power&quot; ideals, and linked it to the sexualisation of younger children, girls in particular.

The sociologist Amy McClure warns against placing too much hope on girl power as an empowering concept. She says, &quot;An ideology based on consumerism can never be a revolutionary social movement. The fact that it appears to be a revolutionary movement is a dangerous lie that not only marketers sell to us but that we often happily sell to ourselves.&quot; Rebecca Hains also criticized mainstream &quot;girl power&quot; for its commercial function, arguing in &quot;Women&#x27;s Studies in Communication&quot; that it &quot;undermines true work towards equality, serving corporate interests at the expense of girls&#x27; personal interests,&quot; and called it an &quot;updated version of &#x27;commodity feminism.&#x27;&quot;

Despite the term&#x27;s origins in Black Power and Black hip hop, Raisa Alvarado argues that the Girl Power movement &quot;disproportionately centers white, middle and upper class girls.&quot; Further, Alvarado claims that &quot;the ethos of girl power discourses, as propagated in popular culture... promote whiteness via neoliberal, postfeminist, and postrace representations of empowered girlhood.&quot; &quot;Young Femininity&quot; authors Sinikka Aapola, Marnina Gonick, Jo Campling, and Anita Harris note that the Girl Power movement &quot;appropriat[es]... images and discourses of black women&#x27;s strength, power and agency to serve a mainly white middle-class young women&quot; agenda.

Media and toys can present a narrow definition of what it means to be a girl, such as Mattel&#x27;s Barbie. The &quot;I can be&quot; Barbie embodied this concept of &quot;girl power&quot;: that little girls can be anything they want when they grow up. Barbie has continued to stay relevant into the 2020s through the 2023 film Barbie starring Margot Robbie. Forbes has even placed Barbie on the 2023 Forbes Power Women List. Arguably, Barbie&#x27;s image also presents narrow options with which girls can identify, limiting the potential of any &quot;girl power&quot;-themed line.

In addition to concerns about girl power&#x27;s implications for girls, some critics questioned its use by women. For example, Hannah Jane Parkinson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticized the term &quot;girl power&quot; as something &quot;young women [that] are feeling more confident about calling themselves feminists and standing up for principles of equality&quot; hide behind. She denounced the phrase for including the word &quot;girl&quot;, claiming it encouraged the application of the term &quot;girl&quot; to adult women.

<doc id="853811" wikidata="Q698795" url="?curid=853811" title="Huang Qi">
<text>Huang Qi (, born 7 April 1963) is a Chinese and human rights activist from Sichuan. He is the co-founder of Tianwang Center for Missing Persons (later renamed the &quot;Tianwang Human Rights Center&quot;), along with his wife Zeng Li. Initially the mission of the organization was to help counter human trafficking that had become a swelling problem in the late 1990s, but later it was expanded to include campaign against human rights abuse. Huang is also the owner and webmaster of 64tianwang.com, a website originally intended to release news about people who had disappeared in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Huang was imprisoned by the government from June 2000 to June 2005 and again arrested in July 2008 for &quot;illegal possession of state secrets&quot; after he helped the victims of the Sichuan earthquake. In November 2009 he was sentenced to three years of imprisonment. He was subsequently described as a political prisoner; Amnesty International described him as a victim of vague state secrets laws. Huang was sentenced to twelve years in prison in July 2019 for leaking state secrets to foreigners.

==Website==
Huang and his wife, Zeng Li, from Chengdu, Sichuan, set up the website www.64tianwang.com in June 1998 to track cases of human trafficking by posting information about missing people. Huang managed the site, helped to decide on its content, and actively investigated cases, ultimately aiding in the rescue of several trafficked girls. He continued to post articles exposing cases of people exploited by government officials until late 2000; this included the custodial death of a 15-year-old boy and another case of a follower of Falun Gong. The police tried to shut down his website, but Huang moved his website to servers in the United States. 

Huang was arrested in late 2000 under the charges of &quot;inciting subversion&quot; and sentenced to five years in prison. Soon after his release in 2005, he resumed posting similar content on his website as he did before the arrest, until June 2008, when he was arrested again under the charges of &quot;illegal possession of state secrets&quot; after he posted an article on behalf of parents of school children who had died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, demanding an investigation into the schools’ construction.

Reporters Without Borders awarded its Cyber-Freedom Prize to Huang Qi in 2004.

==Imprisonment==

=== Early 2000s ===
Huang was arrested on June 3, 2000—the day before the 11th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests of 1989—accused of posting on his website articles about the protests written by dissidents living abroad. The website was used by the independence movement in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region and the Falun Gong. 

He was jailed in July 2000 at the Detention Center No. 1 in Chengdu. Former cellmates said he was beaten regularly and denied medicine he needed. Huang was ultimately tried for &quot;subversion&quot; in August 2001. He was charged under articles 103, 105, 55 and 56 of the Criminal Law and tried in secret by the Chengdu Intermediate Court in August 2001. He was detained without sentencing until May 9, 2003, when he was sentenced to five years in prison. Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience &quot;imprisoned for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression and association&quot; and called for his immediate release.

On June 4, 2005, Huang Qi was released from jail after completing his sentence. He told Radio Free Asia that he wanted to resume his web site dedicated to the memory of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. &quot;I will do my best to resume the Tianwang Web site. When it was first created it was for very few people. But I now realize that there are many like-minded people,&quot; he said.

=== Sichuan earthquake affair ===

After the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, he assisted in relief work and also responded to some parents&#x27; requests for assistance in their questions and complaints concerning the collapse of school buildings. Huang posted their demands as an article on his website. A week later, on June 10, plain-clothed policemen arrested him in Chengdu and held him &quot;on suspicion of illegally possessing state secrets&quot;, an ill-defined charge often used by the Chinese government to clamp down on dissents. A formal announcement of his arrest was made on July 18, 2008. He was sentenced to three years of imprisonment in November 2009 based on the discovery of two city-level documents in his house. The court was heavily guarded by police with only Huang&#x27;s wife and mother allowed to enter, Huang&#x27;s lawyers were unable to attend because of short notice given. Huang is expected to appeal against the verdict and has been refused bail.

Human Rights organizations condemned the verdict and &quot;inhumane treatment&quot; of Huang in prison. Amnesty International alleges that during his detention Huang was interrogated for long periods and subject to sleep deprivation. Huang&#x27;s family have said that his health has deteriorated rapidly in detention and that he has not received adequate medical care. One of his lawyers has stated that he has been diagnosed with two tumours, one in the stomach and one in the chest, during his period in detention. Earlier on November 7, the U.S. House of Representatives had passed a near-unanimous resolution seeking freedom of activists Huang Qi and Tan Zuoren.

Following Huang&#x27;s imprisonment, fellow human rights activist and pundit Liu Dan authored a piece on Huang&#x27;s Tianwang website condemning Chinese President Hu Jintao&#x27;s Harmonious Society ideology, saying that it was a &quot;sham&quot; in the face of Huang Qi&#x27;s sentencing. Liu wrote that Hu&#x27;s administration silences anyone whose opinions differ from the party line, whether that opinion is coming from external elements (censorship of dissidents), foreign elements (deletion of U.S. President Barack Obama&#x27;s town-hall meeting from news items), or within the Chinese political system itself (removal of Premier Wen Jiabao&#x27;s calls for greater freedoms in Xinhua publications).
Huang was released in 2011 after completing his sentence.

=== 2016–2019 ===
On November 28, 2016, Huang was detained after police raided his home. On December 7, a petitioner told Radio Free Asia that Huang has been detained at Mianyang City Detention in Sichuan Province but Huang&#x27;s mother also went missing. Several days later, on December 16, Huang&#x27;s mother has returned home and Huang has been formally arrested for &quot;leaking state secrets&quot;.

In January 2019 Huang was put on trial at the Intermediate People&#x27;s Court of Mianyang City in Sichuan, accused of leaking state secrets. On July 29, 2019, it was announced that Huang had been found guilty of intentionally leaking state secrets to foreigners, and had been sentenced to twelve years in prison, as well as being deprived of his political rights for four years, and fined 20,000 yuan. Huang has kidney and heart disease, and Christophe Deloire, secretary-general of Reporters Without Borders, noted that &quot;[t]his decision is equivalent to a death sentence, considering Huang Qi&#x27;s health has already deteriorated from a decade spent in harsh confinement&quot;.

<doc id="853813" wikidata="Q1501700" url="?curid=853813" title="Tropic of Cancer (novel)">
<text>Tropic of Cancer is an autobiographical novel by Henry Miller that is best known as &quot;notorious for its candid sexuality&quot;, with the resulting social controversy considered responsible for the &quot;free speech that we now take for granted in literature.&quot; It was first published in 1934 by the Obelisk Press in Paris, France, but this edition was banned in the United States. Its publication in 1961 in the United States by Grove Press led to obscenity trials that tested American laws on pornography in the early 1960s. In 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court declared the book non-obscene. It is regarded as an important work of 20th-century literature.

==Writing and publication==
Miller wrote the book between 1930 and 1934 during his &quot;nomadic life&quot; in Paris. The fictional Villa Borghese was actually 18 Villa Seurat in Paris&#x27; 14th arrondissement. As Miller discloses in the text of the book, he first intended to title it &quot;Crazy Cock&quot;. Miller gave the following explanation of why the book&#x27;s title was &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;: &quot;It was because to me cancer symbolizes the disease of civilization, the endpoint of the wrong path, the necessity to change course radically, to start completely over from scratch.&quot;

Anaïs Nin helped edit the book. In 1934, Jack Kahane&#x27;s Obelisk Press published the book with financial backing from Nin, who had borrowed the money from Otto Rank.

==Emerson quotation, preface, and introduction==
In the 1961 edition, opposite the novel&#x27;s title page is a quotation from Ralph Waldo Emerson:

These novels will give way, by and by, to diaries or autobiographies—captivating books, if only a man knew how to choose among what he calls his experiences that which is really his experience, and how to record truth truly.

The 1961 edition includes an introduction by Karl Shapiro written in 1960 and titled &quot;The Greatest Living Author&quot;. The first three sentences are:

I call Henry Miller the greatest living author because I think he is. I do not call him a poet because he has never written a poem; he even dislikes poetry, I think. But everything he has written is a poem in the best as well as in the broadest sense of the word.

Following the introduction is a preface written by Nin in 1934, which begins as follows:

Here is a book which, if such a thing were possible, might restore our appetite for the fundamental realities. The predominant note will seem one of bitterness, and bitterness there is, to the full. But there is also a wild extravagance, a mad gaiety, a verve, a gusto, at times almost a delirium.

==Summary==
Set in France (primarily Paris) during the late 1920s and early 1930s, &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; centers on Miller&#x27;s life as a struggling writer. Late in the novel, Miller explains his artistic approach to writing the book itself, stating:

Up to the present, my idea of collaborating with myself has been to get off the gold standard of literature. My idea briefly has been to present a resurrection of the emotions, to depict the conduct of a human being in the stratosphere of ideas, that is, in the grip of delirium.

Combining autobiography and fiction, some chapters follow a narrative of some kind and refer to Miller&#x27;s actual friends, colleagues, and workplaces; others are written as stream-of-consciousness reflections that are occasionally epiphanic. The novel is written in the first person, as are many of Miller&#x27;s other novels, and does not have a linear organization, but rather fluctuates frequently between the past and present.

==Themes==

The book largely functions as an immersive meditation on the human condition. As a struggling writer, Miller describes his experience living among a community of bohemians in Paris, where he intermittently suffers from hunger, homelessness, squalor, loneliness, and despair over his recent separation from his wife. Describing his perception of Paris during this time, Miller wrote:

One can live in Paris—I discovered that!—on just grief and anguish. A bitter nourishment—perhaps the best there is for certain people. At any rate, I had not yet come to the end of my rope. I was only flirting with disaster. ... I understood then why it is that Paris attracts the tortured, the hallucinated, the great maniacs of love. I understood why it is that here, at the very hub of the wheel, one can embrace the most fantastic, the most impossible theories, without finding them in the least strange; it is here that one reads again the books of his youth and the enigmas take on new meanings, one for every white hair. One walks the streets knowing that he is mad, possessed, because it is only too obvious that these cold, indifferent faces are the visages of one&#x27;s keepers. Here all boundaries fade away and the world reveals itself for the mad slaughterhouse that it is. The treadmill stretches away to infinitude, the hatches are closed down tight, logic runs rampant, with bloody cleaver flashing.

There are many passages explicitly describing the narrator&#x27;s sexual encounters. In 1978, literary scholar Donald Gutierrez argued that the sexual comedy in the book was &quot;undeniably low... [but with] a stronger visceral appeal than high comedy&quot;. The characters are caricatures, and the male characters &quot;stumbl[e] through the mazes of their conceptions of woman&quot;.

Music and dance are other recurrent themes in the book. Music is used &quot;as a sign of the flagging vitality Miller everywhere rejects&quot;. References to dancing include a comparison of loving Mona to a &quot;dance of death&quot;, and a call for the reader to join in &quot;a last expiring dance&quot; even though &quot;we are doomed&quot;.

==Characters==
Other than the first-person narrator &quot;Henry Miller&quot;, the major characters include:
; Boris: A friend who rents rooms at the Villa Borghese. The character was modeled after Michael Fraenkel, a writer who &quot;had sheltered Miller during his hobo days&quot; in 1930.
; Carl: A writer friend who complains about optimistic people, about Paris, and about writing. Miller helps Carl write love letters to &quot;the rich cunt, Irene&quot;, and Carl relates his encounter with her to Miller. Carl lives in squalor and rapes a minor. The inspiration for Carl was Miller&#x27;s friend Alfred Perlès, a writer.
; Collins: A sailor who befriends Fillmore and Miller. As Collins had fallen in love with a boy in the past, his undressing a sick Miller to put him to bed has been interpreted as evidence of a homoerotic desire for Miller.
; Fillmore: A &quot;young man in the diplomatic service&quot; who becomes friends with Miller. He invites Miller to stay with him; later the Russian &quot;princess&quot; Macha with &quot;the clap&quot; joins them. Fillmore and Miller disrupt a mass while hung over. Toward the end of the book, Fillmore promises to marry a French woman named Ginette who is pregnant by him, but she is physically abusive and controlling, and Miller convinces Fillmore to leave Paris without her. Fillmore&#x27;s real-life counterpart was Richard Galen Osborn, a lawyer.
; Mona: A character corresponding to Miller&#x27;s estranged second wife June Miller. Miller remembers Mona, who is now in America, nostalgically.
; Tania: A woman married to Sylvester. The character was modeled after Bertha Schrank, who was married to Joseph Schrank. It may also be noted that during the writing of the novel, Miller also had a passionate affair with Anais Nin; by changing the &quot;T&quot; to an &quot;S&quot;, one can make out Anais from Tania by rearranging the letters. It may also be noted that in one of Nin&#x27;s many passionate letters to Miller, she quotes his swoon found below. Tania has an affair with Miller, who fantasizes about her:

O Tania, where now is that warm cunt of yours, those fat, heavy garters, those soft, bulging thighs? There is a bone in my prick six inches long. I will ream out every wrinkle in your cunt, Tania, big with seed. I will send you home to your Sylvester with an ache in your belly and your womb turned inside out. Your Sylvester! Yes, he knows how to build a fire, but I know how to inflame a cunt. I shoot hot bolts into you, Tania, I make your ovaries incandescent.

; Van Norden: A friend of Miller&#x27;s who is &quot;probably the most sexually corrupt man&quot; in the book, having a &quot;total lack of empathy with women&quot;. Van Norden refers to women using terms such as &quot;my Georgia cunt&quot;, &quot;fucking cunt&quot;, &quot;rich cunt&quot;, &quot;married cunts&quot;, &quot;Danish cunt&quot;, and &quot;foolish cunts&quot;. Miller helps Van Norden move to a room in a hotel, where Van Norden brings women &quot;day in and out&quot;. The character was based on Wambly Bald, a gossip columnist.

==Legal issues==

===United States===
Upon the book&#x27;s publication in France in 1934, the United States Customs Service banned the book from being imported into the U.S. Frances Steloff sold copies of the novel smuggled from Paris during the 1930s at her Gotham Book Mart, which led to lawsuits. A copyright-infringing edition of the novel was published in New York City in 1940 by &quot;Medusa&quot; (Jacob Brussel); its last page claimed its place of publication to be Mexico. Brussel was eventually sent to jail for three years for the edition.

In 1950, Ernest Besig, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union in San Francisco, attempted to import &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; along with Miller&#x27;s other novel, &quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot;, to the United States. Customs detained the novels and Besig sued the government. Before the case went to trial, Besig requested a motion to admit 19 depositions from literary critics testifying to the &quot;literary value of the novels and to Miller&#x27;s stature as a serious writer.&quot; The motion was denied by Judge Louis A. Goodman. The case went to trial with Goodman presiding. Goodman declared both novels obscene. Besig appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit of Appeals, but the novels were once again declared &quot;obscene&quot; in a unanimous decision in &quot;Besig v. United States&quot;.

In 1961, when Grove Press legally published the book in the United States, over 60 obscenity lawsuits in over 21 states were brought against booksellers that sold it. The opinions of courts varied; for example, in his dissent from the majority holding that the book was not obscene, Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Michael Musmanno wrote &quot;Cancer&quot; is &quot;not a book. It is a cesspool, an open sewer, a pit of putrefaction, a slimy gathering of all that is rotten in the debris of human depravity.&quot;

Publisher Barney Rosset hired lawyer Charles Rembar to help Rosset lead the &quot;effort to assist every bookseller prosecuted, regardless of whether there was a legal obligation to do so.&quot; Rembar successfully argued two appeals cases, in Massachusetts and New Jersey, although the book continued to be judged obscene in New York and other states.

In 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court, in &quot;Grove Press, Inc. v. Gerstein&quot;, cited &quot;Jacobellis v. Ohio&quot; (which was decided the same day) and overruled state court findings that &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; was obscene.

===Other countries===

The book was banned outside the U.S. as well:
* In Canada, it was on the list of books banned by customs as of 1938. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police seized copies of the book from bookstores and public libraries in the early 1960s. By 1964, attitudes toward the book had &quot;liberalized&quot;.
* Only smuggled copies of the book were available in the United Kingdom after its publication in 1934. Scotland Yard contemplated banning its publication in Britain in the 1960s, but decided against the ban because literary figures such as T. S. Eliot were ready to defend the book publicly.
* In Australia the book was banned until the early 1970s when the Minister for Customs and Excise, Don Chipp, largely ended censorship of printed material in the country.
* In Finland all printed copies of the Finnish versions of the book were confiscated by the state before the books were to be published in 1962. The book was not published there in Finnish until 1970, however the book was available in Swedish and English.

==Critical reception==

===Individual reviewers===
In 1935, H. L. Mencken read the 1934 Paris edition, and sent an encouraging note to Miller: &quot;I read &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; a month ago. It seems to me to be a really excellent piece of work, and I so reported to the person who sent it to me. Of this, more when we meet.&quot;

George Orwell reviewed &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; in the &quot;New English Weekly&quot; in 1935. Orwell focused on Miller&#x27;s descriptions of sexual encounters, which he deemed significant for their &quot;attempt to get at real facts,&quot; and which he saw as a departure from dominant trends. Orwell argued that, although Miller concerns himself with uglier aspects of life, he is nonetheless not quite a pessimist, and seems to find that the contemplation of ugliness makes life more worthwhile rather than less. Concluding, he described &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; as &quot;a remarkable book&quot; and recommended it to &quot;anyone who can get hold of a copy.&quot; Returning to the novel in the essay &quot;Inside the Whale&quot; (1940), George Orwell wrote the following:

I earnestly counsel anyone who has not done so to read at least &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;. With a little ingenuity, or by paying a little over the published price, you can get hold of it, and even if parts of it disgust you, it will stick in your memory. ... Here in my opinion is the only imaginative prose-writer of the slightest value who has appeared among the English-speaking races for some years past. Even if that is objected to as an overstatement, it will probably be admitted that Miller is a writer out of the ordinary, worth more than a single glance...

Samuel Beckett hailed it as &quot;a momentous event in the history of modern writing.&quot; Norman Mailer, in his 1976 book on Miller entitled &quot;Genius and Lust&quot;, called it &quot;one of the ten or twenty great novels of our century, a revolution in consciousness equal to &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;&quot;.

Edmund Wilson said of the novel: 
The tone of the book is undoubtedly low; &quot;The Tropic of Cancer&quot;, in fact, from the point of view both of its happenings and of the language in which they are conveyed, is the lowest book of any real literary merit that I ever remember to have read... there is a strange amenity of temper and style which bathes the whole composition even when it is disgusting or tiresome.

 In 1980, Anatole Broyard described &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; as &quot;Mr. Miller&#x27;s first and best novel,&quot; showing &quot;a flair for finding symbolism in unobtrusive places&quot; and having &quot;beautiful sentence[s].&quot; Julian Symons wrote in 1993 that &quot;the shock effect [of the novel] has gone,&quot; although &quot;it remains an extraordinary document.&quot; A 2009 essay on the book by Ewan Morrison described it as a &quot;life-saver&quot; when he was &quot;wandering from drink to drink and bed to bed, dangerously close to total collapse.&quot;

===Appearances in lists of best books===
The book has been included in a number of lists of best books, such as the following:
* In July 1998, the Board of the Modern Library ranked &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; 50th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.
* In July 1998, students of the Radcliffe Publishing Course, at the request of the Modern Library editorial board, compiled their own list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century, and the book was ranked 84th.
* Between July 1998 and October 1998, an online reader poll by the Modern Library placed the novel 68th among the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.
* In a survey of librarians published in November 1998, the book was ranked 132nd in a list of 150 fiction books from the 20th century.
* &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the novel in its list of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005.
* The novel was listed in the 2006 book &quot;1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die&quot;.
* It was one of the &quot;1000 Novels Everyone Must Read&quot; in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2009.
* It was included in the list &quot;The 75 Books Every Man Should Read&quot; (2011) in &quot;Esquire&quot;.

==Influences==

===Influences on Miller===
Critics and Miller himself have claimed that Miller was influenced by the following in writing the novel:

* Louis-Ferdinand Céline, especially &quot;Journey to the End of the Night&quot; (1932), his semi-autobiographical first novel featuring a &quot;comic, antiheroic character&quot;. Nevertheless, George Orwell wrote &quot;Both books use unprintable words, both are in some sense autobiographical, but that is all.&quot;
* Fyodor Dostoyevsky, especially his &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; (1864).
* James Joyce. Nevertheless, Orwell felt that the novel did not resemble Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;.
* François Rabelais.
* Henry David Thoreau.
* Walt Whitman, who wrote in a similar style about common people. The poet is mentioned favorably in the novel several times, for example: &quot;In Whitman the whole American scene comes to life, her past and her future, her birth and her death. Whatever there is of value in America Whitman has expressed, and there is nothing more to be said.&quot;

===Novel&#x27;s influence on other writers===
&quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; &quot;has had a huge and indelible impact on both the American literary tradition and American society as a whole.&quot; The novel influenced many writers, as exemplified by the following:

* Lawrence Durrell&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;The Black Book&quot; was described as &quot;celebrat[ing] the Henry Miller of &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; as his [Durrell&#x27;s] literary father.&quot;
* It has been claimed that the novel impressed the Beat Generation writers in the 1960s such as Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs.
* Erica Jong wrote &quot;...when I was searching for the freedom to write [the 1973 novel] &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;, I picked up &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; and the sheer exuberance of the prose unlocked something in me.&quot; In turn, Miller praised &quot;Fear of Flying&quot; in 1974, comparing it to &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;.

==Adaptation==
The novel was adapted for a 1970 film &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; directed by Joseph Strick, and starring Rip Torn, James T. Callahan, and Ellen Burstyn. Miller was a &quot;technical consultant&quot; during the production of the movie; although he had reservations about the adaptation of the book, he praised the final movie. The film was rated X in the United States, which was later changed to an NC-17 rating.

==References or allusions in other works==
; Literature

* In his 1948 autobiography, poet and writer Robert W. Service wrote a few comments about &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, for example, &quot;Of course the book shocked me but I could not deny a strange flicker of genius in its wildest fights.&quot;
* In chapter 2 of William Gaddis&#x27;s 1955 novel &quot;The Recognitions&quot;, set in Paris in the 1930s, an artist complains &quot;I&#x27;ve got to show these pictures, I&#x27;ve got to sell some of them, but how can I have people coming up there with him there? He&#x27;s dying. I can&#x27;t put him out on the street, dying like that . . . even in Paris.&quot; (63–64) which echoes the scene in &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; where the artist Kruger tries to get the sick Miller out of his studio so that he can exhibit his pictures. &quot;People can&#x27;t look at pictures and statues with enthusiasm when a man is dying before their eyes.&quot; (Grove ed., 195)

<text>The Naked and the Dead is a novel written by Norman Mailer. Published by Rinehart &amp; Company in 1948, when he was 25, it was his debut novel. It depicts the experiences of a platoon during World War II, based partially on Mailer&#x27;s experiences as a cook with the 112th Cavalry Regiment during the Philippines Campaign in World War II. The book quickly became a bestseller, paving the way for other Mailer works such as &quot;The Deer Park&quot;, &quot;Advertisements for Myself&quot;, and &quot;The Time of Our Time&quot;. He believed &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; to be his most renowned work. It was the first popular novel about the war and is considered one of the greatest English-language novels. It was adapted into a film in 1958.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; 51st on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

==Plot==
The novel is divided into four parts: Wave; Argil and Mold; Plant and Phantom; and Wake. Within these parts are chorus sections, consisting of play-like dialogue between characters, as well as Time Machine sections, which give brief histories and flashbacks of individual characters&#x27; lives.

The story takes place on Anopopei, a fictional island somewhere in the South Pacific. American forces are faced with a campaign to drive out the Japanese so that Americans can advance into the Philippines. The novel focuses on the experiences of one platoon.

===Part One – Wave===
Staff Sergeant Sam Croft, Woodrow Wilson, and Roy Gallagher are playing cards the night before a scheduled attack. They are members of a recon platoon fighting in the Asian theater of World War II on a fictional island named Anopopei. The next morning, as the platoon takes boats to the island, they are nervous. Sgt. William Brown and Cpl. Stanley talk about women and the other men in their squad. The assault begins, and as the platoon waits for their scheduled turn to come to the island, they nervously joke amongst themselves. Once the squad reaches the beach, they begin digging foxholes. Stanley picks a fight with Oscar Ridges and Red Valsen, but ultimately Red knows the time is not right for a fight, and he backs down. Croft leaves to find his commanding officer. Once they&#x27;ve begun to settle in on the beach, the Japanese begin to attack. The platoon splits up. Cpl. Toglio, Hennessey, and Ridges have completed their foxholes, so they stay on the beach. Brown, Gallagher, Wilson, Red, Stanley, and Sgt. Julio Martinez run after Croft. As the beach is shelled, Hennessey panics and soils himself. He runs down the beach in an attempt to clean his pants, but he is killed by shrapnel.

===Part Two – Argil and Mold===
Croft pleads with higher officers to give him more men to replace those lost. He ultimately earns an extra replacement man, bringing the depleted platoon up to fourteen out of an intended twenty. Roth and Goldstein, two of the new men in the platoon, bond over their shared Jewish heritage.

Lt. Robert Hearn snaps at the officers&#x27; table, towards a couple other officers. Major General Edward Cummings steps in to prevent the situation from escalating further. Hearn and Cummings form an odd friendship. The two talk in Cummings&#x27; tent at night. They discuss philosophy and Cummings analyzes Hearn’s personality based on his behavior. Cummings tells Hearn that, as an officer, he must develop resentment for the enlisted men.

An intense storm comes in, destroying all the work the enlisted men had done the previous week building a bivouac. Tents go flying and everyone tries to stay as dry as they can. In an effort to keep the men&#x27;s spirits up during the storm, Red leads them in song. General Cummings makes the rounds to evaluate the storm damage and good-naturedly tells the men to expect a Japanese attack. Cummings makes further preparations up and down the line for the attack.

Roth and Minetta are separated from the rest of the squad, and when they hear gunfire, they assume recon must be in the middle of a firefight. As Roth keeps watch, he falls asleep at his post and wakes up Stanley a half hour late. The next day, the other half of the platoon moves anti-tank guns, which is difficult because of all the mud. Wyman drops his leg of the gun, and it rolls all the way back down a hill. When he tries to take responsibility, Croft thinks he&#x27;s covering for Goldstein, whom he blames instead. Ironically, Goldstein, who had been doing more than his share of work, comes to believe that he himself was responsible for the failure to move the gun.

The entire platoon meets back up, and as they sleep, they&#x27;re attacked by Japanese soldiers. Luckily, Croft is one of the men on watch when they attack, and he leads the platoon in repelling the Japanese, killing multiple Japanese soldiers. Toglio gets hit in the arm during the battle, which means he’ll get to go home. The soldiers say he&#x27;s lucky because his wound won&#x27;t prevent him from doing anything once it heals, but he still gets to return to America. The Japanese attack up and down the American lines, but the Americans fend off the attack at all points.

Cummings and Hearn continue their antagonistic relationship and Cummings assigns Hearn to oversee the construction of a recreation tent for the officers. Hearn realizes he is feeling the resentment towards the enlisted men that Cummings predicted. The two discuss the nature of war, soldiers, and fighting. They also discuss politics and philosophy, and Cummings beats Hearn in a game of chess. Cummings tells Hearn, &quot;My wife is a bitch.&quot; It is implied that Cummings is homosexual. &quot;Between [Cummings and Hearn] ... was the uncomfortable realization that they did not like each other at all.&quot;

Croft, Red and Gallagher run into four Japanese soldiers in the forest, who don&#x27;t notice them. Croft throws a grenade, killing three of the soldiers. Red goes to finish off the remaining soldier, but his gun jams. The soldier rushes Red with a bayonet, and Red trips and falls. Croft comes out and stops the soldier from killing Red, and the Japanese man surrenders. Red goes back to camp, and Croft and Gallagher take the soldier prisoner. Croft gives the prisoner a cigarette and some chocolate. The prisoner shows them a picture of his family, and Gallagher tells him that his wife is going to have a baby shortly. Croft gives him another cigarette and then shoots him in the face, which brings him a perverse sense of pleasure.

Wilson hears about a sergeant in another platoon who makes good liquor. He borrows money from a few other men to buy some. Wilson buys four canteens and brings three back to the squad, hiding one for himself. The men get drunk together. Wilson offers Goldstein a drink, but he refuses, saying that he is in the middle of writing a letter to his wife. The men mock Goldstein for being Jewish, and he realizes he hates everyone around him. He writes to his wife that he cannot remember why he is fighting. The drunk members of the platoon look for corpses to loot, but only find bodies that have been picked clean of &quot;souvenirs&quot;. Wilson drinks the canteen he stashed away before he goes on watch. As he stands by the machine gun, drunk, he sees a bush that he thinks would be a good hiding spot for a Japanese soldier, so he shoots the bush. The men wake up in a rush, thinking they are under attack. When Croft realizes that Wilson is the only one shooting, he yells at him.

Hearn sits on a beach relaxing with the other officers as the enlisted men work in the forest. He realizes he does not like any of the other officers, and he has stronger feelings of resentment towards the enlisted men. The men discuss all the important men they knew back in the States, and one of them claims to have known Hearn&#x27;s father. Hearn quickly realizes that this man did not know his father, and he likely didn&#x27;t know any of the other important people he claimed to know either. Major Dalleson makes an officer with a camera take pictures of him shooting pebbles with his carbine to send back to his skeet shooting club back home.

A load of mail comes in. Wyman is upset because he didn’t get anything from his girl back home. Red comforts him. Wilson&#x27;s wife is angry that he doesn&#x27;t send more money, and Wilson has Gallagher transcribe an angry response for him. Gallagher reads his own letters and feels a pang of jealousy to discover that an old friend earned a promotion that he was once up for. The chaplain calls Gallagher in and reports to him that his wife has died in childbirth, but his child survived. He continues to get letters from his wife, however. When the last letter arrives, Gallagher freaks out. He wonders what the point of fighting is. “He thought of Hennessy and his mouth tightened. Get your head blown off...for what, for what?”

Stanley, who just made corporal, clashes with Sgt. Brown. The two are unsure how to relate to each other. Stanley tells a story about a time he stole and then repaid money from a store he worked at to buy cheap furniture. From the beach, Croft spots a couple of Japanese soldiers in the forest. The platoon, led by Croft, shoots them both, but Minetta is hit in the leg. Brown expresses a contempt for women to Stanley, who begins to wonder if his own wife is being faithful.

The fighting settles down for a few weeks, and the lines begin to become stagnant. Cummings worries that the men are getting too comfortable in one place, which will make them unwilling to fight. He fears that if he cannot shift the front line, he will be replaced. His anxiety leads to health problems and constant outbursts directed at Hearn. Cummings commands Hearn to have Clellan, an enlisted man, put flowers in his tent each morning. This inspires conflict between Hearn and Clellan, which is what Cummings intends.

Hearn becomes frustrated and easily provoked. Cummings instructs him to go pick up supplies for the officers&#x27; mess hall, but secretly pays off the seller to keep the goods from Hearn. Hearn bribes an assistant to get the supplies and later realizes what Cummings has done. The incident reframes Hearn&#x27;s past experiences with Cummings, which he realizes have all been aimed to anger him. Furious, Hearn extinguishes a cigarette on the floor of Cummings&#x27;s tent when Cummings is gone.

Cummings discovers that a sergeant has been falsifying his patrol reports and realizes that his entire command has likely been doing the same thing. He vows to crack down on disciplinary issues. He returns to his tent to discover Hearn&#x27;s cigarette. He summons Hearn to his tent for the first time since they played chess. They have an intense discussion about the war and what will happen afterwards. Cummings reiterates his distaste for women. Cummings explains to Hearn that he wants to be a type of god. Cummings smokes a cigarette and throws it on the ground, just as Hearn did. He commands Hearn to pick up the cigarette or he will be court-martialed. Hearns asks him for a transfer to another division and Cummings denies his request and tells him to work labor under Dalleson. Hearns cuts Cummings back by asking, &quot;Short of bringing in every man in the outfit, all six thousand of them, and letting them pick up your cigarettes, how are you going to impress them?&quot;

Minetta is in the hospital from his gunshot wound, which is healing quickly. He worries that he will be sent back to the front lines, so he deliberately re-opens his own wound. When he realizes he will likely be discharged, he decides that he would rather feign insanity in order to get sent home than return to the platoon. Minetta fires his gun in the medical tent and yells about enemy soldiers. A doctor is skeptical, but Minetta is sent to a separate tent for mental patients.

Minetta spends a couple days in the mental ward and realizes he can&#x27;t take it anymore, so he claims to have woken up with no memory of the past week. The doctor who was skeptical pulls him aside and tells him that he knew Minetta was faking. When Minetta goes back to the platoon, he reports that the hospital was nicer than the front, so Red and Wilson try to report as sick. The doctors dismiss Red, but they caution Wilson that he&#x27;ll need surgery after the war.

Cummings tries to devise a new attack plan. He thinks long and hard about the most effective ways to outmaneuver the Japanese army. He comes up with a plan that he thinks will be militarily successful and also inspire the men to fight hard. Cummings asks Dalleson what he would think if Cummings transferred Hearn to another unit, which Dalleson perceives as odd, since generals usually wouldn&#x27;t be concerned with such minutiae.

Hearn is doing busywork recording patrol logs when Dalleson comes in. The two begin to scrap, but Cummings interrupts. He asks Hearn to bring him a large and heavy map, which Hearn semi-accidentally drops on Cummings&#x27;s foot.

When Cummings hears that he will not get naval support, he has to adjust his attack plan. He comes up with a new strategy. The plan is to send a recon squad, led by Hearn, who Cummings will transfer, to scout a trail from the backside of the island towards the beach, thereby allowing Cummings to send in a full company through that route from the back. The secondary company would then overpower the beach defenses, allowing for a full invasion from the beach.

===Part Three – Plant and Phantom===
Hearn joins the recon platoon on the boat to the other side of the island. He immediately realizes that Croft knows more than he does, and he doesn&#x27;t want the rest of the squad to realize that. Croft immediately dislikes Hearn because Hearn tries to befriend the men in the squad. Stanley tells Croft that he wishes Croft were still in charge. All the men are anxious about their own standing within the platoon, particularly the noncommissioned officers. Brown and Martinez discuss their fears. Croft and Hearn struggle for control of the platoon early in the mission, and Croft takes what Hearn will give him.

Roth and Minetta struggle to keep up with the rest of the platoon as they try to bushwack through the jungle. Croft gets on them for being slow, and Minetta snaps at Croft. Croft realizes Hearn will soon get comfortable around the platoon and take more control. Goldstein and Ridges end up doing most of Roth and Minetta’s work. Minetta picks on Roth for being Jewish, and Goldstein, who is also Jewish, takes Minetta&#x27;s side. The platoon slowly works their way through the jungle, cutting leaves at a rate of about two yards a minute. It takes them five hours to get through the jungle to open fields.

Hearn and Croft continue to subtly struggle for power. Hearn wants to try to go through a pass in the mountain range, but Croft wants to go over the mountain. Hearn continues to try to befriend the men in the platoon, which further angers Croft. Martinez, as the best at forging a trail, walks in front. Hearn stays in the back of the squad and realizes that no matter what he does he will not be able to get the men to like him.

The platoon comes across an exposed field. Hearn and Croft decide to split the platoon into two groups, one to lead the way and the other to provide cover. Croft offers to lead the first group, but Hearn elects to do it himself. The first group gets about halfway through the field when they begin taking fire. Hearn freezes when the shooting stops and realizes he is waiting for Croft to give an order. This realization frustrates him enough to get him to move. He leads the group in a retreat. They move away from the field for ten minutes before they realize Wilson is missing.

Wilson was shot in the stomach during the skirmish. He hides in a patch of tall grass, unseen by Japanese soldiers whom he can hear talking. Croft, Red, Gallagher, Ridges, and Goldstein go back to the field to get Wilson. They bring him back to the rest of the platoon and realize his injury is too severe for him to continue the mission.

Polack, Roth, and Minetta are getting materials to build a stretcher for Wilson, but Roth gets distracted by a baby bird. Everyone is looking at the bird as Croft builds the stretcher. Croft sees them gathered around the bird and goes into a rage. He crushes the bird and throws it. The men are furious about it, and Red decides that enough is enough and challenges Croft. Hearn breaks up the fight and orders Croft to apologize. He does so reluctantly and only becomes more angry at Hearn.

Brown, Stanley, Ridges, and Goldstein are assigned to carry Wilson back to the beach, and four more men (Minetta, Wyman, Polack, and Gallagher) go with them to help until they&#x27;re far from Japanese lines, leaving just five men: Hearn, Croft, Red, Roth, and Martinez. After Minetta, Wyman, Polack, and Gallagher return to the rest of the platoon, Brown stresses over the responsibility that he has been given. He realizes how important it is to him that they bring Wilson back alive.

Back on the other side of the island, Cummings is pleasantly surprised by how well the attacks are going. He realizes he has misjudged his men&#x27;s morale, but it has worked out for the best since the men are more inclined to fight when they are restless. He receives word that he will receive more naval support than he expected, and he wonders if the recon mission was necessary.

Roth is experiencing extreme anxiety, which is causing him stomach problems and keeping him from sleeping. He talks to Red and tries to thank him for standing up to Croft over the bird. Red recognizes that if he allows himself to become close with Roth, Roth&#x27;s death will be more painful, so he deliberately snaps at Roth to keep him distant. Red thinks to himself about the nature of the war. &quot;&#x27;Did the GIs die in vain?&#x27; [Red] snorted. Who didn&#x27;t know the answer? Of course they died in vain, any GI knew the score.&quot;

Hearn realizes that the mission has almost no chance of succeeding now that the Japanese know they&#x27;re there. He considers turning back, but he decides that he could not face Cummings empty-handed. He finally understands that his whole motivation throughout the entire mission was to get back at Cummings.

That night, Hearn admits that there is nothing left to be gained, and he decides to turn around the next morning. However, Croft persuades him to send out a single man to see if the Japanese are still in the field where they were ambushed. They agree that if the recon man sees anything, they&#x27;ll turn back. They pick Martinez as the recon man, but before he leaves, Croft tells Martinez to report to Hearn that he saw nothing when he gets back.

At first, Martinez sees nothing. However, he soon realizes he has wandered into the middle of a Japanese camp, full of sleeping soldiers. He quietly kills the guard and escapes. He makes his way further through the valley and finds another Japanese camp. At this point, Martinez returns to the platoon and reports his findings to Croft. Croft warns him not to say anything about what he has seen to Hearn. Croft tells Hearn that Martinez saw nothing on his recon mission, and Hearn feels obligated to try to go through the valley.

Hearn is leading the men back through the valley when he is unceremoniously shot and killed. Croft feels a sense of relief. &quot;No longer was there that confusion, that momentary internal pause before he gave an order.&quot; The men are generally apathetic about Hearn&#x27;s death, seeing him as just another officer. Croft takes control of the platoon and decides to take the platoon up and over the mountain.

Brown, Stanley, Ridges, and Goldstein are still carrying Wilson back to the beach, which is difficult given the terrain, heat, and fatigue. The group moves about a hundred yards at a time. Wilson is drifting in and out of consciousness and swearing at the men carrying him. Brown and Stanley fight. Wilson wants water, but Brown says he can&#x27;t have any because he has a stomach wound. Wilson begins to hallucinate. Wilson demands that they leave him, and each man individually considers it. Stanley collapses, and Brown stays with him, while Ridges and Goldstein continue to carry Wilson back to the beach.

Croft cracks down on discipline to reassert himself as the leader of the platoon. Martinez tells the other men that he saw Japanese soldiers on his recon mission the night before, but when he reported it to Hearn, he didn&#x27;t believe it. Martinez believes that this is the truth. Martinez and Gallagher, as the Catholics of the group, discuss their fear of death, particularly with no priest around to confess their sins to if something were to happen to them. Croft knows that he must reach the top of the mountain, or the trick he pulled that got Hearn killed would be for nothing. But the mountain is extremely difficult, and the men are not motivated.

Goldstein and Ridges continue to carry Wilson. They are exhausted beyond conversation and can only carry Wilson for ten to fifteen yards at a time. Wilson continues to mutter nonsense. By the end of the day, they&#x27;ve advanced five miles since they left Brown and Stanley.

Cummings leaves the island for Army headquarters to appeal for more naval support. Major Dalleson is left in charge. Dalleson receives a report indicating a large breach in the Japanese lines and sees no choice but to attack. He finds himself hoping that the report is untrue, because he is unsure of what to do in the case that the report is correct. He realizes he is unqualified to be leading the Army in such a situation, and he wishes Cummings had not left. Dalleson quickly throws together an attack plan, and as the plan is executed, he realizes there are many things he has not considered. Despite this, Dalleson employs the attacking units well, and arranges for effective support.

Dalleson&#x27;s attack is wildly successful. The Japanese general is killed, along with much of his support staff. Cummings returns with the destroyer he just begged for, only to find that there is no longer much need for it. The destroyer provides a little bit of support from the sea, and the Americans essentially wrap up the campaign. Cummings has forgotten entirely about the recon mission.

Up on the mountain, the platoon has no idea what is happening with the rest of the campaign. The mountain proves more treacherous than even Croft expected, and every man in the platoon, including Croft, feels an internal desire to turn back. Minetta, Wyman, and Roth are dragging behind the rest of the squad. Roth begins to fall every hundred feet or so, to the increasing irritation of the rest of the platoon. Roth falls again and tells them to leave him behind. Gallagher hits him and yells, &quot;Get up, you Jew bastard!&quot; The comment angers Roth enough to motivate him to stand and continue.

The mountain terrain is becoming increasingly dangerous, and they come to a narrow ledge in front of a gap of about four feet. Croft sees no way over it but to jump, and everyone in the platoon achieves the jump with relative ease. Roth knows he cannot make the jump, but as he stands on the ledge, he hears Gallagher goading him. He jumps but comes up short and falls to his death.

Goldstein and Ridges continue to struggle with Wilson. Ridges can no longer remember why Wilson should not be allowed to have water and gives him some. Ridges comes to the realization that no matter what they do, Wilson is going to die. Both Ridges and Goldstein consider leaving Wilson, but they both decide that they cannot for religious reasons. Ridges asks Wilson to repent before he dies, and Wilson, who is no longer lucid, agrees. As they rest in preparation to cross a river, Wilson dies. Ridges and Goldstein continue to carry his body, but as they cross the river, they lose it. Ridges and Goldstein make it back to the beach and realize they have nothing to do but sit and wait for the rest of the squad.

The platoon is shaken after Roth&#x27;s death. They move a little bit farther and decide to camp for the night. Gallagher realizes the responsibility he has for Roth&#x27;s death. The next morning, Gallagher and Martinez turn on Croft and demand that they turn back. However, Croft will not waver and orders the men to continue. Red declares that he will not continue either, and Croft threatens to shoot him. Red eventually backs down, bringing the lengthy power struggle between the two to a conclusion. Red admits to himself that the army &quot;has him licked&quot;.

Croft turns around a bend only to directly upset a hornets&#x27; nest. The men run back to evade the hornets, and in their hurry, toss away their packs and rifles. Within fifteen minutes, they&#x27;ve made it back farther than the place they started that morning. Croft accepts defeat and wearily gives the order that they will go back to the beach and wait for the boat to bring them back to the American lines.

All the surviving members of the platoon meet back up on the beach. Stanley and Brown arrive only a few hours before Croft&#x27;s group. Once the boat picks them up, the men learn that the campaign is essentially over. They share laughter for a while, which is slowly replaced by a silent sadness, mixed with uncertainty and frustration that the entire patrol was for naught.

===Part Four – Wake===
In the process of &quot;mopping up&quot;, Cummings discovers that a Japanese supply depot had been destroyed by artillery fire weeks before. The Japanese lines had been falling apart for months, and a week before the final attack, the Japanese had run out of ammo. Cummings looks back at his intelligence reports and sees that they gave no indication of Japanese weaknesses. “For a moment [Cummings] almost admitted that he had had very little or perhaps nothing at all to do with this victory, or indeed any victory – it had been accomplished by a random play of vulgar good luck larded into a causal net of factors too large, too vague, for him to comprehend. He allowed himself this thought ... but it caused him a deep depression.&quot; The novel ends with Major Dalleson thinking of a new way to implement map training exercises, indicating that despite the lessons each character in the novel learned about the meaninglessness of war, the structures will remain unchanged.

==Main characters==

*Hennessey is a newer member of the platoon. He is very cautious with all of his gear and movements so as to not get killed. When they arrive at the beach of Anopopei, he defecates in his pants out of fear during the opening action scene. He has a mental breakdown and runs down the beach in hopes of getting new pants. He is killed soon after by shrapnel from an exploding mortar shell.
*Woodrow Wilson is a large, impoverished white Southerner. He has a happy-go-lucky and generous nature. In his &quot;Time Machine&quot; we learn Wilson wakes up married to a woman named Alice after a drunken night at the bar. Their marriage consists of love affairs and money troubles. Later, Wilson suffers a long, agonizing death after being shot in the stomach by the Japanese; Brown, Goldstein, Ridges, and Stanley try to carry him back to the beach to be saved but he dies on the way there.
*Julio Martinez is a Mexican-American from Texas. He is nicknamed Japbait by Croft and made sergeant in General Cummings&#x27;s infantry division. Martinez was terrified, constantly on edge and an introvert throughout the beginning of the novel. He however, gains bravery through battle and is an excellent soldier, especially in terms of getting a scope for the land. He is well trusted by the other men in the platoon. Croft convinces Martinez to lie about a Japanese platoon he saw on a solo scouting mission, which leads to the death of Hearn and to the men hiking to Mount Anaka under Croft&#x27;s command.
*Sam Croft has a large ego and is coldblooded throughout the novel. At one point, he immorally kills a Japanese POW. Later, he squeezes Roth’s baby bird to death as if he is crushing all innocence. He loves war and is Mailer’s version of a psychopath within the novel. He is seen as one of the best soldiers in the platoon and the other men both fear and respect him as a leader. In his time capsule, we learned he was cheated on by the women he loved which led to him being cold and developing a love for war. At the conclusion of the book, Croft refuses to look forward to his homecoming, believing that the war will continue for much longer. After all, he enjoys the war because he finds a thrill in killing.
*Red Valsen claims he does not want to rise in the ranks. He appears numb to death and the war itself. As a child, he grew up in a mining town in Montana. Later, he runs away from home, losing contact with his entire family. After holding many jobs, Red moves in with his girlfriend Lois and her son. Afraid of commitment, Red joins the Army and runs away from Lois. While in the Army, Red loses contact with Lois just like he did with his own family.
*Lieutenant Robert Hearn is the stereotypical white liberal. Harvard educated and from an affluent family, Hearn is General Cummings’s assistant. He despises the caste system within the Army, wishing that he could reach out to the lower class foot soldiers. Later, Cummings transfers Hearn to Dalleson’s section. He leads the platoon through the jungle and to the mountain pass. Here, he is shot and killed quickly and anticlimactically not expecting Japanese resistance after Croft keeps the information from him.
*General Edward Cummings is power-hungry, often comparing himself to God. As a child, Cummings experiences gender-role confusion. This forces his father to send him to military school. Later, Cummings attends West Point. While at West Point, he meets Margaret and feels socially pressured into marrying her. Margaret and Cummings are married and never have children. They have an unhappy marriage, perhaps due to Cummings homosexual tendencies and feelings. It is apparent through his conversations with Hearn that he has romantic feelings for him.
*Roy Gallagher is Boston Irish and part of an Anti-Semitic gang called Christians United. He always seems angry throughout the novel. Later, he learns that his wife Mary died in childbirth, but their baby lived. Gallagher remains devastated for the rest of the novel.
*Roth is a depressing, fickle stereotypical representation of a Jew. He, however, refuses to consider himself to be such. Roth strongly associates with Judaism. Throughout the novel, he has a superiority complex because he is better educated than the other men of the platoon. Roth dies while climbing the mountain because he misses a jump and fails to grasp Gallagher’s hand.
*Joey Goldstein is also Jewish like Roth. However, unlike Roth, he does not view himself as better than his Christian friends. Goldstein grows up as a mamma’s boy and desires to own his own shop. Later, he becomes a welder and marries Natalie, despite his mother’s disapproval. After their son is born, Goldstein struggles to support his family and maintain a loving relationship with his wife. Throughout the war, Goldstein is well-respected by his comrades, although he does lack courage at times.
*William Brown is the stereotypical well-liked, neighborhood boy. Growing up in a middle-class family, Brown later attends a state university. Here he joins a fraternity and flunks out by freshman year. He marries a girl from his high school, Beverly, and lives a fairly boring life. Throughout the war, he worries that Beverly will cheat on him while he’s away. He is certain that he will throw her out of the house when he returns home.
*Stanley insists that women are no different from men. He trusts his wife Ruthie, who is the mother of his child. In some ways, he is the quiet feminist within the novel. He is also more ambitious than the other soldiers, since he is inexperienced in war; he desires to move up in ranks and befriends Brown in order to do so. 
*Toglio is an Italian-American. Patriotic, trusting, and good-natured, he is friends with most of his platoon. He sustains a million-dollar wound during combat and is sent home. Subsequently, as time passes, some characters come to envy his wound and grow to hate him.
*Casimir &quot;Polack&quot; Czienwicz comes from a lower-class Polish family. He grows up with seven siblings and, after his father dies, he enters the orphanage. At thirteen, an older woman seduces him multiple times. These experiences make Polack a tough, courageous soldier in the Army.
*Oscar Ridges is extremely Christian. He assures Wyman, who refers to him as “the preacher,” that “The Lord’ll keep me from shooting a Christian”. Despite his Christian beliefs, Ridges befriends Goldstein as his buddy. This friendship between a Jew and Christian demonstrates how the war brought men of different backgrounds together.
*Buddy Wyman does not play a major role within the novel. He dreams of becoming a war hero in order to support his mother and himself.
*Steven Minetta is twenty years old and was known as the “best dresser on the block” when he was growing up. He is eventually wounded but then returns to the platoon. At the conclusion of the novel, Minetta feels anger towards power figures and hopes to “expose the goddam Army.” 
*Dalleson was second in command to Cummings, who deliberately picked an officer of lower rank so that he could be intimidated. He was very nervous throughout the novel and did not trust his own judgment. At the end of the novel, however, it is Dalleson&#x27;s attack plan and his competent handling of forces that help win the battle against the Japanese.

==Themes==

Throughout the novel, Mailer dwells on many themes. These themes are recurring throughout his works and reappear in several of his later essays and novels.

Dehumanization of soldiers Commenting on the dehumanization of soldiers in &quot;The Naked and the Dead,&quot; Mailer said, &quot;The book finds man corrupted, confused to the point of helplessness, but it also find that there are limits beyond which he cannot be pushed.&quot; 
The narrator illustrates the exhaustion and humiliation of the soldiers&#x27; life: “When a man was harnessed into a pack and web belt and carried a rifle and two bandoliers and several grenades, a bayonet and a helmet, he felt as if he had a tourniquet over both shoulders and across his chest. It was hard to breathe and his limbs kept falling asleep.” Dehumanization of the soldier is also seen in Chapter 5 when the platoon had to carry antitank guns between 1st Battalion and A Company, which was about a mile of muddy trail. The men became numb and only went through the motions of carrying the guns and the generals disregarded the soldiers&#x27; exhaustion. The soldiers generally believed the army didn&#x27;t see them as people and that &quot;they don&#x27;t care if you live or die here [the infirmary]. All they want is to get you back where you can stop a bullet&quot;.

Mailer described &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; as &quot;&#x27;an odyssey of fear, exhaustion, and death,&#x27;&quot; and presents the natural world as &quot;uncaring, unyielding, implacable, and occasionally, beautiful.&quot; He adds insights into soldiers, like Martinez, in this context. Mailer writes that on his scouting mission, &quot;Martinez was functioning more like an animal than a human.&quot; Mailer also distils how dehumanizing the enemy was an essential aspect to the structure of war. Mailer writes, &quot;Martinez had a sense of unreality . . . They were men. The entire structure of war wavered in his brain for a moment.&quot;

Mailer concludes the platoon&#x27;s climb of Mount Anaka, reinforcing the loss of the individual within war, writing that &quot;[the soldiers] did not think of themselves as individual men any longer. They were merely envelopes of suffering. They had forgotten about the patrol, about the war, their past, they had even forgotten the earth they had just climbed.&quot;

Loneliness: Loneliness acted as an equalizer among soldiers and officers during the Second World War. Despite divisions of rank, economic, political, sexuality, or class, loneliness was a universal phenomenon among soldiers and officers during the Second World War. Furthermore, this factored into the construction of brotherhood in wartime. In &quot;The Naked and the Dead,&quot; Goldstein feels a connection and a sort of alliance with Roth in their Jewish heritage. Although the men in the platoon do have a sense of brotherhood with one another, they still feel alone during their deployment. 
Throughout the novel, the men long for women and deeper friendships. Roth, for example, wishes to have someone whom he “could talk to seriously.” He realizes that he doesn’t know his own comrades very well, since everyone he met when he initially entered the Army was either killed or reassigned. The men degrade women through the narrative; however, the absence of women factors into their reaction to disparage women, whose presence on the front lines was limited.

Death: The men are faced with unexpected deaths, such as Hennessey&#x27;s, Wilson, Hearn, Roth, and Gallagher’s wife who dies during childbirth. It is clear death surrounds them and their lives could be taken away in any moment. Cummings, having been surrounded by Army deaths the majority of his career, still never warms to the smell of rotting corpses. Red, like the other soldiers, realizes he or one of his comrades could be killed any minute. Even when they grew used to death and saw it as &quot;large and devastating and meaningless. Men who were killed were nearly men no longer around&quot;, a comrade&#x27;s death would cause &quot;the idea of death [to be] fresh and terrifying again&quot;. This fear of death also had a negative impact on the mental health and sanity of the men. For instance, Red states, &quot;Goddam Army gets you so you&#x27;re afraid to turn around&quot;. The men began to have a pessimistic view of life believing &quot;All dead things... everything lives to die&quot;. This was especially so since &quot;that&#x27;s all [soldiers] can ever do in the Army, sit and think&quot; which caused the thoughts and fears of death to be constant and prevalent.

The first death in the novel introduces this theme into the narrative. Red observes Hennessey&#x27;s death. The narrator reveals &quot;[u]ntil Hennessy had been killed, Red had accepted all the deaths of the men he knew as something large and devastating and meaningless . . . Hennessey&#x27;s death had opened a secret fear.&quot; Croft is also surprisingly moved by Hennessey&#x27;s death. The narrator declares &quot;Hennessey&#x27;s death had opened to Croft vistas of such omnipotence that he was afraid to consider it directly. All day the fact hovered about his head, tantalizing him with odd dreams and portents of power.&quot; Gallagher&#x27;s wife, Mary dies in childbirth in America. When Gallagher learns of her death, he continues to receive letters she sent before her death. Because of the disparity of time and space between men and women and their families during wartime, Gallagher considers that Mary &quot;lived for him only at the exact time when he read her letters.&quot;

On the mission across Mount Anaka, Roth discovers a baby bird, and the platoon, with the exception of Croft, are fascinated by the bird. The bird symbolizes innocence and the futility of death during war, as Roth cares for the baby bird and Croft is then enraged by it and crushes the bird in his hand. The contrast between Hearn and Roth&#x27;s deaths reflects both the bonds of brotherhood made among soldiers during war and the division between rank. Lieutenant Hearn&#x27;s death is immediate and has little recovery time, with the platoon mourning for ten or twenty seconds. Croft is even relieved by Hearn&#x27;s death, as he is now in charge of the platoon again. In contrast, Roth&#x27;s death &quot;shatter[s] the platoon.&quot; Instead of choosing to face Croft, Roth chose to risk falling to his death. Not only is the platoon shattered, Mailer underlines the division between the empowered and powerless, the narrator declares, &quot;It was Croft&#x27;s fault that Roth had been killed.&quot;

Power: Mailer&#x27;s predominant theme throughout &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; is illustrated through the power relations among the men, especially the relationships between commanding officers and subordinates. Power is distilled in General Cummings&#x27;s character. Cummings compares himself to the “chief monk” and God throughout the book. He also openly supports the class system within the military, and states Hearn must accept the “emotional prejudices of his class”, especially since he is an officer. People of higher ranks like Hearn and Cummings, after all, enjoy a better quality of life than the other foot soldiers. They sleep in larger staterooms while the soldiers share small rooms and are jammed into cots. This power system and power relations is reinforced within the missions. After Hearn dies, Croft is &quot;relieved&quot; that there is no longer a rival to his power and takes over leading the platoon up the mountain. While the other soldiers clearly want to stop and give up, they continue hiking the mountain simply because Croft commands them to. Chickenshit, as termed by Paul Fussell in &quot;Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War&quot;, was a major aspect of the theme of power in the novel. This is shown in how Cummings makes Hearn do humiliating tasks and in the end sends him on a mission knowing he will die, which is the ultimate chickenshit since he sent him to die solely to demonstrate his power. This is another instance where the undemocratic nature of the Army is apparent. Analogous to the replacement of &quot;fuck&quot; with &quot;fug,&quot; Fussell commented on the obscenity in war, arguing that explicit language in wartime became precious as a way for millions of conscripts to note, in a licensed way, their bitterness and anger.

During his service in World War II, Mailer did not yet have a plan for his war novel, but knew that he wanted to write a combat novel specifically set in the Philippines where &quot;the American hunger for power was palpable.&quot; Mailer told his sister that he wrote to his wife, Bea, about his plans for a novella with &quot;&#x27;a ridge or a peak as a symbol&#x27; of &#x27;the higher aspirations of man, the craving for the secret, the core of life,&#x27;&quot; and the Faustian need for power. In another letter to his wife, Mailer recounted an encounter with the top mess sergeant, who called him &quot;&#x27;a chickenshit son of a bitch.&#x27;&quot; This real life incident inspired Mailer to construct the pivotal confrontation between General Cummings and Lieutenant Hearn which leads indirectly to Hearn&#x27;s death. Initially, Cummings burdens Hearn with small, chickenshit tasks, and later Hearn retaliates within restricted power dynamics by dropping a match on the General&#x27;s floor and grounds it into the floor with his heel. According to General Cummings, &quot;what Hearn had done was equivalent to a soldier&#x27;s laying hands on his person.&quot; Thus, Cummings transfers Hearn to the platoon with Croft.

During World War II, General Patton was considered one of the most fastidious perpetuators of chickenshit, constantly enforcing the Army&#x27;s dress code on his soldiers. Similarly, in &quot;The Naked and the Dead,&quot; Dalleson harps on pride in the outfit of the Army.

J. Michael Lennon, Mailer&#x27;s definitive biographer, claims that &quot;Mailer&#x27;s landscape descriptions crackle and pulse with energy and must be ranked among the best of postwar American writers.&quot;. Diana Trilling observed, &quot;&#x27;The most dramatic moments in &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; are precipitated by intensities in nature.&#x27;&quot; While writing his combat novel, Mailer stated that &quot;[t]here are going to be troubling terrifying glimpses of order in disorder, of a horror which may or may not lurk beneath the surface of things.&#x27;&quot; Hennessey&#x27;s death as well as Croft, Reed, and Martinez&#x27;s &quot;primitive glimpses of a structure behind things&quot; is Mailer&#x27;s depiction of &#x27;&quot;the old business of man constructing little tag-ends of a Gd for himself in his moral wilderness.&#x27;&quot; Mailer argued that everything is more direct in war and this dramatically impacts the senses and one&#x27;s perception of realism. Mailer depicts this theme of power in nature and man&#x27;s subjection to that in Cummings and Croft&#x27;s reflection on Mount Anaka.

Homosexuality: The theme of homosexuality is most evident through Cummings. In his &quot;Time Machine&quot;, Mailer illustrates Cummings growing up experiencing gender-role confusion. Although his mother supports Cummings&#x27; identity, his father refuses to have a son who is homosexual and thus sends him to military school. This portages the notion of the Army being only for &quot;real men&quot;. However, there were a lot of homosexual men who were soldiers during WWII and as Allan Bérubé illustrates in &quot;Coming Out Under Fire: History of Gay Men and Women in World War Two&quot;, they were often seen as trusted and respected soldiers and medics. While in the Army, it is clear Cummings developed romantic feelings towards Hearn and sexually desired him. Through Cummings, Mailer illustrates his beliefs of homosexuality. Although Mailer believes being homosexual is evil, it is interesting he had the general be the homosexual character in the novel, especially since he depicts the general as being a powerful figure who is a good leader. Mailer also includes homosexual characters in his other works as well, such as in &quot;The Deer Park.&quot; Mailer directly addresses this theme and his beliefs of homosexuality in &quot;The Homosexual Villain&quot; stating he saw homosexuals as evil and always depicted them as the villain in his works but realized they were humans. Mailer utilizes the trope that men coded as homosexual are villains, repressed, and effeminate.

Brotherhood: &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; depicts the bonds of brotherhood during World War II, particularly examining the relationships among platoons. During World War II, soldiers developed strong friendships to which civilians could not relate. Croft expresses his feelings of brotherhood and tells his comrades, “You’re all good guys. You’re all chicken, and you’re all yellow, but you’re good guys. They ain’t a goddam thing wrong with you.” Mailer&#x27;s use of Croft in this scene emphasizes the unilateral sentiment and necessity of brotherhood during wartime. The theme recurs in Part III when Brown, Goldstein, Ridges, and Stanley attempt to carry the wounded Wilson back to camp. Despite the physical strains, the men persisted in order to save Wilson. The brotherhood of the platoon is also illustrated by the group&#x27;s reactions to the deaths of Hearn and Roth. New to the platoon, Hearn, when he was killed by Japanese soldiers, the platoon stood shocked for a couple of seconds but quickly moved on under the continued leadership of Croft. However, when in the wake of Roth&#x27;s death, &quot;the platoon was shattered. For ten minutes they huddled together on the shelf, too stricken, too terrified, to move on. The gravity of Roth&#x27;s death demonstrates the deep bond of brotherhood, pervasive not only during World War II but more specifically among the platoon.

Masculinity: &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; acts as Mailer&#x27;s introduction into the literary pantheon, and like his later works, Mailer portrays women as sexual objects. Many men, especially Brown, fear their wives are cheating on them while they are at war. This causes them to have more hatred towards women and a deep distrust towards them. Brown tells Stanley that if he finds out his wife cheated on him, he will beat her then throw her out. Later, in the Chorus “Women,” Polack insists that “there ain’t a fuggin woman is any good” and Brown agrees. Women are especially emphasized within &quot;Time Machine&quot; segments. In these segments, the men’s romantic relationships and sexual experiences are described in detail. In many of the &quot;Time Machines&quot;, such as Martinez&#x27;s, women are portrayed as simply sexual objects. In Croft&#x27;s &quot;Time Machine&quot;, we learn he was cheated on by the women he loved which resulted in him being cold and having a hatred towards women. The men seem to disregard the fact that they have cheated several times on their partners but show extreme hatred in the thought of their wives cheating on them. The only character that seems to positively view his wife is Gallagher, who becomes miserable and lost after she dies. This deep hatred for women, however, is a way to mask how strongly these men miss and desire women; they desperately need women for a variety of different reasons. Mailer exemplifies the construction of the masculine identity, and analyzes masculinity as socially constructed, context-specific and culture-bound. Male studies enforces &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; as part of American literature which reflects American society&#x27;s conception of masculinity based on the representation of masculinity in American fiction. The construction of American masculinity predicated off of violence and adventure narratives is particularly distilled in Croft as the typified combat soldier.

==Development==
Writing development: Before he left for basic training, Mailer was certain that he could write &quot;THE war novel&quot; based on his experiences as a cook and the experiences of soldiers in World War II. After returning home from the war, he moved to France with his first wife, Beatrice, where he studied at the Sorbonne in Paris. Here, in just 15 months, Mailer wrote his war novel as noted in his introduction to its Fiftieth Anniversary Edition.

Mailer states his writing inspiration came from the great Russian novelists like Leo Tolstoy. While writing, Mailer often read &quot;from &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; most mornings before he commenced his own work.&quot; Mailer believed Tolstoy enabled him to bring compassion to his pages; Tolstoy taught him &quot;compassion is valueless without severity.&quot; Mailer was convinced he brought this compassion to &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot;, and it is what enabled a 25-year-old to write an incredible war novel. The influence of the &quot;U.S.A.&quot; trilogy on the text has also been noted.

Throughout his writing process, Mailer explained, he &quot;used to write twenty-five pages of first draft a week,&quot; which allowed his novel to flow from page to page. Mailer felt this novel was the easiest for him to write, as he finished it quickly and passionately. He later stated, &quot;Part of me thought it was possibly the greatest book written since &quot;War and Peace&quot;.&quot;

Despite the author’s self-praise, he acknowledged his writing immaturity within the novel. Mailer insisted &quot;it was sloppily written in many parts (the words came too quickly and too easily) and there was hardly a noun in any sentence that was not holding hands with the nearest and most commonly available adjective.&quot; However, despite this criticism, Mailer believed the book deserved to be a best seller. It was written with vigor and contained acute descriptiveness which enabled readers to imagine what World War II was really like. Mailer admitted that he still returned to &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; occasionally and reread passages because they gave him hope “for all of us”.

Character that represents Mailer: Mailer stated he did not portray himself as one of the characters. However, he mentions the character of Roth is the most similar to himself. He states Roth&#x27;s experiences within the novel closely resembled his own experiences in WWII, especially in comparison to the other characters. This similarity is also evident in how they are both Jewish but don&#x27;t necessarily strongly declare being Jewish.

=== &quot;Fug&quot; ===
The publishers of &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; prevented Mailer from using the word &quot;fuck&quot; in his novel and had to use the euphemism &quot;fug&quot; instead. Mailer&#x27;s version of a subsequent incident follows:
The word has been a source of great embarrassment to me over the years because, you know, Tallulah Bankhead&#x27;s press agent, many years ago, got a story in the papers which went...&quot;Oh, hello, you&#x27;re Norman Mailer,&quot; said Tallulah Bankhead allegedly, &quot;You&#x27;re the young man that doesn&#x27;t know how to spell...&quot; You know, the four-letter word was indicated with all sorts of asterisks.

The incident is mentioned in John Green&#x27;s &quot;An Abundance of Katherines&quot; (2006). Colin Singleton tells Lindsey Lee Wells he likes to read literary criticism after reading a book. Colin says the publisher indicated that no one in 1948 would buy &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; because it contains even more F-bombs than it does Regular Bombs.&#x27; So Norman Mailer, as a kind of fug-you to the publisher, went through his 872-page book and changed every last F-word to &#x27;fug. 

The rock band the Fugs took their name from this word.

==Reception==
In 1948, at the age of twenty-five, Mailer published &quot;The Naked and the Dead,&quot; which was extremely successful. The book sold 200,000 copies in its first three months and remained on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller list for 62 weeks. Later, Modern Library named &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; one of the top hundred novels in the English language.

Publisher Bennett Cerf declared in 1948 &quot;only three novels published since the first of the year that were worth reading ... &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot;, &quot;The Ides of March&quot;, and &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot;.&quot;

Hartley Shawcross as Attorney General for England and Wales explained why he would not prosecute the book under the Obscene Publications Acts: &quot;Whilst there is much in this most tedious and lengthy book which is foul, lewd and revolting, looking at it as a whole I do not think that its intent is to corrupt or deprave or that it is likely to lead to any result other than disgust at its contents.&quot; Tom Driberg welcomed the decision. In its initial review the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; complained that the novel &quot;grows increasingly unreadable&quot; due to Mailer&#x27;s tendency to &quot;leave nothing out&quot;. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; described the novel as &quot;dull&quot; for the same reason.

Later, Gore Vidal would write:

My first reaction to &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; was: it’s a fake. A clever, talented, admirably executed fake. I have not changed my opinion of the book since… I do recall a fine description of men carrying a dying man down a mountain… Yet every time I got going in the narrative I would find myself stopped cold by a set of made-up, predictable characters taken not from life, but from the same novels all of us had read, and informed by a naïveté which was at its worst when Mailer went into his Time-Machine and wrote those passages which resemble nothing so much as smudged carbons of a Dos Passos work.

<text>Vrelo Bosne (; ) is a public park and a protected Nature Monument established around the source of the Bosna river, featuring the system of numerous springs at the foothills of Mount Igman, in the municipality of Ilidža, on the outskirts of Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Vrelo Bosne is one of the country&#x27;s popular natural landmarks and provides a quiet escape from city life.

==Geography and hydrology==

The Mala Bosna is the first section of the Bosna, and its source is the Vrelo Bosne spring, located at a.s.l. (according to an earlier source, a.s.l.) at the foothills of mount Igman, on the outskirts of Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The spring is one of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s chief natural landmarks and tourist attractions.

==Biodiversity==
Typical animals are ducks and swans among others.

==History, archaeology and culture==
A Roman Bridge is located not far from Vrelo Bosne on the Bosna river in the Ilidža municipality, which was built sometime between 1530 and 1550 from the original Roman stones and ruins of the bridge that stood there during the Roman period used to connect the Romans with the village of Aquae Sulphurae at the time. Ilidža is also known to have been an archaeological site dating 2400–2000BC.

The straight main avenue (&quot;Velika Aleja&quot;) leading inside contains traditional buildings from the Austro-Hungarian-era offering a peek into the luxuries of the past.

During the Bosnian War the park was not maintained and trees were chopped and used for heating by the local citizens. In 2000 the park was restored to its former look by local youths led by an international ecological organization.

==Park entry and features==
On a typical year more than 60,000 tourists visit the park.

The park is usually entered by foot or by horse-carriage via the 3 kilometre long avenue &quot;Velika Aleja&quot; () leading from the hotel complex and a spa at the northeastern end, called Banja Ilidža, toward springs at the far southwestern end. There is also &quot;Mala Aleja&quot; () which branches off towards Stojčevac to the southeast. 

The paths and roads inside the park are ideal for walks and bicycle riding and give the visitors the opportunity to take a closer look at the bubbling streams and waterfalls. Outdoor cafés and restaurants are available offering drinks and food but opening times vary from season to season. 

*Adults: 2 KM
*Pensioners, students, disabled: 1 KM
*Children from 7–16 years old: 1 KM
*Children with special needs or up to 7 years old: Entry free

Money from the park entry fees is used to up-keep the park by &quot;KJU Zaštićena prirodna područja Kantona Sarajevo&quot;.

The spring water at Vrelo Bosne is drinkable, however not recommended.

<text>Street luge is an extreme gravity-powered activity that involves riding a street luge board (sometimes referred to as a sled) down a paved road or course. Street luge is also known as land luge or road luge. Like skateboarding, street luge is often done for sport and for recreation.

Other than the supine riding position and very high speeds (70–102 mph / 112–164 km/h), street luge has little relation to its winter namesake (luge).

==History==
Street luge was born in Southern California as downhill skateboarders found they could reach faster speeds by lying down on their skateboards. This early form of the sport is now referred to as &quot;laydown skateboarding&quot;.

In 1975, the first professional race was held at Signal Hill, California, and hosted by the U.S. Skateboard Association. The race winner was based on top speed. The boards used in this race varied from basic skateboards to complex skate cars in which the rider was completely enclosed by plastic or fiberglass. The sport was not commonly referred to as street luge at this time but the term luge was used to describe some participants&#x27; riding position. Most contestants were standing up; however, an opening in the rules enabled riders to choose their own board position, including supine. By 1978, repeated injuries to both riders and spectators halted the races at Signal Hill.

Roger Hickey and Don Baumea from the Signal Hill races kept the sport alive by continuing to hold races in Southern California. Around the early 1990s, both underground and professional races continued to be held in Southern California by such organizations as the Underground Racers Association (URA), Federation of International Gravity Racing (FIGR) and Road Racers Association for International Luge (RAIL). Race organizers in the 1980s and 1990s started implementing many more equipment, safety and race regulations.

Meanwhile, in the early 1990s, some Austrian skateboarders started sitting down on their skateboards on the way back from teaching skiing in the Alps. This activity lead to a classic style street luge race in the Kaunertal Valley, in western Austria, called Hot Heels. At the outset, the founders started lying down on wooden boards closer to large skateboards than the usual street luge, and with smaller wheels: this came to be known as classic luge, or buttboard. The race, which ran until 2003, came to function as a de facto world championships, including all the downhill disciplines such as street luge, stand up downhill skateboard, classic luge, gravity biking and inline skating. There is now a healthy street luge riding and racing presence in many European countries (see below).

In the mid 1990s, ESPN’s X Games showcased street luge to the world and the sport was originally sanctioned by RAIL, then by the International Gravity Sports Association (IGSA). NBC followed ESPN’s lead and created the Gravity Games in which the sport was sanctioned by Extreme Downhill International (EDI). Smaller events were also held in Canada, South Africa, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden and the U.K. Qualification criteria for these events varied and were controlled by each of the sanctioning bodies.

After a media splurge through the late 1990s and early 2000s, extreme sports like street luge have taken a lower profile. The X Games has become more stadium-based for commercial reasons. Others, such as the Gravity Games, Hot Heels and the Australian Xtreme Games, have disappeared.

While no longer a sport in either the X Games or Gravity Games, street luge is a burgeoning sport in numerous countries with competitions around the globe. There are approximately 1200 active street luge riders in the world.

==World record for gravity-powered speed==
On September 10, 2016, American Mike McIntyre broke the world record by reaching 164.12 km/h (101.98 mph) at l&#x27;Ultime Descente on his third of three runs, with all three runs breaking the 100 mph barrier. McIntyre would crash heavily in the treacherous nadir of the descent during his shutdown process and spent the night in a Quebec City hospital.

==Equipment, safety and racing==

Street lugers ride boards in the supine position. The design of these boards is based on the rules set forth from different governing bodies. Consistent design elements include:
# The use of lean-activated steering skateboard-style trucks
# The prohibited use of mechanical brakes
# Front and rear padding
# Length, width and weight restrictions – details depend on sanctioning body
# The prohibited use of parts that enclose the rider’s body or hinder braking

Current street luge boards are made from many materials including steel, aluminum, wood, and carbon fibre. The majority of the street luge boards in the world are custom made although commercial models are now available. Actual board designs can vary as the construction rules are very open and allow for numerous design considerations.

An offshoot of street luge is classic luge. With more regulations and limits to construction and equipment it was designed to be a simpler, low cost class as compared to street luge. Classic Luge boards are typically made from wood, are limited to maximum dimensions of 49 inches by 12 inches (124 cm by 30 cm) and may only have four wheels. Maximum wheels diameter may also be restricted depending on the sanctioning body and race organizer.

Riders participating in sanctioned racing events are required to wear safety equipment including:
# Hard-shell helmet with chin strap and face shield or goggles
# Leather or Kevlar racing suit
# Leather or Kevlar gloves
# Sturdy Shoes

Race courses are usually held on mountain roads but have been held on city streets as well. Courses can range in length from 0.5 to 3 miles (1 to 5 km) and vary in layout (number and severity of turns). Racing can take the following formats:
# Single elimination with 2, 4, or 6 racers at a time
# Double elimination with 2, 4, or 6 racers at a time
# Timed trials
# No elimination points system (points for each finishing position in several heats)
# Mass runs, with up to 20 racers at a time (positions are decided by the order they cross the finish line)

==Governing bodies==
There are currently two worldwide governing bodies for street luge, the International Gravity Sports Association (IGSA) and the International Downhill Federation (IDF).

The ruling body for street luge during the 1997–2001 X Games was the IGSA.

<doc id="853826" wikidata="Q422584" url="?curid=853826" title="Electrical breakdown">
<text>In electronics, electrical breakdown or dielectric breakdown is a process that occurs when an electrically insulating material (a dielectric), subjected to a high enough voltage, suddenly becomes a conductor and current flows through it. All insulating materials undergo breakdown when the electric field caused by an applied voltage exceeds the material&#x27;s dielectric strength. The voltage at which a given insulating object becomes conductive is called its &quot;breakdown voltage&quot; and, in addition to its dielectric strength, depends on its size and shape, and the location on the object at which the voltage is applied. Under sufficient voltage, electrical breakdown can occur within solids, liquids, or gases (and theoretically even in a vacuum). However, the specific breakdown mechanisms are different for each kind of dielectric medium.

Electrical breakdown may be a momentary event (as in an electrostatic discharge), or may lead to a continuous electric arc if protective devices fail to interrupt the current in a power circuit. In this case electrical breakdown can cause catastrophic failure of electrical equipment, and fire hazards.

==Explanation==
Electric current is a flow of electrically charged particles in a material caused by an electric field, usually created by a voltage across the material. The mobile charged particles which make up an electric current are called charge carriers. In different substances different particles serve as charge carriers: in metals and some other solids some of the outer electrons of each atom (conduction electrons) are able to move about in the material; in electrolytes and plasma it is ions, electrically charged atoms or molecules, and electrons that are charge carriers. A material that has a high concentration of charge carriers available for conduction, such as a metal, will conduct a large current with a given electric field, and thus has a low electrical resistivity; this is called an electrical conductor. A material that has few charge carriers, such as glass or ceramic, will conduct very little current with a given electric field and has a high resistivity; this is called an electrical insulator or dielectric. All matter is composed of charged particles, but the common property of insulators is that the negative charges, the orbital electrons, are tightly bound to the positive charges, the atomic nuclei, and cannot easily be freed to become mobile. 
However, when a large enough electric field is applied to any insulating substance, at a certain field strength the number of charge carriers in the material suddenly increases by many orders of magnitude, so its resistance drops and it becomes a conductor. This is called &quot;electrical breakdown&quot;. The physical mechanism causing breakdown differs in different substances. In a solid, it usually occurs when the electric field becomes strong enough to pull outer valence electrons away from their atoms, so they become mobile, and the heat created by their collisions with other atoms releases additional electrons. In a gas, the electric field accelerates the small number of free electrons naturally present (due to processes like photoionization and radioactive decay) to a high enough speed that when they collide with gas molecules they knock additional electrons out of them, called ionization, which go on to ionize more molecules creating more free electrons and ions in a chain reaction called a Townsend discharge. As these examples indicate, in most materials breakdown occurs by a rapid chain reaction in which mobile charged particles release additional charged particles.

=== Dielectric strength and breakdown voltage ===

The electric field strength (in volts per metre) at which breakdown occurs is an intrinsic property of the insulating material called its &quot;dielectric strength&quot;. The electric field is usually caused by a voltage applied across the material. The applied voltage required to cause breakdown in a given insulating object is called the object&#x27;s &quot;breakdown voltage&quot;. The electric field created in a given insulating object by an applied voltage varies depending on the size and shape of the object and the location on the object of the electrical contacts where the voltage is applied, so in addition to the material&#x27;s dielectric strength, the breakdown voltage depends on these factors.

In a flat sheet of insulator between two flat metal electrodes, the electric field formula_1 is proportional to the voltage formula_2 divided by the thickness formula_3 of the insulator, so in general the breakdown voltage formula_4 is proportional to the dielectric strength formula_5 and the length of insulation between two conductors 
:formula_6
However the shape of the conductors can influence the breakdown voltage.

=== Breakdown process ===
Breakdown is a local process, and in an insulating medium subjected to a high voltage difference begins at whatever point in the insulator the electric field first exceeds the local dielectric strength of the material. Since the electric field at the surface of a conductor is highest at protruding parts, sharp points and edges, for a conductor immersed in a homogeneous insulator like air or oil, breakdown usually starts at these points. In a solid insulator, breakdown often starts at a local defect , such as a crack or bubble in a ceramic insulator. If the voltage is low enough, breakdown may remain limited to this small region; this is called &quot;partial discharge&quot;. In a gas adjacent to a sharp pointed conductor, local breakdown processes, corona discharge or brush discharge, can allow current to leak off the conductor into the gas as ions. However, usually in a homogeneous solid insulator after one region has broken down and become conductive there is no voltage drop across it, and the full voltage difference is applied to the remaining length of the insulator. Since the voltage drop is now across a shorter length, this creates a higher electric field in the remaining material, which causes more material to break down. So the breakdown region rapidly (within nanoseconds) spreads in the direction of the voltage gradient (electric field) from one end of the insulator to the other, until a continuous conductive path is created through the material between the two contacts applying the voltage difference, allowing a current to flow between them, starting an electric arc.

Electrical breakdown can also occur without an applied voltage, due to an electromagnetic wave. When a sufficiently intense electromagnetic wave passes through a material medium, the electric field of the wave can be strong enough to cause temporary electrical breakdown. For example a laser beam focused to a small spot in air can cause electrical breakdown and ionization of the air at the focal point.

=== Consequences ===
In practical electric circuits electrical breakdown is usually an unwanted occurrence, a failure of insulating material causing a short circuit, possibly resulting in a catastrophic failure of the equipment. In power circuits, the sudden drop in resistance causes a high current to flow through the material, beginning an electric arc, and if safety devices do not interrupt the current quickly the sudden extreme Joule heating may cause the insulating material or other parts of the circuit to melt or vaporize explosively, damaging the equipment and creating a fire hazard. However, external protective devices in the circuit such as circuit breakers and current limiting can prevent the high current; and the breakdown process itself is not necessarily destructive and may be reversible, as for example in a gas discharge lamp tube. If the current supplied by the external circuit is removed sufficiently quickly, no damage is done to the material, and reducing the applied voltage causes a transition back to the material&#x27;s insulating state.

Lightning and sparks due to static electricity are natural examples of the electrical breakdown of air. Electrical breakdown is part of the normal operating mode of a number of electrical components, such as gas discharge lamps like fluorescent lights, and neon lights, zener diodes, avalanche diodes, IMPATT diodes, mercury-vapor rectifiers, thyratron, ignitron, and krytron tubes, and spark plugs.

== Failure of electrical insulation ==
Electrical breakdown is often associated with the failure of solid or liquid insulating materials used inside high voltage transformers or capacitors in the electricity distribution grid, usually resulting in a short circuit or a blown fuse. Electrical breakdown can also occur across the insulators that suspend overhead power lines, within underground power cables, or lines arcing to nearby branches of trees.

Dielectric breakdown is also important in the design of integrated circuits and other solid state electronic devices. Insulating layers in such devices are designed to withstand normal operating voltages, but higher voltage such as from static electricity may destroy these layers, rendering a device useless. The dielectric strength of capacitors limits how much energy can be stored and the safe working voltage for the device.

== Mechanisms ==
Breakdown mechanisms differ in solids, liquids, and gases. Breakdown is influenced by electrode material, sharp curvature of conductor material (resulting in locally intensified electric fields), the size of the gap between the electrodes, and the density of the material in the gap.

===Solids===
In solid materials (such as in power cables) a long-time partial discharge caused by a defect such as a crack or bubble in the material typically precedes breakdown. The partial discharge is a local ionization and heating of the area, degrading the insulators and metals nearest to the defect. Ultimately the partial discharge chars through a channel of carbonized material that conducts current across the gap.

===Liquids===
Possible mechanisms for breakdown in liquids include bubbles, small impurities, and electrical super-heating. The process of breakdown in liquids is complicated by hydrodynamic effects, since additional pressure is exerted on the fluid by the non-linear electrical field strength in the gap between the electrodes.

In liquefied gases used as coolants for superconductivity – such as Helium at 4.2 K or Nitrogen at 77 K – bubbles can induce breakdown.

In oil-cooled and oil-insulated transformers the field strength for breakdown is about 20 kV/mm (as compared to 3 kV/mm for dry air). Despite the purified oils used, small particle contaminants are blamed.

===Gases===

Electrical breakdown occurs within a gas when the dielectric strength of the gas is exceeded. Regions of intense voltage gradients can cause nearby gas to partially ionize and begin conducting. This is done deliberately in low pressure discharges such as in fluorescent lights. The voltage that leads to electrical breakdown of a gas is approximated by Paschen&#x27;s Law.

Partial discharge in air causes the &quot;fresh air&quot; smell of ozone during thunderstorms or around high-voltage equipment. Although air is normally an excellent insulator, when stressed by a sufficiently high voltage (an electric field of about 3 x 106 V/m or 3 kV/mm), air can begin to break down, becoming partially conductive. Across relatively small gaps, breakdown voltage in air is a function of gap length times pressure. If the voltage is sufficiently high, complete electrical breakdown of the air will culminate in an electrical spark or an electric arc that bridges the entire gap.

The color of the spark depends upon the gases that make up the gaseous media. While the small sparks generated by static electricity may barely be audible, larger sparks are often accompanied by a loud snap or bang. Lightning is an example of an immense spark that can be many miles long and thunder produced by it can be heard from a very large distance.

===Persistent arcs=== 
If a fuse or circuit breaker fails to interrupt the current through a spark in a power circuit, current may continue, forming a very hot electric arc (about 30 000 degrees C). The color of an arc depends primarily upon the conducting gasses, some of which may have been solids before being vaporized and mixed into the hot plasma in the arc. The free ions in and around the arc recombine to create new chemical compounds, such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide. Ozone is most easily noticed due to its distinct odour.

Although sparks and arcs are usually undesirable, they can be useful in applications such as spark plugs for gasoline engines, electrical welding of metals, or for metal melting in an electric arc furnace. Prior to gas discharge the gas glows with distinct colors that depend on the energy levels of the atoms. Not all mechanisms are fully understood.

The vacuum itself is expected to undergo electrical breakdown at or near the Schwinger limit.

=== Voltage-current relation ===
Before gas breakdown, there is a non-linear relation between voltage and current as shown in the figure. In region 1, there are free ions that can be accelerated by the field and induce a current. These will be saturated after a certain voltage and give a constant current, region 2. Region 3 and 4 are caused by ion avalanche as explained by the Townsend discharge mechanism.

Friedrich Paschen established the relation between the breakdown condition to breakdown voltage. He derived a formula that defines the breakdown voltage (formula_4) for uniform field gaps as a function of gap length (formula_8) and gap pressure (formula_9).

: formula_10

Paschen also derived a relation between the minimum value of pressure gap for which breakdown occurs with a minimum voltage.

: formula_11

formula_12 and formula_13 are constants depending on the gas used.

==Corona breakdown==
Partial breakdown of the air occurs as a corona discharge on high voltage conductors at points with the highest electrical stress. Conductors that have sharp points, or balls with small radii, are prone to causing dielectric breakdown, because the field strength around points is higher than that around a flat surface. High-voltage apparatus is designed with rounded curves and grading rings to avoid concentrated fields that precipitate breakdown.

===Appearance===
Corona is sometimes seen as a bluish glow around high voltage wires and heard as a sizzling sound along high voltage power lines. Corona also generates radio frequency noise that can also be heard as ‘static’ or buzzing on radio receivers. Corona can also occur naturally as &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; at high points such as church spires, treetops, or ship masts during thunderstorms.

===Ozone generation===
Corona discharge ozone generators have been used for more than 30 years in the water purification process. Ozone is a toxic gas, even more potent than chlorine. In a typical drinking water treatment plant, the ozone gas is dissolved into the filtered water to kill bacteria and destroy viruses. Ozone also removes the bad odours and taste from the water. The main advantage of ozone is that any residual overdose decomposes to gaseous oxygen well before the water reaches the consumer. This is in contrast with chlorine gas or chlorine salts, which stay in the water longer and can be tasted by the consumer.

===Other uses===
Although corona discharge is usually undesirable, until recently it was essential in the operation of photocopiers (xerography) and laser printers. Many modern copiers and laser printers now charge the photoconductor drum with an electrically conductive roller, reducing undesirable indoor ozone pollution.

Lightning rods use corona discharge to create conductive paths in the air that point towards the rod, deflecting potentially-damaging lightning away from buildings and other structures.

Corona discharges are also used to modify the surface properties of many polymers. An example is the corona treatment of plastic materials which allows paint or ink to adhere properly.

==Disruptive devices ==

A disruptive device is designed to electrically overstress a dielectric beyond its dielectric strength so as to intentionally cause electrical breakdown of the device. The disruption causes a sudden transition of a portion of the dielectric, from an insulating state to a highly conductive state. This transition is characterized by the formation of an electric spark or plasma channel, possibly followed by an electric arc through part of the dielectric material.

If the dielectric happens to be a solid, permanent physical and chemical changes along the path of the discharge will significantly reduce the material&#x27;s dielectric strength, and the device can only be used one time. However, if the dielectric material is a liquid or gas, the dielectric can fully recover its insulating properties once current through the plasma channel has been externally interrupted.

Commercial spark gaps use this property to abruptly switch high voltages in pulsed power systems, to provide surge protection for telecommunication and electrical power systems, and ignite fuel via spark plugs in internal combustion engines. Spark-gap transmitters were used in early radio telegraph systems.

<text>Parade&#x27;s End is a tetralogy of novels by the British novelist and poet Ford Madox Ford, first published from 1924 to 1928. The novels chronicle the life of a member of the English gentry before, during and after World War I. The setting is mainly England and the Western Front of the First World War, in which Ford had served as an officer in the Welch Regiment, a life he vividly depicts. The individual novels are &quot;Some Do Not ...&quot; (1924), &quot;No More Parades&quot; (1925), &quot;A Man Could Stand Up —&quot; (1926) and &quot;Last Post&quot; (1928).

The work is a complex tale written in a modernist style (&quot;it is as modern and modernist as they come&quot;), which does not concentrate on detailing the experience of war. Robie Macauley, in his introduction to the Borzoi edition of 1950, described it as &quot;by no means a simple warning as to what modern warfare is like... [but] something complex and baffling [to many contemporary readers]. There was a love story with no passionate scenes; there were trenches but no battles; there was a tragedy without a denouement.&quot; The novel is about the psychological result of the war on the participants and on society. In his introduction to the third novel, &quot;A Man Could Stand Up--&quot;, Ford wrote, &quot;This is what the late war was like: this is how modern fighting of the organized, scientific type affects the mind&quot;. In December 2010, John N. Gray hailed the work as &quot;possibly the greatest 20th-century novel in English&quot;, and Mary Gordon labelled it as &quot;quite simply, the best fictional treatment of war in the history of the novel&quot;.

== Background ==
Ford stated that his purpose in creating this work was &quot;the obviating of all future wars&quot;. The four novels were originally published under the titles: &quot;Some Do Not ...&quot; (1924), &quot;No More Parades&quot; (1925), &quot;A Man Could Stand Up —&quot; (1926) and &quot;Last Post&quot; (&quot;The Last Post&quot; in the USA) (1928); the books were combined into one volume as &quot;Parade&#x27;s End&quot; in 1950. In 2012, HBO, BBC and VRT produced a television adaptation, written by Tom Stoppard and starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Rebecca Hall.

== Plot summary ==
The novels chronicle the life of Christopher Tietjens, &quot;the last Tory&quot;, a brilliant government statistician from a wealthy landowning family who serves in the British Army during the First World War. His wife Sylvia is a flippant socialite who seems intent on ruining him through her sexual promiscuity. Tietjens may or may not be the father of his wife&#x27;s child. Meanwhile, his incipient affair with Valentine Wannop, a high-spirited pacifist and women&#x27;s suffragist, has not been consummated, despite what all their friends believe.

The two central novels follow Tietjens in the army in France and Belgium, as well as Sylvia and Valentine in their separate paths over the course of the war.

== Literary notes ==
Notably among war novels, Tietjens&#x27; consciousness takes primacy over the war-events it filters. Ford constructs a protagonist for whom the war is but one layer of his life, and not always even the most prominent even though he is in the middle of it. In a narrative beginning before the war and ending after the armistice, Ford&#x27;s project is to situate an unimaginable cataclysm within a social, moral, and psychological complexity.

Robie Macauley wrote that &quot;the Tietjens story...is less about the incident of a single war than about a whole era&quot; and its destruction. &quot;Ford took as the scheme for his allegory the life of one man, Christopher Tietjens, a member of an extinct species, which, as he says, &#x27;died out sometime in the 18th century.&#x27; Representing in himself the order and stability of another age, he must experience the disruptive present.&quot;

The work is also striking in its investigation of the relationship among gender dynamics, war, and societal upheaval. Scholar David Ayers notes that &quot;&quot;Parade&#x27;s End&quot; is virtually alone of the male writing of the 1920s in affirming the ascendance of women and advocating a course of graceful withdrawal from dominance for men&quot;.

== Textual history ==
Penguin reissued the four novels separately in 1948, just after the Second World War.

The novels were first combined into one volume under the collective title &quot;Parade&#x27;s End&quot; (which had been suggested by Ford, although he did not live to see an omnibus version) in the Knopf edition of 1950, which has been the basis of several subsequent reissues.

Graham Greene controversially omitted &quot;Last Post&quot; from his 1963 Bodley Head edition of Ford&#x27;s writing, calling it &quot;an afterthought which he (Ford) had not intended to write and later regretted having written.&quot; Greene went on to state that &quot;...the &quot;Last Post&quot; was more than a mistake—it was a disaster, a disaster which has delayed a full critical appreciation of &quot;Parade&#x27;s End&quot;.&quot; Certainly &quot;Last Post&quot; is very different from the other three novels; it is concerned with peace and reconstruction, and Christopher Tietjens is absent for most of the narrative, which is structured as a series of interior monologues by those closest to him. Yet it has had influential admirers, from Dorothy Parker and Carl Clinton Van Doren to Anthony Burgess and Malcolm Bradbury (who included it in his 1992 Everyman edition).

Carcanet Press published the first annotated and critical edition of the novels, edited by Max Saunders, Joseph Wiesenfarth, Sara Haslam, and Paul Skinner, in 2010–11.

<text>The University of North Florida (UNF) is a public research university in Jacksonville, Florida, United States. It is part of the State University System of Florida and is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award baccalaureate, masters, and doctorate degrees. Its campus comprises 1,300 acres amid a natural preserve on Jacksonville&#x27;s Southside. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. The current president is Moez Limayem.

UNF was established in 1965 and began offering classes in 1972. UNF was initially designated an upper division college for juniors and seniors. It began admitting freshmen in 1984. UNF is organized into six colleges, five of which offer undergraduate and graduate degree programs, including doctoral degree programs, with noted business, coastal biology, nursing, nutrition, and music programs. Most students reside off campus, though there are six areas of on-campus housing. In 2006, the Social Sciences building became the first facility to be LEED-certified in northeast Florida, as well as the first &quot;green&quot; building on campus. As of 2010, five buildings on campus have been certified by the U.S. Green Building Council.

The university has over 200 clubs and organizations for students as well as an active student government and Greek life. The student-run newspaper &quot;The Spinnaker&quot; is published monthly. The university&#x27;s intercollegiate athletics teams are known as the Ospreys, and are members of the ASUN Conference in NCAA Division I.

==History==
The university was founded in 1969 after midway between downtown Jacksonville and the Jacksonville Beaches were set aside for the campus, of which were donated by the Skinner family of Jacksonville. Until this time, the only publicly funded institution of higher learning in the city was Florida Junior College. Construction on classrooms and buildings began in 1971 and UNF opened in the fall of 1972 with an initial enrollment of 2,027 juniors, seniors and graduate students, supported by 117 faculty and more than 150 staff. Originally, like the other Florida state institutions opened around this time, UNF was designated as a &quot;senior&quot; college, meaning it would enroll only upperclassmen and graduate students.

UNF graduated 35 students in 1973. The school was quick to expand and it was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1974. The school&#x27;s mascot, the osprey, was adopted in November 1979 over other choices such as the armadillo, the manatee and the seagull. The male and female versions of the mascot are known as Ozzie and Harriet.

In 1980, there was a legislative effort to merge UNF with the University of Florida but a bill proposing this was vetoed by Governor Bob Graham. Freshmen and sophomores were admitted for the first time in 1984. Enrollment at UNF exceeded 10,000 in 1995, and in the spring of 2000 it broke its commencement record, graduating over 1,000 students.

The 2000s saw significant development on campus as many new buildings including the Social Science building, Science and Engineering building, College of Education and Human Services building, Fine Arts Center, the John A. Delaney Student Union, and Osprey Fountains residence hall were built. In 2002, a 13-member Board of Trustees began work to oversee UNF. Former mayor of Jacksonville John Delaney was appointed President of the university in 2003.

UNF was officially reclassified as an NCAA Division I school for its athletics programs in 2009.

==Campus==

UNF&#x27;s campus is near the intersection of I-295 (East Beltway) and SR-202 (J. Turner Butler Boulevard), two major expressways in the Jacksonville area. UNF has 28 major buildings and six housing facilities on campus. Many of the buildings bear the names of individuals who have made significant contributions to the university. These buildings include the Coggin College of Business, the John E. Mathews, Jr. Computer and Information Sciences Building, and J. J. Daniel Hall. In addition, the library bears the name of the university&#x27;s first president, Thomas G. Carpenter. The Green is a central open grassy area on the campus popular with students.

The Social Sciences building, which opened in the fall of 2006, became the first Northeast Florida facility to be certified by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). Also the first &quot;green&quot; building on campus, it received the 2007 Award of Excellence for University Building by the Southeast Construction Company for Energy and Environmental Design. There is also a state-protected wildlife and bird sanctuary featuring miles of nature trails and numerous lakes and ponds on and around campus.

The size of the campus has grown to . In the fall of 2007, the university began offering a shuttle service between campus locations including the dorms, UNF Hall, the parking lots, Carpenter Library, and the UNF Arena.

A new Biological Sciences building opened in the spring of 2012. A new Student Wellness Center opened in the fall of 2012, replacing the Dottie Dorion Fitness Center. An addition to the College of Education and Human Services was completed in December 2011. A new multi-story dining hall has been completed in the fall of 2012. All four buildings are expected to be LEED-certified.

===Thomas G. Carpenter Library===
The Thomas G. Carpenter Library, or building 12, is named after the university&#x27;s first president, Thomas G. Carpenter. Groundbreaking began on August 8, 1978, and was completed on October 1, 1980.

Construction to expand the library by adding a four-story addition began in May 2004. This addition added and increased the capacity of the library from 800 to 2,000, bringing the size of the library to . Costing $22.5 million, the new addition was opened in December 2005.

The library has 328 public workstations, 18 group study rooms, 37 carrels, 19 faculty, 25 support staff, over 1.4 million microform units, over 800 videos, 13,000 electronic journals, over 52,000 electronic books, and over 840,000 volumes. Electronic resources are available off campus for students, faculty and staff. Free wireless Internet is available throughout the building and enrolled students can check out laptops.

===John A. Delaney Student Union===
The John A. Delaney Student Union, which opened in 2009, contains a two-story bookstore, restaurants, game-room, auditorium, art gallery, ballroom, bank, and amphitheater. It is the home of UNF Student Government, &quot;The Spinnaker&quot;, Spinnaker Television, Spinnaker Radio, the Office of Fraternity &amp; Sorority Life, the LGBT Resource Center, and other student organizations. The Student Union comprises two buildings, with a covered walkway in between known as &quot;Osprey Plaza&quot;. The structure cost $50 million to construct and is a LEED-certified building. It is also one of the first Gold LEED-certified buildings in Jacksonville.

===Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville===

UNF acquired the Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville in 2009 as a cultural resource. The affiliation with the museum allows UNF to improve the facility&#x27;s operations and marketing. Credit-bearing art classes and student art shows are planned. The acquisition is expected to improve the museum and UNF&#x27;s art and design programs, increase UNF&#x27;s downtown presence, and strengthen ties with the city. Coincidentally, UNF&#x27;s Downtown Center which operated from 1978 to 1987 was in the building before it became the art museum.

===UNF Arena===

UNF Arena is a multi-purpose arena on the campus of the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, Florida. It is home to the North Florida Ospreys men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball and women&#x27;s volleyball teams. It is also used for other events, such as concerts and graduation ceremonies, and has served as the site of the Orlando Magic franchise&#x27;s training camp. It opened in 1993 and has a capacity of up to 6,300. On March 8, 2015, the UNF Arena attendance record was set as 6,155 fans watched North Florida defeat USC Upstate in the 2015 Atlantic Sun Men&#x27;s Basketball Tournament championship game. The previous record was set earlier that year as 5,102 fans watched the Ospreys defeat crosstown rival Jacksonville, 77–50 on February 6, 2015.

==Student life==
===Activities===
UNF&#x27;s Student Government is allocated $4.2 million in student fees annually to provide various services to students. The Student Government funds the Osprey Involvement Center (including over 200 clubs), the Lend-a-Wing Food Pantry, Osprey Life and Productions, the John A. Delaney Student Union, the Student Wellness Complex, and intramural sports. It is made up of three branches and an independent office: Legislative, Executive, Judicial, and the Office of Elections. The Executive Branch is managed by the Student Body President who also serves as the student representative on the UNF Board of Trustees. The Legislative Branch is composed of the Senate with 40 elected senators, led by an internally elected cabinet. The Judicial Branch is composed of nine justices, including a Chief Justice, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The Office of Elections is managed by a commissioner appointed by the President and approved by the Senate.

UNF has 32 Greek-lettered organizations. The chapters are advised by university staff. As of Fall 2021, chapters of Kappa Sigma, Lambda Chi Alpha, and Pi Kappa Phi are unrecognized by UNF for conduct issues. Kappa Sigma is ineligible to return, while Lambda Chi Alpha is. Pi Kappa Phi will be eligible to return in fall 2024.

UNF has over 200 clubs and organizations for students. Intercollegiate club sports such as rugby, lacrosse, and ice hockey are available. Students also participate in intramural sports on campus like soccer, ultimate frisbee, and sand volleyball on campus. The UNF Alumni Association organizes the UNF Presidential Envoys, a group of UNF students who serve as ambassadors for the President and the university on campus and in the community.

Osprey Life and Productions is UNF&#x27;s entertainment agency. The free events they put on for students include concerts, comedy shows, movies, games, karaoke, and open mic nights.

The UNF Eco-Adventure Program allows students to use the miles of nature trails and multiple lakes on campus. The lakes are open to canoeing, kayaking, and catch-and-release, non-live-bait fishing. Students can also check out free outdoor equipment from the Eco-Adventure check out center.

===Demographics===
In fall 2020, the University of North Florida had 17,043 students, with 14,662 (86%) being undergraduate students and 2,381 (14%) being graduate students. Among graduate students, 1,841 (77%) are in Master&#x27;s programs and 540 (23%) are in doctoral programs. Women make up 59% of all students. Full-time students make up 71% of the student body. The average student is 24 years old. Students from Florida make up 15,885 (93%) of all students, including 6,410 (38%) from Duval County alone.

===Housing===

The University of North Florida has seven areas of on-campus housing: Osprey Cove, Osprey Crossings, Osprey Hall, Osprey Landing, Osprey Village, Osprey Fountains, and The Flats at UNF. Cove, Crossings, and Landing offer similar, suite/efficiency-like rooms; each of these are designed for triple-occupancy and house two to three residents, with some accommodating individual rooms for disabled students. Hall offers more of a traditional, dorm-like environment with double-occupancy rooms and communal bathrooms and showers. Village and The Flats offer an apartment-like feel with multiple-occupancy accommodations. Cove, Crossings, Hall, and Landing are designated for freshmen (although upperclassmen also live there), while Village, Fountains, and The Flats are upperclassmen residence halls.

Fountains is the only residence hall on campus that provides private individual rooms. The five-story building houses 1,000 students and consists of . The building is divided into two towers, North and South, both of which has two &quot;houses&quot; per floor. It includes a convenience store, grill and common area, kitchens, a recreational facility, laundry rooms, a swimming pool, and a lazy river. Other amenities include The Morgue, a library-like study room; Joe&#x27;s Diner, a 50s style study room with an iPod-compatible jukebox; and The Galaxy, a game room including Xbox 360s, PS3s, Nintendo Wiis, as well as some previous-generation consoles attached to wide-screen high-definition televisions.

Most UNF students reside off campus.

===Dining===
The University of North Florida operates ten dining facilities on campus, plus three convenience stores called &quot;Outtakes.&quot; The &quot;Osprey Cafe&quot; is the main buffet style restaurant on campus, and is popular for students with meal plans. Other on campus choices include Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, Chop&#x27;d and Wrap&#x27;d, and Jamba Juice. The Student Union has a food court with extra options like Einstein Bros. Bagels, Panda Express, and Qdoba. In summer 2018, Papa John&#x27;s was removed as a campus vendor and replaced by an in-house pizza place over controversial comments made by John Schnatter. Overlooking a lake, the Boathouse is an eat-in or take out restaurant that offers wine and beer and often has live entertainment. The restaurant is a UNF tradition that first opened on campus in 1973 and has been rebuilt or renovated multiple times. 
===Media===
&quot;The Spinnaker&quot; is the weekly student-run newspaper. UNF&#x27;s student-run television channel is Spinnaker Television, which shows full-length movies, UNF athletics and events. It is channel 170 on the campus. Spinnaker Radio broadcasts music at WSKR-LP 95.5 FM (100-watt low power FM), online, and on channel 171 on campus. The &quot;UNF Journal&quot; is the official publication for university alumni, and &quot;Inside&quot; is an electronic newsletter published monthly for faculty and staff.

The university is the home of literary journal &quot;Fiction Fix&quot;, which has published nine issues since its inception in 2002. Issues have included works by authors from UNF, across the United States and around the world.

==Athletics==
The University of North Florida&#x27;s intercollegiate teams, known as the North Florida Ospreys, compete at the NCAA Division I level. UNF began intercollegiate sports in 1983 as a member of the NAIA, then later moved the NCAA Division II, and is a member of the ASUN Conference in NCAA Division I.

UNF competes in 17 sports and won the Sunshine State Conference&#x27;s all-sports title four times. In 2005, the Men&#x27;s baseball team competed for the Division II world series, capturing second place overall. In addition the men&#x27;s tennis team also was national Division II runners-up. UNF has captured the Peach Belt Conference Commissioner&#x27;s Cup five consecutive times. The Ospreys have brought home four national titles—men&#x27;s golf in 1991 and 1993, and women&#x27;s tennis in 1986 and 1994. UNF&#x27;s first Division I conference title came in 2008 when the men&#x27;s golf team captured the Atlantic Sun crown. The university plans to add a women&#x27;s golf program in 2013.

In 2015, for the first time in UNF history, the men&#x27;s basketball team received a bid to the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament by winning the Atlantic Sun tournament. The A-Sun championship game was played at UNF Arena in front of a record crowd of 6,155 who watched the Ospreys defeat USC Upstate 63–57. Following the win, the team and university drew unprecedented media attention both locally and nationally.

<doc id="853835" wikidata="Q7752560" url="?curid=853835" title="The Moviegoer">
<text>The Moviegoer is the debut novel by Walker Percy, first published in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf in 1961. It won the U.S. National Book Award. &quot;Time&quot; included the novel in its &quot;Time 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005&quot;. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;The Moviegoer&quot; sixtieth on its list of the hundred best English-language novels of the twentieth century. It is published in the UK by Methuen.

The novel is heavily influenced by the existentialist themes of authors like Søren Kierkegaard, whom Percy read extensively. Unlike many dark didactic existentialist novels (including Percy&#x27;s later work), &quot;The Moviegoer&quot; has a light poetic tone. It was Percy&#x27;s first, most famous, and most widely praised novel, and established him as one of the major voices in Southern literature. The novel also draws on elements of Dante by paralleling the themes of Binx Bolling&#x27;s life to that of the narrator of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;.

In addition to its existentialist character, the novella is also deeply phenomenological.

==Plot summary==
&quot;The Moviegoer&quot; tells the story of Jack &quot;Binx&quot; Bolling, a young stock-broker in postwar New Orleans. The decline of tradition in the Southern United States, the problems of his family and his traumatic experiences in the Korean War have left him alienated from his own life. He day-dreams constantly, has trouble engaging in lasting relationships, and finds more meaning and immediacy in cinema and literature than in his own routine life.

The loose plot of the novel follows the Moviegoer himself, Binx Bolling, in desperate need of spiritual redemption. At Mardi Gras, he breaks out of his caged everyday life and launches himself on a journey, a quest, in a &quot;search&quot; for God. Without any mental compass or sense of direction, he wanders the streets of New Orleans&#x27; French Quarter, and Chicago, and then travels the Gulf Coast, interacting with his surroundings as he goes. He has philosophical moments, reflecting on the people and things he encounters on the road. He is constantly challenged to define himself in relation to friends, family, sweet-hearts, and career despite his urge to remain vague and open to possibility.

==Characters==
*John Bickerson &quot;Binx&quot; Bolling, called Jack by his aunt, but Binx by friends, is one week short of his 30th birthday at the start of the book. His older brother Scott died of pneumonia when Binx was eight. He studied biology at Tulane, and was wounded at the Chongchon River in the Korean War, shot in the shoulder, and knocked out for two days.
*Jack Bolling, Binx&#x27;s father, was a doctor who studied medicine and surgery in Boston, returned to Feliciana Parish to practice medicine under his father. Volunteered for the RCAF in 1940 and was killed in Crete before the US entered World War II.
*Anna Smith (née Bolling, née Castagne), Binx&#x27;s mother, who met Jack when she was assigned to work as his nurse in Feliciana Parish.
*Emily Cutrer (née Bolling), age 65, whom he refers to as his aunt, and main maternal figure, is actually his great aunt.
*Kate Cutrer, age 25, his aunt&#x27;s stepdaughter, and therefore his cousin, currently lives with her father and stepmother. When she was 19, in the fall 1955, she and her fiancé at the time were in a car crash, and he was killed. Getting on a bus the next morning to go home was the happiest moment of her life.
*Sharon Kincaid, Binx&#x27; secretary, a young woman from Eufala, AL.
*Uncle Jules Cutrer, Aunt Emily&#x27;s husband. Was a widower, with his daughter Kate, when Emily married him.
*Walter Wade is Kate&#x27;s fiancée, age 33, and a senior partner in a law firm specializing in oil lease law. Originally from Clarksburg, West Virginia, he attended Tulane, where he was a college fraternity brother of Binx. He and Binx also attended prep school together in New Hampshire.

==Film version==

&quot;Knight of Cups&quot; (2015) appears to be partly inspired by the novel.

During the 1980s, Terrence Malick worked on a screen adaptation, but eventually dropped it. In December 2005, months after the destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina, Malick explained, &quot;I don’t think the New Orleans of the book exists anymore.&quot;

<doc id="853843" wikidata="Q543116" url="?curid=853843" title="Death Comes for the Archbishop">
<text>Death Comes for the Archbishop is a 1927 novel by American author Willa Cather. It concerns the attempts of a Catholic bishop and a priest to establish a diocese in New Mexico Territory.

==Plot summary==
The narrative is based on two historical figures of the late 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Lamy and Joseph Projectus Machebeuf, and rather than any one singular plot, is the stylized re-telling of their lives serving as Roman Catholic clergy in New Mexico. The narrative has frequent digressions, either in terms of stories related to the pair (including the story of the Our Lady of Guadalupe and the execution of an oppressive Spanish priest at Acoma Pueblo) or through their recollections. The narration is in third-person omniscient style. Cather includes many fictionalized accounts of actual historical figures, including Kit Carson, Manuel Antonio Chaves and Pope Gregory XVI.

In the prologue, Bishop Ferrand, an Irish bishop who works in the New World, solicits three cardinals at Rome to pick his candidate for the newly created diocese of New Mexico (which has recently passed into American hands). Bishop Ferrand is successful in getting his candidate, the Auvergnat Jean-Marie Latour, recommended by the cardinals over the recommendation of the Bishop of Durango (under whose territory New Mexico had previously fallen). One of the cardinals, a Spaniard named Allende, alludes to a painting by El Greco taken from his family by a missionary to the New World and lost, and asks for the new Bishop to search for it.

The action then switches to the primary character, Bishop Jean Marie Latour, who travels with his friend and vicar Joseph Vaillant from Sandusky, Ohio to New Mexico. At the time of Latour&#x27;s departure for New Mexico, Cincinnati is the end of the railway line west, so Latour must travel by riverboat to the Gulf of Mexico, and thence overland to New Mexico, a journey which takes an entire year (and includes losing most of his supplies in a shipwreck at Galveston). The names given to the main proponents reflect their characters. Vaillant, &quot;valiant&quot;, is fearless in his promulgation of the faith, whereas Latour, &quot;the tower&quot;, is more intellectual and reserved than his comrade. Vaillant, described as being ugly but purpose-filled, is given the nickname &quot;Blanchet&quot; (&quot;Whitey&quot;) as well as &quot;Trompe-la-morte&quot; (&quot;Death-cheater&quot;) for his complexion and his numerous instances of bad health, respectively. While the narrative speaks of Vaillant positively, it also alludes to his willingness to acquire (he &quot;forces the hand&quot; of a landowner into giving him and Latour two prize mules, Angelica and Contento, chastises the widow Dona Isabella Olivares for refusing to assert her rights under her husband&#x27;s will and thereby blocking the church from its testamentary share, and goes on frank &quot;begging trips&quot; to acquire money) and near the end of the novel his questionable financial behaviour receives an investigation from Rome. Latour, again presented favourably, nevertheless does operate with a view to politics: he successfully canvasses donations to build a Romanesque cathedral in Santa Fe according to his own desires (he chooses the stone and brings the architect Molny from France to complete it), and bides his time to remove dissenting priests and help a poor Mexican slave-woman named Sada until he is in a position of political strength (his help of Sada is never described in the novel). The novel ends with the death of (retired) Archbishop Latour in Santa Fe: Vaillant has pre-deceased Latour as the first Bishop of Colorado after the Colorado gold rush (in reality Machebeuf was the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Denver).

Near the beginning of the novel, Latour and Vaillant are saved from being murdered by the villainous Buck Scales (at whose house they have sought shelter for the night) by Scales&#x27;s abused wife Magdalena. All three escape, and Scales is hanged for the murder of four of his former guests, while Magdalena ultimately serves nuns whom Latour brings from Europe and who run a school in Santa Fe.
While some of the clergy already established in New Mexico are portrayed favourably (such as the Padre of Isleta Pueblo, the blind priest Father Jesus de Baca, who collects parrots), several of the entrenched priests are depicted as examples of greed, avarice, and gluttony. The priest of Albuquerque, Father Gallegos, is removed for not being devout enough (he dances and enjoys fine food and hunting), replaced by Vaillant. Father Martinez at Taos is removed for denying the necessity of priestly celibacy (and having children, although he is also described as starting a revolt and then profiting from the executions of the rebels to seize their property) and his friend Father Lucero at Arroyo Hondo (described as a miser) is also removed when he joins Father Martinez&#x27;s new church (Martinez dies an apostate while Lucero receives absolution from Vaillant after repenting near death).

Cather portrays the aboriginal people of the Pueblos, the Hopi and the Navajo sympathetically, including a discussion of the Long Walk of the Navajo (mentioned as a reminiscence of the dying Latour of his Navajo friend Eusabio and the Navajo leader Manuelito). Latour reflects that the removal of the Navajos was a wrong comparable to &quot;black slavery,&quot; and the narrator describes Kit Carson&#x27;s actions with the Navajo as &quot;misguided&quot; and &quot;a soldier&#x27;s brutal work.&quot;

==Historical background==

The novel is based on the life of Jean-Baptiste Lamy (1814–1888), and partially chronicles the construction of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi. The capture of the Southwest by the United States in the Mexican–American War is the catalyst for the plot.

&quot;The Padre of Isleta&quot;, Anton Docher is identified as the character of Padre de Baca.

Among the entities mentioned in the novel are Los Penitentes, a flagellant lay confraternity in Southern Colorado and New Mexico that still operates today.

==Publication History==
The novel&#x27;s U.S. copyright expired on January 1, 2023, when all works published in 1927 entered the public domain.

==Significance and criticism==

The novel was reprinted in the Modern Library series in 1931. It was included in Life Magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 outstanding books of 1924–1944. It was also included on &quot;Time&quot; 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005 and Modern Library&#x27;s list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century and was chosen by the Western Writers of America to be the 7th-best &quot;Western Novel&quot; of the 20th century.

James Paul Old of Valparaiso University uses &quot;Death Comes for the Archbishop&quot; as a literary example of the notion that religious faith is able to develop and maintain strong social bonds in nascent democratic political orders. He argues that even though Cather&#x27;s early novels, such as &quot;My Ántonia&quot;, typically represent religious characters as closed-minded, her personal religious realignment at the time allowed her to alter her perspective and develop more positive religious characters, in this case Catholic ones. And while some of her contemporary critics found her out of step with the experiences of common people, later critics, such as Old, praised her for a &quot;search for a basis of order and cultural stability beyond the confines of contemporary secular culture.&quot;

Additionally, scholars note that Latour&#x27;s character is not strictly placed within the male-female binary, but instead, as Jennifer A. Smith argues, &quot;oscillates between norms of femininity and masculinity.&quot; In developing a theory that Cather had questioned her own gender in the 1920s, Patrick W. Shaw suggests that &quot;fundamental double entendres&quot; and &quot;elaborate image clusters&quot; throughout the novel support a reading of sexual disregularity and ambiguity.

<doc id="853857" wikidata="Q1195793" url="?curid=853857" title="Of Human Bondage">
<text>Of Human Bondage is a 1915 novel by W. Somerset Maugham. The novel is generally agreed to be Maugham&#x27;s masterpiece and to be strongly autobiographical in nature, although he stated, &quot;This is a novel, not an autobiography; though much in it is autobiographical, more is pure invention.&quot; Maugham, who had originally planned to call his novel &quot;Beauty from Ashes&quot;, finally settled on a title taken from a section of Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot;. The Modern Library ranked &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; No. 66 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

==Plot==
The book begins with the death of Helen Carey, the beloved mother of nine-year-old Philip Carey. Philip has a club foot and his father had died a few months earlier. Now orphaned, he is sent to live with his aunt and uncle, Louisa and William Carey in Blackstable, a town in Kent.

Philip lives at his uncle&#x27;s vicarage. Aunt Louisa tries to be a mother to Philip, but his uncle is cold toward him. Philip&#x27;s uncle has a vast collection of books, and Philip enjoys reading to escape his mundane existence. After less than a year, Philip is sent to a boarding school. His uncle and aunt plan for him to attend Oxford. Philip&#x27;s disability and sensitive nature make it difficult for him to befriend other pupils. Philip learns that he could earn a scholarship for Oxford, which both his uncle and school headmaster view as wise, but Philip insists on going to Germany.

Philip enjoys life in Germany, residing in a boarding house in Heidelberg with other foreigners. Philip&#x27;s guardians persuade him to move to London for an apprenticeship. His colleagues there resent him, believing he is a &quot;gentleman&quot;. He goes on a business trip with one of his managers to Paris and is inspired to study art in France.

In Paris, Philip attends art classes and makes new friends, including Fanny Price, a poor and determined but talentless art student and a loner. Fanny Price falls in love with Philip, but he does not know and has no such feelings for her. She subsequently dies by suicide.

Philip realizes that he will never be a professional artist. He returns to his uncle&#x27;s house in England to study medicine, his late father&#x27;s field. He struggles at medical school and meets Mildred, who works as a waitress in a tea shop. He falls desperately in love with her, and they date regularly, although she does not show him affection. Mildred tells Philip she will marry another man, leaving him heartbroken; Philip subsequently enters into an affair with Norah Nesbit, a kind and sensitive author of penny romance novels. Later Mildred returns, pregnant, and confesses that the man for whom she had abandoned Philip never married her, because he was already married with three children.

Philip breaks off his relationship with Norah and supports Mildred financially, which he can ill afford. To Philip&#x27;s dismay, after Mildred has her baby, she falls in love with Philip&#x27;s good friend Harry Griffiths and runs away with him. About a year later, Philip runs into Mildred and, feeling sympathy, takes her in again. Though he no longer loves her, he becomes attached to her baby. When he rejects her advances she becomes angry, destroys most of his belongings, and leaves forever. In shame, and quickly running out of money, Philip leaves the house for good. He meets Mildred once more, towards the end of the novel, when she summons him for his medical opinion. She is suffering symptoms of syphilis from her work as a prostitute. Philip advises Mildred to give up that life but she declines and exits the plot with her fate unknown.

While working at a hospital, Philip befriends a family man, Thorpe Athelny, who has lived in Toledo, Spain, and is enthusiastically translating the works of St. John of the Cross. Philip invests in mines but is left nearly penniless because of events surrounding the Boer War. Unable to pay his rent, he wanders the streets for several days before the Athelnys take him in and find him a department store job, which he hates. His talent for drawing is discovered and he receives a promotion and a raise in salary, but his time at the store is short-lived.

After his uncle William dies, Philip inherits enough money to allow him to finish his medical studies and he finally becomes a licensed physician. Philip is temporarily placed as locum with Dr. South, a general practitioner in Dorsetshire. Dr. South is an old, cantankerous physician whose wife is dead and whose daughter is estranged. However, Dr. South takes a shine to Philip&#x27;s humour and personable nature, eventually offering Philip a partnership in his medical practice. Although flattered, Philip refuses because he plans to visit Spain.

He goes on a small summer holiday with the Athelnys, hop-picking in the Kent countryside. There he finds that one of Athelny&#x27;s daughters, Sally, likes him. In a moment of romantic abandon one evening they have sex, and when she thinks she is pregnant, Philip decides to marry Sally and accept Dr. South&#x27;s offer, instead of travelling the world as he had planned. They meet in the National Gallery where, though learning that it was a false alarm, Philip becomes engaged to Sally, concluding that &quot;the simplest pattern – that in which a man was born, worked, married, had children, and died – was likewise the most perfect&quot;. He stops the pursuit of happiness and decides to be content with his lot.

==Title==
Maugham&#x27;s initial title was &quot;Beauty from Ashes,&quot; borrowed from Isaiah 61:3, &quot;... to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair&quot;; however, it had already been used. He took the new title from Spinoza. Part IV of his &quot;Ethics&quot; is titled &quot;Of Human Bondage, or the Strength of the Emotions&quot; (). A free person, says Spinoza, is able to think rationally: but when one is dominated by emotion, rational thought is impossible, and one becomes a slave to the (unthinking) passions. He also defines good and bad categories based on the people&#x27;s general beliefs, connecting it to their &quot;emotions of pleasure or pain&quot;. He defines perfectness/imperfectness starting out from the desire, in its meaning of particular aims and plans. Philip Carey, the main character in &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;, was seeking this very useful end, and became satisfied only after realizing what his aim had been, and having found a person to share this aim with.

==Autobiographical features==
Maugham had a stammer (instead of a club foot), lost his parents early in life, and was sent to live with his aunt and uncle. He studied medicine and his tastes in literature coincide with those of the main character in this book. Although Maugham was never an artist, he was interested in painting. He possessed in his private collection works by four painters mentioned in the book: Pissarro, Sisley, Monet, and Renoir. In &quot;The Summing Up&quot;, he discloses that he read Ruskin and became acquainted with many pieces of European art. Maugham wrote an article for &quot;Life&quot; magazine titled &quot;Painting I Have Liked&quot;.

&quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; is perhaps the most vivid instance of Maugham&#x27;s inclination towards art. According to Stanley Archer, 33 artists are named in the novel, 10 famous paintings are mentioned by name and many others are referred to. Over half of the named artists were painters whose careers developed primarily in the 19th century. Of these, 13 are French, five English, and one, Whistler, is American. Eleven were alive at the time in which the plot of the novel is unfolding and five – Carolus-Duran, Degas, Monet, Raffaëlli, and Renoir – were alive when &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; was published in 1915.

<doc id="853869" wikidata="Q3401207" url="?curid=853869" title="A High Wind in Jamaica (novel)">
<text>A High Wind in Jamaica is a 1929 novel by the Welsh writer Richard Hughes, which was made into a film of the same name in 1965. Hughes&#x27;s first novel, it was set in the late nineteenth century and followed a group of seven children captured by pirates on a voyage from Jamaica. A critical success as well as a bestseller on its first publication in Britain, it was awarded the Prix Femina Vie-Heureuse in 1932.

==Plot==
The Bas-Thornton children — John, Emily, Edward, Rachel, and Laura — are raised on a plantation in Jamaica at an unspecified time after the emancipation of slaves in the British Empire (1834). It is a time of technological transformation, and sailing ships and steamers coexist on the high seas. A high wind destroys their home, and the parents decide the children must leave the island and to return to their original home in England. Accompanied by two creole children from Jamaica, Margaret and Harry Fernandez, they leave on the &quot;Clorinda&quot;, a merchant ship under the command of Captain Marpole. Shortly after leaving Jamaica, the &quot;Clorinda&quot; is seized by pirates.

The pirates first pretend they need to seize the ship&#x27;s cargo and will refund the price of the goods taken, but when the lie becomes obvious, they menace Captain Marpole by threatening to shoot the children if he does not disclose where the &quot;Clorinda&quot;&#x27;s safe is kept. The ship is ransacked, and the children are brought aboard the pirate schooner to get dinner. Captain Marpole, thinking that under cover of darkness the children have been murdered, flees the scene, unknowingly abandoning the children to the pirates. Marpole writes a letter to Mr and Mrs Thornton informing them that their children have been murdered by the pirates.

The children quickly become part of life aboard the pirate ship and treat it as their new home. They are treated with some indifference, though a few crew members — little José and Otto the chief mate — care for them and become fond of them, and Captain Jonsen, the pirate captain himself, becomes very fond of Emily.

The pirates stop at their home base of Santa Lucia — in current-day province Pinar del Río, Cuba — to sell the seized goods. Captain Jonsen tries unsuccessfully to convince a rich woman to take care of the children. During the night, José takes John, Edward, and Margaret ashore, and John accidentally falls to his death in a warehouse. He is immediately and deliberately forgotten by his own siblings. The pirate captain seems to be the last one to forget him.

While drunk, Captain Jonsen makes a sexual overture to Emily. She bites his hand before anything happens, but she is frightened by the look in Jonsen&#x27;s eye as he reaches for her. The author gives no explicit details for her fright, just a veiled description from Emily&#x27;s point of view. Emily later suffers an injury to her leg, in an accident caused by Rachel, and is confined to the captain&#x27;s cabin. Meanwhile, Margaret, who has become alienated from the other children, becomes Otto&#x27;s lover and moves into his cabin.

Having made no further captures, the pirates quickly take the first ship they finally see, a Dutch vessel transporting some wild animals. The captain of this ship is tied up and left in the cabin with Emily. Everyone else on the pirate ship boards the Dutch vessel to watch a fight between a lion and a tiger. The Dutch captain does all he can to get Emily to free him but is unable to communicate with her. Finally seeing a knife he rolls towards it. Emily, injured and terrified, screams but no one hears. She pounces at the last second and stabs the captain several times. He soon dies. Margaret, oldest of the children, witnesses this event. When the crew returns to the ship, some of the pirates mistake Margaret for the murderer and without ceremony throw her overboard, but she is rescued by other pirates heading back to the ship.

The crew grows tired and scared of the children. Jonsen arranges for them to transfer to a passing steamer. Disguised as a British merchant vessel, the captain claims that some pirates abandoned the children on the Cuban shore and that he then picked them up to bring them to England. Before sending them on board the steamer, Otto instructs Emily not to disclose the truth about what has happened to them in the past months. He chooses Emily rather than Margaret, as the latter seems to have lost her sanity.

Once aboard the steamer, the children are delighted with the boat&#x27;s luxury and the loving treatment by the passengers, who know of the story of the children told by Captain Marpole. Despite her fondness for Captain Jonsen and the fact that she promised not to tell about what really happened, Emily quickly tells the truth to a stewardess. The pirate ship is pursued and seized by the British authorities.

Back in London, the children are reintegrated into their families. They seem completely unaffected by their traumatic experiences aboard the ship, apart from Margaret who has lost her sanity. (It is hinted that she may also be pregnant.) Emily is only half aware of the crime she has committed. The younger children have distorted and contradictory memories of the facts, and after unsuccessfully attempting to extract any information from them, the family solicitor decides that only Emily should testify at the trial against the pirate crew and then only to repeat a statement written by him. Under the pressure of the courtroom, Emily breaks down and cries out that the Dutch captain died as she watched. She does not exactly say who performed the murder, but at the trial&#x27;s outcome the pirates are convicted of the murder and later are executed.

The book ends with Emily playing with her schoolmates. She is so similar to them that &quot;only God&quot;, but no one else, could tell them apart.

==Development and publication history==
The idea for the novel came in 1925, when a family friend introduced Hughes to an unpublished manuscript by one Jeanette Calder. 
This was a record of her personal experiences in 1822, off the coast of Cuba, as one of a group of children on a brig captured by pirates. Hughes was struck by the fact that the pirates, despite holding the children as hostages in an attempt to extort money from the ship’s captain, treated them with kindness and consideration. To research the historical background, he read as widely as he could on Caribbean piracy in the nineteenth century. He was also able to draw on his mother’s experience of growing up in Jamaica; at this time, Hughes himself had never been there. Finally, having no children himself, he ‘borrowed’ other people’s in order to study child psychology: these included Charlotte Williams-Ellis (daughter of Hughes’ friend and editor, the writer Amabel Williams-Ellis.

Hughes continued to work on the novel over the next three years. In 1928, he offered the first chapter to the editor of the magazine &quot;The Forum&quot;, Henry Goddard Leach. Accepting it for publication, Leach wrote to Hughes, saying that he liked his “high wind in Jamaica”. Hughes was taken by the phrase, and thus “High Wind in Jamaica” became the title of the chapter published in &quot;The Forum&quot; in December 1928.

The complete novel was first published in the U. S. (where Hughes was living at the time) on March 13, 1929, under the title &quot;The Innocent Voyage&quot;. It was while Hughes was on his way back to Britain that the novel was first published there, in a slightly abbreviated form, and now titled &quot;A High Wind in Jamaica&quot;. This was in the magazine &quot;Life and Letters&quot;, where it was introduced by the editor Desmond MacCarthy as “a work of unusual merit and originality”. The book version, published by Chatto and Windus, appeared in September 1929 under the same title, which was then used for most subsequent American editions as well.

==Critical reception==
&quot;A High Wind in Jamaica&quot; was received with enthusiasm on its initial British publication. It was praised by eminent writers and critics such as Arnold Bennett and Hugh Walpole, who wrote that the novel &quot;has genius because it sees something that a million people have seen before, but sees it uniquely.&quot; Hughes&#x27; powers of description came in for particular acclaim. At the same time, however, there was some unease at Hughes&#x27; portrayal of the children and controversy about his understanding of child psychology, with critics such as Humbert Wolfe and J. E. S. Arrowsmith among those unconvinced. An extensive correspondence took place in Time and Tide; the headmistress of a school in Bath objected to the novel as &quot;a disgusting travesty of child life.&quot;

The novel has since been described as &quot;one of the classic novels of childhood and a completely original work.&quot; It is often given credit for influencing and paving the way for novels such as &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; by William Golding. In 1998, &quot;A High Wind in Jamaica&quot; was included as number 71 in the Modern Library&#x27;s 100 Best Novels, a list of the best English-language novels of the 20th century.

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted for the stage as &quot;The Innocent Voyage&quot; in 1943, as a play in three acts by Paul Osborn. 

The novel was filmed in 1965 as &quot;A High Wind in Jamaica&quot;, directed by Alexander Mackendrick and starring Anthony Quinn as Chavez. The cast also included a young Martin Amis, who described the original novel as &quot;a thrillingly good book” in his autobiography.

&quot;A High Wind in Jamaica&quot; has also been adapted several times for radio:

<text>The Natalia Republic was a short-lived Boer republic founded in 1839 after a Voortrekker victory against the Zulus at the Battle of Blood River. The area was previously named &quot;Natália&quot; by Portuguese sailors, due to its discovery on Christmas (&quot;Natal&quot; is the Portuguese word for Christmas). The republic came to an end in 1843 when British forces annexed it to form the Colony of Natal. After the British annexation of the Natalia Republic, most local Voortrekkers trekked northwest into Transorangia, later known as the Orange Free State, and the South African Republic.

==History==
===European settlement and setbacks===
On Christmas Day 1497 Vasco da Gama was sailing past the region now known as Transkei and named the country Terra Natalis. He next sighted the bluff at the entrance to what is now the harbour of Durban. Da Gama made no landing here, but in later years the name Natália became associated with it. Like the rest of South Africa, Natal was neglected by the Portuguese, whose nearest settlement was at Delagoa Bay.
It is not proven when the clan settled in the region which was inhabited by Nguni people. A small clan living north of the Tugela River, the amaZulu, was greatly enlarged by its leader Shaka, and between 1818 and 1820 his Zulu Kingdom&#x27;s military campaigns overran the area. British traders established a small settlement at Port Natal, so founding what became the town of Durban, established in 1835.

The next Europeans to settle in the country were emigrant Boers from the Cape Colony, who came by land over the passes of the Drakensberg. These Voortrekkers were led by Piet Retief. Passing through the almost deserted upper regions, Retief arrived at Port Natal in October 1837. During this journey, he chose a site for the capital of the future state that he envisioned. He went to the kraal of Shaka’s successor Dingane, ruler of the Zulu Kingdom, to obtain a cession of territory for the Boer farmers. Dingane consented on condition that the Boers recover cattle stolen by another chief. Retief managed that and, with the help of missionary the Rev Francis Owen, living at Dingane’s kraal, he drew up a deed of cession in English. Dingane and Retief signed it on 4 February 1838.

Two days later, Dingane ordered the execution of Retief and all of his party, 66 whites and 34 Khoikhoi servants. The Zulu king commanded his impis to kill all the Boers who had entered Natal. The Zulu forces crossed the Tugela River the same day, and the most advanced parties of the Boers were massacred, many at a spot near where the town of Weenen now stands, its name (meaning wailing or weeping) commemorating the event. Other of the farmers hastily laagered and were able to repulse the Zulu attacks; the assailants suffered serious loss at a fight near Bushman River. In one week after the murder of Retief, the Zulus had killed 600 Boers.

Hearing of the attack on the Boers, the British settlers at the bay sent a force to help them. Robert Biggar commanded 20 British and a following of 700 friendly Zulus and crossed the Tugela River near its mouth. On 17 April, in a desperate fight with a Zulu force, the British were overwhelmed and only four Europeans escaped to the bay. Pursued by the Zulus, the surviving inhabitants of Durban took refuge on a ship then in harbour. After the Zulus retired, fewer than a dozen Englishmen returned to live at the port; the missionaries, hunters, and other traders returned to Cape Colony.

The Boers had repelled the Zulu attacks on their laagers; joined by others from the Drakensberg, about 400 men under Hendrik Potgieter and Piet Uys advanced to attack Dingane. On 11 April, they fell into a trap and with difficulty cut their way out. Among those slain were Piet Uys and his son Dirk, aged 15.

===Battle of Blood River===
Toward the end of the year, the Boers received reinforcements. In December 460 men set out under Boer general Andries Pretorius to take on the Zulus. Andries Pretorius selected Jan Gerritze Bantjes (1817-1887) as his scribe and secretary in recording events of the campaign and coming retaliation battle with the Zulus. Bantjes documented daily in his journal the progress of the commando, from their start on 27 November 1838 until they reached their selected battle site on 15 December 1838. They avoided being led into a trap as happened on the previous attempt to attack the Zulus in April which ended in disaster. On the journey, they had small skirmishes with various kraals but the main Zulu army had not arrived yet to attack. Boer and Zulu scouts were constantly monitoring each other&#x27;s whereabouts. On 9 December 1838 as Bantjes wrote in his journal, the Boers congregated under a clear sky to sing appropriate psalms and celebrate the Sabbath, taking a vow which became known as the &quot;Day of The Vow or Covenant&quot; that &quot;if the Lord might give us victory, we hereby deem to found a house as a memorial of his Great Name at a place where it shall please Him&quot;, and that they also implore the help and assistance of God in accomplishing this Vow and that they write down this Day of Victory in a book and disclose this event to our very last posterities in order that this will forever be celebrated in the honour of God.&quot;

On 16 December 1838, while laagered near the Umslatos River or Hippo Pool, they were attacked by more than 10,000 Zulus. As Bantjes wrote in his journal:
The Boers fought off the Zulu. After three hours, the Boers had killed thousands of Zulus and had fewer than a dozen of their men wounded. The Zulus withdrew in defeat, many crossing the river which had turned red with blood and thereafter known as the Battle of Blood River. Modern-day Boers still celebrate the Day of the Vow every year on 16 December.

===British at Port Natal ===
Returning south, Pretorius and his fighters found that the British had annexed Port Natal (now Durban) on 4 December with a detachment of the 72nd Highlanders from Cape Colony. While the governor of the Cape, Major-General Sir George Napier, had invited the British emigrants from Natal to return to the colony, and stated his intention to take military possession of the port. In sanctioning the occupation of the port the British government of the day had no intention of making Natal a British colony, but wished to prevent the Boers establishing an independent republic upon the coast with a harbour through which access to the interior could be gained. After remaining at the port just over a year the Highlanders were withdrawn, on 24 December 1839.

===Overthrow of Dingane===
After the battle, Pretorius took advantage of dissension in the Zulu kingdom to ally himself with Mpande, brother of the Zulu king Dingane. Dingane&#x27;s attempt to extend his kingdom north to compensate for losses to the Boers had failed. He was defeated by the Swazi people in 1839, leading to discontent with his rule. In exchange for cattle and territory Pretorius agreed to support Mpande&#x27;s bid to overthrow Dingane. A Boer force supported Mpande&#x27;s Zulu impi in the invasion. At the Battle of Maqongqo, Dingane was crushed and was put to flight with what retainers chose to follow him into exile. Pretorius took 36,000 head of cattle and proclaimed a large tract of land extending from St Lucia Bay to be part of the Natalia Republic.

==Government of Natalia==
===Internal affairs===
Meantime the Boers had founded Pietermaritzburg, named in honour of leaders Piet Retief and Gerrit Maritz. They made it their capital and the seat of their Volksraad.

Legislative power was vested in the volksraad (consisting of 24 members), while the president and executive were changed every three months. For issues of importance, a meeting was called of &quot;het publiek&quot;, that is, of all who chose to attend, to sanction or reject it. &quot;The result,&quot; says the historian George McCall Theal, &quot;was utter anarchy. Decisions of one day were frequently reversed the next, and every one held himself free to disobey any law that he did not approve of. ... Public opinion of the hour in each section of the community was the only force in the land.&quot;

===Territorial policy===
The Zulus continued to exist as a distinct and numerous people with their own dispensation within their own territory to the north and east, in the region known as Zululand.

The settlers were in loose alliance with and in quasi-supremacy over the Boer communities that had left the Cape and settled at Winburg and at Potchefstroom. They declared a free and independent state under the title of &quot;The Republic of Port Natal and adjacent countries,&quot; and sought (September 1840) from Sir George Napier an acknowledgment of their independence by Great Britain.

Sir George did not give an answer but was friendly to the Boer farmers. He was disturbed when a commando force under Andries Pretorius attacked the Xhosa in December 1840. The national government declined to recognize Natalia&#x27;s independence but proposed to trade with it if the people would accept a military force to defend against other European powers. Sir George communicated this decision to the volksraad in September 1841.

===British and Dutch influences===
The Boers strongly resented the contention of the British that they could not shake off British nationality, though beyond the bounds of any recognized British possession. They also wanted control of the British Natal Port (now renamed Durban). They rejected Napier&#x27;s overtures.

On 2 December 1841, Napier announced his intention to resume military occupation of Port Natal, citing the Boers&#x27; attack on the Xhosa. On 21 February 1842 the settlers responded, with a document written by Jacobus Boshoff. The farmers complained about the lack of representative government, and concluded by a protest against the occupation of any part of their territory by British troops.

Soon after, an event occurred which encouraged the Boers in their opposition to Great Britain. In March 1842 a Dutch vessel sent out by Gregorius Ohrig, an Amsterdam merchant who sympathized with the farmers, reached Port Natal. Johan Arnold Smellekamp concluded a treaty with the volksraad assuring them of the protection of the Netherlands. The Natal Boers believed the Netherlands to be one of the great powers of Europe, and were firmly persuaded that its government would aid them in resisting Great Britain.

==Transfer to colonial government==
===Battle of Congella===

On 1 April 1842 Captain T. C. Smith with a force of 263 men left his camp at the Umgazi, on the eastern frontier of Cape Colony, and marching overland reached Durban without opposition, and encamped, on 4 May, at the base of the Berea hills. The Boers, cut off from their port, called out a commando of some 300 to 400 men under Andries Pretorius and gathered at Congella at the head of the bay. On the night of 23 May, Smith made an unsuccessful attack on the Boer camp, losing his guns and fifty men were killed or wounded. On 26 May the Boers captured the harbour and settlement, and on 31 May blockaded the British camp, the women and children being removed, on the suggestion of Pretorius, to a ship in the harbour of which the Boers had taken possession. Meantime, an old Durban resident, Dick King, had undertaken to convey tidings of the perilous position of the British force to the commandant at Grahamstown. He started on the night of 24 May, and escaping the Boer outposts rode through the dense bush, and in nine days reached his destination—a distance of in a direct line, and nearly by the route to be followed. This remarkable ride was accomplished with one change of mount, obtained from a missionary in Pondoland. A comparatively strong force under Colonel A. J. Cloete was at once sent by sea to Port Natal, and on 26 June, Captain Smith was relieved. The besieged had suffered greatly from lack of food. Within a fortnight Colonel Cloete received the submission of the volksraad at Pietermaritzburg. The burghers represented that they were under the protection of the Netherlands, but this plea was peremptorily rejected by the commander of the British forces.

The British government was still undecided as to its policy towards Natal. In April 1842 Lord Stanley, then Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in the second Peel Administration, wrote to Sir George Napier that the establishment of a colony in Natal would be attended with little prospect of advantage, but at the same time stated that the pretensions of the emigrants to be regarded as an independent community could not be admitted. Various measures were proposed which would but have aggravated the situation.

===Annexation===
Finally, in deference to the strongly urged views of Sir George Napier, Lord Stanley, in a despatch of 13 December, received in Cape Town on 23 April 1843, consented to Natal becoming a British colony. The institutions adopted were to be as far as possible in accordance with the wishes of the people, but it was a fundamental condition &quot;that there should not be in the eye of the law any distinction or disqualification whatever, founded on mere difference of colour, origin, language or creed.&quot;

Sir George then appointed Mr Henry Cloete (a brother of Colonel Josias Cloete) a special commissioner to explain to the Natal volksraad the decision of the government. There was a considerable party of Natal Boers still strongly opposed to the British, and they were reinforced by numerous bands of Boers who came over the Drakensberg from Winburg and Potchefstroom. Commandant Jan Mocke of Winburg (who had helped to besiege Captain Smith at Durban) and others of the &quot;war party&quot; attempted to induce the volksraad not to submit, and a plan was formed to murder Pretorius, Boshoff and other leaders, who were now convinced that the only chance of ending the state of complete anarchy into which the country had fallen was by accepting British sovereignty.

===Extent of the colony===
On 8 August 1843 the Natal unanimously agreed to the terms proposed by Lord Stanley, setting Drakensberg as the northern limit of Natal. Many of the Boers who would not acknowledge British rule trekked once more over the mountains into what became the Orange Free State and Transvaal provinces to seek their freedom and independence. At the end of 1843 there were not more than 500 Dutch families left in Natal.

Cloete, before returning to the Cape, visited Mpande and obtained from him a valuable concession. Hitherto the Tugela River from source to mouth had been the recognized frontier between Natal and Zululand. Mpande gave up to Natal all the territory between the Buffalo and Tugela rivers, which later formed Klip River county.

==Aftermath==
Proclaimed a British Colony of Natal in 1843, it became a part of Cape Colony in 1844, not being separated again until 1856. The power of the volksraad did not truly end until 1845, when an effective British administration was established under Martin West as lieutenant-governor. After the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, the British defeated the Zulu army, and annexed Zululand to Natal in 1897. One of the four founding provinces of South Africa, it is now KwaZulu-Natal. This province is still home to the Zulu nation; native speakers of the Zulu language form 77.8% of the population. The province also has a large ethnic Indian population, as well as Boer-descended residents and ethnic British descendants.

<doc id="853874" wikidata="Q4657437" url="?curid=853874" title="A House for Mr Biswas">
<text>A House for Mr Biswas is a 1961 novel by V. S. Naipaul, significant as Naipaul&#x27;s first work to achieve acclaim worldwide. It is the story of Mohun Biswas, a Hindu Indo-Trinidadian who continually strives for success and mostly fails, who marries into the influential Tulsi family only to find himself dominated by it, and who finally sets the goal of owning his own house. It relies on some biographical elements from the experience of the author&#x27;s father.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;A House for Mr Biswas&quot; number 72 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the novel in its list of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005. In 2022, it was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

== Synopsis ==

===Plot===
Mohun Biswas (based on V. S. Naipaul&#x27;s father, Seepersad Naipaul) is born in rural Trinidad and Tobago to Hindu Indian parents and his father is a Brahmin. His birth was considered inauspicious as he is born &quot;in the wrong way&quot; and with an extra finger. A pundit prophesies that the newborn child &quot;will be a lecher and a spendthrift. Possibly a liar as well&quot;, and that he will &quot;eat up his mother and father&quot;. The pundit advises that the boy be kept &quot;away from trees and water. Particularly water&quot;. A few years later, Mohun leads a neighbour&#x27;s calf, which he is tending, to a stream. The boy, who has never seen water &quot;in its natural form&quot;, becomes distracted and allows the calf to wander off. Mohun then hides in fear of punishment. His father, believing his son to be in the water, drowns in an attempt to save him, thus in part fulfilling the pundit&#x27;s prophecy. The family breaks up as a result of this. Mohun&#x27;s sister is transferred to live with Tara and Ajodha, a well-off aunt and uncle. Mohun moves in with other family members along with his mother and two elder brothers.

The boy is withdrawn prematurely from school and apprenticed to a pundit, but is cast out on bad terms. Ajodha then puts him in the care of his alcoholic and abusive brother Bhandat, an arrangement which also ends badly. Finally, the young Mr Biswas decides to make his own fortune. He encounters a friend from his school days who helps him get into the business of sign-writing. While on the job, Mr Biswas attempts to romance a client&#x27;s daughter but his advances are misinterpreted as a wedding proposal. He is drawn into a marriage which he does not have the nerve to stop and becomes a member of the Tulsi household.

Mr Biswas becomes very unhappy with his wife Shama (based on Droapatie Naipaul) and her overbearing family. The Tulsis (based on the Capildeo family), and the big decaying Hanuman House (based on Anand Bhavan aka the Lion House) where they live represent the communal way of life which is traditional throughout Asia. Mr Biswas is offered a place in this cosmos, a subordinate place to be sure, but a place that is guaranteed and from which advancement is possible. But Mr Biswas wants more than being just a gharjamai. He is, by instinct, a modern man. He wants to be the author of his own life. That is an aspiration with which the Tulsis cannot deal, and their decaying world conspires to drag him down. Despite his poor education, Mr Biswas becomes a journalist, has four children with Shama, and attempts several times to build a house that he can call his own, a house which will symbolise his independence. Mr Biswas&#x27; desperate struggle to acquire a house of his own can be linked to an individual&#x27;s need to develop an authentic identity. He feels that only by having his own house he can overcome his feelings of rootlessness and alienation.

=== Characters ===

* Mohun Biswas (based on V. S. Naipaul&#x27;s father, Seepersad Naipaul)
* Shama (based on Droapatie Naipaul), Mohun&#x27;s wife
* Raghu, Mohun&#x27;s father
* Tara, Mohun&#x27;s mother&#x27;s sister
* Bhandat, Tara&#x27;s brother-in-law
* Pundit Jayaram, Mohun&#x27;s cruel employer, with whom he worked as an assistant
* Mrs. Tulsi, Shama&#x27;s mother
* Anand, Mohun&#x27;s son (based on V. S. Naipaul). Anand excels in school and shows signs of talent as a writer.

== Development and publication ==
Naipaul wrote the book based on his own experiences as a child. Writing for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; in 1983, he stated that, &quot;Of all my books &quot;A House for Mr. Biswas&quot; is the one closest to me.&quot; The book took him three years to write.

Naipaul finished the final proofreading of the book in May 1961. The book was first published in London by André Deutsch in 1961. McGraw Hill published the first US edition of the book in New York in the same year.

== Style and themes ==
A central theme of the novel is alienation. Right from his birth, Mr Biswas is alienated due to the prophecy. He grew up as a lonely child who lived in isolation. Following his marriage to Shama, the joint family of the Tulsis expected him to merge his personal identity with theirs, which he finds difficult and makes him feel trapped. They later humiliate him and he is forced to work at the estate at Green Vale, where he grows resentful of even his own children. Ultimately, this sense of alienation motivates him to search for a house, symbolising an effort to find and create his own identity.

Throughout the novel, Mr Biswas&#x27; gradual progress is indicated through the many objects he and his wife acquire over the years. Naipaul lists out detailed inventories, much like &quot;the catalogue of ships in the &quot;Iliad&quot; or the many descriptions of rooms by Dickens&quot;.

==Legacy==

The novel is generally regarded as Naipaul&#x27;s most significant work and is credited with launching him into international fame and renown.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine included the novel in its &quot;All-Time 100 Novels&quot;. On 5 November 2019, BBC News listed &quot;A House for Mr Biswas&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

==Adaptations==
The novel was later adapted as a stage musical (unproduced), with compositions by Monty Norman. One of the songs written for the play, &quot;Good Sign, Bad Sign&quot;, was later rewritten as the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;, according to the documentary &quot;Inside Dr. No&quot;.

In 1980, the book was serialised by the BBC in England as part of &quot;A Book at Bedtime&quot; and broadcast on the BBC World Service in 1981.

A two-part radio dramatisation, featuring Rudolph Walker, Nitin Ganatra, Nina Wadia and Angela Wynter, ran on BBC Radio Four on 26 March and 2 April 2006.

<doc id="853875" wikidata="Q1166588" url="?curid=853875" title="Darrell Griffith">
<text>Darrell Steven Griffith (born June 16, 1958), also known by his nickname Dr. Dunkenstein, is an American former professional basketball player who spent his entire career with the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1980 to 1991. He played collegiately at the University of Louisville.

==Early life and college==
Griffith starred at Louisville Male High School and was heavily recruited by colleges all across the country. Male defeated Lexington Henry Clay 74–59 in the 1975 Kentucky State Championship game. In fact, Griffith reportedly turned down an offer to forego college and sign with the ABA&#x27;s Kentucky Colonels. He decided to attend his hometown school, the University of Louisville, much to the delight of local fans.

He did not disappoint, delivering the school&#x27;s first-ever NCAA men&#x27;s basketball championship in 1980. He scored 23 points in the Cardinals&#x27; 59–54 victory over UCLA in the championship game. Due to his strong performance, he was named Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. Griffith totaled 825 points in his senior season, setting a school record. For his efforts, he was named First Team All-American by the Associated Press and was given the Wooden Award as the best college basketball player in the nation. He left college as Louisville&#x27;s all-time leading scorer with 2,333 points in his career. His jersey number, 35, was retired during ceremonies after the 1980 season.

In November 2014, Griffith was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
Utah selected Griffith with the second overall pick in the 1980 NBA draft. The Jazz had recently moved to Salt Lake City from New Orleans, and the team needed a star to replace legendary shooting guard Pete Maravich. Griffith accepted the challenge, averaging 20.6 points per game in his first season and earning the NBA&#x27;s Rookie of the Year award.

For the next four seasons, Griffith teamed with small forward Adrian Dantley to form one of the highest-scoring duos in the league. With defensive support from center Mark Eaton and point guard Rickey Green, the Jazz improved dramatically, winning the Midwest Division title in 1983–84 and qualifying for the NBA playoffs for the first time ever. Individually, Griffith transformed his offensive game, adding long-distance shooting skills to his aerial acrobatics. He led the league in three-point shooting (36.1 percent) and set an NBA record for most three-pointers made in a single season (91). His new abilities earned him a new nickname: Utah&#x27;s play-by-play announcer Hot Rod Hundley began calling him &quot;The Golden Griff&quot;.

The following season (1984–85) was the best of Griffith&#x27;s career. He averaged a career-high 22.6 points per game, and broke his own league record by sinking 92 three-point shots. During the year, he passed Joey Hassett as the all-time NBA leader for most career three-pointers. He also continued his high-flying ways, representing the Jazz in the 1984 and 1985 NBA Slam Dunk Contests.

However, the team changed dramatically in the mid-1980s with the emergence of Karl Malone and John Stockton as Utah&#x27;s top offensive weapons. Dantley was traded away and Griffith suffered from injuries. (&quot;Dr. Dunkenstein was paying his toll&quot;, he once said in an interview.) He missed the entire 1985–86 season due to a stress fracture in his foot, and would lose his starting position when he returned. Griffith would need an operation on his left knee in March 1988, causing him to miss the remainder of that season. He managed to reclaim his starting spot for most of the 1988–89 season, but lost it permanently the following year. His playing time gradually decreased until his retirement in 1991. He scored 12,391 total points over the course of his 10-year professional career – all with the Jazz. The franchise recognized his contributions by retiring his jersey number 35 on December 4, 1993.

==Post-basketball career==

In the 2010s and 20s, Griffith returned to his alma mater as a special assistant to President James R. Ramsey and later as a university ambassador under President Neeli Bendapudi.

<text>A Bend in the River is a 1979 novel by Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul.

The novel, telling the story of Salim, a merchant in post-colonial mid-20th century Africa, is one of Naipaul&#x27;s best known works and was widely praised. It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1979. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;A Bend in the River&quot; #83 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. &quot;A Bend in the River&quot; has also been criticized for a perceived defence of European colonialism in Africa.

==Plot==

Set in an unnamed African country after independence, the book is narrated by Salim, an ethnically Indian Muslim and a shopkeeper in a small but growing city in the country&#x27;s remote interior. Salim observes the rapid changes in Africa with an outsider&#x27;s distance.

Salim grows up in the community of Indian traders on the east coast of Africa. Feeling insecure about his future in East Africa, he buys a business from Nazruddin in a town at &quot;a bend in the river&quot; in the heart of Africa. When he moves there he finds the town decrepit, a &quot;ghost town&quot;, its former European suburb reclaimed by the bush, and many of its European vestiges ruined in a &quot;rage&quot; by the locals in response to their suppression and humiliation during colonial times. Old tribal distinctions have become important again. Salim trades in what people in the villages need: pencils and paper, pots and pans, other household utensils. Soon he is joined by an assistant, Metty, who comes from a family of house slaves that his family had maintained in the east. One of his steady customers is Zabeth, a &quot;marchande&quot; from a village and a magician too. Zabeth has a son, Ferdinand, by a man of another tribe, and asks Salim to help him get educated. Ferdinand attends the local lycée run by Father Huismans, a Belgian priest who collects African masks and is considered a &quot;lover of Africa&quot;. Life in the town is slowly improving. Salim&#x27;s decision to move there seems to be vindicated when he learns that the Indian community on the east coast is being persecuted, but he still does not feel secure. Mahesh, a fellow Indian trader, says that the local Africans are &quot;malins&quot; (i.e. wicked), &quot;because they lived with the knowledge of men as prey&quot;. A rebellion breaks out and the Indian merchants live in fear. Soon white mercenaries appear and restore order. After peace has returned Father Huismans goes on a trip. He is killed by unknown assailants and nobody cares. Afterwards his collection of African masks is denounced as an affront to African religion. An American visitor pillages most of the masks and ships them home as &quot;the richest products of the forest&quot;.

The town now develops into a trading centre for the region. Government agencies spring up. European salesmen and visitors arrive. Salim&#x27;s friends Mahesh and Shoba become successful with their new Bigburger franchise. The new army arrives, &quot;poachers of ivory and thieves of gold&quot;. Portraits of the President, &quot;the Big Man&quot;, are displayed everywhere. A new section of town is built, the &quot;State Domain&quot;, to showcase the President&#x27;s vision of a new Africa. Yet buildings are shoddy, the tractors at the agricultural centre never get put to work, and much of the Domain falls quickly into disrepair. Salim calls it a &quot;hoax&quot;. The Domain is soon converted into a university and conference centre.

Salim is visited by Indar, who grew up with him on the east coast, then went to England to study and now has become a lecturer at the new institution. He takes Salim to a party in the Domain to meet Yvette and Raymond, an expatriate European couple. Raymond had been the advisor and mentor of the President. Although charismatic and admired, he finds himself outside the centre of power, his influence with the President seemingly in eclipse. Loyal to the President, he continues to write for him, hoping to be recalled to the capital.

Salim, whose experience with women has been limited to prostitutes, is intrigued by Yvette, Raymond&#x27;s much younger wife. Salim and Yvette start an adulterous affair right under Raymond&#x27;s eyes. But the affair ends abruptly when Salim, seized by sudden jealousy, beats her badly and sends her away.

Raymond&#x27;s attempt to please the Big Man by editing a collection of his speeches is not successful. Instead the President publishes &quot;a very small, brief book of thoughts, &quot;Maximes&quot;, two or three thoughts to each page, each thought about four or five lines long&quot;. Like others, Salim is forced to buy copies of the book for distribution. The local youth group displeases the President and is denounced in one of his propaganda speeches. As a result, unrest grows, corruption and extortion become more prevalent, and a &quot;Liberation Army&quot; forms underground. They reject the President, his cult of the black Madonna (modeled on the President&#x27;s mother), and his vision of Africa, calling to return to the &quot;truthful laws&quot; of the ancestors.

Salim looks for a way out. He travels to London, where he meets Nazruddin. Nazruddin sold his business to Salim, moved to Uganda, left it because of persecution, moved then to Canada, left it because of its capitalistic rapaciousness, and finally landed in London, where he became a landlord. He bemoans the lack of security for honest businessmen: there is no safe place. Salim becomes engaged to Nazruddin&#x27;s daughter, but soon returns to his place in Africa. Upon arrival he learns that his business has been expropriated under the President&#x27;s new programme of &quot;radicalization&quot; and transferred to a local. Théotime, a &quot;state trustee&quot;, is ignorant and lazy, and retains Salim as manager and chauffeur. Salim recognises that all is lost. He has hidden some ivory on his property, but, betrayed by Metty, is found out and put in jail. He is presented to the commissioner, Ferdinand, who has moved up in the administration after receiving training in the capital. Ferdinand tells him that there is no safety, no hope, and that everybody is in fear of his life: &quot;We’re all going to hell, and every man knows this in his bones. We’re being killed. Nothing has any meaning.&quot; He sets Salim free and tells him to leave the country. Salim takes the last steamer before the President arrives. During the night there is a battle on the ship, as rebels try to hijack it. The attack is repelled, but the attached barge, full of Africans, is snapped loose and drifts down the river.

==Latin mottos==
 This Latin phrase is still visible to Salim on the granite base of a ruined European monument near the dock. Later Father Huismans explains him its meaning. &quot;He approves of the mingling of the peoples and their bonds of union&quot;, derived from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Book IV, line 112. Aeneas lands on the shores of Africa, falls in love with Queen Dido and wants to settle, putting his mission, the migration to Italy, in danger. The gods intervene: they do not approve of a settlement in Africa nor of the mingling of the peoples. In the motto, however, three words were altered to reverse the original meaning.

A second Latin phrase is encountered by Salim: &quot;&quot;, the motto of the lycée. The original phrase by Pliny the Elder meant that there is always something new out of Africa (&quot;ex Africa&quot;). Huismans applied it jokingly to the unique masks and carvings with religious quality he had collected.

==Comments==
Naipaul is recognised as a &quot;magnificent novelist&quot;, and &quot;A Bend in the River&quot; has been described as a &quot;full-bodied masterpiece&quot;. Yet he has been accused of being a &quot;neo-colonialist&quot;, and in this novel post-colonial Africa is depicted as spiralling into a kind of Hell. He has also been accused of being &quot;infected by an ancestral communal resentment&quot; against blacks. Jennifer Seymour Whitaker indicates that Salim&#x27;s plight as an outsider, a member of the Indian community in Africa, is credibly rendered, but takes Naipaul to task for ascribing to African people a &quot;mysterious malevolence&quot;.

Irving Howe admires Naipaul&#x27;s &quot;almost Conradian gift for tensing a story&quot;, the psychic and moral tension of the novel, and its &quot;serious involvement with human issues&quot;. Howe rejects the notion that Naipaul is an apologist of colonialism. He contrasts the foreground space occupied by Salim with the background acts set in motion by the Big Man. The Big Man never appears but finds a voice in Raymond, the white intellectual whom the President promotes but later ignores. Howe bemoans the fact that, as he sees it, Naipaul allows &quot;the wretchedness of his depicted scene&quot; to become &quot;the limit of his vision&quot;.

Selwyn Cudjoe thinks that the novel depicts &quot;the gradual darkening of African society as it returns to its age-old condition of bush and blood&quot; and thinks this pessimistic view indicates Naipaul&#x27;s &quot;inability to examine postcolonial societies in any depth&quot;. The novel examines &quot;the homeless condition of the East Indian in a world he cannot call home&quot; and shows in Salim&#x27;s case his passage to free himself from &quot;the constricting ties to his society&#x27;s past&quot;.

Imraan Coovadia examines Naipaul&#x27;s Latin quotations, accuses him of misquotation and manipulation, and suggests that he tries to evoke fear, disgust and condescension. Massod Raja suggests that the novel takes an essentially bourgeois perspective, Salim being interested, not in revolutionary goals, but in maintaining a profitable enterprise. He asserts that Naipaul is not a postcolonial author but a &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; one (as defined by Timothy Brennan), who offers an &quot;inside view of formerly submerged peoples&quot; for target audiences that have &quot;metropolitan literary tastes&quot;.

In 2001, without specifically referring to this novel, the Nobel Literature Prize Committee indicated that it viewed Naipaul as Conrad&#x27;s heir as the annalist of the destinies of empires in the moral sense: what they do to human beings. In &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, Joseph Conrad presented a dark picture of the same region at the beginning of European colonization; this type of depiction of Africa is also found recast in Naipaul&#x27;s novel.

Like Conrad, who in &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; does not name the big river, Naipaul does not name the river in this novel, nor the town at its bend, nor the country or its president. Yet there are possible identifiers. Thus the reader learns that the town is located in the heart of Africa, at the end of the navigable river, just below the cataracts, and the European colonisers had been French-speaking, perhaps Belgians. Naipaul&#x27;s description has been interpreted to point to the town of Kisangani on the Congo River. A link between the &quot;Big Man&quot; and President Mobutu of Zaire was drawn by some reviewers. 
Naipaul credits his extramarital affair with Margaret Gooding for giving &quot;A Bend in the River&quot; and his later books greater fluidity, saying that these &quot;in a way to some extent depend on her. They stopped being dry.”

<doc id="853879" wikidata="Q371260" url="?curid=853879" title="Elias Hicks">
<text>Elias Hicks (March 19, 1748 – February 27, 1830) was a traveling Quaker minister from Long Island, New York. In his ministry he promoted doctrines deemed unorthodox by many which led to lasting controversy, and caused the second major schism within the Religious Society of Friends (the first caused by George Keith in 1691). Elias Hicks was the older cousin of the painter Edward Hicks.

==Early life==
Elias Hicks was born in Hempstead, New York, in 1748, the son of John Hicks (1711–1789) and Martha Hicks (née Smith; 1709–1759), who were farmers. He was a carpenter by trade and in his early twenties he became a Quaker like his father.

On January 2, 1771, Hicks married a fellow Quaker, Jemima Seaman, at the Westbury Meeting House and they had eleven children, only five of whom reached adulthood. Hicks eventually became a farmer, settling on his wife&#x27;s parents&#x27; farm in Jericho, New York, in what is now known as the Elias Hicks House. There he and his wife provided, as did other Jericho Quakers, free board and lodging to any traveler on the Jericho Turnpike rather than have them seek accommodation in taverns for the night.

In 1778, Hicks helped to build the Friends meeting house in Jericho, which remains a place of Quaker worship. Hicks preached actively in Quaker meeting, and by 1778 he was acknowledged as a recorded minister. Hicks was regarded as a gifted speaker with a strong voice and dramatic flair. He drew large crowds when he was said to be attending meetings, sometimes in the thousands. In November 1829, the young Walt Whitman heard Hicks preach at Morrison&#x27;s Hotel in Brooklyn, and later said, &quot;Always Elias Hicks gives the service of pointing to the fountain of all naked theology, all religion, all worship, all the truth to which you are possibly eligible—namely in yourself and your inherent relations. Others talk of Bibles, saints, churches, exhortations, vicarious atonements—the canons outside of yourself and apart from man—Elias Hicks points to the religion inside of man&#x27;s very own nature. This he incessantly labors to kindle, nourish, educate, bring forward and strengthen.&quot;

==Anti-slavery activism==
Elias Hicks was one of the early Quaker abolitionists. In 1778 on Long Island, he joined with fellow Quakers who had begun manumitting their slaves as early as March 1776 (James Titus and Phebe Willets Mott Dodge). The Quakers at Westbury Meeting were amongst the first in New York to do so and, gradually following their example, all Westbury Quaker slaves were freed by 1799.

In 1794, Hicks was a founder of the Charity Society of Jericho and Westbury Meetings, established to give aid to local poor African Americans and provide their children with education.

In 1811, Hicks wrote &quot;Observations on the Slavery of Africans and Their Descendants&quot; and in it he linked the moral issue of emancipation to the Quaker Peace Testimony, by stating that slavery was the product of war. He identified economic reasons for the perpetuation of slavery:

Q. 10. By what class of the people is the slavery of the Africans and their descendants supported and encouraged? A. Principally by the purchasers and consumers of the produce of the slaves&#x27; labour; as the profits arising from the produce of their labour, is the only stimulus or inducement for making slaves.

and he advocated a consumer boycott of slave-produced goods to remove the economic reasons for their existence:

Q. 11. What effect would it have on the slave holders and their slaves, should the people of the United States of America and the inhabitants of Great Britain, refuse to purchase or make use of any goods that are the product of Slavery? A. It would doubtless have a particular effect on the slave holders, by circumscribing their avarice, and preventing their heaping up riches, and living in a state of luxury and excess on the gain of oppression …

&quot;Observations on the Slavery of Africans and Their Descendents&quot; gave the free produce movement its central argument. This movement promoted an embargo of all goods produced by slave labor, which were mainly cotton cloth and cane sugar, in favor of produce from the paid labor of free people. Though the free produce movement was not intended to be a religious response to slavery, most of the free produce stores were Quaker in origin, as with the first such store, that of Benjamin Lundy in Baltimore in 1826.

Hicks supported Lundy&#x27;s scheme to assist the emigration of freed slaves to Haiti and in 1824, he hosted a meeting on how to facilitate this at his home in Jericho. In the late 1820s, he argued in favor of raising funds to buy slaves and settle them as free people in the American Southwest.

Hicks influenced the abolition of slavery in his home state, from the partial abolition of the &quot;1799 Gradual Abolition Act&quot; to the &quot;1817 Gradual Manumission in New York State Act&quot; which led to the final emancipation of all remaining slaves within the state on July 4, 1827.

==Doctrinal views==
Hicks ministry would be part of the first schism within Quakerism, the 1827-1828 Hicksite-Orthodox split. 

The central doctrinal focus of the Hicksite-Orthodox split was the role of the Bible and Jesus Christ. Both Hicksites and Orthodox Quakers viewed their positions as continuations of the original Quakers views. Though historians such as Glen Crothers argues that the schism resulted from the Second Great Awakening in the United States leading to Orthodox Quakers adopting more Biblical views as influenced by American Evangelicals.

Elias Hicks argued that Inward Light in each individual is the primary focus of an individual’s faith over creed or doctrine, which follows George Fox and early Quaker concepts of inward light as “the presence of Christ in the heart,” God’s presence in each person, and the Holy Spirit speaking through each person. (The interchangeable use of Jesus, God, and the Holy Spirit is due to his and early Quaker rejection of the Trinity.)

As a consequence, the Bible was to Hicks a secondary source of faith and understanding of God, as it is written entirely and divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. He wroteI confirm my doctrine abundantly from their testimony: and I have always endeavored sincerely to place them [the scriptures] in their true place and station, but never dare exalt them above what they themselves declare; and as no spring can rise higher than its fountain, so likewise the Scriptures can only direct to the fountain from whence they originated - the spirit of truth: as saith the apostle, &#x27;The things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God;&#x27; therefore when the Scriptures have directed and pointed us to this light within, or Spirit of Truth, there they must stop - it is their ultimatum - the top stone of what they can do And no other external testimony of men or books can do any more.Hicks sparked great controversy for writing in letters to his friends that the scriptures created more harm than good, because different factions of Christians held the Bible in too high a regard and without using the inward light as the primary source of understanding with which to interpret the Bible.

In a personal letter he wroteFor it is my candid belief, that those that hold and believe the Scriptures to be the only rule of faith and practice, to these it does much more hurt than good. And has anything tended more to divide Christendom into sects and parties than the Scriptures? and by which so many cruel and bloody wars have been promulgated [promoted]. And yet at the same time, may it not be one of the best books, if rightly used under the guidance of the Holy Spirit? But, if abused, like every other blessing, it becomes a curse. Therefore to these it always does more hurt than good; and thou knowest that these comprehend far the greatest part of Christendom!Regarding Jesus Christ, Hicks wrote that the miracles Jesus performed were meant to prove the existence of God. He argued that Jesus was the savior of the Jewish people by replacing the law put forth by Moses. He also argued that Jesus provided the path to salvation for all people exemplified by his life, which was perfectly and entirely guided and united with the Holy Spirit through his inward light. To Hicks, Jesus divinity by being united with God and the Holy Spirit occurred at two points of Jesus’ life, his divine conception and his baptism by John the Baptist.

Regarding salvation, Hicks firstly rejected the concept of original sin. Because of this, he did not argue that the sacrifice of Jesus’ body or his blood provided salvation, nor that faith in him does so. Rather that salvation came through living as Jesus exemplified, that is, in accordance and unity with the Holy Spirit/Inward Light. Consequently Hicks implicitly refutes doctrines of salvation such as penal substitution, or predestination. 

In the year 1829, &quot;Six Queries&quot; were proposed by Thomas Leggett, Jr., of New York, and answered by Elias Hicks. The last was as follows:

Hicks rejected the existence of an external Devil. He never spoke of eternal Hell but he expressed the importance of the soul&#x27;s union &quot;now&quot; in preparation for the &quot;realms of eternity&quot; and how the soul&#x27;s condemnation is elected through our free agency, not by God&#x27;s foreordination.

Hicks rejected of the notion of an outward Devil as the source of evil, but rather emphasized that it was the human &#x27;passions&#x27; or &#x27;propensities&#x27;. Hicks stressed that basic urges, including all sexual passions, were neither implanted by an external evil, but all were aspects of human nature as created by God. Hicks claimed, in his sermon &quot;Let Brotherly Love Continue&quot; at the Byberry Friends Meeting in 1824 that:

He gave us passions—if we may call them passions—in order that we might seek after those things which we need, and which we had a right to experience and know.
Hicks taught that all wrongdoing and suffering occurred in the world as the consequence of &quot;an excess in the indulgence of propensities. Independent of the regulating influence of God&#x27;s light.&quot;

==Hicksite–Orthodox split==
This first split in Quakerism was not entirely due to Hicks&#x27; ministry and internal divisions. It was, in part, also a response within Quakerism to the influences of the Second Great Awakening, the revival of Protestant evangelism that began in the 1790s as a reaction to religious skepticism, deism, and the liberal theology of Rational Christianity.

However, doctrinal tensions among Friends due to Hicks&#x27; teachings had emerged as early as 1808 and as Hicks&#x27; influence grew, prominent visiting English evangelical public Friends, including William Forster and Anna Braithwaite, were prompted to travel to New York State in the period from 1821 to 1827 to denounce his views.

Their presence severely exacerbated the differences among American Quakers, differences that had been underscored by the 1819 split between the American Unitarians and Congregationalists. The influence of Anna Braithwaite was especially strong. She visited the United States between 1823 and 1827 and published her &quot;Letters and observations relating to the controversy respecting the doctrines of Elias Hicks&quot; in 1824 in which she depicted Hicks as a radical eccentric. Hicks felt obliged to respond and in the same year published a letter to his ally in Philadelphia Meeting, Dr. Edwin Atlee, in &quot;The Misrepresentations of Anna Braithwaite&quot;. This in turn was replied to by Braithwaite in &quot;A Letter from Anna Braithwaite to Elias Hicks, On the Nature of his Doctrines&quot; in 1825. Neither party was persuaded by this exchange.

In 1819, Hicks had devoted much energy into influencing the meeting houses in Philadelphia and this was followed by years of intense organizational turmoil. Eventually, due to both external influences and constant internal strife, matters came to a head there in 1826.

After the 1826 Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, at which Hicks&#x27; sermon had stressed the importance of the Inner Light before Scripture, Quaker elders decided to visit each meeting house in the city to examine the doctrinal soundness of all ministers and elders. This caused great resentment that culminated at the following Philadelphia Yearly Meeting in 1827. Hicks was not present when the differences between the meeting houses ended in acrimony and division, precipitated by the inability of the Meeting to reach consensus on the appointment of a new clerk required to record its discernment.
Though the initial separation was intended to be temporary, by 1828, there were two independent Quaker groupings in the city, both claiming to be the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting. Other yearly meetings split along similar lines during subsequent years, including those in New York, Baltimore, Ohio, and Indiana. Those who followed Hicks became termed Hicksites and his critics termed Orthodox Friends, each faction considering itself to be the true expression of the legacy of the founder of the Friends, George Fox. 

The split was also based on marked socioeconomic factors with Hicksite Friends being mostly poor and rural and with Orthodox Friends being mostly urban and middle-class. Many of the rural country Friends kept to Quaker traditions of &quot;plain speech&quot; and &quot;plain dress&quot;, both long-abandoned by Quakers in the towns and cities.

Both Orthodox and Hicksite factions were active in the formation of educational institutions. To wit, Orthodox Quakers founded Haverford College and Hicksites Swarthmore College.

Both the Orthodox and Hicksite Friends experienced further schisms. The main following of the Orthodox Friends followed the practices of the English Quaker Joseph John Gurney who possessed an evangelical position. As time went on, a majority of the meetings endorsed forms of worship much like those of a traditional Protestant church. Friends in line with Gurney became known as Gurneyites. Those Orthodox Friends who did not agree with the practices of the Gurneyites, led by John Wilbur of Rhode Island, branched off to form the Wilburite branch of Conservative, Primitive and Independent yearly meetings. Those Hicksite Friends who did not agree with the lessened discipline within the Hicksite yearly meetings founded Congregational, or Progressive groups.

In 1828, the split in American Quakerism also spread to the Quaker community in Canada that had immigrated there from New York, the New England states and Pennsylvania in the 1790s. This resulted in a parallel system of Yearly Meetings in Upper Canada, as in the United States.

The eventual division between Hicksites and the evangelical Orthodox Friends in the US was both deep and long-lasting. Full reconciliation between them took decades to achieve, from the first reunified Monthly Meetings in the 1920s until finally resolved with the reunification of Baltimore Yearly Meeting in 1968.

==Later life==

On June 24, 1829, at the age of 81, Elias Hicks went on his final traveling ministry to western and central New York State, arriving home in Jericho on November 11, 1829. There, in January 1830, he suffered a stroke that left him partially paralyzed and on February 14, 1830, he suffered an incapacitating secondary stroke. He died some two weeks later on February 27, 1830, his dying concern being that no cotton blanket, a product of slavery, should cover him on his deathbed. Elias Hicks was interred in the Jericho Friends&#x27; Burial Ground as was earlier his wife, Jemima, who predeceased him on March 17, 1829. Samuel E. Clements a editor of the newspaper the &quot;Patriot&quot; aroused controversy when he and two friends attempted to dig up the corpse Elias Hicks to create a plaster mold of his head.

<text>The Illawarra Steelers are an Australian rugby league football club based in the city of Wollongong, New South Wales. The club competed in Australia&#x27;s top-level rugby league competition from 1982 until 1998. On 13 December 1980, they were the first non-Sydney based team to be admitted into the New South Wales Rugby League premiership, with the Canberra Raiders being admitted later ensuring an even number of teams in the competition for the start of their first season, 1982. Over their seventeen years in the top grade, the club received three wooden spoons, made the play-offs twice and had a total of three of its players (two New South Wales Blues and one Queensland Maroon) selected to play for the Australia national rugby league team.

Following the Super League War and the NRL&#x27;s intention the reduce the number of teams, the Steelers approached the St. George Dragons part way through the 1998 season to discuss forming a joint-venture and ensure the partial survival of both clubs. On 23 September 1998, Rugby League&#x27;s first joint-venture, the St. George Illawarra Dragons, were officially announced. The Steelers share in the club was privatised to Wollongong-based WIN Corporation in 2018.

Illawarra still field stand alone teams in the Lisa Fiaola Cup (women&#x27;s under 17&#x27;s) and Tarsha Gale Cup (women&#x27;s under 18&#x27;s), S. G. Ball Cup (under 18&#x27;s) and Harold Matthews Cup (under 16&#x27;s) competitions as the Steelers.

The 23,750 capacity WIN Stadium is the Steelers home stadium.

== History ==

===Formation===
The Illawarra Rugby League made several attempts to enter the NSWRL competition, the first major attempt was in the 1950s. It made a much more serious attempt for entry into the 1967 season but were blocked by the Country Rugby League (CRL) who used their constitution to prevent Illawarra&#x27;s plans of playing in the Sydney competition. This was a crucial moment in the emergence of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, as it was after Illawarra were blocked and the NSWRL wanted a second new club to enter with Penrith, preferably in the South of Sydney due to continued success at that time of the St George Dragons, to avoid the need for a bye that &quot;the shire&#x27;s&quot; submission was successful.

In this unsuccessful bid, Illawarra were to be backed by the then wealthy Illawarra Leagues Club in Church Street, Wollongong. The club is the second oldest leagues club in the world. It was originally established to financially support top class rugby league and soccer in the region.

On 13 December 1980, the NSWRL voted almost unanimously for Illawarra to enter in the 1982 season. Only three dissenting votes were counted, which were the three CRL representatives present. Illawarra&#x27;s organiser Bob Millward told those at the meeting that rugby league in the region depended on this bid getting the go ahead. Interest in the region had turned away from local football to the Sydney competition. The &quot;Illawarra Mercury&quot; daily newspaper was increasing its coverage of the Sydney premiership and Illawarra&#x27;s inclusion was viewed as the best way of reviving the local league.

===1980s===

Illawarra entered the competition in 1982, with financial backing from many of the local leagues clubs. Their first captain was star fullback John Dorahy, and first coach Allan Fitzgibbon. Unfortunately, the recession hit hard and the leagues club money dried up and the Steelers were a new club in desperate financial trouble. In 1984, BHP Steel saved the club, signing on as the major sponsor. BHP stayed with the Steelers until they left the NRL at the end of the 1998 season.

Their first 8 seasons produced 3 wooden spoons, but things started to improve for the club. In the 1989 Panasonic Cup the club reached the final which was played against the Brisbane Broncos at Parramatta Stadium. The Broncos raced to a 16–0 lead and it seemed the Steelers much more fancied opponents would run away with the game. But Illawarra, inspired by eventual man-of-the-match, Great Britain international Andy Gregory, hit back. Young Illawarra Juniors such as Brett Rodwell and Rod Wishart made their mark in this game, players that would form the foundation of the club&#x27;s improved performances in the early 1990s. Illawarra lost the match 22–20, however Brisbane scored a try off what appeared to be forward pass. The large Illawarra contingent at Parramatta Stadium booed the Broncos after their win, with Brisbane captain Wally Lewis gaining their ire by gesturing back. Illawarra&#x27;s performance inspired Australian folk singer John Williamson to write a song about the match. The 1989 season also saw Gregory&#x27;s Wigan and Great Britain teammate, Steve Hampson, playing for the Steelers.

===1990s===
1990 saw big improvements with the club finishing not too far away from the top five. The Steelers licensed club opened its doors thanks to the efforts of the local community and businesses. Whereas Sydney teams had huge financial support from their respective leagues clubs, Illawarra for the first time had its own small leagues club but with an enviable major sponsor (BHP Steel) and sleeve sponsor combination – The Steelers making Rugby League history as the first club to have a sleeve sponsor, with MMI Insurance getting on board.

A new coach by the name of Graham Murray turned Illawarra into an almost unbeatable force at the Wollongong Showground in 1991, losing only to the Penrith Panthers who went on to win the premiership. A crushing 44–4 win over Canterbury-Bankstown, an upset win over Manly in a Sunday match of the round as well as a big win over Brisbane, 19–2, were signs of things to come. A crucial refereeing decision by Bill Harrigan towards the end of the season in a game at Penrith Stadium put an end to their finals aspirations. Harrigan, much to his credit, apologised in the media after the game. Thus Illawarra missed out on a place in the finals by just two points, despite having a season points differential second only to eventual premiers, Penrith.

The Steelers were able to avenge their 1989 Panasonic Cup Final loss to Brisbane by beating them in the 1992 pre-season Tooheys Challenge Cup, in a try-less final at Dubbo, 4–2. This sparked their successful 1992 Winfield Cup campaign, going to within one game from the Grand Final. Illawarra&#x27;s first semi-final was against future merger partner St George, beating &quot;big-brother&quot; 18–16. Next a loss to the Broncos 22–12 and their last chance against St George, losing 4–0. However, Illawarra were denied tries on several controversial occasions leaving the Steelers with a bitter end to their successful season.

During the 1992 season, the Steelers hosted the touring Great Britain Lions. In front of 9,500 fans at Steelers Stadium with the tourists winning a tight game 11–10, Illawarra resting several star players.

1993 was a season met by Steelers fans with high expectations, but crucial tight losses and games they were expected to win saw the side finish just outside the top 5.

1994 was better with the club putting together some great performances but three draws would end up costly, the Steelers finishing in 6th place, 2 points behind Brisbane. The club had established itself as a credible force in the Winfield Cup with many expecting a brighter future but things would soon be turned upside down.

Super League hit in 1995 and the Steelers were in for a rough ride. The good work in becoming a credible force in the competition went out the window with the sacking of Graham Murray, which is the only incident where anyone in the competition lost their job as a direct result of the Super League war. Murray was organising meetings between Illawarra players and Super League officials, as Super League had intentions of either getting the Steelers or possibly a new Illawarra club. Local club Wests Illawarra were reported in the &quot;Illawarra Mercury&quot; as being a potential Illawarra Super League club. Local league fans reacted angrily and nothing came of it. Illawarra and its supporters remained loyal to the ARL, though Steelers board member and then speaker of the House of Representatives, Dr Stephen Martin, resigned from the club citing the need to join Super League for them to survive. Martin would be proved right within three years.

1996 was another year of disappointment, with players not seeing eye-to-eye with new coach Allan McMahon. A horror 54-4 thrashing at the hands of arch-rival Brisbane Broncos was the low point. McMahon, despite signing a three-year contract, was sacked at the end of the season and was replaced the next season by former player and then reserve grade coach Andrew Farrar.

In 1997&#x27;s stand-alone Australian Rugby League competition, the Steelers finished sixth, qualifying for the Finals series, only to bow out in the first week at a rain sodden and sparsely populated Parramatta Stadium. Having beaten the Gold Coast Chargers comprehensively in Wollongong in the final round, they put in shocking performance to lose to the same side they had just beaten the previous week.

1998 saw the Steelers come agonisingly close to the finals, missing out with other results going against them and a heartbreaking 1 point loss to eventual grand finalists Canterbury-Bankstown in their final match.

During season 1998, the newly established NRL administration announced the entry criteria for teams to compete from the year 2000, with clubs offered incentives to form joint ventures. A controversial aspect of the criteria for the Illawarra region was the classification of the Steelers as a Sydney club. Additionally, Newcastle, Canberra and Auckland would be given automatic entry, with Illawarra believing they too were an important regional centre that should stand alone.

Alas, with the possibility of not making the cut, Illawarra approached St George and initiated joint venture talks midway through 1998. Western Suburbs (whom Illawarra were rumoured to be merging with in the 1980s) and Cronulla both expressed interest but Steelers CEO Bob Millward claimed that the club&#x27;s preferred partner was always St George. The joint venture was officially announced at the end of the season, and would be named St George Illawarra Dragons, playing 50% of their home games in Sydney and 50% in Wollongong in 1999.

The Illawarra Steelers produced some brilliant playing talent, most notably International representatives Rod Wishart and Paul McGregor. Former Steelers players Trent Barrett, Shaun Timmins and Craig Fitzgibbon have gone on to represent their country since the Steelers&#x27; final stand-alone season in 1998.

===Season summaries===
=== Joint venture ===
The Illawarra Steelers decided to form a joint venture with the St. George Dragons for the 1999 NRL season to form the St. George Illawarra Dragons. The Illawarra and St George contingents are equal stakeholders in the new club, and until 2014, half of the new team&#x27;s home games were played at WIN Stadium. The Illawarra Steelers have at times provided the bulk of St George Illawarra&#x27;s squad, including internationals Matt Cooper, Luke Bailey, Jason Ryles, Shaun Timmins, Trent Barrett, Brett Morris, Josh Morris and Ben Creagh.

The joint venture is often seen as a takeover. Many supporters feel that the Illawarra is not appropriately acknowledged in St George Illawarra, as the logo and main jersey were taken directly from those of St George (albeit with the addition of &quot;Illawarra&quot; to the bottom of the emblem). Furthermore, Illawarra fans continue to be alienated by St George supporters who still chant &quot;St George&quot; at games and wave banners like &quot;Great St George Team&quot;. The media and other rugby league fans also often leave out Illawarra and continue to call the joint venture entity &quot;St George&quot;, much to the chagrin and dismay of those from the Illawarra side. St George Illawarra has sometimes taken token steps to acknowledge Illawarra. One example of this is that, on 18 April 2004 against Penrith at WIN Stadium, St George Illawarra introduced an alternate jersey which was predominantly red (with white stripes), this being recognisably similar to the former Steelers&#x27; jersey. This replaced the &quot;blood and bandages&quot; jersey of red-and-white horizontal stripes, which was also a former St George jersey. St George Illawarra have since reverted to the old St George &quot;blood and bandages&quot; design as their alternate jersey.

While Illawarra is still somewhat represented in the National Rugby League by the St George Illawarra Dragons, the Illawarra Steelers participated as a single entity in the NSW Cup until the end of 2017 (as the Illawarra Cutters from 2012 and then Illawarra RLFC in 2017, due to a sponsorship deal with Illawarra Coal) and in the junior competitions, most notably S.G. Ball Cup and Harold Matthews Cup. The Steelers made the Harold Matthews Cup grand final in 2011, losing 13–12 to the Canterbury Bulldogs.
In early 2006, WIN Television Network (originating from and headquartered in Wollongong) bought a 25% share in the St. George Illawarra club for $6.5 million (half of Illawarra&#x27;s share), erasing most of the debt Illawarra owed to St. George. This formalised the strong support the network has shown for the Steelers in years gone by and ensured that Wollongong will continue to host top level rugby league. WIN Corp can only sell their stake back to the Steelers, should they wish to withdraw their involvement, thus ensuring Illawarra are always properly represented in the joint venture.

In 2008, Illawarra&#x27;s debt to St George was paid off, with the 20% sale of the Steelers Club building to a Bermuda-based company owned by Illawarra billionaire (and WIN Television boss) Bruce Gordon.

In 2016, Illawarra won their first and only premiership title with the 2016 against Mount Pritchard Mounties at Parramatta Stadium. This was the final game ever played at this venue.

One week later, Illawarra claimed the NRL State Championship on NRL Grand Final day with an emphatic 54–12 win over Queensland Cup winners the Burleigh Bears at Stadium Australia.

On 27 October 2017, it was announced that Illawarra would be replaced by The St George Illawarra Dragons for The 2018 Intrust Super Premiership NSW season as part of a restructure in the competition. It was the first time since 2007 that a full St George Illawarra Dragons side featured in the reserve grade competition.

The approach brought the club in line with the NRL&#x27;s ‘whole of game’ strategy that also saw top-grade squads increased from 25 players to 30. Club director of rugby league pathways Ian Millward said of the change “There&#x27;s obviously a lot of changes in rugby league at the moment, one of the changes we’ve made is that the reserve grade team is St George Illawarra,” Millward said. “What it gives us is a clear pathway where younger players aspire to be Dragons right through to our first grade squad. There&#x27;s a clear acknowledgment for coaches, training staff and players that when they&#x27;re in our environment they are a part of the St George Illawarra Dragons&quot;.

In August 2018 WIN Corporation purchased the Illawarra Steelers remaining 25% stake in the joint venture St George Illawarra Dragons club for a &quot;commercially in confidence&quot; sum. The St. George Dragons and the Illawarra-based WIN Corporation now have a 50% stake each. WIN Corporation has paid off the $6 million debt the St. George Illawarra Dragons owed the NRL.

==Name, Emblem and Mascot==
The name &quot;Steelers&quot; was chosen in reference to the local Port Kembla Steelworks, which was the Illawarra region&#x27;s largest economy employer. (BHP, who owned the steelworks, eventually sponsored the team for most of their existence.) Other names considered were &quot;Lions&quot; and &quot;Steelies&quot;. The actual &#x27;Steelers&#x27; name came after a competition was run to choose a name. The name was chosen by Dapto High School student Roger White, who was also a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers NFL team in the United States. Roger responded to a competition published in the Illawarra Mercury Newspaper.

Their mascot from 1982 to 1998 was the legendary &quot;Stanley, the Steel Avenger&quot;, also commonly referred to as &quot;Stanley the Steeler&quot;. Stanley holds the dubious honour of being the only team mascot in Rugby League history to be sent from the field. In Round 20 of the 1995 season, Illawarra hosted Balmain at Steelers Stadium. A fight between players spilled over the sideline, with Stanley reaching in to separate players. The referee instantly sent Stanley off, whilst the fight ensued.

==Colours==
The original Steelers jersey was all scarlet with two white hooped stripes on each sleeve. The alternate design was the same colours in reverse. The club kept this design until 1995, adding a third stripe on each sleeve and three hoops around the middle of the jersey to the white alternate jersey, then adopting the same design for the scarlet jersey in 1997. The Steelers simplistic design compared well with the many &quot;space-aged&quot; designs of several other clubs that came and went each season throughout the Super League period and into the 2000s. For the Steelers heritage days in 2005 and 2010, the Dragons wore an Illawarra heritage jersey, which was the same as the original Steelers jumper. This move proved very popular amongst former Illawarra fans. From 2011 to 2013, the Dragons wore an alternate jersey based on the original Steelers&#x27; design.

The colours scarlet and white were automatically chosen as they were long worn by Illawarra representative teams in several sports. Local miners uniforms in the early 20th century were scarlet and some associate this with the reason for it becoming the region&#x27;s sporting colours. It is also the colour of the Illawarra Flame Tree, another symbol of the region.

The Illawarra Cutters wore a kit similar to that of the club&#x27;s 1980s and early 1990s design.

Many of the current NRL clubs are reverting to more simplistic jerseys, such as Illawarra&#x27;s fellow 1982 entrants Canberra.

The junior Illawarra sides such as the Harold Matthews Cup and S. G. Ball Cup sides currently wear the 1980s design.

==Illawarra Steelers Leagues Club==
The Illawarra Steelers Leagues Club is situated in the middle of the City Beach precinct, the Steelers Club is located adjacent to WIN Entertainment Centre and WIN Stadium. It is directly across the road from the grounds Western Grandstand. Established in 1990, the club has struggled in comparison to the much larger and more popular leagues clubs in the region, such as Collegians, Dapto Leagues Club, Wests Illawarra Leagues Club, and Shellharbour Workers Club. However, after a major restructure of its operations, the Steelers Club has been trading profitably through the 2010s. Twenty percent of the club premises were sold to Bermuda-based Billionaire and owner of WIN Corp, Bruce Gordon. The sale fetched 2.6 million dollars.

==Stadium==
The Illawarra Steelers played all their home games at the Wollongong Showground (currently named WIN Stadium). The ground for many years was also named Steelers Stadium, which many still affectionately call the ground.

The Steelers record attendance in Wollongong was against St. George on 21 May 1993 at 17,527. The lowest crowd record was against Cronulla on 6 July 1985 at 3,433.

The Illawarra sides in lower grades still the play the bulk of home games at WIN Stadium. On rare occasions, the Illawarra Cutters move home games to WIN Jubilee Oval to coincide with NRL fixtures and to also other venues on the South Coast.

==Junior Steelers==
The Illawarra Steelers still field teams in the under-age NSWRL competitions of Harold Matthews Cup (U-16s) and S. G. Ball Cup (U-18s). In 2019, Illawarra won the S. G. Ball Cup defeating Manly 34–23 in the final at the new Western Sydney Stadium.

==Supporters==
Counted amongst the club&#x27;s supporters is Olympic athlete Louise McPaul.

==The Future==
The Illawarra Steelers club members voted unanimously to allow the sale of 20% of the club premises to a company owned by Bermuda-based Wollongong billionaire Bruce Gordon. The sale fetched the club $2.6 million, allowing Illawarra to clear all debts to St George. Whilst the Steelers Club is improving its financial position, and now trading profitably, the club still finds itself struggling against the larger and more popular of other Leagues Clubs in Wollongong such as Collegians, The Builders Club, Wests Illawarra and Illawarra Leagues, and also Shellharbour Workers Club in Shellharbour. The Steelers were competitive with Sydney Clubs by the 1990s but Super League raised the financial bar too quickly and blew them out of the water at a crucial time in their development. Being classified as a Sydney metropolitan team during the NRL&#x27;s criteria for entry into the 14 team competition for the year 2000 and measuring the club&#x27;s performances through the devastating Super League period left Illawarra at a huge disadvantage compared with other non-Sydney based clubs such as Canberra, Newcastle, Melbourne and North Queensland. The only hope for Illawarra&#x27;s return to the big league would be to gain the backing of a wealthy &#x27;white knight&#x27; or consortium who can see the potential of a stand-alone Illawarra Steelers - convince the NRL and invest significant money so they can keep their local talent and achieve the potential that they started to reveal in the early 1990s.

<doc id="853882" wikidata="Q1029093" url="?curid=853882" title="Scoop (novel)">
<text>Scoop is a 1938 novel by the English writer Evelyn Waugh. It is a satire of sensationalist journalism and foreign correspondents.

==Summary==
William Boot, a young man who lives in genteel poverty, far from the iniquities of London, contributes nature notes to Lord Copper&#x27;s &quot;Daily Beast&quot;, a national daily newspaper. He is dragooned into becoming a foreign correspondent, when the editors mistake him for John Courteney Boot, a fashionable novelist and a remote cousin. He is sent to Ishmaelia, a fictional state in East Africa, to report on the crisis there.

Lord Copper believes it &quot;a very promising little war&quot; and proposes &quot;to give it fullest publicity&quot;. Despite his total ineptitude, Boot accidentally gets the journalistic &quot;scoop&quot; of the title. When he returns, the credit goes to the other Boot and William is left to return to his bucolic pursuits, much to his relief.

==Background==
The novel is partly based on Waugh&#x27;s experience of working for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, when he was sent to cover Benito Mussolini&#x27;s expected invasion of Abyssinia, later known as the Second Italo-Abyssinian War (October 1935 to May 1936). When he got a scoop on the invasion, he telegraphed the story back in Latin for secrecy but they discarded it. Waugh wrote up his travels more factually in &quot;Waugh in Abyssinia&quot; (1936), which complements &quot;Scoop&quot;.

Lord Copper, the newspaper magnate, has been said to be an amalgam of Lord Northcliffe and Lord Beaverbrook: a character so fearsome that his obsequious foreign editor, Mr Salter, can never openly disagree with him, answering &quot;Definitely, Lord Copper&quot; and &quot;Up to a point, Lord Copper&quot; in place of &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. Lord Copper&#x27;s idea of the lowliest of his employees is a book reviewer. The historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote, &quot;I have Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s authority for stating that Lord Beaverbrook was not the original of Lord Copper.&quot; Bill Deedes thought that the portrait of Copper exhibited the &quot;folie de grandeur&quot; of Rothermere and Beaverbrook and included &quot;the ghost of Rothermere&#x27;s elder brother, Lord Northcliffe. Before he died tragically, deranged and attended by nurses, Northcliffe was already exhibiting some of Copper&#x27;s eccentricities—his megalomania, his habit of giving ridiculous orders to underlings&quot;.

It is widely believed that Waugh based his protagonist, William Boot, on Deedes, a junior reporter who arrived in Addis Ababa aged 22, with &quot;a quarter of a ton of baggage&quot;. In his memoir &quot;At War with Waugh&quot;, Deedes wrote that: &quot;Waugh like most good novelists drew on more than one person for each of his characters. He drew on me for my excessive baggage—and perhaps for my naivety...&quot; He further observed that Waugh was reluctant to acknowledge models, so that with &quot;Black Mischief&quot;&#x27;s portrait of a young ruler, &quot;Waugh insisted, as he usually did, that his portrait of Seth, Emperor of Azania, was not drawn from any real person such as Haile Selassie&quot;. According to Peter Stothard, a more direct model for Boot may have been William Beach Thomas, &quot;a quietly successful countryside columnist and literary gent who became a calamitous &quot;Daily Mail&quot; war correspondent&quot;.

The novel is full of all but identical opposites: Lord Copper of &quot;The Beast&quot;, Lord Zinc of the &quot;Daily Brute&quot; (the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Daily Express&quot;); the CumReds and the White Shirts, parodies of Communists (comrades) and Black Shirts (fascists) etc.

Other models for characters (again, according to Deedes): &quot;Jakes is drawn from John Gunther of the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. In [one] excerpt, Jakes is found writing, &#x27;The Archbishop of Canterbury who, it is well known, is behind Imperial Chemicals...&#x27; Authentic Gunther.&quot; The most recognisable figure from Fleet Street is Sir Jocelyn Hitchcock, Waugh&#x27;s portrait of Sir Percival Phillips, working then for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Mrs Stitch is partly based on Lady Diana Cooper, Mr Baldwin is a combination of Francis Rickett and Antonin Besse. Waugh&#x27;s despised Oxford tutor C. R. M. F. Cruttwell makes his customary cameo appearance, as General Cruttwell.

One of the points of the novel is that even if there is little news happening, the world&#x27;s media descending requires that something happen to please their editors and owners back home and so they will create news.

==Reception==
Christopher Hitchens, introducing the 2000 Penguin Classics edition of &quot;Scoop&quot;, said &quot;[i]n the pages of &quot;Scoop&quot; we encounter Waugh at the mid-season point of his perfect pitch; youthful and limber and light as a feather&quot; and noted: &quot;The manners and &quot;mores&quot; of the press, are the recurrent motif of the book and the chief reason for its enduring magic...this world of callousness and vulgarity and philistinism...&quot;Scoop&quot; endures because it is a novel of pitiless realism; the mirror of satire held up to catch the Caliban of the press corps, as no other narrative has ever done save Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur&#x27;s &quot;The Front Page&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Scoop&quot; was included in &quot;The Observer&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest novels of all time. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Scoop&quot; No. 75 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

==Adaptations==
In 1972, &quot;Scoop&quot; was made into a BBC serial: it was adapted by Barry Took, and starred Harry Worth as William Boot and James Beck as Corker.

In 1987, William Boyd adapted the novel into a two-hour TV film, &quot;Scoop&quot;. Directed by Gavin Millar, it starred Michael Maloney as William Boot and Denholm Elliott as Salter.

In 2009, the novel was serialised and broadcast on BBC Radio 4.

==Legacy==
Waugh includes passing mentions of Lord Copper and the &quot;Daily Beast&quot; in his later novels, &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (1945) and &quot;Officers and Gentlemen&quot; (1955).

&quot;Feather-footed through the plashy fen passes the questing vole&quot;, a line from one of Boot&#x27;s countryside columns, has become a famous comic example of overblown prose style. It inspired the name of the environmentalist magazine &quot;Vole&quot;, which was originally titled &quot;The Questing Vole&quot;.

The fictional newspaper in &quot;Scoop&quot; served as the inspiration for the title of Tina Brown&#x27;s online news source, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;.

<text>André William Gregory (born May 11, 1934) is a French-born American theatre director, writer and actor. He is best known for co-writing and starring in &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot;, a 1981 comedy-drama film directed by Louis Malle. Gregory studied acting at The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City.

==Life and career==
Gregory was born in Paris, France, in 1934 to Russian Jewish parents. He studied at Harvard University, where he was affiliated with Adams House.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Gregory directed a number of avant-garde productions developed through ensemble collaboration, the most famous of which was &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1970), based on Lewis Carroll&#x27;s two classic Alice books. He founded his own theatrical company, The Manhattan Project, in 1968. In 1975 he directed &quot;Our Late Night&quot;, the first produced play by Wallace Shawn, which began a long working relationship between the two men.

Shortly afterward, Gregory&#x27;s growing misgivings about the role of theatre in modern life, and what he felt was a trend toward fascism in the United States, led him to abruptly abandon theatre and leave the country. As described in the film &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot; (1981), he traveled to Poland at director Jerzy Grotowski&#x27;s invitation, where he developed a number of experimental theatrical events for private audiences. He spent several years in a variety of esoteric spiritual communities (such as Findhorn) developing an interest and practice in what could be called New Age beliefs.

Although Gregory left the theatre in 1975, he has returned several times to direct small productions, usually for invited audiences. These included a long-running workshop of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (adapted by David Mamet), which was developed from 1990 to 1994 and featured Shawn and Julianne Moore. Though never publicly performed, it was released as the film &quot;Vanya on 42nd Street&quot; by Gregory and Louis Malle. He appeared as himself, directing the play featured within the film. Gregory also directed a radio production of Shawn&#x27;s play, &quot;The Designated Mourner,&quot; in 2002.

He has had occasional film roles as a character actor, including John the Baptist in &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; and Reverend Spellgood in &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot;, and as Dante, a restaurateur, alongside Rosanna Arquette, David Bowie, and Buck Henry in &quot;The Linguini Incident&quot;.

His best-known film performance was as the title character in &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot; (1981), directed by Louis Malle, in which he and Wallace Shawn, playing characters based on themselves, have a long conversation over dinner. They discuss Gregory&#x27;s spiritual sojourn in Europe and his doubts about the future of theatre and of Western civilization in general. 

He appeared with Goldie Hawn in &quot;Protocol&quot; (1984). In 1988 he played the father in &quot;Some Girls,&quot; with Jennifer Connelly and Patrick Dempsey. In 1993, he performed in the movie &quot;Demolition Man&quot; with Sylvester Stallone.

Returning to theatre, Gregory directed Shawn&#x27;s play &quot;Grasses of a Thousand Colors&quot;, which premiered at the Royal Court Theatre in London in May 2009. He next worked with Shawn on a new version of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Master Builder&quot;. This resulted in the film &quot;Fear of Falling&quot; (2013), directed by Jonathan Demme. The film was retitled &quot;A Master Builder&quot; at its opening in New York in June 2014.

In 2013, he directed &quot;Grasses of a Thousand Colors&quot; and &quot;The Designated Mourner,&quot; starring Shawn in a co-production between Theatre for a New Audience and The Public Theater in New York.

A 2013 documentary about Gregory&#x27;s life, &quot;Andre Gregory: Before and After Dinner&quot;, was directed by his wife, Cindy Kleine. He and Kleine discussed it on the May 3, 2013, episode of &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;.

<doc id="853900" wikidata="Q5126318" url="?curid=853900" title="Claremont McKenna College">
<text>Claremont McKenna College (CMC) is a private liberal arts college in Claremont, California. It has a curricular emphasis on government, economics, public affairs, finance, and international relations. CMC is a member of the Claremont Colleges consortium.

Founded as a men&#x27;s college in 1946, CMC became coeducational in 1976. The college focuses primarily on undergraduate education, but in 2007 it established the Robert Day School of Economics and Finance, which offers a master&#x27;s program in finance. CMC is known for its faculty&#x27;s conservative political orientation relative to comparable liberal arts colleges. , there were 1,338 undergraduate students and postgraduate students.

CMC competes in the NCAA Division III&#x27;s Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC) conference in a joint athletic program with Harvey Mudd College and Scripps College. Notable alumni include prominent politicians and financiers such as Henry Kravis, a significant benefactor of CMC.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Claremont McKenna College began as Claremont Men&#x27;s College in September 1946 with a founding class of 86 students and seven faculty. Many of its first students were veterans of World War II attending college on the G.I. Bill. Claremont Men&#x27;s College was the third Claremont College, following Pomona College and Scripps College. CMC founded with the mission to foster leadership in its students in the fields of government, economics, and international affairs. The college&#x27;s motto is &quot;Crescit cum commercio civitas&quot;, or &quot;Civilization prospers with commerce&quot;.

=== Coeducation ===

Following a national trend toward coeducation among colleges such as Yale, Williams, Amherst and Dartmouth, Claremont Men&#x27;s College faced compelling arguments to admit women in the 1970s. With support from students represented by the Associated Students of Claremont&#x27;s Men College, the trustees of the college voted to admit women to CMC with a two-thirds vote. A year later, in 1976 Claremont Men&#x27;s College admitted the first women to their freshman class. Jack Stark, the president of Claremont Men&#x27;s College during this transition, would later say the admission of women was the college&#x27;s most important moment. The women of the earliest classes of CMC are known as &quot;Pioneers&quot; and graduated with degrees that still bore the &quot;Claremont&#x27;s Mens College&quot; moniker. It was not until 1981 that the college was renamed Claremont McKenna College after Donald McKenna, a founding trustee.

In November 1989, a father of a CMC student hired a stripper to perform in the college&#x27;s dining hall, sparking protests among some students. Then-president Jack Stark told &quot;The New York Times&quot; he did not wish to comment on &quot;whether [the incident] was or was not degrading to women&quot;.

=== 2000s ===
On September 27, 2007, the college announced a $200 million gift from alumnus and trustee Robert Addison Day to create the &quot;Robert Day Scholars Program&quot; and a master&#x27;s program in finance. CMC literature professor Robert Faggen sent a letter signed by several other literature professors to CMC president Pamela Gann, saying they were concerned that the gift will &quot;distort the college into a single focus trade school.&quot; In June 2020, RePEc ranked the college&#x27;s economics department, the Robert Day School, as #4 in its list of top US Economics Departments at Liberal Arts Colleges.

On January 30, 2012, President Gann revealed that a &quot;high-ranking admissions official,&quot; later identified as the school&#x27;s former dean of admissions, Richard C. Vos, had been inflating SAT scores reported to the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; by 10–20 points over the previous six years. A 2013 &quot;Time&quot; article opined that &quot;such a small differential could not have significantly affected &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings&quot;. A report commissioned by the college claimed to have found no evidence that these misrepresentations were made to inflate the school&#x27;s rankings. The controversy prompted &quot;Forbes&quot; to omit CMC from its annual rankings in 2013.

In November 2015, the college made national news when the dean of students resigned after students protested what they called a lack of institutional resources for marginalized students; the dean had implied in an email that minority students did not fit the &quot;CMC mold&quot; (the dean had sent the student an email stating: 
and her response to an incident of allegedly culturally appropriative Halloween costumes was seen as lacking. These protests closely followed and were associated with the 2015 University of Missouri protests.

On April 6, 2017, a group of approximately 300 student protesters (many of whom attended the other Claremont Colleges) blockaded the Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum in an attempt to shut down a speech by conservative pundit Heather Mac Donald. The college livestreamed the talk, as audiences were unable to enter the building. The college disciplined seven of its students who participated in the blockade, including suspending two for a semester and three for a full year.

In 2021, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ranked CMC No. 1 out of all colleges and universities in the United States for free speech.

The Campaign for CMC: Responsible Leadership raised more than $1 billion to double the size of its campus and expand science programs, faculty and financial aid.

==Campus==
The predominant architectural style of CMC&#x27;s campus is California modernism, reflecting the style popular at the time of the college&#x27;s founding in the 1940s. In recent years, the older, more pedestrian and utilitarian buildings have begun to be replaced by new, more ostentatious constructions, namely the Kravis Center at the western edge of campus and the $70million Roberts Pavilion athletics center. The campus also has sculptures and murals created by contemporary artists.

== Organization and administration ==
CMC is chartered as a private, non-profit organization and is a member of the seven-institution Claremont Colleges consortium. Students can take classes at any of the member colleges, and the colleges share libraries, student health, a bookstore, athletic facilities, and various student services. The privately appointed, 40-voting-member board of trustees elects a president to serve as chief executive officer of the college. Hiram Chodosh is CMC&#x27;s fifth president. The president has an executive cabinet of 9 vice presidents, including a VP of Students Affairs and VP of Academic Affairs.

=== Presidents ===
# George C. S. Benson, founding president (1946–1969)
# Howard R. Neville (1969–1970)
# Jack L. Stark (1970–1999)
# Pamela Gann (1999–2013)
#Hiram Chodosh (since 2013)

== Academics ==

=== Rankings ===
&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s 2025 rankings rated Claremont McKenna as tied for 8th-best liberal arts college in the United States. &quot;Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education&quot; US College Rankings 2020 ranked Claremont Mckenna as the 6th-best liberal arts college. In 2017, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Claremont McKenna as the 13th-best among 650 colleges, universities and service academies in the nation. Claremont McKenna is the 10th-most selective college in the nation according to collegesimply. Claremont McKenna is ranked 30th nationally in &quot;Best Universities and Colleges by Salary Potential&quot; by Payscale.

=== Admissions ===
CMC is classified as &quot;most selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. For the incoming class of 2024, CMC accepted 633 applicants (11.2%) from a pool of 5,632.

=== Financial aid ===
Tuition for the 2018–2019 school year is $54,160 ($27,080 per semester) for a full-time student, and room and board is on average $15,930 ($7,965 per semester for double room and 12 meals per week), for a total annual cost of attendance of $70,212.50 with other expected costs included. CMC admits students on a need-blind basis and guarantees to meet the financial need of all its students as determined by the FAFSA and the College Board&#x27;s CSS Profile. For the 2016–2017 year, CMC awarded a total of $27,021,024 in financial aid. 38.9% of students received need-based financial aid with an average total grant aid package of $42,445, while 5.8% of students received merit aid, with an average award of $15,744.

The college, which operates on a semester system, has 12 academic departments, 11 research institutes and 33 on-campus majors, the most popular of which are economics, government, psychology, economics-accounting and international relations. However, as a member of the Claremont Colleges, students at CMC also have the option to study any major that is not offered at CMC given that one of the other colleges has such a major. A popular example is computer science, which is offered by both Harvey Mudd College and Pomona College. The student to faculty ratio is 8:1 with an average class size of 18. 85% of the classes have fewer than 19 students. The six-year graduation rate is 93.3%, and the freshman retention rate is 92.7%.

=== Curriculum ===

About one third of the classes students complete are general education requirements. These include a humanities seminar and a writing seminar their first year, three semesters of a foreign language or demonstrated proficiency, a mathematics or computer science course, one laboratory science course and three semesters of a P.E. course or two seasons on a sports team. In addition, students must complete at least two humanities courses and three social science courses, all in areas outside the student&#x27;s major. All students must complete a senior thesis, which can be either one-semester in length or, to receive departmental honors, two semesters. Claremont McKenna&#x27;s curricular emphasis is on its social sciences, particularly economics, government, international relations, and psychology. CMC also offers an Oxford-style tutorial Philosophy, Politics, and Economics major with two separate tracks of 14 students each. Other multi-disciplinary majors include management engineering, philosophy and public affairs, science and management, econ-accounting, biology-chemistry, and environment, economics, and politics (EEP). CMC also offers the Robert A. Day 4+1 BA/MBA, in which students receive both their BA from Claremont McKenna and their MBA from the Drucker School of Management at Claremont Graduate University in 5 years. Its most popular undergraduate majors, by 2021 graduates, were:
::Economics (90)
::Multi-/Interdisciplinary Studies (27)
::Political Science and Government (24)
::Computer Science (17)
::Experimental Psychology (16)
::International Relations and Affairs (16)

CMC&#x27;s science program is currently offered through the Keck Science Department of Claremont McKenna, Pitzer and Scripps Colleges. The Keck Science Department offers a double year-long introductory science class to allow more flexibility than the former 3 year-long introductory biology, chemistry and physics courses that most science majors must complete. In October 2018, CMC announced that it plans to withdraw from Keck to create its own science department.

Many CMC students study abroad or participate in one of two domestic programs, one in Washington, D.C., and the other in the Silicon Valley. In both of these programs, students complete a full-time internship with a business or government department, remaining full-time students taught at night by CMC professors stationed in the two locations&quot;.

More than 75% percent of students attend graduate school within five years of graduation, and those who choose to go straight to the workforce average a starting salary of $57,156 for the class of 2014, with average signing bonuses averaging $7,905. Of those CMC graduates applying to medical school, 80% get into their first or second choice institutions.

Several CMC students have received notable scholarships.

== Campus life ==

CMC is known for its active party scene and relatively lenient policies on alcohol use. Although the college&#x27;s social scene draws students from the other schools in the consortium and is enjoyed by many, it has also drawn criticism. A 2012 Campus Climate Task Force report published by the school described a &quot;pervasive, &#x27;hyper-masculine&#x27; and heteronormative ethos at CMC&quot; and noted that &quot;while female students are valued as friends and intellectual colleagues during the day, at night and particularly on the weekends, female students reportedly feel they are objectified targets for sex or &#x27;hook-ups.&#x27;&quot; Since 2015, CMC and the other consortium schools have ramped up efforts to reform this culture, including hiring a dedicated Title IX staff member, creating the 7c EmPOWER Center, conducting bystander training under the Teal Dot certification and the establishing a student-run advocates organization that provides 24/7 support for victims of sexual assault.

There is also an abundance of substance-free social programming available for students, notably including events planned by the College Programming Board such as the annual Disneyland trip as well as other on-campus events like arts and service events.
As of fall 2019, student enrollment consisted of 1,335 degree-seeking undergraduate students. The median family income of CMC students is $201,300, the second-highest in California, with 58% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 15% from the bottom 60%. The student body is roughly equally split between men and women, and 21% of students are first-generation. Ninety-five percent of freshmen return for their second year.
Students hail from 47 US states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, and 46 foreign countries, including 16% of students who identify as nonresident alien.

=== The Claremont Colleges ===
Claremont McKenna College is a member of the Claremont Colleges Consortium, and most social activities revolve around the five colleges, or &quot;5Cs&quot;. Claremont McKenna College, Pomona College, Scripps College, Pitzer College, and Harvey Mudd College share dining halls, libraries, and other facilities throughout the contiguous campuses. All five colleges, along with Claremont Graduate University and the Keck Graduate Institute, are part of the Claremont University Consortium. Notable benefits of being in the consortium include equal access to seven dining halls and 10 additional on-campus eateries, the fifth largest private library collection in California, interaction with over 7,000 students, access to programs such as Harvey Mudd&#x27;s Clinic Program and Claremont McKenna&#x27;s Semester in Washington (DC) program, and the opportunity to do a housing exchange with a student at another college. Most events sponsored by each school are open to students from all of the Claremont Colleges, including invited speakers and performers, employment and recruiting events, and social events.

=== Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum ===
The Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum hosts more than one hundred dinner and lecture events with speakers representing a range of disciplines and ideological perspectives each year, serving as the college&#x27;s central intellectual and social hub. The Athenaeum hosts speakers four nights a week, and also serves daily afternoon tea in its library, featuring chocolate-covered strawberries and pastries. Afternoon tea is free to students, faculty and staff. The Athenaeum has hosted such speakers as former President Bill Clinton, Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, authors Gore Vidal and Salman Rushdie, cybernetics expert Kevin Warwick, former Attorney General Janet Reno, filmmaker Spike Lee, environmentalist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., former Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Barak, &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist Thomas Friedman, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, U2 frontman and activist Bono, CNN journalist Anderson Cooper, former Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove, former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Maureen Dowd, Harvard Professor Danielle Allen, former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, retired U.S. Army General Stanley A. McChrystal and former governor of Massachusetts and 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

=== Housing ===

As a residential community, student life is centered on campus with 96% of students living on campus; four years of housing is guaranteed. Claremont&#x27;s dorms are divided into three regions: North Quad, Mid Quad, and South Quad. In addition, the student apartments sit on the East edge of campus, and are occupied primarily by seniors. All dorm rooms are attended to by housekeeping staff every week. North Quad is made up of Appleby, Boswell, Green and Wohlford Halls, which were the campus&#x27;s first dorms. In north quad, every room opens to the outdoors instead of opening to an interior hallway. North quad rooms are all doubles grouped into suites of four rooms that share a bathroom.

CMC&#x27;s Mid Quad is home to Beckett, Berger, Benson, Phillips, Crown, Marks and Claremont Halls, which feature long interior corridors, double and single rooms, large shared-bathroom facilities and all-dorm lounge areas. Berger, Claremont and Benson Halls are connected, and make up a larger building known on campus as BCB. As of 2022, Claremont Hall has been renamned to Valach Hall, therefore changing BCB into BVB.

The tallest buildings in Claremont are &quot;The Towers&quot;, Auen, Fawcett, and Stark Halls, which make up South Quad. Each tower has seven floors with approximately twelve students per floor. Each floor has a common area and a large shared bathroom, while there is also an all-dorm lounge area on the ground floor. Stark Hall, the newest of the South Quad dorms, is substance-free. Auen and Fawcett underwent complete interior renovations in the summer of 2008.

The Student Apartments lie to the east of the college&#x27;s athletic facilities and to the west of Claremont Boulevard. Each apartment is divided into four bedrooms and two bathrooms. Until recently, half the apartments were reserved for men and half for women, and apartments were allotted based on credits. In any given year, most of CMC&#x27;s 260–300 seniors can live in the apartments.

=== Student government ===
The Associated Students of Claremont McKenna College (ASCMC) is the official student government of Claremont McKenna College. ASCMC is composed of an executive board and a student senate. The executive board consists of both elected and appointed positions. It is chaired by the President, and meets weekly to discuss long-term projects and endeavors. Permanent committees led by members of executive board include the events team, the diversity &amp; inclusion committee, and the residential life committee. Additionally, each class president has a cabinet to carry out class programming. The Senate is chaired by the executive vice president of ASCMC, and is tasked with passing resolutions to influence institutional policy, funding student-led initiatives, and bringing in administrators and other college stakeholders for town hall discussions. Senate has four standing committees: administrative affairs &amp; appropriations (AAA), environmental affairs, campus improvements, and student engagement.

=== Affinity Groups ===
CMC has numerous identity-based clubs and organizations, including 1 Gen, for first generation college students), Asian Pacific American Mentors, Black Student Associations, ¡Mi Gente! (for Latinx students), Sexuality and Gender Alliance, Women&#x27;s Forum, and International Connect. These clubs and organizations host a variety of support programming and social events for students to participate in.

=== Student journalism ===

CMC attracts many students with an interest in journalism. Its student publications include the following:
* &quot;The Student Life&quot;: &quot;The Student Life&quot; (abbreviated &quot;TSL&quot;) was founded in 1889. It is the oldest college paper in Southern California and the largest media organization at the Claremont Colleges, and is generally regarded as the colleges&#x27; publication of record. It prints weekly on Fridays, featuring news, opinions, lifestyle articles, and sports coverage of all five undergraduate Claremont Colleges. It is jointly funded by the 5C student governments.
* &quot;The Golden Antlers&quot;: &quot;The Golden Antlers&quot; is a satirical and humorous campus publication founded in 2012. Although Claremont McKenna is its host, it is staffed by students from all five Claremont Colleges.
* &quot;The CMC Forum&quot;: The &quot;Forum&quot; is the oldest CMC-specific publication on campus. It features campus news, opinions, and lifestyle articles. Although originally a newspaper, the &quot;Forum&quot; is now solely an online news source.
* &quot;The Claremont Radius:&quot; The &quot;Claremont Radius&quot; is a student-founded, student-run, and student-intended online publication that aims to spark political discourse across campus by providing students of all political backgrounds the tools they need for effective debate and discussion on the big issues affecting our society. Founded in 2015, it seeks to provide bi-partisan coverage on issues it discusses.
* &quot;The Claremont Independent&quot;: The &quot;Independent&quot;, founded in 1996, is a magazine of conservative and libertarian writers that has frequently produced stories about the political culture of the Claremont Colleges that have been picked up by national conservative media outlets and drawn intense criticism from many students. It is funded entirely through private donations.

==Athletics==
Athletes from CMC compete alongside athletes from Harvey Mudd College and Scripps College as the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Stags and Athenas. The teams participate in NCAA Division III in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. The mascot for the men&#x27;s teams is Stanley the Stag, and the women&#x27;s teams are the Athenas. Their colors are cardinal and gold. In 2016, a new 144,000 square-foot recreation facility, named the Roberts Pavilion, was completed.

== Traditions ==
* All incoming freshmen participate in W.O.A!, or &quot;Welcome Orientation Adventure&quot; W.O.A! is a student-run pre-orientation program. Options have included backpacking, camping and rock-climbing at Yosemite, canoeing down the Colorado River and community service in Los Angeles. Each trip is led by current students. W.O.A.! allows incoming students to develop friendships and get a sense for the college community before the formal beginning of their college careers.
* The &quot;Madrigal Feast&quot; was an annual dinner held in the Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum. Both current students as well as alumni typically attended. Guests were treated to a medieval-themed feast, complete with wassail and a spirited musical performance put on by other students in medieval dress. This 26 year tradition was suspended in 2009.
* The Associated Students of Claremont McKenna College host a &quot;Monte Carlo&quot; night which doubles as the school&#x27;s homecoming dance. This tradition dates back to 1949.

Several of Claremont McKenna College&#x27;s traditions are water-related:
* At noon on the due dates of senior theses, the students turn in their theses to the registrar, after which they are given a bottle of champagne by the registrar. In recent years, the class president has provided the champagne. The students spend the remainder of the afternoon in the fountains at the school, drinking, singing, celebrating and enjoying the warm California sun.
*At midnight of a student&#x27;s birthday, their friends will throw them in the fountains in the center of campus while singing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;, a tradition known as &quot;ponding&quot;.

== The Consortium ==

All seven colleges are part of the Claremont University Consortium, also known as &quot;the 7 Cs&quot;. Together the campuses cover over and enroll over 6,000 students. In addition there are over 3,500 faculty and staff and more than 2,500 courses available. 
Student life revolves around the colleges as they interact socially and also share seven dining halls, four main libraries and other facilities spread throughout the campuses. Notable facilities include:
* Honnold/Mudd Library and the Libraries of the Claremont Colleges, the largest collection of any liberal arts college
* W.M. Keck Science Center
* Monsour Counseling Center
* Huntley Bookstore

Students attending Claremont McKenna can enroll in up to 2/3 of their classes at the other undergraduate colleges and can also major at any other college if the major is not offered at CMC. This is the general academic policy at the schools and is meant to give students the resources of a larger university while still maintaining the qualities of a small, liberal-arts college.

== Research institutes ==
CMC sponsors twelve different on-campus research institutes and centers. They seek to produce new research and publications while involving undergraduate students in rigorous academic work. 
* The Berger Institute for Individual and Social Development

== Fundraising ==

Claremont McKenna completed what was then the largest fundraising campaign ever initiated by a liberal arts college, raising $635 million, from 2008 - 2013. The campaign for Claremont McKenna fulfilled for commitments in five priorities:
* $110 million for students: need-based financial aid and merit scholarships, internships, research, speaker series and other experiences
* $110 million for faculty: chairs, research and new curricula
* $100 million for facilities: new buildings, renovations and master planning projects
* $200 million for the Robert Day Scholars Program
* $80 million for The Fund for CMC: operating costs

As part of the campaign, the college built the Kravis Center, an academic building that includes classrooms, faculty offices and research areas. The building, designed by Rafael Viñoly, was completed in 2011. It is named after 1967 alumnus Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts who donated $75 million for the building.

<doc id="853906" wikidata="Q7645940" url="?curid=853906" title="Surface warfare insignia">
<text>The surface warfare insignia is a military badge of the United States Navy which is issued to U.S. Navy personnel who are trained and qualified to perform duties aboard United States surface warships. There are presently four classes of the surface warfare pin, being that of line, staff, special operations, and enlisted. The line and enlisted surface warfare badges may be earned by United States Coast Guard personnel assigned to Navy commands. The various badge types are as follows:

==Surface warfare officer==

The surface warfare officer insignia is the first milestone qualification an eligible commissioned officer may receive in surface warfare. This device is commonly called the &quot;SWO pin&quot; in the U.S. Navy. Those receiving the pin must qualify as officer of the deck (both underway and in port), small boat officer, combat information center watch officer, and must be trained in shipboard engineering, naval history, and damage control. For further, enterprise-level training, officers will attend Surface Warfare Officers&#x27; School (SWOS) in Newport, Rhode Island between all sea tours. The surface warfare officer badge is typically a prerequisite for tactical action officer (TAO) training.

Junior officers, typically Ensigns, assigned to the surface warfare community are known as &quot;unqualified&quot; or &quot;1160s&quot; until they receive qualification as a Surface Warfare Officer and receive the SWO pin. Surface line personnel who are not yet qualified have the 1160 officer designator: once qualified they receive the 1110 designator for Regular Navy Officers and 1115 for Navy Reserve Officers. Prior to 2018, junior officers were granted 24 months to qualify as Surface Warfare Officers; failing to do so within the time period meant either separation from the service or applying to transfer to another warfare community. The collisions involving the USS &quot;John S. McCain&quot; (DDG-56) and the USS &quot;Fitzgerald&quot; (DDG-62) brought about a change in qualification standards. Unqualified junior officers now have no official time limit to qualify within the two and a half years of their first tour, and now must qualify solely before they transfer to their next command. Failing to qualify prevents the officer from transferring. Officers who are separated from the SWO community go through a process called &quot;Non-Attained&quot; and this designation is entered into the officer&#x27;s permanent military record.

The Surface Warfare Officer pin was designed to depict the traditional and typical elements of naval service: waves breaking before the bow of a ship overlaid on crossed U.S. Navy commissioned officer&#x27;s swords, rendered in gold. The insignia was introduced in 1975.

==Enlisted Surface Warfare Specialist (ESWS)==

On 1 December 1978, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral T.B. Hayward approved the enlisted surface warfare specialist (ESWS) qualification program. This approval followed immediately by the promulgation of OPNAV Instruction 1412.4, which provided the specific details of the program.

Since the introduction of the surface warfare officer (SWO) qualification program in 1975, a strong advocacy for a similar program for surface enlisted was started. The program was initiated in 1977 when the surface warfare commanders (DCNO Surface Warfare, COMNAVSURFLANT and COMNAVSURFPAC) gave their conceptual approval to the development of a surface enlisted qualification program.

Initial guidelines for the program at that time were:

# It was to reflect a level of qualification above and beyond the normal level of professional and performance criteria necessary for advancement. 
# The qualification was applicable to and reasonably attainable by all &quot;surface&quot; ratings.
# Qualification was an attainable goal for dedicated enlisted serving on ships and afloat staffs.
# Management of the program would not become an administrative burden on the ship.
# Qualification criteria would be well defined and specific.
# Participation was voluntary, and there was neither a financial reward nor hazardous duty associated with the qualification.

The silver cutlass was available for the first time in April 1979.

Specifically the criteria in 1979 to qualify was as follows:

# Be a petty officer
# Have 24 months on a surface ship
# Have a performance mark and leadership marks of top 30% for CPO&#x27;s and 3.4 for petty officers.
# Complete the PQS for damage control, damage control petty officer, repair party leader, and work center supervisor.
# Qualify in all watch stations for rating and pay grade.
# Perform an oral board held by the commanding officer, executive officer or lieutenant commander.
# Be recommended by the chain of command, and approved by the commanding officer.

OPNAVINST 1414.9 is the Navy instruction that governs the enlisted warfare qualification programs. This instruction also cancels OPNAVINST 1414.2A.

The ESWS pin is authorized for wear by any enlisted member of the United States Navy who is permanently stationed aboard a navy afloat command and completes the enlisted surface warfare qualification program and personal qualification standards (PQS). The ESWS badge can be obtained at any time after reporting to a ship. If in the paygrade of E-5 (petty officer 2nd class), it is a requirement for advancement to E-6 (petty officer 1st class). It is extremely uncommon for sailors in paygrade E-3 and below to earn their ESWS pin but strongly encouraged to stand among their peers for promotion. Sailors for whom ESWS is their secondary community (mostly those in the air warfare community) are not required to re-qualify.

An enlisted person who has qualified for his or her ESWS pin places the designator SW after his or her rate and rating; for example, Cryptologic Technician (Collection) Petty Officer Second Class Yefremov, having qualified for his ESWS pin, is identified as CTR2(SW) Yefremov.

For those enlisted personnel who are subsequently commissioned as officers and are shipboard SWO&#x27;s, the ESWS badge is replaced, but only after they have fully completed their Surface Warfare Officer qualifications. 

Features of the Pin

Unlike other warfare pins available to both enlisted and officers, the ESWS and SWO pins differ by more than just color (gold for officers and silver for enlisted is a common theme in U.S. Navy uniforms). The blade weapons behind the hull on the SWO pin are swords. The blade weapons on the enlisted pin are cutlasses. This can clearly be seen in the curvature of the blades and the shape of the handguards. This derives from the sword being a symbol of naval officers and their authority, while cutlasses were traditionally issued for battle to enlisted sailors during the age of sail. The ship that is featured in the middle of the pin is that of a “modern warship” of when the pin came out in 1978 and looks as if it’s a Knox Class Frigate. 

The ESWS is tall and wide.

=== Updated ESWS requirements as of November 2020 ===
The new instruction will do away with the requirement for all first-tour Sailors to walk away from their first sea-duty command with their ESWS qualification. Sailors will not be required to enroll in a command’s ESWS program until they reach a journeyman or master-level (E-5 - E-9). These Sailors will be enrolled in their ESWS program after 12 months onboard, or at the commanding officer’s discretion, and from there will have 18 months to qualify in ESWS. 

In attempts to improve damage control and ship survivability, the updated program will add more prerequisite PQS, including the following:

* Damage Control 301-312.
* Damage Control Watches 301, Sounding and Security.
* Ship’s Maintenance and Material Management (3-M) Systems 301-303.

==Medical corps officer==

==Dental corps officer==

Surface warfare dental corps insignia: A gold metal pin, with a spread oak leaf, a silver acorn on each side of the stem on two crossed swords, on a background of ocean swells.

==Medical service corps officer==

Surface warfare medical service corps insignia: A gold metal pin, with a spread oak leaf, attached to a slanting twig on two crossed swords, on a background of ocean swells.

==Supply corps officer==

The surface warfare supply corps insignia is granted to those members of the Navy Supply Corps who qualify as surface warfare supply officers. Such officers are trained in shipboard supply systems, food service, housing and welfare service, disbursing operations, damage control, and basics of the ship&#x27;s engineering systems. Post 2018 and the McCain and Fitzgerald Crashes, SWSCO candidates and qualified officer do not stand Officer of the Deck (OOD) Underway. Depending on the ship type they will receive training in shipboard flight operations as the Helicopter Control Officer.

For advancement in the surface supply community, the Surface Warfare Supply Corps Officer Pin (SWSCO) must be obtained by junior supply officers within 18 months from reporting on board a naval vessel. Those failing to qualify as a surface supply officer are transferred to permanent ground assignment as shore supply officers.

Other versions of the supply corps pin include the Naval Aviation Supply Corps insignia, the Submarine Supply Corps insignia and the Navy Expeditionary Supply Corps insignia.

==Surface chaplain officer==

The Surface Chaplain Officer Qualification Insignia is a newly introduced warfare pin for members of the surface chaplain corps. The qualification insignia started being awarded to qualified chaplains in 2023 after being approved by the Navy Uniform Board.
==Coast Guard==

The United States Coast Guard does not issue the surface warfare pin. The comparable Coast Guard insignia is the cutterman insignia. The cutterman insignia is awarded on a temporary basis upon completion of a PQS and is made permanent upon accumulation of five years sea time. 

Coast Guard personnel who are permanently cross-assigned to afloat Navy commands may qualify for the surface warfare badge through the standard Navy qualification system. 
==NOAA Commissioned Corps==

The NOAA Commissioned Corps deck officer pin is a gold-colored pin displaying breaking waves, with a central device consisting of a fouled anchor surcharged with a NOAA Corps device. NOAA Corps officers certified as senior watch officer may wear the NOAA deck officer insignia after authorization by the Director of the NOAA Corps.

<doc id="853925" wikidata="Q1368838" url="?curid=853925" title="Randy Kraft">
<text>Randy Steven Kraft (born March 19, 1945) is an American serial killer and rapist known as the Scorecard Killer, the Southern California Strangler, and the Freeway Killer, who committed the rape, torture, and murder of a minimum of sixteen young men between 1972 and 1983, the majority of whom he killed in California. Kraft is also believed to have committed the rape and murder of up to fifty-one other young men and boys. He was convicted in May 1989 and is currently incarcerated on death row at San Quentin State Prison in Marin County, California.

Kraft became known as the &quot;Scorecard Killer&quot; because upon his arrest, investigators discovered a coded list with sixty-one entries on a scorecard containing cryptic references to his victims; he is also sometimes referred to as the &quot;Freeway Killer&quot; because many of his victims&#x27; bodies were discovered beside or near freeways.

==Early life==

=== Childhood ===
Randy Kraft was born in Long Beach, California, on March 19, 1945, the fourth child and only son of Opal Lee (née Beal) and Harold Herbert Kraft. Kraft&#x27;s father had moved to California from Wyoming weeks after the United States&#x27; entry into World War II. Upon finding employment as a production operative at Douglas Aircraft Company, he was joined by his wife and three daughters.

The Kraft family lived modestly, and Kraft&#x27;s mother took several jobs to supplement her husband&#x27;s assembly-line salary. Kraft&#x27;s mother initially found employment as a seamstress in a Westminster garment factory before later obtaining employment as a cook in a local school. Nonetheless, Opal Kraft always found time for her children; in contrast, Kraft&#x27;s father seldom attended any social gatherings with them and was later described as being &quot;distanced&quot; from his family. As a child, Kraft was doted on by his three older sisters and mother, although he was known to be accident-prone.

In 1948, the Kraft family moved from Long Beach to Midway City in neighboring Orange County. Their home was a small, wood-frame Women&#x27;s Army Corps dormitory on Beach Boulevard that Kraft&#x27;s father renovated into a three-bedroom house. The family became active in the Westminster First Presbyterian Church, with Kraft&#x27;s mother rising to the chairman of the deacons committee.

In Midway City, Kraft attended Midway City Elementary school, where his mother was a member of the PTA. His intelligence was noted by classmates and teachers and by 1957, Kraft was judged intelligent enough to attend accelerated classes at 17th Street Junior High School.

===Adolescence and graduation===
By adolescence, Kraft had taken a keen interest in politics, becoming a staunch Republican and aspiring to become a U.S. senator. Shortly after his enrollment at Westminster High School, he and two close friends founded the Westminster World Affairs Club. At Westminster High, Kraft was again regarded as a pleasant, bright student who regularly achieved A grades. He was also known to occasionally date girls, although some classmates and teachers later stated that they suspected Kraft was homosexual.

Kraft later stated he had known from his high school days that he was homosexual, although he initially kept his sexual orientation a secret. On June 13, 1963, he graduated tenth in his class of 390 students. That fall, he enrolled at Claremont Men&#x27;s College in Claremont, California, where he pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.

==Claremont Men&#x27;s College==
Shortly after his enrollment at Claremont, Kraft enrolled in the Reserve Officers Training Corps and regularly attended demonstrations in support of the Vietnam War and—in 1964—campaign rallies for Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. He later declared these actions were merely a simulation of his parents&#x27; political views and not his own, describing his second year at Claremont as being when he abandoned the &quot;last gasp&quot; of his conservative ideology. The same year, Kraft entered his first known homosexual relationship.

In 1964, Kraft began working as a bartender at a local Garden Grove cocktail lounge that catered to gay clientele; he was also known to regularly travel to Laguna Beach and Huntington Beach to have casual sex with hustlers. In an apparent tentative effort to reveal his sexual orientation to his parents, Kraft took a succession of male &quot;friends&quot; to meet his family during his years at Claremont. Initially, Kraft&#x27;s parents and sisters were oblivious to his homosexuality.

In 1966, Kraft was arrested and charged with lewd conduct after propositioning an undercover police officer in Huntington Beach; as he had no previous criminal record, no charges were filed. The following year, he developed a radical shift in his political beliefs, becoming an ardent supporter of liberal views and eventually registered as a Democrat in 1967. Kraft quickly became a Democratic Party organizer, campaigning tirelessly for the election of Robert F. Kennedy and receiving a personal letter from the senator thanking him for his efforts.

By his senior year, Kraft had become a lackadaisical student, drinking, taking drugs, and regularly attending all-night gambling and poker sessions with other students. The lack of commitment to his studies in his final year resulted in Kraft&#x27;s failing to graduate from Claremont in June 1967 and being forced to repeat his econometrics class, which postponed his graduation by eight months. In February 1968, Kraft graduated from Claremont Men&#x27;s College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.

==U.S. Air Force==
Four months after graduating from college, Kraft joined the United States Air Force. He was sent to basic training in Texas before being stationed at Edwards Air Force Base in southern California, where he supervised the painting of test planes. During his service in the Air Force, Kraft rose to the rank of Airman First Class and supervisor-manager.
The same year that Kraft became an Airman First Class, he came out to his family. In a letter he wrote to a friend, Kraft described his father as having flown &quot;into a rage,&quot; whereas he described his mother as being more understanding, if somewhat disapproving. Kraft&#x27;s family ultimately accepted his sexuality, and he remained in close contact with his parents and siblings, although his siblings noted he began to &quot;distance himself&quot; from his family after he had disclosed his sexuality to them.

On July 26, 1969, Kraft announced his sexual orientation to his superiors. He was then granted a general discharge after only 13 months of service. His dismissal was officially listed as being on &quot;medical&quot; grounds. In response, Kraft sought legal advice from an attorney to challenge the grounds regarding his discharge. The Air Force, however, refused to change the status of his discharge. Following his discharge, Kraft moved back into his parents&#x27; home and obtained work as a bartender.

===First known sexual assault===
In March 1970, Kraft encountered a 13-year-old Westminster youth named Joseph Alvin Fancher at Huntington Beach. Fancher explained to Kraft that he had run away from home that day. Kraft invited the youth to his apartment, promising that Fancher could live with him and offering him sex with a woman he claimed to know. Fancher agreed and accompanied Kraft to his Belmont Shore apartment, where he was drugged, beaten, and repeatedly sexually assaulted. Hours later, Fancher escaped from the apartment after Kraft left to go to work. A member of the public, alarmed by Fancher&#x27;s drugged and disheveled condition, called an ambulance. Fancher&#x27;s stomach needed to be pumped.

At the hospital, Fancher informed police that Kraft had given him drugs and beaten him. He did not disclose to either his parents or the police that he had been sexually assaulted due to shame and fearing no one would believe him. A search of Kraft&#x27;s apartment was conducted with the cooperation of his roommate. However, as Fancher had confessed to police he had taken the pills offered to him voluntarily and the officers had searched without a warrant, no charges were filed.

===Enrollment at Long Beach State University===
In 1971, Kraft found new employment as a forklift driver in Huntington Beach. After his military discharge two years earlier, he enrolled at Long Beach State University, majoring in education to further his career prospects. There, Kraft became acquainted with Jeff Graves, a fellow teaching student from Minnesota four years younger than Kraft, with whom he began a relationship.

==Murders==
Between 1971 and 1983, Kraft is believed to have killed 67 people. All of his suspected victims were males between the ages of 13 and 35, the majority of whom were in their late teens to mid-twenties. Kraft was charged with—and convicted of—sixteen of these homicides, all of which had occurred between 1972 and 1983. Many of his victims were members of the United States Marines Corps, and most of their bodies were found to have high levels of both alcohol and tranquilizers, indicating they had been unconscious when they were abused and killed.
Kraft&#x27;s victims were typically lured into his vehicle with an offer of a lift or alcohol. The victims would be plied with alcohol and/or other drugs. They were then bound, tortured, and sexually abused before they were killed, usually by either strangulation, asphyxiation, or bludgeoning. However, some victims had also ingested lethal doses of pharmaceuticals. At least one victim was stabbed to death. The victims would then be discarded, usually—though not exclusively—alongside or close to various freeways in southern California. Photographic evidence found at Kraft&#x27;s home indicates several of his victims were driven to his house before their murder.
Many of the victims were burned with a car cigarette lighter, usually around the genitals, chest, and face, and several were found with extensive blunt force trauma to the face and head. In several instances, foreign objects were found inserted into the victims&#x27; rectums, while other victims had suffered emasculation, or mutilation and dismemberment.

The majority of Kraft&#x27;s murders were committed in California, although some victims had been killed in Oregon, with two further known victims murdered in Michigan in December 1982.

===First suspected murder victim===
On October 5, 1971, police found the nude body of a 30-year-old Long Beach resident named Wayne Joseph Dukette discarded close to the Ortega Highway. Dukette, a bartender at a gay bar named The Stable in nearby Sunset Beach, had last been seen alive on September 20. Putrefaction had destroyed any signs of foul play on the body. The cause of death was listed as acute alcohol poisoning due to a high blood alcohol level. The first entry in Kraft&#x27;s journal (referred to as his &quot;scorecard&quot;) reads &quot;Stable,&quot; leading investigators to believe Dukette was Kraft&#x27;s first murder victim.

===Subsequent murders===
Fifteen months after the murder of Dukette, Kraft killed a 20-year-old Marine named Edward Daniel Moore. Moore was last seen leaving the barracks at Camp Pendleton on December24, 1972. His body was found beside the 405 Freeway in Seal Beach during the early hours of December26. Abrasions on Moore&#x27;s body indicated he had been pushed from a moving vehicle. An autopsy revealed he had been bound at the wrists and ankles, then beaten with a blunt instrument about the face before being garroted. His body also exhibited numerous bite marks, and a sock had been forced into his rectum.

Six weeks after the murder of Moore, on February 6, 1973, the body of an unidentified male, estimated to be between 17 and 25 years old, was found alongside the Terminal Island Freeway in Wilmington. This victim had been strangled with a ligature and also had a sock inserted in his rectum. Two months later, on April 14, the body of 17-year-old Kevin Clark Bailey was found beside a road in Huntington Beach. Bailey had been emasculated and sodomized prior to his murder. By July 28, a further two victims had been murdered: an unidentified youth whose dismembered body was found in Wilmington on April 22, and a 20-year-old named Ronnie Gene Wiebe, whose strangled body was discarded beside an on-ramp of the 405 Freeway on July 30, two days after he had disappeared.

Kraft is known to have killed at least once more in 1973. The victim was a 23-year-old bisexual art student named Vincent Cruz Mestas, whose body was found in the San Bernardino Mountains on December29. As with several previous victims, one of the victim&#x27;s socks had been forced into his rectum. Mestas&#x27; hands had been severed from his body and were never found.

By November 1974, five more victims had been found beside or close to major roadways in southern California, three of whom had been conclusively linked to the same killer. Two of these victims—20-year-old Malcolm Eugene Little and 19-year-old James Dale Reeves—had each been found beside a freeway with foreign objects inserted into their bodies, whereas the body of the third victim, 18-year-old Marine Roger Edward Dickerson, bore evidence of bite marks much like several earlier victims.

===1975===
On January 3, 1975, Kraft abducted and murdered a 17-year-old high school student named John William Leras. The youth was last seen boarding a bus in Long Beach; his strangled body was found the following day, discarded at Sunset Beach with a foreign object protruding from his anus. Drag marks along the beach close to where his body was found suggested that two individuals had carried Leras&#x27;s body into the water. Two weeks after this murder, on January 17, the body of a 21-year-old named Craig Jonaitis was found discarded in the parking lot of the Golden Sails Hotel near the Pacific Coast Highway and Loynes Drive in Long Beach. Jonaitis had been strangled to death with a length of string, possibly a shoelace.

===Investigation===
By January 1975, a total of fourteen victims had been linked to the same killer, their bodies having been found discarded across four separate counties over the previous three years. All the victims had been Caucasian males with similar physical characteristics. On January 24, homicide investigators from several jurisdictions in southern California convened in Orange County to discuss their progress in the hunt for the unknown killer. An FBI profile of the killer was read to investigators, describing the individual as a methodical, organized lust killer of above-average intelligence who exhibited an indifference to the &quot;interests and welfare of society.&quot; 

Some investigators believed the murders to be the work of more than one individual, one or more of whom had a military background, as two victims had paper tissue residue in their nostrils, a procedure known to be used in the military to prevent bodies from purging after death. The insertion of socks inside the victims&#x27; rectums was also theorized to have been intended to prevent purging as the body was driven to the disposal location. At this stage, investigators had no solid suspects.

===Murder of Keith Crotwell===
On the evening of March 29, 1975, Kraft lured two youths, Keith Crotwell and Kent May, from a Long Beach parking lot into his Ford Mustang. The youths were given beer and Valium as Kraft drove in a random, aimless manner around Belmont Shore and Seal Beach. May later recalled feeling catatonic as a result of the Valium and alcohol he had ingested before he passed out.

In the parking lot where Crotwell and May had last been seen, two friends of the youths observed a distinctive black-and-white Mustang pull in and stop before the driver leaned across, opened the passenger door, and pushed the unconscious (but otherwise unharmed) May out onto the pavement. The driver then sped away from the scene. As he did so, the friends noted Crotwell slumped against the unknown driver&#x27;s shoulder.

On May 8, Crotwell&#x27;s skull was found on a jetty close to the Long Beach Marina; the remainder of his body was found six months later. After hearing the news, the two friends of Crotwell and May—who suspected that the murderer was a patron of a Belmont Shore gay bar—searched their neighborhood for the distinctive Mustang. They found the car less than a mile (1.6 km) from their home, wrote down the license plate number, and gave the information to the police. The vehicle was registered to Randy Kraft.

===Interrogation and release===
Long Beach police questioned Kraft about Crotwell&#x27;s abduction and murder on May 19, 1975. Initially, he denied having ever met either Crotwell or May, and the police, skeptical of Kraft&#x27;s denial, summoned him to the police station for further questioning. Kraft admitted that on or about March 29, he had encountered two youths in the Long Beach parking lot in question and persuaded them to drink alcohol and consume Valium with him as he drove. He claimed to have returned May to the parking lot and then to have driven with Crotwell to a side road close to the El Toro offramp, where his car subsequently became embedded upon an embankment. He claimed to have walked alone to a gas station to call a tow truck while Crotwell remained with the car. Upon returning to his vehicle, Kraft claimed, Crotwell had disappeared.

Although Kraft&#x27;s roommate confirmed that Kraft had phoned him on the date of Crotwell&#x27;s disappearance, claiming that his vehicle was stuck on an embankment, detectives remained unconvinced by Kraft&#x27;s version of events. The following week, two detectives attempted to file homicide charges against Kraft. However, the Los Angeles District Attorney&#x27;s Office declined, citing the coroner&#x27;s conclusion from his autopsy of the remains thus far found (consisting only of Crotwell&#x27;s skull) that the youth had died of accidental drowning.

Perhaps because he had been questioned as a suspect in Crotwell&#x27;s murder and because of additional turmoil in his personal life in the summer of 1975, Kraft is not known to have killed again until December 31, when he abducted 22-year-old Mark Hall in San Juan Capistrano. In this instance, later described by prosecutors as &quot;the worst&quot; of all of Kraft&#x27;s known murders, Hall was driven to a remote canyon, where he was bound to a tree. The autopsy report listed the cause of death as asphyxiation caused by leaves and earth found lodged deep in Hall&#x27;s trachea. The autopsy also revealed that Hall had been sodomized and emasculated, with his severed genitals inserted into his rectum. Additionally, his chest, scrotum, nose, and cheeks had been burned with an automobile cigarette lighter, which was also used to destroy his eyes. The autopsy report also listed numerous incisions on Hall&#x27;s legs which had been inflicted with a broken bottle. Forensic experts were able to determine that Hall had been alive throughout much of the ordeal.

==Relationship with Jeff Seelig==
By 1976, Kraft had ended his relationship with Graves. Shortly thereafter, he began a relationship with a 19-year-old apprentice baker named Jeff Seelig, and the couple moved to Laguna Hills. Although neither man was inclined towards monogamy, the couple considered their relationship permanent. Seelig later told investigators that he and Kraft regularly picked up and propositioned hitchhikers who, if willing, would accompany them to their apartment for a threesome. However, Seelig was adamant that Kraft had never been violent towards him and had never seen him display violent tendencies.

Kraft&#x27;s relationship with Seelig is believed to be a contributory factor in the sudden lull in murders he is known to have committed. He is not known to have killed again until December 10, 1976. The body of the victim, 19-year-old Paul Joseph Fuchs, has never been found. Nonetheless, Fuchs&#x27; name is clearly listed upon Kraft&#x27;s scorecard, and he was last seen outside a Long Beach gay bar named &quot;Ripples&quot;, which Kraft is known to have frequented.

===Resurfacing of the Freeway Killer===
Following the December 1976 murder of Fuchs, Kraft is not known to have killed again for sixteen months. On January 3, 1978, homicide investigators again convened to discuss progress concerning the manhunt for the still-unidentified killer. By this time, investigators knew there was more than one murderer at large: the previous July, police had arrested Patrick Kearney, who subsequently confessed to the murders of 28 boys and young men, many of whom he had dissected and discarded in trash bags beside freeways in southern California. Although Kraft had dismembered some of his victims, he never killed his victims by shooting them in the temple as Kearney had. Additionally, Kearney had never tortured any of his victims: his &quot;modus operandi&quot; differed significantly from Kraft&#x27;s, and investigators were certain that an unrelated killer was still at large.

On April 16, 1978, Kraft abducted an 18-year-old Marine named Scott Michael Hughes. Hughes was plied with Valium before Kraft slit open his scrotum and removed one of his testicles, then strangled him to death with a ligature before discarding his fully clothed body—missing only his shoelaces—beside a freeway on-ramp in Anaheim. Two months later, on June 11, the body of 23-year-old Roland Gerald Young was found near a San Diego freeway. Young had been emasculated before being stabbed to death. Abrasions to his body indicated that he had been pushed from a vehicle traveling at high speed. Eight days later, the body of a 20-year-old Marine named Richard Allen Keith was found discarded beside a road on Moulton Parkway. He had last been seen alive by his girlfriend in the city of Carson. Welts on Keith&#x27;s wrists indicated that he had been bound before he was strangled with a ligature. Froth in his throat indicated that he was also drowning as a result of flurazepam and alcohol he had consumed at the time he was strangled. Keith is believed to be referred to on Kraft&#x27;s scorecard as &quot;Marine Carson.&quot;

Three weeks after the murder of Keith, on July 6, Kraft killed a 23-year-old hitchhiker named Keith Arthur Klingbeil. Klingbeil had ingested large doses of acetaminophen and alcohol before he was strangled with his shoelace and his body discarded beside the Interstate 5 freeway. Although Klingbeil was still alive when discovered, he would die shortly after his admission to Mission Community Hospital. A subsequent autopsy revealed that, before Klingbeil&#x27;s strangulation, his left nipple had been seared with a car cigarette lighter.

Two months later, on September 29, the body of 20-year-old Richard Anthony Crosby was found discarded 200 yards north of Highway 71 in San Bernardino. Crosby had disappeared the previous day as he hitchhiked home from a theater in Torrance. He had been suffocated, and his left nipple had been mutilated with an automobile cigarette lighter.

The last known victim murdered by Kraft in 1978 was a 21-year-old Long Beach truck driver named Michael Joseph Inderbieten, whose castrated body was found along an on-ramp to the I-605 on November 18, 1978. In addition to having been castrated, Inderbieten had been violated with a foreign object and had suffered burns similar to those inflicted on victim Mark Hall two years previously. The cause of death was listed as suffocation.

==Later murders==
Kraft is not known to have killed again until June 16, 1979, when he abducted a 20-year-old Marine named Donnie Harold Crisel, whose body was thrown from a moving vehicle onto the 405 Freeway. The cause of death was listed as acute alcohol poisoning, although rope and burn marks indicated Crisel had been bound and tortured prior to his body being discarded.

Two months later, on August 29, the dismembered remains of a 21-year-old English tourist named Keith Anthony Jackson were found discarded in two trash bags and a cardboard box behind a Union 76 gas station in Long Beach. A sock was found inserted in his rectum. Only Jackson&#x27;s head, torso and left leg were ever found. Jackson had been deceased for several days prior to the discovery of his body. The entry on Kraft&#x27;s scorecard simply reading either &quot;England&quot; or &quot;76&quot; is believed to refer to him. Two weeks later, on September 14, the body of 19-year-old Gregory Wallace Jolley was found in Lake Arrowhead. Jolley had been emasculated and his head and legs had been severed after death. His possessions were later found in Kraft&#x27;s home.

On November 24, 1979, a 15-year-old Santa Ana youth named Jeffrey Sayre is believed to have been abducted and murdered by Kraft. Sayre was last seen at a bus stop in Westminster while returning home from a date with his girlfriend. The bus stop Sayre was last seen at was near the home of Kraft&#x27;s parents. The entry &quot;Westminster Date&quot; on Kraft&#x27;s scorecard is believed to refer to Sayre. On February 18, 1980, the decapitated body of a 19-year-old Marine named Mark Alan Marsh was found near the Templin Highway. Marsh was last seen hitchhiking towards Buena Park. His hands had been severed from his body after death.

===Portland murders===
In the summer of 1980, Kraft traveled to the neighboring state of Oregon on an extended business trip. During this trip, he lived in a town close to Portland. Before returning to California in August, he is believed to have murdered two more victims—both of whom were listed on his scorecard with cryptic references, including the word &quot;Portland.&quot;

The first victim, a 17-year-old Denver youth named Michael Sean O&#x27;Fallon, was killed on July 17. O&#x27;Fallon had been on a solo hitchhiking trip across the U.S. and Canada before his enrollment at college at the time of his murder. He had consumed both alcohol and Valium before he was strangled to death. O&#x27;Fallon&#x27;s nude, hogtied body was discarded ten miles south of Salem. O&#x27;Fallon was listed on Kraft&#x27;s scorecard as &quot;Portland Denver&quot;, and his camera—inscribed with his mother&#x27;s initials—was later found in Kraft&#x27;s garage. The following day, Kraft is believed to have killed a man estimated to be aged between 35 and 45 years old whose body was found beside a freeway in the city of Woodburn. This victim—listed as &quot;Portland Elk&quot; on Kraft&#x27;s scorecard—had ingested a toxic level of Valium and Tylenol before he was strangled to death with a ligature.
On September 3, 1980, one month after Kraft&#x27;s return to California from Oregon, the bound body of a 19-year-old Marine named Robert Loggins was found discarded in a trash bag close to the El Toro Marine air base. Loggins had last been seen alive by two fellow Marines close to the Pacific Coast Highway on August 23. Photographs—and the negatives—subsequently found in Kraft&#x27;s possession show Loggins in Kraft&#x27;s living room slumped fully clothed on his sofa, apparently intoxicated, and in various nude, pornographic postures. All these pictures depict Loggins with his eyes closed; it is unknown whether the victim was alive or dead when they were taken.

On April 10, 1981, the body of a 17-year-old youth named Michael Cluck was found beside the Interstate 5 freeway close to Goshen, Oregon. Cluck had been abducted while hitchhiking from Kent, Washington, to Bakersfield, California, the day prior to his body being discovered. Thirty-one blunt-force blows to the head had destroyed the back of his skull, killing the youth. Cluck had also been sodomized and savagely beaten, kicked, and scoured. Cluck is believed to have been recorded on Kraft&#x27;s scorecard as &quot;Portland Blood&quot; due to the extensive blood and debris found at the murder scene. At the time of the murder, Kraft had once again been sent on assignment to Oregon by his employers. In addition, on the day Cluck&#x27;s body was discovered, Kraft visited a Lane County hospital to receive treatment for a bruised foot.

Four months after Cluck&#x27;s murder, on August 20, 1981, the partially clothed body of 17-year-old male prostitute Christopher Allen Williams was found in the San Bernardino Mountains. Williams had ingested both phenobarbital and benzodiazepine, and was found with tissue paper lodged deep in his nostrils, causing him to choke to death on his own mucus.

===Echo Park murders===
By early 1982, the relationship between Kraft and Seelig had become marred by frequent fights and episodes of temporary separation. In an effort to resolve their personal differences, the couple began attending weekly counseling sessions in Huntington Beach. These sessions began on June 22, 1982.

Following complaints from residents of Echo Park regarding a foul odor emanating from the direction of the Hollywood Freeway on July 29, 1982, a Cal Trans employee found the decaying body of a 14-year-old Pittsburg, California youth named Raymond Davis discarded alongside the Rampart Boulevard offramp. Rudimentary efforts had been made to conceal Davis&#x27;s body beneath leaves and soil. He had last been seen alive in Echo Park on June 17, searching for his missing dog. The youth&#x27;s wrists had been knotted behind his back in much the same manner as had victim Michael O&#x27;Fallon two years previously, and he had been strangled to death with his shoelace. The entry on Kraft&#x27;s scorecard reading &quot;Dog&quot; is believed to refer to Davis. Just forty feet from Davis&#x27;s body, the same Cal Trans crew also found the body of 16-year-old Robert Avila. Avila had been missing since July 21, and his body was also markedly decomposed. He had been strangled to death with a length of stereo speaker wire.

Kraft is not known to have killed again until November 1, 1982, when he abducted and murdered a 24-year-old Modesto man named Arne Mikeal Laine. Laine was last seen hitchhiking towards Orange County in search of work. His body was not found until January 1984, discarded on a hillside close to the town of Ramona. Four weeks after Laine&#x27;s murder, the semi-nude body of 26-year-old Brian Whitcher was dumped from a moving vehicle alongside the Interstate 5 freeway, close to the city of Wilsonville, Oregon. Whitcher had ingested high levels of both alcohol and Valium, but he died of asphyxiation.

On December 3, 1982, a 29-year-old carpenter named Anthony Jose Silveira disappeared while hitchhiking towards Medford. His body was found two weeks later, strangled, sodomized, and violated with foreign objects before his murder. At the time of the murders of both Whitcher and Silveira, Kraft was again known to have been in Oregon on a business trip, which concluded the day of Silveira&#x27;s death. On December 4, Kraft drove from Portland to Seattle to visit friends. During this brief visit, he was observed wearing a military jacket inscribed with the name &quot;Silveira&quot;. On December 5, Kraft flew from Seattle to Grand Rapids, Michigan—again on business.

===Grand Rapids and return to Portland===
Two days after his arrival in Grand Rapids, Kraft encountered cousins Dennis Alt and Christopher Schoenborn at a seminar in the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel. Kraft was seen talking with the pair in the hotel&#x27;s reception area shortly before midnight. Their bodies were discovered on December 9 in an open field close to the hotel. Both victims had been plied with alcohol and Valium before their sodomy and murder, and the bodies had been arranged in sexually suggestive positions. Alt, aged 24, had died of asphyxiation, whereas Schoenborn, aged 20, had been strangled to death with his belt. In addition, a ballpoint pen had been inserted into Schoenborn&#x27;s urethra before his murder. Both victims were recorded upon Kraft&#x27;s scorecard in a single entry reading &quot;GR2&quot;. A set of keys belonging to Schoenborn, plus Silveira&#x27;s military jacket, were left by Kraft in the hotel.

On December 8, Kraft traveled from Michigan to Portland. Within twenty-four hours of his return to Oregon, he had killed a 19-year-old hitchhiker named Lance Taggs. Taggs had last been seen hitchhiking from the city of Tigard to the home of a relative in Los Angeles on December 8. His body was discovered the following day, discarded alongside a rural road in Clackamas County, close to where the body of Whitcher had been found just two weeks earlier. As with Alt and Schoenborn, Taggs had consumed alcohol and Valium before his murder, although Taggs had died of suffocation caused by a sock thrust into his trachea.

===Connection of Oregon murders to manhunt===
Noting the passage of time between periods of activity when bodies of young males had been found discarded near mass transportation with alcohol and/or pharmaceuticals in their bloodstream in Oregon, investigators theorized that their killer resided in another state and struck in Oregon only when there on business. Following the murders of Silveira, Whitcher, and Taggs, Oregon investigators relayed details of the murders to police in other states, describing the &quot;modus operandi&quot; of the killer they were seeking and requesting feedback from any police force that had unsolved murders of young males on their files with similar characteristics. A response from southern California counties was swift: the pattern of killings was identical to victims linked to the unknown killer in California. The six Oregon murders committed by Kraft were thus linked to the murders he had committed in California.

==1983==
Kraft did not kill again until January 27, 1983, when he abducted a 21-year-old hitchhiker named Eric Church. The victim was last seen alive hitchhiking from Orange County to Sacramento the day before his murder. His body was found discarded alongside I-605. An autopsy concluded Church had consumed high levels of alcohol and Valium and that he had been sodomized. Rope marks on Church&#x27;s wrists indicated he had struggled against his restraints before he died of a combination of ligature strangulation and numerous blows to the side of his skull inflicted by a blunt instrument.
On February 12, Kraft killed two Buena Park men: 18-year-old Geoffrey Nelson and 20-year-old Rodger DeVaul. The two young men were last seen outside the house of a friend named Bryce Wilson shortly after midnight when they told Wilson they intended to purchase something to eat. Nelson&#x27;s nude body was found alongside an offramp close to the Garden Grove Freeway several hours after he and DeVaul were last seen. He had been emasculated, strangled, and thrown from a moving vehicle. DeVaul&#x27;s body was found the following day, discarded down a mountainside close to Mount Baldy in San Bernardino County. He had been bound, sodomized, and strangled with a cord. As had been the case with Nelson, DeVaul had ingested both alcohol and propranolol before his murder. In addition, the stomachs of both victims contained potato skins and grapes, which had been eaten shortly before their murders.

===Final murder and arrest===
At 1:10 a.m. on May 14, 1983, two California Highway Patrol officers observed a Toyota Celica driving erratically on Interstate 5 in the Orange County community of Mission Viejo. Observing the vehicle perform an illegal lane change, the officers—suspecting the motorist was driving under the influence—signaled for the vehicle to stop. The driver slowed the vehicle to a halt and exited the car, discarding the contents of a beer bottle onto the pavement as he did so. Officer Michael Sterling met the individual, who identified himself as Randy Kraft, at the front of his patrol car and observed that his jeans were unbuttoned. Sterling had Kraft perform a field sobriety test, which he failed. He then arrested Kraft for driving while intoxicated.

Sterling&#x27;s partner, Sgt. Michael Howard approached the Celica and observed a young man slumped with his eyes closed in the vehicle&#x27;s passenger seat, partially covered by a jacket. Several empty Moosehead beer bottles and an open prescription bottle of Lorazepam tablets were strewn around his feet. Howard attempted to wake the man. Receiving no response, Howard attempted to rouse the man by shaking his arm, only to note the individual had a low body temperature. Upon checking for a pulse, Howard noted the man was dead, with a ligature mark visible around his neck. Lifting the jacket from the victim&#x27;s lap, Howard noted the victim&#x27;s jeans had been opened to expose his genitalia. In addition, the victim&#x27;s hands had been bound with a shoelace, and his wrists bore evidence of welt marks. Later identified as Terry Lee Gambrel, a 25-year-old Marine stationed at El Toro air base, the victim had been strangled to death.

==Evidence retrieval==
Kraft was initially charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and was held in custody as detectives conducted a thorough search of his vehicle. Upon the car&#x27;s rear seat, investigators found a belt, the width of which matched the bruising around Gambrel&#x27;s neck. Other incriminating evidence retrieved included alcohol, tranquilizers, various prescription drugs, and stimulants. The passenger seat and carpet of the vehicle were heavily bloodstained; however, Gambrel had no open wounds. The upholstery was removed for forensic analysis, which confirmed the blood was human. Beneath the carpet, investigators discovered an envelope containing more than 50 photographs of young men in pornographic poses. Many of the subjects in the pictures appeared to be either asleep or dead. Inside the trunk, investigators found a ring binder containing a hand-written list of 61 coded notations.
A search of Kraft&#x27;s home revealed further incriminating evidence, including clothes and personal possessions of numerous young men who had been murdered over the previous decade. Fibers taken from a rug matched those found on victim Scott Hughes. In addition, the couch in Kraft&#x27;s living room was identified as being the one in the photographs found in Kraft&#x27;s car. A roll of film discovered also contained shots of victims Eric Church and Rodger DeVaul sitting in Kraft&#x27;s car. A ligature mark is clearly visible on DeVaul&#x27;s neck in one of these images.

===Scorecard===
The coded list of 61 neatly printed terms and phrases found in the trunk of Kraft&#x27;s car is believed to refer to each of Kraft&#x27;s victims. Many entries appear innocuous, but each is believed to refer to a specific murder victim or double murder. Several entries reference victims&#x27; names (for example, the entry reading &quot;EDM&quot; refers to the initials of victim Edward Daniel Moore, whereas &quot;Vince M&quot; refers to victim Vincent Mestas). In other instances, entries indicate torture or mutilation inflicted upon victims&#x27; bodies and/or the locations where they were last seen. The entry &quot;Marine Head BP,&quot; for example, is believed to refer to victim Mark Marsh; a Marine found decapitated, having been last seen hitchhiking towards Buena Park. Other entries simply refer to body dump locations; the entry &quot;Golden Sails,&quot; for example, refers to the fact the body of Craig Jonaitis was found in the parking lot of the Golden Sails Hotel.

The list also contains entries indicating a minimum of four double murders: &quot;GR2&quot; (victims Dennis Alt and Christopher Schoenborn, last seen in Grand Rapids); &quot;2 in 1 Beach&quot; (victims Geoffrey Nelson and Rodger DeVaul); &quot;2 in 1 Hitch&quot; and &quot;2 in 1 MV to PL&quot; (neither entry of which has been linked to any double murder or disappearance).

Investigators contend that two victims of whose murders Kraft was convicted (Church and Gambrel) are not listed on Kraft&#x27;s scorecard. However, since the list is in code, the possibility exists that Church, in particular, is included on the scorecard as an entry that investigators cannot recognize as referring to him. Gambrel may also be included on the list; although as Kraft was arrested while he attempted to dispose of the body, he may not have recorded an entry referring to Gambrel on his scorecard. These possibilities indicate the scorecard lists a minimum of 65 and possibly 67 victims.

===Formal charges===
On May 16, 1983, Kraft was formally charged with the murder of Gambrel. By September, investigators had interviewed over 700 witnesses and had gathered more than 250 physical exhibits which pointed towards Kraft&#x27;s guilt in a further fifteen homicides committed between December 1972 and February 1983. He was formally charged with these fifteen murders—in addition to two counts of sodomy and one of emasculation—on September 8, 1983.

==Trial==
Kraft&#x27;s trial began on September 26, 1988. He was tried in Orange County before Judge Donald A. McCartin. At the trial, almost 160 witnesses were called to testify on behalf of the prosecution. Over 1,000 exhibits were introduced as evidence. These exhibits included physical evidence such as bloodstains, hair and fiber evidence found at Kraft&#x27;s Long Beach residence and in his car; fingerprints found upon glass shards recovered from the Hall murder scene; negatives and photographs of victims found hidden inside Kraft&#x27;s vehicle, which depicted the men either dead, drugged, or asleep; the belt used to strangle Gambrel; and the prescription drugs and buck knife found in his vehicle. Other evidence introduced included work and travel records and gasoline receipts, which placed Kraft in particular locations where victims had been abducted and/or discarded, and the numerous personal possessions of various murder victims found in Kraft&#x27;s possession following his arrest.

Kraft&#x27;s defense was primarily one of alibis and alternate suspects: his attorneys dismissed much of the evidence produced as being circumstantial and attempted to portray Kraft as an articulate, hardworking, and upstanding member of the community. They did not dispute that the 16 men were murder victims yet argued that they were &quot;victims of someone, but not Randy Kraft.&quot; The defense also pointed out that investigators had initially believed several of the 16 victims to have been killed by one of two other serial killers, Patrick Kearney and William Bonin, and argued there was &quot;no concrete evidence&quot; that Kraft had killed any of the victims.

The trial lasted a total of thirteen months and would prove to be the most expensive trial in Orange County history. On April 29, 1989, each side opened their closing arguments, which lasted a total of three days: the prosecution again listing all the physical and circumstantial evidence pointing to Kraft&#x27;s guilt; the defense arguing as to the circumstantial case put forward by the prosecution that all the murders were linked and accusing the prosecution of &quot;glossing over&quot; the truth. Following the closing arguments, the jury deliberated for eleven days before reaching their verdict. On May 12, 1989, Kraft was found guilty of sixteen counts of murder, one count of sodomy, and one count of emasculation.
===Penalty phase===
On June 5, 1989, the same jury reconvened to hear further testimony from the prosecution and defense regarding Kraft&#x27;s penalty. This phase of Kraft&#x27;s trial would last until August, and it was at this point that the prosecution introduced evidence of several additional homicides committed in both Oregon and Michigan, which they were certain Kraft had also committed and for which he had not been tried in Orange County. The defense dismissed the prosecution&#x27;s assertions as being &quot;highly speculative&quot; and introduced testimony relating to a PET scan conducted on Kraft which, they asserted, revealed abnormalities in the frontal lobes of his brain, therefore reducing his ability to control both his emotions and impulse. The prosecution rebuffed this testimony by stating to the jury: &quot;There is nothing wrong with Mr. Kraft&#x27;s mind other than that he likes killing for sexual satisfaction&quot;, adding that the fact that his family and friends had found it difficult to believe he had committed any murders simply showed &quot;what a good salesman he is.&quot;

==Conviction and incarceration==
On August 11, 1989, the jury rendered a verdict of death. Three months later, on November 29, Judge McCartin formally sentenced Kraft to death. The sentence was upheld by the California Supreme Court on August 9, 2000.
, Kraft remains on death row at San Quentin State Prison. He continues to deny responsibility for any of the homicides he was either convicted of or suspected of committing.

==Missing accomplice==
Both circumstantial and DNA evidence relating to some of Kraft&#x27;s murders have caused many to strongly suspect that not all of the murders attributed to Kraft were committed by one person. The prosecution believed these inconsistencies could only be explained by the presence of an accomplice. It is contended that Kraft would have had difficulty moving around 200-pound (90 kg) corpses. Dumping them from moving vehicles alone would also be difficult to do unnoticed.

Abrasions and debris found at some of the crime scenes, where bodies had been discarded upon or alongside freeways, indicated that they had been discarded from vehicles traveling at more than 50 miles per hour, and for one individual to perform this act without compromising his driving would be very difficult. Moreover, footprints in the sand close to where the body of John Leras was found at Sunset Beach in 1975 unequivocally indicate two people had carried the youth&#x27;s body to where it was discarded. In the case of Eric Church, semen samples found on his body were inconsistent with Kraft&#x27;s blood type, and, while the photographs of the victims found in Kraft&#x27;s car had to have been processed somewhere, no photo developer ever reported Kraft&#x27;s morbid images to the police. Kraft himself had no darkroom expertise or darkroom equipment.

During Kraft&#x27;s trial, members of the prosecution admitted privately that they did not charge him with several murders that they were certain he had committed because of facts relating to the cases, which indicated more than one perpetrator. Although DNA evidence found upon the body of Church was incompatible with Kraft, investigators had found photographs depicting Church in Kraft&#x27;s car and his distinctive Norelco electric razor was also found in Kraft&#x27;s house.

===Jeff Graves===
The prosecution believed Kraft&#x27;s former lover, Jeff Graves, may have assisted Kraft in several murders. Graves, who had lived with Kraft between 1971 and 1976 (when sixteen known murders attributed to Kraft occurred), had been questioned concerning the Crotwell abduction and murder in 1975 when he verified part of Kraft&#x27;s alibi to police. When questioned further about the incident following Kraft&#x27;s arrest in 1983, Graves had informed investigators: &quot;I&#x27;m really not going to pay for it, you know.&quot; Graves died of AIDS on July 27, 1987. At the time of his death, police had been preparing to question him further.

===Bob Jackson===
In January 2000, journalist Dennis McDougal, the author of a 1991 book about Kraft entitled &quot;Angel of Darkness&quot;, published an article which recounted interviews with a small-time criminal named Bob Jackson, who reportedly confessed to murdering two hitchhikers with Kraft: one in Wyoming in 1975 and another in Colorado in 1976. Authorities in both Colorado and Wyoming were unable to corroborate these claims.

Jackson also claimed to McDougal that Kraft&#x27;s scorecard included only his &quot;more memorable&quot; murders; in Jackson&#x27;s opinion, Kraft&#x27;s total body count stood closer to 100. McDougal reported these allegations to police and provided tape recordings of the interviews. Detectives interrogated Jackson and eventually persuaded him to enter a mental institution; no murder charges were filed against him due to an absence of direct incriminating evidence.

Kraft sued McDougal and the publisher of &quot;Angel of Darkness&quot; in 1993, seeking $62 million in damages. The suit contended that the book smeared his &quot;good name&quot;, unjustly portrayed him as a &quot;sick, twisted man&quot;, and destroyed his prospects for future employment by ruining his chances of overturning his conviction on appeal. The lawsuit was dismissed by the California Supreme Court in June 1994.

==Potential unverified scorecard victims==
By 1988, investigators had linked forty-three of the sixty-one entries upon Kraft&#x27;s scorecard to identified and nameless young men murdered in the twelve years previous to Kraft&#x27;s arrest, leaving eighteen entries referring to twenty unidentified and/or undiscovered murder victims.

Three further victims simply listed at trial as being entries &quot;unconnected to any unsolved murder&quot;—&quot;Navy White,&quot; &quot;Iowa,&quot; and &quot;Hari Kari&quot;—have since been identified and/or linked to four murder victims discovered in 1974 and 1975. A further victim unidentified at trial yet linked to Kraft as an entry simply reading &quot;76&quot; due to the location of his body behind a Union 76 gas station has since been identified as Keith Jackson, a tourist from Manchester, England, meaning he may have been the entry in Kraft&#x27;s journal logged as &quot;England&quot; as opposed to &quot;76&quot;. These developments leave fifteen entries referring to seventeen unknown further victims upon Kraft&#x27;s scorecard. This is due in part to his murders having occurred in several states, with bodies being discarded in varying locations, and several entries being cryptic.
The entry upon Kraft&#x27;s scorecard reading &quot;Navy White&quot; is believed by investigators to refer to a 17-year-old named James Sean Cox, an apprentice medic stationed at Mather Air Force Base who was last seen on September 29, 1974, hitchhiking near Interstate 5 and whose body was found several weeks later in Rancho Santa Fe. Cox was dressed in his white Navy uniform at the time of his disappearance. In addition to the color of his uniform, Cox was a blond youth.

A further entry on Kraft&#x27;s scorecard, simply reading &quot;Iowa,&quot; is believed to refer to either an 18-year-old Marine named Oral Alfred Stuart Jr., who had been born in Iowa, or a 17-year-old Cedar Rapids native named Michael Ray Schlicht. Stuart&#x27;s body was found discarded close to a Long Beach condominium on November 10, 1974; he had died as a result of blunt force trauma. His body remained unidentified until March 2012. Schlicht&#x27;s body was discovered in Laguna Hills on September 14, 1974; he had died approximately four days prior to the discovery of his body, although his family had last seen him in April 1974. His cause of death was initially determined to be accidental due to alcohol and Valium intoxication, but was later reclassified as a homicide. His body remained unidentified until November 2023. Investigators note the similarity of &quot;modus operandi&quot; in the murder and body disposal of both men to that of other victims Kraft is known to have killed.

One unknown entry upon the scorecard reads &quot;Hari Kari.&quot; This entry may refer to the stabbing murder of 30-year-old David Michael Sandt, who was found sexually assaulted and stabbed to death close to a vacant house in Long Beach on January 13, 1975. The multiple stab wounds inflicted were to Sandt&#x27;s stomach, and his body was found in a kneeling position with his arms extended in front of him in a position reminiscent of the Japanese ritual suicide practice known as &quot;Hara-kiri&quot;.

==Other &quot;Freeway Killers&quot;==
Patrick Kearney, a suspect in a series of killings of young men known as the &quot;Trash Bag Murders&quot;, surrendered to Riverside Police in July 1977. He subsequently confessed to the murders of 28 boys and young men, many of whom he had also discarded along freeways in southern California. Although Kraft is also known to have dismembered some of his victims, Kearney invariably killed his victims by shooting them in the temple. In addition, Kearney discarded the majority of his victims&#x27; bodies in trash bags. Although primarily known as the Trash Bag Murderer, Kearney is also known as the Freeway Killer.

In 1980, William Bonin and four known accomplices were arrested for a series of killings known as the &quot;Freeway Murders,&quot; which displayed a markedly similar disposal method to those committed by Kraft. Bonin is also known to have tortured his victims, although he never plied his victims with alcohol or drugs. In addition, although he is known to have stabbed some victims&#x27; genitalia with a knife and one victim to death, Bonin never mutilated their bodies, and almost all of his victims were strangled to death with their own T-shirts. Moreover, the majority of Bonin&#x27;s victims were younger than those of Kraft, with the age range of his victims being 12 to 19 years.

<text>An orphan process is a computer process whose parent process has finished or terminated, though it remains running itself.

== Unix-like ==
In a Unix-like operating system any orphaned process will be immediately adopted by an implementation-defined system process: the kernel sets the parent to this process. This operation is called &quot;re-parenting&quot; and occurs automatically. Even though technically the process has a system process as its parent, it is still called an orphan process since the process that originally created it no longer exists. In other systems orphaned processes are immediately terminated by the kernel. Most Unix systems have historically used &quot;init&quot; as the system process to which orphans are reparented, but in modern DragonFly BSD, FreeBSD, and Linux systems, an orphan process may be reparented to a &quot;subreaper&quot; process instead of &quot;init&quot;.

A process can be orphaned unintentionally, such as when the parent process terminates or crashes. The process group mechanism in most Unix-like operating systems can be used to help protect against accidental orphaning, where in coordination with the user&#x27;s shell will try to terminate all the child processes with the &quot;hangup&quot; signal (SIGHUP), rather than letting them continue to run as orphans. More precisely, as part of job control, when the shell exits, because it is the &quot;session leader&quot; (its session id equals its process id), the corresponding login session ends, and the shell sends SIGHUP to all its jobs (internal representation of process groups).

It is sometimes desirable to intentionally orphan a process, usually to allow a long-running job to complete without further user attention, or to start an indefinitely running service or agent; such processes (without an associated session) are known as daemons, particularly if they are indefinitely running. A low-level approach is to fork twice, running the desired process in the grandchild, and immediately terminating the child. The grandchild process is now orphaned, and is not adopted by its grandparent, but rather by init. Higher-level alternatives circumvent the shell&#x27;s hangup handling, either telling the child process to ignore SIGHUP (by using nohup), or removing the job from the job table or telling the shell to not send SIGHUP on session end (by using disown in either case). In any event, the session id (process id of the session leader, the shell) does not change, and the process id of the session that has ended is still in use until all orphaned processes either terminate or change session id (by starting a new session via codice_1).

To simplify system administration, it is often desirable to use a service wrapper so that processes not designed to be used as services respond correctly to system signals. An alternative to keep processes running without orphaning them is to use a terminal multiplexer and run the processes in a detached session (or a session that becomes detached), so the session is not terminated and the process is not orphaned.

A server process is also said to be orphaned when the client that initiated the request unexpectedly crashes after making the request while leaving the server process running.

These orphaned processes waste server resources and can potentially leave a server starved for resources. However, there are several solutions to the orphan process problem:

# Termination is the most commonly used technique; in this case the orphan is killed.
# Reincarnation is a technique in which machines periodically try to locate the parents of any remote computations; at which point orphaned processes are killed.
# Expiration is a technique where each process is allotted a certain amount of time to finish before being killed. If need be a process may &quot;ask&quot; for more time to finish before the allotted time expires.

<text>St. Thomas More College (STM) is a Catholic, undergraduate, liberal arts college located in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, and is a federated college of the University of Saskatchewan.

==History==
St. Thomas More College (STM), named for St. Thomas More, is the only federated college at the University of Saskatchewan. The college was established by the Basilian Fathers in 1936, on the invitation of the president of the University of Saskatchewan to the Catholic bishop of Saskatoon. The Congregation of St. Basil is a Roman Catholic religious organization of ordained priests with headquarters in Toronto, Ontario. This congregation is different from the Order of St. Basil the Great, which is an Eastern Catholic monastic religious order based in Rome and serving primarily Ukrainian Catholics.

The Roman Catholic Basilian Fathers initiated the operation of Catholic colleges associated with non-denominational universities throughout Canada. The college was incorporated by an act of the Legislature of Saskatchewan in 1943, following formal approval by the senate and board of governors of the university. The act was amended in 1972 and 2001. The college is administratively and financially autonomous from the university. It receives direct provincial grants and is accountable to the provincial government. In 2006, the General Council of the Basilian Fathers announced that they will not be making any further appointments of Basilian priests to the college. The &quot;St. Thomas More College Amendment Act 2013&quot; was passed in the provincial legislature making the St. Thomas More College Society the sponsor of the college. The passing of that act was the final formal step in the college&#x27;s transition to the post-Basilian era.

The Institute for Stained Glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at St. Thomas More College.

In 2009, the College debuted its mascot, Reagan the Rooster, named after former students&#x27; union President, Reagan Seidler.

==Programs==
St. Thomas More College is academically integrated within the University of Saskatchewan however St. Thomas More offers a unique vision and mission of Catholic post-secondary education. The college&#x27;s students receive University of Saskatchewan degrees, as STM, itself, does not grant degrees. The college cooperates with the College of Arts &amp; Science in preparing students for all B.A. and B.Sc. degrees, as well as the B.F.A. and B.Mus. degrees. Students in the College of Arts &amp; Science may register through St. Thomas More College, admission requirements, as well as fees, for both are the same. Enrollment in STM does not restrict choice of program or courses, and students may register with the college even if none of their classes in a given year are taught by the college. The college provides opportunities to explore and to live Christian values but imposes no obligation in this area.

The college faculty are members of the faculty of the College of Arts &amp; Science and of the university council. Faculty appointments and promotion require the approval of the university to ensure that St. Thomas More classes are equivalent in standards to other university classes. STM employs full-time tenured, non-tenured, and part-time sessional faculty on its academic staff.

The college at present offers classes in these departments of arts and science: Anthropology, Archeology, Catholic Studies, Classical, Medieval &amp; Renaissance Studies, Economics, English, Languages &amp; Linguistics, History, Philosophy, Political Science, Psychology, Religious Studies, Ukrainian, Spanish, and Sociology. Some of these courses are the same as those offered by the corresponding department of the College of Arts &amp; Science, thus having the same course number and title, with the added advantage of having, on average, smaller class sizes. All classes transfer directly to the University of Saskatchewan. Whether the student are registered through STM or not, all students at the University of Saskatchewan studying on campus may take STM courses.

St. Thomas More College also offers additional opportunities not otherwise available to students at the University of Saskatchewan. One of these programs is the Community Service Learning (CSL) program in which students can choose to take part in valuable community service and volunteer work as part of some of their courses. This program also helps students to build connections between their community experience and their theoretical (&quot;book&quot;) learning at university. A similar international study abroad experience is offered through the Intercordia program.

Finally, St Thomas More College is home to the Prairie Centre for the Study of Ukrainian Heritage, an academic unit of the college that supports programs and projects as well as instruction in the area of Ukrainian Studies.

==Services==
Students can join various organizations through STM including the St. Thomas More Students&#x27; Union, the University of Saskatchewan Ukrainian Students&#x27; Association, Newman Centre, Knights of Columbus, Newman Players, Development and Peace, STM Newman Choir, Pre-education Club, Pre-law Club, and &quot;In Medias Res&quot; – a literary journal.

There is a campus ministry team in the college who help provide spiritual support, faith programs, and community building services. Daily mass is also held in the college chapel throughout the school year.

STM offers a library with over 50,000 volumes as well as a cafeteria (&quot;Choices&quot;).

<text>Stephen Cambreleng Cowper (born August 21, 1938) is an American Democratic politician who was the sixth governor of Alaska from 1986 to 1990. He was governor during the 1989 &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill.

Cowper is the CEO of Steve Cowper &amp; Associates. He has also served on the boards of multiple energy-related companies in the US and Canada.

==Early life and career==
Cowper was born in 1938 in Petersburg, Virginia, to Stephanie (née Smith) and Marion Cowper. He was raised in Kinston, North Carolina and attended Virginia Episcopal School in Lynchburg, Virginia. He received bachelor&#x27;s and law degrees from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and after serving in the U.S. Army Medical Corps and Army Reserve, he worked as a maritime lawyer in Norfolk, Virginia, for three years. Cowper moved to Fairbanks, Alaska, in 1968 and served as assistant district attorney for rural Alaska and Fairbanks.

In 1970, Cowper went to Vietnam and worked as a freelance correspondent throughout Asia. Upon returning to Alaska, he wrote a political column for the &quot;Fairbanks Daily News-Miner&quot;, taught a college course on Alaska lands, was a partner in an air taxi and cargo business, and worked as a diver for a University of Alaska marine research team.

==Political career==

In 1974, Cowper was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives, where he served two terms. During his time in the House, he served as chairman of the Finance Committee (1977–1978), chairman of the Steering Council on Alaska Lands (1978), a member of the Subsistence Committee (1977–1978), and a member of the Alaska Advisory Committee for the Law of the Sea Conference (1978). In 1982, Cowper ran for governor, but narrowly lost the Democratic nomination to Bill Sheffield, who went on to win the general election.

===Governor of Alaska (1986–1990)===
Cowper ran for governor again in 1986, and defeated incumbent Sheffield in the August 26 primary by a 2–1 margin. He eventually won the November 4 general election, winning 47% of the vote against Republican state Senator Arliss Sturgulewski and Alaskan Independence Party candidate Joe Vogler.

Once in office, Cowper proposed reestablishing the state income tax to help close the state&#x27;s billion-dollar deficit; this proposal was met with strong opposition. He advocated the expansion of the University of Alaska&#x27;s international study program, hoped to establish an International Trade Center, and placed emphasis on the teaching of foreign languages and culture in state schools. In early 1989, he announced that he would not seek reelection in 1990, a decision considered a surprise by some observers.

==Post-governorship==
After serving as governor, Cowper served as a visiting fellow at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1991, and was a Co-Chairman of the Pacific Rim Fisheries Conference in 1994 and 1997.

Since 1991, he has been the CEO of Steve Cowper &amp; Associates, a group that advises companies and governments on energy-related initiatives. He has also served on the boards of multiple energy-related companies in the US and Canada. As of 2010, Cowper lived in Austin, Texas with his third wife and family.

<text>William Jennings Sheffield Jr. (June 26, 1928 – November 4, 2022) was an American Democratic politician who was the fifth governor of Alaska from 1982 to 1986. Sheffield&#x27;s term in the governor&#x27;s mansion was marked by controversy including attempts to have him impeached.

==Background==
Sheffield was born in Spokane, Washington. He served in the United States Army from 1946 to 1949 and went to DeVry University, then DeForest Training School. Sheffield moved to Alaska in 1953 to sell and service home appliances for Sears. He became active in the local chamber of commerce group, where his participation enabled him to overcome a severe stutter. Sheffield later founded a hospitality business, Sheffield Enterprises, that grew to own and operate 19 Sheffield House hotels across Alaska and in Whitehorse, Yukon. He sold the business to Holland America Line in 1987.

In addition to his business career, Sheffield was involved in politics and government as a Democrat, and was a delegate to numerous local, state, and national party conventions. He served on the Anchorage Planning Commission from 1960 to 1963, and the Anchorage Charter Commission in 1976. In addition, Sheffield served as chair of the state parole board and the University of Alaska Foundation Board.

He died at his Anchorage home on November 4, 2022. He was 94.

==Governorship==
While governor, Sheffield pushed an unpopular bill through the Alaska state legislature to consolidate the state&#x27;s time zones. Prior to the passage of this bill, Alaska was spread over four time zones (Pacific, Yukon, Alaska-Hawaii, and Bering). Sheffield&#x27;s bill placed virtually the entire state (with the sole exception of the Aleutians, starting just west of Dutch Harbor) into the Yukon Time Zone (which was then renamed the Alaska Time Zone). Initially, this was poorly received; those in the panhandle lost their sense of unity with the west coast of the United States, and those in the heartland of the state were placed, in effect, in a perpetual daylight saving time. More than twenty years later, the state legislature was still debating the issue, with some members wanting to return the panhandle and capital to Seattle time, and with others claiming that Sheffield broke his promise to revisit the change after a one-year trial period.

===Impeachment inquiry===
As governor, Sheffield was brought before a grand jury investigating a contract that had been awarded by the state amid allegations of favoritism and lack of due process in the awarding process. Sheffield was not indicted. The grand jury report urged the impeachment of Sheffield. The report was leaked to the public after an anonymous source alerted the members of the news media that a waste receptacle in the court building in which grand jury deliberations had been held contained a copy of the report. After the report was leaked, deliberations about an impeachment began. An impeachment inquiry was conducted to determine whether the Alaska Senate would impeach. An impeachment would have led to an impeachment trial in the Alaska House of Representatives. By a 3–2 vote, the committee running the inquiry into Sheffield voted to send the Senate a report concluding that there was insufficient evidence against Sheffield to warrant an impeachment. Instead of impeachment, Senate opted to instead pass a resolution condemning Sheffield&#x27;s gubernatorial administration for favoritism.

==Later career==
After leaving the position of Governor, Sheffield served as chairman of the board of directors for Alaska Railroad from 1985 to 1997. In 1997 he was promoted to president and CEO of the railroad, where he served until 2001. As of 2008, he was on the railroad&#x27;s Board of Directors as vice chairman.

<text>Morris Fuller Benton (November 30, 1872 – June 30, 1948) was an American typeface designer who headed the design department of the American Type Founders (ATF), for which he was the chief type designer from 1900 to 1937.

Many of Benton&#x27;s designs, such as his large family of related sans-serif or &quot;gothic&quot; typefaces, including Alternate Gothic, Franklin Gothic, and News Gothic, are still in everyday use.

==Typefaces==

Benton is credited as America&#x27;s most prolific designer of metal type, having (with his team) completed 221 typefaces, including revivals of historical models, like Bodoni and Cloister; original designs, such as Hobo, Bank Gothic, and Broadway; and adding new weights to existing faces, such as Century, Goudy Old Style and Cheltenham. Although he did not invent the concept, Benton working at ATF pioneered the concept of families of typeface designs, allowing consistency of appearance in different sizes, widths and weights. This allowed ATF to capitalise on a successful typeface&#x27;s popularity and facilitated coherent layout and graphic design; its 1923 specimen book described its approach of creating families which could allow advertisers to &quot;talk at command with varying emphasis and orchestral power [rather than using] a medley of display types.&quot;

Benton worked as the team leader of designers responsible for creating a basic design and then adapting it to different sizes and weights. He considered his work as a designer important and wrote a brief list of typefaces he considered his most important work in 1936, shortly before his retirement. Benton was relatively retiring in life: a 1936 interview described him as &quot;one of the most difficult men to interview I have ever talked to...try to pin some honour on him, or give him credit for some achievement, and he will modestly sidestep with the remark that ‘Lady Luck helped me a lot there!’&quot;

==Technology==
In addition to his strong aesthetic design sense, Benton was a master of the technology of his day. He read mechanical engineering at Cornell University, graduating in 1896. His father, Linn Boyd Benton, invented the pantographic engraving machine, which was capable not only of scaling a single font design pattern to a variety of sizes while compensating for the size change, but could also condense, extend, and slant the design (mathematically, these are cases of affine transformation, which is the fundamental geometric operation of most systems of digital typography today, including PostScript). Morris used these machines with his father at ATF, during which these machines were refined to an impressive level of precision.

Theo Rehak, the current owner of much ATF typecasting equipment, and author of the definitive treatise &quot;Practical Typecasting&quot;, explains that the Bentons demanded that any deviation in machining or casting be within two ten-thousandths of an inch. Most modern machine shops are equipped to measure down to one thousandth of an inch. As an advertising device, in 1922 ATF manufactured a piece of type eight points tall (0.11 inch) containing the entire Lord&#x27;s Prayer in 13 lines of text, using a cutting tool roughly equivalent to a 2000-dpi printer.

<text>Fazoli&#x27;s System Management, LLC., or Fazoli&#x27;s, is an American fast casual restaurant chain headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky. It was founded in 1988 and is now owned by FAT Brands. As of December 2024, there are 195 Fazoli&#x27;s locations nationwide specializing in Italian-American cuisine.

==History==
Fazoli&#x27;s was established as a sister brand of Long John Silver&#x27;s in 1988, initially in the Lexington, Kentucky, area. In 1990, Kunihide Toyoda&#x27;s Seed Restaurant Group purchased the five locations there.

The chain expanded rapidly. By 1993, it had 62 restaurants within Kentucky, Indiana and Florida. By 1997, there were 300 Fazoli&#x27;s across the country, and a peak of 400 in 2004.

In October 2006, Sun Capital Partners purchased the business. Of 319 locations, in 32 states, 179 were franchised. However, by 2008, Fazoli&#x27;s sales and location count were falling. A struggling franchisee in Arizona announced it was closing all 13 of its restaurants in the state.

In July 2015, Sentinel Capital Partners acquired Fazoli&#x27;s 124 company-owned and 89 franchised locations but the sole remaining location in Southern Nevada closed in 2016. The remaining 122 owned and operated restaurants were acquired in November 2022 by FAT Brands Inc., for $130 million.

==Products==

Fazoli&#x27;s original menu options were pizza and pasta. From 1990, the emphasis shifted away from pizza towards pasta cooked al dente, and meals at a lower price point than competing hamburger restaurants. In the early 2000s, low-carbohydrate diets became popular and Fazoli&#x27;s added low fat items with more vegetables and protein.

As of 2016, Fazoli&#x27;s menu includes baked pastas, sandwiches, salads, parmigiano, meatballs and pizza. Some restaurants offer a catering menu for collection or delivery.

<doc id="853954" wikidata="Q2880471" url="?curid=853954" title="Maria Dermoût">
<text>Maria Dermoût (15 June 1888 – 27 June 1962) was an Indo-European novelist, considered one of the greats of Dutch literature and as such an important proponent of Dutch Indies literature. In December 1958 &quot;Time&quot; magazine praised the translation of Maria Dermoût&#x27;s &quot;The Ten Thousand Things&quot;, and named it one of the best books of the year.

Whitney Balliett of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote: &quot;Mrs. Dermout, in the manner of Thoreau and the early Hemingway, is an extraordinary sensualist. [...] in passages of a startling, unadorned, three-dimensional clarity; often one can almost touch what she describes.&quot;

==Biography==
Helena Anthonia Maria Elisabeth Ingerman was born on 15 June 1888 on a sugar plantation in Pati, Java, Dutch East Indies, and educated in the Netherlands. She wrote in Dutch. After completing her education she returned to Java, where she married Issac Johannes Dermoût and became known as Maria Dermoût. She travelled extensively across Java and the Moluccas with her husband. In 1933 her husband retired, and the couple settled in the Netherlands. Maria Dermoût was widowed in 1952.

Maria Dermoût died in The Hague on 27 June 1962. She is the subject of the biography &quot;Geheim Indië. Het leven van Maria Dermoût 1888-1962&quot; (&quot;The Secret East Indies. The Life of Maria Dermoût 1888-1962&quot;) in 2000 by the Indo-European (Dutch-Indonesian) author Kester Freriks.

==Body of work==
Dermoût turned to writing early in life, but remained largely unpublished until she was 63. She wrote two novels, both of which were not published until she was in her sixties: &quot;The Ten Thousand Things&quot; (&quot;De tienduizend dingen&quot;, 1955) and &quot;Days Before Yesterday&quot; — also published as &quot;Just Yesterday&quot; (&quot;Nog pas gisteren&quot;, 1951). There are English translations of her novels by Hans Koning. Some of her short stories were published in translation in magazines such as &quot;Vogue&quot; during the 1960s. In Dutch, five short-story collections by her were also published.

She is viewed as one of the giants among Dutch-Indies literary writers, and &quot;The Ten Thousand Things&quot; in particular is widely regarded as an idiosyncratic masterpiece. The book has been translated into thirteen languages. As Hans Koning puts it in his Introduction to the New York Review Books edition of the novel:
&quot;Dermoût was sui generis, a case all her own. She did not write about her Indies as a Dutch woman, or as a Javanese or an Ambonese. Hers was a near-compassionate disdain for the dividing lines, the hatreds and the fears ... She &quot;painted&quot; landscapes, still lifes and people in a world of myth and mystery.&quot;
Although not conventionally autobiographical, both of her novels draw from events in Dermoût&#x27;s own life. Like the central character in &quot;The Ten Thousand Things&quot;, Dermoût lost her son in violent circumstances (he died in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp). The reminiscences of Javanese childhood experiences described in &quot;Days Before Yesterday&quot; are based on, but do not mirror, her own childhood in the tropics.
Author Oek de Jong appropriately wrote:

&quot;Still, Maria Dermoût an author for the happy few. Is she a writer&#x27;s writer? Certainly not. She is a storyteller par excellence. Her stories are subtle, but they are also accessible. Nonetheless she remains an author for the happy few, equal to the greats of Dutch prose, but much less known than they are. There are many reasons for her modest literary reputation: her own modesty, the small body of her work, the brevity of her literary career. But it is mainly her work itself that is the cause. It possesses something that wards off hordes of readers, yet still manages to attract a handful, who then embrace it and spread the word of its exquisite nature. The shell seekers among the readers, the slow walkers, those who stop and turn and bend over to pick up that one beautiful shell - they recognize her extraordinary work.&quot;

<text>The Ames () company, originally established in 1881 by Frederick A. Ames, was a buggy manufacturer and later an American automobile manufacturer in Owensboro, Kentucky, from 1910 to 1925. A beetle-backed &quot;gentleman&#x27;s roadster&quot; and a five-passenger tourer were the first models offered for sale by the company. The company also produced replacement bodies for the Ford Model T. At its peak, the company produced about 30,000 vehicles. The last model the company made was called the &quot;Kentucky Thoroughbred&quot;. In 1922, the company again remade itself, manufacturing furniture under the name F. A. Ames Corporation until 1941, when the company filed for bankruptcy and most of its assets were purchased by the Whitehall Furniture Co. of Owensboro.

Frederick A. Ames died in 1925 at the age of 60. At the time of his death, he was reported to have vast real-estate holdings in Owensboro and Atlanta, Georgia. His widow, the former Mary M. McMannon, died in 1933. Although the Ames had no children of their own, Mary&#x27;s niece, Marie had been raised in their home as an adopted child, and inherited most of Ames&#x27; fortune.

<text>Keith Harvey Miller (March 1, 1925 – March 2, 2019) was an American Republican politician from Alaska. Miller was the second secretary of state of Alaska under Walter Hickel. He became the third governor of Alaska after Hickel’s resignation to become U.S. Secretary of the Interior. Under his tenure, Alaska came into sudden wealth after an oil lease sale on the North Slope created a revenue of $900 million.

==Early life==
Keith Harvey Miller was born in Seattle, Washington on March 1, 1925, one of four sons of Hopkins Keith Miller (1901–1981) and Sarah Margaret (née Harvey) Miller (1903–1960). He grew up in the rural outskirts of Seattle before the family moved to the vicinity of Bothell, Washington in 1939. Miller attended and graduated from high school in Bothell. He briefly studied at the University of Idaho before joining the United States Army Air Forces, serving during the last two years of World War II.

==Early career and move to Alaska==
After leaving the military, Miller established a holly farm in Olympia, Washington in 1946. During this time, he spent portions of several summers working in the Territory of Alaska and also studied at the University of Washington, Seattle, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1952. Miller sold the holly farm in 1953, the same year he married Diana Mary Doyle in Seattle and established a collection agency there. He sold the agency in 1957 after being hired by the Internal Revenue Service, who stationed him in Anchorage, Alaska.

==Early political career==

Miller began his political career in 1962 with his election to the Alaska House of Representatives., where he served one term. He served as Secretary of State of Alaska (now the Lieutenant Governor of Alaska) from 1966 until Hickel resigned to become United States Secretary of the Interior under President Richard M. Nixon, on January 29, 1969. He was promptly elevated to the position of Governor of Alaska.

==Governor of Alaska==

Under Governor Miller, Alaska completed the sale of land leases in Prudhoe Bay, which brought a windfall of $900 million. The funds from the oil leases were seven times the state’s budget and seven years after he first proposed an investment fund for oil royalties, Governor Jay Hammond established the Alaska Permanent Fund.

He lobbied extensively for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. He pushed the Congress to approve the pipeline over the objections of Federal Judge George Hart and the Alaska Legislature for funds to build a road to the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field.

In 1970, seeking election to a full term, he saw his popularity diminish as his former running mate, Walter Hickel, delayed issuance of the permit to build the pipeline. He faced a primary election challenge from two-term Congressman Howard Wallace Pollock. He defeated Pollock, but faced William A. Egan, who was Alaska’s first governor, in the general election. Egan won the race, 52.4-46.1. Only after the 1973 oil crisis did Congress pass the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act that Miller sought.

==Later career==

In 1972, Miller was elected to a four-year term in the Alaska Senate. That term was cut short due to a challenge of the redistricting plan drawn up by the Alaska Supreme Court in 1972, centered on the apportionment of Senate districts in Anchorage. The court drew up a new plan in 1974. Rather than run for reelection in the new, Democratic-leaning district, Miller made one more campaign for governor in the Republican primary. He faced Hickel and Jay Hammond, who became the party’s nominee. In 1977, Governor Hammond named Miller to a seat on the Alaska Transportation Commission to serve as its chair.

==Death==
Miller died from pancreatic cancer while at a hospice in Anchorage a day after his 94th birthday on March 2, 2019. His wife, Jean Cuffel Miller, preceded him in death.

<text>Between 1903 and 1905, the AMG automobile was a Swedish automobile manufactured by the AB Motorfabriken i Göteborg. 

The company had been building stationary engines since 1897; in the first years of the new century they began importing French Richard-Brasier cars. Swedish production of the marque was considered, but the plans failed. A new model, using twin-cylinder air-cooled engines bought from the German Fafnir company, was shown in 1903. These tended to overheat, and as a result they were soon changed to a water-cooled model. The engines were the only automobile part that were imported; everything else was made in Sweden. Around 10 cars were built before the company failed in 1905; one was used regularly until 1928.

<text>St. Norbert College (SNC) is a private Norbertine liberal arts college in De Pere, Wisconsin, United States. Founded in October 1898 by Abbot Bernard Pennings, a Norbertine priest and educator, the school was named after Saint Norbert of Xanten. In 1952, the college became coeducational. As of April 2023, the school&#x27;s enrollment is 2,009 students.

==History==

St. Norbert College was established when Abbot Bernard Pennings, a Dutch immigrant priest from the Premonstratensian Berne Abbey of Heeswijk, the Netherlands, founded the college to train young men for the priesthood. Francis Ignatius Van Dyke, a seminarian, was the first and, at the time, only student. St. Norbert is the world&#x27;s first and only institution of higher learning, sponsored by the Premonstratensian order. Pennings later started a commerce program at the college for lay students before retiring in 1955.

St. Norbert&#x27;s second president, Dennis Burke, expanded the college, anticipating the student population would eventually reach 2,000. Robert Christin, who became president in 1968, implemented the current course system and the academic divisional structure. In 1973, Neil Webb, a former faculty member and vice president, became president. Webb established the first permanent endowment for the school. Serving as the college&#x27;s president from 1983 to 2000, Thomas Manion led the expansion of facilities and the development of additional academic programs. Enrollment topped 2,000. Thomas Kunkel, former dean of the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park, became the college&#x27;s seventh president in 2008. Since then, the college has constructed the Mulva Family Fitness &amp; Sports Center, the Gehl-Mulva Science Center, the Cassandra Voss Center, Michels Commons, Schneider Stadium, the Mulva Library, Gries Hall, Ariens Family Welcome Center and Todd Wehr Hall.

Brian J. Bruess, a 1990 graduate of St. Norbert College and former executive vice president and chief operating officer of St. Catherine University in St. Paul, Minnesota, became president in 2017. Although he announced on November 1, 2019, that he would not continue as president after the end of the 2019–20 academic year, uproar from the college community led to further discussion between Bruess and the SNC Board of Trustees that resulted in a multiyear contract. Four members of the board, including the chair, resigned shortly thereafter. In March 2022, Bruess announced his appointment as the inaugural president of the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John&#x27;s University, beginning in July 2022. Kunkel returned to serve as interim president for the 2022-23 academic year. Laurie Joyner became St. Norbert College&#x27;s ninth president, and the college&#x27;s first female president, in July 2023.

==Campus==

The campus consists of , much of which borders the Fox River. As a residential campus, students typically walk to classes year-round. The many trees and statues on campus provide a scenic view, especially in fall, when the foliage changes colors. Directly behind the Campus Center is a pavilion and marina where St. Norbert hosts a picnic for students to kick off the school year. This shoreline area is also the venue for &quot;Knights on the Fox&quot; – a free summer concert series open to the community.

Important social buildings include the Ray Van Den Heuvel Family Campus Center (Campus Center), which includes a fitness center, gymnasium, and diner (Phil&#x27;s Diner) and a reading lounge with a picturesque view overlooking the Fox River. There is also an events hall for movies and public speakers. Special events put on by student groups are also held there, such as comedian appearances and awareness speeches.

Old St. Joseph Church, which is still an active church, was built in 1890 and renovated in 1998. It is located on the site of a former mission chapel that was erected for early settlers by the French-born Jesuit priest Rev. Charles Albane in 1676. The chapel stood for nearly 200 years. An all-wood structure was built in 1870, but it burned to the ground after a lightning strike in 1889. It was rebuilt in its current form as a brick structure in 1890. The church contains a statue/shrine of Saint Joseph that was crowned by Pope Leo XIII in 1891. Novena devotions are held on Wednesday.

The old St. Boniface Church (built in 1883) is owned by St. Norbert College. In 2013, it was renamed Dudley Birder Hall in honor of longtime St. Norbert College music professor, Dudley Birder. It was also converted into a performance arts center following a $1.7 million renovation. It is now used for recitals, chamber concerts, Dudley Birder Chorale rehearsals, and public lectures.

Much of the campus is in what is now the St. Norbert College Historic District.

==Academics==

St. Norbert College offers undergraduate programs in more than 80 areas of study, leading to a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Business Administration degree. A Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree is also offered through a joint effort with the Bellin College of Nursing. The most popular undergraduate majors are business administration, biology, and education. In addition to its undergraduate offerings, St. Norbert College offers three master&#x27;s-level graduate programs in business administration, theological studies and liberal studies. The Master of Theological Studies department hosts a branch program in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where program studies take place at the Norbertine Abbey of Santa Maria de la Vid. Students on that campus can earn the full M.T.S. degree. In 2015, the college began offering an MBA program through its new Donald J. Schneider School of Business &amp; Economics. The Medical College of Wisconsin&#x27;s Green Bay campus, which serves the northeast Wisconsin region, is in the new Gehl-Mulva Science Center at St. Norbert.

In the 2025 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; college rankings, St. Norbert was ranked 90th (tied) of 211 liberal arts colleges nationwide. The college is also ranked 118th among &quot;Liberal Arts Universities&quot; in Forbes&#x27;s 2019 list of America&#x27;s Best Colleges.

The Mulva Library provides digital and in-person reference services; hosts the Digital Commons, an institutional repository of documents, media, and other materials online; and provides a makerspace with technologies for the academic community. It is the home of the Center for Norbertine Studies, the international center of research on the Premonstratensians and Norbertines. The library also holds the college archives and the college&#x27;s café (Ed&#x27;s Café).

==Student life==
===Student housing===
About 86% of students live on campus in residence halls, apartments and townhouses. St. Norbert requires all traditional undergraduate students not registered as commuters to live on campus. Freshman housing includes three traditional residence hall options: Madelaine-Lorraine Hall (co-ed), Sensenbrenner Hall (Co-ed), and Bergstrom Hall (co-ed Honors students). Campus housing options for sophomores include Mary Minahan McCormick Hall, Michels Hall, and Victor McCormick Hall. Upperclassmen enjoy single-person dorm rooms such as Burke Hall, the Townhouses and Carriage House (apartment-like housing), college-owned houses and college-owned apartments, including Gries, Xanten and Prémontré Halls.

===Student involvement===

There are more than 100 registered student clubs and organizations on campus. St. Norbert encourages its students to become involved in their community through community service and by participating in one of the 15 fraternities, sororities, and independent social groups. The school also has eight National Honor Society chapters, two student publications, and eight musical and performance ensembles. A major activity that St. Norbert students participate in is the annual &quot;Into The Streets&quot; community service project that provides service to organizations in De Pere and neighboring communities. This event is staffed by first-year students, staff and faculty, and is part of the First-Year Experience program.

In 2013, the old St. John&#x27;s Lutheran Church (originally built in 1932) was reopened as the Cassandra Voss Center following a $2.7 million renovation. It was named after former St. Norbert College student Cassandra Voss, who died in a car accident at age 21. Before her death, she was on track to become St. Norbert College&#x27;s first student to graduate with a major in women&#x27;s and gender studies. The building now features offices, study space, performance space, a kitchen, a classroom, and a library. The Cassandra Voss Center offers a variety of programs &quot;exploring intersectional issues of identity and inclusion&quot; and &quot;fostering dialogue on topics related to justice and identity including racism, sexism, homophobia, and classism&quot;. 

===Greek life===
Greek life at St. Norbert includes four sororities and three fraternities, as well as two Greek governing groups. Greek groups sponsor fund-raising activities, food drives, and benefits to support charities. Greek groups collectively completed a total of 2,117 hours of service and raised $9,638 for their respective philanthropies during the 2015–16 school year. There are three fraternities and four sororities on the St. Norbert campus.

==Athletics==

The St. Norbert College Green Knights participate in NCAA Division III athletics and were members of the Midwest Conference from 1982 through the 2020–21 season. In fall 2021, they joined the Northern Athletic Collegiate Conference. St. Norbert offers 23 varsity sports including: football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming and diving, softball, baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field, cheerleading, and dance.

The Green Knights football team has won 17 Midwest Conference championships since joining the league in 1984.

<text>The Amherst was a Canadian automobile manufactured in Amherstburg in 1911. A distinctive feature of the car was a demountable body that could be fitted behind the front seats to convert the car into a light truck.

The car was financed by backers in Detroit, Michigan, but they withdrew their support before production commenced. Only three cars were built before the company failed.

<text>The Opiconsivia (or Opeconsiva or Opalia) was an ancient Roman religious festival held August 25 in honor of Ops (&quot;Plenty&quot;), also known as Opis, a goddess of agricultural resources and wealth. The festival marked the end of harvest, with a mirror festival on December 19 (during Saturnalia) concerned with the storage of the grain.

The Latin word &quot;consivia&quot; (or &quot;consiva&quot;) derives from &quot;conserere&quot; (&quot;to sow&quot;). Opis was deemed a chthonic (underworld, inside the earth) goddess who made the vegetation grow. Since her abode was inside the earth, Ops was invoked by her worshipers while sitting, with their hands touching the ground, according to Macrobius (Saturnalia, I:10). 

Although Ops is a consort of Saturn, she was closely associated with Consus, the protector of grains and subterranean storage bins (silos). Consus is therefore thought to be an alternate name of Saturn in the chthonic aspect as consort. The festival of Consus, the Consualia, was celebrated twice a year, each time preceding that of Ops: once on August 21, after the harvest, and once on December 15, after the sowing of crops was finished. 

The Opiconsivia festival was superintended by the Vestals and the Flamines of Quirinus, an early Sabine god said to be the deified Romulus. Quirinus was absorbed by, and included in, the first and earliest Capitoline Triad, along with Mars—then an agriculture god—and Jupiter. The main priestess at the regia wore a white veil, characteristic of the vestal virgins. A chariot race was performed in the Circus Maximus. Horses and mules, their heads crowned with chaplets made of flowers, also took part in the celebration.

<doc id="853986" wikidata="Q1358239" url="?curid=853986" title="Augmentative">
<text>An augmentative (abbreviated ) is a morphological form of a word which expresses greater intensity, often in size but also in other attributes. It is the opposite of a diminutive.

Overaugmenting something often makes it grotesque and so in some languages, augmentatives are used primarily for comical effect or as pejoratives.

Many languages have augmentatives for nouns, and some have augmentatives for verbs.

== Germanic languages ==

=== English ===
In modern English, augmentatives can be created with the prefixes:
*’’over-’’: e.g., ’’overlord’’ and ’’overqualified’’.
*’’grand-’’: e.g., ’’grandmaster’’ and ’’grandparent’’.
*’’super-’’: e.g., ’’supermarket’’ and ’’superpower’’.
*’’mega-’’: e.g., ’’megastore’’ and ’’megastar’’.
*’’arch-’’: e.g., ’’archrival’’ and ’’archangel’’.

Since the early 1990s, the prefix ’’über-’’ or ’’uber-’’ has also frequently been used as a borrowing from German. The suffix -zilla, expressing a monstrous quality, can also be considered an augmentative form.

* ’’-zilla’’: e.g., ’’momzilla’’ and ’’bridezilla’’.

In some parts of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, the prefix &quot;old&quot; is used as an augmentative, and a pejorative in some cases. An example of this is using &quot;old’un&quot; or &quot;old one&quot; to describe one&#x27;s parents/grandparents.

=== Dutch ===
In modern Dutch, as in English, augmentatives are usually created with the prefixes:
*: e.g., and (&quot;overweight&quot; and &quot;overheating&quot;)
*: e.g., and (&quot;grandmaster&quot; and &quot;wholesaler&quot;)
*: e.g., and (&quot;supermarket&quot; and &quot;superpower&quot;).
*: e.g., and (&quot;a very big contract&quot; and &quot;a very large movie theater&quot;)

There are also prefixes that can be used for some adjectives:
* (blood) : e.g., and (&quot;very beautiful&quot; and &quot;very own&quot;)
* (stone): e.g., and (&quot;very rich&quot; and &quot;very good&quot;; lit. &quot;stone rich&quot; and &quot;stone good&quot;)
* (boulder): e.g., and (&quot;very fast/hard/etc.&quot; and &quot;very fun&quot;, lit. &quot;boulder hard&quot; and &quot;boulder fun&quot;)

=== German ===
In German, there are different ways to build augmentatives. They are rarely used prefixes:
*&quot;un-&quot;, for instance in &quot;Unzahl&quot; &quot;huge number&quot;, &quot;Unsumme&quot; &quot;huge sum&quot;, &quot;Unmenge&quot; &quot;huge quantity&quot;. Mostly used for negation, however (e.g. &quot;Unglück&quot; &quot;bad luck&quot;, &quot;Unsinn&quot; &quot;nonsense&quot;), and occasionally in a pejorative sense (&quot;Unwetter&quot; &quot;bad weather&quot;, &quot;Untier&quot; &quot;monster&quot;, lit. &quot;un-animal&quot;).
* &quot;ur-&quot;, for instance, &quot;uralt&quot; &quot;ancient&quot;
* &quot;über-&quot;, for instance, &quot;Übermensch&quot; (q.v.)
* &quot;aber-&quot;, for instance, &quot;abertausend&quot; &quot;thousands&quot;
* &quot;mega-&quot;, for example &quot;megageil&quot; &quot;mega-cool&quot;
* &quot;ultra-&quot;, for example &quot;ultrageil &quot;ultra-cool&quot;&quot;
* &quot;voll-&quot;, for example &quot;Vollidiot&quot; &quot;utter idiot&quot;
* &quot;riesen-&quot; (from &quot;Riese&quot;, meaning &quot;giant&quot;), for example &quot;riesengroß&quot; &quot;enormous&quot; 
* &quot;stein-&quot;, for example &quot;steinalt&quot; &quot;very old, ancient&quot;, &quot;steinreich&quot; &quot;very rich, wealthy&quot; (lit. &quot;stone-old&quot;, &quot;stone-rich&quot;)

=== Swedish ===
In Swedish, the way to build an augmentative is to add one of many prefixes before the main word, typically a noun, adjective or adverb. Some common prefixes are: &quot;jätte&quot;-, &quot;super&quot;-, &quot;bauta&quot;-, and &quot;mega&quot;-. For example:

*&quot;jätte&quot;- (meaning &quot;giant&quot;), for example &quot;jättesnabb&quot; &quot;very fast&quot; 
*&quot;super&quot;-, for example &quot;supermycket&quot; &quot;very much&quot;
*&quot;bauta&quot;- (from &quot;bautasten&quot;, meaning &quot;boulder&quot;), for example &quot;bautaportion&quot; &quot;very large serving (of food)&quot;
*&quot;mega&quot;-, for example &quot;megahus&quot; &quot;gigantic house&quot;

There are many synonyms to the augmentative &quot;jätte&quot;-. Some of these synonyms are: &quot;as-&quot;, &quot;gör-&quot;, &quot;svin-&quot;, &quot;skit-&quot;, and &quot;ur-&quot;. These do not refer to size, only intensity, e.g. &quot;gul&quot; &quot;yellow&quot; to &quot;jättegul&quot; or &quot;skitgul&quot; &quot;very yellow&quot;. Like many other augmentative prefixes, &quot;jätte&quot;- is also a noun that can be part of a compound word, e.g. &quot;jättelik&quot; &quot;enormous&quot; (literally &quot;giantlike&quot;), as opposed to &quot;jättelik&quot; &quot;very similar&quot;.

The use of prefixes to build augmentatives in Swedish is colloquial and is seldom used in formal text and speech, where adjectives and adverbs are used instead.

== Greek language ==
In Modern Greek the usage of augmentative is very common in everyday speech but not quite as common as diminutive forms. The usage of augmentative is considered colloquial and it is not present at all in formal speech. There are a variety of augmentative suffixes

: Fem. -α, -άρα, -άκλα
: Masc. -αράς, ΄-αρος,-ακλάς, -ακλας

Most nouns in their augmentative form are feminine. This means neuter and masculine nouns become feminine and then an augmentative suffix is added.

In some neuter cases just changing the original gender of the noun is enough for augmentation to take place

== Iranian languages ==

=== New Persian ===
In Persian, the suffix -ū (ـو) is used for augmentative; for instance:

* &quot;ریش&quot; (rīš &quot;beard&quot; ) → &quot;ریشو&quot; (rīšū &quot;bearded, having a long beard&quot; ) 
* &quot;شپش&quot; (šepeš &quot;louse&quot; ) → &quot;شپشو&quot; (šepešū &quot;unhygine, having a lot of lice in hair/body hair&quot; )
* &quot;ریغ&quot; (rīğ &quot;puke&quot; ) → &quot;ریغو&quot; (rīğū &quot;unstable, puker, having a huge amount of vomiting / puking&quot; ) 
* &quot;شاش&quot; (šāš &quot;piss&quot; ) → &quot;شاشو&quot; (šāšū &quot;bedwetter, having a big piss&quot; )
* &quot;دماغ&quot; (damāğ &quot;nose&quot; ) → &quot;دماغو&quot; (damāğū &quot;having a long nose&quot; )
* &quot;نفرین&quot; (nefrīn &quot;curse&quot; ) → &quot;نفرینو&quot; (nefrīnū &quot;curser, who is always cursing a lot&quot; )
* &quot;شکم&quot; (šekam &quot;stomach&quot; ) → &quot;شکمو&quot; (šekamū &quot;gluttonous; having a big stomach to eat more&quot; )
* &quot;پت&quot; (pot &quot;body hair&quot; (in Kermani&#x27;s dialect) ) → &quot;پتو&quot; (potū &quot;hairy&quot; ) 
* &quot;اخم&quot; (axm &quot;frown&quot; ) → &quot;اخمو&quot; (axmū &quot;frowny, who is always frowning a lot&quot; )

== Romance languages ==

=== Italian ===

Italian has several augmentatives:

* &quot;-one&quot;, &quot;-ona&quot;, found also in several English loanwords from Italian, often via French: minestrone (&lt; &quot;minestra&quot; &#x27;soup&#x27;); provolone cheese (&lt; &quot;provola&quot; &#x27;a kind of cheese&#x27;); &quot;cartone&quot; (&lt; &quot;carta&quot; &#x27;paper&#x27;) appears in English &quot;carton&quot; and &quot;cartoon&quot;; &quot;balloon&quot; (this may have been formed in Italian, though the usual form is &quot;pallone&quot;, or in French)); &quot;milione&quot; &#x27;million&#x27; (&lt; &quot;mille&quot; &#x27;thousand&#x27;);
Suffixes &quot;-accio&quot;, &quot;-accia&quot;, and &quot;-astro&quot;, &quot;-astra&quot;, also exist, but they are used to form pejorative words, with no properly augmentative meaning: &quot;coltellaccio&quot; (&lt; &quot;coltello&quot; &#x27;knife&#x27;; gives English &quot;cutlass&quot;); the family name &quot;Carpaccio&quot;.

=== Portuguese ===
In Portuguese, the most common augmentatives are the masculine &quot;-ão&quot; (sometimes also &quot;-zão&quot; or &quot;-zarrão&quot;) and the feminine &quot;-ona&quot; (or &quot;-zona&quot;), although there are others, less frequently used. E.g. &quot;carro&quot; &quot;car&quot;, &quot;carrão&quot; &quot;big car&quot;; &quot;homem&quot; &quot;man&quot;, &quot;homenzarrão&quot; &quot;big man&quot;; &quot;mulher&quot; &quot;woman&quot;, &quot;mulherona&quot; &quot;big woman&quot;.

Sometimes, especially in Brazilian Portuguese, the masculine augmentative can be applied to a feminine noun, which then becomes grammatically masculine, but with a feminine meaning (e.g. &quot;o mulherão&quot; instead of &quot;a mulherona&quot; for &quot;the big woman&quot;); however, such cases usually imply subtle meaning twists, mostly with a somewhat gross or vulgar undertone (which, nonetheless, is often intentional, for the sake of wit, malice or otherwise; so, &quot;mulherão&quot; actually means not a big woman, but a particularly sexy one).

=== Romanian ===
In Romanian there are several augmentative suffixes: &quot;-oi/-oaie&quot;, &quot;-an/-ană&quot; etc. (masculine/feminine pairs). They originate from Latin &quot;-ō&quot; (acc. sg. &quot;-ōnem&quot;), the origin of the other Romance augmentative suffixes. The archaic form has survived unchanged in Banat (and in Aromanian) as &quot;-on&quot;&#x27;, &quot;-oan&#x27;e&quot;. As in other Romance languages, a feminine base word may have masculine or feminine forms in the augmentative. Examples:
* casă (f.) → căsoi (n.), căsoaie (f.)
* piatră (f.) → pietroi (n.)
* băiat (m.) → băiețoi (m.)
* băiat (m.) → băietan (m.)
* fată (f.) → fetișcană (f.)

=== Spanish ===
In Spanish, -o becomes -ón and -a becomes -ona most frequently, but -ote/-ota and -azo/-aza (also meaning &quot;-blow&quot;) are also commonly seen. Others include -udo/-uda, -aco/-aca, -acho/-acha, -uco/-uca, -ucho/-ucha, -astro/-astra and -ejo/-eja. &quot;More detail at Spanish nouns&quot;.

==Slavic languages==

===Bulgarian===
In Bulgarian, as in Russian, mainly with &quot;-ище&quot;.

===Polish===
In Polish there is a variety of augmentatives formed with suffixes, for example: żaba (a frog) → żabucha / żabsko / żabisko / żabula; or kamień (a stone) → kamulec / kamior / etc.
* -ica, e.g. igła, f. (&quot;needle&quot;) + ica → iglica (&quot;spire&quot;)
* -yca, e.g. wieża, f. (&quot;tower&quot;) + yca → wieżyca
* -ch, e.g. Stanisław, m. (&quot;Stan&quot;) + ch → Stach (short form of the name, but not diminutive)
* -chu e.g. Krzysztof, m (&quot;Christopher&quot;) + chu → Krzychu (&quot;Chris&quot;)
* -cha, e.g. kiełbasa f. (&quot;sausage&quot;) + cha → kiełbacha (&quot;large sausage&quot;)
* -ucha, e.g. dziewa, f. archaic (&quot;girl&quot;) + ucha → dziewucha (&quot;wench&quot;)
* -oja, e.g. dziewa, f. archaic (&quot;girl&quot;) + oja → dziewoja (&quot;wench&quot;)
* -uch, e.g. uparty, adj. m. (&quot;stubborn&quot;) + uch → uparciuch
* -ocha, e.g. śpi, v. (&quot;sleeps&quot;) + och → śpioch (&quot;sleepyhead&quot;)
* -och, e.g. tłusty, adj. m. (&quot;fat&quot;) + och → tłuścioch (&quot;fatso&quot;, &quot;fatty&quot;)
* -al, e.g. nos, m. (&quot;nose&quot;) + al → nochal (&quot;large nose&quot;)
* -ula, e.g. smark, adj m. (&quot;snot&quot;) + ula → smarkula (&quot;snotty young person&quot;)
* -ała, e.g. jąkać się (&quot;to stutter&quot;) + ała → jąkała (&quot;stutterer&quot;)
* -isko, e.g. wąs, m. (&quot;mustache&quot;) + isko → wąsisko (&quot;large mustache&quot;)
* -sko, e.g. baba, f. (&quot;woman&quot;) + sko → babsko (&quot;hag&quot;)
* -ysko, e.g. biedak m. (&quot;pauper&quot;) + ysko → biedaczysko (&quot;poor fellow&quot;)
* -or, e.g. but m. (&quot;shoe&quot;) + or → bucior (&quot;large or dirty shoe&quot;)
* -er, e.g. bóbr m. (&quot;beaver&quot;) + er → bober (&quot;large beaver&quot;)

===Russian===
In Russian there is a variety of augmentatives formed with prefixes (including loans from Latin) and suffixes, including -ище and -ина for example: дом (&#x27;house&#x27;) домище (&#x27;great house&#x27;) домина (&#x27;huge house&#x27;). To provide an impression of excessive qualities the suffix -га can be used for example: ветер (&#x27;wind&#x27;), ветрюга (&#x27;strong wind&#x27;).

===Serbo-Croatian===
In Serbo-Croatian there is a variety of augmentative nouns formed with suffixes:

* -ina, e.g. brdo, n. (&quot;hill&quot;) + ina → brdina
* -čina, e.g. majmun, m. (&quot;monkey&quot;) + čina → majmunčina
* -etina, e.g. kuća, f. (&quot;house&quot;) + etina → kućetina
* -erina, e.g. kuća + erina → kućerina
* -urina, e.g. ptica, f. (&quot;bird&quot;) + urina → ptičurina
* -ešina, e.g. glava, f. (&quot;head&quot;) + ešina → glavešina
* -uština, e.g. bara, f. (&quot;pond&quot;) + uština → baruština
* -ušina, e.g. pijetao, m. (&quot;rooster&quot;) + ušina → pjetlušina

Augmentative nouns are either pejoratives, although distinct pejorative suffixes also exist. All augmentative nouns have female grammatical gender. Some nouns can have their augmentatives formed with different suffixes, for example, see &#x27;kuća&#x27; above.

In &quot;Hrvatska gramatika&quot;, Barić et al. do not classify adjectives formed with suffixes which intensify an action or property as augmentatives. The augmentative prefixes for adjectives listed in &quot;Hrvatska gramatika&quot; are pre- (&quot;excessively&quot;; or excess of a favorable property), hiper- (&quot;hyper-&quot;), super- and ultra-. According to &quot;Hrvatska enciklopedija&quot;, augmentative verbs surpass their base verb with their intensity. However, by defining augmentative verbs as an action done excessively, &quot;Hrvatska gramatika&quot; only lists pre- (&quot;over-&quot;) as an augmentative verb.

==Semitic languages==

===Arabic===

Form II of the Arabic verb often has an augmentative sense, which may indicate intensity (intensive) or repetition (frequentative).

==Bantu languages==
Bantu languages&#x27; noun class markers often double as augmentative and diminutive markers, and some have separate classes that are used only as an augmentative or a diminutive.

===Chichewa===

Chichewa noun class 7 prefix &quot;chi-&quot; doubles up as augmentative marker. For example, &quot;chindege&quot; which is a huge plane as opposed to &quot;ndege&quot; which is just a regular plane.

==International auxiliary languages==

=== Esperanto ===
In Esperanto, the &quot;--&quot; infix is included before the final part-of-speech vowel. For example, &quot;domo&quot; (house) becomes &quot;domego&quot; (mansion). See Esperanto vocabulary.

=== Interlingua ===
Interlingua does not have an augmentative suffix, but international prefixes such as &quot;super-&quot;, &quot;hyper-&quot;, &quot;mega-&quot; can be used as augmentatives. See also Interlingua grammar.

<text>The Amilcar was a French automobile manufactured from 1921 to 1940.

==History==

===Foundation and location===
Amilcar was founded in July 1921 by Joseph Lamy and Emile Akar. The name &quot;Amilcar&quot; was an imperfect anagram of the partners&#x27; names. The business was established at 34 rue du Chemin-Vert in the 11th arrondissement of Paris. However, Amilcar quickly outgrew their restricted city-centre premises, and during the middle part of 1924 the company relocated to Saint-Denis on the northern edge of the city.

===Early years===
The original Amilcar was a small cyclecar. Designed by and Edmond Moyet, it bore a striking resemblance to the pre-war Le Zèbre. The vehicle was first exhibited at the Paris Motor Show in October 1921. The business was a leading beneficiary of a cyclecar boom, prompted by a government initiative which held out the promise of a reduced rate of annual car tax, fixed at 100 francs per year, for powered vehicles weighing no more than 350 kg (dry weight, without fuel or water or such extras as a spare tyre/wheel), providing seating for no more than two people and powered by an engine of not more than 1100 cc. Once a vehicle exceeded these limits it ceased to be a cyclecar and was instead officially designated a voiturette.

The 4-cylinder, 903cc Amilcar CC appeared in 1922, with a wheelbase of just . The CC subsequently became available in two further versions; the Amilcar C4 was a slightly longer sports car, while the CS, introduced in 1924, was a brisker sports version with the engine size increased to 1004 cc. The side-valve engine had splash lubrication, and came with a three-speed gearbox. The most famous model of all was the CGS &quot;Grand Sport&quot; of 1924; this featured a 1074 cc sv engine and four-wheel brakes. This in turn evolved into the more sporty CGSS &quot;Grand Sport Surbaissé&quot;. These models were built under license in Germany (as the ) and in Austria (as the Grofri) and in Italy (as Amilcar Italiana). The marque entered automobile racing in the mid-1920s with a batch of supercharged double overhead camshaft 1100 cc six-cylinder cars that used a roller bearing crankshaft in the full racing version; these vehicles were also available with plain metal bearings, driven by famous race driver André Morel.
===Financial challenges and the loss of independence===

During the later 1920s the company expanded out of its original comfort zone of small economical cars: the results were mixed. The founders, Akar and Lamy, becoming less involved with the management of the business, were persuaded to conclude, in 1931, a business agreement with André Briès and Marcel Sée. Sée already knew Amilcar from the inside, having in January 1929 been dismissed from a position involved in management of the company. The early 1930s were years of economic crisis in France, and at the end of 1933 a company owned by Briès and Sée, called &quot;Sofia&quot; &quot;(Societe financiere pour l&#x27;automobile)&quot;, took effective control of Amilcar, which nevertheless continued to function under its existing name.


From 1928 the company offered a light touring car; called the &quot;M-Type&quot;, it featured a side-valve 1200 cc engine and was launched in 1928. It was followed by the M2, M3, and M4 versions. The M-type and its successors continued to be produced through the ensuing years of financial difficulty, offered for sale till 1935, though production probably ended in 1934. 1928 saw the introduction of a straight eight, which was built with an ohc 2.3-liter engine. This, the C8, proved unreliable, and soon disappeared with only a few hundred produced.

The acquisition of Amilcar by &quot;Sofia&quot; in 1933 did not in itself resolve the financial pressures. At the end of August 1934, still faced with disappointing sales volumes, the factory at Saint-Denis closed for the last time, as management struggled to save the business. A new model was clearly needed and in October 1934 the company presented the new 2-litre (12CV) Amilcar Pégase powered by a 4-cylinder, ohv 2150 cc engine supplied by Delahaye. There was also a competition version of the Pégase with a 2490 cc (14CV) engine. By October 1935, the smaller Amilcar models having been discontinued, the Pégase, produced under much reduced circumstances at premises in Boulogne-Billancourt, was the only Amilcar model listed.

===Another change of control===
Recognising the impossibility of sustaining the Amilcar business with a single model, but unsure of how to finance or produce another, management turned to Hotchkiss which had recently taken a large shareholding in &quot;Sofia&quot;, Amilcar&#x27;s holding company. Hotchkiss had problems of their own at this time, their hugely lucrative armaments business having recently been nationalised by the left-wing Blum government, while their middle-market automobile business was under increasing pressure as volume automakers became more effective in pushing their own ranges upmarket with models such as the Peugeot 402 and the Citroën Traction. Henry Mann Ainsworth, the Automobile Director at Hotchkiss, had already been presented, by the high-profile engineer Jean-Albert Grégoire, with a promising prototype (at that stage based on an Adler chassis) for a lightweight 7CV category, small, technically advanced family car. It was agreed that the automotive businesses of Hotchkiss and Amilcar would be merged and the prototype would be developed into an Amilcar model that would become the Amilcar Compound.

The front-wheel-drive Amilcar Compound was technically advanced in design for its era, featuring a monocoque frame made of a light alloy and independent suspension all around. Its engine at launch was a four-cylinder side-valve unit of 1185 cc. The Compound&#x27;s ambitious use of aluminium in its body structure and its front-wheel-drive configuration meant that production got off to a slow start, and although it was launched in October 1937, 584 of the 681 passenger cars produced date only from 1939, with a further 64 produced during the early months of 1940, before the German invasion of May/June 1940 effectively ended civilian automobile production in the Paris region. Production prototypes for an upgraded Compound with an OHV 1340 cc engine were running by the summer of 1939, and this version was scheduled for an October launch at the 1939 Paris Motor Show, but the motor show was cancelled and the launch was postponed – as matters turned out indefinitely – due to the intervention of war which France (and Britain) declared against Germany in early September 1939.

Production of the Amilcar was not resumed after World War II.

==Isadora Duncan==
Isadora Duncan&#x27;s fondness for flowing scarves was the cause of her death in 1927 in an automobile accident in Nice, France. The famed American dancer was the passenger in an Amilcar CGSS when her silk scarf became entangled around the open-spoked wheels and rear axle, breaking her neck.

<text>Al-Isra&#x27;ʾ (), also known as Banī Isrāʾīl (), is the 17th chapter (sūrah) of the Quran, with 111 verses (āyāt). The word refers to the Night Journey of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and about the Children of Israel. This surāh is part of a series al-Musabbihat surahs because it begins with the glorification of God.

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is traditionally believed to be a Meccan surah, from the second Meccan period (615-619).

==Exegesis==
=== 1 The transportation of Muhammad to &quot;the farthest Mosque&quot;. ===
This surah takes its name from the first verse which, in Islamic tradition, tells the event of the Isra, the transportation of Muhammad during the night from the Great Mosque of Mecca to what is referred to as &quot;the farthest Mosque&quot;.&quot; The exact location is specified in the Quran in Arabic words
أَسۡرَىٰ بِعَبۡدِهِۦ لَيۡلٗا مِّنَ ٱلۡمَسۡجِدِ ٱلۡحَرَامِ إِلَى ٱلۡمَسۡجِدِ ٱلۡأَقۡصَا but this is commonly taken to Noble Sanctuary (Temple Mount) in Jerusalem. Some scholars disagree about this (see Isra and Mi&#x27;raj) lively . While the city of Jerusalem (or al Quds , Al-Aqsa mosque) is not mentioned by name anywhere in the Qur&#x27;an, the first verse refers to Mohammed being taken from the &#x27;Masjid ul-harram&#x27; to the &#x27;Masjid al-Aqsa&#x27;:

Within Islam, it is generally agreed upon that the &#x27;Farthest Mosque&#x27; refers to Masjid al-Aqsa (i.e. the Temple Mount) in Jerusalem and the &#x27;Sacred Mosque&#x27; refers to Masjid al-Haram. The surah also refers to the other prophets, for example, Musa (Moses).

This Meccan surah was revealed in the last year before the Hijra. Like all the Meccan surah, it stresses the oneness of Allah, the authority of the prophets. However, the primary theme of the surah is salah (daily prayers), whose number is said to have been fixed at five during the Miraj which it alludes to. In addition, the surah forbids adultery, calls for respect for father and mother, and calls for patience and control in the face of the persecutions the Muslim community was facing at the time.

=== 8 Hell ===
Verse 17:8 refers to hell and states that those who reject the faith will be punished:

However, it also states that Allah is merciful and could forgive.

It also refers to the hereafter and states that there is a punishment for not believing in it (Verse 7:10):

=== 13-15 Day of Judgement ===
Verses 17:13 to 17:15 tells that fate is in people&#x27;s hands and tells that what they do will be rewarded or punished for on the Day of Judgement.

=== 26 Verse of Dhul Qurba ===
The verse relates to the controversies of the land of Fadak in modern-day Saudi Arabia.

=== 70 Aliens ===
۞ Verse 17:70 tells that mankind has been given a position &quot;above many of those whom we created&quot; angels and jinns.

=== 71 Day of Judgement ===
Verse 17:71 contains a reference to Yawm al-Qiyamah, the Day of Judgement:

In Kitab al-Kafi, Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq was questioned on the interpretation of 17:71 (&quot;On that day, We will call forth every people with their Imam...&quot;) to which he responded it is the Imam that is with them and he is the Mahdi, al-Qa&#x27;im of the people of that time.

=== 104 Children of Israel ===
Verse 17:104 &#x27;And We said thereafter unto the Children of Israel, “Dwell in the land. And when the promise of the Hereafter comes to pass, We shall bring you as a mixed assembly.”&#x27;

Al-Tabari (d.923) suggested this referred to Palestinian settlement. Al-Zamakhshari (d. 1144) suggested this referred to Egypt devoid of Pharaoh. Al-Qurtubi (d. 1272) suggested both.

<text>The Amiot, later known as the Amiot-Péneau, was a French tractor-type vehicle manufactured in Asnières-sur-Seine from 1897 to 1902. It was not an automobile per se; rather, it was a front-wheel-drive power pack used to convert horse-drawn carriages into motor cars. These devices were quite popular at the time in France and were known as &quot;avant-train&quot;, and the Amiot was one of the first on the market.

The original Amiot was a four-wheeled unit with a Cyclope or Augé engine; an electric version was also manufactured. The Amiot-Péneau was two-wheeled.

As of 2013, the municipality had a population of 39,938 inhabitants with 11,205 living in Visoko town. Located between Zenica and Sarajevo, Visoko lies where the river Fojnica joins the Bosna.

The Visoko region has evidence of long continuous occupation, with the first traces of life dating back to the 5th millennium BC. Archaeological excavations of Okolište have found one of the biggest Neolithic settlements of the Butmir culture in southeastern Europe.

It was an early political and commercial center of the Bosnian medieval state, and the site where the first Bosnian king Tvrtko I was crowned. The Old town Visoki, located on Visočica hill, was a politically important fortress, and its inner bailey Podvisoki was an early example of a Bosnian medieval urban area. After the fall of the Kingdom of Bosnia, medieval Visoko grew as an Ottoman town. A key role in its development was played by the local Bosnian Ajas-pasha.

Ottoman rule ended in 1878 when the Bosnian Vilayet was occupied by Austria-Hungary. On 11 November 1911, in the last years of Austro-Hungarian rule, it was almost completely burned down by an accidental fire. Before the Bosnian War, Visoko was the largest exporter of textile and leather in socialist Yugoslavia As of 2006, Visoko attracts tens of thousands of tourists every year, mainly because of Semir Osmanagić&#x27;s claims.

==Geography==
The Visoko municipality covers 232 square kilometres with several characteristic, morphologically distinctive valleys formed by the foothills of the Central Bosnian mountains including Ozren, Vranica and Zvijezda. The altitude of the region ranges from 400 to 1,050 metres. Visoko&#x27;s natural environment is defined by the river-valleys of the Bosna and Fojnica rivers. The municipality borders the towns of Kiseljak, Busovača, Kakanj, Vareš, Breza, Ilijaš and Ilidža, and is connected by rail to the Adriatic coast.

== Infrastructure ==
Visoko is directly connected to a highway along the European route E73 (A1 motorway) which directly connects it with Zenica and Sarajevo, which then continues to M17 road. It is connected to other places by the regional road R443 (Visoko - Kiseljak - Kreševo - Tarčin). It is located along the Šamac-Sarajevo railway. Visokogas is a public company in charge of the supply of natural gas, which supplies majority of city itself and some surrounding local communities.

==History==
===Prehistoric era===
The Visoko region shows evidence of long continuous occupation, with the first traces of life dating back to Paleolithic. Because of the two rivers that go through Visoko, the Bosna and Fojnica, the Visoko basin was always fertile land for agriculture. In the Neolithic period, the area of Central Bosnia played an important role as a mediator between the settlements of Adriatic Coast and the central Balkans. These metropolitan areas were connected by Neretva and Bosna rivers. Since Visoko was situated on the Bosna River, it has gained a lot of economic traffic between the two larger cities. Neolithic emplacements were founded on the shores of the rivers in places known today as Arnautovići, Donje Moštre, Okolište, Zbilje, Ginje, and Dvor. Arnautovići and Okolište were identified as part of Kakanj culture.

In September 2007 the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina continued archaeological excavations of Okolište, where it is estimated that around 3,000 people lived in the fortified settlement during the Neolithic Age making it one of the biggest in Southeastern Europe. This settlement belonged to the Butmir culture. The age of settlement is estimated by Radiocarbon dating to be around 4700 to 4500 years BC. Later on, neolithic cultures came in contact with other cultures like Baden. Around 3000 B.C.E. first signs of Chalcolithic culture appear which can be contributed to Vučedol culture of south Bosnian type, with findings in Donje Moštre and at the location of Old town of Visoki.

===Illyria and Roman Empire===
The Visoko area was inhabited by the Illyirian tribe of Daesitiates. They descended from Bronze Age and Iron Age culture called Central Bosnian culture group which was closely related to Glasinac culture. Best known archaeological evidence is grave of group of warriors dated to 4 B.C.E. found in Gornji Skladovi, Vratnica. The Roman Empire established its rule in 9 AD and built roads and fortresses in places like Kralupi, Seoča and Mokronozi. Area of Visoko was part of Roman province Illyricum.

===Medieval Bosnia (958–1463)===

Migration period saw introduction of new people to the Balkans - Slavs. Native Illyirian tribes through time became slavicized, but a lot of toponyms remained Illyirian in origin, like in example name of the river Bosna, which is namesake of country itself, but also a term for settlement which was used to reference the place called Bosna that existed in today&#x27;s area of Visoko. It is considered that this area in Visoko basin was nucleus of new medieval Bosnian state which emerged in around 1000 AD. Only later on with construction of Old town of Visoki the term &quot;Bosna&quot; for the settlement would be rarely used.

Visoko is named after the Visoki Castle and the town of Visoki, which occupied Visočica hill. Podvisoki, Mile (today&#x27;s Arnautovići), Biskupići and Moštre – together known as Visoko valley - were the early center of the medieval Bosnian kingdom. Many historical charters were made and written in Visoko valley, including the charter of first Bosnian king Tvrtko I Kotromanić in 1355, &quot;in castro nostro Vizoka vocatum&quot; which was also the first direct mention of the town of Visoki. Visoki was also a place where many important documents and legislation of medieval Bosnia were signed and written. The town of Visoki had a defensive role in protecting trade center Podvisoki (&quot;Subvisoki&quot;) which was located just below the town and was one of earliest examples of the medieval urban environments in Bosnia. Podvisoki was long time main trade center in medieval Bosnia.

The Rusag met at Mile, where Tvrtko I was crowned in 1377 and eventually buried alongside his uncle, Stjepan II Kotromanić, the Ban of Bosnia who preceded him. The Medieval Bosnian State Archive was also located there. Mile is today known for its many ornamented tombs of kings, bans and other former rulers. Ban Kulin&#x27;s Plate (dating from 1193) was discovered at Biskupići, along with the remains of another medieval church, grave sites and the foundations of several other contemporary structures. Moštre&#x27;s university was knows for its scholarship in medicine, theology, cosmogeny and ethics, although because of its connection to the Bosnian Church, nothing remains of its archives. Its existence is documented only by a handful of references in the Vatican archives of its enemy, the Catholic Church.

Other notable medieval settlements in the vicinity included Sebinje town, Čajan town in Gračanica – which protected the roads between Visoko and Bobovac – and the town of Bedem i Goduša.

===Ottoman Empire (1463–1878)===
The area of Visoko was conquered by Ottoman Empire around 1463, and it is from this time period that modern Visoko was formed. The founder of the town of Visoko was Ajas-beg (pasha), who was originally from Visoko but converted to Islam from Bogomilism. Visoko was a municipality at that time. From 1483, a voivod served at the head of the Visoko municipality, who together with the serdar (military commander) was the representative of the military and administration. The main imam (reisu-l-eimme), who existed in Visoko, fulfilled religious duties and duties to society. The court (or judicial) administration was carried out by the naib (or judge), who received help for bringing decisions by a jury of respected people from Visoko. The naib effected the law and his court according to sheriat.

During his rule, up to 1477, Ajas-beg built hammam, a religious primary school (mekteb), an aqueduct, bridge on the river Bosna, and a madrassa (Islamic high school), and also founded Dervish tekke (monastery), which is preserved to this day. In a short period, Visoko developed into the administrative center of the municipality and into the heart of trade and crafts, as well as the heart of cultural and spiritual life in the region. Visoko by then had the imbibe look of an Islamic oriental-style town with all the religious and cultural institutions.

===Austro-Hungarian Empire (1878–1918)===

The Vilayet of Bosnia was occupied by Austro-Hungary in 1878 (officially annexed in 1908) and only small local militias showed resistance and fought. In the early years of Austro-Hungarian rule, Visoko did not significantly change and kept its oriental-style look. In 1882, Visoko was an organized settlement with developed trade, offices, and other institutions. Increasing contact with western culture directed Visoko&#x27;s style in a slightly different way such that buildings of that time were built in Pseudo-Moorish style. The Tabhana mosque was founded in Visoko center and the city itself was expanded further to the banks of the Fojnica River. The main street was developed towards the town of Jalija, located at the delta of and a bridge across the Bosna River.

The first buildings of this period included the train station from 1882, the court building from 1895, a church with a Franciscan gymnasium (1899–1900), the municipality office, and a primary school from 1910. All were mainly built in the pseudo-Moorish style. Further development of the city was stalled by &quot;jangija&quot;, the big fire in 1911. The upper city area was completely burned, as well all the houses down the main street alongside Beledija, Shadrvan mosque and the high school. In all, 450 homes, stores and other small buildings were burned down. In the spring of 1912, the rebuilding of the city started and the government decided that all houses would be built with bricks and a tile roof in a traditional Bosnian style. After the mayor rebuilt Visoko, it had a unique mix of oriental and Western styles. Some houses from this time period still stand in the old district of the town.

===Kingdom of Yugoslavia, NDH and WWII (1918–45)===
After World War I and the defeat of Austria-Hungary in 1918, Visoko was incorporated into the new Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In the new state, the structure of houses did not change nor did the town develop. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Visoko was included in the newly formed Nazi Germany-sponsored Independent State of Croatia. Allied bombers pursued German and NDH forces and dropped nine bombs in the Visoko area, destroying strategic targets. Throughout the war, the town was not a battlefront and did not suffer much damage from the war itself. However, of the 1205 soldiers from the Visoko area, 142 of them were killed during the war. Visoko was liberated on 7 April 1945 by the 7th, 9th and 17th Krajina brigades from the Tenth division of the forces of the Yugoslav Partisans.

===SFR Yugoslavia (1945–92)===

After World War II, Visoko, like many other towns in Bosnia, began industrialisation and further urban expansion. From 1950, the town expanded to the extensive lowlands along Bosna and Fojnica shores, which were mostly used as farms. For ages, Visoko was known for its quality leather industry and with new age of industrialisation, the biggest leather company in Yugoslavia, KTK, had its headquarters in Visoko. Besides the leather industry, Visoko was distinctive for its textile, trade, metal and food industries, making the town one of the largest exporters in Socialist Yugoslavia. By 1991, Visoko had 92,5 million dollars of exported good, with 80 million of that from KTK&#x27;s leather industry. Due to the economic success of Visoko, Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito came to Visoko to visit the factories and the town itself.

During this period, the town developed necessary institutions like a post office, police and fire stations, health care, hotels, supermarkets, sport stadiums, and halls. Culture bloomed with the founding of a theatre, museum, cinema and library. Education was also improved by building three new schools: a primary &quot;Safvet-beg Bašagić&quot;, two high schools with a gymnasium and mixed high school center, &quot;Hazim Šabanović&quot;. In 1983 Zlatko Ugljen received Aga Khan Award for Architecture for Šerefudin&#x27;s White Mosque. The late 1980s and early 1990s were years of hasty urbanization and building of whole settlements like &quot;Luke&quot; which represents the most densely populated area of Visoko.

In 1953, Visoko&#x27;s handball club, RK Bosna, (previously &quot;Vitex&quot;) was founded and eventually competed in the first Yugoslavia handball league. A football club called Bosna was created in 1953 by merging two existing clubs &quot;Jadran&quot; (founded 1923) and &quot;Radnički&quot; (founded 1934). Aero club &quot;Izet Kurtalić&quot; is also one of the successful clubs which won numerous gold and other medals in Yugoslavia.

===Bosnian War (1992–95)===

On 6 April 1992, a state of emergency was proclaimed, with local Serbs already armed and surrounding the town. Local residents began to arm themselves or were armed by the Bosniak SDA party. The quick reaction of the local population prevented the town&#x27;s capture by seizing two local JNA barracks finally on 26 April, where newly formed local TO (territory defence) forces captured most of the arms in the barracks, which was a turning point at the start of the war in the Visoko area. 

The end of January embarked conflict between the Bosnian Croat HVO and Army of Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina (which succeed TO). On 27 January Visoko and neighbouring units prevented the blockade of Fojnica. On 2 November ARBiH units captured nearby HVO-held Vareš. The last days of 1994 brought a ceasefire between HVO and ARBiH, forming a united Federation and begin concentrating the fight on the much better-armed VRS (Army of Republika Srpska).

On 15 June Visoko was center of preparations for breaking the blockage on nearby Sarajevo. The action was however executed but with no significant gains, only some portion of the territory was liberated but Sarajevo stayed besieged. This big manoeuvre helped ARBiH forces outside Sarajevo to capture whole several towns and villages.

Finally, the Dayton agreement removed all front lines who were all 4 years dangerously close to town itself but never changed considerably, and only changes were made by Visoko&#x27;s forces by capturing nearby Zimča and other minor hills which only prevented town being surrounded which was accomplished. Visoko itself was heavily damaged; especially, economic resources and factories were purposely hit, damaged and destroyed. The damage to the economy was about $200 million. For four years of war Visoko area units lost 297 soldiers, 600 were wounded and disabled. 23 soldiers from Visoko area got highest ranking in ARBiH &quot;Zlatni Ljiljan&quot; (Golden Lily), and 19 members of police got &quot;Golden Police Star&quot;. Civilians also suffered, many of them wounded or killed, although, throughout the whole war, Visoko served as a center for refugees across Bosnia and Herzegovina, as it was considered well defended by their units, thus Visoko was a logistical center of Army BiH because it had industrial capacity and an improvised aerodrome.

===Bosnian pyramids claims===
Visočica is a hill overlooking the town of Visoko. In October 2005, Bosnian native and author Semir Osmanagić claimed that this hill and several surrounding hills concealed pyramids.

Scientific investigations of the site show there is no pyramid. Additionally, scientists have criticised the Bosnian authorities for supporting the pyramid claim saying, &quot;This scheme is a cruel hoax on an unsuspecting public and has no place in the world of genuine science.&quot;

Bosnian archaeologists have asked that the government cancel the digging permits given to Osmanagić and concentrate on work on the medieval town.

==Economy==

Visoko, experienced intensive modernization during the socialist era until 1991 with industrial exports accounting for a significant proportion of the town&#x27;s economic activity. Official Yugoslav data from 1991 state that Visoko achieved over 1 million dollars worth of export. The town&#x27;s economy was led by 20 sizable enterprises operating in the leather and textile industrial sectors led by KTK and Vitex.

Bosnian War left much of industry destroyed where damages are estimated at around 400 million KM (Convertible mark). Still, even the heavy bombardment by artillery and aircraft didn&#x27;t stop Visoko&#x27;s industry from producing goods for the army and civil population of Visoko and area.

Post-war economy still relies on leather industry as Prevent employs over 1500 workers and makes products mainly for export for European automobile industry. Food industry Vispak received Guinness certificate on 29 July 2005 for making largest coffee pot in the world. Visoko is traditionally known for its dried meat products like sujuk, and was made at least from the 1750s. Best known product is &quot;Visočka pečenica&quot; which is permanent charcuterie product obtained from high quality parts of beef, dry salted only with kitchen salt and cold smoked and dried. Association of meat processors from Visoko was founded which goal is to create and geographically protect &quot;Visočka pečenica&quot; as a brand with official application submitted on 29 January.

===Tourism===
From 2006, tens of thousands of tourists have visited Visoko because of Semir Osmanagić discredited Bosnian pyramid claims. The city invested around €250,000 (500,000 KM) for tourism in 2018

==Education==
There is not much detailed data about medieval universities in the Visoko area, or &quot;the place called Bosnia&quot; as it was referred to in one of the Vatican archives. It was in 1175 when the university was first mentioned, the high academy of Bosnian religious organization (&quot;see Bosnian Church&quot;). This university was known for its scholarship in medicine, theology, cosmogeny and ethics. There are four documents that directly or indirectly point to existence of the high academy in the Visoko area. Modern education started with introduction of Rüşdiye&#x27;s Ottoman parallel to European high schools of that time, built in 1870, closed after Austro-Hungarian annexation in 1879. Around 1881. new authorities established &quot;Municipal schools&quot; where classes were held in various houses. In 1910 first proper school was built by the Austro-Hungarian authorities, which still stands today. In 1900 Franciscan gymnasium was relocated from Guča Gora to Visoko. As leather industry played big part in Visoko&#x27;s economy, in 1929. &quot;Leather school&quot; was formed.

<text>The Manitoba Moose are a professional ice hockey team based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, that competes in the American Hockey League (AHL). The team plays its home games at Canada Life Centre, the home arena of its parent club, Winnipeg Jets of the National Hockey League (NHL).

The franchise was founded in 1994 as the Minnesota Moose, then playing in the International Hockey League (IHL). The Moose played fifteen seasons—five in the IHL (1996–2001) and ten in the AHL (2001–2011)—during their first tenure in Winnipeg. This was followed by four seasons in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, (2011–2015) during which the team was known as the St. John&#x27;s IceCaps. The team returned to Winnipeg prior to the 2015–16 season.

==History==

=== International Hockey League (1996–2001) ===
Following the departure of the original Winnipeg Jets franchise to Phoenix in 1996, a group of local businessmen, including Mark Chipman, purchased the Minnesota Moose of the IHL. The team was relocated to Winnipeg to provide a new tenant for the Winnipeg Arena and keep professional hockey in the city.

The team&#x27;s first season in Winnipeg was a disaster. Former Montreal Canadiens coach Jean Perron was brought in to replace Frank Serratore as head coach and general manager. The Moose won only 16 of 50 games under Perron before he was fired from both positions on January 4, 1997. Upon his dismissal, Perron lashed out at team ownership, the media, and the players, including a personal attack on team captain Randy Gilhen. Perron threatened legal action against the organization though no lawsuit was ever filed. Assistant coach Randy Carlyle took over as interim head coach for the remainder of the season and led the team to a winning record in their final 32 games of the season, but it was not enough to qualify for the playoffs.

Carlyle served as the head coach and general manager for team&#x27;s final four seasons in the IHL. The Moose had moderate regular season success and qualified for the Turner Cup playoffs three times, making it as far as the second round. Carlyle was named the league&#x27;s General Manager of the Year for the 1998–99 season. The Moose remained an independent club while playing in the IHL, electing not to affiliate with an NHL team.

=== American Hockey League (2001–present)===
====2001–2011: Move to the AHL====
The Moose and five other IHL clubs were accepted into the AHL upon the former&#x27;s demise in 2001, and the team became the top affiliate of the Vancouver Canucks. This partnership lasted until the NHL&#x27;s return to Winnipeg in 2011. Former Canucks star Stan Smyl was chosen by the Canucks as the new head coach of the Moose while Carlyle stayed on as general manager for one season before leaving to join the Washington Capitals coaching staff. In 2002–03, Smyl led the team to the second round of the Calder Cup playoffs, but lost to the Hamilton Bulldogs in seven games. After the team missed the playoffs the following season, Smyl was reassigned within the Canucks organization.

Following the departure of Smyl, Carlyle returned as head coach for the 2004–05 season. It was a season of big changes and new heights of success for the organization. The Manitoba Moose Hockey Club, now owned by True North Sports &amp; Entertainment, played its final game at the old Winnipeg Arena and moved into the brand new MTS Centre (since renamed Bell MTS Place and now Canada Life Centre). The Moose advanced as far as the conference final for the first time in team history but were swept in four games by their old IHL rivals, the Chicago Wolves. Mark Chipman was awarded the James C. Hendy Memorial Award for AHL Executive of the Year. After the season, Carlyle was hired by the Anaheim Ducks as their new head coach, becoming the first of four consecutive Moose head coaches to leave the team for head coaching positions in the NHL.

Former Canadiens head coach Alain Vigneault was hired by the Vancouver Canucks as the new Moose head coach for the 2005–06 season. Winnipeg native and three-time Stanley Cup champion Mike Keane also joined the club as their new team captain. Keane quickly became a fan favourite and the team had another great year, but again lost in the second round of the playoffs. After the season, Vigneault was promoted by the Canucks to fill their vacant head coaching position when Marc Crawford was dismissed.
Former Moose captain and assistant coach Scott Arniel was selected to replace Vigneault. Arniel coached the team for four seasons and, in 2008–09, led them to their best season in franchise history when the team finished with 107 points, the best record in the league. In the second round of the 2009 Calder Cup Playoffs, the Moose completed their first playoff sweep in franchise history, defeating the Grand Rapids Griffins. After beating the Houston Aeros in six games to win the Western Conference final, the Moose advanced to the Calder Cup finals for the first time, but lost the championship series in six games to the Hershey Bears. Arniel was awarded the Louis A. R. Pieri Memorial Award as the AHL Coach of the Year, while general manager Craig Heisinger became the second member of the Moose front office staff to win the James C. Hendy Memorial Award.

Arniel became the third Moose coach in six years to make the jump to the NHL when he was hired by the Columbus Blue Jackets as their new head coach in 2010. Ironically, Arniel was replaced by the person he replaced in Columbus, Claude Noël. During the same off-season, Keane&#x27;s contract was not renewed and his #12 jersey was later retired on Mike Keane Tribute Night, February 12, 2011. During the 2011 playoffs, the Moose came back from a three games to one deficit to the Lake Erie Monsters in the first round to advance. They fell behind three games to one again in round two, this time to the Hamilton Bulldogs, and came back to force a seventh game. However, the Bulldogs took the series with a 2–1 win in triple overtime in the longest Game 7 in AHL history.

During their first tenure in the AHL, the Moose were one of the league&#x27;s most successful franchises. Home game attendance was consistently among the best in the league, including an average of 8,404 per game during the 2010–2011 season. The organization was also popular with the players, as the Moose &quot;had the reputation of being run like an NHL club&quot;. League president and CEO David Andrews called the Moose &quot;a flagship franchise for the AHL&quot;.

====2011–2015: St. John&#x27;s IceCaps====

On May 31, 2011, Mark Chipman announced True North Sports and Entertainment&#x27;s acquisition of the NHL&#x27;s Atlanta Thrashers with the intent of relocating the team to Winnipeg for the 2011–12 season. The return of NHL hockey to the city prompted the organization to find a new home for the AHL franchise. A deal with former Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador Danny Williams was quickly negotiated to relocate the team to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador and swiftly approved by the AHL Board of Governors. The Moose brand was dropped in consideration of Newfoundland&#x27;s history of fatal vehicle collisions involving the titanical animal; instead, the team was renamed the St. John&#x27;s IceCaps. The IceCaps were then named new AHL affiliate of the Winnipeg Jets, ending the AHL team&#x27;s ten-year affiliation with the Vancouver Canucks.

The success of the franchise continued in St. John&#x27;s. Attendance at Mile One Centre was strong; the IceCaps enjoyed the second longest home sellout streak in league history at 120 games between 2011 and 2014. In 2011–12, the IceCaps won their division and advanced as far as the conference final. In 2013–14, the IceCaps advanced to the Calder Cup finals for the second time in franchise history, but lost to the Texas Stars in five games.

====2015–present: Return to Manitoba====
As early as January 2014, True North Sports and Entertainment confirmed intentions to move its AHL franchise closer to Winnipeg, with Thunder Bay, Ontario as the preferred destination. Although the agreement with Williams&#x27; group had been extended through 2016, the two sides terminated the deal after Williams negotiated an agreement to bring the Montreal Canadiens AHL affiliate, Hamilton Bulldogs, to St. John&#x27;s for the 2015–16 season. The IceCaps&#x27; trademarks were retained by Williams&#x27; group and transferred to the incoming franchise.

As a new arena in Thunder Bay was not forthcoming, True North Sports and Entertainment&#x27;s AHL franchise returned to Winnipeg for the 2015–16 season and once again became the Manitoba Moose Hockey Club. Slight changes to the former logo were unveiled, as well as a new colour scheme similar to that of the Jets. Keith McCambridge, who had been with the franchise since 2009, remained as head coach.

After one season in Manitoba and missing the playoffs for the second straight season, McCambridge was released by the organization and replaced by Jets assistant coach Pascal Vincent. The Moose missed the playoffs again in Vincent&#x27;s first season, but a much improved performance during the 2017–18 season returned the Moose to playoffs again. Vincent was awarded the Louis A.R. Pieri Memorial Award for AHL coach of the year, while players Sami Niku and Mason Appleton also captured major awards. Vincent stepped down as head coach following the shortened 2020–21 season and was replaced by Mark Morrison, who was previously an assistant coach with the team from 2011 to 2017.

==Team information==

===Logos and uniforms===
The current Manitoba Moose uniforms are similar to those of the Winnipeg Jets, whose colours are polar night blue, aviator blue, silver, and white. However, unlike the Jets, the Moose wear their white uniforms for home games in accordance with AHL rules. During their IHL days, the Moose colours were purple, green, and copper. The team switched to teal, copper, and black after joining the AHL.

The original Minnesota Moose logo, depicting a Moose holding a hockey stick, was carried over when the team moved from Minnesota in 1996. The logo was slightly altered in 2001 to match the team&#x27;s new colour scheme. A new logo created by Milwaukee-based graphic designer David Mann was introduced in 2004 (coinciding with the team&#x27;s move from Winnipeg Arena to MTS Centre), which the team used until 2011. The Moose returned to a similar logo upon returning to the AHL in 2015, albeit with an altered colour scheme and other slight changes in order to conform with the Winnipeg Jets brand.

===Mascot===
Mick E. Moose debuted as the mascot of the Manitoba Moose in 1996. The Winnipeg Jets &quot;recalled&quot; him from the AHL in 2011 to become their mascot following the departure of the Moose to St. John&#x27;s. He has served as the official mascot for both teams since 2015. Aside from hockey games, Mick E. Moose makes approximately 100 public appearances each year at various community events.

===Media===
680 CJOB airs select Moose games on radio and streams all games on the internet. Daniel Fink is the team&#x27;s Manager of Hockey Communications and play-by-play broadcaster. Fink began calling Moose games in 2019, taking over from Mitch Peacock (2015-2019). TSN Radio 1290 (CFRW) held broadcasting rights from 2015 to 2020. CJOB previously held radio broadcast rights from 1996 to 2011, with Kelly Moore (1996–2006) and Brian Munz (2006–2011) as play-by-play announcers.

CKY-TV previously televised select Moose games from 1996 to 1999, and A-Channel aired select games during the 2000-01 season. For the 2022 Calder Cup playoffs, home playoff games were televised on TSN.

===Venue===
The Manitoba Moose play their home games at Canada Life Centre (previously the MTS Centre and Bell MTS Place), which they share with the Winnipeg Jets, and are currently one of two AHL clubs (the other being the Calgary Wranglers) to share a home arena with its NHL parent club. Although the arena seats 15,321 for hockey, only the lower bowl (which seats 8,812) is open for most Moose games. Practices and training sessions are usually held at Bell MTS Iceplex. The Moose briefly relocated to the Iceplex from March to May 2021 when COVID-19 pandemic protocols made the regular home arena unsuitable for hosting multiple clubs.

The team played at the Winnipeg Arena prior to the opening of Canada Life Centre in November 2004.

<text>The AMC Amitron was an experimental electric subcompact car built in 1967 by American Motors Corporation (AMC) and Gulton Industries. It included many advanced features, including regenerative braking and advanced battery designs, to provide a range on a single charge. Development ended because of technology issues and the high cost of batteries.

In 1977, the prototype was updated and renamed Electron to become one of the automaker&#x27;s &quot;Concept 80&quot; show cars.

American Motors&#x27; small concept car was &quot;meant to be a prediction of future subcompact commuter cars.&quot; It introduced technologies that included a revolutionary braking system that took 50 years to become common in the automotive industry.

==Design==

===Impetus===
Development of the Amitron was prompted by three bills passed by the 89th United States Congress, described collectively as the &quot;Electric Vehicle Development Act of 1966&quot;, as well as a fourth bill that amended the Clean Air Act of 1963. The legislation provided funding for electric car research in response to the rapidly decreasing air quality caused by automobile emissions. Development of electric vehicles was undertaken by the domestic big three automobile manufacturers, as well as AMC. Electrically powered cars were also seen as a way for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on &quot;expensive, undependable oil imports.&quot;

===Powertrain===
American Motors entered into a partnership with Gulton Industries of Metuchen, New Jersey (acquired by Mark IV Industries in 1986) to develop the battery and power handling electronics for the car. Their entry into the electric car market was significantly more advanced than other developments, including two types of batteries for fast and slow power release and charging, as well as regenerative brakes to help extend range.&lt;

The primary power source consisted of two lithium-nickel-fluoride batteries rated at 150 watt-hours per pound, or 331 watt-hours per kilogram, with a total capacity of 22.5 kWh. The designers selected lithium for the Amitron because &quot;it is both highly reactive (easy to oxidize) and has high electromotive potential.&quot; The downside to these batteries is that they have relatively low instantaneous power, too little to provide reasonable acceleration, or be able to handle the rapid recharging during regenerative braking. A secondary power source consisting of two nickel-cadmium (NiCd, often read ni-cad) batteries was used to handle higher power peaks. These batteries could accelerate the car to in 20 seconds. During driving, the lithium batteries recharged the ni-cads, which continued to power the motor.

The regenerative system would automatically switch the drive motors to generators as the car slowed so that the ni-cads could recharge, thus increasing the range of the car. The regenerative braking control was designed &quot;to provide the same brake pedal &quot;feel&quot; as a conventional car. This was the first use of regenerative braking technology in the U.S. automobile industry.

Altogether, the system provided the car with a range of when traveling at . Its total battery weight of only was also light for electric vehicles. The equivalent in lead-acid cells would weigh nearly a ton (907 kg). A solid-state power management system controlled the entire system.

The first road tests of the batteries and powertrain were in 1968 using a converted conventional Rambler American sedan. At the time, AMC&#x27;s vice president of design, Dick Teague, was working on a car called &quot;the Voltswagon&quot;. The supporters of the Amitron were confident and stated that &quot;We don&#x27;t see a major obstacle in the technology. It&#x27;s just a matter of time.&quot;

===Body===
The Amitron was designed to minimize power loss by keeping down rolling resistance, wind drag resistance, and vehicle weight. The prototype was a snub-snouted three-passenger urban area vehicle or city car with an overall length of only . Among its unique design features were passenger seats that had air-filled cushions, rather than conventional polyurethane (foam rubber). The car did not feature conventional bodyside doors, but the canopy of the vehicle was hinged up and backward (&quot;clamshell-type&quot; on rear-mounted pivots) for entry and egress.

American Motors put more effort into making its prototype electric car more attractive than its competitors. &quot;The modern looking Amitron was one of the most promising electrics developed in the Sixties.&quot; During the December 1967 public introduction of the car, Roy D. Chapin Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of AMC, stated that the Amitron &quot;could eliminate many problems that up to this point have made electric-type cars impractical&quot;.

===Potential market===
American Motors&#x27; original plans were to offer the Amitron for sale to commuters and urban shoppers in five years. Chapin said AMC had discussed the venture with its bankers and creditors, and &quot;they are about as enthusiastic about it&quot;. The Amitron was also well received by the public. The new technology was still in the infant stage and it was not expected to be popular &quot;until the end of the decade.&quot; Competitors were also skeptical of AMC&#x27;s rapid deployment, stating it would take ten years to have a practical battery. Moreover, research programs to develop clean transportation in the U.S. ceased. The Amitron did not go beyond the prototype stage. The expensive batteries forced AMC to halt further experiments with advanced technology electric vehicles for several years.

===Legacy===

The AMC Pacer was influenced by the Amitron&#x27;s short, wide dimensions, along with optionally including three front seats. The abruptly terminating rear end of the concept car influenced the AMC Gremlin.

American Motors&#x27; battery-powered vehicle development continued under a partnership with Gould (Gould Electronics after selling its battery operations) that led to the mass production of the Jeep DJ-5E starting in 1974. This rear-wheel-drive mini-delivery van was also known as the Electruck. Regenerative braking was effective at speeds above and the system included current-limiting to prevent overcharging the lead-acid batteries.

In 1977, AMC introduced their &quot;Concept 80&quot; line of experimental vehicles, which included the AM Van, Grand Touring, Concept I, Concept II, and Jeep II. Along with this lineup, AMC renamed the Amitron to Electron, added side-view mirrors to the windows, and gave it a fresh paint job. The show car was not driveable because it did not have a power train.

The design has been characterized by some observers as &quot;hot, sexy, cute and practical.&quot; The exterior&#x27;s angular design was also ahead of its time because it was not until the 1970s that wedge-shaped bodies were finally adopted for production cars. The Amitron featured a polygonal exterior design that &quot;looks like a miniature Cybertruck&quot; that was unveiled in late 2019 by Tesla, Inc.

The AMC car &quot;laid down principles that looked to represent the future of urban travel, but it was just too advanced for its own good.&quot; &quot;The AMC Amitron had almost 50 years ago all that is still considered indispensable for an electric car if it is supposed to succeed: a decent range, low weight, and a jaunty look.&quot;

<text>The Vrbas (, ) is a major river with a length of , in western Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is a right tributary of the Sava river. The city of Banja Luka is located on the river banks.

The river is the main watercourse of Banja Luka and before Banja Luka. With its blue-green color, it&#x27;s one of the most beautiful rivers in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;vrba&quot; means &#x27;willow&#x27; in Serbo-Croatian, and a number of weeping willow trees adorn the river banks in Banja Luka.

It lent its name to one of the provinces (banovinas) of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Vrbas Banovina.

==Tributaries==
The most important right tributaries are the Desna river, the Ugar, and the Vrbanja, and left: Prusačka river, Semešnica, the Pliva, the Crna Rijeka (Black River), and the Suturlija, which are located in the middle part of the basin.

==Geography and sectioning==
It is a right tributary of the river Sava. It is one of the largest rivers in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

=== Upper Vrbas ===
The Vrbas river appears at the southern slope of the Vranica mountain near the town of Gornji Vakuf, at around above sea level and it drains central part of the northern slopes of the Dinaric mountain massif. The Upper Vrbas is a section between its source and town of Jajce, encompassing entire valley between Bugojno, Gornji Vakuf-Uskoplje and Donji Vakuf, and gorge between Donji Vakuf and Jajce.

=== Middle Vrbas ===
Middle Vrbas mostly comprises a canyon section, with steep slopes and narrow passages, between Jajce and Banja Luka.

=== Lower Vrbas ===
The Lower Vrbas is the last section of the river, passing through lowlands of Lijevče Polje, approaching the Sava River. It empties into the Sava river at around above sea level. Total length of the main watercourse is around .

==Climate==
Average annual rainfall is around 800 L/m2 at the mouth of the Vrbas to the Sava river and up to 1500 L/m2 in the southern part of the basin. Characteristic mean flow is around 34.6 L/s/km2. Maximum rainfall occurs in the southern parts of the Vrbas basin in the late autumn and winter months, with minimum quantities in summer, whereas the northern parts of the basin receive the largest quantities of rain during the summer months (June–July), with the maximum in November and December.

==Ichthyofauna==
The Vrbas basin is known for an abundant ichthyofauna, rich in species, and recreational and fly fishing are very popular on entire cours of the river. Especially important but critically endangered is huchen, variation of hucho species endemic for the river Danube basin (hence known as Danube Salmon or Danube Taimen; Lat. Hucho hucho). Of all the Vrbas tributaries only the river Vrbanja, and possibly Ugar, also retain healthy population of this endemic fish. Vrbas are headwaters are important spawning grounds for both, huchen and its prey, Common nase (Chondrostoma nasus) and Grayling (Thymallus thymallus).

==Tourism and recreation==
Rafting is very popular on the Vrbas. It is also one of the most popular form of recreation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The main attraction of the area is Vrbas canyon.

In 2005, the European Championships in Rafting were held on the Vrbas and the Tara rivers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to the International Rafting Federation, the event was hugely successful. In May 2009 the World Rafting Championships were held again in Bosnia and Herzegovina on the Vrbas and Tara rivers.

<text>The Neretva (, ), also known as Narenta, is one of the largest rivers of the eastern part of the Adriatic basin. Four hydroelectric power plants with large dams (higher than 15 metres) provide flood protection, electricity and water storage. The Neretva is recognized for its natural environment and diverse landscapes.

Freshwater ecosystems have suffered from an increasing population and the associated development pressures. One of the most valuable natural resources of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia is its freshwater resource, contained by an abundant wellspring and clear rivers. Situated between the major regional rivers (Drina river on the east, Una river on the west and the Sava river) the Neretva basin contains the most significant source of drinking water.

The Neretva is notable among rivers of the Dinaric Alps region, especially regarding its diverse ecosystems and habitats, flora and fauna, cultural and historic heritage.

Its name has been suggested to come from the Indo-European root *ner, meaning &quot;to dive&quot;. The same root is seen in the Serbo-Croatian root &quot;roniti&quot;.

== Geography and hydrology ==
The Neretva flows through Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia before reaching the Adriatic Sea. It is the largest karst river in the Dinaric Alps in the eastern part of the Adriatic basin/watershed. Its total length is , of which are in Bosnia and Herzegovina, while the final are in the Dubrovnik-Neretva County of Croatia.

The Neretva watershed is in total; in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the addition of the Trebišnjica river watershed and in Croatia, . The average discharge at profile Žitomislići in Bosnia and Herzegovina is /s and at the mouth in Croatia is /s in addition to the Trebišnjica River&#x27;s /s. The Trebišnjica River basin is included in the Neretva watershed due to a physical link of the two basins by the porous karst terrain.

The hydrological parameters of Neretva are regularly monitored in Croatia at Metković.

=== Sections ===
Geographically and hydrologically the Neretva is divided into three sections.

Its source and headwaters gorge are situated deep in the Dinaric Alps at the base of the Zelengora and Lebršnik mountains, specifically under the Gredelj saddle. The river source is at 1,227 meters above sea level and consists of five small and distinct wellsprings. On its 90 kilometers course through the first section the Neretva cuts two distinct deep and narrow canyons and two distinct wide and fertile valleys, around Ulog and then Župa Komska, wider area around Glavatičevo, before it reaches town of Konjic. This section is also better known as the Upper Neretva (), and here river flows generally from east-southeast to north-northwest as do most Bosnia and Herzegovina rivers belonging to the Danube watershed, and covers some with an average elevation of 1.2%. Right below Konjic, the Neretva again expands into a third and largest valley which provided fertile agricultural land before it was flooded by large artificial reservoir, Jablaničko Lake, formed after construction of a Jablanica Dam near town of Jablanica.

The second section begins from the confluence of the Neretva and the Rama between Konjic and Jablanica where the Neretva suddenly takes almost 180° degrees turn toward east-southeast and flows the short leg before reaches town of Jablanica, from which point turns again toward south. From Jablanica, the Neretva enters third and the largest canyon on its course, running through the steep slopes mountains of Prenj, Čvrsnica and Čabulja reaching in depth. Three hydroelectric dams operate between Jablanica and Mostar.

When the Neretva expands for the second and final time, it reaches its third section. This area is often colloquially called the &quot;Bosnian and Herzegovinian California&quot;. The last of its course forms wide alluvial delta, before the river empties into the Adriatic Sea.
=== Tributaries ===
Rivers of the Tatinac (also known as the Jezernica), the Gornji Krupac and Donji Krupac, the Ljuta (also known as the Dindolka), the Jesenica, the Bjelimićka Rijeka, the Slatinica, the Račica, the Rakitnica, the Ljuta (Konjička), the Trešanica, the Neretvica, the Rama, Doljanka, the Drežanka, the Grabovica, the Radobolja, and the Trebižat flow into the Neretva from the right, while the Jezernica, the Živanjski Potok (also known as the Živašnica), the Lađanica, the Krupac, the Bukovica, the Šištica with its Šištica Waterfall, the Bijela, the Idbar, the Glogošnica, the Mostarska Bijela, the Buna, the Bregava, and the Krupa flow into it from the left.
=== Towns and villages ===
Towns and villages on the Neretva include Ulog, Glavatičevo, Konjic, Čelebići, Ostrožac, Jablanica, Grabovica, Drežnica, Bijelo polje, Vrapčići, Mostar, Buna village, the historical town of Blagaj, Žitomislići, the historical village of Počitelj, Tasovčići, Čapljina, and Gabela in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and Metković, Opuzen, Komin, Rogotin, and Ploče in Croatia. The biggest town on the Neretva River is Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

== Upper Neretva ==

The upper course of the Neretva river is simply called the Upper Neretva &quot; ()&quot;. It includes numerous streams and well-springs, three major glacial lakes near the river and more lakes scattered across the mountains of Treskavica and Zelengora in the wider area, mountains, peaks and forests, flora and fauna of the area.
The Upper Neretva has water of Class I purity. Rising from the base of the Zelengora and Lebršnik Mountain, Neretva headwaters run in undisturbed rapids and waterfalls, carving steep gorges reaching in depth.

=== Rakitnica River ===

The Rakitnica is the main tributary of the first section &quot;()&quot;. The Rakitnica River forms a long canyon, out of its length, that stretches between Bjelašnica and Visočica to the southeast from Sarajevo.
From the canyon, a hiking trail along the ridge of the Rakitnica canyon drops 800 m below, to the famous village of Lukomir. The village is the only remaining traditional semi-nomadic Bosniak mountain village in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
At almost 1,500 m, Lukomir features stone homes with cherry-wood roof tiles. It is the country&#x27;s highest and most isolated mountain village. The village is inaccessible from the first snows in December until late April and sometimes even later, except by skis or on foot.

==Middle Neretva==

Hydrographically the Middle Neretva section begins from the town of Konjic, but after the construction of Jablanica Hydroelectric Power Station and flooding of the large fertile valley between Konjic and Jablanica, known simply as &quot;Neretva&quot; since Middle Ages. The new point for hydrographical division became the dam of the Jablanica HPP where there also is a place of confluence of the rivers Neretva and Rama. Here the Neretva river suddenly takes an almost 180° turn towards the east-southeast and flows for a short leg before it reaches the town of Jablanica. From this point it turns again toward the south and enters the third and largest canyon on its course, running through the steep slopes of the mountains of Prenj, Čvrsnica, and Čabulja, reaching between in depth. This section is characterized by a steep and relatively narrow canyon, and rugged karstic geology and hydrology.

Four enormous vale-size rifts appear in the mountainsides forming canyon walls, two from each side of the river, intersecting with the main canyon almost perpendicularly. The Neretva receives only four small streams in this section, all running through these side vales, which are relatively short. Going downstream from Jablanica, the first two from each side are the Glogošnica stream, its eponymous canyon and small village on the left, and the Grabovica stream with its eponymous canyon and historical village, from the right side. Further downstream two much larger vales appear again on each side, first on the right the stream of Drežanka and its large and steep valley, with two eponymous villages, Donja (Lower) and Gornja (Upper) Drežnica, and than Mostarska Bijela, as one of the most pristine vales in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with its eponymous uniquely characteristic subterranean stream, embedded deep into the Prenj mountain, on the left.

Although these streams are of low outflow, there are also numerous wellsprings rising on both sides of the canyon at the river banks, with high-capacity discharge.
Three large hydroelectric power stations operate in this section of the Neretva, between Jablanica and Mostar, namely Grabovica HPP, Salakovac HPP and Mostar HPP.

=== Lakes ===

Jablanica lake is a large artificial lake on the Neretva river, right below Konjic where the Neretva expands into a wide valley. The river provided fertile, agricultural land before the lake flooded most of it. The lake was created in 1953 after construction of a large gravitational hydroelectric dam near Jablanica in central Bosnia and Herzegovina. The lake has an irregular, elongated shape, and its width varies along its length. The lake is a popular vacation destination.

== Lower Neretva ==
Downstream from the confluence of its tributaries, the Trebižat and Bregava Rivers, the valley spreads into an alluvial fan covering . The upper valley, the 7,411 hectares in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is called Hutovo Blato.

===Hutovo Blato wetlands===

The Neretva Delta has been recognised as a Ramsar site since 1992, and Hutovo Blato since 2001. Both areas form one integrated Ramsar site that is a natural entity divided by the state border. The Important Bird Areas programme, conducted by Birdlife International, covers protected areas in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Since 1995, Hutovo Blato has been protected as &quot;Hutovo Blato Nature Park&quot; and managed by a public authority. The whole zone is protected from human impact and provides habitat for many plants and animals. The historical site Old Fortress Hutovo Blato is in the Nature Park.

Gornje Blato-Deransko Lake is supplied by the karstic water sources of the Trebišnjica River, emerging from bordering hills. It is hydro-geologically connected to the Neretva River through its effluent, the Krupa River, formed out of five lakes (Škrka, Deranja, Jelim, Orah, Drijen). Large portions are permanently flooded and isolated by wide groves of reedbebds and trees. It represents a more interesting preserved area.
====Krupa River====

The Krupa River is a Neretva left tributary and the main water current of Hutovo Blato, which carries the waters from Gornje Blato and Svitavsko Lake into the Neretva River. The length of Krupa is with an average depth of . The Krupa does not have a specific source, but is an arm of Deransko Lake. Also, the Krupa is a unique river in Europe, because it flows both ways. It flows both towards and back from its mouth. This happens when a high water level causes Neretva to push Krupa in the opposite direction.

=== Neretva Delta wetlands ===

Passing towns and villages in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Neretva spills out into the Adriatic Sea, building a wetland delta that is listed under the Ramsar Convention as internationally important.

In this lower alluvial valley in Croatia, the Neretva River splinters into multiple courses, creating a delta covering approximately 12,000 hectares. The delta in Croatia has been reduced by extensive land reclamation projects, reducing the river flows to just three branches from the original twelve. The marshes, lagoons and lakes that once dotted this plain have disappeared and only fragments of the old Mediterranean wetlands survive. Wetlands, marshes and lagoons, lakes, beaches, rivers, hummocks (limestone hills) and mountains compose the delta, with five protected areas with a total area of 1,620 ha. These are ornithological, ichthyologic and landscape reserves.

== Endemic and endangered species ==
Dinaric karst water systems support 25% of the total of 546 fish species in Europe, many endemic.
The Neretva River, together with four other areas in the Mediterranean, has the largest number of threatened freshwater fish species.
The degree of endemism in the karst ecoregion is greater than 10%. Multiple fish species have small habitats and are vulnerable, so they are included on the Red List of endangered fish . The Adriatic basin has 88 species of fish, of which 44 are Mediterranean endemic species, and 41 are Adriatic endemic species. More than half of the Adriatic river basin species of fish inhabit the Neretva, the Ombla, the Trebišnjica, the Morača Rivers and their tributaries, and more than 30 are endemic.

=== Invasive species ===

A pike perch (&quot;Sander lucioperca&quot; Linnaeus 1758) (also see &quot;Sander&quot; (genus)) population in the Neretva River watershed was observed in 1990 for the first time. The Rama River, a right tributary of the Neretva, and its Rama Lake received an unknown quantity of this allochthonous species. Population estimates have increased in the Neretva accumulation lakes. This fact confirms previous scientific assumptions of Škrijelj (1991, 1995), who predicted the possibility of pike perch displacement (migration) from Ramsko Lake to the Rama River and then further downstream to the river and its lakes.
In 1990 the perch population made up 1.95% of the fish population in Rama Lake. Within a decade this rose to 25.42% in the nearby Jablaničko Lake.

The fast pace of pike perch population growth and displacements is expected to match the environmental conditions from the mid-ecological valence of this fish.
In this sense, it is the established continuous and accelerated growth of the population dynamics of pike perch in Jablaničko Lake, a relatively good representation in Salakovačko Lake and the beginning of growth of population in Grabovičko Lake.
Parallel with the increase in pike perch is a decrease in endemic indigenous species like European chub also white chub (&quot;Squalius cephalus&quot;), and the disappearance of rare and endemic species like Adriatic Dace also Balkan dace (&quot;Squalius svallize&quot; also &quot;Leuciscus svallize&quot; Heckel &amp; Kner 1858), Neretvan softmouth trout (&quot;Salmothymus obtusirostris oxyrhinchus&quot; Steind.) and marble trout (&quot;Salmo marmoratus&quot; Cuv.).

Pike perch causes clearly visible, negative effects on the autochthonous species in Jablaničko Lake. In Salakovačko Lake these effects are in progress, although less visible, while in Grabovičko Lake it is not yet clearly visible.

=== Salmonids ===



Salmonid fish from the Neretva basin show considerable variation in morphology, ecology and behaviour.

Among most endangered are three endemic species of trout: Neretvan softmouth trout (&quot;Salmothymus obtusirostris oxyrhinchus&quot; Steind.), Toothtrout &quot;(Salmo dentex)&quot;
and marble trout &quot;(Salmo marmoratus Cuv.)&quot;.

All three endemic trout species of the Neretva are endangered, mostly due to the habitat destruction or construction of large/major dams (&quot;large&quot; is higher than 15–20 m; &quot;major&quot; is over 150–250 m). Other problems include hybridization or genetic pollution with introduced, non-native trouts, illegal fishing and poor water and fisheries management.

=== Cyprinids ===

The most endangered cyprinids (family Cyprinidae) are endemic.

Especially interesting are five &quot;Phoxinellus&quot; (sub)species that inhabit isolated karstic plains (fields) of eastern as well as western Herzegovina in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which eventually reach the Neretva watershed and/or coastal drainages of south-eastern Dalmatia.

* Karst minnow (&quot;Phoxinellus metohiensis&quot;) is considered Vulnerable (VU).
* South Dalmatian minnow (&quot;Phoxinellus pstrossii&quot;) is threatened, but was marked Data Deficient (DD) and was not designated on IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Version 2009.1.
* Dalmatian minnow (&quot;Phoxinellus ghetaldii&quot;) is considered vulnerable.
* Adriatic minnow (&quot;Phoxinellus alepidotus&quot;) is endemic to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia and occurs in lowland water bodies with little current. It is threatened due to pollution and habitat destruction. It is considered endangered.
* Spotted minnow (&quot;Phoxinellus adspersus&quot;), is endemic in the Tihaljina River, which is fed by underground waters from Imotsko field and is connected to the Trebižat river via the Mlada River. It also occurs in Mostarsko Blato wetlands. Fish were found in the source of the Norin River, a right-hand tributary of the lower Neretva at Metković, in Croatia, at Kuti Lake, a left-hand tributary of the lower Neretva, at Imotsko field in Red Lake (Croatia) and the Vrljika river drainage and near Vrgorac in the Matica River system. It is considered vulnerable.
* Minnow-nase (&quot;Chondrostoma phoxinus&quot;) is considered Endangered (EN)
* Neretvan nase (also Dalmatian nase and Dalmatian soiffe) (&quot;Chondrostoma knerii&quot;) is endemic to the Neretva. Neretvan nase is mainly distributed in the lower parts and delta, the Krupa River, Nature Park Hutovo Blato wetlands and Neretva Delta wetlands. It occurs in water bodies with little current. It is threatened by habitat destruction and pollution. It is considered Endangered (EN).
* Adriatic dace also Balkan dace (&quot;Squalius svallize&quot; also &quot;Leuciscus svallize&quot; Heckel &amp; Kner 1858) is a vulnerable endemic, although also found in Montenegro and Albania. Adults inhabit water bodies on the low plains, with little current and in lakes. They feed on invertebrates. It is threatened due to pollution, habitat destruction and due to introduction of other species.
* Illyrian dace (&quot;Squalius illyricus&quot; also &quot;Leuciscus illyricus&quot; Heckel &amp; Kner 1858) inhabits karstic waters of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Albania. It occurs in water courses on low plains, with little current. It feeds on invertebrates. It is stressed by habitat destruction, pollution and introduced species. It is considered Near Threatened (NT).
* Turskyi dace (&quot;Leuciscus turskyi&quot; also &quot;Squalius turskyi turskyi&quot; and &quot;Telestes turskyi&quot;) inhabits karstic waters, lake Buško Blato and the Krka and Čikola rivers. It occurs on the low plains, with little current and in lakes. It feeds on invertebrates. Threats include water abstraction and pollution. It is considered Critically Endangered (CR).
* Dalmatian barbelgudgeon (&quot;Aulopyge hugeli&quot;) inhabits karstic streams of Glamocko field, Livanjsko field and Duvanjsko field, lakes Buško Blato, Blidinje and Cetina, Krka and Zrmanja river drainages. It occurs in lentic waters and feeds on plants. The fish is threatened by water pollution and habitat destruction and is considered endangered. It is migratory in Livanjsko field.

=== Cobitidae ===

The Neretvan spined loach (Cobitis narentana Karaman, 1928) is an Adriatic watershed endemic that inhabits a narrow area of the Neretva watershed in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina it inhabits only the lower Neretva and its smaller tributaries like the Matica River.
In Croatia it is a strictly protected species and inhabits only the Neretva delta and its smaller tributaries, the (Norin) and lake systems of the Neretva delta (Baćina lakes, Kuti, Desne, Modro oko). It is considered Vulnerable (VU).

=== Neretva delta endemics ===

The Neretva delta hosts more than 20 endemic species, of which 18 are endemic to the Adriatic watershed, along with three endemic species in Croatia. Nearly half (45%) of the total number of species that inhabit this area are included in one of the categories of threat and are mainly endemic.

== Hydroelectric controversy ==
The benefits brought by hydroelectric dams have come at an environmental and social cost.
The waters of the Neretva river with its two main tributaries, the Rama and the Trebišnjica, are already harnessed by nine Hydroelectric power plants with large dams, four on the Neretva&#x27;s main stream, one with a major dam on the Rama tributary, and another four on the Trebišnjica River (one of these being in Croatia).
These facilities are as follows: 

*on the Neretva: Jablanica Hydroelectric Power Station, Grabovica Hydroelectric Power Station, Salakovac Hydroelectric Power Station, Mostar Hydroelectric Power Station;
* on the Rama: Rama Hydroelectric Power Station;
* on the Trebišnjica: Trebinje-1 Hydroelectric Power Station, Trebinje-2 Hydroelectric Power Station, Čapljina Hydroelectric Power Station, Dubrovnik Hydroelectric Power Station &quot;(in Croatia)&quot;.

There are additionally a number of hydroelectric power station of various capacities on smaller tributaries, such as Mostarsko Blato Hydroelectric Power Station on the Lištica (downstream from HPP named Jasenica), Peć Mlini Hydroelectric Power Station on the Trebižat, and numerous small hydro projects on the small river tributaries like Tatinac, Trešanica, Neretvica and Duščica, with a proposed small hydro on the rivers Doljanka, Glogošnica, and one abandoned on the Idbar.

===Projects in Upper Neretva===
The government of the Bosnia and Herzegovina has unveiled plans to build three more hydroelectric power plants with dams over 150.5 metres in height upstream from the existing plants, beginning with Glavaticevo Hydro Power Plant in the village of Glavatičevo, then going upstream to Bjelimići Hydro Power Plant and Ljubuča Hydro Power Plant located near the eponymous villages; and another, by the Republic of Srpska, at the Neretva headwaters gorge, near the source of the river. It is similarly opposed by environmental organizations and NGO&#x27;s, such as Zeleni-Neretva Konjic and the World Wildlife Fund.

Meanwhile, Bosnia and Herzegovina entity, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was preparing a parallel plan to form a large, protected area as a national park which would include the entire region of Gornja Neretva &quot;()&quot;, and have within the park the three hydroelectric plants. The latest idea is that the park should be divided in two, where the Neretva should be excluded from both and would become the boundary between parks. Those who oppose the plan wish to have the area turned into the &quot;National Park of Upper Neretva&quot; and would leave the park without substantial development.

===Projects in Ulog===
Since the 2000&#x27;s, the other entity of Bosnia, Republica Srpska, has developed plans to construct up to eight Hydroelectric power plants, seven small hydroelectric power plants, and one large, namely &quot;HE Ulog&quot;, on the stretch of the Neretva with high ecological value, which lies within the entity&#x27;s administrative lines. This stretch consists of around 40 kilometers of the course of the Neretva between its source and the entity boundary at Ljusići village. Opposition to these plans, and ongoing construction of &quot;HE Ulog&quot; in particular, attracted both domestic and international experts, activists and public, who voiced their opposition with scientific arguments, even taking the issue to European Council. Irregularities in planning and design, the flawed environmental impact study and the complete absence of research work on the ground related to the geological instability of the terrain, as well as irregularities in the implementation of tenders and the issuance of environmental and construction permits, are particularly noteworthy. In the environmental impact study, the only significant impact, one that should be reflected on the downstream part of the Neretva watercourse, is completely ignored. Such drastic disregard in planning and designing, considering that the facilities of &quot;HE Ulog&quot; are located on the very line of demarcation of two ethnically based entities, which makes the downstream of the river located entirely in another administrative entity, where all the ecological consequences resulting from the use of Neretva water and the production of electricity will be felt exclusively, introduces, besides environmental, also an ethnic and political dimension to the issue.

===The Upper Horizons - Trebišnjica===
In recent times the Republic of Srpska government finished the project named &quot;The Upper Horizons&quot; (), a large hydroelectric project that diverted underground waters in the Neretva watershed to the Trebišnjica plant and others in the Trebišnjica basin. This project was opposed by NGO&#x27;s in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. They argued that the project would increase salinity levels of every surface and underground water on the right bank of the Neretva, damage internationally recognized &quot;Ramsar sites&quot;, a protected &quot;Nature Park Hutovo Blato&quot; in Bosnia and Herzegovina, protected Neretva Delta in Croatia, and important reservoirs of freshwater, plus agricultural lands in the lower Neretva valley.

== Cultural and historical significance ==
=== Early history ===
During antiquity, the Neretva was known as Narenta, Narona and Naro(n), and was the inland home to the ancient Illyrian tribe of Ardiaei. They became ship builders, seafarers and fishermen. Archaeological discoveries of Illyrian culture dealt both with daily and religious life such as the discovery of ancient Illyrian shipwrecks found in Hutovo Blato, in the vicinity of the Neretva River.

After intense excavations in the area of Hutovo Blato in the autumn of 2008, archaeologists from Bosnia and Herzegovina University of Mostar and Sweden University of Lund found traces of an Illyrian trading post that was more than two thousand years old.
The find is unique in a European perspective and archaeologists have concluded that Desilo, as the location is called, was an important trading post of great significance for contact between the Illyrians and the Romans.
Archaeological finds include the ruins of a settlement, the remains of a harbour that probably functioned as a trading post, as well as many sunken boats, fully laden with wine pitchers – so-called &quot;amphorae&quot; – from the 1st century BC.
Archaeologist Adam Lindhagen claimed that it was the most important Illyrian ruin.

=== Roman period ===
One of the most significant monuments of Roman times in Bosnia and Herzegovina is Mogorjelo. Located 1 kilometer south of the town of Čapljina, Mogorjelo remnants of the old Roman suburban &quot;Villa Rustica&quot; from the 4th century represents ancient Roman agricultural production and estate, mills, bakeries, olive oil refinery and forges.
The Villa was destroyed in the middle of the 4th century, during the invasion of western Goths. Surviving residents did not restore it to its original splendor.
The name of Mogorjelo is thought to be derived either from the Slavic word for &quot;burn&quot; (Slavic – goriti) or that at the end of the 5th century the church was built on the ruins of the Villa, and was dedicated to &quot;St. Hermagor – Mogoru&quot;.

=== Middle Ages ===

In the Early Middle Ages, the South Slavic Narentines held the region. They were known for piracy and resisted Christianization until they were defeated by the Venetians, and then the Byzantines, at the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries.

Gabela is a rich archaeological site on the Neretva bank, situated south of Čapljina. Along with notable medieval buildings, remains of &quot;Old City&quot; walls, and a sculpture of a &quot;stone lion&quot; – a symbol of Venetian culture survived.

=== Ottoman period ===

The Old Bridge was commissioned by Suleiman the Magnificent in 1557 to replace an older wooden suspension bridge. Construction began in 1557 and took nine years: according to the inscription the bridge was completed in 974 AH, corresponding to the period between 19 July 1566 and 7 July 1567. Memories and legends and the name of the builder, Mimar Hayruddin (student of the Old/Great Sinan (Mimar Sinan / Koca Sinan), the Ottoman architect) were preserved in writing. Charged under pain of death to construct a bridge of such unprecedented dimensions, the architect reportedly prepared for his own funeral on the day the scaffolding was finally removed from the completed structure. Upon its completion it was the widest man-made arch in the world. Associated technical issues remain obscure: how the scaffolding was erected, how the stone was transported from one bank to the other, and how the scaffolding was maintained during construction. On 9 November 1993, during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina it was destroyed by sustained artillery shelling. After the war, immediate plans were raised to reconstruct the bridge as a symbol of peace and ethnic harmony, literally bridging the two sides of the conflict. They attempted to reuse as much original material as possible. Salvage operations, funded by the international community, raised the stones and the remains of the bridge from the river bed. Missing elements or parts that were not usable were cut from the original quarry.
Now listed as a World Heritage Site, the bridge was rebuilt under the aegis of UNESCO. Its 1,088 stones were shaped according to the original techniques, at a cost of about €12 million. The grand opening was held on 23 July 2004.
It is traditional for the town&#x27;s young men to leap from the bridge into the Neretva. The practice dates back to 1566, the time the bridge was built, and an event was held every summer in front of the populace. The first recorded instance of someone diving off the bridge is from 1664. In 1968 a formal diving competition was inaugurated and held every summer.

Počitelj is situated on a hill near Mostar and is easily accessible by bus. As with many other Bosnian sites, this town is Ottoman in design. It is a historic fortified town with a hostel (caravanserai) and a hamam beneath. A traditional mosque is there. During the Bosnian War Počitelj was badly damaged and most of its residents fled and never returned

=== World War II: Battle of the Neretva ===

The famous &quot;Battle of Neretva&quot; is a 1969 Oscar-nominated motion picture depicting events from the Second World War and the actual Battle of the Neretva. Codenamed &quot;Fall Weiß&quot;, the operation was a German plan for a combined attack launched in early 1943 against Yugoslav Partisans throughout occupied Yugoslavia. The offensive took place between January and April 1943. The operation used to be known, in socialist Yugoslav times, as the Fourth Enemy Offensive, or as the Battle for the Wounded.

At one point during the battle, the Partisans were caught in a pocket with their back to the Neretva River. Near Jablanica, 20,000 Partisans under command of Marshal Josip Broz Tito struggled to save some 4500 wounded comrades and typhus patients together with the Supreme Headquarters and Main Hospital, against some 150,000 Axis combatants.
==In popular culture==
Celebrated Bosnian and Herzegovinian poet, Mak Dizdar often used the river Neretva as motif in his poetry, alongside other historical, cultural and natural feature of his native Herzegovina.
The famous &quot;Battle of Neretva&quot; is a 1969 Oscar-nominated motion picture depicting events from the World War II and the actual Battle of the Neretva.
Many folk songs are written or performed with the Neretva as main theme.

World renowned Scottish author, Alistair MacLean, bases his 1968 tour-de-force World War II novel, Force 10 from Navarone on the conflict along the Neretva. 

The book was later turned into a major motion picture featuring Robert Shaw, Harrison Ford and Robert Nero.

<text>William Morris Meredith (June 8, 1799 – August 17, 1873) was an American lawyer and politician from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He served as the United States Secretary of the Treasury, during President Zachary Taylor&#x27;s Administration.

==Early and family life==
Born on June 8, 1799, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, William Morris Meredith was the eldest son of William Tuckey Meredith (died 1844), a successful attorney and after 1814 president of Schuylkill Bank, who narrowly lost to Nicholas Biddle the presidency of the Bank of the United States. During the year he was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar, 1795, William Tuckey Meredith married the writer and poet Gertrude Gouverneur Meredith (née Ogden) (died 1828). Gertrude was the niece of Lewis Morris, as well as of Gouverneur Morris, and highly educated and respected in her own right, as well as published in Dennie&#x27;s Port Folio. The couple ultimately had eleven children. William Tuckey Meredith served on the Philadelphia Common and Select Councils, and on the Vestry of Christ Episcopal Church, among other leadership positions in the city. His brother Jonathan Meredith (d. 1872) was a leader of the Bar in Baltimore, Maryland. Another brother was the Civil War colonel Sullivan A. Meredith.

William M. Meredith graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1812 (graduation at age 13 not being unusual at the time). After assisting his father in the family&#x27;s saddlery business, he read law, and was himself admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar.

After his mother&#x27;s death in 1828, William Morris Meredith helped raise his younger siblings. On June 17, 1834, at the age of 35 and after a ten-year engagement, Meredith married the former Catherine Keppele (d. 1854). They had one son (William, b. 1838, later a published essayist and poet) and four daughters: Gertrude Gouverneur Meredith, Euphemia Ogden Meredith, Elizabeth Caldwell Meredith, Catherine Keppele Meredith. Catherine Meredith also helped care for her husband&#x27;s siblings, and his father when he was disabled by a stroke in 1839.

==Career==
Meredith was admitted to the bar in 1817, and began practicing law. He drew considerable public attention, as did his slightly senior colleague James C. Biddle (later his brother-in-law), by questioning the conduct of Judge Frank Hallowell in &quot;Commonwealth v. Cook&quot;, a murder case in which three black men were charged with killing a boy. During the jury&#x27;s deliberation, the &quot;American Daily Advertiser&quot; published an article which defense counsel thought highly biased. The judge allowed counsel to question jurors as to whether they read the article, and when the judge refused to dismiss a juror who said he was offended by Meredith&#x27;s questioning, complained such that the judge held both lawyers in contempt of court and ordered them jailed for 30 days, despite considerable public sympathy. Upon their release, they secured release of two of the prisoners in an appeal on double jeopardy grounds. This gained Meredith a reputation for fearlessness and inflexible honesty, and he was elected President of the Philadelphia Bar Association the following year.

A Federalist, Meredith was then elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly, where he served in the minority for five years, from 1824 to 1828, the year of his mother&#x27;s death (during which his father was grief-stricken and never fully recovered). One of his accomplishments was establishment of a House of Refuge for juvenile offenders, and he served as that institution&#x27;s manager, and also on the board of the Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, in which capacity he continued to serve for many years until his death.

Meredith was president of the Philadelphia City Council from 1834 until 1849, and was a delegate to the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention in 1837. That same year, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society. Meredith also served as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania from 1841 to 1845. During that time, he prosecuted Alexander Holmes for manslaughter in the &quot;William Brown&quot; case.

A successful attorney, particularly after he secured termination of the German Lutheran Church&#x27;s interment rights in Franklin Square in &quot;Commonwealth v. Allmyer&quot;, Meredith owned the Wheatland Estate in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, from May 1845 until December 1848 before selling it to future president James Buchanan.

President Zachary Taylor, wanting a Pennsylvania Whig for his cabinet, appointed William M. Meredith to be the 19th Secretary of the Treasury. He began his term in office on March 8, 1849.

Meredith strongly opposed the free trade legislation passed the year before under his predecessor Robert J. Walker. He felt that there was a need to protect the American workman, who was subject to competition from poorly paid European labor. Meredith&#x27;s principal contribution in office was his &quot;Annual Report of 1849&quot; in which he set forth an elaborate argument for a protective tariff.
The increase in the public debt due to the Mexican–American War and the acquisition of California gave Meredith additional argument for raising revenue through higher import duties, but no action was taken on the tariff during Meredith&#x27;s term. He also recommended a revision of the Coast Survey Code, which had not been changed since its implementation in 1806. The Coast Survey had seen great expansion and improvement with the introduction of steam powered ships and was in need of revision. Meredith resigned from his office as Secretary of the Treasury, upon President Taylor&#x27;s death in 1850.

==Civil War and later legal career==
Meredith was elected Pennsylvania&#x27;s attorney general in the 1860 election, and served for two terms (from 1861 until 1867). In 1861, as a delegate to a Peace Conference, he worked unsuccessfully to prevent the southern states from seceding from the Union. His brother Sullivan Amory Meredith had served in the Mexican War, and became a Brigadier General of Union Volunteers, commissioned in 1862, and the brothers helped assure Pennsylvania met its quota of troops. His son William served for a brief period as secretary to Major General George A. McCall, but his stutter and problems with cataracts caused him to resign that position.

William Meredith later served as a member of a commission working out the settlement of the &quot;Alabama&quot; claims, in 1870. The following year, President Ulysses Grant asked Meredith to travel to Geneva as senior counsel for the United States in an international arbitration proceeding, but he declined the position due to ill health. His last political post was as President of the 1872 Republican National Convention.

==Death and legacy==

Meredith died in Philadelphia in August 1873, at the age of 74. His wife, Catherine had died in 1854. Both are interred at the Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia.

The Historical Society of Pennsylvania holds the Meredith family papers. A Philadelphia school was named in his honor in 1931, and remains active today.

Meredith received one of only two 1849 Double Eagles while serving as Treasury Secretary. That 1849 Double Eagle is a pattern coin. The other coin is on display at the Smithsonian Institution. The coin was auctioned as part of his estate but its subsequent whereabouts are unknown.
