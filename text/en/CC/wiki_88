<text>Sidd Finch is a fictional baseball player, the subject of the notorious April Fools&#x27; Day hoax article &quot;The Curious Case of Sidd Finch&quot; written by George Plimpton and first published in the April 1, 1985, issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. According to Plimpton, Finch was raised in an English orphanage, learned yoga in Tibet, and could throw a fastball as fast as .

==Hoax==
In early 1985, Mark Mulvoy, the managing editor of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, noticed that a cover date that year would fall on April 1. He asked George Plimpton to commemorate this with an article on April Fools&#x27; Day jokes in sports. When Plimpton found himself unable to find enough examples to craft an article, Mulvoy gave Plimpton permission to create his own hoax.

Plimpton reported that Hayden Siddhartha &quot;Sidd&quot; Finch was a rookie baseball pitcher in training with the New York Mets after being discovered in Old Orchard Beach, Maine. He also wore only one shoe—a heavy hiker&#x27;s boot—when pitching. Finch, who had never played baseball before, was attempting to decide between a sports career and one playing the French horn. What was astonishing about Finch was that he could pitch a fastball at an amazing , far above the record of a &quot;mere&quot; , with pinpoint accuracy, and without needing to warm up. The Mets&#x27; scouting report gave Finch a &quot;9&quot; on fastball velocity and control—&quot;8&quot; is the highest score on the scale.

According to Plimpton, Finch grew up in an English orphanage and was adopted by an archaeologist who later died in a plane crash in Nepal. After briefly attending Harvard University, he went to Tibet to learn &quot;yogic mastery of mind-body&quot; under &quot;the great poet-saint Lama Milaraspa&quot;, which was the source of his pitching prowess. Finch decided not to pursue a baseball career, instead choosing to &quot;play the French horn or golf or something.&quot;

The story was accompanied by photographs of Finch, including one featuring a young Lenny Dykstra and another of Finch talking with the Mets&#x27; actual pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre. The Mets played along with the hoax, even providing a uniform and number (21) for Finch. 

&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; photographer Lane Stewart recruited his friend, Joe Berton, who was a junior high art teacher from Oak Park, Illinois, to portray Finch. Berton posed as Finch for the photographs (usually with his face averted from the lens). Berton stands at and wears a size 14 shoe.

Novelist Jonathan Dee, who was working as Plimpton&#x27;s assistant at the time, described Plimpton at the time of the writing of the article as &quot;a wreck&quot;. Dee wrote years later, &quot;Nothing, he knew, falls quite so flat as a bad joke. Such was his anxiety that, for the one and only time in my five years in his employ, he asked me to come in to work on a Saturday. I still remember my naïve astonishment at the sight of a world-famous, successful writer actually agonizing over whether something he’d written was good enough, funny enough, believable enough, or whether the whole thing would wind up making him seem like a national jackass.&quot; Dee also talked about his role in the Finch hoax in an outtake from the 2012 documentary film &quot;Plimpton! Starring George Plimpton as Himself&quot;.

==Response==
The story was released in late March 1985. The subhead of the article read: &quot;He&#x27;s a pitcher, part yogi and part recluse. Impressively liberated from our opulent life-style, Sidd&#x27;s deciding about yoga—and his future in baseball.&quot; The first letters of these words spell out &quot;Happy April Fools&#x27; Day—a(h) fib&quot;; Despite this clue and the obvious absurdity of the article, many people believed Finch actually existed. Mets fans were overjoyed at their luck in finding such a player, and flooded &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; with requests for more information. A New York sports page editor complained to the Mets&#x27; public relations director for allowing &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; to break the news. Two general managers called Commissioner of Baseball Peter Ueberroth asking about Finch. The &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; sent a reporter to find Finch, and a radio talk show host claimed he saw Finch pitch.

The Mets gave Finch a locker between George Foster and Darryl Strawberry. The three major networks, CBS, NBC, and ABC, and the local St. Petersburg, Florida, newspapers sent reporters to Al Lang Stadium for a press conference about Finch. At the April 2 press conference, Berton announced Finch&#x27;s retirement.

The magazine printed a much smaller article in the following April 8 issue announcing Finch&#x27;s retirement. It then announced it was a hoax on April 15.

==Aftermath==

Plimpton eventually broadened his article into a novel, first published in 1987. The book discussed Finch&#x27;s &quot;brief re-commitment to baseball&quot;, in which stories of Sadaharu Oh and Steve Dalkowski, as well as Finch&#x27;s girlfriend, inspire Finch to stick with baseball, and he reaches Major League Baseball with the Mets.

In April 2015, ESPN released a documentary on its &quot;30 for 30 Shorts&quot; program about the Sidd Finch phenomenon, as another April Fools&#x27; joke for a new generation.

On August 26, 2015, the Brooklyn Cyclones had a Sidd Finch bobblehead give-away for the 30th anniversary of the event. George Plimpton had died, so his son Taylor threw the ceremonial first pitch. Joe Berton attended and signed autographs on the bobbleheads. The bobblehead showed Finch in a Cyclones uniform, with French horn and one bare foot. The Cyclones were not in existence in 1985; a team executive explained in an interview during the game radio broadcast that using the Major League team name and logo would have been much more expensive.

<doc id="869744" wikidata="Q156548" url="?curid=869744" title="Queen Sofía of Spain">
<text>&quot;[[Doña]]&quot; Sofía (Sophia Margaret Victoria Frederica of Greece and Denmark, ; born 2 November 1938) is a member of the Spanish royal family who was Queen of Spain from 1975 to 2014 as the wife of King Juan Carlos I until his abdication. She is the eldest child of King Paul of Greece and his wife, Queen Frederica.

Sofía married then Infante Juan Carlos of Spain in 1962 and became queen of Spain upon her husband&#x27;s accession in 1975. On 19 June 2014, Juan Carlos abdicated in favour of their son Felipe VI.

==Early life==
Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark was born on 2 November 1938, at Tatoi Palace in Acharnes, Athens, Greece, the eldest child of King Paul and his wife, Queen Frederica. Sofía is a member of the Greek branch of the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg dynasty. Her brother was the deposed King Constantine II and her sister is Princess Irene.

Her maternal grandmother, Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia, wrote in her 1965 memoir: &quot;I have always had a particular fondness for her, and esteemed her modesty, understanding and goodness coupled with her candid realism touches with a fine sense of humour. There, she is very much like her father. My daughter told me what the little Sophia had once said to her about him: &#x27;You know, Mama, I think we have the nicest Papa in the world.&#x27;&quot;

As her family was forced into exile during the Second World War, she spent part of her childhood in Egypt, where she took her early education in El Nasr Girls&#x27; College in Alexandria, and South Africa, where her sister Irene was born. They returned to Greece in 1946. She finished her education at the prestigious Schloss Salem boarding school in Southern Germany, and then studied childcare, music and archeology in Athens. She also studied at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. She was a reserve member, when her brother Constantine, as helmsman, led Greece&#x27;s gold medal-winning sailing team in the 1960 Summer Olympics.

==Marriage and family==

Sofía met her paternal third cousin, the then Infante Juan Carlos of Spain on a cruise in the Greek Islands in 1954; they met again at the wedding of the Duke of Kent, her paternal second cousin, at York Minster in June 1961. Sofía and Juan Carlos married on 14 May 1962, at the Catholic Cathedral of Saint Dionysius in Athens.
Sofía converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Catholicism to become more palatable to Catholic Spain, and thus relinquished her rights to the Greek throne.

Sofía was in Greece on a private visit to her brother, King Constantine II, when the 1967 Greek military coup took place. Except for a brief stay for the funeral of her mother in 1981, Queen Sofía would not visit Greece until 1998.

In 1969, Spanish dictator Francisco Franco named Juan Carlos his successor under the official title &quot;Prince of Spain&quot;. Juan Carlos acceded to the throne in 1975, upon Franco&#x27;s death. Juan Carlos, after his accession to the Spanish throne, returned with his family to the Zarzuela Palace.

The couple has three children: Elena (born 20 December 1963); Cristina (born 13 June 1965); and Felipe (born 30 January 1968).

==Queen consort==

Besides accompanying her husband on official visits and occasions, Sofía also has solo engagements. In her first public appearance as Queen, Sofía attended a Shabbat service at the Beth Yaacov synagogue in Madrid in June 1976, marking the first time in modern Spanish history that a member of the Spanish royal family had visited a Jewish house of worship.

She is executive president of the Queen Sofía Foundation, which in 1993, sent funds for relief in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is honorary president of the Royal Board on Education and Care of Handicapped Persons of Spain, as well as the Spanish Foundation for Aid for Drug Addicts. Additionally, she has served as the patroness of the Queen Sofía Spanish Institute since 2003.

Sofía takes special interest in programs against drug addiction, travelling to conferences in both Spain and abroad. The Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía is named after her, as is Reina Sofía Airport in Tenerife.

Sofía is an Honorary Member of the San Fernando Royal Academy of Fine Arts and of the Spanish Royal Academy of History. She has received honorary doctorates from the Universities of Rosario (Bogotá), Valladolid, Cambridge, Oxford, Georgetown, Evora, St. Mary&#x27;s University (Texas), and New York.
Sofía has been honorary president of the Spanish Unicef Committee since 1971. She has been working closely with Dr. Muhammad Yunus on his Grameen Bank, which offers microcredits to women across the world. Queen Sofía has travelled to Bangladesh, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador and Mexico to support the activities of the organization. Queen Sofía has also been a strong supporter of Somaly Mam&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, an NGO combatting child prostitution and slavery in Cambodia. In 1998, Mam was awarded the prestigious Prince of Asturias Award for International Cooperation in the Queen&#x27;s presence.
As Queen, Sofía never publicly commented on political issues. However, in October 2008, Pilar Urbano&#x27;s book &quot;La Reina muy de cerca&quot; (&quot;The Queen up close&quot;) sparked strong controversy as it contained alleged statements by the Queen on issues debated in Spanish society. She criticized the military intervention in Afghanistan, where Spanish troops were taking part at the time, defended religious education in schools, and expressed her conviction that gender violence publicity would encourage new cases to occur. She also rejected abortion and euthanasia as well as same-sex marriage. The Royal Household commented that the book &quot;puts in Her Majesty&#x27;s mouth alleged claims that [...] do not correspond exactly to the opinions expressed by Her Majesty&quot;. While the two major parties - Socialists and People&#x27;s Party - refused to comment, her opinions were subjected to heavy criticism by Republican parties like IU and ERC and LGBT activists.

In May 2012, Sofía was reportedly refused permission to attend the celebrations for the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II by the Spanish government, citing tensions over fishing rights at Gibraltar.

In July 2012, Sofía visited the Philippines for a fourth time. She inspected several development projects around the former Spanish colony that her country&#x27;s government is funding via the &quot;Agencia Española de Cooperacion Internacional para el Desarollo&quot; (AECID). She visited the National Library, National Museum and the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas, The Catholic University of the Philippines, which had the oldest extant university charter in Asia and housed the world&#x27;s largest collection of suyat scripts. She also met with Spanish nationals residing in the Philippines, and attended a reception at the Spanish Embassy. She also attended a state dinner in her honour at Malacañan Palace hosted by President Benigno Aquino III, and thanked the president for promoting the Spanish language in the Philippine educational system.

== Queen mother ==
Following her husband&#x27;s abdication as King in 2014, Sofía has focused on her sponsoring activities, spending her time between La Zarzuela and, in the summer months, the Marivent Palace in Palma de Mallorca. She regularly accompanies her son and his family at events.

==Honours==
Queen Sophia was awarded the Order of the Queen of Sheba by Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia in 1973 upon her and her husband King Juan Carlos&#x27;s visit to the capital Addis Ababa.
Sofía was appointed to the Grand Cross of The Royal and Distinguished Order of Charles III on 10 May 1962 and to The Royal Order of Queen Maria Luisa on 14 May 1962. The Queen of Spain was appointed to the Collar of the Royal and Distinguished Order of Charles III as dame on 31 October 1983. Since then, Queen Sofía has received different appointments and decorations by more than 40 foreign states. In 2024, Queen Sofía was awarded the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece.

<doc id="869748" wikidata="Q1132393" url="?curid=869748" title="Mercenary War">
<text>The Mercenary War, also known as the Truceless War, was a mutiny by troops that were employed by Carthage at the end of the First Punic War (264241 BC), supported by uprisings of African settlements revolting against Carthaginian control. It lasted from 241 to late 238 or early 237 BC and ended with Carthage suppressing both the mutiny and the revolt.

The war began in 241 BC as a dispute over the payment of wages owed to 20,000 foreign soldiers who had fought for Carthage in Sicily during the First Punic War. When a compromise seemed to have been reached, the army erupted into full-scale mutiny under the leadership of Spendius and Matho. 70,000 Africans from Carthage&#x27;s oppressed dependent territories flocked to join them, bringing supplies and finance. War-weary Carthage fared poorly in the initial engagements of the war, especially under the generalship of Hanno. Hamilcar Barca, a veteran of the campaigns in Sicily (and father of Hannibal Barca), was given joint command of the army in 240 BC; and supreme command in 239 BC. He campaigned successfully, initially demonstrating leniency in an attempt to woo the rebels over. To prevent this, in 240 BC Spendius and Autaritus tortured 700 Carthaginian prisoners to death (including Gisco), after which the war was pursued with great brutality on both sides.

By early 237 BC, after numerous setbacks, the rebels were defeated and their cities brought back under Carthaginian rule. An expedition was prepared to reoccupy Sardinia, where mutinous soldiers had slaughtered all Carthaginians. However, Rome declared that this would be an act of war and occupied both Sardinia and Corsica, in contravention of the recent peace treaty. This has been considered to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again in 218 BC in the Second Punic War.

==Primary sources==
The main source for almost every aspect of the Punic Wars is the historian Polybius ( – ), a Greek sent to Rome in 167 BC as a hostage. His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics, but he is known today for &quot;The Histories&quot;, written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after this war. Polybius&#x27;s work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.

Carthaginian written records were destroyed along with their capital, Carthage, in 146 BC and so Polybius&#x27;s account of the Mercenary War is based on several, now-lost, Greek and Latin sources. Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about. He was on the staff of Scipio Aemilianus when he led a Roman army during the Third Punic War on a campaign through many of the locations of the actions of the Mercenary War. Only part of the first book of the 40 comprising &quot;The Histories&quot; deals with this war. The accuracy of Polybius&#x27;s account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the war in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius&#x27;s account. The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that &quot;Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable&quot;; while Craige Champion describes him as &quot;a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian&quot;. Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form. Modern historians also take into account the later histories of Diodorus Siculus and Dio Cassius, although the classicist Adrian Goldsworthy states that &quot;Polybius&#x27; account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts&quot;. Other sources include inscriptions, coins and archaeological evidence.

== Background ==
The First Punic War was fought between Carthage and Rome, the two main powers of the western Mediterranean in the 3rd century BC, and lasted for 23 years, from 264 to 241 BC. Rome still exists as the capital of Italy, while Carthage was razed by Rome in a later war; its ruins lie east of modern Tunis on the North African coast. The two powers struggled for supremacy primarily on the Mediterranean island of Sicily and its surrounding waters, and also in North Africa. It was the longest continuous conflict and the greatest naval war of antiquity. After immense materiel and human losses on both sides, the Carthaginians were defeated. The Carthaginian Senate ordered the commander of its forces on Sicily, Hamilcar Barca, to negotiate a peace treaty; he delegated this to his deputy Gisco. The Treaty of Lutatius was signed and brought the First Punic War to its end. By the treaty&#x27;s terms, Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an indemnity of 3,200 talents1,000 talents of this was due immediately, the balance over ten years.

While the war with Rome was being played out, the Carthaginian general Hanno, who was one of several Carthaginian Hannos known as &quot;the great&quot;, was leading a series of campaigns which greatly increased the area of Africa controlled by Carthage. He extended its control to Theveste (modern Tébessa, Algeria) south-west of their capital. Hanno was rigorous in squeezing taxes out of the newly conquered territory to pay for both the war with Rome and his campaigns. Half of all agricultural output was taken as war tax, and the tribute previously due from towns and cities was doubled. These exactions were harshly enforced, causing extreme hardship in many areas.

Carthaginian armies were nearly always composed of foreigners; citizens served in the army only if there was a direct threat to the city of Carthage. The majority of these foreigners were from North Africa. Libyans provided close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting spears; as well as close-order shock cavalry carrying spearsboth were noted for their discipline and staying power. Numidians provided light cavalry who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat, and javelin-armed light infantry skirmishers. Both Spain and Gaul provided experienced infantry; unarmoured troops who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if combat was protracted. The close-order Libyan infantry, and citizen militia when present, would fight in a tightly-packed formation known as a phalanx. Two thousand slingers were recruited from the Balearic Islands. Sicilians and Italians had also joined up during the war to fill the ranks. The Carthaginians frequently employed war elephants; North Africa had indigenous African forest elephants at the time. Roman sources refer to these foreign fighters derogatively as &quot;mercenaries&quot;, but Goldsworthy describes this as &quot;a gross oversimplification&quot;. They served under a variety of arrangements; for example, some were the regular troops of allied cities or kingdoms seconded to Carthage as part of formal arrangements.

=== Mutiny ===

After receiving orders to make peace on whatever terms he could negotiate, Hamilcar left Sicily in a rage, convinced that the surrender was unnecessary. The evacuation of the Carthaginian army of 20,000 men from Sicily was left in the hands of Gisco. Not wishing the freshly idle soldiers to combine for purposes of their own, Gisco split the army into small detachments based on their regions of origin. He sent these back to Carthage one at a time. He anticipated they would be promptly paid the several years&#x27; back pay they were owed and hurried on their way home. The Carthaginian authorities decided to instead wait until all of the troops had arrived and then attempt to negotiate a settlement at a lower rate. Meanwhile, as each group arrived it was billeted inside the city of Carthage where the advantages of civilisation were appreciated to the full after up to eight years under siege. This &quot;tumultuous licentiousness&quot; so alarmed the city&#x27;s authorities that before the full 20,000 had arrived they were relocated to Sicca Veneria (modern El Kef), away, even though much of their arrears had to be paid before they would go.

Freed of their long period of military discipline and with nothing to do, the men grumbled among themselves and refused all attempts by the Carthaginians to pay them less than the full amount due. Frustrated by the Carthaginian negotiators&#x27; attempts to haggle, all 20,000 troops marched to Tunis, from Carthage. Panicking, the Senate agreed to pay in full. The mutinous troops responded by demanding even more. Gisco, who had a good reputation with the army, was brought over from Sicily in late 241 BC and despatched to the camp with enough money to pay most of what was owed. He started to disburse this, with promises that the balance would be paid as soon as it could be raised. The discontent seemed to have abated when, for some unknown reason, discipline broke down. Several soldiers insisted that no deal with Carthage was acceptable, a riot broke out, dissenters were stoned to death, Gisco and his staff were taken prisoner and his treasury was seized. Spendius, an escaped Roman slave who faced death by torture if he were recaptured, and Matho, a Berber dissatisfied with Hanno&#x27;s attitude towards tax-raising from Carthage&#x27;s African possessions, were declared generals. The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion. Provisions, money and reinforcements poured in; an additional 70,000 men according to Polybius. Rebel coins from this period read &#x27;from the Libyans&#x27;, suggesting the mutinous troops were hired by the Libyan cities. In turn, the rebelling Libyans may have been led by Zarzas. Other coins minted by the insurgents were engraved with the Punic letters &quot;A, M, or Z&quot;, with the historian Louis Rawlings surmising that these stood for the rebels&#x27; main leaders: Autaritus, Mathos, and Zarzas. The pay dispute had become a full-scale revolt threatening Carthage&#x27;s existence as a state.

==War==

===Hanno===

Hanno, as the commander of Carthage&#x27;s African army, took the field. Most of the Africans in his force remained loyal; they were accustomed to acting against their fellow Africans. His non-African contingent had remained quartered in Carthage when the army of Sicily was expelled, and also remained loyal. The few troops still in Sicily were paid up to date and redeployed with Hanno, and money was raised to hire fresh troops. An unknown number of Carthaginian citizens were incorporated into Hanno&#x27;s army. By the time Hanno assembled this force, the rebels had already blockaded Utica and Hippo (modern Bizerte).

In early 240 BC Hanno set off with the army to relieve Utica; he took with him 100 elephants and a siege train. Hanno stormed the rebels&#x27; camp in the Battle of Utica and his elephants routed the besiegers. Hanno&#x27;s army took over the camp and Hanno himself entered the city in triumph. However, the battle-hardened veterans of the Sicilian army regrouped in the nearby hills and, not being pursued, returned towards Utica. The Carthaginians, accustomed to fighting the militias of the Numidian cities, were still celebrating their victory when the rebels counter-attacked. The Carthaginians fled, with great loss of life, losing their baggage and siege trains. For the rest of the year Hanno skirmished with the rebel force, repeatedly missing opportunities to bring it to battle or to place it at a disadvantage; the military historian Nigel Bagnall writes of Hanno&#x27;s &quot;incompetence as a field commander&quot;.

Rome pointedly declined to take advantage of Carthage&#x27;s troubles. Italians were prohibited from trading with the rebels but encouraged to trade with Carthage; 2,743 Carthaginian prisoners still held were released without a ransom being required and were immediately enrolled into Carthage&#x27;s army. Hiero, the king of the Roman satellite kingdom of Syracuse, was allowed to supply Carthage with the large amounts of food it needed and was no longer able to obtain from its hinterland. In late 240 or early 239 BC, the Carthaginian garrisons on Sardinia joined the mutiny, killing their officers and the island&#x27;s governor. The Carthaginians sent a force to retake the island. When it arrived its members also mutinied, joined the previous mutineers, and killed all of the Carthaginians on the island. The mutineers then appealed to Rome for protection, which was refused. The classicist Richard Miles writes that &quot;Rome was in no shape to embark on yet another war&quot; and wished to avoid acquiring a reputation for supporting mutinous uprisings.

===Hamilcar===

At some point during 240 BC the Carthaginians raised another, smaller, force, of approximately 10,000. It included deserters from the rebels, 2,000 cavalry, and 70 elephants. This was placed under the command of Hamilcar, who had commanded the Carthaginian forces on Sicily for the last six years of the First Punic War. The rebels held the line of the Bagradas River with 10,000 men commanded by Spendius. Hamilcar would need to force a crossing if he were to gain access to open country where he could manoeuvre. He did so by a stratagem, and Spendius was reinforced by an additional 15,000 men drawn from the force laying siege to Utica, which the rebels had renewed. The rebel army of 25,000 moved to attack Hamilcar in the Battle of the Bagradas River. What happened next is unclear: it seems Hamilcar feigned a retreat, the rebels broke ranks to pursue, the Carthaginians turned in good order and counter-attacked, routing the rebels, who suffered losses of 8,000 men.

Hamilcar was appointed joint commander of the Carthaginian army, alongside Hanno, but there was no cooperation between the two. While Hanno manoeuvred against Matho to the north near Hippo, Hamilcar confronted various towns and cities which had gone over to the rebels, bringing them back to Carthaginian allegiance with varying mixtures of diplomacy and force. He was shadowed by a superior-sized rebel force, which kept to rough ground for fear of Hamilcar&#x27;s cavalry and elephants, and harried his foragers and scouts. South west of Utica, Hamilcar moved his force into the mountains in an attempt to bring the rebels to battle, but was surrounded. The Carthaginians were saved from destruction only when a Numidian leader, Naravas, who had served with and admired Hamilcar in Sicily, swapped sides, bringing 2,000 cavalry with him. This proved disastrous for the rebels, and in the resulting battle, they lost 10,000 killed and 4,000 captured.

===Truceless War===
Since leaving Carthage, Hamilcar had treated rebels he had captured well and offered them a choice of joining his army or free passage home. He made the same offer to the 4,000 captives from the recent battle. The rebel leaders perceived this generous treatment as the motivation behind Naravas&#x27;s defection and feared the disintegration of their army; they were aware that such generous terms would not be extended to them personally. To remove the possibility of any goodwill between the sides, Spendius, encouraged by his fellow leader the Gaul Autaritus, had 700 Carthaginian prisoners, including Gisco, tortured to death: they had their hands cut off, were castrated, had their legs broken and were thrown into a pit and buried alive. The mercenary leader and skilled polyglot orator Autaritus is cited by Polybius as a chief instigator of this massacre. Hamilcar, in turn, killed his prisoners. From this point, neither side showed any mercy, and the unusual ferocity of the fighting caused Polybius to term it the &quot;Truceless War&quot;. Any further prisoners taken by the Carthaginians were trampled to death by elephants.

At some point between March and September 239 BC the previously loyal cities of Utica and Hippo slew their Carthaginian garrisons and joined the rebels. The people of Utica offered their city to the Romans, who, consistent with their response to the mutineers on Sardinia, declined. The rebels previously operating in the area moved south and laid siege to Carthage.

Having a clear superiority in cavalry, Hamilcar raided the supply lines of the rebels around Carthage. In mid-239 BC, he was joined by Hanno and his army, but the two men disagreed as to the best strategy and operations were paralysed. Unusually, the choice of supreme commander was put to a vote of the armypossibly only the officersand Hamilcar was elected; Hanno left the army. In early 238 BC the lack of supplies forced the rebels to lift the siege of Carthage. They fell back to Tunis, from where they maintained a more distant blockade. While Matho maintained the blockade, Spendius led 40,000 men against Hamilcar. As in the previous year, they stayed to the higher and rougher terrain and harassed the Carthaginian army. After a period of campaigning, the details of which are not clear in the sources, Hamilcar trapped the rebels in a pass or mountain range known as the Saw. Pinned against mountains and with their food exhausted, the rebels ate their horses, their prisoners and then their slaves, hoping that Matho would sortie from Tunis to rescue them. Eventually, the surrounded troops forced their leaders to parley with Hamilcar, but on a thin pretext, he took Spendius and his lieutenants prisoner. The rebels then attempted to fight their way out in the Battle of the Saw and were massacred to a man.
Hamilcar then marched on Tunis and laid siege to it in late 238 BC. The city was difficult to access from both the east and the west, so Hamilcar occupied a position to the south with half the army, and his deputy Hannibal was to the north with the balance. The rebel leaders taken captive prior to the Saw were crucified in full view of the city. Matho ordered a large-scale night attack, which surprised the Carthaginians, who suffered many casualties. One of their camps was overrun and they lost much of their baggage. In addition, Hannibal and a delegation of 30 Carthaginian notables who were visiting the army were captured. They were tortured and then nailed to the crosses previously occupied by Spendius and his colleagues. Hamilcar abandoned the siege and withdrew to the north.

The Senate encouraged reconciliation between Hanno and Hamilcar, and they agreed to serve together. Meanwhile, Matho and his army had left Tunis and marched south to the wealthy city of Leptis Parva, which had risen against Carthage earlier in the war. Hanno and Hamilcar marched after them with an army totalling perhaps 40,000 including every Carthaginian citizen of military age. The rebels, rather than wait to be besieged, met the Carthaginians in open battle in mid-to-late 238 BC. No details of the battle survive, but the remaining 30,000 rebels were wiped out and Matho captured with few losses to the Carthaginians. Any other prisoners were crucified, while Matho was dragged through the streets of Carthage and tortured to death by its inhabitants. Most of the towns and cities which had not already come to terms with Carthage now did so, with the exceptions of Utica and Hippo, whose inhabitants feared vengeance for their massacre of Carthaginians. They attempted to hold out, but Polybius says that they too &quot;quickly&quot; surrendered, probably in late 238 or very early 237 BC. The surrendered towns and cities were treated leniently, although Carthaginian governors were imposed on them.

===Sardinia===

Probably in 237 BC, the indigenous inhabitants of Sardinia rose up and drove out the mutinous garrison, which took refuge in Italy. As the war in Africa came to a close, they appealed again for Roman assistance. This time the Romans agreed and prepared an expedition to seize both Sardinia and Corsica. It is unclear from the sources why the Romans acted differently from three years earlier. Polybius held that this action was indefensible. Carthage sent an embassy to Rome, which quoted the Treaty of Lutatius and claimed they were outfitting their own expedition to retake the island, which it had held for 300 years. The Roman Senate cynically stated that they considered the preparation of this force an act of war. Their peace terms were the ceding of Sardinia and Corsica and the payment of an additional 1,200 talent indemnity. Weakened by 30 years of war, Carthage agreed rather than enter into a conflict with Rome again.

== Aftermath ==
The Romans required a strong military presence on Sardinia and Corsica for at least the next seven years, as they struggled to suppress the local inhabitants. The seizure of Sardinia and Corsica by Rome and the additional indemnity fuelled resentment in Carthage. Polybius considered this act of bad faith by the Romans to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again nineteen years later. The role of Hamilcar Barca in the victory greatly enhanced the prestige and power of the Barcid family. Immediately after the war, Hamilcar led many of his veterans on an expedition to expand Carthaginian holdings in southern Iberia; this was to become a semi-autonomous Barcid fiefdom. In 218 BC, a Carthaginian army under Hannibal Barca besieged the Roman-protected town of Saguntum in eastern Iberia, providing the spark which ignited the Second Punic War.

The historian Dexter Hoyos writes that &quot;the truceless war ... produce[d] a complete and enduring reversal of Carthage&#x27;s domestic fortunes and military orientation&quot;. Miles agrees there was &quot;a period of profound political transformation&quot;. Carthage never regained control over its army: generals continued to be, like Hamilcar, selected by their armies; the troops in Spain effectively became the Barcids&#x27; private army. Internally the opinions of both the Barcids and the Popular Assembly increasingly dictated to the old-established bodies of the Senate and the Tribunal.

<text>CTI Records (Creed Taylor Incorporated) is a jazz record label founded in 1967 by Creed Taylor. CTI was a subsidiary of A&amp;M before becoming independent in 1970. Its first album was &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; by guitarist Wes Montgomery in 1967. The final release, by the CTI Jazz All-Star Band, was recorded live at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 2009, and released in November 2010 on multiple formats: CD, DVD and Blu-ray.

Its roster included George Benson, Ron Carter, Eumir Deodato, Astrud Gilberto, Freddie Hubbard, Bob James, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Hubert Laws, Airto Moreira, Stanley Turrentine, and Walter Wanderley.

==History==
Don Sebesky created many of the arrangements for CTI and its subsidiary labels. He was later joined by Bob James and then David Matthews in the mid-1970s. Taylor used Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, with Rudy Van Gelder engineering nearly all sessions until the later years of the label. Sessions included Ron Carter, Eric Gale, Herbie Hancock, Bob James, Richard Tee, Billy Cobham, Jack DeJohnette, Steve Gadd, Idris Muhammad, and Harvey Mason.

CTI was commercially successful with certain albums well-received by critics. CTI&#x27;s best-selling album was Deodato&#x27;s &quot;Prelude&quot;, which reached No. 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart in 1973. A single from the album, &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra (2001)&quot;, peaked at No. 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 7 in the UK. Other successful singles were Bob James&#x27; &quot;Feel Like Making Love&quot; and &quot;Westchester Lady&quot;, Idris Muhammad&#x27;s &quot;Could Heaven Ever Be Like This&quot;, and Esther Phillips&#x27; &quot;What a Diff&#x27;rence a Day Makes&quot;, a disco hit.

Successful album releases included Grover Washington, Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Mister Magic&quot; and &quot;Feels So Good&quot; (both reaching No. 10 in 1975), Esther Phillips&#x27; &quot;What a Diff&#x27;rence a Day Makes&quot; (reaching No. 32 in 1975), and Bob James&#x27; &quot;BJ4&quot; (reaching No. 38 in 1977).

Taylor&#x27;s productions for CTI helped to establish smooth jazz as a commercially viable musical genre. CTI also became known for its striking album sleeve designs, most of them with images by photographer Pete Turner.

After founding CTI as a jazz label for A &amp; M Records in 1967, Taylor decided to go independent three years later. The company had several subsidiary labels. Kudu Records was established in 1971 and concentrated on soul jazz with albums by Joe Beck, Hank Crawford, Grant Green, Idris Muhammad, Esther Phillips, Johnny &quot;Hammond&quot; Smith, Dr. Lonnie Smith, and Grover Washington Jr. Salvation Records released 10 albums during its existence, including music by Airto, Roland Hanna, Faith Howard, New York Jazz Quartet, Johnny &quot;Hammond&quot; Smith, and Gábor Szabó Greenestreet (which released albums by Jack Wilkins, Claudio Roditi, Les McCann) and Three Brothers (with recordings by The Clams, Lou Christie, Duke Jones, and Cassandra Morgan).

A switch to Motown Records for distribution was to end in difficulties in 1977, with legal and financial problems eventually leading to the label filing for bankruptcy in 1978. CTI, though, remained active until 1984, releasing studio albums by Ray Barretto, Urszula Dudziak, Jim Hall, Roland Hanna, Nina Simone, and the all-star studio band Fuse One

Taylor restructured CTI in 1989, resuming his association with Van Gelder and Turner in June 1989 when recording the all-star session for &quot;Rhythmstick&quot;, an ambitious album released on vinyl, CD, VHS, and LaserDisc in 1990. Many young musicians were signed to the label, such as Charles Fambrough, Jim Beard, Ted Rosenthal, Bill O&#x27;Connell, Donald Harrison, Steve Laury, and Jurgen Friedrich, as well as veteran guitarist Larry Coryell, who collaborated with arranger Don Sebesky on the best-selling &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; album, which reached No. 18 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Contemporary Jazz Albums Chart in 1993.

CTI&#x27;s post-A&amp;M Records catalog (albums released between 1970 and 1979) is owned by Sony and distributed by Masterworks Jazz in the USA. King Records handles the rights for exclusive distribution in Japan. Grover Washington, Jr.&#x27;s Kudu albums have been re-issued by Motown and its MoJazz imprint as part of Universal Classics &amp; Jazz. Bob James owns the four albums he recorded for CTI (now managed by Evolution Music Group under license from Tappan Zee, James&#x27; record label). Seawind also owns their back catalog of CTI releases. CTI&#x27;s A&amp;M-subsidiary releases are distributed by Verve, a division of Universal Music Group.

In 2009, Taylor produced a reissue series of twenty CTI titles remastered by Van Gelder for release on SHM-CD format in Japan. New liner notes were provided by Ira Gitler, Arnaldo DeSouteiro, and Doug Payne. Other reissue series came out in December 2013 (including forty titles released on Blu-spec CD format) and in December 2017 with another forty titles on the CTI 50th Anniversary Collection.

==Discography==

===3000 Series===
The albums comprising the CTI 3000 Series were produced by Creed Taylor between 1967 and 1970 and issued by A&amp;M with a &quot;CTI&quot; logo on the front cover. 
===1000 Series===
In 1970, Creed Taylor established CTI independently of A&amp;M and issued the first five releases as the 1000 Series which had a green record label. The 1000 Series featured artists working outside of the jazz genre.
===6000 series===
The albums in the CTI 6000 series were released between 1970 and 1976 and featured an orange CTI label with black print, but Quadraphonic issues featured a red label variant. Later albums in the 6000 series were distributed by Motown and are designated by the addition of an S1 to the catalog number.
===CTI Twofer series===
The albums in the CTI Twofer series were double albums released between 1972 and 1974.
===5000 Series===
The 5000 Series was introduced in 1975 as a series of popular music recordings and consist of eight issued albums. Only a handful in this series were produced by Creed Taylor; outside producers handled the rest, like Harvey Mason producing Seawind&#x27;s albums and David Grusin and Larry Rosen producing Patti Austin&#x27;s second album. The first releases features a &quot;P.S.&quot; (which stood for &quot;Pop Series&quot;) inside the familiar CTI logo.
===7000 Series===
The 7000 Series continued the numbering sequence from the 6000 Series after it ended its distribution deal with Motown.
===8000 Series===
The 8000 series was launched in the late-1970s. Its purpose was to reissue previous CTI and Kudu albums. In some instances original album titles were changed, and artwork was also altered, with releases originally issued in gatefold album covers now reduced to single sleeves.
===9000 Series===
The 9000 Series was started in 1980 and was distributed by CBS Records but maintained its independence (except for Patti Austin&#x27;s &quot;Body Language&quot; album which carried a CBS-style look and catalog number) The series started with the classic orange label (used since the 6000 Series) but by 1981 switched to a white label with a new logo design, though in 1983, for George Benson&#x27;s archive release &quot;Pacific Fire&quot; it had a silver label.
===Kudu ===
The Kudu label was started by Creed Taylor in July 1971 and specialized in soul jazz, releasing 39 albums from 1971 to 1979. Kudu is considered CTI&#x27;s sister label.
===Salvation ===
Salvation Records was a CTI subsidiary originally intended for gospel albums but after releasing one album by the B. C. &amp; M. Choir and laying fallow for two years the label was revived for a handful of jazz and R&amp;B releases. While Creed Taylor did produce the B. C. &amp; M. Choir album, outside producers would handle the other releases.
===Three Brothers label===
Three Brothers Records was a short-lived subsidiary of CTI named after Creed Taylor&#x27;s sons (Creed Jr., John, and Blake). It had a few single releases and issued one album by Lou Christie.

<text>Dadra is associated with the Hindustani classical music of the Indian subcontinent.

==Dadra tala==
This is a Hindustani classical &quot;tala&quot; (rhythmic cycle), consisting of six beats in two equal divisions of three. The most commonly accepted theka or basic pattern for this tala is &quot;dha dhi na, dha tu na&quot;. There is a higher emphasis laid on the first swar in comparison the following two, that is, &quot;dha&quot; - higher emphasis following &quot;dhi&quot; &quot;na&quot; and again a higher emphasis on &quot;dha&quot; following &quot;tu&quot; &quot;na&quot;.

===Theka of Dadra Tala===

मात्रा भाग : 3-3. &lt;br&gt;
धा धिं ना - धा तीं ना &lt;br&gt; 
It has a characteristic pattern of bols (theka).
This can also be shown using the following figure
==Dadra (genre)==
In this context &quot;dadra&quot; is a light classical vocal form in Hindustani classical music, mostly performed in Agra and in Bundelkhand region. It was originally accompanied by dadra tala (from where the term for the genre was borrowed), but later dadra compositions are often found in other light talas (such as &quot;keherwa&quot;).

The peculiarity of Dadra genre is that the Sthayi is in Braj Bhasha while the Antara is sometimes in Urdu. It is one of the illustrations of how cultures have amalgamated and coexisted in Indian classical music.

There have been some Bollywood songs as well based on the same for instance Madan Mohan composition -&quot;Lag Jaa Gale&quot;, a song from the movie &quot;Woh Kaun Thi&quot;.

<text>At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, three disciplines of gymnastics were contested: artistic gymnastics (August 14–23), rhythmic gymnastics (August 26–29) and trampoline (August 20–21). The artistic gymnastics and trampoline events were held at the Olympic Indoor Hall and the rhythmic gymnastics events were held at the Galatsi Olympic Hall.

==Artistic gymnastics==

===Format of competition===
The competition format was largely the same as at the 2000 Summer Olympics. All participating gymnasts, including those who were not part of a team, participated in a qualification round. The results of this competition determined which teams and individuals participated in the remaining competitions, which included:

*The team competition, in which the eight highest scoring teams from qualifications competed. For the first time, each team of six gymnasts could only have three gymnasts perform on each apparatus, and all three scores counted toward the team total.
*The all-around competition, in which only the twenty-four highest scoring individuals in the all-around competed. For the first time, each country was limited to only two gymnasts in the all-around final.
*The event finals, in which the eight highest scoring individuals on each apparatus competed. Each country was limited to two gymnasts in each apparatus final.

===Medalists - Men&#x27;s Events===

==Controversies==

The gymnastics competition had scoring controversies, most prominently with the South Korean competitor Yang Tae-young.

The Korean team contested Tae-Young&#x27;s parallel bars score after judges misidentified one of the elements of his routine. The effect of this misidentification was that the start value was recorded as 9.9 rather than 10. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) dismissed the Korean Olympic Committee&#x27;s appeal on the grounds that the appeal, coming after the end of competition, was made too late, and insufficient evidence of corruption or bad faith on the part of the judges was presented to overturn a strong preference for a &quot;field of play&quot; judgment rather than one made after the fact.

Further problems occurred in the men&#x27;s horizontal bar competition. After performing a routine with six release skills in the high bar event final (including four in a row – three variations of Tkatchev releases and a Gienger), the judges posted a score of 9.725, placing Nemov in third position with several athletes still to compete. This was actually a fair judging decision because he took a big step on landing which was a two tenths deduction. The crowd became unruly on seeing the results and interrupted the competition for almost fifteen minutes. Influenced by the crowd&#x27;s fierce reaction, the judges reevaluated the routine and increased Nemov&#x27;s score to 9.762, but this did not improve his placement and he finished without a medal. 

The controversies led to the reconstruction of the scoring system which was implemented in 2006. The rule changes are credited as having encouraged more acrobatic activity and increasing difficulties on the high bar apparatus seen in later competitions.

<doc id="869769" wikidata="Q1936222" url="?curid=869769" title="Life on Other Planets">
<text>Life on Other Planets is the fourth studio album by English alternative rock band Supergrass. It is the first album that includes Rob Coombes as an official member of the band, and originally went under the working title of &quot;Get Lost&quot;. The American edition of the album included many bonus tracks and rare live editions. One of these live editions became infamous when it was discovered you can hear a gunshot in the background of the song. It peaked at #9 in the UK charts.

==Background==
The band hired an outside producer, Tony Hoffer, for the record, having felt that their last release, &quot;Supergrass&quot;, lacked some of the urgency of their previous albums: &quot;He helped us keep the takes quite short and sweet&quot;, says Danny Goffey. &quot;We really didn&#x27;t mess around because he kept us moving. If we had done it on our own again, we&#x27;d just get really analytical and start crying and trying to mend things that weren&#x27;t broken.&quot;

==Composition and lyrics==
The naming of the album was influenced by this excursion, but also by a telescope which qualified astrophysicist and keyboard player Rob Coombes, would bring with him to the recording studio in order to see the planets; &quot;...we got fascinated on everything above us and came up with the title,&quot; explained Mick Quinn. The band claim that much of the inspiration for this album was gleaned from a &quot;working holiday&quot; in the Côte d&#x27;Azur, Southern France together, listening to the French radio station Nostalgie and watching Carl Sagan documentaries on the cosmos. Carl Sagan and Douglas Adams are in fact mentioned on the reverse of &quot;Life on Other Planets&quot; under a list of people Supergrass would like to thank.

Musically, the sound of the album has been described as power pop, drawing comparison to the work of the Sweet. Coombes employed the use of an Elvis Presley impersonation on &quot;Seen the Light&quot; and &quot;Evening of the Day&quot;, while on &quot;Brecon Beacons&quot; he sounded closer to Marc Bolan of T. Rex. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it found the &quot;perfect balance of the sensibility and humor of I Should Coco with the musicality and casual virtuosity of In It for the Money&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; contributor Joe Tangari referred to it as a &quot;tour of 70s British rock, but more to the point, it&#x27;s a summary of Supergrass&#x27; own career, merging all of the band&#x27;s many mutations into one decisive sound&quot;. In a review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, journalist Greg Kot wrote that throughout the album, there are &quot;chirping birds, bleating sheep, Munchkin choirs, fumbled tambourines and an Elvis imitator&quot;. He also mentioned that they melded together the better aspects of the 1970s, such as Electric Light Orchestra, glam rock and Paul McCartney&#x27;s solo career, with the &quot;punk holy trinity of speed, noise and more speed&quot;.

Tangari said &quot;Za&quot;, the album&#x27;s opening track, was a standard Supergrass &quot;rocker stuffed with big, crashing Mick Ronson riffage, but backed by strange, wordless vocals&quot;. &quot;Rush Hour Soul&quot; is a garage rock track with influences from progressive rock. &quot;Evening of the Day&quot; includes a reference to &quot;All the Way Home&quot; by Spinal Tap, and is followed by the ska track &quot;Brecon Beacons&quot;. The country rock song &quot;Evening of the Day&quot; mixes Small Faces-type Brit-rock with blues in the vein of B.B. King. &quot;Prophet 15&quot; evoked &quot;Let &#x27;Em In&quot; (1976) by McCartney&#x27;s Wings; &quot;Spin&quot; Alex Pappademas wrote that it has the spirits of &quot;Oscar Wilde, John Belushi, and Che Guevara visit Coombes while he&#x27;s blowing out his mind in a car&quot;. Tangari said that &quot;Run&quot;, the album&#x27;s closing track, had &quot;glossy harmonies and squiggly effects [which] pick up on the spacier bits of the 1970s and squash them into a glowing, noise-addled coda&quot;. It concludes with a looping synthesizer part that recalled the opening moments of the album.

The album was debuted at Meltdown festival in London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall on 28 June 2002, the edition curated by David Bowie.

==Reception==

&quot;Life on Other Planets&quot; was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 74, based on 21 reviews.

Some reviewers praised the band&#x27;s energy and songwriting. Erlewine saw it as a &quot;smashing return to form, an album giddy with the sheer pleasure of making music&quot;, adding that there &quot;hasn&#x27;t been an album that&#x27;s this much fun in a long time&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; Ken Tucker thought that the band &quot;continues to evince range and spunk aplenty on Life on Other Planets&quot;. &quot;Blender&quot; writer Pat Blashill remarked that the majority of &quot;these concise, supercatchy tunes are as unself-consciously traditional, and fun, as an undiscovered cache of British Invasion rock&quot;.

Other critics thought the band lacked ideas. Paul McNamee of &quot;NME&quot; wrote that &quot;with so much riding&quot; on the album, the band &quot;take no chances, opening at full tilt with a volley of hits-in-waiting&quot;. While he &quot;believe this to be the great album they&#x27;ve always threatened, Supergrass start to mug it up; they just can&#x27;t help themselves&quot;. Tangari wrote that &quot;on the one hand, there&#x27;s an abundance of energy and some great songwriting; on the other, there&#x27;s less focus here than on either of their previous two releases&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; critic Dave Simpson acknowledged that it &quot;harks back to the youthful effervescence of their debut - but the energy feels laboured&quot;, with its main issue being the &quot;lack of ideas&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; writer David Quantick said that while it was &quot;more varied than their last album,&quot; it featured &quot;less rock than In It For The Money, it&#x27;s a fiddly disappointment, as centreless as a B-sides compilation&quot;. Kot said the album&#x27;s 12 tracks were &quot;packed to bursting with the tension of too many ideas and too little time&quot;, mentioning that the band&#x27;s &quot;lack of commitment can get wearisome, and &quot;Life&quot; suffers without a guiding sense of personality, a point of view&quot;. Pappademas wrote that &quot;unfortunately, Coombes seems to have the glam era&#x27;s fuzzy-brained approach to pop song-writing nailed a bit too well&quot;. He suggested that for the next release, they should &quot;leave their forebear&#x27; lazy lyricism back at ground control&quot;.

<doc id="869772" wikidata="Q5465187" url="?curid=869772" title="Fonthill, Ontario">
<text>Fonthill is a community in the town of Pelham, Ontario, Canada. It has a few small industries, but is primarily a residential suburb with some fruit orchards and nature trails. As a bedroom community, most residents commute to Welland, St. Catharines and some as far as Buffalo, Hamilton and Toronto daily for work.

==Geography and geology==
Fonthill shares its name with the Fonthill Kame, on which it is located, formed by glacial deposits. Effingham Creek, a cold-water stream, originates in the glacial silts and sands of Short Hills area of the moraine, northwest of Fonthill. Effingham Creek is a tributary to Twelve-Mile Creek, which empties into Lake Ontario.

For more about the geology of the town, see Fonthill Kame.

== History ==
There is some debate about the early days of Fonthill and how it became named.

First, there seems to be a record of settlement growing in 1829 and the area being called “Osborne’s Corners” around 1842; next it was “Temperanceville” and finally “Fonthill” after Fonthill Abbey in England.
Henry Giles, an early settler wrote his brother in England in July 1843 &quot;The principal man in the new village, a reformed drunkard, wishes to name it Temperanceville which I tell him is a vile name... I have proposed the name of Fonthill. Mount Albion has also been talked of, but no name is yet fixed upon.
It was named Temperanceville but the name of Fonthill was made somewhat official by an 1848 bylaw. Both names were in use with Temperanceville remaining into use as a local name until the 1860s or 70s and persisting in names like the Temperanceville Hotel. The post office dates from 1856.

Fonthill became an incorporated village in 1922.

Fonthill grew and smaller businesses did well.

One large business was Fonthill Nurseries. Started in 1837 the nursery, at its peak, rented or owned 1000 acres, employed 250 local people and shipped throughout Canada and abroad. The nursery closed in 1968.

A second large business was the Fonthill Canning Factory. Opening in 1912 primarily for the local tomato crop, they also canned local fruit. They factory employed about 260 local people and closed in 1958.

On June 10, 2006, Fonthill celebrated its 150th anniversary. The celebration was marked by the opening of the band stand (a replica of the original band stand that existed in the early 1900s), historical displays and a variety of musical and artistic presentations.

== Can-View Drive In==

On May 20, 1996, Fonthill&#x27;s Can-View Drive In was reportedly struck by a tornado, which resulted in the destruction of one of its four outdoor movie screens. The incident led to a widely reported urban legend that the screen was destroyed during a screening of the blockbuster film &quot;Twister (1996 film)&quot;, with some purported witnesses even claiming that the incident took place during a point in the film depicting the destruction of a drive-in movie theater. Though largely discredited, the legend has produced numerous accounts over the years, including a 2018 short documentary produced by &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.

==Location==
Fonthill is a fifteen-minute drive south of St. Catharines, five minutes northwest of Welland, twenty minutes west from Niagara Falls and twenty minutes north of Port Colborne. Its main access route is Highway 20, a portion of which is also known as Canboro Road, running west to east from Hamilton to Niagara Falls. Access to the United States is through either the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie, the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls, or the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge in Queenston.

== Economy ==
In the Town of Pelham, Fonthill is the commercial centre where residents have access to basic shopping necessities. It also has the Town of Pelham Municipal offices. Several retirement homes are located in the village of Fonthill.

Plenty of greenspace areas are located within the Fonthill village. A series of public access trails, the primary system being the Steve Bauer trails which are named after a Pelham Olympian, are built into the residential planning of Fonthill. Harold Black Park, named for a former Mayor, plays host to the town&#x27;s Canada Day festivities, which includes a parade down Haist Street. There is also a park named in honour of local golf legend Marlene Stewart Streit, which consists of a skate park, a large outdoor pool, and nature trails.

Fonthill has tried to balance its natural resources with a suitable development scheme, keeping an eye on a policy of smart growth.

Economic activities in the Town of Pelham ( Fonthill, Fenwick, Ridgeville and North Pelham) are diverse. Orchards of cherry, apple, and peach trees are located throughout the town. There are thousands of hectares of vineyards in Pelham (see also Viticulture) and a viable greenhouse industry.

Additionally, thousands of tonnes of aggregate material are removed each year from a large quarry at the top of the Fonthill Kame. Quarry sites in the area are usually rehabilitated. Fruit orchards have been developed in many of these sites, and a golf course occupies one.

== Education ==
Fonthill has three elementary schools: 
* Glynn A. Green Elementary School (operated by the DSBN) 
* A. K. Wigg Elementary School (operated by the DSBN) 
* St. Alexander Catholic Elementary School (operated by the NCDSB) opened in 1958. In 2011, it had an enrollment of about 450 pupils.

It has one high school:
* E.L. Crossley Secondary School (operated by the DSBN) attended by just under 900 students

Other educational resources:
* No. 613 Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps is based at the local Royal Canadian Legion hall. It is affiliated with the Lincoln and Welland Regiment.
* Fonthill Montessori Preschool takes children from 18 months to six years old. This is a private school.

<text>A patent model was a handmade miniature model no larger than 12&quot; by 12&quot; by 12&quot; (approximately 30 cm by 30 cm by 30 cm) that showed how an invention works. It was one of the most interesting early features of the United States patent system.

Since some early inventors had little technological or legal training, it was difficult for them to submit formal patent applications which require the novel features of an invention to be described in a written application and a number of diagrams.

== History ==

In the US, patent models were required from 1790 to 1880. The United States Congress abolished the legal requirement for them in 1870, but the U.S. Patent Office (USPTO) kept the requirement until 1880.

On July 31, 1790, inventor Samuel Hopkins of Pittsford, Vermont became the first person to be issued a patent in the United States. His patented invention was an improvement in the &quot;making of Pot Ash by a new apparatus &amp; process.&quot; These earliest patent law required that a working model of each invention be produced in miniature.

Some inventors still willingly submitted models at the turn of the twentieth century. In some cases, an inventor may still want to present a &quot;working model&quot; as evidence of actual reduction to practice in an interference proceeding. In some jurisdictions patent models stayed an aid to demonstrate the operation of the invention. In applications involving genetics, samples of genetic material or DNA sequences may be required.

== United States Patent Office&#x27;s collection of models ==

The United States Patent Office used to publicly display the models of approved patents. This collection of models suffered two major fires- one in 1836, and another in 1877. The 1877 fire destroyed 75,000 patent models.

In 1908, the Patent Office donated just over 1,000 patent models to United States National Museum. The remaining models were packed and moved several times before Congress chose to dissolve the collection in 1926. The Smithsonian Institution was allowed to choose first from the remaining models; accessions from the Patent Office now form part of the collection of over 10,000 patent models at the National Museum of American History.

Many models were sold off by the patent office in 1925 and were purchased by Sir Henry Wellcome, the founder of the Burroughs-Wellcome Company (now part of GlaxoSmithKline). Although he intended to establish a patent model museum, the stock market crash of 1929 damaged his fortune; the models were left in storage. After his death, the collection went through a number of ownership changes; a large portion of the collection—along with $1,000,000—was donated to the nonprofit United States Patent Model Foundation by Cliff Petersen. Rather than being put into a museum, these models were slowly sold off by the foundation. Much legal wrangling, purchasing, and re-selling ensued. A comparatively small number of models (4,000) were the property of the Rothschild Patent Museum until 2015, when they were transferred to Hagley Museum and Library, forming a part of the museum&#x27;s collection of patent models. With over 5,000 models, the Hagley&#x27;s is the largest private collection, and second in size only to the Smithsonian&#x27;s.

<text>Einar Jónsson (11 May 1874 – 18 October 1954) was an Icelandic sculptor, born in &quot;Galtafell&quot;, a farm in southern Iceland.

==Biography==

At a young age Einar proved himself to be an unusual child with an artistic bent. At that time there was little or no tradition of sculpture in Iceland, so Einar moved to Denmark where he attended the Copenhagen Academy of Art. In 1902 the Althing, the Icelandic parliament, awarded Einar a grant to study in Rome for 2 years. He returned from Rome to Copenhagen and settled down there. According to The Einar Jónsson Museum in Reykjavik, after residing in Rome:

&quot;Jónsson completely rejected naturalistic depiction and publicly criticized the classical art tradition, which he felt had weighed artists down. He emphasized the need for artists to forge their own path and cultivate their originality and imagination instead of following the footsteps of others. His ideas were related to German symbolism, and he developed a figurative language composed of interpretable symbols, personification and allegory.&quot;

In 1909, after living abroad for almost 20 years he made an arrangement with the Althing to provide him with a home and studio in Reykjavík. In return, he agreed to donate all his works to the country. Einar designed this combination living and working space in collaboration with Architect Einar Erlendsson, though early plans for the house were designed for him by Iceland&#x27;s State Architect, Guðjón Samúelsson, but these were never realised.

In 1914 Einar was awarded a commission by Joseph Bunford Samuel to create a statue of Icelandic explorer Þorfinnur Karlsefni (Thorfinn Karlsefni) for placement in Philadelphia. Bunford commissioned the sculpture through a bequest that his wife, Ellen Phillips Samuel, made to the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the Association for Public Art), specifying that the funds were to be used to create a series of sculptures &quot;emblematic of the history of America.&quot; &quot;Thorfinn Karlsefni&quot; (1915–1918) was installed along Philadelphia&#x27;s Kelly Drive near the Samuel Memorial and unveiled on 20 November 1920. There is another casting of the statue in Reykjavík, Iceland.

In 1917, the day after he married Anne Marie Jørgensen, he and his bride travelled to the United States to complete the work, and today Einar&#x27;s intrepid Norseman stands on East River Drive in Philadelphia. Several years later, in 1921, his second major North American work was erected when the Icelandic community in Manitoba, Canada purchased a casting of his Jón Sigurðsson statue and had it placed in the Manitoba Legislative Building grounds in Winnipeg. As with the version in Reykjavík, this statue included the bas relief &quot;The Pioneers&quot; on the base.

After two years in America, Einar returned to Iceland where he produced an amazing body of work, none of it seen outside the country. Unlike most other sculptors, Einar worked almost entirely in plaster. This had to do partly with the lack of good modeling clay in Iceland, but it allowed Einar to work on his individual sculptures for years. Spending over a decade on a particular piece was not uncommon for him. 

==Style of sculpture==

Einar&#x27;s works fall into three general categories. First, there were the public monuments that he was commissioned by the government to produce. The second group was private commissions that he obtained, consisting of portraits and cemetery monuments. The third collection consisted of the private works that he labored over as he became increasingly and deeply spiritually attuned and reclusive. In this large body of works Einar&#x27;s spiritual nature is clearly seen, though it is often difficult to describe. The themes for these works are frequently drawn from Christ&#x27;s consciousness, deep Cosmic spirituality like the eternal, infinite body and consciousness of the universe or God, Icelandic Mythology (Understanding of the so-called Norse mythology or North-East, North-West and even Central-European War-Godhs mythology is just a part of Icelandic Mythology and understanding or description of these is mostly derived from the Icelandic one) and Icelandic folk tales.
Einar&#x27;s world is populated by Elfs, &quot;Hidden people&quot; or &quot;Huldufolk&quot;, Vættir, Jötnar, angels and trolls, by beautiful women and bold warriors, and most of all a layer of symbolic content that can invariably be felt, but not always understood.

A hint to some deeper meaning in Einar&#x27;s powerful art is for example: &quot;Karma&quot; an eternal law of energy which returns all action towards its origin.
Like in Christ&#x27;s saying that one will reap what one has sown.
That same law or eternal principle, changes the will and desires of the psyche or so to speak. This is because of the fed up condition or state of &quot;mind&quot; or psyche.
One will eventually be tired and sick of destruction of nature or other people&#x27;s lives and the desire for constructive live-giving actions will be dominant.
One example of this is the sculpture &quot;Skuld&quot; where Einar uses Icelandic Mythological symbolism of &quot;Urdur, Verdandi and Skuld&quot; which were the witches of destiny or &quot;Karma&quot;.

There are also very positive hints in other pieces of Einar&#x27;s masterful art, to that, that every being or lifeform is eternal in its essence and evolves and chances on the outer sides or layers or material sides of its consciousness like the body, thoughts and desire.
This outer part or detail of the consciousness is not even understood in physics, phenomenon of time, space and matter that is to say.
The connection of the soul or rather its eternal and unchangeable part or layer of the whole consciousness to the world of time, space and matter is even further away from understanding except with symbols, and eventually later on, and only with self experience.

Henry Goddard Leach (see references) described Einar Jónsson like this:

:All things considered, Jonsson is unique in the world of art.
:If he had any prototype they were the symbolic artists of ancient
:Egypt. But Jonsson&#x27;s nearest spiritual relative is William Blake.

In recent years Einar&#x27;s plasters have been cast in bronze and placed in the garden of his home and studio or in city parks in Reykjavík and throughout Iceland.
He donated his work to the Einar Jónsson Museum in Reykjavík, which opened in 1923.

<text>Alessandro Damasceni Peretti di Montalto (1571 – 2 June 1623) was an Italian Catholic Cardinal Bishop. He received the title from his great-uncle Felice Piergentile after the latter was elected Pope Sixtus V on 24 April 1585, in the consistory on 13 May, and was installed as Cardinal Deacon of San Girolamo dei Croati on 14 June 1585; the cardinal was then fourteen years old. The Republic of Venice inscribed him in the &quot;Libro d&#x27;Oro&quot; as a patrician of Venice that same year. Though he was made the permanent governor of Fermo the following year, and was often the papal legate in Bologna, he was not made a bishop until 1620, when he became Cardinal-Bishop of Albano. He served also as Vice-Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church (1589–1623) and Cardinal Protector of the Kingdom of Poland (named on 19 September 1589 by King Zygmunt III Waza) and of the several religious orders.

Alessandro Peretti was born at Montalto delle Marche, the son of Fabio Damasceni and Maria Felice Mignucci Peretti, who was a niece of the pope on her mother&#x27;s side. Like his great-uncle before him, Alessandro Peretti was also known as Cardinal di Montalto. His primary works as a great patron were the Villa Lante at Bagnaia, where he contributed to the gardens a casino matching the earlier one, and the church (though not the facade) of Sant&#x27;Andrea della Valle in Rome, (begun in 1591), where Carlo Maderno constructed at the Cardinal&#x27;s personal expense the second-largest dome in Rome, 1608 to 1621.

As a cardinal, Peretti lived an extravagant lifestyle in which he indulged his taste for music and lavish theatrical productions staged in his residence, the Cancelleria palace. He retained several musicians in his service and encouraged the art of monody or solo song.

His portrait bust by Gian Lorenzo Bernini is at the Hamburg Kunsthalle. Surviving books from Cardinal Alessandro&#x27;s library reflect pride in his relationship to the Pope through elaborate armorials and his perfect taste.

Cardinal Montalto was in turn the uncle of Cardinal Francesco Peretti di Montalto (1597‑1655), raised to the purple in 1641.

<text>Shenzhou 2 () launched on January 9, 2001, was the second unmanned launch of the Shenzhou spacecraft. Inside the reentry capsule were a monkey, a dog and a rabbit in a test of the spaceship&#x27;s life support systems. The reentry module separated from the rest of the spacecraft after just over seven days in orbit, with the orbital module staying in orbit for another 220 days.

Shenzhou 2 tested the spacecraft much more rigorously than its predecessor Shenzhou 1. After being launched into a 196.5 by 333.8 km orbit, 20.5 hours after launch it circularised its orbit to 327.7 by 332.7 km. Around 1220 UTC on January 12 it once again changed its orbit to 329.3 by 339.4 km. A third orbit change came on January 15 328.7 by 345.4 km.

As well as the animal cargo, there were 64 different scientific payloads. 15 were carried in the reentry module, 12 in the orbital module and 37 on the forward external pallet. These included a microgravity crystallography experiment; animal species including six mice, and small aquatic and terrestrial organisms; cosmic ray and particle detectors and a gamma ray burst detectors. To test the radio transmitting systems taped messages were broadcast from the spacecraft.

==Successful reentry and failed landing==
The signal for retrofire was sent at about 1015 UTC on January 16 as the spacecraft passed over the South Atlantic Ocean off the coast of South Africa. It landed in Inner Mongolia at 11:22 UTC. No photos were released of the landing capsule leading to some speculation that the reentry was not completely successful, though Chinese officials kept silent, only responded anomaly. The Swedish Space Center news site reported that an unnamed source said one of the connections from the capsule to the single parachute failed leading to a hard landing. Later in 2017, it was revealed by Yang Liwei that the parachutes failed to open upon re-entry, which resulted in hard-landing. Some of the cargo was slightly burned.

The mission of the orbital module continued until it was commanded to fire its rockets to initiate reentry on August 24. It reentered over the western Pacific Ocean between Easter Island and Chile.

== Mission parameters ==

* Mass: 7,400 kg
* Perigee: 330 km
* Apogee: 346 km
* Inclination: 42.6°

<text>Neurospora crassa is a type of red bread mold of the phylum Ascomycota. The genus name, meaning &#x27;nerve spore&#x27; in Greek, refers to the characteristic striations on the spores. The first published account of this fungus was from an infestation of French bakeries in 1843.

&quot;Neurospora crassa&quot; is used as a model organism because it is easy to grow and has a haploid life cycle that makes genetic analysis simple since recessive traits will show up in the offspring. Analysis of genetic recombination is facilitated by the ordered arrangement of the products of meiosis in &quot;Neurospora&quot; ascospores. Its entire genome of seven chromosomes has been sequenced.

&quot;Neurospora&quot; was used by Edward Tatum and George Wells Beadle in their experiments for which they won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1958. Beadle and Tatum exposed &quot;N. crassa&quot; to x-rays, causing mutations. They then observed failures in metabolic pathways caused by errors in specific enzymes. This led them to propose the &quot;one gene, one enzyme&quot; hypothesis that specific genes code for specific proteins. Their hypothesis was later elaborated to enzyme pathways by Norman Horowitz, also working on &quot;Neurospora&quot;. As Norman Horowitz reminisced in 2004, &quot;These experiments founded the science of what Beadle and Tatum called &#x27;biochemical genetics&#x27;. In actuality, they proved to be the opening gun in what became molecular genetics and all developments that have followed from that.&quot;

In the 24 April 2003 issue of &quot;Nature&quot;, the genome of &quot;N. crassa&quot; was reported as completely sequenced. The genome is about 43 megabases long and includes approximately 10,000 genes. There is a project underway to produce strains containing knockout mutants of every &quot;N. crassa&quot; gene.

In its natural environment, &quot;N. crassa&quot; lives mainly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. It can be found growing on dead plant matter after fires.

Neurospora is actively used in research around the world. It is important in the elucidation of molecular events involved in circadian rhythms, epigenetics and gene silencing, cell polarity, cell fusion, development, as well as many aspects of cell biology and biochemistry.

==The sexual cycle==
Sexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) can only be formed when two mycelia of different mating type come together (see Figure). Like other Ascomycetes, &quot;N. crassa&quot; has two mating types that, in this case, are symbolized by &quot;A&quot; and &quot;a&quot;. There is no evident morphological difference between the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;a&quot; mating type strains. Both can form abundant protoperithecia, the female reproductive structure (see Figure). Protoperithecia are formed most readily in the laboratory when growth occurs on solid (agar) synthetic medium with a relatively low source of nitrogen. Nitrogen starvation appears to be necessary for expression of genes involved in sexual development. The protoperithecium consists of an ascogonium, a coiled multicellular hypha that is enclosed in a knot-like aggregation of hyphae. A branched system of slender hyphae, called the trichogyne, extends from the tip of the ascogonium projecting beyond the sheathing hyphae into the air. The sexual cycle is initiated (i.e. fertilization occurs) when a cell (usually a conidium) of opposite mating type contacts a part of the trichogyne (see Figure). Such contact can be followed by cell fusion leading to one or more nuclei from the fertilizing cell migrating down the trichogyne into the ascogonium. Since both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;a&quot; strains have the same sexual structures, neither strain can be regarded as exclusively male or female. However, as a recipient, the protoperithecium of both the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;a&quot; strains can be thought of as the female structure, and the fertilizing conidium can be thought of as the male participant.

The subsequent steps following fusion of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;a&quot; haploid cells, have been outlined by Fincham and Day and Wagner and Mitchell. After fusion of the cells, the further fusion of their nuclei is delayed. Instead, a nucleus from the fertilizing cell and a nucleus from the ascogonium become associated and begin to divide synchronously. The products of these nuclear divisions (still in pairs of unlike mating type, i.e. &quot;A/a&quot;) migrate into numerous ascogenous hyphae, which then begin to grow out of the ascogonium. Each of these ascogenous hypha bends to form a hook (or crozier) at its tip and the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;a&quot; pair of haploid nuclei within the crozier divide synchronously. Next, septa form to divide the crozier into three cells. The central cell in the curve of the hook contains one &quot;A&quot; and one &quot;a&quot; nucleus (see Figure). This binuclear cell initiates ascus formation and is called an &quot;ascus-initial&quot; cell. Next the two uninucleate cells on either side of the first ascus-forming cell fuse with each other to form a binucleate cell that can grow to form a further crozier that can then form its own ascus-initial cell. This process can then be repeated multiple times.

After formation of the ascus-initial cell, the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;a&quot; nucleus fuse with each other to form a diploid nucleus (see Figure). This nucleus is the only diploid nucleus in the entire life cycle of &quot;N. crassa&quot;. The diploid nucleus has 14 chromosomes formed from the two fused haploid nuclei that had 7 chromosomes each. Formation of the diploid nucleus is immediately followed by meiosis. The two sequential divisions of meiosis lead to four haploid nuclei, two of the &quot;A&quot; mating type and two of the &quot;a&quot; mating type. One further mitotic division leads to four &quot;A&quot; and four &quot;a&quot; nucleus in each ascus. Meiosis is an essential part of the life cycle of all sexually reproducing organisms, and in its main features, meiosis in &quot;N. crassa&quot; seems typical of meiosis generally.

As the above events are occurring, the mycelial sheath that had enveloped the ascogonium develops as the wall of the perithecium, becomes impregnated with melanin, and blackens. The mature perithecium has a flask-shaped structure.

A mature perithecium may contain as many as 300 asci, each derived from identical fusion diploid nuclei. Ordinarily, in nature, when the perithecia mature the ascospores are ejected rather violently into the air. These ascospores are heat resistant and, in the lab, require heating at 60 °C for 30 minutes to induce germination. For normal strains, the entire sexual cycle takes 10 to 15 days. In a mature ascus containing eight ascospores, pairs of adjacent spores are identical in genetic constitution, since the last division is mitotic, and since the ascospores are contained in the ascus sac that holds them in a definite order determined by the direction of nuclear segregations during meiosis. Since the four primary products are also arranged in sequence, a first division segregation pattern of genetic markers can be distinguished from a second division segregation pattern.

==Fine structure genetic analysis==
Because of the above features &quot;N. crassa&quot; was found to be very useful for the study of genetic events occurring in individual meioses. Mature asci from a perithecium can be separated on a microscope slide and the spores experimentally manipulated. These studies usually involved the separate culture of individual ascospores resulting from a single meiotic event and determining the genotype of each spore. Studies of this type, carried out in several different laboratories, established the phenomenon of &quot;gene conversion&quot; (e.g. see references).

As an example of the gene conversion phenomenon, consider genetic crosses of two &quot;N. crassa&quot; mutant strains defective in gene &quot;pan-2&quot;. This gene is necessary for the synthesis of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), and mutants defective in this gene can be experimentally identified by their requirement for pantothenic acid in their growth medium. The two &quot;pan-2&quot; mutations B5 and B3 are located at different sites in the &quot;pan-2&quot; gene, so that a cross of B5 ´ B3 yields wild-type recombinants at low frequency. An analysis of 939 asci in which the genotypes of all meiotic products (ascospores) could be determined found 11 asci with an exceptional segregation pattern. These included six asci in which there was one wild-type meiotic product but no expected reciprocal double-mutant (B5B3) product. Furthermore, in three asci the ratio of meiotic products was 1B5:3B3, rather than in the expected 2:2 ratio. This study, as well as numerous additional studies in &quot;N. crassa&quot; and other fungi (reviewed by Whitehouse), led to an extensive characterization of gene conversion. It became clear from this work that gene conversion events arise when a molecular recombination event happens to occur near the genetic markers under study (e.g. &quot;pan-2&quot; mutations in the above example). Thus studies of gene conversion allowed insight into the details of the molecular mechanism of recombination. Over the decades since the original observations of Mary Mitchell in 1955, a sequence of molecular models of recombination have been proposed based on both emerging genetic data from gene conversion studies and studies of the reaction capabilities of DNA. Current understanding of the molecular mechanism of recombination is discussed in the Wikipedia articles Gene conversion and Genetic recombination. An understanding of recombination is relevant to several fundamental biologic problems, such the role of recombination and recombinational repair in cancer (see BRCA1) and the adaptive function of meiosis (see Meiosis).

==Adaptive function of mating type==
That mating in &quot;N. crassa&quot; can only occur between strains of different mating types suggests that some degree of outcrossing is favored by natural selection. In haploid multicellular fungi, such as &quot;N. crassa&quot;, meiosis occurring in the brief diploid stage is one of their most complex processes. Although physically much larger than the diploid stage, the haploid multicellular vegetative stage characteristically has a simple modular construction with little differentiation. In &quot;N. crassa&quot;, recessive mutations affecting the diploid stage of the life cycle are quite frequent in natural populations. These mutations, when homozygous in the diploid stage, often cause spores to have maturation defects or to produce barren fruiting bodies with few ascospores (sexual spores). Most of these homozygous mutations cause abnormal meiosis (e.g., disturbed chromosome pairing or pachytene or diplotene). The number of genes affecting the diploid stage was estimated to be at least 435 (about 4% of the total number of 9,730 genes). Thus, outcrossing, promoted by the necessity for the union of opposite mating types, likely provides the benefit of masking recessive mutations that would otherwise be harmful to sexual spore formation (see Complementation (genetics)).

==Current research ==
&quot;Neurospora crassa&quot; is not only a model organism for the study of phenotypic types in knock-out variants, but a particularly useful organism widely used in computational biology and the circadian clock. It has a natural reproductive cycle of 22 hours and is influenced by external factors such as light and temperature. Knock out variants of wild type &quot;N. crassa&quot; are widely studied to determine the influence of particular genes (&quot;see Frequency (gene)&quot;).

<doc id="869812" wikidata="Q677820" url="?curid=869812" title="Shenzhou 3">
<text>Shenzhou 3 () launched on March 25, 2002, was the third unmanned launch of China&#x27;s Shenzhou spacecraft. This was the first Shenzhou spacecraft launched that could have actually carried a human and as such the main objective of the mission was to test the systems required to support a human in space. On board it carried a dummy to simulate physiological signals of a human — palpitation, pulse, breathing, eating, metabolism, and excretion.

The launch had been delayed several months due to design changes. It had been planned that Shenzhou 3 would use a new interior design but implementation problems meant reverting to the previous version. The rocket and spacecraft were eventually rolled out on the pad during the Fifth Session of the Ninth National People&#x27;s Congress and the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference in early March 2002.

== Orbit ==
It is thought that Shenzhou 3 changed its orbit twice during the mission. The first was on March 29 at 10:15 UTC when the aft maneuvering thrusters fired for about 8 seconds putting it into a 330.2 km x 337.2 km orbit. The second was on March 31. Both times were to raise its orbit. Shenzhou 3 operated in a slightly less inclined orbit of 42.40° to the previous Shenzhou 1 and 2 flights, which were in about 42.59° inclined orbits.

== Scientific payload ==
On board were carried 44 different experiments. These included an imaging spectrograph, cloud sensor, radiation sensor, solar ultraviolet monitor, solar constant monitor, atmospheric composition detector, atmospheric density detector, multi-chamber space crystallization furnace, space protein crystal equipment, a cell bioreactor, a solid matter tracking detector and microgravity gauge. Also on board was a video camera that broadcast images of the Earth as seen through one of the windows on the spacecraft. To test the radio transmitting systems, a pre-recorded female voice was transmitted.

== Reentry ==
Shenzhou 3 reentered and landed successfully after 107 orbits. Unlike Shenzhou 2 where no photos had been released of the landing capsule, this time photos were released confirmed a successful touchdown. As with Shenzhou 2 the Orbital Module stayed in orbit for an extended mission. During this time it made some orbital adjustments, raising its orbit. Although it was speculated that it could serve as a docking target for Shenzhou 4, this did not turn out to be the case. Its mission ended in October 2002 and it reentered on November 12 at about 06:38 UTC over 22°S 109° E over the Indian Ocean off western Australia.

== Launch ==
The launch of Shenzhou 3 was attended by General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President Jiang Zemin. Along with him were Wu Bangguo, member of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice-Premier; Zeng Qinghong, alternate member of the Politburo and member of the Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party; Yu Yongbo, member of the Central Military Commission and director of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s General Political Department; and Cao Gangchuan, member of the Central Military Commission and director of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s General Armament Department.

== Escape system ==
Shenzhou 3 was the first Long March 2F launch to feature a working launch escape system. Also added were two manual system that would have allowed an astronaut to activate the system in case of emergency. It was tested during the launch phase though Chinese officials did not confirm if the test was successful.

A day after launch China Central Television broadcast an artist impression of the spacecraft in orbit. Of interest was that the front of the orbital module appeared to have been equipped with three seven element log-periodic antennae. It is thought that it was designed for a frequency range of 300–1000 MHz. Also shown was an animation of the orbital module after it had separated from the rest of the spacecraft. Three booms were extended from the front package, one left, another right and the third forward. It is speculated that this could have been some sort of ELINT package.

<doc id="869819" wikidata="Q1814151" url="?curid=869819" title="Minton's Playhouse">
<text>Minton&#x27;s Playhouse is a jazz club and bar located on the first floor of the Cecil Hotel at 210 West 118th Street in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City. It is a registered trademark of Housing and Services, Inc. a New York City nonprofit provider of supportive housing. The door to the actual club itself is at 206 West 118th Street where there is a small plaque. Minton&#x27;s was founded by tenor saxophonist Henry Minton in 1938. Minton&#x27;s is known for its role in the development of modern jazz, also known as bebop, where in its jam sessions in the early 1940s, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, Kenny Clarke, Charlie Christian, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie pioneered the new music. Minton&#x27;s thrived for three decades until its decline near the end of the 1960s, and its eventual closure in 1974. After being closed for more than 30 years, the newly remodeled club reopened on May 19, 2006, under the name Uptown Lounge at Minton&#x27;s Playhouse, which operated until 2010, before re-opening as Minton&#x27;s Playhouse in 2013. 

== Beginnings ==
Minton&#x27;s original owner, Henry Minton, was known in Harlem for being the first ever black delegate to the American Federation of Musicians Local 802. In addition, he had been the manager of the
Rhythm Club, in Harlem, in the early part of the 1930s, a venue which Louis Armstrong, Fats Waller, James P. Johnson, and Earl Hines frequented. The novelist Ralph Ellison later wrote that because of his union background and music business experience, Minton was aware of the economic and artistic needs of jazz musicians in New York in the late 1930s. Minton&#x27;s popularity and his penchant for generosity with food and loans made his club a favorite hang-out for musicians.

Minton developed a policy of holding regular jam sessions at his club, which would later prove to be a significant factor in the development of bebop. Because of his union ties, Minton was able to ensure that musicians would not be fined for their participation in jam sessions, an activity that was prohibited by the union. Dizzy Gillespie recalled that there were &quot;walking&quot; delegates from the union that would follow musicians around and fine them &quot;a hundred to five hundred dollars&quot; for participating in jam sessions, but that they were &quot;somewhat immune from this at Minton&#x27;s because of Henry Minton&quot;. According to Ralph Ellison, Minton&#x27;s Playhouse provided &quot;a retreat, a homogeneous community where a collectivity of common experience could find continuity and meaningful expression&quot;.

== 1940s ==
In late 1940, Minton hired Teddy Hill, a former bandleader, to manage the club. Building in the same direction that Minton had started, Hill used his connections from the Savoy Ballroom (where his band used to play), and the Apollo Theater to increase the interest in the club. Hill put together the house band which included Thelonious Monk on piano, Joe Guy on trumpet, Nick Fenton on bass, and Kenny Clarke on drums. Both Clarke and Guy were in Teddy Hill&#x27;s band before it disbanded in 1939. According to Clarke, Teddy Hill wanted to &quot;do something for the guys that had worked with him&quot; by giving them work during difficult times. The house band at Minton&#x27;s in 1941, with the addition of frequent guests, Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Christian, was at the center of the emergence of bebop in the early 1940s. Later, the band was led by tenor saxophonist Kermit Scott.

== Monday celebrity nights ==
A feature of Minton&#x27;s Playhouse during Teddy Hill&#x27;s tenure as manager was the Monday Celebrity Nights sponsored by the Schiffmans who owned the nearby Apollo Theater. The Schiffmans treated their performers to free dinner and drinks after the conclusion of a long week of work. The food at Minton&#x27;s became almost as popular as the music as noted by many present at that time. In an interview with Al Fraser (1979), Dizzy Gillespie told his recollection of Monday nights at Minton&#x27;s:
On Monday nights, we used to have a ball. Everybody from the Apollo, on Monday nights, was a guest at Minton&#x27;s, the whole band. We had a big jam session. Monday night was the big night, the musician&#x27;s night off. There was always some food there for you. Oh, that part was beautiful. Teddy Hill treated the guys well.
== Cutting sessions and duels ==
During the Monday Celebrity Nights, many guest musicians such as Roy Eldridge, Hot Lips Page, Ben Webster, Don Byas, and Lester Young would sit in. The trumpet duels between Roy Eldridge and Dizzy Gillespie became legendary, with Gillespie eventually surpassing his mentor. Speaking to Al Fraser, Gillespie recalled how Thelonious Monk one night teased Eldridge after being out-played by Gillespie saying, &quot;Look, you&#x27;re supposed to be the greatest trumpet player in the world ... but that&#x27;s the best.&quot; Eldridge was an established musician in the older swing style, but he was an active figure at Minton&#x27;s and contributed through his encouragement of Gillespie and Clarke to further their explorations.

Eldridge and the other swing musicians who participated in the early cutting sessions at Minton&#x27;s played an important role in the evolution of swing toward bebop by inspiring the next generation of musicians. A young Sonny Stitt witnessed the great battles between the master saxophonists of the day in the early 1940s:
Can you imagine Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, Chu Berry, Don Byas, and Ben Webster on the same little jam session? They had a place called Minton&#x27;s Playhouse in New York. It&#x27;s kaput now. And these guys, man, nothing like it. And guess who won the fight? ... Don Byas walked off with everything.

Byas was one of the first tenor saxophonists to assimilate bebop into his style, in contrast to Young, Hawkins, and Webster, who stayed close to their swing roots through the development of bebop.

Herman Pritchard, who tended bar at Minton&#x27;s &quot;in the old days&quot;, would watch as Ben Webster and Lester Young would &quot;fight on those saxophones ... like dogs in the road&quot;. Ralph Ellison believes that what was occurring at Minton&#x27;s from 1941 to 1942 was a &quot;continuing symposium of jazz, a summation of all the styles, personal and traditional, of jazz&quot;.

== Charlie Christian and the house band ==
One of the pioneers of the new style, which would eventually become known as bebop, was the young electric guitarist from Benny Goodman&#x27;s band, Charlie Christian. He played nightly at Minton&#x27;s and was one of its stars. Christian was in his mid-twenties in 1941; his time at Minton&#x27;s was significant, but brief; he would die the following March suffering from tuberculosis in a sanatorium. As evidenced by recordings made by Columbia University student Jerry Newman in 1941, Christian&#x27;s playing was breaking new ground. Gunther Schuller&#x27;s assessment of Christian&#x27;s playing on those recordings is as follows:
His work here seems to me relentlessly creative, endlessly fertile, and is so in a way that marks a new stylistic departure. Indeed, it signals the birth of a new language in jazz, which even [Charlie] Parker did not have as clearly in focus at that time.

Kenny Clarke and the band at Minton&#x27;s would look forward with anticipation to Christian&#x27;s arrival after finishing his set with Goodman. Christian was admired by his peers at Minton&#x27;s, including Thelonious Monk who &quot;loved listening to Charlie play solos with fluid lines and interesting harmonies&quot;. Hill bought Christian an amplifier to use so he would not have to bring his along. Hill retained it up until his death in 1978.

== Bird and Dizzy ==
Soon after Charlie Christian&#x27;s death, alto saxophonist Charlie Parker emerged as a new leader of the bebop movement. Parker&#x27;s collaboration with Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk and Kenny Clarke, at sessions at Minton&#x27;s, would build on the earlier experiments of Christian. Before 1942, Parker was known to have spent more time at Clark Monroe&#x27;s Uptown House, another Harlem club where jam sessions extended into the early morning than he spent playing at Minton&#x27;s. After leaving Jay McShann&#x27;s band at the end of 1941, Parker joined Earl Hines&#x27;s band in 1942 and was reunited with Dizzy Gillespie, whom he had met sometime earlier. It was during this period of time starting in 1942 that Parker, nicknamed &#x27;Bird&#x27;, could be found sitting-in at Minton&#x27;s on Monday nights as recalled by Miles Davis:
On Monday nights at Minton&#x27;s, Bird and Dizzy would come in to jam, so you&#x27;d have a thousand [players] up there trying to get in so they could listen to and play with Bird and Dizzy. But most of the musicians in the know didn&#x27;t even think about playing when Bird and Dizzy came to jam. We would just sit out in the audience, to listen and learn.

Parker never was officially a member of the house band at Minton&#x27;s during that period. However, sensing his importance to the bebop movement, Clarke and Monk approached Teddy Hill about hiring Parker into the band. Hill refused so Clarke and Monk decided to pay Parker out of their salaries.

After Parker&#x27;s arrival on the scene in Harlem, other new players followed. Miles Davis, Fats Navarro, Dexter Gordon, Art Blakey, Max Roach and many others were drawn to Minton&#x27;s. Miles Davis&#x27;s search for Charlie Parker brought him to Minton&#x27;s where he &quot;cut his teeth&quot; at the jam sessions. Davis remembered:
The way [it] went down up at Minton&#x27;s was you brought your horn and hoped that Bird and Dizzy would invite you to play with them up on stage. And when this happened you better not blow it ... People would watch for clues from Bird and Dizzy, and if they smiled when you finished playing, then that meant your playing was good.
== Sitting-in ==
The house band at Minton&#x27;s Playhouse developed ways of weeding out less skilled musicians who wanted to sit in. According to bassist Milt Hinton, Gillespie prompted the band to play standards, such as Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;, in difficult keys in order to discourage beginners from sitting in. Bassist Charles Mingus remembered being required to audition to get up on stage:
To play at Minton&#x27;s you couldn&#x27;t just walk in and grab a bass. They made you go in a back room or a kitchen and call a few tunes. They did it to me too. They said, &quot;Can you play &#x27;Perdido&#x27;? Can you play &#x27;Body and Soul&#x27;?&quot;

Practices such as these challenged up-and-coming jazz musicians to get their acts together in order to participate in the jam sessions, which kept the music at a high level.

== End of an era ==
Minton&#x27;s changed its open jam policy in favor of big-name acts in the 1950s. By the late 1960s, bands were no longer at the cutting edge. Harlem writer, Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones) wrote in &quot;Black Music&quot; (1967): &quot;The groups that come into Minton&#x27;s are stand-up replicas of what was a highly experimental twenty-five years ago.&quot; Although the club was open for a little more than three decades, Minton&#x27;s Playhouse will always be associated with the 1940s and the jam sessions that gave birth to bebop. Minton&#x27;s thrived for three decades until its decline near the end of the 1960s, and its eventual closure in 1974.

== Revival ==
After being closed for more than 30 years, the newly remodeled club reopened on May 19, 2006, under the name Uptown Lounge at Minton&#x27;s Playhouse. However, the reopened club was closed again in 2010.

In 2013, Richard Parsons revived Minton&#x27;s as an upscale Jazz club and restaurant. The restaurant&#x27;s cuisine was entrusted to restaurant owner Alexander Smalls. The new club was designed by architect Sarah Garcia of Estudio Sarah Garcia and a new brand identity designed by New York designer John Simoudis.

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Hotel Cecil and Minton&#x27;s Playhouse as a city landmark on June 27, 2023.

<doc id="869824" wikidata="Q1680124" url="?curid=869824" title="James Campbell, 1st Baron Glenavy">
<text>James Henry Mussen Campbell, 1st Baron Glenavy, (4 April 1851 – 22 March 1931), was an Irish lawyer, politician in the British Parliament and later in the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State. He was also Lord Chancellor of Ireland.

==Barrister and judge==

He was born in Dublin and educated at Dr. Stacpoole&#x27;s School in Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire) and Trinity College Dublin, graduating BA in 1874. After being called to the Irish bar in 1878, Campbell was made an Irish Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1892 and six years later was elected Irish Unionist MP for the Dublin seat of St. Stephen&#x27;s Green. The following year he was called to the English bar, and in February 1902 was elected a Bencher of Gray&#x27;s Inn. Campbell became Solicitor-General for Ireland in 1901, and in 1903 he was elected to the House of Commons as representative for Dublin University. He was made the country&#x27;s Attorney General in 1905, being appointed an Irish Privy Counsellor, and in 1916 became Lord Chief Justice of Ireland.

Considerable controversy surrounded the efforts to appoint him a judge: the initial proposal to appoint him Lord Chancellor of Ireland met with fierce resistance from Irish Nationalists, and great efforts were made to find another position for him. It appears that Baron Atkinson was asked to retire from the House of Lords but refused. Pressure was then put on the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, Richard Cherry, who was seriously ill, to step down. Cherry despite his failing health was initially reluctant to do so, but eventually agreed to retire in December 1916. Maurice Healy in his memoirs remarks that Campbell was considered the finest Irish barrister of his time, with the possible exception of Edward Carson, but as a judge, he was somewhat fretful and impatient, with a tendency (admittedly not uncommon in judges) to interrupt counsel.

==Irish War of Independence==
Campbell was created a baronet in 1917, and the following year was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland. During the Irish War of Independence, his position was somewhat ambiguous. As head of the Irish judiciary, he was naturally expected by the British Government to do all in his power to uphold British rule; but as his later career showed he was not opposed to the existence of the Irish Free State and was quite willing to play a role in the new Government. This pragmatic attitude naturally infuriated the British administration, some of whom regarded it as a betrayal. Mark Sturgis, the Dublin Castle official whose diaries give a vivid picture of these particular years of British rule, condemned Campbell bitterly as a coward who &quot;does nothing and apparently thinks of nothing but the best way to show Sinn Féin that he is neutral and passive&quot;. Campbell&#x27;s successor as Lord Chancellor, Sir John Ross, made similar criticism. Irish historian R. B. McDowell comments that neither Sturgis nor Ross intended to stay in Southern Ireland when their Castle appointments ended, respectively returning to England and relocating to County Tyrone via London. 

On relinquishing office in 1921, Campbell was ennobled as Baron Glenavy, of Milltown in the County of Dublin.

==First Cathaoirleach of Free State Seanad==
In 1922 he was nominated to the new Free State Seanad by W. T. Cosgrave, and was elected by almost all of his fellow senators as its first Cathaoirleach (chairperson) on 12 December 1922. This was in the midst of the Irish Civil War and shortly after his appointment his family home in Kimmage, Dublin was burnt by the anti-Treaty IRA, as part of their campaign against the representatives of the new state.

After the 1925 Seanad election he was again elected as Cathaoirleach on 9 December 1925 by a vote of 40–12. He did not seek re-election when his term in the Seanad expired in 1928.

==Courts of Justice Act 1924==
In January 1923, Glenavy chaired the Judicial Committee appointed to advise the Executive Council of the Irish Free State on the creation of a new courts system for the Irish Free State. His recommendations were implemented in the Courts of Justice Act 1924 which largely created the Irish courts system as it currently exists. This replaced, and indeed replicated the existing court system as established by the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The Dáil Courts were declared to have been illegal, but their outstanding &#x27;judgements&#x27; were conferred with legal standing by a separate Act of the Oireachtas. Glenavy clashed with another member of the committee, Hugh Kennedy, soon to become the first Chief Justice of Ireland, who was in favour of far more radical changes than those recommended by Glenavy and a majority of the committee. Political differences were compounded by the fact that the two men disliked each other personally.

Lord Glenavy died in Dublin in 1931 and was buried in the city&#x27;s Mount Jerome Cemetery.

==Family==
His parents were Colonel William Mussen Campbell and Delia Poole Graham, the daughter of Henry Francis Graham of Newtown Abbey, County Kildare. William and Delia lived at Prospect House, Terenure, County Dublin. His paternal grandfather&#x27;s family was from Glenavy and Magheragall in County Antrim.

In 1884, he married Emily McCullough and they had three sons and one daughter, including Charles and Cecil. His son Charles married the Irish artist Beatrice Elvery, whose family founded Elverys Sports.

His grandson, under the name Patrick Campbell, was a noted satirist in the early years of television. He was a longtime captain of one of the panels in the BBC gameshow &quot;Call My Bluff&quot; against British comedy writer Frank Muir. Another grandson, Michael Campbell, later the 4th and last Lord Glenavy was the author of the work of gay literature, &quot;Lord Dismiss Us&quot;.

<doc id="869825" wikidata="Q736111" url="?curid=869825" title="Optical flow">
<text>Optical flow or optic flow is the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and a scene. Optical flow can also be defined as the distribution of apparent velocities of movement of brightness pattern in an image.

The concept of optical flow was introduced by the American psychologist James J. Gibson in the 1940s to describe the visual stimulus provided to animals moving through the world. Gibson stressed the importance of optic flow for affordance perception, the ability to discern possibilities for action within the environment. Followers of Gibson and his ecological approach to psychology have further demonstrated the role of the optical flow stimulus for the perception of movement by the observer in the world; perception of the shape, distance and movement of objects in the world; and the control of locomotion.

The term optical flow is also used by roboticists, encompassing related techniques from image processing and control of navigation including motion detection, object segmentation, time-to-contact information, focus of expansion calculations, luminance, motion compensated encoding, and stereo disparity measurement.

== Estimation ==

Optical flow can be estimated in a number of ways. Broadly, optical flow estimation approaches can be divided into machine learning based models (sometimes called data-driven models), classical models (sometimes called knowledge-driven models) which do not use machine learning and hybrid models which use aspects of both learning based models and classical models.

===Classical Models===

Many classical models use the intuitive assumption of &quot;brightness constancy&quot;; that even if a point moves between frames, its brightness stays constant.
To formalise this intuitive assumption, consider two consecutive frames from a video sequence, with intensity formula_1, where formula_2 refer to pixel coordinates and formula_3 refers to time.
In this case, the brightness constancy constraint is
:formula_4
where formula_5 is the displacement vector between a point in the first frame and the corresponding point in the second frame.
By itself, the brightness constancy constraint cannot be solved for formula_6 and formula_7 at each pixel, since there is only one equation and two unknowns.
This is known as the &quot;aperture problem&quot;.
Therefore, additional constraints must be imposed to estimate the flow field.

==== Regularized Models ====
Perhaps the most natural approach to addressing the aperture problem is to apply a smoothness constraint or a &quot;regularization constraint&quot; to the flow field.
One can combine both of these constraints to formulate estimating optical flow as an optimization problem, where the goal is to minimize the cost function of the form,
:formula_8
where formula_9 is the extent of the images formula_10, formula_11 is the gradient operator, formula_12 is a constant, and formula_13 is a loss function.
This optimisation problem is difficult to solve owing to its non-linearity.
To address this issue, one can use a &quot;variational approach&quot; and linearise the brightness constancy constraint using a first order Taylor series approximation. Specifically, the brightness constancy constraint is approximated as,
:formula_14
For convenience, the derivatives of the image, formula_15, formula_16 and formula_17 are often condensed to become formula_18, formula_19 and formula_20.
Doing so, allows one to rewrite the linearised brightness constancy constraint as,
:formula_21
The optimization problem can now be rewritten as
:formula_22
For the choice of formula_23, this method is the same as the Horn-Schunck method.

Of course, other choices of cost function have been used such as formula_24, which is a differentiable variant of the formula_25 norm.
To solve the aforementioned optimization problem, one can use the Euler-Lagrange equations to provide a system of partial differential equations for each point in formula_1. In the simplest case of using formula_23, these equations are,
:formula_28
:formula_29
where formula_30 denotes the Laplace operator.
Since the image data is made up of discrete pixels, these equations are discretised.
Doing so yields a system of linear equations which can be solved for formula_31 at each pixel, using an iterative scheme such as Gauss-Seidel.

An alternate approach is to discretize the optimisation problem and then perform a search of the possible formula_31 values without linearising it.
This search is often performed using Max-flow min-cut theorem algorithms, linear programming or belief propagation methods.

==== Parametric Models ====

Instead of applying the regularization constraint on a point by point basis as per a regularized model, one can group pixels into regions and estimate the motion of these regions.
This is known as a &quot;parametric model&quot;, since the motion of these regions is parameterized.
In formulating optical flow estimation in this way, one makes the assumption that the motion field in each region be fully characterised by a set of parameters.
Therefore, the goal of a parametric model is to estimate the motion parameters that minimise a loss function which can be written as,
:formula_33
where formula_34 is the set of parameters determining the motion in the region formula_35, formula_36 is data cost term, formula_37 is a weighting function that determines the influence of pixel formula_2 on the total cost, and formula_39 and formula_40 are frames 1 and 2 from a pair of consecutive frames.
The simplest parametric model is the Lucas-Kanade method. This uses rectangular regions and parameterises the motion as purely translational. The Lucas-Kanade method uses the original brightness constancy constrain as the data cost term and selects formula_41.
This yields the local loss function,
:formula_42
Other possible local loss functions include the negative normalized cross-correlation between the two frames.

===Learning Based Models===

Instead of seeking to model optical flow directly, one can train a machine learning system to estimate optical flow. Since 2015, when FlowNet was proposed, learning based models have been applied to optical flow and have gained prominence. Initially, these approaches were based on Convolutional Neural Networks arranged in a U-Net architecture. However, with the advent of transformer architecture in 2017, transformer based models have gained prominence.

== Uses ==

Motion estimation and video compression have developed as a major aspect of optical flow research. While the optical flow field is superficially similar to a dense motion field derived from the techniques of motion estimation, optical flow is the study of not only the determination of the optical flow field itself, but also of its use in estimating the three-dimensional nature and structure of the scene, as well as the 3D motion of objects and the observer relative to the scene, most of them using the image Jacobian.

Optical flow was used by robotics researchers in many areas such as: object detection and tracking, image dominant plane extraction, movement detection, robot navigation and visual odometry. Optical flow information has been recognized as being useful for controlling micro air vehicles.

The application of optical flow includes the problem of inferring not only the motion of the observer and objects in the scene, but also the structure of objects and the environment. Since awareness of motion and the generation of mental maps of the structure of our environment are critical components of animal (and human) vision, the conversion of this innate ability to a computer capability is similarly crucial in the field of machine vision.

Consider a five-frame clip of a ball moving from the bottom left of a field of vision, to the top right. Motion estimation techniques can determine that on a two dimensional plane the ball is moving up and to the right and vectors describing this motion can be extracted from the sequence of frames. For the purposes of video compression (e.g., MPEG), the sequence is now described as well as it needs to be. However, in the field of machine vision, the question of whether the ball is moving to the right or if the observer is moving to the left is unknowable yet critical information. Not even if a static, patterned background were present in the five frames, could we confidently state that the ball was moving to the right, because the pattern might have an infinite distance to the observer.

==Optical flow sensor==
Various configurations of optical flow sensors exist. One configuration is an image sensor chip connected to a processor programmed to run an optical flow algorithm. Another configuration uses a vision chip, which is an integrated circuit having both the image sensor and the processor on the same die, allowing for a compact implementation. An example of this is a generic optical mouse sensor used in an optical mouse. In some cases the processing circuitry may be implemented using analog or mixed-signal circuits to enable fast optical flow computation using minimal current consumption.

One area of contemporary research is the use of neuromorphic engineering techniques to implement circuits that respond to optical flow, and thus may be appropriate for use in an optical flow sensor. Such circuits may draw inspiration from biological neural circuitry that similarly responds to optical flow.

Optical flow sensors are used extensively in computer optical mice, as the main sensing component for measuring the motion of the mouse across a surface.

Optical flow sensors are also being used in robotics applications, primarily where there is a need to measure visual motion or relative motion between the robot and other objects in the vicinity of the robot. The use of optical flow sensors in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), for stability and obstacle avoidance, is also an area of current research.

<text>Moseley Bog and Joy&#x27;s Wood Local Nature Reserve, formerly The Dell, is a Local Nature Reserve in the Moseley area of Birmingham, England, with an area of about 12 ha (29 acres). Along with the nearby Sarehole Mill, and a number of other sites, it forms part of the Shire Country Park.

==History==
Evidence of human activity at Moseley Bog dates back some three thousand years, to the Bronze Age, in the form of burnt mounds on the banks of Coldbath Brook, which runs through the bog. Comprising piles of cracked stones and burnt wood, archaeologists believe them to be the remains of sweat lodges – huts, or bender tents, in which water was poured over heated stones to create a sauna, often for the purpose of spiritual purification, followed by a cold bath. The mounds and their surrounding area are Scheduled Ancient Monuments.

The forested area of the bog is a surviving fragment of primeval wildwood, much of the surrounding parts of which had been cleared by the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, replaced with meadowland and common land, used for grazing livestock and strip farming. The boggy area was once a secondary reservoir to feed the millpond at Sarehole Mill. Although now drained, the embankment on its eastern side remains. Coldbath Brook flows from Coldbath Pool, in what is now Moseley Golf Course, through a culvert, then through Moseley Bog as an open stream, and is then culverted to the millpond, from whence it flows to its confluence with the River Cole.

The western half of the current nature reserve, adjoining the bog, had been used by Birmingham City Council as a landfill site from 1960 to 1973, when it was levelled off and converted into a playing field for Moseley School.

In 1980 the city council announced its intention to build a housing estate on the bog. This led to the successful &quot;Save Our Bog&quot; campaign, organised by the urban conservation activist Joy Fifer, which saved the site from development and helped inspire the Urban Wildlife movement. Fifer&#x27;s campaign also popularised the name &quot;Moseley Bog&quot; for the site, which had hitherto been known as &quot;The Dell&quot;. Starting with a major tree planting initiative in 1987, the school playing field adjoining the bog, which had proven to be damp and unsuitable, has been allowed to revert to natural woodland, to create what is now known as &quot;Joy&#x27;s Wood&quot;, named after Joy Fifer.

In 1984 Moseley Bog hosted the first ever International Dawn Chorus Day, organised by the Urban Wildlife Trust, founded in Birmingham in 1980 and now the Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country. The whole site was declared a Local Nature Reserve (LNR) by Birmingham City Council on 17 July 1991. Much of the area comprising Moseley Bog had been declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1980. However, following its LNR declaration and re-evaluation by English Nature the site was denotified as an SSSI on 21 July 1992, but remains a locally designated Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC). In 2000 it was formally renamed &quot;Moseley Bog and Joy&#x27;s Wood Local Nature Reserve&quot;.

In August 2006 a public consultation on proposals to conserve the site, enhance access and encourage a wider audience was launched. In March 2010, a lottery grant of £376,500 was awarded for improvements and restoration while management of the site was leased to the Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country by the city council. On 26 June 2011, a formal reopening was conducted by the Lord Mayor of Birmingham, Councillor Anita Ward.

The firepit in Joy&#x27;s Wood, where bonfires are allowed, is a popular meeting place for local Pagan groups, including the Daughters of Frya – Oera Linda Order of Priestesses and Dinas Canolog – The Grove of the Central City. Since 2011 it has also been the venue for the &quot;In Memory of a Free Festival&quot; event at the summer solstice.

==Culture==
J. R. R. Tolkien lived nearby, as a child, and acknowledged the site as inspiration for the ancient forests in his books &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Nearby Sarehole Mill and the surrounding area on the River Cole are said to have been inspiration for Tolkien&#x27;s writings.

In 1966, in an interview for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Tolkien said (emphasis added):

A house adjacent to the reserve (since demolished) was used by reggae band UB40 as a studio for their earliest recordings.

<text>KCAL-TV (channel 9) is an independent television station in Los Angeles, California, United States. It is owned by the CBS News and Stations group alongside CBS West Coast flagship KCBS-TV (channel 2). The two stations share studios at the Radford Studio Center on Radford Avenue in the Studio City section of Los Angeles; KCAL-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Mount Wilson.

==History==
===KFI-TV (1948–1951)===
Channel 9 signed on the air as commercial station KFI-TV on August 25, 1948, owned by Earle C. Anthony alongside KFI radio (640 AM). However, the station was originally licensed as experimental W6XEA about 1940, and in 1944 applied for the call letters KSEE (which are now used by the NBC affiliate in Fresno, California). It is unknown whether any transmissions occurred under either call sign.

The station initially broadcast a limited schedule with six hours weekly, and formally began operations on October 6, 1948, with hours that day. Though KFI had long been affiliated with NBC Radio, KFI-TV did not affiliate with the then-upstart NBC Television Network as NBC was building its own station, KNBH (channel 4, now KNBC), which went on the air in January 1949. KFI general manager William B. Ryan indicated a willingness to affiliate with a network other than NBC or start a mutual regional network. Channel 9 has been an independent station for virtually its entire history, though it carried DuMont programming from 1954 up until that network&#x27;s 1956 demise.

At the 3rd Emmy Awards in January 1951, the station won in the best educational show category for &quot;KFI-TV University&quot;.

=== KHJ-TV (1951–1989) ===
Channel 9&#x27;s engineers threatened to go on strike in 1951, leading Anthony to sell the station to the General Tire and Rubber Company in August of that year. A few months earlier, General Tire had purchased the Don Lee Broadcasting System, a regional West Coast radio network (the original Don Lee television station, KTSL (channel 2), was sold separately to CBS; it evolved into future sister KCBS-TV). Don Lee&#x27;s flagship station was KHJ radio (930 AM), and General Tire changed its new television station&#x27;s call letters to KHJ-TV in September 1951. One former employee referred to the call letters as standing for &quot;kindness, happiness and joy&quot;, although the call sign was likely randomly assigned. The Don Lee name was so well respected in California broadcasting that KHJ-TV called itself &quot;Don Lee Television&quot; for a few years in the early 1950s, even though it had never been affiliated with KHJ radio until the 1951 deal.

In 1955, General Tire purchased RKO Radio Pictures to give the company&#x27;s television station group access to RKO&#x27;s film library. In 1959, General Tire&#x27;s broadcasting and film divisions were merged as RKO General.

By the mid-1960s, channel 9 offered a standard independent schedule of movies, off-network reruns, children&#x27;s shows like &quot;The Pancake Man&quot; hosted by Hal Smith (who showed educational shorts like &quot;The Space Explorers&quot;), first-run syndicated programs, and locally produced programs including local newscasts, sports events and public affairs programs. In the late 1960s, KHJ embarked on a novel, groundbreaking (and inexpensive) experiment, called &quot;Tempo&quot;, which heavily borrowed from the talk radio craze on local radio stations. Daytime programming was divided into three blocks running three hours in length, called &quot;Tempo I&quot;, &quot;Tempo II&quot; and &quot;Tempo III&quot;. The second of the three programs, &quot;Tempo II&quot; was perhaps the most active, controversial and innovative. For the first couple of years the hosts were Stan Bohrman and Maria Cole (the wife of Nat King Cole). Guests ranged from William F. Buckley to Sammy Davis Jr. and the political movers and shakers in Southern California. At one point, Stan even quit the program after what he called censorship on the topic of Eldridge Cleaver. Bohrman came back to the program and was joined by a new co-host, Regis Philbin. They became a very popular fixture in Los Angeles television. In fact, in his book about those days, Philbin credits the chemistry with Bohrman and the format of the program as forerunners of much of what would become the cable news format 20 years later.

In the early 1970s, KHJ-TV sought a similar programming strategy to that of crosstown competitor KTLA (channel 5), which focused more on talk shows, game shows, sports, feature films and off-network drama series. The cartoons were phased out (some of them moving to KTTV and KCOP-TV), and the station ran fewer off-network sitcoms. It did continue to have a weekday children&#x27;s show called &quot;Froozles&quot;, which ran until the late 1980s. It also produced many half-hour public affairs programs, as well as a local talk show called &quot;Mid-Morning L.A.&quot; The first hosts were Kathy McKee and Sandy Baron on the &quot;Mid Day&quot; and &quot;Good Morning L.A.&quot; talk shows. Both were hired by KHJ&#x27;s then-station manager Lional Schaen. Bob Hilton, Meredith MacRae, Geoff Edwards and Regis Philbin also hosted programs on the station well into the 1980s. Edwards and MacRae won Emmy Awards for their hosting duties during the early 1980s. Some other locally produced public affairs programs included the investigative show &quot;Camera 9&quot; and &quot;The Changing Family&quot;, a program about family and social issues during the 1980s. Despite this, KHJ-TV was perceived as an also ran while KTLA was the leading independent station, even though it had a similar format.

Meanwhile, a behind-the-scenes battle was underway with serious implications for the station&#x27;s future—and that of its owner. In 1965, RKO General faced a threat to its license for KHJ-TV from a group called Fidelity Television. At first, Fidelity&#x27;s claim focused on channel 9&#x27;s programming quality. Later, Fidelity levied a more serious claim that KHJ-TV was involved in reciprocal trade practices. Fidelity alleged that RKO&#x27;s parent company, General Tire, forced its retailers to purchase advertising on KHJ-TV and other RKO-owned stations as a condition of their contracts with General Tire. An administrative law judge found in favor of Fidelity, but RKO appealed. In 1972, the FCC allowed RKO to keep the license for KHJ-TV, but two years later conditioned future renewals on the renewal of sister station WNAC-TV in Boston.

Six years later, the FCC stripped WNAC-TV of its license for numerous reasons, but largely because RKO had misled the commission about corporate misconduct at General Tire. The decision was affirmed after the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal in April 1982. The FCC awarded a replacement license for channel 7 in Boston to New England Television, a merger of two competing groups for a new channel 7. RKO General sold off WNAC-TV&#x27;s non-license assets to New England Television, who used them to launch WNEV-TV (now WHDH) in place of WNAC-TV that May 21. The WNAC-TV decision also meant KHJ-TV and sister station WOR-TV in New York City had lost their licenses, but an appeals court ruled that the FCC erred when it tied channel 9&#x27;s renewal to that of WNAC-TV and ordered new hearings for KHJ-TV and WOR-TV.

The hearings dragged on for five years; as a result of this, the station was forced to air an unusually large amount of public-affairs programming; a combination of this and the station&#x27;s cash reserves being drained by RKO&#x27;s legal battles led to decreased ratings (and the station&#x27;s perception as an &quot;also-ran&quot;). For a time, KHJ-TV&#x27;s large slate of sports programming was virtually the only thing keeping the station afloat.

On August 11, 1987, FCC administrative law judge Edward Kuhlmann found RKO General unfit to be a broadcast licensee due to numerous cases of dishonesty on both its part and that of parent company GenCorp (the renamed General Tire), including fraudulent billing and lying about its ratings. Kuhlman ordered that all of RKO General&#x27;s broadcast licenses be revoked. This ruling notably excluded WOR-TV, which had already been divested to MCA Inc. nine months prior, and was renamed WWOR-TV. GenCorp initially filed an appeal, only to withdraw it after the FCC warned that any appeal would almost certainly be denied outright. The FCC strongly advised GenCorp to divest its remaining properties to avoid the indignity of additional license stripping without any compensation.

====Disney ownership (1988–1996)====
In the midst of RKO&#x27;s corporate issues, the company reached terms to sell KHJ-TV to Westinghouse Broadcasting in November 1985. However, the protracted legal issues delayed FCC action on the transfer and Westinghouse ultimately withdrew its offer. A short time later, RKO General agreed to sell the station to The Walt Disney Company; however, this transfer was also held up for over a year for the same reasons. Fidelity Television, the group that originally challenged the license in 1965, also argued against the sale. In July 1988, the FCC allowed Disney to acquire channel 9 for $324 million in a complicated settlement. RKO dropped its bid to renew the station&#x27;s license, handing it to Fidelity Television. Disney then bought the channel 9 license from Fidelity for $105.4 million and KHJ-TV&#x27;s non-license assets (intellectual property, studios, etc.) from RKO for $218.6 million. According to FCC general counsel Diane Killory, the settlement had the same effect as finding RKO unfit to be a broadcast licensee, and RKO thus had no choice but to &quot;get out of the business of broadcasting&quot; (though it would take another three years for RKO to unwind its broadcasting interests).

Disney began operating KHJ-TV on December 2, 1988. Over the next few months Disney fired channel 9&#x27;s entire management team it inherited from RKO, including general manager Charles Velona and news director Stephanie Rank Brady. Several of the station&#x27;s newscasters were pushed out as well. During the RKO/Fidelity/Disney transition, KHJ-TV&#x27;s city of license was changed to the Los Angeles suburb of Norwalk, also as part of the FCC settlement. For all intents and purposes, though, it remained a Los Angeles station; the license was moved back to Los Angeles proper on October 28, 1991.

On December 2, 1989—the first anniversary of its ownership, Disney changed channel 9&#x27;s callsign to the present KCAL-TV, and relaunched the station as &quot;California 9&quot;, selected from a shortlist of three possible monikers. Channel 9&#x27;s longtime radio sisters had changed their calls to KRTH some years before, so Disney was theoretically free to continue trading on the KHJ call letters&#x27; 66-year legacy in Southern California. However, newly hired station manager Blake Byrne said that market research revealed the station was seen as a &quot;non-entity&quot; in the market, leading Disney to conclude that it needed a fresh start. Disney did, however, keep a fresco mural of RKO stars in the station lobby. The station also continued to overhaul its format in the wake of its ownership change, adding a three-hour prime time newscast on March 5, 1990, featuring veteran newscasters Jerry Dunphy, Pat Harvey, Larry Carroll and Jane Velez-Mitchell. KCAL also added many more children&#x27;s programs, including cartoons from the Walt Disney animation library (including the syndicated series &quot;DuckTales&quot; and &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot;, and later &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;). The station also added a few more family-oriented off-network sitcoms and syndicated programs and then broadcast the popular anime series &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, that lasted well into 1997. In the early 1990s, family sitcoms were gradually phased out and KCAL added more first-run syndicated talk, reality and court shows, as well as newsmagazine series.

On March 30, 1992, Disney agreed to sell KCAL-TV&#x27;s license to Pinelands, Inc., then the parent company of channel 9&#x27;s former New York City sister station, now called WWOR-TV. Disney would have received a 45% ownership stake in Pinelands, allowing for increased original programming to be shared between the two reunited stations. The planned merger never materialized; Pineland would agree to sell WWOR-TV to Chris-Craft Industries, then-parent of KCOP (channel 13). In 1995, the station adopted the &quot;K-CAL 9&quot; branding.

====Young Broadcasting ownership (1996–2002)====
In 1996, The Walt Disney Company purchased Capital Cities/ABC, owners of ABC West Coast flagship KABC-TV (channel 7). Due to FCC regulations at the time that barred the ownership of two television stations in the same media market, Disney chose to retain KABC-TV and divest KCAL, which was purchased by Young Broadcasting (which Disney owned a stake in at the time) on May 14, 1996, for $385 million. The afternoon children&#x27;s program block would remain until 1999, when KCOP began airing a block of animated series that UPN contracted Disney to produce. By 2000, children&#x27;s programs that aired during the morning hours were dropped as well under the ownership of Young Broadcasting.

==== CBS ownership (2002–present) ====
As a result of massive debt the company accrued from its 2000 purchase of its San Francisco station, KRON-TV (which lost its NBC affiliation in January 2002 due to a dispute between Young and the network), Young Broadcasting put KCAL up for sale in 2002. With duopolies now allowed by the FCC, the station was purchased by CBS, then a subsidiary of Viacom, on February 14, 2002; the deal was finalized on June 1, 2002. KCAL&#x27;s operations were merged with those of KCBS-TV, and channel 9 moved from its longtime headquarters at the Viacom-owned Paramount Studios on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood to CBS Columbia Square, located north of the studio lot; the Melrose Avenue facility was subsequently occupied by then-sister station KRTH (which had previously been based out of the Columbia Square facility), and is currently used by the Paramount studio tour. The sale reunited the station with fellow former RKO General property KRTH-FM, which CBS acquired in 1997. The properties were split again when CBS spun off its radio division to Entercom (now Audacy, Inc.) in 2017.

When CBS/Viacom bought KCAL-TV, broadcasting industry observers speculated that UPN&#x27;s programming would move to KCAL from KCOP-TV. KCOP&#x27;s previous owners, Chris-Craft Industries, had co-founded UPN with Viacom in 1995, and owned 50% of the network before selling its stake in UPN to Viacom in 2000. Fox Television Stations purchased KCOP and most of Chris-Craft&#x27;s UPN stations in 2001. However, CBS continued to operate channel 9 as an independent station, as Fox renewed its affiliation agreement for its UPN affiliates; it is widely believed that Fox used KCOP as leverage to keep UPN on Fox-owned stations in New York City (WWOR-TV, KCAL&#x27;s former sister station) and Chicago (WPWR-TV), threatening to drop the network in those markets should Viacom move the UPN affiliation in Los Angeles to KCAL. This issue became moot with the January 2006 announcement of the merger of UPN and The WB into The CW Television Network. The new network launched on September 18, 2006, with former WB affiliate KTLA as its Los Angeles outlet, due to an affiliation agreement with owner Tribune Broadcasting that resulted in 16 of Tribune&#x27;s WB affiliates joining the network. KCAL-TV remains an independent station, and is currently one of thirteen such stations owned by CBS as a result of the CBS-owned CW stations reverting to independent status in 2023.

On April 21, 2007, KCBS-TV and KCAL-TV moved from Columbia Square to an all-digital facility at the CBS Studio Center in Studio City. The move allowed both stations to begin broadcasting all locally produced programs in high definition, and in addition, the two stations operate in a completely tapeless newsroom. This newsroom is named in honor newscaster Jerry Dunphy, who worked at both stations during his career. With the move to Studio City and KCET&#x27;s later move to Burbank, KTLA is currently the only remaining station in Los Angeles (either in radio or television) whose studios are operated out of Hollywood.
KCAL-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 9, at 1:10 p.m. on June 12, 2009, and converted its broadcasts exclusively to digital television as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 43 to VHF channel 9. Sister station KCBS-TV took over the channel 43 allocation as it moved its digital signal from channel 60 as a result of the phaseout of channels 52–69.

On December 4, 2019, CBS Corporation and Viacom remerged into ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global).

On January 5, 2023, as part of a general rebranding of its news department coinciding with the launch of new morning news blocks, KCAL changed its branding to &quot;KCAL News&quot;, which was adopted across KCBS-TV&#x27;s newscasts on the same day.

==Programming==
Although KCAL-TV is an independent station, it will occasionally air CBS programming due to extended breaking news coverage or special events that may result in programs being unable to air on KCBS-TV.

For E/I programming, KCAL has the &quot;Go Time&quot; syndicated block.

KCAL was the Southern California home of the annual &quot;MDA Labor Day Telethon&quot; between 1997 and 2011.

In June 1979, KHJ-TV aired &quot;Thames on 9&quot;, a week-long prime time programming stunt that featured programs from Thames Television, then a member of the British ITV network. Shows that aired during that week included &quot;Man About the House&quot; (on which the American sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; was based) and &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;; a similar stunt had aired on KHJ-TV&#x27;s former New York City sister station WOR-TV two years earlier.

From 1981 to 1985, KHJ-TV was home to &quot;Elvira&#x27;s Movie Macabre&quot;. KHJ-TV was home to the live broadcast of the Strawberry Festival Parade in Garden Grove, California, from 1986 until 1989.

===Sports programming===
For much of its history overall, sports have been a part of channel 9&#x27;s identity. Indeed, during the station&#x27;s two-decade licensing dispute, its large slate of sports programming was essentially the only thing that kept it as part of the Southern California television landscape.

As of 2023, KCAL has the rights to six games a season from the NHL&#x27;s Los Angeles Kings, produced by Bally Sports West. KCAL was also home to the Kings in the early 1980s and during the mid-to-late 1990s. Since 2024, KCAL has the rights to select matches featuring Orange County SC of the USL Championship.

KCAL-TV previously held the broadcast television rights to the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, carrying a slate of games from 2006 to 2013, televising at least 50 games each year, with all telecasts being broadcast in high definition. In 2014, KCAL lost rights to the Dodger telecasts to the cable-exclusive regional sports network SportsNet LA, which is co-owned by the team and Charter Communications.

Channel 9 is best known as the longtime broadcast home of the NBA&#x27;s Los Angeles Lakers. The station carried Lakers games from 1961 to 1964 (as KHJ-TV), and again from 1977 to 2012. The latter 35 years were the NBA&#x27;s longest consecutive station-team broadcast partnership, and coincided with the Lakers&#x27; golden eras of the 1980s and early 2000s. For most of channel 9&#x27;s second stint with the Lakers, it aired road games only. In 2012, KCAL lost rights to the Lakers telecasts to the cable-exclusive regional sports network Spectrum SportsNet and Spectrum Deportes which was renamed in 2016 after the merger of Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications.

From 1961 to 1963, KHJ-TV was the first television home of the Los Angeles Angels; the baseball team&#x27;s telecasts moved to KTLA in 1964, when then-Angels owner Gene Autry&#x27;s Golden West Broadcasters purchased that station. The television rights to Angels games returned to KCAL-TV in 1996 (The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s ownership interest in the Angels briefly overlapped its stewardship of the station), and added more basketball coverage that same year with the Los Angeles Clippers, in addition to its Lakers telecasts. The station and the Clippers parted ways in 2001 as they eventually moved their over-the-air telecasts to KTLA, while the Angels left KCAL after the 2005 season, moving to KCOP the following year. In addition, KCAL had broadcast select weekend Mighty Ducks of Anaheim games from the NHL team&#x27;s inaugural season in 1993 (both the team and KCAL were Disney properties until 1996) until 2006, when the Ducks moved their over-the-air broadcasts to Anaheim-based independent station KDOC-TV. Also, at the end of the 2013 season, the Dodgers would part ways with KCAL-TV (becoming cable-exclusive on SportsNet LA, although a few games per season have been seen on KTLA since 2016), thus ending the station&#x27;s 36-year run of local sports coverage.

KCAL also carried select Los Angeles Galaxy Major League Soccer games until 2005, when the games became cable-exclusive to Fox Sports West. In 1997, KCAL premiered the first fifteen-minute weekday sports report &quot;Final Quarter&quot;, the show was an expansion of the typical five-minute sports report seen towards the end of a newscast. Several years later, the show was renamed &quot;KCAL 9 Sports News&quot; and with the purchase by CBS and the formation of the duopoly between KCAL and KCBS-TV, was renamed &quot;Sports Central&quot;; the show has since expanded to a half-hour broadcast on Friday through Sunday evenings.

Channel 9 has aired preseason coverage of the NFL&#x27;s Chargers (then based in San Diego) from 2005 to 2016, and aired games from the Chargers&#x27; AFC West Division rival, the Raiders (then based in Oakland) in 2006 (whose preseason games also aired on the station during the mid-1990s). Although Los Angeles returned to the NFL in the 2016 season via the Rams&#x27; return after two decades in St. Louis, sister station KCBS is the Rams&#x27; preseason partner. After 2016, the Chargers relocated back to Los Angeles after 56 years in San Diego and KABC-TV picked up the Chargers preseason coverage starting in the 2017 season. KCAL broadcast two &quot;NFL on CBS&quot; games during the 2017 regular season as part of an arrangement with the NFL that saw CBS get both a Rams and Chargers game on weeks when Fox had the doubleheader.

Since its founding in 1994 until 2008, KCAL was the originating station of the annual John R. Wooden Classic college basketball game.

===Newscasts===
KCAL-TV presently broadcasts a total of hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday and hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the second-highest local newscast output of any television station in the Los Angeles market (behind KTLA, which runs 94 hours, 20 minutes of newscasts each week).

Because of the amount of news programming on the station, channel 9 is known for showing the most police chases among the Los Angeles market&#x27;s news-producing stations. Often regular news programming on KCAL is suspended to cover a police chase, and programs that follow the newscast are sometimes preempted to show the chase&#x27;s conclusion. In 2003, KCAL reported a quadrupling of ratings every time a police chase was shown, with up to 1.6 million viewers watching at a given time during such events. Between 2012 and 2020 (when he moved to KTTV), chases were often shown with the voice and in-air helicopter camera work of Stu Mundel; since 2021, former KNX pilot Desmond Shaw took over Mundel&#x27;s role as the duopoly&#x27;s chief helicopter reporter.

In the 1970s, KHJ-TV aired a prime time newscast at 10 pm, which was moved to 9 p.m. during the 1980s; the station subsequently added a half-hour 8 p.m. newscast during the late 1980s, and also carried afternoon newscasts throughout this time. Some of its most notable personalities included anchors George Putnam, Chris Harris, Stan Bohrman, Tom Lawrence, Nathan Roberts, Lonnie Lardner, Linda Edwards and weather personality Andrew Amador.

Shortly after taking over, Disney invested $30 million on upgrading the station&#x27;s news department, tripling the number of staff and investing on electronic news equipment, including expanding the stations&#x27; studio facility at Paramount Studios to house a new newsroom and studio; the station also hired veteran newscasters Jerry Dunphy, Pat Harvey, Larry Carroll and Jane Velez-Mitchell. After retaining, in the interim, the existing 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. newcasts, and a delay on its launch from January 15, in March 5, 1990, Disney implemented the concept of a prime time news block, with the three-hour long &quot;Prime 9 News&quot; airing from 8 to 11 pm. A few years later in the early 1990s, KCAL added a short-lived half-hour newscast at 6:30 p.m. called &quot;First 9 News&quot;, which focused primarily on local news and competed against the national network newscasts aired on KCBS-TV, KNBC and KABC-TV (KCBS also aired a 6:30 p.m. newscast during the mid to late 1990s, while the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; aired at 5:30 pm). Under Disney ownership, more daytime newscasts were added to channel 9 weekdays at 2 and 3 pm, and the 6:30 p.m. newscast was discontinued (a local newscast returned to that timeslot in the market in January 2009, when KTLA launched its own 6:30 p.m. newscast).

KCAL is notable for airing newscasts during unconventional time periods; the station maintains the large amount of local newscasts that it presently does (which is far more than what is typical of most stations involved in a duopoly with a major network station) simply due to the fact that KCAL and KCBS-TV&#x27;s newscasts air in timeslots that do not compete against one another, as a result, the station&#x27;s newscast schedule remained unchanged after KCAL merged its operations with KCBS. Along with newscasts at noon (where it competes against KTLA), 4 p.m. (where it competes against KABC, KTLA and KNBC) and 10 p.m. (where it competes against KTLA and KTTV), and seven nights a week at 8 and 9 p.m.

KCAL&#x27;s newscasts are variable in tone, depending on the timeslot. Its 8 p.m. newscast is generally an update on the day&#x27;s news, which largely features stories focusing on California and the Los Angeles area (and was previously branded as the &quot;California Report&quot; during the &quot;Prime 9 News&quot; era). Its 9 p.m. newscast is generally the most serious in format (and was branded in previous years as the &quot;Prime 9 News World Report&quot;), that newscast prominently features political, business and international news. The noon newscast, on the other hand, features lighter stories, including features on food, health and the entertainment industry. The 4 p.m. newscast was essentially a repurposed KCBS-TV newscast and was presented by former channel 2 anchors Harold Greene and Ann Martin, who did not appear recently elsewhere on KCAL. The 4 p.m. newscast moved to KCAL from KCBS-TV in 2002 to make room for &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;, which by contractual stipulations was not allowed to air opposite &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; (which aired in Los Angeles on KABC-TV at 3 pm, until its syndication run ended in September 2011). Its 10 p.m. newscast is simply more of an update of the 8 p.m. news (and during the &quot;Prime 9 News&quot; era, was simply branded as the &quot;10 O&#x27;Clock Report&quot;), as it competes with KTTV and KTLA (and in the past, KCOP), though in recent years, it has been shortened to 30 minutes, to make way for the local sports news program &quot;Sports Central&quot;.

On April 1, 2008, CBS Television Stations ordered widespread budget cuts and staff layoffs from its stations. As a result of the budget cuts, roughly 10 to 15 staffers were released from KCBS-TV and KCAL-TV, including reporters Jennifer Sabih, Greg Phillips and Jennifer Davis. 4 p.m. co-anchors Greene and Martin, who were then also the 6 p.m. anchors on KCBS-TV, were also said to have been on the layoff list, but both decided to retire from television upon the June 2009 expiration of their contracts. On April 23, 2009, former KTTV anchor Rick Garcia joined KCAL, and was paired with Pat Harvey as co-anchor of the station&#x27;s weeknight 8 and 10 p.m. newscasts (Garcia is now paired with Sharon Tay, as Harvey moved to sister station KCBS-TV to co-anchor that station&#x27;s 5 and 11 p.m. newscasts).

====NewsCentral era====

On September 19, 2009, KCBS and KCAL rebranded the newscasts on both stations to the unified &quot;NewsCentral&quot; branding (unrelated to Sinclair Broadcast Group&#x27;s now-defunct national news division of the same name; CBS coincidentally owns former Sinclair station KOVR in Sacramento). The newscasts were refocused to cover more community news, including stories from outlying communities. Local news headlines from the Los Angeles Newspaper Group and MediaNews Group newspapers were displayed on a ticker, &quot;street team&quot; submissions of video and photos from viewers were featured, reporters ended stories with &quot;NewsCentral&quot; rather than the individual station brands, and microphone flags and news vehicles were branded to show both stations&#x27; logos at once (previously, the KCBS and KCAL logos were displayed on alternating sides). Under the &quot;NewsCentral&quot; format, the two stations claimed that they covered more local news than any other television station in the country (with reporters in Ventura County, the Inland Empire and Orange County), and the only Los Angeles television station with two helicopters (subcontracted to Angel City Air, owned by reporter Larry Welk). Ed Asner was used to introduce the new newscast. CBS denies this move was made in response to other stations pooling newsgathering resources.

On December 10, 2009, CBS Television Stations hired Steve Mauldin to replace Patrick McClenahan as president and general manager of the KCBS-KCAL duopoly. That week, the duopoly ultimately rescinded the &quot;NewsCentral&quot; branding, reverting to the &quot;CBS2&quot; and &quot;KCAL9&quot; news identities. The &quot;NewsCentral&quot; graphics, mic flags and logos remained in use during the interim, though on-air staff no longer used the &quot;NewsCentral&quot; identity.

====Recent history====
On January 14, 2012, KCAL debuted two-hour-long weekend morning newscasts (airing at 7 a.m. on Saturdays and on Sundays, which follow one-hour newscasts on KCBS); the programs are KCAL&#x27;s first morning newscasts—ironically though, channel 9 was the only news-producing station in the market that did not have a news program on weekday mornings.

On December 10, 2014, KCAL announced it would be dropping its hour long 2 p.m. and half-hour 3 p.m. newscasts before the end of the year to be replaced by &quot;Judge Mathis&quot; and &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;. As a result, the 4 p.m. newscast was truncated from an hour to 30 minutes, and &quot;Inside Edition&quot; moved from 3:30 p.m. to the 4:30 p.m. slot previously occupied by the other half of the 4 p.m. newscast.

As of September 11, 2017, KCAL has reinstated the second half-hour of the 4 p.m. newscast and making the news a full hour.

On July 12, 2022, KCAL announced that it would launch a seven-hour morning newscast from 4 to 11 am, replacing that of KCBS and marking the first-ever weekday morning newscast in the station&#x27;s history; the new &quot;KCAL News Mornings&quot; launched on January 5, 2023. At this time, KCBS replaced its existing morning newscast with a broadcast of the live Eastern edition of the network&#x27;s national morning show &quot;CBS Mornings&quot;, followed by a simulcast of the 6 a.m. hour of &quot;KCAL News Mornings&quot;. In addition, to emphasize the station&#x27;s history and reputation for local news programming, all newscasts across the KCBS-KCAL duopoly were rebranded as &quot;KCAL News&quot;, and the station changed its on-air branding from &quot;KCAL 9&quot; to &quot;KCAL Los Angeles&quot;.

<text>Baron Glenavy, of Milltown in the County of Dublin, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 26 July 1921 for the noted Irish lawyer and Unionist politician Sir James Campbell, 1st Baronet. He served as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland from 1916 to 1918 and as Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1918 to 1921. Campbell had already been created a baronet in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1917. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the third Baron. Better known simply as Patrick Campbell, he was a well-known journalist, humorist and television personality. He died without male issue and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Baron. He never married and on his death in 1984 the baronetcy and barony became extinct.

<text>The Little White House was the personal retreat of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States, located in the Historic District of Warm Springs, Georgia. He first came to Warm Springs (formerly known as Bullochville) in 1924 for polio treatment, and liked the area so much that, as Governor of New York, he had a home built on nearby Pine Mountain. The house was finished in 1932. Roosevelt kept the house after he became president, using it as a presidential retreat. He died there on April 12, 1945, three months into his fourth term.

The house was opened to the public as a museum in 1948. A major attraction of the museum is the portrait that the artist Elizabeth Shoumatoff was painting of him when he died, now known as the &quot;Unfinished Portrait&quot;. It hangs near a finished portrait that Shoumatoff completed later from sketches and memory.

The house is operated by the State of Georgia as the Little White House Historic Site, also known as Roosevelt&#x27;s Little White House Historic Site.

==History==

Residents of Georgia, particularly Savannah, began spending vacations at Bullochville in the late 18th century as a way to escape yellow fever, attracted by the number of warm springs in the vicinity. In the late 19th century, traveling to the warm springs was a desirable way to escape from Atlanta. Traveling by railroad to Durand, people would then go to Bullochville. One of the places benefiting from this was the Meriwether Inn. Once the automobile became popular in the early 20th century, tourists began going elsewhere, starting the decline of the inn.

In 1921, Roosevelt, aged 39, was diagnosed with poliomyelitis. The few things that seemed to ease his pain were immersion in warm water, bathing and engaging in physical exercise. His first time in Warm Springs was October 1924. He went to a resort in the town that had a permanent natural spring, but whose main house was described as &quot;ramshackle.&quot; Roosevelt bought the resort and the farm surrounding it in 1927 (the resort became known as the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation). Five years later, in 1932, after winning the presidency for the first time, he ordered a six-room Georgia pine house to be built on the property. This house was his retreat throughout his presidency and became known as the Little White House. In total, he made 16 trips there during his presidency, usually spending two to three weeks at a time, as it took a day to reach Warm Springs from Washington, D.C. by train.

The Little White House is a six-room Colonial Revival structure made of Georgia pine. Three of the rooms were bedrooms: one for Roosevelt, one for his wife Eleanor, and one for his personal secretary. The other rooms were an entrance hall, a living room and a kitchen. Access to the Little White House was from an unpaved road that now only exists in parts. The garage-servant&#x27;s quarters was built in 1932, followed by the single-story frame cottage that served as a guesthouse in 1933, and finally a cottage for Georgia Wilkins in 1934. Wilkins&#x27; family were the original owners of the property.

Roosevelt used the Little White House as a base to replace Georgia politicians who refused to follow his policies. This was most notable in 1938 when Roosevelt tried and failed to have United States Senator Walter George replaced with a Roosevelt loyalist, even though both were Democrats.

World War II affected Roosevelt&#x27;s time at the Little White House. The only year he did not go to the Little White House was 1942, as he was preoccupied by the beginnings of US involvement in the war. It is believed that he vacationed as much as he did in 1943–45 at the Little White House because his real love for vacations, sailing on the Atlantic, was too dangerous during wartime, even if it was just on inland waterways like the Chesapeake Bay or the Potomac River. One major change was that soldiers from Fort Benning were stationed at the Little White House to patrol the woods surrounding the farm.

His last trip to the Little White House was on March 30, 1945. He felt he did not achieve enough rest at his Hyde Park home. According to some observers at Warm Springs, Roosevelt looked &quot;ghastly&quot; and his usual cordial waves to the residents were weak. Unlike his previous visits, he avoided the swimming pool he used to comfort himself in previous trips. On April 12, 1945, he was sitting for a portrait at the Little White House when he suffered a stroke. Roosevelt died two hours later of cerebral hemorrhage.

Most of Roosevelt&#x27;s property was willed to Georgia Warm Springs Foundation, which gained control of all the properties in 1948 except for the Georgia Wilkins Cottage, which Wilkins lived in until her 1959 death. Both John F. Kennedy in 1960 and Jimmy Carter in 1976 used the property for their campaigns to become president; Carter even launched his campaign there.

==Current status==
Today, the Little White House is part of Georgia&#x27;s state park system and is open to visitors. It has been preserved and is as it was the day Roosevelt died. All buildings and furnishings are original to the house and property. Items on display, besides the Unfinished Portrait, include his customized 1938 Ford convertible and his stagecoach.

On August 9, 2011, the McCarthy Cottage and the E.T. Curtis Cottage on the Roosevelt Institute Hospital grounds that date back to Roosevelt&#x27;s time at Warm Springs were destroyed in a fire which investigators believed had been started by lightning and thunderstorms that were in the area at the time.

<doc id="869844" wikidata="Q7591457" url="?curid=869844" title="St. Peter Sandstone">
<text>The St. Peter Sandstone is an Ordovician geological formation. It belongs to the Chazyan stage of the Champlainian series in North American regional stratigraphy, equivalent to the late Darriwilian global stage. This sandstone originated as a sheet of sand in clear, shallow water near the shore of a Paleozoic sea and consists of fine-to-medium-size, well-rounded quartz grains with frosted surfaces. The extent of the formation spans north–south from Minnesota to Arkansas and east–west from Illinois into Nebraska and South Dakota. The formation was named by David Dale Owen (1847) after the Minnesota River, then known as the St. Peter River. The type locality is at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers near Fort Snelling, Minnesota. In eastern Missouri, the stone consists of quartz sand that is 99.44% silica.

==Outcrop==
In Minnesota, the soft St. Peter Sandstone can be observed at the bluffs of the Mississippi River valley beneath a very thin layer of Glenwood Shale and a much thicker layer of Platteville limestone. Examples can be seen in the Mississippi River Gorge and at Minnehaha Falls in Minneapolis, the bluffs from downtown to Mounds Park in Saint Paul, and Minneopa Falls near Mankato. In Illinois, Castle Rock is a large bluff of St. Peter Sandstone, and Starved Rock State Park and Matthiessen State Park feature numerous outcroppings and canyons.

==Commercial use==
St. Peter sandstone, also called &quot;Ottawa Sand&quot; in commercial applications, has a relatively uniform size and shape for each grain. It is used for the manufacture of glass, for filter and molding sand, and for abrasives. Its purity is especially important to glassmakers. It is also important, as &quot;frac sand&quot; in oil and gas drilling – loose sand pumped in a liquid mix under high pressure into a well where the sand grains wedge into and hold open any fractures in the rock, enhancing the extraction of hydrocarbons. The uniform particle size also makes the sand useful for laboratory experiments.

==Mining locations==
St. Peter sandstone is or has been mined

*Arkansas: Guion, Arkansas
*Illinois: Ottawa, Illinois, Sheridan, Illinois, Wedron, Illinois, Oregon, Illinois, and Naplate, Illinois
*Minnesota: Kasota, Minnesota and Ottawa Township, Minnesota
*Missouri: Pacific, Festus, Crystal City, Augusta, and Pevely

The Unimin Corporation is a large producer of commercial sand and operates surface mines in many of these locations.

<text>The Solomons corella (Cacatua ducorpsii), also known as Solomons cockatoo, Ducorps&#x27;s cockatoo or broad-crested corella, is a species of cockatoo endemic to the Solomon Islands archipelago. This small white cockatoo is larger than the Tanimbar corella yet smaller than the umbrella cockatoo. The species is common across most of the Solomons, absent only from Makira in the south. It inhabits lowland rainforests, secondary forests, cleared areas and gardens.

==Description==
The Solomons corella is about long. They are predominantly white. They have a blue eye ring and a recumbent crest which resembles a sail in its raised state. As other members of the subgenus &quot;Licmetis&quot;, it has a pale bill.

== Distribution &amp; population ==
The Solomons corella is abundant on all islands in the archipelago except Makira and surrounding islands. Ornithologists estimate that the bird has a population of around 100,000 individual birds. It has been listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
==Breeding==
The Solomons corella nests in tree cavities. The eggs are white and there are usually two in a clutch. The eggs are incubated for about 25 days and the chicks leave the nest about 62 days after hatching. Wild birds typically breed from July–September.

<doc id="869862" wikidata="Q230308" url="?curid=869862" title="Emily Mortimer">
<text>Emily Kathleen Anne Mortimer (born 6 October 1971) is a British actress and filmmaker. She began acting in stage productions and has since appeared in several film and television roles. In 2003, she won an Independent Spirit Award for her performance in &quot;Lovely and Amazing&quot;. She is also known for playing Mackenzie McHale in the HBO series &quot;The Newsroom&quot; (2012–2014). She co-created and co-wrote the series &quot;Doll &amp; Em&quot; (2014–2015) and wrote and directed the miniseries &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; (2021), the latter of which earned her a nomination for the British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actress.

She provided the voice of Sophie in the English-language version of &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; (2004), and starred in &quot;Scream 3&quot; (2000), &quot;Match Point&quot; (2005), &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (2006), &quot;The Pink Panther 2&quot; (2009), &quot;Lars and the Real Girl&quot; (2007), &quot;Chaos Theory&quot; (2008), &quot;Harry Brown&quot; (2009), &quot;Shutter Island&quot; (2010), &quot;Cars 2&quot; (2011), &quot;Hugo&quot; (2011), &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot; (2018), and &quot;Relic&quot; (2020).

==Early life and education==
Mortimer was born on 6 October 1971 in Hammersmith, London, to dramatist and barrister Sir John Mortimer, and his second wife, Penelope (née Gollop). She has a younger sister, Rosie; two older half-siblings, Sally Silverman and Jeremy, from her father&#x27;s first marriage to author Penelope Fletcher; and a half-brother, Ross Bentley, from her father&#x27;s relationship with actress Wendy Craig.

Mortimer studied at St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School in west London where she appeared in several pupil productions. She went on to the University of Oxford, where she read Russian at Lincoln College and performed in several plays. Before becoming an actress, she wrote a column for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and was screenwriter for an adaptation of Lorna Sage&#x27;s memoir &quot;Bad Blood&quot;.

==Career==

=== 1995–2008: Early work and recognition ===
Mortimer performed in several plays while studying at the University of Oxford. While acting in a student production, she was spotted by a producer who later cast her as the lead in a television adaptation of Catherine Cookson&#x27;s &quot;The Glass Virgin&quot; (1995). Subsequent television roles included &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Sword (1995)&quot; and &quot;Coming Home (1998)&quot;. She followed this with the 1996 television film &quot;Lord of Misrule&quot;, directed by Guy Jenkin and filmed in Fowey, Cornwall.

In 1996, Mortimer appeared in her first feature film opposite Val Kilmer in &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot;, and in the coming-of-age story, &quot;The Last of the High Kings.&quot; 1997 saw Mortimer play the central character of Katherine Lacey in the pilot episode of Midsomer Murders. In 1998 she appeared as Kat Ashley in &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, and played Miss Flynn in the television mini series &quot;Cider with Rosie&quot;, which was adapted for television by her father. In 1999, she played three roles: she was the &quot;Perfect Girl&quot; dropped by Hugh Grant in &quot;Notting Hill&quot;; Esther in the television miniseries &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark,&quot; and the actress Angelina in &quot;Scream 3&quot;.

In 2000, Mortimer was cast as Katherine in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s musical adaptation of &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, where she met actor and future husband Alessandro Nivola. She took on her biggest role in an American film to date, playing opposite Bruce Willis in &quot;Disney&#x27;s The Kid&quot;. A year later, she played aspiring actress Elizabeth in &quot;Lovely &amp; Amazing&quot;, a comedy about the relationship between a mother and her three daughters. Mortimer said of the role, &quot;It was a wonderful experience as an actor to have that opportunity [...] You hear this terrifying phrase, &#x27;being in the moment.&#x27; I have no doubt that I was in that moment. [Elizabeth] was exposed and ridiculous and brave.&quot; Mortimer won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role. In 2002, she had a major part as the assassin in &quot;The 51st State&quot; (also known as &quot;Formula 51&quot;), starring opposite Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Carlyle. Upon release, the film was a critical and commercial failure.In 2003, Mortimer appeared in Stephen Fry&#x27;s British drama, &quot;Bright Young Things,&quot; based on the 1930 novel &quot;Vile Bodies&quot; by Evelyn Waugh. It is about young and carefree London aristocrats and bohemians, set in the interwar period. Playing fiancée Nina Blount, Mortimer was described as &quot;a character who gives Peter O&#x27;Toole a marvelous few minutes of playing dottiness to the hilt&quot;, by &quot;Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s Stephen Hunter. Her last release of 2003 was &quot;Young Adam&quot;, in which she plays the girlfriend of a cruel barge worker (Ewan McGregor). Based on the novel of the same title, Mortimer&#x27;s role in &quot;Young Adam&quot; garnered her acclaim; &quot;Evening Standard&quot;&#x27;s critic wrote, &quot;In a performance of naked courage, Emily Mortimer shows that she is prepared to go to extreme lengths of masochism in her depiction of a woman undone by love&quot;. &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine thought the cast performances were &quot;edgy&quot;, and Mortimer made the most out of an underwritten role. She also had a supporting part in the romantic drama &quot;The Sleeping Dictionary&quot; (2003).

In 2004, Mortimer played the lead role in the drama &quot;Dear Frankie&quot;, about a young mother whose love for her son prompts her to plan a deception to protect him from the truth about his father. Her performance gained positive reviews; &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote, &quot;an unforgettable performance from Mortimer [...] a leading lady&quot;. Matthew Leyland of the BBC gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and was impressed with Mortimer&#x27;s performance, which was played with &quot;heartfelt conviction&quot;. In an interview with critic Roger Ebert, Mortimer said, &quot;I seem to find characters who are held back and guarded, physically and mentally. It&#x27;s a relief after the film is over. [...] But when I&#x27;m acting, it&#x27;s good to have something to play against, boundaries to break.&quot;

Mortimer also voiced young Sophie in the English-dubbed version of 2004&#x27;s &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot;. In 2005, she played Chloe Wilton, the oblivious spouse of Jonathan Rhys Meyers&#x27;s adulterer in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Match Point.&quot; The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, and co-starred Scarlett Johansson and Matthew Goode. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Peter Bradshaw opined that Mortimer&#x27;s performance was &quot;perfectly plausible&quot;, and CNN&#x27;s critic complimented the entire cast. During the film&#x27;s theatrical run, it earned $85 million. She appeared in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (2006) as the &quot;adorable&quot; secretary Nicole Durant.

In 2007, she had a role in the comedy drama &quot;Lars and the Real Girl&quot; as Karin, the supportive sister-in-law of Ryan Gosling&#x27;s title character. The film received generally positive reviews; Deborah Ross of &quot;The Spectator&quot; thought Mortimer played her character well despite the film&#x27;s repetitive comedic moments. Next in 2008, Mortimer starred opposite Ryan Reynolds in the comedy &quot;Chaos Theory&quot;. Critical reception was mostly mixed, and Ruthe Stein of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; thought Mortimer and Reynolds lacked chemistry. The psychological thriller &quot;Transsiberian&quot; (2008), directed by Brad Anderson, saw Mortimer cast as Jessie. She co-stars with Woody Harrelson, and they portray a couple who befriend a pair of mysterious travellers. The film premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival to a positive response; &quot;Variety&quot; magazine&#x27;s critic thought Mortimer&#x27;s character was well-developed, and it was &quot;a very flavorful performance as a reformed bad girl&quot;.

A year later, she was cast in David Mamet&#x27;s martial arts drama &quot;Redbelt&quot;, playing attorney Laura Black. The film gained fair reviews, and &quot;The Telegraph&quot; critic wrote, &quot;Emily Mortimer is impressive as a jittery, unlikable attorney&quot;. In 2009, Mortimer reprised her role as Nicole Durant in &quot;The Pink Panther 2&quot;; the film was panned by critics. In the last three episodes of the first season of &quot;30 Rock&quot;, she played Phoebe, the mysterious love interest of Alec Baldwin&#x27;s character, Jack Donaghy.

=== 2009–2019: Career progression in film ===
Mortimer appeared in Daniel Barber&#x27;s first film, &quot;Harry Brown&quot; (2009), as police detective Alice Frampton. The plot follows widowed veteran (Michael Caine), who takes the law into his own hands when teenage violence ruins his community. Mortimer chose the role because &quot;It felt like unfamiliar territory for me which is always a challenge and interesting [...] the script is very gripping and brilliantly written [...] getting to work with Michael, and then just the character being in some ways both the opposite and the same as Michael&#x27;s character.&quot; To prepare for the role, she spent time with a real female detective, and learnt about police interrogation techniques. Upon release, the critic from &quot;USA Today&quot; thought her performance was &quot;caring and savvy&quot;, despite the film&#x27;s &quot;senseless violence&quot;. Betsy Sharkey of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote of Mortimer&#x27;s performance: &quot;Her clinical coolness plays well off of Caine&#x27;s controlled heat.&quot;

Mortimer played an aspiring actress opposite Andy García in &quot;City Island&quot; (2009). Although the film&#x27;s reception was warm, her role in &quot;City Island&quot; was noted by two critics as &quot;vague&quot; and weak. She appeared as Rachel Solando in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 2010 thriller &quot;Shutter Island&quot;. Several critics thought &quot;Shutter Island&quot; was unexciting, and that Mortimer and her fellow actors were not utilised to their full potential. The film found moderate success at the box office, grossing $294 million from a budget of $80 million. She portrayed American educator Leonie Gilmour in the biographical drama &quot;Leonie&quot; (2010). Of her performance, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; opined that it was a &quot;superb portrayal&quot;, which showcased her acting range.

In 2011, she had a role in &quot;Our Idiot Brother&quot; as Liz, the sister of Paul Rudd&#x27;s titular character. In that same year, Mortimer appeared in Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Hugo&quot;, an adaptation of Brian Selznick&#x27;s book, &quot;The Invention of Hugo Cabret.&quot; &quot;Hugo&quot; won five Academy Awards from eleven nominations, but was a box office disappointment. Also in 2011, she started work with screenwriter and producer Aaron Sorkin, playing Mackenzie McHale in HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Newsroom&quot;. Although the first season of the series gained a mixed reception, the later seasons fared better. Several critics praised Mortimer&#x27;s acting abilities in season one, but they took issue with her character&#x27;s writing. In January 2013, it was announced that Mortimer would be co-creating and starring in the comedy series &quot;Doll &amp; Em&quot; for Sky Living, along with her longtime friend, actress and comedian Dolly Wells.

Next, Mortimer starred in the drama &quot;The Sense of an Ending&quot; (2017), based on the novel of the same title by Julian Barnes. Playing the mother Sarah Ford, Mortimer garnered praise for her lively performance, while one critic thought she was miscast. In that same year, she portrayed the pregnant Jinny in &quot;The Party&quot;; the film premiered at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival, and was favourably received. Mortimer co-starred with Patricia Clarkson and Bill Nighy in the drama &quot;The Bookshop.&quot; Adapted from the 1978 novel of the same title by Penelope Fitzgerald, Mortimer played Florence Green, who opens a bookshop despite local opposition. Writing for &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, Andrea Gronvall noted, &quot;The ever-winsome Emily Mortimer glows as a struggling widow&quot;, and &quot;Variety&quot; magazine opined that it was &quot;A fine, sensitive leading turn&quot; for the actor. &quot;The Bookshop&quot; grossed $12 million worldwide.

In the small-scale feature, &quot;Write When You Get Work&quot; (2018), Mortimer played a member of the elite class. A family drama, about a man with Alzheimer&#x27;s, &quot;Head Full of Honey&quot; (2018), was Mortimer&#x27;s next release. She played the wife of Matt Dillon&#x27;s character. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the film a negative review, and thought Mortimer and the cast were &quot;all over the place&quot;. She then joined the cast of &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;, a 2018 musical fantasy directed by Rob Marshall. It is loosely based on the book series Mary Poppins by P. L. Travers. The film was a box office hit, and Christopher Orr of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine praised Mortimer&#x27;s &quot;charming&quot; performance.

Mortimer returned to the screen in 2019 with &quot;Good Posture.&quot; It co-stars Grace Van Patten as Lilian, a young woman who moves in with her father&#x27;s friend, a reclusive novelist called Julia Price (Mortimer). Of her character, she said, &quot;I wish I had just one per cent of Julia&#x27;s frostiness in my own life. I really enjoyed being that person, feeling what it&#x27;s like to be intimidating.&quot; The film was made by Mortimer&#x27;s friend, Dolly Wells, in her directorial debut. The actor&#x27;s performance earned praise, but several critics were disappointed with her amount of screen time. Next, she appeared in Greg Kinnear&#x27;s comedy &quot;Phil&quot;; it was negatively received by critics. In the horror film &quot;Mary&quot;, Mortimer starred opposite Gary Oldman. The film is about a family in isolated waters and the ship they bought which has terrifying secrets. &quot;Mary&quot; was panned by critics, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; thought the actors talents were wasted.

=== 2020–present: Recent work and television ===
In 2020, Mortimer starred in the horror film &quot;Relic&quot; with co-stars Robyn Nevin and Bella Heathcote; the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called Mortimer &quot;excellent&quot; in her portrayal of a workaholic mother. That same year, Mortimer played Sharon in the science fiction series &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Deeper.&quot; In 2021, Mortimer wrote, directed, and starred in the miniseries &quot;The Pursuit of Love,&quot; which earned her a BAFTA TV nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Mortimer is set to replace Sally Hawkins, who had played Mrs. Brown in previous Paddington films, for &quot;Paddington in Peru&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2000, Mortimer met American actor Alessandro Nivola while both were starring in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;. They married in the village of Turville in the Chilterns, Buckinghamshire, on 3 January 2003. Mortimer gave birth to their son Sam Nivola on 26 September 2003, and their daughter May in 2010. Previously based in Notting Hill, they live in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, with their children. Mortimer became an American citizen in 2010.

<doc id="869864" wikidata="Q1207210" url="?curid=869864" title="Dexmethylphenidate">
<text>Dexmethylphenidate, sold under the brand name Focalin among others, is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant indicated in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in those over the age of five years. It is taken by mouth. The immediate release formulation lasts up to five hours while the extended release formulation lasts up to twelve hours. It is the more active enantiomer of methylphenidate. 
Common side effects include abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and fever. Serious side effects may include psychosis, sudden cardiac death, mania, anaphylaxis, seizures, and dangerously prolonged erection. Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unclear. Dexmethylphenidate is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. How it works in ADHD is unclear.
Dexmethylphenidate was approved for medical use in the United States in 2001. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 109th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5million prescriptions.
==Medical uses==
Dexmethylphenidate is used as a treatment for ADHD, usually along with psychological, educational, behavioral or other forms of treatment. It is proposed that stimulants help ameliorate the symptoms of ADHD by making it easier for the user to concentrate, avoid distraction, and control behavior. Placebo-controlled trials have shown that once-daily dexmethylphenidate XR was effective and generally well tolerated.

Improvements in ADHD symptoms in children were significantly greater for dexmethylphenidate XR versus placebo. It also showed greater efficacy than osmotic controlled-release oral delivery system (OROS) methylphenidate over the first half of the laboratory classroom day but assessments late in the day favoured OROS methylphenidate.

==Contraindications==

==Adverse effects==

Products containing dexmethylphenidate have a side effect profile comparable to those containing methylphenidate.
== Interactions ==


==Mode of activity==
Methylphenidate is a catecholamine reuptake inhibitor that indirectly increases catecholaminergic neurotransmission by inhibiting the dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET), which are responsible for clearing catecholamines from the synapse, particularly in the striatum and meso-limbic system. Moreover, it is thought to &quot;increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.&quot;

Although four stereoisomers of methylphenidate (MPH) are possible, only the threo diastereoisomers are used in modern practice. There is a high eudysmic ratio between the SS and RR enantiomers of MPH. Dexmethylphenidate (d-threo-methylphenidate) is a preparation of the RR enantiomer of methylphenidate. In theory, &quot;D&quot;-TMP (d-threo-methylphenidate) can be anticipated to be twice the strength of the racemic product.

== Pharmacology==

Dexmethylphenidate has a 4–6 hour duration of effect. A long-acting formulation, Focalin XR, which spans 12 hours is also available and has been shown to be as effective as -TMP (threo-methylphenidate) XR (extended release) (Concerta, Ritalin LA), with flexible dosing and good tolerability. It has also been demonstrated to reduce ADHD symptoms in both children and adults. d-MPH has a similar side-effect profile to MPH and can be administered without regard to food intake.

CTx-1301 is an experimental medication that is an extended-release formulation of dexmethylphenidate that has a half life more than an hour longer than extended-release dexmethylphenidate (d-MPH-ER). It is under development for ADHD.

<doc id="869868" wikidata="Q1484569" url="?curid=869868" title="White spirit">
<text>White spirit (AU, UK and Ireland) or mineral spirits (US, Canada), also known as mineral turpentine (AU/NZ/ZA), turpentine substitute, and petroleum spirits, is a petroleum-derived clear liquid used as a common organic solvent in painting. There are also terms for specific kinds of white spirit, including Stoddard solvent and solvent naphtha (petroleum). White spirit is often used as a paint thinner, or as a component thereof, though paint thinner is a broader category of solvent. Odorless mineral spirits (OMS) have been refined to remove the more toxic aromatic compounds, and are recommended for applications such as oil painting.

A mixture of aliphatic, open-chain or alicyclic C7 to C12 hydrocarbons, white spirit is insoluble in water and is used as an extraction solvent, as a cleaning solvent, as a degreasing solvent and as a solvent in aerosols, paints, wood preservatives, lacquers, varnishes, and asphalt products. In western Europe about 60% of the total white spirit consumption is used in paints, lacquers and varnishes. White spirit is the most widely used solvent in the paint industry. In households, white spirit is commonly used to clean paint brushes after use, to clean auto parts and tools, as a starting fluid for charcoal grills, to remove adhesive residue from non-porous surfaces, and many other common tasks.

The word &quot;mineral&quot; in &quot;mineral spirits&quot; or &quot;mineral turpentine&quot; is meant to distinguish it from distilled spirits (alcoholic beverages distilled from fermented biological material) or from true turpentine (distilled tree resin, composed mostly of pinene).

==Types and grades==
Three different types and three different grades of white spirit exist. The &quot;type&quot; refers to whether the solvent has been subjected to hydrodesulfurization (removal of sulfur) alone (type 1), solvent extraction (type 2) or hydrogenation (type 3).

Each type comprises three grades: low flash grade, regular grade, and high flash grade (&quot;flash&quot; refers to flash point). The grade is determined by the crude oil used as the starting material and the conditions of distillation.

In addition there is type 0, which is defined as distillation fraction with no further treatment, consisting predominantly of saturated C9 to C12 hydrocarbons with a boiling range of .

Stoddard solvent is a specific mixture of hydrocarbons, typically over 65% C10 or higher hydrocarbons, developed in 1924 by Atlanta dry cleaner W. J. Stoddard and Lloyd E. Jackson of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research as a less flammable petroleum-based dry cleaning solvent than the petroleum solvents then in use. Dry cleaners began using the result of their work in 1928 and it soon became the predominant dry cleaning solvent in the United States, until the late 1950s.

Turpentine substitute is generally not made to a standard and can have a wider range of components than products marketed as white spirit, which is made to a standard (in the UK, British Standard BS 245, in Germany, DIN 51632). Turpentine substitute can be used for general cleaning but is not recommended for paint thinning as it may adversely affect drying times due to the less volatile components; while it may be used for brush cleaning its heavier components may leave an oily residue.

==Chemical registry numbers==
== Physical properties ==
Type 1 white spirit is mainly used in most of Europe and Stoddard solvent is used in the US, both of which correspond to each other.
==Use==

=== Degreasing and lubricating ===
In industry, white spirit is used for cleaning and degreasing machine tools and parts, and in conjunction with cutting oil as a thread cutting and reaming lubricant.

White spirit is commonly used for cutting fluid in ultraprecision lathes (commonly referred to as diamond turning machines).

White spirit is used for regripping golf clubs. After the old grip is removed, the white spirit is poured into the new grip and shaken. After the white spirit is poured on, the new underlying tape and the new grip are slid on. After an hour of drying out, the new grip and club are ready to use.

=== Solvent and paint thinner ===
White Spirit is a petroleum distillate used as a paint thinner and mild solvent.

White spirit is an inexpensive petroleum-based replacement for the vegetable-based turpentine. It is commonly used as a paint thinner for oil-based paint and cleaning brushes, and as an organic solvent in other applications. Mineral turpentine is chemically very different from turpentine, which mainly consists of pinene, and it has inferior solvent properties. Artists use white spirit as an alternative to turpentine since it is less flammable and less toxic. Because of interactions with pigments in oil paints, artists require a higher grade of white spirit than many industrial users, including the complete absence of residual sulfur.

White spirit was formerly an active ingredient in the laundry soap Fels Naptha, used to dissolve oils and grease in laundry stains, and as a popular remedy for eliminating the irritant oil urushiol in poison ivy. It was removed as a potential health risk.

White spirit has a characteristic unpleasant kerosene-like odor. Chemical manufacturers have developed a low odor version of mineral turpentine which contains less of the highly volatile shorter hydrocarbons. Odorless mineral spirits is white spirit that has been further refined to remove the more toxic aromatic compounds, and is recommended for applications such as oil painting, where humans have close contact with the solvent.

In screen printing (also referred to as silk-screening), white spirit is often used to clean and unclog screens after printing with oil-based textile and plastisol inks. It is also used to thin inks used in making monoprints.

White spirit is often used inside liquid-filled compasses and gauges.

White spirits are a major ingredient in some popular automotive fuel/oil additives, such as Marvel Mystery Oil, as they are capable of dissolving varnish and sludge buildup.

=== Portable lanterns and stoves ===
Although white spirit is sometimes used as an alternative to camp fuel, such as kerosene or paraffin, in portable lanterns and camp stoves , this is highly inadvisable as typical grades of white spirit have a lower flash point than kerosene. It cannot be used as an alternative to Coleman camp fuel or white gas, which is a much more volatile gasoline-like fuel.

==Toxicity==
White spirit is mainly classed as an irritant. It has a fairly low acute toxicity by inhalation of the vapour, dermal (touching the skin) and oral (ingestion) routes. However, acute exposure can lead to central nervous system depression resulting in lack of coordination and slowed reactions. Exposure to very high concentrations in enclosed spaces can lead to general narcotic effects (drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, etc.) and can eventually lead to unconsciousness. Oral ingestion presents a high aspiration hazard. Prolonged or repeated skin exposure over a long period of time can result in severe irritant dermatitis, also called contact dermatitis.

Continuous exposure to an average white spirit concentration of 240 mg/m3 (40 ppm) for more than 13 years can lead to chronic central nervous system effects. Similar long-term studies have been made in which some of the observed effects included memory impairment, poor concentration, increased irritability etc. White spirit is implicated in the development of chronic toxic encephalopathy (CTE) among house painters. In severe cases CTE may lead to disability and personality changes. These effects in painters were first studied in the 1970s in the Nordic countries.

Owing to the volatility and low bioavailability of its constituents, white spirit, although it is moderately toxic to aquatic organisms, is unlikely to present significant hazards to the environment. It should not however, be purposely poured down the sink or freshwater drain.

People can be exposed to Stoddard solvent in the workplace by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin contact, and eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for Stoddard solvent exposure in the workplace as 500 ppm (2900 mg/m3) over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 350 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and 1800 mg/m3 over 15 minutes. At levels of 20,000 mg/m3, Stoddard solvent is immediately dangerous to life and health.

<doc id="869876" wikidata="Q5535298" url="?curid=869876" title="Geologic modelling">
<text>Geologic modelling, geological modelling or geomodelling is the applied science of creating computerized representations of portions of the Earth&#x27;s crust based on geophysical and geological observations made on and below the Earth surface. A geomodel is the numerical equivalent of a three-dimensional geological map complemented by a description of physical quantities in the domain of interest.
Geomodelling is related to the concept of Shared Earth Model; 
which is a multidisciplinary, interoperable and updatable knowledge base about the subsurface.

Geomodelling is commonly used for managing natural resources, identifying natural hazards, and quantifying geological processes, with main applications to oil and gas fields, groundwater aquifers and ore deposits. For example, in the oil and gas industry, realistic geologic models are required as input to reservoir simulator programs, which predict the behavior of the rocks under various hydrocarbon recovery scenarios. A reservoir can only be developed and produced once; therefore, making a mistake by selecting a site with poor conditions for development is tragic and wasteful. Using geological models and reservoir simulation allows reservoir engineers to identify which recovery options offer the safest and most economic, efficient, and effective development plan for a particular reservoir.

Geologic modelling is a relatively recent subdiscipline of geology which integrates structural geology, sedimentology, stratigraphy, paleoclimatology, and diagenesis;

In 2-dimensions (2D), a geologic formation or unit is represented by a polygon, which can be bounded by faults, unconformities or by its lateral extent, or crop. In geological models a geological unit is bounded by 3-dimensional (3D) triangulated or gridded surfaces. The equivalent to the mapped polygon is the fully enclosed geological unit, using a triangulated mesh. For the purpose of property or fluid modelling these volumes can be separated further into an array of cells, often referred to as voxels (volumetric elements). These 3D grids are the equivalent to 2D grids used to express properties of single surfaces.

Geomodelling generally involves the following steps: 
# Preliminary analysis of geological context of the domain of study.
# Interpretation of available data and observations as point sets or polygonal lines (e.g. &quot;fault sticks&quot; corresponding to faults on a vertical seismic section).
# Construction of a structural model describing the main rock boundaries (horizons, unconformities, intrusions, faults)
# Definition of a three-dimensional mesh honoring the structural model to support volumetric representation of heterogeneity (see Geostatistics) and solving the Partial Differential Equations which govern physical processes in the subsurface (e.g. seismic wave propagation, fluid transport in porous media).

== Geologic modelling components ==

=== Structural framework ===
Incorporating the spatial positions of the major formation boundaries, including the effects of faulting, folding, and erosion (unconformities). The major stratigraphic divisions are further subdivided into layers of cells with differing geometries with relation to the bounding surfaces (parallel to top, parallel to base, proportional). Maximum cell dimensions are dictated by the minimum sizes of the features to be resolved (everyday example: On a digital map of a city, the location of a city park might be adequately resolved by one big green pixel, but to define the locations of the basketball court, the baseball field, and the pool, much smaller pixels – higher resolution – need to be used).

=== Rock type ===
Each cell in the model is assigned a rock type. In a coastal clastic environment, these might be beach sand, high water energy marine upper shoreface sand, intermediate water energy marine lower shoreface sand, and deeper low energy marine silt and shale. The distribution of these rock types within the model is controlled by several methods, including map boundary polygons, rock type probability maps, or statistically emplaced based on sufficiently closely spaced well data.

=== Reservoir quality ===
Reservoir quality parameters almost always include porosity and permeability, but may include measures of clay content, cementation factors, and other factors that affect the storage and deliverability of fluids contained in the pores of those rocks. Geostatistical techniques are most often used to populate the cells with porosity and permeability values that are appropriate for the rock type of each cell.

=== Fluid saturation ===

Most rock is completely saturated with groundwater. Sometimes, under the right conditions, some of the pore space in the rock is occupied by other liquids or gases. In the energy industry, oil and natural gas are the fluids most commonly being modelled. The preferred methods for calculating hydrocarbon saturations in a geologic model incorporate an estimate of pore throat size, the densities of the fluids, and the height of the cell above the water contact, since these factors exert the strongest influence on capillary action, which ultimately controls fluid saturations.

=== Geostatistics ===
An important part of geologic modelling is related to geostatistics. In order to represent the observed data, often
not on regular grids, we have to use certain interpolation techniques. The most widely used technique is kriging
which uses the spatial correlation among data and intends to construct the interpolation via semi-variograms. To reproduce more realistic spatial variability and help assess spatial uncertainty between data, geostatistical simulation based on variograms, training images, or parametric geological objects is often used, e.g.

=== Mineral Deposits ===
Geologists involved in mining and mineral exploration use geologic modelling to determine the geometry and placement of mineral deposits in the subsurface of the earth. Geologic models help define the volume and concentration of minerals, to which economic constraints are applied to determine the economic value of the mineralization. Mineral deposits that are deemed to be economic may be developed into a mine.

== Technology ==

Geomodelling and CAD share a lot of common technologies. Software is usually implemented using object-oriented programming technologies in C++, Java or C# on one or multiple computer platforms. The graphical user interface generally consists of one or several 3D and 2D graphics windows to visualize spatial data, interpretations and modelling output. Such visualization is generally achieved by exploiting graphics hardware. User interaction is mostly performed through mouse and keyboard, although 3D pointing devices and immersive environments may be used in some specific cases. GIS (Geographic Information System) is also a widely used tool to manipulate geological data.

Geometric objects are represented with parametric curves and surfaces or discrete models such as polygonal meshes.
== Research in Geomodelling ==

Problems pertaining to Geomodelling cover:
* Defining an appropriate Ontology to describe geological objects at various scales of interest,
* Integrating diverse types of observations into 3D geomodels: geological mapping data, borehole data and interpretations, seismic images and interpretations, potential field data, well test data, etc.,
* Better accounting for geological processes during model building,
* Characterizing uncertainty about the geomodels to help assess risk. Therefore, Geomodelling has a close connection to Geostatistics and Inverse problem theory,
* Applying of the recent developed Multiple Point Geostatistical Simulations (MPS) for integrating different data sources,
* Automated geometry optimization and topology conservation

== History ==

In the 70&#x27;s, geomodelling mainly consisted of automatic 2D cartographic techniques such as contouring, implemented as FORTRAN routines communicating directly with plotting hardware. The advent of workstations with 3D graphics capabilities during the 80&#x27;s gave birth to a new generation of geomodelling software with graphical user interface which became mature during the 90&#x27;s.

Since its inception, geomodelling has been mainly motivated and supported by oil and gas industry.

==Geologic modelling software==
Software developers have built several packages for geologic modelling purposes. Such software can display, edit, digitise and automatically calculate the parameters required by engineers, geologists and surveyors. Current software is mainly developed and commercialized by oil and gas or mining industry software vendors:

<text>Shenzhou 4 () – launched on December 29, 2002 – was the fourth uncrewed launch of the Chinese Shenzhou spacecraft. Two dummy astronauts were used to test the life support systems (a live astronaut was not used until Shenzhou 5 on October 15, 2003).

The spacecraft was equipped for a crewed flight, even featuring a sleeping bag, food, and medication. The windows were constructed of a new material that was designed to stay clear even after reentry to allow an astronaut to confirm that the parachutes have deployed properly. It was said that the spacecraft flown on Shenzhou 4 had no major differences to that used on Shenzhou 5. It flew with the ability for manual control and emergency landing, systems needed for a crewed flight. A week before the launch, astronauts trained in the spacecraft to familiarise themselves with its systems.

Initially the spacecraft was in a by orbit inclined at 42.4°. This was raised to by at 23:35 UTC on December 29, 2002. On January 4 and January 5, 2003 several smaller manoeuvres were thought to have taken place. The rate of orbital decay seemed higher after January 1, suggesting that the orbital module&#x27;s solar panels may have been deployed for the first time. Compared to Shenzhou 3 the orbital period of Shenzhou 4 was much more tightly bounded with smaller manoeuvres.

The launch of Shenzhou 4 was watched by officials including Chairman of the National People&#x27;s Congress Li Peng; Vice Premier and member of the Politburo Standing Committee Wu Bangguo; Jia Qinglin, also a member of the Standing Committee; Cao Gangchuan, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission; Song Jian, vice-chairman of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference; and Li Jinai, head of the General Armament Department of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. According to the weather forecast, the launch site was -29°C.

The spacecraft carried 100 peony seeds to investigate the effect of weightlessness on plants grown from them. The 52 experiments onboard investigated areas in physics, biology, medicine, earth observation, material science, and astronomy.

Four tracking ships were used for the mission — one off the coast of South Africa in the South Atlantic Ocean, one in the Indian Ocean near Western Australia, one in the North Pacific Ocean south of Japan, and one in the South Pacific Ocean west of New Zealand.

The reentry module landed safely about from Hohhot, Inner Mongolia. As with previous flights, the command for reentry to begin was given by a tracking ship off the coast of South Africa. It was thought before the flight that the Chinese would attempt a water landing to test the emergency system but this did not happen. The orbital module remained in orbit until September 9, 2003.

<text>George Liberace (July 31, 1911 – October 16, 1983) was an American musician and television performer.

== Biography ==
Born in Menasha, Wisconsin on July 31, 1911, George Liberace was the elder brother and business partner of famed entertainer Liberace. He appeared regularly on his brother&#x27;s syndicated television show in the 1950s as a violin accompanist and orchestral arranger. On occasions when he did not appear, Liberace would often say his catchphrase &quot;I wish my brother George was here&quot;.

In the 1960s and 1970s, his name was licensed to George Liberace Songsmiths, Inc., a mail-order music publishing operation of somewhat dubious integrity. On October 5, 1974, a new independent UHF television station, KMUV-TV Channel 31, signed on in Sacramento, California with George Liberace as the station&#x27;s general manager and on-the-air host. The new station played non-stop movies. However, on May 1, 1976, KMUV abandoned its all-movie format and largely began to air Spanish-language programming, along with some English-language religious programs, with George Liberace resigning his managerial job with the station around this time.

In 1979, he retired from conducting and performing the violin onstage and devoted most of his time to managing the Liberace Museum in Las Vegas, even occasionally giving tours to visitors himself in showing the cars, pianos and costumes and other artifacts owned by his brother. From 1967 until his death, George Liberace was married to Eudora Albrecht. He lived most of his life in Palm Springs, California, in a house owned by his brother.

George Liberace died of leukemia at a hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 16, 1983, at age 72, and was interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills.

<text>Nanosys is a nanotechnology company located in Milpitas, California and founded in 2001. The company develops and manufactures quantum dot materials for display products.

==History==

On July 28, 2021, Bloomberg reported that Nanosys was in talks to go public via GigInternational1 SPAC. A transaction is set to value the combined entity at about $1 billion.

In May 2023, Dr. Martin Devenney was named chief executive officer. Devenney was the former chief operating officer. 

In September 2023, Nanosys was acquired by Shoei Chemical, Inc. 

==Products==

===Quantum Dot Enhancement Film (QDEF)===

Nanosys Quantum Dot Enhancement Film, or QDEF, is an optical film component for LED driven LCDs. Each sheet of QDEF contains trillions of tiny Quantum Dot Phosphors. QDEF enables LED-backlit LCDs to be brighter and more colorful by providing a high quality, tri-color white light from a standard blue LED light source. Larger than a water molecule, but smaller than a virus, these tiny phosphors convert blue light from a standard Gallium Nitride (GaN) LED into different wavelengths based upon their size. Larger dots emit longer wavelengths (red), while smaller dots emit shorter wavelengths (green). Blending together a mix of dot colors allows Nanosys to precisely engineer a new spectrum of light to customer specifications.

The Quantum Dots are tuned to create better color by changing their size during fabrication to emit light at just the right wavelengths. Traditional light emitting materials such as crystal phosphors have a broad fixed spectrum. Quantum dots can convert light to nearly any color in the visible spectrum, giving display designers the ability to tune and match the spectrum more accurately to color filters while improving energy efficiency.

QDEF was announced on May 17, 2011 at the Society for Information Display (SID) Display Week tradeshow. It has been adopted in products such as the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7 (2013) and the ASUS Zenbook NX-500 (2014).

At the Consumer Electronics Show 2015 it became known that Nanosys has licensed Samsung Electronics as well as 3M to manufacture QDEF products. QDEFs from 3M are used by top US TV brand Vizio (M-Series Quantum, P-Series Quantum &amp; P-Series Quantum X) as well as TV manufacturers Hisense (&quot;ULED TV&quot;) and TCL (&quot;QLED TV&quot;) TV sets.

In 2020, Nanosys announced a supply agreement with Shoei Chemical, a Japan-based producer of nanoparticles, under which the latter became the sole manufacturing partner of QD materials.
===QuantumRail===
Announced just after CES in January 2010 as part of a commercial agreement with Korean consumer electronics manufacturer and LG subsidiary LG Innotek, the quantum rail is a glass capillary optical component containing red and green quantum dots that is inserted between the LEDs and the lightguide panel (LGP) of an LED LCD in manufacturing to improve color gamut.

<text>Johnny Dare (born John William Caprefoli; August 27, 1968) is an American radio personality. He is host of &quot;The Johnny Dare Morning Show&quot; the morning show for 98.9 The Rock in Mission, Kansas. He is one of the station&#x27;s more prominent figures, and hosts the station&#x27;s annual concert festival, Rockfest, which has grown to become the biggest one-day concert event in the country.

==Career==
After cutting his teeth co-hosting a local segment on Kansas City affiliate for nationally syndicated radio network Z Rock, and working in the promotions department for local Top 40-turned-Young Country station KBEQ, Dare was hired by the late Doug Sorenson to work at the then one-year-old KQRC-FM.

Debuting on KQRC in 1993, The Johnny Dare and Murphy Morning Show quickly grew in popularity and has since consistently topped the Arbitron ratings for its time slot.

The show currently features (along with Dare), Nycki Pace, Kyle, Jake the Phone Snake and Gregg.

Despite a show that often pushes the envelope, with segments like &quot;Naked Twister&quot; that netted them a $220k fine from the Federal Communications Commission(FCC), the show gives back to the community thru their &quot;Hand Up Campaign&quot;, and with Dare&#x27;s involvement as Honorary Chairman of the March of Dimes annual Bikers for Babies Ride.

In 1996, Dare launched the Hope For The Holidays Campaign, helping individuals and families who aren&#x27;t able to be helped by conventional charities. This eventually spawned the Hand Up Campaign, spreading the message year round.

Dare is also the narrator on the truTV series, Full Throttle Saloon which focuses on the Sturgis, SD based bar of the same name.

In 2010, Dare spearheaded a backlash against Kansas City Parks board member, Aggie Stackhaus for comments made after the 2010 edition of Rockfest, when rain, mud and 55,000 concert-goers resulted in damage to the park grounds. (The station had already made arrangements to repair the damage) Stackhaus later resigned.

==Controversy==
In December 2004, the Federal Communications Commission proposed fines totaling $220,000 against Entercom Communications for alleged indecency violations during multiple broadcasts in April and May 2002 of the Morning Show on KQRC-FM in Kansas City, Kansas, and KFH-AM in Wichita, Kansas. The FCC claimed that the material included repeated graphic and explicit sexual descriptions that were pandering, titillating or used to shock the audience. As justification for proposing the maximum fine, the Commission noted &quot;the egregious nature of the violations and Entercom&#x27;s history of prior indecent broadcasts.&quot;

The commission&#x27;s official notice ran 28 pages, including 18 pages of transcripts for the four alleged violations. The FCC rejected Entercom&#x27;s contention that, because KQRC generally enjoys high ratings, &quot;the contemporary community standards of the Kansas City listening community are such that the material is not patently offensive.&quot; Entercom further argued that the FCC&#x27;s definition of indecency was &quot;unconstitutionally vague and overbroad&quot; citing Reno v. ACLU and Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition. The Commission said that the notion of contemporary standards is not different in different regions of the country, but reflects &quot;an average broadcast listener&quot; and isn&#x27;t tied to &quot;any particular geographic area.&quot;

In addition, the FCC said that a station&#x27;s popularity does not reflect acceptance of the broadcast material by the local community; &quot;Whether particular material is actionably indecent does not turn on whether the station that broadcast it [or the program] happens to be popular in its particular market.&quot; Finally, the Federal Communications Commission denied Entercom&#x27;s assertions of the unconstitutionality of its definition of indecency, stating in conclusion, &quot;The constitutional validity of the Commission&#x27;s indecency standard has been repeatedly affirmed by the courts&quot; and that Ashcroft v. Free Speech Commission and Reno v. ACLU did not alter this conclusion.

The FCC &#x27;Notice of Apparent Liability For Forfeiture&#x27; dated December 22, 2004, asserts that the fines were assessed for four separate on-air incidents which occurred on April 4, April 29, May 2, and May 3, 2002. The April 4 incident was in response to an on-air game of &quot;Naked Twister&quot; with local female contestants. The April 29 Incident stemmed from and interview with pornographic film star Dave Cummings in which Cummings described the events of the &quot;2002 Wildlife Productions Anal Contest&quot; in graphic detail. The incident on May 2 similarly stemmed from an interview with pornographic film star Ron Jeremy, particularly their discussion of Jeremy&#x27;s ability to &quot;self-fellate&quot;, and his graphic descriptions of sexual encounters with an obese woman. The final incident specifically named in the FCC notice occurred on May 3, 2002 when Sunset Thomas, a pornographic actress, was &quot;masturbated on-air to orgasm with a vibrator&quot; with assistance from then show member T-Bone.

<text>Leslie Tom Morris (October 10, 1904 – November 13, 1964) was a Welsh-Canadian politician, journalist and longtime member of the Communist Party of Canada and, its front group, the Labor-Progressive Party. He was leader of the Ontario Labor-Progressive Party in the 1940s and general secretary of the Communist Party of Canada from 1962 until his death in 1964.

==Life and career==
Morris was born in Somerset, England, to a Welsh working-class family. He and his family immigrated to Canada in 1910. Morris returned to the UK in 1917 and lived in Wales and England while working in the steel, coal mining and railway industries. He returned to Canada in time to join the Communist Party of Canada at its founding convention held December 1921 in Guelph, Ontario.

He became a prominent figure in the party first as secretary of the Young Communist League of Canada from 1923 to 1924, and then as editor over the years of various Communist newspapers including &quot;The Worker&quot;, &quot;Daily Clarion&quot;, &quot;Daily Tribune&quot; and &quot;Canadian Tribune&quot;.

Morris supported Tim Buck and the supporters of Joseph Stalin in the party during the factional struggles and purges of the late 1920s and early 1930s.

He was a candidate for the House of Commons of Canada on several occasions, but never elected:
* In the 1940 election, he ran as a Communist in Winnipeg North, coming in third place with 17% of the vote, which was larger than the number of votes separating the Conservative victor from the defeated Cooperative Commonwealth Federation incumbent, Abraham Albert Heaps.
*In a 1954 by-election, Morris was the Labor-Progressive candidate in the Toronto-area riding of York West, and came in fourth (and last) place with only 282 votes.
*In the 1958 election, he ran in York South, placing fourth out of five candidates with 427 votes.
*In the 1962 election, he ran for the Communist Party in the Toronto riding of Trinity winning 449 votes.
*He tried again in the 1963 election in the same riding, and won 391 votes

Morris also campaigned unsuccessfully for provincial office. In the Manitoba provincial election of 1932, he ran in the city of Winnipeg as a &quot;United Front Workers&quot; candidate (the Communist Party being under legal proscription at the time). At the time, the provincial constituency of Winnipeg elected ten members by the single transferable ballot system. Morris finished eighth on the first count, and came within 309 votes of winning the tenth seat on the final count. Had he won, he would have been the first Communist elected to a provincial legislature in Canada. Litterick would be elected in 1936 setting that record.)

Morris was a popular stump speaker for the party and toured the country speaking to left wing and labour audiences. From 1954 until 1957, he was the national organizer of the Labor-Progressive Party (as the Communist Party had been known since 1943) and, in 1962, he succeeded Tim Buck as General Secretary of the Communist Party of Canada (as it was again known) and held the position until his death two years later.

<text>Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne (4 September 1837 – 22 May 1913), was an Anglo-Irish lawyer and Lord Chancellor of Ireland.

==Background and education==
Born at 22 Merrion Square, Dublin, Gibson was the son of William Gibson J.P. (1808–1872), of Rockforest, County Tipperary, and Merrion Square, Dublin, by his first wife, Louisa, daughter of Joseph Grant, barrister of Dublin. He was the elder brother of John George Gibson, who was also a distinguished lawyer and judge of the High Court. He was educated at Trinity College Dublin, graduating BA in 1858, winning the gold medal in History, English Literature and Political Science. He was also an Auditor and a Gold Medallist of the College Historical Society, and became its president in 1883.

==Legal and judicial career==
Having been called to the Irish bar in 1860, Gibson was made an Irish Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1872 and three years later was elected Conservative Member of Parliament for Dublin University after unsuccessfully contesting Waterford. Enjoying the patronage of Benjamin Disraeli, Sir Stafford Northcote and Lord Randolph Churchill, he was appointed Attorney-General for Ireland in 1877, before being admitted to the Irish Privy Council, and then appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1885, becoming a British Privy Counsellor that same year.

On his appointment as Lord Chancellor, Gibson was raised to the peerage as Baron Ashbourne, of Ashbourne in the County of Meath, in 1885. He was almost single-handedly responsible for the drafting of the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act 1885 which was commonly known as the Ashbourne Act.
He resigned the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s office in February 1886 on the return of the Liberals to power, but was reappointed by Lord Salisbury in August of that year. For the next twenty years (with a short interval of three years when Gladstone returned to power in 1892), Lord Ashbourne held office as Lord Chancellor of Ireland, finally retiring at the age of 68. He was highly regarded as a judge even at a time when the Irish Bench boasted such outstanding judges as Gerald FitzGibbon, Hugh Holmes and Christopher Palles. It was in part at least due to his presidency that the Irish Court of Appeal gained a reputation as the strongest court ever to sit in Ireland.

In 1900, Winston Churchill&#x27;s agent Gerald Christie secured Ashbourne&#x27;s services to take the chair and introduce the journalist /politician&#x27;s Dublin lecture on his South African Adventures.

==Family==
Lord Ashbourne married Frances Maria Adelaide Colles (1849–1926), daughter of barrister Henry Jonathan Cope Colles and his wife Elizabeth Mary, daughter of John Mayne of Dublin, in 1868. Lady Ashbourne was a niece of John Dawson Mayne and granddaughter of Abraham Colles; her sister Anna married another eminent judge Sir Edmund Thomas Bewley

They lived in Fitzwilliam Square and produced four sons, the eldest son and heir being William Gibson, 2nd Baron Ashbourne, and four daughters. One of their daughters, Violet Gibson, made an attempt to assassinate Benito Mussolini in 1926. Lord Ashburne died in London in 1913 and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium, his ashes being placed in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Dublin. In Dublin, he was a member of the Kildare Street Club.

<text>Donald Patrick Murray (July 31, 1929 – February 2, 2024) was an American actor best known for his breakout performance in the film &quot;Bus Stop&quot; (1956, with Marilyn Monroe), which earned him a nomination for Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His other films include &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot; (1957), &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot; (1959, with James Cagney), &quot;One Foot in Hell&quot; (1960, with Alan Ladd), &quot;The Hoodlum Priest&quot; (1961), &quot;Advise &amp; Consent&quot; (1962, with Henry Fonda and Charles Laughton), &quot;Baby the Rain Must Fall&quot; (1965, with Steve McQueen and Lee Remick), &quot;Conquest of the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1972), &quot;Deadly Hero&quot; (1975), and &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; (1986, with Kathleen Turner).

Murray starred in television series such as &quot;The Outcasts&quot; (1968–1969), &quot;Knots Landing&quot; (1979–1981), and &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (2017).

==Early life and career==
Donald Patrick Murray was born in Los Angeles on July 31, 1929, the second of three children, to Dennis Aloisius Murray, a Broadway dance director and stage manager, and Ethel Murray (née Cook), a former Ziegfeld Follies performer.

Murray attended East Rockaway High School (class of 1947) in East Rockaway, New York, where he played football and was on the track team. He was a member of the student government, glee club, and joined the Alpha Phi chapter of the Omega Gamma Delta Fraternity. Upon graduation from high school, he studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. After graduating from the AADA, he soon made his Broadway debut in the play &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; (1951), as Jack Hunter.

A member of the Church of the Brethren, Murray registered as a conscientious objector during the Korean War, when many young American men were being drafted into the armed forces. Murray was assigned to alternative service in Europe, where he helped orphans and war casualties.

In 1954, Murray returned from Europe to the United States and acting. He starred alongside Mary Martin in the stage version of &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;. Upon seeing his performance in the play, director Joshua Logan decided to cast him in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, a play by William Inge.

==Film and television career==

Murray&#x27;s role as Beauregard &quot;Beau&quot; Decker in &quot;Bus Stop&quot; (1956) marked his film debut. He starred alongside Marilyn Monroe, who played Cherie, the object of his desire. His performance as the innocent cowboy who is determined to get Cherie was well received, and he was nominated for a BAFTA for Most Promising Newcomer and for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

In 1957, Murray starred as reserved, married bookkeeper Charlie Sampson in &quot;The Bachelor Party&quot;. That same year he starred in one of his most successful roles, that of Johnny Pope in the drama &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot;. Despite director Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s intention to typecast the actor as the comical brother Polo, Murray insisted on playing the lead. Thus he portrayed Johnny Pope, a morphine-addicted Korean War veteran. The film was one of the first to show the effects of drug abuse on those suffering from addiction and the people around them.

Murray starred as a blackmailed United States senator in &quot;Advise &amp; Consent&quot; (1962), a film version of a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Allen Drury. The movie was directed by Otto Preminger and cast Murray opposite Henry Fonda and Charles Laughton. He also co-starred with Steve McQueen in &quot;Baby the Rain Must Fall&quot; (1965), and played the ape-hating Governor Breck in &quot;Conquest of the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1972).

In 1976, Murray starred in the film &quot;Deadly Hero&quot;. In addition to acting, Murray directed a film based on the book &quot;The Cross and the Switchblade&quot; (1970).
He starred with Otis Young in the ABC western television series &quot;The Outcasts&quot; (1968–1969) featuring an interracial bounty hunter team in the post-Civil War West.

In 1979, Murray starred as Sid Fairgate on the prime-time soap opera &quot;Knots Landing&quot;. He also scripted two episodes of the program in 1980. In 1981, Murray decided to leave the series after two seasons to concentrate on other projects, but some sources say he left over a salary dispute. The character&#x27;s death was notable at the time, because it was considered rare to kill off a star character. The death came in the second episode of season three, following season two&#x27;s cliffhanger in which Sid&#x27;s car careened off a cliff. To make viewers doubt that the character had actually died, Murray was listed in the credit sequence for season three; in fact, season three revealed that Fairgate had survived the plunge off the cliff (thus temporarily reassuring the viewers), but died shortly afterwards in a hospital. Although he effectively distanced himself from the series after that, Murray later contributed an interview segment for &quot;Knots Landing: Together Again&quot;, a reunion special made in 2005.

==Retrospective==

In July 2014, a retrospective of Murray&#x27;s films was held at the Roxie Theater in San Francisco.

==Personal life==
In 1956, Murray married Hope Lange, with whom he had co-starred in &quot;Bus Stop&quot;. They had two children, Christopher and Patricia. They divorced in 1961. In 1962, he married Elizabeth Johnson and they had three children, Colleen, Sean, and Michael.

Murray lived in Goleta, California. He died at his home on February 2, 2024, at the age of 94.

<text>Alejandro González Iñárritu is a Mexican filmmaker. Primarily known for making modern psychological drama films about the human condition, his projects have garnered critical acclaim and numerous accolades including five Academy Awards, as well as a Special Achievement Award, three Golden Globe Awards, three BAFTA Awards, and two Directors Guild of America Awards. His most notable films include &quot;Amores perros&quot; (2000), &quot;21 Grams&quot; (2003), &quot;Babel&quot; (2006), &quot;Biutiful&quot; (2010), &quot;Birdman&quot; (2014), &quot;The Revenant&quot; (2015), and &quot;Bardo&quot; (2022).

&quot;Amores Perros&quot; (2000), and &quot;Biutiful&quot; (2010) each received nominations for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film. He earned critical and commercial success for his films &quot;21 Grams&quot; (2003), and &quot;Babel&quot; (2006). For &quot;Birdman&quot; (2014), he won three Academy Awards, for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. The following year, he was awarded Best Director for &quot;The Revenant&quot; (2015), making him the third director to win the award back-to-back after John Ford and Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Iñárritu was later awarded a Special Achievement Academy Award for his virtual reality installation &quot;Carne y Arena&quot; (2017).

Iñárritu became the first Mexican filmmaker to be nominated as director or producer in the history of the Academy Awards, as well as the first to win for Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture. He was the first Mexican filmmaker to receive the Best Director Award at Cannes. In 2019, Iñárritu became the first Latin American to serve as president of the jury for the 72nd Cannes Film Festival. Iñárritu and Mexican filmmakers Alfonso Cuarón and Guillermo del Toro are known in the film industry as &quot;The Three Amigos.&quot;

==Early life==
Iñárritu was born on 15 August 1963 in Mexico City, the youngest of seven siblings, to Luz María Iñárritu and Héctor González Gama. His maternal grandfather, Alfredo Iñárritu y Ramírez de Aguilar, was a prominent lawyer, judge, and justice of the Supreme Court of Mexico with partial Basque origins. Héctor was a banker who owned a ranch, but went bankrupt when Iñárritu was five. A poor student, Iñárritu was expelled from high school at the age of 16 or 17 due to poor grades and misbehavior. He briefly ran off with a girl from a wealthy family to Acapulco, having been influenced by the Miloš Forman film &quot;Hair&quot;, but returned to Mexico City after a week.

Soon after, Iñárritu left home and worked as a sailor on cargo boats, taking two trips at the ages of 16 and 18, sailing through the Mississippi River and then visiting Europe and Africa. With $1,000 supplied by his father, Iñárritu stayed in Europe for a year on the second trip. Around this time, Iñárritu had the opportunity to watch the Palme d&#x27;Or-winning film &quot;Yol&quot; by world-famous Kurdish director Yılmaz Güney. Iñárritu was very impressed by &quot;Yol&quot; and later said in interviews that this film was the reason he turned to cinema. According to some Turkish journalists, the scene in &quot;The Revenant&quot; (2015) where Leonardo DiCaprio enters the belly of a dying horse was a reference to Yılmaz Güney and his film &quot;Yol&quot;, because there was a similar scene in that film.

He has noted that these early travels as a young man have had a great influence on him as a filmmaker, and the settings of his films have often been in the places he visited during this period. After his travels, Iñárritu returned to Mexico City and majored in communications at Universidad Iberoamericana.

== Career ==

=== 1984–1999: Early career ===
Iñárritu began his career in 1984 as a radio host at the Mexican radio station WFM, the country&#x27;s most popular rock music station, where he &quot;pieced together playlists into a loose narrative arc&quot;. He worked with and interviewed artists like Robert Plant, David Gilmour, Elton John, Bob Geldof and Carlos Santana. He also wrote and broadcast small audio stories and storytelling promos. He later became the youngest producer for Televisa, the largest mass media company in Latin America. From 1987 to 1989, he composed music for six Mexican feature films. During this time, Iñárritu became acquainted with Mexican writer Guillermo Arriaga, beginning their screenwriting collaborations. Iñárritu has stated that he believes music has had a bigger influence on him as an artist than film itself. In the early 1990s, Iñárritu created Z Films, a production company, with Raul Olvera in Mexico. Under Z Films, he started writing, producing and directing short films and advertisements. Making the final transition into TV and film directing, he studied under well-known theater director Ludwik Margules, as well as Judith Weston in Los Angeles. In 1995, Iñárritu wrote and directed his first TV pilot for Z Films, called &quot;Detrás del dinero&quot;, or &quot;Behind the Money&quot;, starring Miguel Bosé.

=== 2000–2009: Directorial debut and breakthrough ===
In 2000, Iñárritu directed his first feature film &quot;Amores perros&quot;, written by Guillermo Arriaga. &quot;Amores perros&quot; explored Mexican society in Mexico City told via three intertwining stories. In 2000, &quot;Amores perros&quot; premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and won the Critics&#x27; Week Grand Prize. It was the film debut of actor Gael García Bernal, who would later appear in &quot;Babel&quot; and the Iñárritu-produced Mexican film &quot;Rudo y Cursi&quot;. &quot;Amores perros&quot; was
the first installment in Iñárritu&#x27;s and Arriaga&#x27;s thematic &quot;Death trilogy&quot;, and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In 2002, Iñárritu directed &quot;Powder Keg&quot;, an episode for the BMW short film series &quot;The Hire&quot;, starring Clive Owen as the driver and Stellan Skarsgård as a war photographer. It won the Cannes Gold Lion Advertising Award. 

After the success of &quot;Amores Perros&quot;, Iñárritu and Arriaga revisited the intersected-stories structure of &quot;Amores perros&quot; in Iñárritu&#x27;s second feature film, &quot;21 Grams&quot; (2003). The film starred Benicio del Toro, Naomi Watts and Sean Penn. It was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, where Penn received the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. At the 76th Academy Awards, Del Toro and Watts received nominations for their performances. From 2001 to 2011, Iñárritu directed several short films. In 2001, he directed an 11-minute film segment for &quot;11&#x27;09&quot;01 September 11&quot; - which is composed of several short films that explore the effects of the 9/11 terrorist attacks from different points of view around the world. In 2007, he made &quot;ANNA&quot;, part of French anthology film &quot;Chacun son cinéma&quot;, which screened at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. &quot;Chacun son cinéma&quot;, a collection of 33 short films by 35 renowned film directors representing 25 countries, was produced for the 60th anniversary of the film festival. In 2012, Iñárritu made the experimental short film &quot;Naran Ja: One Act Orange Dance&quot;, inspired by L.A Dance Project&#x27;s premiere performance, featuring excerpts from the new choreography Benjamin Millepied crafted for &quot;Moving Parts&quot;. The story takes place in a secluded, dusty space and centers around LADP dancer Julia Eichten.

Iñárritu embarked on his third and last film that formed the &quot;Death Trilogy&quot;, &quot;Babel&quot; (2006), written again by Arriaga. &quot;Babel&quot; comprises four interrelated stories set in Morocco, Mexico, the United States, and Japan, in four different languages. The film stars Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Adriana Barraza, Gael Garcia Bernal, Rinko Kikuchi and Kōji Yakusho. The rest of the cast comprised non-professional actors. The film competed at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, where Iñárritu received the Best Director Award (Prix de la mise en scène), becoming the first Mexican-born director to win the award. &quot;Babel&quot; was a critical and box office success. It received seven nominations at the 79th Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Gustavo Santaolalla, the film&#x27;s composer, won the Academy Award for Best Original Score. The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama in 2007. Iñárritu became the first Mexican director to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Directing and the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing. After this third feature film collaboration with writing partner Arriaga, Iñárritu and he professionally parted ways, following Iñárritu&#x27;s barring of Arriaga from the set during filming. Arriaga told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2009, &quot;It had to come to an end, but I still respect [González Iñárritu].&quot;

===2010–2019: Prominence and acclaim ===

In 2010, Iñárritu directed and produced &quot;Biutiful&quot;, starring Javier Bardem, written by Iñárritu, Armando Bó Jr., and Nicolás Giacobone. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2010. Bardem went on to win Best Actor (shared with Elio Germano for &quot;La nostra vita&quot;) at Cannes. &quot;Biutiful&quot; is Iñárritu&#x27;s first film in his native Spanish since his debut feature &quot;Amores perros&quot;. The film was nominated at the 2011 Golden Globes for Best Foreign Language Film, and at the BAFTA Awards for Best Film Not in the English Language and Best Actor. For the second time in his career, Iñárritu&#x27;s film was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards; Javier Bardem&#x27;s performance was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. In 2010, Iñárritu directed &quot;Write the Future&quot;, a football-themed commercial for Nike ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which went on to win the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions Advertising Festival. In 2012, he directed Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s &quot;Best Job&quot; commercial spot for the 2012 Olympic Ceremonies. It won the Best Primetime Commercial Emmy at Creative Arts Emmy Awards and the DGA Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Commercials. On 4 October 2012, Facebook released an Iñárritu-directed brand film titled &quot;The Things That Connect Us&quot; to celebrate the social network reaching one billion users. 

In December 2013, Warner Bros. hired Iñárritu to direct a live-action adaptation of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1894 book &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. Eventually, Andy Serkis directed the film titled &quot;&quot; (2018). In 2014, Iñárritu won three Academy Awards for directing, co-writing and co-producing Best Picture winner &quot;Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)&quot;, starring Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, and Andrea Riseborough. The film is an existential dark comedy exploring the ego of a forgotten superhero actor, experienced as if filmed on a single shot. It was the first time a Mexican Filmmaker received Best Picture at the Academy Awards. He also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay, a DGA Award and a PGA Award for the film. Iñárritu was also set to direct and produce the tv series &quot;One Percent,&quot; an organic farming drama which he co-created with Alexander Dinelaris, Nicolas Giacobone, and Armando Bo for Starz. Starz gave the show a straight-to-series order, but dropped out in 2017 as the U.S. broadcaster of the series, with production company MRC shopping the project to other networks or streaming platforms.

In 2015, Iñárritu directed &quot;The Revenant&quot;, initially adapted by Mark L. Smith, before joined the writing process, based on Michael Punke&#x27;s novel of the same name. The film is a remake of the film &quot;Man in the Wilderness&quot; (1971) and starred Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, and Domhnall Gleeson. It is a &quot;gritty&quot; 19th-century period drama-thriller about fur trapper Hugh Glass, a real person who joined the Rocky Mountain Fur Company on a &quot;journey into the wild&quot; and was robbed and abandoned after being mauled by a grizzly bear. The film considers the nature and stresses on relationships under the duress of the wilderness, and issues of revenge and pardon via Glass&#x27;s pursuit of the man who was responsible for his hardship. &quot;The Revenant&quot; took nine months to shoot. With &quot;The Revenant&quot; being a critical and commercial success, Iñárritu won a second consecutive Oscar for Best Director and was nominated for 12 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, winning Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Actor. Iñárritu is one of only three directors to ever win consecutive Oscars, and the first to do it in 65 years. He was also nominated for four Golden Globe Awards, winning three, including Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Director; received nine Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director; five BAFTAs including Best Picture and Best Director; and a DGA Award, making history as the first person to ever win two in a row.
&quot;The One Percent&quot;, originally planned as an upcoming American television drama series created and written by Iñárritu, Alexander Dinelaris Jr., Nicolás Giacobone and Armando Bó, was eventually postponed on early March 2017 due to Alejandro feeling burnt out after the production of &quot;The Revenant&quot;. The quartet, who also collaborated on &quot;Birdman&quot;, were to serve as executive producers. Iñárritu was set to direct the first two episodes and set the visual style of the show. Iñárritu&#x27;s virtual reality project &quot;Carne y Arena&quot; was the first ever VR installation presented at the Cannes Film Festival in 2017. Carne y Arena was also presented, at LACMA, Washington, D.C., and featured at the Prada Foundation in Milan. Additionally, &quot;Carne y Arena&quot; was awarded the first Special Achievement Academy Award in over 20 years at the Academy&#x27;s 9th Annual Governors Awards.

=== 2020–present ===
Iñárritu co-wrote, co-produced and directed the 2022 Spanish-language film &quot;Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths&quot;, starring Daniel Giménez Cacho and Griselda Siciliani. It is his first film made in Mexico since &quot;Amores Perros&quot; (2000). It premiered at the 79th Venice International Film Festival, where it competed for the Golden Lion and was later distributed by Netflix. &quot;Bardo&quot; polarized critics and received mixed reviews. Film critic Wendy Ide of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the film &quot;occasionally brilliant&quot; and &quot;audacious, bold film-making&quot; but &quot;cluttered with symbolism and bloated with self-regard&quot;. Iñárritu described the response from critics as being &quot;racist&quot; saying, &quot;You can like it or not — that&#x27;s not the discussion. But for me, there&#x27;s a kind of racist undercurrent where because I&#x27;m Mexican, I&#x27;m pretentious&quot;. It earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography at the 85th Academy Awards. 

In February 2024, it was announced that he is making a new English-language film distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, with Legendary Pictures co-producing. Tom Cruise is set to star.

==Influences==
Iñarritu&#x27;s cinematic influences include Max Ophüls, Robert Altman, Sidney Lumet, Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Luis Buñuel, Andrei Tarkovsky, Sergio Leone, Martin Scorsese, Yılmaz Güney, and John Cassavetes. However, his influences are not limited to film and come from a variety of sources.

==Personal life==
Iñárritu has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He is married to Maria Eladia Hagerman, an editor and graphic designer. They have a daughter, Maria Eladia, and a son, Eliseo.

In 2009, Iñárritu, along with several filmmakers and actors, signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival following his arrest in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown &quot;freely and safely&quot;, and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door &quot;for actions of which no-one can know the effects.&quot;

<doc id="869927" wikidata="Q6714500" url="?curid=869927" title="MASA syndrome">
<text>MASA syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive neurological disorder on the L1 disorder spectrum belonging in the group of hereditary spastic paraplegias a paraplegia known to increase stiffness spasticity in the lower limbs. This syndrome also has two other names, CRASH syndrome and Gareis-Mason syndrome.

==Signs and symptoms==

The acronym &quot;MASA&quot; stands for the four main signs and symptoms associated with the syndrome: (1) mental retardation (mild to moderate intellectual disability), (2) aphasia (delayed onset of speech), (3) shuffling gait, and (4) adducted thumbs characterized by cleft palate, microcephaly, and dysmyelination. Affected males may also have a variable dilatation (widening) of the third heart ventricle. MASA has five other factors including hydrocephalus. The build-up is often caused by an obstruction that prevents proper fluid drainage. Spasticity of the lower limbs, causing the muscles to stiffen or tighten, preventing normal fluid movement. Aphasia, which is when someone loses the ability to understand or express speech, due to brain damage. Seizures, an abrupt, uncontrolled disturbance in the brain. Lastly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, a rare congenital disorder. It is characterized by a partial or complete absence (agenesis) of an area of the brain that connects the two cerebral hemispheres.

==Genetics==

MASA syndrome has been associated with variants in the L1CAM gene which is an axonal glycoprotein that is essential for normal development of the central and peripheral nervous systems during the fetal period and postnatally. The symptoms are typically more intensive in males, due to the fact that males inherit only one X chromosome so a mutation in that one chromosome would cause the condition. Females are less likely to be affected because they have two X chromosomes. The prevalence is approximately 1 in 30,000 males. Fathers cannot pass the chromosomes to their sons, but only to their female offspring.

== Diagnosis ==
A diagnosis can be made when the clinical features have been identified, mainly the four common signs and symptoms. This can then be confirmed by single-gene sequencing, where the L1CAM gene is examined for any possible variations.

A diagnostic test prior-to-birth is possible and very reliable when the mother is a carrier of the diseased allele. First, it&#x27;s necessary to determine the fetus&#x27; sex and then study the X-chromosomes inherited from the mother. The probability of transferring the variant X-chromosome to the descendants is 50% regardless of the sex of the fetus (as illustrated by the figure). Male descendants who inherit the varied X-chromosome will express the symptoms of the syndrome, on the other hand females who inherit the varied X-chromosome will become carriers of the mutated gene and will not show any symptoms or clinical features of the syndrome.

== Treatment ==
As of now, the only treatment for this disease is expertise in pediatrics, child neurology, neurosurgery, rehabilitation, and medical genetics. As some parts of the body can be damaged through time to time it can be useful to have the expertise to identify what other ways they can help for the complete health of the child.

== Previous Cases ==
The first case of the MASA Syndrome was found in a boy in Asia. The patient was a 10-year-old boy with symptoms like, mild mental retardation, bilateral adducted thumbs and corpus callosum hypoplasia. His family did not have any history with MASA syndrome. There is not just one specific doctor or scientist for this disorder. Since the L1 syndrome is composed of many X-linked disorders, more than one doctor or scientist may find the disorder in a person. Most of the doctors who find the disorder are Neuroscientists and some Pediatric Neurology specialists.

<text>Chrome, Smoke &amp; BBQ is a 4-CD box set by American rock band ZZ Top. Released in 2003, it is a compilation album of material from the band&#x27;s tenures with London Records and Warner Bros. Records, recorded from 1967 to 1992. An abbreviated 2-CD version of this compilation, &quot;Rancho Texicano: The Very Best of ZZ Top&quot; (2004), was released the following year.

== Release of original mixes ==
At the time of its release in 2003, &quot;Chrome, Smoke &amp; BBQ&quot; was noteworthy because it was the only CD release, except for the greatest hits album &quot;The Best of ZZ Top&quot; (1977/CD 1984), which used the original mixes of tracks from the band&#x27;s first five studio albums. Other track or whole album CD releases for those five albums used remixed versions from 1987. (See &quot;The Six Pack&quot; box set.) These remixed versions displeased many fans because they significantly changed the sound from the original albums.

&quot;The Best of ZZ Top&quot; (1977) was first released on CD in 1984, and uses the original track mixes for the CD. It includes one track from &quot;ZZ Top&#x27;s First Album&quot;, two from &quot;Rio Grande Mud&quot;, four from &quot;Tres Hombres&quot; and three from &quot;Fandango!&quot;. &quot;Tres Hombres&quot; and &quot;Fandango!&quot; were reissued on CD in 2006, and were remastered using the original mixes. &quot;Chrome, Smoke &amp; BBQ&quot; is the first ZZ Top track compilation release to include anything from the &quot;Tejas&quot; album.

In 2013, Warner Bros. Records released the CD box set &quot;The Complete Studio Albums 1970–1990&quot;, which includes the first ten ZZ Top studio albums, all with their original mixes. The timeframe of that ten album box set corresponds basically with the timeframe of &quot;Chrome, Smoke &amp; BBQ&quot;, that is, the London Records and Warner Bros. Records recording years.

<doc id="869937" wikidata="Q300801" url="?curid=869937" title="Aagenaes syndrome">
<text>Aagenaes syndrome is a syndrome characterised by congenital hypoplasia of lymph vessels, which causes lymphedema of the legs and recurrent cholestasis in infancy, and slow progress to hepatic cirrhosis and giant cell hepatitis with fibrosis of the portal tracts.

The genetic cause is due to point mutation (c.-98G&gt;T) in the 5’-untranslated region of Unc-45 myosin chaperone A (UNC45A) and it is autosomal recessively inherited and the gene is located to chromosome 15q1,2. The mutation leads to a loss of function of the protein, which in turn seem to lead to mislocalization of the hepatobiliary transport proteins BSEP (bile salt export pump) and MRP2 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 2). 

A common feature of the condition is a generalised lymphoedema from birth or childhood caused by hypoplasia of the lymphatic vessels in origin1. Approximately one hundred people with this disease are known. The condition is particularly frequent in southern Norway, where more than half the cases are reported, but it is found in patients in other parts of Europe and the United States. It is named after Øystein Aagenæs, a Norwegian paediatrician. It is also called cholestasis-lymphedema syndrome (CLS).

The first case of cholestasis usually improves spontaneously during preschool and early school age and returns at various intervals of two to six months. The severity of the disease varies in these patients, with some even experiencing complete liver failure. In these cases, liver transplantation is necessary. Untreated cholestasis is accompanied by jaundice, itching, malabsorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins. This can lead to skeletal abnormalities and a higher susceptibility to bleeding. In early childhood and adolescence, lymphedema most often develops in all patients&#x27; lower limbs, but the upper limbs or chest are no exception. Untreated lymphedema can cause chronic tissue damage.

== Biochemical analysis ==
A biochemical analysis revealed a significant increase of bilirubin concentration in patients in the first months of life, with a later decrease. Around the age of 3 or 4, the value was optimized to normal limits.

In patients aged 10–20 years, serum concentrations of bilirubin, bile acids and transaminases (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase) reached normal or almost optimal values.

Patients without observed liver cirrhosis compared to the control group had elevated levels of ALP (alkaline phosphatase) and GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase). There was no significant difference in serum bile acid concentrations between patients and control group. However, test patients had lower values for total protein, CRP, albumin and creatinine. Moreover, the value for fibrinogen was higher in patients with Aagenaes syndrome.

There was only a slight increase in mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) in terms of erythrocyte, leukocyte and platelet counts. Serum albumin concentrations decreased with age, but not in the control group.

== Treatment ==
Although no cure for this disease has been found, improvements in the course of the disease have been significantly seen after the administration of nutritional and vitamin supplements, especially in children. It is stated that if there is no remission by about 12 to 18 months of childhood, liver transplantation is necessary at a later age.

Neonatal cholestasis lasted no more than one year in some patients or lasted until the age of 6/7 years in some cases. In recent decades, cholestatic episodes have lasted a shorter time than before 1970. There has also been a decline in rickets, growth retardation, and neuropathy over time. The reasons for this are improved nutritional habits, vitamin and cholestyramine supplementation. Nevertheless, it is not yet possible to prevent serious liver disease.

== History ==
The first reported cases of Aagenaes syndrome were described in a study in 1968 from the southwest of Norway. Four out of five children born before 1939 died of bleeding in the first weeks of life. Vitamin K was introduced this year, after the birth of another four children after 1939. When these children received one dose of this vitamin, three of them died at the age of 5–9 months. The confirmed cause of death in one or two children in this group was bleeding. The remaining seven children, born in 1935 and in 1942–1966, who were part of a study published in 1968, were alive at the time.

<doc id="869942" wikidata="Q344361" url="?curid=869942" title="Tennis (1981 video game)">
<text>Tennis is a sports video game for the Atari VCS (later called the Atari 2600) which was written by Activision co-founder Alan Miller and published by Activision in 1981.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Tennis&quot; offers singles matches for one or two players; one player is colored pink, the other blue. The game has two user-selectable speed levels. When serving and returning shots, the tennis players automatically swing forehand or backhand depending on the situation, and all shots automatically clear the net and land in bounds.

The first player to win one six-game set is declared the winner of the match (if the set ends in a 6-6 tie, the set restarts from 0-0). This differs from professional tennis, where players must win at least two out of three six-game sets.

==Reception==
&quot;Tennis&quot; received an award for &quot;Best Competitive Game&quot; and an honorable mention for &quot;Best Sports Game&quot; at the 3rd annual Arkie Awards. Arkie Award judges stated &quot;&quot;Tennis&quot; is as far removed from the primitive &quot;Pong&quot;-style games from which it derives as gasoline is from the dinosaurs&quot;, and specific praise was given to the game&#x27;s &quot;realistic illusion of depth&quot; and its competitive aspects which allow for &quot;hard fought contest[s]&quot; and &quot;glorious comebacks from the brink of defeat&quot; and which give &quot;more methodical players a chance to taste victory against the kings and queens of hand-eye coordination&quot;.

Covered in &quot;Video&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1982 Guide to Electronic Games, &quot;Tennis&quot; was characterized by critics as &quot;not terribly complicated&quot;, but also as &quot;one of the few very good sports games for the Atari VCS&quot;.

<doc id="869944" wikidata="Q736917" url="?curid=869944" title="Geological formation">
<text>A geological formation, or simply formation, is a body of rock having a consistent set of physical characteristics (lithology) that distinguishes it from adjacent bodies of rock, and which occupies a particular position in the layers of rock exposed in a geographical region (the stratigraphic column). It is the fundamental unit of lithostratigraphy, the study of strata or rock layers.

A formation must be large enough that it can be mapped at the surface or traced in the subsurface. Formations are otherwise not defined by the thickness of their rock strata, which can vary widely. They are usually, but not universally, tabular in form. They may consist of a single lithology (rock type), or of alternating beds of two or more lithologies, or even a heterogeneous mixture of lithologies, so long as this distinguishes them from adjacent bodies of rock.

The concept of a geologic formation goes back to the beginnings of modern scientific geology. The term was used by Abraham Gottlob Werner in his theory of the origin of the Earth, which was developed over the period from 1774 to his death in 1817. The concept became increasingly formalized over time and is now codified in such works as the North American Stratigraphic Code and its counterparts in other regions.

Geologic maps showing where various formations are exposed at the surface are fundamental to such fields as structural geology, allowing geologists to infer the tectonic history of a region or predict likely locations for buried mineral resources.

==Defining formations==


The boundaries of a formation are chosen to give it the greatest practical lithological consistency. Formations should not be defined by any criteria other than lithology. The lithology of a formation includes characteristics such as chemical and mineralogical composition, texture, color, primary depositional structures, fossils regarded as rock-forming particles, or other organic materials such as coal or kerogen. The taxonomy of fossils is &quot;not&quot; a valid lithological basis for defining a formation.

The contrast in lithology between formations required to justify their establishment varies with the complexity of the geology of a region. Formations must be able to be delineated at the scale of geologic mapping normally practiced in the region; the thickness of formations may range from less than a meter to several thousand meters.

Geologic formations are typically named after a permanent natural or artificial feature of the geographic area in which they were first described. The name consists of the geographic name plus either &quot;Formation&quot; or a descriptive name. Examples include the Morrison Formation, named for the town of Morrison, Colorado, and the Kaibab Limestone, named after the Kaibab Plateau of Arizona. The names must not duplicate previous formation names, so, for example, a newly designated formation could not be named the Kaibab Formation, since the Kaibab Limestone is already established as a formation name. The first use of a name has precedence over all others, as does the first name applied to a particular formation.

As with other stratigraphic units, the formal designation of a formation includes a &quot;stratotype&quot; which is usually a &quot;type section.&quot; A type section is ideally a good exposure of the formation that shows its entire thickness. If the formation is nowhere entirely exposed, or if it shows considerably lateral variation, additional &quot;reference sections&quot; may be defined. Long-established formations dating to before the modern codification of stratigraphy, or which lack tabular form (such as volcanic formations), may substitute a type locality for a type section as their stratotype. The geologist defining the formation is expected to describe the stratotype in sufficient detail that other geologists can unequivocally recognize the formation.

Although formations should not be defined by any criteria other than primary lithology, it is often useful to define biostratigraphic units on paleontological criteria, chronostratigraphic units on the age of the rocks, and chemostratigraphic units on geochemical criteria, and these are included in stratigraphic codes.

==Usefulness of formations==
The concept of formally defined layers or strata is central to the geologic discipline of stratigraphy, and the formation is the fundamental unit of stratigraphy. Formations may be combined into groups of strata or divided into members. Members differ from formations in that they need not be mappable at the same scale as formations, though they must be lithologically distinctive where present.

The definition and recognition of formations allow geologists to correlate geologic strata across wide distances between outcrops and exposures of rock strata. Formations were at first described as the essential geologic time markers, based on their relative ages and the law of superposition. The divisions of the geological time scale were described and put in chronological order by the geologists and stratigraphers of the 18th and 19th centuries.

Geologic formations can be usefully defined for sedimentary rock layers, low-grade metamorphic rocks, and volcanic rocks. Intrusive igneous rocks and highly metamorphosed rocks are generally not considered to be formations, but are described instead as lithodemes.

== Other uses of the term ==

&quot;Formation&quot; is also used informally to describe the odd shapes (forms) that rocks acquire through erosional or depositional processes. Such a formation is abandoned when it is no longer affected by the geologic agent that produced it. Some well-known cave formations include stalactites and stalagmites.

<doc id="869945" wikidata="Q3177444" url="?curid=869945" title="Yorkshire County Cricket Club">
<text>Yorkshire County Cricket Club is a professional Cricket club based in Yorkshire, England. The team competes in the County Championship, the top tier of English First-class cricket. Nicknamed &quot;Vikings&quot;. Yorkshire also competes in T20 Blast, One-Day Cup. Yorkshire&#x27;s first team is the most successful in English cricketing history with 33 County Championship titles, including one shared. The team&#x27;s most recent Championship title was in 2015. 

The clubs limited overs team was originally branded Yorkshire Carnigie. From the 2013 season they were called the Yorkshire Vikings. For the 2025 season all of the clubs mens and women&#x27;s teams will return to conpeting under the single Yorkshire name.

The clubs traditional colours are Cambridge blue, Oxford blue, and Old Gold.

Yorkshire teams formed by earlier organisations, essentially the old Sheffield Cricket Club, played top-class cricket from the 18th century and the county club has always held first-class status. Yorkshire have competed in the County Championship since the official start of the competition in 1890 and have played in every top-level domestic cricket competition in England. The team play most of their home games at Headingley Cricket Ground in Leeds. Another significant venue is at North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough, which houses the annual Scarborough Festival. Yorkshire have used other grounds in the past including The Fartown Ground, Huddersfield; Bramall Lane, Sheffield, which was the club&#x27;s original home; Horton Park Avenue, Bradford; St George&#x27;s Road Cricket Ground, Harrogate; The Circle, Kingston upon Hull; and Acklam Park, Middlesbrough.

==Earliest cricket in Yorkshire==
The earliest certain reference to cricket in Yorkshire dates from 1751 when local matches were held in Sheffield and a game took place on or soon after Monday, 5 August at Stanwick, near Richmond, between the Duke of Cleveland&#x27;s XI and Earl of Northumberland&#x27;s XI; the same teams earlier played a game at Durham.

Sheffield Cricket Club was probably formed about this time and there are references to Sheffield matches in Derbyshire in 1757 and home and away matches against Leeds in 1765. A club was formed in Leeds in 1760 and in York in 1784. Bedale in North Yorkshire was a noted centre in the early 19th century. But cricket in most rural areas was slow to develop. Yorkshire cricket became centred around Sheffield, where it was more organised than in the rest of the county.

From 1771, Sheffield played semi-regular matches against Nottingham Cricket Club. Nottingham was generally the better side and Sheffield sometimes played with more players to give them a greater chance of victory. Nevertheless, the Sheffield player Tom Marsden was regarded as one of the leading players in the country in the 1820s.

Cricket increased in popularity after one of the 1827 roundarm trial matches was played at the purpose-built Darnall New Ground in Sheffield to evaluate the new style of roundarm bowling. After this match, many new cricket clubs were formed in the county.

In 1833, &quot;Yorkshire&quot; was first used as the name of the team, although it contained eleven Sheffield players, for a game against Norfolk at the Hyde Park Ground in Sheffield. The name may have arisen from a need to match the status of Norfolk as a county rather than a city. There were some differences in the organisation of the Yorkshire team &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; those called Sheffield as it included three amateurs while Sheffield teams were entirely professional. Yorkshire, as such, played intermittently over the next thirty years but was not organised in any formal way. Among their opponents were Sussex in 1835; Manchester in 1844 and 1845; and Kent in 1849. Also in 1849, Yorkshire played against a &quot;Lancashire&quot; team for the first time, though it was really a Sheffield v Manchester match. By 1855, Sheffield and Yorkshire were playing at Bramall Lane.

==Club history==
===Origin===

On 7 March 1861, during a meeting at the Adelphi Hotel in Sheffield, a Match Fund Committee was established to run Yorkshire county matches. The committee was made up from the management committee of the Bramall Lane ground and representatives from clubs willing to pay £1 to the fund. But the committee was unable to persuade other clubs that it was not seeking to promote Sheffield cricket and a lack of funds prevented some matches being played in 1862.

By this time, there were several cricketers with good reputations and the county team was one of the strongest in England. Consequently, on 8 January 1863, Yorkshire County Cricket Club was formed. Membership was unlimited and cost a minimum of 10s and 6d. Like most first-class cricket clubs of the time, Yorkshire relied on private patronage with administrators &quot;paying to serve&quot; and &quot;moneyed enthusiasts&quot; acting as ready match sponsors. The majority of players were freelance professionals who were paid a usual match fee of £5, from which all travel and accommodation had to be paid. Travel could be arduous, living away from home could be &quot;rough&quot; and sometimes the match fee was not enough to cover expenses, especially if, as was often a problem with early Yorkshire cricketers, &quot;the ale-house was a temptation&quot;.

The first club President was former player Thomas Barker, who had become Mayor of Sheffield, although he probably never attended any meetings. Michael Ellison was the first club Treasurer and at some point early in Yorkshire&#x27;s history, he assumed the Presidency. Most official accounts record Ellison as Yorkshire&#x27;s first President. Joseph (&quot;J. B.&quot;) Wostinholm became the first of four long-serving club Secretaries in 1864. The first team captain was Roger Iddison, a professional cricketer.

The objective of the club was to play matches &quot;either in Sheffield or in any other towns of the county according as arrangements may be made&quot;. Other locations in Yorkshire were unable or unwilling to host fixtures in the first years of the club, and Bradford and York continued to attempt to organise games in competition with Yorkshire, sometimes causing confusion among other counties. Attempts to form an alternative Yorkshire team continued intermittently until 1884 although, by 1873, most clubs had accepted the authority of the Sheffield-based county club.

===1863–1882===

Yorkshire played their inaugural first-class match against Surrey at The Oval on 4, 5 and 6 June 1863. Surrey scored 315 runs, to which Yorkshire replied with 257. Surrey were bowled out for 60 before the match was drawn. The team recorded their first win in the following match against the strong Nottinghamshire team and although they lost the return match, won two and lost only one of the four matches played in their first season. In 1864, the team won two and lost four of seven matches.

In 1865, the club and players became involved in a dispute. Five players – Roger Iddison, George Anderson, George Atkinson, Joseph Rowbotham and Ned Stephenson – refused to play against Surrey. This concerned a controversy that arose in 1862 when Iddison and Anderson played for an All-England team against Surrey at The Oval and the Kent bowler Edgar Willsher was repeatedly no-balled for using an overarm action by an umpire whom, they claimed, had been appointed by Surrey specifically for that purpose. Anderson stated in 1865 that he &quot;would not play against those who have combined to sweep us from the cricket field altogether if they could&quot;.

The dispute was about a point of principle and centred on the right of bowlers to use an overarm action, which had been legalised ahead of the 1864 season. Consequently, with several important players missing, Yorkshire did not win a game in 1865 and were forced to cancel some matches for the 1866 season. The Yorkshire Committee and the players came to an understanding in early 1867 after the players apologised, but Anderson never represented the county again.

With the player dispute resolved, Yorkshire won all seven of their matches in 1867, defeating Surrey, Lancashire and Cambridgeshire. As a result, the sporting press proclaimed Yorkshire to be the &quot;Champion County&quot; for the first time. The following year, John Thewlis scored the first century for Yorkshire in first-class cricket, against Surrey at The Oval; in 1869, Joseph Rowbotham became the first man to score two centuries in a season for Yorkshire. Yorkshire won four games in both 1868 and 1869; one sports publication regarded Yorkshire as equal champions in the latter year. The team won six out of seven in 1870 to be acclaimed as Champion County again. Much of Yorkshire&#x27;s success in these years came from the bowling combination of George Freeman and Tom Emmett.

Following Freeman&#x27;s retirement from regular cricket after 1870, Yorkshire declined, winning fewer games in 1871 and 1872 as Gloucestershire rose to a position of dominance in County Cricket, driven by the success of W. G. Grace and his brothers. Conscious of the need to strengthen the club, Yorkshire instituted a Colts team of young players, but replaced Iddison as captain at the end of the 1872 season. Rowbotham, another professional, assumed the position. For the 1873 season, county cricket moved a step closer towards an organised competition when the counties agreed qualification rules for players to be eligible for a team; for many years, this was considered to be start of the County Championship. However, the counties did not organise a formal competition and the &quot;Champion County&quot; was still decided by the press; some publications disagreed.
Despite the team containing effective players, Yorkshire did not perform as well as expected over the next seasons. The bowling attack was strong, the team contained some experienced players and critics believed Ephraim Lockwood to be the best professional batsman in the country. In 1873, Yorkshire won seven games and lost five and for the following season, Luke Greenwood replaced Rowbotham as captain. The team had an improved record, but although second only to Gloucestershire, Yorkshire lost heavily in both encounters between the teams. Greenwood retired, Rowbotham resumed the captaincy for 1875, and Lockwood took over in 1876. The team did not perform particularly well in either season, but their worst performance came in 1877, winning two games – but none of the last ten – and losing seven. This placed them eighth out of nine counties.

Tom Emmett then took over as captain, but the following two seasons brought mixed results as the team displayed inconsistency, often losing to teams they should comfortably have beaten. Derek Hodgson, in his official county history, suggests a lack of discipline in the team throughout these years was to blame; contemporary reports suggested the team drank too much alcohol to be effective. The players also suffered from public attention, receiving generous hospitality at times which impacted on their performances. In these seasons, the team often began well only to lose form later in the season and the Yorkshire committee was reluctant to replace the experienced cricketers with younger players. However, off the field, Yorkshire became increasingly successful, and the profits made by the club paid for improvements to be made to the Bramall Lane Ground and increased player wages through the introduction of travelling expenses and talent money where good performances were financially rewarded. An influx of what proved to be effective new players saw Yorkshire finish second to Lancashire in the unofficial Championship for 1881, but more significant was the debut for the county of Lord Hawke, then aged 21.

The team faded again in 1882 and Hawke, who had refused the captaincy earlier, was appointed team captain at the end of the season, the first amateur to hold this position. Previous captains had all been professionals: Roger Iddison (1863–1872), Joseph Rowbotham (1873 and 1875), Luke Greenwood (1874), Ephraim Lockwood (1876–1877) and Tom Emmett (1878–1882). Hawke remained in charge for 28 seasons until 1910, during which time the team won eight County Championships.

===1883–1918===
In an obituary tribute, the editor of &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; said that Lord Hawke&#x27;s &quot;strength of character was tested&quot; when, as a young man on leaving Cambridge University, he undertook the responsibility of captaining the Yorkshire side, composed at that time of &quot;elements that were not entirely harmonious&quot;. Owing to Hawke&#x27;s &quot;tact, judgment and integrity&quot;, he moulded the Eleven into &quot;the best and probably the most united county cricket team in England&quot;.

Yorkshire to 1883 was widely seen as an idiosyncratic team and, though Hawke&#x27;s primary task as captain was to lead the team to fulfilment of its potential, his biggest challenge was to unite the club&#x27;s geographical and social factions. At the end of the 1882 season, in addition to appointing Hawke as captain, the committee agreed to reorganise itself for the first time since the club&#x27;s foundation and began a process which eventually made the club representative of the whole county and not just Sheffield.

Hawke succeeded Emmett in 1883 and remained as official captain for 27 years, but at first he was careful to take his time and did not make too many changes. Yorkshire improved in 1883 and finished second behind Nottinghamshire in the unofficial County Championship. However, the remainder of the 1880s was disappointing for the team and its supporters. Kilburn said that Yorkshire &quot;continued to be an unreliable side, mingling brilliant achievement with miserable performance&quot;. The basic problem was that the older players were past their peak while younger replacements did not make the progress expected. A poor season on the field in 1889 was reflected by reduced income and changes were made with several good new players being introduced. These included Jack Brown, David Hunter and Stanley Jackson, while Bobby Peel was becoming increasingly effective as a bowling all-rounder. They were followed by John Tunnicliffe, David Denton, Ted Wainwright and George Hirst. Hawke worked on fielding practice and the players became specialised and efficient as fielders.

In 1893, the club&#x27;s initial reorganisation was completed and was finalised after Ellison died in 1898 and Hawke assumed the club presidency as well as captaincy. When Wostinholm died in 1902 after being club secretary for 38 years, the county offices were moved from Sheffield to the more central location of Leeds.

It was in 1893 that the team finally came good and Yorkshire won their first official County Championship. Hodgson wrote that it was &quot;perhaps ... the first confirmation of Hawke&#x27;s striving for teamwork and discipline&quot;. Yorkshire achieved second and third places in 1894 and 1895. The team continued to develop as Brown and Tunnicliffe established an effective opening partnership backed up by Denton and Jackson while Peel, Wainwright and Hirst carried the bowling attack.

Yorkshire historian R. S. Holmes described Yorkshire as &quot;prodigious&quot; in 1896, when they won their second title with some outstanding batting performances including a championship record total of 887 against Warwickshire. Hawke began the practice of paying the professionals over the winter, initially £2 per week; the scheme was later modified to include bonuses. Peel was sacked in 1897 after appearing drunk on the field and was replaced in 1898 by Wilfred Rhodes, who took 141 wickets in his debut season. In the same season, Brown and Tunnicliffe established a record partnership for the first wicket when they scored 554 against Derbyshire at Chesterfield. Yorkshire won their third Championship in 1898 and narrowly failed in 1899 when only a defeat late in the season by Kent prevented the retention of the title.
Between 1900 and 1902, Yorkshire lost only twice in the County Championship, both times to Somerset, and won the County Championship in all three seasons largely thanks to their two outstanding all-rounders Hirst and Rhodes. When Joseph Wolstinholm retired as club secretary after the 1902 season, he was succeeded by Frederick Toone who held the post until his death in June 1930 and formed a successful liaison with Hawke. Toone and Hawke worked together to improve the terms and conditions of professional players&#x27; contracts. To 1914, they were paid £5 for a home match and £6 for an away match with a £1 win bonus. Players who had received their county cap were obliged to join the Cricketers&#x27; Friendly Society and were paid a winter wage of £2 a week.

Yorkshire remained a strong championship contender through the 1903 to 1914 seasons and won a further three titles in this period, also finishing as runners-up three times. They won their seventh title in 1905 after being third and second in 1903 and 1904 respectively. In 1906, George Hirst achieved a unique &quot;double-double&quot; by scoring 2,385 runs and taking 208 wickets. The 1906 championship was decided on the last day of the season. Yorkshire lost to Gloucestershire by a single run and were overtaken by Kent, who won their last match against Hampshire by an innings. Having finished third in 1907, Yorkshire went through the 1908 season unbeaten and bowled Northamptonshire out for 27 and 15, the aggregate score of 42 being the lowest in English first-class cricket. Yorkshire finished third in 1909 but then dropped to eighth and seventh in the next two seasons before a recovery in 1912 brought their last title before the First World War. While Hirst, Rhodes and Denton continued to excel, Yorkshire gained much in the last four years before the war from two new all-rounders, Major Booth and Alonzo Drake, both of whom were an outstanding success. Another newcomer was Arthur Dolphin, who replaced the retired David Hunter as first-choice wicketkeeper. In 1913 and the unfinished 1914 season, Yorkshire finished second and fourth. Lord Hawke played only a few matches in 1909 and formally resigned as captain in 1910. He was succeeded by Everard Radcliffe, who held the post until the end of the 1911 season; and then by Sir Archibald White, who led the team until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.

===1919–1945===
Yorkshire won the first post-war Championship in 1919, a year which saw the debuts of Herbert Sutcliffe and Emmott Robinson, and remained a dominant force in the County Championship until the Second World War. They won every year from 1922 to 1925 and seven more times in the 1930s. The team won 25 games in 1923, for instance, with Rhodes and Roy Kilner doing the double in these matches alone, while four other batsmen scored 1,000 runs and three other bowlers, including George Macaulay, took 100 wickets.

Yorkshire&#x27;s quintessential rivalry is with Lancashire via the Roses Match. The importance of this match reached a peak during the inter-war period when, for many years, Yorkshire and Lancashire were the dominant teams in English cricket. The writings of Neville Cardus at this time were instrumental in emphasising the sense of rivalry between the two teams.

Wilfred Rhodes retired in 1930, taking 73 wickets and scoring 478 runs in his final season at the age of 53. J. M. Kilburn wrote in the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot;: &quot;He had bowled at W. G. Grace, and he bowled at Don Bradman. At 20, at 30, at 40 and at 50 he had shown himself master of his world, and his kingdom was never usurped&quot;. Rhodes was succeeded by Hedley Verity, another skilful slow left armer. In 1932, Verity performed the greatest bowling feat in first-class cricket – ten wickets for ten runs against Nottinghamshire at Headingley. Percy Holmes and Sutcliffe had a record opening stand of 555 against Essex at Leyton in 1932. Len Hutton began his career in the 1930s.

===1946–1970===
Large crowds flocked to the cricket after the Second World War with 47,000 people attending the 3 days of the Roses Match at Bramall Lane in 1946. Yorkshire won the first post-war Championship. New players after the war included spinner Johnny Wardle, all-rounder Brian Close and fast bowler Fred Trueman. Another newcomer Bob Appleyard became the first bowler to take 200 wickets in his first full season in 1951. The 1950s were dominated by Surrey, who won seven successive championships. Yorkshire had internal problems which were resolved before the 1959 season in which Yorkshire recovered the title under Ronnie Burnet.

The 1960s saw a new Yorkshire team emerge that dominated English cricket. Brian Close was made captain in 1963 and won the Championship in his first season. The team included Fred Trueman, all-rounder Ray Illingworth, wicket-keeper Jimmy Binks and Test batsmen Geoffrey Boycott, Doug Padgett, Phil Sharpe and John Hampshire. The team began to break up after winning a third successive title in 1968 and Close was controversially sacked in 1970.

===1971–2000===
There followed a long-running current of unrest in the club. There was sadness too in 1973 when Bramall Lane, the club&#x27;s first ever home, was finally closed to cricket after over 400 first-class matches and was converted into a specialist football stadium.

Geoff Boycott captained Yorkshire for most of the 1970s, but competitive success eluded the team even when Boycott left Test cricket for three years to concentrate on the county game. He was sacked as captain amid much internal furore after the 1978 season. Ray Illingworth returned from Leicestershire as team manager and, in 1982 at the age of 50, took over the captaincy. Yorkshire finished bottom of the 17-strong County Championship for the first time in 1983 but won the John Player (later National) League for the first time. There was further controversy when Boycott was not offered a new contract. The outcome of this was that the general committee resigned and Boycott, having already been elected to the new committee, was reinstated as a player. Meanwhile, Brian Close became chairman of the cricket committee. Success continued to elude Yorkshire although Phil Carrick led the team to a Benson and Hedges Cup triumph in 1987.

Yorkshire put themselves at a self-evident disadvantage from 1968 until 1992 by insisting that all its players must have been born within the historic county boundaries of Yorkshire, while all the other county teams strengthened themselves by signing overseas Test players. In 1992, the birth qualification rule was first modified to include those who had been educated within the county, a dispensation that allowed Michael Vaughan to play; and was then eventually abandoned altogether. Yorkshire&#x27;s first ever overseas player that season was 19-year-old Sachin Tendulkar.

===2001 to present===
Yorkshire finally won the County Championship again in 2001 when the captain was David Byas. Yorkshire had mixed success in the first decade of the 21st century but finished a close third in the 2010 championship under Andrew Gale.

There had for many years been a controversial issue about the apparent inability of players from Yorkshire&#x27;s large ethnic minority population to make their way at the club. Tendulkar was the first Asian player to represent Yorkshire, but he was an overseas player. It was not until 2003 that Dewsbury&#x27;s Ismail Dawood became the first British-born Asian to play for Yorkshire. He was followed by Ajmal Shahzad and Adil Rashid who have both represented England. In 2007, Azeem Rafiq as a member of Yorkshire&#x27;s academy team became the first player of an Asian background to captain England at any level when he was appointed U-15 captain. In the summer of 2012, Rafiq stepped in for the injured Andrew Gale to captain the team in six T20 matches, becoming the first player of Asian origin to lead the county, as well as the youngest captain in the club&#x27;s history.

The club were relegated at the end of a disappointing 2011 season, leading to major restructuring in the coaching staff, with former Yorkshire and Australia player Jason Gillespie brought in as coach. After swiftly regaining promotion, Gillespie set about revamping the team who made a strong title challenge in 2013, eventually finishing runners-up. Yorkshire improved on that by winning the title in both 2014 and 2015, which was their last to date.

===Accusations of institutional racism===

In 2020, Yorkshire were accused of institutional racism by former player Azeem Rafiq. In 2021, the ECB suspended Yorkshire from holding Test matches because their handling of the issue was causing reputational damage to the sport, while former Yorkshire captain Gary Ballance, who admitted using racist language, was indefinitely suspended from national selection. The ECB wrote in a statement that there were problems with the governance and management of the club.

==Badge and colours==
Lord Hawke, in the early days of his captaincy, designed the white rose badge. Copying the idea from Lancashire, who already had adopted the red rose as a symbol, Hawke designed a rose which, unlike Lancashire&#x27;s, was not a real flower. He created a rose with eleven petals, to represent the eleven players of the team, based on the hedge rose. Only players who had received their county cap were allowed to wear the badge. It was not until the 1980s that the committee allowed the design to be placed on merchandise as a marketing device. Yorkshire&#x27;s club colours are dark blue, light blue and gold; these are knitted in bands forming the v-neck of each player&#x27;s sweater.

==Ground history==
As with all county cricket clubs, Yorkshire represents the historic county and not any modern or current administrative unit. In Yorkshire&#x27;s case, this means the three ridings and the City of York, although the club played some home matches outside the historic borders at Sheffield&#x27;s Abbeydale Park, which was historically part of Derbyshire, from 1974 to 1996.

The club was founded on 8 January 1863 in the Adelphi Hotel, Sheffield and was initially based at Bramall Lane. Yorkshire first played at North Marine Road, Scarborough in the 1878 season. This remains the venue for the annual Scarborough Festival matches. Headingley was first established in 1888 and Test cricket was first played there in 1899, eight years later than it hosted its inaugural first-class match when Yorkshire played Kent in 1891, the year in which the club&#x27;s headquarters moved there. The &quot;out grounds&quot; in Hull, Sheffield, Bradford, Middlesbrough and Harrogate were used with great success until the 1970s.
On 31 December 2005, Yorkshire purchased the Headingley cricket ground for £12 million from the &quot;Leeds Cricket, Football and Athletic Company&quot;, parent company of the Leeds rugby league club, with the help of a £9 million loan from Leeds City Council. This purchase ensures that Test cricket continues at the venue with a 15-year staging agreement. On 11 January 2006, the stadium was officially renamed the Headingley Carnegie Stadium as a result of sponsorship from Leeds Metropolitan University and the club announced plans on 11 January 2006 to rebuild the stand next to the rugby ground with 3,000 extra seats, taking capacity to 20,000. The club also announced plans to redevelop the Winter shed (North) stand on 25 August 2006 providing a £12.5 million pavilion complex.

==Sponsorship==
The club was founded in 1863 to be owned by its members who have elected various officials including the club&#x27;s general committee, which existed until 2002 when it was replaced by a board of management headed by a chief executive. The office of club President still exists (see list below) and (in 2017) there are seven board members including the chief executive and the director of cricket. In addition to the board members, there are a director of finance and a human resources manager who is also personal assistant (PA) to both the board and chief executive. Among other roles are coaching, groundstaff, physiotherapy, operations, marketing, retail and community development. The once-influential post of club Secretary effectively ceased in 2002 although the club did have a company secretary for three years. That function has now disappeared under the broader structure and the present secretary as such is the finance director. Like all county clubs, Yorkshire relies heavily on sponsorship and numerous companies have formed deals with the club over many years. Current partners and sponsors can be found on the club website.

===Club captains===
Four Yorkshire players – Stanley Jackson, Len Hutton, Ray Illingworth and Michael Vaughan – have captained England to success in The Ashes yet none of them was club captain at the time (Ray Illingworth had just left Yorkshire for Leicestershire when he became captain of England; he later returned to Yorkshire).

From 1883 to 1959 inclusive, Yorkshire always had an amateur club captain. The extent of leadership given by these gentlemen has long been a subject of discussion. Hawke and Sellers are generally held to have been autocratic and decisive, but in fact both relied heavily on sound professional advice. At the other extreme, Wilfred Rhodes is supposed to have been the &quot;de facto&quot; captain from 1920 to 1930, but it was Major Arthur Lupton who restored discipline to the side when a row erupted between Yorkshire and Middlesex in 1924.

Lord Hawke famously said at the Yorkshire Annual General Meeting in 1925: &quot;Pray God, no professional shall ever captain England. I love and admire them all, but we have always had an amateur skipper and when the day comes when we shall have no more amateurs captaining England it will be a thousand pities.&quot; In view of this, it is perhaps surprising that, when Arthur Lupton retired at the end of the 1927 season, Hawke was one of the sponsors of the suggestion that Herbert Sutcliffe should become Yorkshire captain. In the event, there was sufficient opposition to the idea amongst the Yorkshire committee and players (some of the latter felt that Wilfred Rhodes, as senior professional, had a prior claim), that the proposal was dropped.

In 1960, Vic Wilson became Yorkshire&#x27;s first professional captain since Tom Emmett when he succeeded Ronnie Burnet. Brian Close, who took over in 1963, has been Yorkshire&#x27;s most successful professional captain with four County Championships.

<text>Antoine Busnois (also Busnoys; – before 6 November 1492) was a French composer, singer and poet of early Renaissance music. Busnois and colleague Johannes Ockeghem were the leading European composers of the second half the 15th century, and central figures of the early Franco-Flemish School.

While also noted as a composer of motets and other sacred music, he was one of the most renowned 15th-century composers of secular polyphonic chansons. Between Guillaume Du Fay and Claudin de Sermisy, Busnois was the most prolific and important French composer of songs.
==Life and career==
The details of Busnois&#x27;s early life are largely conjectural, and nothing is certain. He was probably from the vicinity of Béthune in the Pas-de-Calais, possibly the hamlet of Busnes, to which his name seems to refer. He may have been related to the aristocratic family of Busnes; in particular, a Philippe de Busnes, canon of Notre-Dame in Lens, could have been a relative. He clearly received an excellent musical education, probably at a church choir school somewhere in northern or central France. An aristocratic origin may explain his early association with the French royal court: as early as the 1450s references to him appear there, and in 1461 he was a chaplain at Tours. That he was not entirely a man of peace is indicated by a petition for absolution he filed in Tours, dated 28 February 1461, in which he admitted to being part of a group that beat up a priest &quot;to the point of bloodshed&quot;, not once but five times. While in a state of anathema he was foolhardy enough to celebrate Mass although he was not an ordained priest, an act which got him excommunicated until Pope Pius II pardoned him.

He moved from the cathedral to the collegiate church of St. Martin, also in Tours, where he became a subdeacon in 1465. Johannes Ockeghem was treasurer at that institution, and the two composers seem to have known each other well. Later in 1465 Busnois moved to Poitiers, where he not only became master of the choirboys but managed to attract a flood of talented singers from the entire region; by this time his reputation as singing teacher, scholar and composer seems to have spread widely. But he departed in 1466 just as suddenly as he came for no known reason, and the former master was given his old job back. He then moved to Burgundy.

Busnois was at the Burgundian court by 1467. His first compositions there appeared immediately before the accession of Charles as Duke on 15 June, since one of his motets — &quot;In hydraulis&quot; — contains a dedication to Charles calling him Count. On becoming Duke of Burgundy, he quickly became known as Charles the Bold for his fierce and sometimes reckless military adventurism (which indeed led to his death in battle ten years later). But Charles loved not only war but also music, appreciating and rewarding Busnois for works composed while in his service. Busnois was listed along with Hayne van Ghizeghem and Adrien Basin as &quot;chantre et valet de chambre&quot; to Charles in 1467.

In addition to serving Charles as singer and composer, Busnois accompanied the Duke on his military campaigns, as did Hayne van Ghizeghem. Busnois was at the siege of Neuss in Germany in 1475, and survived (or missed) the disastrous Battle of Nancy in 1477 at which Charles was killed and Burgundian expansion was ended forthwith and forever.

Busnois remained in the employ of the Burgundian court until 1482, but nothing exact is known about his exploits between then and the year of his death. At the time of his death, in 1492, he was employed by the church of St. Sauveur in Bruges.

==Music==
Busnois&#x27; contemporary reputation was immense; he was probably the best-known musician in Europe between Guillaume Dufay and Johannes Ockeghem. He wrote sacred and secular music. Of the former, two cantus firmus Masses and eight motets have survived, while many others were most likely lost. He set the Marian antiphon &quot;Regina coeli&quot; several times. Stylistically, his music can be considered a midpoint between the simplicity and homophonic textures of Dufay and Binchois, and the soon-to-be pervasive imitative counterpoint of Josquin and Gombert. He used imitation only occasionally but skillfully, created smooth and singable melodic lines and had a strong feeling for triadic sonorities, anticipating 16th-century practice.

According to Pietro Aron, Busnois may have been the composer of the famous tune &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot;, one of the most widely distributed melodies of the Renaissance and the one more often used than any other as a cantus firmus in Mass composition. Whether or not he wrote the first Mass based on &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot;, his was by far the most influential; Obrecht&#x27;s setting, for example, closely parallels that of Busnois, and even Dufay&#x27;s quotes from it directly. Richard Taruskin attempts to prove that Busnois&#x27; was the model later &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot; masses were based upon through a study of the composer&#x27;s numerological symbology within the work, and by demonstrating that Dufay and others were emulating (or paying homage) to this aspect, among others. David Fallows points out that the complexity of the Busnois mass may indicate that he was actually borrowing from Dufay. Busnois may even be the composer of a cycle of &quot;six&quot; Masses all based on the same tune, found in Naples, on the basis of stylistic comparison.

But Busnois&#x27; polyphonic chansons (French secular songs) are the works on which his reputation mainly rests. Most are rondeaux, but some are bergerettes; many of them achieved the status of popular songs, and some were perhaps based on other popular songs which are now lost. He probably wrote the words for almost all of his chansons. Some of his tunes were recycled as cantus firmus for Masses composed more than a generation after his death, for instance &quot;Fortuna desperata&quot; (which was used both by Obrecht and Josquin), though this attribution is controversial. An unusual chanson is &quot;Terrible dame&quot;, which is not only an antiphonal dialogue (unique in the chanson literature) but has an Old French title requiring no special skill to translate.

While most of Busnois&#x27;s secular songs are set to French words, at least two employ Italian texts and one is in Flemish. Most are for three voices, although there are a few for four.

<text>Barry Van Dyke (born July 31, 1951) is an American actor. He is the second son of actor and entertainer Dick Van Dyke and Margie Willett, and the nephew of Jerry Van Dyke. He has often worked with his father. He is best known to audiences as Lieutenant Detective Steve Sloan, a homicide detective and the son of Dr. Mark Sloan (played by Dick Van Dyke) on &quot;&quot;. In the show, the characters&#x27; relatives were frequently played by real-life family members.

==Biography==
Barry Van Dyke was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Dick Van Dyke and his first wife, Margie Willett (1926–2008).

Van Dyke&#x27;s television debut was as Florian, a violin-toting nine-year-old in &quot;The Talented Neighborhood&quot; episode of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; alongside big brother Christian. However, his father advised him to wait before pursuing a show business career. Van Dyke later told a reporter, &quot;He wanted me to have my childhood. He told me that if I still wanted to act after I graduated high school, then it would be OK.&quot;

Later, he worked as a gofer on his father&#x27;s television series, &quot;The New Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, which debuted in 1971 and aired until 1974. While working on that show, he secured a part as an extra.

He worked with his father again in the short-lived series &quot;The Van Dyke Show&quot; (which was canceled after six episodes in 1988) and then the long-running series &quot;&quot;, which aired from 1993 to 2001. In both series, he had major roles. He also wrote and directed several episodes of &quot;Diagnosis: Murder&quot;. After &quot;Diagnosis: Murder&quot; ended, Barry appeared in the &quot;Murder 101&quot; television films, again alongside his father.

Barry Van Dyke also appeared in many other television shows over the course of his long career. His other television work includes a starring role in &quot;Galactica 1980&quot; as Lieutenant Dillon, and appearances in &quot;Remington Steele&quot;; &quot;The Love Boat&quot;; &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;; &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;; as Ace Combat Pilot and former M.I.A. soldier St. John Hawke in the final season of &quot;Airwolf&quot;; &quot;The A-Team&quot;; &quot;Gun Shy&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;; and &quot;The Redd Foxx Show&quot;.

==Marriage and children==
In 1974, he married Mary Carey; the couple have four children: Carey (born February 25, 1976), Shane (born August 28, 1979), Wes (born October 22, 1984), and Taryn (born June 1, 1986).

<doc id="869961" wikidata="Q787386" url="?curid=869961" title="Semi-automatic transmission">
<text>A semi-automatic transmission is a multiple-speed transmission where part of its operation is automated (typically the actuation of the clutch), but the driver&#x27;s input is still required to launch the vehicle from a standstill and to manually change gears. Semi-automatic transmissions were almost exclusively used in motorcycles and are based on conventional manual transmissions or sequential manual transmissions, but use an automatic clutch system. But some semi-automatic transmissions have also been based on standard hydraulic automatic transmissions with torque converters and planetary gearsets.

Names for specific types of semi-automatic transmissions include &quot;clutchless manual&quot;, &quot;auto-manual&quot;, &quot;auto-clutch manual&quot;, and &quot;paddle-shift&quot; transmissions. These systems facilitate gear shifts for the driver by operating the clutch system automatically, usually via switches that trigger an actuator or servo, while still requiring the driver to manually shift gears. This contrasts with a preselector gearbox, in which the driver selects the next gear ratio and operates the pedal, but the gear change within the transmission is performed automatically.

The first usage of semi-automatic transmissions was in automobiles, increasing in popularity in the mid-1930s when they were offered by several American car manufacturers. Less common than traditional hydraulic automatic transmissions, semi-automatic transmissions have nonetheless been made available on various car and motorcycle models and have remained in production throughout the 21st century. Semi-automatic transmissions with paddle shift operation have been used in various racing cars, and were first introduced to control the electro-hydraulic gear shift mechanism of the Ferrari 640 Formula One car in 1989. These systems are currently used on a variety of top-tier racing car classes; including Formula One, IndyCar, and touring car racing. Other applications include motorcycles, trucks, buses, and railway vehicles.

== Design and operation ==
Semi-automatics facilitate easier gear shifts by removing the need to depress a clutch pedal or lever at the same time as changing gears. Most cars that have a semi-automatic transmission are not fitted with a standard clutch pedal since the clutch is remotely controlled. Similarly, most motorcycles with a semi-automatic transmission are not fitted with a conventional clutch lever on the handlebar.

=== Clutchless manual transmissions ===
Most semi-automatic transmissions are based on conventional manual transmission. They can be partially automated transmission. Once the clutch becomes automated, the transmission becomes semi-automatic. However, these systems still require manual gear selection by the driver. This type of transmission is called a &quot;clutchless manual&quot; or an &quot;automated manual&quot;.

Most semi-automatic transmissions in older passenger cars retain the normal H-pattern shifter of a manual transmission; similarly, semi-automatic transmissions on older motorcycles retain the conventional foot-shift lever, as on a motorcycle with a fully manual transmission. However, semi-automatics systems in newer motorcycles, racing cars, and other types of vehicles often use gear selection methods such as shift paddles near the steering wheel or triggers near the handlebars.

Several different forms of automation for clutch actuation have been used over the years, from hydraulic, pneumatic, and electromechanical clutches to vacuum-operated, electromagnetic, and even centrifugal clutches. Fluid couplings (most commonly and formerly used in early automatic transmissions) have also been used by various manufacturers, usually alongside some form of mechanical friction clutch, to prevent the vehicle from stalling when coming to a standstill or at idle.

A typical semi-automatic transmission design may work by using Hall effect sensors or micro switches to detect the direction of the requested shift when the gear stick is used. These sensors&#x27; output, combined with the output from a sensor connected to the gearbox which measures its current speed and gear, is fed into a transmission control unit, electronic control unit, engine control unit, or microprocessor, or another type of electronic control system. This control system then determines the optimal timing and torque required for smooth clutch engagement.

The electronic control unit powers an actuator, which engages and disengages the clutch in a smooth manner. In some cases, the clutch is actuated by a servomotor coupled to a gear arrangement for a linear actuator, which, via a hydraulic cylinder filled with hydraulic fluid from the braking system, disengages the clutch. In other cases, the internal clutch actuator may be completely electric, where the main clutch actuator is powered by an electric motor or solenoid, or even pneumatic, where the main clutch actuator is a pneumatic actuator that disengages the clutch.

A clutchless manual system, named the &quot;Autostick&quot;, was a semi-automatic transmission introduced by Volkswagen for the 1968 model year. Marketed as the &quot;Volkswagen Automatic Stickshift&quot;, a conventional three-speed manual transmission was connected to a vacuum-operated automatic clutch system. The top of the gear stick was designed to depress and activate an electric switch, i.e. when touched by the driver&#x27;s hand. When pressed, the switch operated a 12-volt solenoid, which in turn operated the vacuum clutch actuator, thus disengaging the clutch and allowing shifting between gears. With the driver&#x27;s hand removed from the gearshift, the clutch would re-engage automatically. The transmission was also equipped with a torque converter, allowing the car to idle in gear like with an automatic, as well as stop and start from a standstill in any gear.

=== Automated manual transmissions ===
Starting in the late 1990s, automotive manufacturers introduced what is now called an automated manual transmission (AMT), which is mechanically similar to, and has its roots in, earlier clutchless manual transmission systems. An AMT functions in the same way as older semi-automatic and clutchless manual transmissions, but with two exceptions; it is able to both operate the clutch and shift automatically, and does not use a torque converter. Shifting is done either automatically from a transmission control unit (TCU), or manually from either the shift knob or shift paddles mounted behind the steering wheel. AMTs combine the fuel efficiency of manual transmissions with the shifting ease of automatic transmissions. Their biggest disadvantage is poor shifting comfort due to the mechanical clutch being disengaged by the TCU, which is easily noticeable as &quot;jolting&quot;. Some transmission makers have tried solving this issue by using oversized synchronizer rings and not fully opening the clutch during shifting—which works in theory, but as of 2007, there have not been any series production cars with such functions. In passenger cars, modern AMTs generally have six speeds (though some have seven) and a rather long gearing. In combination with a smart-shifting program, this can significantly reduce fuel consumption. In general, there are two types of AMTs: integrated AMTs and add-on AMTs. Integrated AMTs were designed to be dedicated AMTs, whereas add-on AMTs are conversions of standard manual transmissions into AMTs.

An automated manual transmission may include a fully automatic mode where the driver does not need to change gears at all. These transmissions can be described as a standard manual transmission with an automated clutch and automated gear shift control, allowing them to operate in the same manner as traditional automatic transmissions. The TCU automatically shifts gears if, for example, the engine is redlined. The AMT can be switched to a clutchless manual mode wherein one can upshift or downshift using a console-mounted shift selector or paddle shifters. It has a lower cost than conventional automatic transmissions.

The automated manual transmission (trade names include &quot;SMG-III&quot;) is not to be confused with &quot;manumatic&quot; automatic transmission (marketed under trade names such as &quot;Tiptronic&quot;, &quot;Steptronic&quot;, &quot;Sportmatic&quot;, and &quot;Geartronic&quot;). While these systems seem superficially similar, a manumatic uses a torque converter like an automatic transmission, instead of the clutch used in the automated manual transmission. An automated manual can give the driver full control of the gear selection, whereas a manumatic will deny a gear change request that would result in the engine stalling (from too few RPM) or over-revving. The automatic mode of an automated manual transmission at low or frequent stop start speeds is less smooth than that of manumatics and other automatic transmissions.

=== Sequential manual transmissions ===
Several semi-automatic transmissions used by motorcycles and racing cars are actually mechanically based on sequential manual transmissions. Semi-automatic motorcycle transmissions generally omit the clutch lever, but retain the conventional heel-and-toe foot shift lever.

Semi-automatic motorcycle transmissions are based on conventional sequential manual transmissions and typically use a centrifugal clutch. At idle speed, the engine is disconnected from the gearbox input shaft, allowing both it and the bike to freewheel, unlike with torque converter automatics, there is no idle creep with a properly adjusted centrifugal clutch. As the engine speed rises, counterweights within the clutch assembly gradually pivot further outwards until they start to make contact with the inside of the outer housing and transmit an increasing amount of engine power and torque. The effective &quot;bite point&quot; or &quot;biting point&quot; is found automatically by equilibrium, where the power is transmitted through the (still-slipping) clutch is equal to what the engine can provide. This allows relatively fast full-throttle takeoffs (with the clutch adjusted so the engine is at peak torque) without the engine slowing or being bogged down, as well as more relaxed starts and low-speed maneuvers at lower throttle and RPMs.

In 1901, Amédée Bollée developed a method of shifting gears that did not require the use of a clutch and was activated by a ring mounted within the steering wheel. One car using this system was the 1912 Bollée Type F Torpedo.

=== 1930s–1940s ===
Prior to the arrival of the first mass-produced hydraulic automatic transmission (the General Motors Hydra-Matic) in 1940, several American manufacturers offered various devices to reduce the amount of clutch or shifting input required. These devices were intended to reduce the difficulty of operating the unsynchronised manual transmissions, or &quot;crash gearboxes&quot;, that were commonly used, especially in stop-start driving.

An early step towards automated transmissions was the 1933–1935 REO Self-Shifter, which automatically shifted between two forward gears in the &quot;forward&quot; mode (or between two shorter gear ratios in the &quot;emergency low&quot; mode). Standing starts required the driver to use the clutch pedal. The Self-Shifter first appeared in May 1933 and was offered as standard on the Royale and as an option on the Flying Cloud S-4.

In 1937, the four-speed Oldsmobile Automatic Safety Transmission was introduced on the Oldsmobile Six and Oldsmobile Eight models. It used a planetary gearset with a clutch pedal for starting from a standstill and switching between the &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; ranges. The Automatic Safety Transmission was replaced by the fully-automatic Hydra-Matic for the 1940 model year.

The 1938–1939 Buick Special was available with another Self-Shifter 4-speed semi-automatic transmission, which used a manual clutch for starting from standstill and an automated clutch for gear changes.

The 1941 Chrysler M4 Vacamatic transmission was a two-speed manual transmission with an integral underdrive unit, a traditional manual clutch, and a fluid coupling between the engine and the clutch. The two-speed transmission had &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; ranges, and the clutch was used when the driver wanted to switch between ranges. For normal driving, the driver would press the clutch, select the High range, and then release the clutch. Once the accelerator was pressed, the fluid coupling would engage and the car would begin moving forward, with the underdrive unit engaged to provide a lower gear ratio. At between , the driver would lift off the accelerator and the underdrive unit would disengage. The Vacamatic was replaced by a similar M6 Presto-Matic transmission for the 1946 model year.

Similar designs were used for the 1941–1950 Hudson Drive-Master and the ill-fated 1942 Lincoln Liquimatic. Both of these combined a 3-speed manual transmission with automated shifting between the 2nd and 3rd gears, instead of the Vacamatic&#x27;s &quot;underdrive&quot; unit.

The Packard Electro-Matic, introduced in the 1941 Packard Clipper and Packard 180, was an early clutchless manual transmission that used a traditional friction clutch with automatic vacuum operation, which was controlled by the position of the accelerator.

=== 1950s–1960s ===
The Automotive Products manumatic system, available on the 1953 Ford Anglia 100E, was a vacuum-powered automatic clutch system that was actuated by a switch that was triggered whenever the gear stick was moved. The system could control the throttle cable (to keep the engine at the required RPM for the gear change) and vary the rate of clutch engagement. The successive Newtondrive system, available on the 1957–1958 Ford Anglia, also had a provision for choke control. A similar product was the German Saxomat automatic clutch system, which was introduced in the mid-1950s and available on various European cars.

The Citroën DS, introduced in 1955, used a hydraulic system with a hydraulically-operated speed controller and idle speed step-up device to select gears and operate the otherwise conventional clutch. This allowed clutchless shifting with a single column-mounted selector, while the driver simultaneously lifted off the accelerator to change gear. This system was nicknamed &quot;Citro-Matic&quot; in the U.S.

For the 1962 model year, American Motors introduced the E-Stick, which eliminated the clutch pedal in the Rambler American with standard three-speed manual transmissions. This automatic clutch used engine oil pressure as a hydraulic source and was available for less than $60. Compared to fully automatic transmissions of the time, the E-Stick offered the fuel economy of a stick-shift, with vacuum and electric switches controlling the clutch. The E-Stick three-speed transmission was offered on the larger Rambler Classic models, along with an overdrive unit. The system was only available with 6-cylinder engines, and the lack of a clutch proved unpopular, so it was discontinued after 1964.

The 1967 Volkswagen WSK (&quot;Wandlerschaltkupplungsgetriebe&quot;; English: &quot;Torque converter shift/clutch gearbox&quot;), used in the Beetle, Type 3 and Karmann Ghia, was one of the first gearboxes of its kind, with an automatic mechanical clutch and a torque converter. It was also known as the Autostick. Shifting was done manually by the driver. The automatic mechanical clutch allowed the car to accelerate from a stop, whereas the torque converter enabled it to do so in any gear. Dampening engine vibrations and providing torque multiplication, it functioned as a sort of &quot;reduction gearbox&quot;, so the actual mechanical gearbox only needed three forward gears (this is why conventional automatic transmissions with torque converters normally have fewer gears than manual transmissions). The WSK had no &quot;first&quot; gear; instead, the first gear was converted into reverse gear, and the second gear was labeled first (with the third and fourth gears respectively being labeled second and third).

The Chevrolet Torque-Drive transmission, introduced on the 1968 Chevrolet Nova and Camaro, is one of a few examples where a semi-automatic transmission was based on a conventional hydraulic automatic transmission (rather than a standard manual transmission). The Torque-Drive was essentially a 2-speed Powerglide automatic transmission without the vacuum modulator, requiring the driver to manually shift gears between &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High&quot;. The quadrant indicator on Torque-Drive cars was &quot;Park-R-N-Hi-1st&quot;. The driver would start the car in &quot;1st,&quot; then move the lever to &quot;Hi&quot; when desired. The Torque-Drive was discontinued at the end of 1971 and replaced by a traditional hydraulic automatic transmission. Other examples of semi-automatic transmissions based on hydraulic automatics were the Ford 3-speed Semi-Automatic Transmission used in the 1970–1971 Ford Maverick, early versions of Honda&#x27;s 1972–1988 Hondamatic 2-speed and 3-speed transmissions, and the Daihatsu Diamatic 2-speed transmission used in the 1985–1991 Daihatsu Charade.

=== Other examples ===

== Usage in motorcycles ==
An early example of a semi-automatic motorcycle transmission was the use of an automatic centrifugal clutch in the early 1960s by the Czechoslovakian manufacturer Jawa Moto. Their design was used without permission in the 1965 Honda Cub 50, which resulted in Jawa suing Honda for patent infringement and Honda agreeing to pay royalties for each motorcycle using the design.

Other semi-automatic transmissions used in motorcycles include:
* Honda&#x27;s Hondamatic two-speed transmission fitted with a torque converter (which shares its name with several fully-automatic transmissions), as used in its 1976 CB750A, 1977 CB400A Hawk, 1978 CM400A and 1982 CM450A.
* Those in various minibikes, including the Amstar Nostalgia 49, Honda CRF50F, Z series, and ST series, Kawasaki KLX-110, KLX-110R, and KSR110, KTM 65 SX, Suzuki DR-Z50, DR-Z70, and DR-Z125, SSR SR110TR, and Yamaha TT-R50E.
* Yamaha used an automatic clutch system called YCCS on motorcycles such as the 2006 Yamaha FJR1300AE sports-touring. This system can be shifted either with the lever in the traditional position near the left foot or with a switch accessible to the left hand where the clutch lever would go on traditional motorcycles.
* The Can-Am Spyder Roadster&#x27;s SE5 and SE6 5-speed and 6-speed transmissions.
* Those in several underbone motorcycles in the 1970s; the Suzuki FR50, Suzuki FR80, and Yamaha Townmate used 3-speed transmissions with a heel-and-toe gear shift.
* Some high-performance sport bikes use a trigger-shift system, with a handlebar-mounted trigger, paddle, switch, or button, and an automatically operated clutch.
* Some dirt bikes use this system, which is sometimes referred to as an auto-clutch transmission. These include the Honda CRF110F and Yamaha TT-R110E. The conventional motorcycle foot shifter is retained, but the manual hand-clutch lever is no longer required. Semi-automatic transmissions in dirt bikes may be referred to as &quot;automatic&quot; despite a lack of automatic shifting.

== Usage in motorsports ==
Semi-automatic transmissions in racing cars are typically operated by shift paddles connected to a designated transmission control unit.

The first Formula One car to use a semi-automatic transmission was the 1989 Ferrari 640. It used hydraulic actuators and electrical solenoids for clutch control and shifting, and was shifted via two paddles mounted behind the steering wheel. Another paddle on the steering wheel controlled the clutch, which was only needed when starting from a standstill. The car won its debut race at the Brazilian Grand Prix, but for much of the season suffered from reliability problems. Other teams began switching to similar semi-automatic transmissions; the 1991 Williams FW14 was the first to use a sequential drum-rotation mechanism (similar to those used in motorcycle transmissions), which allowed for a more compact design that required only one actuator to rotate the drum and change gears. A further development was made possible by the introduction of electronic throttle control soon after, which made it possible for the car to automatically rev-match during downshifts. By 1993, most teams were using semi-automatic transmissions. The last F1 car fitted with a conventional manual gearbox, the Forti FG01, raced in 1995.

Following concerns about the potential for Formula One cars to shift gears automatically without any driver input, mandatory software was introduced in 1994 that ensured that gear changes only occurred when instructed by the driver. Pre-programmed, computer-controlled, fully-automatic upshifts and downshifts were re-introduced and allowed from 2001, and were permitted from that year&#x27;s Spanish Grand Prix, but were banned again in 2004. Buttons on the steering wheel to shift directly to a particular gear (instead of having to shift sequentially using the paddles) are permitted. The 2005 Minardi PS05, Renault R25, and Williams FW27 were the last Formula 1 cars to use a 6-speed gearbox before the switch to a mandatory 7-speed gearbox for the 2006 season. Since 2014 season, Formula 1 cars currently use mandatory 8-speed paddle-shift gearboxes.

The now-defunct CART Champ Car Series switched from a lever-shift sequential system to a 7-speed paddle-shift system for the 2007 season. This transmission was introduced with the new-for-2007 Panoz DP01 chassis.

The rival IndyCar Series introduced their 6-speed semi-automatic paddle-shift system for the 2008 season, also replacing the previous lever-shifted sequential transmission, introduced with the Dallara IR-05 chassis for 2008. IndyCars currently use the Xtrac P1011 sequential transmission, which uses a semi-automatic paddle shift system supplied by Mega-Line called AGS (Assisted Gearshift System). AGS uses a pneumatic gearshift and clutch actuator controlled by an internal transmission control unit.

Both the FIA Formula 2 and Formula 3 Championships currently use 6-speed sequential gearboxes with electro-hydraulic operation via shift paddles. Manual control of the multi-plate clutch systems via a lever behind the steering wheel is used to launch the cars.

DTM currently uses a Hewland DTT-200 6-speed sequential transmission with steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles, which was introduced for the 2012 season with the new rule change. This new system replaced the older lever-shifted sequential transmission, which had been used for the previous 12 seasons (since 2000).

== Usage in other vehicles ==

Other notable uses for semi-automatic transmissions include:
* During the 1940s to 1960s, many small diesel shunting locomotives used epicyclic semi-automatic transmissions. For example, the British Rail Class 03 and British Rail Class 04 used the Wilson-Drewry CA5 R7 transmission.
* The Sinclair S.S.S. Powerflow, used from the 1950s to the early 1960s in Huwood-Hudswell diesel mining locomotives, the British Rail Class D2/7 and the British Rail Class D2/12. The Powerflow design is of the layshaft type with constant-mesh gears and dog clutch engagement, allowing it to provide seamless power delivery during upshifts. This transmission was also used in some road vehicles.
* The Self-Changing Gears Pneumocyclic, an epicyclic transmission built in the United Kingdom from the 1960s to the 1980s. Using a similar design to the company&#x27;s previous preselector gearboxes, the Pneumocyclic transmission was used in several buses, such as the Leyland Leopard, Panther, and Tiger. It was also fitted to several thousand British diesel railcars during this time.
* All-terrain vehicles, such as the Honda ATC185, Honda ATC200, Honda TRX90X and TRX250X (Honda SportClutch), Suzuki LT125D Quadrunner (also known as the Suzuki QuadRunner 125), Suzuki LT 230, Suzuki Eiger 400, Yamaha Big Bear 250, 350, and 400, Yamaha Grizzly 80, Yamaha Grizzly 700, Yamaha Raptor 80, Yamaha YFB250 Timberwolf, the Yamaha Moto-4 ATV range, and the Yamaha Tri-Moto range.
**The Honda Electric Shift Program is used in ATVs such as the 1998 Honda TRX450FE (also called the Foreman 450ES ESP) and first-generation Honda Rincon. Shifting is accomplished by pressing one of the two gear selector arrows on the left handlebar, which activates an electric shifting system.

<text>Jaime Humberto Hermosillo Delgado (22 January 1942 – 13 January 2020) was a Mexican film director, often compared to Spain&#x27;s Pedro Almodóvar.

Born in Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes, in central Mexico, Hermosillo&#x27;s films often explore the hypocrisy of middle-class Mexican values.

He worked with Gabriel García Márquez on &quot;Mary My Dearest&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Summer of Miss Forbes&quot; (1988). His film &quot;Homework&quot; (1991) was entered into the 17th Moscow International Film Festival where it won a Special Mention.

At the time of his death Hermosillo was teaching film-making at the University of Guadalajara and had recently collaborated with his students on several projects.

On 13 January 2020, Hermosillo died at the age of 77.

<doc id="869971" wikidata="Q583705" url="?curid=869971" title="La Celestina">
<text>The Tragicomedy of Calisto and Melibea (), known in Spain as La Celestina, is a work entirely in dialogue published in 1499. Sometimes called in English The Spanish Bawd, it is attributed to Fernando de Rojas, a descendant of converted Jews, who practiced law and, later in life, served as an alderman of Talavera de la Reina, an important commercial center near Toledo.

The book is considered to be one of the greatest works of all Spanish literature and is even the single topic of a Spanish literary journal, &quot;Celestinesca&quot;. &quot;La Celestina&quot; is usually regarded as marking the end of the medieval period and the beginning of the renaissance in Spanish literature. Although usually regarded as a novel, it is written as a continuous series of dialogues and can be taken as a play, having been staged as such and filmed.

The story tells of a bachelor, Calisto, who uses the old procuress and bawd Celestina to start an affair with Melibea, an unmarried girl kept in seclusion by her parents. Though the two use the rhetoric of courtly love, sex — not marriage — is their aim. When he dies in an accident, she commits suicide. The name Celestina has become synonymous with &quot;procuress&quot; in Spanish, especially an older woman used to further an illicit affair, and is a literary archetype of this character, the masculine counterpart being Pandarus.

==Plot summary==
While chasing his falcon through the fields, a rich young bachelor named Calisto enters a garden where he meets Melibea, the daughter of the house, and is immediately taken with her. Unable to see her again privately, he broods until his servant Sempronio suggests using the old procuress Celestina. She is the owner of a brothel and in charge of her two young employees, Elicia and Areúsa.

When Calisto agrees, Sempronio plots with Celestina to make as much money out of his master as they can. Another servant of Calisto&#x27;s, Pármeno, mistrusts Celestina because he used to work for her when he was a child. Pármeno warns his master not to use her. However Celestina convinces Pármeno to join her and Sempronio in taking advantage of Calisto. His reward is Areúsa.

As a seller of feminine knick-knacks and quack medicines, Celestina is permitted entrance into the home of Alisa and Melibea by pretending to sell thread. Upon being left alone with Melibea, Celestina tells her of a man in pain who could be cured by the touch of her girdle. When she mentions Calisto&#x27;s name, Melibea becomes angry and tells her to go. But the crafty Celestina persuades her that Calisto has a horrible toothache that requires her aid, and manages to get the girdle off her and to fix another meeting.

On her second visit, Celestina persuades the now willing Melibea to a rendezvous with Calisto. Upon hearing of the meeting set by Celestina, Calisto rewards the procuress with a valuable gold chain. The lovers arrange to meet in Melibea&#x27;s garden the following night, while Sempronio and Pármeno keep watch.

When the weary Calisto returns home at dawn to sleep, his two servants go round to Celestina&#x27;s house to get their share of the gold. She tries to cheat them and in rage they kill her in front of Elicia. After jumping out of the window in an attempt to escape the Night Guard, Sempronio and Pármeno are caught and are beheaded later that day in the town square. Elicia, who knows what happened to Celestina, Sempronio, and Pármeno, tells Areúsa of the deaths. Areúsa and Elicia come up with a plan to punish Calisto and Melibea for being the cause of Celestina, Sempronio, and Pármeno&#x27;s downfall.

After a month of Calisto sneaking around and seeing Melibea at night in her garden, Areúsa and Elicia enact their plan of revenge. Calisto returns to the garden for another night with Melibea; while hastily leaving because of a ruckus he heard in the street, he falls from the ladder used to scale the high garden wall and dies. After confessing to her father the recent events of her love affair and Calisto&#x27;s death, Melibea jumps from the tower of the house and dies too.

==Historical and social context==
&quot;La Celestina&quot; was written during the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, whose marriage took place in 1469 and lasted until 1504, the year of Isabella&#x27;s death, which occupies the last phase of the Pre-Renaissance for Spain. Three major events in the history of Spain took place during the union of the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon in 1492. These events were the discovery of the Americas, the conquest of Granada and the expulsion of the Jews. It is also the year that Antonio de Nebrija published the first grammar of the Spanish language, together with Nebrija&#x27;s own teachings at the University of Salamanca, where Fernando de Rojas studied, favoring the emergence of Renaissance humanism in Spain. Thus, 1492 began the transition between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. It is precisely in the 1490s when the first editions of Comedy of Calisto and Melibea began to appear.

The unification of all the territories of the Iberian Peninsula, except Portugal and the Kingdom of Navarre, under one king and one religion, Catholic Christianity, took place in this period. Claudio Sánchez Albornoz highlighted the importance of being Christian in a society that has warned against members of other religions, such as Jews and Muslims, and even came to outright rejection. Society was suspicious of converts, such as Christians who had been Jews before or had Jewish ancestry, and those who had to hide their conditions. Finally, those of other religions were expelled from the kingdom and the Inquisition would enforce orthodoxy among those who professed the Catholic faith.

==Editions==
There are two versions of the play. One is called a &quot;Comedy&quot; and has 16 acts; the other is considered a &quot;Tragic Comedy&quot; and has 21 acts.

Although most scholars admit that an earlier version by an unknown author already existed, the first known edition is credited to be the &quot;Comedy&quot; published in Burgos by printer Fadrique de Basilea in 1499. The first page is missing and consequently there is no indication of title or author. It is preserved in the Hispanic Society of New York City. On the first page of the 1500 edition of Toledo, which is for the first time entitled &quot;Comedia de Calisto y Melibea&quot;, it states: &quot;nuevamente revista y enmendada con la adición de los argumentos de cada un auto en principio&quot; (&quot;newly reviewed and amended with the addition of the synopses of each act at its beginning&quot;), alluding to a princeps edition prior to 1499.

Some scholars wish to explain this discrepancy about the 1499 date, considering the version published in 1500 in Toledo to be the first edition; however, there is no positive proof of this, and there are some contradictions:
*1. Acrostic verses are not in themselves proof enough that the 16th century edition is the &quot;Prínceps Edition&quot;.
*2. If the 1499 version was published after the Toledo version, it should contain as stated, additional material, whereas some of the verses are actually omitted.
*3. The phrase &quot;fernando de royas acabo la comedia&quot; means that a previous version existed and that Fernando de Rojas completed it by adding additional material.

The Toledo 1500 edition contains 16 acts, and also some stanzas with acrostic verses such as &quot;el bachjller fernando de royas acabo la comedia de calysto y melybea y fve nascjdo en la puebla de montalvan&quot;, which means &quot;the graduate Fernando de Rojas finished the Comedy of Calisto and Melibea and was born in La Puebla de Montalbán.&quot; (This is the reason it is believed that Rojas was the original author of the play.)

A similar edition appeared with minor changes &quot;Comedia de Calisto y Melibea&quot;, Sevilla, 1501

A new edition entitled &quot;Tragicomedia de Calisto y Melibea&quot; (Tragic Comedy of Calisto and Melibea) (Seville: Jacobo Cromberger) appeared in 1502. This version contained 5 additional acts, bringing the total to 21.

Another edition with the title &quot;Tragicomedia de Calisto y Melibea&quot; (Tragic Comedy of Calisto and Melibea) (Valencia: ) appeared in 1514. This version contained those 5 additional acts, with the total of 21.

In 1526 a version was published in Toledo that included an extra act called the Acto de Traso, named after one of the characters who appears in that act. It became Act XIX of the work, bring the total number of acts to 22. According to the 1965 edition of the play edited by M. Criado de Val and G. D. Trotter, &quot;Its literary value does not have the intensity necessary to grant it a permanent place in the structure of the book, although various ancient editions of the play include it.&quot;

The first translation of the work into another language was that by Alfonso Ordoñez into Italian, appearing in 1506. An anonymous translation into French first appeared in 1527 and went through many editions. In 1631, an English translation by James Mabbe, a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, was published under the title &quot;The Spanish Bawd&quot;.

==Characters==
Rojas makes a powerful impression with his characters, who appear before the reader full of life and psychological depth; they are human beings with an exceptional indirect characterization, which moves away from the usual archetypes of medieval literature.

Some critics see them as allegories. The literary critic Stephen Gilman has come to deny the possibility of analyzing them as characters, based on the belief that Rojas limited dialogue in which interlocutors respond to a given situation, so that the sociological depth can thus be argued only on extratextual elements.

Lida de Malkiel, another critic, speaks of objectivity, whereby different characters are judged in different manners. Thus, the contradictory behavior of characters would be a result of Rojas humanizing his characters.

One common feature of all of the characters (in the world of nobles as well as servants) is their individualism, their egoism, and their lack of altruism. The theme of greed is explained by Francisco José Herrera in an article about envy in La Celestina and related literature (meaning imitations, continuations, etc.), where he explained the motive of the gossipers and servants to be &quot;greed and robbery&quot;, respectively, in the face of the motives of the nobles, which are raging lust and the defense of social and family honor. The private benefit of the lower-class characters forms a substitute for the love/lust present for the upper class.

Fernando de Rojas liked to create characters in pairs, to help build character development through relationships between complementary or opposing characters. In the play in general there are two opposite groups of characters, the servants and the nobles, and within each group are characters divided into pairs: Pármeno and Sempronio, Tristán and Sosia, Elicia and Areúsa, in the group of servants, and Calisto and Melibea, Pleberio and Alisa, in the group of nobles. Only Celestina and Lucrecia do not have a corresponding character, but this is because they perform opposite roles in the plot: Celestina is the element that catalyzes the tragedy, and represents a life lived with wild abandon, while Lucrecia, Melibea&#x27;s personal servant, represents the other extreme, total oppression. In this sense, the character of the rascal Centurio added in the second version is an addition with little function, although he has something to do with the disorder that calls the attention of Calisto and causes his death.

===Celestina===
Celestina is the most suggestive character in the work, to the point that she gives it its title. She is a colorful and vivid character, hedonistic, miserly, and yet full of life. She has such a deep understanding of the psychology of the other characters that she can convince even those who do not agree with her plans to accede to them. She uses people&#x27;s greed, sexual appetite (which she helps create, then provides means to satisfy), and love to control them. She also represents a subversive element in the society, by spreading and facilitating sexual pleasure. She stands apart for her use of magic. Her character is inspired by the meddling characters of the comedies of Plautus and in works of the Middle Ages such as the &quot;Libro de Buen Amor&quot; (The Book of Good Love) by Juan Ruiz and Italian works like &quot;The Tale of Two Lovers&quot; by Enea Silvio Piccolomini and &quot;Elegía de madonna Fiammeta&quot; by Giovanni Boccaccio. She was once a prostitute, and now she dedicates her time to arranging discreet meetings between illicit lovers, and at the same time uses her house as a brothel for the prostitutes Elicia and Areusa.

===Melibea===
Melibea is a strong-willed girl, in whom repression appears as forced and unnatural; she feels like a slave to the hypocrisy that has existed in her house since her childhood. In the play she appears to be the victim of a strong passion induced by Celestina&#x27;s spell. She is really bound by her social conscience. She worries about her honor, not modesty, not her concept of what is moral. Her love is more real and less &quot;literary&quot; than that of Calisto: her love motivates her actions, and Celestina&#x27;s &quot;spell&quot; allows her to retain her honor.

===Calisto===
A young nobleman who falls madly in love with Melibea. He is shown to be quite egotistical and full of passion as the entire first act is about his love for her. Even going as far as to &#x27;create a new religion&#x27; worshipping her (Act 1 pg 92-93). He is also quite insecure as, after he gets rejected, he is easily convinced to go to the witch Celestina for assistance. In the 16-act version, Calisto dies as he falls while climbing down a ladder after a sexual encounter with Melibea.

===Sempronio===
Servant to Calisto. Sempronio is the one who suggests to Calisto to ask Celestina for help with wooing Melibea; he is also the one who suggests to Celestina that by working together they could swindle money and other items of luxury from Calisto. Sempronio is in love with one of Celestina&#x27;s prostitutes, Elicia. Through him, we can also see the sexism of how this work represents its day and age. After all, after he and Pármeno kill Celestina he cannot begin to even fathom being betrayed by the women, for the women are now their property.

===Pármeno===
Servant to Calisto. Son of a prostitute who was friends with Celestina many years ago. As a child, Pármeno worked for Celestina in her brothel doing odd-jobs around the house and the town. Pármeno is in love with the prostitute Areúsa.

===Elicia===
A prostitute who lives with and works for Celestina. Cousin to Areúsa. Both she and her cousin deeply respect their mistress as they use words such as &quot;Señora&quot; to describe her. It is for this reason that after Sempronio and Pármeno kill Celestina she plots Calisto&#x27;s death as revenge (and succeeds several months later).

===Areúsa===
Prostitute who periodically works with Celestina but lives independently. Cousin to Elicia. Both she and her cousin deeply respect their mistress as they use words such as &quot;Señora&quot; to describe her. It is for this reason that after Sempronio and Pármeno kill Celestina she plots Calisto&#x27;s death as revenge (and succeeds several months later).

===Lucrecia===
Personal servant to Melibea.

=== Pleberio ===
Melibea&#x27;s father.

=== Alisa ===
Melibea&#x27;s mother.

<doc id="869977" wikidata="Q715461" url="?curid=869977" title="Arturo Ripstein">
<text>Arturo Ripstein y Rosen (born December 13, 1943) is a Mexican film director and screenwriter. Considered the &quot;Godfather of independent Mexican cinema&quot;, Ripstein&#x27;s work is generally characterized by &quot;somber, slow-paced, macabre melodramas tackling existential loneliness&quot;, often with a grotesque-like edge. 

He is a nine-time Ariel Award winner, including five for Best Picture and two for Best Director. Three of his films have been nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. In 1997, he received the prestigious National Prize for Arts and Sciences for his contributions to Mexican cinema. He was the second filmmaker (after Luis Buñuel) to receive that honour.

== Early life ==
Ripstein was born in Mexico City on 13 December 1943, to producer Alfredo Ripstein and Frida Rosen. He is of Polish Jewish descent. He developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age due to his family&#x27;s proximity, and made short films as a teenager. He met Luis Buñuel after seeing &quot;Nazarín&quot;, and they developed a close mentor-student relationship that lasted until Bunuel&#x27;s death.

==Career==
After working as Bunuel&#x27;s uncredited assistant director on &quot;The Exterminating Angel&quot; (1962), Ripstein got his break into movies working learning from Luis Buñuel . In 1965, he directed &quot;Tiempo de morir&quot;, his first feature. Written by Carlos Fuentes and Gabriel García Márquez, it began a tradition of making independent films written by high-profile Latin-American authors. His 1981 film &quot;Seduction&quot; was entered into the 12th Moscow International Film Festival. His 1989 film &quot;Love Lies&quot; was entered into the 16th Moscow International Film Festival.

Some of Ripstein&#x27;s films, especially the earlier ones, &quot;highlighted characters beset by futile compulsions to escape [their] destinies&quot;. Many of his films are shot in tawdry interiors, with bleak brown color schemes, and seedy pathetic characters who manage to achieve a hint of pathos and dignity. &quot;Así es la vida&quot;, according to Jonathan Crow, &quot;boldly reworks the ancient Greek drama Medea, employing a dizzying array of flashbacks and Brechtian devices&quot;. &quot;Deep Crimson&quot;, according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, is &quot;a ferociously anti-romantic portrait of an obese nurse and a seedy small-time gigolo whose bungling scheme to swindle a succession of lonely women out of their life savings turns into a killing spree.&quot;

In 1997, Ripstein won the National Prize of Arts and Sciences, the second filmmaker after Buñuel to do so.

== Personal life ==
Ripstein is married to screenwriter Paz Alicia Garciadiego, with whom he has two children. In 2003, the two received honorary Spanish citizenship.

<doc id="869978" wikidata="Q7146203" url="?curid=869978" title="Patrick Campbell, 3rd Baron Glenavy">
<text>Patrick Gordon Campbell, 3rd Baron Glenavy (6 June 1913 – 9 November 1980) was an Anglo-Irish journalist, humorist, television personality, and peer, with a seat in the House of Lords from 1963 until his death. 

==Life and career==
Campbell was born in Dublin, the first son of Charles Campbell, 2nd Baron Glenavy, and his wife the artist Beatrice Elvery. He was educated at Rossall School (which he loathed), and then at Pembroke College, Oxford, but left Oxford without completing his degree. He was then taken on by &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, working for Bertie Smyllie, and began his career reporting for the column &quot;Courts Day by Day&quot;. 

During the Second World War, Campbell served as a chief petty officer in the Irish Marine Service. After the war, he re-joined &quot;The Irish Times&quot; (using the pseudonym &#x27;Quidnunc&#x27;), and was put in charge of the column &quot;An Irishman&#x27;s Diary&quot;. He also wrote a weekly column for the Irish edition of the &quot;Sunday Dispatch&quot; before working on the paper in London from 1947 to 1949. He was assistant editor of &quot;Lilliput&quot; from 1947 to 1953. His journalism was also published in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

In 1963 he succeeded his father as Baron Glenavy, gaining a seat in the House of Lords, where he rarely appeared. 

Campbell spoke with a stammer, but delighted television audiences with his wit, notably as a regular team captain on the long-running show &quot;Call My Bluff&quot;, opposite his longtime friend Frank Muir. Muir noted that &quot;When he was locked solid by a troublesome initial letter he would show his frustration by banging his knee and muttering &#x27;Come along! Come along!&#x27;&quot;. 
He also made regular appearances in &quot;Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life&quot;.
==Books==
Campbell&#x27;s books were mostly collections of humorous pieces originally published in newspapers and magazines. They included: &quot;A Long Drink of Cold Water&quot; (1949), &quot;A Short Trot with a Cultured Mind&quot; (1950), &quot;An Irishman&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1950), &quot;Life in Thin Slices&quot; (1951), &quot;Patrick Campbell&#x27;s Omnibus&quot; (1954), &quot;Come Here Till I Tell You&quot; (1960), &quot;Constantly in Pursuit&quot; (1962), &quot;How to Become a Scratch Golfer&quot; (1963), &quot;Brewing Up in the Basement&quot; (1963), &quot;Rough Husbandry&quot; (1965), &quot;The P-P-Penguin Patrick Campbell&quot; (1965), &quot;All Ways on Sundays&quot; (1966), &quot;A Bunch of New Roses&quot; (1967), &quot;My Life and Easy Times&quot; (1967, autobiography), &quot;The Coarse of Events&quot; (1968), &quot;Gullible Travels&quot; (1969), &quot;The High Speed Gasworks&quot; (1970), &quot;Waving All Excuses&quot; (1971), &quot;Patrick Campbell&#x27;s Golfing Book&quot; (1972), &quot;Fat Tuesday Tails&quot; (1972), &quot;35 Years on the Job&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Campbell Companion&quot; (1987). Many of his books were illustrated by Ronald Searle. 

In his obituary, &quot;The Times&quot; said of Campbell that

==Personal life==
Campbell was married three times, first in 1941 to Sylvia Alfreda Willoughby Lee, whom he divorced in 1947, and then to Chery Louise Munro in 1947. The two divorced in 1966, the year he married Vivienne Orme.

Campbell stood six feet five inches tall, and several of his funniest pieces dealt with the problems faced by a man of his build in merely finding shoes or clothes that would fit him. 

He lived for many years in the South of France. In 1972, Campbell became ill and it was discovered that he had a permanent heart weakness, having suffered an undetected heart attack some years before. In 1980, an attack of viral pneumonia exacerbated the condition. He died suddenly on 9 November 1980 at University College Hospital in London. He was succeeded as the 4th and last Baron Glenavy by his novelist brother Michael Mussen Campbell.

<text>Upper shoreface refers to the portion of the seafloor that is shallow enough to be agitated by everyday wave action, the wave base.

== Process ==
The continuous agitation of the sea floor in the upper shoreface environment results in sediments that are winnowed of the smallest grains, leaving only those grains heavy enough that the water cannot keep them suspended. 

=== Depth of influence ===
Seawater is moved in a vertical circular motion when a wave passes. The radius of the circle of motion for any given water molecule decreases with depth. 

The maximum depth of influence of a water wave is half the wavelength. Below that depth the water remains stationary as the wave passes. 

For instance, in a pool of water deep, a wave with a wavelength of would not be able to cause water movement on the bottom. However, a wave with a wavelength would be moving the water (barely) at the bottom.

<text>[[Lower shoreface|[[Wave base]]]] diagram.
Lower shoreface refers to the portion of the seafloor, and the sedimentary depositional environment, that lies below the everyday wave base.

== Process ==
The wave base is the maximum depth at which a water wave&#x27;s passage causes significant water motion.

In this portion of the coastal marine environment, only the larger waves produced during storms have the power to agitate the seafloor. 
Between storms, finer grained sediments accumulate on the seafloor, but during storms those sediments get suspended and moved around, resulting in a sedimentary structure form described as hummocky cross-stratification.

<text>The wave base, in physical oceanography, is the maximum depth at which a water wave&#x27;s passage causes significant water motion. At water depths deeper than the wave base, bottom sediments and the seafloor are no longer stirred by the wave motion above.

==Process==
In seawater, the water particles are moved in a circular orbital motion when a wave passes. The radius of the circle of motion for any given water molecule decreases exponentially with increasing depth. The wave base, which is the depth of influence of a water wave, is about half the wavelength.

At depths greater than half the wavelength, the water motion is less than 4% of its value at the water surface and may be neglected.

For example, in a pool of water deep, a wave with a wavelength would be moving the water at the bottom. In the same pool, a wave with a wavelength of would not be able to cause water movement on the bottom.

==Distinctions==
There are typically two wave bases, the fair weather wave base (FWWB) and the storm wave base (SWB).

The fair weather wave base refers to the depth beneath the waves under normal conditions and the portion of the seafloor that is agitated by this everyday wave action, known as the Upper shoreface.

The storm wave base refers to the depths beneath storm-driven waves and can be much deeper. The portion of the seafloor that is only agitated by storm-driven wave action is known as the Lower shoreface.

Note that another classification exists, which considers that the zone affected by both fair weather and storm waves is to be defined as shoreface, whereas &quot;Upper offshore&quot; is the name given to the zone only affected by storm waves and &quot;Lower offshore&quot; a zone not disturbed by any surface wave. (&quot;e.g.&quot; )

<text>David Bernard Swift (3 April 1931 – 8 April 2016) was an English actor known for his role as Henry Davenport in the topical comedy &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot;.

==Early life==
Swift was born in Liverpool, the second of the four children of Abram Sampson Swift and Lily Rebecca (née Greenman), who owned a furniture shop in Bootle. His family was Jewish. He was educated at Clifton College and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he studied law. He then embarked on a career as a businessman with his father-in-law, J.P. Jacobs, whose company supplied all the elastic to Marks &amp; Spencer.

==Career==
Swift made his professional debut on stage after being appointed as an assistant stage manager at Dundee Repertory Theatre in 1963. He made his television debut in 1964 as Theo Clay in the soap opera &quot;Compact&quot;. He appeared in many small-screen roles in the 1970s and 1980s, whilst in the theatre he appeared in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s 1978 production of &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot; at the Aldwych Theatre, and won acclaim for his performance as Frank Doel in the Ambassadors Theatre&#x27;s 1981-2 production of &quot;84, Charing Cross Road&quot;. In addition he played Montclair in the film of &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1973). Swift appeared as Dingley alongside Richard Beckinsale in the BBC situation comedy &quot;Bloomers&quot; (1979) and also appeared in several episodes of &quot;Going Straight&quot; (1978), the sequel to &quot;Porridge&quot;. Prior to this he had made a guest appearance, again with Beckinsale, in the Yorkshire Television comedy &quot;Rising Damp&quot; in which he played a suicidal tenant in the episode &quot;Good Samaritans&quot;. But it was the role of irascible newsreader Henry Davenport in the topical comedy &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot;, written by Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin, for which Swift became best known. He also made occasional appearances as God in the Radio 4 comedy &quot;Old Harry&#x27;s Game&quot;, also written by Hamilton.

Alongside his acting career, Swift had an active interest in the behind-the-scenes aspects of media production, running the sound recording and post-production businesses Preview 1 and Preview 2 in the 1960s, before co-founding and managing Tempest Films in 1969 along with film-makers Charles Denton, Richard Marquand, Paul Watson and John Pilger. The company also produced documentaries by actor-director Kenneth Griffith.

==Personal life and death==

Swift was the elder brother of the actor Clive Swift, known for his role in &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;, with whom he sometimes performed. He was the uncle of the academic Adam Swift and the television personality Joe Swift and their sister Rebecca. He was married to the actress Paula Jacobs, was the father of actress Julia Swift and father-in-law of actor David Bamber.

He died from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on 8 April 2016, aged 85.

He is buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery with his wife Paula.

<doc id="870009" wikidata="Q3026627" url="?curid=870009" title="Dick Skeen">
<text>Richard Edgar Skeen (March 15, 1906 – June 24, 1990) was an American professional tennis player and teacher. He was runner-up to Fred Perry in the Men&#x27;s Singles in the 1941 U.S. Pro Tennis Championships, reaching as high as World No. 2 pro that year according to Ray Bowers (and No. 4 in his amateur-pro combined rankings). Skeen reached the semifinals of other tournaments on four occasions that year. Bill Tilden recommended Dick as an outstanding Tennis Teacher in California in his 1950 book, &#x27;How to Play Better Tennis&#x27;.

==Biography==
Dick Skeen was born in Dallas, Texas in 1906 and died in Medford, Oregon in 1990 at age 84. Tennis player, Dale Jensen, became a student and close friend at the Balboa Bay Club, and encouraged Dick to write a tennis book, entitled &quot;Tennis Champions are Made, not Born&quot;, published in 1976. Dale used this knowledge to teach Mike Carrico. Dale and Dick remained close friends until Dick died in 1990. Skeen taught three World Champions (Jack Kramer, Louise Brough, and Pauline Betz) and forty National Champions, including Billy Talbert, George Richards, Gussie Moran, Kathleen Harter, Carole Caldwell, Julius Heldman and Jimmy Wade. Skeen was ranked No. 2, Nationally in the United States in 1941, and #1 in the National Senior 65-and-over in 1972, after a 28-year layoff.

In 1918, Skeen arrived in Southern California with his family and learned to play tennis on three courts in Hollywood. In 1931, he turned professional and began his tennis teaching career in Pasadena. Skeen became a legendary tennis teacher, according to Bill Tilden and Jack Kramer. He was known for his classic stroke production and his emphasis on the backhand chop, not the slice. After Pasadena, Skeen taught on private courts in Beverly Hills, then at the Rivera Country Club, the Balboa Bay Club, was hired by George Holstein, developer, and Larry Johnson, part owner, to design and be General Manager at the Newport Beach Tennis Club, founded the Blossom Hill Tennis Club in Los Gatos, and ended his teaching career at the Rogue Valley Country Club in Medford, Oregon.

While playing on the Professional Tennis Tour from 1935 until 1946, Skeen played and defeated these top world-class players: Bill Tilden, Don Budge, Ellsworth Vines, Fred Perry, Bobby Riggs, Karel Kozeluh, Vinnie Richards, Frank Kovacs, Welby Van Horn, Bruce Barnes, Wayne Sabin, and Lester Stoefen.

Skeen also was a tennis teacher to many Hollywood movie stars, including Errol Flynn, Bing Crosby, Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, Fred Astaire, Kirk Douglas, Ginger Rogers, Doris Day, Joseph Cotten, Merle Oberon, Johnny Weissmuller, Norma Shearer, Hugh O&#x27;Brian, Dolores del Río, Robert Stack, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. and Cornel Wilde.

<doc id="870011" wikidata="Q733410" url="?curid=870011" title="Horace Wells">
<text>Horace Wells (January 21, 1815 – January 24, 1848) was an American dentist who pioneered the use of anesthesia in medicine, specifically the use of nitrous oxide (or laughing gas).

==Early life==

Wells was the first of three children of Horace and Betsy Heath Wells, born on January 21, 1815, in Hartford, Vermont. His parents were well-educated and affluent landowners, which allowed him to attend private schools in New Hampshire and Amherst, Massachusetts. At the age of 19 in 1834, Wells began studying dentistry under a two-year apprenticeship in Boston. The first dental school did not open until 1840 in Baltimore.

At age 23, Wells published a booklet &quot;An Essay on Teeth&quot; in which he advocated for his ideas in preventive dentistry, particularly for the use of a toothbrush. In his booklet, he also described tooth development and oral diseases, where he mentioned diet, infection, and oral hygiene as important factors.

==Career==

After he completed dental training in Boston, Wells opened his own office in Hartford, Connecticut on April 4, 1836. Between 1841 and 1845, Wells became a reputable dentist in Hartford, where he had many patients and attracted apprentices. Among his patients were respected members of society such as William Ellsworth, the governor of Connecticut. His three apprentices were John Mankey Riggs, C. A. Kingsbury, and William T. G. Morton. In 1843, Wells and Morton started a practice in Boston and Wells continued to instruct Morton. John Riggs later became a partner of him.

Wells first witnessed the effects of nitrous oxide on December 10, 1844, when he and his wife Elizabeth attended a demonstration by Gardner Quincy Colton billed in the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; as &quot;A Grand Exhibition of the Effects Produced by Inhaling Nitrous Oxide, Exhilarating, or Laughing Gas.&quot; The demonstration took place at Union Hall, Hartford. During the demonstration, a local apothecary shop clerk Samuel A. Cooley became intoxicated by nitrous oxide. While under the influence, Cooley did not react when he struck his legs against a wooden bench while jumping around. After the demonstration, Cooley was unable to recall his actions while under the influence, but found abrasions and bruises on his knees. From this demonstration, Wells realized the potential for the analgesic properties of nitrous oxide, and met with Colton about conducting trials.

The following day, Wells conducted a trial on himself by inhaling nitrous oxide and having John Riggs extract a tooth. Upon a successful trial where he did not feel any pain, Wells went on to use nitrous oxide on at least 12 other patients in his office. In 1844, Hartford did not have a hospital, so Wells sought to demonstrate his new findings in either Boston or New York. In January 1845 he chose to go to Boston where he had previously studied dentistry, and his former student and associate William Morton resided. Wells and Morton&#x27;s practice had been dissolved in October 1844, but they remained in contact. Morton was enrolled in Harvard Medical School at the time and agreed to help Wells introduce his ideas, and provide him with dental instruments, although Morton was skeptical about the use of nitrous oxide.

He gave a demonstration to medical students in Boston at the end of January 1845. However, the gas was improperly administered, and the patient cried out in pain. The patient later admitted that although he cried out in pain, he remembered no pain and did not know when the tooth was extracted. It was later found that the gas is not as effective on both obese people and alcoholics—the patient was both. After the embarrassment of his failed demonstration, Wells immediately returned home to Hartford the next day. From this point on, his mental health declined, and his dental practice became sporadic.

On February 5, 1845, Wells advertised his home for rent. On April 7, 1845, Wells advertised in the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; that he was going to dissolve his dental practice, and referred all his patients to Riggs, the man who had extracted his tooth.

In October 1846, Morton gave a successful demonstration of ether anesthesia in Boston. Following Morton&#x27;s demonstration, Wells published a letter accounting his successful trials in 1844 in an attempt to claim the discovery of anesthesia. His efforts in establishing his claim were mostly unsuccessful.

Despite his advertisement for dissolving his practice in April 1845, Wells sporadically continued his practice, with his last daybook entry being on November 5, 1845.

==Later years==
Wells closed his office nine times and relocated six different times between 1836 and 1847. He closed his office due to ill health, although his physician could not find any physical cause for his non-specific complaints. He mentioned his recurring illness in a letter to his sister Mary Wells Cole in April 1837. He also became ill shortly after marrying Elizabeth Wales in 1838 and having his only son Charles Thomas Wells. During winter months, he would not write letters to any family or friends, except for his published letter in 1846 after Morton&#x27;s ether demonstration.

Wells definitively ended his dental practice in late 1845 and began selling shower baths for which he received a patent on November 4, 1846. He also planned to sail to Paris to purchase paintings to resell in the United States. He traveled to Paris in early 1847, where he petitioned the Academie Royale de Medicine and the Parisian Medical Society for recognition in the discovery of anesthesia.

Wells moved to New York City in January 1848, leaving his wife and young son behind in Hartford. He lived alone at 120 Chambers St in Lower Manhattan and began self-experimenting with ether and chloroform, and he became addicted to chloroform. The effects of sniffing chloroform and ether were unknown.

Wells rushed into the street on January 21, 1848, his 33rd birthday, and threw sulfuric acid over the clothing of two prostitutes. He was committed to New York&#x27;s infamous Tombs Prison. As the influence of the drug waned, his mind started to clear and he realised what he had done. He asked the guards to escort him to his house to pick up his shaving kit. He committed suicide in his cell on January 24, slitting his left femoral artery with a razor after inhaling an analgesic dose of chloroform. He is buried at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, Connecticut.

==Legacy==
Twelve days before his death, the Parisian Medical Society voted and honored him as the first to discover and perform surgical operations without pain. In addition, he was elected an honorary member and awarded an honorary MD degree. However, Wells died unaware of these decisions. Wells first voiced his concern for minimizing his patient&#x27;s pain during dental procedures in 1841. He was known for caring about his patient&#x27;s comfort. During his time as a dentist, Wells advocated for regular check ups for dental hygiene, and also began the practice of pediatric dentistry in order to start dental care early.

The American Dental Association honored Wells posthumously in 1864 as the discoverer of modern anesthesia, and the American Medical Association recognized his achievement in 1870.

Hartford, Connecticut, has a statue of Horace Wells in Bushnell Park.

A monument to Horace Wells was raised in the Place des États-Unis, Paris.

The Baltimore College of Dental Surgery awarded him an honorary posthumous degree (Doctor of Dental Surgery, DDS.) on October 10, 1990.

==In popular culture==
* The story of Dr. Wells&#x27; self-experimentation with drugs was explored in an episode of Science Channel&#x27;s &quot;Dark Matters: Twisted But True&quot; in a story entitled &quot;Jekyll vs Hyde&quot;, comparing it to the &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;.
* A full-length theatrical production, entitled &quot;Ether Dome&quot;, written by Elizabeth Egloff and directed by Michael Wilson centers around the story of Horace Wells&#x27; discovery of nitrous oxide as an anesthetic, as well as the life of his protege and partner, William Morton.

<doc id="870013" wikidata="Q2740954" url="?curid=870013" title="Frank Kovacs">
<text>Frank Kovacs (December 4, 1919 – February 1990) was an American amateur and professional tennis player in the mid-20th century. He won the U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships singles title in 1941. He won the World Professional Championships tournament in 1945 in San Francisco. Kovacs was successful on clay and won the Great Lakes Professional Clay Court Championships near Chicago in 1946, defeating Riggs in the final, and five U.S. Professional Clay Court Championships from 1948 to 1953. Kovacs won U.S. Professional Championships or International Professional Championships at Cleveland in 1951. He also won the U.S. Professional Challenge Tour in 1947 against Bobby Riggs.

Kovacs was ranked the world No. 1 professional tennis player in two different years, by the WPTA (World Professional Tennis Association) for 1945 and by the PTPA (Professional Tennis Players Association) for 1951.

==Biography==
Kovacs&#x27; father was a Hungarian immigrant upholsterer. In his youth he had tennis lessons at the Berkeley Tennis Club. Kovacs had a reputation as an eccentric tennis player and showman on the court. Once, serving for a match point, he tossed three balls in the air - hitting the middle one for an ace. He was known to jump into the stands to applaud his opponents, and once staged a sit-down strike during a match. A newspaper article in 1940 said &quot;Kovacs&#x27; comments as he races about the court are remindful of Bob Hope or Milton Berle before a microphone, and that these ad libs are spoken in a voice that overcomes the poor acoustics of a tennis court and are audible to everyone in the gallery.&quot; Jack Kramer writes in his autobiography that Kovacs &quot;was a big attractive guy, with a great smile—sort of a Nastase type, only harmless, not mean.&quot; He goes on to say that during an important match against Joe Hunt &quot;Kovacs looked up at an airplane. Hunt mimicked him, so Kovacs lay down for a clearer view, and Hunt did the same, and they were both soon lying flat out on the turf watching an airplane fly by while the fans watched them.&quot;

==Career==
===Amateur===
;1936
In July Kovacs reached the quarter-finals of the Oregon championships in Portland before losing to Elwood Cooke. Later in the month he lost in the quarter-finals of the Washington State championships in Seattle to Dick Bennett.

;1937
In May Kovacs won the Central California championships beating Ed Amark in the final. In June Kovacs was beaten in the final of the California State Championship tournament at Berkeley. Dick Bennett of the University of California tennis team defeated him in five sets. John Murio, former California state champion, said Kovacs was better at 17 years of age than Don Budge. Murio opposed Budge, when Budge was 17, in various tournaments around California. In July Kovacs beat Walter Senior to win the Ohio championships. In July, Kovacs won the Badger State Championships beating Donald Leavens in the final. In August, Kovacs won the Port Stockton tournament beating Ed Amark in the final.

;1938
In May Kovacs beat 16 year old Jack Kramer in the final to win the California State championship.
In very hot conditions in the third round at the Newport Casino event in August, Kovacs faced William Murphy. Murphy won the first set and then led 3-1 lead in the second. In the fourth game, Kovacs slumped to the ground and had to be assisted to the dressing room. He lost in the third round of the 1938 U. S. National championships to Gene Mako.

;1939
Kovacs beat Eddie Alloo in the final of the Northern California indoor tournament in San Francisco in February. Kovacs beat Alloo in the final to win the California State championships in May. In June, Kovacs beat Tom Brown and Nick Carter to win the Central California championships.

Kovacs was not selected by the USLTA to the U.S. Davis Cup team due to a controversy over his tennis coach and did not play in Europe. Kovacs also missed much of the season due to an arm injury or &quot;tennis elbow&quot;. Kovacs recovered enough to play in October but lost to reigning Wimbledon and U. S. champion Bobby Riggs in the final of the Pacific Coast championships in five sets, despite leading 5-2 in the fifth set. Kovacs had missed much of the year and was not ranked for 1939.

;1940
In May, Kovacs beat Welby Van Horn to win the California State Championships for the third year in a row. In June Kovacs beat Frank Parker in straight sets in the final of the Triple A tournament in St. Louis. In July, Kovacs beat Elwood Cooke in five sets in the final to win Nassau Country Club Invitation Tournament in New York. In July, Kovacs beat Seymour Greenberg to win Eastern Slopes Gold Racquet tournament in New Hampshire. In August he beat Bobby Riggs in the semifinals at Southampton before losing to Don McNeill in the final. Kovacs beat young Vic Seixas from two sets to love down in the third round of the U. S. Nationals. He lost in the quarter-finals in straight sets to Joe Hunt. In October Kovacs lost in the final of the Pacific Coast championships to Riggs. In December, Kovacs beat Bobby Riggs in the final of the Oklahoma indoor tournament. Kovacs was the No. 3 ranked American amateur by the USLTA in 1940.

;1941
In January Kovacs beat Eddie Alloo in the final of the Dixie tournament in Tampa. In January, Kovacs beat Riggs in the quarter-finals of the Florida state tournament in Orlando and went on to beat Jack Kramer in the semis and Don McNeill in the final. In January, Kovacs beat Riggs in four sets to win the title at St. Petersburg, Florida. In February, Kovacs beat Riggs in the final of the University of Miami event from two sets to love down. Kovacs won the title at the U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships in March, which was held at the Oklahoma Coliseum, after three-straight-set wins in the semifinal against Riggs and in the final against Wayne Sabin.
In April, Kovacs won the River Oaks tournament in Houston beating Kramer in the semifinals and Bitsy Grant in the final. In June, Kovacs won at Orange Lawn Tennis Club, N.J. on grass, defeating Kramer in the final. In August, Kovacs won the Eastern Grasscourt Championships at the Westchester Country Club in Rye, N.Y., defeating Schroeder, McNeill, and Sabin in three-straight-set matches. Kovacs was runner-up in the U.S. National Championships at Forest Hills, beating Jack Kramer and Don McNeill before losing to top-seeded Bobby Riggs in a five-set final. Kovacs beat Riggs in the final of the Pacific Coast championships in October, allowing Riggs just five games in three sets. 
&quot;I&#x27;ve never seen Frank play better tennis. He played brilliantly and outplayed me all the way. I have never taken a worse beating&quot; said Riggs after the match. Kovacs won nine tournaments in 1941, defeating Riggs in five of those events. After the Pacific Coast final the Oakland Tribune reported that &quot;it was their nineteenth encounter and Kovacs&#x27; seventh victory&quot;. Kovacs was ranked the No. 2 American amateur in 1941 by the USLTA. He was ranked the world No. 3 behind Riggs and Perry in a combined amateur-professional ranking for 1941 compiled by Ray Bowers in 2006.

Kovacs was also responsible for something of a scandal over money in tennis, which before the Open era was strictly divided into amateurs and professionals. After he was barred from amateur tennis in 1941 (leaving with a characteristic witticism - &quot;Amateur tennis stinks - there&#x27;s no money in it any more.&quot;), he talked about how money was quietly - and widely - paid to supposedly amateur players for entering tournaments.

===Professional===
After being evicted from the amateur ranks, Kovacs and Riggs turned professional at the same time, both signing a professional contract in November 1941 for $25,000 guarantees.

;1942
From December 1941 through April 1942 the Pro tour consisted of round-robin matches between Don Budge, Bobby Riggs, Fred Perry, and Kovacs (with Gene Mako, Lester Stoefen and even Bill Tilden, for one match, as replacements for the injured Kovacs and Perry). Budge ended up with the best record, 52 wins to 18 losses, ahead of Riggs 36-36 and Kovacs, 25 wins to 26 losses. Kovacs led the early part of the tour mainly because he defeated Budge in their first five matches. Kovacs missed one month of play on this tour due to an arm injury. Kovacs was ranked world No. 3 in a combined professional-amateur ranking in February, 1942 behind Budge and Riggs.

After the tour he entered the U.S. Pro Championships at Forest Hills and reached the semifinals, losing to Riggs. As with the other great pros of the time, he then joined the U.S. Army. From 1943 to the end of WWII, Kovacs served in the army.

;1943-1945
Though the tennis activity was very limited between 1943 and 1945 Kovacs defeated the players he was able to play against such as Welby Van Horn, Don McNeill, Adrian Quist, Bill Tilden, Jack Crawford, Jack Jossi, Martin Buxby, Joe Whalen, George Lott, George Lyttleton Rogers. Kovacs played matches in Australia in 1943 against Australian amateurs. At Brisbane on 28 and 29 August, Kovacs played Crawford. Kovacs won in straight sets on 28th, but lost in three sets on 29th. On 26 November at Brisbane, Kovacs beat Crawford for the loss of two games. The following day, Kovacs beat Crawford in straight sets. He beat Quist on 4 September in Sydney. In March, 1945 Kovacs won the World Professional Championships tournament in San Francisco organized by the WPTA (World Professional Tennis Association), defeating Van Horn in the final. Kovacs was ranked the world No. 1 professional tennis player for 1945 by the WPTA, ahead of 2) Van Horn 3) Budge 5) Riggs. Budge was reported to be out of condition due to military duties. Tilden ranked Kovacs as No. 2 behind Budge. YANK, The Army Weekly, stated that of the professional tennis players serving in uniform, &quot;the best of them was Frank Kovacs&quot;.

Kovacs was recalled to military duty in July and was reported to be in hospital in August, thus missing the USPLTA U.S. Pro won by Van Horn over a depleted field.

;1946
In the 1946 world professional tournament series organized by the Professional Players Association, Kovacs won the California State Pro Championship at Beverly Hills at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel on cement (defeating Perry in the final), the Southwestern Pro at Phoenix indoor (defeating Earn in the final), the Southern California Pro at Santa Barbara on cement (defeating Perry in the final), the Texas State Pro at Dallas on grass (defeating Van Horn in the final in five sets). Kovacs displayed his skill on clay, winning the Cotton State Pro in Birmingham Ala. on clay (defeating Earn in the final), the Michigan State Pro at Kalamazoo on clay (defeating Riggs in the final), and the Great Lakes Pro Championships in the Chicago area at the Knollwood Club in Lake Forest, Ill. on clay (defeating Riggs in the final in five sets). Kovacs did not play in the northeastern portion of the tournament series, and in the final point standings, Kovacs finished third behind Riggs and Budge. Of the 31 tournaments, Riggs won 14, Kovacs won 7, Perry won 4, Budge won 3, and Van Horn won 2.

;1947
The World Professional Players Association was formed, led by Riggs and Budge, but disappeared before the end of the year. Kovacs lost to Riggs in the U.S. Pro Indoor semifinal at Philadelphia on wood in March. In April, Kovacs began an 11-match two-man tour with Riggs, who organized the tour, the U.S. Professional Challenge Tour. Kovacs scored six match wins against Bobby Riggs&#x27; five to win the tour, the final and deciding match of best-of-five sets being postponed until early September with the series tied at five wins each. In late April and May, Kovacs won three tournaments in New York State, at Buffalo (over Riggs in the final), at Rochester (over Earn in the final) and at Troy on canvas (over Van Horn in the final). Riggs withdrew from the quarter-finals at Rochester and Troy due to a foot problem, but it was reported that in the doubles final at Troy, Riggs &quot;ran like a scared rabbit despite reports of an injured foot&quot;. Kovacs lost to Riggs in the U.S. Pro at Forest Hills semifinal on grass in June. On September 2, Kovacs won the decider of the U.S. Professional Challenge Tour over Riggs in three straight sets using &quot;a devastating series of well-placed backhand shots and cannonball serves.&quot; Kovacs and Riggs both won seven matches against each other on the year. The WPPA organization disappeared before the end of the year and did not issue any official rankings.

;1948
Kovacs won the North Florida Pro championships in St. Augustine in January beating Bill Lufler in the final. Kovacs won U.S. Professional Clay Court Championships at Miami in December (defeating Jimmy Evert in the final). Kovacs said in a statement after the match he renounced the title for the following reasons: &quot;First - the tournament was not sanctioned by the Professional Lawn Tennis Association. (PLTA). Second there was not a full representative field of ranking players competing for the title. As of Jan. 1, 1949. I will participate only in PLTA sanctioned tournaments.&quot; The PLTA ranked Kovacs joint third with Budge.

;1949
In January Kovacs won the U. S. Pro Clay Court Championships in St. Augustine. In the semis he beat Segura. &quot;Kovacs had his serve working wonders and used his power&quot;. In the final he overcame Van Horn in five-sets.

;1950
Kovacs won the U. S. Pro Clay Court Championships in March over Van Horn in the final, displaying an agile change of pace. In June, at the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships at the Cleveland Skating Rink on clay, Kovacs defeated Parker in the quarter-finals, losing only one game in a three-straight-set win. Parker was the reigning French champion on clay. Kovacs then defeated Riggs in four sets to reach the final. In the final, at 4-4 in the fourth set, he developed leg cramps and retired, losing to Segura, who had defeated Kramer in the other semifinal. Kovacs won the Canadian Pro Championships at Quebec City on clay in September (over Van Horn in the final). Kovacs was third in the PLTA rankings.

;1951
Kovacs won the U. S. Pro Clay Court Championships in March over Earn in the final. In June Kovacs and Parker would play against each other in the semifinals of the Canadian Professional Championships at Quebec City on clay, Kovacs winning in straight sets (Kovacs lost to Segura in four sets in the final). Kovacs&#x27; greatest pro tournament result was winning the International Pro Championships or US Pro Tennis Championships (according to the PTPA) held at Lakewood on cement just outside Cleveland in June 1951. He defeated Budge in a long semifinal and Pancho Segura in the final in five sets, saving five match points against him in the fifth set before winning. Kovacs was awarded the Benrus Cup, emblematic of the U.S. Pro Championships. A week later he withdrew from the Forest Hills version of the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships (organized by Riggs and Kramer) won by Segura. Kovacs was vice-president of the PTPA, which supported the rival Cleveland event, and Riggs and Kramer did not play at Cleveland that year. In early August 1951, shortly after beginning a tour with George Lyttleton Rogers and Frank Parker, Kovacs and Lyttleton Rogers disappeared and did not play scheduled fixtures, leaving Parker on his own. Kovacs and Lyttleton Rogers were longtime friends, and Rogers was married on September 2 in California. Kovacs was ranked the world No. 1 professional tennis player for 1951 by the PTPA (Professional Tennis Players Association), ahead of Segura, Gonzales, and Kramer, in that order.

;1952
In March 1952, at age 32, Kovacs defeated Pancho Gonzales in the Philadelphia Masters indoor on wood, despite losing the first eight games of the match. Kovacs lost all of his remaining matches (including his other match against Gonzales) in this round-robin event where four players played each other twice. This was Gonzales&#x27; only loss in the tournament, as he beat Kramer twice, beat Segura twice, and split the two matches with Kovacs. Kovacs was ranked the world No. 3 professional in the PTPA annual rankings for 1952 behind Segura and Gonzales. The USPLTA pro rankings for 1952 and published in &quot;Lawn Tennis &amp; Badminton&quot; placed Kovacs at No. 3 behind Segura and Gonzales.

;1953
An injured Kovacs won the U. S. Pro Clay Court Championships in January at Hollywood Beach, Fla. over Riggs in the final in three straight sets. The 1953 win over Riggs marked Kovacs&#x27; seventh U.S. national singles title.

;1954
Kovacs won the 1954 Florida Pro Championships at Fort Lauderdale on clay, defeating Riggs in the final. &quot;Kovacs&#x27; power and accurate placements to the corners, plus a number of service aces, spelled the difference in the deciding set.&quot; Kovacs was ranked fifth by the International Professional Tennis Association.

;1955
In March, 1955 Kovacs defeated Nick Carter in a pro exhibition match in San Francisco in straight sets. Immediately after this match, Kovacs played in the Cleveland World Pro or U.S. Pro played that year under the VASS scoring system. Kovacs defeated Riggs to reach the semifinal where he lost a very close match to Gonzales. Two months later he played Pancho Gonzales in two matches using the VASS scoring system at the California Tennis Club in San Francisco and nearly beat him in both matches. Kovacs was ranked third in 1955 by the International Professional Tennis Association.

;Later years
Kovacs continued to play in the Cleveland World Pro or U.S. Pro, the one major tournament which he had won. Ironically, the Sports Illustrated article of his 1957 appearance at Cleveland claimed that Kovacs &quot;...has the finest collection of strokes in tennis but has never cashed in on this potential,&quot; despite the fact that Kovacs had previously won the event in 1951. Kovacs was ranked sixth for 1957 in the Jack March professional rankings, just ahead of Kramer at seventh. He spent his later years teaching tennis at the Davie Tennis Stadium in Piedmont, in Florida and at public courts near his home in Oakland.

===Playing style and assessment===
Kovacs won many clay events, including the Great Lakes Professional Clay Court Championships near Chicago and also five U. S. Professional Clay Court Championships. He reached two U.S. Pro finals at Cleveland, on clay in 1950 and on cement in 1951, winning the latter. Kovacs also reached the semifinals of the US Pro a further eight times. He lost five U.S. Pro semifinals at Forest Hills on grass. Kovacs did not play in the U.S. Clay Court Championships after 1938, or at Roland Garros or in Davis Cup, events where he would have been expected to achieve some success. Kovacs won a head-to-head series on an indoor surface against Riggs, with both players reportedly in excellent form throughout the matches. It was said of him that on the right days, when he was &quot;in the zone&quot;, he could be unbeatable. Fred Hawthorne, reporter for &quot;New York Herald-Tribune&quot; who watched nearly all the early matches of the 1941-1942 pro tour thought that Kovacs at his best reached &quot;sheer brilliancy never before excelled&quot;, but at other times Frank played &quot;surprisingly poor tennis.&quot; Kovacs had an arm injury in that tour and missed one month of play. In his first pro match, on December 26, 1941 he defeated Don Budge, and won his first five matches against Budge on that tour.

Bowers evaluated Kovacs&#x27; playing style, &quot;Kovacs was nearly two years younger than Riggs, of whom he was a direct opposite. Frank was rangy, about 6&#x27; 4&quot;, and served with lethal velocity. Riggs termed Frank&#x27;s stroking &quot;tremendously powerful&quot; from both sides—often brilliant but sometimes erratic. Generally uninterested in coming to net, Frank preferred beating opponents from backcourt. Budge later said that the Kovacs backhand was the best he had ever seen. (Tilden wrote that it was second only to Budge&#x27;s.)&quot; Kovacs&#x27; net game improved during the 1940s, with a report from 1947 that &quot;Kovacs had the losers shaking their heads by the sheer brilliance of his net game&quot;. In an assessment from July 1951, it was stated that &quot;Kovacs, present world pro champ, gained his formidable spot through booming serves and a sound net game...&quot;, indicating that his net play had developed.

Tennis great Jack Kramer, Kovacs&#x27; near contemporary and rival, wrote: &quot;Kovacs had picture strokes, maybe the best Backhand, but he could never win anything because he didn&#x27;t have any idea how to go about winning. He never had a set plan for a match. Hell, he never had a set plan for a shot. He could sort of decide what to do with it halfway through the stroke.&quot; Kovacs&#x27; best shot, says Kramer, was &quot;a hard, angled backhand crosscourt, but he could never figure out how to set it up so he could take advantage of it.&quot; Riggs reportedly said to Kramer one day: &quot;...don&#x27;t worry about Frankie... He looks great, but give him long enough and he&#x27;ll find some way to keep you in the match, and give him a little longer and he&#x27;ll find a way to beat himself.&quot; Nevertheless, Kovacs had many notable wins over Riggs, and a very positive win–loss record against Kramer. In the Philadelphia Inquirer in March 1950, it was said Kovacs led Kramer 16-0 in their head to heads as amateurs. TennisBase states Kramer led 4-0 in their meetings as pros, all four matches played in the Philadelphia indoor tournament on wood.

==Personal life==
Kovacs was married to San Francisco vocal coach Judy Davis in 1950 and they lived for many years in their home in the Rockridge district of Oakland, until his death in 1990. His first marriage, on July 14, 1941, was to Virginia Wolfenden, also a tennis professional; they had a son, Frank Jr.

His cousin was the entertainer Ernie Kovacs.

<doc id="870014" wikidata="Q734544" url="?curid=870014" title="Alex Olmedo">
<text>Alejandro &quot;Alex&quot; Olmedo Rodríguez (March 24, 1936December 9, 2020) was a tennis player from Peru with American citizenship. He was listed by the USTA as a &quot;foreign&quot; player for 1958, but as a U.S. player for 1959. He helped win the Davis Cup for the United States in 1958 and was the No. 2 ranked amateur in 1959. Olmedo won two Majors in 1959 (Australia and Wimbledon) and the U.S. Pro Championships in 1960, and was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame in 1987.

== Biography ==
Although born and raised in Peru, Olmedo moved to Southern California and was mentored by Perry T. Jones, president of the Southern California Tennis Association at the Los Angeles Tennis Club (LATC). George Toley recruited him to play for the University of Southern California (USC). Olmedo graduated with a business degree from USC. While there, he won the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Singles and Doubles Championships in 1956 and 1958. (In 1957, USC was excluded from NCAA competition due to a financial contribution violation involving the football program which also suspended the tennis team.)

Olmedo was ranked as the world No. 2 in 1959 by Lance Tingay of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

Perry T. Jones was Davis Cup captain in 1958 and recruited Olmedo from Modesto Junior College to play on the team. He represented the U.S. in Davis Cup competition in 1958 and 1959, winning in both singles and doubles – achieving all three of the three points required to win the Cup in 1958 (two singles and one doubles). His teammates were Ham Richardson and Barry MacKay, when they won the Cup in 1958. Although he was not a U.S. citizen, he was technically eligible to represent the U.S. in Davis Cup because he had lived in the country for at least three years (since February 1954) and because Peru, his country of citizenship, did not have a Davis Cup team in those particular years. However, his participation was very controversial. Sports columnist Arthur Dailey at &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;This would seem to be the saddest day in the history of American tennis. A few more such rousing victories and the prestige of this country in tennis will sink to a new low.&quot; At the time, Olmedo, who held a student visa, refused to file for U.S. citizenship, said he was content to remain a Peruvian citizen, and denied he was refusing to apply for U.S. citizenship to avoid being drafted into the military. Still, many Americans &quot;took a dim view of the largest nation in the competition stooping to borrow a little player from Peru to win the Cup&quot;. Olmedo eventually became a U.S. citizen many years later.

Olmedo won the Australian Championships and the Wimbledon singles titles in 1959 and was the runner-up at the 1959 U.S. Championships, losing to Neale Fraser, whom he defeated in the Australian Championships earlier that year. At 1959 Wimbledon, he defeated Rod Laver in 71 minutes 6–4, 6–3, 6–4. Olmedo turned professional in 1960, and that year, won the US Pro title by beating Tony Trabert in the final.

Olmedo was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1987. He spent over 40 years teaching tennis at the Beverly Hills Hotel in California. His clients included Katharine Hepburn, Robert Duvall, and Jon Lovitz.

Olmedo&#x27;s marriage to Ann Olmedo ended in divorce. He had a son Alejandro Jr., two daughters Amy and Angela, and four grand children. Olmedo died on December 9, 2020, at the age of 84 from cancer in Los Angeles.

<doc id="870015" wikidata="Q3874313" url="?curid=870015" title="Neil Pearson">
<text>Neil John Pearson (born 27 April 1959) is a British actor, known for his work on television. He was nominated for the 1994 BAFTA TV Award for Best Actor for &quot;Between the Lines&quot; (1992–1994). His other television roles include &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot; (1990–1998), &quot;All the Small Things&quot; (2009), &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; (2014–2015), and &quot;In the Club&quot; (2014–2016). His film appearances include all three of the &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; films. He is also an antiquarian book dealer who specialises in the expatriate literary movement of Paris between the World Wars.

==Early life==
Pearson grew up in Battersea and Balham, London. His father, a panel beater, left home when he was five; his mother was a legal secretary. He was a boarder at Woolverstone Hall School near Ipswich, Suffolk where he first learned to act. He attended the Central School of Speech and Drama from 1977 to 1980.

==Stage, television and film work==
One of Pearson&#x27;s early appearances was in 1984 alongside Leonard Rossiter in Joe Orton&#x27;s play &quot;Loot&quot; at the Lyric Theatre in London; Rossiter died in his dressing-room during a later performance. He won a part in Hat Trick Productions&#x27; sitcom &quot;Chelmsford 123&quot; and also appeared with Hat Trick executive Jimmy Mulville in &quot;That&#x27;s Love&quot;. Pearson narrated Colin Wyatt&#x27;s animated series &quot;The Poddington Peas&quot; in 1986.

It was in the roles of associate editor and office lothario and gambling addict, Dave Charnley, in the sitcom &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot; - another Hat Trick show - and of Detective Superintendent Tony Clark in the thriller &quot;Between the Lines&quot; (1992–94), that he made his greatest impact on the viewing public.

Since then he has appeared in such varied roles as Dr Jameson in &quot;Rhodes&quot; (1996), Jack Green in the children&#x27;s serial &quot;The Magician&#x27;s House&quot; (1999), Trevor Heslop in &quot;Trevor&#x27;s World of Sport&quot; (2003) and John Diamond in &quot;A Lump in My Throat&quot; (2003). He has also been in several films, including &quot;The Secret Rapture&quot; (1993), &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; (1997) and &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; (2001). He played Major Steve Arnold, the American interrogator, in &quot;Taking Sides&quot; at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in 2003. He played Rob in &quot;The Booze Cruise&quot; (2003), and then also in the second and third sequels in 2005 and 2006. He appeared in the 2006 Radio Four series &quot;Vent&quot; as Ben. He played the choirmaster Michael Caddick in the BBC drama &quot;All the Small Things&quot; in 2009. He also appeared in episodes of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; and &quot;Lewis&quot; - in the former, appearing alongside &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot; co-star Jeff Rawle; and in the latter, again playing a gambling addict alongside Haydn Gwynne, another star of &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot; - and played Doug Anderson in an episode of &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; in 2013.

In the Inspector George Gently episode &quot;Goodbye to China&quot; (2011), Pearson acts as a former Sergeant of DCI Gently, who now has risen in rank above his former master. In 2014 Pearson became a series regular in &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; as new headteacher Vaughan Fitzgerald.

Pearson was a judge on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Play&#x27;s the Thing&quot;, which sought to find a play written by an unknown writer for a run in the West End. The winning play, written by Kate Betts, was called &quot;On the Third Day&quot; and opened at the New Ambassadors Theatre in London in June 2006. Pearson appeared in a touring revival of Sir Peter Hall&#x27;s production of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Old Times&quot; in 2006, and in a production of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s play &quot;Arcadia&quot; at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre, London, in 2009.

After obtaining a collection of original &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; radio scripts and realising that some of the corresponding recordings no longer existed, he conceived and subsequently co-produced &quot;The Missing Hancocks&quot;, a series of re-creations of selected wiped episodes for BBC Radio 4, which debuted in October 2014.

In 2020, he was in season 8, episode 4 of &quot;Father Brown&quot;. He also appeared as Eric Morley in an episode of &quot;The Reckoning&quot; (2023), a miniseries about the life of Jimmy Savile.

Pearson has acted in several BBC Radio Dramas including the black comedy series &quot;Vent&quot; as comatose writer Ben Smith, adaptations of the Martin Beck novels playing Beck&#x27;s sidekick Detective Lennart Kollberg, and &quot;House of Ghosts: A Case for Inspector Morse&quot; where he played the late Colin Dexter&#x27;s iconic fictional detective Inspector Morse.

==Antiquarian book business==

Pearson is the author of a book on the publisher Jack Kahane, &quot;Obelisk: A History of Jack Kahane and the Obelisk Press&quot;. He is a collector of rare drama scripts and in 2011 he opened an online bookshop specialising in theatrical material. He has a special interest in the expatriate literary movement of Paris between the wars.

==Personal interests==

He strongly identifies with the British Left - having made a party election broadcast for the Labour Party for the 1994 European Elections, though he later supported Ken Livingstone when Livingstone ran as an independent candidate for Mayor of London in 2000. For many years he has also supported the National Council for One Parent Families, having written about his family background for the organisation, and also raised £32,000 for the charity on a celebrity edition of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;.

He is a keen Texas hold &#x27;em poker player and participated in the 2007 World Series of Poker Europe event in London. Pearson is also a fan of Tottenham Hotspur and regularly attends home games. In 2007 he assisted with fundraising to renovate the Bristol Old Vic Theatre.

<text>Earl Henry &quot;Butch&quot; Buchholz, Jr. (born September 16, 1940) is a former professional tennis player from the United States who was one of the game&#x27;s top players in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

==Tennis career==

===Juniors===
Buchholz was an outstanding junior, winning all three of the Boys&#x27; Singles slam titles in a row during 1958–1959:
* French Open: (1958)
* Wimbledon: (1958)
* Australian Open: (1959)

Buchholz also won the U.S. National Boys’ 18 title in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 1958.

On February 10, 1959, he appeared as a mystery contestant on the television quiz show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, where he was described as holding the “grand slam” of junior tennis titles in France, England, Australia and the United States.

===Amateur/Pro Tour===
Buchholz was ranked by Lance Tingay the world No. 5 amateur player in 1960 and ranked four times in the U.S. top 10. He played for the United States in the Davis Cup in 1959 and 1960. In the 1960 Wimbledon quarterfinal, Buchholz led Neale Fraser 2 sets to 1, and had match points in the fourth set, but Buchholz had started cramping and had to retire from the match when Fraser made it 15–15 in the fourth set. Fraser went on to win the 1960 Wimbledon title. Buchholz reached the semifinals of the U.S. Championships in 1960, losing to Rod Laver in five sets.

Buchholz turned professional in 1961. He won the United States Pro Championship in 1962, beating Pancho Segura in the finals. Buchholz was an original member of Lamar Hunt&#x27;s Handsome Eight, a group of players signed by in 1968 for the newly formed professional World Championship Tennis.

==Retirement==
Since retiring as a player, Buchholz has served tennis in many professional and administrative capacities. He has been the Commissioner of World Team Tennis from 1977 to 1978, an executive director of the Association of Tennis Professionals from 1981 to 1982, and member of the men&#x27;s pro council from 1981 to 1983.

In 1985, Buchholz founded the Lipton International Players Championships (now known as the Miami Open), which is a leading event on both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tours. One of the courts there is named after Buchholz.

Buchholz helped create Altenis, a management company which oversees tennis tournaments in Latin America. He also helped secure the continuation of the Orange Bowl International Tennis Tournament, a prominent international junior event in Florida. In 1992, Buchholz teamed with Arthur Ashe to found the Good Life Mentoring Program, benefiting hundreds of elementary and middle school children in the greater Miami area.

In 2005, Buchholz was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island.

<doc id="870017" wikidata="Q535334" url="?curid=870017" title="Max Weber (artist)">
<text>Max Weber (April 18, 1881 – October 4, 1961) was a Jewish-American painter and one of the first American Cubist painters who, in later life, turned to more figurative Jewish themes in his art. He is best known today for &quot;Chinese Restaurant&quot; (1915), in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art, &quot;the finest canvas of his Cubist phase,&quot; in the words of art historian Avis Berman.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Born in the Polish city of Białystok, then part of the Russian Empire, Weber emigrated to the United States and settled in Brooklyn with his Orthodox Jewish parents at the age of ten. He studied art at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn under Arthur Wesley Dow. Dow was a fortunate early influence on Weber as he was an &quot;enlightened and vital teacher&quot; in a time of conservative art instruction, a man who was interested in new approaches to creating art. Dow had met Paul Gauguin in Pont-Aven, was a devoted student of Japanese art, and defended the advanced modernist painting and sculpture he saw at the Armory Show in New York in 1913.

In 1905, after teaching in Virginia and Minnesota, Weber had saved enough money to travel to Europe, where he studied at the Académie Julian in Paris and acquainted himself with the work of such modernists as Henri Rousseau (who became a good friend), Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and other members of the School of Paris. His friends among fellow Americans included some equally adventurous young painters, such as Abraham Walkowitz, H. Lyman Sayen, and Patrick Henry Bruce. Avant-garde France in the years immediately before World War I was fertile and welcoming territory for Weber, then in his early twenties. He arrived in Paris in time to see a major Cézanne exhibition, meet the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, frequent Gertrude Stein&#x27;s salon, and enroll in classes in Matisse&#x27;s private &quot;Academie.&quot; Rousseau gave him some of his works; others, Weber purchased. He was responsible for Rousseau&#x27;s first exhibition in the United States.

===America===
In 1909 he returned to New York and helped to introduce Cubism to America. He is now considered one of the most significant early American Cubists, but the reception his work received in New York at the time was profoundly discouraging. Critical response to his paintings in a 1911 show at the 291 gallery, run by Alfred Stieglitz, was an occasion for &quot;one of the most merciless critical whippings that any artist has received in America.&quot; The reviews were &quot;of an almost hysterical violence.&quot; He was attacked for his &quot;brutal, vulgar, and unnecessary art license.&quot; Even a critic who usually tried to be sympathetic to new art, James Gibbons Huneker, protested that the artist&#x27;s clever technique had left viewers with no real picture and made use of the adage, &quot;The operation was successful, but the patient died.&quot; As art historian Sam Hunter wrote, &quot;Weber&#x27;s wistful, tentative Cubism provided the philistine press with their first solid target prior to the Armory Show.&quot; 
Weber was sustained by the respect of some eminent peers, such as photographers Alvin Langdon Coburn and Clarence White, and museum director John Cotton Dana, who saw to it that Weber was the subject of a one-man exhibition at the Newark Museum in 1913, the first modernist exhibition in an American museum. For a few years, Weber enjoyed a productive if rocky relationship with Stieglitz, and he published two essays in Stieglitz&#x27;s journal &quot;Camera Work&quot;. (He also wrote Cubist poems and published a book, &quot;Essays on Art,&quot; in 1916.) So poor was Weber in these years that he camped out for some weeks in Stieglitz&#x27;s gallery. Weber was also closely acquainted with Wilhelmina Weber Furlong and Thomas Furlong, whom he met at the Art Students League, where he taught from 1919 to 1921 and 1926 to 1927. Weber died in Great Neck, New York in 1961. He was the subject of a major retrospective at the Jewish Museum in 1982.

Weber evidently was a prickly personality even with his allies. He and Stieglitz had a falling-out, and Weber was not represented in the famous Armory Show because his friend, Arthur B. Davies, one of the show&#x27;s organizers, had only allotted him space for two paintings. In a fit of pique at Davies, he withdrew entirely from the exhibition. Other artists in the Stieglitz circle kept their distance, especially after Weber told people that there were only three indisputably great modern painters: Cézanne, Rousseau, and himself. &quot;Almost without exception, they found him obnoxious: opinionated, rude, intolerant.&quot;

===Success===
In time, Weber&#x27;s work found more adherents, including Alfred H. Barr, Jr., the first director of the Museum of Modern Art. In 1930, the Museum of Modern Art held a retrospective of his work, the first solo exhibition at that museum of an American artist. He was praised as a &quot;pioneer of modern art in America&quot; in a 1945 &quot;Life&quot; magazine article. In 1948, &quot;Look&quot; magazine reported on a survey among art experts to determine the greatest living American artists; Weber was rated second, behind only John Marin. He was the subject of a major traveling retrospective in 1949. He became more popular in the 1940s and 1950s for his figurative work, often expressionist renderings of Jewish families, rabbis, and Talmudic scholars, than for the early modernist work he had abandoned circa 1920 and on which his current reputation is founded.

Not everyone believed that Weber fulfilled his early potential as he became a more representational and expressionist painter post-World War I. Critic Hilton Kramer wrote of him that, in light of the remarkable beginning of his career, &quot;Weber proved instead to be one of the great disappointments of twentieth-century American art.&quot; Others however, because of his bold &quot;Cubist decade,&quot; hold him in the same high regard as other native modernists like John Marin, Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, and Charles Demuth.

==Poetry==
While lecturing at the Clarence H. White School for Photography, Weber wrote his &quot;Cubist Poems&quot; that were to be published in 1914. 
In 1926, the artist released another collection entitled &quot;Primitives: Poems and Woodcuts.&quot; Weber designed the modernist-style binding for the book, as well as providing eleven woodcuts for the illustrations. First published by Spiral Press in a run of 350 copies, original editions are now rare.

&lt;poem&gt;:Cubes, cubes, cubes, cubes,
:High, low and high, and higher, higher,
:Far, far out, out, far..

:Billions of things upon things
:This for the eye, the eye of being,
:At the edge of the Hudson,
:Flowing timeless, endless,
:On, on, on, on...
:&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Anthony Dalton Roche AO MBE (born 17 May 1945) is an Australian former professional tennis player.

A native of Tarcutta, Roche played junior tennis in the New South Wales regional city of Wagga Wagga. He won one Grand Slam singles title, the 1966 French Open at Roland Garros, and 15 Grand Slam doubles titles.

In 1968, Roche won the WCT/NTL combined professional championship in men&#x27;s singles in the final event of the season at Madison Square Garden. He was ranked World No. 2 by Lance Tingay of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 1969.

He won the U.S. Pro Championships in 1970 at Longwood in Boston. Roche won the New South Wales Open twice, in 1969 and 1976. He won a key Davis Cup singles match in 1977.

He also coached multi-Grand Slam winning world No. 1s Ivan Lendl, Patrick Rafter, Roger Federer and Lleyton Hewitt as well as former World No. 4 Jelena Dokic.

==Playing career==
===Amateur===

Roche started to play tennis at school when he was nine. His father, who worked as a butcher, and his mother were both recreational tennis players and encouraged his interest. Roche grew up playing in Australia under the tutelage of Harry Hopman, who also coached other Australian tennis players such as Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall.

Roche had a successful singles and double career. He won one singles Grand Slam tournament, the 1966 French Open at Roland Garros, defeating István Gulyás in the final. He was five times the runner-up at Grand Slam tournaments: the French Championships in 1965 and 1967, losing to Fred Stolle and Roy Emerson respectively, Wimbledon in 1968, losing to Rod Laver, and the US Open in 1969 and 1970, losing to Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall. With compatriot John Newcombe, he won 12 Grand Slam men&#x27;s doubles tournaments.

===Professional===
In January 1968, Roche turned professional, signing with World Championship Tennis, joining other pros like John Newcombe, Cliff Drysdale, Nikola Pilić and Roger Taylor to form the &quot;Handsome Eight&quot;. Roche was guaranteed $125,000 annually, an amount equivalent to the annual salary of Willie Mays, the top paid baseball player.

Roche was the leading money winner on the WCT tour in 1968. In the 1968 final for the combined WCT/NTL professional tours at Madison Square Garden, Roche defeated Rod Laver in the semifinal and Pancho Gonzales in the final to become the combined professional champion for 1968.

Roche held a personal head-to-head edge over Laver during the latter&#x27;s Grand Slam season of 1969, 5 to 4. Roche and Laver played a classic match against each other in the 1969 Australian Open at Brisbane. Roche also contested the final match of Laver&#x27;s Grand Slam run that year, the 1969 U.S. Open final.

Roche won the U.S. Pro Championships at Longwood, Boston in 1970, defeating Laver in a hard fought five set final.
Roche won two New South Wales Open titles, in 1969 over Rod Laver in a close four-set final, and in 1976 against Dick Stockton in the final.

Perhaps one of his greatest achievements came in 1977, playing singles in the finals of the Davis Cup tournament versus Italy, nearly 10 years since he had last played for Australia. In the tie, Roche upset top Italian Adriano Panatta in three straight sets to lead Australia to a 3–1 victory, winning the Davis Cup.

Shoulder and elbow injuries cut short his career after having finished in the top 10 for six consecutive years.

==Coaching career==
After completing his playing career, Roche has developed a highly successful career as a tennis coach. He was the player-coach of the Denver Racquets who won the first World Team Tennis in competition 1974, and he was named WTT Coach of the Year. Ivan Lendl hired Roche in 1985 as a full-time coach for Roche&#x27;s advice on volleying. Lendl dreamed of winning Wimbledon, and because Roche had been a fine grass court player, he sought his tutelage. Roche also coached former world no. 1 Patrick Rafter from 1997 to the end of his career in 2002. Roche coached world no. 1 Roger Federer from 2005 to 12 May 2007. It is reputed this was on a &quot;handshake agreement&quot; with no contract; Roche was paid by the week. Federer hired Roche for the opposite reason that Lendl hired him: to work on his clay-court game (as Roche had won the 1966 French Championships). He also coached two-time Grand Slam singles titlist Lleyton Hewitt, who was aiming to get his career back on track after a number of unsuccessful years on the ATP Tour.

==Honours==
Roche was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1981 and an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 2001. He entered the International Tennis Hall of Fame alongside doubles partner and close friend John Newcombe in 1986. In 1990 he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. He received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000 and a Centenary Medal in 2001.

<text>Eric Clifford Drysdale (born 26 May 1941) is a South African former tennis player. After a career as a highly ranked professional player in the 1960s and early 1970s, he became a tennis announcer.

==Life and career==
Born Eric Clifford &#x27;Cliff&#x27; Drysdale in Nelspruit (today known as Mbombela, Mpumalanga Province, South Africa) on May 26, 1941 and completed his high school at Grey High School, Port Elizabeth.

Drysdale won the singles title at the Dutch Open in 1963 and 1964. In 1965, he reached the singles final of the 1965 U. S. Championships and he won the singles title at the German Championships. He defeated Rod Laver in the fourth round of the first US Open in 1968. During his Open-era career, Drysdale captured five singles titles and six doubles titles, including the 1972 US Open doubles crown with Roger Taylor. He was a pioneer of the two-handed backhand shot, which he used to great effect during his playing career.

Drysdale was included among the Handsome Eight, a group of players signed by Lamar Hunt in 1968 for the newly formed professional World Championship Tennis group. He became president of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), an association that Drysdale had formed in 1972 with Jack Kramer and Donald Dell.

Following retirement, Drysdale became a naturalized American citizen. He has been a tennis commentator for ESPN since the network&#x27;s inception in 1979. In 1998, the USTA awarded Drysdale the William M. Johnston award for his contribution to men&#x27;s tennis. In 2013, he was elected into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

<text>Thomas Samuel Okker (nicknamed &quot;the Flying Dutchman&quot;; born 22 February 1944) is a Dutch former tennis player who was active from the mid-1960s until 1980. He won the 1973 French Open Doubles, the 1976 US Open Doubles, and two gold medals at the 1965 Maccabiah Games in Israel. He was ranked among the world&#x27;s top-ten singles players for seven consecutive years, 1968–74, reaching a career high of world No. 3 in 1974. He also was ranked world No. 1 in doubles in 1979.

==Early life==
Okker was born in Amsterdam, is Jewish on his father&#x27;s side, and identifies as Jewish. Okker&#x27;s father was Jewish, and was imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II, but managed to go into hiding by assuming the papers and identity of another man.

==Tennis career==
He played his first tournament at Wolfsburg, West Germany, on clay in 1963. Okker was the Dutch champion from 1964 through 1968.

In 1968, his first year as a registered professional, he won in singles and in doubles (with Marty Riessen) at the Italian Open. At Wimbledon, Okker reached the quarterfinals in 1968 and the semifinals in 1978. He achieved his best result in a Grand Slam tournament at the 1968 US Open, where he competed as a registered professional player, a professional player allowed to compete for prize money but playing under the control of their national associations and eligible to play in Davis Cup. Okker reached the final after defeating Pancho Gonzales in the quarterfinal and Ken Rosewall in the semifinal. He lost the final to Arthur Ashe in five sets. Okker was awarded the first prize money at the 1968 U.S. Open, as Ashe was still considered an amateur player rather than a registered professional. In February 1969, Okker signed a four-year contract with the Lamar Hunt&#x27;s World Championship Tennis.

In his career, won 40 singles titles. He also was the runner-up in 37 singles tournaments.

Okker is also among the most successful men&#x27;s doubles players of all time. He won two Grand Slam doubles titles, at the US Open in 1976 (with Riessen) and the French Open (with John Newcombe) in 1973. In total, Okker won 68 doubles events, a record that was finally broken by Todd Woodbridge in 2005. Okker&#x27;s other doubles titles include the 1973 Italian Open, 1973 London Grass Courts (with Riessen), 1973 Spanish Open (with Ilie Năstase), 1975 Opel International (with Arthur Ashe), and 1978 WCT World Doubles (with Wojtek Fibak).

One of the first tennis professionals to win at least US$1 million in career prize money, Okker&#x27;s WTC career earnings stood at $1,257,200 when he retired in 1980 ($ today).

===Davis Cup===
Between 1964 and 1981, Okker represented the Netherlands in the Davis Cup, playing in 13 ties and accumulating a 15–20 win–loss record.

===Maccabiah Games===
In 1965, Okker won both the singles and the mixed doubles titles at the 1965 Maccabiah Games in Israel. This event is open to all Israelis and to non-Israeli Jews.

===Style of play===
He was among the first players of his era to hit the ball with heavy topspin.

==Halls of Fame==
Okker was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2003.

He was nominated for consideration in 2018, but not inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Okker and his wife Anna-Marie have three children together. Since the mid-1980s Okker has been involved in art and was a founding partner in the Jaski art gallery in Amsterdam, specializing in works of the CoBrA movement. In 2005, he founded art gallery Tom Okker Art bv in Hazerswoude-Dorp, Netherlands, where he now lives.

<doc id="870028" wikidata="Q2358537" url="?curid=870028" title="Reese's Pieces">
<text>Reese&#x27;s Pieces are a peanut butter candy manufactured by The Hershey Company; they are oblate spheroid in shape and covered in candy shells that are colored yellow, orange, or brown. They can be purchased in plastic packets, cardboard boxes, or cup-shaped travel containers. The Reese company was founded by H.B. Reese. The H.B. Reese Candy Company was merged with The Hershey Company in 1963.

==Overview==
The candy was introduced to the US market first in September 1978. Shortly after, Reese&#x27;s Pieces were introduced to the Canada market in 1980. 
The then relatively new product became very popular with the 1982 release of &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, in which the candy is featured.

Reese&#x27;s Pieces were introduced in the UK in 1996, but are produced in the US.

Reese&#x27;s Pieces are a product extension of the Reese&#x27;s Peanut Butter Cups line; they were designed to capitalize on the success of the chocolate-covered peanut butter cups, though unlike the cups, they have no chocolate.

==Variations==


Reese&#x27;s Pieces has been included in many Reese&#x27;s and Hershey&#x27;s products since its introduction. Below is a list of available products that contain Reese&#x27;s Pieces, from the candy pieces being stuffed inside of existing chocolate bar variations to bags of baking chip mixes.

==Production==

In the 1970s, the candies were produced by The Hershey Company using panning machines that had been used to make Hershey-ets, a chocolate-filled candy that had been discontinued. The candy was first called &quot;PBs&quot; and was later rechristened as Reese&#x27;s Pieces. Designers wanted a peanut-flavored candy but had problems with the filling. Original plans called for filling the candy shells with peanut butter, but the oil leaked out into the shell, leaving it soft, rather than crunchy.

The developer of the project turned the problem over to a team of outside scientists, who created a peanut-flavored penuche filling. More experimentation was needed to determine the correct thickness of the shell. Finally, the colors of the candy coating were designed to coordinate with the color of the Reese&#x27;s package. The color distribution goal is 50% orange, 25% brown, and 25% yellow.

==&quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;==
In 1982, the Mars candy bar company rejected a product placement offer for the inclusion of its key product M&amp;M&#x27;s in the Steven Spielberg film, &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. Hershey accepted an offer for use of Reese&#x27;s Pieces in the movie, and with the film&#x27;s blockbuster success its product sales dramatically increased, perhaps as much as 300%.

==Product line expansion==
In 2010, The Hershey Company expanded the &quot;Pieces&quot; line to include York Peppermint Pattie Pieces, Hershey&#x27;s Special Dark Pieces, and Almond Joy Pieces. Hershey&#x27;s Milk Chocolate with Almonds Pieces became the fourth expansion of this line in 2012.

<doc id="870042" wikidata="Q1780417" url="?curid=870042" title="Landsvirkjun">
<text>Landsvirkjun, () the National Power Company of Iceland, is Iceland&#x27;s largest electricity generator. Landsvirkjun operates 21 power plants in Iceland concentrated on five main areas of operation.

== History ==
Landsvirkjun was founded on 1 July 1965 by the state of Iceland and the city of Reykjavík. The city of Reykjavík contributed to the company three power stations on the Sog River. Shortly after its founding construction on the Búrfell hydropower station began. From 1965 until 2005 the purpose of Landsvirkjun was to produce and distribute high voltage electricity. The municipality of Akureyri acquired a 5% share in Landsvirkjun in 1983 and became the third owner. Three hydropower stations on the Laxá River previously owned by the municipality of Akureyri were merged into Landsvirkjun. The hydropower stations Búrfell, Sigalda, Hrauneyjafoss, Blanda, Sultartangi, Vatnsfell, and Fljótsdalsstöð were all built by Landsvirkjun. The geothermal power station Krafla came under Landsvirkjun&#x27;s ownership in 1985. Through a new electricity act in 2005 the company&#x27;s Transmission Division became Landsnet, an independent limited company and a subsidiary of Landsvirkjun. Landsnet owns and operates the Icelandic transmission system and manages the country&#x27;s electricity system. In 2007 the state of Iceland took over the ownership shares of Akureyri and Reykjavík in Landsvirkjun, turning it into a public partnership, fully owned by the state of Iceland. In December 2012, Landsvirkjun erected two wind turbines, in an area known as Hafið, within the construction area of Búrfell Power Station, in the south of Iceland. The turbines have a total of 2 MW of installed power.

== Power stations ==

Landsvirkjun has 21 power stations, of which 15 are hydropower stations, three geothermal power stations and two wind power field.

== Subsidiaries ==

Landsvirkjun has five subsidiaries:
* Landsnet (64.7% of shares are owned by Landsvirkjun) is the transmission system operator (TSO) of the Icelandic high-voltage electricity grid.
* Landsvirkjun Power uses Landsvirkjun&#x27;s knowledge to conduct consultancy projects in matters related to energy on the international market.
* Orkufjarskipti provides telecommunication services.
* Icelandic Power Insurance is a captive insurance company, which handles insurance and reinsurance for Landsvirkjun&#x27;s power stations and, in addition, supervises insurance for construction projects.
* Hraunaveita ehf. took on specific tasks in connection with the Kárahnjúkar Project, but now has no operations.

<doc id="870043" wikidata="Q511948" url="?curid=870043" title="Marsha Hunt (actress, born 1946)">
<text>Marsha Hunt (born April 15, 1946) is an American actress, novelist, singer and former model, who has lived mostly in Britain and Ireland. She achieved national fame when she appeared in London as Dionne in the long-running rock musical &quot;Hair&quot;. She enjoyed close relationships with Marc Bolan and Mick Jagger, who is the father of her only child, Karis Jagger.

Hunt has written three novels, as well as three volumes of autobiography, which include a frank account of life as a breast cancer sufferer.

==Early life==
Hunt was born in Philadelphia in 1946 and lived in North Philadelphia, near 23rd and Columbia, then in Germantown and Mount Airy, for the first 13 years of her life. Hunt told &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; that she remembers Philadelphia with affection, particularly the &quot;Philadelphia steak sandwiches and the bad boys on the basketball court&quot;.

Hunt&#x27;s mother, Inez, was her primary parent and worked as a librarian in a local library. Hunt&#x27;s father, Blaire Theodore Hunt Jr., was one of America&#x27;s first black psychiatrists but he did not live with Hunt; she found out when she was 15 years old that he had taken his own life three years previously. Hunt was brought up by her mother, her aunt, and her grandmother; three strong but very different women. Hunt describes her mother Inez as &quot;extremely intelligent and education-minded&quot;, her Aunt Thelma as &quot;extremely Catholic but very glamorous&quot;, and her grandmother Edna as an &quot;extremely aggressive...ass-kicking&quot; independent Southern woman.

Hunt credits the experience of having been poor with teaching her not to be materialistic. Her family put a great deal of emphasis on academic performance, and Hunt did very well in school. In 1960, the family moved to Kensington, California, which Hunt still regards as home, so that her brother and sister could attend Oakland High School and prepare to attend the University of California, Berkeley. Hunt also went to Berkeley, in 1964, where she joined Jerry Rubin on protest marches against the Vietnam War. In her book &quot;Undefeated&quot; she recalled that during her time at Berkeley they &quot;were sitting in for the Free Speech Movement, smoking pot, experimenting with acid, lining up to take Oriental philosophy courses, daring to co-habit, and going to dances in San Francisco.&quot;

==Move to London==
In February 1966, Hunt booked a flight for a brief trip to London, where she was temporarily detained before a fellow detainee gave her details of contacts, including John Shepherd, who worked on the television show &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;. Through Shepherd, she met Kenny Lynch, and then appeared as an extra in Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s film &quot;Blow-Up&quot;. Hunt has said that in London in the 1960s &quot;anything seemed possible.&quot;

She briefly lived in Edinburgh, Scotland, before returning to London where she became a backing singer with Alexis Korner&#x27;s trio Free at Last. She then met and began a short relationship with musician John Mayall, inspiring Mayall&#x27;s songs &quot;Marsha&#x27;s Mood&quot; and &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;. Although Hunt indicates that she had no great musical talent, she worked as a singer for 18 months after arriving in England, intending to earn her fare back home.

===Marriage to Mike Ratledge===
In late 1966, Hunt met Mike Ratledge of Soft Machine. Hunt was having trouble getting a visa extension to stay in England and proposed to Ratledge. Ratledge and Hunt were married on April 15, 1967. The Soft Machine were heavily booked and there was no time for a honeymoon, but Ratledge and Hunt were able to spend two months together before the band headed for France later that year. Hunt said in 1991 that she and Ratledge never held hands and never kissed, though &quot;...he comes for Easter. But that&#x27;s what we called &#x27;married&#x27;.&quot; While the two have remained good friends, Hunt says the secret to a happy marriage is to &quot;separate immediately.&quot; When Hunt and Ratledge reached their 40th wedding anniversary, Hunt called Ratledge up and said, jokingly, &quot;We should renew our vows.&quot; Ratledge died on 5 February 2025.

===Music career===
After her marriage in 1967, Hunt took a singing job with Long John Baldry&#x27;s band Bluesology, alongside keyboard player Reg Dwight, soon to be known as Elton John. She also auditioned for Ratledge&#x27;s band Soft Machine, and in 1968, briefly joined the group The Ferris Wheel.

That same year, Hunt achieved national fame in England when she appeared as &quot;Dionne&quot; in the rock musical &quot;Hair&quot;, a box-office smash on the London stage. Hunt only had two lines of dialogue in &quot;Hair&quot;, but she attracted a lot of media attention and her photo appeared in many newspapers and magazines. Her photograph was used on the poster and playbill of the original London production, photographed by Justin de Villeneuve. Her 1968 photo also replaced the original LP artwork when Reader&#x27;s Digest re-issued the LP in Europe in 1976. Hunt says that the role was a perfect fit for her, expressing who she actually was. She was one of three Americans featured in the London show, and when the show began she had no contract to perform. When the show opened she was featured in so many stories that she was offered a contract right away.

Hunt played at the Jazz Bilzen and Isle of Wight music festivals in August 1969 with her backup band &quot;White Trash&quot;. Hunt&#x27;s first single, a cover of Dr John&#x27;s &quot;Walk on Gilded Splinters&quot;, produced by Tony Visconti, was released on Track Records in 1969; it became a minor hit. An album, &quot;Woman Child&quot; (also produced by Tony Visconti) (in Germany released under the title &quot;Desdemona&quot;), followed in 1971. In May 1977, an album with disco songs was released in Germany with the title &quot;Marsha&quot;. It was recorded at Musicland Studios in Munich and produced by Pete Belotte (co-producer with Giorgio Moroder of many Donna Summer albums).

Hunt met Marc Bolan in 1969 when she went to the studio where Bolan&#x27;s group was recording &quot;Unicorn&quot;. Tony Visconti said that when Bolan and Hunt met, &quot;[y]ou could see the shafts of light pouring out of their eyes into each other... We finished the session unusually early, and Marc and Marsha walked out into the night hand in hand.&quot; According to Hunt, the relationship between the two was based on more than physical attraction, though she also recalled that her commercial visibility put her in opposition to Bolan&#x27;s philosophy that &quot;the serious art of music...was validated by obscurity.&quot;

In 1971, after the birth of her daughter Karis, she appeared for a while in the musical &quot;Catch My Soul&quot;, and acted alongside Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in the film &quot;Dracula A.D. 1972&quot;. She signed a recording contract with Phonogram Records, and led her own band, 22, which the record company insisted on billing as &quot;Marsha Hunt&#x27;s 22&quot;. The band included guitarist Hugh Burns, with whom Hunt lived for three years. The band toured, released two singles, &quot;Medusa&quot; and &quot;(Oh No! Not) The Beast Day&quot;, and recorded a set of demos of songs largely written by Hunt. These were later released in Germany and Poland as an album, &quot;Attention! Marsha Hunt&quot;, though Hunt was unaware of its release until a 2020 interview with her. The band 22 split up after they had their equipment stolen and Hunt&#x27;s daughter became ill.

From 1973, Hunt co-presented with Sarah Ward a popular late-night radio show, &quot;Sarah. Marsha and Friends&quot;, on London&#x27;s Capital Radio. Also in 1973, as a member of a panel organised by British magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot; to discuss women in music and options open to black women, Hunt suggested that black women needed to make use of the &quot;side-door&quot; in the industry, entering as &quot;the statutory representative&quot; before they could make music under their own terms.

In 1976, she released two funk-pop singles produced by Steve Rowland, and the following year issued an album, &quot;Marsha&quot;, produced by Pete Bellotte, which she later described as &quot;a musical departure that had nothing to do with my own taste&quot;. She moved to Los Angeles in the late 1970s, and fronted a punk rock-influenced band, Marsha &amp; The Vendettas. From there, she moved to Australia, and recorded a single, &quot;Pleasure Zone&quot;, written with David Dundas and produced by Ricky Fataar.

===Modelling===
Three months after &quot;Hair&quot; opened, Hunt was on the cover of British high-fashion magazine &quot;Queen&quot;, the first black model to appear on their cover. In 1968, Hunt posed nude for photographer Patrick Lichfield after the opening night for &quot;Hair&quot; and the photo appeared on the cover of British &quot;Vogue&quot;&#x27;s January 1969 issue. Almost 40 years later Hunt again posed nude for Lichfield, recreating the pose for her &quot;Vogue&quot; cover five weeks after she had had her right breast and lymph glands removed to halt the spread of cancer. The photo appeared on the cover of her 2005 book &quot;Undefeated&quot;, about her battle with cancer. She was pleased to work with the photographer under such differing circumstances, although in her autobiography she expressed confusion as to why the photo has been so often reprinted. Hunt has also been photographed by Lewis Morley and Horace Ové.

===Relationship with Mick Jagger===
Hunt said that she met Mick Jagger in 1969 when The Rolling Stones asked her to pose for an ad for &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;, which she refused to do because she &quot;didn&#x27;t want to look like [she&#x27;d] just been had by all the Rolling Stones.&quot; Jagger called her later, and their nine or 10-month affair began. According to Christopher Sanford&#x27;s book &quot;Mick Jagger: Rebel Knight&quot;, Hunt told journalist Frankie McGowan that Jagger&#x27;s shyness and awkwardness won her over, but that their relationship was conducted mostly in private because their social scenes were very different. According to Tony Sanchez in &quot;Up and Down with the Rolling Stones&quot;, Jagger considered proposing to Hunt but did not because he did not think he loved Hunt enough to spend the rest of his life with her, while Hunt, for her part, did not think they were sufficiently compatible to co-habit satisfactorily. The relationship ended in June 1970, when Hunt was pregnant with Jagger&#x27;s first child, Karis. According to Hunt, the pair planned the child but never intended to live together and the two agreed that Jagger would be an &quot;absent father&quot;. Karis was born in London, November 1970, Hunt&#x27;s only child.

In 1973, when Karis was two years old, Hunt asked the courts in London for an affiliation order against Jagger and eventually settled out of court. Jagger called the suit &quot;silly&quot;. He agreed to set up a trust fund for Karis until she reached 21 but he was allowed to deny his paternity on record. In 1978, Hunt filed a paternity suit in Los Angeles asking for $580 a week. At the time, Hunt was unemployed and received welfare payments from Aid to Dependent Children. In 1979, Hunt won the paternity suit, saying she wanted &quot;only to be able to say to my daughter, when she&#x27;s 21, that I didn&#x27;t allow her father to neglect his responsibilities&quot;. Jagger grew closer to Karis when she was 11 years old, legally, financially and personally. He paid for her education at a private secondary school and at Yale University and employed her in the Rolling Stones&#x27; infrastructure as a researcher on the &quot;25×5: the Continuing Adventures of the Rolling Stones&quot; documentary. Jagger took her on holiday with his family when she was a teenager, attended her Yale University graduation and her 2000 wedding, and he was at the hospital for the birth of her son in 2004. In 1991, Hunt indicated that she left the door open for Jagger to come back to his child and admired the fact that he did. In December 2012, Hunt sold a series of love letters written to her in the summer of 1969 by Mick Jagger. The letters were sold by Sotheby&#x27;s of London for £182,250 ($301,000).

===&quot;Brown Sugar&quot;===
Christopher Sanford writes in his book &quot;Mick Jagger&quot; that when the Rolling Stones released the song &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; there was immediate speculation that it referred to Hunt or to soul singer Claudia Lennear. In her autobiography, &quot;Real Life&quot; (1985), Hunt acknowledged that &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and a few other songs are about her, which she reiterated in her book &quot;Undefeated&quot; (2006). When Hunt was asked for an interview with the &quot;Irish Times&quot; in 2008 how she felt about the song, she said: &quot;it doesn&#x27;t make me feel any way at all.&quot; However, Rolling Stones&#x27; bassist Bill Wyman stated in his book, &quot;Rolling With The Stones&quot; (2002), that the lyrics were partially inspired by Lennear. In 2014, Lennear told &quot;The Times&quot; that the song is about her because she was dating Jagger when he wrote it. Hunt was also the titular dedicatee Marsha in Robert Wyatt&#x27;s song &quot;To Carla, Marsha and Caroline (For Making Everything Beautifuller)&quot; from his album &quot;The End of an Ear&quot;.

==Writing==

===Autobiography===
Hunt began writing in 1985, and her first book was her autobiography, &quot;Real Life: The Story of a Survivor&quot; (1986). She found the process of writing more difficult than she expected, but did not stop there, continuing in 1996 with another autobiography, &quot;Repossessing Ernestine: A Granddaughter Uncovers the Secret History of Her American Family&quot;, about her search for her father&#x27;s mother Ernestine who was placed in an asylum for nearly 50 years. After Hunt&#x27;s father committed suicide when she was 12-years old, Hunt&#x27;s contact with her father&#x27;s family was sporadic. Hunt tracked down her father&#x27;s father Blair Hunt shortly before he died in 1978 to find him living sedately in a seedy part of town with his companion of 60 years. Hunt discovered that her grandfather had been a public school administrator and a leading member of Memphis&#x27;s black community. Blair Hunt talked about his &quot;poor dear sick wife&quot; who he had &quot;put away&quot; many years before. Hunt discovered that her father&#x27;s mother, Ernestine, had been born in 1896 and that she grew up in Memphis, &quot;an intelligent, remarkably beautiful young woman who excelled in school and was greatly envied for her pale skin, blue eyes and blonde hair.&quot; Hunt tracked her grandmother down to a rundown nursing home, and although Hunt was unable to discover why Ernestine spent 50 years behind bars, Hunt wrote that the reasons may have had more to do with racism and sexism than insanity.

In 2005, Hunt released her memoir about her battle with cancer, &quot;Undefeated&quot;.

===Novelist===
In 1990, Hunt published her first novel, &quot;Joy&quot;, about a woman who grew up to join a singing group reminiscent of The Supremes before dying an early death. Set in a posh New York apartment in the course of one day in the spring of 1987, the novel contains frequent flashbacks that describe life in a black neighbourhood in the 1950s and 1960s. The book also deals with stardom in the music business and some people&#x27;s inability, despite their riches, to make their own American Dream come true and to lead fulfilled lives. Hunt indicates that within her novel, all the characters are victims who are also guilty, a reflection of real life where &quot;[w]e get hurt, but we&#x27;re also hurting each other all the time.&quot; Hunt wrote &quot;Joy&quot; while touring England with a group performing &quot;Othello&quot; and said her fellow actors made fun of her while she was writing the book; given her reputation, she feels, they may have thought her an aspiring Joan Collins. Hunt says &quot;Joy&quot; is also about the colourism that existed within black society at the time, where girls with fairer skin and longer hair were preferred to girls with kinky hair and more stereotypically Black characteristics. Hunt said that living in England and exploring its accents taught her how beautiful Black language was, a &quot;culturally important&quot; feature she preserved in her novel.

Hunt&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Free&quot;, published in 1992, tells the story of freed slaves and their children living in Germantown, Pennsylvania, in 1913. Hunt&#x27;s novel &quot;Like Venus Fading&quot; (1998) is inspired by the lives of Adelaide Hall, known as the &quot;lightly-tanned Venus&quot;, Josephine Baker and Dorothy Dandridge.

Hunt wrote her first four books whilst living in isolation in a remote hideaway in France called &quot;La montagne&quot;. With no one for company but a barn cat who came to eat each morning, and the people she saw once a day at a nearby &quot;patisserie&quot;, she was inspired to write by silence and boredom.

===Editor===
In 1999, Hunt sought a job of writer-in-residence at Dublin&#x27;s Mountjoy Prison and later collected selected writings from the prisoners and edited &quot;The Junk Yard: Voices From An Irish Prison&quot;. The book contains 15 stories divided into five sections: Childhood, Family Life, The Score, Criminal Life and Prison Life. One publisher was critical of the repetitive themes of urban poverty, addiction, and life in prison, but Hunt responded by asserting that it is worth considering why the inmates had such similar tales to tell. &quot;The Junk Yard: Voices From An Irish Prison&quot; became a number-one bestseller in Ireland in 1999.

===Activist===
In 1995, Hunt set up the Saga Prize, to unearth new British-born black literary talent and recognise the literature emerging from indigenous black Britons&#x27; experiences. Awarded to &quot;the best unpublished novel by a writer born in Great Britain or The Republic of Ireland having a black African ancestor&quot;, the prize, while attracting criticism from the Commission for Racial Equality, ran for four years until 1998, winners including Diran Adebayo and Joanna Traynor.

During the 1997 Edinburgh International Book Festival, Hunt staged a one-woman protest, picketing Charlotte Square about the &quot;shoddy administration&quot; of the festival. The director of the festival was fired in the aftermath of her protest.

===Other projects===
Hunt has said that she is writing a book about Jimi Hendrix that she considers her life work. She indicates that no one alive can share her perspective on the matter, &quot;because he and I shared something – black Americans who came to London were transformed and repackaged for the U.S., although I never became successful there and he did.&quot; No release date has been given.

==Acting==

===Theatre===
In 1971, Hunt played Bianca in &quot;Catch My Soul&quot;, the rock-and-roll stage version of &quot;Othello&quot; produced by Jack Good. In 1973, she wrote, produced and directed a new London show entitled &quot;Man to Woman&quot;, the music from which was released on vinyl in 1982 by Virgin Records, featuring vocals by Robert Wyatt. In 1975, Hunt appeared as Sabina in &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;. In 1991, Hunt appeared as Nurse Logan in the world premiere of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Ride Down Mount Morgan&quot; at London&#x27;s Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre. Hunt became a member of the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company.

In 1994, Hunt performed a one-woman play in Scotland at the Edinburgh Festival playing Baby Palatine, a 60-year-old woman who becomes the wardrobe mistress to a female pop group. The play is based on Hunt&#x27;s novel &quot;Joy&quot; (1990). Hunt was directed in the play by her daughter Karis Jagger, who has said that it was her mother&#x27;s idea. Jagger says that the pair &quot;spent six weeks rehearsing in France. Because the weather was so good we marked out the shape of the stage with my teddy bears and rehearsed in the garden.&quot;

===Film===
Hunt&#x27;s film career included appearances in &quot;Dracula A.D. 1972&quot; (1972), &quot;Britannia Hospital&quot; (1982) directed by Lindsay Anderson, &quot;The Sender&quot; (1982), &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983), &quot;Howling II: Your Sister Is a Werewolf&quot; (1985), and &quot;Tank Malling&quot; (1989).

===Television===
In 1988, Hunt played Elvi Rogers in &quot;The Play on One: Unreported Incident&quot;. In 1990, Hunt played Bianca in the BBC television production of &quot;Othello&quot; directed by Trevor Nunn.

===Documentaries===
In 1997, when Irish documentary filmmaker Alan Gilsenan made &quot;God Bless America&quot;, featuring six American cities seen through the eyes of six American authors, Hunt was invited to participate, and her participation resulted in &quot;Marsha Hunt&#x27;s Philadelphia&quot;. According to Gilsenan, Hunt attributes the success of American democracy and capitalism to the crime of slavery, a crime that must be understood if America is to have peace. Hunt fell in love with Gilsenan and moved to the Wicklow mountains near Dublin with him, where in 1999 she helped him fight colon cancer, drawing on her own experiences with the disease. Hunt is no longer romantically involved with Gilsenan, who has since married and fathered a child, but as of 2008 still sees him.

Hunt has also been the subject of a documentary, &quot;Beating Breast Cancer&quot; on ITV, broadcast on September 26, 2005.

==Cancer==
In late 2004, Hunt was diagnosed with breast cancer and was told to have surgery to remove her right breast and her lymph nodes. Hunt postponed seeking treatment for five months, later wondering if she would have faced first stage rather than third stage cancer had she not. When she chose to have surgery, she decided to have it done in Ireland, because she felt that the Irish are more supportive and comfortable with illness than people in the U.S.; she envisaged that treatment in the U.S. would feel impersonal. Hunt decided to have a complete mastectomy with no following reconstruction. She says, &quot;Reconstruction – as if the breast is miraculously put back to the way it was. In fact, pretty much all you get is your cleavage back; you don&#x27;t get any feeling or sensitivity... They take muscles from your back, skin from your thighs, fat from your stomach. You had a breast removed, but the rest of you was fine. Now half your body is hacked about – and for what?&quot; On the day of her operation Hunt wrote a note on her breast to the surgical team, telling them to have fun, make sure they took the right breast off and drew them a flower.

Once the operation was over Hunt says she did not mourn the loss of her breast, but felt happy that the cancer had been removed. Her view of the experience of mastectomy states that the surgery left her with a &quot;battle scar&quot; that makes her feel sexier, as it is a memento of what she has survived.
In July 2007 Hunt spoke about her breast removal with a 12-year-old boy, telling him that she is now like the Amazons of old who would have a breast removed so that when they went into battle they could use their bow without their breast getting in the way when they let their arrows fly.

After her mastectomy, she contracted the superbug MRSA and had to be treated with Zyvox. She also had chemotherapy. Not wanting to wait for her hair to fall out naturally, she decided to control it herself, throwing a party where her guests took turns cutting off locks of her hair.

The &quot;Irish Independent&quot; reported on August 27, 2008, that Hunt stood on a table at the opening of the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin to let everyone see that she had survived third-stage breast cancer after a treatment of chemotherapy, radiation, and Herceptin therapy at the hospital.

==Personal life==
Hunt says that the biggest misconception people have about her is that she is wealthy, though she describes herself as &quot;rich in spirit&quot;. Hunt has been true to her belief that wealth is not necessary for happiness and has lived the &quot;writing life&quot; for the past two decades. She enjoys the solitude of living on her own and finds that being single means she has encounters and experiences that she would not have if she were part of a couple, where others might choose not to intrude and where she would have to co-ordinate her schedule with another. Hunt has lived in Ireland since 1995. She also lives in France, where she owns a home in the countryside about 60 miles from Paris.

===Self-identity===
When Hunt came to live in Europe she found that people there called her an American, not an African American or Black. She herself describes her skin colour as &quot;oak with a hint of maple&quot;, and notes that &quot;[o]f the various races I know I comprise—African, American Indian, German Jew and Irish—only the African was acknowledged.&quot; Hunt invented her own word to describe herself, based on the French word &quot;melange&quot; (mixture) and the word melanin: Melangian.

Hunt said in 1991 that there is a pain inflicted by the black community on itself, which it fears to communicate openly. She also says that living overseas for most of her life has made her a foreigner in the US. She said, &quot;I&#x27;m scared to walk through Harlem... more scared than you, because if I walked through Harlem with the weird shoes and the weird accent, I&#x27;d get my butt kicked faster than you. In a way, I&#x27;m the betrayer.&quot;

Hunt is featured in the National Museum of African American History and Culture, a Smithsonian Institution museum in Washington D.C., that opened in 2016 at a ceremony led by then President Barack Obama.

<text>Alphanumeric Television Interface Controller (ANTIC) is an LSI ASIC dedicated to generating 2D computer graphics to be shown on a television screen or computer display.

Under the direction of Jay Miner, the chip was designed in 1977–1978 by Joe Decuir, Francois Michel, and Steve Smith for the Atari 8-bit computers first released in 1979. The chip was patented by Atari, Inc. in 1981. ANTIC is also used in the 1982 Atari 5200 video game console, which shares most of the same hardware as the 8-bit computers.

For every frame of video, ANTIC reads instructions to define the playfield, or background graphics, then delivers a data stream to the companion CTIA or GTIA chip which adds color and overlays sprites (referred to as &quot;Player/Missile graphics&quot; by Atari). Each ANTIC instruction corresponds to either blank scan lines or one of 14 graphics modes used for a horizontal band of the display. The height of each band depends on the mode. The instructions comprise a display list, in Atari parlance, which specifies how the entire display is built from a stack of individual modes.

The display list specifies where the data for each row comes from. For character modes, the base address of the character bitmaps is stored in an on-chip register and can be changed. Display list instructions can enable horizontal and vertical fine scrolling and mark that an interrupt should occur. An interrupt allows arbitrary 6502 code to execute, usually to change display-related settings in the middle of a frame.

Atari computer magazine &quot;Antic&quot; was named after the chip.

== Features ==
The list below describes ANTIC&#x27;s inherent hardware capabilities meaning the intended functionality of the hardware by itself, not including results achieved by CPU-serviced interrupts or display kernels frequently driving register changes.

ANTIC uses DMA to read a program called the display list which specifies these playfield features:
* 14 different graphics modes
** 6 character modes 
*** 4 types of font/glyph rendering
** 8 bitmapped modes
* Output a variable number of blank scan lines
* Playfield Text and Map modes can be mixed onscreen
* Variable screen height up to vertical overscan
* Horizontal and Vertical coarse scrolling
* Identify sections of the display subject to Horizontal and/or Vertical Fine scrolling
* Trigger a CPU-serviced interrupt routine, called the &quot;Display List Interrupt&quot;, at specific scan lines (also called &quot;raster interrupt&quot; or &quot;Horizontal Blank Interrupt&quot; on other systems)
* Trigger a CPU-serviced interrupt routine, called the &quot;Vertical Blank Interrupt&quot;, at the end of the display frame.

Other register-based functions:
* Variable screen width up to horizontal overscan
* Define the distance of movement for Horizontal and Vertical Fine scrolling
* Provides real-time information of the electron beam&#x27;s vertical screen location. 
* Reads a light pen horizontal/vertical coordinates (CRT only)
* Soft, re-definable character set.
* Adjustable display of inverse video characters.
* Characters may be vertically reflected.
* Control the display-oriented Vertical Blank and Display List interrupts, and the Reset key interrupt.
* Performs DMA for CTIA/GTIA to produce Player/Missile graphics (aka sprites)
* Non-fixed RAM. This allows RAM for graphics features to be located almost anywhere in the 16-bit memory address range. This applies to: 
** Display lists.
** Playfield graphics data
** Character set fonts
** Player/Missile graphics data

== Versions ==

* C012296 — NTSC: Used in Atari 400, 800, and 1200XL computers.
* C014887 — PAL/SECAM: Used in Atari 400 and 800 computers.
* C021697 — NTSC: Used in Atari 600XL, 800XL, and XE models.
* C021698 — PAL/SECAM: Used in Atari XL, and XE models.

Atari, Inc. intended to combine functions of the ANTIC and GTIA chips in one integrated circuit to reduce production costs of Atari computers and 5200 consoles. Two such prototype circuits were being developed, but neither entered production.

* C020577 — CGIA
* C021737 — KERI

== Pinout ==

== Registers ==
The Atari 8-bit computers and the Atari 5200 console map the ANTIC chip to the $D4xxhex page.

ANTIC provides 15 Read/Write registers controlling Playfield display parameters, DMA for Player/Missile graphics, fine scrolling, light pen input, and interrupts. Hardware registers do not return the written values back when read. This problem is solved by Operating System Shadow registers implemented in regular RAM as places to store the last value written to registers. Operating System Shadow registers are copied from RAM to the hardware registers during the vertical blank. Therefore, any writes to hardware registers which have corresponding shadow registers will be overwritten by the value of the Shadow registers during the next vertical blank.

Some Write hardware registers do not have corresponding Shadow registers. They can be safely written by an application without the value being overwritten during the vertical blank. If the application needs to know the last state of the register then it is the responsibility of the application to remember what it wrote.

Operating System Shadow registers also exist for some Read registers where reading the value directly from hardware at an unknown stage in the display cycle may return inconsistent results.

In the individual register listings below the following legend applies:
=== DMACTL $D400 Write ===
SHADOW: SDMCTL $022F

Direct Memory Access (DMA) Control

DMACTL controls ANTIC&#x27;s DMA behavior for the Playfield and Player-Missile (sprite) graphics.

Playfield Width bit values:
Also see Display List DMA bit regarding Playfield display.

Player/Missile DMA bits values:
ANTIC&#x27;s Player/Missile DMA feature reads bytes from memory and delivering data to update CTIA/GTIA&#x27;s GRAFP0, GRAFP1, GRAFP2, GRAFP3, and GRAFM graphics pattern registers relieving the CPU from creating Player/Missile (sprite) graphics. These bits turn on ANTIC&#x27;s transmission of Player data and Missile data to CTIA/GTIA. CTIA/GTIA must also be configured to receive the data via its GRACTL register in order for Player/Missile DMA to function as expected.

When Player DMA is enabled, Missile DMA automatically occurs to keep the DMA timing consistent, but the data is not delivered to the Missile&#x27;s GRAFM register.

When enabled, Player/Missile DMA occurs on every scan line in the visible display—from scan line 8 to 247. Therefore, the Player/Missile data in the memory map (see ANTIC&#x27;s PMBASE) above and below those scan line counts is unused and undisplayed.

Player/Missile Resolution bit values:
* $00 - Double line resolution. ANTIC updates its DMA fetch address every other scan line and updates the CTIA/GTIA Player/Missile Graphics pattern registers every scan line, so that each Player/Missile byte pattern is two scan lines tall. When Double line resolution is enabled CTIA/GTIA register VDELAY ($D01Chex/53276dec) works by masking updates on even scan lines which results in shifting the bit pattern of individual Players and Missiles down one scan line. 
* $10 - Single line resolution. A DMA fetch and Player/Missile register update occurs on every scan line. CTIA/GTIA register VDELAY ($D01Chex/53276dec) which masks updates on even scan lines effectively reduces Single line resolution to Double line resolution.

ANTIC DMA and Player/Missile pattern register updates occur on each scan line regardless of resolution. When Double line resolution is in effect the Player/Missile memory can be modified between the redundant DMA fetches thus changing the pattern sent to the GRAF* registers and producing apparent Single line resolution Player/Missiles.

Display List DMA bit values:
* $00 - Disable Display List.
* $20 - Enable Display list.

Playfield display requires that Display List DMA is enabled, and a Playfield width specified. If either value is zero, then no Playfield display is generated.

=== CHACTL $D401 Write ===
SHADOW: CHART $02F3

Character Control

CHACTL controls character display.

Character control bit values do the following actions:

The CHACTL Video Inverse and Video Blank bits affect the display of characters in ANTIC Text Modes 2 and 3 which have the high bit set (characters $80 through $FF). Toggling the values of the CHACTL bits allow blinking or blanking these characters globally for the entire display.

Video Inverse and Video Blank enabled together result in reverse video characters displayed as an inverse blank space. Video Inverse and Video Blank bits work in ANTIC modes 2 and 3, and have no effect on the other text modes 4, 5, 6, and 7.

The Video Reflect bit affects all Text Modes. Video Reflect is useful for situations requiring mirroring effects without defining a new character set. An ideal use is card games displaying accurate card faces showing upside down suits. As this vertically mirrors the glyph data before it is used, the effect appears inconsistent for ANTIC Mode 3 descenders with glyph bytes 6 and 7 appearing at the bottom of the descender area.

=== DLISTL/DLISTH $D402/$D403 Write ===
SHADOW: SDLSTL/SDLSTH $0230/$0231

Display List Pointer

ANTIC begins executing the Display List pointed to by the 16-bit address in registers DLISTL/DLISTH (D402-D403hex/54274-54275dec). The address registers are updated during Display List execution by ANTIC&#x27;s JMP (Jump) and JVB (Jump and wait for Vertical Blank). The address is also updated by the Operating System&#x27;s Vertical Blank Interrupt (VBI) routine using the values in shadow registers SDLSTL/SDLSTH (0230-0231hex/560-561dec).

When the OS Vertical Blank Interrupt is enabled, direct updates to the ANTIC DLIST registers by the CPU or the ANTIC Jump instructions will be overwritten by the OS during the next Vertical Blank by the values in the shadow registers. Therefore, page flipping implemented by Display Lists that point to the next Display List in series will not operate as expected unless the Vertical Blank interrupt is disabled.

=== HSCROL $D404 Write ===
Horizontal Fine Scroll

This register specifies the distance of the Horizontal fine scrolling shift in color clocks. Only the lowest 4 bits are significant. The value range of 16 color clocks allows ANTIC to shift Mode 2 Text four characters, and Mode 6 text two characters before a coarse scroll is needed.

When Horizontal scrolling is enabled for a mode line ANTIC fetches the next size increment greater than the current screen width to provide the buffer of data subject to the horizontal scrolling control. When displaying Narrow width ANTIC fetches the screen RAM needed for Normal width. Likewise, for Normal width ANTIC fetches the screen RAM needed for Wide.

ANTIC buffers the first few bytes read from screen memory that are sufficient to cover the 16 color clock range of movement. (Two to four bytes depending on display mode.) The HSCROL value specifies how many color clocks should be output from the buffered data beginning from the last (right most) color clock of the last buffered byte and progressing to the left. When HSCROL is 0 no color clocks are output from the buffer, so the first screen byte displayed is the first byte after the buffered data. As HSCROL increases more color clocks from the end (right side) of the buffered data are added to the left edge of the display causing the fine scroll shift to move the screen contents to the right.

ANTIC Mode F (high-resolution, 1/2 color clock pixels) can only be scrolled two pixels at a time, because HSCROL specifies color clocks.

ANTIC Modes using the alternate GTIA color interpretations must be scrolled by an entire GTIA pixel (two color clocks). Only even values should be used to ensure correct scrolling. Odd values of HSCROL will shift the pixel stream into a different state that GTIA will interpret as different colors.

Unlike many platforms Atari&#x27;s horizontal scrolling is visually consistent and free from color &quot;strobing&quot; artifacts due to Atari&#x27;s pixel size matching the color clock timing needed for accurate color.

=== VSCROL $D405 Write ===
Vertical Fine Scroll

This register specifies the distance of the Vertical fine scrolling in scan lines. The lowest 4 bits are significant, however the Vertical scroll value should range from 0 to the ANTIC Mode line&#x27;s scan line height - 1. Scrolling farther than the ANTIC Mode&#x27;s number of scan lines results in lines of repeated data upsetting the fine scrolling continuity (though, this can also be used as an exploitable behavior).

The Vertical scrolling region is defined by setting the VS bit ($20) on a sequential series of ANTIC Mode Lines in the Display List. The first Mode line without the VS bit set becomes the end of the scrolling region and is used as a buffer line to supply the new information to scroll up into the bottom of the scrolling region.

The Vertical scroll value indicates the scan line number to begin the display in the first Mode line and is also used as the scan line number to end the display in the last Mode line (the line without the VS bit set).

Example: Given an eight scan line ANTIC Mode (Text Modes 2, 4, or 6) with the VS bit set on two adjacent Mode lines the scrolling region then consists of three Mode lines—the third line in the scrolling region is the first Mode line encountered without the VS bit set. When Vertical scrolling is not set in the Display List the three Modes lines would naturally result in 24 displayed scan lines. When the VS bits are set in the Display List Mode instructions as described and the VSCROL value is set to 2 then the first Mode line in the region begins displaying at scan line 2 showing scan lines 2 to 7 (six scan lines or 8 - VSCROL), the second Mode line is displayed completely (eight scan lines), and the final Mode line ends at scan line 2 showing scan lines 0 to 2 (three scan lines or VSCROL + 1). The total scan lines displayed in the scrolling region is then 6 + 8 + 3 = 17 scan lines.

Since fine scrolling is based on scan lines not pixel height, and scrolling region movement is done simply by skipping scan lines from the first Mode line and adding scan lines to the last Mode line, it is possible to use different graphics Modes within the scrolling region. This merely requires additional care when determining how many scan lines can be shifted for the current first and last Mode lines in the scrolling region.

Blank Mode lines cannot be contained within a scrolling region, because Blank Mode line instructions inherently do not have a Vertical Scroll Modifier bit. (Blank Mode line instructions specify the blank line count using the bits 7 through 5 that function as LMS, HS, and VS Modifiers for &quot;regular&quot; Playfield Mode instructions.) However, a Blank Mode instruction can be used to end a scrolling region and is still subject to the expected scan line height changes per the vertical scroll value.

=== PMBASE $D407 Write ===
Player Missile Base Address

This specifies the page of the base address for Player/Missile graphics. When double line resolution P/M graphics are operating the PMBASE value must begin on a 1K boundary. When single line resolution P/M graphics are operating the PMBASE value must begin on a 2K boundary.

=== CHBASE $D409 Write ===
SHADOW: CHBAS $02F4

Character Base Address

This specifies the page of the base address for the character set. ANTIC Modes 2, 3, 4, and 5 use 128 characters in the character set and require the CHBASE value begin on a 1K boundary. ANTIC Modes 6 and 7 use 64 characters, so the CHBASE value must begin on a 512 byte boundary.

The usual default value is $E0hex/224dec for the character set in ROM at $E000hex/57344dec.

=== WSYNC $D40A Write ===
Wait For Horizontal Sync

This register allows programs to synchronize to the display. A write to this register halts the 6502 program through the end of the current scanline. This behavior is commonly used during Display List Interrupts to produce clean transitions/changes from one scanline to the next. The value written is unimportant.

=== VCOUNT $D40B Read ===
Vertical Line Counter

This register tracks the scan line currently being generated. The value returned is the actual scan line divided by 2. Blank lines generated at the start of the display are included. The value for NTSC will range from 0 to 130 for NTSC, and 0 to 155 for PAL. This value is useful during Display List Interrupts to identify the vertical screen position.

=== PENH $D40C Read ===
SHADOW: LPENH $0234

Light Pen Horizontal Position

This contains the horizontal color clock position when the light pen/light gun trigger is pressed. The shadow register is the recommended source for reading this information, since it will be updated during the vertical blank guaranteeing consistent and reliable results. Programs should avoid reading the hardware register directly unless the program is certain the register is read at a time insuring the value is valid. Light guns for the Atari function the same way as light pens with the addition of an optical magnifier allowing the screen to be read from a greater distance. The light pen/light gun input device requires a conventional CRT using a scanning electron beam. The light pen/light gun cannot work with modern LCD TVs and monitors.

=== PENV $D40D Read ===
SHADOW: LPENV $0235

Light Pen Vertical Position

This contains the VCOUNT value captured when the light pen/light gun trigger is pressed. The shadow register is the recommended source for reading this information, since it will be updated during the vertical blank guaranteeing consistent and reliable results. Programs should avoid reading the hardware register directly unless the program is certain the register is read at a time insuring the value is valid. Light guns for the Atari function the same way as light pens with the addition of an optical magnifier allowing the screen to be read from a greater distance. The light pen/light gun input device requires a conventional CRT using a scanning electron beam. The light pen/light gun cannot work with modern LCD TVs and monitors.

=== NMIEN $D40E Write ===
Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) Enable

NMIEN enables Non-Maskable Interrupts. The bit values:

The Operation System sets NMIEN to the default $40hex/64dec during the power up routines. The NMI service routines first vector through $FFFAhex/65530dec which determines the cause and then transfers control to the interrupt service routine.

DLI:

If NMIEN&#x27;s DLI bit is set when ANTIC encounters a Display List instruction with the DLI modifier bit set, then ANTIC triggers the DLI on the last scan line of that Display List instruction mode line.

The Operating System does not use DLIs, so the default address for the DLI vector (VDSLST, $0200hex/512dec) points to an RTI instruction in ROM. The application using DLIs must alter VDSLST to point to the desired DLI routine before enabling the DLI.

The 6502 Accumulator, X and Y register contents are not preserved before entry to the DLI routine. It is the responsibility of the DLI routine to save the state of the registers that will be used during the DLI routine, and then the last action is to restore the original values of the registers before exiting with an RTI instruction. Routines typically push the register values to the 6502 stack.

If multiple DLIs are used the first interrupt updates VDSLST to point to the address of the next interrupt, and so on for subsequent interrupts. The last Display List Interrupt routine on the screen points VDSLST back to the address of the first Display List Interrupt. Alternatively, a Vertical Blank Interrupt routine can be used to reset the VDSLST address to guarantee the DLIs remain in sync with the screen.

VBI:

When NMIEN&#x27;s VBI bit is set, ANTIC will signals a Vertical Blank Interrupt at the end of processing the JVB (Jump vertical blank) at the end of the Display List. The Operating System uses the Vertical Blank to perform various housekeeping chores (among other things - updating timers, copying controller input values to their Shadow registers, and copying the contents of Shadow registers to the custom chips hardware registers.)

The OS jumps through VVBLKI ($0222hex/546dec) to begin the OS VBI Service Routine, and the OS VBI Routine exits with a jump through VVBLKD ($0224hex/548dec). By default VVBLKI points to the OS jump vector SYSVBV ($E45Fhex/58463dec) to begin the Vertical Blank Interrupt, and VVBLKD points to the OS jump vector XITVBV ($E462hex/58466dec).

User programs can insert execution of custom code either before (Immediate) or after (Deferred) the Operating System&#x27;s Vertical Blank Interrupt routines. Since the OS Vertical Blank interrupt could be called while a user program is updating the vectors, the Operating system provides a routine, SETVBV ($E45Chex/58460dec), that will safely update the VVBLKI or VVBLKD vectors to point to a new routine:

* To set a new jump target for VVBLKI (Immediate) set the Y register to the low byte of the target address, the X register to the high byte of the target address, and the Accumulator to 6, then JSR SETVBV. The user code called through VVBLKI simply needs to exit by jumping to the OS Vertical Blank with a JMP SYSVBV ($E45Fhex/58463dec).
* To set a new jump target for VVBLKD (Deferred) set the Y register to the low byte of the target address, the X register to the high byte of the target address, and the Accumulator to 7, then JSR SETVBV.. The user code called through VVBLKD must exit by jumping to the OS Vertical Blank exit routine with a JMP XITVBV ($E462hex/58466dec).

When the CRITIC flag ($42hex/66dec) is non-zero execution of the Deferred Vertical Blank interrupt is suppressed regardless of the addresses in the vectors. The default value of CRITIC, 0, allows execution of both Immediate and Deferred Vertical Blank Interrupts.

=== NMIRES $D40F Write ===
Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) Reset

Any value written to NMIRES resets the bits in NMIST which indicate the reason for the most recent Non-Maskable Interrupt. This is used by interrupt dispatch code in the Operating System and there would ordinarily not be a reason for a user program to write here.

=== NMIST $D40F Read ===
Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) Status

The Operating System&#x27;s Non-Maskable Interrupt dispatch routine reads this register to determine the reason for the interrupt and so which service routine to execute.

The bit values:

* $20 - Reset key interrupt
* $40 - Vertical Blank Interrupt 
* $80 - Display List Interrupt

== Display list ==
The display list is the list of instructions directing ANTIC how to generate the display. The data processed by this Display List &quot;program&quot; is the screen memory. The output is the graphics display. The kinds of graphics in the output (text vs addressable pixels) is determined by the instructions in the Display List.

The display List and the display data are written into RAM by the CPU. ANTIC reads the display List instructions, screen memory, and character set information from RAM using a technique known as direct memory access (DMA). A BASIC or 6502 machine language program&#x27;s job is to initialize the display—set up the display List instructions, organize screen memory (and character set if applicable), and then direct ANTIC to start the display. After this, ANTIC automatically takes care of generating the screen display. This allows the Atari 8-bit computers to produce complex, mixed-mode displays without direct CPU intervention. Other platforms, even those designed much later, cannot either mix graphics modes in one display, or do so without complex CPU interrupts.

ANTIC processes the instructions in the display List, reads the screen memory (and character set data if applicable), translates this information into a real-time stream of graphics data, and sends this data stream to the CTIA/GTIA chip which applies the color to the graphics pixels and outputs the video. Together the two chips provide 6 text and 8 graphics modes (14 total). The more advanced version, GTIA, adds three alternative color interpretations for each ANTIC graphics mode providing a total of 56 (14 times four) graphics modes. However, only the ANTIC graphics modes based on half-color clock pixels are capable of expressing the complete color palette provided by the new color interpretations, and of those modes the ones convenient for use are ANTIC modes 2 (OS Graphics mode 0 text) and ANTIC mode F (OS Graphics mode 8). Thus the reasonable number of unique graphics modes available using the inherent hardware capabilities of ANTIC + CTIA/GTIA is 20–14 ANTIC modes + 3 additional color interpretations each for ANTIC modes 2 and F.

=== Display list instruction overview ===
The Atari display is built as a series of ANTIC instructions each describing a line of text or graphics mode progressively from the top to the bottom of the screen until the desired display area is filled. In effect, the screen is a vertical stack of ANTIC mode instructions. Different modes occupy different numbers of scan lines and use different amounts of RAM. Designing a display requires counting the scan lines of each Mode instruction and tracking the memory for each Mode line to prevent overrunning ANTIC or video standard limitations. (See the Limitations section).

Mixing multiple graphics modes in one display is done simply by providing different character or map mode instructions for the desired position on screen. For example, the Atari Operating System graphics modes 1 through 8 offer full screen display, or an option for a four-line text window at the bottom of the screen. This split screen feature is accomplished using the inherent capabilities of ANTIC and its Display List without any CPU interrupts or custom manipulation of the video hardware.

ANTIC has four types of instructions:
*Blank line - 8 instructions to display from 1 through 8 horizontal blank lines
*Jump instructions - 2 kinds of Jump instructions which reload ANTIC&#x27;s program counter (3-byte instructions)
*Character mode - 6 instructions to display character data
*Map mode - 8 instructions to display colored pixels

Map and Character mode instructions have additional modifiers that can be enabled with the instruction:
*Horizontal scrolling - Enables horizontal fine scrolling
*Vertical scrolling - Enables vertical fine scrolling
*Load Memory Scan (LMS) - Sets the starting address of graphics/character data (3-byte instruction)
*DLI - Display List Interrupt (called &quot;raster interrupt&quot; or &quot;Horizontal Blank Interrupt&quot; on other systems)

=== Instruction Execution ===
ANTIC begins executing the Display List pointed to by the 16-bit address in registers DLISTL/DLISTH ($D402-$D403hex/54274-54275dec). The address registers are incremented by ANTIC automatically as each instruction is executed. ANTIC can only update the lowest 10 bits of the address during the automatic increment limiting the display list to begin and end within a 1K address range.

The registers are also updated during Display List execution by ANTIC&#x27;s JMP (Jump) and JVB (Jump and wait for Vertical Blank). These instructions load the full 16-bits of address, so can be used to circumvent the 1K Display List limitation.

The address is also updated by the Operating System&#x27;s Vertical Blank Interrupt (VBI) routine using the values from Operation System shadow registers SDLSTL/SDLSTH ($0230-$0231hex/560-561dec). When the OS VBI routine is enabled direct updates to the ANTIC DLIST registers by the CPU or the ANTIC Jump instructions will be overwritten by the OS during the next Vertical Blank. Since VBI processing is the usual state of the system, most programs rely on this and only update the OS shadow registers (SDLSTL/SDLSTH $0230-$0231hex/560-561dec) to set the Display List.

=== Instruction Bytes ===

This legend applies to the instruction bit diagrams below:

Instruction Bits:

Bits 7:4 are modifiers for Playfield Mode instructions in bits 3:0. Bit value 1 Enables the modifier, and 0 disables the modifier.

* Bit 3:Bit 0 - Playfield Mode Instruction. 
**Values , and are special instructions. 
** Mode values through specify Playfield Character and Map modes.
* Bit 4 - - Horizontal Scroll.
* Bit 5 - - Vertical Scroll.
* Bit 6 - - Load Memory Scan.
* Bit 7 - - Display List Interrupt.

==== Mode 0 Instruction - Blank Lines ====
When Mode bits are all zero ANTIC performs no playfield DMA and displays one or more blank scan line(s) of the background color. For normal color interpretation modes the &quot;background&quot; is color register COLBK (D01Ahex/53274dec) OS Shadow COLOR4 (02C8hex/712dec), though this differs for the GTIA color interpretation modes. See discussion of COLBK on the GTIA page for more information.

The number of blank scan lines are specified by the value of Bits 4 through Bits 6 allowing a range from 0 through 7. ANTIC adds one to this value and displays the resulting number of scan lines. Instruction Values:

Blank lines are useful for delaying the start of the screen display until the electron beam has left the vertical overscan area at the top of the display. The Atari Operating System creates all its graphics modes beginning with three 70hex/112dec instructions (or 24 blank scan lines) for this purpose. Blank lines are also useful for partitioning parts of a custom display with different purposes (i.e. a border between a status display and the main graphics.)

Blank Mode lines cannot be contained within a scrolling region, because Blank Mode line instructions inherently do not have Fine Scrolling Modifier bits. However, a Blank Mode instruction can be used to end a vertical scrolling region and is still subject to the expected scan line height changes per the vertical scroll value.

The DLI modifier bit is available for blank line instructions. When the DLI bit is enabled a Display List Interrupt will be triggered during the last blank scan line of the instruction. Since playfield DMA does not occur during blank lines (only Display list DMA and Player/Missile DMA (if enabled) occurs) the blank lines can be used where Playfield graphics will not be needed giving more time for Display List Interrupt routines changing color registers or Player/Missile positions.

==== Mode 1 Instruction - Jump ====
When Mode value is 1 ANTIC executes a Jump in its program (the Display List). The next two bytes in the Display List are loaded into ANTIC registers DLISTL/DLISTH ($D402-$D403hex/54274-54275dec) changing the execution point of the next instruction.

There are two kinds of Jumps:

* 01hex/1dec JMP - Jump to address. This is used to load a new execution address in the middle of Display List execution, typically when the Display List must cross over a 1K boundary.
* 41hex/65dec JVB - Jump to address and wait for Vertical Blank. (JMP + LMS bit set) This is used to end the Display List. The address used should be the starting address of the Display List.

The DLIST registers are also updated by the Operating System&#x27;s Vertical Blank Interrupt (VBI) routine using the values in shadow registers SDLSTL/SDLSTH (0230-0231hex/560-561dec). When the OS VBI routine is enabled direct updates to the ANTIC DLIST registers by the CPU or the ANTIC Jump instructions will be overwritten by the OS during the next Vertical Blank. This implies that an ANTIC JVB (Jump and wait for Vertical Blank) instruction that specifies an invalid address (or a valid address that differs from the shadow SDLST value) has no real effect on the display.

The JVB&#x27;s argument usually points to the beginning of the same Display List, but it can also point to another Display List, so that a chain of Display Lists is executed after consecutive vertical blanks. Of course, to give ANTIC control over the start of the next Display List the OS Vertical Blank interrupt must be disabled to prevent it overwriting ANTIC hardware registers with the shadow register values.

==== Modes 2 to F Instructions - Playfield Character and Map Modes ====
The following is the list of ANTIC graphics mode instructions. For more detailed descriptions of each Mode see the Playfield Graphics Modes section.

The memory requirement for a Mode Line is determined by two factors:
* The width bits set in the DMACTL hardware register. 
* The presence of the Horizontal Fine Scroll Display List Instruction Modifier.

The Horizontal Fine Scroll Modifier will change the memory requirement for the current Mode Line from the DMACTL-specified width to the next largest value.

=== Instruction Modifiers ===
Bits 7:4 are modifiers for Playfield Mode instructions in bits 3:0. Playfield Mode Instruction values range from $02 to $0F. Modifier bit value 1 Enables the modifier, and 0 disables the modifier.

* Bit 4 - $10hex/16dec Horizontal Scroll.
* Bit 5 - $20hex/32dec Vertical Scroll.
* Bit 6 - $40hex/64dec Load Memory Scan.
* Bit 7 - $80hex/128dec Display List Interrupt.

==== HS Modifer - Horizontal Fine Scroll ====
Bit4: position value $10, controls horizontal scrolling of the playfield mode.

When horizontal scrolling is enabled ANTIC retrieves more screen memory bytes than displayed in order to show partially scrolled display bytes at the beginning and end of the line. If the display is in Narrow mode ANTIC retrieves the number of screen bytes necessary for Normal mode. If the display is in Normal mode ANTIC retrieves the number of bytes needed for Wide screen mode. In Wide screen mode ANTIC does not retrieve any additional screen bytes. Scrolling in Wide screen will cause blank data to be shifted into the scrolled area. This is not a problem, because it occurs in the overscan area which is not visible on a normal NTSC/PAL display.

==== VS Modifer - Vertical Fine Scroll ====
Bit5: position value $20, controls vertical scrolling of the Playfield mode.

The Vertical scrolling region in a display is defined by setting the VS bit ($20) on a sequential series of ANTIC Mode Lines in the Display List. The first Mode line without the VS bit set becomes the end of the scrolling region and is used as a buffer line to supply the new information to scroll up into the bottom of the scrolling region.

==== LMS Modifer - Load Memory Scan ====
Bit6: position value $40, loads a new address for the start of screen memory for the current Playfield mode line.

The LMS option loads ANTIC&#x27;s screen memory scan address with the 16-bit value in the two bytes following the instruction. The Character or Map mode specified will begin displaying bytes from that address. The LMS option must appear in the first Playfield Mode Instruction line (not Blank Line) in the Display List to initialize ANTIC to begin reading at the start of screen memory. Most of the Operating System-generated full screen modes will have only that one occurrence of the LMS modifier present in the Display List. ANTIC will automatically increment its LMS address at the end of each mode line in preparation for the next line. As long as screen memory does not cross over a 4K boundary the LMS modifier is not needed on subsequent Playfield Mode Instructions.

Full screen displays using Playfield Map Modes E or F will have a second occurrence of the LMS modifier on a Map Instruction near the middle of the screen, since the full display requires more than 4K of screen memory. (Mode F displays include high res 320 pixel lines, and the GTIA display modes.)

Combining the Map and Character Mode instructions with the LMS bit makes it possible to set the screen memory address freely within the 64K address space &quot;independently for each display line&quot;. In other words, the screen memory does not have to be completely contiguous memory scanned sequentially towards higher addresses - only that a single Mode line must be provided with adequate sequential bytes of memory to meet the requirements of that Mode, width of the display, and Scrolling feature.

==== DLI Modifer - Display List Interrupt ====
Bit7: position value , directs ANTIC to invoke a CPU-serviced interrupt on the last scan line of the Playfield Mode.

If ANTIC register NMIEN (hex/54286dec) has Bit7 () set then on the last scanline of the Mode line an interrupt routine will be triggered which is vectored through address VDSLST (200hex/512dec).

The 6502 Accumulator, X and Y register contents are not preserved before entry to the DLI routine. It is the responsibility of the DLI routine to save the state of the registers used during the DLI, and then restore the original values of the registers before exiting with an RTI instruction. Routines typically push the register values to the 6502 stack.

DLI routines are ordinarily short and quick, changing the color registers or Player-Missile positions before exiting. However, brevity is not required. As long as the DLI routine exits before the start of the next DLI routine the DLI routine can continue updating values across multiple scanlines.

== Playfield graphics modes ==
The ANTIC chip allows a variety of different Playfield modes and widths. However, the original Atari Operating System included with the Atari 800/400 computers provides easy access to a limited subset of these graphics modes. ANTIC Playfield modes are exposed to users through Atari BASIC via the &quot;GRAPHICS&quot; command, and to some other languages, via similar system calls. Oddly, the modes not directly supported by the original OS and BASIC are modes most useful for games. The later version of the OS used in the Atari 8-bit XL/XE computers added support for most of these &quot;missing&quot; graphics modes.

The ANTIC chip uses a Display List and other settings to create these modes. Any graphics mode in the default GTIA color interpretation can be freely mixed without CPU intervention by changing instructions in the Display List.

The ANTIC screen geometry is not fixed. A hardware register can direct ANTIC to display narrow playfield (128 color clocks/256 hi-res pixels wide), normal width playfield (160 color clocks/320 hi-res pixels wide), and wide, overscan playfield (192 color clocks/384 hi-res pixels wide). While the Operating System&#x27;s default height for graphics modes is 192 scan lines Antic can display vertical overscan up to 240 TV scan lines tall by creating a custom Display List.

Mode F produces colors through NTSC artifacting and works in a similar manner to the Apple II&#x27;s graphics modes. The pixel resolution is 320 across but the color resolution half that, thus each group of two pixels will &quot;blend&quot; together to form a single color and four artifact colors may be generated this way. They will be tinted if the foreground and background color are set to something other than black/white/gray. The exact colors produced this way vary with different Atari 8-bit models and also between the CTIA and GTIA chips, thus undesirable artifact colors may result from running software that uses Mode F on a machine other than the one it was developed for. It was not possible to obtain artifact coloring on PAL machines and Mode F will be monochrome on them.

Mode F was not widely used by software due to its high memory requirements (8k) and inconsistent artifact colors that did not appear the same on every model of Atari 8-bit computer. Games that utilize it include Sierra graphical adventures such as &quot;Troll&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;Wizard and the Princess&quot;, &quot;Lode Runner&quot;, and the &quot;Ultima&quot; series.

The video display system was designed with careful consideration of NTSC display methods and limitations. The system CPU clock and video hardware are synchronized to one-half the NTSC clock frequency. Consequently, the pixel output of all display modes is based on the size of the NTSC color clock which is the minimum time needed to guarantee correct and consistent color regardless of the pixel&#x27;s horizontal location on the screen. The result is accurate pixel size and coloring that does not display color &quot;strobing&quot; defects when horizontally scrolled. (Color strobing is unsightly hue changes in pixels based on horizontal position which is caused when signal changes do not align with the color clock and so do not provide the TV/monitor hardware adequate time to reach the correct color.)

=== Character Modes ===
==== Glyph Rendering ====
All character sets use 8 sequential bytes to represent the character. Four types of character/glyph rendering of those bytes are available. Each Character Mode is associated to a specific rendering method:

* Standard: ANTIC Mode 2. Based on the high resolution graphics modes each bit in the character glyph represents one pixel on screen that is 1/2 color clock wide. The background color is rather than COLBK used in other Character and Map modes. COLBK appears as a border around all four sides of the Playfield. 0 value bits in the character glyph show the background color. 1 value bits show the luminance value from based on the background (COLPF2) color. The character set uses 128 characters and requires 1024 bytes of RAM.
* Descenders: ANTIC Mode 3. A modification of the Standard method. The method of pixel color display is the same. Each mode line is 10 scanlines tall, though the character glyph is still 8 bytes. Characters hex/0dec to hex/95dec display in the top 8 scan lines with two blank scan lines added at the bottom. Characters hex/96dec to hex/127dec begin with two blank scan lines at the top, and then display the glyph bytes in the bottom 8 scan lines. The first two bytes in the glyph are moved to the bottom two scan lines. This allows a properly designed character set to display true descenders. The character set uses 128 characters and requires 1024 bytes of RAM.
* Single Color: ANTIC Modes 6 and 7. In these modes each bit in the character glyph represents one pixel that is one color clock wide. The background color is COLBK. Characters may be displayed in a choice of one of four colors. The six low bits of the character value identifies the glyph and the two high bits identify a color. Since the character value is reduced to six bits the character set uses 64 characters and requires 512 bytes of RAM. 0 value bits in the character glyph show the background color. 1 value bits in the glyph data shows one of four possible color choices based on the two high bits of the character value. Character value bits 7 and 6:

* Multi-Color: ANTIC Modes 4 and 5. In these character modes each pair of bits in the character glyph represents a pixel one color clock wide, thus a single byte of glyph information represents 4 pixels rather than the 8 pixels of other modes. The character set uses 128 characters and requires 1024 bytes of RAM. The background color is . This mode allows up to four colors (including the background) to be displayed in one character matrix. If the high bit of the character value is set (i.e. inverse video) then a fifth color, , is displayed in place of the pixel bit pattern &quot;11&quot; that ordinarily shows . The color choices based on the bit pairs of the character glyph:
=== Map Modes ===
=== GTIA Modes ===
GTIA modes are Antic Mode F displays with an alternate color interpretation option enabled via GTIA register PRIOR ($D01Bhex/53275dec) shadowed by GPRIOR ($026Fhex/623dec). The full color expression of these GTIA modes can also be engaged in Antic text modes 2 and 3, though these will also require a custom character set to achieve practical use of the colors. See GTIA for more information.

== Scrolling ==

Before video displays became a common part of the user interface many computers used a teletype—a printer usually with continuously-fed paper. User input and the computer generated output were printed on the paper fed through the printer. This widely understood interface for user input and computer output continued with the introduction of video displays as computers presented a metaphor of the screen as a view port over an imagined, infinite roll of paper. Information is displayed on screen beginning at the top until it reaches the bottom of the screen and when the computer needs to introduce new information it shifts all the screen information up providing an empty space at the bottom for the new information and consequently erasing the topmost information.

This kind of scrolling is called, &quot;coarse scrolling&quot;. It is achieved by moving bytes of memory through a designated screen display area. Moving a kilobyte (or more) of memory is CPU intensive and slower computers may not be able to accomplish anything else while updating screen data. As a means of animating a display the results can be jerky when the CPU cannot update the screen memory faster than the display hardware reads the memory to generate the video output. Motion fluidity is impaired, since the minimum amount of shifting the display is the size of an entire character. Most computers including the Atari 8-bits accomplish coarse scrolling as described above — common examples are viewing a long BASIC program listing or directory of files.

Coarse scrolling implemented by bulk movement of data is often the only method of scrolling possible on most computers. However, ANTIC provides direct hardware support for vertical and horizontal, coarse and fine scrolling taking the concept of a &quot;view port moving over data&quot; from a metaphorical illusion to literal implementation. These ANTIC features deliver rapid, smooth, full screen movement requiring negligible CPU time and so free the CPU for other work.

All ANTIC display modes, Text and Map modes, can exercise the hardware scrolling features.

=== Vertical Coarse Scrolling ===

Vertical coarse scrolling is the easiest feature to exercise. The first Text or Map Mode instruction in every Display List always includes the LMS instruction modifier specifying the start of screen memory. As it generates the display, ANTIC automatically increments its memory scan pointer from Mode line to Mode line to display memory contiguously. Therefore, a display can be &quot;moved&quot; by merely updating the initial LMS modifier&#x27;s address; adding the number of bytes used for a line in the current Text or Map Mode shifts the screen contents up one line while subtracting the same amount moves the screen down. So, the display is actually a view port that is moved to look at a different areas of memory rather than moving the memory into a fixed screen map.

Since ANTIC&#x27;s memory scan counter cannot automatically increment over a 4K boundary the limit of vertical scrolling in this simple manner is up to 4K of movement. A full screen of Mode 2 text using approximately 1K can continuously scroll the height of four screens until reaching the 4K boundary. Likewise, a Mode 7 text display can scroll the height of 16 entire screens.

Naturally, that trivial example is of limited usefulness. Many scrolling implementations scroll only part of the screen while other sections remain fixed. This problem is solved by the inherent capabilities of the ANTIC Display List. In this situation the Display List would add Mode instructions using LMS modifiers on the first mode line of the screen sections that should not move which effectively locks these parts of the display while the LMS modifier address for the scrolling section is updated.

Further enhancement of this concept uses the LMS modifier option on every line that does scroll. Vertical scrolling on this display requires updating one LMS modifier address for each Mode line in the scrolling region. When the display is managed at this level of detail ANTIC&#x27;s 4K screen RAM boundary can be easily circumvented. Even in this worst case example the CPU effort expended is a tiny fraction of the processing needed to bulk move screen data.

One other limit to be aware of is that the two byte LMS modifier address must not be updated when ANTIC is processing the LMS. If ANTIC reads the LMS address while it is partially updated ANTIC will display the incorrect section of memory for that Mode line. When the scrolling region of a display requires multiple LMS address updates the possibility of a partial update increases, and the possibility of having two subsequent lines display the same data also increases. Programs solve this in a number of ways—performing updates during the Vertical blank, monitoring the VCOUNT before updates, or doing the updates in Display List Interrupts executed during sections of the display away from the scrolling region.

=== Vertical Fine Scrolling ===

Vertical Fine Scrolling allows single scan line movement of the scrolling region for Text and Map modes which are greater than one scan line tall. Vertical Fine Scrolling for Map modes only one scan line tall is logically not practical. The effect of vertical &quot;fine&quot; scrolling for single scan line Map modes can be performed using the easier coarse scrolling method.

Fine scrolling requires setup to define the scrolling region. This is done by setting the Vertical Scroll (VS) modifier bit in sequential Display List instructions. The first Mode line instruction without the VS bit set becomes the end of the scrolling region and is used as a buffer line to supply the new scan lines to scroll up into the bottom of the scrolling region.

ANTIC&#x27;s process of vertical fine scrolling works by simply directing ANTIC to skip a number of scan lines for the first mode line of the scrolling region. Subsequent Mode lines in the scrolling region are not affected. The last line of the region supplies the bottom border of the scrolling region displaying the number of scan lines that were removed from the first line. This number of scan lines is controlled with the VSCROL register. The value ranges from 0 to the ANTIC Mode line&#x27;s scan line height - 1. The maximum value range covers fine scrolling 16 scan lines from 0 to 15.

When the fine scrolling limit is reached, scrolling continues by resetting the VSCROL value and performing a coarse vertical scroll of the scrolling region.

=== Horizontal Coarse Scrolling ===

Horizontal coarse scrolling requires a little more effort than vertical scrolling. While horizontal scrolling is expected to present the illusion of a view port moving left and right across a wide panoramic scene made of screen memory, ANTIC&#x27;s automatic memory scan increment conflicts with this idea that the rows of screen data is wider than the display. Presenting screen memory as long horizontal lines requires an LMS modifier for every Display List Text or Map Mode instruction in the scrolling region. A horizontal step is accomplished by incrementing or decrementing all the LMS addresses of the scrolling region.

Horizontal scrolling requires the same Display List implementation as the worst case example described for Vertical Coarse Scrolling. So, where Horizontal scrolling is implemented, vertical scrolling is also supported just by changing the value incrementing or decrementing the LMS addresses. The other benefit of this arrangement is that it is easy to manage screen memory around ANTIC&#x27;s 4K screen memory boundary limit.

See the Vertical Coarse Scrolling section for further discussion and time constraints when updating LMS modifier addresses.

=== Horizontal Fine Scrolling ===

Horizontal Fine Scrolling allows single color clock movement of the scrolling region for Text and Map modes. For all normal color interpretations this is by color clock, not pixel even when pixels are larger (or smaller) than the color clocks. ANTIC Modes using the alternate GTIA color interpretations must be scrolled by an entire GTIA pixel (two color clocks). Only even values should be used to ensure correct GTIA pixel scrolling. Odd values of HSCROL will shift the GTIA pixel stream into a different state that will be interpreted as different colors.

Fine scrolling requires setup to define the horizontal scrolling region. The first step is to start with a Display List using the LMS instruction modifier to specify starting address of each Mode line. This is done to organize screen memory as long rows of data for the display. The next step is setting the Horizontal Scroll (HS) modifier bit in all Display List Mode line instructions for the scrolling region.

This number of color clocks to shift is controlled with the HSCROL register. The maximum HSCROL value range covers fine scrolling 16 color clocks from 0 to 15. The color clock information used is buffered from the beginning of the mode line (ANTIC&#x27;s current memory scan pointer) using enough screen memory bytes to satisfy the 16 color clocks. Horizontal scrolling simply directs ANTIC how many color clocks it can output from the buffered 16 color clocks starting at the last (right most) color clock of the buffered memory. Zero (0) is no color clocks output from the buffer. 1 is the last (right most) color clock of the buffer. The color clocks are inserted at the left edge of the screen, causing the scrolling area of the screen to shift to the right.

When the fine scrolling limit is reached, continue scrolling by resetting the HSCROL value and performing a coarse horizontal scroll of the scrolling region. ANTIC&#x27;s 16 color clock range permits fine scrolling multiple Text Mode characters or more than one byte worth of Map mode pixels. Therefore, the update to the LMS addresses may add or subtract multiple bytes.

=== Alternate Scrolling Methods ===

An interesting use of ANTIC&#x27;s DMA memory scan behavior permits a strategy for apparently long horizontal scrolling distances, but uses a fraction of the real memory required. As discussed in Horizontal Coarse Scrolling ANTIC&#x27;s automatic memory scan increment from Mode line to Mode line conflicts with the idea that the rows of screen data are wider than the display. Using memory actually organized as a long, horizontal, contiguous series of bytes requires an LMS modifier for every Display List Text or Map Mode instruction in the scrolling region.

Instead of using an LMS modifier for every line this method uses a more &quot;normal&quot; display list that only requires one LMS modifier at the start of the scrolling region. An increment (+1) to the LMS modifier address makes the scrolling region appear to move toward the left. However, the &quot;new&quot; information that has moved into the right side of the scrolling region was previously the first byte on the following line (except for the last byte of the last line — that information had been completely off screen).

The second half of this strategy requires the last byte/character of every line in the scrolling region to be updated to show the desired, new information. For a typical scrolling display this would mean updating the last byte of one or two dozen lines which takes a trivial amount of time in assembly. So, if this scrolling process involves a full screen Mode 2 or Mode 4 text display (rather worst case) and uses the entire 4K capability of ANTIC&#x27;s automatic screen memory addressing, then the horizontal scrolling can continue in this manner for about 3,000 steps; equivalent to 75 full screens.

However, even the 4K memory use is not required. After all the data from the first full screen has been shifted off the display the scrolling application can rebuild the first screen to contain a known transition point so that the scrolling action can jump back to the first address in the block with no apparent stutter or obvious interruption in the scrolling.

Fine scrolling this arrangement requires a little more planning. When fine scrolling is enabled in the Display List ANTIC retrieves more information than the Mode line requires for display. As each mode line now uses more memory, the new information scrolled into the side of the display is not the byte/character that was displayed at the start of the next line. However, this does not impair the scrolling process and merely changes the value of addition and subtraction used to locate the start and end of each display line.

== Display List Interrupts (DLI) ==

ANTIC includes a feature to trigger a CPU-serviced interrupt at specific vertical positions on the screen. This is built into the ANTIC Display List which directs ANTIC to launch the interrupt during the last scan line of the current Mode instruction, and so is called &quot;Display List Interrupt&quot;. Other platforms call this activity, &quot;Raster interrupts&quot;, or &quot;Horizontal blank interrupts&quot;. The usual purpose is to change display-related values at a known location so transitions are visually precise or occur where they will not conflict with display activity. Possibilities include, but are not limited to changing color register values, Player/Missile horizontal positions, and fine scrolling values. Since the DLI is 6502 machine code executed by the CPU, any kind of processing work is possible provided it is short enough to not conflict with other activity and does not overrun a subsequent Display List Interrupt. A good example is mouse controller polling which must be done more frequently than 1/60th of a second.

=== Overview ===
Properly launching the interrupt requires the following conditions:

* A Display List with a Mode instruction that includes the Display List Interrupt (DLI) modifier bit set. (Bit 7 - $80hex/128dec)
* ANTIC&#x27;s NMIEN register has the DLI bit set. (Bit 7 - $80hex/128dec)
* The Operating System vector for the Display List Interrupt (VDSLST, $0200hex/512dec) points to the starting address of the interrupt routine.

=== Proper Setup ===
When updating display control values care must be taken to ensure ANTIC is not currently using them. If ANTIC is processing the Display List containing an Instruction with the DLI modifier, then an interrupt could be dispatched while changing the VDSLST address, potentially crashing the system. If a Display List uses multiple interrupts, and interrupts are enabled in NMIEN after ANTIC has already passed Mode Instructions with DLI modifiers, then the Display List Interrupts will be started out of order, causing unexpected results.

A &quot;reasonable&quot; sequence of events to install a Display List using Display List Interrupts:

* Turn off ANTIC Display List Interrupts by clearing bit 7 () of NMIEN by setting the register to value which allows the Vertical Blank Interrupt to continue running.
* Turn off ANTIC Display List DMA. Turn off the DMA in the Shadow register first (SDMCTL), and then if desired the same can be done to the hardware register (DMACTL). Bit 5 (value ) must be cleared, but most implementations would choose to zero all bits and then when the time comes to restart the screen restore the correct value of all bits.
* Set the Display List pointer Shadow address DLISTL/DLISTH to the starting address of the new Display List.
* Set the Display List Interrupt address VDSLST (hex/512dec) to the starting address of the interrupt routine.
* Wait for the next Vertical Blank Interrupt (VBI) to apply the Shadow register changes. Possible methods:
** Monitor RTCLOCK (//hex/18/19/20dec) for an increment indicating the VBI occurred.
** Monitor ANTIC&#x27;s VCOUNT for changes indicating the next frame has started.
* Turn on ANTIC Display List Interrupts by setting bit 7 () of NMIEN. The usual value for NMIEN is which enables DLI and VBI.
* Turn on ANTIC Display List DMA by updating the Shadow register (SDMCTL). Bit 5 (value ) must be set, as should the bits for Playfield width, and if needed, the bits related to Player/Missile graphics.

A program tightly integrated with the display cycle and aware of the electron beam position relative to the current display can bypass turning off Display List DMA. Likewise, turning off the display is not needed if the setup occurs during the vertical blank.

=== Code Considerations ===
The 6502 Accumulator, X and Y register contents are not preserved before entry to the DLI routine. It is the responsibility of the DLI routine to save the state of the registers that will be used during the DLI routine, and then the last action is to restore the original values of the registers before exiting with an RTI instruction. Routines typically push the register values to the 6502 stack.

If multiple DLIs are used the first interrupt updates VDSLST to point to the address of the next interrupt, and so on for subsequent interrupts. The last Display List Interrupt routine on the screen points VDSLST back to the address of the first Display List Interrupt.

If a value changed by a DLI has an Operating System Shadow register and the Vertical Blank Interrupts are enabled, then the value in effect before (above) the screen position of the Display List Interrupt is the value of the Shadow, and the value after (below) the screen position is the value from the DLI (and any other DLI that later changes it.) If the value does not have an Operating System Shadow then there should be an initial DLI (or VBI) routine which sets a starting value.

If a graphics object is being displayed while the DLI changes its value the results may be inconsistent. The most common example is changing the background color. Since the DLI begins executing while the electron beam is in a visible portion of the screen, the transition from the previous background color to the new color written by the DLI will be visible somewhere on the current scan line. (The exact location varies based on DMA requirements for the display mode and Player/Missile graphics.) To produce a clean transition from scan line to scan line the code should first write to WSYNC which halts the DLI execution until the end of the scan line, and then write to the desired registers.

While the usual operation of the DLI is to change a few display-oriented values, and then return to the main code, this is not a requirement. It is safe for a DLI to run for several, or many scan lines as long as it exits before the next DLI or the Vertical Blank Interrupt.

=== Examples ===
A trivial example of a Display List Interrupt that changes the background color:
 DLI
 PHA ; Save Accumulator on stack
 LDA #$9C ; Load light blue (color $9, luminance $C)
 STA WSYNC ; Wait to sync to the end of the scanline 
 STA COLBK ; Set the background 
 PLA ; Restore Accumulator from stack
 RTI ; The end. 
== Player/Missile Graphics ==

Most Player/Missile graphics functionality is in the domain of the CTIA/GTIA chip. CTIA/GTIA controls position, size, color, priority, and collision detection for Player/Missile graphics objects, but its actual shape rendering implementation goes no farther than a single byte pattern per object presented uniformly on all scan lines. (The patterns are set in CTIA/GTIA&#x27;s GRAF* graphics pattern registers.) In the end, by itself CTIA/GTIA generates Player/Missile objects as only vertical stripe patterns on the screen.

ANTIC&#x27;s design includes DMA capability so that it may read its Display List and Playfield graphics data. This direct memory access capability is leveraged to read data on behalf of CTIA/GTIA and update the GRAF* graphics pattern registers as each display scan line is generated. In this way ANTIC provides Player/Missile objects with patterns that vary over the height of the screen and so appear as traditional &quot;sprite&quot; graphics.

Bits 2 and 3 of ANTIC&#x27;s DMACTL register (shadowed by SDMCTL) control ANTIC&#x27;s retrieval of Player/Missile data to update CTIA/GTIA graphics pattern registers.

DMACTL Player/Missile DMA control bits values (bits [3:2]):

* - Disable Player and Missile DMA
* - Enable Missile DMA
* - Enable Player DMA
* - Enable Player and Missile DMA

Missile DMA can be enabled without player DMA. However, when Player DMA is enabled, Missile DMA automatically occurs to keep the DMA timing consistent, but the data is not delivered to the Missile&#x27;s GRAFM register.

Bit 4 (value hex/16dec) of the DMACTL register controls the frequency of new data retrieval. ANTIC retrieves data and updates CTIA/GTIA every scan line. The DMACTL resolution settings affect how often ANTIC increments its internal DMA pointer for fetching new data. Single Line resolution Player/Missile graphics increments the DMA address every scan line, and Double Line resolution increments the DMA address with every even scan line. The DMACTL bit values for Player/Missile resolution:

* - Double line resolution. New data is fetched by DMA on even scan lines, but an update to CTIA/GTIA Player/Missile Graphics pattern registers still occurs on every scan line. Consequently, each Player/Missile byte pattern is two scan lines tall. When Double line resolution is enabled CTIA/GTIA register VDELAY (D01Chex/53276dec) can be used to mask ANTIC&#x27;s updates on even scan lines shifting the bit pattern of individual Players and Missiles down one scan line.
* - Single line resolution. A new DMA fetch and Player/Missile register update occurs on every scan line. CTIA/GTIA register VDELAY (D01Chex/53276dec) masking the updates on even scan lines reduces Single line Player/Missile resolution to appear to be Double line resolution, though the data is shifted one scan line lower.

CTIA/GTIA must also be specifically enabled to receive the Player/Missile graphics data via DMA to correctly present the objects on screen. See CTIA/GTIA&#x27;s GRACTL register for more information.

The location of memory read by ANTIC for Player/Missile graphics is controlled by register PMBASE. This value of PMBASE provides the starting page of the base address for Player/Missile graphics. When double line resolution P/M graphics are operating the PMBASE value must begin on a 1K boundary. When single line resolution P/M graphics are operating the PMBASE value must begin on a 2K boundary. The memory maps for the Player/Missile graphics modes:

Double line resolution (1 byte per 2 scanlines, 128 bytes each object) relative to PMBASE x hex/256dec:
Single line resolution (1 byte per scanline, 256 bytes each object) relative to PMBASE x hex/256dec:
Missiles share the same bytes of the memory maps above, two bits per Missile:
ANTIC does not use the first and last 8 scan lines worth of data of Player/Missile memory in the memory map. In double line resolution the first and last four bytes are ignored, in single line resolution the first and last eight bytes.

Since the Player/Missiles are an overlay independent from Playfield graphics and are rendered in the overscan area the vertical coordinates for Player/Missile data must be offset to align objects with the Playfield. In the Operating System&#x27;s 192-scan line default graphics modes the Player/Missile vertical data coordinates are offset from the Player/Missile&#x27;s start in memory as shown below. Overscan entries show the first and last used offsets of Player/Missile data:

== Limitations ==
The vertical extent of the entire Playfield display varies between 0 and 240 scanlines - this depends on the number of lines ANTIC is programmed to display according to the Display List. ANTIC begins generating scan lines at TV scan line 8 continuing to line 247 for a total of 240 scan lines.

The horizontal width of the Playfield display may be set to 256, 320 or 384 pixels wide corresponding to 128, 160, or 192 color clocks. In the widest mode, only 352 pixels (176 color clocks) are actually visible. See DMACTL.

Horizontal fine scrolling moves the scrolling region up to 16 color clocks. See HSCROL.

The GTIA Map modes must be horizontally scrolled in steps the size of an entire pixel (2 color clocks), instead of one color clock. See HSCROL and the discussion, Horizontal Fine Scrolling

Vertical fine scrolling moves the scrolling region the number of scan lines in a single Mode line of the scrolling region, up to a maximum of 16 scan lines. See VSCROL.

Although ANTIC&#x27;s Display List program counter is 16-bit, only the lower 10 bits change during normal (i.e. sequential) execution of the Display List. This means the Display List requires a JMP (Jump) instruction to cross a 1K boundary. This is not a serious limitation, because the size of a single Display List usually varies from 32 to 202 bytes, and virtually never exceeds 720 bytes. Since it can be located anywhere in the memory, there is little difficulty finding a sufficiently sized place in memory that does not cross a 1K boundary.

The Memory Scan Register, a register addressing the data stored in the screen memory, is 16-bit, but only the lower 12 bits change when ANTIC is sequentially scanning the video memory. This means the Display List requires a Mode line instruction including the LMS (Load Memory Scan) option where screen memory crosses a 4K boundary. ANTIC&#x27;s graphic modes E and F require more than 7.5K of screen memory for a full screen display. The Display Lists for these displays require the LMS option added to a Mode instruction near the middle of the display where screen memory crosses the 4K boundary. The 4K boundary cannot be crossed within the middle of a Graphics Mode line, but only between the end of one Mode line and the beginning of the next line. In other words, the memory for the previous Mode line ends at the exact last byte of the 4K block and the next Mode line begins at the exact first byte of the next 4K block.

The character set can be located anywhere in the memory (see CHBASE), but, depending on the ANTIC Text Mode, the starting address must align to a 512-byte or a 1K boundary.

The Player/Missile memory map may occur anywhere in memory (see PMBASE), but, depending on the resolution, the starting address must align to a 1K or 2K boundary (also see DMACTL).

== Bugs and Border Conditions ==
Certain combinations of values in the Display List can produce unexpected results. Also, some of ANTIC&#x27;s activities have critical timing. Changes to registers outside of proper time windows may result in delayed effect or unexpected results. Some of these situations are exploitable for interesting effects and others produce display corruptions.

=== Exploitable Behaviors ===

==== Graphics 9++ ====
One method of using the enhanced GTIA color modes without the large memory requirements of ANTIC mode F is to direct ANTIC to repeat each line of data one or more times by using Mode line instructions with the LMS modifier to redisplay the same screen data on multiple scan lines. This produces a lower vertical resolution where each pixel is 2 or more scan lines tall, but has higher DMA overhead due to ANTIC needing to re-read the same bytes from screen memory. Rather than using repeated LMS modifiers, a quirk of vertical scrolling can be exploited to create a four scan-line mode that displays pixels using the hi-res or GTIA color interpretation modes.

Vertical Scrolling would ordinarily not be considered useful for ANTIC Mode F which is one scan line tall. However, if Vertical Scrolling is enabled for the Mode F Display List instruction, and the VSCROL register is set to 13, then ANTIC&#x27;s line counter will count from 13 to 0 (four scan lines—13, 14, 15, 0). In doing so ANTIC outputs the same line of graphics for each scan line from its internal buffer without re-reading the same screen memory again. The end of the vertical scrolling region needs to have VSCROL reset to 3 allowing ANTIC to count from 0 to 3 (four scan lines). The end result is a Mode F display where the lines are four scan lines tall rather than one, but with the DMA overhead of only one screen memory data read occurring on the first scan line.

=== Unexploitable Behaviors ===

==== Mode 8/Mode 9 Horizontal Scroll Corruption ====
ANTIC Map Modes 8 and 9 will be corrupted when immediately following a horizontally scrolled line of a different mode using normal or wide playfield width. This occurs if the Mode 8 or 9 line is horizontally scrolled or not, but the corruption results are different in each case. The problem appears for certain HSCROL values causing ANTIC to output pixels incorrectly and misalign the Mode 8-9 line.

The bug is absent when narrow width playfield is used.

*If Mode 8 or 9 is NOT using Horizontal scrolling and follows:
**Mode 2, 3, 4, 5, D, E, or F and HSCROL is , or : then corruption continues through the mode line.
**Mode 2, 3, 4, 5, D, E, or F and HSCROL is or : then corruption resolves itself within two scan lines.
**Mode 6, 7, A, B, or C and HSCROL is or : then corruption continues through the mode line.
*If Mode 8 or 9 is using Horizontal scrolling and follows:
**Mode 2, 3, 4, 5, D, E, or F: then corruption resolves itself within three scan lines.
**Mode 6, 7, A, B, or C: then corruption resolves itself within two scan lines.

Since the HSCROL values causing the problem are greater than 7, the problem can be averted when Mode 8 or 9 is NOT using Horizontal scrolling by limiting HSCROL shifts to 0 through 7 color clocks and updating the Display List LMS address to horizontally coarse scroll in smaller increments. This strategy resolves all cases in all the Text modes, and all Map modes from A through F which generate 8 or fewer color clocks per byte of screen memory.

==== Hi-Res Last Line Bug ====
A display list should not be built with a hi-res (Mode F) instruction in scan line 247—the last displayable scan line. If the DMACTL Playfield Width bits are not 00 then ANTIC will not generate the vertical sync properly potentially causing display distortion. In any case, this is easy to avoid, since this is not a practical Display List arrangement as this places the Mode line in the overscan area where it is not ordinarily visible.

==== Wide Playfield Horizontal Fine Scrolling ====
The Horizontal Fine Scrolling display list modifier causes ANTIC to fetch extra screen memory corresponding to the next larger Playfield width which provides the data needed to scroll into the display. Since there is no Playfield width larger than the Wide Playfield, ANTIC has no extra data for fine scrolling. ANTIC presents fake data for the area emptied by the shifted screen—on the left side of the display the background color will be shifted in and on the right side a few color clocks of random data will appear at the end of the scrolling range. This pixel data is not usually noticeable, since this occurs in the overscan area where it is not ordinarily visible. However, if these false Playfield pixels intersect Player/Missile pixels a collision will be flagged. The solution for Players/Missiles that have moved into the overscan area is to reset their positions to zero to remove them from the display and so prevent false collisions.
