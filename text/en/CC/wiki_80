<text>Oscar Ignatius Joannes van Dillen (born 25 June 1958 in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch) is a Dutch composer, conductor, and instrumentalist.

==Education==
Van Dillen studied North-Indian classical music (sitar, tabla, vocal) with Jamaluddin Bhartiya at the Tritantri School in Amsterdam and bansuri with Gurbachan Singh Sachdev at the Bansuri School of Music in Berkeley, California from 1977 to 1980, as well as classical and jazz flute at the Sweelinck Conservatory in Amsterdam between 1982 and 1984. Here, he also received composition lessons from Misha Mengelberg.

After studies of medieval and Renaissance music with Paul Van Nevel in Leuven (Belgium), he studied classical composition with, among others, Dick Raaymakers and Gilius van Bergeijk at the Koninklijk Conservatory in The Hague in 1990/1991 and with Klaas de Vries, Peter-Jan Wagemans and René Uijlenhoet at the Rotterdam Conservatory from 1996 to 2002. He also studied composition with Manfred Trojahn at the Robert Schumann College in Düsseldorf in 2001, where he also received lessons in conducting from Lutz Herbig.

==Employment and affiliation==
Van Dillen teaches World music composition as well as music theory in the jazz, pop and world music department at the Conservatory of Rotterdam. He lives in the same city.

He is a member of Componisten 96, a closely restricted association for the promotion of composing in the Netherlands.

He was the first chairperson of the Dutch chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation and among its founders. From December 2006 to July 2007 he was a member of the of the Wikimedia Foundation. He is also the vice president of The Netherlands - Turkey Friendship Foundation.

He is a founding member of the Rotterdam School of composers.

==Works and projects==
On 22 February 2008 his work &quot;Paradox – Music for a Sculpture&quot; was performed at the Boymans Van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam.

On 21 November 2008 his *&quot;2 Cameras @ Sea&quot; (2008) premiered at Muziekgebouw aan &#x27;t IJ, Amsterdam during SHIFT, the Canadian and Dutch Arts Festival. Van Dillen composed the music for the Canadian ensemble &quot;Continuum Contemporary Music&quot;.

<doc id="867288" wikidata="Q1436704" url="?curid=867288" title="Ford Pinto engine">
<text>The Ford Pinto engine was the unofficial name for a four-cylinder internal combustion engine built by Ford Europe. In Ford sales literature, it was referred to as the EAO or OHC engine and because it was designed to the metric system, it was sometimes called the &quot;metric engine&quot;. The internal Ford codename for the unit was the T88-series engine. European Ford service literature refers to it as the Taunus In-Line engine (hence the TL codenames). In North America it was known as the Lima In-Line (LL), or simply the Lima engine due to its being manufactured at Lima Engine in Lima, Ohio.

It was used in many European Ford cars and was exported to the United States to be used in the Ford Pinto, a successful subcompact car of the 1970s, hence the name which is used most often for the unit. In Britain, it is commonly used in many kit cars and hot rods, especially in the 2-litre size.

==Pinto OHC (TL)==
In Europe, the Pinto OHC was introduced in 1970 to replace the Essex V4 used in the Corsair as that range was subsumed into the Mk3 Cortina and Taunus V4 for the German Fords range (mainly the new Taunus TC). It was the first Ford engine to feature a belt-driven overhead camshaft. Early Pinto engines suffered from excessive cam and follower wear, this was later addressed by nitriding the cam lobes and followers, and the fitment of a spray bar, which sprayed oil directly at the camshaft. All standard production Pinto engines had a cast iron cylinder block and a cast iron, crossflow, single overhead camshaft cylinder head with two valves per cylinder operated by finger followers.

Applications:
* Ford Taunus/Ford Cortina (TC1 (1970-76), TC2 (1976–82))
* Ford Escort Mk1 RS2000
* Ford Escort Mk2 RS2000, Mexico 
* Ford Capri (Mk2 and Mk3 (1974–86))
* Ford Sierra (1982–1992)
* Ford Granada Mk1 and Mk2 (Mk1 (1974–77); Mk2 (1977–85))
* Ford Scorpio/Granada Mk3
* Ford Transit (1978–1994)
* TVR Tasmin 200

The Pinto engine was available in five displacements: , earlier , later , and the . Later . Due to emission requirements, it was phased out towards the end of the 1980s to be replaced by the CVH engine and DOHC engine, the latter being (contrary to popular belief) a completely new design and not a twin-cam development of the Pinto unit. The only DOHC direct derivative of Pinto engine is the Cosworth YB 16-valve engine, powering Ford Sierra and Ford Escort RS Cosworth variants and featuring a cast aluminium alloy cylinder head developed specially by Cosworth fitted to a modified Pinto cast iron block.

The final Pinto engines used in Ford of Europe production vehicles were the litre versions used in the Sierra until 1992, and the last units were used in the Transit until 1994.

===1.3 (TL13)===
The smallest member of the family was the which had a bore and stroke.
It was produced in two compression ratio versions:
* TL13L – the low compression (LC) variant, which developed / depending on carburetor model, had a compression ratio of 8.0:1 and the engine codes started with &#x27;JA&#x27;
* TL13H — the high compression (HC) variant, which developed / depending on carburetor model had a compression ratio of 9.0:1 and the engine codes started with &#x27;JC&#x27;
The fuel was supplied by the Motorcraft single-barrel (1V) carburetor in the early models (until April 1979), and Motorcraft VV (&quot;variable venturi&quot;) carburetor for the vehicles built after April 1979.

Applications:
* 1970–1982 Ford Taunus (engine codes JAA/JCA, JAC/JCC, JAR/JCR)
* 1972–1974 Ford Capri (engine code JCE)
* 1982–1984 Ford Sierra (engine code JCT)

=== 1.6 (TL16)===

====Early low compression variant (TL16L)====
Initially, the had a bore of and shared the crankshaft with the 1.3 L model with a stroke of giving the displacement of .
The TL16L had a compression ratio of 8.2:1 and developed of power and of torque depending on the carburetor and application. As the 1.3 L model, it used the Motorcraft 1V and, later, the Motorcraft VV carburetors. The engine code of the low compression variant started with &#x27;LA&#x27;.

Applications:
* 1970–1982 Ford Taunus / Ford Cortina (engine codes LAA, LAD, LAR)
* 1979–1986 Ford Transit (engine code LAT)
* 1975–1985 Ford Capri (engine codes LAC, LAN)

====Early high compression variant (TL16H)====
The HC version of the early had the same bore and stroke as the LC version, but the compression ratio was higher (9.2:1), allowing it to produce of power and of torque. It used the same carburetor models as the low compression version (Motorcraft 1V and Motorcraft VV).

Applications:
* 1970–1982 Ford Taunus / Ford Cortina (engine codes LCA, LCJ, LCR)
* 1982–1992 Ford Sierra (engine codes LCT, LCS)
* 1975–1985 Ford Capri (engine codes LCE, LCN)
* 1981–1985 Ford Granada (engine code LCK)
* 1983–1984 Anadol A8-16 SL

====Increased performance (GT) variant (TL16G)====
From the beginning of the production run, the had a special, &#x27;sporty&#x27; version which featured:
* modified cylinder head (larger inlet valves and 2.0 L camshaft with higher valve lifts)
* DGAV 32/36 Weber carburetor
* tubular exhaust manifold
With such an improvement package, the engine produced of power and of torque.

Applications:
* 1970–1973 Ford Taunus GT (engine code LEA)
* 1970–1976 Ford Taunus GXL (engine code LEA)
* 1970-1976 Ford Cortina GT (engine code LEA)
* 1970–1976 Ford Cortina GXL (engine code LEA)
* 1976–1982 Ford Taunus / Ford Cortina S / GLS / Ghia S (engine codes LEC, LEE)
* 1975–1978 Ford Escort Mexico
* 1972–1976 Ford Capri GT (engine codes LEC, LEE)

====Late variant (TL16E)====
At the beginning of 1984, Ford Pinto engine displacement range switched from 1.3/1.6/2.0 to 1.6/1.8/2.0. The newly introduced 1.8 L engine used the 2.0 L crankshaft, so to uniform engine parts for the whole range after dropping the 1.3 L — the 1.6 L was redesigned to also take the 2.0 L crankshaft which had a stroke. This of course led to bringing the bore down to to keep the displacement within range — it was now . The TL16E became now the only available 1.6 L engine of the Pinto range. Although the compression ratio was raised to 9.5:1, the power figures did not differ much from the earlier TL16H version — the engine developed of power and of torque.
This engine is sometimes referred to as 1.6 E-Max engine.

Applications:
* 1984–1989 Ford Sierra (engine codes LSE, LSD)

===1.8 (TL18H)===
The Pinto engine was introduced in 1984 as a replacement for the &quot;old&quot; 1.6 L. The engine had an bore and stroke giving the displacement of . Output was of power and . Fuel was supplied by the Pierburg 2E3 28/32 carburetor.

Applications:
* 1984–1989 Ford Sierra (engine codes REB, RED, REF)
* 1985–1992 Ford Scorpio (engine code REC)

=== 2.0 (TL20)===
The was used in many Ford vehicles from the early 1970s. Due to its robustness and high tuning potential, it was often used as an aftermarket engine upgrade or base for building race and rally engines — not exclusively in Ford cars. The engine has bore of and stroke giving the displacement of .
It was manufactured in several variants:

====Low compression variant (TL20L)====
Three completely different LC variants of the 2.0 L were produced.
One was used on the 1970–1982 Ford Taunus export version to Sweden — fitted with the Weber DGAV 32/32 carburetor and compression ratio lowered to 8.2:1 to meet the rigorous emission specifications; it delivered of power and of torque.
The second one was used on 1978–1991 Ford Transits and P100 models. With modified induction and Motorcraft 1V carburetor, it produced of power and of torque available at only 2800 rpm. The compression ratio in this case was also 8.2:1. The Transits also used the third variant called the &quot;Economy&quot; engine. The power figure of this one was even lower — it developed only .

Applications:
* 1970–1982 Ford Taunus Sweden export version (engine code NA)
* 1978–1994 Ford Transit (engine codes NAT, NAV, NAW, NAX, NBA)
* 1988–1993 Ford P100 (engine code NAE)
* 1977–1986 Ford Transit &quot;Economy&quot; version (engine code NUT)

====Standard (high compression) variant (TL20H)====
Although Ford marked its standard 2.0 L engine as HC, it actually uses engine codes meant for the &#x27;increased performance variant&#x27; engines (coding starting with &#x27;NE&#x27;), these have a compression ratio of to 9.2:1.
This engine used different carburetor models across the years:
* Weber DGAV 32/36 - on all cars up to 1987
* Weber DFTH 30/34 - from 1987 until the end of production run (1989)
* Weber DFAV 32/36 - on engines exported to USA

The engine produced of power and of torque, though a few models with a higher output were produced (for example an version used in 1976 Ford Escort RS2000).

Applications:
* 1973–1980 Ford Escort RS2000 (engine codes NEA, NE)
* 1974–1982 Ford Taunus / Ford Cortina (engine codes NEG, NER)
* 1975–1985 Ford Capri (engine codes NEE, NEN)
* 1973–1984 Ford Granada (engine codes NEB, NEH, NEK)
* 1983–1989 Ford Sierra (engine codes NES, NET, NEJ, NE5)
* 1985–1989 Ford Granada and Ford Scorpio (engine code NEL, NER, NE4)
* 1971–1974 Ford Pinto

====Injection variant (TL20EFI)====
The injected 2.0 L used the Ford EEC-IV engine control system which brought the output up to of power and of torque, although much of this increased performance can be attributed to the improved design of the EFI variants cylinder head. As the EEC-IV installation on most of those engines contains some Bosch parts that are easily visible in the engine compartment (air flow meter of the electromechanical &quot;flap&quot; type, injectors, fuel pressure regulator etc.), it is often - but falsely believed that they are fitted with the Bosch L-Jetronic injection system.
Some of the TL20EFI engines have closed-loop lambda control, while others are lacking that feature.

Applications:
* 1985–1992 Ford Sierra (engine codes N4, NRD, N4B: 74 kW; NRB, NR2, N4A, N4I: 85 kW)
* 1985–1992 Ford Granada and Ford Scorpio (engine code NRA, NRC, NRI)
* 1991–1994 Ford Transit (engine code NCA)

====Single point injection variant (TL20CFI)====
This variant was used in Ford Transit exclusively. The power output was .

Applications:
* 1985–1992 Ford Transit (engine code N6T)

====Cosworth YB (CH20EFI)====
In the beginning of the 1980s, Cosworth developed a 16-valve performance head conversion for the Pinto engine. This was seen by a Ford executive who asked Cosworth to develop it with a turbo for use in the new Ford Sierra RS Cosworth.
The engine is therefore based on a modified Pinto block topped with the Cosworth-developed alloy head and Garrett turbo.

==Lima OHC (LL)==

The &quot;Lima&quot; versions of the engine debuted in form in the Ford Pinto, but although they share their basic architecture with the European version (and to a casual observer, look almost identical), they actually have few interchangeable parts. The European version did find its way into North America however in the Mercury Capri, which was a captive import from Ford of Europe&#x27;s factories in Germany.

===2.0===
The 2.0 litre version was a narrower-bore version of the original 2.3 liter &quot;Lima&quot; four. Bore and stroke are , respectively, for an overall displacement of . This engine was installed in the 1983–1988 Ford Rangers and in some Argentinian Ford Taunus.

;Applications:
* Ford Ranger (North America)
* Ford Taunus Argentina models

===2.3 (LL23)===

The Ford Pinto used the OHC version, a unit introduced in 1974 which has a bore and stroke. This version lasted until 1997 in various guises. The earliest units produced and . This engine has also been known as the Lima engine, after the Lima Engine plant in Lima, Ohio, where it was first manufactured (it was also manufactured in Brazil starting in 1974).

In 1979–80, a draw-through, non-intercooled turbo version was produced for Mustang Cobras and some Capris. Lack of dealership and owner training resulted in many stuck turbochargers and other maintenance problems. They were limited to of boost, though Ford Motorsport sold a wastegate with an adjustable rod which allowed an increase up to . It was used in this carbureted form in a number of passenger cars, from the Fairmont Futura Turbo to the 1979 Indy Pace Car edition Mustang.

In 1983, Ford introduced a fuel-injected version of the turbocharged engine, which was used in the Thunderbird Turbo Coupe and the Turbo GT trim of the Mustang. In 1984, the Mustang SVO was introduced with an intercooler, initially producing and later increased to in 1985½. After the SVO was discontinued, the intercooler was added to the Turbo Coupe. Output for this turbo/intercooled version was and for the 1987–88 models with the five-speed (T-5) manual transmission. In addition to the 1983–1984 Mustang Turbo GT and 1983–1986 Turbo Coupe, the non-intercooled version of the engine was also used in the 1985–89 Merkur XR4Ti and 1984–1986 Mercury Cougar XR7, producing and .

A version with two spark plugs per cylinder, distributor-less ignition, and reduced main bearing sizes was introduced in the 1989 Ford Ranger and 1991 Ford Mustang. This engine produced and .

<doc id="867295" wikidata="Q884027" url="?curid=867295" title="Alfred A. Taylor">
<text>Alfred Alexander Taylor (August 6, 1848 – November 25, 1931) was an American politician and lecturer from eastern Tennessee. He served as the 34th governor of Tennessee from 1921 to 1923, one of three Republicans to hold the position from the end of Reconstruction to the latter half of the 20th century. He also served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, from 1889 to 1895.

In 1886, Taylor ran for governor against his younger brother, Democrat Robert Love Taylor (1850–1912), in a memorable campaign known as the &quot;War of the Roses.&quot; Canvassing the state together, the brothers often engaged in light-hearted banter and played fiddles, in contrast to previous gubernatorial campaigns, which involved fierce debates. Taylor ran for governor again in 1910, but lost his party&#x27;s nomination to Ben W. Hooper. He was victorious in 1920 due in large part to divisions within the Democratic Party over taxes and women&#x27;s suffrage.

==Early life==
Taylor was born in the Happy Valley community of Carter County, Tennessee, the second son of Nathaniel Green Taylor, a congressman, Methodist minister, and poet, and Emaline Haynes Taylor, an accomplished pianist. Nathaniel Taylor was a Whig (many of whom later became Republicans), while his wife&#x27;s family, among them her brother, Landon Carter Haynes, were Democrats. Alfred followed his father into the Republican Party, while his brother, Robert, followed their mother&#x27;s family into the Democratic Party.

Taylor attended Duffield Academy in Elizabethton, Tennessee and Buffalo Institute (modern Milligan College) in Carter County, Tennessee. Following the outbreak of the Civil War, Nathaniel Taylor supported the Union, and the Taylors were forced to move to the North. During this period, Alfred attended Pennington Seminary in Pennington, New Jersey.

In 1867, Taylor accompanied his father, then Commissioner of Indian Affairs under President Andrew Johnson, to join the Indian Peace Commission in Kansas in an effort to end the Plains Wars. The commission negotiated the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the southern Plains Indians, bringing about their removal to reservations in Indian Territory. In 1924, Taylor wrote an account of this trip and published it in the &quot;Chronicles of Oklahoma&quot;.

After his study of law, Taylor was admitted to the bar in 1870 and commenced practice in Jonesborough, Tennessee.

==Early political career==
Taylor was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1874, and served one term. Among his initiatives was the creation of Unicoi County in 1875. He would later refer to the county as, &quot;my baby.&quot; Taylor served as an elector for Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, and would serve as an elector in the three subsequent presidential campaigns.

In 1878, Taylor sought his party&#x27;s nomination for the 1st district congressional seat held by Augustus Pettibone. Although Taylor had popular support, Pettibone managed to win the nomination at the party&#x27;s convention, angering Taylor&#x27;s supporters. Taylor&#x27;s brother, Robert (a Democrat), ran against Pettibone in the general election, and with the support of both Democrats and his brother&#x27;s disgruntled supporters, captured the seat. He was defeated for reelection by Pettibone after just one term, and no Democrat has been elected to the seat since.

In Tennessee&#x27;s 1886 gubernatorial race, Republicans, hoping to exploit divisions within the Democratic Party, nominated Alfred Taylor as their candidate. Democrats nominated his brother, Robert, believing him the best person to unite the party and counter Alfred&#x27;s popular appeal. The brothers canvassed the state together, drawing large crowds, and engaging in light-hearted political debate and playing fiddles while the crowd danced. At a stop in Madisonville, Robert stated that he and Alfred were both roses, though he was a white rose while Alfred was a red rose. When their respective supporters wore white and red roses, the contest became known as the &quot;War of the Roses&quot; (the name also hearkened to the 15th-century English conflict). On election day, Robert won by about 16,000 votes.

The 1886 campaign boosted Alfred Taylor&#x27;s popularity. In 1888, he successfully ran for the 1st district congressional seat, defeating Democrat David P. Wilcox by 7,000 votes. He was reelected in 1890, edging Roderick R. Butler (who ran as an independent) by less than a thousand votes. He was reelected to a third term in 1892. During his congressional tenure, Taylor supported the McKinley Tariff, a protectionist measure that raised tariffs on imports by 50%. He also supported the Lodge Bill, which would have provided protections for black voters in the South.

After leaving Congress, Taylor joined his brother, Robert, on the lecture circuit. They cowrote and presented a popular lecture entitled &quot;Yankee Doodle and Dixie.&quot; The tour was a major financial success, netting the brothers tens of thousands of dollars.

In 1906, Taylor ran as an independent for the 1st district seat against state Republican Party boss, Walter P. Brownlow, but was defeated by a substantial margin. In 1910, Taylor sought the Republican nomination for governor, but was defeated by Ben W. Hooper. Hooper then proceeded to defeat Alfred&#x27;s brother, Robert, in the general election.

==Governor==

In 1920, the 71-year-old Taylor was nominated by Republicans for governor. His opponent was the Democratic incumbent, Albert H. Roberts, who had alienated a significant portion of his party by enacting unpopular tax reforms and helping ratify the 19th Amendment (which gave women the right to vote). On the campaign trail, Taylor travelled with a four-piece quartet (consisting of three of his sons and their friend), and told the story of &quot;Old Limber,&quot; a foxhound who, in spite of his old age, could still outrun the pack. As he also supported the 19th Amendment, he campaigned primarily against Roberts&#x27; tax reforms. On election day, he defeated Roberts 229,143 votes to 185,890. It was the state&#x27;s first gubernatorial election in which women could vote.

Following his inauguration, Taylor focused on what he termed the &quot;Big Four&quot; issues: tax reform, rural school reform, highways, and the economy. Although most of his agenda was blocked by the state legislature (which was controlled by Democrats), he created the position of tax commissioner, obtained funding for a state historical commission, and resolved several labor disputes. He also helped convince the federal government to convert a nitrate plant built for World War I at Wilson Dam in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, into an electrical power plant for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Tennessee Valley.

In 1922, the Democratic Party nominated former party leader Austin Peay to oppose Taylor for governor. Peay lacked the charisma of Taylor, and resorted to delivering basic stump speeches, in contrast to Taylor&#x27;s entertaining rallies. Peay had the support of entrepreneur Clarence Saunders (the founder of Piggly Wiggly), and with the Democratic Party once again unified, he defeated Taylor on election day, 141,002 votes to 102,586.

==Later life==
Following his defeat in the 1922 governor&#x27;s race, Taylor returned to his farm near Johnson City, Tennessee. He died on November 25, 1931, and was buried in the city&#x27;s Monte Vista Cemetery.

==Family==
Taylor&#x27;s great-grandfather, General Nathaniel Taylor (1771–1816), served during the War of 1812. Another great-grandfather, Landon Carter (1760–1800), was a Revolutionary War veteran for whom Carter County was named. Taylor&#x27;s uncle, Landon Carter Haynes, was a leading East Tennessee Democrat during the Civil War, and served in the Confederate Senate. Taylor was a cousin of Nathaniel Edwin Harris, who served as Governor of Georgia from 1915 to 1917.

Taylor married Jennie Anderson in 1881, and they had ten children together. Their son, Robert Love Taylor (1899–1987), named for Alfred&#x27;s brother, became a United States federal judge.

<doc id="867300" wikidata="Q2135735" url="?curid=867300" title="BFI TV 100">
<text>The BFI TV 100 is a list of 100 television programmes or series that was compiled in 2000 by the British Film Institute (BFI), as chosen by a poll of industry professionals, with the aim to determine the best British television programmes of any genre that had been screened up to that time.

==Selection and criteria==

The British Film Institute television programme poll was conducted in the year 2000, and its results are reflected in the list that appears in a following section. Initially, a &#x27;big list&#x27; of 650 programmes was drawn up by BFI personnel. Television programmes no longer extant in the archives were excluded from consideration. The provisional list was split into six categories: Single Dramas, Drama Series and Serials, Comedy and Variety, Factual, Children&#x27;s/Youth, and Lifestyle &amp; Light Entertainment. Some programmes were represented in the list by an entire series; however, for some series—e.g., the anthology &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; and the current affairs programme &quot;This Week&quot;—individual episodes were listed. News stories were mostly excluded, with exceptions such as the coverage of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales (on the basis that it would be impossible to determine whether it was the coverage or the news itself that made them important). Sport was excluded for similar reasons, and also because many events such as the 1966 World Cup, while important to those in England, would not necessarily matter to those in other areas of the UK.

The provisional list of 650 was then distributed to 1,600 television industry professionals in the UK, who were each given 30 votes. Each voter was required to cast a minimum of three votes in every category. The judges were also asked to name their top overseas programme (where the U.S. sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot; was chosen).

== List ==
The following are the results of the poll, as reported by the BFI and other sources. Because the list reports decisions made in the year 2000, programmes and series are presented as they were perceived in that year; as such, ones not yet having concluded by the year 2000 are presented as having an open-ended date span in the &quot;Year(s)&quot; column, even if they have subsequently ended. The Genre column, added to the original table, may have a lot of crossover genres and is intended as guide to the &quot;main&quot; genre of each programme.
BBC led broadcasters in terms of numbers of programmes/series produced, with 70. Granada Television was the second most represented with 7, and Thames Television and Channel 4 tied for third with 6 each. Central produced four of the listed titles, while ATV produced two, and London Weekend Television, ABC Weekend TV and Associated-Rediffusion produced one each.

<doc id="867306" wikidata="Q2274271" url="?curid=867306" title="Stonyhurst College">
<text>Stonyhurst College or Stonyhurst is a co-educational Catholic public school providing education for boarding and day pupils, adhering to the Jesuit tradition. It is based on the Stonyhurst Estate, next to the village of Hurst Green, in Lancashire, in the United Kingdom. It occupies a Grade I listed building. The school has been fully co-educational since 1999. It is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference. 

A precursor institution of the college was founded in 1593 by Father Robert Persons SJ at St Omer, at a time when penal laws prohibited Catholic education in England. It relocated to Stonyhurst Hall in 1794, having moved already to Bruges in 1762 and Liège in 1773, after an old boy, Thomas Weld (of Lulworth), granted it the Stonyhurst estate. It provides boarding and day education to approximately 450 boys and girls aged 13–18. On an adjacent site, its preparatory school, St Mary&#x27;s Hall, provides education for boys and girls aged 3–13.

Its alumni/ae include three Saints, twelve &quot;Beati&quot;, twenty-two martyrs, seven archbishops, seven Victoria Cross winners, a Peruvian president and prime minister, a New Zealand Prime Minister, a signatory of the American Declaration of Independence and a number of writers, sportsmen, politicians, and European royals.

==History==
===Stonyhurst Hall===

The earliest deed concerning the &quot;Stanihurst&quot; is held in the college&#x27;s Arundell Library; it dates from approximately 1200. In 1372, a licence was granted to John de Bayley for an oratory on the site. His descendants, the Shireburn family, completed the oldest portion of the extant buildings. Richard Shireburn began building the hall, which was enlarged by his grandson Nicholas who also constructed the ponds, avenue and gardens. Following his death, the estate passed to his wife and then to sole heir, their daughter, Mary, the Duchess of Norfolk.

===The college===
The story of the school may be traced back to establishments in St Omer in what was then the Spanish Netherlands in 1593, where a college, under the Royal Patronage of Philip II of Spain, was founded by Fr Robert Persons SJ for English boys unable to receive a Catholic education in Elizabethan England. As such it was one of several expatriate English schools operating on the European mainland. In 1762, the Jesuits were forced to flee and re-established their school at Bruges. The school was moved in 1773 to Liège, where it operated for two decades before moving to Stonyhurst on 29 August 1794.

The number of students increased during the 19th century: the Society of Jesus was re-established in Britain at Stonyhurst in 1803, and over the century, student numbers rose from the original twelve migrants from Liège. By the turn of the following century, it had become England&#x27;s largest Catholic college. Stonyhurst Hall underwent extensive alterations and additions to accommodate these numbers; the Old South Front was constructed in 1810, only to be demolished and replaced with larger buildings in the 1880s. A seminary was constructed on the estate, and an observatory and meteorological station erected in the gardens. The 20th century saw the gradual hiring of a mostly lay staff, as the number of Jesuits declined. The seminary at St Mary&#x27;s Hall was closed, and the school discontinued its education of university-aged philosophers.

Since the Second World War, the buildings have been refurbished or developed. Additions include new science buildings in the 1950s and 1960s, a new boarding wing in the 1960s, a new swimming pool in the 1980s and Weld House in 2010. The school became fully co-educational in 1999.

==Hodder Place, St Mary&#x27;s Hall and Hodder House==

The original preparatory school to Stonyhurst, Hodder Place, came into the hands of the Jesuits as part of the estate donated by alumnus Thomas Weld. Originally used as a novitiate, it became a preparatory school to the college in 1807.

St Mary&#x27;s Hall, on an adjoining site to Stonyhurst, was built as a Jesuit seminary in 1828 (extended in the 1850s) and functioned until 1926, when the seminarians moved to Heythrop Hall. The poet Gerard Manley Hopkins, and John Tolkien, son of J. R. R. Tolkien, trained as priests there. During World War II, the English College left Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italy and occupied the hall. After their return to Rome, St Mary&#x27;s Hall opened as a middle school in 1946. At the same time, Hodder Place continued to educate those aged eight to eleven, until its closure and conversion into flats in 1970. Hodder Place pupils moved up to St Mary&#x27;s Hall to form Hodder Playroom. As successor to Hodder Place, St Mary&#x27;s Hall claims to being one of the oldest surviving preparatory school in Britain.

In 2004, the old gymnasium at St Mary&#x27;s Hall was converted into new nursery and infant facilities named Hodder House, for those aged three to seven.

==Religious life==
The college is Catholic and has had a significant place in English Catholic history for many centuries (including events such as the Popish Plot and Gunpowder Plot conspiracies). It was founded initially to educate English Catholics on the continent in the hope that, through them, Catholicism might be restored in England.

After the school settled in England in 1794 and the Society of Jesus was officially re-established in Britain in 1803. Stonyhurst remained the headquarters of their English Province until the middle of the century; by 1851, a third of the province&#x27;s Jesuits were based there. Until the 1920s, Jesuit priests were trained on site in what is today the preparatory school. There was a drop in vocations after World War I and the seminary was closed. The number of Jesuits teaching at Stonyhurst fell to a third of the staff within a decade. Since then, the Jesuit presence has been in decline, but the school continues to place Catholicism and Jesuit philosophy at its core under the guidance of a Jesuit-led chaplaincy team and the involvement of the Jesuits in its governance.

It is a long-standing practice, as with many Jesuit schools around the world, that pupils write A.M.D.G. in the top left hand corner of any piece of work they do. It stands for the Latin phrase &quot;Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam&quot; which means &quot;For the Greater Glory of God&quot;. At the end of a piece of work they write L.D.S. in the centre of the page. It stands for &quot;Laus Deo Semper&quot; which means &quot;Praise to God Always&quot;. These are both traditional Jesuit mottoes.

===Chapels===
The school has one main church, St Peter&#x27;s, and five chapels: the Boys&#x27; Chapel, the Chapel of the Angels, the Sodality Chapel, the St Francis Chapel and the St Ignatius Chapel. The last two are both within the towers of St Peter&#x27;s Church. The Sodality Chapel is the home of the relics of the 3rd-century Roman convert St Gordianus. The Jesuits brought his remains from the College of St Omer and held them beneath the altar since 1859. His bones were temporarily removed in 2006 while the chapel underwent restoration, but they have since been returned. The chapel is again used by the re-established Sodality. Adjacent to the Old Infirmary is the Rosary Garden, a place for spiritual contemplation, at the centre of which is a stone statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary. St Peter&#x27;s Church underwent repair and refurbishment in 2010–11.

==Charitable status==
As a registered charity, Stonyhurst is obliged to provide benefits to the wider community under the terms of the Charities Act 2006. As such, the college is home to the local Catholic parish church, which receives worshippers from Hurst Green every day. Its sports facilities, including the swimming pool and all-weather pitch are available for public use; the latter was used for competitors training for the London 2012 Olympic Games. Much of the estate has public access. Many of its facilities such as its swimming pool, leisure complex, golf course, grounds and museum are open to the public. The school has relationships with several state schools, arranging shared activities with their pupils, in particular those serving special needs children. In addition, the school makes available some places to pupils offered on scholarship, bursaries or free of charge; almost a third of current pupils receive financial support for their places.

==Motto==
The French motto refers to all-round development of the individual. It is inherited from the Shireburn family who once owned the original mansion on the site; the family emblem is emblazoned, in stone, with the motto, above the fireplace in the Top Refectory.

==Academic==
At the school, 93% of GCSE students attain 9-4 grades; there is a 100% pass rate at A-Level; and 100% of A-Level leavers take up places at universities (10% to Oxbridge) or on gap year schemes. The school&#x27;s most recent inspection rated much of the education and pastoral provision as &#x27;outstanding&#x27;. In 2023, 40% of students scored A*-A for A Levels while 46% of students that took the GCSEs scored 9-7.

Education during the college&#x27;s early history was based on St Ignatius&#x27; &quot;Ratio Studiorum&quot;, with emphasis upon theology, classics and science, all of which still feature prominently in the curriculum. The educational practice, observed at the College of St Omer, of dividing a class into Romans and Carthaginians continued long after the migration to Stonyhurst but is not employed today; each pupil would be pitched against an opponent with the task of picking up on the other&#x27;s mistakes in an attempt to score points.

Until Catholics were admitted to Oxbridge in 1854, Stonyhurst was also home to &quot;philosopher gentlemen&quot; studying BA courses under the London Matriculation Examination system. Their numbers began to fall after 1894 and the department was closed in 1916.

==Libraries and collections==
Stonyhurst College has four main libraries: the Arundell, the Bay, the Square and the More (dedicated to Saint Thomas More).

The More Library is the main library for students while the &#x27;House Libraries&#x27; (the Arundell, the Bay, and the Square) contain many artefacts from the Society of Jesus and English Catholicism. The Arundell Library, presented in 1837 by Everard, 11th Baron Arundell of Wardour, is the most significant; it is not only a country-house library from Wardour Castle but also has a notable collection of 250 incunabula, medieval manuscripts and volumes of Jacobite interest, signal among which is Mary Tudor&#x27;s Book of Hours, which it is believed was given by Mary, Queen of Scots to her chaplain on the scaffold. The manuscript &quot;Le Livre de Seyntz Medicines&quot; was written in 1354 by Henry, Duke of Lancaster. To these were added the archives of the English Province of the Society of Jesus, which include 16th-century manuscript verses by St Robert Southwell SJ, the letters of St Edmund Campion SJ (1540–81) and holographs of the 19th-century poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. The Arundell Library has a copy of the &quot;Chronicles of Jean Froissart&quot;, captured at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, and held the 7th-century Stonyhurst Gospel of St John before it was loaned to the British Library, as well as a First Folio of Shakespeare.
Among those collections kept away from public view are numerous blood-soaked garments from Jesuits martyred in Japan, the skull of Cardinal Morton, ropes used to quarter St Edmund Campion SJ, hair of St Francis Xavier SJ, an enormous solid silver jewel-encrusted monstrance, the Wintour vestments, a cope made for Henry VII, and a thorn said to be from the crown of thorns placed upon Jesus&#x27; head at the crucifixion.

The school owns paintings, including a portrait of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia and another of the Jesuit Henry Garnet. In the Stuart Parlour are portraits of Jacobites including James Francis Edward Stuart, and his sons Charles Edward Stuart and Henry Benedict Stuart. There are also several original engravings by Rembrandt and Dürer, such as the &#x27;Greater Passion&#x27; and the &#x27;Car of Maximillian&#x27;.

==Observatory==

The school has a functioning observatory which was built in 1866. An older observatory, built in 1838, is now the &quot;Typographia Collegii&quot;, but was once one of seven important stations in the country when the Meteorological Office came under the auspices of the Royal Society. The records of temperature taken there start from 1846 and are the oldest continuous daily records in the world. During the nineteenth century, the observatory was maintained by the astronomer priests, Fr Alfred Weld, Fr Perry and Fr Sidgreaves whose research included astronomy, geomagnetrometry and seismology. Astrophysicist Pietro Angelo Secchi, director of the Vatican Observatory, also taught astronomy at the college during the period. Sir Edward Sabine chose the observatory as one of his main stations when conducting a magnetic survey of Britain in 1858. Five years later Fr Sidgreaves began the first series of monthly geometric observations, which continued until May 1919. During the course of the twentieth century, the observatory fell out of use and its telescope, parts of which dated to the 1860s, was sold after the Second World War. When its private owner came to sell it, the college was able to buy it back and restore it to its original home. The observatory is today used for astronomical purposes again, whilst also functioning as one of four weather stations used by the Met Office to provide central England temperature data (CET).

==Arts==
===Music, drama and art===
There are two choirs: the Chapel Choir, which sings regularly at Mass, and the &quot;Schola Cantorum&quot;, composed of teachers and pupils, of all ages.

The school has two theatres and has after-school programs, lessons, and sessions in drama and msuic. In September 2024, a new dance studio was opened. The college has a traditional theatre, the Academy Room, and a high-tech theatre built at St Mary&#x27;s Hall as part of the Centenaries Appeal in 1993. The latter plays host to the annual Ribble Valley International Piano Week. Several former pupils have gone on to achieve success upon the stage, including OSCAR-winning actor and director Charles Laughton and BAFTA-winning director and producer Peter Glenville.

There is a dedicated art studio in addition to a separate design and technology centre. Student artwork is displayed on the walls of the Lower Gallery, including a portrait of the Queen painted by Isobel Bidwell during the Golden Jubilee year; upon receipt of a copy, the Queen&#x27;s lady-in-waiting said that &quot;The Queen was delighted to see the painting and know that it is on display in the school&quot;.

===Literary associations===
Stonyhurst has provided inspiration for poets and authors who include former classics teacher Gerard Manley Hopkins, whose poems feature details of the local countryside, and former pupil Sir Arthur Conan Doyle whose &quot;Baskerville Hall&quot; was modelled on Stonyhurst Hall, and who named Sherlock Holmes&#x27; nemesis, Moriarty, after a fellow pupil. J. R. R. Tolkien wrote part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in a classroom on the Upper Gallery during his stay at the college where his son taught Classics; his &quot;Middle-earth&quot; is said to resemble the local area, while there are specific resonances in names such as &quot;Shire Lane&quot;, (the name of a road in Hurst Green) and the &quot;River Shirebourn&quot; (the Shireburns built Stonyhurst). Poet Laureate Alfred Austin, and the poet Oliver St John Gogarty (&quot;Stately plump Buck Mulligan&quot; in James Joyce&#x27;s Ulysses) were educated at the school, (as were the sons of Oscar Wilde and Evelyn Waugh). George Archer-Shee, at the centre of Terence Rattigan&#x27;s play &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot;, is an alumnus.

The school runs its own publication company, St Omer&#x27;s Press, which publishes religious literature, and first began when the college was located at St Omer in Flanders.

==Sport==
===Rugby===
 has played a big part in the life of the school, despite only supplanting football as the school&#x27;s primary sport in 1921. Sporting rivalry is particularly prominent against fellow Catholic independent schools Ampleforth College, Mount St Mary&#x27;s College and Sedbergh School in Cumbria. The Stonyhurst Sevens take place annually.

The school has produced sixteen international rugby players (England (5), Ireland (6), Scotland (1) Italy (1), the USA (1) Bermuda (1) and the Bahamas (1)), as well as players for the Barbarians and the British and Irish Lions. Most recently they include Iain Balshaw and Kyran Bracken, who both played for England when they won the 2003 Rugby World Cup, whilst another member of that team, Will Greenwood, went to Stonyhurst Saint Mary&#x27;s Hall, where his mother taught maths until 2007. Current pupils of the school have won places to represent Spain, Mexico (under 19s) the Irish Exiles and the Welsh Exiles (under 19s). Old boys have also played at varsity level and have won blues for Oxford or Cambridge.

Stonyhurst&#x27;s coaches have included former England coaches Dick Greenwood and Brian Ashton who coached the first XV.

===Stonyhurst Football===
Stonyhurst Football, inherited from the College of St Omer (along with Stonyhurst Cricket), was a sport played between the handball walls on the Playground. The game was discontinued with the advent of association football but was re-established in 1988 when a &quot;Grand Match&quot; was played at Great Academies; traditionally a &quot;Grand Match&quot; was played on Shrove Tuesday and was the primary Stonyhurst Football match of the season. The teams were England vs France (although during the Crimean War England vs Russia was played and more recently England vs Ireland was played in the 1980s). The last game took place in 1995.

==Military==

===Officer Training Corps (OTC)===
The Stonyhurst Officer Training Corps assembled for the first time on 16 October 1900, in the Ambulacrum, overseen by The First Volunteer Battalion, the East Lancashire Regiment who gave instruction in drill and musketry. The Corps was granted the honour of representation at the Coronation of 1910 and sent members to the Royal Review at Windsor in 1911. It also appeared on parade annually for the spectacle of the Corpus Christi celebrations until the practice became obsolete after Vatican II.

===Combined Cadet Corps (CCF)===
After the Second World War, school OTCs were succeeded by the Combined Cadet Force. Stonyhurst&#x27;s comprises the following platoons named after Stonyhurst&#x27;s seven Victoria Cross winners:

====Junior company====
* Costello Platoon (Lieutenant Edmund William COSTELLO V.C., Malakand, India 1897)
* Coury Platoon (Second Lieutenant George Gabriel COURY V.C., Guillemont, Somme 1916)
* Liddell Platoon (Captain John Aiden LIDDELL V.C, Ostend, Belgium 1915)
* Kenna Platoon (Captain Paul Aloysius KENNA V.C., Khartoum, Sudan 1898)

====Senior company====
* Dease Platoon (Lieutenant Maurice James DEASE V.C., Mons, Belgium 1914)
* Jackman Platoon (Captain James Joseph Bernard JACKMAN V.C., Ed Duda, Tobruk, 1941)
* Andrews Platoon (Captain Harold Marcus ERVINE-ANDREWS V.C., Dunkirk 1940)
* Support Platoon

===Military careers===

Some pupils have gone on to receive places at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. This follows a long tradition of service from Stonyhurst pupils: many &quot;Old Stonyhurst (O.S.)&quot; were killed in the two World Wars and are commemorated on the war memorial at the end of the Upper Gallery. The Stonyhurst War Records were published in their honour. A memorial at the top of the main staircase records the names of the six O.S. killed in the Boer War.

==School organisation==
===Playroom system===

Unlike most English public schools, Stonyhurst is organised horizontally by year groups (known as playrooms) rather than vertically by houses, although the girls are also split into junior and senior houses.

===Lines===
In addition to the horizontal division of the school into playrooms, there is also a vertical grouping which cuts through the year groups, the &quot;lines&quot;, and is used mostly for competitive purposes in sport and music. The lines and colours are as follows:
* Campion (red) (named after St Edmund Campion)
* St Omers (yellow, though brown for sporting attire) (named after St Omer, the town the school was founded in)
* Shireburn (green) (named after the Shireburn family which built Stonyhurst)
* Weld (blue) (named after Thomas Weld who donated Stonyhurst to the Jesuits)

== Sister schools ==
Stonyhurst College has one sister school in Penang, Malaysia, called Stonyhurst International School Penang.

== Stonyhurst Association ==
After less formal arrangements had been made for many years, the Association was formed in 1879. In 1985, it was granted charitable status by the Charity Commission. Its primary objective is to foster a strong spirit of union amongst past pupils and friends of Stonyhurst, with a strong charitable emphasis.

===Alumni===

Stonyhurst has educated prominent individuals in many areas, from statesmen to sportsmen, and actors to archbishops. Seven alumni have been awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry; paintings of them adorn the walls of the Top Refectory in the school.

==Controversy==
James Chaning-Pearce, a priest who taught at the school, was jailed for sexually assaulting pupils between 1987 and 1995. The youngest victim was a boy of 12. In 1999, the Lancashire Constabulary conducted &quot;Operation Whiting&quot;, which looked into allegations of abuse at the school dating back to the 1970s. This resulted in two convictions, one of which was quashed on appeal. On 14 May 2002, in evidence to the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, journalist David Rose described the operation as &quot;a scandal in itself&quot; and an &quot;expensive... fiasco&quot;.

Another priest, Father Paul Symonds, at Stonyhurst between 1972 and 1979, was arrested in November 2009 for having allegedly abused a 13-year-old boy for three years. The case was dropped by the CPS Lancashire, a year later and was revealed in March 2014.

In 2014, Stonyhurst was fined £100,000 and ordered to pay £31,547.78 in legal costs for the prosecution after pleading guilty to a breach of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 for health and safety failings after a stonemason working for the college developed silicosis, a potentially fatal lung disease. The college made the stonemason, who had worked for the college for almost 12 years, redundant, four months after his diagnosis.

<doc id="867326" wikidata="Q539538" url="?curid=867326" title="Beeston Castle">
<text>Beeston Castle is a former Royal castle in Beeston, Cheshire, England (), perched on a rocky sandstone crag above the Cheshire Plain. It was built in the 1220s by Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester (1170–1232), on his return from the Crusades. In 1237, Henry III took over the ownership of Beeston, and it was kept in good repair until the 16th century, when it was considered to be of no further military use, although it was pressed into service again in 1643, during the English Civil War. The castle was slighted (partly demolished) in 1646, in accordance with Cromwell&#x27;s destruction order, to prevent its further use as a bastion. During the 18th century, parts of the site were used as a quarry.

The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument owned and managed by English Heritage. The walls of the outer bailey and the gatehouse and curtain walls of the inner bailey are recorded separately in the National Heritage List for England as designated Grade I listed buildings. A legend states that the royal treasure of Richard II was buried in the castle grounds but many searches have failed to discover the hoard.

==Location==
The castle is built on Beeston Crag, which is in the southerly part of the Mid Cheshire Ridge, a chain of low sandstone hills that stretches from the River Mersey down to the central region of the Cheshire Plain. The low-lying area between the southerly and the northern ranges of the ridge is known as the Beeston Gap. It was formed by a meltwater channel at the end of the Ice age.

The crag, just like the neighbouring Peckforton Hills, is part of a thicker sequence known as the New Red Sandstone. It was formed from easterly dipping layers of Triassic sandstone. The lower slopes are formed from Wilmslow Sandstone Formation while the upper strata are part of the Helsby Sandstone Formation, which is around 245 million years old. The hillock is capped by a small outcrop of sandstones assigned to the Tarporley Siltstone Formation (and formerly known as the Keuper Waterstones). Both types of sandstones were once quarried at multiple sites within the castle grounds.

Along the eastern margin of the hill is the Peckforton Fault, a major north–south-aligned geological fault which downthrows the strata to the east. A low ridge of glacial moraine extending east from the castle lodge is interpreted as marking an ice front during the retreat (or stagnation in situ) of the Irish Sea ice sheet which had invaded Cheshire from the northwest during the last ice age.

==Prehistory==

Pits dating from the 4th millennium BC indicate that the site of Beeston Castle was inhabited or used as a communal gathering place during the Neolithic period. Archaeologists have discovered Neolithic flint arrow heads on the crag, as well as the remains of a Bronze Age community, and of an Iron Age hill fort. The rampart associated with the Bronze Age activity on the crag has been dated to around 1270–830 BC; seven circular buildings were identified as being either late Bronze Age or early Iron Age in origin. It may have been a specialist metalworking site.

==History==
===Construction===
Beeston was built for Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, in the early 13th century. The siting of the castle&#x27;s outer bailey walls was chosen to take advantage of the fortifications remaining from the earlier Iron Age rampart. In medieval documents the castle is described as &quot;Castellum de Rupe&quot;, the Castle on the Rock. It is one of three major castles built by Ranulph in the 1220s, shortly after his return from the Fifth Crusade. The others are Bolingbroke in Lincolnshire, and Chartley, Staffordshire, both of which share similar architectural features with Beeston; in particular the design of the towers.

Unlike many other castles of the period, Beeston does not have a keep as its last line of defence. Instead the natural features of the land, together with massive walls, strong gatehouses, and carefully positioned towers, made the baileys themselves the stronghold. The defences consisted of two parts. Firstly, a rectangular castle on the summit of the hill, with a sheer drop on three sides and a defensive ditch up to deep in places cut into the rock on the fourth side. Secondly, an outer bailey was built on the lower slopes, with a massive gatehouse protected by a wide and deep ditch.

The outer bailey was roughly rectangular, with thick walls faced in sandstone and infilled with rubble. The walls, parts of which still remain, contain a number of D-shaped towers, an innovation in English castles at that time. The towers allowed defenders to shoot across the walls as well as forwards, and their open-backed design meant that they would not offer cover to any attackers who gained access to the outer bailey. The inner bailey was on the rocky summit at the western end of the crag.

To provide the castle&#x27;s inhabitants with a supply of fresh water, two wells were dug into the rock; one of them, deep, is one of the deepest castle wells in England.

===Royal castle===

Although most of the defences were in place by the time of Ranulph&#x27;s death in 1232, there were no living quarters, and neither were there on the death of Ranulph&#x27;s successor John in 1237. John died without a male heir, allowing King Henry III to take over the Earldom of Cheshire. Henry enlarged Beeston Castle during his wars with Wales, and used it as a prison for his Welsh captives. No attempt was made to equip the castle as a permanent residence with halls and chambers; garrisons were probably housed in wooden structures within the outer bailey.

In 1254 Henry gave Beeston, together with other lands in Cheshire, to his son Prince Edward. He also gave the title Earl of Chester to the prince, a title that has been conferred on the heir to the throne of England ever since. During the Montfortian rebellion, in 1265, the castle was retaken from the Monfortians by James de Audley and Urian de Saint Pierre, following Edward&#x27;s escape from captivity. The County Palatine had been briefly claimed by Simon de Montfort in January 1265. Edward succeeded Henry as King of England in 1272, and completed the conquest of Wales.

In the middle of the 14th century there are references to men of Cheshire who were made constables of the royal castle. The constable would probably have lived in or near the gatehouse. The habitation was described in an account of the castle in 1593 by Sampson Erdeswicke, which describes, &quot;a goodly strong gatehouse, and strong wall with other buildings, which when they flourished were a convenient habitation for any great personage.&quot;

Beeston was kept in good repair and improved during Edward&#x27;s reign, and throughout the 14th century. However, by the 16th century the castle was considered to be of no further use to the English Crown, and in 1602 it was sold to Sir Hugh Beeston (c. 1547–1626) of Beeston Hall.

There have been persistent rumours of a treasure hidden by Richard II somewhere in the castle grounds. Richard is supposed to have hidden part of his personal wealth at Beeston on his journey to Chester in 1399, before boarding a ship to Ireland to suppress a rebellion there. On his return, Richard was deposed by Henry, Duke of Lancaster, the future Henry IV, and his treasure is said to have remained undiscovered. Many searches have been carried out, most of them focusing on the deep well in the inner bailey, but nothing has ever been found. The rumour of hidden treasure may not be well founded, as Henry IV is recorded as having &quot;recovered Richard&#x27;s gold and jewellery from its various hiding places&quot;.

== Civil War==
During the English Civil War many neglected castles were pressed into service. Beeston was seized on 20 February 1643 by Parliamentary forces commanded by Sir
William Brereton. The walls were repaired and the motte was cleaned out. During 1643 part of the royal army of Ireland landed at Chester. On 13 December 1643 Captain Thomas Sandford and eight soldiers from that army crept into Beeston at night (possibly aided by treachery) and surprised the castle governor, Captain Thomas Steele, who was so shaken by the event that he surrendered on the promise that he would be allowed to march out of the castle with honours. Steele was tried and shot for his failure to hold the castle.

The Royalists survived a siege by parliamentary forces from November 1644 until November 1645, when their lack of food forced them to surrender. The castle was partially demolished in 1646, to prevent its further use as a stronghold.

==Later history==

In the late 17th century, Sir Thomas Grosvenor, 3rd Baronet, commissioned William Samwell to build Eaton Hall. It was arranged to draw attention of people at the hall to the ruins of Beeston Castle. Quarrying was carried out in the castle grounds during the 18th century, and the gatehouse leading into the outer bailey was demolished to build a track for the stones to be removed from the site.

In 1840 the castle was purchased by John Tollemache, 1st Baron Tollemache, at that time the largest landowner in Cheshire, as part of a larger estate. In the mid-19th century the castle was the site of an annual two-day fete, raising money for local widows and orphans and attracting more than 3,000 visitors a day.

==Preservation==
The castle is owned by English Heritage and, although in ruins, enough of the walls and towers are still in place to provide a clear picture of how it would have looked in its prime. It is open to visitors and has a small museum and visitor&#x27;s centre. A lodge house was built by Tollemache in the 19th century, and was expanded in the 20th century. The lodge is two storeys high, with two circular towers either side of a central archway. It is designated as a Grade II listed building.

The views from Beeston stretch across eight counties from the Pennines in the east to the Welsh mountains in the west.

<text>Michael Marshall Dokes (August 10, 1958 – August 11, 2012) was an American professional boxer who competed from 1976 to 1997, and held the WBA heavyweight title from 1982 to 1983. As an amateur he won a silver medal in the heavyweight division at the 1975 Pan American Games.

==Amateur career==
Dokes won a silver medal at the 1975 Pan American Games. He lost a 5–0 decision to Teófilo Stevenson in the finals. He also lost a close decision to John Tate in the Olympic trials in 1976, after which he turned professional.

===Amateur accomplishments===
*1975 National AAU Heavyweight Champion
*1976 National Golden Gloves Heavyweight Champion, beating future pro champs John Tate and Greg Page en route.
*As an underage 15-year-old, made it to the finals of both the 1974 National Golden Gloves and the National AAU tournaments. He lost to Leon Spinks in AAU final, and future Mike Tyson trainer Bobby Stewart in the Golden Gloves final.
*Won 1974 North American championships.
*Beat Marvin Stinson, who won the 1976 National AAU Heavyweight Championship.

==Professional career==
Dokes turned professional in 1976. He received national exposure in a televised exhibition with Muhammad Ali in 1977, which saw Ali clown and mug while slipping Dokes&#x27;s punches, but also revealed glimpses of Dokes&#x27;s potential. He came to real prominence in 1979 by defeating veteran contender Jimmy Young. His career faltered slightly after fighting to a draw with Ossie Ocasio, but Dokes returned to knock out Ocasio in one round soon thereafter. By early 1982, after a first-round knockout of Lynn Ball to win the NABF title, Dokes was in line for a title shot. He was ranked #2 by the WBC and #3 by the WBA. Dokes became WBA heavyweight champion in 1982 by knocking out Mike Weaver in the first round in a match held weeks after the Ray Mancini-Duk Koo Kim lightweight title fight that ended in Kim&#x27;s death. Because of Nevada State Athletic Commission instructions to referee Joey Curtis regarding the stoppage of the fight in light of the incident, some felt it was premature. In the rematch, Dokes retained his title on a majority draw (tie).

Dokes&#x27;s reign as the WBA title holder was short-lived. He lost his title by a tenth-round knockout to Gerrie Coetzee. He was later knocked out by future champion Evander Holyfield.

Dokes was knocked out by Donovan Ruddock in 1990. In 1993, Dokes faced newly crowned heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe in his first title defense since defeating Evander Holyfield. Bowe won by TKO in the first round. Although Dokes and his team protested that the fight was stopped prematurely, it was obvious that Dokes was in no condition to continue after taking a vicious barrage of punches from the heavy-hitting Bowe. After a nearly three-year hiatus, Dokes returned to the ring winning three of five matches over a two-year period before retiring for good in 1997.

==Life after boxing==
In 1999 Dokes was sentenced to between four and 15 years in prison after being convicted of an attack on his fiancée in August 1998. Late in 2008, Dokes was released on parole. Dokes died of liver cancer at a hospice in Akron in August 2012, a day after his 54th birthday.

<text>Kenneth Lewis Anderson (September 11, 1805 – July 3, 1845) was a lawyer, the fourth and last vice president of the Republic of Texas, 1844 to 1845.

Anderson was born in Hillsborough, North Carolina, where he worked as a shoemaker at an early age. By 1824 he was living in Bedford County, Tennessee, where he became deputy sheriff in 1826 and sheriff in 1830; he was a colonel in the militia by 1832.

In 1837, he and his family moved to San Augustine, Texas, where his wife&#x27;s brother-in-law Joseph Rowe had lived for five years. In 1838 Anderson served successively as deputy sheriff and sheriff. It was probably after he arrived in Texas that he studied to become a lawyer. President of Texas Mirabeau B. Lamar appointed him collector of customs for the district of San Augustine, and he was confirmed on November 21, 1839. He served as collector until he became a candidate from San Augustine County for the Texas House of Representatives of the Sixth Congress in 1841; he won with the largest majority in San Augustine County&#x27;s history at that time.

As a partisan of Sam Houston, Anderson was elected Speaker of the House on November 1, 1841. He immediately led an unsuccessful attempt to impeach President Lamar and Vice President David G. Burnet. Anderson had for a time been considered for secretary of the treasury of the republic, a post that went to William Henry Daingerfield. In 1842 he helped convince President Houston to veto the popular but dangerous war bill, which sought to force an invasion of Mexico.

After one term, and despite Houston&#x27;s pleas, Anderson retired later in 1842 to practice law in San Augustine with Royall T. Wheeler; he eventually formed a partnership with J. Pinckney Henderson and Thomas Jefferson Rusk. In December, Anderson became district attorney of the Fifth Judicial District. In 1844, Anderson was frequently mentioned as a candidate for president of the republic, but eventually he became the candidate for vice president, on a ticket headed by Anson Jones. Anderson&#x27;s opponent, Patrick Jack, died before the election, and Anderson won nearly unanimously. He presided over the Senate at Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas in June 1845, when the Texas Congress approved the Texas Annexation by the United States.

After the annexation vote, he immediately left for home despite being sick. After only twenty miles, at the Fanthorp Inn in modern-day Anderson, Texas, his fever flared and he died in office at age 39. The Vice President had been considered the leading candidate to become the first governor of Texas. His law partner, Pinckney Henderson, was instead elected governor in December.

Both Anderson County and the town of Anderson in Texas are named after him.

<doc id="867336" wikidata="Q5467944" url="?curid=867336" title="Ford Taunus V4 engine">
<text>The Ford Taunus V4 engine is a 60° V4 piston engine with one balance shaft, introduced by Ford Motor Company in Germany in 1962. The German V4 was built in the Cologne plant and powered the Ford Taunus and German versions of the Consul, Capri, and Transit.

==Design==

In common with other V4 and V6 engines, but unlike longer V engines with more cylinders, the connecting rods do not share a crankpin on the crankshaft.

The V4 was later expanded into the Ford Cologne V6 engine that was used in the Ford Capri, Ford Taunus, Ford Cortina, Ford Consul, Ford Granada, Ford Sierra, Ford Scorpio, Ford Ranger, Ford Explorer, Ford Mustang, Mercury Capri, and many other cars. The V4 engine was also used in industrial applications: pumps, electrical generators, agricultural machinery and snowcats. In automobiles, the Taunus V4 was replaced by the Ford OHC/Pinto engine.

Initially the V4 engine was designed by Ford for a new entry compact car intended for the US market to be called the Ford &quot;Cardinal&quot;, which eventually evolved into the Taunus 12m P4. Ford abandoned the &quot;Cardinal&quot; project and instead built the Ford Falcon for North America. Ford then sought other uses for the V4 engine which was initially tested in the Saab 96. Ford bought several Saab 96s for testing and eventually sold the cars back to Saab with the V4 engines in them. Saab tested the V4s at their Trollhättan test track which stimulated Saab to acquire the V4 engine for their 95, 96, and 97 (Sonett) introduced in August 1966 (1967 production model). The V4 engine eliminated the need to mix oil with fuel for the two-cycle Saab &quot;Shrike&quot; engine and provided better low end torque. Saab dealers offered the first owner a &quot;Lifetime Warranty&quot; for the V4 for US$50.

Some DKW Munga, a Jeep-like vehicle used by the German army, were retrofitted with the Taunus V4 to replace its original two-stroke engine.

Since the Saab 96 was used for rallying it was also tuned. In the rally versions it was bored and stroked to giving around in the naturally aspirated version and DIN at 7000 rpm in the Saab 96 RC Turbo version, doing 0 to in five seconds. SAAB also tuned the engine to .

<text>Coach House Books is an independent book publishing company located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Coach House publishes experimental poetry, fiction, drama and non-fiction. The press is particularly interested in writing that pushes at the boundaries of convention.

==History==

The company was founded as Coach House Press in 1965 by artist Stan Bevington. It is known for publishing early works by writers such as Fred Wah, Daphne Marlatt, Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje, Ann-Marie MacDonald, George Bowering, Nicole Brossard, Gwendolyn MacEwen, Christopher Dewdney, bpNichol and Anne Michaels, Darren O&#x27;Donnell, Sean Dixon, Greg MacArthur, Matthew Heiti, and Amiel Gladstone.

Coach House was at the centre of a number of innovations in the use of digital technology in publishing and printing, from computerized phototypesetting to desktop publishing. Notably, the pioneering SGML/XML company, SoftQuad, was founded by Coach House&#x27;s Stan Bevington and colleagues Yuri Rubinsky and David Slocombe.

In 1991, Coach House was split into two separate companies: the printing house Coach House Printing, headed by Bevington, and the book publisher Coach House Press, headed by Margaret McClintock. Bevington subsequently tried, unsuccessfully, to reacquire the publishing company. Ultimately, the book publisher declared bankruptcy in 1996, and later the same year Bevington moved the printing company back into book publishing.

The company is located in several former coach houses on bpNichol Lane, near Spadina and Bloor, which were rented from Campus Co-operative Residence Incorporated. In 2004, controversy arose when the media reported that the cooperative would be demolishing the coach house buildings, and politicians and public interest groups campaigned to have the buildings declared a heritage site. In 2009, the company directly acquired the buildings for the first time in its history.

==Operations==

Coach House is one of the few Canadian publishing companies that prints its own titles; the printing operations also print books for several other small Canadian publishers and literary magazines, including &quot;Acta Victoriana&quot; and the &quot;Hart House Review&quot;.

The reputation of the new Coach House has been growing steadily since its rebirth in 1997, but it skyrocketed with the publication of Christian Bök&#x27;s &quot;Eunoia&quot;. This work of experimental poetry won the Canadian Griffin Poetry Prize in 2002 and has sold over 19,000 copies. Coach House books have been the recipients of dozens of other awards and nominations, including the Governor General&#x27;s Award, the City of Toronto Book Award, the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize, the Lambda Literary Award, the Books in Canada/Amazon.ca First Novel Award and the Trillium Book Award.

Its most recent successes have been a series of books of collected essays by Toronto writers on various aspects of their city. The first, &quot;uTOpia&quot; (2005), about various writers&#x27; notions of a perfectible Toronto, was a surprise hit and was followed by &quot;The State of the Arts&quot; (2006), &quot;GreenTOpia&quot; (2007) and &quot;HtO&quot; (2008) about water in the city. Frequent contributors to the volumes include John Lorinc, Shawn Micallef, Derek McCormack, Dylan Reid, Bert Archer, Stéphanie Verge, Chris Hardwicke, Mark Fram, Liz Forsberg, Dale Duncan and Darren O&#x27;Donnell. Also recently published in 2020 was &quot;Watch Your Head: Writers and Artists Respond to the Climate Crisis,&quot; edited by Kathryn Mockler, among others. 

In 2008, Coach House was awarded the Province of Ontario&#x27;s &quot;Arts Organization Award&quot; as part of the &quot;Premier&#x27;s Award for Excellence in the Arts&quot;.

<doc id="867341" wikidata="Q4184870" url="?curid=867341" title="Investment Company Act of 1940">
<text>The Investment Company Act of 1940 (commonly referred to as the &#x27;40 Act) is an act of Congress which regulates investment funds. It was passed as a United States Public Law () on August 22, 1940, and is codified at . Along with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and extensive rules issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; it is central to financial regulation in the United States. It has been updated by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. It is the primary source of regulation for mutual funds and closed-end funds, now a multi-trillion dollar investment industry. The 1940 Act also impacts the operations of hedge funds, private equity funds and even holding companies.

==History==
Following the founding of the mutual fund in 1924, investors invested in this new investment vehicle heavily. Five and a half years later, the Wall Street crash of 1929 occurred in the stock market, followed shortly thereafter by the United States entry into the Great Depression. In response to this crisis, the United States Congress wrote into law the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

In 1935, Congress requested that the SEC report on the industry, and the Investment Trust Study was reported between 1938 and 1940. The law as originally introduced was different from the law which passed; the original draft granted more broad power to the SEC, while the final bill was a compromise between the SEC and industry which was drafted and submitted to Congress by joint members of the SEC and industry, and Congress ultimately passed a similar version, unanimously. David Schenker, who became the head of the Investment Company Division at the SEC, was one of the original drafters.

By 1992, the act had remained largely unchanged aside from amendments in 1970 to provide additional protections particularly around independent boards and limiting fees and expenses.

==Scope==
The act&#x27;s purpose, as stated in the bill, is &quot;to mitigate and ... eliminate the conditions ... which adversely affect the national public interest and the interest of investors&quot;. Specifically, the act regulated conflicts of interest in investment companies and securities exchanges. It seeks to protect the public primarily by legally requiring disclosure of material details about each investment company. The act also places some restrictions on certain mutual fund activities such as short selling shares. However, the act did not create provisions for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to make specific judgments about or even supervise an investment company&#x27;s actual investment decisions. The act requires investment companies to publicly disclose information about their own financial health.

==Jurisdiction==
The Investment Company Act applies to all investment companies, but exempts several types of investment companies from the act&#x27;s coverage. The most common exemptions are found in Sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of the act and include hedge funds.

In October 2021, over 60 law firms issued an &quot;extremely unusual joint statement&quot; that special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) are subject to regulation under the Act when the SPAC does not acquire an operational business within one year of offering company shares to the public. The statement followed opposition from Yale law professor John Morley and New York University law professor Robert Jackson regarding the dismissal of a lawsuit against the blank-check company GO Acquisition Corp. that had been filed on behalf of an investor.

===Scale===
When Congress wrote the act into federal law, rather than leaving the matter up to the individual states, it justified its action by including in the text of the bill its rationale for enacting the law:

The activities of such companies, extending over many states, their use of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce and the wide geographic distribution of their security holders, make difficult, if not impossible, effective state regulation of such companies in the interest of investors.

===Type===
The act divides the types of investment company to be regulated into three classifications:

*Face-amount certificate company: an investment company in the business of issuing face-amount certificates of the installment type.
*Unit investment trust: an investment company which is organized under a trust indenture, contract of custodianship or agency, or similar instrument, does not have a board of directors, and issues only redeemable securities, each of which represents an undivided interest in a unit of specified securities; but does not include a voting trust.
*Management company: any investment company other than a face-amount certificate company or a unit investment trust. The most well-known type of management company is the mutual fund.

== Summary of notable provisions ==
Sections 1 – 5 define terms and classify investment companies. The definition of investment company also includes some exemptions.

In addition to exemptions in the definitions, section 6 describes additional exemptions, with 6(c) notably giving the SEC broad discretion to &quot;conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person ... from any provision&quot;. One of the original drafters, David Schenker (who became the head of the Investment Company Division at the SEC), explained the provision in 1940 by pointing to the complexities of the industry. This was notably used to exempt venture capital firms in the 1970s, which preceded changes to the statute, ultimately including a section 3(c)(7) which exempts issuers of non-public securities to qualified purchasers. Section 3(c)(11) generally exempts collective trust funds.

Section 7 prohibits investment companies from doing business until registration, including public offerings; in 2018, the SEC acted against a cryptocurrency hedge fund for allegedly violating section 7. Section 7(d) is notable in that it restricts foreign investment firms from offering securities, and by 1992 no foreign firms had registered since 1973.

Section 9 outlines disqualification provisions which restrict people who have committed misconduct from practice in the industry; in practice, the SEC has historically granted waivers to allow such persons to remain involved.

Various provisions restrict the powers of investment companies in corporate governance over management particularly in transactions with affiliates, including section 10. These laws were passed as a reaction to self-dealing excesses in the 1920s and 1930s, where funds would, for example, dump worthless stocks into certain funds, saddling investors with their losses.

== Filings ==
To register, a firm initially files a notification with Form N-8A, followed by a form which depends on the type of fund.

Among others, firms with open-end funds must file Form 24F-2.

<doc id="867355" wikidata="Q39133" url="?curid=867355" title="Tornjak">
<text>The Tornjak (), also known as the Bosnian-Herzegovinian sheepdog, is a recreated breed of livestock guardian dog native to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. They are molosser-type mountain dogs, similar to other livestock guardian breeds of the region, the Šarplaninac, Bucovina Shepherd Dog, and the Greek Shepherd.

==History==
The earliest written reference to the breed dates back to the 11th century. Descriptions of the Tornjak are present in the writings of Peter Horvat, Bishop of Đakovo, in 1374, and Peter Lukić, Canon of the Đakovo diocese, in 1752. The dogs are described as guarding dogs, intelligent and bred to limit aggression. They were the transhumance shepherd dog of Vlachs in medieval Bosnia. 

Prevalence of the Tornjak gradually declined with the end of nomadic sheep herding in the region. In the early 1970s, a group of cynologists began a project to identify and breed dogs sharing similar characteristics to those found in historic writings about the breed. Pure blood breeding began in 1978 and the foundation stock of the modern breed is genetically homogeneous landrace shepherding dogs identified through this process. 

Tornjaks were first imported to the UK in 2013 with intentions of working towards UK Kennel Club Recognition.

== Name ==
Numerous names are used to describe dogs from this region sharing similar characteristics and fulfilling a similar role. 

The FCI standard name, Tornjak, is derived from the word , meaning sheep pen. The breed is called &quot;Toraši&quot; in Sinj and the Kamešnica mountain, and the shepherds of the Dinara mountains call the breed &quot;Dinarci&quot;. &quot;Bosanski Ovčar Tornjak&quot;, meaning Bosnian Shepherd Dog and &quot;Hrvatski pas planinac&quot;, meaning Croatian mountain dog, are also used.

== Characteristics ==
=== Appearance ===
The Tornjaks are large dogs, with somewhat square-bodied features and relatively agile movements. Despite this, their bones are not lightweight. The Tornjak is a long-coated breed with short hair over the face and legs. The hair is distinctively long and abundant over the neck (mane), and on the back of the upper thighs (breeches). The tail is notably feathered and carried like a flag while the dog moves. The coat is very dense and cannot be parted.

As a rule, the Tornjaks are particolored, with white being the dominant ground color. White markings are most commonly found around the neck, over the head, and along the legs. The patches can be any color. Similar to other livestock guardian dogs, the distinct markings served a utilitarian purpose, helping shepherds distinguish their dogs from both sheep and wolves.

;Temperament

Tornjaks have a calm temperament. A typical adult Tornjak is a calm, peaceful, and seemingly indifferent animal, but when the situation demands, it is a vigilant and alert watchdog. The character is equal to the temperament; they are not nervous nor aggressive. In general, they are very tough, sturdy, and not overly demanding dogs. With their human family, they can be very affectionate. When living in a pack they are highly social animals, without fighting between the pack members. Towards strangers or other animals, as a rule, Tornjaks are not overly aggressive. But when the situation calls upon it, Tornjaks are quite decisive, and they can attack even stronger rivals without consideration. Shepherds used to say that a Tornjak that guards the flock is a fair match to two wolves and that a couple of Tornjaks will confront and chase away a bear. In these situations, Tornjaks can be very tenacious.

==Activities==
A Tornjak&#x27;s exercise levels are usually not demanding, especially in the first 9–12 months (during the last intensive growth period). They prefer long walks without a leash and a lot of playing with other dogs. They will also be just as satisfied with only a 20-minute walk if their owner is in a hurry. Tornjaks learn quickly and do not forget easily; they happily perform tasks and are therefore easy to train. Strong and hardy, these dogs lie on the ground during the snowy winter nights and often get covered with snow without freezing due to their thick coats. They are primarily used for herding and protection of livestock.

==Care==
The Tornjak is not suited for apartment life. They need lots of space and will do best with at least a large yard. Because its thick coat protects it so well, it can cope well with living outdoors provided it has proper shelter. This breed is best suited to a family with space surrounding the home where it can attend to its own exercise needs.

Climbing up and down stairs the first six months can ruin hock joints or lead to hip dysplasia.

Tornjaks need early socialization. Early experiences (before 9 months of age) have a very significant effect throughout the dog&#x27;s life. They need to be confronted with potentially frightening stimuli as early as possible to avoid later fear reactions. Traffic noise, big trucks, and buses will provoke fear reactions in adulthood if the Tornjak has not previously faced these situations as a puppy. At this early age, all Tornjak puppies have to meet as many unknown people as possible, and also other animals, dogs, and pets especially, to develop good and stable social behavior as an adult.

==Ban==
This breed is banned in Denmark.

<doc id="867365" wikidata="Q1436723" url="?curid=867365" title="Ford E-Series">
<text>The Ford E-Series (also known as the Ford Econoline, Ford Econovan or Ford Club Wagon) is a range of full-size vans manufactured and marketed by the Ford Motor Company. Introduced for 1961 as the replacement of the Ford F-Series panel van, four generations of the model line have been produced. Marketed for both cargo and passenger transport configurations, the E-Series has been designed with multiple design variations for both retail and commercial sale, including vans, and commercial-grade cutaway van chassis and stripped chassis (a chassis without bodywork).

With over 8.2 million units sold since 1961, the Ford E-Series is the third-best selling van line in history (outranked only by the Ford Transit and Volkswagen Transporter). Ford retired the E-Series passenger and cargo vans after 2014, replacing them with the Ford Transit. As of current production, the E-Series remains offered exclusively in cutaway and stripped-chassis configurations. In 2021, the model line entered its 60th year of production (becoming the second current Ford line to do so). 

The E-Series (cutaway/stripped chassis) is assembled by Ford at its Ohio Assembly facility (Avon Lake, Ohio), which has produced the model line since 1975. Prior to its closure, Lorain Assembly (Lorain, Ohio) assembled the model line from 1961 to 2005.

== First generation (1961–1967) ==
Ford released the first-generation Ford Econoline on September 21, 1960, for the 1961 model year. Beginning development in 1957, the model line served as a replacement for the Ford F-Series panel delivery (and the smaller Ford Courier sedan delivery). Three models were available, a cargo van, a passenger van (also sold under the Station Bus and Club Wagon names), and a forward-control pickup truck.

Competing directly against the rear-engined Chevrolet Corvair van and Volkswagen Transporter, the Ford Econoline established multiple design precedents adopted by successive North American vans, including the Chevrolet Van and Dodge A100. While also a forward-control vehicle, Ford introduced a midengined configuration. To improve cargo access by creating a flat load floor and enlarging the rear doors, the engine was placed between the front seats.

=== Chassis ===
The first-generation Ford Econoline was based on the Ford Falcon compact car range. To accommodate its 90-inch wheelbase (the shortest for a Ford since 1908), the Econoline adopted a midengined configuration, placing the engine behind the front axle; consequently, the layout precluded the use of a V8 engine.

The Econoline was initially powered by the 144-cubic-inch inline-six (the standard engine of the Falcon); a 170-cubic-inch inline-six was introduced as an option. For 1965, the 170 six became standard, with a 240 cubic-inch six introduced as an option. A three-speed manual was standard, with a Dagenham four-speed manual introduced for 1963 and discontinued in 1964; the 170-cubic-inch engine was offered with a three-speed automatic in 1964, and the larger two engines were both offered with a three-speed automatic as an option thereafter.

In contrast to the Falcon, the Econoline was fitted with a solid front axle and a solid rear axle suspension with leaf springs for all four wheels.

=== Body ===
In its body design, the Ford Econoline adapted several elements of the Volkswagen Type 2, while making major departures with other design features to accommodate its mid-engined layout. In line with Volkswagen, the Econoline positioned the front seats above the front axle, making it a cabover-style configuration (similar to the Jeep Forward Control). The grille placed below the headlights was a design feature borrowed loosely from the Ford Thames 400E (a predecessor of the Ford Transit).

The midengined placement enlarged the cargo area, as the engine compartment was located forward of the flat load floor. While Volkswagen marketed rear-engined vans in the United States until 1991, Chevrolet/GMC and Dodge both adopted the design of the Econoline, introducing midengined vans for the 1964 model year.

Through its production, the first-generation Ford Econoline was offered in several variants. Alongside the standard six-door cargo van, an eight-door version (adding two doors on the driver side) was added for 1963. For 1964, a panel van was introduced, deleting side loading doors altogether. For 1965, a &quot;Super Van&quot; extended-length body was introduced, extending the body 18 inches behind the rear axle. Econoline cargo vans (except panel vans) were offered with or without side windows in several configurations.

Alongside the Ford Falcon, the Ford Econoline was expanded into a product line including several vehicles. In Canada, the Econoline was marketed through both the sales networks of both Ford and Lincoln-Mercury (as a Mercury), to increase its presence outside of urban areas.
==== Passenger van ====
Introduced alongside the cargo van in 1961, Ford introduced two passenger variants of the Econoline (branded as part of the Falcon range). Alongside the Station Bus (branded as both a Falcon and Econoline), Ford marketed the Club Wagon. While the Station Bus was largely intended for commercial/fleet use, the Club Wagon was marketed as an alternative to station wagons. A five-seat configuration was standard, with an eight-seat configuration offered as an option.

==== Pickup truck ====

Introduced as a bodystyle for 1961, the Ford Econoline pickup truck derived its body from the cargo van. Similar in configuration to the Chevrolet Corvair pickup, the Econoline pickup bed had no engine intrusion related to the engine compartment. While far shorter than the similar-GVWR F-100, the Econoline pickup was designed with a 7-foot-long pickup bed (sized between the two F-Series offerings). Two versions of the cab were offered, a standard &quot;three-window&quot; cab and an optional &quot;five-window,&quot; which added wraparound windows to the cab corners.

The introduction of the 240-cubic-inch engine for 1965 necessitated a larger engine compartment, intruding slightly into the cargo bed (to provide clearance for the transmission bellhousing). The same year, a &quot;Spring Special&quot; package was offered as a trim option.

At the time of its launch, Ford projected the Econoline pickup truck to outsell the van, but buyers reversed the trend, with the van outselling the pickup truck nine-to-one. The bodystyle ended production after the 1967 model year, remaining unique to the first generation.

====Mercury Econoline====

The first-generation Econoline was sold by Ford of Canada by both Ford and Lincoln-Mercury. When branding its truck offerings under the Mercury brand, Ford of Canada maximized its presence in rural area serviced by either Ford or Lincoln-Mercury (but not both). As with the Mercury M-series trucks, the Mercury Econoline was largely identical to its Ford namesake (differing primarily in badging); the model was marketed in Canada as a cargo and passenger van and a pickup truck.

For 1961, Ford of Canada began production Mercury-brand Econolines at Oakville Assembly in Ontario; later that year, Mercury Econoline pickup was shifted to Lorain Assembly in Ohio. For 1962, production of the entire model line returned to Oakville. After 1965, production of the model line was sourced from the United States.

Production numbers of Mercury Econolines were low, with only 1,291 Mercury Econoline pickup trucks being built in 1965. Following the 1968 model year, Ford of Canada ended the sale of Mercury-branded trucks, leaving the Mercury Econoline as the last Mercury-branded van until the 1993 Mercury Villager minivan.

==Second generation (1968–1974)==

Following a lengthy United Auto Workers strike in 1967, the launch of the second-generation Econoline van was delayed almost four months, until January 1968. Instead of marketing the van as a 1968 or 1968-1/2 model, Ford marketed it for model year 1969. Losing its Falcon roots, the second-generation Econoline became a heavier-duty vehicle, sharing many of its underpinnings with the F-Series full-sized pickups.

=== Chassis ===
The unibody construction of the previous generation was carried over, and the mid-engine, forward-control layout gave way to a front-engine layout with a forward axle placement; this allowed use of the &quot;Twin-I-Beam&quot; front suspension from the F-Series trucks. The wheelbase increased , while the longer long-wheelbase model became the largest full-sized van offered in North America at the time.

Following Dodge and Chevrolet/GMC, a V8 engine became optional.

=== Body ===
With the change of chassis and axle configurations, the Econoline gained a conventional hood for engine access, though engine access remained largely from the van&#x27;s interior. The redesign provided a conventional grille, styled similarly to the F-Series.

For 1971, the grille was redesigned to match the updated F-Series. For 1972, a sliding rear door became an option; introduced on a cutaway van chassis was the Hi-Cube van, a cab-chassis version of the Econoline with a box-van body. The introduction of the cab-chassis variant became popular in the recreational-vehicle industry (a Class C RV), a segment still dominated by the E-Series in the 2010s.

=== Interior ===
Inside of the Econoline, the shift of the engine location moved the engine housing from between the seats to in front of the driver and front passenger, under the windshield. While the Econoline cargo van remained, it was joined by an Econoline passenger van (replacing the Falcon van). To attract more buyers to passenger vans, Ford introduced two new trims of the passenger van, the Ford Club Wagon and Ford Club Wagon Chateau. Based on the long-wheelbase version, the Chateau had air conditioning, houndstooth fabric on all seats, an AM/FM sound system, and the option of 12-passenger seating.

==Third generation (1975–1991)==
For 1975, the Econoline/Club Wagon were given a complete redesign. Based on an all-new chassis, Ford became the first American manufacturer to adapt body-on-frame construction to a full-size van.

The new-generation Econoline would become common not only in its own right, but as the basis for other vehicles. With a full frame, the Econoline became popular as a cutaway van chassis; the design served as a basis for many ambulances, and various types of trucks and buses. The shared drivetrain with the F-Series marked the beginning of aftermarket four-wheel drive conversions. During the 1970s, the Econoline became popular as a basis for van conversions. Using the sparsely-equipped Econoline cargo van as a basis, a luxurious interior was fitted, along with extensive customization of the exterior.

The 1978 Ford Econoline was MotorTrend&#x27;s first-ever Truck of the Year.

=== Chassis ===

To increase the versatility of the full-size van line, the Econoline was developed using body-on-frame construction for the first time. In addition to increasing the strength of the chassis, the configuration allowed more commonality with the F-Series trucks. As before, the Twin-I-Beam front suspension was used. In its new configuration, the engine was moved further forward and lowered relative to the body. The van grew in size: the short-wheelbase configuration was a half inch longer than the previous long-wheelbase chassis; the new long-wheelbase chassis was , the longest wheelbase full-size van sold until 1990. After the 1984 model year, the 124-inch wheelbase Club Wagon passenger van was discontinued, and the 124-inch wheelbase Econoline Cargo Van was discontinued after the 1990 model year, leaving the 138-inch wheelbase as the sole option.

In 1983, to increase the fuel economy of the Econoline without a major loss in engine output, Ford introduced the option of a 6.9L IDI diesel V8 produced by International Harvester; in 1988, this was enlarged to 7.3L. The diesel V8 engines were available only in Econoline 350s (or Club Wagons sold on the same chassis). The cutaway version was available with the 4.9L 6-cylinder or the larger (5.8L and up) V8s.

Due to the popularity of automatic transmissions in full-size vans, Ford discontinued all manual transmissions after the 1989 model year. The column-shifted 3-speed departed after 1986, leaving the floor-shifted 4-speed overdrive manual as standard. The four-speed was replaced by a Mazda-sourced 5-speed M5OD for 1988.

=== Body ===
Unlike its predecessors, Ford designed the 1975 Econoline with a &quot;two-box&quot; layout. Similar to the Ford Transit of the time, the configuration moved the engine as far forward as possible and lower in the chassis than in its predecessor; although the hood was nearly twice as long, the hoodline was much lower. A higher degree of parts commonality with the F-Series made itself known in the body styling: the vent windows, taillights, bumpers, and wheels were common items between the two vehicles.

During its sixteen-year production run, the exterior of the Econoline/Club Wagon would remain nearly unaltered. In 1978, the Super Van/Super Wagon was introduced; based on the 138-inch wheelbase, it was a rear body extension allowing for extra cargo room or an extra row of seating (for up to 15 passengers). In 1979, a minor facelift updated the grille design; round headlights were replaced by rectangular units. In 1983, the Ford Blue Oval was added to the grille, replacing the &quot;FORD&quot; lettering on the hood. Specific to the 1984 model year was a standard grille finish of dark argent with bright surround for both the Econoline and Club Wagon; chrome remained an option and was included with the latter&#x27;s XLT trim. The grille was afterwards reverted to bright argent. Also for &#x27;84 did the Econoline&#x27;s payload grade (150/250/350) become incorporated into the fender lettering until all fender badging was eliminated for the 1991 model year. Club Wagon chassis variants were not denoted.

Although the 1986 Ford Aerostar minivan would introduce styling far different from the Econoline, the basic styling of the full-size van would heavily influence the Ford Ranger (and its SUV offspring, the Ford Bronco II).

=== Interior ===
Inside, the redesign of the chassis expanded interior room, though the rear of the engine still remained between the front seats; an engine cover still provided access for servicing. Sharing many controls with the F-Series, the new design also improved interior ergonomics. In three body sizes, the Econoline was produced in a cargo van and passenger van, with the latter produced in three trim levels: base, Custom and Chateau. In addition, the Club Wagon was produced solely as a passenger van. After 1980, this was replaced by the F-Series nomenclature of XL and XLT. In line with the F-Series, the Econoline/Club Wagon was sold in 100/150/250/350 variants, with the Econoline 100 discontinued in 1983.


== Fourth generation (1992–present) ==

For the 1992 model year, Ford introduced the fourth generation of the Econoline/Club Wagon. While the third-generation chassis was largely carried over, the body and interior underwent a complete redesign. The vehicle has received several revisions during its production, with the most recent taking place in 2021.

Toward the end of the 1990s, Ford began to phase out the use of the Econoline and Club Wagon nameplates. For 1999, the Club Wagon nameplate was discontinued and the Econoline was renamed the E-Series, a nomenclature closer to that of Ford&#x27;s full-size F-Series trucks.

In June 2014, production of E-Series passenger and cargo vans was discontinued as sales of the Ford Transit began in North America; at the time of its retirement, the model line had been the best-selling full-size van line in the United States since 1980.

From the 2015 model year onward, the E-Series has remained in production solely in cutaway and stripped chassis configurations.

=== Chassis specifications ===
The fourth-generation shares the VN platform of the third-generation Econoline, introduced in 1975. Sharing many components with F-Series trucks, the E-Series retained the &quot;Twin-I-Beam&quot; front suspension used by rear-wheel drive Ford trucks in North America from the 1960s to the early 1990s. The rear suspension was a live rear axle with rear leaf springs.

For the 2007 model year, all E-Series (including the E-150) had eight-lug wheels and GVWRs of over 8,500 pounds. For the 2008 model year, the chassis underwent its largest revisions of the fourth generation. In an effort to improve handling and safety, larger brakes, improved steering, and rollover stability control were added. The Twin-I-Beam layout was retained, making it the second to last Ford vehicle to use it.

==== Powertrain ====
At its 1992 launch, the fourth generation carried over its powertrain line from the third-generation model line (sharing it with the ninth-generation F-Series). A 4.9L inline-six was standard, with a 5.0L V8 (on E-150 only) and a 5.8L V8 offered as options. On 350-series vans, a 7.5L V8 and 7.3L Navistar diesel V8 were also optional; the diesel became turbocharged in 1993. For 1995, the IDI diesel was replaced by a 7.3L Ford Power Stroke diesel V8 (also sourced from Navistar).

For 1997, the E-Series underwent a revision of its engine lineup, retaining only the 7.3L diesel. Sharing its gasoline engines with the tenth-generation F-Series, a 4.2L V6 replaced the inline-6 and a 6.8L V10 replaced the 7.5L V8. The 5.0L V8 and the 5.8L V8 were replaced by 4.6L and 5.4L V8s, respectively. The 4.2L V6 was only available on 150- and 250-series vans, unlike its predecessor which could also be had on 350-series vans. For 2003, the 4.6L V8 became available on the E-250.

For 2004, the 7.3L diesel was replaced by a 6.0L diesel from Navistar. While gaining an intercooler over its predecessor, due to the lack of airflow in the engine compartment (compared to Super Duty trucks), Ford had to detune the E-Series version of the 6.0L V8. For 2004, the 4.2L V6 was dropped and the 4.6L V8 became the standard engine on the E-150 and E-250, making the E-Series the first American full-size van with a V8 engine standard.

The 6.0L Power Stroke was offered until 2009 in the Ford Econoline vans (model year 2010), even though Ford Super Duty trucks were upgraded to the 6.4L version in 2007. Diesels were no longer offered after the 2010 model year. For 2009, the 4.6L and 5.4L engines gained flexible-fuel capability (allowing them to use E85 fuel).

In May 2014, the final 4.6L V8 was produced for the E-Series, with the 5.4L V8 becoming the standard engine for 2015.

Starting with the 2017 model year, the 6.8L V10 replaced the 5.4L V8 as the standard engine, with a 6.2L V8 becoming the optional engine. Both engines have flex-fuel capability and both can be converted to use CNG or LPG (propane autogas).

Since the 2021 model year, the E-Series has only used the gasoline 7.3L V8 from the fourth-generation Super Duty truck, offered with an option for conversion to CNG or LPG.

=== Body ===

During its production, the body style of the fourth-generation E-Series underwent minor revisions in 1997 and 2003, with a major revision in 2008.

In line with the F-Series, the Econoline/E-Series was sold in 150, 250, and 350 series, denoting 1/2-, 3/4-, and 1-ton chassis (the Club Wagon was not designated by chassis size).

The body was available in two lengths, with the extended-length version exclusive to the 250 (3/4-ton) and 350-series (1-ton) chassis for both cargo and passenger vans (until 2009, when an extended-length E-150 cargo van became available). The cargo van was sold as a two-passenger vehicle, with the passenger van was sold in various configurations, accommodating up to 12 passengers on regular-length models or 15 passengers on extended-length models.

=== Trim ===
During its production, the fourth-generation model line underwent several name changes. As with the previous generation, the Econoline was sold as both a cargo van and as a passenger van (Econoline Wagon) with the Ford Club Wagon sold only as a passenger van. For 1992 the luxury-oriented Chateau trim line of the Club Wagon, dormant since 1989, made a return, slotted above the XLT trim. For 1992, the Club Wagon Chateau was awarded Truck of the Year by &quot;Motor Trend.&quot; For 2001, the Chateau was dropped, replaced by the E-150 Traveler; due to low sales, it was dropped after a single model year.

===Model history===
==== 1992–1997 ====

For the 1992 model year, Ford introduced the fourth-generation of the Econoline/Club Wagon. While the third-generation chassis was largely carried over, the body and interior underwent a complete redesign. In contrast to its GM and Dodge competitors, the two-box body configuration made a return. To optimize the aerodynamics of the van body, the hood was angled slightly downward and the windshield was raked back (though far less than the Aerostar). If specified, all side and rear window glass was flush-mounted to the body, along with wraparound tail lamp lenses; flush-mounted composite headlamps were an option (standard on all Club Wagons). For 1992, the Econoline/Club Wagon became the first full-size vans produced with a center-mounted brake light.

When redesigning the interior, the driver compartment underwent extensive modernization. While space between the front seats was again dominated by the front-mounted engine, a redesign of the engine cover freed up additional passenger room. Sharing controls and components with the F-Series and Aerostar, the model line became the first full-size van equipped with a standard driver-side airbag (except for 350-series models, exempted by their GVWR). The instrument panel received more legible instruments (but no tachometer); a 6-digit LCD odometer replaced the previous 5-digit analog unit.

For 1994, CFC-free R134a air-conditioning refrigerant was adopted beginning with September 1993 production. For 1995, the tail lamps were revised, removing the amber turn signals.

For the 1996 model year, Ford introduced a new Class 4 medium-duty variant of the Econoline, offered exclusively as either a cutaway van chassis or cab-chassis. Dubbed the E-Super Duty (in line with the F-Super Duty sold at the same time), this version was created using heavier-duty components than the existing Econoline 350 commercial models, such as a Dana 80 rear axle with higher 4.63 axle ratios, new parking brake assembly, and heavier-duty shocks to allow for a maximum GVWR of 16,000 lbs. It was offered with either the existing 7.3L diesel or 7.5L gasoline V8s, the latter eventually being replaced by the 6.8L Triton V10. It was sold in either a 158&quot; or 176&quot; wheelbase. Due to its shorter front nose and tighter turning circle compared to the equivalent F-Series model, the E-Super Duty was a popular choice for box truck and bus conversions.
==== 1997–2002 ====

For 1997, the Econoline underwent a revision of both its exterior and interior, largely to bring its appearance in line with other Ford trucks. The previous egg-crate grille was replaced by an eight-hole oval-shaped cutout (matching the Explorer and F-150). For 1999, the Econoline would be renamed to the E-Series, adopting a similar naming scheme to the F-Series line. This included the E-150, E-250, and E-350, with the E-Super Duty becoming the E-450.

The interior underwent a complete redesign, adopting an all-new dashboard. Following the adoption of dual airbags (for all versions), the &quot;brick&quot;-style steering wheel was replaced by one with a center-mounted horn. To improve the convenience of interior controls, rotary switches for climate controls were introduced, along with a double-DIN radio. The instrument panel was redesigned, reintroducing an analog odometer. The front seats underwent a redesign, relocating the seatbelt mounting to the B-pillars.
===== Ford E-550 Super Duty (2002–2003) =====

In September 2001, Ford announced it was working on a E-550 version of the E-Series for cutaway use. In 2002, Ford introduced the E-550 Super Duty as the highest-GVWR version of the E-Series with GVWRs up to 19,000 lbs. Offered solely in a cutaway-cab design, the E-550 was intended to bridge the gap between the pickup truck–derived F-450/550 Super Duty and the F-650 medium-duty trucks.

Sharing a number of chassis components with the F-550 Super Duty, the E-550 was distinguished by a grille styled in line with Super Duty pickup trucks (with a three horizontal slots between two vertical openings). To accommodate the wider, heavier-duty front axle, the van body was fitted with a larger front bumper and plastic fender flares (shared with the F-550 truck). Several wheelbases were offered, ranging between 159.5 inches and 233.5 inches; as with the Super Duty and the E-350/450, the E-550 was powered by either a 6.8L V10 or a 7.3L V8 turbodiesel.

Following the 2003 model year, Ford ended production of the E-550.
==== 2003–2007 ====

For 2003, the E-Series underwent an exterior update, adopting the grille introduced by the 2002 E-550 Super Duty. The new grille shifted the Ford Blue Oval emblem from the hood to the center of the grille (for the first time since 1991); based on trim, the grille was either dark gray or chrome. The front turn signal lenses were changed from clear to amber (their first change since 1992).

Coinciding with the exterior revision, the interior saw several updates. While the dashboard remained essentially unchanged, the engine cover was redesigned (including redesigned cup holders); the design now included a center-mounted glovebox (absent from the E-Series since 1974). For 2004, the instrument cluster was updated with a digital odometer; heavy-duty vans now offered a tachometer (as an option).
==== 2008–2014 ====

For 2008, the E-Series received a restyled front-end design similar to that of the newly-redesigned Ford Super Duty trucks. The interior design carried over.

For the 2009 model year, Ford introduced a new interior for the E-Series. The instrument panel was now larger and included an enhanced message center that could display warning messages, and other information, and the front interior door panels were redesigned with &quot;E SERIES&quot; branding embossed into the panels. Radios were also revised, with an auxiliary audio input jack being offered as standard equipment on all radios for the first time. The Ford Sync entertainment system, designed by Microsoft, and adding USB integration and hands-free Bluetooth calling and wireless audio streaming capabilities was now also offered as an option. Finally, an optional touchscreen GPS navigation system radio was also offered, and included HD Radio on select models.

Starting with the 2011 model year, the 6.0L Power Stroke turbo-diesel V8 engine was discontinued, and the E-Series was no longer offered with a diesel engine.
==== 2015–2020 ====

For the 2015 model year, Ford discontinued sales of the E-Series passenger and cargo vans, replacing them with the fourth-generation Ford Transit.

Because of its popularity with upfitters who convert the chassis into recreational vehicles, buses, or other specialized vehicles, Ford announced it would continue to offer the E-Series as a cutaway chassis (open cab, to be fitted with second-party rear body), a chassis cab (enclosed cab, to be fitted with second-party rear body), and a stripped chassis (no cab, to be fitted with a complete second-party body).

Ford said it made the change, because while the E-Series had remained the best-selling vehicle in the full-size van segment since 1980, the model line had seen little change since 1992 on a chassis introduced for the 1975 model year. At the time of its 2008 update, 95% of sales were to commercial or fleet users, with nearly half of production represented by cargo vans. Sold outside of North America since 1965, the Transit was introduced to the United States and Canada, offering increased fuel economy and additional body configurations over the E-Series.

Production of the base 4.6L V8 Ford Modular engine was discontinued after the 2014 model year (at the time, the E-Series was the only Ford product to use that engine). For the 2015 and 2016 model years, the only engine options were the 5.4L V8 or 6.8L V10 Modular engines. Starting in 2017, Ford began offering the 6.2L V8 Boss engine as a replacement for the 5.4L V8 engine.

The chassis-cab configuration was eliminated starting with the 2019 model year. Ford did not produce the E-Series for the 2020 model year.
==== 2021–present ====
For the 2021 model year, the E-Series interior underwent a redesign, adopting a more modern electronic instrument cluster with steering wheel controls first developed for the fourth-generation Super Duty truck. Under the hood, all models use the larger 7.3L V8 Godzilla naturally aspirated gasoline engine also used on the fourth-generation Super Duty truck. However, the exterior design remains unchanged from the 2008 redesign.

The instrument cluster has a monochromatic screen with an available upgrade to an color screen. The new instrument panel also allowed for the addition of new optional safety equipment that was previously not available on the E-Series, including adaptive cruise control, a forward collision avoidance system, a lane departure warning system, and automatic high-beam front headlamps.

Meanwhile, the touchscreen Ford Sync infotainment system was eliminated. The only available factory audio system is a basic single DIN model with AM/FM radio, Bluetooth for hands-free calling and wireless stereo audio streaming, and a USB input.
==Production and sales==

== Platform ==
The Econoline/E-Series platform was designated VN58 in the late 1980s. The platform architecture was introduced in 1974, when Ford introduced the third generation of the Econoline full-size van, the first produced with a full-length frame. For 1992, the fourth-generation Econoline/Club Wagon/E-Series was introduced, marking a substantial revision to the chassis architecture and a completely new body. The platform was later redesignated VN127.

Following the introduction of the V363N Ford Transit, the VN E-Series ended production as a cargo/passenger van after the 2014 model year. From the 2015 model year onward, the E-Series has remained in production as a cutaway-cab chassis (no bodywork aft of the front doors) and as a stripped chassis (with no bodywork).

This is the final chassis that uses the Ford &quot;Twin-I-Beam&quot; front suspension architecture.

Vehicles using this platform include:
* Ford Econoline/Club Wagon/E-Series – full size vans (VN58, about 1989; VN127 1995)
* Ford Carousel – cancelled mid-size van based on SWB Econoline (planned for 1975–1976)

<text>The Madejski Stadium (), currently known as the Select Car Leasing Stadium for sponsorship reasons, is a football stadium in Reading, Berkshire, England. It is the home of Reading Football Club, who play in EFL League One. It also provides the finish for the Reading Half Marathon. It is an all-seater bowl stadium with a capacity of 24,161 and is located close to the M4 motorway and Reading Green Park railway station. The West Stand contains the Voco Reading Hotel.

The stadium was opened on 22 August 1998 and replaced Elm Park as Reading&#x27;s home ground. It was named after John Madejski, who was chairman of Reading FC and provided most of the funding.

==History==
In January 1990, the Taylor Report made all-seater stadiums compulsory in the top two divisions of English football for the 1994–95 season. Having played in the second tier of the English league several times before, Reading were champions of Division Two in 1994, and were promoted to Division One. Reading became subject to the Taylor requirements. Converting Elm Park to an all-seater stadium was not practical, so a location in Smallmead (to the south of the town) was identified as the site for a new stadium. The location of a closed landfill, the site was purchased for £1, on the condition that the club develop the A33 relief road. Construction of the new stadium, which was undertaken by Birse Group, was underway by 1997, and the last competitive match at Elm Park took place on 3 May 1998 against Norwich City, with Reading losing 1–0, having already been relegated to Division Two.

Reading began the 1998–99 season at the Madejski Stadium. It was opened on 22 August 1998 when Reading beat Luton Town 3–0, with Grant Brebner scoring the first goal at the stadium. Following the death of academy manager Eamonn Dolan in 2016, the North Stand was renamed as a memorial to him.

For the first time in its history, Reading Football Club participated in the Premier League in the 2006–07 season. As a result of the sell-out crowds for their first few fixtures of the season, the club announced its intention, in October 2006, to make a planning application to extend the ground to between 37,000 and 38,000 seats. The application was made on 24 January 2007, proposing initially the extension of the East Stand with a further 6,000 seats (raising capacity to around 30,000) and subsequently extension of the North and South Stands to reach the full proposed capacity.

On 24 May 2007, it was announced that planning permission had been granted to extend the stadium to a capacity of 36,900. The first phase will expand the East Stand by 6,600 seats. Work was set to start in mid-2008, after the initial plan of extending in 2007 was scrapped due to spectator seats being affected, during the work, already being sold to season ticket holders.

Reading&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League in 2008 meant that all expansion plans were put on hold, but were revived when promotion was again achieved in 2012.

Plans to expand the ground were again put on hold after Reading were relegated back to the Football League Championship at the end of the 2012–13 season after a goalless draw at home to QPR on 28 April 2013.

In July 2021, at the beginning of the 150th anniversary season, it was announced that the Madejski Stadium had been rebranded as the Select Car Leasing Stadium for the next ten years. In honour of Sir John Madejski, the East Stand was renamed as &quot;The Sir John Madejski Stand&quot;.

==Structure and facilities==

The stadium cost more than £50m to build and the pitch incorporates a system of synthetic fibres interwoven with natural grass, installed at a cost of more than £750,000. It is built on the site of a landfill site and is surrounded by methane vents.

The Eamonn Dolan Stand capacity is 4,946 including 25 spaces for wheelchairs. Although in use for all Reading matches, the stand was normally closed for London Irish and only opened in exceptional circumstances where demand required.

The South Stand has a capacity of 4,350 including 29 wheelchair spaces and contains an area for visiting supporters. The initial allocation visiting teams received up until the 2022–23 season was 2,127 and is the half of the stand joining onto the West Stand. The other half of the South Stand is Club 1871, a home fans member area, which encourages safe standing to create a matchday atmosphere. Under the terms of their original lease, London Irish only utilised the South Stand for the most popular matches. However, with the original renegotiation and extension of the lease, the South Stand was used for all London Irish matches with an unreserved seating plan. London Irish sold season tickets for South Stand between 2008 and 2014–15. Since 2015, with falling attendance at London Irish, the South Stand remained closed for rugby and only opened if required.

The Sir John Madejski Stand (East) has a capacity of 7,286 including 18 spaces for wheelchairs. The stand also contains the stadium&#x27;s video screen which is located in the corner adjoining the South Stand. The stand was open for all London Irish fixtures only until the end of the 2015–16 season and again for the 2017–18 and 2019–20 seasons.
The West Stand, the stadium&#x27;s main stand, has a capacity of 7,579 including 15 wheelchair spaces and contains a lower and an upper tier. The upper level does not overhang the lower tier and the executive boxes are located between the two tiers. The tunnel and dugouts are located in this stand. During the 2016–17 and 2018–19 seasons, the West Stand was the only stand in regular use for London Irish home games. The outside of the stand contains the Voco Reading hotel, a member of InterContinental Hotels Group&#x27;s Voco chain]. From the 2023–24 season the initial allocation for visiting fans will be located in the upper west corner.

==International football==
The stadium has hosted five England under-21 internationals. These were as follows.

An England B match was also held at the stadium.

Other international matches.

==Rugby union==

Although a designated football stadium, the stadium was used regularly since opening for rugby union. Richmond were the first rugby team to become Reading&#x27;s tenants, using the stadium from its opening season in 1998 after outgrowing their original home of Richmond Athletic Ground. This tenancy lasted only one season as Richmond went into administration and were nominally merged into London Irish.

London Irish moved into the stadium in 2000 after a year of ground sharing with Harlequins at the Stoop Memorial Ground in Twickenham. On 11 January 2008, it was announced that London Irish had reached an agreement to continue playing home games at the stadium until 2026. However, they were to leave after the 2019–20 season. London Irish played their last game at the stadium on 1 March 2020 when they were defeated by Wasps. The COVID-19 pandemic had disrupted the season causing a premature end to their tenancy and forcing them to return to the Stoop for the remainder of the elongated season.

Irish saw their average crowds grow to more than 11,100 after moving to Reading in 2000, holding the record for the biggest rugby union Premiership attendance at a club ground, when 23,709 people saw Irish play Wasps (then London Wasps) on 16 March 2008. This record stood until 19 September 2009, when Leicester Tigers opened their new stand to increase capacity to 24,000.

In addition to London Irish home matches, the stadium has also hosted several knock out phases of European cup rugby where a neutral ground was required or where teams were required to play at a larger capacity ground.

==Music==
Besides football, the Madejski Stadium can be configured to hold other events, including concerts.

On 13 June 2004, Busted played at the Madejski Stadium, with an attendance of 20,000.

On 26 May 2005, Elton John played at the Madejski Stadium in front of a crowd of 24,000. Reading FC supporters were given priority, with tickets going on sale on the 9 December 2004 ahead of the general sale on 14 December. This was followed by XS Madness on 6 June, attended by 9,000. The event featured multiple performers including McFly, Rachel Stevens, Charlotte Church, Bananarama and Melanie C.

Luciano Pavarotti was due to perform the stadium on 1 July 2006, after being delayed from the 11 June due the singer&#x27;s neck surgery to repair two vertebrae. His final public performance was at opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, before his death in 2007 from pancreatic cancer. He underwent surgery in early July 2006, with all his remaining concerts being cancelled.

On 3 July 2006, the Red Hot Chili Peppers played the Madejski Stadium as part of their Stadium Arcadium World Tour, with a crowd of 28,000 turning up for the event.

On 1 June 2013, the AllStarz Summer Party was held. JLS performed, with the headliner being Jessie J.

==Other uses==
The Madejski was selected as the venue for a charity friendly football match on 3 May 2006, featuring celebrities and football legends from England and Germany. The Match, named &quot;England vs Germany: The Legends&quot; was held to raise money for the Bobby Moore Fund and the British Red Cross and to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of England winning the 1966 World Cup. The German team won the match 4–2, in an exact reversal of the score from 1966, in front of a crowd of 20,000.

The stadium is also the final venue for the Reading Senior Cup.

Runners finishing the Reading Half Marathon cross the finish line inside the stadium. The stadium is also used as a hub for pre- and post-event services e.g. public transport terminus and bag drop during the day of the event.

A match from the 2000 Rugby League World Cup was also held here.
From February 2021 onwards, the stadium was used by the NHS as a mass vaccination centre as part of the nationwide vaccine rollout, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Records==
The highest attendance at the stadium was 24,184 (apparently exceeding the stadium&#x27;s stated capacity) on 17 November 2012 for the Premier League game with Everton beating the previous record of 24,160 set on 16 September 2012 for the Premier League game with Tottenham Hotspur. The highest attendance for a cup match at the stadium was 24,107 on 3 December 2003 for the Football League Cup match with Chelsea.

Notes
==Transport==
On Reading match days, the stadium is served by a network of special bus services provided by Reading Buses and Stagecoach Buses. Two of these (Reading Buses F1 and F2) provide regular shuttle services from Reading railway station and from a park and ride site at Shinfield Park respectively. Fourteen further Reading Bus services provide links from various Reading suburbs and nearby towns and villages, including Newbury and Henley on Thames. Stagecoach services provide links from Basingstoke, Farnborough, Wokingham and Bracknell.

When no matches are taking place, the stadium can be reached from Reading town centre using Reading Buses &quot;Greenwave&quot; services.

The stadium is also close to Reading Green Park railway station, which also serves the adjacent Green Park Business Park. It is on the Reading–Basingstoke line and opened in May 2023. The new station is just under a walk from the stadium.

<text>The Santiago General Cemetery () in Santiago, Chile, is one of the largest cemeteries in Latin America with an estimated two million burials. The cemetery was established in 1821 after Chile&#x27;s independence when Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins inaugurated the Alameda de las Delicias along the old course of the Mapocho River. O&#x27;Higgins set aside more than 85 hectares of land for the foundation of what became a magnificent grounds filled with ornate mausoleums surrounded by palm and leaf trees set amidst lush gardens and numerous sculptures, which have been estimated be 237. The cemetery, which is located northwest of Cerro Blanco, serves as a true urban park for Santiago located in the municipality of Recoleta.

This cemetery is the final resting place for at least 172 of the most influential people in Chile, including all but two of the deceased Presidents of Chile, the exceptions being Gabriel González Videla and Augusto Pinochet. One of the most visited memorials is that of former President Salvador Allende who had been buried in the Santa Ines cemetery at Viña del Mar following his suicide in the 1973 coup d&#x27;état. With the democratic changes that began in the 1990s, Allende was exhumed and his remains were transported in a solemn procession through the streets of Santiago to a place of honor in the Cementerio General de Santiago. The cemetery also has a memorial to the people that were &#x27;disappeared&#x27; during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet that ousted President Allende.

The gatehouse that serves as the main entrance to the cemetery is crowned by a dome, which acts as a terminating vista for La Paz Avenue. This entrance is preceded by the Plaza La Paz, a semicircular plaza whose curved portion is framed by two exposed brick arcades. At the center of the square stands a monument dedicated to the people who died in the Church of the Company Fire. The cemetery can be accessed via Cementerios metro station.

The historical portion of the cemetery was designated as a national monument in 2010, reaching the same status as Patio 29.

<doc id="867379" wikidata="Q7619622" url="?curid=867379" title="Stonyhurst">
<text>Stonyhurst is a rural estate owned by the Society of Jesus near Clitheroe in Lancashire, England. It is centred on Stonyhurst College, occupying the great house, its preparatory school Stonyhurst Saint Mary&#x27;s Hall and the parish church, St Peter&#x27;s.

==The Estate==
The grounds are bounded by the River Hodder, the village of Hurst Green and Longridge Fell. The Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty overlaps in places.

The earliest deed for the estate dates back to 1200 A.D. when it was known as the &quot;Stanihurst&quot;. It passed through the Bayley family to their descendants, the Shireburns (&quot;Sherburnes&quot; etc), before passing into the hands of Thomas Weld (of Lulworth). Already possessing a large estate, he donated it to the Jesuits in 1794 as a new home for their school, of which he was an old boy when it was located at Liège. A junior branch of the Sherburnes, who had earlier fled to Oxford to build and dwell in Beam Hall, subsequently emigrated to New England, where they contributed in various ways to the early history of the United States; these descendants included Henry Sherburne and John Sherburne.

==Buildings==
Stonyhurst College and Stonyhurst Saint Mary&#x27;s Hall are Jesuit boarding schools with approximately 800 pupils in total, most of whom are boarders. The schools are connected by parallel footpaths through the woods, known as Brothers&#x27; Walk. The name derives from the fact that before the schools became co-educational, pupils from the college would take the route to visit their younger brothers at Saint Mary&#x27;s Hall although the term could originate from when St Mary&#x27;s Hall operated as a seminary for trainee Jesuits. They walked along the path reciting the Spiritual Exercises of St Ignatius. A number of teachers and Jesuit priests work and live on the site. Adjacent to the school buildings are workshops employing masons and craftsmen working on the maintenance and restoration of the buildings. There is a large mill which was once a granary but is currently used as a sawmill. 

The Church of St Peter is the parish church for the neighbouring village of Hurst Green. The Stonyhurst Observatory began operations in 1838, transferring to a new building in 1866. The records of temperature taken there are the oldest continual daily records in the world. Today, the observatory is one of four used by the Met Office to provide temperature data for central England.

The estate contains the two hamlets of Stockbridge and Woodfields, both of which are inhabited by teachers from Stonyhurst College. Hodder Place, the former site of the preparatory school is now divided into residential flats which are privately owned; the grounds remain part of the estate. Richard Sherburne built an almshouse on Longridge Fell, the predecessor of the Sherburne Almshouse, which his son Sir Nicholas built in circa 1707. The latter was dismantled in 1946 and re-erected in Hurst Green.

==Monuments==

Religious monuments in the area are a reminder of the Jesuit presence and strength of Catholicism in the locality. Most notably, the Lady Statue at the top of the Avenue connecting Stonyhurst College with Hurst Green. It was erected in 1882, and is inscribed with the words &quot;Ave Maria&quot;.
Cromwell&#x27;s rock is situated at the top of the Avenue, near St Peter&#x27;s church graveyard. According to tradition, Cromwell stood on this inconspicuous stone and described the mansion ahead of him as &quot;the finest half-house in England&quot; (the symmetry of the building was, at that time, incomplete).

The grounds of St Mary&#x27;s Hall contain a Marian grotto and a statue of the Sacred Heart.

Four old crosses stand at disparate locations around the estate: 
*The Pinfold Cross is a memorial to a former servant at Stonyhurst College and fiddler, James Wells, who fell to his death in a quarry nearby on 12 February 1834. It was erected in 1834 at Stockbridge. On the front is inscribed the legend, ‘WATCH FOR YOU KNOW NOT THE DAY NOR HOUR.&#x27; Above this is written, ‘OFT EVENINGS GLAD MAKE MORNINGS SAD&#x27;. On the left is ‘PRAY FOR THE SOUL OF JAMES WELLS&#x27; and on the right, ‘DIED FEB. 12TH, 1834&#x27;.
*Saint Paulinus&#x27; Cross stands at Kemple End and is a listed monument believed to date from Anglo-Saxon times. It may well mark a spot at which Saint Paulinus of York, who converted King Edwin of Northumbria and founded the See of York, preached.
*Hague’s Cross stands above the River Hodder in the woods close to the former Jesuit novitiate and preparatory school, Hodder Place. This commemorates the death of William Hague, who drowned in the Hodder here (the old Stonyhurst bathing huts are located in Hodder Wood), on the 5th of April, 1877. 
Pupils from the school used to visit each cross in an annual pilgrimage to mark Palm Sunday. 

==Tourism==

The estate is a tourist attraction. Many visitors come to view the grade one listed Stonyhurst College, which is open for tours during the summer. The gardens of the college are also open to visitors and include a small shop in the meteorological station. The area is also criss-crossed with public footpaths, in particular the Tolkien Trail, a walk around some of the areas thought to have inspired the author during his stay at the college in the late 1940s.

Public events hosted on the estate include the Great British Food Festival and the Ribble Valley International Piano Week. Other visitors come to make use of the extensive sports facilities, including a golf course, swimming pool and astroturf hockey pitch.

Both of Asher&#x27;s parents are educators and science fiction fans. Although he began writing speculative fiction in secondary school, he did not turn seriously to writing until he was 25. He worked as a machinist and machine programmer and as a gardener from 1979 to 1987. Asher identifies &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and other fantasy work including Roger Zelazny&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Amber&quot; series as important early creative influences.

Asher published his first short story in 1989. In 2000 he was offered a three-book contract by Pan Macmillan, and his first full-length novel &quot;Gridlinked&quot; was published in 2001. This was the first in a series of novels made up of &quot;Gridlinked&quot;, &quot;The Line of Polity&quot;, &quot;Brass Man&quot;, &quot;Polity Agent&quot;, and &quot;Line War&quot;.

Asher is published by Tor, an imprint of Pan Macmillan, in the UK, and by Tor Books in the United States.

The majority of Asher&#x27;s work is set in one future history, the &quot;Polity&quot; universe. It encompasses many classic science fiction tropes including world-ruling artificial intelligences, androids, hive minds and aliens. His novels are characterized by fast-paced action and violent encounters. While his work is frequently epic in scope and thus nominally space opera, its graphic and aggressive tone is more akin to cyberpunk. When combined with the way that Asher&#x27;s main characters are usually acting to preserve social order or improve their society (rather than disrupt a society they are estranged from), these influences could place his work in the subgenre known as post-cyberpunk.

==Awards==
* British Fantasy Society Award nomination, 1999, for stories &quot;Sucker&quot; and &quot;Mason&#x27;s Rats III&quot;
* SF Review Best Book designation, 2002, for &quot;The Skinner&quot;

<doc id="867384" wikidata="Q3276805" url="?curid=867384" title="Maggott">
<text>Maggott (Japheth) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was briefly a member of the X-Men.

A flamboyant South African mutant who spoke in exaggerated Afrikaans slang, Maggott was advertised as one of the strangest X-Men. His digestive system took the form of two slugs which could eat through practically any substance. After feeding, the slugs reentered Maggott&#x27;s abdomen and passed nourishment into him, giving him incredible power.

==Publication history==
Maggott was created by writer Scott Lobdell and artist Joe Madureira, and first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #345 (June 1997).

==Fictional character biography==
Maggott was first seen as a mysterious mutant who is searching out the X-Men’s adversary Magneto for an unknown reason. His search led to Antarctica where Magneto was holding the X-Men captive. Maggott then joined up with the team and returned with them to their Westchester, New York headquarters.

For a short period of time, Maggott believed his companions were going off on their own and killing innocent people. He even tried to turn himself over to the police before being stopped by the X-Men. His companions turned out to be innocent, as the people had been slain by a faction of N&#x27;Garai, though they hated to be called so. These entities are a demonic-type race that the X-Men had faced many times, mainly because a regenerating magical portal lies deep in the woods on the mansion&#x27;s grounds. A matter which was never resolved was why Maggott&#x27;s slugs were seemingly related to the N&#x27;Garai.

Maggott later was tempted by the entity Shadow King with promises of a better life in exchange for his loyalty and abandonment of the X-Men. He managed to resist the villain. Marrow and Cecilia Reyes were also propositioned by the King, but also resisted. Psylocke then rescues the X-Men after keeping Shadow King in a psionic prison, which forced her in retirement as she could not use her mind powers for anything or else the Shadow King would be released from the prison within Psylocke&#x27;s mind.

At first, he kept his past to himself, but Maggott eventually revealed his origin to Wolverine. Maggott had been born a sickly child in Apartheid-era South Africa and was named Japheth. He was always very ill and could not digest solid food. Feeling himself to be a burden on his family, he ran away from home with his younger brother. Having left home, hoping to die, he was found by Magneto, who uncovered the mutant slugs living in his digestive system. Compassionate at heart, Japheth immediately rejected Magneto&#x27;s philosophy and his offer to join him after witnessing him massacre white soldiers who were engaged in racist atrocities against black South African civilians. In spite of this, he later sought out Magneto when he got older, for help in easing the pain caused by his unique mutation. After the then-current roster of the team parted ways, the X-Man Beast suggested Maggott transfer to the junior team Generation X, but his tenure there lasted only one issue and afterwards he fell out of sight. 

Maggott reappeared as an inmate at &quot;Neverland,&quot; a concentration camp run by the covert government program Weapon X. Along with a number of other mutants, he was exterminated there.

One of his slugs, which he gave away to two children at the camp after foreseeing his death (thanks to his psychometric powers) at the camp, was last seen in a container in Mister Sinister&#x27;s laboratory.

Maggott is later resurrected by means of the Transmode Virus to serve as part of Selene&#x27;s army of deceased mutants. Under the control of Selene and Eli Bard, he takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of Utopia. Maggott&#x27;s fate is uncertain as it is unknown if he was among the mutants teleported to Genosha by Blink to serve as a sacrifice to the newly-deitious Selene or if he was among the mutants that managed to escape Utopia.

Maggott was confirmed to still be alive and powered (though with only one of his slugs) as he was a guest at a superheroes and supervillains-themed costume party of New York branch of the Hellfire Club and was later apparently passed out drunk with other party guests (such as Rocket Raccoon) around an outdoor swimming pool. 

Maggott appeared (along with both of his slugs) along with the other X-Men as part of Cyclops&#x27; Million Mutant March in Washington D.C.

Maggott briefly appears during the &quot;X-Men Disassembled&quot; storyline battling Nate Grey. He later becomes a citizen of Krakoa, and is among the mutants hunted by Kraven the Hunter during the &quot;A.X.E.: Judgment Day&quot; storyline.

==Powers and abilities==
Maggott&#x27;s digestive system consists of a hollow cavity that houses two slugs called Eany and Meany. They share a telepathic link with him and can temporarily emerge from his body to digest solid matter, giving him superhuman strength and durability. He additionally possesses a form of psychometry that enables him to view the recent past and future by reading psychic imprints from the environment.

==Reception==
In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Maggott 100th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===Age of X===
An alternate universe variant of Maggott from Earth-11326 appears in &quot;Age of X: Universe&quot; #1. This version is a prisoner of Camp Gorge before being killed by Iron Man.

===Ultimate Marvel===
An alternate universe variant of Maggott from Earth-1610 makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #47 as one of several mutants killed by Mister Sinister.

===Battleworld X-Tinction Agenda===

===Age of X-Man===

<text>Theodor Duesterberg (; 19 October 1875 – 4 November 1950) was a military officer in the Imperial German Army and later leader of the veterans&#x27; organisation &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; in Germany prior to the Nazi seizure of power.

==Military service==
Born the son of an army surgeon in Darmstadt in the Grand Duchy of Hesse, Duesterberg entered the Prussian Army on 22 March 1893 as an officer candidate in &quot;Infanterie-Regiment Bremen (1. Hanseatisches) Nr. 75&quot; and was commissioned a &quot;Sekondelieutenant&quot; on 18 August 1894.&lt;ref name=&quot;BArch N 1377/1&quot;&gt;German Federal Archives (Bundesarchiv), Nachlass von Theodor Duesterberg, BArch N 1377/1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, Duesterberg was assigned to the East Asian Expedition Corps that saw action in China during the Boxer Rebellion, where he was lightly wounded in the right arm. After returning to Germany, he was promoted to &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; on 27 January 1904 and to &quot;Hauptmann&quot; on 10 September 1908. He was transferred to the War Ministry in Berlin on 22 March 1914. 

With the start of the First World War, Duesterberg returned to the infantry on the Western Front on 16 August 1914. He was promoted to &quot;Major&quot; on 5 September 1914. and served as a battalion commander in &quot;Großherzoglich Mecklenburgisches Grenadier-Regiment Nr. 89&quot; and &quot;Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 15&quot; and as adjutant of the 13th Infantry Division. He was wounded on 17 November 1914 with &quot;Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 15&quot; Duesterberg was transferred back to the War Ministry on 18 July 1915, serving there as chief of the section &quot;Allied Armies&quot; until his retirement. 

He retired on 3 February 1920 with the &quot;Charakter&quot; of &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot;. His retirement was in protest over the Versailles Treaty, which Duesterberg viewed as being extremely unfair to Germany. Duesterberg subsequently decided to enter politics and joined the German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP) in 1919.

==&quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;==
After various disagreements with the party leadership, however, Duesterberg left the DNVP in 1923 and joined the nationalistic and pro-monarchy &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;, which largely consisted of ex-servicemen disgruntled with the Weimar Republic. Duesterberg quickly moved through its hierarchy and by 1924 was one of two of its federal leaders (the other being Franz Seldte). Together with General Georg Ludwig Rudolf Maercker, Duesterberg was one of the leaders of the extreme anti-Semitic faction within &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; who wanted to ban Jews from joining, and expel all of the current Jewish members. In March 1924, Maercker and Duesterberg forced Seldte to adopt the &quot;Aryan clause&quot; and expel all Jews from &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;. The &quot;Aryan clause&quot; of 1924 was later to serve as the inspiration for similar &quot;Aryan clauses&quot; under the Third Reich, and in particular influenced the War Minister, General Werner von Blomberg in his attempts to keep the Wehrmacht &quot;racially clean&quot;. Under Duesterberg&#x27;s leadership, &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; became Germany&#x27;s largest para-military group.

In the late 1920s, Duesterberg allied &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; with the Nazi Party and other right wing groups. In 1929 Duesterberg campaigned against the Young Plan in the referendum held in November 1929. In 1931, Duesterberg played a key role in forcing the referendum on early elections in Prussia, believing this would help polarize German politics by incorporating the moderate right into the &quot;national&quot; camp. The leader of the German National People&#x27;s Party, Alfred Hugenberg had starting in 1929 embarked upon a strategy of polarization aimed at the destruction of the political center in Germany, so that the only alternatives were the Marxist parties in the form of the SPD and KPD and the right-wing &quot;national&quot; parties. The failure of the Prussian referendum helped to win Duesterberg away from his strategy of attempting to co-opt the moderate right into the &quot;national&quot; camp, and instead to work for the destruction of the moderate right as Hugenberg advocated. In October 1931, Duesterberg allied &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;m with the Nazis, DNVP, and other right wing groups in order to form the Harzburger Front. The Harzburger Front attempted to bring about the downfall of Heinrich Brüning and the Weimar Republic, but it eventually dissolved due to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s unwillingness to subordinate the Nazi Party to such a vast right wing coalition on a long-term basis. After the dissolution of the Harzburger Front, Duesterberg continued to lead &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; and maintained the organization&#x27;s alliance with the DNVP.

==1932 presidential election==

In 1932, Duesterberg was nominated by &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; and DNVP to run for President of Germany, but the Nazis ultimately destroyed any chance Duesterberg had of gaining mass support from the German people when they revealed he had Jewish ancestry. In April 1932, the deeply anti-Semitic Duesterberg learned for the first time that his grandfather was a Prussian Jewish doctor who converted to Lutheranism in 1818, a revelation that caused Duesterberg to suffer a nervous breakdown and to submit his resignation in shame from &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;. Several of Duesterberg&#x27;s friends persuaded him not to resign, and in an attempt to stay on as &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; deputy federal leader, he suggested new requirements for every member, namely that:
*That &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; members present notarized copies of church records proving that their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents had no &quot;Jewish blood&quot;. 
*That &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; members swear on their word of honor that they had no personal, familial or business dealings with Jews in any form or way. 
*That &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; members present proof that their ancestors had fought in the &quot;wars of liberation&quot; against Napoleonic France and/or the wars of unification and on what side. 
*That &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; members present proof that they had fought in the World War and in what capacity. 
The revelation of Duesterberg&#x27;s Jewish ancestry caused Duesterberg to poll poorly in the first ballot of the election, and he withdrew from the runoff election that followed.

During the 1932 presidential elections, the Nazis went out of their way to taunt Duesterberg for having Jewish ancestry with Joseph Goebbels and Richard Walther Darré being especially vicious in their attacks. Duesterberg was so hurt by Darré&#x27;s attacks that he challenged him to a duel, a challenge that Darré rejected because it was beneath him to fight a man with &quot;Jewish blood&quot;. Duesterberg then took up his dispute with Darré before the court of honor of the Former Officers of the 1st Hanoverian Field Artillery Regiment of Scharnhorst, number 10 to which Darré belonged. Duesterberg argued before the court of honor that Darré should be expelled for engaging in behavior that was unbecoming of a German officer while Darré argued that he had right and duty to subject Duesterberg to anti-Semitic insults. The court of honor ruled in Darré&#x27;s favor, stating that he was right to insult Duesterberg for having &quot;Jewish blood&quot;.

Ironically, Duesterberg was offered a position in Hitler&#x27;s cabinet when Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, but Duesterberg flatly refused the proposal. Franz Seldte, however, did enter Hitler&#x27;s cabinet, which undermined &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; and Duesterberg&#x27;s authority over the organization, and thus he resigned his leadership position in 1933. In April 1933, Duesterberg was strongly urged to resign from &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; by President Paul von Hindenburg and the Defense Minister, General Werner von Blomberg, who told him that he was now a liability to them with Hitler now chancellor.

==Arrest and later life==
In 1934, Duesterberg was arrested by the Nazis during the Night of the Long Knives and sent to Dachau concentration camp, where he was briefly interned. After being released, he drifted into obscurity. He was known to have had limited contacts with the anti-Nazi Carl Friedrich Goerdeler in 1943, but Duesterberg ultimately did not play any role in Goerdeler&#x27;s plots against Hitler. In 1949, Duesterberg wrote &quot;The Steel Helmet and Hitler,&quot; in which he defended his pre-war political career and &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; and detailed the movement&#x27;s independence from the Nazi Party and &quot;the insane Jew hatred preached by Hitler&quot;. A year later, Duesterberg died in Hamelin.

<text>The Musée du Montparnasse was a museum at 21 Avenue du Maine, in the 15th arrondissement, Montparnasse Quarter of Paris, France. The museum closed in 2015.

==Background==
The museum opened its doors on 28 May 1998. Located at the former site of the early-1900s of the Russian painter, Marie Vassilieff, the museum was founded by Roger Pic and Jean-Marie Drot as a nonprofit operation.

The museum provided visitors with a history of the multitude of artists who came from around the world to live and work in Montparnasse at the beginning of the twentieth century, plus the museum put on temporary exhibitions of works by Montparnasse artists, both past and present. 

For years, both before and during World War I, Marie Vassilieff also operated what was registered as a private club that acted as a canteen for artists where food and drink were provided as cheaply as possible to struggling painters such as, Amedeo Modigliani, Chaïm Soutine, Pablo Picasso, and others.

Before long it became the gathering place for many others in the area and, by 1913, Vassilieff&#x27;s canteen was so widely known that painter, sculptor, and filmmaker, Fernand Léger, gave two lectures there on the topic of Modern art.

As part of a membership program, the Musée du Montparnasse offered a once-a-month evening meeting where members gathered to enjoy a variety of cultural events.

Tata Group entered the commercial vehicle sector in 1954 after forming a joint venture with Mercedes-Benz of Germany in which Tata developed a manufacturing facility in Jamshedpur for Daimler lorries. By November 1954 Tata and Daimler manufactured their first goods carrier chassis at their Jamshedpur plant with 90-100 hp and capacity of 3-5 tons.

Tata launched the Indica in 1998. A newer version of the car, named Indica V2, later appeared. Tata Motors also exported cars to South Africa.

In 1999, Tata Motors had a setback and decided to sell the car business. US auto giant, Ford was seen an ideal candidate. Officials from Ford came to Bombay House to talk with Tata. During the meeting at the Tata headquarters, American company evinced interest in buying out the business. To take the deal forward, Ratan Tata and his team flew to Detroit, USA to meet with the Ford&#x27;s chairman, Bill Ford. The meeting lasted for three hours. During the meeting, Ford humiliated Tata by saying that they should have never started Tata Motors when they didn’t have a clue about manufacturing cars. Recalling this incident Tata group veteran, Praveen Kadle who was in the meeting said, that Ford told them, &quot;You do not know anything about passenger cars, why did you start the passenger car division at all? We are doing a favour by buying your car division&quot;.

This incident made Ratan Tata to step back from the deal and concentrate on the Tata Motors&#x27; car division.

Later in 2008, during the Great Recession, Ford verged on bankruptcy. Tata offered to buy their Jaguar Land Rover for $2.3 billion. Ford chairperson thanked Tata by saying &quot;You are doing us a big favour by buying JLR.&quot;

In the 2000s, Tata Motors made a series of acquisitions and partnerships, acquiring Daewoo&#x27;s South Korea-based truck manufacturing unit, a joint venture with the Brazil-based Marcopolo, Tata Marcopolo Bus, Jaguar Land Rover., Hispano Carrocera, and an 80% stake in the Italian design and engineering company Trilix.

On 12 October 2021, private equity firm TPG invested $1 billion in Tata Motors&#x27; electric vehicle subsidiary.

It is the second-largest heavy commercial vehicle manufacturer in South Korea and was acquired by Tata Motors in 2004. The principal reasons behind the acquisition were to reduce Tata&#x27;s dependence on the Indian commercial vehicle market (which was responsible for around 94% of its sales in the MHCV segment and around 84% in the light commercial vehicle segment) and expand its product portfolio by leveraging on Daewoo&#x27;s strengths in the heavy-tonnage sector.

Tata Motors has jointly worked with Tata Daewoo to develop trucks such as Novus and World Truck and buses including GloBus and StarBus. In 2012, Tata began developing a new line to manufacture competitive and fuel-efficient commercial vehicles to face the competition posed by the entry of international brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and Navistar into the Indian market.

In December 2020, Marcopolo and Tata Motors came to an agreement, whereby Tata Motors would purchase the 49 percent stake held by Marcopolo in the bus-making joint venture for ₹100 crore, bringing curtains to the 14-year old partnership and paving the way for a smooth exit for the Brazilian company. The deal was completed on 29 August 2022. The deal allowed Tata Motors to continue using the ‘Marcopolo’ trademark for a minimum of three years with a non-compete provision in India for a corresponding period.

== Subsidiaries ==

 The Jaguar F-Pace made Consumer Reports February 2019 list of the 10 Least Reliable Cars. The editors cited &quot;electronics, drive system, power equipment, noises and leaks&quot; as problematic aspects.
The Jaguar Land Rover subsidiary was struggling by 2019 and Tata Motors wrote down its investment in JLR by $3.9 billion. Much of the financial problem was due to a 50% drop in sales in China during 2019, although the situation was improving. Still, Tata was open to considering a partnership with another company according to a statement in mid-October, as long as the partnership agreement would allow Tata to maintain control of the business. The company ruled out the possibility of a sale of JLR to another entity.

In July 2023, Tata announced its plans to invest £4 billion to build an electric car battery factory in the UK, which will be one of the largest of its kind in Europe. The factory will be the company&#x27;s first battery production facility outside India. Located in Bridgwater, Somerset, the factory will supply Jaguar Land Rover&#x27;s future battery electric models, including the Range Rover, Defender, Discovery and Jaguar brands, with the potential to also supply other car manufacturers. Production at the new facility is due to start in 2026.

==Notable vehicles==

===Tata Nano===

The Nano was launched in 2009 as a city car intended to appeal as an affordable alternative to the section of the Indian populace that is primarily the owner of motorcycles and has not bought their first car. Initially priced at ₹100,000 (US$1,500), the vehicle attracted a lot of attention for its relatively low price. However, the Nano was very poorly rated for safety and in 2018, Cyrus Mistry, chairman of the Tata Group, called the Tata Nano a failed project, with production ending in May 2018.

===Tata Ace===
Tata Ace, India&#x27;s first indigenously developed sub-one-ton minitruck, was launched in May 2005. The minitruck was a huge success in India with auto analysts claiming that Ace had changed the dynamics of the light commercial vehicle (LCV) market in the country by creating a new market segment termed the small commercial vehicle segment. Ace rapidly emerged as the first choice for transporters and single truck owners for city and rural transport.

By October 2005, LCV sales of Tata Motors had grown by 36.6% to 28,537 units due to the rising demand for Ace. The Ace was built with a load body produced by Autoline Industries.

By 2005, Autoline was producing 300 load bodies per day for Tata Motors. Ace is still a top seller for TML with 500,000 units sold by June 2010. In 2011, Tata Motors invested Rs 1000 crore in Dharwad Plant, Karnataka, with the capacity of 90,000 units annually and launched two models of 0.5-T capacity as Tata Ace Zip, Magic Iris. Ace has also been exported to several Asian, European, South American, and African countries and all-electric models are sold through Polaris Industries&#x27; Global Electric Motorcars division. In Sri Lanka, it is sold through Diesel &amp; Motor Engineering (DIMO) PLC under the name of DIMO Batta.

===Tata Prima===
Tata Prima is a range of heavy trucks first introduced in 2008 as the company&#x27;s &#x27;global&#x27; truck. Tata Prima was the winner of the &#x27;Commercial Vehicle of the Year&#x27; at the Apollo Commercial Vehicles Awards, 2010 and 2012.

===Tata 407===
The Tata 407 is a light commercial vehicle (LCV) that has sold over 500,000 units since its launch in 1986. In India, this vehicle dominates market share of the LCV category, accounting for close to 75% of LCV sales. The 407 model range includes trucks, tippers, pick-ups and vehicles for agri/food products, construction, light mining and services.

===Tata Harrier===
Tata Harrier is a 5-seater SUV that rivals the MG Hector and Jeep Compass. This car uses a 2.0L 4-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine from Fiat and a 6-speed transmission from Hyundai, available in both manual and automatic. Tata Harrier is derived from the H5X Concept displayed at the 2018 Auto Expo. It was launched on 23 January 2019.

The car is a C-segment crossover SUV based on the OmegaArc platform, an essentially re-engineered version of the Jaguar Land Rover D8 platform. A petrol variant of the Harrier is confirmed to launch in 2022–23.

Tata Harrier is also available in Nepal with the name H5.

===Tata Nexon===
The Tata Nexon is a subcompact crossover SUV produced by Tata Motors since 2017. It is the first crossover SUV from Tata Motors, and occupies the sub-4 metre crossover SUV segment in India. The electric version of the Nexon was revealed on 19 December 2019. The Nexon EV uses components from Tata Motors&#x27; electric vehicle technology brand Ziptron. The electric motor produces and of torque and 0 - 100 under 9.9 seconds. It has a 30.2 kWh battery with an ARAI rated range of up to 312 km.

The battery can be fully charged in under 8 hours using a complimentary AC charger. It can also be charged using a 15-ampere power cable that can be used at any place with the necessary power socket. DC 25 kW fast charging can be used to charge the battery from 0 to 80% in 1 hour.

== Restructuring ==
In March 2024, Tata Motors announced plans to undergo a significant restructuring by splitting into two separate listed entities. This strategic move aims to enhance operational efficiencies and focus on distinct business segments. The demerger is expected to allow each entity to pursue tailored growth strategies and attract specific investor bases. The announcement was well-received by the market, with Tata Motors&#x27; stock experiencing a notable jump following the news.

<text>Flint Island is an uninhabited coral island in the central Pacific Ocean, part of the Southern Line Islands under the jurisdiction of Kiribati. In 2014 the I-Kiribati government established a exclusion zone around each of the southern Line Islands (Caroline, Flint, Vostok, Malden, and Starbuck) preventing fishing in the surrounding waters.

==Geography==
Flint Island is located about northwest of Tahiti, south-southeast of Vostok Island, and southwest of Caroline Island. The island is about long and wide at its widest point (). It has a land area of and rises to a height of above sea level. The island is surrounded by a narrow fringing reef and with no safe anchorage, landing is difficult.

According to the U.S. Exploring Expedition (February 5, 1841), the island was thickly wooded with primeval forest, however the island is now mostly covered with planted coconut palms.

In the islands interior there are four lakes of brackish water with the largest, Lake Arundel being 168 meters across at its widest. The largest lake is theorized to be the remnant of a lagoon, the southernmost, Lake Chase was an old well that overflowed and the remaining lakes, Lake Mago and Lake Bunya were formed by guano mining. There is an abandoned network of tramways in the islands interior, which connect to Lake Mago and Lake Bunya, as they were formerly the largest guano mining area on the island.

There is a small landing in the north-west of the reef blasted in, which is marked by a 9 meter tall concrete obelisk on the beach.

Flint has been observed to experience much more rainfall than the other line islands, often experiencing weeks of rain at a time.

==History==
Flint Island was discovered by the Spanish expedition of Ferdinand Magellan on 4 February 1521, and charted as &quot;Tiburones&quot; (Sharks in Spanish) because of the many sharks that sailors fished in it. Together with Puka-Puka (named &quot;San Pablo&quot;) they were named &quot;Islas Infortunadas&quot; (Unfortunate Islands in Spanish). Flint island was rediscovered on April 8, 1809, by the American captain Obed Chase in ship &quot;Hope&quot; (belonging to Edmund Fanning). On the Island Chase had nailed an American coin to a tree, which would also make him the first known person to have set foot on it. This is likely where the modern name was coined. A now-discredited theory held that the island was named after Captain Keen, who visited in 1835, but an entry in Krusenstern&#x27;s &quot;Hydrographie der grössern Ozeane,&quot; published in 1819, makes it clear the island already had this name. Flint Island was claimed under the 1856 U.S. Guano Act, but it was apparently never occupied.

It was leased by the British to Houlder Brothers and Co. of London who carried out guano digging in the central part of the island from 1875 to 1880 under field manager John T. Arundel. From 1881 John T. Arundel &amp; Co. carried on the mining business. The excavated areas have since filled with brackish water, forming two of the four lakes. Coconut palms were planted on the island by Arundel in 1881 and copra was produced until 1891.

On 3 January 1908 a total eclipse of the sun was observed on the island by two expeditions, one from the Lick Observatory in California, and one from Australia and New Zealand which included Francis McClean and Henry Winkelmann. The observation point on the island was determined to be at latitude.

The island was leased in 1911 to S.R. Maxwell and Co., Ltd. who employed 30 men and one manager to harvest copra from the approximately 30,000 coconut palms. The settlement was abandoned in 1929. Today the coconut palms have taken over 96% of the island and have killed all but few pisonia trees.

On 11 August 1974 there were five Tahitian workers still mining guano, from a temporary camp, but the guano was of very poor quality and rarely actually sold.

== Flora and Fauna ==
During the 1974 Line Islands expedition, it was reported that Flint Island was covered in a dense wild jungle of palm trees. The jungle is moist and makes prime habitation for Emoia Impar, which inhabit most of the island at a density of over 30 per square meter. Sooty Terns, Red-Footed Boobies and Frigatebirds nest in the palm trees around the beaches, and Coconut Crabs live in the fallen trees in the jungle, which made it easier for them to reproduce to cover the island at a density of 1 per square meter, which could potentially give Flint Island the largest population of Coconut Crabs in the world, the other most likely contender would be South Islet in Caroline Atoll.

<text>The Tata Indica (from &quot;Indian Car&quot;) is a B-segment car launched by the Indian manufacturer Tata Motors in 1998. It was the first Indian hatchback with a diesel engine. It was the first passenger hatchback from Tata Motors, with previous models being station wagons and SUVs.

Indica is also considered one of India&#x27;s indigenously developed passenger cars, though not the first. , more than 9.1 lakh units had been produced and the platform had spawned close to 12 lakh (1.2 million) vehicles. Annual sales of Indica were as high as 1,44,690 units in 2006–2007. , monthly sales of Indica were around 8,000 units. The models were also exported to European and African countries from late 2004. The car was discontinued in April 2018.

==First generation (1998)==

On 30 December 1998, Tata Motors (previously called Telco) introduced the most modern car ever to be designed by an Indian company: the Indica. Initially introduced with the caption &quot;More car per car,&quot; the ad campaign focused on roomy interiors and affordability. Within a week of its unveiling in 1999, the company received 115,000 orders. Within two years, the Indica had become the number-one car in its segment.

Partly designed and developed by Tata Motors, it was a five-door compact hatchback with a 1.4-L petrol/diesel inline-four engine designated internally as 475DL. This was a homegrown engine derived from the engine used by Tata in their line of pick-ups and SUVs earlier, but with a shortened stroke. The original engine was designated as 483DL which stood for four-cylinder and 83-mm stroke.

The Indica offered options such as air conditioning and electric windows, which were previously restricted to upmarket imported cars in India. Three years later, the Indica was exported to European markets for the first time, and from 2003, the Indica was badge engineered and sold in the United Kingdom by MG Rover Group as the CityRover. This vehicle ceased production in April 2005 when Rover went bankrupt, and did not resume production when Rover&#x27;s new Chinese owner Nanjing Automobile launched its own versions of the Rover range in 2007.

The outer body styling was designed by the Italian design house I.DE.A Institute, under contract from Tata Motors, in close collaboration interaction with Tata&#x27;s in-house design team. The engine, however, was indigenous.

When first launched, the Indica prompted many complaints from early purchasers, who claimed that the vehicle did not deliver horsepower and mileage as promised. In response to the customer complaints, Tata Motors re-engineered the internals of the car and launched it as Indica V2 (version 2), which solved most of the complaints and emerged as one of the most sought-after cars in the Indian automobile industry. Later, it was again updated, now marketed as the &quot;Refreshingly New Indica V2&quot;. This was followed by the next variant of Indica, current in early 2008, called the Indica V2 Xeta Petrol, which delivers of power at a fuel efficiency of 14 km/L (about 33 mpg U.S., fuel consumption of 7.1 L/100 km) under standard test conditions. In Indian city conditions, fuel economy can drop to about 10 km/L (about 23.5 mpg U.S., 10 L/100 km).

Since the V1 and V2, which were visually identical, Tata had applied styling updates to the Indica in 2004, 2007 and 2012

In India, three versions were available with different trim levels.

* Indica V2 – 1.4-L diesel (naturally aspirated engine (NA) in the DLE and DLS; turbocharged option in the DLS (TC); turbocharged and intercooled (TCIC Engine) DLG and DLX; DiCOR engine offered in the DLS and DLG)
* Indica V2 Petrol – 1.4-L petrol MPFI with Hitachi ECU called Indica 2000, 1.2-L and 1.4-L petrol with Bosch ECU (Indica Xeta), 1.2-L LPG (GLE and GLS versions only)
* Indicab – 1.4-L naturally aspirated diesel (DL and DLE), a low-price car with the same framework but fewer features and luxuries, aimed at cab and contract transport business fleets. It is popular among transport business people.

Originally offered with 1.4-L petrol and diesel engines, a turbocharged diesel engine was introduced in October 2005; a 1.2-L petrol engine in November 2006, and a direct injection common rail (Dicor) diesel version of Indica V2 was launched in January 2008. It features 16 valves, double overhead camshafts, a variable geometry turbocharger, and an intercooler. The top-end GLG, GLX, DLG, DLX versions and the turbo and DiCOR diesel engines, as well as the 1.4-L petrol engines have been phased out with the introduction of the next-generation Indica Vista. The turbocharged engine was reintroduced in August 2010 as the turbomax in the DLE and DLS trim levels in metros where BS IV norms were introduced. Later in March 2011, the Indica eV2 was launched with a &#x27;CR4&#x27; engine similar to the earlier DiCor engine with features like Auto-Drive Assist and Clutch-To-Start and claims a class-leading ARAI mileage of 25 km/L

A compressed natural gas (CNG) was launched in 2001. It is offered as an option through OEM Bedini kits offered by Shrimanker Gas Services India on the Indica V2 XETA.

Faced with numerous CNG-related complaints, Tata organised a systematic recall and retrofit of Bedini equipment which included a new improved lambda sensor/electronic control unit, Bedini emulator, and new wiring harness approved and tested by both Tata and Automotive Research Association of India from 28 to 31 May 2007. With the new system, Tata aimed to improve gas delivery and performance.

In its home market, the Indica offers good interior capacity and competes with the Maruti Suzuki Swift, Maruti Wagon-R and Maruti Alto. The diesel versions, however, have little or no competition since few diesel cars exist in the Indica&#x27;s price bracket.

The slightly higher-than-average net weight makes for a slightly more comfortable ride compared to lighter cars. Fit and finish continue be criticised compared to offerings from Fiat and Maruti.

In the United Kingdom, a badge-engineered version was imported by the MG Rover Group and sold as the CityRover from 2003 until the bankruptcy of MG Rover in 2005. Other popular foreign markets include South Africa where the Indica and the Indicab models (known as B Line) are sold.

The Indica platform spawned a number of variants, including the Tata Indigo three-box saloon which includes the shorter Indigo CS, long-wheelbase XL, and the Indigo Marina estate.

This range of accessories was available for the Indica:
===Indica Silhouette Concept (2006)===
During India&#x27;s 2006 Auto Expo in New Delhi, Tata unveiled the Indica Silhouette concept car, a radical, high-performance Indica featuring rear-wheel drive, extensive bodywork, and a 3.5-litre V6.

The Indica Vista has two new Fiat engines, a 1.3 L Quadrajet common rail direct injection diesel and a 1.2 L Safire MPFI VVT petrol engine.

The Quadrajet (Fiat Multijet) is produced in Ranjangaon by the Tata-Fiat joint venture. The Indica Vista, previously rumoured to be named the Indica V3, was launched in August 2008. Subsequently, a 1.4l, 90ps petrol variant was also launched. The Vista 1.2l Petrol version, also known as Safire is criticised for its poor fuel economy which can range from 5 to 9 km/L of petrol within the city.

<doc id="867407" wikidata="Q5537863" url="?curid=867407" title="George Chichester, 3rd Marquess of Donegall">
<text>George Hamilton Chichester, 3rd Marquess of Donegall (10 February 1797 – 20 October 1883), styled Viscount Chichester until 1799 and Earl of Belfast between 1799 and 1844, was an Anglo-Irish landowner, courtier and politician. He served as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household from 1830 to 1834, as well as from 1838 to 1841, and as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard between 1848 and 1852. Ennobled in his own right in 1841, he was also Lord Lieutenant of Antrim from 1841 to 1883 and was made a Knight of St Patrick in 1857.

==Background and education==
Lord Donegall was born at Great Cumberland Place, London, the eldest son of Viscount Chichester (who became the 2nd Marquess of Donegall in 1799) by his wife Anna May, daughter of Sir Edward May, 2nd Baronet. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, before serving for a time as a captain with the 11th Hussars. He was known by the courtesy title Viscount Chichester from birth until 1799 and as Earl of Belfast from 1799 to 1844.

==Political career==
In 1818, Lord Belfast (as he was from 1799 until 1844) was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Carrickfergus, and two years later became representative for Belfast. In July 1830 he was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Household in the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Tory administration. In August he was returned to Parliament for Antrim. He continued as Vice-Chamberlain after Lord Grey formed his Whig government in November 1830. In 1831 he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order. He remained as Vice-Chamberlain until 1834, the last months under the premiership of Lord Melbourne. In 1837 he was once again returned to Parliament for Belfast. He did not initially serve in Melbourne&#x27;s second administration, but in 1838 he once again became Vice-Chamberlain of the Household. He resigned when the government fell in 1841, and during the same year he unsuccessfully contested Belfast as a Liberal candidate. He was instead raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom in his own right as Baron Ennishowen and Carrickfergus, of Ennishowen in the County of Donegal and of Carrickfergus in the County of Antrim. He sat in the House of Lords at Westminster for three years under this title before succeeding his father in the marquessate in 1844.

Lord Donegall did not serve initially in Lord John Russell&#x27;s first administration, but in 1848 he returned to the government as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard. He resigned along with the rest of the Whig government in early 1852. Apart from his political career he was also Lord Lieutenant of Antrim from 1841 to 1883. In 1857 he was made a Knight of the Order of St Patrick. At the time of his death in 1883 he was the senior member of the Privy Council.

==Family==
Lord Donegall married Lady Harriet Anne Butler (d. 1860), daughter of the 1st Earl of Glengall, in 1822. They had three children:

*Lady Harriet Augusta Anna Seymourina Chichester (d. 14 April 1898); married the 8th Earl of Shaftesbury.
*George Augustus Chichester, Viscount Chichester (26 May 1826 – 18 June 1827)
*Frederick Richard Chichester, Earl of Belfast (25 November 1827 – 11 February 1853); died in Naples, unmarried.

After his first wife&#x27;s death in September 1860, he married as his second wife Harriett Graham (d. 1884), daughter of Sir Bellingham Reginald Graham, 7th Baronet, and widow of Sir Frederick Ashworth, in 1862. There were no children from this marriage. Lord Donegall died in Brighton, Sussex, in October 1883, aged 86, and was buried in Belfast. 

As both his sons had predeceased him, the larger part of the Donegall estates was inherited by his only daughter, Harriet Ashley-Cooper, Lady Ashley (later Countess of Shaftesbury and previously Lady Harriet Augusta Anna Seymourina Chichester), wife of the 8th Earl of Shaftesbury. 

He owned 23,000 acres, mostly in Donegal and Antrim.

The Ennishowen and Carrickfergus barony died with him, while he was succeeded in his other peerages by his younger brother, Lord Edward Chichester. The Marchioness of Donegall died in March 1884.

<text>Arena is a British television documentary series, made and broadcast by the BBC since 1 October 1975. Voted by TV executives in &quot;Broadcast&quot; magazine as one of the top 50 most influential programmes of all time, it has produced more than six hundred episodes directed by, among others, Frederick Baker, Jana Boková, Jonathan Demme, Nigel Finch, Mary Harron, Vikram Jayanti, Vivian Kubrick, Paul Lee, Adam Low, Bernard MacMahon, James Marsh, Leslie Megahey, Volker Schlondorff, Martin Scorsese, Julien Temple, Anthony Wall, Leslie Woodhead, and Alan Yentob.

==History==

The arts strand &quot;Arena&quot; was initially created in 1975 by the BBC Head of Music &amp; Arts at that time, Humphrey Burton, when he founded a magazine named &quot;Arena&quot; exploring art, design, filmmaking, and theatre. In 1977, under producer and director Leslie Megahey, the strand divided into &quot;Arena Theatre&quot; and &quot;Arena Art and Design&quot;, and &quot;Arena&quot; became less of a magazine and more a home for short, distinctive and stylish films about mainly British theatre and visual arts. In 1978, Megahey became editor of &quot;Omnibus&quot; and Alan Yentob, who had been supervising &quot;Arena Theatre&quot;, took over and the two themes were merged. The series, relaunched in January 1979 and renamed simply &quot;Arena&quot;, began to adopt a format of single subject essays. It earned great critical acclaim for its enthusiasm for the popular as well as the high arts. During Yentob&#x27;s time as editor, &quot;Arena&quot; had six BAFTA nominations and three BAFTA awards.

A group of radical directors, notably Nigel Finch and Anthony Wall, gathered around Yentob and &quot;Arena&quot;, including Nigel Williams and Mary Dickinson. Hits from 1979 included &quot;Who Is Poly Styrene?&quot;, &quot;La Dame Aux Gladiolas&quot;, a portrait of Edna Everage, and most notably the groundbreaking &quot;My Way&quot;, an examination of the appeal of the song, by Finch and Wall. It was the first of their collaborations, which developed a new kind of arts film, taking an unlikely subject and building a poetic meditation on its various aspects - further examples include &quot;The Chelsea Hotel&quot; (1981), &quot;The Private Life of the Ford Cortina&quot; (1982), &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; (1982). Other successes included Megahey&#x27;s portrait of Orson Welles (1982), Williams&#x27;s study of George Orwell (1982), Yentob&#x27;s portrait of Mel Brooks (1981) and Wall&#x27;s four-part documentary on Slim Gaillard (1989).

On Yentob&#x27;s move to become Head of Music &amp; Arts in 1985, Finch and Wall took over as joint editors of &quot;Arena&quot; until Finch&#x27;s death in 1995. Following a period of uncertainty concerning the future of the arts strand, series editor Wall protected the series in a reshuffle of the BBC. Since then &quot;Arena&quot; has been transmitted outside the conventional weekly broadcast strand on BBC Two and BBC Four, and latterly on BBC Four.

Under Wall and Finch, &quot;Arena&quot; developed the idea of the themed evening, beginning with &quot;Blues Night&quot; (1985), followed by &quot;Caribbean Nights&quot; (1986), &quot;Animal Night&quot; (1989), &quot;Food Night&quot; (1990), &quot;Texas Saturday Night&quot; (1991), &quot;Radio Night&quot; simulcast with BBC Radio 4 (1993) and &quot;Stories My Country Told Me&quot; (1995), a three-and-a-half-hour presentation on Nations and Nationalism. Since then &quot;Arena&quot; has won numerous awards with regular screenings at the BFI Southbank and has continued to cover the arts and culture at the highest level, with films on Bob Dylan, Harold Pinter, The National Theatre and &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, to name but a few.

&quot;Arena&quot; developed a substantial online presence featuring the &quot;Arena Hotel&quot;, a site that turns the 600-film &quot;Arena&quot; archive into a resource to build an online hotel for the stars. The &quot;Arena Hotel&quot; was nominated for a Focal International Award in 2013. Werner Herzog has praised the series as &quot;the oasis in the sea of insanity that is television&quot;.

Wall retired in 2018, and the strand is now overseen by commissioning editor Mark Bell.

==Branding==
The programme&#x27;s theme music is taken from the title track of the 1975 album &quot;Another Green World&quot; by Brian Eno, himself the subject of a 2010 &quot;Arena&quot; film subtitled &quot;Another Green World&quot;.

The &quot;Arena&quot; opening titles were voted among the &quot;Top 5 Most Influential Opening Titles in the History of Television&quot; by &quot;Broadcast&quot; magazine in 2004.

==Series editors==
Anthony Wall edited &quot;Arena&quot; since 1985. He joined the series in 1978 and became one of its leading directors.

==Awards and nominations==
&quot;Arena&quot; has won a Primetime and International Emmys, a Grammy, nine BAFTAs, six Royal Television Society Awards, a Peabody and the Prix Italia. &quot;Arena&quot; also won the Sundance Grand Jury Prize for &quot;Paris Is Burning&quot; (1990), the Best Performance Award for Lili Taylor&#x27;s role in &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot; (1996) at the Sundance Film Festival, and the SFFIF&#x27;s Mel Novikoff Award.

<text>Ragged Mountain is a ski resort located on the northern side of Ragged Mountain in Danbury, New Hampshire, in the United States, with a vertical drop of and spread across . Offering three terrain parks and many glades, the resort is home to the first six-person chairlift in New Hampshire.

== History ==
Ragged Mountain Ski Area opened in 1965, sporting seven runs, a T-bar, and a Hall double. Amidst little snowfall and the failure to install snowmaking equipment, the resort went bankrupt in 1974. That year, the state bought the area and immediately sold it to a group of people involved in the ski industry. The area closed during the 1983-84 season.

Real estate developers Al and Walter Endriunas bought the area in a few years later, installed snowmaking and added a new beginner slope, along with another T-bar. Ragged opened once more for the 1988-89 season. They installed two more double lifts in the early 1990s and another trail complex, called Spear Mountain.

In 2002, the area purchased the Summit Six-Pack detachable chairlift, an investment that caused the area to go bankrupt once more. The owners sold Ragged Mountain to RMR-Pacific, LLC, an affiliate of Utah resort developer Pacific Group in 2007. The new owners have invested over $3 million in renovations including lodge renovations, upgrades to the snowmaking capacity, and several new dining options, including a brick oven pizzeria and tavern located in the west lodge.

Ragged Mountain replaced the Spear Mountain triple with a Doppelmayr high speed detachable quad in the summer of 2014. In addition, significant upgrades were made to the Elmwood lodge, which included more seating and two new restaurants. Costs for both these projects amount to over $5 million.

In early 2019, Ragged Mountain Resort created a company-wide Sustainability Program to help foster business practices which are environmentally sustainable. As a part of this initiative, the resort has added a new digital and interactive trail map to their mobile application, launched a resort-wide recycling program, replaced older, less efficient snowmaking equipment with new lower energy alternatives and converted all lighting at the resort to LED Lights.

==Expansion==
Ragged Mountain has plans to develop into a four season destination. Over the past several years, tree cutting has been witnessed on Pinnacle Peak, adjacent to the main Ragged peak. Ragged officials say they plan to add at least 10 new trails and 60 acres of new skiing terrain but as of 2022 the work has not begun. 

In addition to Pinnacle Peak, Ragged has moved forward with plans to renovate the 18 hole golf course, a process that could take up to two years. The course will be diminished to nine holes, in order to accommodate the tubing park, future lodging and ski trails.

<text>A Burnt-Out Case (1960) is a novel by English author Graham Greene, set in a leper colony on the upper reaches of a tributary of the Congo River in Africa.

==Plot summary==

Querry, a famous architect who is fed up with his celebrity, no longer finds meaning in art or pleasure in life. Arriving anonymously in the late 1950s at a Congo leper colony overseen by Catholic missionaries, he is diagnosed – by Dr Colin, the resident doctor who is himself an atheist – as the mental equivalent of a &#x27;burnt-out case&#x27;: a leper who has gone through the stages of mutilation. However, as Querry loses himself in working for the lepers, his disease of mind slowly approaches a cure.

Querry meets Rycker, a palm-oil plantation owner, and a man of apparently earnest Catholic faith who does not accept his own nothingness and tries to amplify the relevance of Querry&#x27;s presence in that country. Rycker&#x27;s wife, a young and ill-educated woman, is absolutely bored with his prudishness and her own lack of freedom.

It is revealed that Querry is a famous architect, known throughout the world for his design and construction of churches – which he himself believes have been defiled by the religious occupants. Querry is persuaded to design and oversee a new building for the hospital.

An English journalist called Parkinson arrives at the village with the intention of writing a series of articles, to be syndicated in many European and North American newspapers, on the subject of Querry&#x27;s perceived &#x27;saintly&#x27; activities in the village, including a story of Querry rescuing his servant – an African mutilated by leprosy- who became lost in the jungle. However Parkinson also brings up Querry&#x27;s past not only as an architect but also as a womaniser. It is revealed that Querry&#x27;s former lover committed suicide, thus prompting his journey to the village (however his journey was not the result of feelings of guilt or grief, but rather the incident acted to magnify his growing loss of faith and vocation.)

When the first article is published and received at the village, Querry becomes angered by his portrayal, not only by Parkinson, but by Rycker whom Parkinson interviewed for the story. Querry travels to the provincial capital and on the way calls in to confront Rycker. Querry learns that Rycker&#x27;s wife fears that she is pregnant and that her husband does not want a child (despite having refused contraception and having effectively forced her into sex numerous times). She tells Querry to ask Rycker for permission to travel to the capital Luc to see a doctor. Following a confrontation between Querry and Rycker, Querry leaves for Luc and takes with him Mrs. Rycker so she may visit the doctor, however neither of the two inform Rycker of her departure. 

In Luc, Querry and Mrs. Rycker take rooms at the hotel. However, before going to sleep, Querry suspects that Mrs. Rycker is crying in the next room. When he investigates she informs him that she was actually laughing at the novel she is reading – one that would be banned at her home with the pious Rycker – and the two share a bottle of whisky. As Mrs. Rycker is going to sleep, Querry tells her a story which closely parallels his story: a man losing both faith and vocation. Despite the intimacy of the moment, the two never become physically involved. 

The following morning Parkinson informs Querry that Rycker has arrived in Luc in pursuit of his wife and, upon discovering his wife&#x27;s diary with an entry stating &quot;Spent the night with Q&quot;, Rycker accuses Querry of having an affair. Querry, after briefly meeting Mrs. Rycker and learning that she is pregnant with Rycker&#x27;s child, leaves Luc and returns to the village, where the construction of the hospital is nearing completion.

Days later Mrs. Rycker arrives at the convent near the village. She tells the sisters and priests that she has been having an affair with Querry and that she is pregnant with his child. When Querry visits her she admits to him in private that she is lying, and agrees that the two have never slept together. Still she says that since she thought of Querry while having sex with Rycker the child is his in the emotional sense (despite Rycker being the biological father). Moreover, she will not admit the truth to anyone else no matter how much Querry might suffer from it, as she wants to make Rycker divorce her. Querry is left with no option but to leave, thinking that he might have finally met someone as ruthlessly selfish as he himself used to be.

Father Thomas, the temporary supervisor of the village, becomes angry at Querry for bringing shame and sin upon the village (as well as damaging his image as saintly – despite strong objections to having such an image from Querry himself). Rycker arrives at the village and demands to see Querry, who has gone to stay in Dr. Colin&#x27;s room for the night. Rycker begins to walk to Dr. Colin&#x27;s stating that a court would never convict him, which troubles the priests – one of whom pursues Rycker to prevent him shooting Querry. Enraged, Rycker confronts Querry. While being accused of adultery, Querry laughs at the absurdity of being confronted the one time he is actually innocent. Rycker misinterprets the laugh as mockery, and shoots Querry dead. 

Querry is buried in the village, while Rycker faces a probable aquittal due to acting in passion and in defence of his honour as a husband. Ms Rycker likewise is assumed to gain her divorce in the end.

==Dedication and literary intentions in novel==
Greene dedicated &quot;A Burnt-Out Case&quot; to Docteur Michel Lechat, a medical doctor at a leper colony in Yonda in Africa (one of a number of such colonies Greene had visited in the Congo and the Cameroons, which had inspired his novel). In his dedication to Lechat, Greene writes: &quot;Doctor Colin has borrowed from you his experience of leprosy and nothing else. Doctor Colin&#x27;s leproserie is not your leproserie... From the fathers of your Mission I have stolen the Superior&#x27;s cheroots--that is all, and from your Bishop the boat that he was so generous as to lend me for a journey up the Ruki.&quot;

In reference to the characters in the novel, Greene writes: &quot;It would be a waste of time for anyone to try to identify Querry, the Ryckers, Parkinson, Father Thomas--they are formed from the flotsam of thirty years as a novelist.&quot;

Commenting on his literary intentions in the work, Greene wrote that it was, &quot;an attempt to give dramatic expression to various types of belief, half-belief, and non-belief, in the kind of setting, removed from world-politics and house-hold-preoccupations, where such differences are felt acutely and find expression.&quot; Drawing a comparison between a leper-colony doctor&#x27;s work and that of a novelist, Greene adds: &quot;A doctor is not immune from &#x27;the long despair of doing nothing well&quot;, the same &quot;&quot;cafard&quot; that hangs around a writer&#x27;s life&quot;.

<text>The Etowah River is a waterway that rises northwest of Dahlonega, Georgia, north of Atlanta. On Matthew Carey&#x27;s 1795 map the river was labeled &quot;High Town River&quot;. On later maps, such as the 1839 Cass County map (Cass being the original name for Bartow County), it was referred to as &quot;Hightower River&quot;, a name that was used in most early Cherokee records.

The large Amicalola Creek (which flows over Amicalola Falls) is a primary tributary near the beginning of the river. The Etowah then flows west-southwest through Canton, Georgia, and soon forms Lake Allatoona. From the dam at the lake, it passes Cartersville and the Etowah Indian Mounds archaeological site. It then flows to Rome, Georgia, where it meets the Oostanaula River and forms the Coosa River at their confluence. The river is the northernmost portion of the Etowah-Coosa-Alabama-Mobile Waterway, stretching from the mountains of north Georgia to Mobile Bay in Alabama.

The Little River is the largest tributary of the Etowah, their confluence now flooded by Lake Allatoona. Allatoona Creek is another major tributary, flowing north from Cobb County and forming the other major arm of the lake.

The U.S. Board on Geographic Names officially named the river in 1897.

The river ends at above mean sea level.

The river is home to the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter, which are listed on the Endangered Species List.

Country singer-songwriter Jerry Reed made the Etowah the home of the wild, misunderstood swamp dweller Ko-Ko Joe in the 1971 song &quot;Ko-Ko Joe&quot;. The fictional character, who is reviled by respectable people but apparently dies a hero while saving a child&#x27;s life, is alternately known as the &quot;Etowah River Swamp Rat&quot; in the song. Reed, a native of Atlanta, took some liberties with Georgia geography in the song, including the non-existent &quot;Appaloosa County&quot; and &quot;Ko-Ko Ridge&quot; as part of the song narrative’s setting.

<doc id="867430" wikidata="Q1025927" url="?curid=867430" title="Cairn Gorm">
<text>Cairn Gorm () is a mountain in the Scottish Highlands. It is part of the Cairngorms range and wider Grampian Mountains. With a summit elevation of above sea level, Cairn Gorm is classed as a Munro and is the sixth-highest mountain in the British Isles. The high, broad domed summit overlooking Strathspey is one of the most readily identifiable mountains from the nearby town and regional centre of Aviemore. Although it shares its name with the Cairngorm mountains, Ben Macdui is the highest mountain in the range.

The highest winds in the UK were in 1986 when a 173 mph (278 km/h) gust was recorded at Cairn Gorm.

Since the 1960s over of the north-western slopes of the mountain in and have been developed for alpine skiing. The ski lift infrastructure includes a funicular railway in Coire Cas. The corrie south of Coire Cas, , is separated from the ski area by a ridge known as . The southern slopes of Cairn Gorm overlook the remote Loch Avon (pronounced Loch A&#x27;an).

==Etymology==

The mountain shares its name with the wider Cairngorms mountain range and the Cairngorms National Park of which it is a part. Despite this it is neither the highest nor the most prominent mountain in the range. The Cairngorms mountain range was historically known as , a Scottish Gaelic name meaning The Red Hills. The Scottish Gaelic means &quot;blue&quot; in English; but when describing vegetation can mean &quot;green&quot; or &quot;greening&quot;, so Cairn Gorm can mean either Blue Cairn or Green Cairn.

==Climate==

Cairn Gorm has a tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;). There is an automated weather station (AWS) controlled by Heriot-Watt University on the summit of the mountain providing temperature and wind speed data. There is also a separate AWS run by the Met Office (synop code 03065) that publishes temperature and frost data. Cairn Gorm averages 194.4 frost days per annum, making it the coldest weather station in the United Kingdom. Winter low temperatures are not extreme when compared with some other UK stations, but the severity of the climate is illustrated by its cool summers.

The highest temperature since 1985 is , recorded on 23 May 1989. The coldest temperature is on 6 March 2007. Daytime temperatures staying below all day occur most frequently between October and May but have been observed during every month of the year. Daytime maximum temperatures below and night-time temperature above are uncommon. The lowest daytime maximum was on 28 February 2018.
The Foehn wind can affect the mountain, particularly during late autumn and winter. This phenomenon presumably resulted in the November record high.

The warmest month on record is July 2006, with a mean temperature of . Conversely, the coldest month on record is March 2013, with a mean temperature of .

Cairn Gorm is notable for having the highest ever recorded wind speed in the UK on land. A wind gust of was recorded on 20 March 1986. A wind gust of was recorded at Cairn Gorm on 19 December 2008 but was discovered too late to be verified by the Met Office.

==Hiking and climbing==
In clear, calm weather, the ascent of Cairn Gorm is a straightforward hike via the alpine ski area on the northern slopes. But when the mountain is stormbound, particularly in winter during blizzard and high avalanche risk conditions, any ascent or descent can be potentially lethal - particularly during &quot;white-outs&quot; when it is easy to lose one&#x27;s bearings near the barren, featureless summit which is ringed in many directions by precipitous drops. In common with all the highest Cairngorm summits, ascents during winter conditions (which can and usually do extend well into springtime) will often require good navigation skills and winter climbing equipment such as crampons and ice-axes. The &quot;Windy Ridge&quot; path on &quot;Sròn an Aonaich&quot; lying to the northeast of Coire Cas is a steep and direct route, and is generally recommended by local Rangers, guides and guidebooks. Another route to the summit is the access road up the centre of Coire Cas, however this route is a track used by the railway operator&#x27;s vehicles, and gives an indirect route with several steep sections. It is not recommended as an ascent route, especially during the skiing season, though it gives good views of the Cairngorm Mountain Railway in its lower sections. Also in Coire Cas, &quot;Fiacaill a&#x27; Choire Chais&quot; offers a good walking route to Cairn Gorm and the adjacent plateau. A circuit of the cliff tops overlooking the Northern Corries of Cairn Gorm is highly recommended in many guide books and publications, giving one of the finest views in Scotland. Walkers are advised to consult the local map and call in at the Ranger Base at the car park.

There are many climbing routes at the head of Coire an t-Sneachda and Coire an Lochain, and in winter these corries form one of Scotland&#x27;s major ice climbing areas.

===1971 disaster===

On 21–22 November 1971, five pupils from Ainslie Park High School in Edinburgh and a trainee instructor from Newcastle-under-Lyme died in a blizzard at Feith Buidhe on the Cairn Gorm plateau. It stands as the UK&#x27;s worst mountaineering disaster.

==Wildlife==

The mountain is home to a number of bird species, including dotterel and ring ouzel (in the spring and summer) and snow bunting and ptarmigan (also known as rock ptarmigan) (all year round). Mammals inhabiting the mountain include mountain hare, red deer and a herd of reindeer. Wildflowers found on the mountain include dwarf cornel, cloudberry and butterwort. For many of these species of flora and fauna, Cairn Gorm is one of their key strongholds.

== Cairngorm Mountain alpine ski area ==

===History===
The alpine ski area was developed on Cairn Gorm from 1960 onwards. A chairlift and chalet opened in December 1961. In the summer of 1968 a new half mile of road was built that improved access for skiing in the Coire-na-Ciste area. It is the second largest in Scotland (after Glenshee). By the 1980s, thousands of skiers were using the slopes on busy weekends, which could often become very crowded.

By the 2000s, the number of skiers at Cairngorm and Scotland&#x27;s other ski areas had dropped, partly as a consequence of budget airline travel making access to the Alps more attractive.

Snow conditions in the Scottish Highlands are unpredictable and Global Warming has emerged as a potential threat to the viability of the Scottish ski industry. In 2004, Adam Watson predicted that there would be no more than twenty years left for the industry. However recent winters have had excellent snow cover and ski conditions and winter sports usage has recovered significantly resulting in improved finances. In 2011–12 the resort trialled a TechnoAlpin T40 snow cannon, and in 2012–13 three more were leased. A larger TF10 cannon was added for the 2013–14 season

In April 2014 Natural Retreats was chosen by HIE as the new operator of Cairngorm Mountain Ltd.

===Funicular controversy===
By 1990, much of the original infrastructure was ageing and proving increasingly difficult to maintain. The chairlifts and tows were susceptible to the high winds to which the mountain is prone, and were frequently forced to shut in winds above 25 mph (40 km/h). The operators, Cairngorm Chairlift Company, proposed removing the chairlift and replacing it with a funicular railway.

There was strong opposition to the funicular from environmental groups, who were concerned about damage to the mountain and its fragile soils and plants. The eventual compromise reached, after negotiations with Scottish Natural Heritage, allowed the Cairngorm Mountain Railway to be built, but with restrictions on its usage. Only those engaging in snow sports, or spectating, are allowed to exit from the top station. Other funicular users can visit the restaurant and visitor centre, but are currently restricted from leaving the building to start a walk. However, there are groups campaigning to remove this restriction.

Controversy mired the building project, with budget over-runs, allegations of conflicts of interest by those connected to both Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the construction company and questions raised about the use of public money. The construction was estimated to have cost around £19.6 million, mostly funded by Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), a government body. £2.7 million was provided by the European Union.

The funicular opened in December 2001. The railway provides access from the ski centre&#x27;s day lodge base station at up the Coire Cas to the ski centre&#x27;s Ptarmigan building at AMSL, a total distance of 6,460 ft (1.97 km). Thie Ptarmigan station is the highest elevation train terminal in the British Isles. 
== Cairn Gorm Locomotive ==
A locomotive operated by Caledonian Sleeper, a train operator that offers sleeper trains from London Euston to Scotland. The locomotive is the only Class 67 locomotive to be operated by Caledonian Sleeper. The locomotive is the subject of a Hornby model with TTS Sound in OO gauge.

<text>London Scottish Football Club is a rugby union club in England. The club is a member of both the Rugby Football Union and the Scottish Rugby Union. The club is currently playing in the RFU Championship and share the Athletic Ground with Richmond.

==History==
===Founding (1878)===
In early 1878, three Scottish members of a team called St. Andrew&#x27;s Rovers FC decided to break away to form their own club for Scots. These men, George Grant, Neil Macglashan and Robert Arnot attracted a number of responses to a circular they sent out. The London Scottish Regiment in particular were very warm to the idea. Very soon after, on 10 April 1878, London Scottish FC was founded in The Queen&#x27;s Head, in Water Lane, Blackfriars, London (universally known as MacKay&#x27;s Tavern, frequently mis-recorded, as Ned Mackay the jovial Scottish landlord ran the pub), initially played on Blackheath Common, and later at Richmond Athletic Ground in Surrey.

They had a sizable fixture list and played some of the leading clubs of the time immediately, such as Ravenscourt Park Football Club and Queen&#x27;s House Football Club (the latter being the only London team to have never lost to London Scottish). They also played St Andrew&#x27;s Rovers that season. St Andrew&#x27;s, who had lost the core of their best players, lost twice to London Scottish and folded at the end of the season. London Scottish had a very successful first season, and having played 15 matches they only lost four (against already well established sides, Flamingoes, Guy&#x27;s Hospital, Queen&#x27;s House and Wasps).

In 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War all sixty members of the four London Scottish teams who played in their last matches in April enlisted. Fifteen survived. Only one played Rugby again. They are commemorated in Mick Imlah&#x27;s poem &quot;London Scottish&quot;.

===Early history===

London Scottish was the first of the &quot;Exiles&quot; rugby clubs to be founded, and the last of the main three – after London Irish and London Welsh – to go &quot;open&quot; in 1996.

London Scottish made the John Player Cup Final in 1974, where they lost 26–6 against defending champions Coventry.

The club regularly featured at the Middlesex Sevens tournament, winning the trophy in 1937, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1965 and 1991. They have won the Melrose Sevens three times, in 1962, 1965 and 2019.

=== Professional era (1996–2020) ===
Scottish turned professional in 1996. Tony Tiarks bought the club for £500,000 in 1996.

In the summer of 1998 Scottish, co-tenants of Richmond at the Athletic Ground, were promoted to the top division via a play-off, and Tiarks forced through an ill-fated groundshare with Harlequins and London Broncos at the Stoop Memorial Ground.

In the 1998–99 season, Scottish made their only appearance in the English Premiership. Under coach John Steele, and despite limited resources, the team finished 12th out of 14 teams, which would have saved them from relegation had they not fallen into administration at the season&#x27;s end. Notable wins that season included: versus Bath (13–11), Saracens (24–7) and Newcastle Falcons (27–17). That season&#x27;s squad included Scottish international stars Ronnie Eriksson, Simon Holmes and Derrick Lee, Australians Seán Childs, Simon Fenn and Eddie Jones, and the South African Jannie de Beer.

Midway through the 1998–1999 season, Tiarks became disillusioned and discussed selling Scottish&#x27;s place in the Premiership to second-division Bristol. He bailed out in the summer of 1999. The professional club London Scottish Rugby was placed into administration in 1999 and nominally merged into London Irish (who moved their games to the Stoop) along with Richmond, who were also placed into administration.

The original amateur club rejoined the RFU leagues at the bottom of the pyramid after effectively having been relegated nine divisions by the RFU. The club progressed back up through seven divisions in 10 seasons to RFU Championship for the 2011–12 season.

The club was promoted to the English National leagues (National Division Three South) for the 2007–08 season after an eight-year absence. The club was unbeaten in the 2008–09 season, earning promotion to the revamped RFU National 1 Division for the 2009–10 season. In 2009–10, the club finished second in their first season in RFU National 1 Division.

The club secured promotion to the RFU Championship for the 2011–12 season. During the 2012–13 season, the club made the switch to a full-time professional set-up, with many of the club&#x27;s part-time professional players leaving and new coaches brought on board, this included former Leicester Tigers hooker James Buckland and France and London Wasps legend Serge Betsen. The fully professional set-up was credited for an impressive performance away to Championship leaders Newcastle Falcons, where three penalties brought them to the brink of a shock win, but they lost 12–9. There followed significant wins in the second half of the season, including a 26–23 victory over Bedford Blues, a 25–13 win over Nottingham and a 20–17 win away at Cornish Pirates. Scottish were still challenging for a place in the top four of the Championship until as late as March, when they were beaten by Leeds Carnegie, and they ended the season in mid-table.

The Scottish again finished mid-table in the Championship in the 2013–14 season. The team had four players named in the Championship Best XV – American international Eric Fry, Tomas Francis, Mark Bright and Championship top try-scorer Miles Mantella.

Following a mediocre 2016–17 campaign, the club appointed Loughborough Students director of rugby Dave Morris as director of rugby and the club saw a change at the top, with Malcom Offord becoming chairman of the club and Carson Russell as CEO.

===Semi-professional club (2021–)===
Following a reduction in funding from the RFU, Scottish adopted a semi-professional model from the 2020–21 season, with players and coaches being employed part-time. Following this, in February 2021 it was confirmed that due to funding cuts and the costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic Scottish would not take part in the upcoming season.

Scottish were to leave the Athletic Ground after 127 years, with the first team temporarily relocating to Esher&#x27;s rugby ground in Hersham and the rest of the club also seeking relocation. However it was later confirmed they would remain at the Athletic Ground for their return to the Championship in the 2021–22 season.

===Sevens===
London Scottish have been great exponents of rugby sevens, winning the Melrose Sevens three times, Middlesex Sevens seven times and the Rosslyn Park London Floodlit Sevens seven times.

<text>Etowah Indian Mounds (9BR1) are a archaeological site in Bartow County, Georgia, south of Cartersville. Built and occupied in three phases, from 1000–1550 CE, the prehistoric site is located on the north shore of the Etowah River. 

Etowah Indian Mounds Historic Site is a designated National Historic Landmark, managed by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. It is considered &quot;the most intact Mississippian culture site in the Southeast&quot;, according to Georgia State Parks and Historic Sites. Both the historic Muscogee Creek and the Cherokee peoples, who each occupied this area at varying times, hold the site to be sacred.

==History==
This site was professionally excavated beginning in the early 20th century. Additional studies have been undertaken as more evidence and knowledge has accumulated about the succession of cultures in this area, aided by modern technology such as radio carbon dating and magnetometers.

Late 20th-century studies showed the mounds were built and occupied by prehistoric indigenous peoples of the South Appalachian Mississippian culture (a regional variation of the Mississippian culture) of eastern North America. They were ancestors of the historic Muskogean language-speaking Muscogee Creek people who later emerged in this area. 

&quot;Etowah&quot; is a Muskogee word derived from &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;town&quot;. From 1000–1550 CE, during the Mississippian culture era, Etowah was occupied by a series of cycling chiefdoms (see Coosa confederacy) over the course of five and a half centuries. The Hernando de Soto expedition encountered a settlement called Itaba between Coosa and Ulibahali, which was likely Etowah. The historic Muscogee Creek formed in this region and occupied this area. They were later pushed out by the Cherokee, who migrated from eastern Georgia and Tennessee to evade European-American pressure.

In the 19th century, European-American settlers mistakenly believed that the mounds had been built by the historic Cherokee, who occupied the region at the time. But many researchers now believe that because the Iroquoian-speaking tribe did not reach this part of Georgia until the late 18th century, they could not have built the mounds. The earthworks have been dated to much earlier periods.

In the 21st century, the federally recognized Muscogee (Creek) Nation, now based in Oklahoma, and the Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama both consider &quot;Italwa&quot; to be their most important ancestral town. The Cherokee also revere it.

===Site chronology===

Tykeon Wilkes used changes in ceramic styles across multiple sites in the Etowah River Valley to determine timelines for the region. The ceramics found at Etowah and other regional sites have been reconstructed and allow Etowah to be placed into the following sequences. The town was occupied in three distinct archaeological phases: CE, CE, and CE. It was at its peak from CE.
==Site description==

Etowah has three main platform mounds and three lesser mounds. The Temple Mound, Mound A, is high, taller than a six-story building, and covers at its base. In 2005–2008 ground mapping with magnetometers revealed new information and data, showing that the site was much more complex than had previously been believed. 

The study team has identified a total of 140 buildings on the site. In addition, Mound A was found to have had four major structures and a courtyard during the height of the community&#x27;s power. Mound B is high; Mound C, which rises , is the only one to have been completely excavated. Magnetometers enabled archaeologists to determine the location of temples of log and thatch, which were originally built on the summits of the mounds. Adjacent to the mounds is a raised, level, ceremonial plaza, which was constructed to be used for ceremonies, stickball and chunkey games, and as a bazaar for trade goods.

When visiting the Etowah Mounds, guests can view the &quot;borrow pits&quot; (which archaeologists at one time thought were moats), where workers dug earth to construct the three large mounds in the center of the park.

Older pottery found on the site suggest that there was an earlier village ( BCE–600 CE) associated with the Swift Creek culture. This earlier Middle Woodland period occupation at Etowah may have been related to the major Swift Creek center of Leake Mounds, approximately two miles downstream (west) of Etowah.

War was commonplace; many archaeologists believe the people of Etowah battled for hegemony over the Alabama River basin with those of Moundville, a Mississippian site in present-day Alabama. The town was protected by a sophisticated semicircular fortification system. An outer band formed by nut tree orchards prevented enemy armies from shooting masses of flaming arrows into the town. A to -deep moat blocked direct contact by the enemy with the palisaded walls. It also functioned as a drainage system during major floods, common for centuries, from this period and into the 20th century. Workers formed the palisade by setting upright high logs into a ditch approximately on center. They back-filled around the timbers to form a levee. Guard towers for archers were spaced approximately apart.

===Artifacts===

The artifacts discovered in burials within the Etowah site indicate that its residents developed an artistically and technically advanced culture. Numerous copper tools, weapons and ornamental copper plates accompanied the burials of members of Etowah&#x27;s elite class. Where proximity to copper protected textile fibers from degeneration, archaeologists also found brightly colored cloth with ornate patterns. These were the remnants of the clothing of social elites.

Numerous clay figurines and ten Mississippian stone statues have been found through the years in the vicinity of Etowah. Many are paired statues, which portray a man sitting cross-legged and a woman kneeling. The female figures wear wrap-around skirts and males are usually portrayed without visible clothing, although both usually have elaborate hairstyles. The pair are thought to represent lineage ancestors. Individual statues of young women also show them kneeling, but with additional characteristics such as visible sex organs, which are not visible on the paired statues. This female figure is thought to represent a fertility or Earth Mother goddess. The birdman, hand in eye, solar cross, and other symbols associated with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex appear in many artifacts found at Etowah.

===Trade===
The Etowah River is a tributary of the Coosa and Alabama rivers, and forms the border between the southern edge of the Ridge and Valley Appalachians and the Piedmont Plateau. Trade and tribute brought whelk shells from the Gulf of Mexico; copper, mica and flint from the Cumberland Plateau; and &quot;galena, graphite, and an array of ochers to provide pigment for painting buildings, bodies, and works of art; greenstone and marble to furnish raw material for tools, weapons and ritual objects&quot; from the Piedmont. The loamy riverbed soil could be easily tilled with digging sticks and stone and shell hoes. Its fertility was annually renewed by the river&#x27;s floods. Free of frost most of the year, the land yielded rich harvests of corn, beans, and squash, traditional crops of the indigenous peoples.

===Habitat===
Chestnut, walnut, hickory, and persimmon trees that grew in upland forests provided nuts and fruit for both the people of Etowah and the white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and smaller game they hunted. Other plants that were gathered include stinging nettle and paper mulberry. A native holly was gathered whose leaves and stems were brewed into the Black drink imbibed in ritual purification ceremonies. River cane grew in dense thickets and was made into arrow shafts, thatching for roofs, and splits for weaving baskets, benches, and mats for walls and floors.

River shoals abounded in freshwater mussels and turtles. The Mississippians built v-shaped rock weirs to pen and channel catfish, drum and gar, which they caught in rivercane baskets. Researchers have found remains of more than 100 rock weirs along the Etowah River. One has been restored within the grounds of the historic site.

==Post-contact==
Archaeological research on the subject is not conclusive, but the Etowah site may be the same as a village of a similar name visited by Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto in 1540. The chroniclers of the de Soto Expedition made no mention of any large mounds in their record of visiting a town named &quot;Itaba&quot;, though historian Dr. Marvin T. Smith suggests that the mounds which were likely overgrown and unmaintained by the time of the expedition may simply not have attracted the attention of Spanish explorers. &quot;Itaba&quot; means &quot;boundary&quot; or trail crossing in the Alabama language. The English name for the mounds, &quot;Etowah&quot;, was derived from an archaic Muscogee place name, &quot;Italwa&quot;. &quot;Italwa&quot; probably originally referred to the solar cross symbol. In the modern Muskogee language it means &quot;town.&quot;

Until studies of the late 20th century were published, most European-American people in Georgia believed Etowah to have been built by the well-known historic Cherokee. But, the Cherokee did not arrive in this part of Georgia until the late 18th century, two to seven centuries after the mounds were constructed. Most scholars believe that the mound complex was likely built by people of the South Appalachian Mississippian culture. They are considered ancestral to the historic Muscogee, long known as the Creek people. Most of the peoples of the Creek Confederacy were removed to Indian Territory in the 1830s.

Since that time, the Creek descendants have formed two federally recognized tribes: the largest is the Muscogee (Creek) Nation in Oklahoma; the Poarch Band of Creek Indians in Alabama is the only federally recognized tribe in the state. Both consider &quot;Italwa&quot;, or Etowah, to be their most important ancestral town. The official title of the Creek Nation&#x27;s Principal Chief is &quot;Italwa Mikko&quot; (the Muskogee word for chief is &quot;miko&quot;). A new, large-scale model of Italwa is on permanent display in the rotunda of the Muskogee (Creek) Capitol in Okmulgee, Oklahoma.

==History of excavation and studies==
Missionary Elias Cornelius visited the site in 1817 and described it in his journal published by Bela Bates Edwards in 1833. He realized a mound must have been over two hundred years old, due to the size of trees growing on it, but had little idea of its real history. Cyrus Thomas and John P. Rogan tested the site in 1883 for the Smithsonian Institution, which was conducting a survey of recognized mound sites. 

The first well-documented archaeological inquiry at the site did not begin until the winter of 1925, conducted by Warren K. Moorehead. His excavations into Mound C at the site revealed a rich array of Mississippian culture burial goods. These artifacts, along with the collections from Cahokia, Moundville site, Lake Jackson Mounds, and Spiro Mounds, would comprise the majority of the materials which archaeologists used to define the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC). The professional excavation of this enormous burial mound contributed major research impetus to the study of Mississippian artifacts and peoples. It greatly increased the understanding of pre-Contact Native American artwork.

Arthur R. Kelly, founding chairman of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Georgia, also conducted professional excavations and studies at Etowah Mounds, prior to planned flood control projects in the area. In 1947, the government built the Allatoona Dam upstream for flood control. The Etowah site was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1964.

The Etowah Indian Mounds museum displays artifacts found at the site, including Mississippian culture pottery, monolithic stone axes, Mississippian stone statuary, copper jewelry, shell gorgets, and other artifacts.

<text>Jacob Merritt Howard (July 10, 1805 – April 2, 1871) was an American attorney and politician. He was most notable for his service as a U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator from the state of Michigan, and his political career spanned the American Civil War.

Howard was a native of Shaftsbury, Vermont, and attended schools in southern Vermont before attending Williams College, from which he graduated in 1830. He studied law, moved to Detroit in 1832, and attained admission to the bar in 1833. Howard practiced in Detroit and became active in politics, first as a Whig, and later as a Republican. Among the offices he held were city attorney (1834) and member of the Michigan House of Representatives (1838). In 1840 he was elected to the U.S. House, and he served one term, 1841 to 1843. In 1854 he was one of the founders of the Republican Party, and he served as Michigan Attorney General from 1855 to 1861.

After Senator Kinsley S. Bingham died in 1861, Howard was elected to fill the vacancy, taking office in January 1862. He was elected to a full term in 1865, and served until March 1871. From 1863 to 1871, Howard was chairman of the Senate&#x27;s Committee on Pacific Railroads.

Howard died April 2, 1871, a month after the expiration of his final Senate term. He was buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit.

==Early life==
Howard was born in Shaftsbury, Vermont, on July 10, 1805, the son of farmer Otis Howard and Mary &quot;Polly&quot; Millington. He attended the district schools and the academies of Bennington and Brattleboro. Howard graduated from Williams College in 1830 and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He then studied law with attorney Homer Bartlett of Ware, Massachusetts. He moved to Detroit, Michigan, in 1832, completed his legal studies with Charles Larned, was admitted to the bar in 1833 and commenced practice in Detroit.

==Start of career==
He was city attorney of Detroit in 1834 and joined the unofficial militia Governor Stevens T. Mason formed for the Toledo War in 1835–1836. Howard was a member of the Michigan House of Representatives in 1838.

Howard was elected as a Whig to the US House of Representatives for the 27th Congress, serving from March 4, 1841, to March 3, 1843. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1842, and resumed practicing law in Detroit. Howard became identified with the anti-slavery wing of the Whig Party, and campaigned for presidential nominees Henry Clay (1844), Zachary Taylor (1848), and Winfield Scott (1852).

Convinced after the 1852 election that the Whig Party was no longer a viable organization for abolitionists, he helped draw up the platform of the first Republican Party convention, held in Jackson, Michigan, in 1854. According to several sources, it was Howard who chose the name &quot;Republican&quot; for the new party. Howard was the first Republican nominee for Michigan Attorney General. He was elected and served from 1855 to 1861.

Howard was widely read in the classics, history, law, and literature, and published the memoirs of the Empress Joséphine after translating them from the original French.

==U.S. Senator==
Howard was elected as a Republican to the US Senate in 1861 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Kinsley S. Bingham. In November 1861, Abraham Lincoln nominated him to serve as Minister to Honduras, but he declined so he could continue to serve in the Senate. He was re-elected in 1865 and served from January 1862 to March 1871. He was chairman of the Committee on Pacific Railroads in the 38th through 41st congresses. In addition, he was an active member of the Judiciary, Military Affairs and Private Land Claims Committees.

As a Senator, he was the chief sponsor of the False Claims Act, the &quot;Lincoln Law&quot;, which permitted whistleblowers to file qui tam lawsuits against government contractors for fraud, with the incentive of receiving a monetary reward based on the recovery made by the federal government. Howard justified giving rewards to whistleblowers, many of whom had engaged in unethical activities themselves:

I have based the [qui tam provision] upon the old-fashioned idea of holding out a temptation, and &#x27;setting a rogue to catch a rogue,&#x27; which is the safest and most expeditious way I have ever discovered of bringing rogues to justice.

Howard is credited with working closely with Abraham Lincoln in drafting and passing the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery. In the Senate, he also served on the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment.

In the Senate, Howard opposed presidential Reconstruction, arguing that Congress should play the lead role. He authored the final report on President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s removal of Edwin M. Stanton as Secretary of War, which led to Johnson&#x27;s impeachment.

==Speech on the proposed 14th Amendment==
During the debate over the first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Howard argued for including the phrase &quot;and subject to the jurisdiction thereof:&quot;

...[E]very person born within the limits of the United States, and subject to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a citizen of the United States. This will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the United States, but will include every other class of person.

Howard clarified his statement during the original congressional debate over the amendment describing the clause as having the same content, despite different wording, as the earlier Civil Rights Act of 1866, which reads: “all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States”. He said of the exclusion of Native Americans who maintain their tribal ties:

I am not yet prepared to pass a sweeping act of naturalization by which all the Indian savages, wild or tame, belonging to a tribal relation, are to become my fellow-citizens and go to the polls and vote with me.

According to historian Glenn W. LaFantasie of Western Kentucky University, &quot;A good number of his fellow senators supported his view of the citizenship clause.&quot; Senator Reverdy Johnson said in the debate:

Now, all this amendment provides is, that all persons born in the United States and not subject to some foreign Power—for that, no doubt, is the meaning of the committee who have brought the matter before us—shall be considered as citizens of the United States ... If there are to be citizens of the United States entitled everywhere to the character of citizens of the United States, there should be some certain definition of what citizenship is, what has created the character of citizen as between himself and the United States, and the amendment says citizenship may depend upon birth, and I know of no better way to give rise to citizenship than the fact of birth within the territory of the United States, born of parents who at the time were subject to the authority of the United States.

===Later interpretation===
During the first Trump administration&#x27;s debates over immigration policy, Trump supporters including Michael Anton, who advocate for restrictions on immigration, used the quote to claim that Howard did not intend for the amendment to apply to children born in the U.S. of foreign parents.

In response, Ho and Wydra argued that a close reading of Howard&#x27;s statement reveals that he meant one class of persons, the children of ambassadors at posts in the United States at the time their children were born because ambassadors to the U.S. would be foreigners, and since they were not permanent residents, they were aliens. In their view, Howard was describing one class, not three—the children born of ambassadors &quot;and&quot; foreigners &quot;and&quot; aliens.

==Death and burial==
Howard died in Detroit on April 2, 1871, soon after his final Senate term expired. According to published accounts, he overexerted himself while helping take down a tree on the property line between his house and his neighbor&#x27;s, and burst a blood vessel in his brain, which caused his death two days later. He was buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit.

==Family==
In 1835, Howard married Catherine Amelia Shaw (1810–1866) of Ware, Massachusetts. They were the parents of seven children: Edward Wellington, who died at age 3; Catherine Amelia, died at age 5; Mary Elizabeth, the wife of Dr. Joseph S. Hildreth; Colonel Jacob Merritt Jr., a Union Army veteran and businessman in Litchfield, Minnesota; Hamilton Gay, a lawyer in San Francisco; Charles Millington, a mining engineer in Salt Lake City; and Jennie, the wife of Samuel Brady, a grandson of Hugh Brady.

==Honors==
In 1866, Howard received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Williams College. In 1954, a historic marker commemorating Howard&#x27;s career was placed on the lawn of the Baptist church in Shaftsbury, which later became the home of the Shaftsbury Historical Society.

<text>The Ford Modular engine is an overhead camshaft (OHC) V8 and V10 gasoline-powered small block engine family introduced by Ford Motor Company in 1990 for the 1991 model year. The term “modular” applied to the setup of tooling and casting stations in the Windsor and Romeo engine manufacturing plants, not the engine itself. 

The Modular engine family started with the 4.6 L in 1990 for the 1991 model year. The Modular engines are used in various Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles. Modular engines used in Ford trucks were marketed under the Triton name from 1997–2010 while the InTech name was used for a time at Lincoln and Mercury for vehicles equipped with DOHC versions of the engines. The engines were first produced at the Ford Romeo Engine Plant, then additional capacity was added at the Windsor Engine Plant in Windsor, Ontario.

==Origins==
In the early 1980s, then-Ford Motor Company chief operating officer Donald Petersen challenged Ford&#x27;s vice-president of design, Jack Telnack, and his staff to come up with new vehicle designs to replace the boxy styling that had dominated Ford products for years. The result was the adoption of sleeker, more aerodynamic designs like that used for the highly successful Ford Taurus. In the second half of the 1980s, Petersen, then chief executive officer, sought to update Ford&#x27;s decades-old V8 architectures, challenging Ford senior engineer Jim Clarke to develop a new V8 engine that would surpass Ford&#x27;s earlier V8s in every meaningful way, from power and efficiency to emissions performance and smoothness of operation.

Clarke and his engineers studied engine designs from major European and Japanese automakers and sought to develop a technologically advanced, power-dense, dependable, low maintenance V8, with no major service required before of use. 

The initial engine design would implement a 90° vee-angle with a bore and a stroke of , resulting in a displacement and creating a nearly 1:1 bore-to-stroke ratio. This square configuration was chosen primarily for its positive noise, vibration, and harshness characteristics. The engine would utilize features such as a chain-driven, single-overhead camshaft valve train with roller finger followers, a deep-skirt cast-iron block construction and cross-bolted main bearings, all benefiting long-term durability. In the interest of reducing overall engine weight, aluminum-alloy heads would be standard and all major engine accessories would be mounted directly to the block, resulting in a more complex block casting but eliminating the need for heavy mounting brackets. All engines in the family shared a common bore spacing of .

Tight construction tolerances were used in shaping cylinder bores to accommodate narrow piston rings. This improved engine efficiency through reduced friction and oil consumption while also promoting cleaner emissions.

Various single- or dual-overhead camshaft eight- and ten-cylinder engines could be produced. Six-cylinder derivatives were also explored, though never built. In order to accommodate the wide array of engine configurations possible within this architecture, Ford developed a new modular tooling system for producing different engines quickly and efficiently in the same factory. 

Such an approach allowed for significantly faster changeovers when switching from one engine platform to another among the modular engine family. This also allowed for the existing engine plants, and their supporting offsite production facilities, to handle shorter production runs.

By 1987 Ford was fully committed to producing the new Modular V8, having invested $4 billion (~$ in ) in the engine&#x27;s design in addition to retooling the company&#x27;s Romeo, Michigan tractor plant to build the engines. Three years later, in the third quarter of 1990, the first Modular engine, a 4.6 L SOHC V8, would be used in the 1991 model year Lincoln Town Car. In spite of having a smaller displacement, the lighter 4.6 L Modular V8 could generate more power than the Town Car&#x27;s previous overhead valve 5.0 L V8 and accelerate to 1.5 seconds faster, all while delivering better fuel efficiency.

Ford modular engines would go on to become its chief gasoline V8s and V10s.

==4.6 L ==
The displacement 90-degree V8 was offered in 2-valve SOHC, 3-valve SOHC, and 4-valve DOHC versions. The engines were also offered with both aluminum and cast iron blocks, depending on application. The 4.6 L&#x27;s bore and stroke are nearly square at , respectively. Deck height for the 4.6 block is and connecting rod length is center to center, giving the 4.6 L a 1.67:1 rod to stroke ratio. Cylinder bore spacing measures , which is common to all members of the Modular engine family. All Modular V8s, except for the 5.0 L Coyote and 5.2 L Voodoo, utilize the same firing order as the Ford 5.0 L HO and 351 CID V8s (1-3-7-2-6-5-4-8). The 4.6 L engines have been assembled at Romeo Engine Plant in Michigan, and at Windsor Engine Plant and Essex Engine Plant, both located in Windsor, Ontario.

The final 4.6 L engine was produced in May 2014 and installed in a 2014 model year Ford E-Series van.

===2-valve===
The first production Modular engine was the 4.6 L 2-valve SOHC V8 introduced in the 1991 Lincoln Town Car.

The 4.6 L 2V was built at both Romeo Engine Plant and Windsor Engine Plant, which had different designs for cylinder heads (cam caps: interconnected cam &quot;cages&quot; vs. individual caps per cam journal), camshaft sprockets (bolt-on vs. press-on), valve covers (11 bolts vs. 13 bolts), crankshaft (6 bolts vs. 8 bolts) and main bearing caps (2 bolt fasteners with 2 jack screws vs. 2 bolt fasteners with dowel pins).

&quot;Vehicles equipped with the 16-valve SOHC 4.6 L include the following:&quot;

===3-valve===
The 3-valve SOHC 4.6 L with variable camshaft timing (VCT) first appeared in the redesigned 2005 Ford Mustang.

The engines are equipped with an electronic Charge Motion Control Valve (CMCV) system that provides increased air velocity at low engine speeds for improved emissions and low-rpm torque. Cylinder block material varies between aluminum used in the 2005-10 Mustang GT and cast iron used in the truck applications.

The 3-valve SOHC 4.6 L engine was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 2005–2008.

&quot;Vehicles equipped with the 24-valve SOHC VCT 4.6 L include the following:&quot;

===4-valve===

The 4-valve DOHC version of the Modular engine was introduced in the 1993 Lincoln Mark VIII as the 4.6 L &quot;Four-Cam&quot; V8. Lincoln marketed the engine under the name &quot;InTech&quot; after 1995.

The 1993–1998 4-valve engines featured cylinder heads with two intake ports per cylinder (split-port) and variable runner length intake manifolds with either vacuum or electrically activated intake manifold runner controls (IMRC) depending on application. The engine was revised for 1999 with new cylinder heads featuring tumble-style intake ports (one intake port feeding two intake valves), new camshaft profiles, and fixed runner-length intake manifolds. These changes resulted in more power, torque and a broader power-band when compared to the earlier 4-valve engines.

All 4.6 L 4-valve engines featured aluminum engine blocks with 6-bolt main bearing caps, the only exception being the 2003–2004 SVT Cobra which had a 4-bolt main cast iron block. The 1999 and earlier engines featured an aluminum block cast in Italy by Fiat subsidiary Teksid S.p.A. Since 1996, all of the 4.6 L 4-valve engines manufactured for use in the SVT Cobra have been hand-built by SVT technicians at Ford&#x27;s Romeo, Michigan plant.

The 4-valve DOHC 4.6 L engine was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 1996 and 1997.

&quot;Vehicles equipped with the 32-valve DOHC 4.6 L include the following:&quot;

==5.0 L Coyote==
The Coyote V8 was first produced in 2010 for the 2011 model year. It was an evolutionary development of Ford&#x27;s Modular V8, and is assembled in Ford&#x27;s Essex Engine Plant in Windsor, Ontario, using existing Modular tooling.

Ford engineers needed to design a V8, specifically for the Mustang GT, that would compete with the GM 6.2 L LS3 used in the new Chevrolet Camaro, and the new Chrysler 6.4 L HEMI in the Dodge Charger, Dodge Challenger, Chrysler 300 and Jeep Grand Cherokee. Since this engine replaced the already popular 4.6 L and 5.4 L Modular Engines, this engine had to remain close to the same physical size of the outgoing 4.6 L, and share other specifications with it such as bore spacing, deck height, bell housing bolt pattern, etc. in order for the engine to utilize existing Modular production line tooling (the source of the &#x27;Modular&#x27; designation for the engine family). The result was the 5.0 L Coyote, which produced roughly the same amount of power as its competitors, but with a much smaller displacement.

It shares the &#x27;s bore spacing and deck height, while bore diameter and stroke have increased to , respectively. The engine also retains the 4.6 L&#x27;s connecting rod length, which produces a 1.62:1 rod to stroke ratio. The firing order has been changed from that shared by all previous Modular V8s (1-3-7-2-6-5-4-8) to that of the Ford Flathead V8 (1-5-4-8-6-3-7-2). Compression ratio is 11.0:1, and despite having port fuel injection (as opposed to direct injection) the engine can still be run on 87 octane gasoline.

The Coyote features all new 4 valve DOHC cylinder heads that have shifted the camshafts outboard, which allowed for a compact roller finger follower setup with remote hydraulic valve lash adjusters and improved (raised) intake port geometry. The result is an intake port that outflows the Ford GT intake port by 4 percent and the Yates D3 (NASCAR) intake port up to lift, which is the maximum lift of the Coyote&#x27;s intake cams. Engine redline is 7000 rpm.

The Coyote is Ford&#x27;s first implementation of its cam-torque-actuated (CTA) Twin Independent Variable Cam Timing (Ti-VCT) in a V8 engine, which allows the powertrain control module (PCM) to advance and retard intake and exhaust cam timing independently of each other, providing improved power, fuel economy and reduced emissions.

To strengthen the block enough to handle increased output, webbing was extensively used as reinforcement in the casting, rather than increasing the thickness of the walls. The intake plenum was also situated low between the two cylinder banks to meet the height constraint, thus the alternator traditionally placed low and center was moved to the side of the engine.

The Coyote made Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 2011, 2012, and 2018.

=== Boss 302 (Road Runner) variant ===
A higher performance variant of the Coyote, dubbed Road Runner internally by Ford, is produced under the Boss 302 moniker used for the resurrected Boss 302 Mustang for the 2012 model year. The Boss 302 receives CNC ported heads cast in 356 aluminum providing additional airflow and strength, and a higher lift exhaust camshaft profile is used. Valvetrain components were lightened as much as possible, including the use of sodium filled exhaust valves, while strengthened powdered metal rods and forged aluminum pistons were added. Piston-cooling jets were also deleted, which are standard in the 5.0 model. Exterior changes include a high-mount intake plenum (as opposed to the standard engine&#x27;s low-mounted one) with shorter runners to improve high-rpm power. Power is increased from to , and torque drops from to due to the upgrades. The Boss&#x27;s redline is increased to 7500 rpm, but has been verified stable up to 8400.

=== Gen 3 update ===
For 2018, Ford made revisions to the Coyote equipped in the Mustang GT, most notably the addition of high-pressure direct injection (in addition to the existing port injection system), and an increase of the piston bore diameter from . This increase in the bore size, resulting from the adoption of Plasma Wire Arc Transfer cylinder liner technology in place of the more traditional sleeve in the block, brings total displacement up from . Other changes include Gen. 3 specific camshafts, enlarged intake and exhaust valves, an increased compression ratio of 12.0:1, a revised intake manifold, and 7500 rpm redline in the Mustang. With these changes the updated 5.0 L Coyote is rated by Ford at and . The 2019–2020 Bullitt and 2021–2023 Mach 1 models received an uprated version of the Coyote rated at and . The improvement was due to an intake manifold and 87 mm throttle body borrowed from the 5.2 L Voodoo engine as well as a recalibrated powertrain control module.

===Gen 4 update===
In 2023, for the 2024 model year, the Mustang debuted with the 4th generation of the Coyote engine. It produces and in the GT trim level, and with the Active Performance Exhaust option, and and in the Dark Horse trim level. Updates include:

* Revised 4 into 1 exhaust manifold
* Intake manifold with dual 80 mm throttle bodies

The Dark Horse also received:

* Revised camshafts 
* Forged piston rods from the 5.2 L Predator engine

===F-150 variant===
A torque-biased variant of the Coyote is produced as an alternative to the EcoBoost V6 in the F-150 pickup truck. The F-150 5.0 L receives a lower compression ratio (10.5:1), intake camshafts with less duration, cast iron exhaust manifolds, and revised cylinder heads to improve cooling. The intake manifold changed only in color, and height. These changes promote low-end and mid-range power and torque. The engine retains the Coyote&#x27;s forged steel crank and piston-cooling jets but benefits from the addition of an external engine oil cooler similar to the Boss 302&#x27;s. The changes result in the engine&#x27;s peak horsepower dropping to at 5500 rpm, while torque is rated at at 4250 rpm. When the 2015 F-150 was revealed, Ford improved the induction system to pull air from above the grille under the hood (aka Ram Air Effect) as opposed to the fender intake inlet that had been used for all previous Ford Modular Engines. The addition of Ram Air Effect pulled more cool air into the engine in favor for a power increase to at 5750 rpm and at 3850 rpm.

For 2018, numerous revisions were made to the 5.0. Most notably, the adoption of a port and direct fuel injection system, as well as spray-on bore liner, eliminating the need for conventional cast iron cylinder bore liners (changes shared with the 2018 Mustang), and compression ratio is increased to 12.0:1. Power increased to at 5750 rpm, while torque is rated at at 4500 rpm.

===Miami variant===
The Miami was a supercharged variant designed by FPV (a joint -venture by Ford Australia and Prodrive) while the Coyote was still in development. Pre-production engines were shipped to Australia, where they were fitted with Australian-developed superchargers. The blocks and crank were common with the US Coyote engine but the sump, rods, pistons, intake manifold, supercharger, exhaust manifolds, wiring loom and engine control unit were designed and manufactured in Australia. The US Coyote engine had VVT on all 4 cams but the Australian ECU only had enough outputs to control 2 cams, so only the intake cams have VVT. The supercharger uses Eaton rotors in a housing designed by Australian company Harrop Engineering – the same company that provides superchargers to Roush Performance.

Initial variants made , and , . Later versions made , and ultimately (with the addition of an intercooler).

The Miami variant was sold in the Australian Ford Falcon-based FPV GT range and the FGX XR8.
The version was sold in the Falcon FPV Holy Grail.

===Applications===
The engine is gradually replacing the 4.6 L and 5.4 L Modular V8 units in all Ford vehicles. This is the first time that Ford has used the &quot;5.0&quot; designation since the pushrod 5.0 was discontinued and replaced by the 4.6 L Modular unit in the mid-90s.

&quot;Vehicles equipped with the 32-valve DOHC Ti-VCT 5.0 L include the following:&quot;

The Coyote is available as a crate motor from Ford Racing Performance Parts (FRPP) complete with alternator, manifold, and wiring harness in standard configuration. The Boss 302 is also available from FRPP for a premium over the standard 5.0 L.

==5.2 L ==

===Voodoo===
The &quot;Voodoo&quot; is a development of the Coyote engine. The engine was developed specifically for the Shelby GT350 version of the sixth generation Mustang. Bore and stroke are both up from the 5.0 L Coyote at , as is the compression ratio at 12.0:1. The Voodoo makes at 7500 rpm and of torque at 4750 rpm and has a redline of 8250 rpm. In 2016, the engine received a Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines award. Like other modern Ford Performance Mustang engines, the Voodoo is hand-built at Ford&#x27;s Romeo Plant on the Niche Line.

Unlike the Coyote and previous Modular V8s, the Voodoo features a flat plane crankshaft. During development, Ford purchased a Ferrari California, the only other front-engine flat-plane crank V8 car in production at the time, as a benchmark. The Voodoo features a unique Up-Down-Up-Down crank pin configuration, as opposed to the typical Up-Down-Down-Up in inline-4s and other flat-plane V8s. Due to the unique crankpin configuration, the back-to-front firing order of 1-5-4-8-3-7-2-6, is also unique to the Voodoo. This engine was the biggest production flat plane crank V8 by displacement until General Motors introduced the LT6.

The GT350R variant of the engine received a number of valvetrain enhancements, including the timing chains, lash adjusters, and VCT mechanisms.

&quot;Vehicles equipped with the 32-valve DOHC 5.2 L include the following:&quot;

===Aluminator 5.2 XS===
The Aluminator 5.2 XS is another variant of the Coyote engine utilizing the 5.2 L cylinder block from the GT350. The Aluminator is differentiated from the Voodoo engine by a Cobra Jet intake manifold and throttle body and a cross-plane crankshaft. The engine has a claimed output of and . Like the &quot;Voodoo&quot; engine, it also features a 12:1 compression ratio and of displacement.

This engine is sold as a Ford Performance Parts crate engine without a wiring harness, a flywheel, or headers.

===Predator===
The &quot;Predator&quot; is a variant of the &quot;Coyote&quot; engine utilizing a cross-plane crank and a supercharger, which is installed in the Mustang Shelby GT500 starting in 2020 and the Ford F-150 Raptor R starting in late 2022. The engine has an output of and of torque in the Shelby GT500. It makes and in the F-150 Raptor R. Production of this engine for the Shelby GT500 ended on October 18, 2022, marking the end of the Shelby GT500. This was also the last engine to be produced on the Romeo Engine Plant Niche line.

===Carnivore===
Based on the Predator engine, the engine used in the 2023 F-150 Raptor R is tuned for more low-end torque by using a different supercharger pulley and a new calibration. It is produced on a new Niche Engine line at the Dearborn Engine Plant.

==5.4 L==
The V8 is a member of the Modular engine family first introduced in the 1997 F-series pick-ups, in place of the 5.8 L 351W. Bore diameter is and stroke is , the increased stroke necessitated a taller engine block deck height. A connecting rod length is used to achieve a 1.60:1 rod to stroke ratio. The 5.4 L 2V was built at the Windsor Engine Plant, while the 5.4 L 3V moved production to the Essex Engine Plant beginning in 2003, then back to Windsor Engine Plant in 2009. The SVT 5.4 L 4-valve engines are built at Romeo Engine Plant, hand assembled on the niche line.

===2-valve===
Introduced in 1997, the SOHC 2-valve 5.4 L has a cast iron engine block and aluminum cylinder heads. The 5.4 L features multi-port fuel injection, roller finger followers, fracture-split powder metal connecting rods, and in some applications a forged steel crankshaft.

The 2-valve SOHC 5.4 L engine was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 1997–1998 and 2000–2002.

&quot;Vehicles equipped with the 16-valve SOHC 5.4 L include the following:&quot;

===3-valve===
In 2002, Ford introduced a new 3-valve SOHC cylinder head with variable camshaft timing (VCT), improving power and torque over the previous 2-valve SOHC version. The 3-valve cylinder head was first used on the 2002 Ford Fairmont 5.4 L &quot;Barra 220&quot; engine in Australia manufactured in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. The 3-valve 5.4 L was introduced to the North American market in the redesigned 2004 Ford F-150.

&quot;Vehicles equipped with the 24-valve SOHC VCT 5.4 L include the following:&quot;

===4-valve===
In 1999, Ford introduced the DOHC 4-valve 5.4 L in the Lincoln Navigator under the &quot;InTech&quot; moniker, making it the second engine to use this name. Ford later used versions of the DOHC 4-valve 5.4 L in the 2000 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra R, the Ford GT supercar, and the Ford Shelby GT500. The DOHC 4-valve 5.4 L was also used in the Ford Falcon line in Australia under the &quot;Boss&quot; moniker until 2010, when it was replaced by a locally developed, supercharged version of the 5.0 litre Modular V8.

The SVT Cobra R version of the 5.4 L 4-valve V8 had several key differences from its Lincoln counterpart. While the iron block and forged steel crankshaft were sourced directly from the InTech 5.4 L, the Cobra R powerplant benefited from new, high-flow cylinder heads that were designed with features developed for Ford&#x27;s &quot;Rough Rider&quot; off-road racing program, application specific camshafts with higher lift and more duration than other 4-valve Modular cams, forged I-beam connecting rods sourced from Carillo, forged pistons that provided a 9.6:1 compression ratio in conjunction with the 52 cc combustion chambers, and a unique high-flow &quot;cross-ram&quot; style aluminum intake manifold. The Cobra R was rated at and though chassis dynamometer results have shown these ratings to be conservative with unmodified Cobra Rs often producing nearly at the rear wheels.

The Ford GT version of the is a highly specialized version of the Modular engine. It is an all-aluminum alloy, dry-sump DOHC 4 valves per cylinder with an Eaton 2300 Lysholm screw-type supercharger and showcases numerous technological features, such as dual fuel injectors per cylinder and oil squirters for the piston skirts, not found in other Ford Modular engines of the time. This engine benefits from an improved version of the high-flow 2000 Cobra R cylinder head and unique high-lift camshafts, now rated at at 6500 rpm and at 4500 rpm.

The Shelby GT500 uses a 4-valve DOHC 5.4 L with an Eaton M122H Roots type supercharger and air-to-liquid intercooler. The GT500 5.4 L shares its high-flow cylinder head castings with the Ford GT, with only minor machining differences, and shares camshafts with the 2003–2004 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra; which have less lift and duration than the Ford GT camshafts. The 2007–2010 GT500 engine used an iron engine block, while the 2011 GT500 5.4 L receives a new aluminum engine block, with Ford&#x27;s first production application of their patented Plasma Transferred Wire Arc (PTWA) cylinder coating, eliminating the need for pressed in cylinder liners. The PTWA spray apparatus was co-developed by Ford and Flame-Spray Industries of Long Island, New York, for which they received the 2009 IPO National Inventors of the Year Award. The 2011 GT500 engine weighs less than the previous iron-block version, thanks in part to the lack of cast iron cylinder liners. All of the 5.4 L 4-valve engines destined for use in SVT vehicles, such as the Ford GT and Shelby GT500, have been hand-built by technicians at Ford&#x27;s Romeo, Michigan plant.

&quot;Vehicles equipped with the 32-valve DOHC 5.4 L include the following:&quot;

==5.8 L Trinity==
The 5.8 is formally known as the Trinity Engine or 5.8-liter V8 engine, which benefits from cylinder heads with improved coolant flow, Ford GT camshafts, piston-cooling oil jets similar to those found on the 5.0 Coyote, new 5-layer MLS head gaskets, an over-rev function that increases the red line to 7000 rpm for up to 8 seconds (from 6250 rpm), and a compression ratio increased to 9.0:1 from 8.5:1. Displacement is with a bore x stroke of . Boost is supplied by a 2.3 L Eaton TVS supercharger with maximum boost of . Trinity has intake valves and exhaust valves.
* 2013–2014 Ford Shelby GT500, DOHC 4 valves per cylinder, Aluminum block, supercharged and intercooled, at 6500 rpm and at 4000 rpm of torque.

== 6.8 L V10==
The SOHC V10 is another variation of the Modular family created for use in large trucks. Bore and stroke size is , identical to the 5.4 L V8. Both 2-valve and 3-valve versions have been produced. The 6.8 L uses a split-pin crank with 72° firing intervals and a balance shaft gear driven by the left camshaft to quell vibrations inherent to a 90° bank angle V10 engine. The engine&#x27;s firing order is 1-6-5-10-2-7-3-8-4-9. The 2-valve version was first introduced in 1997, with a 3-valve non-VCT (the use of VCT was precluded by the presence of the balance shaft, as the shaft needed to remain in phase with the crankshaft) version to following in 2005.

&quot;Vehicles equipped with the 6.8 L V10 Modular engine include the following&quot;:

===2-valve===


===3-valve===

==Ford of Australia==

Ford Australia used 5.4 L Modular V8s in the Ford Falcon and previously on the Ford Fairlane sedan model ranges, as well as in its high performance Ford Performance Vehicles (FPV) division models, until mid-2010, when they were replaced by the 5.0 L. The DOHC 5.4 L V8s are named &quot;Boss&quot; by Ford Australia. The 3 valve SOHC V8s in non-FPV vehicles are named &quot;Barra&quot; by Ford Australia.

&quot;Ford of Australia 4-valve DOHC 5.4 L V8 engines include:&quot;
==5.0 L and 5.3 L Cammer==
In 2005, Ford Racing Performance Parts introduced a V8 crate engine for use in motor racing and home-made performance cars, officially called M-6007-T50EA, but more widely known as &quot;Cammer&quot;. Since then, other higher performance variations of the Cammer have been introduced for KONI Sports Car Challenge and GT4 European Cup. All versions of the Cammer are DOHC 4-valve per cylinder designs with a bore and stroke of . The Cammer achieves its larger bore by resleeving the 4.6 L aluminum block.

The T50 Cammer crate engine, the least expensive and most street oriented version, uses derivatives of the cylinder heads, variable runner-length magnesium intake manifold, and camshafts first used in the 2000 FR500 Mustang concept car. These parts are unique to the T50 Cammer crate engine and are not found in any other production Modular applications. The T50 has an 11.0:1 compression ratio and exceeds with the proper exhaust manifolds.

The Cammer that has seen success in Grand Am Cup powering the Mustang FR500C is officially called M-6007-R50 and features a unique dual plenum, fixed runner-length magnesium intake manifold, Ford GT aluminum cylinder heads, unique camshafts of undisclosed specifications, and an 11.0:1 compression ratio. The R50 Cammer produces over without restrictor plates. Upon introduction the R50 Cammer-powered Mustang FR500C proved to be dominant in Grand-Am Cup, having achieved five victories and podium appearances in nearly every race in the GS class during the 2005 season, giving David Empringham the championship title with the Multimatic Motorsports team, and Ford the manufacturer&#x27;s title.

Robert Yates publicly expressed interest in using a similar 5.0 L 4-valve DOHC Modular V8 to compete in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series. Roush-Yates supplies a naturally aspirated 5.0 L Cammer for use in the Mustang FR500GT3 and Matech-Ford GT3 which participate in the FIA GT3 European Championship, and a naturally aspirated 5.3 L Cammer for use in the 2010 Matech-Ford GT1 that competes in FIA GT1 World Championship. The Cammer&#x27;s extra displacement is achieved via a stroke.

==World records==

===World&#x27;s fastest production car===

On February 28, 2005, the Koenigsegg CCR used a modified, Rotrex supercharged Ford Modular 4-valve DOHC 4.6 L V8, which produced 806 hp (601 kW), to achieve a top speed of 241 mph (388 km/h). The bore was achieved using Darton M.I.D. Sleeves. This certified top speed was recorded on February 28, 2005, in Nardò, Italy, and broke the McLaren F1&#x27;s world record for fastest production car. The accomplishment was recognized by Guinness World Records in 2005, who gave the Koenigsegg CCR the official title of &quot;World&#x27;s Fastest Production Car.&quot; The Koenigsegg record was broken several months later by the Bugatti Veyron. This engine is the basis for Koenigsegg&#x27;s twin-supercharged flexible fuel V8 seen in the CCX.

===1/8 Mile &amp; 1/4 mile drag race world records===

====1/8 mile====
On March 11, 2018, the team at Modular Motorsports Racing (MMR) used a modified (billet aluminum tall deck) &quot;Coyote engine&quot;, which produced over , and set the world record for the fastest Ford Modular &amp; Coyote engine ever in the , with 3.83 seconds at . This beat the previous mile record, and made MMR’s record the first within the 3.8 seconds zone, and first to break the 200 mph mark in the 1/8 mile. located in Bradenton, Florida, during an event sanctioned by the National Muscle Car Association] (NMCA). The accomplishment was recognized by sanctioning bodies, such as the National Muscle Car Association (NMCA) and the National Mustang Racers Association (NMRA), granting it the official title of the &quot;Fastest Mile Modular / Coyote-Powered Vehicle in the World.&quot; On March 10, 2019, MMR announced that they had topped their previously-held record from 2018. The team’s new records were 3.817 seconds at 204.17 mph (328.58 km/h). The record was accomplished with MMR’s GenX 351 cubic inch Coyote-based engine platform, that featured a &quot;new billet manifold&quot; and other various engine updates.

====1/4 mile====
On November 23, 2019, Modular Motorsports Racing (MMR) with driver Mark Luton set the world record for the &quot;world’s fastest Ford-powered vehicle in the quarter-mile,&quot; with a 5.67 second pass at . The record was accomplished with a Coyote-based engine which featured factory Ford cylinder head castings, valves, lifters, and followers sitting atop a MMR designed billet reproduction of the factory architecture Coyote cylinder block. The specifics of the engine are described by Luton as being a &quot;351 cubic-inch billet MMR block that has a Bryant crankshaft, BME rods, and MMR pistons that are manufactured by Manley,&quot; in addition to &quot;cylinder heads [that] are a factory cast head from Ford… that work with the twin 94 mm turbos from Garrett.&quot; The elapsed time and mph records were recorded at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, during a qualifying race hosted by Street Car Super Nationals (SCSN). 

==Intake manifold defect==
Starting in 1996, Ford began installing a DuPont Zytel nylon-composite intake manifold onto the 2-valve SOHC engines. Plaintiffs in class action lawsuits alleged that the coolant crossover passage of these intake manifolds may crack, resulting in coolant leakage. A US class-action suit was filed on behalf of owners, resulting in a settlement announced on December 17, 2005. 

Starting with the 2002 model year, and implemented halfway through the 2001 lineup, Ford began using a revised DuPont Zytel nylon-composite intake manifold with an aluminum front coolant crossover that corrected the issue. Replacement intakes were also made available for 1996–2001 engines. To be eligible for reimbursement, owners needed to contact a Ford, Lincoln or Mercury dealer within 90 days of December 16, 2005. Further, Ford offered an extended warranty for this part, for seven years from the start date (which means the initial vehicle sale date) without a mileage limitation.

The following vehicles were included in this class-action suit settlement:
* Mercury Grand Marquis, 1996–2001
* Lincoln Town Car, 1996–2001
* Ford Crown Victoria, 1996–2001
* Mercury Cougar, 1996–1997
* Ford Thunderbird, 1996–1997
* Ford Mustang, June 24, 1997 – 2001 (some vehicles)
* Ford Explorer, early 2002

==Spark plug issues==
2-valve 4.6 L, 5.4 L, and 6.8 L engines found in many 1997–2008 Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles may have aluminum cylinder heads with threads for spark plugs that are stripped, missing, or otherwise insufficiently bored out. Ford acknowledges this issue in Technical Service Bulletin 07-21-2 as well as earlier TSBs. Ford&#x27;s TSB does not state that this issue is caused by owner neglect. For vehicles under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty, Ford will only cover the replacement of the entire cylinder head; however, the Ford recommended spark plug service interval extends beyond the duration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty. Ford&#x27;s only authorized repair procedure for out-of-warranty vehicles is to use the LOCK-N-STITCH aluminum insert and tool kit.

3-valve 5.4 L and 6.8 L engines built before 10/9/07 and 3-valve 4.6 Ls built before 11/30/07 found in many 2004–2008 Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles have an issue with difficult-to-remove spark plugs, which can cause part of the spark plug to become seized in the cylinder head. The source of the problem is a unique plug design that uses a 2-piece shell, which often separates, leaving the lower portion of the spark plug stuck deep in the engine&#x27;s cylinder head. The 2-piece OE spark plug design is intrinsically flawed, thus making it susceptible to this problem. Ford acknowledges this issue in TSB 08-7-6 as well as earlier TSBs. Ford&#x27;s TSB does not state that this issue is caused by owner neglect. The TSB provides a special procedure for spark plug removal on these engines. For situations in which the spark plug has partially broken off in the cylinder head, Ford distributes multiple special tools for removing the seized portion of the plug. Their TSB explains the multiple procedures required for handling the different cases/situations that occur when parts of plugs are seized in these engines. This repair is covered for vehicles under warranty; however, the Ford recommended spark plug service interval extends beyond the duration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.

<text>Jennifer Asher Charles (born Zipken; November 15, 1968) is an American singer and songwriter. Along with Oren Bloedow, she co-founded the New York band Elysian Fields. Her work is known for its emotional intensity, with her writing exploring nature, love, loss, death, myth, and identity, often with philosophical and literary influences. She has a contralto voice.

==Early life==
Jennifer was the firstborn child of Peter Charles (né Zipken) and Jeri Charles (née Valentine). She has a younger brother, Joshua. When Jennifer was an infant, her father had her birth name (and that of the whole family) changed from Zipken to Charles, which had been his professional name for years on the radio as a disc jockey, and which he had decided to change legally once his own father died. Charles is of Russian Jewish and Irish descent, and grew up in a mostly secular Jewish household. Her parents separated when she was four, and Jennifer and her brother were raised by their mother, seeing her father every two weeks. She grew up in houses filled with music, because her mother had been a classical music programmer at WMAL-FM, and because her father had been a late night jazz DJ at WAVZ out of New Haven, CT. Her mother also used to be a torch singer in Washington clubs, so Jennifer also learned early on the songs of Édith Piaf, Ruth Etting, Marlene Dietrich, Billie Holiday, and Judy Garland. And from her grandmother, she absorbed most of the Tin Pan Alley and blues songs of the 1920s and 1930s. The music of popular AM radio at the time of her childhood was multiform, and Jennifer fell asleep with a transistor radio most nights.

The homes Jennifer grew up in with her mother in Washington, D.C. were unconventional, and she was exposed to many cultures as her mother and her mother&#x27;s good friend (another single mother) formed something of a group house, taking in writers and filmmakers (Stephen Jimenez and Henry Jaglom among them), and a French chef as boarders. As young children, she and her brothers would travel door to door, performing a kind of children&#x27;s vaudeville act, singing Tin Pan Alley songs and tap dancing. Jennifer was a shy girl, so when she started doing children&#x27;s theater at age 10, her stage debut at Trinity Theater was that of a cat who had no speaking lines but was a mime and dancer who was onstage the length of the play. It was an original role that the director let Jennifer create as she felt she did not fit into any of the written parts. She was also writing herself, and published her first poem, called &quot;Riddle-Song Of The Sun,&quot; that same year. At age 11, she started a newspaper with her best friend called The Pre-Teen Times where they sold subscriptions that came out quarterly. At age 12, she became passionate about the music of South Asia after her mother returned from a journey across India and Nepal with a bag full of cassettes for her, with Jagjit and Chitra Singh&#x27;s The Gold Disc being her favorite. She took flamenco lessons as a young teen, and continued to do children&#x27;s theater and community theater. She studied acting for a summer at Catholic University, and had principal roles in productions at Little Theatre of Alexandria, Olney Theatre Center, and Folger Shakespeare Theatre. She attended the Washington International School, where she studied Spanish and Latin, then the Edmund Burke School, a college prep school she left after she had begun working in professional theatre at Studio Theatre and Source Theatre, and the school could not accommodate her rehearsal schedule. For her last two years of high school, Jennifer attended Duke Ellington School of the Arts, where she was a theater major. An advanced academic program also landed her part-time at George Washington University, where she studied writing and anthropology. 

Jennifer&#x27;s youth in the melting pot of Washington, D.C. was instrumental in her music influence and taste. Her mother had season tickets to the National Symphony Orchestra, which they attended on Friday nights, and her father would take her to hear live jazz at places like Blues Alley, One Step Down, and Charlie&#x27;s Georgetown, where she saw the likes of Anita O&#x27;Day, Mel Tormé, Dizzy Gillespie, Ahmad Jamal, Oscar Peterson, George Shearing, and Jamaican jazz pianist Monty Alexander. In her teens, Jennifer would often travel to New York and London, both with friends and on her own. She was turned on to the different sounds in each city - The Lounge Lizards, Diamanda Galas, Lydia Lunch, Blondie, and The Velvet Underground in New York; and The Specials, Gang of Four, Siouxsie, The Slits, The Buzzcocks, The Birthday Party, Cocteau Twins, and The Fall in the UK. But she was also steeped in the contemporary scenes of her own hometown, dancing at Tracks, Poseurs, and Badlands, and frequenting live music venues like D.C. Space, 9:30 Club, Fort Reno Park, and Cafe Lautrec to see punk bands like Bad Brains, Beefeater, and Rites of Spring. She also grew up going to go-go concerts, seeing Chuck Brown, Trouble Funk, Junk Yard Band, E.U., and Rare Essence, and went to hear Ethiopian music in the clubs and restaurants of DC&#x27;s Adams Morgan neighborhood. As a junior in high school, Jennifer moved out on her own and supported herself with theater work and various odd jobs, including as an artist model at the Corcoran School of the Arts and as a singing waitress in a piano bar called The Top Hat Club. 

==Career==
In 1987, she moved to New York to continue her theatre and academic studies, receiving her Bachelor of Fine Arts from NYU&#x27;s Tisch school in just three years. Upon graduating she appeared in various off-broadway theater productions, had a stint singing in a dive piano bar and curated a performance/poetry series at the original Knitting Factory.

Elysian Fields was founded in 1995 and have released eleven full-length records (including one produced by Steve Albini that was shelved). They have also contributed to many compilation albums, including the first song on John Zorn&#x27;s Serge Gainsbourg tribute album. This song, their rendition of &quot;Les Amours Perdues&quot;, also appeared in Lea Pool&#x27;s film &quot;Emporte Moi&quot;.

Besides Elysian Fields, Charles has other projects. She and Bloedow recorded &quot;La Mar Enfortuna&quot; for Zorn&#x27;s Tzadik label, featuring renditions of Sephardic and Ladino songs. She has studied classical Indian singing with teacher Gulamji. 

In late 2007, she and Bloedow put out a second Tzadik full-length, under the band name La Mar Enfortuna, called &quot;Conviviencia&quot;. Charles sings in five languages on the record, including Ladino, Spanish, Aramaic, Arabic, and Greek.

Charles also makes up a quarter of the band Lovage, along with Dan the Automator, Mike Patton and Kid Koala. The band recorded its debut album titled &quot;Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By&quot; in 2001. Charles co-wrote and sang most of the material on the album. She has also worked with bands like Firewater, turning in performances on &quot;The Circus&quot; and &quot;Mr. Cardiac&quot; from 1996&#x27;s &quot;Get Off the Cross, We Need the Wood for the Fire&quot;, as well as Xian Hawkin&#x27;s &quot;Sybarite&quot;, the Foetus record, &quot;Love&quot;, as well as working with Matt Johnson of The The, and on several of John Zorn&#x27;s records.

Charles recorded in French with the French composer Jean-Louis Murat for the album &quot;A bird on a poire&quot; in 2004, which was nominated for a Victoires de la Musique award in the category Best Pop or Rock Album.

She had a guest spot on ex-Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna&#x27;s solo project Tweaker. She sang and co-composed the track &quot;Crude Sunlight&quot;, which appeared on the 2004 album &quot;2 a.m. Wakeup Call&quot;. Charles co-composed music with Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil (&quot;Run Lola Run&quot;) for the film &quot;Tangled&quot;. Elysian Fields&#x27; version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Tangled up in Blue&quot; can be heard in the film&#x27;s credits.

She produced the latest Oren Bloedow solo record &quot;She Goes With me to a Blossom World&quot;, which came out in 2008.

Charles was back on stage in 2008 in the Off Broadway production &quot;Lightning at Our Feet&quot;, inspired by poet Emily Dickinson, under the direction of Obie winner Bob McGrath, with film maker Bill Morrison and composer Michael Gordon, which was part of the Next Wave festival at Brooklyn Academy of Music in December 2008, where she sang and acted, channeling the iconic 19th century poet.

<text>Idel-Ural (, ), literally Volga-Ural, is a historical region in Eastern Europe, in what is today Russia. The name literally means &quot;Volga-Urals&quot; in the Tatar language. The frequently used Russian variant is &quot;Volgo-Uralye&quot; (). The term Idel-Ural is often used to designate 6 republics of Russia of this region: Bashkortostan, Chuvashia, Mari El, Mordovia, Tatarstan and Udmurtia, especially in Tatar-language literature or in the context of minority languages.

Idel-Ural is at the center of the Volga Federal District (Поволжье, &quot;Povolzhye&quot;). The major religions in the region are Islam and Orthodox Christianity.

==History==
Before being conquered by the Tsardom of Russia in the 16th century, the region was dominated by native Uralic tribes and a succession of Turkic-led empires, such as Volga Bulgaria, the Khazars, the Golden Horde and the Khanate of Kazan. At the time of Peter the Great&#x27;s death, in the early 18th century, the region had been made up of roughly 1 million people, with around half being Tatars, Chuvash, and Bashkirs.

<text>Ġgantija (, &quot;place of giants&quot;) is a megalithic temple complex from the Neolithic era (–2500 BC), on the Mediterranean island of Gozo in Malta. The Ġgantija temples are the earliest of the Megalithic Temples of Malta and are older than the pyramids of Egypt. Their makers erected the two Ġgantija temples during the Neolithic, which makes these temples more than 5,500 years old and the world&#x27;s second-oldest existing manmade religious structures after Göbekli Tepe in present-day Turkey. Together with other similar structures, these have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Megalithic Temples of Malta.

The temples are elements of a ceremonial site used in a fertility rite. Researchers have found that the numerous figurines and statues found on the site are associated with that cult. According to local Gozitan folklore, a giantess named Sansuna who ate nothing but fava beans and honey bore a child from a man of the common people. With the child hanging from her shoulder, she built these temples and used them as places of worship.

== Description and design ==

The Ġgantija temples stand at the edge of the Xagħra plateau, facing toward the south-east. This megalithic monument encompasses two temples and an incomplete third, of which only the facade was partially built before being abandoned. Like &quot;Mnajdra South&quot;, it faces the equinox sunrise, built side by side and enclosed within a boundary wall. The southerly one is the larger and older one, dating back to approximately 3600 BC. It is also better preserved. The plan of the temple incorporates five large apses, with traces of the plaster that once covered the irregular wall still clinging between the blocks.

The temples are built in the typical clover-leaf shape, with inner-facing blocks marking the shape. The space between the walls was then filled in with rubble. A series of semi-circular apses is connected with a central passage. Archaeologists believe that the apses were originally covered by roofing.

The effort is a remarkable feat considering the monuments were constructed when the wheel had not yet been introduced and no metal tools were available to the Maltese Islanders. Small, spherical stones have been discovered. They were used as ball bearings for the vehicles that transported the enormous stone blocks used for the temples.

The temple, like other megalithic sites in Malta, faces southeast. The southern temple rises to a height of . At the entrance sits a large stone block with a recess, which led to the hypothesis that this was a ritual ablution station for purification before worshippers entered the complex. The five apses contain various altars. Researchers have found animal bones on the site that suggest the space was used for animal sacrifice.

==Excavations and recognition==
Residents and travelers knew about the existence of the temple for a long time. In the late 18th century, before any excavations were carried out, Jean-Pierre Houël drew a plan based on that knowledge, which has been found to be highly accurate. In 1827 Col. John Otto Bayer, the Lieutenant Governor of Gozo, had the site cleared of debris. The soil and remains were lost without having been properly examined. German artist Charles Frederick de Brocktorff had painted a picture of the site within a year or two prior to the removal of the debris, so he made a record of the site before clearance.

After the excavations were conducted in 1827, the ruins fell into decay. The remains were included on the Antiquities List of 1925. The land was held privately until 1933, when the Government expropriated it for public benefit. The Museums Department conducted extensive archaeological work in 1933, 1936, 1949, 1956–57 and 1958–59. Its goal was to clear, preserve and research the ruins and their surroundings.

The Ġgantija temples were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. In 1992, the Committee decided to expand the listing to include five other megalithic temples located across the islands of Malta and Gozo. The Ġgantija listing was renamed &quot;the Megalithic Temples of Malta&quot;.

The temple and the surrounding areas were restored or rehabilitated in the 2000s. Lightweight walkways were installed in the temple in 2011, to protect the floor. A heritage park was developed and opened in 2013.

== Contemporary interpretations ==
Anthropologist Kathryn Rountree has explored how &quot;Malta’s neolithic temples&quot;, including Ġgantija, &quot;have been interpreted, contested and appropriated by different local and foreign interest groups: those working in the tourist industry, intellectuals and Maltese nationalists, hunters, archaeologists, artists, and participants in the global Goddess movement.&quot;

Reportedly, some Goddess tours refer to the two temples at Ġgantija &quot;as the Mother &amp; Daughter Temple.&quot;

<text>The Idel-Ural State (, , , also İdel-Ural berlege İdel-Ural ştatı), also known as the Volga-Ural State or Idel-Ural Republic, was an unsuccessful attempt of the autonomy of Tatar peoples that claimed to unite Tatars, Bashkirs, and the Chuvash in the turmoil of the Russian Civil War. The republic was proclaimed on 1 March 1918, by a Congress of Muslims from Russia&#x27;s interior and Siberia, but defeated by Bolsheviks the same month. &quot;Idel-Ural&quot; means &quot;Volga-Ural&quot; in the Tatar language.

==History==


During the Russian Revolution, various regional political leaders convened in June 1917 in Kazan. The group declared the autonomy of &quot;Muslim Turk-Tatars of Inner Russia and Siberia&quot;. Later on, in Ufa, a parliament named the &quot;Millät Mäclese&quot; (National Council) was created, in which a draft for the creation of the state would be pushed through and accepted on 29 November 1917 following the Second All-Russia Muslim Congress. However, the Idel-Ural State was met with opposition from Zeki Velidi Togan, a Bashkir revolutionary, who declared the autonomy of Bashkiria, as well as from the Bolsheviks, who had initially supported the creation of Idel-Ural but two months after denounced it as bourgeois nationalism and declared the creation of the , with around the same borders as Idel-Ural. This struggle between three different movements weakened the Idel-Ural State.

Members of the &quot;Tatar-Bashkir Committee of Idel-Ural&quot; based outside of Russia such as Ayaz İshaki participated in an anti-Bolshevik propaganda war. Some also joined the Prometey group, a circle of anti-Soviet Muslim intellectuals based in Warsaw. The idea of Idel-Ural by its supporting nationalists included the territory of modern-day Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, and most of Orenburg Oblast. The nationalists also wished for expansion towards the Caspian Sea. In January 1918, the &quot;Millät Mäclese&quot; adopted a constitution written by Galimzian Sharaf, Ilias and Jangir Alkin, Osman Tokumbetov and Y. Muzaffarov. 

The &quot;Millät Mäclese&quot; looked to declare the creation of Idel-Ural on 1 March 1918, a plan which never came to fruition due to Bolshevik arrests of deputies of the &quot;Millät Mäclese&quot; and their official declaration of the Tatar-Bashkir Soviet Socialist Republic. After the arrested deputies were freed, they reconvened in the Tatar part of Kazan beyond the Bolaq stream (hence in Soviet historiography it was called &quot;Transbolaq Republic&quot; (Забулачная республика)). The Republic, which in reality included only some sections of Kazan and Ufa, was defeated by the Red Army on 28 March 1918. Its parliament disbanded in April.

The president of Idel-Ural, Sadrí Maqsudí Arsal, escaped to Finland in 1918. He was well received by the Finnish foreign minister Carl Enckell, who remembered his valiant defence of the national self-determination and constitutional rights of Finland in the Russian Duma. The president-in-exile also met officials from Estonia before continuing in 1919 to Sweden, Germany and France, in a quest for Western support. Idel-Ural was listed among the &quot;Captive Nations&quot; in the Cold War-era public law (1959) of the United States.

<doc id="867452" wikidata="Q5342286" url="?curid=867452" title="Edward Chichester, 4th Marquess of Donegall">
<text>Edward Chichester, 4th Marquess of Donegall (11 June 1799 – 20 January 1889), was a clergyman who late in life became an Irish peer. From 1831 until October 1883, he was known as [[The Very Reverend|The Very Rev.]] Lord Edward Chichester. He was the son of the 2nd Marquess of Donegall.

Born in Great Cumberland Place, Westminster, Chichester was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Dublin (TCD), where he graduated BA in 1822.

As a younger son, he became a minister of the Church of Ireland and served as Dean of Raphoe from 1831 to 1871. In 1853, his older brother&#x27;s only surviving son, Frederick Richard Chichester, Earl of Belfast (1827–1853), died unmarried in Naples, leaving Lord Edward as the heir presumptive to the marquessate. In October 1883, at the age of 84, he finally succeeded his 86-year-old elder brother and became the 4th Marquess of Donegall. He died six years later in St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

On 21 September 1821, he married Amelia Spread Deane O&#x27;Grady, the third daughter of Henry Deane O&#x27;Grady by his marriage to Dorcas Spread. They had five children:
*George Augustus Hamilton (27 June 1822 – 13 May 1904)
*Annabella Augusta, who on 23 July 1844 married the 9th Earl Ferrers, and was the mother of the 10th Earl Ferrers (1847–1912).
*Dorcas Juliana Fanny
*Henry Fitzwarine (born 11 September 1834)
*Adolphus John Spencer Churchill (born 18 December 1836), who married Mary, the only child of Robert Peel Dawson, of Moyola Park, Castledawson, and died in 1901. He was the father of Robert Chichester and great-grandfather of the Baron Moyola, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland 1969–1971, and of Sir Robin Chichester-Clark.

A large part of the Donegall estates was not entailed and in 1883 were inherited by the 3rd Marquess&#x27;s only surviving child, Harriet Augusta Anna Seymourina, the wife of the 8th Earl of Shaftesbury.

<text>William Dean (8 January 1840 – 24 September 1905) was an English railway engineer. He was the second son of Henry Dean, who was the manager of the Hawes Soap Factory in New Cross, London. William was educated at the Haberdashers&#x27; Company School. He became the Chief Locomotive Engineer for the Great Western Railway from 1877, when he succeeded Joseph Armstrong. He retired from the post in 1902 and was replaced by George Jackson Churchward. He designed famous steam locomotive classes such as the Duke Class, the Bulldog Class and the long-lived 2301 Class.

==Apprenticeship==
He was apprenticed at the age of fifteen to Joseph Armstrong at the Great Western Railway&#x27;s Wolverhampton Stafford Road Works. During his eight-year apprenticeship he attended Wolverhampton Working Men&#x27;s College in the evening, excelling in mathematics and engineering. Upon completion of his apprentice years in 1863 he was made Joseph Armstrong&#x27;s chief assistant.

==Posts with GWR==

A year later, Joseph Armstrong was promoted to the position of the GWR&#x27;s Chief Locomotive Engineer and moved to Swindon Works. George Armstrong, Joseph&#x27;s brother, succeeded him as Northern Division locomotive superintendent, with Dean under him as Stafford Road works manager. This arrangement lasted until 1868, when Joseph Armstrong made Dean his chief assistant in Swindon. Upon Joseph Armstrong&#x27;s sudden death of a heart attack in 1877, Dean became Chief Locomotive Engineer.

==Convertible locomotives==
At this time, the broad gauge was still in use, although conversion to standard gauge was well underway. Several of Dean&#x27;s early designs were &quot;convertible&quot; locomotives, which could be easily rebuilt into standard gauge.

==Personal==
Dean was the son of a soap works manager in New Cross, London, and attended the Haberdashers&#x27; Boys&#x27; School. (He remained a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers to the end of his life.) He married in 1865, and his wife bore him two daughters and a son, but died soon after their third child&#x27;s birth. He remarried in 1878, but again suffered the death of his wife in 1889.

Dean was ill during his final years as Chief Locomotive Engineer, and he increasingly allowed Churchward to take on the day-to-day responsibilities. He retired in June 1902 to a house that had been bought for him in Folkestone, but died there three years later. His two daughters died before him. A street in Swindon, Dean Street, was named to commemorate Dean&#x27;s contribution to locomotion engineering. It is located close to the Swindon Works site and would have housed G.W.R. workers.

<doc id="867471" wikidata="Q3137863" url="?curid=867471" title="History of Quebec French">
<text>Quebec French is different in pronunciation and vocabulary to the French of Europe and that of France&#x27;s Second Empire colonies in Africa and Asia.

Similar divergences took place in the Portuguese, Spanish and English language of the Americas with respect to European dialects, but in the case of French the separation was increased by the reduction of cultural contacts with France after the 1763 Treaty of Paris in which France ceded Canada to Great Britain.

Although pronunciations like &quot;moé&quot; and &quot;toé&quot; are today stigmatized (&quot;joual&quot;), they were the pronunciations of Early Modern French that were used by the kings of France, the aristocracy and the common people in many provinces of France. After the French Revolution, the standard pronunciation in France changed to that of the bourgeois class in Paris, but Quebec retained some pronunciations and expressions shared with modern Oïl languages such as Norman, Gallo, Breton, Picard, Poitevin and Saintongeais. Speakers of those languages of France predominated among the settlers of New France. Thus, they spoke a popular language that was largely shared with Paris, but they had their own habits, words and pronunciations that were not known in Paris which are now part of everyday language in Quebec.

Quebec French was also influenced by the French spoken by the King&#x27;s Daughters, who were of the petit-bourgeois class from the Paris area (Île-de-France) as well as Normandy.

Thus, the 18th-century bourgeois Parisian French that eventually became the national, standardized language of France after the French Revolution, but the French of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; kept evolving on its own in Canada. Indeed, the French spoken in Canada is closer idiomatically and phonetically to Belgian French, despite their independent evolution and the relatively small number of Belgian immigrants to Quebec (although it is to be remembered that the influence of the Walloon language in Belgium has influenced the language in the same way as the presence of the Oïl speakers in Quebec).

There is also the undeniable fact that Canadian-French speakers have lived alongside and among English speakers ever since the beginning of British administration, in 1763. Thus, anglicisms in Quebec French tend to be longstanding and part of a gradual, natural process of borrowing, but the unrelated anglicisms in European French are nearly all much more recent and sometimes driven by fads and fashions.

Some people (for instance, Léandre Bergeron, author of the &quot;Dictionnaire de la langue québécoise&quot;) have referred to Quebec French as &quot;la langue québécoise&quot; (the Québécois language); most speakers, however, would reject or even take offence to the idea that they do not speak French.

== New France ==

The French language established itself permanently in North America with the foundation of Quebec City by Samuel de Champlain in 1608. However, it was after the creation of the Sovereign Council of New France in 1663 that the colonies really started to develop.

Between 1627 and 1663, a few thousand colonists landed in New France, either in Acadia or Canada. The provinces that contributed the most to these migrations were those in the northern and western regions of France. The migrants came from Normandy, Picardy, Aunis, Aquitaine, Perche, Brittany, Paris and Île-de-France, Poitou, Maine, Saintonge, and Anjou, most of those being regions where French was seldom spoken at the time (see article Languages of France). According to Philippe Barbaud (1984), the first colonists were therefore mostly non-francophone except for the immigrants from the Paris area, who most likely spoke a popular form of French; and the following &quot;dialect clash&quot; (choc des patois) brought about the linguistic unification of Quebec. Among the speakers of Norman, Picard, Aunis, Poitevin and Saintongeais and the Celtic language Breton, many might have understood French as a second language. Gradually, a linguistic transfer towards French occurred, leading to the linguistic unification of all the ethnic groups coming from France.

According to Henri Wittmann (1997) (based on earlier work of his), the overwhelming similarities between the different varieties of Colonial French clearly show that the linguistic unity triggering dialect clash occurred before the colonists exported their French into the colonies of the 17th and 18th centuries; and that the koiné-forming dialect clash must have occurred in Paris and other related urban centers of France.

In any event, according to contemporary sources, the Canadians were all speaking French natively by the end of the 17th century, long before France itself outside its large urban centers.

== British regime ==
On September 13, 1759, Quebec City, then the political capital of New France, was taken by the British Army. New France fell a year later. According to the terms of 1760 Articles of Capitulation of Montreal, the French Army was to leave the conquered territory. The ruling elite (French nobles and leading merchants) also left. Ordinary people, the Roman Catholic clergy, lesser merchants, and some members of the civil administration, the majority having been born in Canada, stayed in the country. Those who stayed were to become British subjects. Soon, British General Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst, established a military government, which was to last until 1763.

The military occupation led to the establishment of a provisional administration. Because the fate of the country was still uncertain, no political actions were really undertaken to transform, and the status quo prevailed. Because the population was unable to understand English, it was decided that ordinances would be published in French. To do so, numerous Canadians were permitted to participate in the administration of justice.

In 1763, France ceded Canada to Great Britain in the Treaty of Paris. Rapidly, the new ruling elite planned its future for the French-speaking colonists, who were to be absorbed into the English-speaking society of British North America, but they were to be allowed the right of Catholic worship under the terms of the treaty. On October 7, the British Royal Proclamation of 1763 set the new political conditions of Canada. The territory of the colony, renamed the &quot;Province of Quebec,&quot; was reduced to the inhabited area along the Saint Lawrence River.

James Murray was appointed governor and became responsible for enforcing the new policy concerning the colony. His tasks were to encourage British immigration; establish the official religion, Anglicanism; and the administrative and legal structures of England. Time brought the gradual establishment of anglophone British officials and colonists. Trade quickly passed on to British and British-American merchants, who migrated to Quebec City, Trois-Rivières, and Montreal.

French, until then the lingua franca in all aspects of social life, was quickly relegated to the second rank in trade and government. The educated classes began French-English bilingualism by necessity.

The Quebec Act of 1774 granted many of the requests of the Canadians, who had been petitioning the British crown for the restoration of French civil laws and guarantees as to the usage of their language and faith.

<text>Edwin Tappan Adney (July 13, 1868 – October 10, 1950), commonly known as Tappan Adney, was an American-Canadian artist, writer, and photographer.

==Biography==
Edwin Tappan Adney was born in Athens, Ohio, the eldest child of William Harvey Glenn Adney (1834–1885) from Vinton, Ohio, a professor at Ohio University, and Ruth Clementine Shaw Adney. When Tappan was five, the family moved to Washington, Pennsylvania where his father taught at Washington and Jefferson College. In 1879, his father retired from that position for health reasons and bought a tobacco farm near Pittsboro, North Carolina named Gum Spring Plantation. Tappan was exceptionally bright and entered the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill at the age of thirteen, where he remained for two years.

==New York==

After his father&#x27;s death in a farm accident, his mother took him and his younger sister Mary Ruth to New York City to further their education. To earn a living, she ran a boarding house, where Tappan got to know his future wife Minnie Bell Sharp of Woodstock, New Brunswick, a piano and singing student, who was one of his mother&#x27;s tenants. Tappan attended Trinity School and after leaving school he worked in a law office. In the evenings he took art classes at the Art Students League of New York.

He graduated from art school at the age of eighteen and provided 110 illustrations for &quot;The Handbook of the Birds of Eastern North America&quot;. His interest in birds continued when he immigrated to Canada and a visitor remarked on his relationship with the birds around his bungalow in Upper Woodstock. He would whistle bird-calls and the birds would flutter around him and sometimes land on his head.

==Canoe-building==
In 1887, Tappan and his sister visited Minnie&#x27;s family at their home in Woodstock, New Brunswick. Adney intended to spend a month in Woodstock preparing for the entry examination for Columbia University. While in Woodstock, he met Peter Jo, a Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet) canoe-builder. He became interested in the language and culture and with Joseph&#x27;s help, he built his first canoe, spending twenty months in Woodstock. In 1890, he wrote an article on canoe-building for a &quot;Harper&#x27;s Young People&quot; supplement. He was credited with saving the art of birchbark canoe construction. He built more than 100 models of different types, which are now housed at the Mariners&#x27; Museum in Newport News, Virginia.

==Writer and illustrator==
From 1890 onwards, Adney earned his reputation as a writer and illustrator for numerous magazine&#x27;s including &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Young People&quot;, &quot;Saint Nicholas&quot;, &quot;Outing&quot;, and &quot;Our Animal Friends&quot;.

He authored the book, &quot;The Klondike Stampede&quot; about the Klondike Gold Rush. His photos of the Klondike Gold rush c. 1899 are available online via the McCord Museum.

He occasionally wrote poetry:

&lt;poem&gt;
::::THE MOOSE CALL

::Chippers to its dusky mate;
From out the misty hill
::A night owl&#x27;s lonesome cry is heard—
A cry that sends a chill
::Of fear through beast and sleeping bird—
Then all again is still.

Hark! the hunter starts!
::A sound borne softly on the air
The mighty stillness parts
::And makes the hunter&#x27;s heart beat fast.
Tender, low, it thrills
::The listening hunter&#x27;s inmost soul:
Yet resonant it fills
::The valley with an echo from
The everlasting hills!
 EDWIN TAPPAN ADNEY
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Klondike Gold Rush==
He was one of the first photojournalists to pass safely through British Columbia. As a writer for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, he was sent with his camera to the Yukon from 1897 to 1898. His classic illustrated book concerns his experiences in the Yukon, of which numerous editions have been printed. He returned there to briefly report on the Nome Gold Rush in 1900. He retired first to Montreal, then to New Brunswick, the place where his wife was born. He learned the Maliseet language of the native Canadians of New Brunswick.

==Marriage and family==

Adney married Minnie Bell Sharp on September 12, 1899, at Saint Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Woodstock, New Brunswick. They had one child, Francis Glenn Adney, born in Woodstock in 1902. He graduated from McGill University in 1923 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics. He played the piano with dance bands in Montreal and the United States. He retired in 1966 from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in New York, where he had worked as an actuary, and died in 1983 in Ramsey, New Jersey.

==Canadian naturalization==

In 1916, he joined the Royal Canadian Engineers. He became a British subject in 1917. During the First World War he was as an engineering officer at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario (1916–19) constructing scale models of fortifications for training purposes. His duties were non-combative and he remained in Canada for the duration of the war.

After the war, he created a set of three-dimensional coats-of-arms of the Canadian provinces, then numbering nine, and one Territory that adorn Currie Hall at Royal Military College of Canada. 

In Montreal, Quebec he created heraldic art, worked for the Museum of McGill University as a consultant on aboriginal lore, and consulted to McCord Museum on canoes 1920–33.

==Consultant on Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet) Culture==
In 1946 Peter Lewis Paul, friend of Tappan Adney and member of the Wolastoqey First Nation, was convicted of the theft of ash saplings. Tappan Adney had previously advocated MP John MacNicol, who was resolved to push a re-examination of the Indian Act, that such activity by a First Nation member was a right guaranteed by treaty. This was the beginning of a long legal debate that was only resolved in 1999 when the Supreme Court of Canada accepted that the Maritime Aboriginals had ancient treaty rights that predated the formation of Canada.

Tappan Adney&#x27;s close association with Peter Paul resulted in a linguistic study of the Wolastoqey language.
==Muralist==
The lobby of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company store on the corner of Portage Avenue and Memorial Boulevard in Winnipeg, Manitoba was decorated with two immense murals, 52′ long by 10′ wide, depicting scenes of the Company&#x27;s early history by Edward Tappan Adney and Adam Sheriff Scott. Although the mural entitled &quot;Nonsuch at Fort Charles&quot; was removed in 1948 to allow the refurbishment of an escalator, &quot;The Pioneer at Fort Garry&quot; (1861) remained on display until 2014. Both murals have been donated to the Manitoba Museum. Fort Garry and Fort Charles were two important trading posts of the Hudson Bay Company. The Nonsuch was the first trading vessel that sailed into Hudson Bay in 1668–1669 and The Pioneer was the first steamboat on the Red River.

His photos of rural Ontario are available online via the McCord Museum.
He then moved to Montreal, Quebec 1920–33 where he created heraldic art, worked for the Museum of McGill University as a consultant on aboriginal lore, and consulted to McCord Museum on canoes.

He is buried in the Upper Woodstock Cemetery, Woodstock, New Brunswick with his wife.

<text>Wayne Horvitz (born September 1, 1955) is an American composer, keyboardist and record producer. He came to prominence in the Downtown scene of 1980s and &#x27;90s New York City, where he met his future wife, the singer, songwriter and pianist Robin Holcomb. He is noted for working with John Zorn&#x27;s Naked City among others. Horvitz has since relocated to the Seattle, Washington area where he has several ongoing groups and has worked as an adjunct professor of composition at Cornish College of the Arts.

==Biography==
Horvitz, a &quot;defiant cross-breeder of genres&quot;, has led the groups The President, Pigpen, Zony Mash, and the Four Plus One Ensemble. 

Works for theater and dance include music for the 1998 production of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; for Seattle&#x27;s ACT theater (directed by Gordon Edelstein); productions of Ezra Pound&#x27;s Elektra and the American premiere of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Mountain Language&quot;, both directed by Carey Perloff. In 1992 choreographer Paul Taylor created a new work, OZ, to eleven compositions by Wayne Horvitz in collaboration with the White Oak Dance Company. Other theater and dance works include music for Bill Irwin&#x27;s Broadway show, Strictly NY, and productions by the Liz Lerman Dance Exchange, Ammi Legendre, Nikki Apino and House of Dames and the Crispin Spaeth Dance Company.

Horvitz has also composed and produced music for a variety of video, film, television and other multimedia projects, including two projects with director Gus Van Sant, a full length score for PBS&#x27;s Chihuly Over Venice, and two films about the creation of Seattle&#x27;s EMP museum. His 85-minute score to Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s film The Circus, for two pianos, two clarinets, and violin premiered in January 2000 in Oporto, Portugal.

As of April 2007 Horvitz performs with Gravitas Quartet, Sweeter Than The Day and Varmint. Since 2008, Horvitz has led The Golden Road, playing music from the early years of The Grateful Dead. In December 2011, Horvitz opened the Royal Room, a live music venue in Columbia City, Seattle. Since that time he has developed his technique of &quot;conduction&quot;, a framework for conducted improvisation using hand gestures that refer to precomposed musical structures that draws on his previous work with Butch Morris.

<text>Flowers of the Forest, or The Fluuers o the Forest (Roud 3812), is a Scottish folk tune and work of war poetry commemorating the defeat of the Scottish army, and the death of James IV, at the Battle of Flodden in September 1513. Although the original words are unknown, the melody was recorded c. 1615–1625 in the John Skene of Halyards Manuscript as &quot;Flowres of the Forrest&quot;, although it might have been composed earlier.

Several versions of words have been added to the tune, notably Jean Elliot&#x27;s lyrics in 1756 or 1758. Others include those by Alison Cockburn below. However, many renditions are played on the great Highland bagpipe. Due to the content of the lyrics and the reverence for the tune, it is one of the few tunes that many pipers will perform in public only at funerals or memorial services, with play otherwise limited to private practice or to instruct other pipers.

==The air==
The tune is a simple modal melody. Typical of old Scottish tunes it is entirely pentatonic, with the dramatic exception of the 3rd and 5th notes of the second line which are the flattened 7th.

==Jean Elliot&#x27;s lyrics==
Jean Elliot (b. 1727), aided in part by popular poetry selections, framed the tune in 1756 as a lament to the deaths of James IV, many of his nobles, and over 10,000 men – the titular &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot; – at the Battle of Flodden Field in northern England in 1513, a significant event in the history of Scotland.

She published it anonymously and it was at the time thought to be an ancient surviving ballad. However, Burns suspected it was an imitation, and together with Ramsay and Sir Walter Scott eventually discovered its author.

The song, written in Scots, is also known as The Floo&#x27;ers o&#x27; the Forest (are a&#x27; wede away) and describes the grief of women and children at the loss of their young men. In some ways the song echoes the Old Welsh poem &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; about a similar defeat in about 600.

Solo bagpipe versions of the song are used at services of remembrance, funerals, and other occasions; many in the Commonwealth know the tune simply as &quot;The Lament&quot; which is played at Remembrance Day or Remembrance Sunday ceremonies to commemorate war dead.

The first verse of the song contrasts happier times with grief at the losses:

::I&#x27;ve heard the lilting, at the yowe-milking,
::Lassies a-lilting before dawn o&#x27; day;
::But now they are moaning on ilka green loaning;
::&quot;The Flowers of the Forest are a&#x27; wede away&quot;.

::Dool and wae for the order sent oor lads tae the Border!
::The English for ance, by guile wan the day,
::The Flooers o&#x27; the Forest, that fought aye the foremost,
::The pride o&#x27; oor land lie cauld in the clay.

The song is mentioned in &quot;The Scots Musical Museum&quot; as &quot;The flowres of the Forrest&quot;, and the air (or tune) apparently survived, but several versions of the words were written down later, the most usual being by Jean Elliot published about 1755 – see links below.

==Alison Cockburn&#x27;s lyrics==
In 1765 the wit and socialite Alison Cockburn published her lyrics to the &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot; beginning &quot;I&#x27;ve seen the smiling of Fortune beguiling&quot; said to have been written before her marriage in 1731 . It concerns a financial crisis that had ruined the fortunes of a number of the Selkirk Lairds. Later biographers, however, think it probable that it was written on the departure to London of a certain John Aikman, with whom Alison appears to have had an early attachment.

The first verse runs:

==Modern usage==
It was played by two pipers as HM Queen Victoria&#x27;s body was carried in procession from Osborne House on its way to Windsor for her funeral in 1901.

The piece was played by Pipe Major Colour Sergeant Peter Grant of The Highlanders, Royal Regiment of Scotland at the funeral of HRH Prince Philip, The Duke of Edinburgh on Saturday, April 17, 2021 and again in tribute on Friday, September 9, 2022 by a lone piper, Pipe Sergeant Parsons of the London Scottish, at the memorial service of HM Queen Elizabeth II. It was again played by a lone piper as her body left St Giles&#x27;s Cathedral in preparation for its journey to London. As per royal tradition, the piece was played by the mass pipes and drums of the Irish and Scots Guards, at the last stage of the state funeral procession, when the Queen&#x27;s coffin was brought down the hill from Windsor Castle to the lower ward and St. George&#x27;s Chapel. Traditionally, the piece has always been played for this stage of a monarch&#x27;s state funeral.

In late 1942, according to the late Duchess of Windsor&#x27;s memoir &quot;The Heart Has Its Reasons&quot;, The Duke of Windsor asked that it be played at the funeral of his brother, Prince George, Duke of Kent, who was killed in a plane crash in the Scottish Highlands. Apparently it was a personal favourite of the Duke of Kent.

It is the official lament of the Canadian Armed Forces, played to honour dead members of the service.

It was standard practice in the British and Canadian military to use this tune to mark the death of a soldier serving in Afghanistan during the official memorial service. 

An excerpt from J. Elliot&#x27;s lyrics to this song was used in John McGrath&#x27;s play &quot;Border Warfare&quot; (1989).

The English folk-rock band Fairport Convention covered the song on their 1970 album &quot;Full House&quot;. 

The tune was played by a lone piper at the funeral of singer/songwriter Sandy Denny. 

The track &#x27;Flowers of the Town&#x27; by the English folk band The Unthanks is based on this song but it laments the loss of young men in the First World War. The lyrics of this version are almost identical to the first of &quot;Two Songs&quot; by Cecil Day-Lewis.

In 2007, Scottish singer Isla St Clair was invited to sing &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot; at Tyne Cot Cemetery in Flanders, Belgium to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele, in the First World War. The ceremony was attended by Queen Elizabeth II and Queen Paola, as well as other European Heads of State and Commonwealth Representatives. She also recorded the lament in 1998, for the album &quot;When the Pipers Play&quot; and again in 2011, for the Scots Guards album &quot;From Helmand To Horse Guards&quot;.

Both versions of the song are part of the traditional music at Selkirk Common Riding which in part commemorates the loss at Flodden. Jean Elliot&#x27;s version is known in the town as &quot;The Liltin&quot; and is played after the Casting of the Colours ceremony. Alison Cockburn&#x27;s version is played as a march by the town band but is also the version more often sung; it is the version known in Selkirk as &quot;The Flo&#x27;ers o&#x27; the Forest&quot;.

Scots/Australian singer-songwriter Eric Bogle refers to &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot; in his song &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, in which he muses over the grave of a World War I soldier, and wonders whether &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot; and &quot;Last Post&quot; were played at the soldier&#x27;s burial.
English folk singer June Tabor recorded Bogle&#x27;s song, followed by an instrumental version of &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot;, on the album &quot;Ashes and Diamonds&quot; (1977).

Australian singer-songwriter Graham Dodsworth recorded a version of the song with Irish/Australian singer Claire Peters on his 1998 folk music album &quot;In Good King Arthur&#x27;s Day&quot;.

The song is heavily referenced in the novel &quot;Sunset Song&quot; by Lewis Grassic Gibbon and features in the 2015 film of the same name, including a rendition by Agyness Deyn, who plays the lead character, Chris Guthrie.

Scottish tenor Kenneth McKellar recorded a version of the song.

Michael Nyman speeded up the song and re-edited it as part of the score for &quot;The Piano&quot;.

English musician Mike Oldfield covered the song on his 1996 album, &quot;Voyager&quot;.

The song is quoted at the beginning and end of the historical novel &quot;The Flowers of the Forest&quot; by Elizabeth Byrd, which culminates in the Battle of Flodden.

The Australian War Memorial uses the song during its Last Post ceremony.

==The Forest==
The Forest was a district and Royal forest comprising Selkirkshire (alternatively known as Ettrick Forest or the Shire of the Forest), large parts of Peeblesshire and parts of Clydesdale, known for its archers. The archers of Ettrick Forest earned the epithet &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot; at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298, and formed the bodyguard of King James IV at Flodden, where their corpses were found surrounding their dead monarch.

<text>Auraria is a ghost town in Lumpkin County, Georgia, United States, southwest of Dahlonega. Its name derives from &quot;aurum&quot;, the Latin word for &quot;gold&quot;. In its early days, it was also known variously as Dean, Deans, Nuckollsville, and Scuffle Town.

==History==
Thousands of settlers came to these former Cherokee lands in search of gold during the Georgia Gold Rush, and following the Gold Lottery of 1832. One of the first gold rush boom towns started in Auraria in June 1832, when William Dean built a cabin between the Chestatee River and Etowah River. As the temporary seat of Lumpkin County in 1832, Nathaniel Nuckolls built a tavern, hotel, and several buildings to house the miners. Within six months of the lottery, &quot;one hundred family dwellings, eighteen or twenty stores, twelve or fifteen law offices, and four or five taverns&quot; were to be found in the town. By May 1833 the town population was 1,000, and 10,000 were in the county.

The land east of Auraria was purchased by Vice President John C. Calhoun, where he established the Calhoun Mine. A traveling companion of Calhoun, Dr. Croft, suggested the town be renamed &quot;Aureola&quot;, in November 1832. The town citizens chose &quot;Auraria&quot;, suggested by John Powell.

The banks of the Etowah River, Camp Creek, and Cane Creek had many mines (Barlow Mine, Battle Branch Mine, Ralston Mine, Whim Hill Mine, Hedwig-Chicago Mine, Gold Hill Mine Etowah Mine, and others).

The 40-acre (16 ha) gold lot on which most of Auraria stood was won by John R. Plummer, but his right to participate in the lottery was questioned. Faced with this legal challenge, the lower court judges picked the site north of Auraria near the Cane Creek mining area. Auraria experienced a sharp decline as businesses and county offices relocated. The first session of the Superior Court of Lumpkin County met in what became known as Dahlonega, Georgia on Aug. 22, 1833. Due to its location and political influence, Dahlonega received a federal mint for gold coins.

In 1848, gold was discovered in California. Former Auraria resident Jennie Wimmer, a cook in rural California, was the first person to prove the gold&#x27;s authenticity, because she was the only person on the scene who knew how to perform the proper tests. This discovery led to the California Gold Rush of 1849. The discovery of gold in California and soon after in Colorado caused Auraria to eventually fade into history. Gold mining in Georgia decreased and eventually all but ceased as miners went west looking for uncharted prospecting. Auraria&#x27;s population quickly dwindled, and the community deteriorated.

William Greeneberry Russell and a party of men of Auraria who left for Kansas Territory formed the Colorado settlement of Auraria in 1858; the town later merged with Denver.

==Present day==
There are still a few old buildings standing: Woody&#x27;s store at Castleberry Bridge Road, that remained open till the early 1980s; a red house that was once a bank; another house across the street; and a couple of foundations.

==Geography==
To visit Auraria, travel from the square in Dahlonega on the west road to Dawsonville, pass the college (the gold-domed building is built on the foundation of the old mint). Turn left at the bottom of that hill and continue about 3 miles. The old red house on the left is the bank; after it, there previously was a collapsing building (the remains of which were removed in the early 2010s), which was the old hotel, and just beyond on the left is the old Woody&#x27;s store. Castleberry Bridge Road to the right leads down to the Etowah River.

<text>The colonization of the Moon is a process or concept employed by some proposals for robotic or human exploitation and settlement endeavours on the Moon. Often used as a synonym for its more specific element of settling the Moon (the establishing and expanding of lunar habitation), lunar or space colonization as a whole has become contested for perpetuating colonialism and its exploitive logic in space.

Laying claim to the Moon has been declared illegal through international space law and no state has made such claims, despite having a range of probes and artificial remains on the Moon.

While a range of proposals for missions of lunar colonization, exploitation or permanent exploration have been raised, current projects for establishing permanent crewed presence on the Moon are not for colonizing the Moon, but rather focus on building moonbases for exploration and to a lesser extent for exploitation of lunar resources.

The commercialization of the Moon is a contentious issue for national and international lunar regulation and laws (such as the Moon treaty).

==History==

Colonization of the Moon has been imagined as early as the first half of the 17th century by John Wilkins in &quot;A Discourse Concerning a New Planet&quot;.

Colonization of the Moon as a material process has been taking place since the first artificial objects reached the Moon after 1959. &quot;Luna&quot; landers scattered pennants of the Soviet Union on the Moon, and U.S. flags were symbolically planted at their landing sites by the Apollo astronauts, but no nation claims ownership of any part of the Moon&#x27;s surface. Russia, China, India, and the U.S. are party to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which defines the Moon and all outer space as the &quot;province of all mankind&quot;, restricting the use of the Moon to peaceful purposes and explicitly banning military installations and weapons of mass destruction from the Moon.

The landing of U.S. astronauts was seen as a precedent for the superiority of the free-market socioeconomic model of the U.S., and in this case as the successful model for space flight, exploration and ultimately human presence in the form of colonization. In the 1970s the word and goal of colonization was discouraged by NASA and funds as well as focus shifted away from the Moon and particularly to Mars. But the U.S. eventually nevertheless opposed the 1979 Moon Agreement which aimed to restrict the exploitation of the Moon and its resources. Subsequently, the treaty has been signed and ratified by only 18 nations, as of January 2020, none of which engage in self-launched human space exploration.

After U.S. missions in the 1990s suggested the presence of lunar water ice, its actual discovery in the soil at the lunar poles by Chandrayaan-1 (ISRO) in 2008–2009 renewed interest in the Moon. A range of moonbases have been proposed by states and public actors. Currently the U.S.-led international Artemis program seeks to establish with private contractors a state run orbital lunar way-station in the late 2020s, and China proposed with Russia the so-called International Lunar Research Station to be established in the 2030s and aim for an &quot;Earth-Moon Space Economic Zone&quot; to develop by 2050.

Current proposals mainly have the goal of exploration, but such proposals and projects have increasingly aimed for enabling exploitation or commercialization of the Moon. This move to exploitation has been criticized as colonialist and contrasted by proposals for conservation (e.g. by the organization &quot;For All Moonkind&quot;), collaborative stewardship (e.g. by the organization &quot;Open Lunar Foundation&quot;, chaired by Chris Hadfield) and the &quot;Declaration of the Rights of the Moon&quot;, drawing on the concept of the Rights of Nature for a legal personality of non-human entities in space.

==Missions==
The colonization of the Moon has been pursued and advocated for by a range of civil actors and space advocacy groups since the advent of spaceflight, mainly to establish a permanent human presence and settlement on the Moon.

States have explicitly refrained from calling for lunar colonization and particularly from laying any claims of territory on the Moon, in accordance with international bans on any such claims.

States though have been pursuing the establishment of moonbases, the first being the temporary Tranquility Base of Apollo 11 in 1969, the first crewed mission on the Moon.
Those and contemporary concepts and plans for moonbases have had the purpose to advance spaceflight and space exploration.

Contemporary plans for moonbases, such as the leading Artemis program and International Lunar Research Station projects, have supported in-situ resource utilization and therefore prospecting for lunar resources. To complement the Artemis program private commercial space enterprise and services have been enabled and contracted.

==Law==
==Economic prospecting and development==
For long-term sustainability, a space colony should be close to self-sufficient. Mining and refining the Moon&#x27;s materials on-site – for use both on the Moon and elsewhere in the Solar System – could provide an advantage over deliveries from Earth, as they can be launched into space at a much lower energy cost than from Earth. It is possible that large amounts of cargo would need to be launched into space for interplanetary exploration in the 21st century, and the lower cost of providing goods from the Moon might be attractive.

===Space-based materials processing===
In the long term, the Moon will likely play an important role in supplying space-based construction facilities with raw materials. Microgravity in space allows for the processing of materials in ways impossible or difficult on Earth, such as &quot;foaming&quot; metals, where a gas is injected into a molten metal, and then the metal is annealed slowly. On Earth, gas bubbles may rise or fall due to their relative density to air, but in a zero gravity environment this does not happen. The annealing process requires large amounts of energy, as a material is kept very hot for an extended period of time (allowing the molecular structure to realign), and this too may be more efficient in space, as the vacuum drastically reduces all heat transfer except through radiative heat loss.

===Exporting material to Earth===
Exporting material to Earth in trade from the Moon is problematic due to the cost of transportation, which would vary greatly if the Moon is industrially developed. One suggested trade commodity is helium-3 (3He) which is carried by the solar wind and accumulated on the Moon&#x27;s surface over billions of years, but occurs only rarely on Earth. Helium-3 might be present in the lunar regolith in quantities of 0.01 ppm to 0.05 ppm (depending on soil). In 2006 it had a market price of about $1,500 per gram ($1.5M per kilogram), more than 120 times the value per unit weight of gold and over eight times the value of rhodium.

In the future 3He harvested from the Moon may have a role as a fuel in thermonuclear fusion reactors. It should require about of helium-3 to produce the electricity that Earth uses in a year and there should be enough on the Moon to provide that much for 10,000 years.

In 2024, an American startup called Interlune announced plans to mine Helium on the Moon for export to Earth. The first mission plans to use NASA&#x27;s Commercial Lunar Payload Services program to arrive on the moon.

===Exporting propellant obtained from lunar water===
To reduce the cost of transport, the Moon could store propellants produced from lunar water at one or several depots between the Earth and the Moon, to resupply rockets or satellites in Earth orbit.

====Lunar water ice====


Lunar scientists had discussed the possibility of water repositories for decades. They are now increasingly &quot;confident that the decades-long debate is over&quot; a report says. &quot;The Moon, in fact, has water in all sorts of places; not just locked up in minerals, but scattered throughout the broken-up surface, and, potentially, in blocks or sheets of ice at depth.&quot; The results from the &quot;Chandrayaan&quot; mission are also &quot;offering a wide array of watery signals.&quot;

It is estimated there is at least 600 million tons of ice at the north pole in sheets of relatively pure ice at least a couple of meters thick.

===Solar power satellites===
Gerard K. O&#x27;Neill, noting the problem of high launch costs in the early 1970s, proposed building Solar Power Satellites in orbit with materials from the Moon. Launch costs from the Moon would vary significantly if the Moon is industrially developed. This proposal was based on the contemporary estimates of future launch costs of the Space Shuttle.

On April 30, 1979, the Final Report &quot;Lunar Resources Utilization for Space Construction&quot; by General Dynamics Convair Division under NASA contract, NAS9-15560 concluded that the use of lunar resources would be cheaper than terrestrial materials for a system comprising as few as thirty Solar Power Satellites of 10 GW capacity each.

In 1980, when NASA&#x27;s launch cost estimates for the Space Shuttle were grossly optimistic, O&#x27;Neill et al. published another route to manufacturing using lunar materials with much lower startup costs. This 1980s SPS concept relied less on human presence in space and more on partially self-replicating systems on the lunar surface under telepresence control of workers stationed on Earth.

<doc id="867492" wikidata="Q284047" url="?curid=867492" title="Christy Turlington">
<text>Christy Nicole Turlington Burns ( Turlington; born January 2, 1969) is an American-Salvadoran fashion model. She initially attracted fame in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a supermodel. She represented Calvin Klein&#x27;s Eternity campaign in 1989 and again in 2014, and also represents Maybelline. Grace Coddington, the long-time creative director of American &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine, has described Turlington as &quot;the most beautiful woman in the world.&quot;

==Early life==
Turlington was born in Walnut Creek, California, the middle of three daughters born to Dwain Turlington, a pilot for Pan Am, and María Elizabeth ( Parker Infante), a flight attendant from El Salvador. She was raised in the Roman Catholic faith of her mother along with her sisters and continued to practice the religion into adulthood.

She was discovered by local photographer Dennie Cody while she was riding a horse in Miami, Florida, where her father was working as a training captain for Pan Am. Turlington began modeling after school from age 14 to 16 and during summers while she attended Monte Vista High School in Danville, California. After turning 18, she moved to New York City to model full-time, and later graduated from high school. She went back to school in 1994 and graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1999 from the Gallatin School of Individualized Study of New York University, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with a concentration in Comparative Religion and Eastern Philosophy. She continued her studies at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.

== Modeling ==

===20th century===
During the 1990s, she appeared in &quot;Unzipped&quot;, a documentary about fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, and the fashion mockumentary film &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot; by director Robert Altman. Additionally, she was featured in &quot;Catwalk&quot;, a documentary about her life on the fashion runways by director Robert Leacock. Turlington has appeared on international fashion magazines that include &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Officiel&quot;, &quot;Tatler&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and &quot;Allure&quot;.

Turlington has been featured in advertising campaigns for Calvin Klein, Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, Marc Jacobs, Donna Karan, Prada, Valentino, Versace, Louis Vuitton, Bally, Jason Wu, Max Mara, Escada, Michael Kors, and Maybelline. She also appeared in two music videos. Fellow model Yasmin Le Bon got her husband Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran to feature Turlington in their &quot;Notorious&quot; video and album cover in 1986, at the age of 17. In 1990, singer George Michael drew inspiration from Peter Lindbergh&#x27;s January 1990 British &quot;Vogue&quot; cover (which features Turlington, Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, and Tatjana Patitz) for his &quot;Freedom!&quot; video. The video featured all top 5 female models along with their top 5 male counterparts, lip-syncing the song. The video was shown during George Michael&#x27;s 2008 concert tour while he sang. She was added on as the fourth model investor, after Elle Macpherson, Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer of the now defunct Fashion Cafes. Turlington has also been credited along with Alicia Silverstone with introducing the navel piercing to mainstream culture after she and Naomi Campbell got their navels piercing together before baring their piercings at a London fashion show in 1993.

===More recently===

In honor of Turlington&#x27;s 40th birthday, &quot;W&quot; magazine put together a collection of notable images from her career, from runway shots from the late eighties to today. In 2008, casting agent James Scully said regarding Turlington:

Turlington was one of the faces to land in one of the fourteen covers of &quot;V magazine&quot; September 2008 issue. Each cover boasts a head shot of a famous model, either from the new crop of leading models or the supermodel era, it was lensed by duo Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin.

She featured in the Bally spring/summer 2009 campaign alongside Oriol Elcacho.

Turlington Burns closed the Autumn Winter 2019 walk for fashion designer Marc Jacobs.

Turlington is featured in a four-part Apple TV+ docuseries titled &quot;The Super Models.&quot; Having premiered on September 20, 2023, the series also features Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, and Linda Evangelista and is directed by Roger Ross Williams and Larissa Bills.

== Other ventures ==
In the 2000s, she has become a partner in a variety of business ventures: an ayurvedic skincare line, Sundari, and two clothing lines produced by Puma, an active women&#x27;s clothing line; and a women&#x27;s yoga-wear line.

She has contributed writings to &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Yoga Journal&quot;, and &quot;Teen Vogue&quot; along with contributions to the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;. She has also contributed to NBC’s &quot;Today Show&quot; as a guest correspondent, which included reporting on the status of girl’s education in Afghanistan in early 2002 and an interview with H.H. Dalai Lama at his home in Dharamshala, India.

She was also an initial product tester for the Apple Watch launch in 2015, participating in the press conference and allowing them to film a segment featuring her use of the Apple Watch to train for a marathon.

== Humanitarian activities ==

In 2005 Turlington began working with the international humanitarian organization CARE and has since become their Advocate for Maternal Health. She is also an Ambassador for Product Red.

After suffering complications in her own 2003 childbirth, and upon learning that over 500,000 women die each year during childbirth (of which 90% of the deaths are preventable), Turlington was inspired to pursue a Master&#x27;s degree in Public Health at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.

Turlington visited Swaziland in May 2007 on behalf of Product Red, and El Salvador and Peru in 2005 and 2008, respectively, on behalf of CARE. Her involvement with CARE was influenced by her mother, Elizabeth, who has been a longtime CARE supporter through her former flight attendants’ organization, World Wings. The FEMME project, a coming together of CARE, Columbia University, and local government, brings health-care practitioners together to find better methods of serving the large number of women needing assistance who are too intimidated to seek help in a clinic or traditional hospital.

In September 2010, Turlington participated in a CARE Learning Tour to Ethiopia to investigate the work being done to reduce maternal deaths.

Turlington serves on the Harvard Medical School Global Health Council, and as an advisor to the Harvard School of Public Health Board of Dean&#x27;s Advisors, She is a member of White Ribbon Alliance for Safe Motherhood and Mother&#x27;s Day Every Day.

=== &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; ===
Turlington made her directorial debut on the 2010 documentary film &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot;. The 60 minute documentary profiles the status of maternal health and focuses on four cases: from Tanzania, Bangladesh, Guatemala, and the United States. The film made its world premiere at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival in the United States, and the U.S. television broadcast premiere aired on the new Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) on May 7, 2011. The documentary earned Turlington a nomination for the Do Something With Style Award from the VH1 Do Something Awards.

=== Every Mother Counts ===

Concurrent with the debut of her documentary &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot;, Turlington launched Every Mother Counts (EMC), a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to making pregnancy and childbirth safe for every mother. Every Mother Counts informs, engages, and mobilizes new audiences to take actions and raise funds that support maternal health programs around the world. EMC supports programs in Haiti, Uganda, Malawi, Indonesia, and the United States.

Turlington completed her first New York City Marathon in 2011, running with Team Every Mother Counts to raise awareness for maternal and child health. She also ran the 2013 ING NYC Marathon with Team EMC and 2013 Hood to Coast Relay, which is featured in her documentary film, Every Mile, Every Mother.

The charity released a short film series entitled &quot;Giving Birth in America&quot; some-time a little before May 2015.

==== Albums ====
&quot;Every Mother Counts&quot; is a compilation album that was released in 2011 exclusively to Starbucks, with a proportion of the proceeds to be donated to CARE and the Every Mother Counts organisation to support its maternal health care programs in coffee growing countries worldwide.

&quot;Every Mother Counts 2012&quot; is a compilation album that was released in 2012 in partnership with Starbucks. U.S. $8 from the sale of each CD in participating Starbucks stores during 2012 is &quot;to be given in support of Every Mother Counts&quot;.

===Other===
In 2015, Turlington signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.

==Honors==

She was one of fifteen women selected to appear on the cover of the September 2019 issue of &quot;British Vogue&quot;, by guest editor Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.

==Personal life==

In 2000, Turlington met actor, director, and writer Edward Burns at a Hamptons party, and by the end of the year they were engaged. In 2002 and just months after buying a New York property together, they decided to split up. The couple reunited and were married in June 2003. Despite numerous erroneous media reports, Turlington was not given away by her good friend Bono. Bono attended the San Francisco wedding, but Turlington said, &quot;[Bono] was there, of course, but I gave myself away. I mean, I was 25 weeks pregnant at the time. Eddie met me halfway down the aisle.&quot; Burns and Turlington have two children, Grace, born in 2003, and Finn, born in 2006. Turlington&#x27;s sister Kelly is married to Edward&#x27;s brother Brian Burns.

An ex-smoker whose father died of lung cancer, Turlington is an anti-smoking activist.

Turlington began smoking at 13 and was smoking a pack a day by age 16. At age 26, she quit smoking. In 2000 at age 31, when undergoing a lung scan to raise awareness about medical technology, she was diagnosed with early-stage emphysema.

===Yoga===
Turlington is a practitioner of yoga, specifically a type of yoga known as Jivamukti. Turlington has practiced yoga since 1987. Within an article published April 15, 2001, she stated she practiced three times a week, during the morning time. She credits yoga with bringing her closer to her Catholic faith.

She is the author of the book &quot;Living Yoga: Creating A Life Practice&quot;, first published in 2002, is now within a third edition (2002, 2003, 2005).

<text>Minnie Bell Sharp Adney (January 12, 1865 – April 11, 1937) was a Canadian music teacher and businesswoman. From childhood on she was actively involved in her family&#x27;s orchard and nursery business. She owned and operated music schools in Victoria, British Columbia and Woodstock, New Brunswick. She was the first New Brunswick woman ever to run in a Canadian federal election.

==Family, early life and education==
She was born in Upper Woodstock, New Brunswick, one of eight children of Francis Peabody Sharp and his wife Maria Shaw. Their first three children had all died of diphtheria within one week in 1861. Minnie Bell was the eldest of three sisters. She had one older brother and one younger. 

Her father, a noted experimental pomologist, owned orchards and fruit nurseries which grew to be the largest in Canada by 1890. Minnie Bell Sharp later described her childhood and youth as &quot;a glorious life&quot; and her family&#x27;s home as &quot;a veritable fairyland&quot;. She recalled having &quot;an unlimited capacity for hard work&quot; and being &quot;up at daylight packing and shipping apples and plums&quot; during the harvest season. 

She was educated mainly by her mother, with one year spent at Compton Ladies&#x27; College, an Anglican boarding school in the Eastern Townships of Quebec, when she was 14. Later she attended St. Margaret&#x27;s Hall school in Halifax, where she excelled in music. Encouraging her musical development, her father purchased the first Steinway piano in New Brunswick

During most winters between 1883 or 1884 and 1890 she studied voice and piano in New York City. The composer and pianist William Mason was one of her teachers. 

==Career==

She taught music in Woodstock, New Brunswick and organized local concerts in which her students performed, on one occasion joined by friends of Sharp&#x27;s from Fredericton and New York. She also organized concerts in Saint John, New Brunswick and Houlton and Calais, Maine. 

In 1893 she purchased the business name and goodwill of the Victoria Conservatory of Music at Victoria, British Columbia for $1200, of which $700 was in cash and the remaining $500 in the form of a promissory note. She took possession of the conservatory in September 1893 and remained its principal until 1900. It was the largest music school in the city, with as many as 60 students and 5 staff in addition to Sharp and her assistant Beth Walker, who had studied with Sharp in New York. Sharp taught voice and piano; other subjects taught included music theory and history, sight-singing by the sol-fa method, violin, elocution and languages (French, Italian and German). The conservatory regularly presented student recitals and benefit concerts in which Sharp and other teachers participated. 

The Sharp family businesses in New Brunswick were losing money due to a combination of factors including the effect of the protectionist McKinley Tariff introduced in the United States in 1890, the death in 1892 from tuberculosis of Francis Peabody Sharp&#x27;s son Franklin, who had taken over the businesses from his father, and the devastation of the plum orchard by an unusually cold winter in the following year. In order to assist her parents and unmarried sister, Minnie Bell Sharp sent money home, and went into debt to do so. She also spent the summer and fall of every year but 1894 and 1895 in New Brunswick helping with the fruit harvest and sale. 

In 1897, while she was home for the summer, the Woodstock school district trustees presented her with a bill for back taxes owed by the Sharp orchards. She refused to pay the full amount of the bill, on the grounds that the property&#x27;s value had declined. She was then arrested and spent 17 days in jail. She was released after she realized that she was not subject to arrest because she was a non-resident, a fact that she learned by reading the New Brunswick statutes while in jail. The lawyers for the school trustees said that they were unaware of this exemption. She sued the school trustees for $2,500 for false imprisonment. She won the case but was awarded only $1. She appealed the amount and a second trial took place in April 1900, in which she was awarded damages of $75.

After her marriage to Tappan Adney in Woodstock in September 1899 she returned to Victoria late in the year. She left for New Brunswick in April 1900 after closing the conservatory. In the same year she opened the Woodstock School of Music, which she ran for the next 20 years. She also led choral groups for adults and children.

Between 1906 and 1916 Minnie Bell Sharp Adney and her husband worked together to revive the Sharp nursery and orchard businesses, but they were ultimately unsuccessful.

==Political candidacy==

In 1919, Minnie Bell Sharp Adney announced her candidacy as an Independent for the federal constituency of Victoria—Carleton in a by-election to fill the seat vacated by the resignation of Frank Broadstreet Carvell. She declared that she would support the government in office and would &quot;work first for justice and the people; for an adequate recompense for our wonderful soldier boys&quot;, &quot;for the children of our land&quot;, &quot;for our common cause, without destruction of classes or creeds or the drawing of stringent political lines, for the good of all, the public weal and humanity&quot;. Her name did not appear on the ballot because she was late filing her nomination papers.

In the general election of 1921 she again put her name forward, offering her support to the Liberal Party. Among the items in her platform were &quot;more pay for the soldiers&quot;, &quot;mothers&#x27; bonus such as obtains in Ontario&quot;, and &quot;return to old high license of a liquor law or such a system as Quebec or British Columbia have, whereby the national debt could be liquidated in two years&quot;. On this occasion she presented her nomination papers on time but did not have the $200 deposit required to file the papers.

In the general election of 1925, her name appeared on the ballot as an independent candidate. Her nomination papers were filed and a $200 deposit was paid by an &quot;agent&quot;, Helen McKibbin. She was the first woman ever nominated in a federal election in New Brunswick. The seat was won by the Conservative candidate James Kidd Flemming. Minnie Bell Adney, whose campaign slogan was &quot;By their fruits ye shall know them&quot;, received 84 votes.

==Personal life==

On 12 September 1899, Sharp married Tappan Adney in Woodstock. While studying in New York she had stayed at a boarding house in Manhattan that was owned by Ruth Shaw Adney. At her invitation Mrs. Adney&#x27;s son Tappan and daughter Mary Ruth visited the Sharp family in New Brunswick in the summer of 1887. Tappan Adney remained in New Brunswick until the fall of 1889 and returned several times in the following decade. Mary Ruth Adney worked with Sharp at the conservatory in Victoria from 1893 to 1896 and Tappan Adney visited the city for five months in 1895. 

Minnie Bell and Tappan Adney had one child, Francis Glenn Adney (called Glenn). He was born in Woodstock in 1902. He attended McGill University in Montreal on scholarships and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics in 1923. He played the piano, and worked as a jazz musician and dance band leader in Montreal. He worked as an actuary for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in New York from the early 1930s until he retired in 1966. He died in 1983 in Ramsey, New Jersey, where he had lived for 50 years.

She suffered from Fuchs&#x27; dystrophy, a degenerative eye disease, and became blind in the last years of her life. In 1933 she and her husband returned to Woodstock from Verdun, Quebec, where they had been living. Minnie Bell Sharp Adney died on 11 April, 1937. She is buried in the Upper Woodstock Cemetery with her husband, who died in 1950.

<text>Roma Victor is an MMORPG based on the Roman Empire in Great Britain in the latter half of the 2nd century. &quot;Roma Victor&quot; was developed by RedBedlam Ltd. of Brighton and Hove, England. The in-game world was a 30x30km representation of a section along Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, including several small villages and Roman forts.

&quot;Roma Victor&quot; was released by RedBedlam on July 14, 2006, with pre-order customers being let in 2 weeks earlier. In January 2010, it was announced that the purchase of new accounts would be blocked as of May 5, and that the game would remain online for another year after that, at RedBedlam&#x27;s expense. However, the game was shut down almost 6 months early without warning.

== Setting ==
&quot;Roma Victor&quot; was set in the province of Britannia just before the decline of the Roman Empire, beginning in the year 180AD. Commodus, having succeeded his father Marcus Aurelius as Emperor, was exerting a tyrannical influence across the empire.

From November 2006, the playable area encompassed the southeastern portion of Caledonia which was termed in-game as a &quot;playfield&quot;. As discussed by RedBedlam, there were further plans to expand this playable area and to create other playfields in different regions of the ancient world, if the server population had increased enough to warrant such extensions. These may have included playfields such as Germania, Hispania, Italy and Gaul, or other areas of Britannia. The additional playfields were never added, nor were some parts of southeastern Caledonia advertised as being in Roma Victor at commercial launch, such as the Roman town of Luguvalium.

In the final state of the game, the Romans began life as a slave in the ancient regional town of Corstopitum over which modern Corbridge lies. Barbarians began in the village of Erring, directly north of Corstopitum.

== Gameplay ==

=== Playable area and factions ===

There were two factions in &quot;Roma Victor&quot;, the Romans and the barbarians. Each faction had its own unique advantages and disadvantages.

The playfield was divided in &quot;boards&quot;, areas with the size of one square kilometer in a 1:1 scale to the real world. Some of these boards were pre-built, but most were composed of uninhabitable wilderness. The pre-built boards represented the historical locations of Roman colonies and forts, although creative license was also used to create fictitious places. Wilderness boards could be made buildable if a guild hall was built on that board.

When a player character first began the game, they were in &quot;attending&quot; status which meant they could not attack or be attacked by other players. They could be deattended instantly by a player who was the local magistrate, or by completing a tutorial. The deattending command used by the local lord or magistrate was intended to be a tool to prevent griefers from abusing the protections of attending status. However, due to the extremely repetitive, redundant, and monotonous tutorial, player lords and magistrates were burdened with the duty of deattending thousands of players who preferred not to complete the tutorial.

=== Guilds ===

Guilds were player associations, or &quot;clans&quot; and formed the basis of much of the social structure in &quot;Roma Victor&quot;. Guilds in &quot;Roma Victor&quot; were exclusively made up of players—the numbers could be augmented by NPC members, which could be hired and assigned to various roles and tasks, such as protecting the guild&#x27;s members, carrying out assignments, or simply acting as a merchant on behalf of the guild.

Roman guild types included Auxiliary, Legion, Patron House and Patrician House. Barbarian guilds included Tribe and Warband, and there were also religious cult guilds which could contain both Roman and barbarian characters.

Every player also had their own household. Household was the collective term applied to all the buildings and NPCs owned, employed, and/or run by an individual player. There could be many buildings and NPCs within a household and using the built-in household management interface a player could set entry fees or rent fees on their property, assign NPCs to act as merchants or guards, summon NPCs as an escort, hire and dismiss staff, etc. NPCs were known to cause lag throughout the entire history of Roma Victor, to include significant adverse effects on game performance in the starter towns.

=== Skills and abilities ===

There were no character levels in &quot;Roma Victor&quot;. However, there was a &#x27;skill&#x27; tree which replaced this function. Character development in &quot;Roma Victor&quot; was designed to simulate real life. That is, if a player wished to improve a character&#x27;s woodcutting skill, this could only be accomplished by cutting trees down. From those trees, the player could then extract sticks and turn them into handles to train the character&#x27;s preparing skill. Those handles could then be used by a smith to make simple tools.

Most craftable items could be made and used by anyone, butthere were certain items, like the &quot;lorica segmentata&quot; armour, that could only be made and worn by legionaries. Several items, like the hideshirt, could only be made and worn by barbarians. There were no level or skill restrictions, but the resulting item quality suffered greatly when a character was not a master in the required skills to produce the item. A player wishing to make high-quality items had to train by practicing menial tasks requiring the involved skill. A large number of items were never made craftable, including several weapon types and a majority of armor types.

Skill areas in &quot;Roma Victor&quot; included carpentry, smithing, construction, combat, farming, animal handling and more. In the Roman faction, a slave character earned citizenship after gaining a certain number of skill masteries and reputations.

Many branches of the skill tree were never implemented.

=== Crafting ===

&quot;Roma Victor&quot; featured a crafting system, in which it was possible to find resources and components that could be put together using the related skills.

Every item in the Roma Victor universe had a current quality level and a maximum quality level. The current quality level decreased as the item was &quot;used&quot;; the maximum quality level decreased as the item was &quot;repaired&quot; (bringing the current quality back up to the maximum quality level). If one forgot to repair the item it would eventually break and be lost. A warning of breakage was issued randomly when quality reached a low level.

=== Construction ===

Construction was largely the same as crafting, only with the greater need of materials and skills. When building anything from simple devices through to complex buildings like workshops, it was important to have a ready supply of skilled labour and a good supply chain to finish the job. NPC labourers could be hired to speed up the entire process, however it was possible for individual players to also provide a helping hand. Labourers could also &quot;bulk-add&quot; handcart-loads full of easy-to-add items, such as firewood, or even bricks to lengthy projects.

&quot;Roma Victor&quot; featured an open-ended &#x27;sandbox&#x27;-style environment in which players could rent structures to live in, build their own, or let them out to other players. Any structure could be set as public or private.

The construction was basically divided between &quot;devices&quot; and &quot;structures&quot;. Devices were necessary in order to craft items, such as tools and weapons. Furnaces, workbenches, and kilns were examples of devices implemented during the last stages of the game. Structures were basically buildings that could serve as housing, storage areas, and advanced crafting workshops. Buildable player-made structures aside from guild halls included roundhouses, animal pens, arenas, workshops, and horreas. However, most advanced structures were never craftable by players. Tents could also be made as portable structures that could be transported in a character&#x27;s inventory before deployment.

=== Combat ===

Combat skills were structured in a similar manner to crafting skills, in that an untrained character was very unlikely to win in a fair fight against a highly trained character, regardless of player skill and reflexes. A character automatically dodged and parried incoming strikes based on randomized calculations on the server, although blocking with a shield had both an automatic calculation and would happen if the opponent accidentally clicked on the player&#x27;s shield. It was also possible to disarm an opponent&#x27;s weapon during a fight.

&quot;Roma Victor&quot; featured real-time combat, which was largely decided by character skills similar to the character &#x27;levels&#x27; found in most MMOs. However, unlike some other games, there were several tricks that were harder to pull off than just pushing a button. Timing and tactics also played a big role in your character&#x27;s survival.

&quot;Roma Victor&quot; had hitboxes for each bodypart on a player, so that clicking the attack button while aiming the mouse on a particular part of an opponent&#x27;s body would attempt to hit exactly that part of the body. After the character&#x27;s automatic chance to evade the attack based on skill numbers, the attack damage would be applied to the hit points in that bodypart if the calculations failed. In this way, a player could repeatedly click at the weak or unarmoured parts on an opponent.

=== Death and the afterlife ===

When the hitpoints of a particular bodypart reach zero, the player would become incapacitated. When incapacitated (i.e. knocked out) in combat, the player&#x27;s character would not necessarily die straight away. He would be unconscious on the ground for a variable time, unless someone administered basic aid or a killing blow. If someone administered first aid, the character would be back on his feet and ready to fight in a few seconds, albeit severely wounded. If a deathblow was administered, then the player was taken away from the combat to Elysium, a small area for dead players. In Elysium, the player had to walk toward an NPC that would return the character to a designated spawn-in spot on the main gameworld. If a player was deathblown and had high skills, they may suffer decay. Player kills dealt more skill loss than other forms of death.

The &quot;Roma Victor&quot; website claimed that after death the player character would have to navigate their way through &quot;fantastic landscapes, puzzles, physical challenges, demons and duels,&quot; varying in difficulty depending on the character&#x27;s badges and reputations (life decisions), but this was never implemented.

Being deathblown was not the only way to die in &quot;Roma Victor&quot;. Other means of dying included drowning in a river if the character ran out of vigour whilst still swimming, bleeding to death after receiving a fatal wound without proper medical treatment, and suicide. If a player wished to commit suicide in the game, they could do so at any time. One attribute (muscle, vision, agility, dexterity, intuition, or stamina) would be completely zeroed.

=== Roman provincial law ===

Certain areas were well-policed by NPC representatives of Roman law, such as legionaries, who would attempt to uphold the law and prevent violence. In Roman settlements, it was impossible to break the laws, while in others a player could break the law but the NPC guards would, regardless of location, know of the act and respond later. Offending players would receive a &quot;badge&quot; upon their characters marking them as a criminal. The badge would be removed upon death or after a set amount of time.

Barbarians north of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall were beyond the reach of the law altogether, so the barbarian lands were effectively a full PvP environment. There were no negative consequences for attacking other barbarians; aside from a reputation amongst fellow players.

== Subscription ==

There were no monthly subscription fees in &quot;Roma Victor&quot;. The game used a variant of the micropayment economic model, which consisted of buying in-game currency (known as sesterces) with real money through the &quot;VERM&quot; system. It was not possible to exchange virtual currency earned in-game into real world money.

== Development ==

&quot;Roma Victor&quot; was sporadically &#x27;in development&#x27; since its release in 2006. While there had been many patches and some new content added, features such as player-built roads and fortifications, territorial conquest, and mounts were not implemented. Even at the time that the game was shut down, more than 4 years after release, a large number of features advertised as being available at commercial launch were still not in the game, and along with other features later advertised as part of future updates, were never developed and implemented. There were also a number of known critical bugs in game that were not fixed.

The speed of development and regular lack of customer support or communication was attributed by the creators to a relatively low budget and small development team. However, RedBedlam staff often worked on Roma Victor on a voluntary or part-time basis, a fact that was hidden from the community until several years after commercial launch.

=== RV2 ===

&quot;RV2&quot;, an overhaul of the &quot;Roma Victor&quot; client featuring improved graphics and gameplay, was announced in August 2009 to be implemented sometime in 2010. The developers stated that existing customers would be transferred over to the new version without a fee, as would existing buildings, characters and their belongings.

In January 2010, it was announced that the current &quot;Roma Victor&quot; would be shutting down in May 2011. It was stated that &quot;RV2&quot; is still in development and may be released as soon as 2011. However, RedBedlam shut down the game in January 2011, almost 6 months early, without any prior announcement.

As of April 2021, RedBedlam had not released &quot;RV2&quot; nor mentioned any development of such a project on its website.

<doc id="867512" wikidata="Q7277424" url="?curid=867512" title="ROTOR">
<text>ROTOR was an elaborate air defence radar system built by the British Government in the early 1950s to counter possible attack by Soviet bombers. To get it operational as quickly as possible, it was initially made up primarily of WWII-era systems, notably the original Chain Home radars for the early warning role, and the AMES Type 7 for plotting and interception control. Data from these stations was sent to a network of control stations, mostly built underground, using an extensive telephone and telex network.

Work also began on a new microwave frequency radar to replace Chain Home . The experimental system Green Garlic was so successful that it began replacing Chain Home starting in 1954. In service, these proved so accurate that they could replace the Type 7 radars as well, and their greatly improved range meant that fewer radars would be needed to provide coverage over the entire United Kingdom. This led to the Master Radar Stations that filled both early warning and ground controlled interception roles. The original ROTOR plans for 66 radars was repeatedly reduced, ultimately only requiring half that number of stations. Many of the operations rooms, recently completed, were sold.

ROTOR called for the continual upgrading of the network over time, both the radars and the command and control systems. The introduction of the carcinotron radar jammer in the mid-1950s was a serious blow to these plans; a single aircraft carrying a carcinotron could jam the ROTOR radars so completely that they were rendered useless. At the same time, the introduction of the hydrogen bomb and ballistic missile greatly changed the nature of the strategic threat, and the idea of whole-country defence became untenable. The only way to defend against missile attacks was deterrence, and if that failed, interceptor aircraft and missiles would have no measurable effect on the eventual outcome.

ROTOR was initially to be replaced by a new network dedicated largely to defending the V-bomber force, the &quot;1958 Plan&quot;. This role was eventually abandoned, leaving only the task of locating aircraft carrying jammers to keep the BMEWS radars free from interference and prevent a successful sneak attack by missiles. Such a system did not require a large number of radars nor country-wide coverage. To reduce the cost of this much smaller network, studies on integrating the military radars with civilian air traffic control led to the Linesman/Mediator system of only five primary stations. The original ROTOR was replaced by Linesman in stages, starting in 1967.

A similar expedient system in the United States was the Lashup Radar Network.

==Post-war situation==
As the threat of German air attack became ever more remote, UK radar operations were wound down late in the war, and by the time the war ended were already largely unused. When the war ended, there was a general feeling that another war was at least ten years in the future. Given the rapid ongoing improvements in radar systems through this period, the Air Ministry felt there was no point introducing new radars that would likely become obsolete in a few years. They planned to allow radar to continue developing through this period and use the existing WWII-era systems in the meantime.

To consider the issue in more depth, the Cherry Report was commissioned in 1945. This report noted that the increasing speeds of new bombers, and especially future designs that were jet-powered, would travel across the plotting boards of the existing Dowding system so rapidly that they would fly off the maps before the interception could be arranged. The report suggested that a radar with range would be needed to replace the existing AMES Type 7/GCI systems, which were limited to about against bomber-sized targets. Estimating that such a radar would be available around 1957, the report suggested that existing GCI stations should receive upgraded antennas with more accuracy, new electronics for better performance, upgrades to their display systems, four Type 13&#x27;s for height measuring, and two Type 14 units for anti-jamming use. Additionally, their information would be sent to six new command centres, who would produce much larger maps of the airspace, up to across. Additionally, all of the sites would be upgraded with hardened bunkers to allow them to survive a near miss.

==New urgency==

The Berlin Blockade of July 1948 led to concerns about the next war&#x27;s estimated time-frame. A White Paper on the state of the network was completed in March 1949. This found that the stations were in a terrible state, with many of them suffering weather damage and a number of them having been broken into and vandalized. A complete defense would also require 1152 fighters and 265 AA regiments, of which only 352 fighters and 75 regiments were actually available. All of this was given extreme urgency with the 29 August 1949 test of the first Soviet atomic bomb. That month, a new directive stated RAF Fighter Command&#x27;s mission was the defense of Great Britain.

It was known that the Soviets had made exact copies of the B-29 Superfortress as the Tupolev Tu-4, and these aircraft had the performance needed to reach the UK with a nuclear payload. These were fast, but not fast enough to escape the existing radars if they were upgraded as the Cherry Report suggested. Most of the new network would be made up of 28 rebuilt Chain Home systems, while the rest were taken from the existing selection of Chain Home Low, Chain Home Extra Low and the various Ground-controlled interception (GCI) radars. This was, in part, a stop-gap measure anticipating the availability of the dramatically improved radar, which was now known as the Microwave Early Warning, which was expected in the 1957 time-frame. Interception guidance would still be handled by existing systems in either case.

All of the radars were to be improved in terms of siting, with the addition of hardened control bunkers to protect the operators from a conventional attack. On the east coast, where a Soviet attack would be most likely, the bunkers were underground in the &#x27;R&#x27; series (R1, R2, R3 and R4 etc.), while those on the western side of the UK were generally semi-sunken hardened structures (&#x27;R6&#x27;) or above ground &#x27;Secco&#x27; type huts (Hartland Point etc.). The R-series bunkers themselves were otherwise similar, featuring concrete walls with all equipment, operations generators and air conditioning located inside.

Additionally, ROTOR re-arranged the existing RAF Fighter Command structure into six &quot;Sector Operational Commands&quot; (SOC) with their own command bunkers (three level &#x27;R4&#x27; protected accommodation). Only four of these were built. Additional &quot;Anti-Aircraft Operations Rooms&quot; were built to coordinate the British Army&#x27;s AA defences in the same overall system. The entire network of bunkers, radars, fighter control and command centres used up 350,000 tons of concrete, 20,000 tons of steel and thousands of miles of telephone and telex connections.

The work was mainly carried out by the Marconi Wireless and Telegraph Company in several phases, called ROTOR 1, ROTOR 2 and ROTOR 3.

==Post-ROTOR==
As work on the Microwave Early Warning system began, researchers at the Royal Radar Establishment were experimenting with new cavity magnetrons and crystal detectors that, combined with a ad hoc antenna, increased the range of their existing microwave radars on the order of four times. While the resulting &quot;Green Garlic&quot; did not meet all of the requirements for the original MEW, it was close enough and would be available years earlier.

The decision was made to make the MEW a long-term development with additional features such as moving target indication while the Green Garlic would be mated to an enormous antenna that would give it range over . Installations, under the name AMES Type 80, began in 1954 with the first systems declared operational the next year. As installations continued, it was found that the accuracy was such that it could also be used to direct the interceptors, with no need to forward the information to the ROTOR control centres. By concentrating all of the plotting at a single site the total number of operators was greatly reduced.

As a result of the introduction of the Type 80, many of the existing ROTOR sites were rationalized into &quot;Master Radar Stations&quot; (MRS), while the rest were made redundant, some only two years after opening. During the same period, the introduction of the first surface-to-air missiles rendered the anti-aircraft guns obsolete, and the Army handed the air defence mission entirely to the RAF. All of the AAOR sites were closed.

A few of the ROTOR and AAOR stations were re-used for Regional Seats of Government or local authority wartime headquarters. Until the end of the Cold War, many of the sites were retained by the government. They were later sold to private buyers, converted into museums (for example Hack Green) or transferred to the National Air Traffic Control Centre.

==UK sites==

At the Radar Research Establishment in Malvern, Worcestershire a ROTOR bunker was constructed above ground to allow equipment to be tested in an operational environment. The building, locally designated as H Building, originally incorporated a replica of the sector operations centre at RAF Bawburgh. The building was demolished June 2020.

==The sites today==
RAF Staxton Wold is the only Chain Home site still used as a military radar site but with no remains of the CH station on site after being rebuilt for Linesman/Mediator in 1964. Today it is the former home of an RAF TPS 77 RRH (remote radar head).

RAF Boulmer is a working RAF building, which is housed in an ex-&quot;ROTOR&quot; R3 
RAF Boulmer (&#x27;EZS&#x27;) GCI R3 ROTOR Radar Station &amp; Control and Reporting Centre in the UK Air Surveillance and Control System.

In terms of current condition, the ROTOR sites vary from demolished to intact.

For example, West Myne in Somerset was the last ROTOR 3 CHEL site. It was completed in 1957 after the introduction of the Type 80 radar and after many ROTOR stations had already closed. The site was within Exmoor National Park and its creation was strenuously opposed by the National Trust who lost no time in obliterating the site immediately after closure.

Many of the buildings have been re-purposed since being active as ROTOR sites. An example is the Bawburgh R4 SOC which was re-purposed as SRHQ4.1 and then RGHQ4.1 to suit the evolving needs of government. The building is intact, but it has been significantly reconfigured since its use as a ROTOR SOC, notably with the addition of an extra floor and the flooring-over of the original R4 operations well.

July 2019; Kent Underground Exploration are starting talks with TDC hoping to be given access to find and uncover the Foreness, Kent station which grid ref is TR 385710

<text>William Radford [ – ] was a rear admiral of the United States Navy who served during the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War, in which he remained loyal to the Union, despite his Virginia birth. Radford commanded the Ironclad Division in the attacks on Fort Fisher (December 1864/January 1865) to assert Union control of Cape Fear.
==Ancestry and early life==
On December 23, 1806, John Radford [ – ] married Harriet Kennerly [ – ] in Fincastle, Virginia, at Santillane, the estate of her uncle George Hancock. On or after January 5, 1807, William Clark arrived at Greenfield, the estate of army buddy William Preston, missing Harriet&#x27;s wedding. Instead, Clark asked George Hancock for Julia Hancock&#x27;s hand in marriage. John and Harriet remained in Fincastle to attend the January 25, 1807, marriage between William and Julia (Harriet&#x27;s cousin). Then they departed in that spring for Lewis County, Kentucky to live on their 1,000-acre farm between Vanceburg and Concord on the bank of the Ohio River, where William and his two siblings were born.

In 1817, John Radford was killed by the wild boar he was hunting. Widow Harriet moved her three children to join her brothers and first cousin in Saint Louis, Missouri. The Radfords resided with her brother James Kennerly.

Julia Clark succumbed on June 27, 1820. Widower William Clark married Harriet November 28, 1821 in Saint Louis and adopted the Radford children and then added to their combined family:
* Harriet Clark [dates unknown; died as infant].
* Jefferson Kearny Clark [ – ]
* Edmund Clark [ – ]

After his mother&#x27;s second marriage, Radford initially refused to move into the Clark house, so he was sent to a school in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, where he became acquainted with the sea. He asked stepfather William Clark for a recommendation to the U.S. Navy. Clark sent a personal request to President John Quincy Adams. There is a discrepancy about William&#x27;s birthdate, with some references giving it as March 1, 1808, but that date was provided to the Navy because William was underage. Family records and the U.S. Federal Census forms support the 1809 date.

William Clark&#x27;s diaries mention Radford accompanying him in 1824 from Saint Louis to Washington, D.C. Before returning home, they diverted to New York City to observe the hero&#x27;s welcome for Marquis de Lafayette. On April 29, 1825, Lafayette paid a visit to Saint Louis, where William Clark hosted his stay and introduced Radford, none aware that Radford would be a member of the crew sailing Lafayette back to France.

Radford embarked upon another Clark trip to Washington, D.C., in the fall of 1828. An excursion in early January 1829 to visit stepbrother Meriwether Lewis Clark at West Point was abandoned due to ice floes on the Hudson River. After witnessing the inauguration of President Andrew Jackson they returned to Saint Louis.

==Mediterranean and West Indies Squadrons==

Radford was accepted March 1, 1825 into the United States Navy as a midshipman. He reported 1 August 1825 to Captain Charles Morris for duty aboard at Washington Navy Yard. While the ship normally carried only 8 to 10 midshipmen, President Adams appointed a total of 24, to represent each state, per the request of Lafayette for his return to France. Radford represented the state of Missouri.

Lafayette was delivered to Le Havre on October 9, 1825. From there &quot;Brandywine&quot; was attached to the Mediterranean Squadron under Commodore John Rodgers. Upon the departure of &quot;Brandywine&quot; February 25, 1826, Radford transferred to to remain in the Mediterranean monitoring the Greek War of Independence and coup against the Janissaries. Rodgers was succeeded by Commodore William Crane March 30, 1827. &quot;Constitution&quot;, in need of major repairs, was recalled to Boston Navy Yard arriving on July 4, 1828.

Radford returned to Saint Louis and received orders August 10, 1829, to join at Norfolk Naval Shipyard for deployment to the West Indies Squadron commanded by Commodore Charles Ridgely. Radford was promoted to passed midshipman June 4, 1831 and reported for duty in Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. In September 1831, he requested a six-month leave and was with his mother Harriet when she died December 25, 1831, Christmas Day. He was then entered into a furlough due to the general stagnation of naval affairs.

Radford was assigned to the receiving ship at Philadelphia in February 1834. Then in June 1834 he returned to the Mediterranean Squadron aboard as the acting Master. He suffered an attack of cholera in November 1834 and was sent ashore to recover in the south of France. Still afflicted in January 1836, he was in New Orleans, Louisiana, and, during October 1836, was recuperating at the home of his uncle William Radford II in Lynchburg, Virginia.

On February 9, 1837, Radford was appointed lieutenant. In September he rejoined the West Indies Squadron, reporting to Commodore Alexander Dallas and fighting in the second Seminole War. The maiden voyage of took Radford to Labrador in June 1840. In November, he returned for a third tour with the Mediterranean Squadron, Commodore Isaac Hull in charge. On March 6, 1841, due to the Oregon Question, Radford was summoned to New York via &quot;Brandywine&quot;.

Radford traveled May 1841 to Norfolk for duty on . On December 20, 1841, he received as his first command and delivered her from New York to the Rendezvous at New Orleans where she was employed as a receiving ship. Relieved of recruitment detail in August 1843, he was ordered on board the inaugural cruise of where she became the flagship of the Pacific Squadron for Commodore Alexander Dallas.

==Pacific Squadron==

Radford was attached April 24, 1844, to and visited Society Islands, Sandwich Islands and the western coastline of the Americas. Commodore Dallas died at Callao, Peru and was replaced by Commodore John Sloat. Radford&#x27;s January 1845 letter to brother-in-law Stephen Kearny predicted California &quot;can never be a very densely populated country&quot; and Oregon &quot;is not a very desirable country&quot; yet &quot;we should and ought by rights to have some possessions on the Pacific&quot;. He also mentions that &quot;dysentery killed seven of the crew&quot; and that &quot;I was dangerously ill myself&quot;.

By May 1845 at Callao, he was again debilitated by dysentery to a degree where ship surgeons recommended he should be removed from the ship &quot;to a more favorable climate&quot;. However, he remained aboard and, through mid-1845, patrolled the California coast where rumor of war with Mexico was rife.

Reaching Honolulu October 4, 1845, orders were received that once Mexico declared war, the squadron should &quot;blockade or occupy such ports as force might permit&quot;. &quot;Warren&quot; set return sail on October 16 to Mazatlán to await the onset of war. Months passed until June 6, 1846, when confirmation arrived from William Maxwell Wood that land war had commenced. &quot;Warren&quot; remained at Mazatlán as the other ships of the squadron captured ports along the California coast, generally with the inhabitants cooperating. English warships, also awaiting news of war, reacted too late to offer their protectorate flags to Mexico.

&quot;Warren&quot; left Mazatlán with dispatches from Washington, D.C. and arrived at Monterey on August 17, 1846, to find Commodore Robert Stockton in charge of the Pacific Squadron. Ordered back to resume the blockade of Mazatlán, &quot;Warren&quot; arrived early morning of September 7 to find the Mexican warship &quot;Malek Adhel&quot; in the harbor. Radford commanded the boarding party which inserted during the siesta hour and securely fastened the hatches while the entire crew was below deck. Over the course of the next months, &quot;13 or 14&quot; additional ships were captured by the blockade, eliminating further threat from the Mexican Navy.

Despite the ease of the Conquest of California for the Navy, hostilities continued on land until a flag of truce was delivered by residents of Los Angeles on January 10, 1847. General Stephen Kearny paid a visit February 17, 1847, to his brother-in-law at Yerba Buena. After nearly four years abroad, Radford was granted leave to depart May 31, 1847, for home overland with Kearny and his troops.

==New York and East India Squadron==
Radford arrived back in Saint Louis on August 28, 1847. He was ordered December 20, 1847, to testify in the court-martial of John C. Frémont at the Washington Arsenal. A leave was approved March 2, 1848, which indicated Radford intended to revisit Mexico with General Kearny but his letter of July 3, 1848, was sent from New York requesting a three-month extension. He went to see his cousin William Preston Griffin at Morristown, New Jersey, met Mary Lovell, married her and settled there. He commuted to his assignment at the Rendezvous in New York through January 21, 1851.

On July 26, 1851, Radford took command of and sailed again to the Pacific Squadron. By March 1852 he arrived in San Francisco where he met with brother John and brother-in-law Benjamin Lovell. On the way home, a letter from his father-in-law Joseph Lovell advised that Radford&#x27;s infant son, Willie, had died. Detached from &quot;Lexington&quot; on September 22, 1852, Radford returned to Morristown.

For the period 1852 until 1860, Radford was assigned shore duties in New York despite his applications for a command. For three years, he worked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and witnessed for numerous courts-martial. In June 1855, he was given command of U.S. steamer &quot;City of Boston&quot; to prevent ships connected with filibustering expeditions from leaving the harbor. On July 20 he was appointed a member of a committee to &quot;examine and report on the different Life Boats.&quot; Finally, Radford had a brief stint as Inspector of the Third Lighthouse District. During these years, he again shuttled from his residence in Morristown.

Radford was fortunate to receive a commission as commander September 14, 1855. Throughout 1855 and early 1856, promotions were at a standstill in the Navy partly due to the shortage of ships. Many officers were given leave to take command of merchant ships (such as U.S. Mail steamers) at significantly higher pay. To overcome this quandary, a Naval Retiring Board was formed which upset the older officers but cheered younger members of the service.

He took command of April 23, 1860, and sailed to Hong Kong as a unit of the East India Squadron for Commodore Cornelius Stribling. However, after the onset of the Civil War, both Radford and Stribling were relieved of their commands and ordered to return Washington, D.C. despite their declarations of allegiance to the Union. Commodore Samuel Du Pont in Washington, D.C. explained to Radford&#x27;s wife Mary that, with the number of defections from both the Army and Navy, all officers from slave states must be evaluated for risk. Radford arrived home October 12, 1861, seriously ill with smallpox but recovered quickly. After an interview with Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, he was reappointed Inspector of the Third Lighthouse District at New York.

==Civil War==

On February 8, 1862, Radford accepted command of . He was aboard as a member of a Naval Board of Inquiry March 8, 1862, when his ship was sunk by the Confederate ram during the Battle of Hampton Roads.

A Naval Board convened in April 1862 at the Naval Academy Preparatory School with Radford as a member. He received, June 10, 1862, temporary duty as Executive Officer of Brooklyn Navy Yard under command of Rear Admiral Hiram Paulding. The assignment stretched into almost two years of equipping and fitting-out hundreds of vessels for the Navy. Radford received promotion to captain July 16, 1862, and then to commodore April 24, 1863.

On May 15, 1864, Radford was directed to report to Rear Admiral John Dahlgren at Philadelphia for command of the armored ship . Upon arrival it was determined the ship required repairs so Radford was relieved and ordered to a Naval Board in Washington, D.C. during July 1864. He was recommitted to on August 16, 1864, and joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Hampton Roads. Rear Admiral David Porter assembled a fleet to attack Fort Fisher for the control of Cape Fear River. He placed Radford in command of the Ironclad Division, consisting of flagship , , , , and during attacks on Fort Fisher in December 1864 and in January 1865. David Porter commended Radford&#x27;s support for the Union forces ashore and eight members of his crew were awarded the Medal of Honor.

&quot;New Ironsides&quot; sailed January 24, 1865, up the James River to Bermuda Hundred to protect the stores of the Army of the Potomac from a threatened raid by Confederate rams during the siege of Petersburg. Radford took charge of the flotilla assembled there and coordinated with Generals Ulysses Grant and Edward Ord. Radford transferred his flag to when &quot;New Ironsides&quot; was sent to Norfolk Naval yard February 18, 1865, for repairs. With the end of war near, &quot;Dumbarton&quot; departed from the James River March 22, 1865, and officers and crew were detached upon arrival at the Washington Navy Yard.

On April 4, 1865, Radford sailed from Washington, D.C. up the James River and arrived at City Point, Virginia, the next evening. From there, he conveyed Vice President Andrew Johnson and Preston King to Richmond, Virginia, and back. President Abraham Lincoln was already in Richmond, unaccompanied by any of his Cabinet, to witness the downfall of the Confederate stronghold. He became agitated about the Johnson and King arrival and ordered Radford to keep both of his passengers elsewhere. While moored for two days, Radford discovered stepbrother Meriwether Clark was a prisoner of war and brought him aboard &quot;Phlox&quot; to await release.

==North Atlantic and European Squadrons==

Commodore Radford was appointed April 28, 1865, to command the North Atlantic Squadron as Acting Rear Admiral. He transferred his flag May 15, 1865, from &quot;Phlox&quot; to , which remained his flagship during his tenure. He was called October 10, 1865, to oversee the Washington Navy Yard. He moved his wife, two daughters and three sons from New Jersey to a Washington, D.C. home in November.

In March 1866, Radford was elected as a companion of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. He was promoted to rear admiral on July 25, 1866.

Radford left Washington January 20, 1869, with his family in tow and arrived in New York to embark on to Lisbon, Portugal. After seventeen days of stormy passage, Radford arrived to take charge of the European Squadron and found all attached vessels, , , , and , lying at anchor in the harbor waiting for his orders.

As Radford performed his duties, his family traveled with him on &quot;Franklin&quot; to Spain, Algiers, France, the Netherlands and Italy. During 1870, the children attended school at Lausanne, Switzerland. A month after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Radford relinquished his command August 10, 1870, to Rear Admiral Oliver Glisson. He travelled to Lausanne to retrieve his children believing any battles would be distant. After arrival in Paris, the surrender of the French Army on September 2, 1870, caused the Radford family to flee the advancing Prussian Army. At Havre they negotiated commercial passage to the United States.

Radford was listed by the Navy as retired on March 1, 1870. However, from October 1, 1870, through the next two years, he served on several Naval Boards of Inquiry chaired by Rear Admiral Joseph Smith, Rear Admiral Theodorus Bailey and Vice Admiral Stephen Rowan.

==Marriage and family==
Radford married Mary &quot;Minnie&quot; Elizabeth Lovell [ – ] in St. Peter&#x27;s Church, Morristown, New Jersey November 3, 1848. The ceremony was overcast due to the death of brother-in-law Stephen Kearny a few days before. The Radfords resided on Mount Kemble Avenue for almost twenty years in a house previously owned by John Doughty.

Children of William and Elizabeth (all born in Morristown, New Jersey except Henry who was born in Washington, D.C.) were: Mary Lovell Radford; William Radford; Sophie Adelaide Radford; Stephen Kearny Radford; George Reginald Radford; Edmund Ironsides Radford; and Henry Carlton Radford.

Daughter Sophie became a writer including a play produced on Broadway and her father&#x27;s biography &quot;Old Naval Days&quot;.

Son George Reginald and grandson William Radford Coyle (from daughter Mary Lovell Radford Coyle&#x27;s lineage) married sisters. Mary and Jane Dodson respectively were daughters of Weston Dodson, founder of Weston Dodson &amp; Company in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Coyle served three terms from Pennsylvania as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Granddaughter Mary Lovell Radford (from son Stephen Kearny Radford&#x27;s lineage), on April 5, 1918, during World War I, launched , a named for her grandfather.

Granddaughter Edith Lovell Coyle (from daughter Mary Lovell Radford Coyle&#x27;s lineage) married François E. Matthes. On May 13, 1942, during World War II, she launched the , a in the United States Navy named for her grandfather.

Great-granddaughter (from son Stephen Kearny Radford&#x27;s lineage) Rosemary Radford Ruether pioneered feminist theology.

Radford died on January 8, 1890. He was interred at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

==Legacy==
When the &quot;Brandywine&quot; arrived in France in 1825, Radford purchased a set of dining room chairs which he shipped back to the Clark household in St. Louis, Missouri. The Clark family referred to them as the &quot;Lafayette Chairs&quot; per the trip&#x27;s famous passenger.

Radford, as a witness, signed at least three treaties between the United States and American Indian nations. He had attended the ceremonies with stepfather William Clark, who was serving as Superintendent of Indian Affairs.

Radford built an elegant Victorian mansion during 1875 at 1736 (now 1734) N Street NW in the DuPont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. It is now the General Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs Headquarters.

<text>Tired light is a class of hypothetical redshift mechanisms that was proposed as an alternative explanation for the redshift-distance relationship. These models have been proposed as alternatives to the models that involve the expansion of the universe. The concept was first proposed in 1929 by Fritz Zwicky, who suggested that if photons lost energy over time through collisions with other particles in a regular way, the more distant objects would appear redder than more nearby ones.

Zwicky acknowledged that any sort of scattering of light would blur the images of distant objects more than what is seen. Additionally, the surface brightness of galaxies evolving with time, time dilation of cosmological sources, and a thermal spectrum of the cosmic microwave background have been observed—these effects should not be present if the cosmological redshift was due to any tired light scattering mechanism. Despite periodic re-examination of the concept, tired light has not been supported by observational tests and remains a fringe topic in astrophysics.

==History and reception==

Tired light was an idea that came about due to the observation made by Edwin Hubble that distant galaxies have redshifts proportional to their distance. Redshift is a shift in the spectrum of the emitted electromagnetic radiation from an object toward lower energies and frequencies, associated with the phenomenon of the Doppler effect. Observers of spiral nebulae such as Vesto Slipher observed that these objects (now known to be separate galaxies) generally exhibited redshift rather than blueshifts independent of where they were located. Since the relation holds in all directions it cannot be attributed to normal movement with respect to a background which would show an assortment of redshifts and blueshifts. Everything is moving &quot;away&quot; from the Milky Way galaxy. Hubble&#x27;s contribution was to show that the magnitude of the redshift correlated strongly with the distance to the galaxies.

Basing on Slipher&#x27;s and Hubble&#x27;s data, in 1927 Georges Lemaître realized that this correlation could fit non-static solutions to the equations of Einstein&#x27;s theory of gravity, the Friedmann–Lemaître solutions. However Lemaître&#x27;s article was appreciated only after Hubble&#x27;s publication of 1929. The universal redshift-distance relation in this solution is attributable to the effect an expanding universe has on a photon traveling on a null spacetime interval (also known as a &quot;light-like&quot; geodesic). In this formulation, there was still an analogous effect to the Doppler effect, though relative velocities need to be handled with more care since distances can be defined in different ways in an expanding universe.

At the same time, other explanations were proposed that did not concord with general relativity. Edward Milne proposed an explanation compatible with special relativity but not general relativity that there was a giant explosion that could explain redshifts (see Milne universe). Others proposed that systematic effects could explain the redshift-distance correlation. Along this line, Fritz Zwicky proposed a &quot;tired light&quot; mechanism in 1929. Zwicky suggested that photons might slowly lose energy as they travel vast distances through a static universe by interaction with matter or other photons, or by some novel physical mechanism. Since a decrease in energy corresponds to an increase in light&#x27;s wavelength, this effect would produce a redshift in spectral lines that increase proportionally with the distance of the source. The term &quot;tired light&quot; was coined by Richard Tolman in the early 1930s as a way to refer to this idea. Helge Kragh has noted &quot;Zwicky’s hypothesis was the best known and most elaborate alternative to the expanding universe, but it was far from the only one. More than a dozen physicists, astronomers and amateur scientists proposed in the 1930s tired-light ideas having in common the assumption of nebular photons interacting with intergalactic matter to which they transferred part of their energy.&quot; Kragh noted in particular John Quincy Stewart, William Duncan MacMillan, and Walther Nernst.

Tired light mechanisms were among the proposed alternatives to the Big Bang and the Steady State cosmologies, both of which relied on the general relativistic expansion of the universe of the FRW metric. Through the middle of the twentieth century, most cosmologists supported one of these two paradigms, but there were a few scientists, especially those who were working on alternatives to general relativity, who worked with the tired light alternative. As the discipline of observational cosmology developed in the late twentieth century and the associated data became more numerous and accurate, the Big Bang emerged as the cosmological theory most supported by the observational evidence, and it remains the accepted consensus model with a current parametrization that precisely specifies the state and evolution of the universe. Although the proposals of &quot;tired light cosmologies&quot; are now more-or-less relegated to the dustbin of history, as a completely alternative proposal tired-light cosmologies were considered a remote possibility worthy of some consideration in cosmology texts well into the 1980s, though it was dismissed as an unlikely and &quot;ad hoc&quot; proposal by mainstream astrophysicists.
By the 1990s and on into the twenty-first century, a number of falsifying observations have shown that &quot;tired light&quot; hypotheses are not viable explanations for cosmological redshifts. For example, in a static universe with tired light mechanisms, the surface brightness of stars and galaxies should be constant, that is, the farther an object is, the less light we receive, but its apparent area diminishes as well, so the light received divided by the apparent area should be constant. In an expanding universe, the surface brightness diminishes with distance. As the observed object recedes, photons are emitted at a reduced rate because each photon has to travel a distance that is a little longer than the previous one, while its energy is reduced a little because of increasing redshift at a larger distance. On the other hand, in an expanding universe, the object appears to be larger than it really is, because it was closer to us when the photons started their travel. This causes a difference in surface brilliance of objects between a static and an expanding Universe. This is known as the Tolman surface brightness test that in those studies favors the expanding universe hypothesis and rules out static tired light models.

Redshift is directly observable and used by cosmologists as a direct measure of lookback time. They often refer to age and distance to objects in terms of redshift rather than years or light-years. In such a scale, the Big Bang corresponds to a redshift of infinity. Alternative theories of gravity that do not have an expanding universe in them need an alternative to explain the correspondence between redshift and distance that is &quot;sui generis&quot; to the expanding metrics of general relativity. Such theories are sometimes referred to as &quot;tired-light cosmologies&quot;, though not all authors are necessarily aware of the historical antecedents.

==Specific falsified models==

In general, any &quot;tired light&quot; mechanism must solve some basic problems, in that the observed redshift must:
*admit the same measurement in any wavelength-band
*not exhibit blurring
*follow the detailed Hubble relation observed with supernova data (see accelerating universe)
*explain associated time dilation of cosmologically distant events.

A number of tired light mechanisms have been suggested over the years. Fritz Zwicky, in his paper proposing these models investigated a number of redshift explanations, ruling out some himself. The simplest form of a tired light theory assumes an exponential decrease in photon energy with distance traveled:formula_1where formula_2 is the energy of the photon at distance formula_3 from the source of light, formula_4 is the energy of the photon at the source of light, and formula_5 is a large constant characterizing the &quot;resistance of the space&quot;. To correspond to Hubble&#x27;s law, the constant formula_5 must be several gigaparsecs. For example, Zwicky considered whether an integrated Compton effect could account for the scale normalization of the above model:

This expected &quot;blurring&quot; of cosmologically distant objects is not seen in the observational evidence, though it would take much larger telescopes than those available at that time to show this with certainty. Alternatively, Zwicky proposed a kind of Sachs–Wolfe effect explanation for the redshift distance relation:

Zwicky&#x27;s proposals were carefully presented as falsifiable according to later observations:

Such broadening of absorption lines is not seen in high-redshift objects, thus falsifying this particular hypothesis.

Zwicky also notes, in the same paper, that according to a tired light model a distance-redshift relationship would necessarily be present in the light from sources within our own galaxy (even if the redshift would be so small that it would be hard to measure), that do not appear under a recessional-velocity based theory. He writes, referring to sources of light within our galaxy: &quot;It is especially desirable to determine the redshift independent of the proper velocities of the objects observed&quot;. Subsequent to this, astronomers have patiently mapped out the three-dimensional velocity-position phase space for the galaxy and found the redshifts and blueshifts of galactic objects to accord well with the statistical distribution of a spiral galaxy, eliminating the intrinsic redshift component as an effect.

Following after Zwicky in 1935, Edwin Hubble and Richard Tolman compared recessional redshift with a non-recessional one, writing that they

 These conditions became almost impossible to meet and the overall success of general relativistic explanations for the redshift-distance relation is one of the core reasons that the Big Bang model of the universe remains the cosmology preferred by researchers.

In the early 1950s, Erwin Finlay-Freundlich proposed a redshift as &quot;the result of loss of energy by observed photons traversing a radiation field&quot;. which was cited and argued for as an explanation for the redshift-distance relation in a 1962 astrophysics theory &quot;Nature&quot; paper by University of Manchester physics professor P. F. Browne. The pre-eminent cosmologist Ralph Asher Alpher wrote a letter to &quot;Nature&quot; three months later in response to this suggestion heavily criticizing the approach, &quot;No generally accepted physical mechanism has been proposed for this loss.&quot; Still, until the so-called &quot;Age of Precision Cosmology&quot; was ushered in with results from the WMAP space probe and modern redshift surveys, tired light models could occasionally get published in the mainstream journals, including one that was published in the February 1979 edition of &quot;Nature&quot; proposing &quot;photon decay&quot; in a curved spacetime that was five months later criticized in the same journal as being wholly inconsistent with observations of the gravitational redshift observed in the solar limb. In 1986, a paper claiming tired light theories explained redshift better than cosmic expansion was published in the &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot;, but ten months later, in the same journal, such tired light models were shown to be inconsistent with extant observations. As cosmological measurements became more precise and the statistics in cosmological data sets improved, tired light proposals ended up being falsified, to the extent that the theory was described in 2001 by science writer Charles Seife as being &quot;firmly on the fringe of physics 30 years ago; still, scientists sought more direct proofs of the expansion of the cosmos&quot;.

<doc id="867516" wikidata="Q651186" url="?curid=867516" title="Gordon Brown (rugby union)">
<text>Gordon Lamont Brown (1 November 1947 – 19 March 2001) was a Scottish rugby union footballer. Nicknamed &quot;Broon frae Troon&quot; (i.e. Brown from Troon, his home town), Brown is considered one of Scotland&#x27;s greatest-ever rugby players. Playing as a second row forward, he was an integral part of Scotland&#x27;s tight five during the early 1970s, along with Ian McLauchlan, Sandy Carmichael, Frank Laidlaw and Alastair McHarg, which became known collectively as the Mean Machine. He also represented the British and Irish Lions on three tours with distinction. Brown was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 2001, which later integrated with the World Rugby Hall of Fame, into which he was inducted in 2015. He was also an inductee to the Scottish Rugby Union Hall of Fame in 2010.

==Family==
Brown was from a sporting family, his elder brother Peter also played for and captained the Scottish side. His father, John played goalkeeper for the Scottish football side and also appeared in the Scottish Open at Royal Troon alongside golfing greats such as Arnold Palmer.

He is also the nephew of footballers Tom and Jim Brown.

Speaking of the brothers Brown, he thinks their skill was in their genes, but that Peter and Gordon were very different:
==Rugby==
A product of Marr College and West of Scotland, Brown won his first cap for Scotland on 6 December 1969 against South Africa in a 6–3 victory at Murrayfield Stadium. He retained his place for the Five Nations opener against France but was dropped for the Wales match for his brother Peter. Gordon Brown then went on to replace Peter Brown at half-time due to injury, and this was the first time a brother replaced a brother in an international match.

He was selected on the 1971 British Lions tour to New Zealand and despite two other second row forwards travelling, Brown achieved test selection. He went on the 1974 British Lions tour to South Africa where he won five caps, and partnered Willie John McBride in the engine room of the scrum, during which he scored a remarkable eight tries and won a further 3 caps. He went on a third tour and played in a non-cap match against Fiji at the end of the 1977 British Lions tour to New Zealand.

A major criticism of Brown was that he played better for the British Lions than his own country. Although, on a Lions tour he was given the ability to live and train as a full-time rugby player and, with world class teammates.
Unfortunately his International rugby career came to a somewhat inauspicious end. In December, 1976, he was playing in a match between Glasgow and the North-Midlands, he was suspended for three months after getting into a fight with Allan Hardie, in which Brown chased Hardie, threw him to the ground and kicked him. Prior to this, Hardie had kneed Brown in the face and proceed to stamp on the open wound on Brown&#x27;s brow after the initial attack went unnoticed by the referee. The suspension meant that he missed three internationals and was banned from training at any rugby club. He trained daily at Ibrox stadium under the guidance of Jock Wallace of Rangers who put him through a gruelling fitness regime. Gordon remembered being made to sprint up and down the terraces at Ibrox until he was sick. After missing three months of rugby he was selected for the British Lions tour of New Zealand 1977. Because of a string of injuries, he never played for Scotland again. LP

==Death==
Gordon Brown died from non-Hodgkin lymphoma aged 53 in March 2001. His funeral was attended by former Scotland and Lions teammates and opponents from the whole rugby world.

As reported by The Daily Telegraph, at a fundraising dinner held in late February 2001 for Brown due to his illness, he met with de Bruyn again.

<text>Shell Canada Limited () is the principal Canadian subsidiary of British energy major Shell plc and one of Canada&#x27;s largest integrated oil companies. Exploration and production of oil, natural gas and sulphur is a major part of its business, as well as the marketing of gasoline and related products through the company&#x27;s approximately 1,800 stations across Canada.

After a global reorganization by the European parent, Shell&#x27;s North American operations are controlled by Shell Energy North America, which is headquartered in Houston, Texas. Shell Energy North America&#x27;s Canadian operational unit, Shell Canada, maintains a regional corporate office in Calgary, Alberta. Shell Canada also maintains a major office in Toronto, Ontario.

==History==
Shell Canada&#x27;s shares were originally independently traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company was 78% owned by Royal Dutch Shell which in 2006 launched an $8.7-billion takeover of the 22% of Shell Canada that it didn&#x27;t own. In March 2007 the shareholders of Shell Canada Ltd. accepted a $45.00 per share cash offer from Royal Dutch Shell plc. This acquisition was primarily driven by the desire of the parent company to take total control of its Canadian division&#x27;s unconventional resources, specifically the oil sands. The move was unanimously approved by the independent members of the board of directors.

In 2003, Royal Dutch Shell had appointed a British executive, and former chairman of Shell in the UK, Clive Mather, as president and CEO of Shell Canada.

As a consequence of the stock acquisition by Royal Dutch Shell, all Shell Canada executives holding stock options benefitted. Shell Canada announced on Mather&#x27;s retirement from the company shortly after the acquisition was completed that his total pay package for his final year (2006–2007) was $4.9 million including bonuses, stock options and pension contributions and that on leaving the company, Mather was additionally eligible for a lump sum payment equal to his annual gross salary. His total benefit in that year was, therefore $9.8 million of which some $5 million was from exercised stock options, making him one of the highest remunerated employees in Royal Dutch Shell.

In 2006, Shell Canada acquired the oil sands developer BlackRock Ventures Inc. for $2.4 billion. As part of this deal, Shell acquired the Orion oil-sands project near Cold Lake, Alberta. In May 2012, Shell announced that it has put the project up for sale.

In 2007, the company invested $20 million into an expansion at the Brockville Lubricant Plant. In January 2019, it announced plans to invest a further $16 million towards new equipment that will increase production and efficiency.

In November 2015, the Shell Canada Quest Energy project began commercial operations. Part of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project, it involves Shell as the major shareholder (60%), Chevron Canada Limited (20%), and Marathon Canadian Oil Sands Holding Limited (20%). It is identified as being the first commercial-scale CCS project, proposing to reduce CO2 emissions in Canada by 1 million tonnes per year.

In April 2017, the company completed an expansion project at the Scotford refinery, growing hydrocracker production by 20%.

==Management and employees==

The current Shell Canada directors are Susannah Pierce (President and Country Chair), Leanne Gawley (Vice President and Controller), Andrew Harris (Vice President), Barry Tyndall (Vice President, General Counsel and Assistant Secretary) and Zoe Yujnovich (Executive Vice President).

In October 2008, Shell Canada Limited was named one of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Top 100 Employers&quot; by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; news magazine. Later that month, Shell Canada was also named one of Alberta&#x27;s Top Employers, which was announced by the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; and the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot;.

<doc id="867520" wikidata="Q846103" url="?curid=867520" title="Encyclopaedia Judaica">
<text>The Encyclopaedia Judaica is a multi-volume English-language encyclopedia of the Jewish people, Judaism, and Israel. It covers diverse areas of the Jewish world and civilization, including Jewish history of all eras, culture, holidays, language, scripture, and religious teachings. First published in 1971–1972, by 2010 it had been published in two editions accompanied by a few revisions.

The &quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica&quot; was also published on CD-ROM. The CD-ROM version has been enhanced by at least 100,000 hyperlinks and several other features, including videos, slide shows, maps, music and Hebrew pronunciations. While the CD-ROM version is still available, the publisher has discontinued producing new copies for sale.

The encyclopedia was written by Israeli, American and European professional subject specialists.

==History==
===Preceding attempts===
Between 1901 and 1906 &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; had been published in 12 volumes, and was heavily used as a source by the 16-volume &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, published by Brockhaus and Efron in Saint Petersburg (1906–1913, in Russian). It was followed by the &quot;Jüdisches Lexikon I–II&quot; (1927–28, in German), &quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica I–II&quot; (1927–28) and &quot;Zsidó Lexikon&quot; (1929, edited by Újvári Péter, in Hungarian).

An unfinished German-language &quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica&quot; was published by Nahum Goldmann&#x27;s Eshkol Publishing Society in Berlin 1928–1934. The chief editors were Jakob Klatzkin and Ismar Elbogen. Ten volumes from &quot;Aach&quot; to &quot;Lyra&quot; appeared before the project halted due to Nazi persecutions. Two Hebrew-language volumes &quot;A-Antipas&quot;, were also published under the title &quot;Eshkol&quot; (Hebrew: &quot;אשכול&quot;). A few of the articles from the German &quot;Judaica&quot; and even some of the reparations payments to Goldmann were used in making the English-language &quot;Judaica&quot;.

===First edition===
The English-language &quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica&quot; was first published from 1971 to 1972 in sixteen volumes, in Jerusalem by Keter Publishing House, and in New York City by the Macmillan Company. Between 1973 and 1991 eight &quot;Year Books&quot; were published (dated 1973, 1974, 1975–76, 1977–78, 1983–85, 1986–87, 1988–89, and 1990–91) along with two &quot;Decennial&quot; volumes dated 1973–1982 (also published as &quot;Volume 17&quot;) and 1983–1992. Together these volumes contained more than 15 million words in over 25,000 articles.

Its general editors were, successively, Cecil Roth and Geoffrey Wigoder. Advertisers describe it as the result of about three decades of study and research by about 2,200 contributors and 250 editors around the world. Contributors included Gershom Scholem.

A &quot;Shorter Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; in Russian, launched in the early 1970s as an abridged translation of the &quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica&quot;, evolved into a largely independent publication that by late 2005 included eleven volumes and three supplements. A number of editions of a version of the English Encyclopaedia for youth were also published.

Because of its comprehensive scope, authority, and widespread availability, the &quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica&quot; has been recommended by the Library of Congress and by the Association of Jewish Libraries for use in determining the authoritative romanization of names of Jewish authors. Its guidelines for transliterating Hebrew into English are followed by many academic books and journals.

The first edition generated both positive and negative reviews.

The word Judaica is commonly used to refer to objects of Jewish art and Jewish ceremonial objects.

===Second edition===
In July 2003, Thomson Gale announced that it had acquired the rights to publish a second edition of &quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica&quot;, expecting to publish in December 2006 under one of its imprints, Macmillan Reference US. The 22-volume work was published on December 30, 2006 and released in January 2007.

Together with original publishers Keter Publishing House, Gale made major updates to many sections of &quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica&quot; for the new edition, including the entries on the Holocaust, American Jewry, Israel.

Fred Skolnik, who served as a co-editor on the original edition of &quot;Judaica&quot;, was retained as Editor-in-Chief for the second edition. American Holocaust scholar Michael Berenbaum, adjunct professor of theology at the American Jewish University as well as director of its Sigi Ziering Institute: Exploring the Ethical and Religious Implications of the Holocaust, serves as the editor for the Holocaust and Americana sections of the encyclopedia and executive editor for the work at large. Judith Baskin, University of Oregon Judaic Studies department head, was brought on to supervise improvement of women&#x27;s studies and gender issues coverage. In total, more than 50 divisional editors, including five winners of the Israel Prize, oversaw contributions from nearly 1,200 scholars and editors. This edition contains more than 21,000 signed entries, including 2,600 brand-new entries and 12,000 changed entries.

===Online access===
All volumes of the first edition, some year books and the Decennial Book 1983 - 1992: events of 1982 - 1993 are at the Internet Archive separately. 

All volumes of the second edition are at the Internet Archive together.

Most entries of the second edition are accessible via the Encyclopedia.com search engine. At the head of some entries &quot;updated&quot; appears.

==Critical reception and awards==
Reviews from library literature have been positive. Donald Altschiller of Boston University, writing in &quot;Choice&quot;, states that the second edition of &quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica&quot; &quot;has already attained a secure place in the reference pantheon...Essential.&quot;
Barbara Bibel, writing in &quot;Booklist&quot;, calls the set &quot;a welcome addition to reference collections.&quot;

===Dartmouth Medal===
The second edition of the &quot;Encyclopaedia&quot; received a number of major awards for excellence, including the 2007 Dartmouth Medal from the American Library Association, the most prestigious award in the field of reference publishing.&quot; In presenting the award, Edward Kownslar, the chairman of the Dartmouth Medal committee said: &quot;This 22-volume set is an authoritative, interdisciplinary and comprehensive examination of all aspects of Jewish life, history and culture. This title is an extensive revision of the first edition, which was published in 1972, and has 2600 new entries. In addition to updating all world and political events affecting Jewish life and culture since the early 1970s, &#x27;Judaica&#x27; has significantly enhanced biblical studies and the Holocaust from the first edition. This title has also expanded the area of women&#x27;s studies.&quot;

===Other awards===
The &quot;Encyclopaedia&quot; was also named in the &quot;Best Reference 2007&quot; list by the &quot;Library Journal&quot;, and was added to the list of &quot;Outstanding Reference Sources for Small and Medium-sized Libraries&quot; by the Reference and User Services Association of the American Library Association in 2008.

<doc id="867522" wikidata="Q1035018" url="?curid=867522" title="Caproni Ca.3">
<text>The Caproni Ca.3 is an Italian heavy bomber of World War I and the postwar era. It was the most produced version of the series of aircraft that began with the 1914 Caproni Ca.1 and continued until the more powerful 1917 Caproni Ca.5 variant.

==Development==

The development of the Ca.1 to the Ca.2 suggested the benefits of increasing amounts of power to the very sound airframe. The Ca.3 was a development of Ca.2, by replacing the two engines mounted on the booms with the same Isotta-Fraschini engine that had been used as the central, pusher engine on that design. The prototype flew in late 1916 and was soon put into production. Known by Caproni at the time as the Caproni 450 hp, the Italian Army designated it the Ca.3. In Caproni&#x27;s postwar renaming, it became the Ca.33. Between 250 and 300 of these aircraft were built, supplying the Italian Army and Navy (the latter using the type as a torpedo bomber), and the French Army. Late in the war, Robert Esnault-Pelterie licence-built an additional 83 (some sources say only 19) aircraft in France.

&quot;Note: there is some variation in published sources over early Caproni names. The confusion stems, in part, from three schemes used to label the aircraft – Caproni&#x27;s in-house designations of the time, those used by the Italian Army and names created after the war by Caproni for past designs.&quot;

==Design==
The Ca.3 was a three-engined biplane of wooden construction, with a fabric-covered frame. The crew of four were placed in an open central nacelle (front gunner, two pilots and rear gunner-mechanic). The rear gunner manned upper machine guns, standing upon the central engine in a protective &quot;cage&quot; in front of a propeller. The fixed conventional undercarriage had double mainwheels under each engine and a tailskid under the extreme tail of each boom. A substantial double nosewheel prevented damaging and dangerous nose-overs.

Armament consisted of two to four Revelli 6.5 mm or 7.7 mm machine guns, one in a front ring mount and one, two or sometimes even three in an upper ring mount. Bombs were suspended under the hull.

==Operational history==
The Ca.1 entered service with the Italian Army in the middle of 1915 and first saw action on 20 August, attacking the Austrian air base at Aisovizza. Fifteen bomber squadrons (1°–15° &quot;Squadriglia&quot;) were eventually equipped with Ca.1, Ca.2 and Ca.3 bombers, mostly bombing targets in Austro-Hungary. The 12° &quot;Squadriglie&quot; operated in Libya. In 1918, the 3°, 14° and 15° &quot;Squadriglia&quot; operated in France.

Apart from the Italian Army, original and licence-built examples were used by France (original Capronis were used in French CAP &quot;escadres&quot;, licence-built examples in CEP &quot;escadres&quot;). They were also used by the American Expeditionary Force. There has been some confusion regarding the use of the Ca3 by the British Royal Naval Air Service. The RNAS received six of the larger triplane Ca4s and did not operate the Ca3. The British Ca4s were not used operationally and were returned to Italy after the war. Some of the Ca.36Ms supplied after the war were still in service long enough to see action in Benito Mussolini&#x27;s first assaults on North Africa.

==Variants==
&quot;All of the following names were applied after the war. At the time, all were known as the 300 hp by Caproni and the Ca.3 by the Army.&quot;

*Ca.34 and Ca.35 with a modified central nacelle to seat the two pilots in tandem and therefore improve aerodynamics. No production.
* Ca.36 with removable outer wing panels for ease of storage.
** Ca.36M or Ca.36 mod (for &quot;modificato&quot; – &quot;modified&quot;) – a lightened and simplified variant put into production after the war. 153 were delivered between 1923 and 1927, 144 of them to the new Regia Aeronautica.
** Ca.36S – air ambulance version (small number converted from Ca.36Ms)
* Ca.39 – seaplane version. Prototype CA 211.
* Ca.56a – airliners created by remanufacturing war-surplus Ca.3s.

==Operators==

*Argentine Air Force

*&quot;Corpo Aeronautico Militare&quot;
*&quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;

*French Air Force

*American Expeditionary Force

<doc id="867523" wikidata="Q561814" url="?curid=867523" title="Robert Maynard Hutchins">
<text>Robert Maynard Hutchins (January 17, 1899 – May 14, 1977) was an American educational philosopher. He was president (1929–1945) and chancellor (1945–1951) of the University of Chicago, and earlier dean of Yale Law School (1927–1929). His first wife was the novelist Maude Hutchins. Although his father and grandfather were both Presbyterian ministers, Hutchins became one of the most influential members of the school of secular perennialism.

A graduate of Yale College and the law school of Yale University, Hutchins joined the law faculty and soon was named dean. While dean, he gained notice for Yale&#x27;s development of the philosophy of legal realism. Hutchins was thirty years old when he became Chicago&#x27;s president in 1929, and implemented wide-ranging and sometimes controversial reforms of the university, including the elimination of varsity football. He supported interdisciplinary programs, including during World War II, establishing the Metallurgical Laboratory. His most far-reaching academic reforms involved the undergraduate College of the University of Chicago, which was retooled into a novel pedagogical system built on Great Books, Socratic dialogue, comprehensive examinations and early entrance to college. Although parts of the Hutchins Plan were abandoned by the University shortly after Hutchins left in 1951, an adapted version of the program survived at Shimer College.

Hutchins left Chicago for the Ford Foundation, where he channeled resources into studying education. In 1954 he became president of a Ford Foundation spinoff devoted to civil liberties, the Fund for the Republic. In 1959, he founded the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, a think tank in Santa Barbara, California.

==Early life and career==

Robert Maynard Hutchins was born in Brooklyn in 1899, the second of three sons of William James Hutchins, a Presbyterian minister and future Berea College president. Eight years later, the family moved to Oberlin, Ohio, site of Oberlin College, where William Hutchins became an instructor. Oberlin was a small community dedicated to evangelical ideals of righteousness and hard work, which had a lifelong influence on Hutchins. Hutchins studied at Oberlin Academy and subsequently Oberlin College from 1915 to 1917.

At age 18 in 1917, shortly after the United States entered World War I, Hutchins joined the ambulance service of the United States Army, together with his brother William. The Hutchins brothers served in an all-Oberlin unit, Section 587, which for much of the war was stationed at the Allentown Fair Grounds, where they were tasked with creating a barracks. Upon subsequent deployment to Italy, Hutchins was awarded the Croce al Merito di Guerra.

Returning from the war in 1919, Hutchins went to Yale University (B.A. 1921). At Yale he encountered a very different society from what he had known before at Oberlin; the tone was set by preparatory school graduates who defied Prohibition. However, Hutchins did not enjoy the same level of financial support, and in his junior and senior years, he worked menial jobs for up to six hours per day to cover living expenses. In his senior year, he was tapped for the Wolf&#x27;s Head Society. Having already fulfilled his graduation requirements, he also enrolled in Yale Law School. Fascinated by the case method, Hutchins subsequently regarded this as the beginning of his true education. Shortly after his graduation in 1921, Hutchins married Maude Phelps McVeigh. They had three daughters together, the first born in 1925. They divorced in 1948, and in 1949 he married Vesta Orlick, who had formerly been his secretary.

After spending a year teaching high school History and English in Lake Placid, New York, he was hired to become the Secretary of the Yale Corporation. In this position he was the principal assistant to the president of Yale, with responsibility for alumni relations and fundraising. Returning to New Haven, he also resumed his studies at Yale Law School (LL.B 1925). Upon completing his LL.B., graduating at the top of his class, he was invited to join the Yale Law faculty, teaching courses on evidence and utility law. He became acting Dean of Yale Law School in 1927, and full Dean in 1928. It was at this point, when he was the Dean of Yale Law while still in his 20s, that Hutchins became a national figure.

At the time, Yale Law School was dominated by the Legal Realists and Hutchins sought to promote Legal Realism during his time as dean. Skeptical of the received rules of evidence that he had taught as a professor, he worked to integrate the findings of psychology, sociology and logic with the law. His supporters in this enterprise included William O. Douglas, who left Columbia School of Law to work under Hutchins at Yale. Hutchins played a key role in convincing the Rockefeller Foundation to fund an Institute of Human Relations at Yale, to foster partnerships between the social sciences and law and medicine.

==University of Chicago tenure==
In 1929, he moved to Chicago, Illinois, to become President of the University of Chicago at the age of 30, the youngest university president in the country. Over the next several years, Hutchins came to question Legal Realism, which he had previously championed, and grew skeptical of the ability of empirical research in the social sciences to solve social problems, especially in the face of the Great Depression. Particularly through contact with Mortimer Adler, he became convinced that the solution to the philosophical problems facing the university lay in Aristotelianism and Thomism. In the late 1930s, Hutchins attempted to reform the curriculum of the University of Chicago along Aristotelian-Thomist lines, only to have the faculty reject his proposed reforms three times.

Hutchins served as President of the University of Chicago until 1945, and as the University&#x27;s Chancellor until 1951. During his Chancellorship, he recruited a commission to inquire into the proper function of the media. By 1947, the Hutchins Commission issued their report on the &quot;social responsibility&quot; of the press.

Hutchins was notable as a defender of academic freedom. When the University was accused of fostering communism in 1935 (by Charles Rudolph Walgreen, who claimed his niece had been indoctrinated with communist ideas whilst studying there) and again in 1949, Hutchins defended the right of the University&#x27;s faculty to teach as they wished, arguing that the best way to defeat communism was through open debate and scrutiny, rather than suppression. &quot;Hutchins stood behind his faculty and their right to teach and believe as they wished, insisting that communism could not withstand the scrutiny of public analysis and debate.&quot;

Hutchins was able to implement his ideas regarding a two-year, generalist bachelors during his tenure at Chicago, and subsequently had designated those studying in depth in a field as masters students. He moreover pulled Chicago out of the Big Ten Conference and eliminated the school&#x27;s increasingly struggling football program, which he saw as a campus distraction. Hutchins heaped scorn upon schools which received more press coverage for their sports teams than for their educational programs, and the trustees provided the support he needed to drop football in December 1939.

The decision was met with mixed reactions, with many students and alumni opposing the abolition of what had been seen as a major element of the University&#x27;s culture. Within a year, however, an overwhelming majority of students, alumni, and professors had aligned behind Hutchins&#x27;s vision for a University that emphasized education above athletics. Hutchins today serves as a model for those who argue that commercialized college sports are incompatible with the academic and intellectual aims of institutions of higher learning.

He also worked to eliminate fraternities and religious organizations for the same reason. While he exhibited great fervor for his curricular project and numerous notable alumni were produced during the period, nevertheless, the business community as well as donors became highly skeptical of the value of the program, and eventually were able to have the four-year, traditional A.B. and S.B. reinstated (and in time, football). The College&#x27;s financial clout, which had been considerable prior to his tenure, underwent a serious downgrading with decreased collegiate enrollment and a drying up of donations from the school&#x27;s principal Chicago area benefactors. As such, his critics view him as a dangerous idealist who pushed the school out of the national limelight and temporarily thwarted its possible expansion, while his supporters argue that it was his changes that kept Chicago intellectually unique and from taking on the vocational inclinations that he denigrated in his writings.

==Later life and legacy==
After leaving his position at the University, Hutchins became an officer of the Ford Foundation. Due to the rapid growth of the US automotive industry in the early 1950s, the Ford Foundation was running such large surpluses that it attracted unwanted attention from the Internal Revenue Service. Hutchins was thus able to steer substantial funds into his areas of interest, establishing the Fund for the Advancement of Education and Fund for Adult Education. The Fund for the Advancement of Education sponsored projects including nationwide teacher training and college early entrance programs at 12 colleges. The programs at three of these colleges, Goucher College, the University of Utah, and Shimer College, continue in operation today. The Fund for Adult Education sponsored experimental educational programs for adults, chiefly in the liberal arts; these included the National Educational Television network which later became PBS. In 1954 Hutchins became president of the Fund for the Republic, which promoted civil liberties with $15 million from the Ford Foundation.

After leaving the Fund for the Republic, Hutchins founded the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in 1959, which was his attempt to bring together a community of scholars to analyze this broad area. Hutchins described the Center&#x27;s goal as examining democratic institutions &quot;by taking a multidisciplinary look at the state of the democratic world – and the undemocratic world as well, because one has to contrast the two and see how they are going to develop.&quot; He further stated, &quot;After discovering what is going on, or trying to discover what is going on, the Center offers its observations for such public consideration as the public is willing to give them&quot;.

While modified and reduced in form, the collegiate curriculum at the University of Chicago to this day reflects the Great Books and Socratic method championed by Hutchins&#x27; Secular Perennialism. In addition, a direct descendant of the program continues in operation at Shimer College in Chicago, which was affiliated with the University until the mid-1950s. A classroom and scholarship for early entrants at Shimer still bear his name. A somewhat more distantly related program is operated at St. John&#x27;s College.

Carl Sagan in &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot; says that he was &quot;lucky enough&quot; to have studied under Hutchins, &quot;where science was presented as an integral part of the gorgeous tapestry of human knowledge.&quot;

The Hutchins School of Liberal Studies at Sonoma is named in honor of Hutchins.

Along with Albert Einstein, Hutchins was one of the sponsors of the Peoples&#x27; World Convention (PWC), also known as Peoples&#x27; World Constituent Assembly (PWCA), which took place in 1950-51 at Palais Electoral, Geneva, Switzerland.

==Educational theory==

Throughout his career, Hutchins was a fierce proponent of using those select books that have gained a reputation of being great books as an educational tool. In his interview in 1970 titled, &quot;Don&#x27;t Just Do Something&quot;, Hutchins explained, &quot;...the Great Books [are] the most promising avenue to liberal education if only because they are teacher-proof.&quot; Illustrating his dedication to the Great Books, Hutchins served as Editor In Chief of &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot; and &quot;Gateway to the Great Books&quot;. Additionally, he served as coeditor of &quot;The Great Ideas Today&quot;, Chairman of the Board of Editors of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; from 1943 to 1974, and also published extensively under his own name.

According to Hutchins in &quot;The University of Utopia&quot;, &quot;The object of the educational system, taken as a whole, is not to produce hands for industry or to teach the young how to make a living. It is to produce responsible citizens&quot;. In &quot;The University of Utopia&quot;, Hutchins describes a country that has evolved to become the perfect society, Utopia, as well as their educational system, which has the well-defined purpose of &quot;promot[ing] the intellectual development of the people&quot;. Hutchins also explores some of the improper directions educational institutions have taken in the United States. He argues that education is becoming nothing more than a trade school, and a poor trade school at that. Hutchins discusses the relationship between a foundry and the local college in a particular town in California. This college offers courses on doing foundry work, which instruct students to become workers at the foundry. In this way, the college is satisfying the need of the community for foundry workers rather than the intellectual needs of the individual. Further, Hutchins asserts that the foundry students actually receive poor training since educators do not have the practical experience of working in the foundry. Hutchins believes the students would receive a much more efficient and thorough education on working in a foundry by actually working in that foundry. He claims Universities should instead teach intellectual content, specifically the intellectual content related to the occupation, but that the occupation itself should take responsibility for training its employees. Hutchins also warns that education has shifted its focus from being educational to custodial. He charges that many schools have become no more than baby-sitting services for adolescents, protecting them from the tumultuous world of youth. He cites courses in home economics and driver&#x27;s education as focusing on meeting a societal need rather than an educational goal. Hutchins also berates education for the path it has taken regarding specialization. According to Hutchins in his essay, &quot;The Idea of a College,&quot; the specialization of American education has robbed students of the ability to communicate with other students outside of their field. He argues that a student of biology cannot converse meaningfully with a student of mathematics because they share no common educational experience.

In &quot;The University of Utopia&quot;, Hutchins outlines the educational experience of young Utopians, where the first ten years of instruction prepare students for the learning experiences to come. Communication is the primary skill developed. Students learn to read, write, and discuss issues in preparation for their future lifetime of learning. Students study science and mathematics, which form part of the groundwork for future learning. History, geography, and literature are also studied to add to the framework for even deeper learning later in life. Finally, art and music are studied because these are considered the elements that make society great.

Throughout these fields of study in Utopia, the Great Books, those books that shaped Western thought, are used as study material and are discussed by classes using the Socratic method. The Socratic method, named for Socrates and his method of teaching, involves the teacher&#x27;s keeping the discussion on topic and guiding it away from errors of logic. In a discussion conducted in accordance with Socratic principles, unexamined opinions are fair game, and only reason itself is the final arbiter. Thus, any conclusions reached in such a discussion are the individual&#x27;s own, not necessarily those of a class consensus, and certainly not necessarily the teacher&#x27;s. The Great Books are a natural choice, since they are considered to be works of genius, timeless, and ever relevant to society. Why settle for lesser materials when you can have the best? Despite his other foci, Hutchins does not entirely shun the laboratory world; he believes, however, that some such things are best learned through discovery once a student has been graduated to the outside world.

In Utopia, initial schooling is followed by college, which continues the study of a highly prescribed curriculum. Here, however, the focus shifts from learning the techniques of communication to exploring some of man&#x27;s principal concepts of the world and the leading ideas that have propelled mankind. After college, students sit for an extensive exam created by an outside board, which reflects what an education appropriate to a free person should be. This rigorous exam is similar to those taken throughout a student&#x27;s education but is more comprehensive. When the student passes this exam, he or she is awarded a Bachelor of Arts Degree. The degree is conferred based on the mastery of this information, not on the number of classes taken, credits earned, or hours spent in class.

After proving that they have the necessary education to become a part of the republic of learning and of the political republic, the student may enter the work world or continue his or her formal education at the University. Once departing from formal education, a lifetime of learning follows for the citizens of Utopia. They visit centers of learning to explore and discuss ideas and analyze great works. These centers of learning are residential institutions where citizens go during what Americans would traditionally think of as vacation time. If they choose to matriculate to University, students begin to specialize, but they do not study collection of data, technical training, or solutions to immediate practical problems, but rather they explore the intellectual ideas specific to their chosen field. Here, students study in much less formal situations but with no less vigor. During their initial schooling and college, students had to prove that they could learn independently; if they then chose to attend a University, they were expected to make effective use of those skills.

In addition to Hutchins&#x27;s belief that school should pursue intellectual ideas rather than practical, he also believed that schools should not teach a specific set of values. &quot;It is not the object of a college to make its students good, because the college cannot do it; if it tries to do it, it will fail; it will weaken the agencies that should be discharging this responsibility, and it will not discharge its own responsibility.&quot; The schools should not be in the business of teaching students what is right and just; it should be in the business of helping students make their own determinations.

Critics will point out that the great books do not have one answer to what justice is or is not. In fact, there are many contradictory answers to this question. But what some see as a weakness, Hutchins sees as a strength. Hutchins asserts that students should be exposed to these conflicting ideas so that they may weigh and balance them in their own minds, boiling down the arguments and synthesizing a view of their own. In this way, and only in this way, can students learn what justice, beauty, and good really are.

<text>Unix System Laboratories (USL), sometimes written UNIX System Laboratories to follow relevant trademark guidelines of the time, was an American software laboratory and product development company that existed from 1989 through 1993. At first wholly, and then majority, owned by AT&amp;T, it was responsible for the development and maintenance of one of the main branches of the Unix operating system, the UNIX System V Release 4 source code product. Through Univel, a partnership with Novell, it was also responsible for the development and production of the UnixWare packaged operating system for Intel architecture. In addition it developed Tuxedo, a transaction processing monitor, and was responsible for certain products related to the C++ programming language. USL was based in Summit, New Jersey, and its CEOs were Larry Dooling followed by Roel Pieper.

Created from earlier AT&amp;T entities, USL was, as industry writer Christopher Negus has observed, the culmination of AT&amp;T&#x27;s long involvement in Unix, &quot;a jewel that couldn&#x27;t quite find a home or a way to make a profit.&quot; USL was sold to Novell in 1993.

== Origins as subsidiary of AT&amp;T ==

AT&amp;T announced the creation of the UNIX Software Operation (USO) – a separate and distinct AT&amp;T business unit responsible for the development, marketing, and licensing of UNIX System V software – in January 1989. This was done, as a subsequent press release stated, &quot;in order to separate AT&amp;T&#x27;s UNIX System source code business from its computer systems business,&quot; the latter a reference to AT&amp;T Computer Systems. USO included the AT&amp;T Data Systems Group organizations responsible for UNIX product planning and management, licensing, and marketing. Peter J. Weinberger was named chief scientist of USO while also retaining his job in the computing science research center at Bell Labs; no other Bell Labs assets were transferred to USO. The head of USO was Larry Dooling, who had been a vice-president in sales and marketing in the AT&amp;T Data Systems Group.

Unlike the original Unix work, which had been done in the Bell Labs facility in Murray Hill, USO and the commercialization work was done a few miles away in Summit, New Jersey. This AT&amp;T Bell Labs location was known as SF for Summit Facility.

UNIX System Laboratories, Inc., came into being as a separate subsidiary of AT&amp;T in November 1989 and was assigned all U.S.-based AT&amp;T Unix and USO assets.
However USO continued to operate as USO until June 1990, when the reincorporation of AT&amp;T&#x27;s European and Asian Unix business operations as wholly owned subsidiaries of USL was completed. At that point the UNIX Software Operation was publicly rebranded as UNIX System Laboratories.
Again, a point of emphasis was to separate the Unix-based business from AT&amp;T&#x27;s hardware-based business. The subsidiaries were known as UNIX System Laboratories Europe, Ltd., sited near Ealing Broadway in London, and UNIX System Laboratories Pacific, Ltd., located in Shiba, Tokyo.
Dooling was named the initial president of USL, continuing from his position at USO.

These organizational changes were taking place in the context of the open systems movement and the ongoing Unix wars. In consequence, the pro-AT&amp;T side Unix International (as opposed to the anti-AT&amp;T side Open Software Foundation) declared that &quot;In the last 18 months AT&amp;T has made good on its commitment to treat UNIX System as the industry asset it is and to open the UNIX System V development process to the entire industry.&quot;

==Unix System V work==
One unit within USL, called the UNIX System V Software business unit and headed by Michael J. DeFazio, was responsible for the development of the UNIX System V base technology. DeFazio had held a similar role within USO.
The USO/USL staff was heavily involved in the creation of UNIX System V Release 4, which shipped in 1989 and was a joint project with Sun Microsystems. This work incorporated technology from a variety of Unix-based efforts, including UNIX System V, BSD, and Xenix. There were additions and new innovations as well from both the AT&amp;T and Sun sides. System V Release 4 debuted at the Unix Expo trade show in New York in November 1989, in the form of source code availability for it as well as demonstrations from Unix International of SVR4-based applications running on seventeen different vendor platforms. End-user versions of Release 4 became available during 1990.

Next USL engaged in an especially arduous effort into trying to satisfy the requirements of the National Computer Security Center&#x27;s Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (&quot;Orange Book&quot;) to the B2 level. This manifested itself in System V Release 4.1 ES (Enhanced Security), which also included generally useful features such as support for dynamic loading of kernel modules.

Following that, USL worked on System V Release 4.2, which was released in June 1992. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; characterized this effort as &quot;at the core of an assault on the enterprise networking market,&quot; with a modular architecture that stressed improved support for enterprise- and network-level administration, drivers for both Token Ring and Ethernet, and a greater ability to run on low-end machine configurations.

Multiprocessing became the focus of the final USL-based OEM release of System V, which was Release 4.2MP, released in December 1993.

USL continued the publication of an early Unix standard, the System V Interface Definition (SVID). Moreover, the SVID became one of the bases for the more important, vendor-independent POSIX standard for Unix, which System V Release 4 releases also conformed to, as well as the later Single UNIX Specification.

USL produced many books documenting various aspects of Unix System V. 
USL also provided some training and consulting services for Unix systems.

==Chorus and Ouverture==

In 1991, USL forged an arrangement with the French company Chorus Systèmes SA to engage in cooperative work on the Chorus microkernel technology, with the idea of supporting SVR4 on a microkernel and thereby making it more scalable and better suited for parallel and distributed applications. As part of this, USL took a $1 million stake in Chorus Systèmes. Much of the USL Chorus work was done at the USL Europe facility in London. By 1993 the work was still ongoing, with questions of industry standardization of interfaces arising. Unisys was also part of the collaboration effort. Announcements made during 1993 promised an OEM release in 1994 and a general availability release in 1995.

This was part of the larger Ouverture project, a $14 million effort that was itself part of the European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology (ESPRIT), overseen by the European Commission. 
==Other software work==

Another unit within USL, called the Open Solutions Software business unit and headed by Joel A. Appelbaum, was responsible for other system software that in some way worked in conjunction with Unix.

The Tuxedo transaction processing middleware had also been transferred from elsewhere in AT&amp;T to USL. It had originated as the Loop Maintenance Operations System (LMOS) followed by the Unix Transaction System (UNITS) and was used for projects internally within AT&amp;T. It was then renamed by USL and, as Release 4.0 of what was now called Tuxedo, in 1989 was offered for the first time as a commercial product.

USL also developed and marketed the OSI Communications Platform, which was an implementation of the OSI protocols for Unix-based networking.

==C++ language work==

There was also a languages department at Unix System Laboratories, which was responsible for the C language compiler and development tools used to build Unix. Moreover, it was responsible for commercial sales related to the C++ language, including development tools such as the Cfront compiler that had come from AT&amp;T. 
Indeed, the paper describing one of the first implementations of automatic instantiation of C++ templates in a C++ compiler had as lead author an engineer associated with Unix System Laboratories. And Margaret A. Ellis, co-author with C++ creator Bjarne Stroustrup of &quot;The Annotated C++ Reference Manual&quot;, an important publication in the history of the language, was a USL software engineer.

USL also continued the development of, and attempted to market, C++ Standard Components,
an early instance of a C++ software foundation library that supported container classes and various other computer science-based functionality such as finite-state machines, graphs, and regular expressions. The Standard Components originated in conjunction with early developments in the C++ language in Bell Labs and became widely used internally within AT&amp;T, by one estimate being used in hundreds of projects.
They represented an effort among early library writers there to design reusable code using C++ idioms. Unlike its other offerings, which were sold to OEM vendors and resellers, here USL sold to end users. The initial release of USL C++ Standard Components to the general computing industry was labelled as Release 2.0 and occurred in 1991; it suffered from an awkward mechanism to get around the lack of templates in the container classes. That was followed by Release 3.0, which added support for templates, in 1992. 

Some within USL believed that C++ Standard Components could become a language standard as well as a significant source of revenue, but it had trouble gaining traction outside of AT&amp;T. Stroustrup would later describe these goals as &quot;a misguided belief&quot;. In any case, all such libraries were soon eclipsed by the radically different Standard Template Library (STL), which became the standardized foundation library for the C++ language. As it happens, one of the Standard Components, array_alg, was designed by the creator of STL, Alex Stepanov, and can be considered an early predecessor of STL.

== Partial spinoff from AT&amp;T ==

In April 1991, USL became partly independent of AT&amp;T when about 22 percent of it, worth about $65 million, was sold to eleven outside computer vendors: Amdahl, Motorola, Novell, Sun, ICL, Olivetti, Fujitsu, NEC, OKI Electric, Toshiba, and the Institute for Information Industry. There was a stated goal to lessen the control AT&amp;T had over Unix, which would lead to USL becoming a publicly owned company within three years.
An AT&amp;T executive said, &quot;AT&amp;T is convinced that the best way to nurture the growth of the open systems movement and to share into it ourselves is to establish an independent Unix Systems Laboratory with the technical guidance of Unix International and the business advice of investors who will ensure that USL is run properly and profitably.&quot;

By this point USL had some 500 employees, 2400 customers, and annual revenue around the $100 million mark. AT&amp;T said that USL had been profitable since its inception in 1989.

USL got a new president and CEO in November 1991 when Dooling was replaced by the Dutchman Roel Pieper, formerly chief technical officer of Software AG.

USL was aggressive in defending its perceived intellectual property rights, initiating as the plaintiff a lawsuit in 1992 against Berkeley Software Design makers of and the Regents of the University of California over copyrights and trademarks related to Unix. The case was known as &quot;UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. v. Berkeley Software Design, Inc.&quot; and in it USL asked the court for a preliminary injunction that would bar the Berkeley firm and the university from distributing their Net/2 operating system release, which was implied to be Unix, until the case was concluded. In response the university filed a countersuit against AT&amp;T for alleged breaches in the licensing agreement the two parties had. (The case was settled out of court in January 1994.)

== Univel and UnixWare ==

In December 1991, USL combined with Novell to form the Univel joint venture. The goal was to make the &quot;Destiny&quot; desktop for Intel commodity hardware, which would be USL&#x27;s first shrink-wrapped binary product, with the necessary resources for sales, marketing, and distribution being moved into the new entity. 
Kanwal Rekhi, a Novell vice president who helped launch Univel, said the 
goal was to create a &quot;Unix for the masses&quot;.

A May 1992 &quot;InfoWorld&quot; interview with Pieper captured some of the ambitions of USL at the time, as Pieper said: &quot;It is not just a new Unix version; rather it is the creation of an entire model change for Unix that says there are better ways to bring the benefits and features of Unix into a distributed PC environment. The earlier model did not allow Unix to play in the low-end market because of its size, complexity, and cost. The new model calls for business partnerships, such as the one with Novell, to deliver Unix to the commercial marketplace.&quot; In another interview around the same time, Pieper predicted that if the new Unix became a success, USL revenue could increase ten-fold to $1 billion within five years.
Pieper acknowledged that similar Unix efforts had failed in the past, but said that the presence of Novell&#x27;s PC presence and marketing experience as well as the interest of Intel would make the difference this time.
Indeed, Pieper had aspirations to be another Bill Gates: &quot;I want to be in the same position.&quot;

UnixWare 1.0, which is what Destiny became a product as, was announced on October 12, 1992. It was based on the Unix System V release 4.2 kernel. The MoOLIT toolkit was used for the windowing system, allowing the user to choose between an OPEN LOOK or MOTIF-like look and feel at run time. In order to make the system more robust on commodity desktop hardware the Veritas VXFS journaling file system was used in place of the UFS file system used in SVR4. Networking support in UnixWare included both TCP/IP and interoperability with Novell&#x27;s NetWare protocols of IPX/SPX. The former were the standard among Unix users at the time of development, while PC networking was much more commonly based on the highly successful NetWare product; indeed, the base level of the Personal Edition of UnixWare did not even have TCP/IP included, while the Application Server version did. 

Initial sales of UnixWare were underwhelming, with Unix facing a difficult time in the PC market. This was in part because Windows already had a stronghold there, in part because USL&#x27;s third-party licensing payment obligations made low-cost sales uneconomical, and in part because of a lack of applications to run on UnixWare.

== Acquisition by Novell ==
On December 21, 1992, it was announced that Novell would acquire Unix System Laboratories, and all of its Unix assets, including all copyrights, trademarks, and licensing contracts, for some $335 million in stock. The news led to large headlines of the &quot;NOVELL BUYS UNIX&quot; variety.
The measure was intended to help Novell compete against Microsoft, which was on the verge of including networking as a built-in feature of Windows in conjunction with the Windows NT server. It was also an outgrowth of Novell chief Ray Noorda&#x27;s theories about coopetition in a technology industry.

The move seemed like a long shot to analysts, with a commentary piece in &quot;Computerworld&quot; outlining the obstacles to success and stating, &quot;Saying this deal has the technical potential to counter Windows NT is very different from predicting that it will do so.&quot;

There was negative reaction to the acquisition from USL shareholders, USL employees, and members of Unix International. Noorda had to emphasize that Novell had no plans to move USL operations from New Jersey to Utah, where Novell was based. And Noorda and Pieper had to travel to Japan to reassure USL shareholders and investors there.

Nonetheless, the deal was finalized in June 1993.
Novell created the Unix Systems Group to contain the new business, which also absorbed the Univel venture.
Rekhi was named as the head of the Unix Systems Group. Pieper, who had been assigned under Rekhi with little role to play, soon departed, leaving Novell in August 1993.

The USL Europe office in London was moved into Novell&#x27;s facility in Bracknell, Berkshire. The Chorus work it was doing became the basis for the Novell &quot;SuperNOS&quot;, a project to create a microkernel-based, UnixWare–NetWare hybrid, network operating system.

== Legacy ==
The acquisition of USL never really worked out for Novell, and was followed by Novell&#x27;s misguided acquisitions of WordPerfect and Quattro Pro in another attempt to compete head-to-head with Microsoft. In particular, the &quot;SuperNOS&quot; project never achieved fruition.

Novell announced the sale of Unix to the Santa Cruz Operation, coincident with a licensing arrangement with Hewlett-Packard, in September 1995. Following another change of ownership, the renamed The SCO Group and the Unix System V source base became elements of the SCO–Linux disputes. After The SCO Group went bankrupt, the SCO products using the Unix System V source base were purchased by UnXis, later renamed to Xinuos.

Although it never took off within the industry, C++ Standard Components remained in the development kits for Novell UnixWare, later SCO UnixWare, into the 2000s. Tuxedo was acquired by BEA Systems in the 1990s, and then upon that firm being acquired became part of Oracle Fusion Middleware.

Novell was acquired by The Attachmate Group in 2011. The Attachmate Group was acquired by Micro Focus in 2014. Micro Focus was later acquired by OpenText in 2023.

In the view of writer Christopher Negus, 
&quot;The UNIX Laboratory was considered a jewel that couldn&#x27;t quite find a home or a way to make a profit. As it moved between Bell Laboratories and other areas of AT&amp;T, its name changed several times. It is probably best remembered by the name it had as it began its spin-off from AT&amp;T: UNIX System Laboratories (USL).&quot;
However Negus believes that in three crucial respects USL&#x27;s actions – in continuing to release a source code product to its partners, in working to define industry standards such as POSIX, and in making decisions on the direction of Unix based on technical merit not corporate advantage – paved the way for the rise of a Unix-like entity such as the Linux operating system, and that this beneficial historical role has been obscured by the SCO–Linux controversies.

<text>Company Sergeant Major John Henry Williams, (29 September 1886 – 7 March 1953) was a Welsh colliery worker, soldier, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC) the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Williams is the most decorated Welsh non-commissioned officer of all time.

==Early life==
Williams was born in Nantyglo, Monmouthshire, on 29 September 1886.

==First World War==
In November 1914, Williams gave up his employment as a colliery blacksmith and enlisted in the 10th (Service) Battalion, South Wales Borderers (1st Gwent) (part of the 38th (Welsh) Division). He was promoted to sergeant in January 1915.

His citation for the Victoria Cross reads:
Company sergeant major Williams was medically discharged from the army on 17 October 1918 after being severely wounded by shrapnel in the right arm and leg.

In 1919, Williams was invested with his Victoria Cross, Distinguished Conduct Medal, Military Medal and Bar by King George V, the first time that the King had decorated the same man four times in one day. At the time of the investiture Williams had not recovered from his severe wounds, and during the presentation the wound in his arm opened up with the result that medical attention had to be given before he could leave the palace.

==Legacy==
Williams&#x27; grave and memorial are at Ebbw Vale Cemetery. The original headstone was removed during cemetery clearance and a new headstone was erected on 21 October 1990.

In September 2018 the villagers of Villers-Outréaux dedicated an especially commissioned memorial to commemorate him and express their thanks for saving their village from certain destruction.

===Bridge of Honour===
The &#x27;Jack Williams Gateway Bridge&#x27; was unveiled on 21 January 2019, by his great, great-granddaughter. It is 160 ft. tall, and is part of the new A465 (&#x27;Heads of Valleys&#x27;) road dualling project between Brynmawr and Gilwern, on the westerly-part of the Clydach Gorge.
It weighs just over 738 tons.

Mr Williams&#x27; name was chosen for the bridge by 96% of those who participated in the public vote.

===War Medal===
Williams&#x27; Victoria Cross is displayed at the Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh, Brecon.

<text>A topical medication is a medication that is applied to a particular place on or in the body. Most often topical medication means application to body surfaces such as the skin or mucous membranes to treat ailments via a large range of classes including creams, foams, gels, lotions, and ointments. Many topical medications are epicutaneous, meaning that they are applied directly to the skin. Topical medications may also be inhalational, such as asthma medications, or applied to the surface of tissues other than the skin, such as eye drops applied to the conjunctiva, or ear drops placed in the ear, or medications applied to the surface of a tooth. The word &quot;topical&quot; derives from Greek &quot;topikos&quot;, &quot;of a place&quot;.

==Justification==
Topical drug delivery is a route of administering drugs via the skin to provide topical therapeutic effects. As skin is one of the largest and most superficial organs in the human body, pharmacists utilise it to deliver various drugs. This system usually provides a local effect on certain positions of the body. In ancient times, people used herbs to put on wounds for relieving the inflammatory effect or as pain relievers. The use of topical drug delivery system is much broader now, from smoking cessation to beauty purposes. Nowadays, there are numerous dosage forms that can be used topically, including cream, ointment, lotion, patches, dusting powder and much more. There are many advantages for this drug delivery system – avoiding first pass metabolism which can increase its bioavailability, being convenient and easy to apply to a large area, being easy to terminate the medication and avoiding gastro-intestinal irritations. All these can increase patient compliance. However, there are several disadvantages to this system – causing skin irritations and symptoms like rashes and itchiness may occur. Also, only small particles can pass through the skin, which limits the choice of drugs. Since skin is the main medium of the topical drug delivery system, its conditions determine the rate of skin penetration leading to affecting the pharmacokinetics of the drug. The temperature, pH value, and dryness of the skin need to be considered. There are some novel topical drugs in the market which can utilise the system as much as possible.

This localized system provides topical therapeutic effects via skin, eyes, nose and vagina to treat diseases. The most common usage is for local skin infection problems. Dermatological products have various formulations and range in consistency though the most popular dermal products are semisolid dosage forms to provide topical treatment.

==Factor affecting topical drug absorption==
Topical drug absorption depends on two major factors – biological and physicochemical properties.
The first factor concerns body structure effects on the drugs. The degradation of drugs can be affected by the site of applications. Some studies discovered different Percutaneous absorption patterns. Apart from the place, age also affects the absorption as the skin structure changes with age. The lowered collagen and broadened blood capillary networks happen with aging. These features alter the effectiveness of absorption of both hydrophilic and lipophilic substances into stratum corneum underneath the surface of the skin. The skin surface integrity can also affect the permeability of drugs such as the density of hair follicles, sweat glands or disintegrated by inflammation or dehydration. 
The other factor concerns metabolism of medications on skin. When the percutaneous drug is applied on skin, it will be gradually absorbed down the skin. Normally, when the drugs are absorbed, they will be metabolised by various enzymes in our body and the amount will be lower. The exact amount delivered to the target action site determines the potency and bioavailability of the drugs. If the concentration is too low, the therapeutic effect is impeded; if the concentration is too high, drug toxicity may happen to cause side effects or even do harm to our body. For the topical drug delivery way, degradation of drugs in skin is very low compared to liver. The metabolism of drugs is mainly by metabolic enzyme cytochrome P450, and this enzyme is not active in skin. The CYP450 actively metabolized drugs can then maintain high concentration when being applied on skin. Despite CYP450 enzyme action, the partition coefficient (K) determines the activity of topical drugs. The ability of drug particles to go through the skin layer also affects the absorption of drugs. For transdermal activity, medicines with higher K value are harder to get rid of the lipid layer of skin cells. The trapped molecules then cannot penetrate into the skin. This reduces the efficacy of the transdermal drugs. The drugs target cells underneath the skin or need to diffuse into blood capillary to exert their effect. Meanwhile, the size of particles affects this transdermal process. The smaller the drug molecules, the faster the rate of penetration. Polarity of the drugs can affect this diffusion rate too. If the drug shows lower degree of ionization, it is less polar. Therefore, it can have a faster absorption rate.

==Local versus systemic effect==
The definition of the topical route of administration sometimes states that both the application location and the pharmacodynamic effect thereof is local.
In other cases, &quot;topical&quot; is defined as applied to a localized area of the body or to the surface of a body part regardless of the location of the effect. By this definition, topical administration also includes transdermal application, where the substance is administered onto the skin but is absorbed into the body to attain systemic distribution. Such medications are generally hydrophobic chemicals, such as steroid hormones. Specific types include transdermal patches which have become a popular means of administering some drugs for birth control, hormone replacement therapy, and prevention of motion sickness. One example of an antibiotic that may be applied topically is chloramphenicol.

If defined strictly as having a local effect, the topical route of administration can also include enteral administration of medications that are poorly absorbable by the gastrointestinal tract. One poorly absorbable antibiotic is vancomycin, which is recommended by mouth as a treatment for severe &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; colitis.

==Choice of base formulation==
A medication&#x27;s potency often is changed with its base. For example, some topical steroids will be classified one or two strengths higher when moving from cream to ointment. As a rule of thumb, an ointment base is more occlusive and will drive the medication into the skin more rapidly than a solution or cream base.

The manufacturer of each topical product has total control over the content of the base of a medication. Although containing the same active ingredients, one manufacturer&#x27;s cream might be more acidic than the next, which could cause skin irritation or change its absorption rate. For example, a vaginal formulation of miconazole antifungal cream might irritate the skin less than an athlete&#x27;s foot formulation of miconazole cream. These variations can, on occasion, result in different clinical outcomes, even though the active ingredient is the same. No comparative potency labeling exists to ensure equal efficacy between brands of topical steroids (percentage of oil vs water dramatically affect the potency of topical steroid). Studies have confirmed that the potency of some topical steroid products may differ according to manufacturer or brand. An example of this is the case of brand name Valisone cream and Kenalog cream in clinical studies have demonstrated significantly better vasoconstrictions than some forms of this drug produced by generic drug manufacturers. However, in a simple base like an ointment, much less variation between manufacturers is common.

In dermatology, the base of a topical medication is often as important as the medication itself. It is extremely important to receive a medication in the correct base, before applying to the skin. A pharmacist should not substitute an ointment for a cream, or vice versa, as the potency of the medication can change. Some physicians use a thick ointment to replace the waterproof barrier of the inflamed skin in the treatment of eczema, and a cream might not accomplish the same clinical intention.

==Formulations==
There are many general classes, with no clear dividing line among similar formulations. As a result, what the manufacturer&#x27;s marketing department chooses to list on the label of a topical medication might be completely different from what the form would normally be called.

===Cream===

A cream is an emulsion of oil and water in approximately equal proportions. It penetrates the stratum corneum outer layer of skin wall. Cream is thicker than lotion, and maintains its shape when removed from its container. It tends to be moderate in moisturizing tendency. For topical steroid products, oil-in-water emulsions are common. Creams have a significant risk of causing immunological sensitization due to preservatives and have a high rate of acceptance by patients. There is a great variation in ingredients, composition, pH, and tolerance among generic brands.

===Foam===
Topical corticosteroid foams are suitable for treating a range of skin conditions that respond to corticosteroids. These foams are typically simple to apply, which can lead to better patient compliance and, in turn, improve treatment results for those who favor a more convenient and cleaner topical option. Foam can be typically seen with topical steroids marketed for the scalp.

===Gel===

Gels are thicker than liquids. Gels are often a semisolid emulsion and sometimes use alcohol as a solvent for the active ingredient; some gels liquefy at body temperature. Gel tends to be cellulose cut with alcohol or acetone. Gels tend to be self-drying, tend to have greatly variable ingredients between brands, and carry a significant risk of inducing hypersensitivity due to fragrances and preservatives. Gel is useful for hairy areas and body folds. In applying gel one should avoid fissures in the skin, due to the stinging effect of the alcohol base. Gel enjoys a high rate of acceptance due to its cosmetic elegance.

===Lotion===

Lotions are similar to solution but are thicker and tend to be more emollient in nature than the solution. They are usually oil mixed with water, and more often than not have less alcohol than solution. Lotions can be drying if they contain a high amount of alcohol.

===Ointment===
An ointment is a homogeneous, viscous, semi-solid preparation; most commonly a greasy, thick water-in-oil emulsion (80% oil, 20% water) having a high viscosity, that is intended for external application to the skin or mucous membranes. Ointments have a water number that defines the maximum amount of water that they can contain. They are used as emollients or for the application of active ingredients to the skin for protective, therapeutic, or prophylactic purposes and where a degree of occlusion is desired.

Ointments are used topically on a variety of body surfaces. These include the skin and the mucous membranes of the eye (an &quot;eye ointment&quot;), chest, vulva, anus, and nose. An ointment may or may not be medicated.

Ointments are usually very moisturizing, and good for dry skin. They have a low risk of sensitization due to having few ingredients beyond the base oil or fat, and low irritation risk. There is typically little variability between brands of drugs. They are often disliked by patients due to greasiness.

The vehicle of an ointment is known as the &quot;ointment base&quot;. The choice of a base depends upon the clinical indication for the ointment. The different types of ointment bases are:
* Absorption bases, e.g., beeswax and wool fat
* Emulsifying bases, e.g., cetrimide and emulsifying wax
* Hydrocarbon bases, e.g., ceresine, microcrystalline wax, hard paraffin, and soft paraffin
* Vegetable oil bases, e.g., almond oil, coconut oil, olive oil, peanut oil, and sesame oil
* Water-soluble bases, e.g., macrogols 200, 300, 400

The medicaments are dispersed in the base and are divided after penetrating the living cells of the skin.

The water number of an ointment is the maximum quantity of water that 100g of a base can contain at 20 °C.

Ointments are formulated using hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or water-emulsifying bases to provide preparations that are immiscible, miscible, or emulsifiable with skin secretions. They can also be derived from hydrocarbon (fatty), absorption, water-removable, or water-soluble bases.

Evaluation of ointments:
# Drug content
# Release of medicament from base
# Medicament penetration
# Consistency of the preparation
# Absorption of medicament into blood stream
# Irritant effect

Properties which affect choice of an ointment base are:
# Stability
# Penetrability
# Solvent property
# Irritant effects
# Ease of application and removal

Methods of preparation of ointments:
* Fusion: In this method the ingredients are melted together in descending order of their melting points and stirred to ensure homogeneity.
* Trituration: In this finely subdivided insoluble medicaments are evenly distributed by grinding with a small amount of the base followed by dilution with gradually increasing amounts of the base.

===Paste===
Paste combines three agents – oil, water, and powder. It is an ointment in which a powder is suspended.

===Powder===
Powder is either the pure drug by itself (talcum powder), or is made of the drug mixed in a carrier such as corn starch or corn cob powder (Zeosorb AF – miconazole powder). Can be used as an inhaled topical (cocaine powder used in nasal surgery).

===Shake lotion===
A shake lotion is a mixture that separates into two or three parts over time. Frequently, an oil mixed with a water-based solution needs to be shaken into suspension before use and includes the instructions: &quot;Shake well before use&quot;.

===Solid===
Medication may be placed in a solid form. Examples are deodorants, antiperspirants, astringents, and hemostatic agents. Some solids melt when they reach body temperature (e.g. rectal suppositories).

===Sponge===
Certain contraceptive methods rely on sponge as a carrier of liquid medicine. Lemon juice embedded in a sponge has been used as a primitive contraception in some cultures.

===Tape===
Cordran tape is an example of a topical steroid applied under occlusion by tape. This greatly increases the potency and absorption of the topical steroid and is used to treat inflammatory skin diseases.

===Tincture===
A tincture is a skin preparation that has a high percentage of alcohol. It would normally be used as a drug vehicle if drying of the area is desired.

===Topical solution===
Topical solutions can be marketed as drops, rinses, or sprays, are generally of low viscosity, and often use alcohol or water in the base. These are usually a powder dissolved in alcohol, water, and sometimes oil; although a solution that uses alcohol as a base ingredient, as in topical steroids, can cause drying of the skin. There is significant variability among brands, and some solutions may cause irritation, depending on the preservative(s) and fragrances used in the base.

Some examples of topical solutions are given below:

# Aluminium acetate topical solution: This is colorless, with a faint acetous odour and sweetish taste. It is applied topically as an astringent after dilution with 10-40 parts of water. This is used in many types of dermatologic creams, lotions, and pastes. Commercial premeasured and packed tablets and powders are available for this preparation.
# Povidone iodine topical solution: This is a chemical complex of iodine with polyvinylpyrrolidone. The agent is a polymer with an average molecular weight of 40,000. The povidone iodine contains 10% available iodine, slowly released when applied to skin. This preparation is employed topically as a surgical scrub and non irritating antiseptic solution; its effectiveness is directly attributed to the presence and release of iodine from the complex. Commercial product: Betadine solution.

===Transdermal patch===
Transdermal patches can be a very precise time released method of delivering a drug. Cutting a patch in half might affect the dose delivered. The release of the active component from a transdermal delivery system (patch) may be controlled by diffusion through the adhesive which covers the whole patch, by diffusion through a membrane which may only have adhesive on the patch rim or drug release may be controlled by release from a polymer matrix. Cutting a patch might cause rapid dehydration of the base of the medicine and affect the rate of diffusion.

===Vapor===
Some medications are applied as an ointment or gel, and reach the mucous membrane via vaporization. Examples are nasal topical decongestants and smelling salt.

==Topical Drug Classification System (TCS)==

Topical drug classification system (TCS) is proposed by the FDA. It is designed from the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) for oral immediate release solid drug products which is very successful for decades. There are 3 aspects to assess and 4 classes in total. The 3 aspects include qualitative (Q1), quantitative (Q2) and similarity of in vitro release (IVR) rate (Q3).

===Advantages of topical drug delivery systems===
In the early 1970s, the Alza Corporation, through their founder Alejandro Zaffaroni, filed the first US patents describing transdermal delivery systems for scopolamine, nitroglycerin and nicotine. People found that applying medicines on the body surfaces is beneficial in many aspects. Skin medicines can give faster onset and local effect on our body as the surface cream can bypass first pass metabolism such as hepatic and intestinal metabolism. Apart from the absorption, dermal drugs effectively prevent oral delivery limitations such as nausea and vomiting and poor appliances due to unpalatable tastes of the drugs . Topical application is an easy way for patients to tackle skin infections in a painless and non-invasive way. From a patient perspective, applying drugs on skin also provides stable dosage in blood so as to give the optimal bioavailability and therapeutic effects. In case of overdose or unwanted side effects, patients can take off or wash out the medicines quickly to eliminate toxicity by simply removing the patch to stop the delivery of drugs.

===Disadvantages of topical drug delivery systems===
The site of putting the patches for topical drugs may get irritated and have rashes and feel itchy. Hence, some topical drugs including nicotine patches for smoking cessation are advised to change places for each application to avoid continuous irritation of the skin. Also, since the drug needs to penetrate the skin, some drugs may not be able to pass through the skin. Some drugs are then “wasted” and the bioavailability of the drug will decrease.

===Challenges for designing topical dosage form===
Skin penetration is the main challenge for any topical dosage form. The drug needs to penetrate the skin in order to get into the body to apply its function. The drug follows Fick&#x27;s first law of diffusion. One of the most common versions of Fick&#x27;s first law of diffusion is:

:formula_1

where

* is the diffusion flux.
* is the diffusion coefficient.
* is the concentration gradient.
For is described by the Stokes–Einstein equation. The equation is:
:formula_2

where

* is the gas constant.
* is the temperature.
* is the viscosity.
* is the radius of the solute.
*formula_3 is the Avogadro constant.

Assuming concentration gradient is constant for all newly applied topical drugs and the temperature is constant (normal body temperature: 37 °C), the viscosity and radius of the drug determine the flux of diffusion. The higher the viscosity or the larger the radius of the drug is, the lower the diffusion flux of the drug is.

==New developments==
There are many factors for drug developers to consider in developing new topical formulations.

The first one is the effect of the drug vehicle. The medium to carry the topical drugs can affect the penetration of the drug active ingredient and efficacy. For example, this carrier can have a cooling, drying, emollient or protective action to suit the required conditions of the application site such as applying gel or lotion for hairy areas. Meanwhile, scientists need to match the type of preparation with the type of lesions. For example, they need to avoid oily ointments for acute weepy dermatitis. Chemists also need to consider the irritation or any sensitization potential to ensure that the topical application can be stable during storage and transport to maintain its efficacy. Another potential material is nanofiber-based dispersion to improve the adhesion of active ingredients on the skin.

In order to enhance drug penetration into the skin, scientists have several ways to achieve their purposes by using chemical, biochemical, physical, and super saturation enhancement. Advanced Emulgel technology is a breakthrough in painkilling topical drugs. It helps the gel to enter deeply down the skin layer to strengthen the delivery of diclofenac to the point of pain so as to achieve better therapeutic effects by modifying the above properties.
