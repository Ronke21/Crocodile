<text>Peter Inge (born 13 December 1977) is a lacrosse player who was the first Australian to play in Major League Lacrosse, being drafted to the Boston Cannons in 2003.

Originally from the Woodville Lacrosse Club in South Australia, Inge first represented Australia at the 1996 ILF World Under 19 Championship, where they came runner-up to the United States. After competing in the senior Australian team alongside his brother James at the 1998 World Lacrosse Championship where Australia finished third, Inge stamped his mark on the world stage when in 2002 he was selected in the World All-Stars team following Australia&#x27;s bronze medal at the championships in Perth. This performance was noticed by the Cannons and led him to become the first player drafted to the MLL with no NCAA lacrosse experience. Inge scored his first career goal in his debut on 31 May 2003. After being traded to the San Francisco Dragons after the 2005 season, Inge captained Australia to yet another third place in the 2006 World Lacrosse Championship.

Inge was Assistant coach to the Australian Women&#x27;s Lacrosse team in the 2009 Senior Women&#x27;s Lacrosse World Championships where Australia won the Silver Medal.

<text>Sopot ( ) is a Bulgarian town situated in the fertile sub-Balkan mountain valley of Karlovo (which is the western part of the famous Rose Valley), immediately below the steep southern slopes of the Troyan Balkan Mountain (Central Stara Planina). Sopot is part of Plovdiv Province and is the administrative centre of a municipality with the same name.

== Geography ==
It lies 2 km west of Karlovo, 136 km east of Sofia, 63 km north of Plovdiv, and 61 km south of Troyan. It is the birthplace of arguably the best known and most renowned Bulgarian novelist, Ivan Vazov. Sopot is also a machine building centre.

== History ==
According to Konstantin Jireček, the toponym is of Proto-Slavic origin, as indicated by the large number of identical placenames all around the Slavic world. There is information about the locality dating back to the Ottoman rule. During the Bulgarian National Revival (18th and 19th centuries) it was called &quot;Golden Sopot&quot; because of its flourishing development in the crafts and trade. The citizens of Sopot manufactured homespun, braids, fur and leather of high quality and traded predominantly round the Ottoman Empire.

During the struggle for liberation in 1877 the town was largely destroyed by fire and its population was slaughtered or expelled. The town was named &quot;Vazovgrad&quot; between 1950 and 1965 after which it obtained its present name again.

The pioneering Bulgarian educator Nedelya Petkova (1826–1894) began her career a student at the monastery school of the &quot;Holy presentation of the Blessed Virgin&quot; convent in Sopot.

== Population ==
The population is almost exclusively Christian, mostly Eastern Orthodox but with some Evangelical and Roman Catholic families.

According to the 2011 census, 7,973 out of 8,754 inhabitants declared their ethnicity. Around 96.2% of those, or 7,669 people, are ethnic Bulgarians. There are 145 Roma people (1.8%) and 20 ethnic Turks (0.3%) living in the town of Sopot.

== Religion ==
The population of Sopot professes mostly Eastern Orthodox Christianity. There are several families Roman Catholics and evangelicals. No Muslims .

* Sopot monastery &quot;St. Spas&quot; or Sopot monastery for men &quot;Vaznesenie Gospodne&quot; (&quot;Ascension Day&quot;)(in its present form since 1879 ), in which on 7 December 1858 Vasil Levski became a monk. – The exact date of the occurrence of the monastery is not known. It is believed that was founded in the 13th century. Most likely &quot;St. Spas&quot; is the successor of the previous monastery in the Sopot area – &quot;St. Trinity&quot;, extinct about the 11th or 12th century. The &quot;St. Spas&quot; monastery was &quot;royal&quot;- i.e. it was endowed with rights and property by Smilets of Bulgaria himself. These certificates were kept in the monastery until 1870. After that they were transmitted to Nayden Gerov for publishing. During the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria the church was burned and destroyed many times. After its restoration in 1870 it was painted by the artist George Danchev, a close friend of Vasil Levski. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78), the church was destroyed again as only the altar survived, but the eyes of the saints were gouged by the bayonets of the Turks. The Church and the fountain of the monastery were restored again in 1879 by Abbot Raphail, whose grave is now behind the altar. By the south wall the church can be seen the great bell, cast in Craiova in 1873 and donated to the monastery by Sopot citizens living in Romania.
* Nunnery &quot;Vavedenie Bogorodichno&quot; (Blessed Virgin),dating from 1665 – one of the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria of the Bulgarian Tourist Union. – The monastery church &quot;Blessed Virgin&quot; was built in the 15th century on the site of an old chapel. The monastery itself was founded in 1665 when living quarters were built around the temple. In the southern cell, on the second floor of the monastery, a primary school was housed. On the first floor of the monastery was located the cell of the Abbess – Hristina. Her cell was the entrance to Vasil Levski&#x27;s hideout. In 1877 the monastery and the town were burnt down and the Abbess was brutally slaughtered by the Turks. From the monastery survived the temple, the hiding place of Vasil Levski, the fountain (1852), part of the cells and the old vine, which is considered to be one of the oldest in Bulgaria and is over 350 years old. The monastery was rebuilt after the Liberation of Bulgaria.

<text>Adrian Legg (born 16 May 1948) is an English guitar player who has been called &quot;impossible to categorize&quot;. He plays custom guitars that are a hybrid of electric and acoustic, and his fingerstyle picking technique has been acknowledged by the readers of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; who voted Legg the &quot;best acoustic fingerstyle&quot; player four years in a row (1993–1996).

From his early start as a bench technician customising electric guitars, Legg moved into guitar instruction, publishing books and videos on guitar technique. In 1996 and 1997, Legg shared the stage with acclaimed guitar experts Joe Satriani, Eric Johnson and Steve Vai as part of the G3 tour. Vai called Legg &quot;Uncle Adrian&quot; and Satriani said of Legg&#x27;s musicianship, &quot;He&#x27;s simply the best acoustic guitar player I&#x27;ve ever heard. I don&#x27;t know anyone else who can create such a cascade of beautiful notes... Adrian plays like he&#x27;s got hammers for fingers.&quot;

==Early career==

Legg was born in Hackney, London, England. He studied the oboe as a child, but in teenage years his interest shifted to the guitar.

In the early 1970s, Legg won both the composition and performance sections of a competition run by the now defunct Guitar magazine, published by Musical New Services of Denmark Street, which led to his being asked to contribute articles to the magazine. From then on, his technical flair produced a stream of articles in UK music press in the 1970s and early 1980s, culminating in the 1981 Kaye and Ward book &quot;Customising Your Electric Guitar.&quot; He spent from 1979 to 1981 as a technician at Rose Morris Ltd., who then handled Marshall amplification, Ovation Guitar and Takamine Guitars, and designed original and well-reviewed passive circuits for the then relaunched Vox guitars. In 1990, he was involved in the prototyping and launch of the highly successful Trace Acoustic amplifiers, and continues to maintain technical relationships with the musical instrument industry.

From a 1983 promotional flyer (Technopickers) from Spindrift Records; having demonstrated Ovation guitar for a number of years and with sessions with Tom Robinson, a tour with Richard Thompson and appearing on Radio One&#x27;s in Concert programme all have helped established Adrian.

==Going global==
Legg&#x27;s first US release, &quot;Guitars and Other Cathedrals&quot; in 1990, pleased guitar fans. Over the years, he&#x27;s played at the Montreux Jazz Festival and toured with Richard Thompson, David Lindley, Joe Satriani, Eric Johnson and as part of the G3 Tour featuring Satriani, Johnson and Favored Nations founder Steve Vai. For G3, Legg served as an opening act in 1996 and a headlining act in 1997. An infrequent singer, Legg helped with vocal duties on the collaborative G3 performance of &quot;Red House&quot; by Jimi Hendrix.

He has also shared the wealth of his talent and experience with teaching DVDs, videos and books. In recent years, he has also been a commentator-at-large for National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, and even more recently, regular listeners have heard his guitar versions of the show&#x27;s theme music.

==Style==

Legg plays fingerstyle guitar, mixing an alternating-bass style with harmonics, banjo-peg retuning and single or double-string bending. Often he will play a piece entirely in arpeggios similar to a classical guitar style. He makes extensive use of altered tunings and capos. He also uses banjo tuning pegs on many of his guitars, allowing him to change tunings mid song, as well as producing glissandos

Legg has said that his true home is onstage. &quot;Playing live is the whole point... Everyone makes a journey, an effort; we all come together – me, the audience, the people who run the venue – to share this wonderful, universal, human emotional interaction. This is where music lives.&quot;

A significant part of a performance by Legg is the wryly funny storytelling patter he uses between songs, some of these stories included on &quot;Adrian Legg Live&quot; (2017). His distinctive wit is also in written evidence everywhere from his liner notes to his tablature books.

Legg included the use of modeling technology and MIDI for fingerstyle guitar on his 2004 album &quot;Inheritance&quot;, which features extensive use of guitar synthesisers and modeled guitar sounds. This stands in contrast to the more acoustic sound of &quot;Guitar Bones&quot;.

In an interview with Frets, a Guitar Player publication, Adrian listed some of the signal processors and effects that he utilizes to shape his acoustic tone. This included several notable effects boxes such as the Effectrode PC-2A compressor, a Wampler Pedals Black &#x27;65 Overdrive, and an Effeectrode Helios fuzz. Adrian also endorses Neunaber Audio and is currently using a Neunaber Audio Immerse Reverberator for his reverb needs.

<text>was a town located in Kaijō District, Chiba Prefecture, Japan.

Iioka was a noted port town in the Edo period, and prospered greatly in the aftermath of the Great Fire of Meireki in 1657, as a transshipment center for timber and building materials to Edo.

Modern Iioka was formed on April 1, 1889. On March 31, 1954 it expanded through annexation of the villages of Sangawa and a part of Toyooka.

On July 1, 2005, Iioka was merged with the city of Asahi, the town of Hikata (from Katori District), and the town of Unakami (also from Kaijō District) to form the new Asahi city, and it disappeared.

<text>The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU; ) is the governing body of rugby union in the country of Wales, recognised by the sport&#x27;s international governing body, World Rugby.

The WRU is responsible for the running of rugby in Wales, overseeing 320 member clubs, the Welsh national team and National Leagues and Cups. The WRU is headed by the President (Terry Cobner), chairman (Richard Collier-Keywood) and CEO (Abi Tierney).

==History==

The roots of the Welsh Rugby Union lay in the creation of the South Wales Football Union (SWFU) in September 1875; formed, &quot;...with the intention of playing matches with the principal clubs in the West of England and the neighbourhood. The rugby rules will be the code adopted. The South Wales Football Club was superseded in 1878 by the South Wales Football Union in an attempt to bring greater regulation to the sport and to select representatives from club sides to represent the international game. The SWFU though were poorly organised, and although they arranged fixtures between a South Wales team and various English clubs, they were often victims of fixture-clashes and were accused of lacking energy. In 1880, Richard Mullock, secretary of the Newport Athletic Club, decided to take matters into his own hands and without the backing of the SWFU organised an international match against England.

The match took place on 19 February 1881, and was won by England seven goals, one dropped goal and six tries to nil. This heavy defeat lay the seeds for further reforms that would lead to the creation of the WRU.

Currently, there is confusion regarding the official date of creation of the Welsh Rugby Union. In March 1880 nine teams supposedly met at the Tenby Hotel, Swansea with the intent of creating a new union. These teams are thought to have been, Cardiff RFC, Chepstow RFC, Haverfordwest RFC, Llandaff RFC, Llanelli RFC, Neath RFC, Newport RFC, Pontypridd RFC and Swansea RFC. The issue with accepting this meeting is that there is no written evidence, just oral repetition.

On 12 March 1881, eleven clubs met in the Castle Hotel, Neath to form what would be accepted as a Welsh rugby union. After a humiliating defeat in the first Wales international rugby game, the Neath meeting was organised by Mullock to form a union that could organise regular international matches. The founding clubs of the Welsh Football Union (WFU), as it was originally known, were Swansea C &amp; FC, Pontypool RFC, Newport RFC, Merthyr RFC, Llanelli RFC, Bangor RFC, Brecon RFC, Cardiff RFC, Lampeter RFC, Llandovery RFC and Llandeilo RFC. Strangely the oldest rugby club in Wales, Neath RFC are not recorded as being present, even though the meeting took place in the town of Neath. It is unknown if this was an oversight by the committee to record the presence of the club, or if Neath RFC actually did not attend. The fact that two of the main committee members of the SWFU, John Llewellyn and Sam Clark were Neath men, and the creation of the WFU disbanded their union, is generally accepted as the reason for the absence of a Neath representative.

The WRU was a founding member of the International Rugby Football Board, now known as World Rugby, in 1886 with Scotland and Ireland, with Mullock and Horace Lyne the Welsh representatives at the formal signing of the union in 1887.

It was not until 1934 that the current name, the Welsh Rugby Union, was adopted.

==Responsibilities==

The WRU are responsible for the running of Welsh rugby, including 320 member clubs, the Welsh national team and National Leagues and Cups. The Welsh Rugby Union has a major role in the development of coaches, referees and players throughout all ages for both men and women. They also own the home of Welsh rugby union, the 74,500 capacity Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, &quot;an icon of the modern Wales&quot;.

After the national team the next highest level of representation in Wales is the four regions based around top club sides, but representing a larger area. These regions came into being in 2003 when the WRU elected to reduce the current top tier of Welsh professional rugby union from nine clubs into five regions modelled on the successful Irish provinces and the Super Rugby franchises in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The WRU had hoped to reduce the teams to four regions but Cardiff and Llanelli successfully argued for stand-alone status. After one year the Celtic Warriors region was closed down and the four surviving regional clubs are Cardiff Blues, Scarlets, Ospreys and Newport Gwent Dragons. They play in the Pro14, European Professional Club Rugby (Champions Cup and Challenge Cup) and Anglo-Welsh Cup competitions. Each region may call up players from a set of club teams within their area. These top club sides play in the 14-strong Welsh Premier Division.

In August 2008 WRU chief Roger Lewis confirmed that the body was looking at a proposal to reinstate a fifth Welsh region, based in North Wales. Lewis admitted that he regretted the decision in 2004 to close down Celtic Warriors. In September 2008 a new North Wales Rugby development team was announced, likely to be based in Wrexham; ultimately, the team was launched as RGC 1404, and was to be based in Colwyn Bay instead of Wrexham. In the same month Llanelli Scarlets changed their name to simply Scarlets, believing the new name would better represent their region beyond Llanelli.

==Rugby Services Agreement==
The current Rugby Services Agreement &quot;(or RSA)&quot; has been in place since 28 August 2014, and will be in place between the union and the four Welsh regions (Cardiff Blues, Newport Gwent Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets) for six years. The RSA delivers £8.7million a year to the Regions guaranteed to be spent on Welsh qualified players with a complex matrix of funding, also guaranteeing a further £3.6million in loan facilities from the WRU repayable during the term of the RSA. Each Region also receives a one-off £500,000 payment on signature of the new RSA.

The new agreement also allows players to be offered a National Dual Contract (NDC), which means the union will pay 60% of a NDC player&#x27;s salary and their region 40%. They also become available for all Welsh senior matches, despite if the match falls outside World Rugby&#x27;s international release windows in June and November. The WRU retained the right to play up to 13 senior international games each year with a 13-day release facility for squad training before the Six Nations and Autumn series games. The new agreement does state that the national team head coach, currently Warren Gatland, will be the sole person to decide who gets a National Dual Contract, with a long-term aim of only selecting players based in Wales. The limit on foreign players in Regional squads has been capped at a maximum of six while each Region will be allowed two so-called time serving players who will be available for Welsh selection after three years residency (rising to five years, effective from 31 December 2020).

==Criticism==
In 2008 the Welsh Language Society wrote to the WRU outlining a &quot;lack of commitment to the Welsh language&quot; and later held meetings to discuss the matter. In a statement to BBC Wales, a WRU spokesman said that it was reviewing its website and would be having more Welsh on the site.

The current logo of the Welsh Rugby Union is based on the Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers. There have been multiple calls for the WRU to use a logo &quot;more relevant to Wales&quot; as the feathers are associated by some with the &quot;English crown&quot;. Pro-independence group YesCymru created mock-up WRU logos using a leek, daffodil and harp instead of the three feathers. Using a Welsh dragon has also been proposed.

The union&#x27;s patron is Prince William, the current Prince of Wales. The naming of the Prince William Cup caused controversy in Wales in 2007, with petitions receiving more than 1,000 signatures calling for it to be named after the late Ray Gravell instead.

=== Toxic culture allegations ===
In January 2023, a BBC Wales investigation included multiple former WRU employees who made allegations of a &quot;toxic culture&quot; in the workplace of the WRU. Later that week, Steve Phillips resigned as the chief executive officer of the WRU and was replaced by Nigel Walker. WRU chair Ieuan Evans said that an external taskforce would be established to deal with the allegations.

As of November 2023, a 133-page review was completed highlighting &quot;bullying and misogyny&quot; in the WRU. A three-person chair of Dame Anne Rafferty, Quentin Smith and Maggie Alphonsi was appointed for an investigation. The review involved conducting 50 interviews with groups or individuals, and it assembled a 5,000-page document of evidence, the findings were the WRU was suffering a general &quot;failure of governance&quot;. However, the organised approach of the report has been noted as being too political for rugby union. After the publication of the findings of the report, the WRU was forced to change the personnel on an executive level in the WRU, involving the appointment of a first female Chief Executive, Abi Tierney, and Richard Collier-Keywood as the new WRU chair.

===UK neurological injuries lawsuit===
In December 2023 a group of 295 former rugby players sued World Rugby, the Rugby Football Union and the Welsh Rugby Union 
for allegedly failing to put in place reasonable measures to protect the health and safety of players. This alleged failure is said to have caused disorders such as motor neurone disease, early onset dementia, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, epilepsy and Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<doc id="862974" wikidata="Q60889" url="?curid=862974" title="Wolfgang of Regensburg">
<text>Wolfgang of Regensburg (; 934 – 31 October 994 AD) was bishop of Regensburg in Bavaria from Christmas 972 until his death. He is a saint in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. He is regarded as one of the three great German saints of the 10th century, the other two being Ulrich of Augsburg and Conrad of Constance. Towards the end of his life Wolfgang withdrew as a hermit to a solitary spot, in the Salzkammergut region of Upper Austria. Soon after Wolfgang&#x27;s death many churches chose him as their patron saint, and various towns were named after him.

==Early life==
Wolfgang was descended from the family of the Swabian Counts of Pfullingen. When seven years old, he had an ecclesiastic as a tutor at home; later he attended the celebrated monastic school at Reichenau Abbey. Here he formed a strong friendship with Henry of Babenberg, brother of Bishop Poppo of Würzburg, whom he followed to Würzburg in order to attend the lectures of the noted Italian grammarian Stephen of Novara at the cathedral school. 

After Henry was made Archbishop of Trier in 956, he summoned Wolfgang, who became a teacher in the cathedral school of Trier, and also labored for the reform of the archdiocese, despite the hostility with which his efforts were met. Wolfgang&#x27;s residence at Trier greatly influenced his monastic and ascetic tendencies, as here he came into contact with the great reform monastery of the 10th century, St. Maximin&#x27;s Abbey, Trier, where he made the acquaintance of Ramuold, the teacher of Saint Adalbert of Prague.

After the death of Archbishop Henry of Trier in 964, Wolfgang entered the Benedictine order in the Abbey of Maria Einsiedeln, Switzerland, and was ordained priest by Saint Ulrich in 968.

==Mission to the Magyars==
After their defeat in the Battle of the Lechfeld (955), Hungarians settled in ancient Pannonia, where they remained a constant menace to the empire. At the request of Ulrich, who clearly saw the danger, and at the desire of the Emperor Otto the Great, Wolfgang, according to the abbey annals, was &quot;sent to the Hungarians&quot; as the most suitable man to evangelize them.

He was followed by other missionaries sent by Piligrim, Bishop of Passau, under whose jurisdiction the new missionary region came.

==Bishop of Regensburg==

After the death of Bishop Michael of Regensburg (23 September 972) Bishop Piligrim obtained from the emperor the appointment of Wolfgang as the new bishop (Christmas 972). Wolfgang&#x27;s services in this new position were of the highest importance. As Bishop of Regensburg, Wolfgang became the tutor of Emperor Saint Henry II, who learned from him the principles which governed his life. Poppe, son of Margrave Luitpold, Archbishop of Trier (1018), and Tagino, Archbishop of Magdeburg (1004–1012), also had him as their teacher.

Wolfgang deserves credit for his disciplinary labours in his diocese. His main work in this respect was connected with the ancient and celebrated St. Emmeram&#x27;s Abbey, which he reformed by granting it once more abbots of its own, thus withdrawing it from the control of the bishops of Regensburg, who for many years had been abbots &quot;in commendam&quot;, a condition of affairs that had been far from beneficial to the abbey and monastic life. He was one of the first German bishops to do this, and his example in this was much copied across Germany in the years following. In the Benedictine monk Ramuold, whom Wolfgang called from Saint Maximin at Trier, Saint Emmeram received a capable abbot (975).

Wolfgang was an advocate of the monastic reforms of Gorze Abbey which aimed at a reestablishing adherence to the Rule of St. Benedict. He also reformed the convents of Obermünster and Niedermünster at Regensburg, chiefly by giving them as an example the convent of St. Paul, Mittelmünster, at Regensburg, which he had founded in 983. He also cooperated in the reform of the ancient and celebrated Benedictine Abbey of Niederaltaich, which had been founded by the Agilolfinger dynasty, and which from that time took on new life.

He showed genuine episcopal generosity in the liberal manner with which he met the views of the Emperor Otto II regarding the intended reduction in size of his diocese for the benefit of the new Diocese of Prague (975), to which Adalbert of Prague was appointed first bishop. As prince of the empire he performed his duties towards the emperor and the empire with the utmost scrupulousness and, like Ulrich, was one of the mainstays of the Ottonian policies.

He took part in the various imperial Diets, and, in the autumn of 978, accompanied the Emperor Otto II on his campaign to Paris, and took part in the Diet of Verona in June 983. He was succeeded by Gebhard I.

==Hermitage and death==

Apparently on account of a political dispute between Duke Henry II of Bavaria and Emperor Otto II, Wolfgang spent a year at Mondsee in 976. From there he withdrew as a hermit to a solitary spot, now the Wolfgangsee (&quot;Wolfgang&#x27;s Lake&quot;) in the Salzkammergut region of Upper Austria. He was discovered by a hunter and brought back to Regensburg.

While travelling on the Danube to Pöchlarn in Lower Austria, he fell ill at the village of Pupping, which is between Eferding and the market town of Aschach near Linz, and at his request was carried into the chapel of Saint Othmar at Pupping, where he died.

His body was taken up the Danube by his friends Count Aribo of Andechs and Archbishop Hartwich of Salzburg to Regensburg, and was solemnly buried in the crypt of Saint Emmeram. Many miracles were reported at his grave; in 1052 he was canonized.

==Veneration==

Soon after Wolfgang&#x27;s death many churches chose him as their patron saint, and various towns were named after him.

Wolfgang is sometimes counted among the Fourteen Holy Helpers. He is the patron saint of woodcutters. 

In Christian art he has been especially honoured by the medieval Tyrolean painter Michael Pacher (1430–1498), who created an imperishable memorial to him, the high altar of St. Wolfgang. In the panel pictures which are now exhibited in the Old Pinakothek at Munich are depicted in an artistic manner the chief events in the saint&#x27;s life. The Kefermarkt altarpiece in Kefermarkt in Upper Austria is another monumental Late Gothic piece of art dedicated to the saint.

The oldest portrait of Wolfgang is a miniature, painted about the year 1100 in the Evangeliary of Saint Emmeram, now in the library of the castle cathedral at Kraków.

A modern picture by Schwind is in the Schack Gallery at Munich. This painting represents the legend of Wolfgang forcing the devil to help him to build a church.

In other paintings he is generally depicted in episcopal dress, an axe in the right hand and the crozier in the left, or as a hermit in the wilderness being discovered by a hunter.

The axe refers to an incident in the life of the saint. After having selected a solitary spot in the wilderness, he prayed and then threw his axe into the thicket; the spot on which the axe fell he regarded as the place where God intended he should build his cell. This axe is still shown in the little market town of St. Wolfgang which sprang up on the spot of the old cell.

==Literature==
At the request of the Abbey of St. Emmeram, the life of Wolfgang was written by Otloh, a Benedictine monk of St. Emmeram about 1050. This life is especially important for the early medieval history both of the church and of civilization in Bavaria and Austria, and it forms the basis of all later accounts of the saint.

The oldest and best manuscript of this &quot;Vita&quot; is in the library of Einsiedeln Abbey in Switzerland (MS. No. 322), and has been printed with critical notes in &quot;Mon. Germ. His.: Script.&quot;, IV, 524–542.

<doc id="862986" wikidata="Q3746183" url="?curid=862986" title="Persis">
<text>Persis (, &quot;Persís;&quot; Old Persian: 𐎱𐎠𐎼𐎿, &quot;Parsa&quot;), also called Persia proper, is a historic region in southwestern Iran, roughly corresponding with Fars province. The Persian ethnic group are thought to have initially migrated either from Central Asia or, more probably, from the north through the Caucasus. They would then have migrated to the current region of Persis in the early 1st millennium BC. The country name Persia was derived directly from the Old Persian &quot;Parsa&quot;.

==Achaemenid Empire==
The ancient Persians were present in the region of Persis from about the 10th century BC. They became the rulers of the largest empire the world had yet seen under the Achaemenid dynasty which was established in the late 6th century BC, at its peak stretching from Thrace-Macedonia, Bulgaria-Paeonia and Eastern Europe proper in the west, to the Indus Valley in its far east. The ruins of Persepolis and Pasargadae, two of the four capitals of the Achaemenid Empire, are located in Fars.

==Macedonian Empire==
The Achaemenid Empire was defeated by Alexander the Great in 330 BC, incorporating most of their vast empire.

Several Hellenistic satraps of Persis are known (following the conquests of Alexander the Great) from circa 330 BC, especially Phrasaortes, who ruled from 330 to 324 BC; Orxines, who usurped his position and was then executed by Alexander; and the Macedonian general Peucestas, who learned the Persian language and followed local customs, implementing a persophile policy. Peucestas retained the satrapy of Persis until the Battle of Gabiene (316 BC), after which he was removed from his position by Antigonus. A short period of Antigonid rule followed, until Seleucus took possession of the region in 312 BC.

==Seleucid Empire==

When the Seleucid Empire was established, it possibly never extended its power beyond the main trade routes in Fars, and by the reign of Antiochus I or possibly later, Persis emerged as a state with a level of independence that minted its own coins.

;&quot;Frataraka&quot; Governors of the Seleucid Empire

Several later Persian rulers, forming the &quot;Frataraka&quot; dynasty, are known to have acted as representatives of the Seleucids in the region of Fārs. They ruled from the end of the 3rd century BC to the beginning of the 2nd century BC, and Vahbarz or Vādfradād I obtained independence circa 150 BC, when Seleucid power waned in the areas of southwestern Persia and the Persian Gulf region.

==Kings of Persis, under the Parthian Empire==
During an apparent transitional period, corresponding to the reigns of Vādfradād II and another uncertain king, no titles of authority appeared on the reverse of their coins. The earlier title &quot;prtrk&#x27; zy alhaya&quot; (Frataraka) had disappeared. Under Dārēv I however, the new title of &quot;mlk&quot;, or king, appeared, sometimes with the mention of &quot;prs&quot; (Persis), suggesting that the kings of Persis had become independent rulers.

When the Parthian Arsacid king Mithridates I (ca. 171–138 BC) took control of Persis, he left the Persian dynasts in office, known as the Kings of Persis, and they were allowed to continue minting coins with the title of &quot;mlk&quot; (&quot;King&quot;).

==Sasanian Empire==
Babak was the ruler of a small town called Kheir. Babak&#x27;s efforts in gaining local power at the time escaped the attention of Artabanus IV, the Arsacid Emperor of the time. Babak and his eldest son Shapur managed to expand their power over all of Persis.

The subsequent events are unclear, due to the sketchy nature of the sources. It is however certain that following the death of Babak around 220, Ardashir who at the time was the governor of Darabgird, got involved in a power struggle of his own with his elder brother Shapur. The sources tell us that in 222, Shapur was killed when the roof of a building collapsed on him.

Ardaxšir (Artaxerxes) V, defeated the last legitimate Parthian king, Artabanos V in AD 224, and was crowned at Ctesiphon as Ardaxšir I (Ardashir I), &quot;šāhanšāh ī Ērān&quot;, becoming the first king of the new Sasanian Empire.

At this point, Ardashir moved his capital further to the south of Persis and founded a capital at Ardashir-Khwarrah (formerly Gur, modern day Firouzabad).
After establishing his rule over Persis, Ardashir I rapidly extended the territory of his Sassanid Persian Empire, demanding fealty from the local princes of Fars, and gaining control over the neighboring provinces of Kerman, Isfahan, Susiana, and Mesene.
Artabanus marched a second time against Ardashir I in 224. Their armies clashed at Hormizdegan, where Artabanus IV was killed. Ardashir was crowned in 226 at Ctesiphon as the sole ruler of Persia, bringing the 400-year-old Parthian Empire to an end, and starting the virtually equally long rule of the Sassanian Empire, over an even larger territory, once again making Persia a leading power in the known world, only this time along with its arch-rival and successor to Persia&#x27;s earlier opponents (the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire); the Byzantine Empire.

The Sassanids ruled for 425 years, until the Muslim armies conquered the empire. Afterward, the Persians started to convert to Islam, this making it much easier for the new Muslim empire to continue the expansion of Islam.

Persis then passed hand to hand through numerous dynasties, leaving behind numerous historical and ancient monuments; each of which has its own values as a world heritage, reflecting the history of the province, Iran, and West Asia. The ruins of Bishapur, Persepolis, and Firouzabad are all reminders of this. Arab invaders brought about a decline of Zoroastrian rule and made Islam ascendant from the 7th century.

<text>Air Niagara is a zeppelin blimp operator and formerly a scheduled passenger airline that previously operated jet aircraft based in the New York side of the Niagara Falls. It was one of the many airlines that started flying after the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 in the United States. The company was acquired in early 2022 and is currently working on operating zeppelin tours.

A Canadian-based airline which operated Convair 580 turboprop and Fokker F28 Fellowship jet aircraft in the province of Ontario also used the Air Niagara name from the late 1980s to 2000.

Air Niagara offered jet flights from Niagara Falls International Airport (IAG) with the assumption that tourism in their home region would propel the airline to profitability.

The airline was one of the few air carriers to serve that airport with jet flights from 1982 to 1984 (in 1983, Empire Airlines (1976-1985) was also operating jet service into the airport with Fokker F28 Fellowship twin jets). Air Niagara operated two Boeing 727-100s formerly operated by Eastern Air Lines (registrations N8101N and N8104N) and was serving only two routes in late 1982 with nonstop flights between Niagara Falls and Newark Airport (EWR) in New Jersey and also nonstop between Niagara Falls and John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York City. The airline&#x27;s 727s had been delivered new to Eastern in 1964 (both airplanes ended up being broken up and scrapped in Mexico in 1994).

Air Niagara ceased operations in 1984 until the company and trademark was acquired in 2022. Air Niagara now plans on offering blimp air flights in collaboration with Hybrid Air Vehicles, a British limited company and a British manufacturer of hybrid airships. 

As of 2023, the company&#x27;s assets have been resold and the current state of Air Niagara is unknown.

<doc id="862995" wikidata="Q1751767" url="?curid=862995" title="Free-thinking Democratic League">
<text>The Free-thinking Democratic League (, VDB) was a progressive liberal political party in the Netherlands. Established in 1901, it played a relatively large role in Dutch politics, supplying one Prime Minister, Wim Schermerhorn. The League is a predecessor of two of the major Dutch political parties, the conservative liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the social democratic Labour Party (PvdA). The social liberal Democrats 66 also claims that it and the VDB are ideologically connected.

==Name==
Like some other liberal parties in Europe, such as the Free Democratic Party of Switzerland, the party did not have the word &quot;liberal&quot; in its name because of its connotation with conservative liberalism. Instead it used the term &quot;vrijzinnig&quot;, which is difficult to translate into English. The term, which literally translated would be &quot;free-thinking&quot; or &quot;free-minded&quot; has meanings in the Protestant church referring to more liberal or latitudinarian tendencies in the church, rather than secular freethought, as well as more progressive and social tendencies in liberalism, as opposed to classical liberalism.

The term &quot;Democratic&quot; is included in the parties name because of its clear commitment to further democratisation of the Dutch political system. The term &quot;League&quot; is used instead of &quot;Party&quot; because the organisation was not a centralised, strictly organised mass party but rather a loose league of politicians and local caucuses. In liberal circles parties were seen as factionalist and incompatible with the common good.

==History==
===Background===
The VDB was a merger of two groups; one, the Radical League, was founded in 1892 as an Amsterdam secession of the Liberal Union; they left the Union over the issue of universal suffrage. The second group was the Free-thinking Democratic political club (Dutch: &quot;Vrijzinnig Democratische Kamerclub&quot; or &quot;VD-kamerclub&quot;). This was a club of Liberal Union MPs (in 1901, it had about 25 members, out of 35 Liberal Union MPs and 100 MPs in total). The second group left the Union over the same matter. In 1901, the board of the Liberal Union, supported by the &quot;VD-kamerclub&quot;, proposed that all its candidates would stand on a platform of universal suffrage. The party congress rejected this proposal. In reaction to this the party&#x27;s board, some of the members of the &quot;VD-kamerclub&quot;, and some of the party caucuses left the party.

===Founding and early history===
The two groups, the Radical League and the &quot;VD-kamerclub&quot;, merged in 1901 to form the Free-minded Democratic League. In the 1901 elections they won nine seats. The party always remained rather small, but because of its strategic position and the quality of its MPs, the party was very influential.

Although the VDB had split from the Liberal Union and the other liberal split, the League of Free Liberals, was against universal suffrage, they still needed each other to form a liberal alternative to the Christian democratic Coalition. In many districts there was only one liberal candidate supported by all three liberal parties.

In 1905, the VDB won two additional seats. From 1905 to 1908 the Liberal Union and the VDB formed a liberal minority cabinet led by Theo de Meester. The cabinet was supported by Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (SDAP). In the 1909 election the Coalition regained its majority. The VDB lost two seats, making its total nine. In the 1913 election the Christian democrats lost their majority. The VDB lost four seats, because it was not the only liberal party in favour of universal suffrage; the Liberal Union and the League of Free Liberals had also included in their programmes. Furthermore, the SDAP performed exceptionally well in these elections. The leader of the VDB, Dirk Bos, attempted to form a government with the liberals, free liberals, socialists and free-thinking democrats. The socialists refused to cooperate, because one of their major issues (unilateral disarmament of the Netherlands) could not be realised. A liberal extra-parliamentary cabinet was formed, led by Pieter Cort van der Linden. It implemented universal suffrage and proportional representation.

During this cabinet, a conflict between the VDB parliamentary party and minister Willem Treub led to his resignation. Treub left the party and founded the Economic League, which would merge with the Liberal Union to form the Liberal State Party.

===Interwar years===
In the 1918 elections, with universal suffrage and proportional representation in place, the liberal alliance lost nearly half its seats. The VDB remains relatively stable with five seats, but they were nonetheless forced to a position in opposition to a Christian democratic cabinet. In 1919, however, VDB leader Henri Marchant initiated the law for female suffrage. In the 1922 elections the party retained its five seats. Betsy Bakker-Nort became the party&#x27;s first female member of the House of Representatives.

In 1925, the party was instrumental in the fall of the cabinet led by Hendrikus Colijn: each year the orthodox Protestant Reformed Political Party (SGP) proposed that the Dutch representation at the Vatican be removed. The Protestant SGP was fervently anti-Catholic. This proposal was always supported by the Protestant Christian Historical Union (CHU), which was part of the Catholic-Protestant cabinet, but nonetheless had an anti-Catholic history. For the Catholic leader Nolens, this Papal representation was of utmost importance. In 1925 the VDB had convinced the other opposition parties that this was their chance to let the government fall and create a progressive cabinet. The entire opposition voted with the SGP and CHU, and the cabinet fell. In the following 1925 elections the party gained two seats. The party leader, Marchant, attempted to form a progressive government with the Roman Catholic State Party (RKSP), the SDAP and the VDB. He failed, however, and a new Christian democratic cabinet was formed.

In the 1929 elections, the VDB retained its seven seats. In 1933, the party lost one seat. Nonetheless, the party was asked to cooperate in the centre-right government led by Colijn, which consisted of the Catholic RKSP, the Protestant CHU and ARP, and the liberal VDB and Liberal State Party. The VDB cooperated in the budget cuts and the strengthening of the Dutch armed forces. The previously good relations with the SDAP came under considerable strain from this. In 1933 the party&#x27;s leader, Marchant, who also served as minister of Education, stepped down because he had turned Catholic. Pieter Oud took his place as political leader of the VDB, until he became major of Rotterdam in 1938. In 1937, they managed to retain their seven seats. In 1941, the party was forbidden by the German occupying force. The VDB played a minor role in the 1940-1945 cabinets in exile.

===Dissolution===
After the German occupation, there was a widespread feeling that a new political party was necessary, one that was not part of the pillarised system. This movement was called the Breakthrough. Willem Schermerhorn became the first Prime Minister after the Second World War. He led a cabinet composed out of progressives of all parties. In 1946 the VDB merged with the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party and the progressive Christian Democratic Union (CDU) to form the modern-day Labour Party (PvdA). However, this party soon strengthened its ties to democratic-socialist organisations. In 1948, a group dissatisfied with the failed &quot;Breakthrough&quot; and the increasingly socialist tint of the PvdA left the party. These were all former VDB members, led by former VDB leader Pieter Oud. They joined with the conservative liberal Freedom Party (PvdV) to form the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy.

==Ideology and issues==

The VDB started out as a left, social or progressive liberal party, committed to universal suffrage and the construction of a welfare state. It favoured the democratisation of the Dutch political system. Female suffrage was one of its most important issues. It favoured government influence in the national economy by nationalising crucial industries. It also believed that government should play an important part in ensuring the welfare of the population; hence, it favoured the implementation of state pensions for the elderly.

In the 1930s, the leader of the party, Pieter Oud, was somewhat more conservative than his predecessors, at least fiscally, supporting as Minister of Finance the strict fiscally conservative line of the Cabinet.

Before World War I, it favoured an army formed by national conscription. After the war and until the 1930s, it favoured unilateral disarmament. This position was abandoned with the rise of international tensions after 1933.

The VDB was mainly supported by atheists and liberal protestants from higher classes: the party was supported by civil servants, intellectuals and educated teachers. Regionally, the VDB received most of its support form the large cities Amsterdam and Rotterdam, but also from provincial centres in Groningen, Drenthe, North and South Holland.

==Electoral performance==
===General elections===
===Municipal government===
In its strongholds of Amsterdam and Rotterdam, the party provided various mayors. The former VDB leader Oud was mayor of Rotterdam between 1938 and 1941. In 1919, Maria Elisabeth Stellwag-Bes became party leader for the VDB in the municipal elections in Delft and was elected to the Delft municipal council. Deputy leader Corry Tendeloo, who later became instrumental in the legal advancement of women&#x27;s rights, was a member of the municipal council in Amsterdam.

==Organisation==
===Parliamentary leadership===
* Parliamentary leaders in the House of Representatives
** Hendrik Drucker (18 September 1901 – 29 June 1913)
** Dirk Bos (29 June 1913 – 6 May 1916)
** Henri Marchant (16 May 1916 – 27 May 1933)
** Dolf Joekes (1 June 1933 – 20 September 1937)
** Pieter Oud (20 September 1937 – 15 October 1938)
** Dolf Joekes (16 October 1938 – 9 February 1946)

* Parliamentary leaders in the Senate
** David van Embden (September 1923 – 9 January 1946)
===Pillarisation===
The VDB lacked a real system of pillarised organisations around it. &quot;Neutral&quot; organisations, which were not linked to a pillar, often had friendly relations with the VDB. This included the general broadcasting association AVRO (Algemene Verenigde Radio Omroep, General United Radio Broadcasting Organisation), the general union ANWV (Algemene Nederlandse Werkelieden Vereniging, the General Dutch Workers&#x27; Association); furthermore, the neutral employers&#x27; organisation VNO and the financial paper &quot;Het Handelsblad&quot; had good relations with the League. Together with the other liberal party, the Liberal State Party, these organisations formed the weak general pillar.

===Relationships with other parties===
The VDB was part of the Concentration the alliance with the liberal Liberal Union and League of Free Liberals. These parties had good relations. The VDB served as bridge between the liberals and the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (SDAP). The SDAP supported two liberal minority cabinets, but the SDAP was unwilling to join a cabinet with these bourgeoise parties in 1913. After 1918, when the liberals lost more than half of their seats, the relations with Concentration dissolved and the two other concentration parties merged to form the Liberal State Party. The VDB continued to serve as the bridge between liberals and socialists. This strategy resulted in the fall of the second Ruijs de Beerenbrouck cabinet in 1925. The VDB was unable to form a government of liberals, socialists and Catholics. In 1933 the relations between the SDAP and the VDB worsened as the VDB joined the Colijn cabinet, which had a very conservative economic policy. Their cooperation in World War II improved the relations between SDAP and VDB considerably. This led to the &quot;Doorbraak&quot; and the formation of the Labour Party with the SDAP and the VDB is its major components.

<text>Drzymała&#x27;s wagon () was a house on wheels built by peasant Michał Drzymała (1857-1937) as a protest against Imperial Germany&#x27;s policy of Germanization in its Polish territories. Drzymała was not only able to circumvent German building regulations by moving his home every day, but with his wagon-home, became a Polish folk hero during the Partitions of Poland.

In 1886, by resolution of the Prussian Landtag, a Settlement Commission had been established to encourage German settlement in the Province of Posen and West Prussia. The Commission was empowered to purchase vacant property of the Polish szlachta and sell it to approved German applicants. The Prussian government regarded this as a measure designed to counteract the German &quot;Flight from the East&quot; (&quot;Ostflucht&quot;) and reduce the number of Poles. In Polish eyes, the establishment of the Commission was an aggressive measure designed to drive Poles from their lands. 

While the campaign against Polish landownership largely missed its aims, it produced a strong opposition with its own hero, Drzymała. In 1904 he purchased a plot of land in Pogradowitz in the Posen district of Bomst, but found that the newly implemented Prussian &quot;Feuerstättengesetz&quot; (&quot;furnace law&quot;) enabled local officials to deny him as a Pole the permission to build a permanent dwelling with an oven on his land. The law considered any place of stay a house if it stayed in one place for more than 24 hours. To get around the rule, he set himself up in a former circus caravan and for several years tenaciously defied in the courts all attempts to remove him. Each day, Drzymała moved the wagon a short distance, thereby exploiting the loophole and avoiding any legal penalties, until in 1909 he was able to buy an existent farmhouse nearby. 

The case attracted publicity all over Germany. The German &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; measures and the Settlement Commission ultimately succeeded in stimulating the Polish national sentiment that they had been designed to suppress.

<text>The Radical League () was a progressive liberal political party in the Netherlands from its founding in 1892 until it merged with the left wing of the Liberal Union to form the Free-thinking Democratic League in 1901.

==History==
The Radical League originated out of the local progressive liberal caucus &quot;Amsterdam&quot;. Leaders of this caucus initiated the formation of a national political party in July 1892, and this resulted in the founding of the Radical League on 9 November 1892. The foremost leader of the new party was the Amsterdam alderman Willem Treub. The party focused on the extension of universal suffrage as well as combating social deprivation.

In 1893, the party won the Leeuwarden seat in a by-election. The newly elected MP was former Amsterdam alderman Carel Victor Gerritsen, who was also the husband of feminist Aletta Jacobs. In 1894 the party won two additional seats. They played a minor role in parliament. In 1897 they won an additional seat. The Radicals supported the progressive liberal Pierson cabinet, although they were not necessary for its majority. On 17 March 1901, the League merged with another group of progressive former Liberal Union members to form the Free-thinking Democratic League.

==Ideology &amp; issues==
The League was a progressive liberal and radical democratic party, committed to implementation of universal suffrage and social laws. The party was inspired by &quot;kathedersocialisme&quot;, the progressive politics professed by latitudinarian preachers. It championed democratisation of the political system by abolishing the Senate and the implementation of a referendum. It favoured the nationalisation of crucial industries like the railways.

==Election results==
This table shows the League&#x27;s results in elections to the House of Representatives.

===Local government===
The party was particularly strong in Amsterdam. Treub was alderman there.

==Electorate==
The League&#x27;s electorate centered on Amsterdam, where intellectuals, journalists, teachers and educated workers supported the party.

==Pillarisation==
The small and localised Radical League lacked a system of pillarised organisations around it. The weekly magazine &quot;De Amsterdammer&quot; (&quot;The Amsterdammer&quot;) sympathised with the party however.

<doc id="863009" wikidata="Q6832" url="?curid=863009" title="Ravensburg">
<text>Ravensburg (Swabian: &quot;Raveschburg&quot;) is a city in Upper Swabia in Southern Germany, capital of the district of Ravensburg, Baden-Württemberg.

Ravensburg was first mentioned in 1088. In the Middle Ages, it was an Imperial Free City and an important trading centre. The &quot;Great Ravensburg Trading Society&quot; (&quot;Große Ravensburger Handelsgesellschaft&quot;) owned shops and trading companies all over Europe.

The historic city centre is still very much intact, including three city gates and over 10 towers of the medieval fortification.

==History==
Ravensburg was first mentioned in writing in 1088. It was founded by the Welfs, a Frankish dynasty in Swabia who became later Dukes of Bavaria and Saxony and who made the castle of Ravensburg their ancestral seat.

By a contract of inheritance, in 1191 the Hohenstaufen Frederick Barbarossa acquired the ownership of Ravensburg from Welf VI, Duke of Spoleto and uncle of both Frederick Barbarossa and Henry the Lion.

With the death of Conradin 1268 in Naples the Hohenstaufen line became extinct. Their former estates became imperial property of the Holy Roman Empire. Like many other cities in Swabia, at the end of the 13th century Ravensburg became an Imperial Free City in 1276.

The &quot;Great Ravensburg Trading Society&quot; (&quot;Große Ravensburger Handelsgesellschaft&quot;) was founded at Ravensburg and Konstanz around 1380 by the merchant families of Humpis (from Ravensburg), Mötteli (from Buchhorn, modern-day Friedrichshafen) and Muntprat (from Constance). At first, the society mostly dealt in the production of linen and fustian. With the opening of one of the first paper mills north of the Alps in 1402 in Ravensburg, paper became another commodity. The Ravensburg stores also sold oriental spices, Mediterranean wines and Bohemian ores. After the liquidation of the Great Ravensburg Trading Society in 1530, Ravensburg stagnated economically. The Thirty Years&#x27; War caused a grave decline of the population. Swedish troops destroyed the old castle, now named &quot;Veitsburg&quot; after the St. Veit chapel at the castle grounds.

Following the Reformation a &quot;paritetic&quot; government emerged, meaning an equal distribution of public offices between the Catholic and Protestant confession. The city council was one half each Protestant and Catholic. For some time there was even a Catholic and a Protestant mayor at the same time, and both confessions celebrated the village fair, the &quot;Rutenfest&quot;, apart from each other. This system was approved at the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in the Peace of Westphalia (1648) which named four &quot;Paritetic Imperial Cities&quot; (): Augsburg, Biberach, Dinkelsbühl and Ravensburg.

In 1803 the &quot;Immerwährende Reichstag&quot; passed the &quot;Reichsdeputationshauptschluss&quot;, a bill which included the secularisation and mediatisation of many German states — the first meaning the confiscation of the estates belonging to the church, the second the incorporation of the imperial estates and Imperial Free Cities into larger regional states. As a result, Ravensburg first became a Bavarian exclave within Württemberg. After a swap of estates between Bavaria and Württemberg it was incorporated in the Kingdom of Württemberg in 1810.

Since Ravensburg was impoverished and depopulated after the Thirty Years&#x27; War, only a few new buildings were raised during the 18th and the early 19th century. The benefit of this economic stagnation was the conservation of a widely intact medieval city with nearly all towers and gates of the historic fortification.

===20th century===
During World War II Ravensburg was strategically of no relevance. Ravensburg did not harbor any noteworthy arms industry (unlike nearby Friedrichshafen with its large aircraft industry), but was home to a major aid supplies center belonging to the Swiss Red Cross. The historic city centre was not damaged by air raids.

By 1945, the city came into the French occupation zone and thus came in 1947 to the newly founded state of Württemberg-Hohenzollern, which in 1952 merged to the state of Baden-Württemberg.

In the 1970s, Ravensburg increased in population and territory by the incorporation of smaller communities like Eschach, Schmalegg and Taldorf. Ravensburg University of Cooperative Education was established in the city in 1978.

In the 1980s, the Old Town was renovated and all transit traffic was banned from the city centre.
==Economy and infrastructure==
Ravensburg is a thriving shopping city in the wealthy region of Upper Swabia. Unemployment is relatively low. The nearest large cities are Munich, Stuttgart and Zürich, approximately a two-hour drive away each. Ulm, Konstanz and Bregenz are each less than a one-hour drive away.

Ravensburg is part of an urban agglomeration that also comprises Weingarten (Württemberg) and several suburbs. Ravensburg, Weingarten, and Friedrichshafen (on the shores of Lake Constance) share the functionality of a &quot;Oberzentrum&quot; (that is, the highest-ranked centre in the system of spatial planning and development in Baden-Württemberg).

===Transport===
Ravensburg is located at a crossing of the federal roads (national highways) B30, B31 and B32. A by-pass highway around Ravensburg and Weingarten was completed recently. The regional airport is situated at Friedrichshafen, about 15 km south of Ravensburg. The nearest national motor-ways are the A7 and A8 (approach at Ulm) and the A96 (approach at Lindau or Wangen im Allgäu).

In 1847, the railway station of Ravensbug was put in operation, part of the so-called &quot;Swabian Railroad&quot; from Stuttgart to Friedrichshafen, the oldest railroad of Württemberg and well known in all of Germany by the folk-style song &quot;&quot;.

In 1888, the Ravensburg–Weingarten–Baienfurt tram line was open.

===Local businesses===
Mechanical engineering has traditionally been the main type of industry in the region. Based on the demand of the paper and textile industries (now widely reduced) and a long tradition of flour, paper and other mills, many engineering factories arose at the end of the 19th century. Today the primary engineering firms in Ravensburg are the left-overs of the former Escher-Wyss AG (a subsidiary of the Swiss &quot;Sulzer AG&quot;) which are now subsidiaries of the Austrian &quot;Andritz Hydro&quot;.

&quot;Ravensburger AG&quot;, whose headquarters are located in the city, is a company internationally known for board games, jigsaw puzzles and children&#x27;s books.

The pastry factory &quot;:de:Tekrum&quot; (Theodor Krumm GmbH &amp; Co. KG) is another company with an internationally known brand name. Since January 2005 it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Griesson–de Beukelaer.

Other large industrial companies include:
*&quot;Vetter Pharma&quot;, a manufacturer of pre-filled injection systems
*&quot;Omira&quot;, one of the largest dairies in southern Germany
*the tool factory &quot;Hawera Probst&quot; (a subsidiary of Robert Bosch), the worldwide market leader in hammer drill bits
*the component supplier &quot;EBZ Engineering Bausch &amp; Ziege&quot; (formerly &quot;Nothelfer&quot;, a subsidiary of ThyssenKrupp Automotive)
*the packaging manufacturer &quot;Coveris Rigid&quot; (formerly Autobar Packaging)
*two suppliers of solar power systems, &quot;Pro Solar Solarstrom&quot; and &quot;pro solar Energietechnik&quot;

===Media===
The local newspaper is the &quot;Schwäbische Zeitung&quot;.

The radio companies &quot;Radio 7&quot; and &quot;Südwestrundfunk&quot; run broadcasting studios at Ravensburg.
In Horgenzell near Ravensburg, the &quot;Ravensburg-Horgenzell transmitter&quot; transmitted Deutschlandfunk on the medium wave frequency 756 kHz.

==Culture==
The city&#x27;s most popular festival is the annual &quot;Rutenfest&quot;, which takes place mid year.

==Sport==
The city&#x27;s association football club FV Ravensburg, formed in 1893, has played in the Oberliga Baden-Württemberg on three occasions from 1978 to 1983, from 1998 to 2000 and again since 2003.

From 2006 to 2010, Ravensburg hosted the Air Canada Cup or MLP Nations Cup, an international women&#x27;s ice hockey tournament.

<text>Thomas Dowse, also known as Thomas Dawse and Thomas Dawles (will read, June 4, 1683) was an English-American immigrant who represented City of Henricus in the first meeting of the House of Burgesses on July 30, 1619 at Jamestown, Virginia.

==Biography==
Dowse was born in England, but migrated to the American colonies, becoming one of the &quot;ancient planters&quot;.

Brown states in his &quot;First Republic in America,&quot; that, in 1619, &quot;the City of Henricus included Henrico (Farrar&#x27;s Island), extending thence on both sides of James River to the westward, the pale run by Dale between the said river and the Appomattox River being the line on the South Side.&quot; It was represented in the House of Burgesses by Thomas Dowse and John Pollington sometimes shown as John Polentine. Henrico having been selected as the site for a college and university, the first college in America, ten thousand acres (40 km²) were set by, as agreed, and the limits of the corporation were extended from the Falls of the James on the Popham side to what is now called Farrar&#x27;s Island. 

Dowse was the only survivor of the attack launched by Opossunoquonuske and her Appomattoc warriors against a retaliatory attack from the Jamestown settlement in 1610. Dowse played a tabor (instrument) and danced to lure the natives from cover. He protected himself by using the rudder of the men&#x27;s boat as a shield. The English destroyed the Indians&#x27; village in retaliation for the massacre.

<doc id="863018" wikidata="Q451399" url="?curid=863018" title="Edge of Darkness">
<text>Edge of Darkness is a British television drama serial produced by BBC Television in association with Lionheart Television International and originally broadcast in six 50 to 55-minute episodes in late 1985. A mixture of crime drama and political thriller, it revolves around the efforts of widowed policeman Ronald Craven (played by Bob Peck) to unravel the truth behind the murder of his daughter Emma (played by Joanne Whalley). Craven&#x27;s investigations soon lead him into a murky world of government and corporate cover-ups and nuclear espionage, pitting him against dark forces that threaten the future of life on Earth.

Writer Troy Kennedy Martin was greatly influenced by the political climate of the time, dominated by the Thatcher government, and the aura of secrecy surrounding the nuclear industry – and by the implications of the Gaia hypothesis of environmentalist James Lovelock; these combined to him writing a thriller that mingled real world concerns with mythic and mystical elements. Kennedy Martin&#x27;s original ending was more fantastic than that eventually used in the finished serial: he had proposed that Craven would turn into a tree but this was vetoed by members of the cast and crew.

First broadcast on BBC2, &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; was met with such widespread critical acclaim that within days it had earned a repeat on BBC1. Winner of several prestigious awards, it remains highly regarded, often cited as one of the best and most influential pieces of British television drama. The series&#x27; director, Martin Campbell, filmed a remake, released in January 2010, starring Mel Gibson and set in the United States.

==Plot==

===One: Compassionate Leave===
Yorkshire police officer Ronald Craven is returning home with his daughter Emma having picked her up from a meeting of an environmental organisation at her university campus. On the doorstep of their home Emma is shot dead. The police concentrate their effort on the theory that her murder was a botched attempt on Craven&#x27;s life by a criminal he had been responsible for convicting. However, as Craven goes through Emma&#x27;s belongings, he discovers a geiger counter and a gun. He also learns that Emma&#x27;s body and her possessions are radioactive. Travelling to London to assist with the inquiry, he is contacted by Pendleton, a polished official &quot;attached to the Prime Minister&#x27;s office&quot;, who informs him that Emma was known to them as a terrorist and that she may have been the gunman&#x27;s target. (Aired 4 November 1985).

===Two: Into The Shadows===
As he continues his investigations, Craven is visited by Emma&#x27;s ghost. The fingerprints on the getaway car used by Emma&#x27;s killer match those of Lowe, a man Craven arrested 10 years ago. Pendleton takes Craven to meet his colleague, Harcourt, who informs him that Emma was a member of a subversive anti-nuclear group called Gaia. A team of six Gaia members, led by Emma, had broken into a low level radioactive waste facility at Northmoor; all are now either dead or missing. After Craven makes a televised appeal for information about Emma&#x27;s killer, he is contacted by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent Darius Jedburgh, an associate of Harcourt and Pendleton. Jedburgh shows Craven the CIA&#x27;s file on Emma&#x27;s activities: Gaia had become suspicious of Northmoor when a nearby reservoir had become contaminated with radioactive material, an occurrence that had also alerted the CIA, leading them to believe Northmoor was illegally storing plutonium. Jedburgh is played as a hard-bitten professional with a wry sense of humour and a passion for golfing. Along with Harcourt and Pendleton, he is keen to find the source and purpose of the plutonium. (Aired 11 November 1985).

===Three: Burden of Proof===
The police close in on their suspect, Lowe, who is severely injured in a fall while trying to escape. Dying, he tells Craven he was working with McCroon, a terrorist Craven had convicted in Northern Ireland. Emma&#x27;s boyfriend, Terry Shields, tells Craven that she was investigating a hot cell in Northmoor; he is later killed. Craven meets Harcourt and Pendleton at the House of Commons. There, an inquiry is taking place into the sale of International Irradiated Fuels (IIF) at Northmoor, run by Robert Bennett to the Fusion Corporation of Kansas, owned by Jerry Grogan. Pendleton tells Craven that he believes Bennett was behind Emma&#x27;s death. Returning to Yorkshire for Emma&#x27;s funeral, Craven is refused permission to seek a warrant to enter Northmoor. Returning home, he is observed by McCroon. (Aired 18 November 1985).

===Four: Breakthrough===
McCroon breaks into Craven&#x27;s house intent on killing him. Craven demands McCroon tell him who he is working for but McCroon is shot by a police marksman before he can say anything. Through a contact of Mac (Struan Roger), a colleague from his time in Northern Ireland, Craven gains access to a terminal connected to the MI5 computer. He checks the MI5 records for Gaia, Northmoor and Emma and learns that McCroon was acting on the orders of Northmoor Security. He also obtains a three-dimensional map of Northmoor from the computer. Craven contacts Jedburgh and asks him to accompany him inside Northmoor. (Aired 25 November 1985).

===Five: Northmoor===
Craven and Jedburgh penetrate Northmoor and discover the hot cell which has been sealed off following an explosion – a consequence of Gaia&#x27;s attempted break-in. Jedburgh, under orders from the CIA, enters the hot cell and steals the plutonium. At the House of Commons inquiry, IIF chief executive Robert Bennett admits to the presence of plutonium at Northmoor. Further, he admits to deliberately causing the deaths by drowning of the Gaia team to prevent them from removing plutonium from the site. He justifies both the deaths, and the failure to report to any regulatory body, by stating that the plutonium was the property of the Ministry of Defence. (Aired 2 December 1985).

===Six: Fusion===
Craven and Jedburgh escape Northmoor but both are dying from radiation poisoning. Jedburgh makes for the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland, which is hosting a NATO conference on directed energy weapons. 

In London, Harcourt advises his Minister that Northmoor has been illegally producing plutonium. The Minister counters that Northmoor were doing so for the Ministry of Defence via an experimental method, were therefore exempt from normal regulation, and that he had been aware since the secret program&#x27;s start. Harcourt&#x27;s involvement was only intended as a deception to allay American suspicions.

Arriving late at the conference is Grogan, who announces that the British government has approved his company&#x27;s purchase of IIF and speaks with cold passion of harnessing the power of the atom. The audience of military and civilian officials applauds but Jedburgh, in a U.S. Army uniform, takes the dais to denounce nuclear proliferation. He finishes by bringing together two bars of plutonium he has removed from Northmoor, causing a criticality accident and irradiating himself and the nearby Grogan.

Emma&#x27;s ghost appears to Craven and tells him of a time when black flowers grew, warming the Earth and preventing life from becoming extinct. She tells him that the black flowers have returned and will melt the polar icecaps, destroying mankind so that life can continue. Craven goes to dissuade Jedburgh from the next step in his plan, which is to cause a nuclear explosion in Scotland with the rest of the plutonium. He succeeds, though the secret service follow him and kill Jedburgh. Craven, who like Jedburgh and Grogan has been fatally exposed to radiation, wanders into the mountains to die, calling Emma&#x27;s name. On the mountains, as Emma predicted, the black flowers are growing, foreshadowing the planet&#x27;s defensive war against humanity. (Aired 9 December 1985).

==Principal credits==

===Cast===
* Ronald Craven was played by Bob Peck, an actor who was well known in theatre but, at the time he was cast as Craven, had appeared in only minor roles on television. In creating the role of Craven, Peck drew upon his experience gained from the two years he played the title role in &quot;Macbeth&quot; for the Royal Shakespeare Company. Notable roles after &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; included &quot;On the Black Hill&quot; (1987), &quot;Slipstream&quot; (1989), &quot;Natural Lies&quot; (1992) and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993). He died in 1999.
* Joanne Whalley, who played Emma Craven, began acting during childhood, first appearing in the long-running soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (1960–present) in 1974 at the age of 13. She had also appeared in supporting roles in several series including &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot; (1980–1985), &quot;Bergerac&quot; (1981–1991) and &quot;Reilly, Ace of Spies&quot; (1983). Following &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;, Whalley was cast in the equally well regarded BBC television serial &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; (1986), written by Dennis Potter. Moving to Hollywood, she appeared in such films as &quot;Willow&quot; (1988), &quot;Scandal&quot; (1989) and &quot;Shattered&quot; (1991) as well as television mini-series such as &quot;Scarlett&quot; (1994) and &quot;Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis&quot; (2000). During her eight-year marriage to the actor Val Kilmer, between 1988 and 1996, she was often credited as Joanne Whalley-Kilmer.
* Cast as Darius Jedburgh was Joe Don Baker, who had been acting since the 1960s and was known for his roles in Westerns such as &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (1955–1975) and as the lead in the detective series &quot;Eischied&quot; (1979–1980). He also starred as Sherriff Buford Pusser in the original 1972 film &quot;Walking Tall&quot;. The script of &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; so impressed him that he agreed to take the part at lower than his usual fee. He was later cast, by &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; director Martin Campbell, as CIA agent Jack Wade in the James Bond film &quot;GoldenEye&quot; (1995), a role he reprised in &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997).
* Charles Kay, who played Pendleton, was a well established character actor who had appeared in &quot;Fall of Eagles&quot; (1974), &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Crown&quot; (1978). He has since acted in many television productions such as &quot;Fortunes of War&quot; (1989), &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot; (1991–1993), &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot; (1997–2004) and &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; (1998 and 2006).
* &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; was an early role for Ian McNeice, who played Harcourt. He went on to act in a wide variety of film and television parts including &quot;The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain&quot; (1995), &quot;Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls&quot; (1995) and &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; (2000), as well as regular roles in &quot;Doc Martin&quot; (2004–present), &quot;Rome&quot; (2005–2007) and regular appearances as Winston Churchill in the BBC&#x27;s revived &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

Several other faces familiar to British viewers appeared during the course of the episodes, including John Woodvine (as Craven&#x27;s superior DCS Ross), Tim McInnerny (as Emma&#x27;s boyfriend Terry Shields), Hugh Fraser (as IIF chief executive Robert Bennett), Kenneth Nelson as Grogan, Zoë Wanamaker (as intelligence agent Clementine), Allan Cuthbertson (as Chilwell of the Investigation Committee) and &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; cast members David Jackson (as Colonel Lawson) and Brian Croucher (as Northmoor security chief Connors). Playing themselves were television reporters Sue Cook and Kenneth Kendall, weatherman Bill Giles and Labour MP Michael Meacher. Long-standing BBC visual effects designer Mat Irvine, who contributed visual effects to the series, received a brief cameo as a police diver in &quot;Breakthrough&quot;.

===Crew===
* Writer Troy Kennedy Martin was the creator of the long-running BBC police drama &quot;Z-Cars&quot; (1962–1978). He also wrote the screenplays for the films &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (1969) and &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (1970) and scripts for television series such as &quot;Colditz&quot; (1972–1974), &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (1975–1978) (which was created by his brother Ian Kennedy Martin) and &quot;Reilly, Ace of Spies&quot; (1983). Following &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;, he wrote the screenplays for the films &quot;Red Heat&quot; (with Walter Hill) (1988) and &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot; (1999). He died in September 2009.
* Director Martin Campbell had developed a reputation for handling action thrillers with credits including &quot;The Professionals&quot; (1977–1983), &quot;Minder&quot; (1979–1994) and &quot;Shoestring&quot; (1979–1980). A few years after &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;, Campbell moved into feature films, directing the James Bond films &quot;GoldenEye&quot; (1995) and &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006) as well as &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (1998), &quot;Vertical Limit&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Legend of Zorro&quot; (2005).
* Producer Michael Wearing had worked on &quot;Play for Today&quot; for which he had produced Alan Bleasdale&#x27;s &quot;The Black Stuff&quot; (1978) and which he and Bleasdale subsequently spun off into the highly acclaimed &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; (1982). He also produced the conspiracy thriller &quot;Bird of Prey&quot; (1982). Following &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; he continued to be one of British television&#x27;s most high profile and successful producers, appointed Head of Serials at the BBC between 1989 and 1998 where he was responsible for such programmes as &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1995), &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; (1996) and Dennis Potter&#x27;s final two plays &quot;Karaoke&quot; (1996) and &quot;Cold Lazarus&quot; (1996).
* Walt Patterson, who acted as series adviser, was a leading commentator on nuclear affairs, best known for his book &quot;Nuclear Power&quot; (Penguin, 1976–1986). Following &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;, he acted as specialist adviser to the British House of Commons Select committee on Environment for their 1986 study, &quot;Radioactive Waste&quot;. He continues to contribute to the policy debate about energy and environmental issues. Advice on the policing aspects of the serial was provided by the West Yorkshire Police and former Scotland Yard detective Jack Slipper, famous for his pursuit of the train robber Ronnie Biggs.

===Music===
The musical score was provided by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen. Clapton was approached to provide the score by producer Michael Wearing. Shortly afterwards, when Michael Kamen brought Clapton to a screening of &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985), which Kamen had scored, Clapton suggested a collaboration between the two on &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;. Kamen became one of Hollywood&#x27;s most successful film composers, writing the scores for many blockbuster films including the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; series (1987–1998) (also with Clapton), the first three &quot;Die Hard&quot; films (1988, 1990, 1995), &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; (1991) and &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000). He died in 2003.

Aside from the Clapton/Kamen soundtrack, Willie Nelson&#x27;s &quot;The Time of the Preacher&quot;, New Model Army&#x27;s &quot;Christian Militia&quot;, and Tom Waits&#x27; &quot;16 Shells From A Thirty-Ought-Six&quot; are featured in the series. &quot;Christian Militia&quot; is on the record player when Terry&#x27;s body is found. Craven listens to &quot;The Time of the Preacher&quot; when he is in Emma&#x27;s room in the first episode. It later emerges Jedburgh is familiar with the song and both he and Craven sing it on two occasions, the lyrics being significant.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation used the music to illustrate stories on the Chernobyl disaster the following year. Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen performed the movie&#x27;s main theme with the National Philharmonic Orchestra during the &quot;24 Nights&quot; period in 1990 and 1991.

==Background==
===Origins===

&quot;I am writing this story about a detective who turns into a tree&quot; was what writer Troy Kennedy Martin told his colleagues when asked what he was working on during the early 1980s. Kennedy Martin had become frustrated that &quot;at the BBC there was no political dimension to their drama whatsoever&quot; but had chosen to write a political story anyway, not really believing it would be made. The election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister and Ronald Reagan as President of the United States had brought about a major shift in the global political landscape. Kennedy Martin was motivated to write out of concern arising from such issues as the Greenham Common protests, the Falklands War, the Miners&#x27; strike and arising out of the escalation of the Cold War the fear that &quot;born-again Christians and Cold War warriors appeared to be running the United States&quot;.

By 1983, Kennedy Martin had written the first draft of what became &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; – at this stage it was called &quot;Magnox&quot; (a reference to the Magnox type of nuclear reactor) and was about trade union problems in the nuclear industry. The script was given to BBC head of drama series and serials, Jonathan Powell, who encouraged Kennedy Martin to continue its development. The script went through many changes and revisions. A particular influence was the speech made by President Ronald Reagan on 23 March 1983 announcing the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) which proposed protecting the United States from attack by nuclear missiles. One of the supporters of SDI was Lyndon LaRouche, on whom Kennedy Martin based the character of Jerry Grogan, owner of the Fusion Corporation of Kansas. Kennedy Martin was also influenced by the secrecy surrounding the UK&#x27;s policy on nuclear power in light of the inquiry into the construction of the Sizewell B nuclear power station and the concerns about the safety record of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant; this led him to conceive International Irradiated Fuels and its chief executive Robert Bennett.

The other major influence was the Gaia hypothesis, that the Earth is a single living system that self-regulates to maintain the optimum conditions for life, formulated by climate scientist James Lovelock and popularised in his 1979 book &quot;Gaia: A new look at life on Earth&quot;. Kennedy Martin used the name Gaia for the environmental organisation Emma Craven was involved in and drew the notion for the black flowers seen at the serial&#x27;s conclusion from a passage in Lovelock&#x27;s book that describes a dark marsh grass that grew on the surface of the Earth trapping heat during a time when the planet was too cold to sustain life, simulated in Lovelock&#x27;s Daisyworld model.

Although Kennedy Martin&#x27;s notion for the serial was influenced by real political events, he had for a long time railed against naturalism in television drama – most notably in a 1964 article for the theatre magazine &quot;Encore&quot;, titled &quot;Nats Go Home. First Statement of a New Drama for Television&quot;, in which he sought &quot;to free the camera from photographing dialogue, to free the structure from natural time and to exploit the total and absolute objectivity of the television camera&quot;. &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; producer Michael Wearing has noted that &quot;there is a mystical dimension to Troy&#x27;s imagination. His instincts are visual and non-naturalistic&quot;. Kennedy Martin, therefore, crafted a serial that on the one hand placed its events squarely within the real, present day world but on the other also placed itself within the realm of the mystical and the mythic. Realism and authenticity was provided by the appearances of real life television presenter Sue Cook and Labour MP Michael Meacher. There was also use of contemporary stock footage, such as Robin Day&#x27;s interview with Margaret Thatcher and references to real persons like Michael Heseltine and places such as Sellafield, alongside the references to fictitious characters and places contained in the plot. The mystical dimension is provided by Emma&#x27;s ghost while the mythic is provided by Craven himself and by Jedburgh and Grogan. Kennedy Martin, influenced by John Darragh&#x27;s &quot;The Real Camelot&quot; (Thames and Hudson, 1981) which examined the pagan origins of the Arthurian legend, saw Craven as a modern-day Green Man who would confront the threats to the Earth on behalf of Gaia. Jedburgh was conceived by Kennedy Martin as a Knight of the Marches, one of the Teutonic Knights who defended the borders of Eastern Europe, opposed to Grogan, who Kennedy Martin saw as a descendant of the Knights Templar who, according to legend, had guarded a special wisdom in the Temple of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. These aspects would reach their apotheosis in the serial&#x27;s conclusion in which Kennedy Martin envisaged that Craven, having found the plutonium stolen by Jedburgh, would be shot by a sniper and would be transformed into a tree.

===Production===
By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put the serial into production and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, &quot;Compassionate Leave&quot;, depicting Craven&#x27;s reaction to Emma&#x27;s death, describing them as &quot;the most sustained evocation of individual grief in bereavement that I can remember&quot;. The budget was set at £2 million, of which £400,000 came from an American co-producer, Lionheart Television International. Director Martin Campbell came on board shortly afterwards and soon clashed with Troy Kennedy Martin, demanding rewrites, in particular to the notion that Craven had known about Emma&#x27;s involvement with Gaia right from the start; this was removed at Campbell&#x27;s behest. Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character would turn into a tree; Peck recalled that &quot;it didn&#x27;t seem to be working in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn&#x27;t be able to make it work for the audience&quot;, a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was &quot;likely not to come off as an effect&quot;. Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements of Kennedy Martin&#x27;s original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, &quot;Burden of Proof&quot;, the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, like a tree.

Shooting on &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; began on 9 July 1984 and ran for five months until 5 December 1984. Location filming took place in London (including the Barbican Arts Centre, BBC Television Centre and the Hilton International hotel in Kensington), Yorkshire (including the headquarters of the West Yorkshire Police in Bradford, the Middleton Railway, the headquarters of Systime Computers (now the Arlington Business Centre) in Leeds where Craven hacks into the MI5 computer and at Westwood Cottage, Ilkley (for Craven&#x27;s home), Scotland (including the Gleneagles Hotel, where Jedburgh addresses the NATO conference and also where President Reagan&#x27;s Reykjavík policy was formulated) and Wales (including Clogau Gold Mine and Manod, Blaenau Ffestiniog, at Graig Ddu quarry, doubling as Northmoor with the hot cell a set constructed at a factory in Penygroes). The hospital scenes were filmed at Northwick Park Hospital accident unit.

Throughout the entire shoot, the production continued to be known as &quot;Magnox&quot;; the title &quot;Dark Forces&quot; was briefly considered before the serial was renamed &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; in April 1985. As the shoot progressed it became apparent to the cast and crew that they had a potential hit on their hands; Bob Peck recalled, &quot;I think we knew when we were making it that it was a good piece of work&quot; while Kennedy Martin told reporters &quot;I haven&#x27;t had this feeling about something for 20 years. It&#x27;s wonderful, after all this time, to get something that actually works&quot;.

==Broadcast and critical reception==
&quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; was promoted on the cover of the listings magazine &quot;Radio Times&quot; and was broadcast on Monday nights on BBC2 at 9:30pm, beginning 4 November 1985. The serial averaged an audience of 4 million viewers over its run. The critical response was generally positive with most commentators concentrating their praise on Peck&#x27;s performance as Craven and the scale of the programme&#x27;s political themes. &quot;A good television thriller is very hard to find but &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; promises to be one of the best&quot;, wrote Celia Brayfield in &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The central character is played by Bob Peck, who has the gift of looking tragic and intelligent simultaneously. [...] There was humour to lift the gloom and superb characterisation to flesh out the stock situation&quot;. Ruth Baumgarten, in &quot;The Listener&quot;, praised the serial as &quot;a grandiosely ambitious and compelling piece of fiction&quot;. Speaking on the BBC&#x27;s review programme &quot;Did You See...?&quot;, the writer Sarah Dunant said, &quot;this is a very classy piece of television drama, on all levels, I think on the plot level, I think on the level of emotion and I think stylistically [...] it looks absolutely wonderful, it&#x27;s shot like a feature film&quot;. Not so impressed was Byron Rogers, television critic of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, who initially hailed the series as one that &quot;stayed in the mind and will stay there long [...] because of its portrayal of human grief&quot; but later felt he was &quot;beginning to find &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; slightly irritating&quot; and decried the final episode as &quot;an insult to its considerable following&quot;.

Aware of the critical buzz surrounding the show, BBC1 Controller, Michael Grade, quickly announced that the series would be repeated on BBC1, stating, &quot;I think it will reach a wider audience and it deserves it&quot;, and so &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; was duly shown, in double episodes, over three consecutive nights between 19 December and 21 December 1985, the fastest time between original broadcast and repeat in the BBC&#x27;s history. These repeats were accompanied by a disclaimer that the Gaia organisation depicted in the programme was not connected with the Gaia publishing company supported by Prince Philip. It was a move that paid off – &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; doubled its audience on BBC1 to 8 million viewers.

==Cultural significance==
&quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; tapped into a cultural zeitgeist of concern about nuclear power and nuclear warfare in the early to mid 1980s. In 1980, current affairs programme &quot;Panorama&quot; broadcast &quot;If The Bomb Drops&quot;, a documentary that examined how well prepared Britain was for a nuclear attack; in 1983, &quot;The Day After&quot; (an American TV movie about a nuclear war) aired, as well as seeing the release of the feature film &quot;WarGames&quot;, showing the &#x27;no winner&#x27; outcome of nuclear war; in 1984, the BBC broadcast &quot;On the Eighth Day&quot;, a documentary about the effects of a nuclear winter and &quot;Threads&quot;, a drama about a nuclear attack on Sheffield while 1985 saw the first screening of Peter Watkins&#x27; nuclear war television film &quot;The War Game&quot;, banned on television since 1965. &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; also rode on a wave of preoccupation with the secretive nature of the State in both fact (e.g. &quot;This Week&quot;&#x27;s “Death on the Rock” (1988) about the killing of three Provisional IRA members in Gibraltar and &quot;Secret Society&quot; (1987) about undisclosed matters of public interest which led to the sacking of BBC Director-General Alasdair Milne) and fiction (e.g. the films &quot;Defence of the Realm&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Whistle Blower&quot; (1987) and the television serials &quot;A Very British Coup&quot; (1988) and &quot;Traffik&quot; (1989)).

&quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; continues to be well regarded to this day. When it was repeated on BBC2 in 1992, Sean Day-Lewis wrote in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;&quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; is a masterpiece. It is one of those very rare television creations so rich in form and content that the spectator wishes there was some way of prolonging it indefinitely&quot;. Andrew Lavender, writing in &quot;British Television Drama in the 1980s&quot;, has said that &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; &quot;captured the spirit of its age but went far beyond the drama of its time. [...] It pushed against expectations attaching to the thriller form, often transcending the limits of the genre&quot;. Fred Inglis, in his analysis of the serial in &quot;Formations: 20th Century Media Studies&quot;, takes it &quot;as one of the most remarkable works of art made for British television&quot;. According to Lez Cooke, in &quot;British Television Drama: A History&quot;, &quot;In a reactionary climate, when the possibilities for the production of &#x27;social issue&#x27; drama were limited, &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; proved that, by adapting to changed circumstances and adopting a serialised thriller format, it was still possible to produce ambitious and progressive television drama in Britain in the mid-1980s&quot;, a view echoed by Sean Cubit in &quot;EcoMedia&quot; who notes that &quot;the series neatly echoed the chill that descended on radical politics in the Thatcher years in the United Kingdom&quot;. The television historian Andrew Pixley has described the series as &quot;possibly the finest BBC drama ever made&quot; and &quot;one of the few television programmes where every element can be said to have worked to complete effect&quot;; John Hartley, in &quot;Tele-ology: Studies in Television&quot;, called it &quot;the best police drama series ever made for television&quot; and said that &quot;its method of investigative drama can unravel some of the complexities of public life more truthfully than investigative journalism&quot;.

&quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; was placed 15th (fourth position out of the dramas featured on the list) on the British Film Institute&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes in 2000, the BFI describing it as &quot;a gripping, innovative six-part drama which fully deserves its cult status and many awards&quot;. &quot;Radio Times&quot; television editor Alison Graham, in 2003, listed it as one of the 40 greatest television programmes ever made. It was one of only seven dramas listed in &quot;Broadcast&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 50 most influential television programmes, published in July 2004. In March 2007, &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; was placed third in Channel 4&#x27;s list of the Greatest TV Dramas. Also on Channel 4, Darius Jedburgh was listed 84th in its list of the One Hundred Greatest TV Characters in 2001.

It is located 60 km from the province centre of Smolyan. The Greek border is 5 km from the town. The cross-border Zlatograd - Thermes (Greece) road was inaugurated on 15 January 2010.

==History==
During the rule of the Ottoman Empire, the area was a township of the Ottoman Sanjak of Gümülcine in Adrianople Vilayet between 1867 and 1912 known as Darıdere. The town still retains its characteristic Ottoman-era architecture, with numerous old buildings as well as two 19th-century Orthodox churches and a mosque.

==Geography==
Zlatograd is located in a valley between the eastern and central massif of the Rhodope mountains.

The municipality&#x27;s climate is included in the transient-Mediterranean climate region.
Mineral resources include lead-zinc ore.

The territory of the municipality is crossed by Varbitza river which is 98.1 km long and its catchment basin is 1202.8 km. Nedelinska and Kushlenska rivers are tributaries of Varbitza. There is a dam lake named &quot;Zlatograd&quot; with water capacity of 4,4.106 m . and a micro dam lake called &quot;Hasidere&quot; (0,4.106 m).

Forest covers an area of 144.60 km2. Species including beech, hornbeam, oak, birch and cornel-tree are mostly spread among the broad-leaved forests. Prevailing coniferous trees are spruce, fir-tree, white and black pine.

Agriculture covers 25 km2 and the arable land is 12 km2. The cultures grown in the municipality are tobacco, potatoes, vegetables and strawberries (representatives of perennial plants).

There is a tailings pond called &quot;Erma Reka&quot; which is 8 km away from the town of Zlatograd and 5 km away from the village of Erma Reka. The municipality is rich in underground resources. In the surroundings of Erma Reka there is a geothermal deposit of hot mineral water.

<text>The Freedom Party (, PvdV) was a short-lived conservative liberal political party in the Netherlands active from 1946 to 1948. The PvdV was the successor of the Liberal State Party and a predecessor of the modern-day People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD).

==Party history==
The PvdV was founded on 23 March 1946 by a group around the young liberal Korthals and the director of Heineken. After the foundation they were joined by the rest of the top of the pre-war Liberal State Party. The party was supposed to be less conservative and more modern that its predecessor. In 1948 it merged with social liberal dissidents from the Labour Party, led by Pieter Oud, to become the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). In the 1946 elections it received six seats and it was confined to a minor position in opposition.

==Ideology and issues==
The PvdV was classical liberal party with progressive leanings, committed to individual freedom and free market economics.

==Representation==
This table shows the PvdV&#x27;s results in elections to the House of Representatives, Senate and States-Provincial, as well as the party&#x27;s political leadership: the &quot;fractievoorzitter&quot;, is the chair of the parliamentary party and the lead candidate is the party&#x27;s top candidate in the general election, these posts are normally taken by the party&#x27;s leader.

==Electorate==
The PvdV mainly received support from atheists or latitudinarian Protestants from higher classes: businessmen, civil servants, wealthy farmers, and voters with free professions (such as lawyers and doctors). The party performed particularly well in the major trading cities Amsterdam and Rotterdam, the rich municipalities around Hilversum and The Hague and in northern rural provinces, like Groningen and Drenthe.

==Pillarisation==
The PvdV lacked a real system of pillarized organisations around it. &#x27;Neutral&#x27; organisations, which were not linked to a pillar, often had friendly relations with the PvdV. This included the general broadcasting association AVRO (&quot;Algemene Verenigde Radio Omroep&quot;, General United Radio Broadcasting Organisation), the general union ANWV (&quot;Algemene Nederlandse Werkelieden Vereniging&quot;, the General Dutch Workers&#x27; Association), furthermore the neutral employers&#x27; organisation VNO and the financial paper &quot;Het Handelsblad&quot; had good relations with the party.

<text>Kay Cottee (née McLaren, born 25 January 1954) is an Australian sailor, who was the first woman to perform a single-handed, non-stop and unassisted circumnavigation of the world. She performed this feat in 1988 in her yacht Blackmores First Lady, taking 189 days.

==Personal life==
Born Kay McLaren, the youngest of four daughters, in Sydney on 25 January 1954, Cottee grew up in the southern Sydney suburb of Sans Souci. She was born into a yachting family and was taken sailing for the first time when only a few weeks old. For secondary schooling, she attended Moorefield Girls High School in Kogarah, New South Wales.

Over the next nine years Cottee moved to Pittwater where she built a yacht and established a bareboat charter business.

Cottee now lives in Yamba on the far NSW north coast with television producer husband Peter Sutton. She is an international motivational speaker, boat builder, writer, painter and sculptor.

==Solo circumnavigation==

On 5 June 1988 at age 34, Cottee became the first woman to sail round the world alone non-stop and unassisted when she sailed through the heads of Sydney harbour. She was greeted by tens of thousands of well-wishers. Cottee had left the harbour 189 days earlier, on 29 November 1987.

The historic voyage on her 37 ft yacht &quot;Blackmores First Lady&quot; was also the fastest sailing trip around the world by a woman and the first solo, non-stop and unassisted voyage around the world by a woman.

In the Southern Ocean, Cottee&#x27;s boat was knocked down continuously and she was washed overboard. When Cottee rounded Cape Horn, the southernmost tip of South America, she celebrated with a lunch of crab, mayonnaise and self baked bread, and a bottle of Grange, a prestigious Australian wine.

Cottee and her major sponsor Blackmores Limited used the voyage to raise over $1M for the Rev. Ted Noffs&#x27; Life Education Program. Cottee also undertook an 18-month national schools tour, speaking to over 40,000 senior high school students, imparting the message you can achieve your dreams if you work steadily towards them.

== Yacht building ==
In 2002 Cottee designed and built the first Kay Cottee 56, a fibreglass/foam sandwich construction yacht designed as a bluewater cruiser. With husband Peter Sutton, Cottee set up a boat building business near Yamba on the north coast of NSW in order to produce the yachts, each one which would take an anticipated 8 months to build.

==Awards==
Since her round the world trip, Kay Cottee has received numerous accolades.
* In 1988, Cottee received the Australian of the Year Award. 
* In January 1989, Cottee was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia.
* Cottee is also the first Australian recipient of the Cutty Sark Medal presented by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.
* Cottee was also made a Paul Harris Fellow by Rotary and an International Honorary Zontion by Zonta International
*Inaugural inductee of the Australian Sailing Hall of Fame in 2017

== Other achievements ==

===Australian National Maritime Museum ===
In 1991, Cottee joined the advisory board of the Australian National Maritime Museum. She was chair of the museum from 1995 until 2001. In 2000, &quot;Blackmores First Lady&quot;, was acquired by the museum and placed on permanent display.

===Publications===
Cottee is the author of two books. Her first book, &quot;First Lady&quot;, was published by Macmillan in 1989. Her second book, &quot;All at Sea on Land&quot;, was published by Pan Macmillan in 1998, about her life in the ten years since the voyage.

<doc id="863049" wikidata="Q977068" url="?curid=863049" title="Widecombe in the Moor">
<text>Widecombe in the Moor () is a village and large civil parish in Dartmoor National Park in Devon, England. Its church is known as the Cathedral of the Moors on account of its tall tower and its size, relative to the small population it serves. It is a favourite tourist centre, partly for its scenic character and partly for its connection to the popular song &quot;Widecombe Fair&quot;.

==History==
The name is thought to derive from &#x27;Withy-combe&#x27; which means Willow Valley. According to Widecombe&#x27;s official website, there are 196 households in the village, although its large and sprawling parish stretches for many miles and encompasses dozens of isolated cottages and moorland farms. The parish is surrounded, clockwise from the north, by the parishes of Manaton, Ilsington, Ashburton, Buckland-in-the-Moor, Holne and Dartmoor Forest.

Tourism is a major source of income for Widecombe today, and within a small area of the village there are several gift shops, one cafe and two pubs (the Old Inn and the Rugglestone Inn).

The village is known for Widecombe Fair, held annually and celebrated by a folksong of the same name, featuring &quot;Old Uncle Tom Cobley and All&quot;. Its words were first published in 1880, and the characters from the song are featured in many of the souvenirs on sale in the local shops. Also popular are the traditional Toby Jugs; a type of mug, with a handle, shaped as a three-dimensional caricature of a person&#x27;s head, sometimes fictional, sometimes a celebrity.

==The church==

The church of St Pancras is known as the &quot;Cathedral of the Moors&quot; in recognition of its 120-foot tower and relatively large capacity for such a small village. Originally built in the fourteenth century, in the Perpendicular style (late Gothic), using locally quarried granite, it was enlarged over the following two centuries, partly on the proceeds of the local tin mining trade. Inside, the ceiling is decorated with a large number of decorative roof bosses, including the tinner’s emblem of a circle of three hares (known locally as the Tinners&#x27; Rabbits).
It was badly damaged in the Great Thunderstorm of 1638, apparently struck by ball lightning during an afternoon service. The building was packed with about 300 worshippers, four of whom were killed and around 60 injured. Local legend relates that the disaster was caused by a visit from the Devil.

==Education==
The Karuna Institute, a collaboration partner of Middlesex University is located here.

Widecombe Primary School is a primary school that educates around 70 pupils.

==Other features==

In Widecombe churchyard is the grave of novelist Beatrice Chase who lived for much of her life in a cottage close to the village.

Next to the church stands the Church House, built in 1537. It is thought to have originally been built as a brewery for the production of church ales, became adapted as an almshouse, and later became the village school. Today, it is used as a meeting place for local people. Sexton&#x27;s Cottage forms the western end of the building and is now a National Trust shop and Dartmoor National Park information point. It is now managed by the National Trust. Standing in front of the building is a 15-inch naval shell, which was donated to the village after the First World War to thank the villagers for supplying troops with sphagnum moss. This grows in abundance in the damp Dartmoor conditions, and is said to have healing properties. It was used as an emergency field dressing for injured troops.

The size of the parish meant that, for centuries, families were obliged to walk for miles to attend the church every Sunday. The task was even more challenging when it came to burying their dead, whose coffins had to be carried over rough ground and both up and down exceptionally steep hills. Halfway up Dartmeet Hill, for example, lies the Coffin Stone, close to the road, where the body would be placed to allow the bearers to take a rest. The rock is split in two, along its length. Local legend has it that the body of a particularly wicked man was laid there. God took exception to this, and struck the stone with a thunderbolt, destroying the coffin and splitting the stone in two.

The deserted medieval village of Hutholes and the abandoned farmstead Dinna Clerks (also spelt Dinah Clark&#x27;s) are nearby. The Rippon Tor Rifle Range lies within five miles of the village.

==In popular culture==
In the reality show &quot;Celebrity Ghost Stories&quot;, American actor Daniel Stern claimed to have had an unsettling, and possibly supernatural, experience while on a brief visit to the village during his honeymoon in 1980. He also recounted that people in the region considered Widecombe to be haunted, and that the Great Thunderstorm of 1638 was blamed. The official Widecombe-in-the-Moor website responded to the claims and dismissed the alleged hauntings as a legend borne of superstitions.

In 2010, Widecombe-in-the-Moor was one of the filming locations for the Steven Spielberg film &quot;War Horse&quot;.

<doc id="863060" wikidata="Q7572208" url="?curid=863060" title="SpaceShipOne flight 17P">
<text>Flight 17P of SpaceShipOne was a spaceflight in the Tier One program that took place on October 4, 2004. It was the second competitive flight in the Ansari X Prize competition to demonstrate a non-governmental reusable crewed spacecraft, and is hence also referred to as the X2 flight. It was a successful flight, winning the X PRIZE.

==Crew==
==Scheduling==
To win the X PRIZE, a spacecraft needed to make two successful competitive flights within 14 days. SpaceShipOne made a successful competitive flight on September 29, 2004, and so needed to make a second by October 13, 2004, in order to win. Scaled Composites aimed to be able to fly three times within the two weeks in order to allow for a failed flight.

The date of the flight, October 4, 2004, was the 47th anniversary of the launch of Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth and the same day astronaut Gordon Cooper died. SpaceShipOne&#x27;s first powered flight was, in a similar vein, on the 100th anniversary of the first ever powered flight by the Wright Brothers.

The da Vinci Project, another X PRIZE contender, planned to make its first competitive flight on October 2, 2004, which might have caused a race to develop, affecting the scheduling. However, they encountered problems and had to delay their flights. Tier One was therefore able to follow their original flight schedule. Scaled Composites reported that they could have turned the spacecraft around faster than the five days they actually allowed for it.

It was anticipated by observers that Mike Melvill, the pilot on both previous spaceflights by SpaceShipOne, would pilot this flight also. This expectation was not supported by any real evidence, but was based on Melvill&#x27;s prior experience. On the morning of the flight it was announced that Brian Binnie would be the pilot.

==Manifest==

Under Ansari X PRIZE rules, the flight was required to carry 180 kg payload, to simulate two 90 kg human passengers. Whereas Scaled Composites stated that the first competitive flight would not carry passengers, it did not make any such statement about later competitive flights. It seemed possible that Burt Rutan would be a passenger on flight 17P, but in the end he was not, since the FAA had restricted the flight to just the pilot and no passengers. The payload included:
*X PRIZE flight monitoring equipment, known as the &quot;gold box&quot;
*the Explorers Club flag, by arrangement between the Explorers Club and the X PRIZE Foundation

The same logos were carried as on flight 16P:
*Scaled Composites
*&quot;SpaceShipOne: a Paul G. Allen project&quot; on SpaceShipOne
*&quot;White Knight&quot; on White Knight
*Virgin Galactic, on the tails
*Virgin, on the fuselage
*Ansari X PRIZE, as required by X PRIZE rules
*The Spirit of St. Louis, a science center
*M&amp;M&#x27;s
*7-Up Plus
*Champ Car World Series

&quot;All times are in PDT, which is seven hours behind UTC. This was the local civil time at the spaceport on the day of the flight.&quot;

The SpaceShipOne pilot was Brian Binnie. White Knight was piloted by Mike Melvill.

Taxiing, scheduled for 06:30, began at 06:36. Takeoff from Mojave Spaceport, scheduled for 07:00, took place at 06:49. White Knight then carried SpaceShipOne to the launch altitude, in excess of 43,500 feet (13.3 km). SpaceShipOne separated from White Knight at 07:49, and promptly ignited its rocket.

The rocket motor was capable of burning for approximately 87 s. The burn-out altitude was in excess of 200,000 feet (61 km). After burn-out the craft continued to coast upwards. The wing was feathered, into high-drag configuration, during the coasting phase. The spacecraft coasted to apogee at an altitude of , well in excess of the X PRIZE target altitude. It also broke the record altitude of 354,200 feet (107.96 km) for a rocket plane, set by the X-15 in 1963.

After apogee, SpaceShipOne reentered the atmosphere in its feathered configuration, and then changed to gliding configuration at 07:57. SpaceShipOne then glided back to the spaceport, deployed landing gear at 4,200 feet (1.28 km), and landed safely at 08:13. White Knight then landed at 08:19.

==Spectacle==

As with SpaceShipOne&#x27;s previous spaceflights, a large crowd watched from Mojave Spaceport. There was also live television coverage, and various websites provided coverage in their medium of preference.

Distinguished attendees included:
*Richard Branson, of Virgin Galactic
*Paul Allen, of Mojave Aerospace Ventures
*Rick Searfoss, chief X PRIZE judge
*Jerry Pournelle, science fiction author

==X PRIZE==

The Ansari X PRIZE requires that two spaceflights be made by the same spacecraft within two weeks. SpaceShipOne successfully made its first competitive flight (flight 16P) on September 29, 2004. This second successful competitive flight therefore won the X PRIZE. This was declared by Rick Searfoss, the chief X PRIZE judge, at a post-flight press briefing. The prize was awarded on November 6, 2004.

==Retirement==
On July 25, 2005, SpaceShipOne was taken to the Oshkosh Airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. After the airshow, Mike Melvill and crew flew the White Knight, carrying SpaceShipOne, to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, where Melvill spoke to a group of about 300 military and civilian personnel. Later in the evening, Melvill gave a presentation at the Dayton Engineers Club, entitled &quot;Some Experiments in Space Flight,&quot; in honor of Wilbur Wright&#x27;s now-famous presentation to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1901 entitled &quot;Some Experiments in Flight.&quot; The White Knight then transported SpaceShipOne to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum to be put on display. It was unveiled on Wednesday October 5, 2005 in the Milestones of Flight gallery and is now on display to the public in the main atrium with the Spirit of St. Louis, the Bell X-1, the Wright Flyer, and the Apollo 11 command module &quot;Columbia&quot;.

Commander Brian Binnie donated the flight suit worn during his Ansari X Prize-winning flight to an auction benefiting Seattle&#x27;s Museum of Flight. Entertainer and charity auctioneer Fred Northup, Jr. purchased the flight suit, and it is on loan and displayed at the museum&#x27;s new Charles Simonyi Space Gallery.

<text>Michael Wearing (12 March 1939 – 5 May 2017) was a British television producer, who spent much of his career working on drama productions for the BBC. He is best known as the producer of the well received serials &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; (1982) and &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; (1985), which created for him a reputation as one of British television&#x27;s foremost drama producers.

His initial career was in the theatre, where he worked as a director, before in 1976 he joined the BBC&#x27;s English Regions Drama Department as a Script Editor under producer David Rose. The department, based at the Pebble Mill Studios in Birmingham, had been set up as an attempt to counter the BBC&#x27;s tradition of producing dramas that were almost exclusively made and set in London and the home counties, and was charged with making regional drama based in all areas of the country.

Over the following five years, Wearing worked as both a script editor and producer on various series and plays for the department, with his most successful production there being the &quot;Play for Today&quot; entry &quot;The Black Stuff&quot;. Written by Alan Bleasdale, despite languishing on the shelf for two years waiting for a broadcast slot before being shown in 1980, the play was a great success and led to Bleasdale writing and Wearing producing &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; (1982), a sequel series showing what happened to the characters involved after the events of the play. This was highly acclaimed and award-winning, and led to Wearing being called down to work at the central BBC drama department in London.

The first project he was given there by Head of Series &amp; Serials Jonathan Powell was a Troy Kennedy Martin project entitled &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;. Eventually screened in 1985, &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; was another award-winner, and cemented Wearing&#x27;s reputation.

In 1989, he was made Head of Serials at the BBC, the Series and Serials departments now having been separated as they had originally been. In 1993, after Head of Series Peter Cregeen&#x27;s departure from the Corporation, Wearing was briefly Head of Series &amp; Serials, before his role was reduced to simply overseeing Serials again the following year.

In his time as Head of Serials he oversaw the production of a great number of productions, among the most famous being the new era of costume drama literary adaptations such as &quot;Middlemarch&quot; (1993) and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1995). However, perhaps his most lasting legacy was the BBC Two serial &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; (1996). Written by playwright Peter Flannery, &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; was a production Wearing had wanted to bring to the screens since the early 1980s, but due to various difficulties with budgets, potential libel and BBC executives, he had never been able to. Now, with a bulletproof reputation and as Head of Serials the ability to commission the production himself, he was finally able to persuade channel controller Michael Jackson to accept the serial, which was a resounding hit.

In 1997, Wearing was given the honorary Alan Clarke Award for outstanding creative achievement in television at the British Academy Television Awards. In 1998 he left the staff of the BBC, although he worked for them subsequently as a freelance producer.

<text>SS &quot;Torrey Canyon&quot; was an LR2 Suezmax class oil tanker with a cargo capacity of of crude oil. She ran aground off the western coast of Cornwall, United Kingdom, on 18 March 1967, causing an environmental disaster. At that time she was the largest vessel ever to be wrecked.

==Design and history==
When built by Newport News Shipbuilding in the United States in 1959, she had a deadweight tonnage capacity of . However, the ship was later enlarged by Sasebo Heavy Industries in Japan to capacity.

At the time of the shipwreck she was owned by Barracuda Tanker Corporation, a subsidiary of the Union Oil Company of California, and registered in Liberia but chartered to BP. She was long, beam and had of draught..

==Accident and oil spill==

On 19 February 1967, &quot;Torrey Canyon&quot; left the Kuwait National Petroleum Company refinery, at Mina, Kuwait (later Al Ahmadi) on her final voyage with a full cargo of crude oil. The ship reached the Canary Islands on 14 March. From there the planned route was to Milford Haven in Wales.

&quot;Torrey Canyon&quot; struck Pollard&#x27;s Rock on Seven Stones reef, between the Cornish mainland and the Isles of Scilly, on 18 March. She became grounded and, several days later, began to break up.

In an effort to reduce the size of the oil spill, the British government decided to set the wreck on fire, by means of air strikes from the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) and Royal Air Force (RAF). On 28 March 1967, FAA Blackburn Buccaneers from RNAS Lossiemouth dropped 1,000-pound bombs on the ship. Afterwards RAF Hawker Hunter from RAF Chivenor dropped cans of jet fuel (kerosene), to fuel the blaze. However, the fire was put out by high tides, and further strikes were needed to re-ignite the oil, by FAA de Havilland Sea Vixens from RNAS Yeovilton and Buccaneers from the RNAS Brawdy, as well as Hunters of No 1(F) Squadron RAF from RAF West Raynham with napalm. Bombing continued into the next day, until &quot;Torrey Canyon&quot; finally sank. A total of 161 bombs, 16 rockets, of napalm and of kerosene were used.

Attempts to contain the oil using foam-filled containment booms were largely unsuccessful, due to the booms&#x27; fragility in high seas. Soldiers from 9 Independent Parachute Squadron RE were tasked to clear several Cornish beaches affected by the spill.

===Guernsey===
When the oil reached Guernsey seven days after the grounding, authorities scooped up the oil into sewage tankers and siphoned it off into a disused quarry in the northeast of the island. Some time later, micro-organisms were introduced to see if they could break the oil down into carbon dioxide and water. This was a limited success, so in 2010, a bio-remediation process was initiated to speed up the process.

==Aftermath==
An inquiry in Liberia, where the ship was registered, found Shipmaster Pastrengo Rugiati was to blame, because he took a shortcut to save time to get to Milford Haven. Additionally a design fault meant that the helmsman was unaware that the steering selector switch had been accidentally left on autopilot and hence was unable to carry out a timely turn to go through the shipping channel.

The wreck lies at a depth of .

==In popular culture==
* Serge Gainsbourg composed and recorded the song &quot;Torrey Canyon&quot; about the incident.
* The UK series &quot;Heartbeat&quot; ran an episode entitled &quot;The Holiday&#x27;s Over&quot; in which one of the characters, Vernon Scripps, lost his fortune by becoming a &quot;name&quot; (underwriter) for the &quot;Torrey Canyon&quot;.

<text>Crumb is a 1994 American documentary film about the noted underground cartoonist R. Crumb and his family (including his two brothers) and his outlook on life. Directed by Terry Zwigoff and produced by Lynn O&#x27;Donnell, it won widespread acclaim. It was released on the film festival circuit in September 1994 before being released theatrically in the United States on April 28, 1995, having been screened at film festivals (and winning the Documentary Prize at Sundance) that year. Jeffery M. Anderson (later critic for the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;) placed the film on his list of the ten greatest films of all time, labeling it &quot;the greatest documentary ever made.&quot; The Criterion Collection released the film on DVD and Blu-ray on August 10, 2010.

==Synopsis==
Robert Crumb, a pioneer in the underground comix movement of the 1960s, collects 78-rpm blues records from the 1920s and &#x27;30s and is moving soon with his wife (fellow comics artist Aline Kominsky-Crumb) and daughter (Sophie) to a house in southern France that he is trading for some of his sketchbooks. He begins a speech at an art school by mentioning the three things he is probably best known for (those being the &quot;Keep on Truckin&#x27;&quot; strip from 1968, the &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; (1968) album cover, and Fritz the Cat), before spending much of the rest of the film detailing his distaste for modern American consumerist culture and his darkly cynical perspective on life. He is seen sketching his surroundings at cafés and on sidewalks, attending an exhibition of his work, and interacting with friends and family.

Viewers learn about Robert&#x27;s career through interviews with his contemporaries Don Donahue, Spain Rodriguez, Bill Griffith, and Trina Robbins, as well as critics Robert Hughes and Deirdre English, who also discuss the controversy surrounding many of Robert&#x27;s depictions of women and African-Americans. Robert&#x27;s ex-wife Dana and ex-girlfriends Kathy Goodell and Dian Hanson provide additional insights into his personality. Much information about Robert&#x27;s childhood is derived from scenes of him in conversation with his mother Beatrice, older brother Charles, and younger brother Maxon. Robert&#x27;s two sisters declined to be interviewed for the film, and one of them reportedly responded on both sisters&#x27; behalf to Crumb and Zwigoff&#x27;s offer to appear by demanding Robert pay her thousands of dollars of &quot;reparations&quot; for his &quot;crimes against women&quot;, which Crumb bluntly refused to consider and led to him withdrawing the offer to appear in the film at all. Charles, whom Robert acknowledges as his main artistic influence, no longer draws, has never lived on his own, and takes prescription psychiatric medications to help stabilize his mental state (he committed suicide before the film was released). Maxon, who has a seizure disorder he says is triggered by feelings of sexual arousal, lives an ascetic life in a dilapidated hotel, meditating, begging on the street, and occasionally drawing or painting. All three brothers mention the authoritarian behavior of their father and talk about the comic books Charles made them make when they were children.

Robert is shown drawing with Sophie and Jesse, his son with Dana, with whom Robert has become reacquainted after abandoning his family to move to San Francisco when the boy was young. He invites Jesse to visit him in France, but his main concern regarding the move is about how his records will fare. After the moving men cart off his collection, Robert is distracted from his worries just long enough to take a phone call and reject an offer to make an animated film based on his character Mr. Natural.

==Production==
Robert Crumb initially did not want to make the film, but eventually agreed. There was a rumor, accidentally created by Roger Ebert, that Terry Zwigoff, who was friends with Crumb, made Crumb cooperate by threatening to shoot himself. Ebert later clarified this in an audio commentary he did with Zwigoff in 2006 and a review he wrote in 2005, where he said: &quot;That never happened, but it may be true that Zwigoff’s life was saved because he did make the film.&quot;

During the nine years it took to make the documentary, Zwigoff said he was &quot;averaging an income of about $200 a month and living with back pain so intense that I spent three years with a loaded gun on the pillow next to my bed, trying to get up the nerve to kill myself.&quot; He felt the involvement of Maxon and, particularly, Charles was central to the film, which led him to choose &quot;Crumb&quot; as the title.

The film is &quot;presented&quot; by David Lynch, though he had no actual involvement in its making. In the commentary Zwigoff did with Ebert, he says that Lynch did not respond to a request for funds until after the film was already finished, but they agreed to include Lynch&#x27;s name in the advertising and credits to attract more viewers.

==Reception==
&quot;Crumb&quot; was met with wide acclaim from critics, earning a 95% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 43 reviews, with an average score of 8.4/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Crumb&quot; is a frank and surreal chronicle of artistic expression and family trauma, offering an unblinking gaze into the mind and work of cartoonist Robert Crumb that will endear as much as it unsettles.&quot; Gene Siskel rated it as the best film of the year. Roger Ebert gave it four stars (out of four), writing: &quot;&quot;Crumb&quot; is a film that gives new meaning to the notion of art as therapy.&quot; Critic Jeffrey M. Anderson gave it four stars (out of four), calling it &quot;one of the bravest and most honest films I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;, and listing its characteristics as those of &quot;a great documentary&quot;. In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe&#x27;s review was similarly positive. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; rated the film as &quot;wild applause&quot;, with critic Edward Guthmann calling it &quot;one of the most provocative, haunting documentaries of the last decade.&quot; He also noted that Robert Crumb and wife Aline had drawn a &quot;scornful&quot; cartoon about the film in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Despite such strong reviews, &quot;Crumb&quot; was not nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature (the nominating committee reportedly stopped watching the film after only twenty minutes). The Oscar snub of &quot;Crumb&quot;, following the snubbing of the equally acclaimed &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; the previous year, caused a media furor that caused the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to revamp its documentary nomination process. Zwigoff stated in an interview that &quot;the Academy Awards thing had much more to do with the fact that at the time, a lot of the documentary membership was made up of distributors of documentary films. The rules have changed since then. But they would just vote for the films they distributed because it was in their financial interest to do so. I came to learn that later. At the time, I just assumed they were disgusted with the film.&quot;

In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;Crumb&quot; the 14th best film of the last 25 years. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked the film #74 on its list of the 100 Best Films of the 1990s, calling it &quot;Arguably the greatest of all nonfiction films.&quot;

Although Zwigoff only filmed Robert Crumb&#x27;s brothers with their consent, some have questioned whether they were able to provide that consent in a meaningful way.

<doc id="863088" wikidata="Q5120369" url="?curid=863088" title="Yokoshiba, Chiba">
<text>was a town located in Sanbu District, Chiba Prefecture, Japan.

Asahi Village was established on April 1, 1889, within Musha District. It changed its name to Yokoshiba on December 28, 1892. Musha District became part of Sanbu District from April 1, 1897. On May 10, 1897, Yokoshiba was elevated to town status. It expanded through the annexation of the neighboring villages of Ōfusa and Kamisakae on July 1, 1955.

On March 27, 2006, Yokoshiba, along with the town of Hikari (from Sōsa District), was merged to create the town of Yokoshibahikari, and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality. Sōsa District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

As of November 1, 2005, (the last census data prior to the merger) the town had an estimated population of 14,589 and a population density of 434 persons per km2. The total area was 33.60 km2.

<doc id="863089" wikidata="Q180131" url="?curid=863089" title="Gabrovo">
<text>Gabrovo ( ) is a city in central northern Bulgaria, the administrative centre of Gabrovo Province.It is situated at the foot of the central Balkan Mountains, in the valley of the Yantra River, and is known as an international capital of humour and satire (see Gabrovo humour), as well as noted for its Bulgarian National Revival architecture. Gabrovo is also known as the longest town in Bulgaria, stretching over 25 km along the Yantra, yet reaching only in width at places. The geographic center of Bulgaria - Uzana - is located near the town.

==Name==
According to the most widespread legend, Gabrovo was founded by a blacksmith named Racho, close to whose fireplace a hornbeam rose, so the settlement acquired its name, from the Slavic word &quot;gabar&quot; (&quot;hornbeam&quot;) + the Slavic suffix &quot;-ovo&quot;.

==History==
The area around Gabrovo, inhabited since the Neolithic, gained economic importance after Veliko Tarnovo became capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire in the 12th century. Craftsmanship and trade prospered due to the proximity to both the capital and the Balkan passes. Medieval Gabrovo was a small pass village of about 100 houses.

After the Ottoman invasion of the Balkans in the 14th century, the demographic position of Gabrovo changed significantly, as it was the only settlement in a considerably large geographic area and an attractive place for Bulgarians fleeing from the conquered capital and neighbouring fortresses. It turned from a village into a small town (&quot;palanka&quot;) and began to develop as an economic, cultural and spiritual centre.

During Ottoman rule, the rich tradesmen spent plenty of resources for the small town&#x27;s public planning. The first Bulgarian secular school, the Aprilov National High School, was founded in Gabrovo in 1835 with the aid of Vasil Aprilov and Nikolay Palauzov. Gabrovo was officially proclaimed a town by the Ottoman authority in May 1860. In the 1870s Felix Kanitz said that Gabrovo is &quot;a big workshop&quot; and that it is a &quot;city that lives from the water,&quot; referring to widely used water power. The glory of the goods of Gabrovo became known throughout the Ottoman Empire, and beyond that, in Bucharest even nowadays there is a street named &quot;Gabroveni&quot;.

Shortly before and after the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, Gabrovo developed as a centre of industry on the basis of its economic traditions. Joint-stock companies emerged, factories were constructed and connections to the large stock exchanges were created, prompting some to label the town &quot;The Bulgarian Manchester&quot;.

==Population==
Gabrovo saw its most rapid growth in the post-World War II years, when its population was doubled. Following general population trends in Bulgaria, the number of citizens started declining after the fall of Communism in the country. People started emigrating abroad or to the capital of Sofia. Currently, Gabrovo is more than 30,000 people short of its peak, achieved in the period 1985-1991 when the number of the residents exceeded 80,000. According to Census 2011, , the population of the town was 58,950 inhabitants.

===Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition===
According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:
*Bulgarians: 54,227 (97.9%)
*Turks: 473 (0.9%)
*Roma: 343 (0.6%)
*Others: 193 (0.3%)
*Indefinable: 151 (0.3%)
**Undeclared: 3,563 (6.0%)
Total: 58,950

The ethnic composition of Gabrovo Municipality is 60,207 Bulgarians, 504 Turks and 367 Roma among others.

==Culture==
Internationally known as a centre of humour and satire, Gabrovo has two theatres, the Racho Stoyanov Drama Theatre and the puppet theatre, a House of Humour and Satire that serves as a cultural institute, a centre, museum and gallery to popularise comic art. There is a cinema, Aleko Cinema, and museums and memorial houses in the town and around it, most notably the Etar Architectural-Ethnographic Complex and the National Museum of Education at the Aprilov National High School.

On a Saturday around the week of May 21, Gabrovo hosts an annual Carnival of Humor and Satire with the slogan in Bulgarian “Da izkukurigame ot smyah” (translating to &quot;Let`s go nuts from laughter&quot;). On the day of the carnival, the streets of Gabrovo town are overflowing with fun characters like masked musketeers, bullfighters, shamans, gypsies, and much more. The carnival is also popular for its use of traditional Balkan songs, folklore choreography, and a rich display of Gabrovo humour and culture.

A planetarium is in operation.

<text>Levon Hakobi Ter-Petrosyan (; born 9 January 1946), also known by his initials LTP, is an Armenian politician and historian who served as the first president of Armenia from 1991 until his resignation in 1998.

A senior researcher at the Matenadaran, he led the Karabakh movement for the unification of the Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia which began in 1988. After Armenia&#x27;s declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in September 1991, Ter-Petrosyan was elected president in October 1991 with overwhelming public support. He led the country through the First Nagorno-Karabakh War with neighboring Azerbaijan.

He was reelected in the 1996 presidential election, which was marred by accusations of electoral fraud, sparking mass protests led by runner-up Vazgen Manukyan. The mass rallies were suppressed by military force. Due to disagreements with key members of his government over a peace proposal for the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, especially Defence Minister Vazgen Sargsyan and Prime Minister Robert Kocharyan, Ter-Petrosyan resigned on 3 February 1998.

From his resignation up to 2007, Ter-Petrosyan was inactive in the political scene. However, he made a political comeback in September 2007 and ran for president in 2008. He faced one of his former government members, at the time Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan. According to official results, he earned 21.5% of the total vote. Ter-Petrosyan claimed the elections were rigged and led thousands of his supporters in mass protests against the alleged electoral fraud and called for new elections. After a week of mass protests, the government used police and military force to disperse his supporters, resulting in the deaths of ten people on 1 March 2008.

On 1 August 2008, Ter-Petrosyan founded the Armenian National Congress (ANC) which included more than a dozen of political parties and NGOs. Being the main opposition party in Armenia at the time, the ANC was out of the parliament and was mainly involved in street protests against Serzh Sargsyan&#x27;s government. They organized mass rallies in 2011, forcing the government to grant several political concessions. In parliamentary elections in 2012, the ANC received 7.1% of the popular vote, gaining 7 seats. Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s party lost those seats in the following elections and has not entered parliament since. He led the ANC&#x27;s electoral list during snap parliamentary elections in June 2021, where the party again failed to enter parliament.

==Early life and education==
Ter-Petrosyan was born on 9 January 1946 in Aleppo, Syria to an Armenian family descended from a long line of priests living near Musa Dagh in the region of Hatay (now located in the south of Turkey). His family took part in the armed resistance at Musa Dagh during the Armenian genocide before fleeing to Syria. His father, Hakob Ter-Petrosyan, was first a member of the Hunchakian Party and later a founding member of the Syrian Communist Party.

He had three brothers, Telman (1936–1997), Petros (1938–2013) and Kamo (born 1948), as well as a younger sister, Iskuhi (1953–2015). His family emigrated to Soviet Armenia in 1947, when he was still an infant, just before the birth of his only living younger brother, Kamo. 

In 1969, he graduated from the Oriental Studies Department of Yerevan State University. In 1972, he completed his postgraduate studies at Leningrad State University. In 1987, he received his doctoral degree from the same university. From 1972 to 1979, Ter-Petrosyan worked as junior researcher at the Manuk Abeghian Literature Institute of the Armenian Academy of Sciences. From 1979 to 1984, he held the post of science secretary at Matenadaran named after Saint Mesrob Mashdots. 

Since 1984, he has worked at Matenadaran as a senior researcher.

==Academic career== 
Ter-Petrosyan wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Assyrian language and its ties to Armenian. In addition, he is the author of more than 30 books, about 80 scientific articles in Armenian, French and Russian, as well as thousands of political publications in the multilingual press (speeches, articles, interviews, press conferences, etc.). He is a member of the Writers Union of Armenia, the French Asian Society, the Mekhitarist Academy in Venice and a recipient of honorary doctorates from the University of La Verne, University of Sofia, Paris-Sorbonne University and University of Strasbourg.

==Karabakh movement and independence of Armenia==

In late 1987 and early 1988, the Karabakh movement emerged in Soviet Armenia and the Armenian-majority Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast with the goal of transferring the autonomous region from Azerbaijan to Armenia. On 19 May 1988, Levon Ter-Petrosyan, Vazgen Manukyan and 9 others founded a new Karabakh Committee, which soon took leadership of the Karabakh movement from the older committee led by Zori Balayan and Igor Muradyan. Levon Ter-Petrosyan was the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the committee. Under the leadership of Ter-Petrosyan and Manukyan, the Karabakh movement transformed from being purely concerned with the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia into a broader movement for democratization.

From 10 December 1988 to 31 May 1989, Ter-Petrosyan was imprisoned in Moscow&#x27;s Matrosskaya Tishina prison together with other members of the Karabakh Committee; they returned to Yerevan after their release and continued their activities. In 1989, Ter-Petrosyan and the other members of the Karabakh Committee founded a political party called the Pan-Armenian National Movement (ANM, also known by its Armenian acronym HHSh). Later on, Ter-Petrosyan became the party&#x27;s chairman. On 27 August 1989, he was elected as a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR, and reelected on 20 May 1990. In elections in May 1990, the Pan-Armenian National Movement won a majority of seats in the Supreme Soviet of Armenia, becoming the first non-communist party to take power in a Soviet republic. On 4 August of the same year, Ter-Petrosyan was elected Chairman of the Supreme Council of Armenia, becoming the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Armenia.

As clashes between newly formed Armenian militias and Soviet forces intensified in mid-1990, Ter-Petrosyan was pressured by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to disarm the militias. Ter-Petrosyan complied, but the militias continued their activities in Nagorno-Karabakh. On 23 August 1990, Armenia formally declared its intention to become an independent state with Nagorno-Karabakh as an integral part. On 12 September 1990, Ter-Petrosyan met with Gorbachev, Azerbaijani leader Ayaz Mutalibov and other Soviet officials, where Gorbachev rejected Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s demands to withdraw the Soviet Army from Armenian settlements and create a line of demarcation between Armenians and Azebaijanis in Nagorno-Karabakh. Although Ter-Petrosyan initially expressed his willingness to include Armenia in a new union of sovereign states to replace the USSR, he found Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s proposal for a new union treaty unacceptable. Armenia was one of six Soviet republics not to participate in the referendum on the new union held in March 1991.

As Armenia moved toward independence, further clashes occurred both within Armenia and on the border with Azerbaijan in May 1991, and Soviet troops undertook an operation to deport Armenian villagers from parts of Azerbaijan. Ter-Petrosyan publicly stated on 6 May 1991 that &quot;To all intents and purposes, the Soviet Union has declared war on Armenia.&quot; Ter-Petrosyan opposed the coup attempt against Gorbachev in August 1991. He attended unsuccessful negotiations with Ayaz Mutalibov mediated by Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev in late September. On 20 September 1991, Armenians voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence, and the country officially declared independence three days later.

==Presidency: 1991–1998==

===First term ===

Ter-Petrosyan was elected the first President of the newly independent Republic of Armenia on 16 October 1991, receiving 83% of the vote. On 18 October 1991, he signed onto Gorbachev&#x27;s failed attempt to form an economic community out of the collapsing Soviet Union and preserve the economic ties between the republics (only 8 of the 15 republics agreed to sign). Ter-Petrosyan then brought Armenia into the Commonwealth of Independent States which formed after the formal abolition of the Soviet Union in December 1991. Ter-Petrosyan appointed Vazgen Sargsyan the first Defense Minister of independent Armenia in December 1991. On 28 January 1992, the Armenian government passed the historical decree &quot;On the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Armenia&quot;, which formally created the Armed Forces of Armenia.
 In late 1991 and early 1992, the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh expanded into a full-scale war. With the rise of hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh, in March 1992, Sargsyan announced that Armenia needed a 30,000-strong army for maintaining security. Under Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s leadership as the commander-in-chief on 9 May 1992, the Armenian forces recorded their first major military success in Nagorno-Karabakh with the capture of Shusha. Another significant victory for the Armenian forces was recorded weeks later with the capture of Lachin, which connects Armenia proper with Nagorno-Karabakh. In the summer of 1992, following the launch of Operation Goranboy, the Armenian forces had major losses. Ter-Petrosyan dismissed Defense Minister Vazgen Sargsyan, as between October 1992 and March 1993 Sargsyan served as the Presidential Adviser on Defence Affairs and the Presidential Envoy to Border Regions of Armenia, Ter-Petrosyan appointed his comrade-turned-rival Vazgen Manukyan to the post. According to Vazgen Manukyan, on several occasions, the more cautious Ter-Petrosyan was, he deliberately not fully informed about the extent of the Armenian military&#x27;s participation in operations in Nagorno-Karabakh. In early April 1993, the Armenian forces captured Kelbajar, a city outside the originally contested areas, causing international attention to the conflict. Turkey closed its border with Armenia, while the United Nations passed a resolution condemning the act. Vazgen Manukyan was dismissed from his post in August 1993. In the summer of 1993, Armenian forces gained more territories and, by August controlled Fizuli, Jebrail, and Zangelan. It was estimated that during Ter-Petrosian&#x27;s presidency, the significant amount of military expenditure, played a key role in the outcome of the war and the formation of the army. By early 1994, both countries were devastated by the war. On 5 May, the Bishkek Protocol was signed by the heads of the parliaments of Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, backed by Armenia, established &quot;de facto&quot; control of these lands. The war ended in an Armenian victory with the signing of a ceasefire agreement in May 1994 by representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.

Despite Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s efforts to establish normal relations with Turkey, which included arranging for the transport of wheat to Armenia from the EU through Turkish territory and attending the funeral of Turkish president Turgut Özal in Ankara, the capture of Kalbajar district by Armenian forces in April 1993 significantly worsened relations with Turkey. That month Turkey closed its border with Armenia. As on other occasions, Vazgen Manukyan. deliberately presented only a small part of the Kalbajar operation to Ter-Petrosyan. The Armenian-Turkish border remains closed to this day and the two countries have no diplomatic relations. 

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union took place as a result and against the backdrop of general economic stagnation, even regression. As the Gosplan, which had set up production chains to cross SSR lines, broke down, the inter-republic economic connections were also disrupted, leading to an even more serious breakdown of the post-Soviet economies. Armenia suffered severe economic hardship in the first years following independence, It is difficult to overstate the calamity that faced Armenia in 1991–93. The country, land-locked and with few natural resources, was beginning the transition from a centrally-planned to a market economy, with very limited institutional capacity. As a result of the conflict raging with Azerbaijan over Nagorno Karabakh (NK), an ethnic Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan, refugees from Azerbaijan was streaming into Armenia. At the same time, Azerbaijan imposed a trade embargo, shutting off most supplies of energy and other critical goods (the main natural gas pipelines which supplied Armenia through Azerbaijan were closed) due to the full-scale war. The border with Turkey, which was sympathetic to Azerbaijan, was closed, and the main routes into the country to the north through Georgia were subject to frequent interdiction and the route through Georgia was frequently closed due to civil unrest there. As Armenia was deeply integrated with the Soviet economy and had the highest level of imports of any Soviet republic. Armenia&#x27;s GDP declined drastically from 1991 to 1993 because of these factors, and fuel shortages were ubiquitous. The worst years of the energy crisis have been dubbed the &quot;dark and cold years&quot; in Armenia, alleviated after the restarting of Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant in October 1995. In 1992, Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s prime minister Hrant Bagratyan adopted an economic reform program to rapidly marketize the Armenian economy. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union from 1991 to 1993, Armenia&#x27;s income decline of 63 percent was greater than that of any Former Soviet Union country except Georgia. The average decline for the Commonwealth Independent States (CIS, excluding the Baltics) was 51 percent. The reform adopted by Hrant Bagratyan also made a good start on developing the basic legal framework necessary for a market economy. The Property Law enacted in October 1991, provided a legal basis for companies and a basic commercial code. All legal restrictions on private entry and competition in wholesale trade were removed. And the Enterprise Privatization Law (July 1992) provided that a privatization program be developed every year to sell remaining state-owned firms, including large firms. He was qualified as Leader of the Armenian economic reforms end of the 20th century, defined by the World Bank as one of the best among former Soviet Union republics and countries of Eastern Europe. Armenia&#x27;s economic hardships during Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s presidency made him deeply unpopular among much of the population, and some 693,999.00 people emigrated, nevertheless, it was estimated that the emigration numbers continued to grow after his resignation.
Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s first term also saw significant tension between his government and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), a nationalist political party which holds enormous influence in the Armenian diaspora and had established itself as Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s main opposition. On 29 June 1992, Ter-Petrosyan delivered a televised address where he accused the ARF of collaboration with the KGB and pilfering funds raised from the diaspora intended for Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Two years later, on 28 December 1994, Ter-Petrosyan declared that a plot by the ARF to violently overthrow the government had been uncovered. The party was banned from the Republic of Armenia and its offices were raided by police. Thirty-one ARF members, who would later be known as the &quot;Dro Group&quot;, an alleged secret wing of the ARF, were arrested and charged with conspiracy to overthrow the government, committing several assassinations, and drug trafficking; all were found guilty. The ban on the ARF was lifted by Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s successor Robert Kocharyan soon after Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s resignation.

===1996 reelection===
Although Ter-Petrosyan was initially expected to win the 1996 presidential election by a large margin due to the opposition being divided, three other candidates dropped out of the race and endorsed Vazgen Manukyan. According to the official results, Ter-Petrosyan received about 52%, just above the 50% required to win without a runoff election. His reelection was marred by allegations of electoral fraud reported by the opposition and supported by many international observers. On 25 September 1996, around 200,000 people in Yerevan came out to protest the election results, then stormed the parliament building and beat the speaker and deputy speaker of parliament following a speech by Vazgen Manukyan. Tanks and troops were brought into Yerevan to end the protests. On the same day, Defence Minister Vazgen Sargsyan stated that &quot;even if they [the opposition] win 100 percent of the votes, neither the Army nor the National Security and Interior Ministry would recognize such political leaders.&quot; Later in January 1999, Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s interior minister at the time of the election Vano Siradeghyan admitted that the government had resorted to vote-rigging to secure Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s victory without a runoff election and stated that after the crackdown, Ter-Petrosyan fell into a three-month depression. According to Siradeghyan, &quot;the whole state apparatus was demoralized, paralyzed and no government was formed during [the ensuing] three months.&quot; Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s popularity waned further as the opposition started blaming him for the economic quagmire that Armenia&#x27;s post-Soviet economy was in.

===Resignation===
Ter-Petrosyan was forced to step down in February 1998 after advocating a compromised settlement of the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh which many Armenians regarded as undermining their security. Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s key ministers, namely then-Prime Minister Robert Kocharyan, Defense Minister Vazgen Sargsyan and Interior Minister Serzh Sargsyan, refused to accept a peace plan for Karabakh put forward by international mediators in September 1997. The leadership of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic were also opposed to the plan. The plan, accepted by Ter-Petrosyan and Azerbaijan&#x27;s leader Heydar Aliyev, called for a &quot;phased&quot; settlement of the conflict which would postpone an agreement on Karabakh&#x27;s status, the main stumbling block. The &quot;phased&quot; approach envisioned the return of most of the Armenian-occupied Azerbaijani territories around Nagorno-Karabakh in exchange for the deployment of OSCE peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding districts in the first and second phases, followed by the lifting of the Azerbaijani and Turkish blockades of Armenia in the third stage, and leaving for last the issues of Nagorno-Karabakh&#x27;s status, the Lachin Corridor, and the return of displaced persons. When Levon Ter-Petrosyan stepped down from the presidency, he compared himself to the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and stated that he was resigning was to avoid destabilizing the country. Commenting on the circumstances of his resignation in 2021, Ter-Petrosyan insisted that Vazgen Sargsyan and Kocharyan were &quot;ready for civil war&quot; if he did not resign.

==Comeback==
After his resignation, Ter-Petrosyan rarely appeared in public and avoided contact with the media, although there were speculations that he would run for the office of president of Armenia in the general election in February 2003. He instead devoted his time to scientific research. In 2005 and 2007, he published his two-volume historical work titled &quot;The Crusaders and the Armenians&quot;.

===2008 election=== 

On 21 September 2007, Ter-Petrosyan made his first public speech in nearly ten years at an event in Yerevan marking the 16th anniversary of Armenia&#x27;s declaration of independence. In this speech he was strongly critical of President Kocharyan. Subsequently, Ter-Petrosyan officially announced his candidacy in the 2008 presidential election in a speech in Yerevan on 26 October 2007. He accused Kocharyan&#x27;s government of massive corruption, involving the theft of &quot;at least three to four billion dollars&quot; over the previous five years. He was critical of the government&#x27;s claims of strong economic growth and argued that Kocharyan and his prime minister, Serzh Sargsyan, had come to accept a solution to the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh that was effectively the same solution that he had proposed ten years earlier. A number of opposition parties rallied behind him after his return to the political arena, including the People&#x27;s Party of Armenia led by Stepan Demirchyan, the Republic Party led by Aram Sargsyan, the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party, &quot;Azadakrum&quot; movement for Jirair Sefilian, the &quot;New Times&quot; Party, and Raffi Hovannisian&#x27;s Heritage Party.

==== Protests ====
Final results from the election, which was held on 19 February 2008, officially showed Ter-Petrosyan in second place with 21.5% of the vote. Then he and his supporters accused the government of rigging the election and claimed victory; beginning on 20 February he led continuous protests involving tens of thousands of his supporters in Yerevan.
In the early morning hours of 1 March, reportedly acting on evidence of firearms in the camp, the authorities moved in to inspect the tents set up by demonstrators. Law enforcement agents then violently dispersed hundreds of protestors. Ter-Petrosyan was placed under de facto house arrest, not being allowed to leave his home, though the authorities later denied the allegations. A few hours later, tens of thousands of protestors or more gathered at Myasnikyan Square to protest the government&#x27;s act. Police, overwhelmed by the sheer size of the crowd, pulled out. A state of emergency was implemented by President Kocharyan at 17:00, allowing the army to be moved into the capital. At night, a few thousand protestors barricaded themselves using commandeered municipal buses. As a result of the clashes, eight protestors and two policemen died. Ter-Petrosyan addressed his supporters by phone at around 2–3 a.m. on March 2, telling them to go home to avoid further casualties. On March 5, Ter-Petrosyan appealed to the Constitutional Court to have the election declared invalid, which was rejected.

==Armenian National Congress==
In 2011, Ter-Petrosyan again took a leading role in protests that erupted in Armenia as part of a wave of regional unrest. As leader of the Armenian National Congress opposition bloc, formed two years prior to the outbreak of protests, Ter-Petrosyan accused President Serzh Sargsyan, elected in the disputed 2008 election, of being &quot;illegitimate&quot; and called for the release of political prisoners, the resignation of the government, and a full inquiry into the violence that claimed the lives of ten people on 1 March 2008.

===2009 Yerevan election===
===2012 parliamentary election===
Levon Ter-Petrosyan led the Armenian National Congress (ANC) during the 2012 parliamentary election. The ANC won 7.08% (106,903) of the popular vote.

===2013 presidential election===

The ANC held its convention on 22 December 2012. Ter-Petrosyan talked about groups promoting pro-Western and pro-Russian divisions within the Armenian society and the political parties calling them &quot;dangerous forces&quot;. Ter-Petrosyan did not announce whether he will run for president in February 2013. Few days after the convention on 25 December 2012, Ter-Petrosyan gave &quot;Chorrord Inknishkhanutyun&quot; an interview eventually declaring his decision not to run for the office. He claimed that &quot;dozens of arguments are being put forward by those advocating and opposing my nomination, but the most important argument has been avoided. Can anyone who has respect for his people vie for a presidential post at the age of 68? Such things usually do not happen in developed democratic countries ... everything is concentrated in the hands of a bunch of criminals who have usurped power.&quot;

The official ANC statement on 27 December 2012 said that they are not participating in the upcoming presidential election in any form. The ANC claimed that the participation in the election is &quot;legitimization of the illegal regime&quot;. Rumors about Ter-Petrosyan&#x27;s possible retirement from active politics spread soon after his 25 December announcement. Armenians newspapers argued that Levon Zurabyan, the ANC speaker, could become his successor.

On 7 February 2013, Ter-Petrosyan gave another interview to the &quot;Chorrord Inknishkhanutyun&quot; daily newspaper. He acknowledged that the ANC cannot continue its activities with the same structure. He admitted that the alliance had &quot;internal fermentations&quot; and called &quot;various political forces and non-partisan individuals of the Congress to merge into one single political party.&quot;

The presidential election was held on 18 February 2013. Voting in a polling station in central Yerevan, Ter-Petrosyan said the journalists he voted for the &quot;sake of the Republic of Armenia.&quot; According to the official results, incumbent Serzh Sargsyan won with over 58% of the vote. Raffi Hovannisian, the main opposition candidate who earned 37% of the total, claimed victory and started mass protests the next day. On 23 February 2013, Ter-Petrosyan addressed the gathered at the Pan-Armenian National Movement party convention. He claimed Hovannisian won the election and accused incumbent Sargsyan in rigging the election. Talking about Hovannisian&#x27;s post-election protests, Ter-Petrosyan stated &quot;I see words, I see speeches, but there is no action, no plan of actions.&quot;

On 13 April 2013, the Armenian National Congress was officially transformed from an alliance of 18 original parties into a single party, on the base of the Pan-Armenian National Movement. During his speech at the founding convention, Ter-Petrosyan blamed Hovannisian for having no political agenda in his protests. In particular, Ter-Petrosyan said &quot;during the current post-election period we have seen everything but political processes&quot;.

===2013 Yerevan election===

The ANC, now a party rather than an alliance, went to the 2013 Yerevan City Council election alone. Their list was headed by Yerevan&#x27;s former mayor Vahagn Khachatryan. ANC failed to pass the 6% threshold by gaining only 1.2%.

=== 2021 snap parliamentary election ===
Ter-Petrosyan led the ANC&#x27;s electoral list in the June 2021 snap parliamentary elections. Ter-Petrosyan announced that he would not take up his parliamentary mandate if the ANC enters parliament but fails to achieve a majority. The ANC received 19,647 votes in the 2021 election, amounting to 1.54% of the vote, below the 5% threshold required to enter parliament.

==2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and aftermath==
During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Ter-Petrosyan met with fellow ex-presidents of Armenia Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan as well as ex-presidents of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Arkadi Ghukasyan and Bako Sahakyan to discuss the situation. In October 2020, Kocharyan and Ter-Petrosyan requested that Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan give them permission to go to Moscow as special negotiators. Pashinyan accepted their request to go to Moscow to meet with Russian officials, but not as official negotiators. The visit never occurred as Kocharyan tested positive for COVID-19.

After the defeat of the Armenian side in the war, the signing of the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement and the outbreak of protests in Armenia against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, Ter-Petrosyan released a statement where he warned of the risk of a destructive civil war and called for the solution of the political crisis by constitutional means only. He called for the prime minister&#x27;s voluntary resignation and accused him and the opposition candidate Vazgen Manukyan of leading the country to civil confrontation through their refusal to compromise.

On 25 March 2021 Ter-Petrosyan once again met with ex-presidents Kocharyan and Sargsyan. On 5 May 2021, Ter-Petrosyan declared that the reason for the meeting was for him to propose an electoral alliance between the former presidents (his long-time political opponents) in order to unseat Prime Minister Pashinyan in the 2021 Armenian parliamentary election. Ter-Petrosyan repeated the proposal on May 5, which was rejected by both Kocharyan and Sargsyan.

==Personal life==
He is married to Lyudmila (née Pleskovskaya); the couple has one son, David, who is an economist and businessman, and four grandchildren (Levon, Hakob, Lusia, Areg).

Ter-Petrosyan is fluent in Armenian and Russian, with working knowledge of 9 other languages.

<text>Internet security is a branch of computer security. It encompasses the Internet, browser security, web site security, and network security as it applies to other applications or operating systems as a whole. Its objective is to establish rules and measures to use against attacks over the Internet. The Internet is an inherently insecure channel for information exchange, with high risk of intrusion or fraud, such as phishing, online viruses, trojans, ransomware and worms.

Many methods are used to combat these threats, including encryption and ground-up engineering.

==Threats==
===Emerging Threats ===
Emerging cyberthreats are a result of recent technological breakthroughs. For example, deepfakes use AI to produce audio and video that seems real but are actually fake, which increases the danger of fraud and false information. Furthermore, traditional risks can be automated and strengthened by AI-driven attacks, making them harder to identify and neutralize.
===Malicious software ===

Malicious software comes in many forms, such as viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, and worms.

* Malware, a portmanteau of malicious software, is any software used to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems. Malware is defined by its malicious intent, acting against the requirements of the computer user, and does not include software that unintentionally causes harm due to some deficiency. The term badware applies to both malware and unintentionally harmful software.
* A botnet is a network of computers that have been taken over by a robot or bot that performs large-scale malicious acts for its creator.
* Computer viruses are programs that can replicate their structures or effects by infecting other files or structures on a computer. The typical purpose of a virus is to take over a computer to steal data.
* Computer worms are programs that can replicate themselves throughout a computer network.
* Ransomware is a type of malware that restricts access to the computer system that it infects, and demands a ransom in order for the restriction to be removed.
* Scareware is a program of usually limited or no benefit, containing malicious payloads, that is sold via unethical marketing practices. The selling approach uses social engineering to cause shock, anxiety, or the perception of a threat, generally directed at an unsuspecting user.
* Spyware refers to programs that surreptitiously monitor activity on a computer system and report that information to others without the user&#x27;s consent. 
* One particular kind of spyware is key logging malware. Often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard.
* A Trojan horse, commonly known as a &quot;Trojan&quot;, is a general term for malware that pretends to be harmless, so that a user will be convinced to download it onto the computer.

=== Denial-of-service attacks ===
A denial-of-service attack (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) is an attempt to make a computer resource unavailable to its intended users. It works by making so many service requests at once that the system is overwhelmed and becomes unable to process any of them. DoS may target cloud computing systems. According to business participants in an international security survey, 25% of respondents experienced a DoS attack in 2007 and another 16.8% in 2010. DoS attacks often use bots (or a botnet) to carry out the attack.

===Phishing===
Phishing targets online users in an attempt to extract sensitive information such as passwords and financial information. Phishing occurs when the attacker pretends to be a trustworthy entity, either via email or a web page. Victims are directed to web pages that appear to be legitimate, but instead route information to the attackers. Tactics such as email spoofing attempt to make emails appear to be from legitimate senders, or long complex URLs hide the actual website. Insurance group RSA claimed that phishing accounted for worldwide losses of $10.8 billion in 2016.

=== Man in the middle ===
A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is a type of cyber attack. Cybercriminals can intercept data sent between people to steal, eavesdrop or modify data for certain malicious purposes, such as extorting money and identity theft. Public WiFi is often insecure because monitoring or intercepting Web traffic is unknown.

=== Application vulnerabilities ===
Applications used to access Internet resources may contain security vulnerabilities such as memory safety bugs or flawed authentication checks. Such bugs can give network attackers full control over the computer.

=== User Awareness ===

As cyberthreats become more complex, user education is essential for improving internet security. Important areas of attention consist of:

* Users should have the ability to spot phishing emails by looking for odd sender addresses, cliched salutations, and language that seems urgent. Both simulated phishing exercises and real-world examples can be incorporated into training programs.
* Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) and stressing the usage of strong, one-of-a-kind passwords are essential for protecting personal information. Additionally, users need to understand the dangers of oversharing on social media and how crucial it is to change their privacy settings.
* It&#x27;s critical to educate people on how to spot secure websites (search for HTTPS), steer clear of dubious downloads, and use caution when clicking links. Also, users need to be aware of the dangers of utilizing open WiFi networks without a VPN.

==Countermeasures==

===Network layer security===
TCP/IP protocols may be secured with cryptographic methods and security protocols. These protocols include Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), succeeded by Transport Layer Security (TLS) for web traffic, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) for email, and IPsec for network layer security.

===Threat modeling===
Threat Modeling tools helps you to proactively analyze the cyber security posture of a system or system of systems and in that way prevent security threats.

===Multi-factor authentication===
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an access control method in which a user is granted access only after successfully presenting separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism – two or more from the following categories: knowledge (something they know), possession (something they have), and inference (something they are). Internet resources, such as websites and email, may be secured using this technique.

===Security token===
Some online sites offer customers the ability to use a six-digit code which randomly changes every 30–60 seconds on a physical security token. The token has built-in computations and manipulates numbers based on the current time. This means that every thirty seconds only a certain array of numbers validate access. The website is made aware of that device&#x27;s serial number and knows the computation and correct time to verify the number. After 30–60 seconds the device presents a new random six-digit number to log into the website.

===Electronic mail security===
====Background====
Email messages are composed, delivered, and stored in a multiple step process, which starts with the message&#x27;s composition. When a message is sent, it is transformed into a standard format according to RFC 2822. Using a network connection, the mail client sends the sender&#x27;s identity, the recipient list and the message content to the server. Once the server receives this information, it forwards the message to the recipients.

==== Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) ====
Pretty Good Privacy provides confidentiality by encrypting messages to be transmitted or data files to be stored using an encryption algorithm such as Triple DES or CAST-128. Email messages can be protected by using cryptography in various ways, such as the following:
*Digitally signing the message to ensure its integrity and confirm the sender&#x27;s identity.
*Encrypting the message body of an email message to ensure its confidentiality.
*Encrypting the communications between mail servers to protect the confidentiality of both message body and message header.

The first two methods, message signing and message body encryption, are often used together; however, encrypting the transmissions between mail servers is typically used only when two organizations want to protect emails regularly sent between them. For example, the organizations could establish a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt communications between their mail servers. Unlike methods that only encrypt a message body, a VPN can encrypt all communication over the connection, including email header information such as senders, recipients, and subjects. However, a VPN does not provide a message signing mechanism, nor can it provide protection for email messages along the entire route from sender to recipient.

==== Message Authentication Code ====
A Message authentication code (MAC) is a cryptography method that uses a secret key to digitally sign a message. This method outputs a MAC value that can be decrypted by the receiver, using the same secret key used by the sender. The Message Authentication Code protects both a message&#x27;s data integrity as well as its authenticity.

=== Firewalls ===
A computer firewall controls access to a single computer. A network firewall controls access to an entire network. A firewall is a security device — computer hardware or software — that filters traffic and blocks outsiders. It generally consists of gateways and filters. Firewalls can also screen network traffic and block traffic deemed unauthorized.

====Web security====
Firewalls restrict incoming and outgoing network packets. Only authorized traffic is allowed to pass through it. Firewalls create checkpoints between networks and computers. Firewalls can block traffic based on IP source and TCP port number. They can also serve as the platform for IPsec. Using tunnel mode, firewalls can implement VPNs. Firewalls can also limit network exposure by hiding the internal network from the public Internet.

====Types of firewall====

===== Packet filter =====
A packet filter processes network traffic on a packet-by-packet basis. Its main job is to filter traffic from a remote IP host, so a router is needed to connect the internal network to the Internet. The router is known as a screening router, which screens packets leaving and entering the network.

===== Stateful packet inspection=====
In a stateful firewall the circuit-level gateway is a proxy server that operates at the network level of an Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model and statically defines what traffic will be allowed. Circuit proxies forward network packets (formatted data) containing a given port number, if the port is permitted by the algorithm. The main advantage of a proxy server is its ability to provide Network Address Translation (NAT), which can hide the user&#x27;s IP address from the Internet, effectively protecting internal information from the outside.

===== Application-level gateway =====
An application-level firewall is a third-generation firewall where a proxy server operates at the very top of the OSI model, the IP suite application level. A network packet is forwarded only if a connection is established using a known protocol. Application-level gateways are notable for analyzing entire messages rather than individual packets.

=== Browser choice ===
Web browser market share predicts the share of hacker attacks. For example, Internet Explorer 6, which used to lead the market, was heavily attacked.

==Protections ==

===Antivirus===
Antivirus software can protect a programmable device by detecting and eliminating malware. A variety of techniques are used, such as signature-based, heuristics, rootkit, and real-time.

=== Password managers ===
A password manager is a software application that creates, stores and provides passwords to applications. Password managers encrypt passwords. The user only needs to remember a single master password to access the store.

===Security suites===
Security suites were first offered for sale in 2003 (McAfee) and contain firewalls, anti-virus, anti-spyware and other components. They also offer theft protection, portable storage device safety check, private Internet browsing, cloud anti-spam, a file shredder or make security-related decisions (answering popup windows) and several were free of charge.

=== Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) ===
A promising technology with low production and installation costs, unattended network operation, and autonomous longtime operation. According to research, building a secure Internet of Things (IoT) should start with securing WSNs ahead of other components.

==History==
At the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks (NAMSB) conference in January 1976, Atalla Corporation (founded by Mohamed Atalla) and Bunker Ramo Corporation (founded by George Bunker and Simon Ramo) introduced the earliest products designed for dealing with online security. Atalla later added its Identikey hardware security module, and supported processing online transactions and network security. Designed to process bank transactions online, the Identikey system was extended to shared-facility operations. It was compatible with various switching networks, and was capable of resetting itself electronically to any one of 64,000 irreversible nonlinear algorithms as directed by card data information. In 1979, Atalla introduced the first network security processor (NSP).

<doc id="863105" wikidata="Q15944872" url="?curid=863105" title="Mount Seir">
<text>Mount Seir () is the ancient and biblical name for a mountainous region stretching between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba in the northwestern region of Edom and southeast of the Kingdom of Judah. It may also have marked the older historical limit of Ancient Egypt in Canaan. A place called &quot;Seir, in the land of Shasu&quot; (&quot;tꜣ-šꜣsw sʿr&quot; – &quot;ta-Shasu seʿer&quot;), thought to be near Petra, Jordan, is listed in the temple of Amenhotep III at Soleb (ca. 1380 BC).

The Nabataean equivalent is šrʾ, and the modern Arabic equivalent is thought to be al-Sharat () in Jordan.

==Hebrew Bible==
The Hebrew Bible mentions two distinct geographical areas named Seir: a &#x27;land of Seir&#x27; and &#x27;Mount Seir&#x27; in the South, bordered by the Arabah to the west; and another &#x27;Mount Seir&#x27; further north, on the north boundary of Judah, mentioned in the Book of Joshua ().

===Southern land of Seir, Mount Seir===
Mount Seir was named for Seir the Horite, whose offspring, the Horites, had previously inhabited the area (). The children of Esau, the Edomites, battled against the Horites and destroyed them (Deuteronomy ). Mount Seir is specifically noted as the place where Esau made his home (Genesis ; Joshua ).

In the Book of Numbers, the prophet Balaam, predicting Israelite victories over the Trans-Jordanian nations at the end of their Exodus from Egypt, stated &quot;Edom shall be a possession; Seir also, his enemies, shall be a possession&quot; ().

In the antique Song of Deborah in the Book of Judges, God is described as emerging from Seir to lead the Israelites in battle ().

Mount Seir is also given as the location where the remnants &quot;of the Amalekites that had escaped&quot; were annihilated by five hundred Simeonites (1 Chronicles ). In , the &quot;inhabitants of Mt. Seir&quot;, i.e. the Edomites, came along with the Ammonites and Moabites against Jehoshaphat of Judah, however &quot;the LORD set ambushments&quot; against them, causing their forces to annihilate one another. Mount Seir is also referenced in the prophetic books as a term for Edom, as in Isaiah and Ezekiel and .

===Northern Mount Seir===
There is also another Seir mountain near Hebron which, according to , was allotted to the tribe of Judah, near the modern town of Sa&#x27;ir in the West Bank of the Palestinian territories.

==Egyptian sources==
Before the emergence of the Israelite kingdoms and of Edom, with Mount Seir standing on the Edomite side of the border, this range marked the southeastern border of Egyptian Canaan (Late Bronze Age). This is suggested by the description of the military campaign undertaken in Canaan by Ramses III (r. 1186–1155 BCE), and possibly also by the Amarna letter EA 288, if &quot;the land of Šeru&quot; is to be understood to mean Seir.

==Geography==

Chōsei District occupies an area of central Chiba Prefecture to the east of the Bōsō Peninsula. The west of the district ranges from the Bōsō Hill Range to the Kujūkuri Plain; the east of the district runs along the broad coast of the Kujūkuri Beach on the Pacific Ocean. The Ichinomiya River () emerges from the Bōsō Hill Range in Chōnan and empties into the Pacific Ocean at Kujukuri Beach in Chōsei.

==History==

==Early period==

During the Edo period, almost all of the area present-day Chōsei District was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under direct control of the central government and administered by various &quot;hatamoto,&quot; with the exception of Ichinomiya, most of which was under the rule of Ichinomiya Domain, a minor feudal domain of the Tokugawa shogunate ruled by the Kano clan.

==Modern period==

Chōsei District was created on April 1, 1889 out of the merger of the short-lived early Meiji period districts of Nagara (3 towns, 17 villages) and Kamihabu (1 town, five villages). The administrative seat of the district was located in Mobara.

Chōsei District, since its creation, has seen extensive administrative reorganization. Shirakata Village was elevated to town status on February 11, 1940. Mobara was elevated to city status on April 1, 1952, and ceased to be part of Chōsei District. Taitō merged with Furusawa in Isumi District, and ceased to be part of Chōsei District. Nagara was raised to town status on April 29, 1955, and Honnō merged into the city of Mobara on May 1, 1972. Mutsuzawa was raised to town status on April 1, 1983. The district now consists of five towns and one village.

A plan to merge the municipalities of Chōsei District into the city of Mobara, and thus dissolve the district, was discussed beginning in 2002. The planning committee of 2002 failed to reach a consensus, as did the planning committee of 2004. A new planning committee, the was formed in 2007, but was dissolved after one year.

==Economy==

The coastal areas of Chōsei District once depended on the fishing industry, but fishing in the district has been in long decline. The district has extensive greenhouse fruit and vegetable production. The mountainous areas of Nagara, Chonan, and Mutsuzawa were once major agricultural centers, but the district&#x27;s proximity to the Keiyō Industrial Zone has transformed agricultural areas into centers of small-scale industry and housing complexes. Tourism in the coastal areas has increased due to the district&#x27;s proximity and rail links to the greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area.

<text>Cardiff Rugby () are one of the four professional Welsh rugby union teams. 
Based in Cardiff, the team play at Cardiff Arms Park. Originally formed in 1876, from 2003 to 2021 the first team was known as the Cardiff Blues before rebranding back to Cardiff Rugby prior to the start of the 2021–22 season.

Cardiff have provided more players to the Welsh national side and British and Irish Lions than any other Welsh club.

They are one of a small number of clubs to have beaten the three major Southern Hemisphere international sides. South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia. The latter have been defeated by Cardiff on six occasions.

They won European Challenge Cup titles in 2010 and 2018, beating Toulon and Gloucester respectively. Cardiff most recently made the knockout stages of the European Rugby Champions Cup in 2012.

Between 2005 and 2018, they also competed in the Anglo-Welsh Cup and won the 2009 title, beating Gloucester at Twickenham.

Today they compete in the United Rugby Championship and in European Professional Club Rugby competitions.

The club also runs one of the five Welsh rugby academies, age group teams and the semi professional Cardiff RFC side, affectionately nicknamed &quot;The Rags&quot;, which competes in Super Rygbi Cymru.

==History==

=== Origins ===
The first reliably recorded Rugby club in Cardiff were Tredegarville, who began playing around 1870. By 1874 a team named Glamorgan FC had been formed and in 1876 they merged with Cardiff Wanderers to form the Cardiff Football Club. At the time, association football was little known in South Wales and it was not until the 20th century that the team became known as Cardiff Rugby Football Club.

Cardiff FC played their first fixture on 2 December 1876, versus Newport at Wentloog Marshes. In 1881, Cardiff beat Llanelli to win the South Wales Challenge Cup, though the tournament was scrapped soon after due to persistent crowd trouble.

=== Hancock and the four three quarter system ===

In 1885 under Frank Hancock, Cardiff began playing with seven backs and eight forwards and perfected what was known at the time as &quot;the passing game&quot;. Up until this time, rugby had been played with 9 forwards and 6 backs, with play focused on forward exchanges. Hancock&#x27;s methods for the first time utilised the full width of the pitch and clever timing of passes to make use of overlaps. He banned his players from kicking penalties and drop goals. For the whole of the 1885–86 season, Cardiff would only score through tries and conversions. They won all but one game all season. Crowds flocked to the Arms Park and the Cardiff style of play helped make rugby football hugely popular throughout the city and surrounding areas. Giving the club a huge well of talent on which to draw from.

These innovations eventually spread throughout the rugby world and in 2011 earned the club a place in the World Rugby Hall of Fame, one of only three clubs to have this honour. Several former Cardiff players including Gwyn Nicholls, Bleddyn Williams, Cliff Morgan, Gareth Edwards, Barry John and Gerald Davies are also members of the Hall of Fame.

=== Early glory ===
In 1898, Cardiff were unofficial club champions of Wales for the first time. One year later, centre Gwyn Nicholls became the first Cardiff player to play for the British and Irish Lions (then only representing the British Isles), and scored a try in both the first and second Tests against Australia. Nicholls would also go on to captain Wales between 1902 and 1906. In 1904, Cardiff players fly-half Percy Bush, centre Rhys Gabe (who later captained Wales in 1907) and Arthur &#x27;Boxer&#x27; Harding all went on the Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand (Nicholls was not selected). Bush scored in the first and second test against Australia, as Nicholls had, and thanks to his tries and goal-kicking during the first three Tests, finished as the top Test points scorer. Gabe scored a try in the third test against Australia, while Harding converted a try in the first Test and was the only Lions player to get on the score sheet against New Zealand, after scoring a penalty goal in the game against them at the end of the tour.

In 1905, there were four Cardiff players in the Wales team that famously beat New Zealand: Harding, Nicholls, Bush, Gabe and Bert Winfield, who would go on to captain Wales three years later. After an eight-year wait, Cardiff also managed to win the unofficial Welsh club championship in 1906 (going unbeaten in every game they played apart from against New Zealand) and 1907.
On New Year&#x27;s Day 1907, Cardiff beat South Africa 17–0, a great achievement considering the national side had been beaten 11–0 by the Boks only a month earlier, and France were thrashed by them 55–6 two days later. The only other team to beat South Africa during their 29-match tour were Scotland.

After this performance, and Wales winning the Five Nations Grand Slam for the first time in 1908, four Cardiff players were selected for the Lions in 1908. Harding was selected as the first Cardiff player to captain the tour and was the only one of the four to have played for the Lions before, the other three being uncapped half-back Willie Morgan, and three-quarters Johnny Williams and Reggie Gibbs. Gibbs remains the only player to have been capped for Wales at least 10 times and averaged more than a try a game, with 17 tries in 16 caps, and Williams came very close to his record with 17 tries in 17 Tests.

The tour was not a success, with the Lions managing to draw the second Test but losing the first and third by over twenty-five points each. However, Gibbs did manage to score in the first Test. The disappointed players made up for their failure the next year by winning the Grand Slam with Wales for the second time in a row and winning the unofficial championship with Cardiff. Cardiff also beat Australia 24–8 on 28 December 1908.
However, following this, the glory years were largely over for Cardiff and Wales, although Wales did manage to win the Grand Slam in 1911, and Cardiff came within one point of beating South Africa in a 7–6 defeat in 1912.

====Between the wars====
The First World War certainly had some effect on the club – Johnnie Williams died in the first weeks of the Battle of the Somme, and many other players returned wounded or simply too old to play rugby. Cardiff were forced to turn to younger talent for their team. Jim Sullivan was a prime example of this, making his first appearance for Cardiff at the age of 16 in October 1920, and went on to make 38 appearances over the rest of the season. In December 1920, just after his 17th birthday, he became the youngest player to ever appear for the Barbarians. However, in June 1921 he signed for professional rugby league club Wigan, beginning a new trend of Welsh union players &quot;going north&quot; to play rugby league.

In 1922, Cardiff Rugby Club and Cardiff Cricket Club would form the Cardiff Athletic Club, and then purchased Cardiff Arms Park.

In the 1930s, Scrum-half Howard Poole, although never capped for Wales, was selected to play for the Lions in 1930, as was Ivor Williams in 1938. The club also won their first unofficial Welsh championship for 28 years in 1937, and managed to retain the title in 1938 and 1939, before the start of the Second World War.

====After the Second World War====
After the resumption of regular rugby, Cardiff beat Australia 11–3 on 21 November 1947, captained by scrum-half Haydn Tanner and were also unofficial Welsh champions in 1947/48, when Bleddyn Williams set a club record of 41 tries in one season, and 1948/49, when the Blue and Blacks went completely unbeaten against Welsh opposition, only Swansea and Newport succeeding in salvaging draws. The club had a fantastic record against Newport during these years, going 15 games unbeaten against them between 1946 and 1950. Cardiff players helped Wales win their first Grand Slam in nearly forty years in 1950, and later that year supplied five players to the Lions for the first time later that year. The five were fly-half Billy Cleaver, prop Cliff Davies, centre Jack Matthews, scrum-half Rex Willis and Bleddyn Williams, the &quot;Prince of Centres&quot;. Williams captained the Lions in the third and fourth Tests against New Zealand. Wales won another Grand Slam in 1952, with much the same side.

In 1952–53, Cardiff won the unofficial Welsh championship again, helped by the rise of prodigiously talented fly-half Cliff Morgan, but the best was still to come. On 21 November 1953, Cardiff faced New Zealand in front of a crowd of 56,000 at the Arms Park and, after a brilliant defensive effort following a 5–0 lead at half-time, hung on to win 8–3. Five Cardiff backs were selected in the Wales team captained by Bleddyn Williams that beat the All Blacks again less than a month later. These two results remain the last time either Cardiff or Wales have beaten New Zealand.

Cardiff repeated their unofficial championship victory two years later in 1955, and had three Lions in the 1955 touring side, notable for not including any of the five that toured in 1950. The three this time were fly-half Morgan, centre Gareth Griffiths and wing Haydn Morris. Morgan, in front of a then-world record crowd of 100,000, helped defeat the South Africans 23–22 with a brilliant try despite an injury to Reg Higgins reducing the Lions to 14 men (no replacements were allowed at this time). After the South Africans squared the series in the second Test, Morgan was made captain for the third Test and inspired the team with a combination a stirring team talk and a great kicking game to a 9–6 victory, ensuring the series could not be lost, after which he was dubbed &quot;Morgan the Magnificent&quot; by the South African press. After his Lions heroics Morgan was made captain of Wales, and helped them win the title (although not the Grand Slam) in 1956.

Australia played against and were defeated by Cardiff for the third time in 1957, 14–11 thanks to two great tries from Gordon Wells, after which a reporter from the Sydney Daily Telegraph wrote &quot;we fell to the world&#x27;s best rugby union club&quot;, and another unofficial championship title was secured in 1957–58, but only second row Bill &quot;Roddy&quot; Evans was selected for the Lions in 1959, although he started four of the six Tests. A downturn in Welsh and Cardiff fortunes occurred around this time, although prop Kingsley Jones and second row Keith Rowlands from the club were still selected for the 1962 Lions tour, and Cardiff managed to come within a point of beating the All Blacks again in 1963, scoring the only try of the game. However, the slump began to end in 1964, when Wales shared the Five Nations title with Scotland, after which Wales won the Triple Crown and the title in 1965, followed by another championship in 1966, although the Grand Slam still eluded them. However, these successes helped Cardiff players centre Ken Jones and prop Howard Norris win places on the Lions tour to New Zealand. Later that year Cardiff beat Australia 14–8, although Wales were not able to repeat the feat a month later, losing 14–11.

The 1968 Lions tour was a historic one, containing a record six Cardiff players, wings Keri Jones and Maurice Richards, prop John O&#x27;Shea, (then) centre Gerald Davies, fly-half Barry John and scrum-half Gareth Edwards. While Jones and Richards would soon switch codes to play rugby league and O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s tour would be marred somewhat by being the first Lion ever to be sent off for foul play, Davies, John and Edwards would go on to become legends, although their careers got off to inauspicious starts, the Lions losing three of the Tests again South Africa and only drawing the other one.

On the domestic front, they were denied silverware, as despite being top of the unofficial table for almost the whole season, the loss of their six Lions at the end of the season allowed Llanelli to overtake them. Cardiff again finished second behind Newport the next year, with Richards the only Lion to make more than 20 appearances. However, Wales won the Five Nations title and Triple Crown in 1969, only denied the Grand Slam by a draw in France, only to be whitewashed in three games against New Zealand and Australia in the summer.

====1970s====
1971 however, was the year in which John, Edwards and Davies would write themselves into history. Davies by this time had left for London Welsh, although he would later return. In the spring, they were all ever-presents in Wales&#x27;s first Grand Slam in 18 years, and in the summer, they were selected for the Lions tour to New Zealand, along with Cardiff teammate John Bevan. The tour remains the only occasion where the Lions have returned victorious from New Zealand. All four Cardiff players started the first Test, and all except Bevan played in the other three Tests. Despite only playing in the first Test, John Bevan became the Lions&#x27; record try scorer (including matches against club teams) with 17. Barry John was given the title &quot;King Barry&quot; by the New Zealanders after scoring 30 of the Lions&#x27; 48 points, and in him and Edwards, Cardiff could justifiably be said to have the best two half-backs in the world.

1971–72 was the first season where the WRU Challenge Cup was introduced. Cardiff reached the semi-final, before being beaten 16–9 at the Brewery Field by Neath, who went on to beat Llanelli in the final. Unfortunately in 1972 Barry John announced his decision to retire at the age of 27, not liking the celebrity status shoved on him and his family after the Lions tour.

The next season was also disappointing for Cardiff, although fullback John Davies scored a club record of 209 points (in his first season for the club). They were soundly beaten by New Zealand 20–4, only a week after Llanelli had beaten them 9–3. In the Cup, they defeated South Wales Police, Mountain Ash, Ebbw Vale, Blaina and Swansea on their way to the final, but were again outclassed and lost 30–7 to Llanelli. In 1973–74 Cardiff reached the Cup semi-finals for the third year running, but were defeated 9–4 by Aberavon. Gareth Edwards however, led his country to a 24–0 win over Australia in November 1973. In 1974, Gerald Davies decided to return to Cardiff from London Welsh. Edwards and Davies were picked for the 1974 Lions tour to South Africa (although Davies refused to go in protest against apartheid) and Edwards started all four Tests, where the Lions went unbeaten through all 22 matches and would probably have won all their games, but in the final Test the South African referee blew the final whist four minutes early with the scores level and the Lions camped on the South African line.

In 1974–75 Cardiff failed to reach the WRU Challenge Cup semi-finals for the first time, losing 13–12 to Bridgend in the third round, despite not conceding a try in the entire Cup. However, on 1 November 1975, Cardiff met Australia for the fifth time in their history and, for the fifth time defeated them, 14–9, despite the absence of Edwards due to influenza. Both Edwards and Davies represented Wales in the 1976 Five Nations Grand Slam. During 1976–77, Cardiff defeated Pontypool and Aberavon on their way to the Challenge Cup final, where they were beaten 16–15 by Newport. Edwards decided not to go on the 1977 Lions tour, to show loyalty to his company who had let him go on three Lions tours previously. However, another Cardiff scrum-half, uncapped Brynmor Williams was picked, and played in the first three Tests before being injured in the third.

Both Davies and Edwards started for Wales in the 20–16 victory away to Ireland in the 1978 Five Nations that sealed a record three Triple Crowns in as many years, with Edwards also starting the next week and also dropping a goal in the 16–7 victory against France that sealed Wales their third Grand Slam in eight years. This was Gareth Edwards&#x27; final match for Wales – he had won 53 consecutive caps, never being dropped or injured, and scored 20 tries. Gerald Davies also retired from Wales after a 19–17 defeat in Sydney – tied with Edwards on 20 tries, scored in 46 caps.

In the 1977–78 club season, Davies had a fantastic game against Pontypool where despite only touching the ball four times due to the dominance of the Pooler pack, he scored four tries, with those being Cardiff&#x27;s only points in a 16–11 victory. Cardiff&#x27;s cup run continued to the semi-finals, where they were beaten by Swansea 18–13.

====1980s====
Flanker Stuart Lane, fly-half Gareth Davies, hooker Alan Phillips and scrum-half Terry Holmes from the club were chosen to tour with the Lions to South Africa in 1980, however Davies was the only one to start a Test match. The four went on to help Cardiff finally break their duck and win the WRU Challenge Cup (known as the Schweppes Cup for sponsorship reasons) with a 14–6 victory over Bridgend the following season, with Davies scoring two penalties and tries from centre Neil Hutchings and back-rower Robert Lakin. They repeated the feat in 1982, winning on try count thanks to a score from prop Ian Eidman after a 12–12 draw again against Bridgend, with the other points coming from fly-half David Barry, and also ended a 24-year wait by winning the Unofficial Welsh Championship, thereby completing the club&#x27;s first (and so far only) league and cup double.

In 1983, Terry Holmes was again picked for the Lions, this time alongside second row Bob Norster. Both players were picked for the first team but Holmes was injured in the first Test and Norster in the second, ending their tours.
Cardiff had been knocked in the quarter-finals of the 1982–83 cup by eventual winners Pontypool, but made it up for it with a third triumph in four years, beating Neath 24–19 in the final with tries from flanker Owen Golding and wing Gerald Cordle and 16 points from Gareth Davies. Then, on 12 October 1984, they beat Australia 16–12, thanks to eight points from Gareth Davies along with a penalty try and a score from Adrian Hadley. The same Australian side went on to complete a &quot;Grand Slam&quot; (beating England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland). Australia haven&#x27;t played Cardiff RFC since, leaving the club with a perfect record of six wins from six games against the Wallabies (although Cardiff Blues did lose to Australia 31–3 in 2009). 1985 was very nearly another successful year for the club, beating Neath and Pontypool on their way to the Schweppes Cup final where, despite tries from wing Gerald Cordle and captain Alan Phillips alongside two penalties from Gareth Davies, they fell to an agonising 15–14 defeat to Llanelli. After this, Terry Holmes left the club to play rugby league.

The club bounced back immediately however, beating Newport in the final of 1985–86 cup final 28–21, with Adrian Hadley scoring a hat-trick, Holmes&#x27;s replacement, scrum-half Neil O&#x27;Brien, bagging another try and 12 points coming from the boot of fly-half Gareth Davies in his last game for the club against Welsh opposition before retiring. One year later, Cardiff were part of the first Challenge Cup final to go to extra time, with the scores 9–9 after 80 minutes, all Cardiff&#x27;s points coming from the boot of Davies&#x27;s replacement, Geraint John. Gerald Cordle scored to break the deadlock but the conversion was missed and Swansea scored a converted try soon after, putting them in the lead. But a late drop goal from full-back Mike Rayer won it for the Arms Park side capping one of the most successful periods in the club&#x27;s history, with five Schweppes Cup victories in seven years.

In 1987, the first Rugby World Cup was held in New Zealand. Cardiff props Dai Young, Jeff Whitefoot and Steve Blackmore, wing Adrian Hadley, centre Mark Ring and hooker Alan Phillips all were selected in Wales&#x27;s squad (Young was called up as an injury replacement) which finished third.
Cardiff&#x27;s success began to tail off towards the end of the 1980s, with Adrian Hadley leaving for rugby league in 1988 and Gerald Cordle following in 89, and they could only manage two Cup quarter-finals and one semi-final appearance in the last three years of the decade. However, both Dai Young and Bob Norster were selected for the Lions tour to Australia in 1989, the only Lions team to come from 1–0 down to win the series. Young followed Hadley and Cordle to rugby league shortly after this, while Whitefoot and Norster both retired in 1990.

====League rugby====
In 1990, the unofficial Welsh championship was replaced by a league structure involving promotion and relegation. Cardiff competed in top flight but could only manage a fourth-place finish in 1990–91, and exited the Cup at the quarter-final stage. The season did involve some highlights however, such as beating league runners-up and Cup champions Llanelli 43–0 at the Arms Park and beating league champions Neath 18–4 away in the last game of the season.

1991–92 was possibly the club&#x27;s worst-ever season, beset with disagreements between coach Alan Phillips and manager John Scott. Cardiff crashed out of the Cup before the quarter-final stage and lost at home to Maesteg and Newbridge in the league. Their final league finish was ninth, which would have led to their relegation but the WRU decided mid-season to switch to a 12-team Premiership, therefore saving Cardiff and Maesteg from relegation. Both Scott and Phillips resigned following the season.

Australian Alex Evans took over at Cardiff as coach for the 1992–93 season, bringing in former Arms Park legend Terry Holmes and famous ex-Pontypool front-row member Charlie Faulkner as assistants, and helped a turnaround in the club&#x27;s fortunes, winning their first seven matches of the season and 20 of their first 22 to top the league in the new year. This run came to an end on 23 January; they were knocked out of the Schweppes Cup by St Peter&#x27;s, who were fourth from bottom of Division Four. The Blue and Blacks only lost four league games all season though, but were unlucky to be competing against Llanelli in the league, who won the double and were considered the best club team in the UK after beating Australia 13–9.

In 1993–94 they slid back to fourth in the league but won the SWALEC Cup (renamed from Schweppes Cup for sponsorship reasons) by beating Llanelli, who&#x27;d won the tournament for the last three years running. The score in the final was 15–8, with tries from Mike Rayer and club captain centre Mike Hall and kicks from fly-half Adrian Davies. In 1994–95 Cardiff won the final league title of the amateur era in Wales, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Cup before going down 16–9 to Swansea.

=== Professionalism ===

With professionalism dawned a new era at Cardiff RFC. It allowed them to sign legendary outside-half Jonathan Davies back from rugby league, and another major change was that there would be a European Cup, sponsored by Heineken, containing teams from France, Ireland, Wales, Italy and Romania (England and Scotland did not join for another year). Cardiff progressed to the knock-out stages in November by drawing with Bordeaux-Begles and beating Ulster. December saw the end of the Alex Evans era, as he departed to return home to Australia. Terry Holmes took charge of the club, and in his first full match the Blue and Blacks beat Leinster away to progress to the first Heineken Cup final. The game was played at Cardiff Arms Park in front of a crowd of 21,800, where despite 18 points from the boot of Adrian Davies, Cardiff were beaten 21–18 by Toulouse after extra time.

Cardiff, despite not losing a league game under Holmes, were runners-up on the domestic front as well, finishing level with Neath on points but coming second on try count. After the end of the 95–96 season Peter Thomas invested money into the club allowing them to sign Rob Howley, Dai Young back from rugby league, Leigh Davies, Gwyn Jones and Justin Thomas for the cost of around £2million. Internationals Mark Ring, Steven Blackmore and the half-backs that had started the Heineken Cup final, Andy Moore and Adrian Davies all departed.

Despite all the new signings, Cardiff lost their first three games of the season, and the 1996/97 season was in many respects worse than the year before – Cardiff were knocked out in the Heineken Cup semi-finals by eventual champions Brive, and in the Welsh Premier Division they fell to third, behind champions Pontypridd and Llanelli. However, after Alex Evans returned to head up the coaching team, that season did lead to some silverware, as Cardiff beat Llanelli 36–26 in the semi-final and Swansea 33–26 in the final of the SWALEC Cup. Grzegorz Kacala and Tony Rees, both forwards part of the Brive team that knocked Cardiff out of the Heineken Cup and went on to win it, were signed for 1997/98 along with Wales internationals Steve Williams and Spencer John (Gareth Thomas also arrived in December from Bridgend).

Despite Cardiff&#x27;s difficulties, compounded by those of the national team, Howley and Young were both chosen to go on 1997 Lions tour to South Africa. Howley had to return home early due to injury and neither of the two Cardiff players started a Test match.

In the 1997/98 season, Cardiff were Wales&#x27;s sole representative in the quarter-finals of the Heineken Cup, and were beaten away in rematch of the previous year&#x27;s quarter-final, by Bath, who would go on to win the tournament. However, their domestic cup campaign ended before the quarter-final stage, losing 24–9 to Ebbw Vale, and they finished runners up to Swansea in the League. Following this season, Alex Evans left Cardiff for Australia for the second time and Terry Holmes was put back in charge.

====Rebel season====

Cardiff and Swansea had proposed the formation of a British league, containing the top division English clubs, the two Scottish regional sides (Edinburgh and Glasgow) and four Welsh clubs (seeing as Cardiff had got further than any other Welsh club in every Heineken Cup so far, Swansea were the league champions and they represented the two largest urban areas in Wales, it was assumed two of these clubs would be Cardiff and Swansea).

Both the RFU and the English clubs had agreed to this, but the WRU refused due to an ongoing legal battle with the English clubs over the negotiation of commercial rights (which would lead to the English clubs not participating in the 1998–99 Heineken Cup). Instead, the WRU demanded all top-flight clubs sign 10-year loyalty agreements, where they were guaranteed top-flight status and committed themselves to staying within the Welsh league structure.

Cardiff and Swansea refused to sign these agreements and were expelled from the Welsh Premier Division. The Allied Dunbar Premiership (the English league) teams announced that two teams would have a rest weekend every week allowing them to play friendlies against Cardiff and Swansea. Cardiff&#x27;s first home match of the season was against Saracens, who&#x27;d finished second in the Allied Dunbar Premiership the season before. Cardiff won 40–19 in front of a crowd of 10,021, larger than the entire combined attendance of the Welsh Premier Division that weekend. The club went on to win all their home games, but fell to defeat ten times on their travels.

Although Cardiff and Swansea were both expelled from the Welsh League, they were allowed to continue to compete in the SWALEC Cup against Welsh opposition. Both teams reached the semi-finals, Swansea were to play Cross Keys and Cardiff Llanelli. In the week prior to the game, Cardiff chairman Peter Thomas spoke to the players following a training session, where he emphasised the importance of winning the game, describing it as &quot;the biggest game in the club&#x27;s history&quot;. Cardiff lost 39–10 in a match chief executive Gareth Davies described &quot;The worst performance by a Cardiff side I have ever seen.&quot; Six days later, it was announced Terry Holmes would stand down as coach at the end of the season, and Pontypridd and Wales assistant coach Lyn Howells would take charge on a two-year contract.

Swansea went on to beat Llanelli 37–10 in the cup final, but the rebels were still forced to sign loyalty agreements and return to Welsh domestic setup, now including Edinburgh and Glasgow.

====Lynn Howells====
After the rebel season, Cardiff signed British Lion outside-half Neil Jenkins, as well as Wales internationals second-row Craig Quinnell and flanker Martyn Williams. The start of the 1999–2000 season for Cardiff was hampered by them missing 13 first choice players due to the World Cup, and in late September they fell to a humiliating 60–18 defeat away to Llanelli at Stradey Park. However, despite this poor start and failing to win in the first rounds of the Heineken Cup, they progressed to the Heineken Cup quarter-finals, where they were beaten by Llanelli, and clinched the Welsh/Scottish League title with three games remaining, The season is also notable for a club record victory of 116–0 over Duvnant in the Welsh/Scottish League, and the club going unbeaten at home for almost the whole season, before losing 41–40 to Swansea in their very last game of the season (with the title already sewn up). This was Cardiff&#x27;s first defeat at the Arms Park for over two years, since 13 December 1997, again against Swansea.

During the close season Cardiff lost Leigh Davies to Llanelli but signed South African centre Pieter Muller to replace him. They won their first five Welsh/Scottish League matches, seemingly making certain they would retain their title, especially as Swansea lost three of their first five games. The highlight of the season was in late October, when the Blue and Blacks stunned English Premiership leaders Saracens by defeating them home and away in the Heineken Cup.

The club&#x27;s great form began to stutter as the millennium drew to a close, but it was in January the wheels really came off. After a magnificent 42–16 victory over Ulster, two yellow cards led Cardiff to defeat in Toulouse, meaning they would have to travel to Gloucester in the quarter-finals. A turgid forward battle resulted in a 21–15 defeat for the Blue and Blacks. Two weeks later they then lost to Bridgend, their first home defeat of the season, meaning Swansea pulled ahead in the title race. Another defeat at Ebbw Vale in March condemned them to a trophyless season. 
Following the unsuccessful season Lynn Howells&#x27;s contract was not renewed and Rudy Joubert was appointed director of rugby. Gareth Thomas also left the club along with nine other players, but Rob Appleyard, Matt Allen and Craig Hudson all joined.

For the 2001 Lions tour, four Cardiff players were picked, Rob Howley, Neil Jenkins, Dai Young and Martyn Williams. Young became the first player to tour for the Lions in three different decades. Howley started the first two Tests, with Williams on the bench in all three, and Jenkins coming on to replace Jonny Wilkinson in the second. Howley was dropped for the third, deciding Test.

====Rudy Joubert====
2001–02 was the first year of the Celtic League, containing teams from Wales, Ireland and Scotland. The pool stage would begin in mid-August and continue on for a month. Cardiff were drawn into the smaller, seven-team pool (with four teams going through to the quarter-finals).and started their campaign in unconvincing fashion, winning three games but still being knocked out of the competition on points difference.
In the Heineken Cup, rugby league convert Iestyn Harris, signed for £1million scored a hat-trick on his debut in a 46–7 against Glasgow. Overall the club&#x27;s European form was mediocre however, as despite winning all their home games they failed to register an away win and were eliminated at the pool stage for the first time in their history
On the domestic front, Cardiff again went unbeaten at home until the final game of the season, but again were unable to back it up on the road and finished fourth – their first season out of the top three in a decade.

====Dai Young====
The off season was all change for Cardiff. Rudy Joubert returned home to South Africa and Dai Young became player-coach of the club. Internationals Rob Howley, Neil Jenkins, Craig Quinnell and Jonathan Humphreys all left the club as well. The Welsh/Scottish League was abolished, returning to just nine Welsh teams in the top-flight, and Celtic League games no longer counted towards the domestic league.

In the first two months of the season, Cardiff managed to improve on their Celtic League record from the previous year, winning four out of seven games and progressing to the knockout stage. The quarter final was away to Edinburgh on 30 November and, despite a dreadful first half performance that saw them 19–6 down at the break, a much improved second half performance saw them record a 26–22 win, and go through to the semi-finals.

Their decent start to the season collapsed after that however, with Cardiff failing to score at home for the first-time in 30 years in a 31–0 defeat in the Heineken Cup against Northampton in December. January was a disastrous month for the club too, with a 32–10 thrashing away to Neath in the Celtic League semi-finals, despite the home team making 12 handling errors in Cardiff&#x27;s 22. Two weeks later the club&#x27;s first ever Heineken Cup whitewash was completed with a record 75–25 defeat away to Biarritz.
Domestically, the Blue and Blacks&#x27; final season as a top-tier rugby team was less disappointing. They reached the semi-finals of the Cup, although they capitulated in a similar fashion to their Celtic League semi-final, this time 44–10 away to Llanelli. In the League they finished third, 3 points behind Neath and 11 behind Bridgend.

=== The reorganisation of Welsh Rugby ===
When Rugby Union turned professional in 1995, Welsh rugby was organised in a league pyramid, at the top of which was the Premier Division of twelve teams that had existed for over a century as amateur clubs. However, it became clear over the next few seasons that under professionalism, Welsh Rugby would need to find a new structure.

In 1996 Cardiff Athletic Club had created Cardiff Rugby Ltd to run its professional rugby team, with former player and successful businessman Peter Thomas its first Chairman – a position he would continue to hold for the next 23 years. Cardiff were among the clubs pushing hard for the creation of an Anglo Welsh or British League in the late 1990s, which would put them in frequent conflict with the Welsh Rugby Union. This culminated in the &quot;rebel season&quot; of 1998/99. Thomas would refer to the WRU as &quot;an amateur body living in the dark ages&quot;.

The next few seasons saw multiple plans for the future of Welsh professional rugby put forward. A solution known as the &quot;gang of six&quot; proposal also included Cardiff but was defeated by a vote of the 237 WRU member clubs.

By 2002, after years of financial problems and bitter wrangling, nine clubs remained at the top of the Welsh game. A solution was finally accepted by new WRU CEO David Moffett and it was agreed that five teams would take part in future professional competitions.

Cardiff and Llanelli were to be &quot;standalone&quot; teams, meaning that they would not have to amalgamate with any of the other professional clubs.

After a period of considering different names including &quot;Cardiff 76ers&quot; and &quot;Cardiff Blue and Blacks&quot;, Cardiff settled on &quot;Cardiff Blues&quot;.

===2003–2011: Dai Young years===
====Difficult first seasons====
Dai Young had first been appointed Head Coach at the Arms Park in 2002, after the early departure of South African coach Rudy Joubert. Since his return from rugby league in 1996, Young had played in Cardiff teams that had won the 1999-2000 Welsh-Scottish League title, and had played in the latter stages of the Heineken Cup every season (apart from the 1998/99 &quot;rebel season&quot;) until 2001/02.

But over the two seasons running up to what became known as Welsh rugby&#x27;s &quot;regionalisation&quot;, cut backs had been made at the Arms Park and high-profile players like Gareth Thomas, Jonathan Humphreys, Rob Howley and Neil Jenkins had left. Nevertheless, the first squad as Cardiff Blues could still call on quality Welsh internationals like Rhys Williams, Tom Shanklin, Iestyn Harris and Martyn Williams, who would compete for Wales at the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Popular Canadian forward Dan Baugh and veteran South African centre Pieter Muller also remained at the club.

Aside from these few star names, the first squad under the Cardiff Blues brand was largely made up of lesser known players. Some like Nicky Robinson, his brother Jamie Robinson, Robin Sowden-Taylor and T Rhys Thomas would go on to become key figures at Cardiff. Another notable player was Cardiff fireman and part time rugby player Lee Abdul. After being brought into the squad as cover during the 2003 Rugby World Cup, Abdul would score a record four tries from the wing against the Ospreys before his career was cut short by injury.

Young&#x27;s first season as a coach had been disappointing, and the first season as Cardiff Blues similarly frustrated fans. Increasingly, there were calls for Young to step down and these calls would continue for the next few seasons. However, the Cardiff board would stand by Young.

After the demise of the Celtic Warriors in 2004, the Cardiff Blues region was expanded to include Rhondda Cynon Taff, Merthyr and South Powys. Cardiff Blues would also sign players made redundant by the scrapping of the Warriors, including Gethin Jenkins and Robert Sidoli.

Calls for Young to be removed intensified between November 2004 and January 2005 when the team went eight games without recording a victory. Following the 15–38 loss to Stade Français the players were booed from the field by their own supporters.

Finishing in 9th position in the 2004-05 Celtic League meant that to qualify for the Heineken Cup, Cardiff had to compete in a play-off game against the third place Italian side Arix Viadana. Cardiff Blues won this game 38–9, thus qualifying for the Heineken Cup through what the media described derisively as the cat flap.

====Investment, signings and rebuilding====
In the summer of 2005 funds were made available to sign new players allowing Dai Young to start rebuilding the side. Former New Zealand No. 8 Xavier Rush was among several new signings who gave the squad a much stronger look. Also, a new custom-built training headquarters was established at Hensol in the outskirts of Cardiff.
Results did not improve immediately, with the 37–20 win over Saracens in October 2005 the highlight of a mixed start to the season. However, in a prematch announcement it was confirmed that rugby legend Jonah Lomu had agreed to join on a temporary, &quot;pay as you play&quot; basis as he tried to rebuild his career in time for the 2007 Rugby World Cup.

Lomu was recovering from a kidney transplant, but the signing gave notice of the team&#x27;s renewed ambition. His home debut versus Calvisano was greeted by a capacity crowd and the signing was regarded as a marketing masterstroke. Results improved with wins over the Ospreys and the Newport Gwent Dragons in December.

In January 2006, Cardiff Blues were knocked out of the Heineken Cup after losing 3–21 at home to Perpignan and then losing 3–48 to the relegation threatened Leeds Tykes. The poor run prompted the management to issue &quot;final warnings&quot; to under performing players. As had been the case in the two previous seasons, results improved in the latter months of the season, and in May, 15,327 watched Cardiff Blues beat Leinster 40–31 at the Millennium Stadium. At the time it set a new record for the highest attendance recorded for any Celtic League match.

====New optimism====
More signings, including former New Zealand fullback Ben Blair, alongside some talented academy graduates (notably Bradley Davies and Tom James) further enhanced the quality of the Cardiff Blues squad for the 2006–07 season.

In the Heineken Cup, Cardiff Blues recorded their first win in France, beating Bourgoin 13–5. Encouraged by the strong attendance for the previous season&#x27;s Leinster clash, the Millennium Stadium was again used. This time hosting Leicester Tigers were the opposition and the match attracted a crowd of 26,309 spectators.

In the Celtic League, performances were now much improved. Cardiff finished second after having beaten Leinster at home to go top, only for the Ospreys to win at Borders the next day to claim the title.

Further big signings were added to the Cardiff Blues squad over the summer of 2007 including the return of Gareth Thomas, plus Paul Tito and Jason Spice. However the season was hit by the lengthy absence of important playmaker Nicky Robinson. For the second season in a row, Cardiff Blues finished second in the Celtic League and were eliminated at the pool stage of the Anglo Welsh Cup, despite taking Bath&#x27;s 12 month unbeaten home record.

But in Europe, Cardiff made the quarter-finals of the Heineken Cup after recording two wins over Bristol, a win and a draw with Harlequins and a rousing home victory over Stade Francais at the pool stage. They lost their away quarter-final to Toulouse but returning to the knockout stages of the tournament was seen a major step forward for Dai Young&#x27;s team.

====Anglo Welsh Triumph and Heineken Cup Heartbreak====

By the 2008/09 season, Young&#x27;s squad had a settled look, with few new signings. The team would finish only 6th in the Celtic League, but the club&#x27;s focus on cup competitions would see them win the Anglo-Welsh Cup final 50–12 against Gloucester at Twickenham and make the semi-finals of the Heineken Cup. The Heineken Cup campaign began with a 20–56 bonus point victory away to Calvisano. before another a bonus point 37–24 win against Gloucester at the Millennium Stadium before a crowd of 27,114. The Cardiff Blues then claimed back-to-back victories over Biarritz in December, winning 21–17 at home followed by a 6–10 victory away.

Following the Christmas break, an away 12–16 victory over Gloucester was recorded despite being reduced to 14 men after Tom James was sent-off for a head butt on Gloucester hooker Olivier Azam. In the final round of pool games a bonus point 62–20 win over Calvisano ensured that Cardiff Blues remained the only unbeaten team in the pool stages of the 2008–09 Heineken Cup and claimed the top seed position and a home quarter-final.

The quarter-final against eighth seed and three-times Heineken Cup winners Toulouse was played in the Millennium Stadium with another record attendance of 36,778. A 9–6 victory was recorded in a defence dominated game. The semi-final against Leicester Tigers was also hosted at the Millennium Stadium. Despite being 12–26 down with six minutes remaining, a mighty comeback tied the scores at 26–26 after 80 minutes and forced extra time.

With no further score in the 20 minutes of extra time, the game was forced into an historic penalty shootout. Cardiff were defeated 7–6 following missed kicks by Tom James and Martyn Williams.

====Cardiff City Stadium====
Despite the excitement on the field, off the field a drama had been playing out as the Cardiff Blues board put in place a plan to move from their historic home at Cardiff Arms Park and into the new Cardiff City Stadium. Supporters were alarmed by the supposed rental costs involved in using the new venue as well as moving away from what they regarded as their spiritual home.

More big name signings were made upon the move to the new stadium, including Casey Laulala and Sam Norton-Knight. Norton-Knight had the job of replacing fan favourite outside half Nicky Robinson who, along with his brother Jamie Robinson had chosen to leave Cardiff Blues that summer. However, Norton-Knight would struggle in the 10 shirt and would go down as Dai Young&#x27;s biggest transfer mistake.

In the Celtic League, Cardiff Blues finished fifth in the table, one point away from the playoffs; but secured a place in the 2010–11 Heineken Cup as the second-placed Welsh team. Their Heineken Cup campaign ended after the pool stage, in which they finished second to Toulouse and were not one of the two top second-place teams.

However, this season was the first in which three-second-place teams from the Heineken Cup parachuted into the European Challenge Cup, and the Cardiff Blues were one of three teams to qualify. They crushed Newcastle Falcons 55–22 in the quarterfinals, and edged London Wasps 18–15 both on the road, to reach the final of the competition. The Cardiff Blues became the first Welsh side to win a European trophy after beating Toulon 28–21 in the final on 23 May at Stade Vélodrome in Marseille.

Off the field, the Cardiff Blues had a turnover of £8.7 million and a total employment bill of £5.6 million, with other costs including rental of the new stadium leading them to make a loss of more than £650,000.

Xavier Rush chose to sign a new contract with the club, despite having earlier agreed terms with Ulster. After a &quot;change in his personal circumstances&quot; Rush had decided to remain at the club he described as his &quot;home from home&quot; and a release from his two-year contract was negotiated with Ulster.

Further signings were made. Michael Paterson joined from the Super 14 side the Hurricanes. Press reports in New Zealand at the time of the signing indicated that he had been close to selection for the All-Blacks before choosing to join Cardiff. With the unsuccessful Sam Norton-Knight signing for the Sanyo Wild Knights after not making the grade at outside half, Dan Parks of Glasgow Warriors and a Scottish International was signed.

But the team were beginning to struggle on the field. They were runners up in their Heineken Cup pool but with not enough points to progress in either the Heineken or the Amlin Cups. In the Pro 12 they slipped to sixth place, missing out on a play-off spot.

Lower attendances and a failure to progress in either the Heineken Cup or Magners League meant turnover fell to £7.4m, while added player and coaching costs led to the total employment bill rising to £6.7m. The hefty financial costs attached to playing at Cardiff City Stadium were beginning to mount.

In June 2011, Dai Young would step down in order to join Wasps RFC, bringing an end to nine years as Head Coach and Director of Rugby after a playing career that had begun in 1988.

===2011–2021===
==== Return to the Arms Park ====
Dai Young&#x27;s departure had coincided with financial losses at the Cardiff City Stadium beginning to bite. No new signings were made over the summer and Young&#x27;s assistant coaches, Gareth Baber and Justin Burnell, were made caretaker coaches.

Mid season, long serving Chief Executive Robert Norster also left, to be replaced by Richard Holland. Gavin Henson would be signed on a short-term contract, only for it to be cancelled after an incident on an aircraft returning from a match in Scotland.

Despite some success in the Heineken Cup, beating Racing Metro and achieving a quarter final place, this was a season in which Cardiff Blues managed only 10 league wins. The season was marked by increased awareness of the impact financial pressures were having on the team since the move to Cardiff City Stadium.

The team would lose £3.83m over the 2011/12 season including a seven figure payment to cancel their lease agreement with Cardiff City. It was estimated that the rental agreement and other costs associated with using the stadium had been costing the club around £1 million a season.

Attendances declined further and supporters expressed their dissatisfaction. Two fixtures were moved back to Cardiff Arms Park with some success. The games against Connacht on 10 February 2012 and Ulster on 17 February 2012 achieved capacity crowds and proved popular with supporters.

It was decided that the team would return to Cardiff Arms Park permanently.

====Phil Davies and &quot;The Chief&quot;====
Upon returning to the Arms Park, the Cardiff Blues board decided that an experienced Director of Rugby was needed. Former Scarlets coach Phil Davies was appointed.

Over the next two seasons a number of long serving and high-profile players would retire or leave for other clubs, including Gethin Jenkins, T Rhys Thomas, Casey Laulala Ben Blair Martyn Williams, Xavier Rush, Paul Tito, Maama Molitika Deiniol Jones Jamie Roberts Michael Paterson Tom James Leigh Halfpenny Ceri Sweeney and Bradley Davies.

In Davies&#x27;s first season Cardiff Blues managed only eight wins in the Pro12 and one in the Heineken Cup. They scored a mere 28 tries in the Pro12, the lowest in the league.

Problems with the Arms Park playing surface had also been an issue during the season. Over the following summer, money was invested in a new artificial playing surface.

Davies chose to appoint a diverse range of assistants. These included the 1980s Cardiff hero Mark Ring, Pontypridd icon Dale McIntosh (nicknamed &quot;The Chief&quot;) and young former London Broncos coach Rob Powell. Ring&#x27;s methods were regarded as outdated and Paul John instead came on board as the new backs coach.

After a home loss to Italian club Zebre and a heavy defeat in the Heineken Cup to Exeter, Phil Davies came under severe scrutiny and defence coach Powell promptly left the club. However a victory over Heineken Cup champions Toulon followed by back to back wins over Glasgow briefly eased pressure on Davies. A further series of league defeats proved to be the final straw and Davies finally resigned. The remaining six matches of the season saw caretaker coaches John and McIntosh take the team on a four match unbeaten run which belatedly improved the team&#x27;s league position.

====Stay Strong for Ows====
In June 2014, Cardiff were invited to send a squad to Singapore to compete in the inaugural World Club 10s. Tragically, during a third place play off match, young Cardiff centre Owen Williams suffered a significant injury to his cervical vertebrae and spinal cord. The injury ended Williams&#x27;s rugby career and left him paralysed from the waist down.

Soon after the incident, the social media hashtag #staystrongforows became popularised and Williams received support from around the world. Fundraising efforts managed to secure for Williams a purpose-built house and the Stay Strong For Ows Foundation has continued to raise money and draw attention to the plight of players, who experience life changing injuries.

====Mark Hammett====
For the 2014/15 season, increased financial stability following the return to the Arms Park saw the board once more invest in the playing and coaching staff. 
Jarrad Hoeata and Gareth Anscombe were signed from New Zealand, and off the field, Kiwi coach Mark Hammett arrived after a controversial period coaching the Hurricanes in Super Rugby to become the new Director of Rugby.

Hammett&#x27;s brief period in charge of the club was marked by unusual selections, insistence that players improve their fitness levels and frequent stories in the press about player dissatisfaction with his approach. Hammett would return to New Zealand before the end of the season, with &quot;The Chief&quot; and Paul John once more taking charge as caretaker coaches through to the end of the season.

==== Danny Wilson years ====
After three chaotic seasons, Cardiff were once again looking for a new coach. They now turned to the Bristol Bears assistant Danny Wilson. Wilson had begun his coaching career in the Cardiff Blues academy and had established a strong reputation as a forward specialist, and as Wales U20s head coach. Dale McIntosh - who had applied for the job himself - would leave soon after and be replaced as defence coach by former rugby league man Graham Steadman.

Billy Millard, who had been backs coach under Dai Young, also returned to take up the role of General Manager, a role designed to enable Wilson to focus on hand on coaching over &quot;desk work&quot;.

Wilson found himself having to rebuild a squad that by then was a hotch potch of signings from various coaches. His team initially went on a nine match losing run. But in the second half of the season, Wilson had begun turning the team&#x27;s fortunes around. An impressive away win against Scarlets was the high point in a run of strong performances that suggested Wilson was bringing much needed stability to the club. For his second season, Wilson was able to add strong new signings like Willis Halaholo and Nick Williams as well as replace Paul John with his former Bristol colleague Matt Sherratt.

Wilson also began bringing through a group of highly promising young players from the academy, including Rhun Williams, Seb Davies, Jarrod Evans and Tomos Williams.

====Second season injury crisis====
However, after a promising start to Wilson&#x27;s second season, the team experienced a raft of injuries, beginning with a serious injury to fan favourite Dan Fish which would keep him out of rugby for much of the next three years. Key players including star outside half Anscombe, and much of the club&#x27;s stable of backrow talents were also made unavailable through injury.

Nicky Robinson was called out of retirement as an emergency outside half signing and Sion Bennett also had to be signed as an emergency openside flanker due to the number of injuries in what was considered Cardiff Blues&#x27;s strongest position.

Wilson&#x27;s second season had proven to be disappointing. But as players returned from injury, performances (particularly a thumping 35–17 win over the Ospreys) once again began to improve toward end of season. Wilson looked to add experience to the squad and brought in South African Franco van der Merwe to strengthen the problematic second row position.

====Decision to leave====
Since returning to the Arms Park, the Cardiff Blues board had been negotiating with their main shareholder and landlord the Cardiff Athletic Club, over terms for a new lease at the Arms Park which would allow the board to put in place ambitious plans to redevelop the site and modernise the stadium.

These talks suddenly collapsed in 2017, leading to a sudden reduction in the wage bill at the Arms Park. This led to the recently arrived Van Der Merwe having to find a new club without playing a single match. Billy Millard also departed. Wilson was now having to fulfil Millard&#x27;s former role alongside the Head Coach job, and also had only Sherratt and Richard Hodges alongside him as assistant coaches.

Wilson announced his decision to turn down the opportunity to stay at the Arms Park beyond the 2017/18 season. Initially he was set to join Wasps, ironically alongside Dai Young, but later would announce his decision to join Scotland as their new forwards coach.

====Amlin Cup triumph====
Wilson was a popular coach with the fans and announcement of his departure was greeted with frustration. The pessimistic mood was not helped by a series of poor results in the first half of the season.

In the second half of the season, once again performances turned around. After a run of strong displays in the Pro12, Wilson&#x27;s team all but assured a return to Champions Cup rugby with a bonus point win over Ulster. Meanwhile, a strong campaign in the Challenge Cup, including away wins at Toulouse and Lyon, had seen them into the latter stages of that competition.

After a semi final win over Pau before a packed Arms Park, Cardiff Blues faced Gloucester at the final in Bilbao. A second half comeback and late penalty from Anscombe secured a dramatic win.

====John Mulvihill years ====
The Cardiff Blues board struggled to replace Wilson. Geordan Murphy and Jim Mallinder were both reported to be close to securing the job but in the event did not take the role. The job eventually went to little known Australian coach John Mulvihill, who had spent much of his career coaching in Japan. Mulvihill had been highly recommended by Alec Evans, who had been a highly successful and respected coach at the Arms Park in the 1990s.

Mulvihill assembled a new coaching team of mostly young Welsh coaches recommended to him by the WRU. However his late arrival meant that Mulvihill was unable to make many changes to the playing squad. His first season included some notable wins over the Scarlets and Lyon and a narrow defeat to English giants Saracens, but after a mixed season Cardiff Blues had narrowly failed to remain in the Champions Cup for the following year.

====Project reset====
Off field, The WRU and Welsh professional teams had been negotiating over &quot;Project reset&quot;, which had been intended to improve relations between the teams and the union, as well as change the way Welsh professional rugby was funded. However, these talks led to the sudden imposition of a transfer embargo for much of the 2019/20 season.

The embargo meant that although Mulvihill had secured the high-profile signings of Hallam Amos and Josh Adams for the following season, he was unable to strengthen his forward pack. The embargo also meant that Cardiff Blues could not offer a new contract to breakthrough academy prop Rhys Carre, who would as a result take up an offer from Saracens.

====Changes at boardroom level====
The &quot;Reset&quot; talks also resulted in major changes and a process of modernisation at board level. Peter Thomas stepped down after twenty years as chairman and became Life President while remaining on the board. Thomas would also write off £14 million of loans he&#x27;d made to the club since 1996. Fellow investor Martyn Ryan also wrote off a near seven figure sum. Long term board members Gareth Edwards and Paul Bailey also stepped aside to become Life Patrons.

The new chairman was Managing Partner of Law Firm Hugh James, Alun Jones and experienced business people Andrew Williams and Hayley Parsons would also join the board in the first major changes to the Cardiff Rugby Ltd board since its creation in 1997. Three years later, David Allen would become the board&#x27;s first supporter advisor.

====Covid 19====
Mulvihill&#x27;s second season continued the mixed set of results experienced in his first season. This season was however to be curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. As with every other professional sports team, Cardiff Blues&#x27;s future was now in jeopardy. Planning for future seasons was also curtailed with Mulvihill once again being unable to recruit significantly. As part of negotiations over necessary wage cuts, extended contracts were handed out to squad members.

Mulvihill remained in charge for the following season, which was to be played behind closed doors as the pandemic continued. With the Arms Park used as part of the Dragons Heart emergency hospital, Cardiff played home games at Rodney Parade in Newport as well as two matches back at Cardiff City Stadium.

Two and half years of taking charge of Cardiff Blues through an unprecedented level of off field disruption came to an end for Mulvihill on New Years Day 2021, when he left the club to return to his family in Australia.

===2021–present===
==== Return of Dai Young ====
Young had ended his lengthy stay at Wasps early in 2020. Aware that he was now available, the Cardiff Blues board saw him as an ideal replacement for the departing Mulvihill. He signed an initial short-term contract, followed by a longer term one in April 2021.

Young improved the team&#x27;s fortunes and secured a return to Champions Cup rugby with a defeat of Edinburgh. Like his predecessor, off field issues meant that he was unable to substantially change his squad.

====Rebranding====
On March 1, 2021, following discussions with supporter groups, the club announced a rebranding to Cardiff Rugby, dropping the Blues name and logo from August 1, 2021.

Chief Executive Richard Holland clarified the club&#x27;s identity, explaining that &quot;We are a club with regional responsibilities...There has always been this question mark over what purpose Blues serves. It&#x27;s a suffix, at the end of the day, to Cardiff. This change is reaffirming who we are and being proud of that, while still continuing our regional duties. We believe it&#x27;s the right decision. It&#x27;s an exciting development for us as a company where we embrace the rich history and heritage of ourselves as a club.&quot;

Holland also clarified the position of the Cardiff RFC Premiership team after the rebrand, &quot;Cardiff Rugby is the overarching brand that&#x27;s going to encompass the pro team and the semi-pro team... Cardiff, as the Rags team, will play in the Premiership. There is no change with that.&quot; &quot;

&quot;Rags&quot; was a reference to the traditional nickname for the Cardiff second XV. Following the rebrand, academy manager Gruff Rees became Director of Rugby of the Cardiff RFC XV and began a process Rees described as &quot;full alignment with our academy&quot;.

Chairman Alun Jones further clarified, &quot;What the rebrand does is to re-connect with our history. It&#x27;s about having a clear identity.&quot;

====The Champions Cup &quot;Misfits&quot;====
Cardiff&#x27;s 2021/22 season had begun steadily, with three wins and two close defeats in their first five URC matches. After the autumn internationals, the squad flew to South Africa for matches against the Lions and Stormers.

While there, news of the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa forced the postponement of the matches. The entire squad was forced into quarantine, initially in South Africa and later at airport hotels in England.

Champions Cup matches against French champions Stade Toulousain and English champions Harlequins were now in doubt as Cardiff seemed unlikely to be able to raise a team from the few players who hadn&#x27;t flown to South Africa. A total of 32 players and 10 members of staff had been on the trip and an additional 10 players were either injured or suspended.

Cardiff made the decision to fulfill the fixtures nevertheless. Gruff Rees was put in temporary charge of the team. In addition to the few players that had been left at home, he called upon members of the Cardiff RFC semi pro squad and added two experienced semi pro props from Aberavon RFC.

The team Rees dubbed his &quot;misfits&quot; therefore took the field against Toulouse at the Arms Park with a primary school teacher (Evan Yardley), groundsman (Rowan Jenkins) and recruitment consultant (Alex Everett) amongst the part time players in the 23 man squad. Before a rowdy Arms Park crowd and Channel 4&#x27;s cameras, the team performed admirably and beyond expectations before going down to an Antoine Dupont inspired Toulouse team.

The following week, a similar squad, now with &quot;Rags&quot; Backs Coach Dan Fish - who had only recently retired from professional rugby - at outside half played Harlequins at the Stoop. Tries by academy players Cameron Winnett and Theo Cabango meant that the game was tied at 17 all at half time before Harlequins finally took control of the game away from the &quot;misfits&quot; in the second half. Fish&#x27;s inspired performance was widely praised in the media and sealed his status as a cult hero among Cardiff supporters.

==World Rugby Hall of Fame==
Cardiff are one of only three clubs to have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame. The club&#x27;s innovation of the four three quarter system in 1885 was copied first by Wales and later spread throughout the rugby world, leaving a lasting mark upon the game. The club was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2011.

In addition, eleven former Cardiff players have been inducted into the Hall of Fame:
*Gareth Edwards
*Cliff Morgan
*Frank Hancock
*Jonah Lomu
*Jack Matthews
*Bleddyn Williams
*Keith Rowlands
*Barry John
*Gerald Davies
*Gwyn Nicholls
*Johnny Williams

==Colours==
The traditional Cardiff colours of blue and black were modelled on the colours used by Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge and remained in use by the team until 2006.

At that time, Cardiff Blues changed their playing strip in a decision widely interpreted as a move away from the old Cardiff RFC identity, as for the first time black was not included alongside the blue.

A variety of alternative colour designs have been used as change strips and for jerseys used in European rugby. A blue and gold jersey modelled on one worn by Aberdare RFC and created to raise money for the seriously injured Aberdare born Cardiff player Owen Williams proved popular and was worn in the 2018 European Challenge Cup final win in Bilbao.

Cardiff Rugby have now returned to their traditional colours of Cambridge blue and black, as of 2021.
==Sponsorship==
The following companies have produced kits for the Cardiff Blues or sponsored the side at some point in their history since 2003.
==Home ground==
Cardiff Arms Park has been owned by Cardiff Athletic Club since the 1920s and has long been considered Cardiff Rugby&#x27;s spiritual home. From the late 19th century onward, the Arms Park hosted both a cricket ground and a rugby ground until the southern side of the site was sold to the WRU in 1968. The northern side of the Arms Park then became Cardiff Rugby Club&#x27;s home stadium, while the southern side was to become first the National Stadium and later the Principality Stadium. Cardiff have moved high-profile fixtures &quot;next door&quot; on a number of occasions, such as the 2008–09 Heineken Cup semi-final versus Leicester Tigers.

The Arms Park currently consists of two main stands, both with seated and terraced sections. At the east and west ends of the stadium are blocks of hospitality facilities and office space. The Cardiff Athletic Clubhouse sits next to the South Stand.

For three seasons from the beginning of the 2009–10 season the first team moved to the new Cardiff City Stadium at Leckwith. Financial pressures and supporter dissatisfaction led to several home games being moved back to the Arms Park in the 2011–12 season. On 8 May 2012 it was announced that the 20-year lease with Cardiff City F.C. had been broken by mutual consent following significant financial losses incurred as a result of the move. The club returned to the Arms Park from the 2012/13 season.

For the conclusion of the abbreviated 2019/20 season, and the start of the 2020/21 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the use of Cardiff Arms Park as part of the Dragons Heart emergency hospital, Cardiff played some home games behind closed doors at Rodney Parade in Newport. The club also returned to Cardiff City Stadium for two matches behind closed doors during this period.

In 2022, it was announced that an extension to the lease at Cardiff Arms Park had been signed with Cardiff Rugby&#x27;s main shareholder, Cardiff Athletic Club. Cardiff Athletic Club are exploring options for a refurbishment and redevelopment of the Arms Park stadium and wider site.

==Regional Responsibilities==
===Clubs and Schools===

Cardiff Rugby are responsible for assisting the development of rugby in an area covering five unitary authorities: City of Cardiff, the Vale of Glamorgan, Rhondda Cynon Taff, Merthyr and southern Powys. This area includes 76 community clubs, 61 secondary schools and 320 Primary schools.

Tref-y-Clawdd RFC in Knighton on the border with Shropshire is the most northerly rugby club within this area, but the majority of clubs are based within the population centres of Cardiff and the communities to the immediate north and west of the city. They include Welsh Premiership clubs Cardiff RFC, Merthyr RFC and Pontypridd RFC plus WRU Championship clubs Beddau RFC, Rumney RFC, St.Peters RFC, Cardiff Metropolitan University RFC, Glamorgan Wanderers RFC and Ystrad Rhondda RFC .

The club has close links with Coleg y Cymoedd, Cardiff and Vale College, Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf and Whitchurch High School, with all four playing in the WRU&#x27;s elite Schools and Colleges League. The club has also formed a partnership with the fee paying Christ College Brecon and has formed links with Hartpury College in Gloucestershire.

The area also includes Cardiff Metropolitan University and Cardiff University, both leading University teams competing in BUCS Super Rugby in addition to the University of South Wales. Cardiff Academy players are often also students at these three universities.

===Community Foundation===
Cardiff Rugby Community Foundation are the charitable, not for profit community arm of the organisation. The Foundation delivers a range of programmes aimed at using rugby to make an impact upon communities both socially and economically.

Programmes include schools workshops, player visits, discounted rugby kits and rugby camps.

High performing players from the U18 squad are offered Cardiff academy contracts. In recent years, the club has begun offering academy contracts to players at a younger age in an effort to retain players targeted by private schools and clubs in England.

The current Cardiff Academy manager is Gruff Rees who also serves as Director of Rugby of the Cardiff RFC Welsh Premiership team. Past graduates of the Cardiff academy system include Sam Warburton Jamie Roberts Tomos Williams Leigh Halfpenny Ellis Jenkins Josh Navidi and Rhys Patchell.

<doc id="863114" wikidata="Q1346191" url="?curid=863114" title="Ōtaki, Chiba">
<text>is a town located in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. The town is known for its association with Edo period general Honda Tadakatsu, and its prominent castle. , the town had an estimated population of 8,982 in 3820 households and a population density of 69 persons per km2. The total area of the town is , making it the largest of Chiba Prefecture&#x27;s towns and villages.

== Etymology ==
The name of the town of Ōtaki in the Japanese language is composed of three &quot;kanji&quot; characters: the first, ō (大), meaning &quot;large&quot;, the second, ta (多), meaning &quot;many&quot;, and the third, ki (喜), meaning &quot;happiness&quot;.

==Geography==
Ōtaki is a landlocked town in the center of the Bōsō Peninsula, about 35 kilometers from the prefectural capital at Chiba and 60 to 70 kilometers from central Tokyo. The southwest area of Ōtaki is mountainous, with elevations gradually lowering towards the northeast of the town. Approximately 70% of Ōtaki is covered by forest. The Isumi River flows through the town to the northeast, and in the western part of the town the Yōrō River flows to the north. The town extends for about 12 kilometers east to west by about 19 kilometers north to south.

===Climate===
Ōtaki has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Ōtaki is 14.9 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1828 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 25.5 °C, and lowest in January, at around 5.3 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Ōtaki has been decreasing over the past 70 years and is now less than it was a century ago.

==History==
===Early history===
Ōtaki was settled in prehistoric times, as evidenced by the Jōmon period remains in Oikawa. In the Asuka period the Ōtaki region became part of Kazusa Province at the western end of the Tōkaidō region, which was formed as a result of the Taika Reform of 654. In the Sengoku period Ōtaki was established as a castle town, which successively controlled by different regional clans, most notably the Takeda clan and the Toki clan. The Ōtaki region ultimately came under the control of the powerful Awa Province-based Satomi clan in 1544.

===Edo Period===
In 1590 Tokugawa Ieyasu took control of all of Kazusa Province. Ieyasu granted Ōtaki to his famed general Honda Tadakatsu, and established the Ōtaki Domain as a 100,000 &quot;koku&quot; feudal domain. Tadakatsu built Ōtaki Castle on the site of the earlier castle and laid out a large-scale castle town. Honda Tadakatsu&#x27;s placement at Ōtaki was a strong buffer against the military power of the Satomi clan to the south. The ownership of the castle changed hands many times after Honda Tadakatsu&#x27;s control, but from 1703 the Matsudaira clan held the castle for nine generations. Despite the Matsudaira clan&#x27;s control of the castle, the majority of the Ōtaki region was controlled as &quot;tenryō&quot; territory by &quot;hatamoto&quot; in direct service to the Tokugawa shogunate. In 1609 a Spanish galleon, the &quot;San Francisco&quot;, ran aground near Ōtaki . The survivors were housed in Ōtaki Castle, and later, the sailors were given a ship by the shogunate to return to Mexico. One of the survivors was Governor General of the Philippines Rodrigo de Vivero, who was subsequently granted an audience with &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyasu.

===Modern Period===
After the Meiji Restoration the administrative structure of the region changed frequently. Ōtaki was successively part of Ōtaki Prefecture, then Kisarazu Prefecture, before becoming part of the present-day Chiba Prefecture. On April 1, 1889, under the same administrative reforms, the four villages of Oikawa, Nishihata, Fusamoto, Kamitaki and the town of Ōtaki were formed. The five were brought together to become present-day town of Ōtaki on October 5, 1954.

==Government==

Ōtaki has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 12 members. Ōtaki, together with the city of Katsuura, contributes one member to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Chiba 11th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The economy of Ōtaki was based largely on rice production, forestry, and traditional charcoal production, but after World War II all three industries have declined. The town produces shiitake mushrooms and bamboo shoots as special agricultural products. Tourism has increased as a result of visits to Ōtaki Castle, the Ōtaki Prefectural Forest, and various scenic spots. Golf courses were developed in Ōtaki, but have caused problems with flooding and deforestation.

The village of Kuniyoshi was established within Isumi District, Chiba with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It was raised to town status on September 22, 1894. The town of Isumi was established on April 29, 1955 from the merger of Kuniyoshi Town with the neighboring villages of Nakagawa and Chimachi.

===Surrounding municipalities===
Chiba Prefecture
*Isumi (to the west and north)
*Katsuura (to the south)

===Climate===
Onjuku has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Onjuku is 15.1 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1904 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 25.5 °C, and lowest in January, at around 5.8 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Onjuku has been gradually decreasing over the past 70 years.

==History==

===Early history===
Onjuku is part of ancient Kazusa Province. The pines and sand of Ajiro Bay in Onjuku were referenced in a poem by Hōjō Tokiyori (1227–1263), a Kamakura-period administrator.

===Edo Period===
Onjuku, from the Muromachi to the Edo period, was divided into a complex mixture of administrative areas. Much of the town was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory ruled by various &quot;hatamoto&quot; on behalf of the Shōgun. The town was typically associated with administrators from the Ōtaki and Iwatsuki domains. In the Edo period a prominent “rokusai’ichi” (六斎市) market, or open-air market held on fixed days six times a month, developed in Onjuku.

===Landing of Rodrigo de Vivero===
In 1609 a Spanish galleon, the &quot;San Francisco&quot;, ran aground near Onjuku. The captain and 300 survivors were cared for by the town, and later, the sailors were given a ship by the Tokugawa shogunate to return to Mexico. One of the survivors was Governor General of the Philippines Rodrigo de Vivero, who was subsequently granted an audience with &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyasu. In 1928 a tower was built in Onjuku to commemorate the landing of Rodrigo and friendly relations between Mexico, Spain, and Japan. It has since been designated a Prefectural Historic Monument (), and is surrounded by an extensive garden complex.

===Current administration===
The village of Onjuku was created on April 1, 1889, with the early Meiji period establishment of the municipalities system, and was elevated to town status on April 1, 1914. The town expanded through annexation of areas of the neighboring villages of Fuse and Namihana on March 1, 1955.

==Government==
Onjuku has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 12 members. Onjuku, together with the city of Isumi contributes one member to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Chiba 11th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The economy of Onjuku is dominated by summer tourism and commercial fishing; agriculture plays a relatively small role in the economy compared to nearby municipalities. Commercial coastal and off-shore fishing operations are active, with squid and bonito being the most important catches. Ama, or traditional women divers, gather abalone, turban shell (&quot;sazae&quot;), and spiny lobster, all important parts of the traditional Japanese diet.

The sandy beaches of Onjuku are the representative swimming areas of the Sotobōsō Coast and attract numerous tourists during the summer months. Tourism in the town began in the Meiji period, and development of the tourism industry continues. Numerous guests houses, &quot;ryokan&quot; (traditional Japanese inns), and hotels have developed in the area.

==Education==
Onjuku has one public elementary school and one public middle school operated by the town government. The town also has one private elementary school and one private high school.

==Sports==
Due to the infrastructure and sandy beach with good surf conditions, the locality holds the yearly national surf carnival of the Japan Lifesaving Association, in which surf lifesavers gather from all clubs over the country. In 2013, the worldwide 2013 International Surf Rescue Challenge is held here.

==History==

===Early history===

Isumi District was one of the ancient districts of Kazusa Province. The district was named after the Isumi River, which runs from the mountainous areas of Katsuura to the south of Kujūkuri Beach on the Pacific Ocean. The district is mentioned in Nara-period chronicles under various names, usually as . The &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; records the area as , and the &quot;Kojiki&quot; as . In the ancient period the district bordered Mōda and Unakami districts to the west, and Habu and Nagara districts to the north. In the Heian period (794–1185) the district was divided into two shōen estates; one to the north, and one to the south. Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147–1199) drew soldiers from both shōen estates with the assistance of the local warlord Kazusa Hirotsune (?–1184). Yoritomo went on to found the Kamakura Shogunate. Manki Castle and Ōtaki Castle were built in this period. Kuniyoshi, once a village and now part of Isumi City, became a noted market town in this period, and a &quot;rokusai-ichi&quot;, or market held six days of the month, is held to this day. By the end of the Sengoku period (1467–1573) the district had been variously controlled by the Toki, Hōjō, and Satomi clans. The Satomi ceded the area to Oda Nobunaga (1534–1582) in 1590.

===Edo period===

The name of Isumi District was standardized to its present &quot;kanji&quot; and pronunciation by the Edo period. Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543–1616), as part of the wider unification of Japan, entered the Kantō region in 1590 and awarded the Isumi District to a trusted general Honda Tadakatsu (1548–1610). Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the minor feudal domain of Ōtaki Domain, controlled by Honda Tadakatsu from Ōtaki Castle, controlled 18 villages within the district, with another 57 villages under the control of other domains (including one village belonging to Nitta Domain in Tosa Province). The remaining 108 villages were &quot;tenryō&quot; under direct control of the central government and administered by various hatamoto, or samurai in the direct service of the Tokugawa shogunate. The Edo period was marked by the extensive development of rice paddy land in the district.

===Modern period===

In the post Meiji Restoration cadastral reform, the area came under the control of Chiba Prefecture and on April 1, 1889, was divided into two towns (Ōtaki and Asahi) and 21 villages. Katsuura was elevated to town status on March 12, 1890, Kuniyoshi (future Chōjamachi) on September 22, 1893, Ōhara on December 2, 1899, Onjuku on April 1, 1914, and Okitsu on January 1, 1921. The town of Isumi was created on April 29, 1954, through the merger of Chōjamachi with neighboring villages, and the town of Taitō was created in December of the same year. Katsuura was elevated to city status on October 1, 1958. Taitō and Chōjamachi merged to form the town of Misaki on August 1, 1961, leaving the district with five towns.

On December 5, 2005, the towns of Isumi, Misaki and Ōhara merged to form the city of Isumi, leave the district with only two remaining towns.

<text>Dawei (, ; , ; , RTGS: &quot;Thawai&quot;, ; formerly known as Tavoy) is a city in south-eastern Myanmar and is the capital of the Tanintharyi Region, formerly known as the Tenasserim Division, on the eastern bank of the Dawei River. The city is about southeast of Yangon. Its population (2014 estimate) is 146,964. Dawei is a port at the head of the Dawei River estuary, . from the Andaman Sea. As a result, the city is prone to flooding during the monsoon season. Dawei People is also the name of one of Myanmar&#x27;s 135 ethnic minorities.

==Etymology==
&quot;Dawei&quot; derives from the Mon language term &quot;hawai&quot; (; ), which means &#x27;to sit cross-legged&#x27;, in reference to the Buddha&#x27;s sitting posture on the palin (throne).

==History==
The area around the Dawei River estuary has been inhabited for centuries by Dawei, Mon, Kayin, and Thai mariners.

As the ancient site, Sagara City, old Dawei, which is approximately 6 miles north of the present city, has so many traces of Pyu culture, it was recognized as one of the province capitals in the ancient Pyu era. The evidence of burial urns, beads, coins and other features of Pyu culture have been excavated in the area by the Department of Archaeology and National Museum, Myanmar.

From the 11th to the 13th centuries, Dawei was part of the Pagan Empire. From 1287 to 1564, Dawei became part of the Sukhothai Kingdom and its successor, the Ayutthaya Kingdom (Siam). From 1564 to 1594, Dawei was part of the Toungoo Kingdom of Burma. Siam temporarily regained the city between 1594 and 1614. From 1614 to the 1740s, Dawei was the southernmost city under Burmese authority and was defended by a Burmese garrison. In the late 1740s, during the Burmese civil war of 1740–1757, Dawei, along with the northern Tenasserim coast, was taken over by Siam. Burma regained the city in 1760 and extended its control over the entire Tenasserim coast, in 1765. The Tenasserim coast was ceded to the British after the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–1826).

After independence in 1948, the city became part of the Tenasserim Division, which also included today&#x27;s Mon State. In 1974, Mon State was carved out of Tenasserim and Dawei became the capital of the truncated division. In 1989, the city&#x27;s English name was changed from Tavoy to Dawei, and Tenasserim became Tanintharyi.

==Climate==
Dawei features an extreme tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Am&quot;), similar to Sittwe further north-west. There is a substantial dry season from November to March, but in the wet season the influence of local mountains causes Dawei to receive as much as precipitation per month. Apart from the Chocó region of Colombia, and the area around Mount Cameroon in Africa, it is possibly the wettest lowland tropical region in the world.

==Transport==
Only recently was Dawei connected to the rest of Myanmar by road and rail. A transnational highway and a railway line across the Tenasserim Hills connecting Dawei and Bangkok are planned if a proposed deep water port project goes ahead. This port could significantly reduce Singapore-bound traffic when completed.

===Dawei Airport===

The airport serves as the domestic airport for the city of Dawei and the neighbouring towns. The government plans to upgrade the airport to serve as a hub for tourism.

===Dawei Railway Station===

It is the southernmost station and terminus in Myanmar. However the railway was partly constructed for a further 40 km approximately to the south towards Min Dat bridge and south Myanmar. Work ceased on this line in about 2012 but several partly constructed sections with bridges over rivers are visible on Google Earth.

==Economy==
There are plans to construct a deep water port in Dawei. In November 2010, the Myanmar Port Authority signed a US$8.6 billion deal with Italian-Thai Development to develop the seaport at Dawei. The Dawei Special Economic Zone would become Myanmar&#x27;s first special economic zone (SEZ), which includes plans to develop a industrial estate, with sea, land (railway and road) infrastructure links to Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, as well as a gas pipeline to Thailand&#x27;s Kanchanaburi Province and commercial and residential developments.

The development of the SEZ has been linked to land confiscations and land grabs from farmers of upwards of (direct) and , potentially displacing 500,000 Dawei natives. The project has been opposed by a significant portion of the local ethnic population.

Dawei longyis (sarong) are one of the area&#x27;s well-known products. The area produces rubber, dried fish, and teakwood. It also produces cashew nuts and betel nuts and exports them through local traders to China, India, and Thailand. Dawei is also known for its variety of tropical fruits such as pineapples, a variety of mangoes, mangosteens, and durian. There is one fruit called &quot;zin thi&quot; (in Dawei language), which can only be found in Dawei and surrounding areas.

<text>was a town located in Awa District, Chiba Prefecture, Japan.

== Population ==
As of October 1, 2004, the town had an estimated population of 6,027 and a density of 353 persons per km2. The total area was 17.07 km2.

==Geography==
Shirahama was located at very southern end of Chiba Prefecture, at the southern extremity of Bōsō Peninsula, facing the Pacific Ocean. The town had a temperate maritime climate with hot, humid summers and mild, cool winters.

==History==
Shirahama Village was created on April 1, 1889, within Asai District, which became part of Awa District from April 1, 1897. It became a town on April 1, 1933.

==History==
Awa District was one of the ancient districts of Kazusa Province, and originally covered all of the southern end of Bōsō Peninsula. In 718, it was separated from Kazusa to become the separate province of Awa, which existed to the Meiji Restoration of 1868.

In the cadastral reforms of the early Meiji period, Awa Province was divided into four modern districts in 1868: , , and (formerly called Heguri). At the time of its formation, Awa District consisted of 93 hamlets, divided evenly between Tateyama Domain and Nagao Domain. These were consolidated into two towns (Tateyama and Hōjō, which merged with Tateyama in 1993) and nine villages. In 1897, three districts of Asai, Hei and Nagasa were absorbed into Awa District, at which time Awa District expanded to seven towns and 37 villages. Subsequently, Awa District has been gradually reduced in size through the formation of cities, and at present consists only of the town of Kyonan.

<text>A SAMU Social is a municipal humanitarian emergency service in several cities in France and worldwide whose purpose is to provide care and medical ambulatory aid and nursing to homeless people and people in social distress. This is partially accomplished via mobile units which distribute food, hot drinks, blankets, etc.
Its nickname has been not well accepted because it bears confusion with a SAMU (Service d&#x27;Aide Médicale Urgente), which is an ambulance service.

The SAMU Social de Paris lists the following goals as its mission:
* At night: mobile assistance teams
* 24-hour management of the 1-1-5 emergency telephone number for Homeless people alert.
* 24-hour emergency shelters with nursing care
* During the day: reception at the &quot;Solidarity-Insertion-Centre&quot;
* Increase the scientific knowledge of impoverished populations, from precarious situations to total exclusion, by identifying and analysing the sanitary and social problematic
* Observing the phenomenon of wanderings, by establishing a typology of populations, tracking their paths and monitoring the social indicators

The name comes from SAMU ( &quot;service d&#x27;aide médicale urgente&quot;, &quot;emergency medical assistance service&quot;) which in reality and by law is the French Medical Regulation of Emergencies Center based in Hospitals and which role is to regulate the medical Emergency Fluxes of demands Medicosanitary Regulation of Emergencies of a Public Health Integrated Emergency Medical System (IEMS); the acronym has become a kind of popular informal word, synonym to emergency action because it is the mark labelling Mobile Intensive Care Unit Ambulances in France. A new origin was proposed to this acronym as used in this appellation : &quot; service ambulatoire d&#x27;urgences &quot; because conflictual with the SAMU that is woldwild an official Puvblic Service appellation and because it is neither a Medical Emergency Service nor a true &quot;Social Emergency Service&quot;.

On July 19, 2011, Xavier Emmanuelli resigned from the presidency following the State&#x27;s announcement of drastic reductions in the resources allocated to emergency accommodation. However, he will continue his action at the Samu social International. This decision will be followed by a strike by social emergency professionals on August 2, 2011.

<doc id="863158" wikidata="Q6651674" url="?curid=863158" title="Little River (Tennessee)">
<text>Little River is a river in Tennessee which drains a area containing some of the most spectacular scenery in the southeastern United States. The first of the river are located within the borders of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. For the remaining , the Little flows out of the mountains through Blount County to join the Tennessee River at Fort Loudon Lake in Knox County.

==History, course and geology==
Historically, the Little River lay in a region of contact between the Overhill Cherokee and the American colonies, later states, during the Cherokee–American wars that emerged from combined pressures of colonies&#x27; demands for settlement beyond the Proclamation Line of 1763 and loss of land by the Cherokee in their traditional homelands. In 1785, the self-proclaimed State of Franklin negotiated the Treaty of Dumplin Creek, which set a boundary with the Cherokee leader Aucoo of Chota and other Cherokee town chiefs whom Aucoo spoke on behalf of, at the ridge separating the Little River and Tennessee basins. In 1786, Houston&#x27;s Station on the Little River was the site of assembly for a volunteer cavalry force, who, under the leadership of Governor John Sevier, a chief signatory of the Dumplin Creek treaty, rode to destroy three Cherokee towns in the vicinity of the Hiwassee River in retaliation for a Cherokee attack on a settler&#x27;s house that killed two people north of the Holston River near present-day Knox County, beyond the boundary set by the Dumplin Creek treaty. Deep within Cherokee territory, the detachment withdrew after hearing rumors of a superior force approaching, perhaps organized by John Watts.

Further conflict between white settlers and the Cherokee, as well as with the Muscogee, precipitated a second treaty between the State of Franklin and the Cherokee, this time coerced by the State. The State&#x27;s representatives claimed at a meeting with Cherokee chief Old Tassel on July 31, 1786 that the state of North Carolina had &quot;sold us [the State of Franklin] all the country on the north side of Tennessee and Holston&quot;. Attempting to pacify the angry commissioners, Old Tassel replied that he would consult Cherokee leadership and the United States&#x27; Congress of the Confederation about the land claims, and emphasized that he did not have authority over the Cherokee who had allegedly murdered settlers in Kentucky. Confronting Old Tassel and Hanging Maw less than a week later at Coytoy, a Cherokee village on the mouth of the Holston River, the commissioners reiterated their demands, threatening retaliation against any attack of the Cherokee on the settlers and blaming the Cherokee for the deaths of Colonel John Donelson and Colonel William Christian. The Cherokee protested that William Christian, who was well regarded by them, had been killed after crossing the Ohio River by non-Cherokee, and that they had never heard of the Government of North Carolina selling land to the Republic of Franklin and had spoken with congressional representatives during the fall of 1785 who had given no information about the impending land claim. Nevertheless, desiring peace, Old Tassel and Hanging Maw signed their assent to the claim of the settlers to an island at the mouth of the Holston River, whose head would form a new boundary that extended again to the ridge between the Little River, the Tennessee River and the Holston River, but would now also extend north of the Tennessee River. They agreed to hand over to the settlers&#x27; authorities anyone who was accused of murdering one of the settlers.

The 1791 Treaty of Holston established the northeastern border of the Cherokee Nation with the United States of America at the ridge separating the Little River and Tennessee basins. In late 1791, Cherokee emissaries traveled to Philadelphia, America&#x27;s then-capital, in part to request that settlers who had intruded south of the ridge be removed. Henry Knox, the secretary of war, supported this request, and also recommended moving troops from Georgia to the ridge to enforce the treaty&#x27;s provisions. The 1791 border was reaffirmed in 1795 by a treaty signed in Philadelphia.

===Source to Elkmont===
Little River rises in Sevier County inside the national park on the north slope of Kuwohi, the highest point in Tennessee. Kuwohi is located directly on the Tennessee-North Carolina state line, which parallels the Appalachian Trail along the crest of the Smokies. Approximately one mile below its source, Little River absorbs several smaller streams at an area known as &quot;Three Forks&quot;, where the river gains considerable strength. From here, the river is paralleled by the well-maintained Little River Trail which leads into Elkmont. Located in a valley created by Little River&#x27;s confluence with Jakes Creek, Elkmont was originally a logging camp for the Little River Lumber Company and a station on the Little River Railroad. In the 1920s a series of cabins and inholdings, including the Wonderland Hotel, were leased to private citizens. The leases remained intact until 2001, when the last lease expired.

The road improves at Elkmont to become one which is easily suitable for most vehicles. This section of the river is navigable by expert kayak and canoe enthusiasts and offers excellent fishing for native brook trout.

===Elkmont to the Townsend Y===

From just below Elkmont, the Little River runs parallel to State Route 73, also known as Little River Gorge Road, which connects the two major Tennessee entrances to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park: those in Gatlinburg and Townsend. The stream, like the road that follows it, is quite sinuous. The road is built on the bed of the Little River Railroad that was used for logging purposes prior to the establishment of the park.

Along the course of Little River are several small waterfalls which feed into the river, which are especially strong during wet weather. One waterfall, Meigs Falls, is visible from the road and is provided with a parking turnout. Additionally, there are parking turnouts for trails leading to numerous places. About midway between Gatlinburg and Townsend, Little River enters a relatively flat area known as Metcalf Bottoms, which developed along an oasis of soft phyllite amidst the more predominant sandstone. The park service has established a picnic area at Metcalf Bottoms, providing an attractive area for summer picnics and wading.

Just past Metcalf Bottoms, Little River becomes more rapid and volatile as it slices through Little River Gorge, a narrow valley between Round Top Mountain and Curry She Mountain. Among the gorge&#x27;s more notable landmarks is an area known as &quot;The Sinks.&quot; The Sinks is where the river flows over a ten-foot (three meters) waterfall into a large pool, and then seems to disappear for a small distance. (Unlike streams in a limestone area, which may actually &quot;sink&quot; for a considerable distance, this is more a question of appearance than of the stream truly &quot;sinking&quot;, which is not feasible in this area of ancient Precambrian metamorphic rock.) Below the Sinks, Little River is navigable in high water with a canoe or kayak.

Continuing to follow TN 73 the stream crosses into Blount County en route to its confluence with Middle Prong of Little River at an area known as the &quot;Townsend Y&quot;.

===The Middle Prong===
The Middle Prong of Little River drains the watershed between Miry Ridge and Defeat Ridge, both of which descend from the crest of the Smokies. The Middle Prong is formed by the confluence of Lynn Camp Prong and Thunderhead Prong at the former logging town of Tremont, where it has cut a deep gorge. From here, the river continues northward, absorbing Spruce Flats Branch and several smaller streams before steadying in a relatively flat area known as Walker Valley. The Middle Prong is shadowed by the old roadbed of the Little River Railroad for almost all of its nine-mile (14 km) length.

Laurel Creek, which drains the White Oak Sink area, joins the West Prong, which drains the area beneath Spence Field. The West Prong then joins the Middle Prong a mile east of the Townsend Wye at the junction of Tremont Road and Laurel Creek Road.

Only the stream below the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont is navigable by kayak in high water. Fishing along Middle Prong is considered excellent.

===Townsend Wye to Walland===
The Townsend &#x27;Y&#x27; is created by the confluence of Little River (flowing from the east) and Middle Prong of Little River (flowing from the west), which create a powerful stream that flows north. The Townsend Y is a popular swimming hole in the summer and is generally packed with cars and people. Many tubers use the Y as the jumping off point for a mile long float down the river. Just past the Y, Little River exits the Great Smoky Mountains National Park into Tuckaleechee Cove and Townsend. From this point forward, with the exception of two old mill dams, the Little River can be navigated in a kayak at normal water levels. Tubers typically travel from the Townsend Y to the vicinity of the first mill dam (above the Highway 321 bridge). This portion of the river has intermittent rapids and swimming areas, as well as large rocks in the middle of the river (such as Gallaher Rock near Cedar Bluff Way) that are suitable to rest at.

In Townsend, the river is paralleled by U.S. Highway 321. Townsend is situated in Tuckaleechee Cove, a Paleozoic limestone area noted by the presence of Tuckaleechee Caverns, a large cave operated as a tourist attraction during the tourist season, roughly defined as April to October. The drainage from the cave enters the Little River just below Townsend.

Townsend is laid out in the cove along the Little River valley. Three decades ago it was largely undeveloped, with a few small &quot;mom and pop&quot; style hotels and restaurants; now major chains have built larger lodging facilities, although not yet comparable to Gatlinburg or Pigeon Forge. Of interest are the Little River Railroad and Lumber Company Museum and the Greenway that parallels U.S 321. The Townsend area was once the site of many scenic swinging bridges over Little River; liability concerns have caused most of these to be dismantled in recent years. One bridge does remain, however, at the northern end of Townsend in an area known as Kinzel Springs. A second swinging bridge is located near the LRRR&amp;LC Museum and connects to Dark Island.

Little River continues to flow north through Miller Cove into the small community of Walland, which is at the current time the eastern terminus of the Chilhowee section of Foothills Parkway, a national parkway.

===Walland to Fort Loudon Lake===

Beyond Walland, Little River cuts a wide gap in Chilhowee Mountain before descending into the Maryville-Alcoa flatlands. As it steadies, the river no longer displays the extreme clarity and attractive rocky bottom of its upper reaches and resembles a more typical stream in a moderately rolling, somewhat rural area. From the old mill dam at the Peery&#x27;s Mill site north of Walland to the river&#x27;s mouth at Ft. Loudoun Lake (approximately 19 miles), the river is generally navigable with a canoe, with the exception of a dangerous low-head dam at the Rockford Manufacturing Company in Rockford. Little River flows through farmland, under U.S. Highway 411, and passes through the cities of Maryville and Alcoa before reaching Rockford.

Approximately 85,000 residents of these communities draw drinking water from the river. Three creeks— Pistol Creek, Short Creek and Crooked Creek— join Little River in this area. These three creeks are considered &quot;impaired&quot;, contributing to a designation of Little River as &quot;threatened&quot; by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. Little River flows into a surprisingly large (given the size of the stream) embayment of the Fort Loudon Lake impoundment of the Tennessee River along U.S. Highway 129, where a small marina is located. Little River forms the line between Blount County and Knox County for the last few miles of its course.

<text>The da Vinci Project was a privately funded, volunteer-staffed attempt to launch a reusable crewed sub-orbital spacecraft. It was formed in 1996 specifically to be a contender for the Ansari X Prize for the first non-governmental reusable crewed spacecraft. The project was based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and led by Brian Feeney.

The original da Vinci Project is no longer operating. A documentary was filmed throughout much of the project&#x27;s life from 2000 through post-X Prize roundup footage in 2008. The documentary accumulated some 1000 hours or so of footage. It was a private undertaking by Michel Jones of Riverstone Productions, Toronto, and as of early 2009 was still in a preliminary stage of editing and completion.

The project last participated in the X Prize Cup 2005, displaying a mock-up of its Wild Fire MK Vl spacecraft.

==Spacecraft design==
The project&#x27;s design was a rocket-powered spacecraft to be air-launched from a helium balloon at an altitude of about 21 km (65,000 ft). The project scope included design and construction of both the spacecraft and the launching balloon. The chosen design can be described as a crewed rockoon.

==History and status==
The project was established in 1996. It is named after Leonardo da Vinci, who, among innumerable other inventions, was the first recorded person to design an aircraft. The project was staffed entirely by volunteers.

The project unveiled a mockup of their spacecraft, Wild Fire, on August 5, 2004 at a hangar at Downsview Airport in Toronto. At this point, it was considered a contender for the Ansari X Prize, and Tier One had just given notice of their planned competitive flights. When announcing the unveiling, the da Vinci Project also appealed for funds to fly Wild Fire. An agreement was reached with GoldenPalace.com, and the project subsequently gave the required 60-day notice that they would make the Ansari X Prize competitive flights. GoldenPalace.com, known for its marketing gimmicks, was to place a soccer ball kicked out of the stadium by David Beckham during the 2004 Euro World Cup inside the space craft.

The da Vinci Project initially announced that it would fly first on October 2, 2004, launching from Kindersley, Saskatchewan. This was only three days after the first expected X Prize flight, by Scaled Composites, on September 29, 2004. However, on September 23, 2004 the da Vinci project announced that they would not be ready. Scaled Composites won the X Prize on October 4, 2004.

==Hardware==

The rocket and support equipment was mostly COTS components with a hybrid propulsion system using nitrous oxide and a spin cast paraffin fuel engine in a re-loadable and expendable cardboard cartridge. The most notable development problem was finding a practical low cost solution to the thermal contraction of the liquid paraffin fuel when it cooled and solidified inside the cartridge inner casing.
The capsule used two automotive racing seats and aviation BRS parachute systems and was designed and modeled with finite element software. The nozzle was carbon fiber exterior with a tough, thermally insulating inner coating. The combustion chamber was metallic, although a wound carbon fiber exterior was planned but never completed. The planned tracking system used a four car team with networked laptop computers using a hybrid cellular and shortwave radio with the capability of automatically predicting the landing spot so a support team could converge on the landing spot hand prior to landing. The highest forces were predicted to be at re-entry, peaking at approximately at up to 6G. Development, construction and testing continued in earnest until the second flight of the X Prize on October 4, 2004.

==Structure==
The project had a small group of core area leaders and relied heavily on volunteer efforts. It followed a variety of business models including share ownership partners, technology partnerships, employee style volunteering, integrator as well as technology/IP aggregator. Many of the expensive components were donated by businesses in exchange for recognition on the website homepage, since removed.

<doc id="863165" wikidata="Q2630687" url="?curid=863165" title="Leasehold estate">
<text>A leasehold estate is an ownership of a temporary right to hold land or property in which a lessee or a tenant has rights of real property by some form of title from a lessor or landlord. Although a tenant does hold rights to real property, a leasehold estate is typically considered personal property.

Leasehold is a form of land tenure or property tenure where one party buys the right to occupy land or a building for a given time. As a lease is a legal estate, leasehold estate can be bought and sold on the open market. A leasehold thus differs from a freehold or fee simple where the ownership of a property is purchased outright and after that held for an indeterminate length of time, and also differs from a tenancy where a property is let (rented) periodically such as weekly or monthly.

Terminology and types of leasehold vary from country to country. Sometimes, but not always, a residential tenancy under a lease agreement is colloquially known as renting. The leaseholder can remain in occupation for a fixed period, measured in months or years. Terms of the agreement are contained in a lease, which has elements of contract and property law intertwined.

== History ==

Laws governing landlord–tenant relationships can be found as far back as the Code of Hammurabi. However, the common law of the landlord-tenant relationship evolved in England during the Middle Ages. That law still retains many archaic terms and principles pertinent to a feudal social order and an agrarian economy, where land was the primary economic asset and ownership of land was the primary source of rank and status.

The tenancy was essential to the feudal hierarchy after the statute &quot;Quia Emptores&quot; prohibited subinfeudation (the creation of new feudal estates by existing feudal landholders) in the late 13th century; a lord would own land, and the tenants became vassals. Leasehold estates can still be Crown land today. For example, in the Australian Capital Territory, all private land &quot;ownerships&quot; are leaseholds of Crown land.

==Terminology==
A distinction may be made between a residential tenancy, offering a person a place to live, and a business tenancy, where premises are occupied for business purposes. There may be different statutory provisions for residential and business tenancies, for example in the UK&#x27;s Landlord and Tenant Act 1954, Part I (now largely superseded) dealt with residential tenancies and Part II dealt with business tenancies.

=== Fixed-term tenancy or tenancy for years ===
A &quot;fixed-term tenancy&quot; or tenancy for years lasts for some fixed period of time. Despite the name, such a tenancy can last for any period of timeeven a tenancy for one week would be called a tenancy for years. In common law, the duration did not need to be certain, but could be conditioned upon the happening of some event (e.g. &quot;until the crops are ready for harvest&quot;, &quot;until the war is over&quot;). This is now disfavored, and some jurisdictions have made fixed durations a requirement.

=== Termination or expiration===
The tenancy will end automatically when the fixed term runs out or in the case of a tenancy that ends on the happening of an event when the event occurs. It is also possible for a tenant to give up the tenancy to the landlord, either expressly or implicitly. This process is known as a surrender of the lease. A tenancy may end when and if the tenant accepts a buyout agreement from their landlord. The landlord can offer to repurchase the property from their tenant as long as both parties agree upon the price (as with any other consideration, this need neither be market-rate, nor indeed monetary at all).

Depending on the laws in force in a particular jurisdiction, different circumstances may legally arise where a tenant remains in possession of property after the expiration of a lease.

=== Periodic tenancy ===
A periodic tenancy, also known as a tenancy from year to year, month to month, or week to week, is an estate that exists for some period of time determined by the term of the payment of rent. An oral lease for a tenancy of years that violates the statute of frauds (by committing to a lease of more than—depending on the jurisdiction—one year without being in writing) may create a periodic tenancy, the construed term being dependent on the laws of the jurisdiction where the leased premises are located. In many jurisdictions the &quot;default&quot; tenancy, where the parties have not explicitly specified a different arrangement, and where none is presumed under local or business custom, is the month-to-month tenancy.

=== Tenancy at will ===
A tenancy at will or estate at will is a leasehold such that either the landlord or the tenant may terminate the tenancy at any time by giving reasonable notice. It usually occurs in the absence of a lease, or where the tenancy is not for consideration. Under the modern common law, tenancy at will can arise under the following circumstances:
* the parties expressly agree that the tenancy is at will and not for rent.
* a family member is allowed to live at home without formal arrangement. A nominal consideration may be required.
* a tenant wishes to occupy the property urgently, but there was insufficient time to negotiate and execute a lease. The tenancy at will terminates in this case as soon as a written lease is completed. The tenant must vacate the property if a lease fails to be realized.

In a residential lease for consideration, a tenant may not be removed except for cause, even in the absence of a written lease. If a landlord can terminate the tenancy at will, a tenant by operation of law is also granted a reciprocal right to terminate at will. However, a lease that expressly continues at the will of the tenant (&quot;for as long as the tenant desires to live on this land&quot;) does not automatically provide the landlord with a reciprocal right to terminate, even for cause. Rather, such language may be construed to convey to the tenant a life estate or even a fee simple.

A tenancy at will terminates by operation of law, if:
* the tenant commits waste against the property;
* the tenant attempts to assign his tenancy;
* the landlord transfers his interest in the property;
* the landlord leases the property to another person;
* the tenant or the landlord dies.

=== Tenancy at sufferance ===
A tenancy at sufferance (sometimes called a holdover tenancy) is created when a tenant wrongfully holds over past the end of the duration period of the tenancy (for example, a tenant who stays past the expiration of his or her lease). In this case, the landlord can hold over the tenant to a new tenancy, and collect rent for the period the tenant has held over.

A tenancy at sufferance may exist when a tenant remains in possession of property even after the end of the lease, until the landlord acts to eject the tenant. The occupant may legally be a trespasser at this point, and the possession of this type may not be a true estate in land, even if authorities recognize the condition to hold the tenant liable for rent. The landlord may be able to evict such a tenant at any time without notice. Action to evict will terminate a tenancy at sufferance, because the tenant no longer enjoys possession. Some jurisdictions impose an irrevocable election whereby the landlord treats the holdover as either a trespasser, or as a tenant at sufferance. A trespasser is not in possession; but a tenant at sufferance continues to enjoy possession of the real property.

The landlord may also be able to impose a new lease on the holdover tenant. For a residential tenancy, such new tenancy lasts month to month. For a commercial tenancy of more than a year, the new tenancy is year to year; otherwise, the tenancy lasts for the same length of time as the duration under the original lease. In either case, the landlord can charge a higher rent, if the landlord, before the expiration of the original lease, has notified the tenant of the increase.

Simply leaving property behind on the premises does not constitute possession; thus, a tenancy at sufferance cannot be established. E.g., &quot;Nathan Lane Assocs. v. Merchants Wholesale&quot;, 698 N.W.2d 136 (Iowa 2005); &quot;Brown v. Music, Inc.&quot;, 359 P.2d 295 (Alaska 1961).

=== Continuation tenancy ===
In some jurisdictions, the tenant has a legal right to remain in occupation of the premises after the end of a lease unless the landlord complies with a formal process to dispossess the tenant of the property. For example, in England and Wales, a business tenant has a right to continue occupying their demise after the end of their lease under the provisions of sections 24–28 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (unless these provisions were formally excluded by agreement before the lease was completed). At the end of their lease they need do nothing but continue payment of rent at the previous level and uphold all other relevant covenants such as to keep the building in good repair. They cannot be evicted unless the landlord serves a formal notice to end the tenancy and successfully opposes the grant of the new lease to which the tenant has an automatic right. Even this can only be done under prescribed circumstances, for example the landlord&#x27;s desire to occupy the premises himself or to demolish and redevelop the building.

==Contemporary practice==
===Australia===
====Leasehold land====
Leasehold land is a land holding leased to a person or company by the relevant state (as the Crown); however, all mineral rights are reserved to the Crown. There are different types of leasehold tenure from state to state. Pastoral leases cover about 44% of mainland Australia, mostly in arid and semi-arid regions and the tropical savannahs.

There are three types of leasehold tenure in Australia:
*Term lease – usually 1–50 years, for a specified purpose.
*Perpetual lease, or lease in perpetuity – may be used only for a specified purpose.
*Freeholding lease – after approval is granted, convert a lease to freehold, and the lessee pays the purchase price in installments. This is an interim tenure; freehold title is not issued until all purchase costs have been paid.

All land in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) is leasehold, issued with 99-year leases. The rent on the leases was abolished by the Gorton government in 1970, with the leasehold system now &quot;almost identical in operation&quot; to the freehold tenure typical of residential properties in other Australian jurisdictions.

====Residential tenancies====
Australian residential tenancies differ from state to state, governed by local legislation.

===United Kingdom===
Modern leasehold estates in England and Wales can take one of four forms—the &quot;fixed-term tenancy&quot; or &quot;tenancy for years&quot;, the &quot;periodic tenancy&quot;, the &quot;tenancy at will&quot;, and the &quot;tenancy at sufferance&quot;. Forms no longer used include socage and burgage.

When a landowner allows one or more persons, called &quot;tenants&quot;, to use the land in some way for some fixed period, the land becomes a leasehold, and the resident- (or worker-) landowner relation is called a &quot;tenancy&quot;. A tenant pays rent (a form of consideration) to the landowner. The leasehold can include buildings and other improvements to the land. The tenant can do one or more of: farm the leasehold, live on it, or practise a trade on it. Typically, leasehold estates are held by tenants for a specific period of time.

In England in recent years, some new homes and apartments have been sold by large housebuilders with a leasehold where the ground rent payable doubles every 10 to 25 years, with consequently a very high price to buy out the lease. This has caused some recently built homes to be complicated to sell. In 2017, the British government launched a consultation on legal reforms to end such exploitative schemes.

Scotland has different laws, and under Scots Law it has been forbidden by statute since 1974 to create a lease of a dwelling lasting longer than 20 years or to grant any other lease of over 175 years.

===United States===
In the US, food co-ops supply tenants with a place to grow their own produce. Rural tenancy is also a common practice. Under a rural tenancy, a person buys a large amount of land, and the rural community uses it agriculturally as a source of income.

The term estate for years appears to be a US term. This refers to a leasehold estate for any specific period of time (the word &quot;years&quot; is misleading, as the duration of the lease could be a day, a week, a month, etc.). An estate for years is not automatically renewed.

== Duties of participants ==

=== Duties of landlord ===
The first duty of the landlord is to put the tenant in physical possession of the land at the outset of the lease (the English and majority rule, as opposed to the American rule which only requires the tenant be given &quot;legal&quot; possession, or the &quot;right&quot; to possess); the second is to provide the premises in a &quot;habitable condition&quot;—there is an implied warranty of habitability. If landlord violates either, the tenant can terminate the lease and move out, or stay on the premises, while continuing to pay rent, and sue the landlord for damages (or withhold rent and use breach of implied warranty of habitability as a defense when the landlord attempts to collect rent).

The lease also includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoymentlandlord will not interfere with tenant&#x27;s quiet enjoyment. This can be breached in three ways.
# Total eviction of the tenant through direct physical invasion by landlord.
# Partial evictionwhen the landlord keeps the tenant off &quot;part&quot; of the leased property (even locking a single room). Tenant can stay on the remaining property without paying any rent.
# Partial eviction by someone &quot;other&quot; than landlordwhere this occurs, rent is apportioned. If landlord claims to lease tenant an area of 1,000 square metres but 400 square metres of the area belongs to another person, tenant only has to pay 60% of the rent.

=== Landlord&#x27;s tort liability ===
Under the common law, the landlord had no duties to the tenant to protect the tenant or the tenant&#x27;s licensees and invitees, except in the following situations:
# Failure to disclose latent defects of which the landlord knows or has reason to know. The landlord is not obligated to repair the defect as long as the tenant is made aware of it, though typical rental agreements would make the landlord responsible for reasonable repairs.
# For a short-term lease (typically three months or less) of a furnished dwelling, the tenants are treated as invitees, and the landlord is liable for defects even if the landlord neither knows nor has reason to know of them.
# Common areas under landlord&#x27;s control (e.g. hallways in an apartment building), if the landlord failed to maintain them to a reasonable standard or otherwise was negligent in their management.
# Injury resulting from landlord&#x27;s negligent repairs, whatever the cause.
# Use by the general public, if the following three factors exist:
## The landlord knows or should know that the tenant is (or intends to) use the land for a public-facing purpose, such as if a shopkeeper rents premises at which to do business;
## The landlord knows or should know that there is a defect; and
## The landlord knows or should know that the tenant will not fix the defect (particularly when the agreement makes the landlord responsible for repairs). 

=== Duties of tenant ===
Under the common law, the tenant has a number of duties to the landlord:
# to pay rent, when it is due,
# to avoid waste (intentional or negligent destruction) of the property. When a property is leased for the development of its natural resources, this duty may not apply inasmuch as “waste” (i.e. non-renewable use of the resources on the land) is essential to the purpose of the lease. 
#to inform the landlord of anything notable that goes on affecting the property (such as building a structure, the occurrence of a fire, etc.)
A tenant is liable to third-party invitees for negligent failure to correct a dangerous condition on the premiseeven if the landlord was contractually liable.

== Effects of condemnation ==
If land under lease to a tenant is seized by eminent domain, the tenant may be able to earn either a reduction in rent or a portion of the condemnation award (the price paid by the government) to the owner, depending on the amount of land taken, and the value of the leasehold property.

With a &quot;partial taking&quot; of the land, the tenant may claim apportioned rent for property taken. For example, suppose a tenant leases land for six months for ¤1,000 per month, and that two months into the lease, the government condemns 25% of the land. The tenant will then be entitled to take a portion of the condemnation award equal to 25% of the rent due for the remaining four months of the lease—¤1,000, derived from ¤250 per month for four months.

A &quot;full taking&quot;, however, extinguishes the lease and excuses all rent from that point. The tenant will not be entitled to any portion of the condemnation award, unless the value of the lease was greater than the rent paid. In this case, the tenant can recover the difference. Suppose in the above example that the land&#x27;s market value was actually ¤1,200 a month, but the ¤1,000 per month rate represented a break given to the tenant by the landlord. Because the tenant is losing the ability to continue renting the land at this bargain rate (and probably must move to more expensive land), the tenant will be entitled to the difference between the lease rate and the market value – ¤200 per month for a total of ¤800.

<text>Fyodor Alekseyevich Minin () (ca. 1709 - after 1742) was a Russian Arctic explorer.

In 1730s, Minin participated in the Second Kamchatka expedition. On January 7, 1736, he joined the unit led by Dmitry Ovtsyn. In 1738, he was in charge of a group of explorers, that would chart the Arctic Ocean coastline east of the Yenisei river. In 1738–1740, Minin made an attempt to go around the Taimyr Peninsula from the north and reached 75°15&#x27;N. Together with Dmitry Sterlegov, he mapped this part of the Arctic Ocean coastline.

A cape at the Mammoth Peninsula, a peninsula, the Minina Skerries in the Kara Sea, a gulf, and a mountain on the shores of the Taimyr Peninsula bear Minin&#x27;s name.

<doc id="863176" wikidata="Q685166" url="?curid=863176" title="Kuwohi">
<text>Kuwohi (, also known as Clingmans Dome, its former official name) is a mountain in the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina in the Southeastern United States.

At an elevation of , it is the highest mountain in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the highest point in the state of Tennessee, and the highest point along the Appalachian Trail. It is also the third highest point in eastern mainland North America, after Mount Mitchell () and Mount Craig ().

==Description==
Kuwohi has two subpeaks: Mount Buckley to the west and Mount Love to the east. The headwaters of several substantial streams are located on the slopes of Kuwohi, including Little River on the north slope, and Forney Creek and Noland Creek, both of which are tributaries of the Tuckasegee River, on the south slope. The mountain is located entirely within the watershed of the Tennessee River.

Kuwohi is protected as part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. A paved road connects it to U.S. Highway 441 at Newfound Gap away. A tall concrete observation tower at the summit, built in 1959 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, offers a panoramic view of the mountains. An air quality monitoring station, operated by the Environmental Protection Agency, is the second highest in eastern North America.

The Southern Appalachian spruce–fir forest which covers Kuwohi occurs only at the highest elevations in the Southeastern United States and has more in common with forests at northern latitudes than with the forests in the adjacent valleys. Kuwohi stands prominently above the surrounding terrain, rising nearly from base to summit. The forest on and around Kuwohi has experienced a large die-off of Fraser fir caused by non-native insect balsam woolly adelgid.

===Observation tower===

Built in 1959, the observation tower features a circular observation platform accessed by a spiral ramp. The ramp is in length, and rises at a 12 percent grade, in sync with the Clingmans Dome Trail. The platform, in diameter, allows spectators a 360-degree panorama of the surrounding terrain. Cantilevered signs point out the various peaks, ridges, cities, and other features visible in the distance. Depending on the haze, visibility ranges from on hazy days to on very clear days.

The tower was one of nine observation towers constructed as part of the Mission 66 program (1955–1966), an effort by the National Park Service to upgrade its facilities to accommodate an influx of visitors to national parks during the post-World War II era. Designed by Hubert Bebb of the Gatlinburg-based architecture firm Bebb and Olson, the tower&#x27;s modern design, especially the use of concrete as the primary building material, marked a departure from previous park structures, which favored more rustic elements. Though some criticized the Kuwohi tower as too &quot;urban,&quot; two other park service observation towers—the nearby Look Rock tower along Foothills Parkway and the Shark Valley tower at Everglades National Park—were built using similar designs.

Bebb&#x27;s original design consisted of a massive stone tower topped by a circular platform and fire observation cab, accessed by a concrete ramp. Fred Arnold, head of the park service&#x27;s Forest and Wildlife Protection branch, rejected the inclusion of the fire observation cab, arguing that while Kuwohi was the highest point in the park, it was not particularly useful for fire detection purposes. Park service director Conrad Wirth objected to the use of a ramp, favoring instead a spiral staircase. After John B. Cabot, head of the park service&#x27;s Eastern Office of Design and Construction, convinced him of the ramp&#x27;s usefulness, Wirth decided the stone tower would not be necessary, stating a single central support column would suffice.

The tower was built by the Waynesville, North Carolina construction firm of W.C. Norris at a cost of $57,000 (). Ground was broken in December 1958. After several weather delays and a great deal of controversy over the aesthetics of the design, the tower was completed on October 23, 1959.

===Access===
Kuwohi is the most accessible mountain top in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The Clingmans Dome Road, which is open annually from April 1 through November 30, begins just past Newfound Gap and leads up the mountain to the Forney Ridge Parking Area, below the summit. A paved trail leads from the parking lot to the observation tower. The short, steep trail provides a small visitor information center and park store staffed by the Great Smoky Mountains Association. The trail offers a glimpse of the often hostile environment of highland Appalachia, passing through the spruce-fir forest and its accompanying blowdowns and dead Fraser Firs.

The Appalachian Trail (A.T.) crosses Kuwohi, passing immediately north of the observation tower. A leg of the trail connects the mountain with Newfound Gap and provides the only access to the mountain in winter months. The nearest A.T. backcountry shelters are the Double Spring Gap Shelter, which is to the west near the Goshen Prong junction, and the Mount Collins shelter, which is to the east near the A.T.&#x27;s junction with the Sugarland Mountain Trail. Kuwohi is the upper terminus for several additional hiking trails, including the Forney Ridge Trail (to Andrews Bald) and the Forney Creek Trail (to the Benton MacKaye Trail on the shores of Fontana Lake).

The western terminus of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail, which connects the Smokies to the Outer Banks of North Carolina, is located atop Kuwohi. It follows the Appalachian Trail for to the east, where it then begins to descend toward the Blue Ridge Parkway, via the Fork Ridge Trail.

==History==

The Cherokee name for the mountain is or (, translating to &#x27;mulberry place&#x27;. According to a Cherokee myth recorded by ethnologist James Mooney in the late 19th century, the mountain was the home of the White Bear, the great chief of all bears, and the location of one of the bears&#x27; council houses. The enchanted lake of &quot;Ataga&#x27;hi&quot; (&quot;Gall Place&quot;), the waters of which could cure wounded bears, was believed by the Cherokee to be located somewhere between Kuwohi and the headwaters of the Oconaluftee River to the east.

In 1789, an act passed by the North Carolina legislature ceded what is now Tennessee to the federal government. This act fixed a portion of the boundary between the two along the crest of the &quot;Great Iron or Smoky Mountains,&quot; which would have included the mountain later known as Clingmans Dome. The mountain was dubbed &quot;Smoky Dome&quot; by American settlers moving in from other areas. 

In 1859, the mountain was renamed to &quot;Clingmans Dome&quot; by geographer Arnold Guyot for compatriot Thomas L. Clingman, who extensively explored, measured, and promoted the area in the 1850s, and who would go on to become a Confederate general of the American Civil War. Guyot named the mountain for Clingman because of an argument between Clingman and a professor at the University of North Carolina, Elisha Mitchell, over which mountain was actually the highest in the region. Mitchell contended that a peak by the name of Black Dome (now known as Mount Mitchell) was the highest, while Clingman asserted that Smoky Dome was the true highest peak. Guyot determined that Black Dome was higher than Smoky Dome.

In the early morning hours of June 12, 1946, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress crashed near the summit of Kuwohi, killing all twelve aboard.

In June 2022, Lavita Hill and Mary &quot;Missy&quot; Crowe, both members of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, drafted legislation for the Tribe to support changing the name of Clingmans Dome to Kuwahi (&#x27;mulberry place&#x27;)—the original name given to the area by Cherokees. The resolution describes the area, &quot;Kuwahi or &#x27;mulberry place&#x27;, is the highest point in our area and has significance to us as Cherokees as it was visited by medicine people who prayed and sought guidance from the Creator regarding important matters facing our people, and then returned to our towns to give guidance and advice.&quot; The Tribal Council of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians passed the legislation, submitted by Hill and Crowe, during its regular session on July 14, 2022, thus lending the Tribe&#x27;s support for the name change effort. The change was presented as an opportunity &quot;to talk about the language&quot; and remind people that &quot;this was Cherokee homeland.&quot;

The official process started with the filing of an application for a name change through the United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN). On August 2, 2022, the Buncombe County Board of Commissioners voted unanimously to support the name change, after consultation with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. The council of the tribe voted in early 2024 to authorize the submission of an application to BGN. The National Park Service &quot;strongly supported&quot; this name change. It was ultimately approved, with the official press release of the name change to Kuwohi, which was effective immediately, being released on September 18, 2024.

==Geology==
Kuwohi is part of a geological formation known as the Copperhill Formation. It consists predominately of massive, coarse-grained metagreywacke and metaconglomerate. The lower northern flanks of Kuwohi are underlain by thick layers of sulfidic, quartz-garnet-muscovite phyllite and schist, which occur within the metagraywackes and metaconglomerates. Adjacent to and south of its summit, thin, southward-dipping, and discontinuous beds of garnetiferous (locally graphitic and sulfidic) metasiltstone occur within the Copperhill Formation.

The Copperhill Formation is part of the greater Ocoee Supergroup, a body of clastic metasedimentary rocks formed 560 million years ago. They unconformably lie upon Precambrian granitic and gneissic rocks. The sediments that originally comprised the Ocoee Supergroup accumulated in a string of narrow, deep-water basins that stretched along the entire southern-central Appalachian margin from Tennessee, North Carolina, to Georgia. These basins were rift basins formed by the rifting of Rodinia.

The initial metamorphism of the Ocoee Supergroup occurred about 400 million years ago as the result of Ordovician-Silurian tectonism during the Taconic orogeny. Later, Devonian-Mississippian metamorphism of these strata occurred during the Acadian orogeny and additional Pennsylvanian to Permian alteration by retrograde metamorphism and deformation occurred during the Alleghanian orogeny. During the latest part of this orogeny, this segment of the Appalachian Mountains was formed by thrust faulting and folding that uplifted these strata as a series of complexly deformed thrust sheets. During the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, the gradual uplift and erosion of this part of the Appalachian Mountains has continued.

Although a dense forest understory covers most of the mountain, outcroppings of the Copperhill Formation can be found on Kuwohi at the Forney Ridge Parking Lot at the end of Clingmans Dome Road. This outcrop exposes massive metaconglomerate of the Copperhill Formation. At this outcrop, it consists of massive thick beds of micaceous quartzite. It contains coarse pebbles of quartz and feldspar, flat pebbles of fine-grained black graywacke, and egg-shaped concretions up to in diameter. These cobble-sized concretions are readily weathered to leave rust-stained depressions or cavities in the metaconglomerate.

Soils of Kuwohi are mostly moderately deep to shallow, well drained dark brown loam or sandy loam of strong to extreme acidity; Breakneck and Pullback series are most common.

==Climate==
The climate of the summit of Kuwohi is humid continental (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;). The surrounding areas have an oceanic (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) climate, as does most of the Blue Ridge Mountains. As with much of the southern Blue Ridge, the area qualifies as part of the Appalachian Temperate Rainforest.

<text>Tryavna ( ) is a town in central Bulgaria, situated in the northern slopes of the Balkan range, on the Tryavna river valley, near Gabrovo. It is famous for its textile industry and typical National Revival architecture, featuring 140 cultural monuments, must, and expositions. Tryavna is the birthplace of Bulgarian writer Pencho Slaveykov and revolutionary Angel Kanchev.

The town is the administrative centre of the eponymous Tryavna Municipality. As of December 2009, it had a population of 9,831.

== History ==

The village was founded as early as the Thracian Era. However, the first documents of its existence date back to the 12th century. In 1190 it was the site of the Battle of Tryavna, which proved crucial in reestablishing Bulgarian independence from the Byzantines. During Ottoman Bulgaria period locals defended the pass and enjoyed privileges for this reason. Only Bulgarians lived in the town. During the period of Bulgarian National Revival, the town was heavily involved in the development of crafts. Houses from this period feature their own architectural design. The ground floors had irregular forms and housed craftsmen and traders. The upper floors featured wooden bow-windows, the roofs were covered with well-arranged rocks.

The town square, named Capitan Diado Nikola, with the clock tower, dating from 1814, are among the landmarks. Another tourist attraction is the &quot;kivgireniyat&quot; bridge, built above the river behind the clock tower. One of the first secular schools in Bulgaria was built on Capitan Diado Nikola Square. Another symbol of Tryavna is the St. Archangel Mihael Church, situated in the town center and built in the late 12th century after Bulgarian tzar Asen defeated Byzantine emperor Isaac II. The wood-carved iconostasis and the bishop&#x27;s throne in the church are real masterpieces of the woodcarving in Tryavna. Next to the school, is the Raykov house with its ethnographic collection, which is the birthplace of the first Bulgarian chemist, Pencho Nikolov Raikov. Not far away from it is the museum-house of Angel Kanchev who was Vassil Levski&#x27;s compatriot. One of the most visited museums in Tryavna is the Daskalov house built in 1808. The museum features the famous wood carved suns. The house is a museum of woodcarving and icon painting art. The remarkable ceilings were made after a bet between two of the best masters of wood carving — Dimitar Oshanetsa and Ivan Bochukovetsa. The two masters worked hard for six months in the two largest rooms in the house without having the possibility to see each other&#x27;s work.

The Petko and Pencho Slaveykov museum-house, situated in the old part of the town, features an exposition of the poetical works of the two authors. The son, Pencho, was nominated for the Nobel Prize but died before having a chance to win it. The Kalinchev house, also in the old part, has been transformed into an art gallery, offering the collection, donated by Totio Gybenski. The Museum of icon painting and woodcarving with its collection of over 160 original icons, painted by well-known masters, is housed in the Tsar&#x27;s chapel at a distance of the town center.

The unique Museum of Asian and African Art is housed in the old public bath, on the riverside. Tryavna is proud with its great samples of the woodcarving, icon painting and original architecture.

Today the town is a preferred tourist spot, featuring modern hotels, private lodgings and villas, restaurants and taverns.

There is also an Art school where successors of the old icon painters and woodcarvers master these crafts.

The Voneshta voda village resort, famous for its healing mineral springs, is located away from Tryavna. The Bulgarka Nature Park is located in the Starina Planina, south on the city.

The town is well connected with the whole country thanks to its excellent road network and railway station.

Besides Bulgarian National Revival figures, another native is former Bulgarian NBA player Georgi Glouchkov.

<text>The Scarlets () are one of the four professional Welsh rugby union teams and are based in Llanelli, Wales. Their home ground is the Parc y Scarlets stadium. They play in the United Rugby Championship and in European Professional Club Rugby competitions. The club was originally named the Llanelli Scarlets but was renamed at the start of the 2008–09 rugby season.

The Llanelli Scarlets were founded in 2003, as one of the five (now four) regional teams created by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU). The Scarlets are affiliated with a number of semi-professional and amateur clubs throughout the area, including Welsh Premier Division sides Llanelli RFC, Carmarthen Quins RFC and Llandovery RFC. Through the 2007–08 season, they played most of their games at Stradey Park in Llanelli, but they have also played matches at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham. The club&#x27;s new stadium, Parc y Scarlets (), was constructed in nearby Pemberton, and opened in November 2008.

The Scarlets won the league twice: the initial 2003–04 Celtic League season, and the Pro12 in 2016–17, defeating Munster 46–22 in the 2017 Pro12 Grand Final.

==History==
===Formation===
In 2003, the WRU elected to reduce the top tier of Welsh professional rugby from nine clubs into five regions during the introduction of regional rugby union teams in Wales, attempting to mirror the successful formats in Ireland, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

Initially, it was planned to have a region playing at Stradey Park, with players coming from Llanelli, Swansea and Neath. This was then modified to have Llanelli and Swansea merging, while Neath joined with Bridgend. Llanelli were opposed to both plans and requested standalone status. Eventually, Llanelli and Cardiff were allowed to remain independent. The Llanelli Scarlets brand was officially launched on 7 July 2003.

Despite always having been a 100% owned Llanelli RFC subsidiary, the Scarlets were originally conceived as representing the whole of West and North Wales. In the early seasons of regional rugby, the Scarlets played a small number of games at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham. While nominally continuing to be the regional franchisee for North Wales, the Scarlets presence there has diminished. As of 2018, the Scarlets consider their region to represent the three counties of Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire.

===2003–2014===
====2003–04 season====
Largely drawn from the Llanelli RFC side that won the Welsh Cup the preceding year, the Scarlets carried that success forward into their inaugural season. They reached the last eight of the 2003–04 Heineken Cup and finished the Celtic League season as champions by four points over Ulster. In the Heineken Cup, the Scarlets were drawn in Pool 4 along with Northampton Saints, Agen and Borders. The Scarlets won five of their six matches, losing only to Agen, and finished top of their pool before losing to French club Biarritz 27–10 in the quarter-finals.

====2004–05 season====

The following season, however, was less successful. Plagued by injuries and retirements, as well as the departure of influential fly-half Stephen Jones to Clermont, the Scarlets finished a disappointing fifth in the league. They were even less successful in the Heineken Cup, winning just two of their six pool games to finish third behind Northampton and Toulouse. The salvation of their season came in reaching the final of the Celtic Cup, which they lost 26–17 to Munster.

====2005–06 season====
The Scarlets again failed to qualify from their Heineken Cup group in 2005–06 and finished sixth in the Celtic League. They did, however, find more success in the newly restructured Anglo-Welsh Cup. After finishing at the top of their pool, they defeated Bath by one point in the semi-finals to reach the final against London Wasps at Twickenham; missing several international players, they lost 26–10. In the Heineken Cup, it was a similar story to the previous season, with the Scarlets winning two of their six fixtures to finish third in the pool again, behind Toulouse and Wasps. Despite finishing sixth in the Celtic League, the team qualified for the Heineken Cup for the 2006–07 season as the second-best-placed Welsh team in the league. They also re-signed Stephen Jones, and full-back Barry Davies extended his contract to stay with the Scarlets. The Scarlets&#x27; Director of Rugby, Gareth Jenkins, had been appointed as Wales&#x27; national team coach, having been with the region since its inception. Phil Davies, then coach of Leeds Tykes, replaced Jenkins at the Scarlets.

====2006–07 season====
At the first home game of the 2006–07 season, an information sheet was handed out to supporters with details of the club&#x27;s financial situation. There was opposition by local residents to plans by the Scarlets to move to a new stadium and sell their current ground for housing development. The information sheet stated that, due to delays caused by the opposition and benefactors pulling out of the club, it was &quot;extremely unlikely that [the Llanelli Scarlets] could survive to the end of the present season unless other financial assistance is found&quot;, which would result in &quot;the loss, probably for all time, of professional rugby in West Wales.&quot; Local residents believed, however, that the infrastructure, such as roads and schools, will not cope with 450 new houses being built on the site. On 28 November 2006, the regions secured investment from Tim Griffiths, a London-based businessman.

In the 2006–07 Heineken Cup, the Scarlets recorded one of the most famous victories in their brief history as a region, defeating Toulouse 41–34 away, despite twice trailing by 21 points. This was an unexpected victory, despite the Scarlets having won their first three games of the 2006–07 competition. They later secured their place in the Heineken Cup quarter-final with a convincing 35–11 win over Ulster at Ravenhill. The Scarlets went on to become only the fifth team in the history of the competition to win all their pool matches. They beat current holders Munster 24–15 at Stradey Park in the quarter-finals, but were beaten 33–17 in the semis by a strong Leicester Tigers side, putting an end to their hopes of making it &#x27;third time lucky&#x27; in Heineken Cup semi-finals.

====2007–08 season====
On 30 April 2008, Phil Davies was replaced by Nigel Davies after a sixth-place finish in the Celtic League and an end of season slump.

====2008–09 season====
The Scarlets moved from Stradey Park at the end of November 2008 to a new ground at Pemberton called Parc y Scarlets. The final Scarlets match played at Stradey Park was on 24 October 2008, against Bristol in the group stage of the Anglo-Welsh Cup. The Scarlets won 27–0 in front of a capacity crowd, which included former Llanelli captains such as Delme Thomas and Phil Bennett.

The Scarlets&#x27; first match at their new home was an 18–16 Celtic League defeat to Munster on 28 November 2008. Their first Heineken Cup match at Parc y Scarlets was held on 12 December against Ulster and finished in a 16–16 draw. Both matches were held with reduced capacity, as law requires that a new stadium hold three events at reduced capacity before it is authorised for its full capacity. The official opening ceremony was on 31 January 2009, when the Scarlets faced the Barbarians.

====2011–12 season====

During the 2011–12 season, the Scarlets were unable to progress to the knockout rounds of the Heineken Cup, but placing second in their pool earned them an automatic drop-down spot in the quarter-finals of the Challenge Cup. They lost the resulting fixture against Brive 15–12, despite scoring the only try of the match through Liam Williams.

Nigel Davies departed the club at the conclusion of the 2011–12 season, and was replaced by defence coach and longtime Scarlets player, Simon Easterby.

===2014–2019: Wayne Pivac years===
====2014–15 season====
In May 2014, it was confirmed that the four Welsh regions would compete in the annual Premiership Sevens Series after a three-year deal was agreed with BT Sport.

After the 2013–14 season, the Scarlets had numerous changes in coaching staff. Forwards coach Danny Wilson departed for Bristol, while Byron Hayward joined as a defense coach. Wayne Pivac was hired as an assistant coach, but selected as head coach when Simon Easterby left the position to become forwards coach with Ireland.

Under Pivac, the Scarlets&#x27; performances did not immediately turn around. Centre Jonathan Davies left for Clermont ahead of the 2014–15 season, but Hadleigh Parkes was signed from Auckland, and reunited with former coach Pivac. Mid-table finishes continued for the next two seasons. Mark Jones departed in 2015, replaced by long time Scarlets fly-half and London Wasps attack coach Stephen Jones.

====2016–17 season====
Ahead of 2016, Tadhg Beirne joined the side. The Irish forward arrived from Leinster, and capable of playing at lock and in the back row, proved to be an influential player in the pack. Recruitment was further bolstered with Crusaders back Johnny McNicholl and the return of Jonathan Davies from France. Fly-half Rhys Patchell was signed from Cardiff Blues, with Steven Shingler moving in the opposite direction. The season started poorly, with the Scarlets losing their first three matches. Improvements throughout the season saw the Scarlets finish in third place in the table, qualifying for the play-offs. The Scarlets beat Leinster away at the RDS Stadium, 27–15, despite winger Steff Evans being sent off in the first half. The Scarlets beat Munster in the final with an emphatic 46–22 win. This was the Scarlets second title, their first having come in 2004 during the first Celtic League season.

====2017–18 season====
The Scarlets looked to maintain their title the following season in the inaugural Pro14 tournament. Leigh Halfpenny joined from Toulon, replacing outgoing fullback Liam Williams. They topped their pool in the Champions Cup, and defeated La Rochelle 29–17 in the quarter-final. The Scarlets fell short of the final, losing to eventual winners Leinster in their semi-final.

They again reached the final in the league, having defeated the Cheetahs and Glasgow Warriors in the knock-out rounds, but came up short against Leinster, losing 40–32 in the final despite a late flurry of tries and a hat-trick from Johnny McNicholl.

====2018–19 season====
Wayne Pivac was announced as Warren Gatland&#x27;s successor as Wales coach after the 2019 Rugby World Cup. With him left Stephen Jones and Byron Hayward, who joined Pivac on the Wales coaching staff.

Crusaders assistant coach Brad Mooar was announced as the next head coach in December 2018.

====Project Reset====

In 2018, the Welsh Rugby Union sought to reform club rugby in Wales. Salaries had increased as they worked to entice Welsh players abroad to return, and they aimed to streamline costs with a banding system. The Professional Rugby Board (PRB) was created between the WRU and clubs to attempt to identify a sustainable path forward. The PRB evaluated numerous options including mergers and relocations of clubs, and by early 2019 felt the preferable option was to merge the Scarlets with west Wales rivals the Ospreys; the Swansea club having made a made an approach to the Scarlets in late 2018. This was not the first time a west Wales super club had been mooted; during the 2003 formation of regional rugby, a combination of the Llanelli, Swansea, and Neath forming a unified club was initially proposed. The new combined club would play league matches at Parc y Scarlets, with European fixtures at the Ospreys&#x27; Liberty Stadium. Shortly after the proposal was revealed, Scarlets ownership indicated the merger was &quot;off the table&quot;, with Ospreys chairman Mike James resigning, and the club formation ultimately remaining unchanged.

===2019–2021: Coaching changes===
====2019–20 season====
New coach Brad Mooar started the 2019 season well, winning five out of the first six matches, but left before settling in, having been selected by new All Blacks coach Ian Foster to join his staff as assistant coach. The Scarlets and the New Zealand Rugby Union agreed to a release for Mooar, and his assistant coach Glenn Delaney was named as his successor.

====2020–21 season====
Former Scarlets Dwayne Peel was announced as head coach for the forthcoming season, with Delaney moving to a Director of Rugby role. Peel was at the time contracted to join Cardiff Blues for the following season, as an assistant coach responsible for attack. Following the dismissal of Blues head coach John Mulvihill, former coach Dai Young made a return to the club initially as interim head coach and finally Director of Rugby. Due to this new coaching structure, the Scarlets and Blues came to an agreement allowing for Peel to no longer join Cardiff as an assistant coach, and instead join the Scarlets as head coach.

After a poor run of matches, Delaney was relieved of his duties as head coach and departed the club before assuming the Director of Rugby role, with Dai Flanagan stepping in as caretaker head coach.

=== 2021–present: Dwayne Peel era ===
====2021–22 season====
Ahead of the 2021–22 United Rugby Championship, Leinster skills coach Hugh Hogan was brought in as defence coach. The Scarlets finished in 10th place, and narrowly missed out on winning the newly created URC Welsh Shield. Hogan departed after one season, being replaced by Wales assistant coach Gareth Williams.

====2022–23 season====
Few signings were made prior to the 2022–23 United Rugby Championship season, with All Blacks utility forward Vaea Fifita the headline acquisition, while Liam Williams departed for Cardiff following his second spell with the club. Longtime prop Rob Evans followed Steffan Hughes, and former Dragon Angus O&#x27;Brien to the Dragons, along with backs coach Dai Flanagan, who was named as their new head coach.

Following their collapse in October 2022, Wasps head coach Lee Blackett joined as backs coach for the remainder of the season. The season began poorly for the Scarlets, winning only one URC match prior to the international window. Wales prop Sam Wainwright joined midseason, with Samson Lee remaining sidelined with a long-term injury. Upon regrouping, fortunes had changed, with the team winning both matches in the first two rounds of the 2022–23 EPCR Challenge Cup pool stage, putting themselves at the top of their pool. They then beat Bayonne and the Cheetahs in the return matches to finish top of the pool and set up a round of 16 knockout fixture at home against Brive. The Scarlets followed up on their European victory the following week, beating the Bulls despite missing numerous players to Wales call-ups, and earning their first victory over the Pretoria-based team.

During the Six Nations, they secured a bonus-point win against Edinburgh, and two bonus points in a loss away to Munster, in which they came back from 35–7 down at half-time. They then secured their second win over South African opposition of the season with a 32–20 win over a Sharks team heavily laden with Springboks. The Scarlets made their way into the quarter-finals of the Challenge Cup, after beating Brive 19–7, facing ASM Clermont Auvergne at home. This was the Scarlets first European quarter-final fixture since the 2019–20 season. The Scarlets won the match 32–30, with a late try by Ryan Conbeer and a match-winning conversion from Sam Costelow three minutes from full-time, propelling them into a home semi-final. The Scarlets lost the resultant semi-final, their final match of the season.

The squad saw fifteen players leave the club, owing to the reduced salary caps imposed by the WRU. Notable departures included Rhys Patchell, Leigh Halfpenny, and Aaron Shingler, who spent his entire professional career with the club. Corey Baldwin and Dane Blacker were both released, and subsequently signed for the Dragons. In the backroom, Nigel Ashley-Jones departed the club after two seasons to join Eddie Jones with the Australia national rugby union team. Lee Blackett left following his short-term agreement with the club, joining Bath Rugby. Forwards coach Ben Franks returned to New Zealand.

====2023–24 season====
Joining the club were Welsh international Ioan Lloyd from Bristol Bears, and former Scarlet Tomi Lewis returning from Jersey Reds. Numerous renewals were also confirmed, such as lock pair Morgan Jones and Jac Price, centres Ioan Nicholas, Joe Roberts, and Eddie James, and prop Kemsley Mathias– all players developed from the Scarlets academy. Sam Wainwright signed a full contract, following on from his short-term deal. Hooker Ryan Elias signed an extension, despite interest from abroad. Also signed was former New Zealand U20 back row Taine Plumtree, who qualified for Wales and was quickly called up to the Welsh squad for World Cup preparations. Added to the restructured Scarlets academy were lock Ed Scragg, and Loughborough duo Charlie Titcombe and Teddy Leatherbarrow.

Clermont coach Jared Payne signed as the new attack coach, with Lions coach Albert van den Berg joining as the forwards coach. Shane Carney took over as Head of Athletic Performance, reuniting with Peel, having worked at Ulster together previously.

Few wins were seen during the season, the highlights being a home and away win against local rivals Cardiff, and earning a first win outside of Wales with a victory over Zebre Parma. In the Challenge Cup, they lost every match, and failed to earn a single point on the table. They finished the season with a win, in the annual Judgement Day fixture against the Dragons.

During the season, defence coach Gareth Williams was removed from his position, with Jared Payne moving from attack to replace him, and Peel becoming responsible for the attack. Samson Lee announced his retirement mid-season, having failed to fully recover from a long-standing injury. Johnny McNicholl was released early to return home to New Zealand, joining the Crusaders as cover for former Scarlet Leigh Halfpenny. Notably, former Scarlets and Wales captain Ken Owens retired prior to the end of the season, having spent his entire professional career with the club.

Also departing the club were two more capped British Lions: Jonathan Davies and Wyn Jones; Welsh international Scott Williams; and academy products Dan Jones and Ryan Conbeer.

===Name and colours===

The Scarlets took their name from the nickname of Llanelli RFC, their main feeder club. Llanelli have played in red since 1884 when they played a game against a touring Ireland side. This close link with Llanelli RFC has also led to the Scarlets adopting the scarlet red colour for their primary jerseys, with their secondary colours generally being blue.

The region was originally named the Llanelli Scarlets, but was renamed at the start of the 2008–09 rugby season to more accurately represent the area covered by the region.

==Stadium==

From 2003 to the 2007–08 season, the Scarlets played most of their home matches at Llanelli&#x27;s Stradey Park (also the home of Llanelli RFC). However, they have played several games in North Wales, at Wrexham&#x27;s Racecourse Ground, to promote the region&#x27;s geographical representation. The last league game played at the Racecourse Ground was in September 2005. The 2006–07 season was planned to be the last season played at Stradey Park, which was subsequently to be demolished for the building of apartments. The Scarlets played every home game of the 2006–07 season at Stradey Park to commemorate the historic ground. They played their last game at Stradey Park on 24 October 2008 against Bristol, and their first game at Parc y Scarlets on 28 November 2008 against Munster.

The new home of the Scarlets and Llanelli RFC, known as &quot;Parc y Scarlets&quot; (), is in Pemberton. The new stadium cost £23 million to be constructed and holds 14,340 spectators. The first game held at the stadium saw Llanelli RFC play Cardiff RFC on 15 November 2008. The stadium&#x27;s main stand is located on the south side of the ground, and houses the new Scarlets museum and club shop, as well as a sports bar, the players&#x27; changing rooms and a players&#x27; gym. Stadium blueprints planned for the main stand to be about tall. Outside the stadium there is a training barn for the players, as well as a training pitch and athletics track. The remainder of the site is taken up by the Parc Trostre retail park.

<text>Sevlievo ( ) is a town in north-central Bulgaria, part of Gabrovo Province. Sevlievo is known as one of the wealthiest towns in Bulgaria owing to the well developed local economy, high employment rate and major foreign investments, such as the Ideal Standard Companies factory. It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Sevlievo Municipality.

In 2021, the population of the town was 19 363.

==History==
The earliest traces of occupation in the region date back to the late Neolithic period (around the 8th century BC). Some Thracian tombs still survive. Hotalich Fortress is the last medieval town. It had been inhabited for more than 1,000 years and functioned as an important defensive center. Hotalich existed for centuries together with the settlement on the site of the contemporary town, known as &quot;Servi&quot; and &quot;Selvi&quot;.

In the middle of the 19th century, the development of crafts led to the concentration of large sums of money in the crafts&#x27; societies. Commercial trips across the Ottoman Empire, Europe and Russia enriched general knowledge.

In 1834 St Prophet Eliah Church was restored and in 1836 the medieval Batoshevo Monastery was rebuilt. In the mid-1850s, Kolyu Ficheto, a prominent master of the Bulgarian National Revival period, built the stone bridge over the Rositsa River. In 1844 the famous wealthy craftsman and merchant, Hadzhi Stoyan Nikolov, invested his own money in the building of a huge school.

In 1870, under the direct guidance of Vasil Levski, known as the &quot;Apostle of Freedom&quot;, a revolutionary committee was created. It prepared the population of Sevlievo for the April Uprising in 1876. The Bulgarians from this region took an active part in the uprising.

Ottoman occupation of the town ended 2 July 1877. As a major cultural institute, the local community center has existed for 127 years. The Mara Belcheva House of Culture became the new center of cultural events.

<doc id="863211" wikidata="Q712968" url="?curid=863211" title="Edward Woodward">
<text>Edward Albert Arthur Woodward, OBE (1 June 1930 – 16 November 2009) was an English actor and singer. After graduating from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, he began his career on stage. Throughout his career, he appeared in productions in both the West End of London and on Broadway in New York City. He came to wider attention from 1967 in the title role of the British television spy drama &quot;Callan&quot;, earning him the 1970 British Academy Television Award for Best Actor.

Woodward starred as Police Sergeant Neil Howie in the 1973 cult British horror film &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, and in the title role of the 1980 Australian biopic &quot;Breaker Morant&quot;. From 1985 to 1989, Woodward starred as ex-secret agent and private investigator Robert McCall in the American television series &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, earning him the 1986 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Drama Actor.

==Early life==
Woodward was born on 1 June 1930 in Croydon, Surrey, the only child of parents Edward Oliver Woodward, a metalworker, and Violet Edith Woodward (née Smith). As a boy, he was bombed out of his home three times during the Blitz. He attended Eccleston Road, Sydenham Road, as well as Kingston Day Commercial School and Elmwood High School, Hackbridge, all in Surrey. He then attended Kingston College.

==Career==

===Theatre===
After leaving school at the age of 15, Woodward wanted to train as a journalist, but took work in a sanitary engineer&#x27;s office, and then at the age of 16 entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). After the Second World War, he became an associate member of that academy. He was torn between becoming an actor and a professional footballer, and was on the books of Leyton Orient and Brentford, making three appearances in the Football League for the latter, but a serious knee injury kept him out of the game for over a year.

Woodward&#x27;s professional acting debut was in the Castle Theatre, Farnham, in 1946. After graduation from RADA, he worked extensively in repertory companies as a Shakespearean actor throughout England and Scotland, making his London stage debut in R. F. Delderfield&#x27;s &quot;Where There&#x27;s a Will&quot; in 1955 and also appeared in the film adaptation that same year, his first film, and then &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1955). Having established himself, he also worked in Broadway theatre in New York City and in Australia. Woodward first appeared on Broadway in &quot;Rattle of a Simple Man&quot; (1963) and the musical comedy &quot;High Spirits&quot; (1964–1965), which won three Tony Awards, followed by the 1966 comedy &quot;The Best Laid Plans&quot;. In 1970, after Woodward played Sidney Carton in the West End musical &quot;Two Cities&quot;, based on Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, Laurence Olivier invited him to choose his own role in the Royal National Theatre, and he chose &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (1971).

Woodward played Dr. Watson opposite Keith Baxter as Sherlock Holmes in the play &quot;Murder Dear Watson&quot; in 1983.

In 2004, Woodward, alongside Australian actor Daniel MacPherson, appeared as God in a revival of &quot;The Mystery Plays&quot; at Canterbury Cathedral. From a cast of hundreds of local actors, Joseph McManners and Thomas James Longley also featured with smaller speaking roles.

===Film===
He made occasional appearances until taking the role of Police Sergeant Neil Howie in the thriller &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; in 1973. Woodward was offered a cameo role in the 2005 remake, but declined. He also appeared in the 1982 film &quot;Who Dares Wins,&quot; also known as &quot;The Final Option&quot; on the film&#x27;s release history. as Commander Powell.

Woodward played the title role in the 1980 Australian biographical film drama &quot;Breaker Morant&quot;, which was highly acclaimed, and his presence brought the film worldwide attention. Woodward also had a supporting role in the 2007 action comedy &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;. His last lead film role was that of the Reverend Frederick Densham in &quot;A Congregation of Ghosts&quot;, the story of an eccentric vicar who is said to have alienated his congregation and preached to cardboard cutouts. 

Robin Hardy, who directed &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, said, &quot;He was one of the greatest actors of his generation, without a doubt, with a broad career on American television, as well as on British film.&quot; Noël Coward once said of him, &quot;He was one of the nicest and most co-operative actors I&#x27;ve ever met or worked with.&quot;

In 1990, Woodward was the narrator for the official FIFA film of the 1990 World Cup entitled &quot;Soccer Shoot-Out&quot;.

===Television===
Woodward appeared in many television productions. In the early 1960s, he was a jobbing actor who made a number of minor TV appearances in supporting roles. His casting as Guy Crouchback in the 1967 adaption of Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Sword of Honour&quot; trilogy, dramatised by Giles Cooper and directed by Donald McWhinnie, established him as an actor of quality and standing. Crouchback was the central character in Waugh&#x27;s three novels set against the background of Britain&#x27;s involvement in World War II. This black-and-white TV dramatisation is now much less well known than a more lavish 2001 colour version with Daniel Craig playing the part of Crouchback. However, the 1967 dramatisation enjoyed a high profile at the time, and it featured several leading actors of that era, including Ronald Fraser, Freddie Jones, Vivian Pickles, Nicholas Courtney, and James Villiers. Moreover, Evelyn Waugh had met and approved Giles Cooper as the scriptwriter, having their schooling at Lancing College in common, albeit more than a decade apart.

In 1967, Woodward played the eventual victim in an episode of &quot;The Saint&quot; TV series (&quot;The Persistent Patriots&quot;). The same year, he was cast as David Callan in the ITV &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; play &quot;A Magnum for Schneider&quot;, which later became the spy series &quot;Callan&quot;, one of his early television roles and one in which he demonstrated his ability to express controlled rage. His performance assured the series&#x27; success from 1967 to 1972, with a film appearing in 1974. He also appeared opposite Laurence Olivier in a 1978 adaptation of &quot;Saturday, Sunday, Monday&quot; in the &quot;Laurence Olivier Presents&quot; anthology series.

The success of &quot;Callan&quot; typecast him somewhat, but the enduring success of the genre allowed him to gain leading roles in similar productions, though none would prove to be as iconic as &quot;Callan&quot;. In 1977, he starred in two series (series is sometimes BrE the AmE seasons) of the BBC2 dystopian drama &quot;1990&quot;, about a future Britain lurching into totalitarianism.

The late 1970s, he spent time on both stage and film, but he had not found recognition and popularity exceeding that of &quot;Callan&quot; until he took the lead role in the American television series &quot;The Equalizer&quot; (1985–89) as a former intelligence operative. After filming a few episodes of the third season, Woodward suffered a massive coronary. For several episodes, additional actors were brought in to reduce the workload on Woodward as he recovered from the condition. The first episode filmed following Woodward&#x27;s heart attack involved his character being severely injured by a KGB bullet, providing Woodward with a chance to rest over several episodes. Later in the season, Woodward resumed his full duties and carried the show through a fourth season during 1988-1989. During this period, he also starred in the Cold War espionage thriller, &quot;&quot; (1988), as an MI6 double agent.

Subsequently, he starred in the short-lived CBS series &quot;Over My Dead Body&quot;, which ran in 1990, playing a mystery writer who gets involved in solving real crimes. In 1994 and 1997, Woodward starred in the BBC drama &quot;Common As Muck&quot;, in which he played a binman called Nev.

In 1993, Woodward appeared in the Welsh language drama, &quot;Tan ar y Comin&quot;. Versions were made in both English and Welsh, and Woodward appeared in both, being specially coached in the latter, since he did not speak a word of the language.

In 1999, Woodward appeared alongside his son Peter in &quot;The Long Road&quot;, an episode of the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; spin-off, &quot;Crusade&quot;, on which Peter was a regular cast member. While both actors were playing the part of unrelated Technomages, the on-screen chemistry between them was clear.

His career continued with TV guest-star roles, including an appearance in &quot;The New Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; and Mr. Jones (or Philip, codename Flavius) in the series &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;. He also guest-starred with his son Tim and grandson Sam as a London gangster family in a special storyline for &quot;The Bill&quot; in 2008. In March 2009, he joined &quot;EastEnders&quot; for six episodes, playing Tommy Clifford.

Woodward was a wargamer and hosted a series of programmes for Tyne Tees Television in 1978 about the hobby with fellow enthusiast Peter Gilder, who built and owned the beautiful Gettysburg diorama used for one of the gaming scenes from the 1974 film &quot;Callan&quot;.

Woodward was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions; in February 1971, he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in the bar of London&#x27;s White House Hotel, and in February 1995, Michael Aspel surprised him during a photoshoot at Syon House in West London.

===Music===
His capability as tenor enabled him to record 12 albums of romantic songs, and three albums of poetry and 14 books to tape. His vocal ability and acting skill enabled him to make a number of appearances when time allowed on the BBC&#x27;s Edwardian era music hall programme, &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;.

Woodward had two top-100 albums in the UK Album Chart; &quot;This Man Alone&quot; (number 53 in 1970) and &quot;The Edward Woodward Album&quot; (number 20 in 1972), while the single &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; peaked at number 42 on the UK Singles Chart in 1971. He also had two top-100 albums in Australia; &quot;Edwardian Woodward&quot; (number 97 in 1975) and &quot;A Romantic Hour&quot; (#92 in 1980)

In July 2009, a planned performance of &quot;Love Letters&quot;, co-starring his wife Michele, was to be postponed because of damage caused to his hip when he fell down the stairs at his West Country home.

<text>(兜, 冑) is a type of helmet first used by ancient Japanese warriors that, in later periods, became an important part of the traditional Japanese armour worn by the samurai class and their retainers in feudal Japan.

Note that in the Japanese language, the word is an appellative, not a type description, and can refer to any combat helmet.

Every year on Children&#x27;s Day, May 5, Japanese households display miniature kabuto and samurai armor in keeping with the tradition of &quot;Tango no Sekku&quot;. In feudal times, real samurai armor, &quot;kabuto&quot;, and &quot;tachi&quot; were displayed.

==History==
Japanese helmets dating from the fifth century have been found in excavated tombs. Called (attached-visor helmet), the style of these kabuto came from China and Korea. They had a pronounced central ridge.

, now known as samurai helmets, first appeared in the 10th century Heian period with the appearance of &quot;ō-yoroi&quot;. Until the early Muromachi period, were made by combining dozens of thin iron plates. Generally, only daimyo and samurai at the rank of commander wore ornaments called (立物), which were shaped like a pair of hoes. In the middle of the Muromachi period, as the number of large group battles increased, ordinary samurai wore in the shape of a hoe, the sun, the moon, or their flag on their to show their courage or to distinguish friend from foe.

In the Sengoku period in the 16th century, when the scale of war increased and the guns called became popular, the armor styles called and became outdated. As a response to the popularity of , the armor style of () was created. were made by combining three to four pieces of iron plates. These were more bulletproof than the conventional style and could be mass produced. The became more eccentric and huge. Some were made of iron, but for safety reasons on the battlefield, they were often made with molded, lacquer-coated paper. In the Azuchi–Momoyama period, had a simple, bold design in accordance with the popularity of Momoyama culture.

In the Edo period, the Tokugawa shogunate defeated the Toyotomi clan in the Summer Siege of Osaka. Japanese society became more peaceful and medieval armor styles were revived. - and style were made again. Ornamental &quot;kawari kabuto&quot; (&quot;strange helmet&quot;) were made during this time that had &quot;figures of animals, [&quot;kami&quot;], or various other objects mounted on top of them&quot;. &quot;Kabuto&quot; during this time were made &quot;from materials including iron, gold-copper alloy, lacquer, leather, silk, wood, gesso, bone[,] and gesso binder&quot;.

The kabuto was an important part of the equipment of the samurai, and played a symbolic role as well, which may explain the Japanese expressions, sayings, and codes related to them. For instance, translates literally to &quot;Tighten the string of the kabuto after winning the war&quot;. This refers to not reducing one&#x27;s efforts after success; an equivalent saying in English would be &quot;Don&#x27;t rest on your laurels&quot;. (lit. &quot;to take off the kabuto&quot;) means &quot;to surrender&quot;.

==Parts of the &quot;kabuto&quot;==
The basic parts of the kabuto include:
*, a dome composed of overlapping elongated plates called 
*, a small opening at the top of the , usually fitted with a (an ornamental grommet, often resembling a chrysanthemum)
*, a brim or visor on the front of the 
*, a cloth lining inside the 
*, mounting points for attaching crests
*, a ring at the back of the for securing a (helmet flag)
*, wing-like or ear-like projections to the sides of the 
*, a suspended neck guard composed of multiple overlapping lames
* (chin cord), often used to secure the (facial armour)

A typical features a central dome constructed of anywhere from three to over a hundred metal plates riveted together. These were usually arranged vertically, radiating from a small opening in the top. The rivets securing these metal plates to each other could be raised (a form known as ) or hammered flat (a form known as ); another form, called , had the rivets filed flush. Some of the finer were signed by their makers, usually from one of several known families, such as the Myochin, Saotome, Haruta, Unkai, or Nagasone families.
A small opening in the top of the , called the or (seat of the war god, Hachiman), was thought to be for passing the warrior&#x27;s top knot through. Although this practice was largely abandoned after the Muromachi period, this opening may have been retained for purposes of ventilation or simply as an artifact of how the plates were riveted together. The was usually decorated with , which were rings of intricately worked, soft metal bands often resembling a chrysanthemum. and were two helmet forms that did not usually have an opening at the top.

 incorporated a suspended neck guard called a , usually composed of three to seven semicircular, lacquered metal or oxhide lames, attached and articulated by silk or leather lacing, although some were composed of 100 or more small metal scales in a row. This lamellar armour style, along with (mail armour), was the standard technology of Japanese body armour, and some were made of mail sewn to a cloth lining (a form called ).

The was secured to the head by a chin cord called , which would usually be tied to posts or hooks on the (facial armour) or simply tied under the chin.

 are often adorned with crests called or ; the four types of decorations were the (frontal decoration), (side decorations), (top decoration), and (rear decoration). These can be family crests (mon), or flat or sculptural objects representing animals, mythical entities, prayers or other symbols. Horns are particularly common, and many kabuto incorporate , stylized antlers.

==Types of &quot;kabuto&quot;==
===&quot;Suji bachi kabuto&quot;===
 is a multiple-plate type of Japanese helmet with raised ridges or ribs showing where the helmet plates come together; the rivets may be filed flat or they may be left showing, as in the .

===&quot;Hoshi-bachi kabuto&quot;===
 (star helmet bowl) with protruding rivet heads, have large rivets (), small rivets () and a rivet with a chrysantemoid-shaped washer at its base (). could also be if there were raised ribs or ridges showing where the helmet plates came together.

===&quot;Hari bachi kabuto&quot;===
 is multiple-plate Japanese with no ribs or ridges showing where the helmet plates come and the rivets are filed flush.

===&quot;Zunari kabuto&quot;===

The is a simple, five-plate design.

===&quot;Tatami kabuto&quot;===
A great number of simpler, lightweight, folding, portable armours for lower-ranking samurai and foot soldiers () were also produced. These were called armour, and some featured collapsible (also called ), made from articulated lames. did not use rivets in their construction; instead, lacing or chain mail was used to connect the pieces to each other.

===&quot;Kaji kabuto&quot;===
 were a type of helmet worn by samurai firemen.

===&quot;Jingasa&quot;===
 were war hats made in a variety of shapes, worn by (foot soldiers) and samurai, which could be made from leather or metal.

===&quot;Kawari kabuto&quot;, or strange helmet===
During the Momoyama period of intense civil warfare, kabuto were made to a simpler design of three or four plates, lacking many of the ornamental features of earlier helmets. To offset the plain, utilitarian form of the new helmet, and to provide visibility and presence on the battlefield, armorers began to build fantastic shapes on top of the simple helmets in (papier-mâché mixed with lacquer over a wooden armature), though some were constructed entirely of iron. These shapes mimicked forms from Japanese culture and mythology, including fish, cow horns, the head of the god of longevity, bolts of silk, head scarves, Ichi-no-Tani canyon, and axe heads, among many others. Some forms were realistically rendered, while others took on a very futuristic, modernist feel.

<text>Alain Pierre Sailhac (7 January 1936 – 1 December 2022) was a French internationally recognized chef working in New York City, where he held the position of executive vice president and dean emeritus at The International Culinary Center, founded as the French Culinary Institute. Sailhac earned the first-ever four-star rating from &quot;The New York Times&quot; while at Le Cygne in 1977. He went on to be a chef at Le Cirque, the 21 Club, and the Plaza Hotel.

== Culinary background ==
Sailhac, born in France on 7 January 1936, began his culinary career at age 14, working as an apprentice at the Capion restaurant in his small hometown of Millau, France. He worked in Paris, Corfu, Rhodes, and Guadeloupe before becoming sous chef at the Michelin Guide two-star Château de Larraldia. In New York City, beginning in 1965, Sailhac established himself as chef de cuisine at Le Mistral and Le Manoir. Stints at several Paris hotels and restaurants and as executive chef at l&#x27;Hôtel Royal in New Caledonia and Le Perroquet in Chicago followed.

In 1974, Sailhac worked at Le Cygne, which during his tenure, received the coveted four stars from The New York Times in 1977. He served as executive chef from 1978 through 1986 at the legendary Le Cirque restaurant on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, earning three stars in 1984 from The New York Times. Sailhac also was executive chef at the 21 Club, culinary director at the Plaza Hotel, and a consultant to the Regency Hotel. In 1991, Sailhac joined The French Culinary Institute as dean of culinary studies and was executive vice president and dean emeritus.

== Achievements ==
In 1984, Sailhac was welcomed into the world’s oldest savory culinary association: the Maîtres Cuisiniers de France (Master Chefs of France | MCF). In 1997, he received the MCF Silver Toque after being named Chef of the Year by the Maîtres Cuisiniers de France (Master Chefs of France), an award that places him among the world&#x27;s outstanding culinary artists.

Sailhac received the Silver Spoon Award with his wife, Arlene Feltman Sailhac, from Food Arts magazine in 2003. Also that year, he was the recipient of the 2003 James Beard Foundation &quot;Who&#x27;s Who of Food and Beverage in America. He also was the Chevalier du Mérite Agricole, and in 2004, he was presented France&#x27;s Ordre National du Mérite.

Sailhac was a member of numerous prestigious culinary organizations, including the Maîtres Cuisiniers de France and the Société Culinaire Philanthropique.

On 13 May 2010, Sailhac, along with other chefs from The French Culinary Institute (now known as The International Culinary Center), Jacques Pepin, Jacques Torres and André Soltner, prepared a $30,000-per-couple dinner for President Barack Obama&#x27;s fund-raiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee at Manhattan&#x27;s St. Regis Hotel.

== Death ==
Sailhac died in New York on 1 December 2022, at the age of 86.

<doc id="863219" wikidata="Q615492" url="?curid=863219" title="Jacques Roux">
<text>Jacques Roux (; 21 August 1752 – 10 February 1794) was a radical Roman Catholic Red priest who took an active role in politics during the French Revolution. He skillfully expounded the ideals of popular democracy and classless society to crowds of Parisian sans-culottes, working class wage earners and shopkeepers, radicalizing them into a revolutionary force. He became a leader of a popular far-left.

== Radical revolutionary ==
In 1791 Roux was elected to the Paris Commune. When the French First Republic started in 1792, Roux became aligned with the political faction dubbed by their enemies as the Enragés (French for &quot;The Enraged Ones&quot; but also &quot;Madmen&quot;). He was considered the most extreme spokesman on the left for the interests of the Parisian &quot;sans-culottes&quot;.

Roux consistently fought for an economically equal society, turning the crowds of &quot;sans-culottes&quot; against the bourgeois torpor of the Jacobins. He demanded that food be made available to every member of society, and called for the wealthy to be executed should they hoard it. Roux tirelessly voiced the demands of the poor Parisian population to confiscate aristocratic wealth and provide affordable bread.

He became popular enough that, as the split between the Girondins and the Montagnards grew wider, his voice helped remove the Girondins from the National Convention in 1793.

== &quot;Manifesto of the Enragés&quot; ==
In a controversial 1793 address to the National Convention that&#x27;s been dubbed the &quot;Manifesto of the Enragés&quot;, Roux demanded the abolition of private property and class society in the name of the people he represented.

Soon, Roux&#x27;s incendiary rhetoric was igniting food riots and upsetting the balance of power within the Paris Commune. Maximilien Robespierre, fearing Roux threatened the dominance of the Jacobin government, presented accusations of him being a foreign spy intentionally trying to disrupt the revolutionary government and the Committee of Public Safety. During this time, Roux&#x27;s former friend, Jean-Paul Marat, also turned against him, writing in his newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Ami du peuple&quot;, that Roux was a false priest that was only interested in religion as long as it provided income. On 7 July 1793 Roux&#x27;s enemies brought Elizabeth Marguerite Hébert in for questioning in an attempt to charge Roux with extortion and &quot;misappropriation of charitable funds&quot;. Hébert was a recent widow with no means to support herself and, two years earlier, Roux had agreed to raise funds for her and her family. When asked if Roux had an ulterior motive, she replied that she did not believe he did. He wasn&#x27;t arrested then, but in August 1793, Roux was arrested under the charges that he had withheld funds from both the widow Hébert and another widow, Mlle. Beaurepaire. Roux assured the revolutionary committee of section Gravilliers that he did nothing of the sort and that his enemies were working against him. Roux was released into the custody of two of his friends, where he continued fighting for his ideals. On 5 September 1793 Roux was thrown into prison again.

== Death ==
On 14 January 1794 Roux was informed that his case was going to be tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal. Upon hearing this news, Roux pulled out a knife and stabbed himself several times, but failed to land a fatal blow. Less than a month later, on 10 February 1794, while recovering in prison, Roux stabbed himself again, this time succeeding in killing himself. He was 41.

As the Enragés movement began falling apart, Jacques Hébert&#x27;s more moderate left-wing faction known as the Hébertists tried to win over his former supporters and continue where he had left off.

== In popular culture ==
In Peter Weiss&#x27;s &quot;Marat/Sade&quot;, Roux is portrayed by an asylum patient in the Marquis de Sade&#x27;s dramatization of Jean-Paul Marat&#x27;s assassination. The actor&#x27;s lines come under fire by the asylum directors, who have cut his dialogue. In most productions, the actor portraying Roux is costumed in a straight jacket, which symbolizes the asylum&#x27;s desire to restrain political radicals such as himself.

Roux was portrayed by Alan Rickman in a monologue written by Peter Barnes for the television short Revolutionary Witness. In the monologue, Roux performs a sermon in a ruined church the day before he is brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal, where he laments the current direction of the revolution. He argues that the poor, despite aiding in the revolution, are still being oppressed and dying while the rich are still powerful. He also narrates his life, regaling anecdotes from his youth all the way to the revolution. He believes that, due to his populist and progressive beliefs, he is &quot;too revolutionary for the revolution.&quot; As his sermon comes to an end, he promises that he will not defend himself before the Tribunal, but attack his opponents, promising that, should he be found guilty, he will &quot;die like [his] friend Marat, though struck down by a better hand, [his] own.&quot; In the last seconds of the monologue, Roux pleads to his listeners to continue fighting, arguing that &quot;the revolution isn&#x27;t complete.&quot;

Roux (played by Elias Toufexis) is featured in a mission in French Revolution-set &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Unity&quot;, in which the player is tasked with assassinating him.

Mother&#x27;s Finest issued its debut album &quot;Mother&#x27;s Finest&quot; in 1972 on RCA; a second album for RCA remained unreleased until it surfaced as bonus tracks on the 2010 Wounded Bird re-issue of &quot;Mother&#x27;s Finest.&quot; The group signed a new contract with Epic Records and released its sophomore effort, also titled &quot;Mother&#x27;s Finest&quot;, in 1976, stirring up controversy with the ironic &quot;Niggizz Can&#x27;t Sang Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. Riding a wave of success, the band&#x27;s next three albums, &quot;Another Mother Further&quot; (1977), &quot;Mother Factor&quot; (1978) and &quot;Mother&#x27;s Finest Live&quot; (1979), all went gold, helped along by heavy touring opening for the likes of Ted Nugent, Black Sabbath, The Who, Aerosmith and AC/DC.

In 1978, the band set out for Europe and took part in the Rockpalast concert series at the Grugahalle in Essen, produced by Germany&#x27;s WDR television and broadcast to various countries. With only one concert Mother&#x27;s Finest put themselves on the map all over Europe where the band still has a dedicated following. The legendary 1978 show was finally released on CD and DVD in 2012 as &quot;Mother&#x27;s Finest – Live At Rockpalast 1978 &amp; 2003&quot; which also includes the band&#x27;s 2003 &quot;Rockpalast&quot; appearance at Satzvey Castle.

After four albums for Epic/CBS in the 70&#x27;s, the band signed with Atlantic Records for its heaviest album to date, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Iron Age&quot;. That same year Joyce Kennedy guested with Molly Hatchet on the song &quot;Respect Me in the Morning&quot; from the &quot;Take No Prisoners&quot; album. Mother&#x27;s Finest went on hiatus after 1983&#x27;s &quot;One Mother to Another&quot;, with vocalist Joyce Kennedy pursuing a solo career, releasing the soul/R&amp;B-styled &quot;Lookin&#x27; for Trouble&quot; album on A&amp;M Records in 1984. She scored a Billboard Top 40 hit with &quot;The Last Time I Made Love&quot;, a duet with Jeffrey Osborne. A year later, Joyce recorded the song &quot;Didn&#x27;t I Tell You?&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;. Drummer Barry Borden, who had joined Molly Hatchet on the &quot;No Guts...No Glory&quot; album, teamed up with guitarist Moses Mo in the band Illusion, resulting in a pair of albums, &quot;Illusion&quot; (1985) and &quot;I Like It Loud&quot; (1986), on Geffen Records. Borden would later join The Outlaws for a pair of albums and has been a member of The Marshall Tucker Band since the late 1990s.

Meanwhile, bassist Wyzard toured with Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s Stevie Nicks behind her 1983 album &quot;The Wild Heart&quot;, including an appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Eventually, he and brother/drummer Harold Seay, who had replaced Barry Borden on &quot;One Mother to Another&quot;, joined Rick Medlocke in a revamped Blackfoot lineup and appeared on 1987&#x27;s &quot;Rick Medlocke and Blackfoot&quot; album.

Mother&#x27;s Finest re-formed for 1989&#x27;s &quot;Looks Could Kill&quot; on Capitol/EMI Records, with only drummer Barry Borden missing from the classic lineup. He was replaced by Joyce Kennedy and Glenn Murdock&#x27;s son, Dion Derek Murdock. In 1990, the band released its second live album, &quot;Subluxation&quot;, on RCA/BMG, albeit only in Europe. It was the first album to feature guitarist John &quot;Red Devil&quot; Hayes, formerly of Atlanta&#x27;s PG-13, hired in place of the departing Moses Mo.

The band moved over to Scotti Bros. for 1992&#x27;s &quot;Black Radio Won&#x27;t Play This Record&quot;, a heavy Thom Panunzio produced funk metal affair, recorded with the help of former Sound Barrier member Tracey &quot;Spacey T&quot; Singleton on guitar. The band continued to tour heavily, especially in Europe, but did not release another studio CD until 2004&#x27;s &quot;Meta-Funk&#x27;n-Physical&quot;, an experimental, hip hop- and electronic beats-oriented effort.

In 1997, drummer Dion Murdock lent his services to Kingdom Come and appeared on their &quot;Master Seven&quot; album. In 1999, Wyzard, Moses Mo and longtime Mother&#x27;s Finest touring keyboardist Pascal Kravetz joined multi-national band Carl Carlton &amp; The Songdogs, releasing a handful of albums along the way. In 2002, Moses Mo issued his solo album, &quot;Cartoon You&quot;, which features contributions from Glenn Murdock, Joyce Kennedy and Wyzard, along with several other members of the extended Mother&#x27;s Finest family, Kerry Denton, Harold Seay, Johnnetta Johnson and Pascal Kravetz. In 2008, Wyzard released his solo album, &quot;Primal Incantation&quot;, featuring brother Harold Seay and Sean O&#x27;Rourke on drums.

Beginning in 2004, Joyce Kennedy was seen on the international &quot;Daughters of Soul&quot; tour along with Sandra St. Victor, Nona Hendryx, Lalah Hathaway (daughter of Donny Hathaway), Indira Khan (daughter of Chaka Khan), and Simone (daughter of Nina Simone). Nona Hendryx would cover Mother&#x27;s Finest&#x27;s &quot;Truth&#x27;ll Set You Free&quot; off &quot;Another Mother Further&quot; with her group Labelle on their 2008 album &quot;Back to Now&quot;.

In 2010, fellow Georgia rockers Jackyl, featuring Darryl McDaniels from Run-D.M.C., paid homage to Mother&#x27;s Finest with a cover of &quot;Like a Negro&quot; from &quot;Black Radio Won&#x27;t Play This Record&quot; and also shot a video.. Jackyl frontman Jesse James Dupree had previously been in the band PG-13 with John Hayes in the late 1980s and called on Hayes to play guitar on his 2000 solo album, &quot;Foot Fetish&quot;, with Hayes and fellow Mother&#x27;s Finest members, Wyzard and Dion Derek Murdock, all contributing to the songwriting. Dupree, Hayes, Wyzard and Murdock had earlier played together under the name Dent. The band recorded an album for Sony Music, which was ultimately shelved by the label and remains unreleased.

On September 16, 2011, Mother&#x27;s Finest was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.

In July 2013, Mother&#x27;s Finest launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a new studio album.

In November 2014, it was announced that the band had signed a European record deal with SPV/Steamhammer for their new studio, &quot;Goody 2 Shoes &amp; The Filthy Beast&quot;, set for a spring 2015 release. An advance single, &quot;Shut Up&quot;, was issued on St. Nicholas Day, December 6, 2014 &quot;as a present to all their European fans&quot;.

In November 2015, Australian label Raven Records re-issued the band&#x27;s 4 albums for Epic Records, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Finest&quot; (&#x27;76), &quot;Another Mother Further&quot; (&#x27;77), &quot;Mother Factor&quot; (&#x27;78) and &quot;Live&quot; (&#x27;79) as a 2-disc package. British label SoulMusic Records would issue the 2-disc &quot;Love Changes: The Anthology 1972–1983&quot; set in March 2017, including 2 songs from the band&#x27;s 1972 debut album for RCA and a further 6 cuts from the second unreleased RCA album. These eight songs had previously been available on CD as bonus tracks on the now out-of-print Wounded Bird Records re-issue of the 1976 &quot;Mother&#x27;s Finest&quot; album.

On April 14, 2017, British label Rock Candy Records re-issued a re-mastered version of Mother&#x27;s Finest&#x27;s 1981 scorcher &quot;Iron Age&quot;, including a 16-page full color booklet, 4000-word essay about the making of the album, new interviews and enhanced artwork.

<doc id="863222" wikidata="Q927744" url="?curid=863222" title="Cheaha Mountain">
<text>Cheaha Mountain , often called Mount Cheaha, is the highest natural point in the U.S. state of Alabama. It is located a few miles northwest of the town of Delta in Cheaha State Park, which offers a lodge, a restaurant, and other amenities. The nearest higher peak is Brushy Top in Gilmer County, Georgia, 106.72 miles (171.75 km) away.

==Description==
The highest point is marked with a USGS benchmark in front of Bunker Tower, a stone Civilian Conservation Corps building with an observation deck on top. The CCC also constructed a road to Cheaha, but the road has been closed for years. The old road is known as CC Road and contains interesting ruins. Near the peak is Bald Rock, which was recently improved with a wheelchair-accessible wooden walkway that provides an impressive overlook of the surrounding region. The mountain was opened to the public as part of Cheaha State Park on June 7, 1939.
The mountain is a host to several commercial and public service transmitters. These radio antennas, along with sundry structures dating back to commercial schemes by the state of Alabama in the 1970s, stand in stark contrast to the surrounding natural environment. The Calhoun County Amateur Radio Association has a repeater near the peak, and Alabama Public Television has its transmitter for WCIQ TV 7 on a tower tall, rebuilt after the January 1982 ice storm brought the previous one crashing to the ground.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Cheaha&quot; is thought to come from the Choctaw word &quot;chaha&quot;, meaning &quot;high.&quot; 

== Geology ==

Cheaha Mountain is part of the Talladega Mountains, a small section of the Ridge and Valley Mountains, unlike other elevations of the Appalachians in north Alabama, which are part of the Cumberland Plateau. The mountain is the highest point in the eastern portion of the Sun Belt (east of the Mississippi River, south of Interstate 20, and north of the Gulf of Mexico). The summit of the mountain gives an impression of being at a much higher elevation than it actually is, in part because of the relatively low elevation of the adjacent area to the west. For example, the summit of Cheaha Mountain (elevation 2,413 feet or 735 meters) measures roughly 1,725.72 feet (526 meters) above the city of Oxford (elevation 686 feet or 209 meters) near the base of the mountain. Geologically it is composed of weakly metamorphosed sandstones and conglomerates of the Cheaha quartzite, of Silurian / Devonian age, and stands high topographically due to the erosional resistance of these rocks. The soil, only moderately deep, is a brown stony silt loam of the Cheaha series; it is well drained and very strongly acidic.

<text>Jacques Pépin (; born December 18, 1935) is a French chef, author, culinary educator, television personality, and artist. After having been the personal chef of French President Charles de Gaulle, he moved to the US in 1959 and after working in New York&#x27;s top French restaurants, refused the same job with President John F. Kennedy in the White House and instead took a culinary development job with Howard Johnson&#x27;s. During his career, he has served in numerous prestigious restaurants, first, in Paris, and then in America. He has appeared on American television and has written for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Food &amp; Wine&quot; and other publications. He has authored more than 30 cookbooks, some of which have become best sellers. Pépin was a longtime friend of the American chef Julia Child, and their 1999 PBS series &quot;Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home&quot; won a Daytime Emmy Award. He also holds a BA and a MA from Columbia University in French literature.

He has been honored with 24 James Beard Foundation Awards, five honorary doctoral degrees, the American Public Television&#x27;s lifetime achievement award, the Emmy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2019 and the Légion d&#x27;honneur, France&#x27;s highest order of merit, in 2004.

Since 1989, Pépin has taught in the Culinary Arts Program at Boston University and served as dean of special programs at the International Culinary Center in New York City. In 2016, with his daughter, Claudine Pépin and his son-in-law, Rollie Wesen, Pépin created the Jacques Pépin Foundation to support culinary education for adults with barriers to employment. He has lived in Connecticut since 1975.

==Early life and education==

Pépin was born in 1935 in Bourg-en-Bresse, France. He was the second of three sons born to Jeannette and Jean-Victor Pépin. After World War II, his parents opened a restaurant called Le Pélican, where Pépin worked as a child, and later became known for his love for food. 

At the age of thirteen, he started his apprenticeship at Le Grand Hôtel de l&#x27;Europe in Bourg-en-Bresse.

Pépin achieved his university education in his 30s, after his move to the United States in 1959. There he enrolled in English for foreign students, a GED equivalent, and eventually General Studies classes toward a Bachelor of Arts degree at Columbia University. He earned his Bachelor of Arts in 1970 from Columbia University&#x27;s School of General Studies, and in 1972, his Master of Arts in French literature from the Columbia Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. He entered into a doctoral program at Columbia, but his proposed thesis on French food in literature was rejected for being too frivolous for serious academic pursuit.

==Early career==
At age sixteen, Pépin went on to work in Paris, training under Lucien Diat at the Plaza Athénée. From 1956 to 1958, during his military service, he was recognized for his culinary training and skill and was ordered to work in the Office of the Treasury, where he met his long-time cooking partner, Jean-Claude Szurdak, and eventually became the personal chef to three French heads of state, including Charles de Gaulle.

In 1959, Pépin went to the United States to work at the restaurant Le Pavillon. Soon after his arrival, &quot;The New York Times&quot; food editor Craig Claiborne introduced him to James Beard and Helen McCully. McCully introduced him to Julia Child, who became a lifelong friend and collaborator. In 1961, after Pépin had declined an offer from John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy to serve as chef at the White House, Howard Johnson, a regular Le Pavillon customer, hired him to work alongside fellow Frenchman Pierre Franey to develop food lines for his chain of Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants, where Pépin served as the director of research and development for a decade.

In 1970, Pépin opened a specialty soup restaurant and lunch counter on Manhattan&#x27;s 5th Avenue called La Potagerie, and began to enjoy popular success with appearances on talk shows such as &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. 

His career as a restaurant chef ended abruptly with a near fatal car accident in 1974.

== Middle career ==

Beginning in the mid-1970s, after a car accident which damaged his left arm, Pépin reinvented himself as an educator, author and eventually a television personality. Pépin worked as a consultant for restaurateur Joe Baum on his Windows on the World project, and offered classes at small cooking schools and cookware shops around the United States. In 1976, Pépin authored his cookbook &quot;La Technique&quot;, followed by &quot;La Methode&quot; in 1979. The use of thousands of photographs, illustrating the techniques and methods required to achieve certain culinary results, provided a window into the art of cooking. The books are credited by chef Tom Colicchio and others as helping them to learn the craft of cooking.

In 1982, along with Alain Sailhac and André Soltner, Pépin was invited by Dorothy Cann Hamilton to become one of the deans at the newly formed culinary school, the French Culinary Institute, in New York City, now known as the International Culinary Center (ICC). Also in 1982, he filmed his first television series, with PBS local station WJCT-TV in Jacksonville, Florida, and published a companion cookbook entitled &quot;Everyday Cooking with Jacques Pépin&quot;. Through the 1980s and into the 1990s, Pépin was published as a columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and a guest author for &quot;Gourmet&quot;, &quot;Food &amp; Wine&quot; and many others. He authored several more cookbooks, including &quot;The Art of Cooking&quot;, volumes 1 and 2, and &quot;The Short-Cut Cook&quot;.

In 1989, Pépin partnered with Julia Child and Rebecca Alssid to create a culinary certificate program within the Metropolitan College at Boston University (BU). This effort eventually led to the first, and still one of the few, Master&#x27;s degrees in Gastronomy. Pépin&#x27;s 1991 television series &quot;Today’s Gourmet&quot;, filmed at KQED studios in San Francisco was created from recipes from several books, brought together in the companion cookbook &quot;Jacques Pépin&#x27;s Table&quot;. In 1994 and 1996, Pepin and Julia Child appeared in 90 minute PBS specials, &quot;Cooking In Concert&quot; and &quot;More Cooking In Concert&quot;, filmed live before a Boston audience as part of the PBS annual fund drives for those years. In 1996, Pépin introduced his then 27-year-old daughter Claudine, in three television series and companion books: &quot;Cooking with Claudine&quot;, &quot;Encore with Claudine&quot; and &quot;Jacques Pépin Celebrates&quot;. The father to daughter relationship, combined with an instructor to culinary novice relationship, demonstrated Pépin&#x27;s work as a chef and teacher. Each of the three series earned the pair James Beard Foundation Awards. In 1999, Pépin teamed up with Julia Child for the series and companion book &quot;Jacques and Julia Cooking at Home&quot;. The TV series, produced by Susie Heller, won a Daytime Emmy Award and a James Beard Foundation Award. In 2003, Pépin published his autobiography, &quot;The Apprentice: My Life in the Kitchen&quot;.

== Later career ==

In the 21st century, Pépin continues to cook, write, publish, film for television, paint and take on new projects. Throughout his career, he has toured and taught on cruise ships including the &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;, and the Crystal Cruises and Princess Cruises lines. In 2003, he was named the executive culinary director of Oceania Cruises, and &quot;is credited with helping it achieve its reputation for culinary excellence and style&quot;. Pépin continues to teach at the ICC and at BU, and offers book signings, culinary demonstrations and classes on Oceania cruises and at various locations across the US, several times per year.

Since his time as a student at Columbia University, Pépin has dabbled in and enjoyed drawing and painting. In recent years, he has committed more time to his art, and enjoyed some success with commercial sales on his website, Jacques Pépin Art, and juried shows. In the first decade of the 2000s, Pépin published several more cookbooks including &quot;Fast Food My Way&quot; and &quot;More Fast Food My Way&quot;, which were paired with television series of the same name, produced by Tina Salter, and &quot;Chez Jacques: Traditions and Rituals of a Cook&quot;, that significantly featured Pépin&#x27;s art. In 2011, Pépin filmed the series &quot;Essential Pépin&quot; at KQED studios and published a companion cookbook with more than 700 recipes and a set of technique-oriented videos. In 2012, he published &quot;New Complete Techniques&quot;, which combined and updated his important earlier works &quot;La Technique&quot; and &quot;La Methode&quot;.

In 2015 Pépin, 79, recovered at his home in Connecticut after suffering a minor stroke. He canceled his appearance at the annual International Association of Culinary Professionals conference in Washington D.C., but otherwise insisted on returning to his normal schedule, according to the Associated Press. &quot;Oh my god, he made soup this morning&quot;, Pépin&#x27;s daughter Claudine told the Associated Press. &quot;I will do my best to lighten the load, but he&#x27;s not of the mind to cancel anything. Honestly, he wanted to go to IACP. He&#x27;s like, &#x27;I&#x27;m talking. I can walk. Let&#x27;s go.

In 2016, with his daughter Claudine Pépin and son-in-law Rollie Wesen, Jacques created his eponymous, non-profit, organization the Jacques Pépin Foundation (JPF). The mission of the foundation is to support organizations that provide culinary training to adults and youths with barriers to employment such as low-income, low-skills, homelessness, issues with substance abuse and previous incarceration. The JPF provides grants, independent research, source and curricular materials, equipment, direct teaching and video instruction to community-based culinary training programs around the USA.

In 2017, Pépin published a cookbook with his granddaughter Shorey Wesen, entitled &quot;A Grandfather&#x27;s Lessons&quot;. In the same year, Pépin received an honorary doctorate from the Columbia University School of General Studies. Pépin resided in Connecticut with his wife Gloria, until her death in 2020.

==Television==

The success of Pépin&#x27;s book &quot;La Technique&quot;, used as a textbook for teaching the fundamentals of French cuisine, prompted him to launch a televised version resulting in a 1997 PBS series, &quot;The Complete Pépin&quot;. Relaunched on PBS ten years after its initial run, the series included a new introduction by Pépin where he stressed that the secret to being a successful chef and not a mere line cook lies in knowing and using the proper technique.

In 1999, Pépin co-starred in the PBS series &quot;Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home&quot; alongside Julia Child. The program was awarded a Daytime Emmy in 2001.

His show &quot;Jacques Pépin: Fast Food My Way&quot; (based on his 2004 book of the same name) ran on PBS, and &quot;Jacques Pépin: More Fast Food My Way&quot; was broadcast on PBS&#x27; Create. In &quot;Essential Pépin&quot; (2011), Pépin brings modern touches to some of his favorite recipes from his career. In the 26-part public television series, Pépin demonstrates more than 125 dishes while the companion book, published by Houghton-Mifflin, contains more than 700 recipes. In this series, Pépin cooks with his daughter, Claudine, wife of chef Rolland Wesen. All of his programs have been produced by KQED-TV in San Francisco.

Pépin was a guest judge on season five of the Bravo television show &quot;Top Chef&quot;, which aired in 2008. He stated that his ideal &quot;final meal&quot; would be roast squab and fresh peas.

Pépin was a guest on the television show &quot;Wahlburgers&quot; episode called &quot;Pauli Day&quot;. Donnie Wahlberg arranged for Pépin to surprise his brother Paul Wahlberg for his birthday.

In 2015, his television series &quot;Jacques Pépin Heart &amp; Soul&quot; began airing. According to its producer, Tina Salter KQED-TV, the series would be his &quot;most personal and special, revealing a man – a legend – whose lust for life, love of food, family and friends continues&quot;. The series premiered on KQED on September 12, 2015, and nationally on September 19.

A documentary about his life, &quot;Jacques Pépin: The Art of Craft&quot;, aired as part of the PBS series &quot;American Masters&quot;, premiering May 26, 2017. The film, narrated by Stanley Tucci, was produced and directed by Peter L. Stein, who had produced several of Pépin&#x27;s early television cooking series at KQED in the 1990s.

In 2020, Jacques and KQED began filming &quot;Cooking at Home&quot; for release on YouTube.

==Awards and honors==

In addition to the Daytime Emmy Award won with Julia Child, Pépin has received three of the French government&#x27;s honors: He is a Chevalier de L&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (1997) and a Chevalier de L&#x27;Ordre du Mérite Agricole (1992). In October 2004, he received France&#x27;s Légion d&#x27;honneur. He has also received 24 James Beard Foundation awards.

On May 13, 2010, Pépin, along with other chefs from the French Culinary Institute (known as the International Culinary Center), Alain Sailhac, Jacques Torres and André Soltner, prepared a $30,000-per-couple dinner for President Barack Obama&#x27;s fund-raiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee at Manhattan&#x27;s St. Regis Hotel.

On February 5, 2010, during the christening of MS &quot;Marina&quot;, Pépin was named an honorary commodore of the Oceania Cruises fleet, for which he serves as executive culinary director.

He received an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters from Boston University on May 22, 2011. In October 2011, Pépin was the recipient of the first-ever tribute dinner at the New York Food and Wine Festival. Cooking for Pépin at the event, hosted by Martha Stewart, were French chefs Alain Ducasse, Daniel Boulud, and others. In 2015, Pépin was the first recipient of the Julia Child Award from The Julia Child Foundation for Gastronomy and the Culinary Arts.

In May 2017, Pépin received an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters from Columbia University.

==Personal life==

Pépin married Gloria Evelyn Augier in 1966, whom he met while working as a ski instructor. She died on December 5, 2020. They had one daughter, Claudine (b. 1968).

In 1974, Pépin was badly injured while driving on a country road when a deer leapt in front of his car and he swerved to avoid it. His car hit the deer, veered off the road, struck a telephone pole, then crashed into a ravine and landed upside-down and on fire. He fractured 14 bones in his back, pelvis, and arms. His left arm was so badly injured that physicians initially wanted to amputate it. Pépin recovered, but his left shoulder remained limited in mobility and his left arm is several inches shorter than his right. In his autobiography, &quot;The Apprentice: My Life in the Kitchen&quot;, Pépin notes that his accident caused him to realize that he would not be able to continue working full-time as a chef/restaurateur; this realization motivated his reinvention as a teacher and author.
