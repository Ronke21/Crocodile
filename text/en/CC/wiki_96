The game takes place in a fictional world called Sylvarant and follows Lloyd Irving. Lloyd accompanies his childhood friend, Colette Brunel, who is destined to go on a journey to save their world. As their journey progresses, they learn that saving Sylvarant endangers Tethe&#x27;alla, a world parallel to their own. The game&#x27;s central theme is an .

&quot;Tales of Symphonia&quot; received generally positive reviews upon release. Critics praised the battle system, art direction, voice acting and character development, but had mixed reactions to the music and narrative, and criticized some graphical shortcomings. The game received a Japan Game Awards in 2003 and had received re-releases under the Player&#x27;s Choice and PlayStation 2 the Best labels. In the United States, over 100 thousand copies were sold during the first two weeks and has sold 2.4 million copies worldwide across all platforms, making it the best-selling title in the franchise at the time. The game has been adapted into seven manga collections, two novel series, seven drama CDs, and an OVA anime series. A sequel entitled &quot;Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World&quot; was released for the Wii in 2008. &quot;Tales of Symphonia&quot; and its sequel were collected as a PlayStation 3 high definition release in &quot;Tales of Symphonia Chronicles&quot; in 2013. A Steam version was released on February 2, 2016. A remastered version was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on February 17, 2023.

==Gameplay==

Like previous installments in the &quot;Tales&quot; series, &quot;Tales of Symphonia&quot; consists primarily of three major areas: an overworld field map, town and dungeon maps, and a battle screen. The overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a scaled-down version of the game&#x27;s fictional world which the player travels through to reach the game&#x27;s locations. As with preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by foot, on the party&#x27;s quadrupedal pet Noishe, and flying vehicles known as Rheairds. On field maps, characters are directed across realistically scaled environments. The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.

On the overworld and field maps, various skits between the characters can be viewed. They involve animated character portraits, subtitles, and, in the Japanese version, full voice acting. Skits concern anything from character development to side details. Overworld map skits affect Lloyd&#x27;s relationships with other party members. The player will be able to make certain decisions that imperceptibly affect how the other characters think of Lloyd. Some of these choices have minor ramifications for the game&#x27;s storyline.

;Battle system
During battle sequences, the game uses the Multi-Line Linear Motion Battle System. Four characters from the party are chosen to battle; those not controlled by a player are guided by artificial intelligence with instructions set by the player beforehand. Damage dealt to the opponent fills a &quot;Unison Gauge&quot;. When this is full, a &quot;Unison Attack&quot; can be triggered, allowing the party to use techniques simultaneously on a single enemy. When certain techniques are combined, a special attack results in additional damage.

After the battle, a currency called Grade is awarded or subtracted based on specific criteria that are fulfilled in battle. It is used to purchase bonuses during New Game Plus. Players are also prompted to cook food after battles if they have the materials. Cooking recipes determine the benefits received such as health recovery. The degree of the benefit is determined by which character is chosen to cook.

&quot;Tales of Symphonia&quot;″s skill system is built around the use of &quot;EX Gems&quot;, which come in four ranks. Each character can equip up to four EX Gems and set abilities to those gems. The abilities determine if the characters will learn Strike or Technical techniques and spells. Combinations of EX Gem abilities can also grant additional abilities called &quot;EX-Skills&quot;. The development of a character&#x27;s attributes is determined by their equipped &quot;Title&quot;. Titles are earned through story progression, side quests, or completion of miscellaneous criteria.

==Plot==
===Setting===
The initial setting of &quot;Tales of Symphonia&quot; is Sylvarant, a world in a state of decline due to the depletion of mana, a force essential to life and the use of magic. 4000 years prior, a war was waged by an evil race known as the Desians, who were sealed away by the legendary hero Mithos via a pact with the world&#x27;s goddess Martel. Due to Sylvarant&#x27;s weakening mana, the Desians have reemerged and are terrorizing humanity, conducting biological experiments on abducted humans in facilities known as &quot;human ranches&quot;, which further consumes mana. During this time, humanity puts his hopes upon the descendant of Martel&#x27;s angels, the &quot;Chosen&quot;, who must undertake a pilgrimage and awaken the &quot;Summon Spirits&quot; who protect Sylvarant. This will in turn awaken Martel, who will reseal the Desians and restore the world&#x27;s mana, and the Chosen will be reborn as an angel. The Chosen&#x27;s pilgrimage is complicated by the presence of the Renegades, a group that deliberately dresses in Desian garb and has assassinated Sylvarant&#x27;s Chosen for the past 800 years, preventing Martel&#x27;s awakening. Later, the existence of a parallel world named Tethe&#x27;alla comes to light. The two worlds are separated by a dimensional barrier that can only be passed through using magical technology (or &quot;magitech&quot;). They share a single source of mana and are caught in a precarious equilibrium in which mana is unevenly distributed; as one world prospers, the other declines.

Sylvarant and Tethe&#x27;alla are inhabited by humans as well as elves, a race of long-lived humanoid extraterrestrials who originated from the giant comet Derris-Kharlan and can manipulate mana to cast magic. Although normally only those of elven blood can cast magic, humans such as Kratos and Zelos can gain the same ability by ingesting the powdered ore &quot;Aionis&quot;. Offspring born between humans and elves are half-elves, who bear both the fighting spirit and curiosity of humans and the longevity and magical capabilities of elves. Because of this, they are discriminated against by condescending elves and jealous humans, and in Tethe&#x27;alla they are deprived of civil rights. The Desians are composed entirely of half-elves who act out of vengeance for this discrimination.

Several characters bear an &quot;Exsphere&quot;, a small jewel that enhances the wearer&#x27;s natural abilities when implanted onto the skin, and is also used as a power source for machinery. However, an Exsphere&#x27;s amplifying capability can only be awakened at the cost of a human life, and the Exsphere parasitically feeds off the user&#x27;s mana unless a suppressant named a &quot;Key Crest&quot; is installed. An evolved form of Exsphere known as a &quot;Cruxis Crystal&quot; grants its user immortality, a pair of angel-like wings, and a relinquished need for human functions such as eating or sleeping, but eventually erases the user&#x27;s ego if worn without a Key Crest. The Chosen is said to be born holding a Cruxis Crystal, though it is actually granted by its namesake organization Cruxis, the central body of the religion surrounding Martel. Cruxis&#x27; duty is to ensure the perpetuation of the Chosen&#x27;s genetic lineage in the prospering world and to guide the Chosen&#x27;s pilgrimage via an oracle in the declining world.

===Characters===
The main protagonist is Lloyd Irving, a young swordsman who joins the Chosen&#x27;s pilgrimage as a means of protecting his childhood friend Colette Brunel. He also seeks to defeat the Desians and avenge his mother, who was said to be killed protecting the Exsphere on the back of Lloyd&#x27;s hand. The other members of the pilgrimage include Lloyd and Colette&#x27;s mutual friend Genis Sage, their village schoolteacher and Genis&#x27;s older sister Raine Sage, and the traveling mercenary Kratos Aurion, who is hired by the village church to escort Colette. The group is later joined by Sheena Fujibayashi, a ninja from Tethe&#x27;alla who initially tries to assassinate Colette; Zelos Wilder, the arrogant and womanizing Chosen of Tethe&#x27;alla; Presea Combatir, a young lumberjack with superhuman strength as a result of Cruxis Crystal-related experiments; and Regal Bryant, an ex-convict who wishes to avenge his lover, whom he was forced to kill.

The organization Cruxis is led by Yggdrasill, a half-elf whose ultimate goal is to turn all people into lifeless beings in order to bring about an age free of discrimination. Yggdrasill&#x27;s secret identity is that of the legendary hero Mithos, an ageless half-elven boy who seeks to revive his older sister Martel, whom he propped up as a goddess following her death in the ancient war. Prior to Yggdrasill&#x27;s appearance, the oracle Remiel, who promotes Colette&#x27;s transformation into an angel, serves as the primary representative of Cruxis. The Renegades, a group attempting to thwart Cruxis&#x27; goals, are led by Yuan, a half-elf who aided Mithos in ending the ancient war and was engaged to Martel.

===Story===
Colette is summoned to her village&#x27;s church to receive the oracle who will initiate her pilgrimage to regenerate Sylvarant. She is protected from an apparent Desian attack by her friends Lloyd and Genis, as well as the traveling mercenary Kratos. Lloyd and Genis are initially denied the opportunity to accompany Colette on her pilgrimage, and Colette, hoping to protect them, secretly leaves early with Raine and Kratos. However, Lloyd and Genis&#x27;s intervention to rescue a friend of Genis at a nearby human ranch results in their village&#x27;s retaliatory decimation and their subsequent exile, leaving them no other option but to join Colette&#x27;s pilgrimage. During the journey, the process of the Chosen&#x27;s transformation into an angel is revealed to entail the gradual loss of Colette&#x27;s humanity. They also encounter and eventually make peace with the assassin Sheena, who comes from the parallel world of Tethe&#x27;alla. From her, they learn how the two worlds vie for each other&#x27;s mana through the journey of regeneration. Within a human ranch, the group discovers that Exspheres are cultivated within humans, with Lloyd&#x27;s Exsphere having came from within his mother. Hoping to find answers from the oracle Remiel, the party meets him at the Chosen&#x27;s final destination and are betrayed by Remiel and Kratos; both are revealed to be members of Cruxis, an organization that seeks to use the Chosen&#x27;s body as Martel&#x27;s vessel.

The party is rescued by the Renegades, a group that poses as Desians and aims to prevent Martel&#x27;s resurrection. The Renegades&#x27; leader, Yuan, explains that the Desians are servants of Cruxis and act to terrorize the population of the declining world and stimulate the growth of the Chosen&#x27;s Cruxis Crystal. When Yuan declares his intent to secure Lloyd to further the Renegades&#x27; purpose, the party escapes for Tethe&#x27;alla, where they restore Colette&#x27;s humanity after crafting a Key Crest for her Cruxis Crystal. In search for a way to save both worlds, the party determines that awakening the Summon Spirits in both worlds will sever the mana tie between them. Believing that to be the answer, they successfully sever all mana ties between the two worlds. Their actions instead destabilize the Great Seed, the supplier of mana to both worlds, causing it to grow and engulf Sylvarant at an exponential rate. After the party re-stabilizes the seed, they learn from Yuan about the origins of Sylvarant and Tethe&#x27;alla and how they used to be one world but was split by Cruxis&#x27; leader Mithos with the Eternal Sword; the party realizes they can save the world if they wield the Eternal Sword, merge the worlds, and germinate the Great Seed. They decide to confront and defeat Mithos before seeking the Eternal Sword.

At Mithos&#x27; stronghold, Zelos allows Colette to be kidnapped in a genuine or feigned betrayal of the party (depending on the player&#x27;s choices), and Mithos uses Colette&#x27;s body to reawaken Martel. However, Martel rejects Mithos&#x27; actions and twisted vision, and before vanishing back into the Great Seed, she laments that the elves should never have left Derris-Kharlan. Mithos misinterprets this sentiment as a wish to leave the two worlds for Derris-Kharlan, but is seemingly killed by the party before carrying out his seizure of the Great Seed, and Genis keeps his Cruxis Crystal as a memento of his sole half-elven friend. Kratos reveals that he has been gathering materials to forge a ring that will allow Lloyd to use the Eternal Sword. Mithos&#x27; spirit, having survived within his Cruxis Crystal, emerges and possesses a member from the party before fleeing to Derris-Kharlan. Mithos attempts to take the Great Seed with him, but is foiled and killed by Lloyd. Using the Eternal Sword, Lloyd merges Sylvarant and Tethe&#x27;alla together and germinates the Great Seed into a Giant Kharlan Tree to supply the world with mana.

==Development and release==
On May 8, 2002, Namco and Nintendo announced at a Tokyo press conference that they would collaborate on a number of titles for the GameCube, including a new installment in the &quot;Tales&quot; series slated for a July 2003 release. Originally developed under the title &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot;, its final title was revealed to be &quot;Tales of Symphonia&quot; in February 2003. An April 2003 edition of &quot;Famitsu&quot; revealed the game had been in development for two years, most of the development staff previously worked on &quot;Tales of Eternia&quot;, the game would have the most main characters in a &quot;Tales&quot; game to date, and would be the first 3D game in the series. A North American localization was confirmed at E3 2003. A conference by Namco on June 9, 2003 revealed the game would be on two disks and its theme song would be &quot;Starry Heavens&quot; by J-pop group Day After Tomorrow, which is also remixed as &quot;Starry Heavens ver. 2013&quot;, which is performed by the band&#x27;s lead singer, Misono, in the PS3 version, as well as the PC and Remastered versions. To celebrate its release in Japan, the game was bundled with a symphonic green GameCube. To increase the North American version&#x27;s appeal to Western audiences, localization producer Nao Higo replaced &quot;Starry Heavens&quot; with an orchestral anthem by composer Motoi Sakuraba, and focused on hiring experienced voice actors such as Scott Menville, Tara Strong, and Cam Clarke for the English voice-acting. The game was released in Japan on August 29, 2003, and was localized in North America, Australia, and Europe on July 13, 2004, November 18, 2004, and November 19, 2004, respectively. The game was re-released in North America under the Player&#x27;s Choice label on July 19, 2004.

During the second week of April 2004, &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; announced a PlayStation 2 port of &quot;Tales of Symphonia&quot;. It received new in-game additions and its theme song is by Day After Tomorrow, which is also remixed as , which is also performed by the band&#x27;s lead singer, Misono, in the PS3 version, as well as the PC and Remastered versions. It was released exclusively in Japan on September 22, 2004, and re-released under the PlayStation 2 the Best label on July 7, 2005.

===Scenario===
Takumi Miyajima, the game&#x27;s writer, explained &quot;Tales of Symphonia&quot; was planned to create a &quot;unique symphonia&quot;, dependent on the player&#x27;s choices and the affection system. Miyajima wrote many scenarios, with the most significant events centered on Zelos Wilder. Originally, Zelos&#x27; death was supposed to be canon. His survival would have been dependent on the affection system: He would die early on if he was ranked the lowest in the affection system, would die at the end if he ranked in the middle, and would only survive if he ranked the top. However, the development staff suggested to have Kratos Aurion return to the party and the team discussed how it would work. The change in scenario had Miyajima rework Zelos&#x27; death into a non-canon path of the story. While generally a self-contained story, &quot;Symphonia&quot; apparently takes place within either the same or a similar timeline to the first &quot;Tales&quot; game, &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Tales of Symphonia&quot; garnered &quot;generally favorable&quot; reception from critics according to review aggregator Metacritic. Alan Averill and Steve Thomason of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; determined the game to be the GameCube&#x27;s best RPG, as well as one of the best Averill had played. Jeremy Jastrzab of &quot;PALGN&quot; regarded it as a &quot;top gameplay experience&quot;, praising the depth of its gameplay and story. Jonathan Metts of &quot;Planet GameCube&quot; said that although the game &quot;clings to many of the well-worn RPG elements&quot;, its distinct battle system, story, and visual presentation allowed it to stand on equal footing with the most recent &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles. Rob Fahey of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; argued that the game was &quot;the finest example ever made of the truly traditional Japanese RPG&quot;, but was concerned that this traditional nature might dissuade players from trying it. Benjamin Turner of &quot;GameSpy&quot; said that the lush artwork and innovative battle system characteristic of &quot;Tales&quot; games helped &quot;Symphonia&quot; stand out in the GameCube&#x27;s &quot;RPG-starved&quot; library.

The battle system was praised for its ease of use and fast pace, with Jastrzab declaring it to be one of the best systems conceived for an action RPG. Metts explained that it &quot;strikes a perfect balance between the strategy of traditional menu-based RPG battles and the fast, skill-based action found in a weapons-based fighting game like &quot;Soul Calibur&quot;&quot;. While Star Dingo of &quot;GamePro&quot; concurred that the game&#x27;s individual character control was &quot;excellent&quot;, he lamented that the computer-controlled nature of the other party members resulted in a loss of the experience of learning new skills and spells, and said that attempts to micromanage the other members made the battle system clunky and burdensome. Joe Juba of &quot;Game Informer&quot;, meanwhile, was impressed by the variable customization of the computer-controlled characters&#x27; behavior. Daryl Vassar of &quot;G4techTV&quot; cited the battles as the game&#x27;s high point and claimed they were fun enough to win over non-RPG fans, though he considered the summoning system — which requires a character to take a great deal of damage before performing such an action — to be a weakness. David Smith of &quot;1UP.com&quot; was initially aggravated by the limitations imposed on three-dimensional movement combined with the number of enemies, but later acknowledged that the limitations encouraged strategic depth by preventing the player from exploiting repetitive or unbalanced tactics. In this regard, Smith deemed the system to be an improvement over that of &quot;Star Ocean: Till the End of Time&quot;; Fahey also drew a comparison to the title, considering the computer-controlled characters in &quot;Tales&quot; to be significantly more intelligent. Shane Bettenhausen of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; and Mary Jane Irwin of &quot;IGN&quot; complained that the game&#x27;s difficulty was imbalanced by the boss battles, which required significant grinding and were sometimes fought in a close consecutive fashion. Jastrzab also acknowledged the boss battles as &quot;fearsome and challenging&quot;, but regarded them more admirably.

Brian Gee of &quot;GameRevolution&quot; and Irwin noted that the free-roaming gameplay made it easy for the player to wander into a dungeon with excessively strong enemies. Irwin negatively compared the amount of backtracking in the game&#x27;s vast overworld to &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&quot;, but was thankful for the various modes of transportation that were continuously introduced. The dungeon puzzles were described as simple and easy to decipher. Irwin, comparing the puzzles to &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, welcomed them as breaks from the frequent exploration and battles, as well as an expansion of the game&#x27;s appeal to a broader audience. However, she regarded some of the later puzzles as fetch quests intended solely to lengthen the campaign. While Smith agreed that the quality of the puzzles was not exceptional, he considered them a decent challenge and an improvement over those in &quot;Tales of Destiny&quot;. Metts dismissed the puzzles as &quot;more annoying than challenging and often feel out of place&quot;. Jennifer Tsao of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; opined that the &quot;stingy&quot; save system made the game &quot;a tad too hardcore&quot;.

The visuals were commended for their cel-shading effects and anime-influenced art direction, with Jastrzab saying that the stylish characters, animations and special effects enhanced the game&#x27;s battle sequences. Juba proclaimed the game&#x27;s world to be &quot;one of the most stunning [he has] ever experienced&quot;, likening the presentation to &quot;&quot;Windwaker&quot;-meets-anime&quot;. Smith, however, disliked the lack of detail and facial expression in the character models, remarking that &quot;the rare occasions where they do show emotion come across as disturbingly jarring&quot;. He negatively compared the character designs to Fujishima&#x27;s earlier work in &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot;, saying that &quot;Symphonia&quot;″s characters lacked the personality of those in the preceding title, and claimed that &quot;any number of cheaper artists could have delivered equally inspired designs&quot;. Smith also criticized the cel-shading style as uneven and shaky compared to that of &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot;. The settings were admired for their detail and variety, with some commenting that the background art transitioned well into a 3D format from the classic &quot;Tales&quot; titles. Jastrzab was stunned by the lack of slowdown during the game&#x27;s chaotic action segments, Turner was also amazed by the consistently high framerate, which he regarded as &quot;a great bonus in a time when most RPGs are content to chug at 30 fps]&quot;. Fahey and Jastrzab were disappointed by the game&#x27;s lack of cutscenes in the vein of the traditionally-animated opening cinematic. The in-game cutscenes were described by the &quot;EGM&quot; reviewers and Jastrzab as &quot;dull&quot; and &quot;a little underdone&quot;. Fahey and &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Bethany Massimilla remarked that the game&#x27;s attempt at depth of field effects in some scenes resulted in the characters appearing smeared rather than out-of-focus. The overworld&#x27;s presentation was criticized as underwhelming; some compared its level of detail to titles from the previous generation of consoles, while Jastrzab argued that the quality would not have been passable even in that context. Massimilla additionally faulted the camera in these portions, explaining that it required frequent adjustment and sometimes obscured incoming enemies.

Reactions to the music were mixed; some regarded the score as unremarkable, which was a source of disappointment for Fahey, as he felt the &quot;beautifully constructed&quot; world deserved a more impressive soundtrack. Jastrzab deemed the music &quot;exceptional&quot; and &quot;stellar&quot;, saying that it &quot;captures the mood of the relevant scenarios with virtual perfection while avoiding the repetitious nature of anything related to anime&quot;. Massimilla observed that the soundtrack &quot;[held] true to the &quot;Tales&quot;″ norm of combining wind instruments and bells in pleasing ways for main themes&quot;. Juba, Turner, and Irwin respectively described Sakuraba&#x27;s score as &quot;pretty mellow&quot;, &quot;a typically fine piece of work&quot;, and &quot;pleasantly decent&quot;, though Irwin remarked that the musical variety was relegated to dialogue-oriented events, with the battle and overworld themes taking up most of the playtime.

The voice acting was commended, with Smith remarking that the characters were &quot;more fun to hear than they are to look at&quot;. He added that the repartee between Lloyd and Genis elevated them above their archetypes. Fahey noted that his praise of the voice acting was rare as he was not a fan of dubbing, and was slightly disappointed that the skits were not voiced as well, which he said resulted in them feeling drawn-out. Although Jastrzab approved of the voice acting&#x27;s professional quality, he mentioned that some of the dialogue was not well-placed, explaining that &quot;There is no building of feeling or creation of tension, it pretty much bursts onto the scene&quot;. Irwin considered the delivery to be flat and stilted, observing that &quot;Emotion is often expressed at the wrong times (or not at all) and conversations rarely sound natural&quot;. Turner also deemed the voices to be &quot;so-so&quot;, opining that while the characters&#x27; battle vocalizations were sufficient, the actors lacked the range needed for the more emotionally demanding cutscenes, which he said were held back by &quot;generally inept&quot; direction.

Responses to the narrative were mixed, with some considering the story to be familiar and predictable. The &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; reviewers said that the story was told with &quot;wonderful craft&quot;, and were surprised that the player-controlled character does not carry the &quot;chosen one&quot; role. Jastrzab argued that the story held a &quot;never-ending&quot; depth underneath its surface, which he said was highlighted by the variety of plot outcomes that arose from subtle decisions by the player, though he warned of the script&#x27;s excessive moralizing. Metts agreed that the plot was standard, though he remarked that the set-up was &quot;unusually blunt, in that you are told the implications of the quest right upfront&quot;. However, he proposed that the narrative could assuage GameCube owners desiring a traditional RPG, and described the ending sequence as &quot;beautiful and powerful&quot;. Star Dingo compared the story&#x27;s combination of &quot;heart, warmth, humor, sadness and peril&quot; to the works of Rumiko Takahashi, and proclaimed the writing to be some of the best among console RPGs, elaborating that &quot;the tragedies really strike home, and the characters all have distinct voices, speaking their lines with a welcome sense of subtle irony and self-awareness about RPG clichés&quot;. While Fahry acknowledged that the premise was simple and cliché, he said that the plot twists were well-employed. Irwin was unengaged to the story, which she attributed to what she deemed a flawed localization; she explained that &quot;The dialogue is often awkward and drawn out. Word choice ranges from overly formal to random slang -- the style is all over the linguistic map with little regard to who&#x27;s speaking&quot;. The &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; reviewers and Metts were satisfied with the story&#x27;s pace, while Turner remarked that the narrative meandered at times.

The characters were said to be likable and well-developed. Metts compared the cast to that of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in that they &quot;initially seem simple and stereotypical but almost feel like real people by the end of the story&quot;. Fahey singled out Lloyd&#x27;s development and was thankful that the writers were &quot;of the persuasion which says that dark revelations of the past are not a substitute for creating a proper personality for your characters&quot;. Although Juba regarded the character archetypes as cookie-cutter (apart from Raine, who he described as &quot;seem[ing] to derive sexual pleasure from uncovering archeological artifacts&quot;), he along with Bettenhausen and Massimilla acknowledged that the optional skits substantially contributed to the characters&#x27; depth; Juba additionally compared the skits to the Active Time Event system in &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;. However, Bettenhausen and Massimilla faulted the skits for their slow pace.

===&quot;Remastered&quot;===

&quot;Tales of Symphonia Remastered&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews according to Metacritic. The remaster was faulted for its downgraded and inconsistent framerate, as well as frequent and long load times. Some considered it to be the game&#x27;s worst version, with Noah Leiter of &quot;RPGFan&quot; describing it as an &quot;antithetical runt&quot; to &quot;Metroid Prime Remastered&quot; and the Game Boy emulations for Nintendo Switch Online. Paul Shkreli of &quot;RPGamer&quot; added that selling the remaster at a premium price without the addition of its sequel &quot;Dawn of the New World&quot; felt &quot;both confounding and anti-consumer&quot;, noting that the 2016 Steam release featured everything the remaster offered at half the price. Mitch Vogel of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; agreed that the exclusion of &quot;Dawn of the New World&quot; resulted in an unclear value proposition. Glen Fox of &quot;Gamezebo&quot;, upon establishing that &quot;Tales of Symphonia&quot; is his personal favorite video game, denounced the remaster as &quot;a complete and utter mess&quot;, and expressed bafflement as to why Bandai Namco would allow &quot;one of its most treasured releases from yesteryear&quot; to be released in such a state.

Kirstin Swalley of &quot;Hardcore Gamer&quot; considered the combat simplistic but enjoyable due to the small depths granted by its mechanics, though she warned that it may initially feel clunky to players more accustomed to modern &quot;Tales&quot; titles. Robert Ramsey of &quot;Push Square&quot; observed that, by modern standards, the combat was relatively basic and the controls were slightly stiff, but neverless deemed the fights satisfying because of their pace. Leiter described the combat as smooth, challenging, and rewarding to careful players, but he found the controls to be awkward and delayed. While Shkreli found the combat to be enjoyable without being overwhelming, he experienced difficulty with enemies approaching from multiple angles due to the 2D plane. Vogel cited the same difficulty, remarking that the battles felt stiff compared to similar hack &#x27;n&#x27; slash combat featured in &quot;Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. He added that the inability to cancel out of attack animations, which would incentivize careful timing and skill usage, was complicated by a fast battle pace that encourages reactive and reckless tactics. Swalley and Shkreli commended the variety of puzzles and enemies in the dungeons, with Shkreli calling them elaborate without being inordinate. Ramsey, however, found some of the dungeon designs tedious. Vogel considered the dungeons a highlight in the title&#x27;s conventional gameplay loop, positively comparing their use of puzzles to &quot;Golden Sun&quot;. Jake Dekker of &quot;GameSpot&quot; described the combat as stiff and slow compared to &quot;Tales of Berseria&quot; and &quot;Tales of Arise&quot;, but noted that unlocking more skills eventually made for a more intricate and satisfying experience. He singled out the boss battles as an engaging highlight due to their relatively increased challenge. Swalley noted that the multiple playthroughs required to obtain everything in the game encouraged significant replay value. Ramsey was annoyed by the overworld map camera. Swalley and Dekker complained of frequent game crashes, which were exacerbated by the lack of an autosave feature.

Swalley complimented the key locations as solid and said that the increased crispness and clarity of the character models enhanced their detail and expressiveness, though she felt that some textures &quot;could have used more work&quot;. Vogel and Ramsey said that the visual improvements were negligible apart from the upgraded resolution. Both described the textures as muddy, and while they noted that the art direction was still distinct, Vogel felt that the environment designs lacked a unique visual flair. Leiter also found many textures to be stretched or glossy. Shkreli regarded the art style as timeless and vibrant despite the scaled-down cel-shading effects, but dismissed the overworld as drab and poorly modeled. Fox declared the remaster to be the game&#x27;s ugliest version, citing an unpleasant sharpening effect caused by AI upscaling, missing cel-shading effects, desaturated colors, and missing visual features such as transparent menus and the &quot;screen-shattering&quot; battle transition effect. Dekker faulted the cutscenes as stiff and awkward and the overworld as bland and lifeless.

Swalley maintained that the soundtrack was &quot;fantastic as it ever was&quot;, and marveled at the option to choose between the English and Japanese audio tracks. Ramsey described the soundtrack as &quot;very catchy&quot;, and Leiter regarded Sakuraba&#x27;s score as highly memorable, singling out the battle themes as highlights. However, he cited compressed voice lines as a fault. Shkreli &quot;strongly felt&quot; Sakuraba&#x27;s presence in the battle anthems and village themes.

Ramsey said that while the story was somewhat predictable, the characters were endearing and had great chemistry given by &quot;sharp and often comedic&quot; writing. Leiter called the story a &quot;banger&quot; and enjoyed the novelty of the protagonist playing a supporting role to the &quot;chosen one&quot; character. However, he felt that the story&#x27;s heavy themes of genocide and slavery were sometimes at odds with the light-hearted and humorous tone and mildly cutesy visuals, and considered the presentation of such themes uncarefully handled, referring to the human ranches as &quot;Philosopher’s Stone factory/concentration camps&quot;. Dekker echoed this sentiment, remarking that some of the more emotional moments and darker themes were difficult to take seriously when played out by cutesy characters. Shkreli said that the story&#x27;s &quot;interesting and innovative&quot; twists were still exciting, especially by the game&#x27;s last third. He mentioned that the story&#x27;s emotional center was grounded by the strong characterization between the party members, which he attributed to the optional skits. Vogel was impressed by the ambition in the narrative&#x27;s &quot;shocking&quot; twists despite the initial impression of a &quot;run-of-the-mill exercise in tired tropes&quot;. However, he deemed the &quot;uneven&quot; script to be stiff and unintentionally humorous, elaborating that &quot;Some of these cutscenes cover a ridiculous range of emotions in just a minute or two, and dialogue rarely feels natural—it’s the epitome of a ‘video game script’&quot;. Dekker opined that the rareness of neat resolutions to conflicts improved the story, and he proclaimed that the game&#x27;s cast is still the best in the series, although he said that some awkward localization held these elements back. He criticized the quest-tracking &quot;synopsis&quot; system as occasionally vague, which necessitated consultation of a walkthrough.

<doc id="871840" wikidata="Q239251" url="?curid=871840" title="Mary Ann Nichols">
<text>Mary Ann Nichols, known as Polly Nichols (née Walker; 26 August 184531 August 1888), was the first canonical victim of the unidentified serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, who is believed to have murdered and mutilated at least five women in and around the Whitechapel district of London from late August to early November 1888.

The two previous murders linked to the Whitechapel murderer are unlikely to have been committed by Jack the Ripper. When the murder of Mary Ann Nichols was initially linked to this series, it increased both press and public interest into the criminal activity and general living conditions of the inhabitants of the East End of London.

==Early life==
Mary Ann Nichols was born Mary Ann Walker on 26 August 1845 in either Dean Street, off Fetter Lane in London, or Dawes Court, Shoe Lane (off Fleet Street), London. She was the second of three children born to Edward Walker, a locksmith (later a blacksmith), and Caroline (née Webb), a laundress. Little is known of her early life, although she is known to have been christened by the year 1851.

At age 18, Walker married a printer&#x27;s machinist named William Nichols. The ceremony was conducted on 16 January 1864 at Saint Bride&#x27;s Parish Church in the City of London and was witnessed by two individuals named Seth George Havelly and Sarah Good. Following their marriage, the couple briefly lodged at 30–31 Bouverie Street before residing with Mary Ann&#x27;s father at 131 Trafalgar Street. Between 1866 and 1879, the couple had five children: Edward John (b. 1866), Percy George (b. 1868), Alice Esther (b. 1870), Eliza Sarah (b. 1877), and Henry Alfred (b. 1879). Nichols was tall, had brown eyes, high cheekbones and, at the time of her death, greying dark brown hair.

==Separation==
On 6 September 1880, the couple moved into their own home at 6 D-Block, Peabody Buildings, Stamford Street, Blackfriars Road, paying a weekly rent of 5s. 9d. Shortly thereafter, the couple separated, with William later relocating with four of his children to an address near Old Kent Road.

Nichols&#x27;s father accused William of leaving his daughter after he had conducted an affair with the nurse who had attended the birth of their final child, though William Nichols claimed to have proof that their marriage had continued for at least three years after the date of this alleged affair, claiming their marital troubles had been caused by his wife&#x27;s heavy drinking, and that he had embarked upon an affair only after Nichols had left him. He later maintained to authorities that his wife had deserted him and was practising prostitution.

Over the following years, Nichols amassed a lengthy police record, although all of her arrests were for minor offences such as drunkenness, disorderly conduct, and prostitution.

===1881–1887===
By 1881, Nichols is known to have resided at Lambeth Workhouse, where she described herself as a charwoman. She left this workhouse on 31 May. Her movements over much of the following year are unknown, although on 24 April 1882, she again returned to the Lambeth Workhouse. She is known to have lived with her father in Walworth for several months in 1883 before leaving his residence following a quarrel.

Legally required to support his estranged wife, William Nichols initially paid her a weekly allowance of five shillings until the spring of 1882, when he received word that she was working as a prostitute. Upon hearing this news, he ceased making these payments, causing Nichols to send summons via the Lambeth Union requesting the continuance of this weekly allowance. When parish authorities attempted to collect the maintenance money, William explained his wife had deserted her family, leaving their children in his care, and was living with another man, earning money through prostitution. As he was not legally required to support his wife if she was earning money through illicit means, Nichols no longer received any maintenance payments from her husband.

Nichols spent the majority of her remaining years in workhouses and boarding houses, living off charitable handouts and her meagre earnings as a prostitute, although she frequently spent her earnings on alcohol. By 1887, she had formed a relationship with a widower and father of three named Thomas Stuart Drew, although the couple separated on 24 October. By December 1887, Nichols had begun sleeping rough in Trafalgar Square, although a clearance of the area on 19 December resulted in her returning to Lambeth Workhouse. On this occasion, she remained at this workhouse for less than two weeks.

==1888==
In April 1888, the matron of Lambeth Workhouse, a Mrs Fielder, found Nichols employment as a domestic servant to a Mr and Mrs Cowdry in Wandsworth. Shortly after taking this employment, Nichols is known to have written a letter to her father describing her general contentment with the position, stating: &quot;I just write to say you will be glad to know that I am settled in my new place, and going on all right up to now. My people went out yesterday, and have not returned, so I am in charge. It&#x27;s a grand place inside, with trees and gardens back and front. All has been newly done up. They are teetotallers, and religious, so I ought to get on. They are very nice people, and I have not too much to do. I hope you are all right and the boy has work. So goodbye for the present. From yours truly, Polly.&quot;

Possibly because Nichols was an alcoholic and her employers were teetotallers, she left this employment after three months of service, stealing clothing worth £3 10s. and absconding from the premises. Her father was informed of this fact via postcard on 12 July, in response to his attempted return correspondence with his daughter.

By the summer of 1888, Nichols resided in a common lodging-house at 18 Thrawl Street, Spitalfields, where she shared a bed with an elderly woman named Emily &quot;Nelly&quot; Holland. She relocated to an alternative common lodging-house at 56 Flower and Dean Street, Whitechapel, on 24 August.

===30–31 August===
At approximately 11:00 p.m. on 30 August, Nichols was seen walking along Whitechapel Road. She visited the Frying Pan public house in Brick Lane, Spitalfields, leaving at 12:30 a.m. on 31 August. By 1:20 a.m., she had returned to the kitchen of her Flower and Dean Street lodging-house. Fifty minutes later, she was seen by the deputy lodging house keeper, who asked her for the 4d required for her bed. When Nichols replied she did not have the money, she was ordered to leave the premises. Unconcerned, Nichols motioned to her new black velvet bonnet, replying: &quot;I&#x27;ll soon get my doss money. See what a jolly bonnet I&#x27;ve got now.&quot; She then left the lodging-house with a likely intention of earning the money to pay for a bed via prostituting herself.
Nichols was last seen alive by Emily Holland, walking alone down Osborn Street at approximately 2:30 a.m. (approximately one hour before her death). To Holland, Nichols seemed notably drunk, at one stage slumping against the wall of a grocer&#x27;s shop. Holland attempted to persuade Nichols to return to her Thrawl Street lodging-house, but Nichols refused, stating: &quot;I have had my lodging money three times today, and I have spent it.&quot; Holland noted Nichols seemed unconcerned about her prospects of earning the 4d. required to pay for her bed. The two parted company, with Nichols walking towards Whitechapel Road.

==Murder==
At 3:40 a.m., a carman named Charles Allen Cross (birth name Lechmere) discovered what he initially believed to be a tarpaulin lying on the ground in front of a gated stable entrance in Buck&#x27;s Row (renamed Durward Street in 1892), Whitechapel, as he walked to his place of employment in Broad Street. The location was approximately 150 yards from the London Hospital (now renamed Royal London Hospital) and 100 yards from Blackwall Buildings.

Upon inspecting the object, Cross discovered the tarpaulin was actually the body of a woman. She lay on her back with her eyes open, her legs straight, her skirt raised above her knees and her left hand touching the gate of the stable entrance. Another passing cart driver on his way to work, Robert Paul, approached the location and observed Cross standing in the road, staring at her body. Cross called him over, and both men walked towards the body, which they examined. Cross touched the woman&#x27;s face, which was still warm, then her hands, which were cold. He expressed his opinion to Paul that the woman was dead, but Paul was uncertain and thought she may simply be unconscious. The two pulled her skirt down to cover her lower body, then went in search of a policeman. Upon encountering PC Jonas Mizen at the corner of Hanbury Street and Baker&#x27;s Row, Cross informed the constable of their discovery, adding: &quot;She looks to me to be either dead or drunk, but for my part, I believe she&#x27;s dead.&quot; The two men then continued on their way to work, leaving Mizen to inspect their discovery.
Shortly before Mizen reached Buck&#x27;s Row, PC John Neil approached the street from the opposite direction on his beat, illuminating Nichols&#x27;s body with his lantern. By flashing this lantern, Neil attracted the attention of PC John Thain, as his beat passed the entrance to Buck&#x27;s Row, shouting: &quot;Here&#x27;s a woman with her throat cut. Run at once for Dr Llewellyn.&quot; Neil then inspected the crime scene to look for blood trails with his lantern. He saw none. He also examined the road, but saw no marks of wheels.

PC Thain fetched surgeon Dr Llewellyn, who arrived in Buck&#x27;s Row at 4:00 a.m. Llewellyn observed that two deep knife wounds had been inflicted to the woman&#x27;s throat, and quickly pronounced her life extinct, determining through the fact her body and legs were still warm that she had been dead for approximately 30 minutes. He then ordered PC Neil to remove the body to the Old Montague Street Mortuary upon a handcart Mizen had fetched, stating: &quot;Move the woman to the mortuary; she is dead. I will make a further examination of her.&quot;

As news of the murder spread, many individuals converged on the scene. Among them were three horse slaughterers from a neighbouring knacker&#x27;s yard in Winthrop Street named Harry Tomkins, James Mumford and Charles Britten. Each had been informed of the murder by PC Thain as he walked past them to fetch Dr Llewellyn. All three were interrogated, with Tomkins and Britten admitting to having left their workplace at 12:20 a.m. for approximately thirty minutes, possibly for a drink at the nearby Roebuck public house. All three were eliminated as suspects. Police questioning of all tenants of Buck&#x27;s Row—including the residents of the property closest to where Nichols&#x27;s body was discovered—revealed that although several residents had been awake in the early hours, none had seen or heard anything amiss. All police officers patrolling along or near Buck&#x27;s Row in the early hours of 31 August also reported hearing and seeing nothing suspicious before the discovery of Nichols&#x27;s body.

===Post-mortem===
Nichols&#x27;s body was moved into the Old Montague Street Mortuary at 5:20 a.m. The injuries to her abdomen were discovered by an Inspector Spratling, who immediately sent for Dr Llewellyn, who had initially returned to his home.

Upon further examination of Nichols&#x27;s body, Dr Llewellyn discovered that both sides of her face had been bruised by either a fist or the pressure of a thumb before her throat wounds had been inflicted from left to right. One of these two wounds measured eight inches and the other four inches in length; both reached back to her vertebral column. Her vagina had been stabbed twice, and her abdomen had been mutilated with one deep, jagged wound two or three inches from the left side. Several incisions had also been inflicted across her abdomen, causing her bowels to protrude through the wounds, and three or four similar cuts ran down the right side of her body. These cuts had also been inflicted with the same knife, estimated to be at least 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) long, and possibly a cork-cutter or shoemaker&#x27;s knife. Each wound had been inflicted in a violent and downward thrusting manner. Llewellyn further opined his belief the murderer possessed some anatomical knowledge. No organs were missing.

Llewellyn estimated the injuries would have taken four to five minutes to complete, and also expressed his surprise at the small amount of blood at the crime scene, &quot;about enough to fill two large wine glasses, or half a pint at the outside&quot;. He believed Nichols had been facing her attacker when he had held his hand across her mouth before cutting her throat. Death would have been instantaneous, and all her abdominal injuries, which would have taken less than five minutes to perform, were made by the murderer after she was dead. Llewellyn was able to determine this fact because wounds inflicted to an individual&#x27;s body after death do not result in blood spattering and may not result in an extensive amount of blood loss from the body.

==Identification==
An examination of Nichols&#x27;s possessions revealed she carried no form of identification at the time of her death, with her sole possessions being a white pocket handkerchief, a comb, and a piece of mirror. However, her petticoats were marked &#x27;Lambeth Workhouse P.R.&#x27; indicating she may have resided at the workhouse on Princess Road, which had only opened in 1887. Although the matron of this workhouse was unable to identify the body, a workhouse inmate named Mary Ann Monk positively identified the body as that of Mary Ann Nichols at 7:30 p.m. on 31 August. Earlier the same afternoon, Emily Holland also identified the deceased as &quot;Polly&quot; Nichols. This identification was later corroborated by William Nichols the following day. Reportedly, upon confirming Nichols&#x27;s identity, William had exclaimed: &quot;I forgive you, as you are, for what you have been to me.&quot;

==Inquest==
The official inquest into Nichols&#x27;s death was opened at the Working Lads&#x27; Institute on Whitechapel Road on Saturday, 1 September. This inquest was presided over by the Middlesex coroner, Wynne Edwin Baxter. The first day of the inquest saw the jury duly sworn before being taken by the coroner&#x27;s assistant to view Nichols&#x27;s body at the mortuary in Pavilion Yard before reconvening at the Working Lads&#x27; Institute.

The first day of the inquest heard testimony from three witnesses. The first witness to testify was Nichols&#x27;s father, who stated his daughter had been separated from her husband for &quot;about seven or eight years&quot;, and that he had not seen his daughter since Easter, and that she had no enemies. Also to testify was PC John Neil, who testified to his discovery of Nichols&#x27;s body, adding the actual location of the murder was dimly lit, adding the closest source of illumination was &quot;a street lamp shining at the end of the row&quot;. Describing the crime scene and his summoning of assistance, Neil stated: &quot;Deceased was lying lengthways along the street, her left hand touching the gate. I examined the body by the aid of my lamp, and noticed blood oozing from a wound in the throat. She was lying on her back, with her clothes disarranged. I felt her arm, which was quite warm from the joints upwards. Her eyes were wide open. Her bonnet was off and lying at her side, close to the left hand. I heard a constable passing Brady Street, so I called him.&quot; In response to questioning from the coroner, Neil conceded Whitechapel Road was &quot;fairly busy&quot; even at the time of his discovery of Nichols&#x27;s body, and that her murderer could have escaped in that direction.

The final witness to testify on the first day of the inquest was Dr Llewellyn. His testimony, as reported in &quot;The Times&quot; on 3 September, is as follows:

Following the testimony of Dr Llewellyn, hearings were adjourned until 3 September.

===Police testimony===
Inspector John Spratling gave evidence on the second day of the inquest. Spratling testified to having first heard of the murder at 4:30 a.m., by which time Nichols&#x27;s body had been transferred to the mortuary, and confirmed that only PC Neil&#x27;s beat required him to walk through Buck&#x27;s Row. His subsequent questioning of several residents revealed none had seen or heard anything amiss. Also to testify was horse slaughterer Harry Tomkins, who testified he had not left his place of work after 1:00 a.m. on 31 August and that he and his colleagues had not heard anything untoward. Questioned as to the noise level in his workplace, Tomkins stated his workplace was &quot;very quiet&quot;, although he conceded he had been too far from the crime scene to have heard any cries for help.

Two police officers followed Tomkins to the stand. Inspector Joseph Helson testified to his opinion the decedent had not been carried to the spot where her body was found. PC Jonas Mizen testified to having been informed of a woman lying in Buck&#x27;s Row by a carman at 3:45 a.m. on Friday morning and that when he had arrived at the scene, PC Neil immediately ordered him to fetch a handcart.

Charles Cross followed PC Mizen to the stand. He testified to having discovered Nichols&#x27;s body en route to his workplace, and that he had initially assumed her body to be a tarpaulin, before realising the figure was a woman. He had then heard the footsteps of Robert Paul approaching behind him, and had motioned to him, stating, &quot;Come and look over here; there is a woman lying on the pavement.&quot; Cross testified Paul had touched Nichols&#x27;s heart, stating, &quot;I think she is breathing, but very little, if she is.&quot; As both men were late for work, they had then left the woman, resolving to report their discovery to the first policeman they encountered.

Questioned as to why neither man had noted the wounds to Nichols&#x27;s throat, Cross stated Buck&#x27;s Row was poorly illuminated.

===Character testimony===
William Nichols also testified on the second day of the inquest. He confirmed he had not seen his wife for approximately three years, and that she left him of her own accord due to her alcoholism. He further testified he had no knowledge of his wife&#x27;s whereabouts or activities in the years immediately before her murder.

Two women who had known Nichols in the years following her separation from her husband then testified before the jury. Emily Holland testified she had resided at the same common lodging-house as Nichols in the summer of 1888, and had observed her to be a &quot;quiet woman&quot; who mostly kept to herself. She stated she had not seen Nichols for about ten days prior to encountering her by chance on Osborne Street in the early hours of 31 August, stating she would soon be back at her lodging house. Mary Ann Monk then testified to having observed Nichols entering a pub in New Kent Road at approximately 7:00 p.m. on the evening prior to her murder. Monk also testified she had no knowledge of how Nichols earned her living.

===Day three===
The third day of the inquest was held on Monday 17 September. Eight witnesses testified on this date, including Mrs Emma Green, a widow who lived with her three children in the cottage immediately alongside the stable entrance where Nichols&#x27;s body was found. Green stated she had heard nothing unusual on the night of the murder and that, although rowdy individuals often walked along Buck&#x27;s Row, all the houses were occupied by hardworking individuals. Also to testify was PC John Thain, who stated his beat typically took him past Buck&#x27;s Row every thirty minutes, and that he had been signalled onto Buck&#x27;s Row by PC Neil at 3:45 a.m. Thain testified he had been immediately dispatched to fetch Dr Llewellyn and that the body was taken to the mortuary as he remained in Buck&#x27;s Row. He had then searched Essex Wharf, the Great Eastern Railway arches, and the District Railway for evidence, but had found nothing.

Two of the final witnesses to testify on 17 September were the keeper of the Old Montague Street Mortuary, Robert Mann, and an inmate of the Whitechapel Workhouse named James Hatfield. Mann testified to placing the body inside the mortuary at 5:00 a.m., adding her clothes were not cut before he and Hatfield cut them from her body. Hatfield then testified he and Mann—contrary to instructions given by a Sergeant Enright—had removed all Nichols&#x27;s clothing in preparation for the arrival of Dr Llewellyn.

Following Hatfield&#x27;s testimony, the coroner adjourned proceedings until 22 September.

==Conclusion==
On the final day of hearings, signalman Thomas Ede was recalled to expound upon previous testimony he had provided on the third day of hearings regarding having seen a man named Henry James walking with a knife protruding from his pocket at noon on the date of the murder of Annie Chapman.

At the conclusion of this final day of hearings, coroner Baxter informed the panel the condition of Nichols&#x27;s body appeared to prove conclusively that she had been murdered at the location where her body was found. Referencing the murderer&#x27;s ability to escape detection, Baxter stated: &quot;It seems astonishing, at first thought, that the culprit should have escaped detection, for there must surely have been marks of blood about his person. If, however, blood was principally on his hands, the presence of so many slaughterhouses in the neighbourhood would make the frequenters of this spot familiar with bloodstained clothes and hands, and his appearance might in that way have failed to attract attention while he passed from Buck&#x27;s Row in the twilight into Whitechapel Road, and was lost sight of in the morning&#x27;s market traffic.&quot; Baxter further referenced the two earlier Whitechapel murders and the 8 September murder of Annie Chapman, informing the jury: &quot;We cannot altogether leave unnoticed the fact that the death that you have been investigating is one of four presenting many points of similarity, all of which have occurred within the space of about five months, and all within a very short distance of the place where we are sitting. All four victims were women of middle age, all were married, and had lived apart from their husbands in consequence of intemperate habits, and were at the time of their death leading an irregular life.&quot;

Referencing the direct similarities between Nichols&#x27;s murder and the murder of Annie Chapman as opposed to the earlier murders of Emma Smith and Martha Tabram, Baxter elaborated: &quot;The similarity of the injuries in the [murders of Nichols and Chapman] is considerable. There are bruises about the face in both cases; the head is nearly severed from the body in both cases; there are other dreadful injuries in both cases; and those injuries again have in each case been performed with anatomical knowledge ... I suggest to you as a possibility that these two women may have been murdered by the same man with the same object.&quot; Baxter further dismissed the possibility of Nichols&#x27;s murder being connected with the two previous Whitechapel murders, as the murder weapon used was significantly different in both cases, and neither of these victims had received slash wounds to the throat or any disembowelment.

Following a 20-minute deliberation, the jury, having been instructed to consider precisely how, when, and by what means Nichols came about her death, returned a verdict: &quot;Wilful murder against some person or persons unknown.&quot;
==Press reaction==
Nichols&#x27;s murder had occurred within a 300-yard radius of the previous murders of Emma Smith and Martha Tabram, and all three murders had occurred in the space of less than five months. Although the &quot;modus operandi&quot; of all three murders differed, the geographical similarities led elements of the press to link the three murders. Newspaper editors also suggested Nichols&#x27;s killing may have been perpetrated by a gang, as had earlier been speculated in relation to Smith&#x27;s murder.

In the days following Nichols&#x27;s murder, some sections of the Radical press—in particular reporters within &quot;The Star&quot;—capitalized on the brutal nature of the murders in an effort to vilify Police Commissioner Sir Charles Warren, falsely claiming as early as 1 September that widespread dissatisfaction against Warren existed within the Metropolitan Police. A reporter for &quot;The Star&quot; newspaper named Ernest Parke also suggested in the 31 August edition that a single killer was the culprit. Other publications soon adopted this narrative.

Suspicions a serial killer may be at large in the East End led to the secondment of Detective Inspectors Frederick Abberline, Henry Moore and Walter Andrews from the Central Office at Scotland Yard.

The subsequent murders of Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes the week after the inquest had closed, and that of Mary Jane Kelly on 9 November, were also linked by a similar &quot;modus operandi&quot;, and the murders were blamed by the press and public on a single serial killer, known by October 1888 as &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;.

===Leather Apron===
Local rumours that a local Jew known as &quot;Leather Apron&quot; may have been responsible for the murders were investigated by the police. This individual was known to have carried a knife and to have frequently intimidated local prostitutes. Imaginative descriptions of &quot;Leather Apron&quot;, using crude Jewish stereotypes, frequently appeared in the press in the days following Nichols&#x27;s murder, although some sections of the London press dismissed this theory as &quot;a mythical outgrowth of the reporter&#x27;s fancy&quot;.

John Pizer, a Polish Jew who made footwear from leather, was known by the name &quot;Leather Apron&quot; Despite there being no direct evidence against him, he was arrested by a Sergeant William Thicke on 10 September. Although Pizer claimed to the contrary, Thicke knew of Pizer&#x27;s reputation, and that he was known locally by this name. A search of Pizer&#x27;s home recovered five long-bladed knives. Nonetheless, Pizer was soon released after the confirmation of his alibis on the nights of the two most recent Whitechapel murders.

Pizer later successfully obtained monetary compensation from at least one newspaper that had named him as the murderer.
==Funeral==
Mary Ann Nichols was buried on the afternoon of 6 September 1888. She was laid to rest in the City of London Cemetery, located within the east London district of Manor Park. Her body was transported to the cemetery in a hearse supplied by a Hanbury Street undertaker named Henry Smith. The funeral cortège consisted of the hearse carrying her coffin and two mourning coaches, which carried her father, estranged husband, and three of her children. Several thousand people observed the cortège travel from the mortuary to the cemetery.

Nichols&#x27;s coffin was of polished elm, with a brass plaque bearing the inscription, &quot;Mary Ann Nichols, aged 42; died August 31, 1888&quot;. She was buried in a public grave numbered 210752 (on the edge of the current Memorial Garden).

In late 1996, the cemetery authorities decided to formally mark Nichols&#x27;s unmarked grave with a plaque.

<doc id="871841" wikidata="Q10952676" url="?curid=871841" title="No Fly List">
<text>The No Fly List, maintained by the United States federal government&#x27;s Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), is one of several lists included in algorithmic rulesets used by government agencies and airlines to decide who to allow to board airline flights. The TSC&#x27;s No Fly List is a list of people who are prohibited from boarding commercial aircraft for travel within, into, or out of the United States. This list has also been used to divert aircraft away from U.S. airspace that do not have start- or end-point destinations within the United States. The number of people on the list rises and falls according to threat and intelligence reporting. There were reportedly 16,000 names on the list in 2011, in 2012, and in 2013.

The list—along with the Secondary Security Screening Selection, which tags would-be passengers for extra inspection—was created after the September 11 attacks of 2001. The No Fly List, the Selectee List, and the Terrorist Watch List were created by George W. Bush&#x27;s administration and have continued through the administrations of Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Former U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee chair Dianne Feinstein said in May 2010: &quot;The no-fly list itself is one of our best lines of defense.&quot; However, the list has been criticized on civil liberties and due process grounds, due in part to its potential for ethnic, religious, economic, political, or racial profiling and discrimination. It has raised concerns about privacy and government secrecy and has been criticized as prone to false positives.

The No Fly List is different from the Terrorist Watch List, a much longer list of people said to be suspected of some involvement with terrorism. As of June 2014, the Terrorist Watch List is estimated to contain over 2,484,446 records, consisting of 1,877,139 individual identities.

==History==
Before the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. federal government had a list of 16 people deemed &quot;no transport&quot; because they &quot;presented a specific known or suspected threat to aviation.&quot; The list grew in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, reaching more than 400 names by November 2001, when responsibility for keeping it was transferred to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In mid-December 2001, two lists were created: the &quot;No Fly List&quot; of 594 people to be denied air transport, and the &quot;Selectee&quot; list of 365 people who were to be more carefully searched at airports. By 2002, the two lists combined contained over a thousand names, and by April 2005 contained about names. For the first two and a half years of the program, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) denied that the program existed.

In 2004, then-U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy was denied boarding a flight because his name was similar to an alias found on the No Fly List. Laura K. Donohue would later write in &quot;The Cost of Counterterrorism: Power, Politics, and Liberty&quot; that &quot;antiwar activists, such as Jan Adams and Rebecca Gordan, and political opponents of the Bush administration, such as Senator Edward Kennedy and civil rights attorney David Cole, found themselves included.&quot; In June 2016, Timothy Healy, the former director of the FBI Terrorist Screening Center, disputed the claim that Kennedy had ever appeared on the list, saying that another person with a similar name—who had accidentally tried to bring ammunition on to a plane—was placed on an airline&#x27;s watch list and Kennedy was mistakenly detained by the airline, not based on the No Fly List. In October 2006, CBS News&#x27; &quot;60 Minutes&quot; reported on the program after it obtained a March 2006 copy of the list containing names.

Many individuals were &quot;caught in the system&quot; as a result of sharing the exact or similar name of another person on the list; TSA officials said that, as of November 2005, people in 2005 had complained that their names were matched to a name on the list via the name matching software used by airlines. In January 2006, the FBI and ACLU settled a federal lawsuit, &quot;Gordon v. FBI&quot;, brought by Gordon and Adams under the Freedom of Information Act in order to obtain information about how names were added to the list. Under the settlement, the government paid $200,000 in the plaintiffs&#x27; attorneys&#x27; fees. A separate suit was brought as a class action &quot;filed by people caught in the name game.&quot; In response, &quot;TSA created an ombudsman process, whereby individuals now can download and print out a Passenger Identity Verification Form and mail it, along with certain notarized documents, to the TSA &#x27;so the agency can differentiate the individual from others who may be on the list.&#x27;&quot;

In April 2007, the U.S. federal government&#x27;s &quot;terrorist watch list&quot; administered by the Terrorist Screening Center (which is managed principally by the FBI) contained records. A year later, the ACLU estimated the list to have grown to over names and to be continually expanding. However, according to Homeland Security secretary Michael Chertoff, in October 2008 the No Fly List contained only names, with an additional &quot;selectees&quot; who &quot;represent a less specific security threat and receive extra scrutiny, but are allowed to fly.&quot;

As of 2011, the list contained about 10,000 names. In 2012, the list more than doubled in size, to about 21,000 names. In August 2013, a leak revealed that more than 47,000 people were on the list. In 2016, California Senator Dianne Feinstein disclosed that 81,000 people were on the No Fly List.

There is a huge, secretive US anti-terrorism database for Canada specifically, &quot;Tuscan&quot; (Tipoff US/Canada), revealed by Canada&#x27;s access to information system. The database is used by both the US and Canada, and applies to all borders, not just airports. It is believed to contain information on about 680,000 people thought to be linked with terrorism. The list was created in 1997 as a consular aid. It was repurposed and expanded after 9/11, and again in 2016. The names in Tuscan come from the US Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (Tide), which is vetted by the FBI&#x27;s Terrorist Screening Center and populates various US traveller databases, Canada&#x27;s Tuscan and the Australian equivalent, &quot;Tactics&quot;.

==Weapons purchases by listed persons (No Fly No Buy)==
In a 2010 report, the Government Accountability Office noted that &quot;Membership in a terrorist organization does not prohibit a person from possessing firearms or explosives under current federal law,&quot; and individuals on the No Fly List are not barred from purchasing guns. According to GAO data, between 2004 and 2010, people on terrorism watch lists—including the No Fly List as well as other separate lists—attempted to buy guns and explosives more than 1,400 times, and succeeded 1,321 times (more than 90% of cases).

Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey repeatedly introduced legislation to bar individuals on the terror watch lists (such as the No Fly List) from buying firearms or explosives, but these efforts have not succeeded. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California revived the legislation after the November 2015 Paris attacks and President Barack Obama has called for such legislation to be approved.

Republicans in Congress such as Senate Homeland Security Committee chair Ron Johnson and former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan oppose this measure, citing due process concerns and efficacy, respectively. Republicans have blocked attempts by Democrats to attach these provisions to Republican-backed measures.

The American Civil Liberties Union has voiced opposition to barring weapons sales to individuals listed on the current form of the No Fly List, stating that: &quot;There is no constitutional bar to reasonable regulation of guns, and the No Fly List could serve as one tool for it, but only with major reform.&quot; Specifically, the ACLU&#x27;s position is that the government&#x27;s current redress process—the procedure by which listed individuals can petition for removal from the list—does not meet the requirements of the Constitution&#x27;s Due Process Clause because the process does not &quot;provide meaningful notice of the reasons our clients are blacklisted, the basis for those reasons, and a hearing before a neutral decision-maker.&quot;

In December 2015, Feinstein&#x27;s amendment to bar individuals on the terror watch list from purchasing firearms failed in the Senate on a 45-54 vote. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas put forth a competing proposal to &quot;give the attorney general the power to impose a 72-hour delay for individuals on the terror watch list seeking to purchase a gun and it could become a permanent ban if a judge determines there is probable cause during that time window.&quot; The measure, too, failed, on a 55-45 vote (60 votes were required to proceed). The votes on both the Feinstein measure and the Cornyn measure were largely along party lines.

==Vulnerabilities==

With the aim of preventing individuals on the No Fly List from flying in commercial airliners, U.S. airports require all passengers to show valid picture ID (e.g. a passport or driver&#x27;s license) along with their boarding pass before entering the boarding terminal. At this checkpoint, the name on the ID is matched to that on the boarding pass, but is not recorded. In order to be effective, this practice must assume that 1) the ticket was bought under the passenger&#x27;s real name (at which point the name was recorded and checked against the No Fly List), 2) the boarding pass shown is real, and 3) the ID shown is real. However, the rise of print-at-home boarding passes, which can be easily forged, allows a potential attacker to buy a ticket under someone else&#x27;s name, to go into the boarding terminal using a real ID and a fake boarding pass, and then to fly on the ticket that has someone else&#x27;s name on it. Additionally, a 2007 investigation showed that obviously false IDs could be used when claiming a boarding pass and entering the departures terminal, so a person on the No Fly List can simply travel under a different name.

===False positives===
A &quot;false positive&quot; occurs when a passenger who is not on the No Fly List has a name that matches or is similar to a name on the list. False positive passengers will not be allowed to board a flight unless they can differentiate themselves from the actual person on the list, usually by presenting ID showing their middle name or date of birth. In some cases, false positive passengers have been denied boarding or have missed flights because they could not easily prove that they were not the person on the No Fly List.

====Notable cases====
False positives and abuses that have been in the news include:
* Numerous children (including many under the age of five, and some under the age of one) have generated false positives.
* Daniel Brown, a United States Marine returning from Iraq, was prevented from boarding a flight home in April 2006 because his name matched one on the No Fly List.
* David Fathi, an attorney for the ACLU of Iranian descent and a plaintiff in an ACLU lawsuit, has been arrested and detained because his name was on the No Fly List.
* Asif Iqbal, a management consultant and legal resident of the United States born in Pakistan, plans to sue the U.S. government because he is regularly detained when he tries to fly. He has the same name as a former Guantanamo detainee. Iqbal&#x27;s work requires a lot of travel, and, even though the Guantanamo detainee has been released, his name remains on the No Fly List, and Iqbal the software consultant experiences frequent, unpredictable delays and missed flights. He is pushing for a photo ID and birthdate matching system, in addition to the current system of checking names.
* Robert J. Johnson, a surgeon and a former lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army, was told in 2006 that he was on the list, although he had had no problem in flying the month before. Johnson was running as a Democrat against U.S. Representative John McHugh, a Republican. Johnson wondered whether he was on the list because of his opposition to the Iraq War. He stated, &quot;This could just be a government screw-up, but I don&#x27;t know, and they won&#x27;t tell me.&quot; Later, a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report brought together 12 men named Robert Johnson, all of whom had experienced problems in airports with being pulled aside and interrogated. The report suggested that the individual whose name was intended to be on the list was most likely the Robert Johnson who had been convicted of plotting to bomb a movie theater and a Hindu temple in Toronto.
* In August 2004, Senator Ted Kennedy told a Senate Judiciary Committee discussing the No Fly List that he had appeared on the list and had been repeatedly delayed at airports. He said it had taken him three weeks of appeals directly to Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge to have him removed from the list. Kennedy said he was eventually told that the name &quot;T Kennedy&quot; was added to the list because it was once used as an alias of a suspected terrorist. There are an estimated American men whose legal names correspond to &quot;T Kennedy&quot;. (Senator Kennedy, whose first name was Edward and for whom &quot;Ted&quot; was only a nickname, would not have been one of them.) Recognizing that as a U.S. Senator he was in a privileged position of being able to contact Ridge, Kennedy said of &quot;ordinary citizens&quot;: &quot;How are they going to be able to get to be treated fairly and not have their rights abused?&quot; Former mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani pointed to this incident as an example of the necessity to &quot;rethink aviation security&quot; in an essay on homeland security published while he was seeking the Republican nomination for the 2008 presidential election.
* The late U.S. Representative, former Freedom Rider, and former Chairman of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, John Lewis, was stopped many times in his life.
* Canadian journalist Patrick Martin has been frequently interrogated while traveling, because of a suspicious individual, believed to be a former Provisional Irish Republican Army bombmaker, with the same name.
* Walter F. Murphy, McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence at Princeton, reported that the following exchange took place at Newark on 1 March 2007, where he was denied a boarding pass &quot;because I [Murphy] was on the Terrorist Watch list.&quot; The airline employee asked, &quot;Have you been in any peace marches? We ban a lot of people from flying because of that.&quot; Replied Murphy, &quot;I explained that I had not so marched but had, in September 2006, given a lecture at Princeton, televised and put on the web, highly critical of George Bush for his many violations of the constitution.&quot; To which the airline employee responded, &quot;That&#x27;ll do it.&quot;
* David Nelson, the actor best known for his role on &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;, is among various persons named David Nelson who have been stopped at airports because their name apparently appears on the list.
* Jesselyn Radack, a former United States Department of Justice ethics adviser who argued that John Walker Lindh was entitled to an attorney, was placed on the No Fly List as part of what she believes to be a reprisal for her whistle-blowing.
* In September 2004, former pop singer Cat Stevens (who converted to Islam and changed his name to &quot;Yusuf Islam&quot; in 1978) was denied entry into the U.S. after his name was found on the list.
* In February 2006, U.S. Senator Ted Stevens stated in a committee hearing that his wife Catherine had been subjected to questioning at an airport as to whether she was Cat Stevens due to the similarity of their names.
* U.S. Representative Don Young, the third-most senior Republican in the House, was flagged in 2004 after he was mistaken for a &quot;Donald Lee Young&quot;.
* Some members of the Federal Air Marshal Service have been denied boarding on flights that they were assigned to protect because their names matched those of persons on the No Fly List.
* In August 2008, CNN reported that an airline captain and retired brigadier general of the U.S. Air National Guard has had numerous encounters with security officials when attempting to pilot his own plane.
* After frequently being detained for questioning at airport terminals, a Canadian businessman changed his name to avoid being delayed every time he took a flight.
* In October 2008, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that Maryland State Police classified 53 nonviolent political activists as terrorists, and entered their names and personal information into state and federal databases, with labels indicating that they were terror suspects. The protest groups were also entered as terrorist organizations. During a hearing, it was revealed that these individuals and organizations had been placed in the databases because of a surveillance operation that targeted opponents of the death penalty and the Iraq War.
* In April 2009, TSA refused to allow an Air France flight from Paris to Mexico to cross U.S. airspace because it was carrying Colombian journalist Hernando Calvo Ospina. Air France did not send the passenger manifest to the U.S. authorities; they did however send it to Mexico who forwarded it to the U.S.
* On August 19, 2009, Air France flight AF-438 was not allowed to cross into U.S. airspace because of the presence on board of one Paul-Emile Dupret, a human rights activist and civil servant at the European Parliament.
* Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan was held for extensive questioning by U.S. Immigration and Customs officials in August 2009 because, as he reported, &quot;his name came up on a computer alert list.&quot; Customs officials claimed that he &quot;was questioned as part of a routine process that took 66 minutes.&quot; Khan was visiting the United States to promote his film &quot;My Name Is Khan&quot;, which concerns racial profiling of Muslims in the United States.
* In June 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Yahya Wehelie, a 26-year-old Muslim American man, was being prevented from returning to the United States, and was stranded in Cairo. Despite Wehelie&#x27;s offer to FBI agents to allow them to accompany him on the plane, while shackled, he was not permitted to fly. The ACLU has argued that this constitutes banishment. In July 2010, Wehelie was permitted to fly to New York under a federal waiver.
* A U.S. citizen, stranded in Colombia after being placed on the No Fly List as a result of having studied in Yemen, sought to re-enter the U.S. through Mexico but was returned to Colombia by Mexican authorities.
* Michael Migliore, a 23-year-old Muslim convert and dual citizen of the United States and Italy, was detained in the United Kingdom after traveling there from the U.S. by train and then cruise ship because he was not permitted to fly. He said that he believes he was placed on the no-fly list because he refused to answer questions about a 2010 Portland car bomb plot without his lawyer present. He was released eight or ten hours later, but authorities confiscated his electronic media items, including a cell phone and media player.
* Abe Mashal, a 31-year-old Muslim and United States Marine Veteran, found himself on the No Fly List in April 2010 while attempting to board a plane out of Midway Airport. He was interrogated by the TSA, FBI and Chicago Police at the airport and was told they had no clue why he was on the No Fly List. Once he arrived at home that day two other FBI agents came to his home and used a Do Not Fly question-and-answer sheet to question him. They informed him they had no idea why he was on the No Fly List. In June 2010, those same two FBI agents summoned Mashal to a local hotel and invited him to a private room. They then told him that he was in no trouble and the reason he ended up on the No Fly List was because of possibly sending emails to an American imam they may have been monitoring. They then informed him that if he would go undercover at various local mosques, they could get him off the No Fly List immediately and he would be compensated for such actions. Mashal refused to answer any additional questions without a lawyer present and was told to leave the hotel. Mashal then contacted the ACLU and is now being represented in a class-action lawsuit filed against the TSA, FBI and DHS concerning the legality of the No Fly List and how people end up on it. Mashal feels as if he was blackmailed into becoming an informant by being placed on the No Fly List. Mashal has since appeared on ABC, NBC, PBS and Al Jazeera concerning his inclusion on the No Fly List. He has also written a book about his experience titled &quot;No Spy No Fly.&quot;
* In November 2002 &quot;Salon&quot; reported that the No-Fly program seemed &quot;to be netting mostly priests, elderly nuns, Green Party campaign operatives, left-wing journalists, right-wing activists and people affiliated with Arab or Arab-American groups.&quot; Art dealer Doug Stuber, who ran Ralph Nader&#x27;s Green Party presidential campaign in North Carolina in 2000, was prevented from flying to Europe on business in October 2002. He was repeatedly pulled out of line, held for questioning until his flight left, then told falsely he could take a later flight or depart from a different airport. Barbara Olshansky, then Assistant Legal Director for the Center for Constitutional Rights, noted that she and several of her colleagues received special attention on numerous occasions. On at least one occasion, she was ordered to pull her trousers down in view of other passengers. It is not clear why Stuber was targeted. He was initially pulled aside after loudly declaring to a fellow passenger, &quot;George Bush is as dumb as a rock.&quot; He was on the list for over two years but was later allowed to fly.

====DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program====
The DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP) is a procedure for travelers who are delayed or denied boarding of an aircraft, consistently receive excess scrutiny at security checkpoints, or are denied entry to the U.S. because they are believed to be or are told that they are on a government watch list. The traveler must complete an online application at the Department of Homeland Security website, print and sign the application, and then submit it with copies of several identifying documents. After reviewing their records, DHS notifies the traveler that if any corrections of data about them were warranted, they will be made.

Travelers who apply for redress through TRIP are assigned a record identifier called a &quot;Redress Control Number&quot;. Airline reservations systems allow passengers who have a Redress Control Number to enter it when making their reservation.

DHS TRIP may make it easier for an airline to confirm a traveler&#x27;s identity. False-positive travelers, whose names match or are similar to the names of persons on the No Fly List, will continue to match that name even after using DHS TRIP, so it will not restore a traveler&#x27;s ability to use Internet or curbside check-in or to use an automated kiosk. It does usually help the airline identify the traveler as not being the actual person on the No Fly List, after an airline agent has reviewed their identity documents at check-in.

However, DHS TRIP has not been very helpful to travelers who accidentally end up on the No Fly List, as their efforts to clear their names are often futile to the extent that they are not told why they are on the list.

=== 2023 leak ===

On January 19, 2023, Swiss hacker maia arson crimew reported that she had gained access to 2019 versions of the No Fly List of 1.56 million entries and Selectee List of 250,000 entries posted by CommuteAir on an unsecured Amazon Web Services cloud server. An analysis published in 2024 based on a redacted copy of the leak discusses the over-representation of ethno-religious groups in the list.

== Controversy and criticism ==
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has long criticized the No Fly List and similar lists because of the lack of notification to persons included on such lists. The ACLU&#x27;s stance is that the government has not provided a constitutionally adequate means of allowing individuals to challenge their inclusion on the list and that &quot;constitutional rights are at stake when the government stigmatizes Americans as suspected terrorists and bans them from international travel.&quot;

Among the complaints about the No Fly List is the use of credit reports in calculating the risk score. In response to the controversy, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials said in 2005 that they would not use credit scores to determine passengers&#x27; risk score and that they would comply with all rights guaranteed by the First and Fourth amendments to the United States Constitution.

In the midst of this controversy, the Government Accountability Office of the U.S. Congress produced a report critical of the CAPPS II system. It characterized the proposal as incomplete and seriously behind schedule, and noted that the TSA had failed to address &quot;developmental, operational, and privacy issues identified by Congress&quot;. On July 14, 2004, TSA officials announced that CAPPS II was being pulled from consideration without proceeding to full testing. Critics have alleged that the TSA has merely chosen to start with a less controversial entry point that they are calling the &quot;Registered Traveler&quot; program. TSA has also begun testing of another program called &quot;Secure Flight&quot;, which is supposed to solve some of the problems of CAPPS I while avoiding the privacy issues of CAPPS II.

In January 2009, Marcus Holmes conservatively estimated the total cost of the program to be $536 million since 9/11, with a reasonable estimation range that approaches $1 billion, and he questioned whether the benefits of the list outweigh the costs.

The 2023 leak re-ignited criticisms that the No-Fly list is insufficiently secure. Critics note that if it is not possible to abolish the No-Fly list or make placement on it appealable, Congress should at least review and improve the federal government&#x27;s data security to prevent any future leaks.

=== Lawsuits ===
On April 6, 2004, the American Civil Liberties Union &quot;filed a nationwide class-action challenge to the government&#x27;s No Fly List&quot;, in which they charge that &quot;many innocent travelers who pose no security risk whatsoever are discovering that their government considers them terrorists – and find that they have no way to find out why they are on the list, and no way to clear their names.&quot; The case was settled in 2006, when &quot;the federal government agreed to pay $ in attorneys&#x27; fees to the ACLU of Northern California&quot; and to &quot;[make] public, for the first time, hundreds of records about the government&#x27;s secret &#x27;no fly&#x27; list used to screen airline passengers after September 11, 2001.&quot; On August 5, 2010, the ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of 14 plaintiffs challenging their placement on the No Fly List. and on June 24, 2014, U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown ruled in favor of the plaintiffs saying that air travel is a &quot;sacred&quot; liberty protected by the U.S. Constitution and ordered the government to change its system for challenging inclusion.

A Malaysian academic has been the first to successfully bring a suit involving the No Fly List to trial. On August 18, 2008, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco issued a ruling on behalf of Rahinah Ibrahim, who was a Stanford University graduate student when she was arrested at the San Francisco-Oakland International Airport in 2005, overturning a lower court decision and allowing her case against inclusion in the No Fly List to proceed through the court system. A public trial began on December 2, 2013 in San Francisco in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge William Alsup. After the government revealed that Ibrahim had ended up on the list because of human error by the FBI, Alsup ruled on January 14, 2014 &quot;that Ibrahim did have the right to sue and ordered the government to tell Ibrahim whether she is still on the list.&quot; Ibrahim was represented by the San Jose-based law firm of McManis Faulkner. Ibrahim was awarded $400,000 in court costs; in January 2019 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that she was entitled to the &quot;vast majority&quot; of the millions of dollars in costs her lawyers were requesting, and ordered Alsup to rule on whether the government had acted in bad faith.

Gulet Mohamed, a U.S. citizen from Virginia, was placed on the no-fly list as a teenager in 2011 while he was visiting family in Kuwait. Because he was on the no-fly list, he was unable to return to the U.S. before his visa expired. He was taken into custody in Kuwait for overstaying his visa, where he alleges that he &quot;was repeatedly beaten and tortured by his interrogators&quot;. Kuwaiti authorities tried to deport him to the U.S., but the airline denied him boarding, presumably because he was on the U.S. No Fly List, and he was returned to prison. While he was imprisoned in Kuwait, a lawsuit was filed on his behalf in the Eastern District of Virginia by the Council on American–Islamic Relations. After the lawsuit was filed, he was allowed to return to the U.S.; the U.S. government then moved to dismiss the lawsuit as moot. On May 28, 2013, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the government&#x27;s motion to dismiss Mohamed&#x27;s lawsuit. On January 22, 2014, Judge Anthony J. Trenga denied most of another government motion to dismiss the lawsuit, allowing the case to proceed toward trial.

In 2015 Yonas Fikre of Oregon sued the FBI for harm to his reputation and violation of his due process rights to travel, after he was placed on the No Fly List and then removed. In September 2023, the US Supreme Court agreed to hear the FBI&#x27;s appeal against the litigation.

==No fly lists in other countries==
Canada&#x27;s federal government has created its own no fly list as part of a program called Passenger Protect. The Canadian list incorporates data from domestic and foreign intelligence sources, including the U.S. No Fly List. It contains between 500 and 2,000 names.

In addition, Canada&#x27;s access to information system revealed that the US &quot;Tuscan&quot; (Tipoff US/Canada) database is provided to every Canadian border guard and immigration officer; they have the power to detain, interrogate, arrest and deny entry to anyone listed on it. Unlike the no-fly list, which only applies to airports, Tuscan is used for every Canadian land and sea border, and visa and immigration application.

In Pakistan, the no fly list is known as the Exit Control List.

<text>Sexie was a 2003 stand-up comedy tour by Eddie Izzard. The tour covered Australia, New Zealand, the USA, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland.

Topics covered on this tour include transvestitism, aeroplanes, superheroes, Greek mythology, the planet Mars, the emergency services, sharks, human evolution, dentists, firemen, horses, and the &quot;Baguetti Western&quot; &quot;Blueberry&quot; in which she starred as a German cowboy. As an encore, Eddie does her most recent &quot;bad impression&quot;, Christopher Walken.

The show was released on VHS and DVD on 26 November 2003 (a month before the end of the tour). This performance was recorded in Eastbourne, England (where her grandfather and father were born and where she went to school) at the start of the tour.

&quot;Live from Wembley&quot; is another recording from this tour and is sold on iTunes.

The BBFC gave &quot;Sexie&quot; a &#x27;15&#x27; rating.

<text>The Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck (affectionately known as the &quot;Clunk&quot;) is a Canadian twinjet interceptor/fighter designed and produced by aircraft manufacturer Avro Canada. It has the distinction of being the only Canadian-designed fighter to enter mass production.

Work commenced in October 1946 in response to a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) specification calling for a new jet-powered interceptor/fighter aircraft suitable for long-distance patrol missions and all-weather operations. On 19 January 1950, the &quot;CF-100 Mark 1&quot; prototype, &quot;18101&quot;, conducted its maiden flight, powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Avon RA 3 turbojet engines. Both pre-production and production series aircraft were powered by the domestically-developed Avro Orenda engine instead. Flight testing proved the CF-100 to possess a relatively short takeoff run and a high climb rate, making it well suited to its role as an interceptor. On 18 December 1952, Squadron Leader Janusz Żurakowski, the Avro company chief development test pilot, took the CF-100 Mk 4 prototype up to Mach 1.10 in a dive from , making the type the first straight-winged jet aircraft to achieve controlled supersonic flight.

The CF-100 principally served with the Royal Canadian Air Force and Canadian Armed Forces; it was also procured in small numbers by Belgium to equip the Belgian Air Component. Introduced during 1952 amid the Cold War, the CF-100 was typically deployed at both NATO bases in Europe and in North America as part of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). In addition to the type&#x27;s use by frontline squadrons, it was also supplied to operational training units and frequently used for other secondary duties, including aerial reconnaissance and electronic warfare roles. During the early 1950s, the Avro Canada CF-103, an advanced derivative of the CF-100 that adopted a swept wing and was capable of transonic speeds, was in development, but was terminated. Further development of these concepts ultimately led to the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow.

From 1961, RCAF CF-100s were withdrawn from the interceptor role, replaced by the McDonnell-Douglas CF-101 Voodoo, but some continued on in support roles until 1981, when all remaining examples were withdrawn from service, having been succeeded in some training roles by the Canadair CT-133 Silver Star and in the electronic warfare role by the CC-117 Falcon.

==Design and development==
===Background===
Amid the final years of the Second World War, officials in Canada had concluded both that the development of a self-sufficient indigenous military aviation industry would be of considerable national value and that the new field of jet propulsion held considerable promise. As early as July 1944, Canada had commenced work on its own turbojet engine programme, producing the experimental Avro Canada Chinook powerplant. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, events such as the Korean War and Soviet atomic bomb project had contributed to the rising international tensions of what would become known as the Cold War; the Canadian Government decided to respond by greatly increasing defense expenditure. The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) was a major recipient of the expanded budget, reaching 46.6% of overall defense expenditure during FY 1951–1952, some of which is attributable to several major procurement programmes that were conducted.

During this period, the RCAF had a strong interest in acquiring its own fleet of jet-powered combat aircraft. Specifically, the service had identified a need for a new jet-powered interceptor/fighter aircraft that would be able to patrol the vast areas of Canada&#x27;s north and operate in all weather conditions. Envisaged as a two-seat fighter, to be crewed by a pilot and navigator, it would adopt two powerful engines along with a relatively advanced radar set and fire control system housed in its nose that would enable the aircraft to be operated in all-weather or night conditions. These requirements were formalized by a RCAF specification that was issued during 1946. According to RCAF Air Marshal Wilfred Curtis, there was no existing aircraft that could satisfy the specification, nor was there any suitable aircraft already in development elsewhere, thus it was deemed necessary for Canada to develop such a fighter itself.

On 3 November 1945, an agreement was struck to develop a prototype jet-powered fighter on behalf of the RCAF; on 13 October 1946, the issuing of government contracts to aircraft manufacturer Avro Canada enabled the company to commence the associated design work. Out of this effort would emerge the &quot;XC-100&quot;, a prototype all-weather fighter, which was developed to meet the outstanding specification. Work was initially overseen by Edgar Atkin, Avro Canada&#x27;s Chief Engineer; a key contributor to the programme was ex-de Havilland aircraft designer John Frost, who was appointed chief design engineer for military projects and thus responsible for the CF-100&#x27;s development. At one stage Frost, along with Avro&#x27;s Chief Aerodynamacist Jim Chamberlin, extensively reworked the original design of the fuselage. On 17 May 1949, in response to the programme&#x27;s progress, an additional agreement was reached to produce ten pre-production fighters along with 30 Avro Orendas, an indigenously-developed turbojet engine.

===Flight testing===
The &quot;CF-100 Mark 1&quot; prototype, &quot;18101&quot;, emerged from the factory, painted gloss black overall with white lightning bolts running down the fuselage and engines. On 19 January 1950, the CF-100 prototype flew its maiden flight from Malton, Ontario with Gloster Aircraft Company Chief Test Pilot Squadron Leader Bill Waterton (on loan from Gloster, then also part of the Hawker Siddeley group) at the controls. The Mark 1 was powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Avon RA 3 turbojet engines, each capable of generating a maximum thrust of 28.9 kN (2,950 kgp / 6,500 lbf) thrust. During July 1950, the second prototype, &quot;18102&quot;, performed its first flight. On 5 April 1951, the second prototype was lost in an accident that killed test pilot Bruce Warren. According to aviation author James Dow, this loss resulted in the programme being placed on indefinite hold and questions raised over Avro Canada&#x27;s competency.

In response to the loss and issues encountered, Avro Canada dismissed several members of the design team and established a special working group to rectify a major structural design error identified. To address the latter, a straightforward modification was developed that could be easily retrofitted into the pre-production aircraft. While both prototypes had been powered by Avon engines, the subsequent pre-production and production series aircraft used the locally developed Orenda powerplant instead, the first of which flying during June 1951. As a result of delays encountered in the development of the Orenda, its selection unavoidably impacted the CF-100 programme&#x27;s timetable as well. Dissatisfied with the pace of development, Cabinet Minister C. D. Howe informed Avro to suspend work on all other projects and focus its efforts on completing the CF-100.

Five pre-production &quot;Mk 2&quot; test aircraft (serial numbers &quot;18103&quot;-&quot;18107&quot;) were produced, all fitted with Orenda 2 engines; one was fitted with dual controls and designated a &quot;Mk 2T&quot; trainer. According to pilot Jacqueline Cochran, the Orenda engine responded noticeably smoother than any of the British or American-built jet engines that she had previously flown. Initial teething issues with the pre-production aircraft were soon resolved. The first production version, designated &quot;Mk 3&quot;, made its first flight during October 1952. The Mk 3 incorporated the APG-33 radar and was armed with eight .50 caliber Browning M3 machine guns. The &quot;Mk 3CT&quot; and &quot;Mk 3DT&quot; were again dual control versions supplied to operational training units.

During mid-January 1955, a CF-100 arrived at Eglin AFB, Florida, for cold-weather tests in the climatic hangar. A seven-man RCAF team, headed by Flight Lieutenant B. D. Darling, which had previously conducted tests at Namao Air Base, Alberta, were part of the climatic detachment of &quot;Central Experimental and Proving Establishment&quot;; testing commenced during the following month. In March 1956, a batch of four CF-100 Canucks were dispatched to Eglin AFB to conduct comparative armament trials, where the type was flown by several United States Air Force (USAF) crews. The operational suitability tests, dubbed &quot;Project Banana Belt&quot;, were carried out by the 3241st Test Group (Interceptor) of the APGC&#x27;s &quot;Air Force Operational Test Center&quot;, in conjunction with a project team belonging to the RCAF.

===Production===
During September 1950, the RCAF placed an initial production order for 124 Mk 3 aircraft, the first of which entering service in 1953. This model was armed with eight .50 caliber machine guns. The definitive rocket-armed &quot;Mk 4A&quot; was based on the prototype Mk 4 (a modified Mk 3), which first flew on 11 October 1952. The nose housed the much larger APG-40 radar, while the wings were equipped with wingtip pods, each containing up to 29 Mk 4/Mk 40 &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; folding-fin aerial rocket, to be used in addition to the guns. During 1954, the last 54 of an order for the Mk 3 were swapped for the more advanced &quot;Mk 4&quot;, the total orders for the Mk 4 rose to 510. The &quot;Mk 4B&quot; version was furnished with more powerful Orenda 11s.

Five versions, or marks, were produced. The high-altitude &quot;Mk 5&quot; was the final variant, production of which commenced during 1955. This model featured a -longer wingtip and enlarged tailplane, along with removal of the machine guns. The proposed &quot;Mk 6&quot; was to have mounted Sparrow II missiles and been powered by afterburning Orenda 11IR engines; this was intended to be adopted as an &quot;interim&quot; fighter prior to the introduction of the more advanced Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow, which was then under development. An advanced derivative of the CF-100 was the CF-103, which was equipped with a swept wing and projected to be capable of transonic speeds; this was built in mock-up form during 1951, but was considered obsolete even before the CF-100&#x27;s demonstrated ability to exceed the speed of sound in a dive. On 18 December 1952, Squadron Leader Janusz Żurakowski, the Avro company chief development test pilot, took the CF-100 Mk 4 prototype to Mach 1.0 in a dive from , becoming the first straight-winged jet aircraft to achieve controlled supersonic flight.

==Operational history==

Amongst RCAF pilots, the Canuck was affectionately known as the &quot;Clunk&quot;, the name has been attributed to the noise produced by the forward landing gear during retraction into its well after takeoff. Another common, less attractive, nickname was the &quot;Lead Sled&quot;, a reference to its heavy controls and general lack of maneuverability, a nickname that was shared with a number of other 1950s aircraft. Others included CF-Zero, the Zilch, and the Beast, all references to an aircraft many pilots considered less glamorous than RCAF day fighters like the Canadair Sabre.

Operationally, many CF-100s functioned under the US–Canadian North American Air Defense Command (NORAD), which protected North American airspace from Soviet intruders, particularly the threat posed by nuclear-armed bombers. Additionally, between 1956 and 1962, as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), four CF-100 squadrons were based in Europe with 1 Air Division; for some time, the CF-100 was the only NATO fighter that was capable of operating in zero visibility and poor weather conditions.

Around the start of the Korean War in the early 1950s, the United States Air Force (USAF) found itself in urgent need of a jet-propelled, all-weather, interdiction/surveillance aircraft. This urgency was so great that the USAF was willing to consider two foreign designs: the CF-100 and the English Electric Canberra. Following an evaluation, the CF-100 was rejected due to its insufficient range and payload capabilities; the rival English Electric design was selected and developed into the Martin B-57 Canberra.

At its peak, the CF-100 served with nine RCAF squadrons in the mid-1950s. Four of these squadrons were deployed to Europe under the NIMBLE BAT ferry program, replacing NATO RCAF squadrons equipped with Canadair Sabre day fighters to provide all-weather defense against Soviet intruders. While flown in the North American theatre, the CF-100 would typically retain a natural metal finish; however, those flying overseas were given a British-style disruptive camouflage scheme: dark sea gray and green on top, light sea gray on the bottom.

During his Avro Canada years, the Chief Development Pilot, S/L Żurakowski, continued to fly as an aerobatic display pilot, with spectacular results, especially at the 1955 Farnborough Airshow where he displayed the CF-100 in a &quot;falling-leaf.&quot; He was acclaimed again as the &quot;Great Żura&quot; by many aviation and industry observers who could not believe a large, all-weather fighter could be put through its paces so spectacularly. His performance has been credited with Belgium&#x27;s decision to purchase the CF-100 for the Belgian Air Force. Additional efforts were made to sell the Canuck to several other nations, including the United States, but no other export customers for the type would be secured. Dow reasoned that the Canuck&#x27;s poor overseas sales performance caused officials to have little confidence for exporting other aircraft, including the CF-105 Arrow.

During the type&#x27;s production life, 692 CF-100s of different variants were manufactured, including the 53 aircraft that were delivered to the Belgian Air Force. Although originally designed for only 2,000 flight hours, it was found that the Canuck&#x27;s airframe could serve for over 20,000 hours before needing to be withdrawn. The Belgian aircraft were either scrapped after storage or written off in crashes. Consequently, though the Canadian CF-100 would be replaced in its front line role by the faster CF-101 Voodoo, the Canuck continued to serve with 414 Squadron of the Canadian Forces, based at CFB North Bay, Ontario; during its later years, the type was tasked with aerial reconnaissance, training and electronic warfare missions. It was finally withdrawn from service during 1981. After the CF-100 was retired, a number of aircraft still remain across Canada (and elsewhere) as static displays.

During the late 1950s, an advanced supersonic interceptor, CF-105 Arrow along with the sophisticated Orenda Iroquois engine, was under development by Avro Canada as an intended successor to the CF-100. However, during 1959, work on the CF-105 was terminated following a controversial decision by the Canadian government.

<text>Song of Norway is an operetta written in 1944 by Robert Wright and George Forrest, adapted from the music of Edvard Grieg and the book by Milton Lazarus and Homer Curran. A very loose film adaptation with major changes to both the book and music was released in 1970.

==Stage production==
&quot;Song of Norway&quot; was originally developed and presented in Los Angeles by Edwin Lester&#x27;s Los Angeles Civic Light Opera in 1944, with essentially the same cast as seen later on Broadway. It was also performed in San Francisco. The show opened at the Imperial Theatre in New York on August 21, 1944, and ran for 860 performances. Charles K. Freeman directed while George Balanchine was responsible for the choreography. The sets, costumes, and lighting design was by Lemuel Ayers. while Lawrence Brooks starred as Edvard Grieg. The original Broadway cast featured Irra Petina as a fictional opera singer Louisa Giovanni and Kent Edwards as Elnar. The show featured dances, both ballet and Norwegian folk dances, performed by the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo. Maria Tallchief, one of the featured dancers, married Balanchine during the run of the show. Ballet dancer James Starbuck portrayed the roles of Freddy and Tito in the Broadway production. 

It ran in London for 526 performances at the Palace Theatre, the first Broadway show to cross the Atlantic after the end of the Second World War.

==Story line==
The show is set in and around Norway in Troldhaugen and Bergen; as well as Copenhagen and Rome in and after 1860. It follows the fictionalized lives of three childhood friends: Edvard Grieg (played in New York by Lawrence Brooks), Nina Hagerup (Helena Bliss) and Rikard Nordraak (Robert Shafer). The play tells of the early struggles of Edvard Grieg and his attempts to develop an authentic Norwegian national music. Grieg dreams of being a great composer and these dreams are shared by his friend Nordraak and Grieg&#x27;s sweetheart, Nina. Grieg is lured to Italy by the great prima donna Louisa Giovanni, but he finds he cannot create amid all the glitter and excitement and so returns to Norway and his beloved Nina to write his music.

The melody of the Norwegian National Anthem, &quot;Ja, vi elsker dette landet&quot; was actually written by Rikard Nordraak to lyrics written by the Norwegian national poet, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. Although Nordraak was in fact the composer who wrote the national anthem, he was portrayed as a poet in the show because it was believed &quot;two composers would be confusing&quot;.

==Music==
Songs include &quot;Prelude &amp; Legend&quot; (based on Grieg&#x27;s Piano Concerto in A minor), &quot;Freddy and His Fiddle&quot; (based on &quot;Norwegian Dance No.2&quot;), &quot;Now&quot; (based on Violin Sonata No. 2, and &quot;Waltz&quot; from &quot;Lyric Pieces&quot;), &quot;Strange Music&quot; (based on &quot;Wedding Day at Troldhaugen&quot;), &quot;Midsummer&#x27;s Eve&quot; (based on &quot;One Balmy Summer Eve&quot; from &quot;Five Poems, Op.26&quot;, and &quot;Scherzo in E&quot; from &quot;Lyric Pieces&quot;), and &quot;I Love You&quot; (&quot;Ich Liebe Dich&quot;, from &quot;Melodies of the Heart, Op.5&quot;).

The original Broadway cast recording was released by Decca Records on 6 78-rpm 12 inch discs. Irra Petina was under contract to a competing record label (Columbia), so her part in the &quot;original cast&quot; was sung by Kitty Carlisle, who never actually played the part on Broadway. Decca later released a 33 rpm single disc LP, with some edits to fit the single-disc medium. In 2004, Decca finally released the full original album on CD. Columbia Records made a recording in 1959 of the Jones Beach production (which opened in June 1958) with Brenda Lewis and John Reardon, which was released on CD by Masterworks Broadway.

<doc id="871879" wikidata="Q1106192" url="?curid=871879" title="Balloon catheter">
<text>A balloon catheter is a type of &quot;soft&quot; catheter with an inflatable &quot;balloon&quot; at its tip which is used during a catheterization procedure to enlarge a narrow opening or passage within the body. The deflated balloon catheter is positioned, then inflated to perform the necessary procedure, and deflated again in order to be removed.

Some common uses include:
*angioplasty or balloon septostomy, via cardiac catheterization (heart cath)
*tuboplasty via uterine catheterization
*pyeloplasty using a detachable inflatable balloon stent positioned via a cystoscopic transvesicular approach.

== Angioplasty balloon catheters ==

Balloon catheters used in angioplasty are either of Over-the-Wire (OTW) or Rapid Exchange (Rx) design. Rx catheters nowadays are about 90% of the Coronary Intervention market. While OTW Catheters may still be useful in highly tortuous vascular pathways, they sacrifice deflation time and pushability. When a balloon catheter is used to compress plaque within a clogged coronary artery, it is referred to as a &quot;plain old balloon angioplasty&quot; or POBA. Balloon catheters are also utilized in the deployment of stents during angioplasty. Balloon catheters are supplied to the cath lab with a stent pre-mounted on the balloon. When the cardiologist inflates the balloon it expands the stent. When the cardiologist subsequently deflates the balloon, the stent stays behind in the artery and the balloon catheter can be removed. Stents that are used in conjunction with a balloon catheter are known as balloon expandable stents, as opposed to self-expandable stents, typically made of Nitinol alloy or polyester.

==Ureteric (pyeloplasty) balloon catheter==

Ureteric balloon catheters are used to treat ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstructions caused by intrinsic wall factors as fibrosis and / or hypertrophic wall problems. They can also help to solve Brickers bladder (also called Ileal conduit) problems. Their application is significantly less invasive than other treatments for obstructive uropathy.

<doc id="871887" wikidata="Q472694" url="?curid=871887" title="Fokker XB-8">
<text>The Fokker XB-8 was a bomber built for the United States Army Air Corps in the 1930s, derived from the high-speed Fokker O-27 observation aircraft.

==Design and development==

During assembly, the second prototype XO-27 was converted to a bomber prototype, dubbed the XB-8. While the XB-8 was much faster than existing biplane bombers, it did not have the bomb capacity to be considered for production. Two YB-8s and 4 Y1B-8s were ordered, but these were changed mid-production to Y1O-27 configuration.

The wing of the XB-8 and XO-27 was built entirely from wood, although the fuselage was constructed of steel tubes covered with fabric with the exception of the nose which had a corrugated metal. They featured the first retractable landing gear ever fitted to an Army Air Corps bomber or observation craft. The undercarriage retracted electrically. The crew was three in tandem position.

==Operational history==
It competed against the Douglas Y1B-7/XO-36. Both promised to greatly exceed the performance of the large biplane bombers then used by the Army Air Corps. However, the Douglas XB-7 was markedly better in performance than the XB-8, and no further versions of Fokker&#x27;s aircraft were built.

<doc id="871888" wikidata="Q1364180" url="?curid=871888" title="Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester">
<text>Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester (1104 – 5 April 1168) was Justiciar of England 1155–1168.

The surname &quot;de Beaumont&quot; was given to him by genealogists. The only known contemporary surname applied to him is &quot;Robert son of Count Robert&quot;. Henry Knighton, a fourteenth-century chronicler, calls him Robert &quot;Le Bossu&quot; (meaning &quot;Robert the Hunchback&quot; in French). The manuscript &quot;Genelogies of the Erles of Lecestre and Chester&quot; states that he was &quot;surnamed Boissu&quot;, and mentions him by the names Robert Boissu, Robert Beamond and Robert Beaumonde.

== Early life and education ==
Robert was an English nobleman of Norman-French ancestry. He was the son of Robert de Beaumont, Count of Meulan and 1st Earl of Leicester, and Elizabeth de Vermandois, and the twin brother of Waleran de Beaumont. It is not known whether they were identical or fraternal twins, but the fact that they are remarked on by contemporaries as twins probably indicates that they were identical.

The two brothers, Robert and Waleran, were adopted into the royal household shortly after their father&#x27;s death in June 1118 (upon which Robert inherited his father&#x27;s second title of Earl of Leicester). Their lands on either side of the Channel were committed to a group of guardians, led by their stepfather, William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey. They accompanied King Henry I to Normandy, to meet with Pope Callixtus II in 1119, when the king incited them to debate philosophy with the cardinals.

Both twins were literate, and Abingdon Abbey later claimed to have been Robert&#x27;s school, but though this is possible, its account is not entirely trustworthy. An early treatise on astronomy (the &quot;Leicester &quot;Iudicia&quot;&quot;) carries a dedication &quot;to Earl Robert of Leicester, that man of affairs and profound learning, most accomplished in matters of law&quot; who can only be this Robert. On his death he left his own psalter to the abbey he founded at Leicester, which was still in its library in the late fifteenth century. The existence of this indicates that like many noblemen of his day, Robert followed the canonical hours in his chapel.

== Career at the Norman court ==
In 1120 Robert was declared of age and inherited most of his father&#x27;s lands in England, while his twin brother took the French lands. However, in 1121 royal favor brought to Robert the great Norman Honors of Breteuil and Pacy-sur-Eure, through his marriage to Amice de Gael, daughter of a Breton noble whom the king had imposed upon the Honor after the forfeiture of the Breteuil family in 1119. Robert spent a good deal of his time and resources over the next decade integrating the troublesome and independent barons of Breteuil into the greater complex of his estates. He did not join in his brother&#x27;s great Norman rebellion against King Henry I in 1123–24. He appears fitfully at Henry I&#x27;s royal court (despite his brother&#x27;s imprisonment) until 1129, but thereafter the twins were frequently there together.

Robert held lands throughout England. During the 1120s and 1130s, he tried to rationalize his estates in Leicestershire. Leicestershire estates of the See of Lincoln and the Earl of Chester were seized by force. This helped to consolidate Robert&#x27;s various estates in the central midlands, which were bounded by Nuneaton, Loughborough, Melton Mowbray and Market Harborough.

In 1135, the twins were present at King Henry&#x27;s deathbed. Robert&#x27;s actions in the succession period are unknown, but he clearly supported his brother&#x27;s decision to join the court of the new king Stephen before Easter 1136. During the first two years of the reign, Robert is found in Normandy fighting rival claimants for his Honor of Breteuil. Military action allowed him to add the castle of Pont St-Pierre to his Norman estates in June 1136 at the expense of one of his rivals. From the end of 1137, Robert and his brother were increasingly caught up in the politics of the court of King Stephen in England, where Waleran secured an ascendancy that lasted until the beginning of 1141. Robert participated in his brother&#x27;s political coup against the king&#x27;s justiciar, Roger of Salisbury (the Bishop of Salisbury).

== Civil war in England ==
The outbreak of civil war in England in September 1139 brought Robert into conflict with Earl Robert of Gloucester, the bastard son of Henry I and principal sponsor of the Empress Matilda. His port of Wareham and estates in Dorset were seized by Gloucester in the first campaign of the war. In that campaign the king awarded Robert the city and castle of Hereford as a bid to establish the earl as his lieutenant in Herefordshire, which was in revolt. It is disputed by scholars whether this was an award of a second county to Earl Robert. Probably late in 1139, Earl Robert refounded his father&#x27;s collegiate church of St Mary de Castro in Leicester as a major Augustinian abbey on the meadows outside the town&#x27;s north gate, annexing the college&#x27;s considerable endowment to the abbey.

The battle of Lincoln on 2 February 1141 saw the capture and imprisonment of King Stephen. Although Count Waleran valiantly continued the royalist fight in England into the summer, he eventually capitulated to the Empress and crossed back to Normandy to make his peace with the Empress&#x27;s husband, Geoffrey of Anjou. Earl Robert had been in Normandy since 1140 attempting to stem the Angevin invasion, and negotiating the terms of his brother&#x27;s surrender. He quit Normandy soon after and his Norman estates were confiscated and used to reward Norman followers of the Empress. Earl Robert remained on his estates in England for the remainder of King Stephen&#x27;s reign. Although he was a nominal supporter of the king, there seems to have been little contact between him and Stephen, who did not confirm the foundation of Leicester Abbey till 1153. 

Earl Robert&#x27;s principal activity between 1141 and 1149 was his private war with Ranulf II, Earl of Chester. Though details are obscure it seems clear enough that he waged a dogged war with his rival, which in the end secured his control of northern Leicestershire and the strategic Chester castle of Mountsorrel. When Earl Robert of Gloucester died in 1147, Robert of Leicester led the movement among the greater earls of England to negotiate private treaties to establish peace in their areas, a process hastened by the Empress&#x27;s departure to Normandy, and completed by 1149. During this time the earl also exercised supervision over his twin brother&#x27;s earldom of Worcester, and in 1151 he intervened to frustrate the king&#x27;s attempts to seize the city.

== Earl Robert and Henry Plantagenet ==
The arrival in England of Duke Henry, son of the Empress Matilda, in January 1153 was a great opportunity for Earl Robert. He was probably in negotiation with Henry in that spring, and reached an agreement under which he defected to him by May 1153, when the duke restored his Norman estates to the earl. The duke celebrated his Pentecost court at Leicester in June 1153, and he and the earl were constantly in company until the peace settlement between the duke and the king at Winchester in November 1153. Earl Robert crossed with the duke to Normandy in January 1154 and resumed his Norman castles and honours. As part of the settlement, his claim to be chief steward of England and Normandy was recognised by Henry.

Earl Robert began his career as chief justiciar of England probably as soon as Duke Henry succeeded as King Henry II in October 1154. The office gave the earl supervision of the administration and legal process in England whether the king was present in, or absent from the realm. He appears in that capacity in numerous administrative acts, and had a junior colleague in the post in Richard de Luci, another former servant of King Stephen. The earl filled the office for nearly fourteen years until his death, and earned the respect of the emerging Angevin bureaucracy in England. His opinion was quoted by learned clerics, and his own learning was highly commended.

He died on 5 April 1168, probably at his Northamptonshire castle of Brackley, for his entrails were buried at the hospital in the town. He was received as a canon of Leicester on his deathbed, and buried to the north of the high altar of the great abbey he had founded and built. He left a written testament of which his son the third earl was an executor, as we learn in a reference dating to 1174.

== Church patronage ==
Robert founded and patronised many religious establishments. He founded Leicester Abbey (1144) and Garendon Abbey (1133) in Leicestershire, the Fontevraldine Nuneaton Priory in Warwickshire, Luffield Priory in Northamptonshire, and made endowments to the hospital of Brackley, Northamptonshire. He refounded the collegiate church of St Mary de Castro, Leicester, as a dependency of Leicester Abbey around 1164, after suppressing it in 1139. Around 1139 he refounded the collegiate church of Wareham as a priory of his Abbey of Lyre, in Eure, Normandy. His principal Norman foundations were the priory of Nôtre-Dame du Désert in the Forest of Breteuil, and a major hospital in Breteuil itself (Eure). He was a generous benefactor of the Benedictine Abbey of Lyre, the oldest monastic house in the Honour of Breteuil. He also donated land in Old Dalby, Leicestershire to the Knights Hospitallers who used it to found Dalby Preceptory.

About the year 1150, Robert le Bossu, Earl of Leicester, gave to one Solomon, a clerk, an acre of land at Brackley on which to build a house of hospitality for the poor, together with a free chapel and graveyard.

==Family and children==
Robert married after 1120 Amice de Gael, daughter of Raoul II de Gael, himself a son of Ralph de Gael, Earl of East Anglia and Emma Fitz Osborn Both families had lost their English inheritances through rebellion in 1075. They had four children:
#Hawise de Beaumont, who married William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester and had descendants.
#Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester who married Petronilla de Grandmesnil and had descendants.
#Isabel, who married Simon de St. Liz, Earl of Huntingdon and had descendants.
#Margaret, who married Ralph IV de Toeni and had descendants through their daughter, Ida de Tosny.

==Literary references==
He is a major character in &quot;The Holy Thief&quot; and a minor character in &quot;Brother Cadfael&#x27;s Penance&quot;, of the Brother Cadfael series by Ellis Peters. He is also a major character in Cecelia Holland&#x27;s novel &quot;The Earl&quot;.

<text>Otto Witt (1875–1923) was a Swedish writer. He was one of the prominent figures in early Swedish science fiction. He did, among other things, publish Hugin, a science magazine which was filled &quot;with speculative
articles and fiction&quot;. &quot;Hugin&quot; was one of the first magazines to regularly carry science fiction 
in the world, although it appears to have had little influence outside Sweden.

<text>The Khronos Group, Inc. is an open, non-profit, member-driven consortium of 170 organizations developing, publishing and maintaining royalty-free interoperability standards for 3D graphics, virtual reality, augmented reality, parallel computation, vision acceleration and machine learning. The open standards and associated conformance tests enable software applications and middleware to effectively harness authoring and accelerated playback of dynamic media across a wide variety of platforms and devices. The group is based in Beaverton, Oregon.

== History ==
The Khronos Group was founded in 2000 by companies including 3Dlabs, ATI, Discreet, Evans &amp; Sutherland, Intel, SGI, and Sun Microsystems. Promoter members include AMD, Apple, Arm, Epic Games, Google, Huawei, Nokia, Imagination, Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Samsung, Sony, Valve and Verisilicon. Its president is Neil Trevett.

==Exploratory groups==
Typically, Khronos first creates an exploratory group to gauge industry interest before creating a working group, which companies can join as members to assist in the development of the standard.

== Specifications and working groups ==
Each specification / standard is managed by a working group which is established to define the requirements, solicit input, discuss, and create a specification. There are currently 16 working groups.

==Standards and other activities==
=== Active standards ===
* 3D Commerce, universal guidelines, standards and certifications for 3D content creation and distribution in e-commerce
* ANARI, Analytic Rendering Interface for Data Visualization
* Camera, working on interoperable camera API standards for embedded systems, a cooperation with the European Machine Vision Association (EMVA)
*COLLADA, a file-format intended to facilitate interchange of 3D assets
* EGL, an interface between Khronos rendering APIs (such as OpenGL ES or OpenVG) and the underlying native platform window system
* glTF, a file format specification for 3D scenes and models
* KTX, a container file format for storing GPU-ready texture data
* NNEF reduces machine learning deployment fragmentation by enabling a rich mix of neural network training tools and inference engines to be used by applications across a diverse range of devices and platforms
* OpenCL, a cross-platform computation API
* OpenGL, a cross-platform computer graphics API

==Members==
===Membership and contributions===
Khronos members may contribute to the development of Khronos API specifications, vote at various stages before public deployment, and accelerate delivery of their platforms and applications through early access to specification drafts and conformance tests. To ensure that the standards are consistently implemented and to create a reliable platform for developers, any product that implements a Khronos API standard must pass conformance tests. An API Adopter Program enables companies to test their products for conformance. Membership in Khronos Group provides access to an IP framework designed to protect participant IP. Khronos members agree not to assert IP rights against adopters implementing Khronos specifications. The IP framework protects Khronos members from exposure to patent lawsuits and reduces the amount of IP that needs to be licensed from other group members.

===Membership levels===
*Promoter: Full working group participation with voting rights, plus the right to designate a Director to the Khronos Board.
*Contributor: Full working group participation with voting rights.
*Non-Profit: Full working group participation. Available to registered non-profit organizations.
*Academic: Full working group participation. Available to accredited academic institutions.
*Associate: Full working group participation. Available to companies with up to 100 employees.

<text>Artemis Fowl is a young adult fantasy novel written by Irish author Eoin Colfer. It is the first book in the &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; series, followed by &quot;Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident&quot;. Pitched by its author as &quot;&quot;Die Hard&quot; with fairies&quot;, the novel follows fairy LEP reconnaissance officer Holly Short (based on John McClane and Holly Gennero McClane) after she is kidnapped by twelve-year-old criminal mastermind Artemis Fowl II (based on Hans Gruber) for a large ransom of gold.

Throughout the book, the third-person narration switches from following the human characters to following the fairy characters to present underlying themes of greed and conflict. The book received a mostly favourable critical response and several awards. A film adaptation titled &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 12 June 2020 and in the United States on 10 September 2021, by Walt Disney Pictures.

== Synopsis ==
Captain Holly Short, an elf in the Lower Elements Police (LEP), is tracking a rogue troll that has managed to reach the surface of the Earth from Haven City, thousands of feet underground. Assisted by the technically minded centaur Foaly and LEPrecon commander Julius Root, she incapacitates the troll before leaving for Tara to replenish her magic.

Meanwhile, Artemis Fowl II is a 12-year-old prodigy who has dedicated his life to criminal activities. He leads the Fowl criminal empire, which has existed in his family for generations. After significant research, Artemis believes that he has confirmed the existence of fairies. He identifies an alcoholic sprite living in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and travels there with his bodyguard Butler to obtain from her &quot;The Book of the People&quot;—the fairy holy book that is written in Gnommish. After decoding the book using translating software, Artemis learns the specifics of the ritual fairies use to replenish their magic: take an acorn from an ancient oak tree near a bend in a river under the full moon and plant it elsewhere. Artemis and Butler track down 129 possible nearby locations for the ritual and start a stakeout. They discover Holly performing the ritual, and Butler tranquillises her with a hypodermic dart gun.

After being led onto Fowl&#x27;s ship by Holly&#x27;s tracker, Artemis tells Commander Root his name so they can find him, and then blows the ship up. An LEP retrieval team is sent to scout Fowl Manor using their &#x27;shielding&#x27; ability, which allows them to vibrate faster than the human eye can follow. The team enters the manor grounds, where Artemis has installed a camera with a high frames-per-second rate, allowing him to detect the threat. After Butler incapacitates the intruders, Root decides to lay siege to Fowl Manor using a time-stop and enter negotiations. Artemis states his ransom demand: one ton of 24-carat gold. Artemis also reveals his knowledge of the time-stop and claims that he can escape it. An analysis by LEP behaviour experts determines that Artemis believes he is telling the truth.

The attempts to gain entry to the manor continue as the LEP recruits an infamous criminal, the kleptomaniac dwarf Mulch Diggums, to break in. Fairies normally cannot enter human dwellings without permission, but Mulch has forfeited the magic preventing him from entering dwellings, causing him to be safe when burglarising. He tunnels underground to reach the house while Foaly feeds a loop to the manor surveillance system, allowing Mulch to freely explore. Mulch accidentally locates a safe containing Artemis&#x27; copy of the book, revealing to the fairies the source of Artemis&#x27; knowledge, which he had led them to believe he had acquired from a truth serum administered to Holly. The Fairy Council, deciding that nothing is working, promotes a lieutenant called Briar Cudgeon to acting commander, temporarily usurping Julius Root. Meanwhile, Holly cracks through the concrete of her cell, finding fresh dirt, and completes the ritual with a smuggled acorn. Having regained her magic, she escapes into the main house.

Cudgeon decides to release the troll Holly captured earlier, into the mansion, to force Artemis to allow the fairies to enter and subdue the troll. This backfires, as Butler, aided by Holly&#x27;s healing powers, defeats the troll. The Fairy Council subsequently strips Cudgeon of his post.

Artemis is finally granted the ransom. The gold is sent in and Artemis asks Holly for a wish: to cure his mother&#x27;s insanity—she has been living in her bedroom, driven mad by the loss of her husband. Holly grants the wish at the cost of half the gold. The LEP decides to send in a &quot;blue rinse&quot;—a biological bomb that kills all organic life—to eliminate Artemis and allow for the retrieval of the gold, but this fails when Artemis discovers how to escape the time field and escapes the time-stop by drugging himself and his comrades with sleeping pills.

As Artemis has survived until the end of the time-stop, the LEP is bound by law to leave the remaining gold and depart. In the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly&#x27;s magic.

== Themes ==
&quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; has a number of underlying themes, but the most essential of these are greed and the conflict between good and evil.

Greed is the first main theme that is introduced into the book, and specifically the desire to obtain gold. In a similar manner to other themes in the book, it changes throughout, becoming less of a focus near to the end of the novel, where Artemis is (grudgingly) willing to part with a large sum of money to help someone else.

The idea of conflict between good and evil is one that is touched upon in the book in a light-hearted manner. Although Artemis sees himself as an evil genius at the beginning of the book, and is portrayed as such, the end of the story contradicts this image when he pays the fairy Holly to help his mother. Artemis&#x27;s enemies, the fairies, would be &quot;the good side&quot;, but their actions call this view into question—they are as determined as Artemis is to achieve their goals. While only some of them are willing to ruthlessly deploy a troll, regardless of the possible danger to life, all are willing to utilise a bio-bomb once Holly is out of the mansion, to eliminate Artemis.

== Critical reception ==
In general, the book received a very positive critical response—in 2004 it received the Young Reader&#x27;s Choice Award and Garden State Teen Book Award, among other awards.

The &quot;New York Post&quot; said &quot;Artemis Fowl is great ... a new thriller fairy tale that will grab your interest, no matter your age.&quot; and the &quot;Library Journal&quot; said &quot;Fun to read, full of action and humour, this is recommended for all public libraries and to readers of all ages.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; is pacy, playful, and very funny, an inventive mix of myth and modernity, magic and crime&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; said that &quot;Colfer has done enormously, explosively well.&quot;

Kate Kellaway of &quot;the Observer&quot; called the book &quot;a smart, amusing one-off. It flashes with hi-tech invention—as if Colfer were as much an inspired as a writer.&quot; The Amazon.com official review highly complimented the book, saying &quot;Fantastic stuff from beginning to end, Artemis Fowl is a rip-roaring, 21st century romp of the highest order.&quot;

However, another &quot;Time&quot; magazine review criticised the &quot;abysmal&quot; writing and the characterisation, calling Artemis&#x27; character &quot;repellent in almost every regard.&quot; It concluded that &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; is &quot;an awkward, calculated, humorless and mean-spirited book.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; review concluded: &quot;All the familiar action-flick clichés are trotted out: the backstabbing, politically astute subordinate; the seemingly loony but loyal computer expert; the dabs of family loyalty; the requisite happy ending; the utterly unsubtle plugs for the sequel; the big action scenes. ... Resist the hype, parents, booksellers and librarians. This is not the new Harry Potter, nor is it a good children&#x27;s book.&quot;

==Adaptations==

=== Film ===

In 2001, plans were announced for a film adaptation of the series. Miramax Films was named as purchasing the film rights, with Lawrence Guterman signed to direct. In 2003 Colfer stated that a screenplay had been finalised and that casting was due to start the same year, but expressed scepticism over whether or not this would come to pass. The film remained in development and was assumed to be in development hell until 2011, when it was reported that Jim Sheridan was interested in directing the film. In July 2013, it was announced that Disney was developing a project based on the first and second instalment of the &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; series. Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal would be the executive producers and Kenneth Branagh would direct. The film was originally scheduled for a theatrical release on 9 August 2019 by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, but on 7 May 2019 the film was delayed to 29 May 2020. On 3 April the film&#x27;s theatrical release was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and instead it debuted on Disney+ on 12 June 2020. The film was later removed from the streaming service on 26 May 2023 as part of a Disney+ and Hulu purge.

=== Graphic novel ===
&quot;Artemis Fowl: The Graphic Novel&quot; is a graphic novel based on the book. Written by Colfer and adapted by Andrew Donkin with the art by Giovanni Rigano, the graphic novel was released on 2 October 2007. The plot remains the same as the book&#x27;s except some minor details. Some characters&#x27; appearances differed from their description in the book; Holly Short&#x27;s hair is longer than described in the book and a darker brown, as opposed to the reddish brown described in the book, and her skin appears noticeably lighter than the nut-brown coffee-like complexion she had previously been described as possessing. Haven City&#x27;s roof is stalactites and rock as opposed to the computer-generated sky described by the book. The graphic novel does not contain many word balloons, showing each character&#x27;s story in first person. Graphic novels for subsequent books in the series were released in 2009, 2013 and 2014.

Later, in 2019, in promotion of the upcoming 2020 film, Disney released a new version of the graphic novel, this time adapted by Michael Moreci and drawn by Stephen Giplin. It skims over the therapist reports and cuts out the second scene of Artemis and his mother for pacing.

<text>Laboratory robotics is the act of using robots in biology, chemistry or engineering labs. For example, pharmaceutical companies employ robots to move biological or chemical samples around to synthesize novel chemical entities or to test pharmaceutical value of existing chemical matter. Advanced laboratory robotics can be used to completely automate the process of science, as in the Robot Scientist project.

Laboratory processes are suited for robotic automation as the processes are composed of repetitive movements (e.g., pick/place, liquid/solid additions, heating/cooling, mixing, shaking, and testing). Many laboratory robots are commonly referred as autosamplers, as their main task is to provide continuous samples for analytical devices.

==History==
The first compact computer controlled robotic arms appeared in the early 1980s, and have continuously been employed in laboratories since then. These robots can be programmed to perform many different tasks, including sample preparation and handling.

Yet in the early 1980s, a group led by Masahide Sasaki, from Kochi Medical School, introduced the first fully automated laboratory employing several robotic arms working together with conveyor belts and automated analyzers. The success of Sasaki&#x27;s pioneer efforts made other groups around the world to adopt the approach of Total Laboratory Automation (TLA).

Despite the undeniable success of TLA, its multimillion-dollar cost prevented that most laboratories adopted it. Also, the lack of communication between different devices slowed down the development of automation solutions for different applications, while contributing to keeping costs high. Therefore, the industry attempted several times to develop standards that different vendors would follow in order to enable communication between their devices. However, the success of this approach has been only partial, as nowadays many laboratories still do not employ robots for many tasks due to their high costs.

Recently, a different solution for the problem became available, enabling the use of inexpensive devices, including open-source hardware, to perform many different tasks in the laboratory. This solution is the use of scripting languages that can control mouse clicks and keyboard inputs, like AutoIt. This way, it is possible to integrate any device by any manufacturer as long as they are controlled by a computer, which is often the case.

Another important development in robotics which has important potential implications for laboratories is the arrival of robots that do not demand special training for their programming, like Baxter, the robot.

==Applications==

=== Low-cost laboratory robotics ===

The high cost of many laboratory robots has inhibited their adoption. However, currently there are many robotic devices that have very low cost, and these could be employed to do some jobs in a laboratory. For example, a low-cost robotic arm was employed to perform several different kinds of water analysis, without loss of performance compared to much more expensive autosamplers. Alternatively, the autosampler of a device can be used with another device, thus avoiding the need for purchasing a different autosampler or hiring a technician for doing the job. The key aspects to achieve low-cost in laboratory robotics are 1) the use of low-cost robots, which become more and more common, and 2) the use of scripting, which enables compatibility between robots and other analytical equipment.

=== Robotic, mobile laboratory operators and remote-controlled laboratories ===
In July 2020 scientists reported the development of a mobile robot chemist and demonstrate that it can assist in experimental searches. According to the scientists their strategy was automating the researcher rather than the instruments – freeing up time for the human researchers to think creatively – and could identify photocatalyst mixtures for hydrogen production from water that were six times more active than initial formulations. The modular robot can operate laboratory instruments, work nearly around the clock, and autonomously make decisions on his next actions depending on experimental results.

There is ongoing development of &quot;remote controlled laboratories&quot; that automatically perform many life sciences experiments per day and can be operated, including in collaboration, from afar.

===Pharmaceutical applications===

One major area where automated synthesis has been applied is structure determination in pharmaceutical research. Processes such as NMR and HPLC-MS can now have sample preparation done by robotic arm. Additionally, structural protein analysis can be done automatically using a combination of NMR and X-ray crystallography. Crystallization often takes hundreds to thousands of experiments to create a protein crystal suitable for X-ray crystallography. An automated micropipet machine can allow nearly a million different crystals to be created at once, and analyzed via X-ray crystallography.

===Reproducibility verification===
=== Diagnostic testing for pathogens ===
For example, there are robots that are used to analyze swabs from patients to diagnose COVID-19. Automated robotic liquid handling systems have been or are being built for lateral flow assays. It minimizes hands-on time, maximizes experiment size, and enables improved reproducibility.

=== Biological laboratory robotics ===

Biological and chemical samples, in either liquid or solid state, are stored in vials, plates or tubes. Often, they need to be frozen and/or sealed to avoid contamination or to retain their biological and/or chemical properties. Specifically, the life science industry has standardized on a plate format, known as the microtiter plate, to store such samples.

The microtiter plate standard was formalized by the Society for Biomolecular Screening in 1996. It typically has 96, 384 or even 1536 sample wells arranged in a 2:3 rectangular matrix. The standard governs well dimensions (e.g. diameter, spacing and depth) as well as plate properties (e.g. dimensions and rigidity).

A number of companies have developed robots to specifically handle SBS microplates. Such robots may be liquid handlers which aspirates or dispenses liquid samples from and to these plates, or &quot;plate movers&quot; which transport them between instruments.

Other companies have pushed integration even further: on top of interfacing to the specific consumables used in biology, some robots (Andrew by Andrew Alliance, see picture) have been designed with the capability of interfacing to volumetric pipettes used by biologists and technical staff. Essentially, all the manual activity of liquid handling can be performed automatically, allowing humans spending their time in more conceptual activities.

Instrument companies have designed plate readers which can carry out detect specific biological, chemical or physical events in samples stored in these plates. These readers typically use optical and/or computer vision techniques to evaluate the contents of the microtiter plate wells.

One of the first applications of robotics in biology was peptide and oligonucleotide synthesis. One early example is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which is able to amplify DNA strands using a thermal cycler to micromanage DNA synthesis by adjusting temperature using a pre-made computer program. Since then, automated synthesis has been applied to organic chemistry and expanded into three categories: reaction-block systems, robot-arm systems, and non-robotic fluidic systems. The primary objective of any automated workbench is high-throughput processes and cost reduction. This allows a synthetic laboratory to operate with a fewer number of people working more efficiently.

===Combinatorial library synthesis===
Robotics have applications with combinatorial chemistry which has great impact on the pharmaceutical industry. The use of robotics has allowed for the use of much smaller reagent quantities and mass expansion of chemical libraries. The &quot;parallel synthesis&quot; method can be improved upon with automation. The main disadvantage to &quot;parallel-synthesis&quot; is the amount of time it takes to develop a library, automation is typically applied to make this process more efficient.

The main types of automation are classified by the type of solid-phase substrates, the methods for adding and removing reagents, and design of reaction chambers. Polymer resins may be used as a substrate for solid-phase. It is not a true combinatorial method in the sense that &quot;split-mix&quot; where a peptide compound is split into different groups and reacted with different compounds. This is then mixed back together split into more groups and each groups is reacted with a different compound. Instead the &quot;parallel-synthesis&quot; method does not mix, but reacts different groups of the same peptide with different compounds and allows for the identification of the individual compound on each solid support. A popular method implemented is the reaction block system due to its relative low cost and higher output of new compounds compared to other &quot;parallel-synthesis&quot; methods. Parallel-Synthesis was developed by &quot;Mario Geysen&quot; and his colleagues and is not a true type of combinatorial synthesis, but can be incorporated into a combinatorial synthesis. This group synthesized 96 peptides on plastic pins coated with a solid support for the solid phase peptide synthesis. This method uses a rectangular block moved by a robot so that reagents can be pipetted by a robotic pipetting system. This block is separated into wells which the individual reactions take place. These compounds are later cleaved from the solid-phase of the well for further analysis. Another method is the closed reactor system which uses a completely closed off reaction vessel with a series of fixed connections to dispense. Though the produce fewer number of compounds than other methods, its main advantage is the control over the reagents and reaction conditions. Early closed reaction systems were developed for peptide synthesis which required variations in temperature and a diverse range of reagents. Some closed reactor system robots have a temperature range of 200°C and over 150 reagents.

===Purification===
Simulated distillation, a type of gas chromatography testing method used in the petroleum, can be automated via robotics. An older method used a system called ORCA (Optimized Robot for Chemical Analysis) was used for the analysis of petroleum samples by simulated distillation (SIMDIS). ORCA has allowed for shorter analysis times and has reduced maximum temperature needed to elute compounds. One major advantage of automating purification is the scale at which separations can be done. Using microprocessors, ion-exchange separation can be conducted on a nanoliter scale in a short period of time.

Robotics have been implemented in liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) to streamline the process of preparing biological samples using 96-well plates. This is an alternative method to solid-phase extraction methods and protein precipitation, which has the advantage of being more reproducible and robotic assistance has made LLE comparable in speed to solid phase extraction. The robotics used for LLE can perform an entire extraction with quantities in the microliter scale and performing the extraction in as little as ten minutes.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

=== Advantages ===
One of the advantages to automation is faster processing, but it is not necessarily faster than a human operator. Repeatability and reproducibility are improved as automated systems as less likely to have variances in reagent quantities and less likely to have variances in reaction conditions. Typically productivity is increased since human constraints, such as time constraints, are no longer a factor. Efficiency is generally improved as robots can work continuously and reduce the amount of reagents used to perform a reaction. Also there is a reduction in material waste. Automation can also establish safer working environments since hazardous compounds do not have to be handled. Additionally automation allows staff to focus on other tasks that are not repetitive.

=== Disadvantages ===
Typically the cost of a single synthesis or sample assessment are expensive to set up and start up cost for automation can be expensive (but see above &quot;Low-cost laboratory robotics&quot;). Many techniques have not been developed for automation yet. Additionally there is difficulty automating instances where visual analysis, recognition, or comparison is required such as color changes. This also leads to the analysis being limited by available sensory inputs. One potential disadvantage is an increases job shortages as automation may replace staff members who do tasks easily replicated by a robot. Some systems require the use of programming languages such as C++ or Visual Basic to run more complicated tasks.

<text>Frits Clausen (12 November 1893 – 5 December 1947) was a far-right Danish politician and leader of the National Socialist Workers&#x27; Party of Denmark (DNSAP) before and during World War II.

==Life==
Born in Aabenraa, since 1864 a part of Prussia, Clausen served in the German Army during World War I. After the war, Clausen studied medicine in Heidelberg and became a doctor in 1924, after which he returned to Aabenraa, which had been voted back to Denmark in 1920, and set up a practice. Clausen initially became involved in politics as an advocate of Aabenraa once again becoming a part of Germany. Still, he eventually turned to Danish politics, advocating causes favouring the German minority in southern Jutland.

Clausen initially became a conservative party member, but he eventually resigned and, in 1931, joined the DNSAP. Two years later, Clausen ousted the leadership committee of the party (whose members were Einar Jørgensen, C. C. Hansen, and Cay Lembcke) from power and became the party&#x27;s sole leader.

Under Clausen&#x27;s direction, the party essentially espoused nationalism and called for a stronger relationship between Denmark and Nazi Germany. At the height of its popularity, the DNSAP had about 20,000 members and 20,000 sympathizers. However, the party fared relatively poorly in the 1939 elections, winning only three seats in the Folketing. A year later, when Germany invaded Denmark, Clausen strongly supported the German occupation and took credit for the lenient way Germany governed the country.

The Germans attempted to reward Clausen for his services by persuading King Christian X to let Clausen and his followers have roles in the nation&#x27;s government in 1940 and 1943, but the King opposed any such suggestions. The German government was unwilling to forcibly put him in charge of Denmark for fear of angering its people, although there were talks of doing so in 1940 and 1942. The Germans did hope, however, that Clausen would legally seize power over the nation in the 1943 elections. Still, the DNSAP performed just as poorly in the elections as it did in 1939, when they won only three seats in the Folketing.

After the elections, Clausen joined the German Army and saw active service on the Eastern Front as a surgeon, although he did not resign his position as chief of the DNSAP. Clausen returned to Denmark in the spring of 1944, after which time his political career was terminated.

Clausen&#x27;s failure in the elections and his unwillingness to actively assist in forming a Danish branch of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; alienated his German supporters. As such, SS &quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Dr. Werner Best, the Plenipotentiary of the German Reich for Denmark, convinced Clausen to step down as leader of the party and replaced him with a three-man committee shortly after his return to Denmark.

After Germany&#x27;s occupation of Denmark ended in May 1945, Clausen was captured and sent to Frøslev Prison Camp. He was later given a formal trial, but he died of a heart attack in the &quot;Vestre Fængsel&quot;, a prison in Copenhagen before it could be completed.

<doc id="871906" wikidata="Q3101245" url="?curid=871906" title="Plate reader">
<text>Plate readers, also known as microplate readers or microplate photometers, are instruments which are used to detect biological, chemical or physical events of samples in microtiter plates. They are widely used in research, drug discovery, bioassay validation, quality control and manufacturing processes in the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industry and academic organizations. Sample reactions can be assayed in 1-1536 well format microtiter plates. The most common microplate format used in academic research laboratories or clinical diagnostic laboratories is 96-well (8 by 12 matrix) with a typical reaction volume between 100 and 200 μL per well. Higher density microplates (384- or 1536-well microplates) are typically used for screening applications, when throughput (number of samples per day processed) and assay cost per sample become critical parameters, with a typical assay volume between 5 and 50 μL per well. Common detection modes for microplate assays are absorbance, fluorescence intensity, luminescence, time-resolved fluorescence, and fluorescence polarization.

==Methods==

===Absorbance===
Absorbance detection has been available in microplate readers for more than 3 decades and is used for assays such as ELISA assays, protein and nucleic acid quantification or enzyme activity assays (i.e. in the MTT assay for cell viability). A light source illuminates the sample using a specific wavelength (selected by an optical filter, or a monochromator), and a light detector located on the other side of the well measures how much of the initial (100%) light is transmitted through the sample: the amount of transmitted light will typically be related to the concentration of the molecule of interest. Several conventional colorimetric analyses have been miniaturized to function quantitatively in a plate reader, with performance suitable for research purposes. Examples of analyses converted to plate reader methods include several for ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, urea, iron(II), and orthophosphate. More recent colorimetric chemistries have been developed directly for use in plate readers.

===Fluorescence===
Fluorescence intensity detection has developed very broadly in the microplate format over the last two decades. The range of applications is much broader than when using absorbance detection, but the instrumentation is usually more expensive. In this type of instrumentation, a first optical system (excitation system) illuminates the sample using a specific wavelength (selected by an optical filter, or a monochromator). As a result of the illumination, the sample emits light (it fluoresces) and a second optical system (emission system) collects the emitted light, separates it from the excitation light (using a filter or monochromator system), and measures the signal using a light detector such as a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The advantages of fluorescence detection over absorbance detection are sensitivity, as well as application range, given the wide selection of fluorescent labels available today. For example, a technique known as calcium imaging measures the fluorescence intensity of calcium-sensitive dyes to assess intracellular calcium levels.

===Luminescence===
Luminescence is the result of a chemical or biochemical reaction. Luminescence detection is simpler optically than fluorescence detection because luminescence does not require a light source for excitation or optics for selecting discrete excitation wavelengths. A typical luminescence optical system consists of a light-tight reading chamber and a PMT detector. Some plate readers use an Analog PMT detector while others have a photon counting PMT detector. Photon Counting is widely accepted as the most sensitive means of detecting luminescence. Some plate readers offer filter wheel or tunable wavelength monochromator optical systems for selecting specific luminescent wavelengths. The ability to select multiple wavelengths, or even wavelength ranges, allows for detection of assays that contain multiple luminescent reporter enzymes, the development of new luminescence assays, as well as a means to optimize the signal to noise ratio.

Common applications include luciferase -based gene expression assays, as well as cell viability, cytotoxicity, and biorhythm assays based on the luminescent detection of ATP.

===Time-resolved fluorescence (TRF)===
Time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) measurement is very similar to fluorescence intensity (FI) measurement. The only difference is the timing of the excitation/measurement process. When measuring FI, the excitation and emission processes are simultaneous: the light emitted by the sample is measured while excitation is taking place. Even though emission systems are very efficient at removing excitation light before it reaches the detector, the amount of excitation light compared to emission light is such that FI measurements always exhibit fairly elevated background signals. TRF offers a solution to this issue. It relies on the use of very specific fluorescent molecules, called lanthanides, that have the unusual property of emitting over long periods of time (measured in milliseconds) after excitation, when most standard fluorescent dyes (e.g. fluorescein) emit within a few nanoseconds of being excited. As a result, it is possible to excite lanthanides using a pulsed light source (Xenon flash lamp or pulsed laser for example) and measure after the excitation pulse. This results in lower measurement backgrounds than in standard FI assays. The drawbacks are that the instrumentation and reagents are typically more expensive, and that the applications have to be compatible with the use of these very specific lanthanide dyes. The main use of TRF is found in drug screening applications, under a form called TR-FRET (time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer). TR-FRET assays are very robust (limited sensitivity to several types of assay interference) and are easily miniaturized. Robustness, the ability to automate and miniaturize are features that are highly attractive in a screening laboratory.

===Fluorescence polarization===
Fluorescence polarization measurement is also very close to FI detection. The difference is that the optical system includes polarizing filters on the light path: the samples in the microplate are excited using polarized light (instead of non-polarized light in FI and TRF modes). Depending on the mobility of the fluorescent molecules found in the wells, the light emitted will either be polarized or not. For example, large molecules (e.g. proteins) in solution, which rotate relatively slowly because of their size, will emit polarized light when excited with polarized light. On the other hand, the fast rotation of smaller molecules will result in a depolarization of the signal. The emission system of the plate reader uses polarizing filters to analyze the polarity of the emitted light. A low level of polarization indicates that small fluorescent molecules move freely in the sample. A high level of polarization indicates that fluorescent is attached to a larger molecular complex. As a result, one of the basic applications of FP detection is molecular binding assays, since they allow to detect if a small fluorescent molecule binds (or not) to a larger, non-fluorescent molecule: binding results in a slower rotation speed of the fluorescent molecule, and in an increase in the polarization of the signal.

===Light scattering and nephelometry===
Light scattering and nephelometry are methods for the determination of the cloudiness of a solution (i.e.: insoluble particles in a solution). A light beam passes through the sample and the light is scattered by the suspended particles. The measured forward scattered light indicates the amount of the insoluble particles present in solution. Common nephelometry/light scattering applications include automated HTS drug solubility screening, long-term microbial growth kinetics, flocculation, aggregation and the monitoring of polymerization and precipitation, including immunoprecipitation.

==Instruments and assays==
Many of the detection modes (absorbance, fluorescence intensity, luminescence, time-resolved fluorescence, and fluorescence polarization) are available stand-alone in dedicated plate readers, but are very often found today combined into one instrument (multi-mode plate reader). There are also instruments for measuring the dynamic or static light scattered from samples in a microplate. The range of applications for multi-mode plate readers is extremely large. Some of the most common assays are:
*ELISAs
*Protein and cell growth assays
*Protein–protein interaction
*Reporter assays
*Nucleic acid quantitation
*Molecular interactions
*Enzyme activity
*Cell toxicity, proliferation, and viability
*ATP quantification
*Immunoassays
*High throughput screening of compounds and targets in drug discovery (Labeled Alpha Screen on most instruments)
*Bead-based epitope assay
*Cellular Uptake of nanoparticles

While &quot;plate reader&quot; usually refers to the devices described above, many variations are available. Some examples of other devices working with the microplate format are:
* ELISPOT plate readers, used to count the colored spots that are formed in the course of ELISPOT assays.
* High throughput imagers that can measure all the wells of a microplate at once
* High-content screening (HCS) systems that image each well with high resolution, to look at cell populations
* Label-free instruments that use specialized microplates to measure binding events without the use of chemical markers

<doc id="871907" wikidata="Q1807346" url="?curid=871907" title="Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident">
<text>Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident, known in America as Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident, is a young adult and fantasy novel written by Irish author Eoin Colfer, published in 2002. It is the second book in the &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; series, preceded by &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; and followed by &quot;Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code&quot;. It follows the adventures of the twelve-year-old criminal mastermind, Artemis Fowl II, as he thwarts a goblin rebellion and rescues his father, Artemis Fowl I. The third-person narration switches back and forth constantly, allowing the reader to understand more of what is going on. A New York Times bestseller, the novel was well received by critics, and reviews compared its quality and success to those of its predecessor.

==Plot==
The story opens at the Bay of Kola, just after the Russian Mafia have sunk the Fowl Star. Two low-ranking Mafia members discover the body of the former Irish crime lord Artemis Fowl I, who has survived despite losing a leg and the use of one eye. Three years later, his son and heir Artemis Fowl II, while at school talking to the guidance counselor, Dr. Po, receives a call from his manservant and bodyguard Butler. Butler shows Artemis a video of his father, showing that he is in the hands of the Mafia. Knowing that a ransom demand will soon be coming, and that payment will in no way guarantee his father&#x27;s release or his own safety, Artemis prepares to devise a plan while Butler drives them back to Fowl Manor.

While Artemis Fowl&#x27;s plight plays out above ground, the Lower Elements Police of the fairy realm are having their own problems. A routine stakeout group consisting of the disgraced Captain Holly Short and Private Chix Verbil is attacked by a group of heavily armed goblins carrying old outlawed Softnose weaponry powered by human batteries, a Class A contraband. Captain Short is quick to accuse young Artemis Fowl and against his own wishes, LEP Commander Julius Root sends Holly to apprehend Artemis Fowl and Butler for interrogation. However, Foaly&#x27;s Retimager proves Artemis&#x27;s innocence. Against Holly&#x27;s instincts, Root decides to recruit Fowl and Butler to locate the supplier; Artemis agrees, on the condition that they help him rescue his father.

Unknown to all, the attacks are being organised by Briar Cudgeon, a former LEP Lieutenant disgraced, deformed and demoted following his disastrous involvement in the Artemis Fowl affair. Briar is working alongside Foaly&#x27;s biggest technology rival, the megalomanic pixie Opal Koboi, who is above suspicion thanks to the fact the goblins have been staging attacks on Koboi property. Neither are concerned by Root&#x27;s attempts to find out the truth, and choose to bide their time so they can kill him, and begin their plan to take over Haven once he is out of the way.

Foaly&#x27;s investigation points to French personal investigator Luc Carrére. Holly leads a squad consisting of Root, Artemis and Butler, and herself above ground to France to interrogate Luc. Butler breaks into his apartment in Paris, but finds only a heavily mesmerized Luc, counterfeit Euros, and a fairy handgun. Butler neutralises Luc, ensures the Parisian knows nothing of the goblin use of batteries, and leaves the private eye to be arrested. Although Artemis is concerned by the ease of the operation, he puts aside his concerns to travel to Murmansk with Butler, Root and Holly to attempt a rescue for Artemis Fowl I. Cudgeon sees this as the perfect opportunity to kill Root, and sends a goblin to ambush the party. The goblins nearly succeed in killing the four as all fairy weapons currently in use by the force have just been disabled by Koboi. The resulting attack leaves Butler unconscious and trapped under rubble from an overhang with Commander Root. Holly and Artemis use a nuclear train to free Root and Butler, but the group is then forced to perform an emergency healing when the train door cuts off Holly&#x27;s trigger finger. Holly questions Artemis about his father and how he came to be so ruthless in the events of the previous book, and, in a rare moment of sincerity, Artemis admits he made a mistake, a sign of his moral development that continues through the series.

Below ground, Briar Cudgeon ambushes and locks Foaly in his Operations Booth, while Opal disables LEP weapons, framing him as the mastermind behind the rebellion against the LEP and leaving the rescue group powerless to stop the goblins as they begin their attack on Haven city. The situation becomes increasingly desperate for the LEP in Haven, as Foaly uses Artemis&#x27;s laptop to send a text message to the boy&#x27;s phone, alerting the rescue group that all fairy weapons and communications are controlled by Opal Koboi.

Having received the secret message, Artemis decides the only option is to break into Koboi Laboratories and return all weapon control to the LEP, interrupting the rescue mission. Root bitterly acknowledges the only fairy who ever succeeded in doing so was the kleptomaniac dwarf Mulch Diggums, who had worked as a builder of the facility, but was presumed dead following his break-in to Fowl Manor. Holly then reveals that Foaly had a hunch that Mulch had survived by placing the iris cam that scanned his vitals into local wildlife. Foaly realized that some of the gold returned by Artemis to the fairies was missing, and then traced several bars to Los Angeles, where Mulch was living as diminutive millionaire and legendary Oscar thief. The group then head to Los Angeles and apprehend Mulch once again.

Root threatens Mulch with imprisonment in the goblin prison Howler&#x27;s Peak, and offers the dwarf a two-day head start if he assists in the break-in. The team use Mulch&#x27;s original strategy to enter through one of the titanium foundation rods. One rod was not actually solid as Mulch and his cousin had diverted sewage into the shaft instead. After reaching the bottom of the foundation rod, and climbing through Mulch&#x27;s recyclings, Butler, Root and Holly mount a desperate charge to the communications centre. While the three soldiers battle through an army of goblins, Artemis enters the network of deactivated plasma cannons to reach the centre by another route. Artemis manages to sneak into the hub long enough to communicate with Foaly, who uses Artemis&#x27;s laptop to play back Cudgeon&#x27;s own voice, revealing that Cudgeon planned to betray the goblins. Cudgeon is unfazed, and reactivates the plasma cannons to knock out all the goblins in Koboi Labs. Butler, Root and Holly smash their way into the centre, where Cudgeon holds Artemis at gunpoint. However, Foaly calls Artemis&#x27; mobile phone, and Artemis hands it to Koboi, who is then enraged to find that Cudgeon planned to betray her too. The two masterminds grapple with each other on Opal&#x27;s hoverchair, and Cudgeon is killed when he is thrown into the open DNA cannon plasma feed, while the crash causes Opal to blackout, and destroys the remote control used by Opal to control LEP weaponry. Foaly uses the restored power to activate DNA cannons in Police Plaza, neutralizing most of the goblins involved in the revolt. As the LEP outside, commanded by Captain Trouble Kelp, still think he is to blame for the revolt, Foaly refuses to emerge from the Operations Booth until Root returns and exonerates him, while also purging any remaining Koboi tech from the LEP&#x27;s systems.

Artemis, Holly, Butler and Root then head to Murmansk and rescue Artemis Fowl I. Artemis&#x27;s plan to fake the shooting of his father nearly ends in disaster when the Russians throw the man overboard, but Holly manages to rescue Artemis Senior and heal his most severe injuries, apart from his lost leg. The Russian Mafia are foiled in their attempt to take the money, as Artemis has Foaly run up some fake notes that will dissolve upon being delivered to their boss. The group return to Europe where Holly deposits Artemis Fowl I on the steps of a hospital in Helsinki. The story closes with Dr. Po asking Artemis if he has learned anything and found a person he admires. Artemis, thinking of his father and the many who helped to rescue him, then answers &quot;Yes, I believe I have.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Critical reception was generally positive.
&quot;January Magazine&quot; noted that after the success of the novel&#x27;s predecessor, &quot;Arctic Incident&quot; had &quot;a lot to live up to&quot;. The review said the novel was &quot;refreshing and innovative&quot;. It lauded Colfer&#x27;s continual expansion of characters.
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; praised the novel&#x27;s &quot;puns, word plays, and inventive new concepts about the fairy realm&quot; and called the book an &quot;exhilarating Celtic caper&quot; that would &quot;delight fans and make converts of new readers&quot;.
The reviews, however, were not all positive.
While &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described the novel as a &quot;cracking good read,&quot; the review cautioned that Colfer &quot;ratchets up the body count...perhaps too steeply for some tastes&quot; and that &quot;the high-concept premise may be a tad slick for others&quot;.
Goodtoread.org did not receive the book as positively, citing Butler and Artemis&#x27; awkward relationship and Artemis as &quot;an unconvincing 13-year-old genius&quot;. However, the reviews concluded that the book was &quot;interesting enough&quot;.

<text>A microplate, also known as a microtiter plate, microwell plate or multiwell, is a flat plate with multiple &quot;wells&quot; used as small test tubes. The microplate has become a standard tool in analytical research and clinical diagnostic testing laboratories. A very common usage is in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the basis of most modern medical diagnostic testing in humans and animals.

A microplate typically has 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 384 or 1536 sample wells arranged in a 2:3 rectangular matrix. Some microplates have been manufactured with 3456 or 9600 wells, and an &quot;array tape&quot; product has been developed that provides a continuous strip of microplates embossed on a flexible plastic tape.

Each well of a microplate typically holds somewhere between tens of nanolitres to several millilitres of liquid. They can also be used to store dry powder or as racks to support glass tube inserts. Wells can be either circular or square. For compound storage applications, square wells with close fitting silicone cap-mats are preferred. Microplates can be stored at low temperatures for long periods, may be heated to increase the rate of solvent evaporation from their wells and can even be heat-sealed with foil or clear film. Microplates with an embedded layer of filter material were developed in the early 1980s by several companies, and today, there are microplates for just about every application in life science research which involves filtration, separation, optical detection, storage, reaction mixing, cell culture and detection of antimicrobial activity.

The enormous growth in studies of whole live cells has led to an entirely new range of microplate products which are &quot;tissue culture treated&quot; especially for this work. The surfaces of these products are modified using an oxygen plasma discharge to make their surfaces more hydrophilic so that it becomes easier for adherent cells to grow on the surface which would otherwise be strongly hydrophobic.
A number of companies have developed robots to specifically handle microplates. These robots may be liquid handlers which aspirate or dispense liquid samples from and to these plates, or &quot;plate movers&quot; which transport them between instruments, plate stackers which store microplates during these processes, plate hotels for longer-term storage, plate washers for processing plates, plate thermal sealers for applying heat seals, de-sealers for removing heat seals, or microplate incubators to ensure constant temperature during testing. Instrument companies have designed plate readers which can detect specific biological, chemical or physical events in samples stored in these plates. A specialized plate reader has also been developed which can perform quality control of microplate well contents, capable of identifying empty wells, filled wells and precipitate.

==Manufacture and composition==
The most common manufacturing process is injection molding, using materials such as polystyrene, polypropylene and cyclo-olefin for different temperature and chemical resistance needs. Glass is also a possible material, and vacuum forming can be used with many other plastics such as polycarbonate.

Microplates are manufactured from a variety of materials: 
* Polystyrene (PS) is the most common, and is used for high-clarity optical detection microplates. It can be coloured white by the addition of titanium dioxide for optical absorbance or luminescence detection or black by the addition of carbon for fluorescent biological assays. But, it has poor resistance to organic solvents. It also starts melting at around 80˚C, and thus cannot be autoclaved.
* Polypropylene (PP) is used for the construction of plates subject to wide changes in temperature, such as storage at −80 °C and thermal cycling. It has excellent properties for the long-term storage of novel chemical compounds and high resistance to organic solvents. It can be sterilized by autoclaving at 121˚C. Reportedly leachables including plasticizers (i.e. phtalates), whiteners, and heavy metals (cobalt) are more of a concern with PP versus PS plates.
* Cyclo-olefins (COP and COC) are now being used to construct microplates which transmit near-ultraviolet light, allowing applications like protein assays via absorbance measurements at 280 nm. But, COC has a poor resistance to organic solvents.
* Polycarbonate (PC) is cheap and easy to mould and has been used for disposable microplates for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method of DNA amplification.
* Glass or quartz is also, albeit less commonly &amp; rather expensively, used to construct microplates for special applications that require extreme resistance to organic solvents and/or the surface properties of glass, or the ultraviolet C transmission capability of quartz.

Composite microplates, including filter bottom plates, solid phase extraction (SPE) plates, and even some advanced PCR plate designs, use multiple components and/or materials which are moulded separately and later assembled into a finished product. ELISA plates may now be assembled from twelve separate strips of eight wells, making it easier to only partially use a plate.

==Formats and Standardization efforts==
Microplates are produced with the same standardized footprint, but using a variety of formats (see table below), materials (see above section), plate heights, numbers of wells, well shapes, and well bottom heights, with some of these characteristics being more varied between manufacturers than others (see below section).

There are also less common 192- and 768-well plates.

===Standardization efforts===
An attempt at standardizing microplates was made by the Society for Biomolecular Sciences with the ANSI-Standards (ANSI/SBS 1-2004, ANSI/SBS 2-2004, ANSI/SBS 3-2004, ANSI/SBS 4-2004). These standards have been updated to and are now known as the ANSI SLAS standards.

====Footprint &amp; flange (standardized)====
The ANSI SLAS microplate standards define a footprint, and a bottom flange geometry. These footprints &amp; flanges are generally rigorously followed by all microplate manufacterers:
* Footprint standard (127.76 mm × 85.48 mm ± 0.5 mm)
* Flange standard

====Corner notch====
Although a corner notch (aka chamfer) is shown at the A1 (top-left) corner in the ANSI SLAS drawings, and many microplates do implement this A1 corner notch, in actuality the &quot;quantity and location of chamfers(s) is optional&quot;, so in practice the presence or absence of corner notches at additional corners (i.e. the bottom-left) is a proprietary implementation which causes difficulties with accessory cross-compatibility such as with microplate lids that may also implement the matching corner notch.

====Well position (standardized)====
The well position is also standardized, but only for 96- , 384-, and 1536-well plates. These are generally well followed by manufacturers: 
* Well Positions

96-well plates have a 9 mm well-to-well spacing, 384-wells a 4.5 mm spacing, and 1536-wells a 2.25 mm spacing. A notable characteristic is that the well array is symmetrical when the plate is rotated 180˚ around its Z-axis (height axis). Therefore, scientific instruments which use microplates, can accept the plate in one of two rotated orientations - either &quot;correct&quot; or 180˚ rotated.

Other variants like 24-well plates, are not considered in the standard, but there is a &quot;de facto&quot; standard to implement to 24-wells by apply the same scaling factor as the 384- to 96-well transition, i.e. 24-wells have an 18 mm spacing.

====Well shape====
Notably, the shape and diameter of the well is not standardized, and has several proprietary implementations. This causes difficulties with accessory cross-compatibility such as with microplate cap mats.

Wells within the microplate are available in different shapes:
* Round well
* Square well

Wells also have different geometries at the bottom of the well:
* F-Bottom: flat bottom (compatible with through-well optical plate reader measurements)
* V-Bottom: V-shaped bottom (conical for round wells, square pyramid for square wells; improves aspiration of low liquid volumes)
* U-Bottom: U-shaped bottom (half sphere; improves aspiration of low liquid volumes)
* C-Bottom: bottom with minimal rounded edges

Round wells in particular often come in a few diameters:
* 6.96 mm
* 8.3 mm

====Well Bottom Elevation====
The most recent addition to the ANSI SLAS microplate standards was the inclusion of a well bottom standard. The standard however specifies definitions and test methods only, for the &quot;Microplate Well Bottom Elevation (WBE)&quot;, &quot;Well Bottom Elevation Variation (WBEV)&quot;, and &quot;Intra-Well Bottom Elevation Variation (IWBEV)&quot;, but it does not state a preferred value or limits for those dimensional definitions. Therefore all well bottom heights are currently proprietary implementations without a clear &quot;de facto&quot; standard. This lack of standardization can cause difficulties with applications such as automated autosampler needle injection.
* Well Bottom Elevation

====Standard microplate height====
The height of a standard microplate is also defined, however this is sometimes not followed by manufacturers, even if they follow the footprint and flange standards.
* Height (14.35 mm ± 0.76 mm)

====Microplate variants with increased heights====
There are also deep well microplates sometimes called &quot;blocks&quot;. Unlike plates of normal height, the ANSI SLAS 2-2004 height standard, does not define a standard height for deep well plates (blocks). Deepwell plates do typically follow a &quot;de facto&quot; standard height of 44 mm.

Reservoir plates are also commercially available. Reservoir plates have columns of wells (as in 96-well, 24-well, etc. plates) that are fused into single wells, so that they provide additional volume for multichannel pipettes. Like deepwell plates or blocks, they often follow a &quot;de facto&quot; standard height of 44 mm.

====Skirts ====
Microplates used for PCR are designed to have a notably thinner wall thickness than standard ANSI/SLAS microplates (to allow for better thermal conduction), and to come in a few different &quot;skirt&quot; types: full-skirt, half-skirt or semi-skirted, and unskirted or no-skirted. The skirt is analogous to the footprint &amp; flange of the ANSI/SLAS standards, so while most full-skirt PCR microplates may be ANSI/SLAS compliant, other deviations such as semi-skirted or others, are not compliant ANSI/SLAS standards.

==History==
The earliest microplate was created in 1951 by a Hungarian, Dr. Gyula Takátsy, who machined six rows of 12 &quot;wells&quot; in Lucite. Subsequently, Dr. John Louis Sever modified the Hungarian design into a 96-well plate, which he published in 1962. However, common usage of the microplate began in the late 1980s when John Liner introduced a molded version. By 1990 there were more than 15 companies producing a wide range of microplates with different features. It was estimated that 125 million microplates were used in 2000 alone. The word &quot;Microtiter&quot; is a registered trademark of Thermo Electron OY (.)

Other trade names for microplates include Viewplate and Unifilter (introduced in the early 1990s by Polyfiltronics and sold by Packard Instrument, which is now part of PerkinElmer).

In 1996, the Society for Biomolecular Screening (SBS), later known as Society for Biomolecular Sciences, began an initiative to create a standard definition of a microplate. A series of standards was proposed in 2003 and published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) on behalf of the SBS. The standards govern various characteristics of a microplate including well positioning (but not shape, depth, and diameter) as well as plate properties, which allows interoperability between microplates, instrumentation and equipment from different suppliers, and is particularly important in laboratory automation. In 2010, the Society for Biomolecular Sciences merged with the Association for Laboratory Automation (ALA) to form a new organisation, the Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening (SLAS). Henceforth, the microplate standards are known as ANSI SLAS standards.

<doc id="871923" wikidata="Q3815652" url="?curid=871923" title="Kismet (musical)">
<text>Kismet is a musical adapted by Charles Lederer and Luther Davis from the 1911 play of the same name by Edward Knoblock, with lyrics and musical adaptation (as well as some original music) by Robert Wright and George Forrest. The music was mostly adapted from several pieces composed by Alexander Borodin. The story concerns a wily poet who talks his way out of trouble several times; meanwhile, his beautiful daughter meets and falls in love with the young caliph.

The musical was first produced on Broadway in 1953 and won the Tony Award for best musical in 1954. It was also successful in London&#x27;s West End and has been given several revivals. A 1955 film version was produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

==Background==
The musical was commissioned by Edwin Lester, founder and director of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera, who conceived of a musical based on the 1911 play &quot;Kismet&quot; by Edward Knoblock. Lester had previously produced &quot;Song of Norway&quot;, with the same composing team, adapting the melodies of Edvard Grieg. For &quot;Kismet&quot;, the writers seized upon the music of Alexander Borodin, which they felt had a suitable exotic flavor and lush melodies.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Kismet&quot; is set in a fictional Baghdad in the times of &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;.

===Act 1===
At a mosque, an imam prays as the sun rises (&quot;The Sands of Time&quot;). Three beggars sit outside the temple, but the fourth, Hajj, has gone to Mecca. Crying &quot;Rhymes! Fine Rhymes!&quot;, a poet enters to sell his verses. His beautiful daughter Marsinah joins in the sales pitch, but they have no success (&quot;Rhymes Have I&quot;). Marsinah is sent to steal oranges in the Bazaar for their breakfast, while her father sits down to beg. When the beggars object to the poet&#x27;s taking Hajj&#x27;s place, he claims to be a cousin of Hajj. The poet threatens to curse those who do not give him money and soon earns a few coins (&quot;Fate&quot;). Hassen-Ben, a huge man from the desert, mistakes him for Hajj and kidnaps him. The poet (who is referred to as Hajj thereafter) is taken to Jawan, a notorious brigand. Fifteen years ago, the real Hajj had placed a curse on Jawan that resulted in the disappearance of the brigand&#x27;s little son. Now he wants the curse removed. The new Hajj, seeing an opportunity to make some money, promises to do so for 100 gold pieces. Jawan leaves for Baghdad to search for his son, and Hajj rejoices in his new-found riches (&quot;Fate&quot; (reprise)).

Back in the city, the wazir of police comes through the busy bazaar (&quot;Bazaar of the Caravans&quot;). The evil wazir and his seductive, beautiful wife-of-wives, Lalume, discuss a loan he desperately needs. In return for the money lent from the king of Ababu, the wazir must arrange for the caliph to marry one (or all three) of the princesses of Ababu, who perform a sexy dance. Through their amah, the princesses tell Lalume that they wish to return home. Lalume convinces them that Baghdad is much more exciting than any other place on earth (&quot;Not Since Nineveh&quot;).

Marsinah is being pursued by a fruit merchant whose wares she has stolen. Her father arrives to rescue her, giving the man money. Hajj gives his daughter half of the money and leaves. The merchants set out their finest &quot;Baubles, Bangles and Beads&quot; for the young lady. The young caliph and his advisor, Omar Khayyam, have been traveling incognito. He is struck by Marsinah&#x27;s beauty and follows her. Elsewhere, Hajj is basking in the glow of some scantily-dressed slave girls he has just bought, when he is stopped by the police, who are checking identities because they are looking for Jawan. The Chief recognizes, on the coins, the crest of a family Jawan has robbed and arrests Hajj as a thief. Meanwhile, Marsinah has found a quaint little house with a beautiful garden to buy for her father and herself. She is admiring the garden when the Caliph slips in and, pretending to be a gardener, introduces himself to her. They fall in love on the spot (&quot;Stranger in Paradise&quot;). They promise to meet again in the garden at moonrise. The Caliph tells Omar that he has fallen in love, which is overheard by the princesses of Ababu; they are furious that he seems to ignore them, but the Chief Policeman reassures them that &quot;He&#x27;s in Love&quot;.

At the wazir&#x27;s palace, Hajj is on trial for the theft of 100 pieces of gold. The wazir has no need for evidence; he sentences Hajj to 20 lashes, and his right hand is to be cut off. The poet pleads that, as a poet and storyteller, the loss of a hand would cripple his career; it is the gesture that tells the story (&quot;Gesticulate&quot;). The lovely Lalume, attracted to the handsome poet, begs her husband for forgiveness, but the Wazir is not convinced and orders his guards to drag Hajj off to punishment. As Hajj curses the wazir, a guard bursts in with news that they have captured Jawan. The old brigand is brought in and asks Hajj where his son is. He sees, around the wazir&#x27;s neck, a medallion that his son was wearing when he was captured. The wazir is his son! Jawan praises the power of the great magician, Hajj, a man who has the power to curse and uncurse. Jawan is thrilled to see his son, but the Wazir sentences his own father to death. &quot;For the leading judge of Mesopotamia to have as a father the leading criminal of Mesopotamia,&quot; he says, is &quot;a disturbing thought.&quot;

As Jawan is led to his execution, the wazir realizes that the &quot;powerful magician&quot; has cursed him. Just when he is about to murder Hajj, the caliph enters with news that he has found a bride, a commoner, and that he will marry her tonight. The wazir is distraught: if the caliph does not marry a princess of Ababu, the wazir will be ruined. He concludes that this is a result of Hajj&#x27;s curse and begs Hajj to reverse the situation, promising him a reprieve and the title of Emir. Hajj agrees. Lalume knows that the poet is no wizard, but she decides that he may be her chance out of a dull life (&quot;Bored&quot;) and is falling in love with him; she promises to help. When the wazir returns, Hajj sings a mystic-sounding invocation to fate as the slave-girls dance wildly, distracting the wazir. Hajj jumps out of a window, leaving his coat behind him. When the wazir sees he is gone, he clutches the cloak in amazement and faints.

===Act 2===
The caliph and his wedding procession approach the house of his beloved (&quot;Night of my Nights&quot;). Inside, Marsinah thinks only of her gardener (&quot;Stranger in Paradise&quot; (reprise)). Hajj enters and tells her of his situation and says that they must flee immediately to Damascus, but Marsinah refuses to go. They argue, and he nearly strikes her before he runs off, ashamed. She departs in the opposite direction. When the caliph enters the garden, his love is not there.

The wazir is informed by his spies that the caliph&#x27;s bride has disappeared. He rejoices at the power he wields, by having a magician as Emir (&quot;Was I Wazir?&quot;). He instructs Lalume to keep his new Emir happy, and she is eager to comply (&quot;Rahadlakum&quot;). Hajj and Lalume are discussing a trip to a &quot;small oasis, a week&#x27;s travel by camel&quot; when Marsinah enters the Harem. Father and daughter reconcile, and she tells him of her lover and asks him to find him. At the same time, the caliph, in the next room, orders the wazir to find his love (&quot;And This Is My Beloved&quot;). Hajj and Omar encounter each other and engage in a battle of wits (&quot;The Olive Tree&quot;).

The wazir, hoping to convince the caliph that only wanting one wife is just a phase, shows him his harem through a peephole where he sees Marsinah. The caliph is horrified that his love is a member of the wazir&#x27;s Harem, and the wazir, sure that Hajj has arranged the whole thing, claims that she is one of his wives. The caliph, heartbroken, agrees to choose his wife-of-wives that night during his diwan. So as not to have lied to his prince, the wazir immediately marries Marsinah, promising to visit her that night. She vows to kill herself if he does.

That night, at the caliph&#x27;s diwan, the candidates for his hand dance for him: Princess Zubbediya of Damascus, Princess Samaris of Bangalore, and the three Ababu princesses. The caliph is unmoved. Hajj is searching for Marsinah; the wazir thanks the &quot;wizard&quot; for placing the caliph&#x27;s beloved in his own harem. Laughing, he tells him that he has married the pretty little Marsinah. Realizing what has happened, Hajj pulls a knife, but has a better idea. He takes a blank plaque and throws it in a pool, proclaiming that when it is retrieved, it will read the name of the caliph&#x27;s fated bride. He secretly gives the wazir another tablet, this one with the name Ababu written on it, and tells him to substitute it for the tablet from the pool. When the wazir enters the pool, Hajj trips him and holds him underwater until he drowns.

Hajj explains all to the caliph, who is joyfully reunited with Marsinah. The caliph is ready to pardon Hajj for his murder of a public official, but the poet requests, as his punishment, to be &quot;banished to some dreadful oasis ... at least a week&#x27;s journey away by camel,&quot; and to be made to comfort the wazir&#x27;s widow in her &quot;grief&quot;. As the two couples unite, the poet reflects on the fleetingness of &quot;The Sands of Time&quot;.

==Productions==
===Original production===

&quot;Kismet&quot; premiered in Los Angeles and then moved to San Francisco in the summer and autumn of 1953. A successful change during the tryouts was to transform the character of Hajj from being merely a beggar to also being a poet. Charles Lederer became producer as well as book writer. The production moved to Broadway on December 3, 1953, playing at the Ziegfeld Theatre. The director was Albert Marre, with choreography by Jack Cole and sumptuous settings and costumes by Lemuel Ayers. The original cast starred Alfred Drake as the poet Hajj, Doretta Morrow as his daughter Marsinah, Richard Kiley as the young Caliph of Baghdad, Henry Calvin as the Wazir and Joan Diener as Lalume, the vampy wife of the evil Wazir. Bodybuilder Steve Reeves played the wizard&#x27;s guard, a mute role. Bill Johnson later took over the role of Hajj, and Elaine Malbin the role of Marsinah.

The show opened on Broadway in the midst of a newspaper strike, and since newspaper reviews were unavailable, the producers used television advertising to promote the show. The musical caught the popular attention and ran for a successful 583 performances, winning the 1954 Tony Award for Best Musical. The strike may have ultimately assisted the popularity of the show, since the reviews, arriving a few weeks after the opening, were not all favorable. The critic of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, punning on the name of the composer Borodin, disparaged the score as &quot;a lot of borrowed din.&quot; Walter Kerr wrote that &quot;It&#x27;s the sort of show that would sell its soul for a joke, and the jokes should be better at the price.&quot; William Hawkins, however, wrote that it was &quot;noisy, spectacular, and vigorous. ... It is melodic and gay&quot;. Bloom and Vlastnik noted that it was the score that made the show successful, as the songs &quot;Stranger in Paradise&quot; and &quot;Baubles, Bangles and Beads&quot; were &quot;huge hits on radio, television and records.&quot;

===West End and Australian premieres===
&quot;Kismet&quot; was even more successful in London&#x27;s West End, enjoying a 648 performance run at the Stoll Theatre commencing in April 1955. The London production opened with the three stars of the Broadway cast, Drake, Morrow and Diener. They were subsequently replaced by Tudor Evans, Elizabeth Larner and Sheila Bradley, respectively.

The first Australian production opened at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne in November 1955, featuring Hayes Gordon and directed by American Burry Fredrik. It played over a year in Melbourne and Sydney.

===Subsequent productions===
The musical was revived at Lincoln Center&#x27;s New York State Theater, starting on June 22, 1965, for 39 performances and starring Drake, Lee Venora, Anne Jeffreys, and Henry Calvin.

The New York City Opera presented the musical in October 1985, featuring George Hearn (Hajj), Susanne Marsee (Lalume) and Maryanne Telese (Marsinah) with direction by Frank Corsaro. In 1994, BBC Radio 2 broadcast a complete production starring Ethan Freeman as Hajj, Julia Migenes as Lalume, Stephen Hill as the Caliph, Katrina Murphy as Marsinah, Frank Middlemass as Omar Kayyam and David Adler as the Wazir, with the BBC Concert Orchestra, conducted by Kenneth Alwyn. The production was re-broadcast on 13 August 2016.

Jettisoning the lush oriental context and physical production of the original, a restaging re-titled as &quot;Timbuktu!&quot; opened at the Mark Hellinger Theatre on March 1, 1978, and ran for 243 performances. This version, with a new book by Luther Davis, set the story in Africa, with minimalist settings and an all-Black cast. Plot emphasis was shifted, with increased emphasis given to Lalume (renamed Shaleem-La-Lume), played by Eartha Kitt opposite William Marshall and Melba Moore. Two new songs were written for the production: &quot;Since the Beginning, Women&quot; and &quot;Golden Land, Golden Life.&quot;

The New York City Center Encores! series presented a staged concert in February 2006, starring Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie. The musical was revived in 2007 by the English National Opera at the London Coliseum and starred Michael Ball, Faith Prince and Alfie Boe.

===Films and television===

The musical was made into a Cinemascope film in 1955 by MGM, directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Howard Keel as Hajj, Ann Blyth as Marsinah, Dolores Gray as Lalume, and Vic Damone as the Caliph. The quartet &quot;This is My Beloved&quot; was changed to a trio, because Sebastian Cabot, who played the Wazir, could not sing.

An &quot;Armstrong Circle Theater&quot; TV version premiered on ABC in 1967 starring Barbara Eden as Lalume, José Ferrer as Hajj, Anna Maria Alberghetti as Marsinah, and George Chakiris as the Caliph. The script was edited down to fit the 90-minute broadcast, but it cut few musical numbers.

==Recordings==
Columbia Masterworks Records recorded the original Broadway cast in late 1953; the recording was later reissued on CD by Masterworks Broadway Records.

Other recordings of the musical include a 1961 London studio recording by World Record Club conducted by Kenneth Alwyn with Graham Laver (Hajj), Elizabeth Harwood (Marsinah), Peter Grant (Caliph), Diana Landor (Lalume), Paul Whitsun-Jones (Wazir) and Hazel Holt. A 1964 Decca recording was conducted by Mantovani with Robert Merrill (Hajj), Adele Leigh (Marsinah), Kenneth McKellar (Caliph), Regina Resnik (Lalume), Ian Wallace (Wazir) and The Mike Sammes Singers. An abridged 1964 Capitol version was conducted by Van Alexander with Gordon MacRae as Hajj and the Caliph, Dorothy Kirsten (Marsinah), Bunny Bishop (Lalume), Johnny Guarnieri, Richard Levitt, Salli Terri and the Roger Wagner Chorale.

A 1989 recording on Jay Records that includes some songs from the film version and &quot;Timbuktu!&quot; as bonus tracks was conducted by John Owen Edwards with Donald Maxwell (Hajj), Valerie Masterson (Marsinah), David Rendall (Caliph), Judy Kaye (Lalume), Richard Van Allan (Wazir), Bonaventura Bottone and Rosemary Ashe. A 1991 Sony Broadway version with new orchestrations by conductor Paul Gemignani stars Samuel Ramey (Hajj), Ruth Ann Swenson (Marsinah), Jerry Hadley (Caliph), Julia Migenes (Lalume), Dom DeLuise (Wazir) and Mandy Patinkin (Marriage arranger).

<doc id="871930" wikidata="Q5541462" url="?curid=871930" title="George L. Kelling">
<text>George Lee Kelling (August 21, 1935 – May 15, 2019) was an American criminologist, a professor in the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University–Newark, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, and a 
fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He previously taught at Northeastern University.

== Biography ==
Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Kelling attended Northwestern Lutheran Theological Seminary to study theology for two years, but earned no degree. He received a B.A. in philosophy from St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, an M.S.W. from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee and a Ph.D. in social welfare from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1973, under Alfred Kadushin.

Early in his career, he was a child care counselor and a probation officer, but his later career was spent in academia. The author of numerous articles, he developed the broken windows theory with James Q. Wilson and Kelling&#x27;s wife, Catherine M. Coles that led to the mass incarceration of African-Americans in impoverished U.S. cities beginning in the mid-1980s. Kelling died in Hanover, New Hampshire on May 15, 2019 from complications of cancer at the age of 83.

==Personal life==
Kelling was married twice, first to Sally Jean Mosiman, from whom he became divorced, and then to Catherine M. Coles, an attorney and a lawyer and anthropologist studying urban issues and criminal prosecution, whom Kelling married in 1982.

<doc id="871932" wikidata="Q1071465" url="?curid=871932" title="Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton">
<text>Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton (25 October 1683 – 6 May 1757) was a British peer and politician.

==Early life==
He was the only child and heir of Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton (1663–1690) (an illegitimate son of King Charles II by his mistress Barbara Villiers) by his wife Isabella Bennet, 2nd Countess of Arlington, a great-granddaughter of William the Silent. He succeeded to his father&#x27;s titles on 9 October 1690.

==Career==
Grafton was one of the members of the Hanoverian-supporting Kit-Cat Club portrayed by Godfrey Kneller. He served as Lord High Steward at King George I&#x27;s coronation, becoming a Privy Counsellor in 1715 and a Knight of the Garter in 1721. He also served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1720 to 1724 and Lord Chamberlain from 1724 until his death. In 1719 he was one of the main subscribers to the Royal Academy of Music, a corporation that produced baroque opera on the stage. In 1739 he supported the creation of what was to become one of London&#x27;s most notable charities, the Foundling Hospital. He sat on that charity&#x27;s original Court of Governors with such fellow Governors as John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, Vere Beauclerk, 1st Baron Vere of Hanworth, and Micajah Perry, a Lord Mayor of London. He was affectionately known to the Royal court as &#x27;Booby Grafton&#x27;. For a number of years he and Princess Emily, one of George II&#x27;s daughters, enjoyed a semi-flirtatious relationship.

==Marriage and children==
On 30 April 1713, he married Lady Henrietta Somerset (27 August 1690 – 7 August 1726), daughter of Charles Somerset, Marquess of Worcester and Rebecca Child. They had seven children:
*Charles Henry FitzRoy, Earl of Euston (13 April 1714 – 18 December 1715)
*George FitzRoy, Earl of Euston (24 August 1715 – 7 July 1747). He was married on 10 October 1741 to Lady Dorothy Boyle (14 May 1724 – 2 May 1742) elder daughter of Richard Boyle, 4th Earl of Cork, 3rd Earl of Burlington, and his wife Lady Dorothy Savile, daughter of William Savile, 2nd Marquess of Halifax. The Earl was notorious for mistreating his wife—who died seven months after their marriage—and died childless.
*Lord Augustus FitzRoy (16 October 1716 – 24 May 1741). He was married to Elizabeth Cosby, daughter of Colonel William Cosby, who served as a colonial Governor of New York. They were parents to two sons, who founded branches of the family that still continue today:
**Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton
**Charles FitzRoy, 1st Baron Southampton
*Lord Charles FitzRoy (23 April 1718 – 29 July 1739)
*Lady Caroline FitzRoy (8 April 1722 – 26 June 1784). She married William Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Harrington. They were parents to Isabella Molyneux, Countess of Sefton, Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl of Harrington and five other children.
*Lady Harriet FitzRoy (8 June 1723 – August 1735)
*Lady Isabella FitzRoy (1726 – 10 November 1782). She married Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford. They were parents to Francis Seymour-Conway, 2nd Marquess of Hertford and eleven other children.

The Duke also fathered an illegitimate son, Charles FitzRoy-Scudamore.

==Legacy==
Grafton Street in Dublin is named after him. He owned property in the area. Grafton, Massachusetts, is named after him.

Winchester, New Hampshire was originally named &quot;Arlington&quot; in his honour (as in, the Earl of Arlington).

<text>Forts and &quot;Fortlets&quot; associated with the Gask Ridge from south to north [[Balmuildy]], [[Cadder]], [[Castlecary]], [[Mumrills]], [[Camelon]], [[Drumquhassle]], [[Lake of Menteith#Malling Roman Fort|Malling]], [[Doune]], &quot;[[Glenbank]]&quot;, [[Bochastle]], [[Ardoch Roman Fort|Ardoch]], &quot;[[Sheilhill]]&quot;, [[Strageath]], [[Dalginross]], &quot;[[Midgate]]&quot;, [[Bertha (Perth)|Bertha]], [[Fendoch]], Cargill, [[Cardean]], [[Gask Ridge|[[Inchtuthil]]]], &quot;[[Inverquharity]]&quot;, [[Stracathro]]
The Gask Ridge is the modern name given to an early series of fortifications, built by the Romans in Scotland, close to the Highland Line. Modern excavation and interpretation has been pioneered by the Roman Gask Project, with Birgitta Hoffmann and David Woolliscroft. The ridge fortifications: forts, fortlets and watchtowers were only in operation for a few years, probably fewer than ten.

==Name==
The name &quot;Gask Ridge&quot; refers to the ridge of land to the north of the River Earn in Perthshire. In Scottish Gaelic, a &quot;gasg&quot; is a projecting tail or strip of land. In the early 20th century, a line of Roman signal-towers (or watch-towers) was discovered along this ridge between the Roman forts of Strageath and Bertha.

==History==
The Gask Ridge system was constructed sometime between 70 and 80 AD. Construction on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall was started 42 years after completion of the Gask Ridge (from 122 to 130 AD), and the Antonine Wall was started 12 years after completion of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall (from 142 to 144 AD). Although the Gask Ridge was not a wall, it may be Rome&#x27;s earliest fortified land frontier. The fortifications approximately follow the boundary between Scotland&#x27;s fertile Lowlands and mountainous Highlands, in Perth and Kinross and Angus. The later Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and Antonine Wall were further south and considerably shorter.
The principal forts of the Gask Ridge frontier system were (from south to north): Camelon, Drumquhassle, Malling, Doune, Glenbank (fortlet), Bochastle, Ardoch, Kaims Castle (fortlet), Strageath, Dalginross, Bertha, Fendoch, Cargill (fort and fortlet), Inchtuthil (Legionary fortress), Cardean, Inverquharity (fortlet) and Stracathro.

===Glenblocker forts===
The forts of Drumquhassle, Menteith/Malling, Bochastle, Doune, Dalginross and Fendoch in the south-west were collectively referred to as glenblocker forts in the older literature; they are also called the Highland line forts. &quot;Glenblocker&quot; describes their location at the exit of some of the glens.

All of the forts were originally built during the Flavian occupation in Scotland. A broader group consists of
* Drumquhassle (near Drymen, overlooking the southern end of Loch Lomond and the road back to the Clyde)
* Malling (on the Lake of Menteith, overlooking the access to the Duke&#x27;s Pass and a narrow point between the mountains and the Forth Mosses)
* Bochastle (near Callander), overlooking the road to Loch Katrine and the Pass of Leny
* Dalginross (near Comrie) overlooking the Eastern end of Loch Earn
* Fendoch (north of Crieff) overlooking the Sma&#x27; Glen
* Inchtuthil (below Dunkeld) The legionary fortress at the mouth of Strath Tay, guarding the main roads to Inverness
* Inverquharity (near Kirriemuir) a fortlet-sized station at the east end of Glen Clova

Cardean, Stracathro and Doune are sited further away from their respective traffic corridors, although fulfilling the same function.

===Watchtowers===
A line of watchtowers sit on the Roman Road which you can drive along and then walk when the road turns off. There are 16 known watchtowers Ardunie Watchtower, Parkneuk Watchtower, Raith Watchtower (Site of), Muir o&#x27;Fauld Watchtower, Kirkhill Watchtower, Gask House Watchtower, Roundlaw Watchtower (Site of), Witches Knowe Watchtower Moss Side Watchtower (Site of), Thorny Hill Watchtower, Peel Roman Watchtower (Site of), West Mains Watchtower (Site of), Westerton Watchtower (Site of), Blackhill Wood Watchtower, Westmuir Watchtower, Greenloaning Watchtower. The design of the watchtowers is consistent with those on the Rhine and it is thought the Scottish ones were built first. 

===Role===
It has traditionally been thought that these forts were meant to prevent invasions out of the Scottish Highlands into Roman-held territory. This may have been the intention, in cooperation with the other forts on the Gask Ridge and along Strathmore, as only the legionary fortress of Inchtuthil with 5,000–6,000 soldiers would have been strong enough to deal with a major incursion. The smaller forts were more likely to serve as a disincentive to small-scale raiding parties.

The relationship between the Glenblocker forts and the Gask Ridge has in the past been seen as a staged withdrawal. Recent research suggests that the three elements are part of the same frontier system, stretching roughly from Loch Lomond to Montrose. In this hypothesis, the Glenblocker forts controlled access to valleys in the frontier area, which loop back into the frontier, rather than link with the Iron Age settlements further north. Their value as a block to invasion is doubtful, as their situation would have allowed supervision but they lacked the manpower to deter anything but cattle rustling.

Only the legionary fortress at Inchtuthil, conveniently situated for access into Braemar and its hinterland, is large enough to have functioned as a defensive fortification or a jumping-off point for an invasion. The Gask Road and the towers alongside it in this hypothesis guarded the strategically important link to the harbours at the Firths of Tay and Forth and the southern part of the province.
Tacitus writes in &quot;De vita Iulii Agricolae&quot; that Agricola was fighting in the area in around 80 AD; the latest coinage dates from 86 AD. This would suggest that the forts were occupied for six years at most. Recent archaeology has shown that many of the forts on the Gask Ridge were rebuilt, sometimes twice, without evidence of destruction through warfare. Further digs may cast some light on this apparent contradiction.

The forts of Ardoch, Strageath and Bertha on the Gask Road, as well as the forts of Cargill in Strathmore and the glenblocker fort of Dalginross have also produced Antonine material attesting to a reuse of the sites contemporary with the Antonine Wall. In the Severan period the army passed through the area, and several camps across Scotland are dated to this period (for example, Kair House in Aberdeenshire and the fort at Carpow Roman Fort which is on the Firth of Tay.

==North of the Gask Ridge==

The permanent sites are complemented by a series of large marching camps (large camps date to the 3rd century) from the Scottish Lowlands into Aberdeenshire and Moray. The Roman legions in the 1st century established a chain of forts at Ardoch, Strageath, Inchtuthil, Battledykes (which is unlikely to date from the same period as the Gask sites), Stracathro and Raedykes, taking the Elsick Mounth on the way to Normandykes, before going north to Glenmaillen and Auchinhove. Unconfirmed sites of possible Roman forts have also been found at Bellie, Balnageith and Cawdor.

In the 1990s researchers discovered new possible Roman fortifications north of Inverness and the Moray Firth. The most important are Tarradale and Portmahomack. These are being studied by Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland to verify that they are Roman. Several chronological reconstructions of their role have been made.

<text>Bruce Craig Beetham (16 February 1936 – 3 May 1997) was an academic and politician from New Zealand, whose career spanned the 1970s and early 1980s.

A lecturer at Hamilton&#x27;s University of Waikato and at the Hamilton Teachers&#x27; Training College, he was elected leader of the Social Credit Political League (which he had joined in 1969) in 1972, at a time when the party was in disarray and many were questioning its chances of survival. A brilliant organiser and an electrifying speaker, Beetham succeeded in rebuilding the party, and by the late 1970s it was challenging the stranglehold on the two-party system of the long-dominant National and Labour parties.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born in New Plymouth on 16 February 1936, he was the son of Stanley Develle Beetham (a carpenter) and his wife Frances Agnes Amy Watts. Beetham attended New Plymouth Boys&#x27; High School from 1951 to 1955. He then went on to the Auckland Secondary Teachers College where he eventually acquired a BA (honours) in History and later an MA. He worked as a secondary school teacher and worked in New Plymouth, Taupō and Piopio before lecturing at Hamilton Teachers&#x27; College. The Beetham family were Anglican but he instead joined a Presbyterian bible class and prior to training as a teacher he gave serious consideration to entering the ministry.

Beetham married Raewyn Natalee Mitchell, a dental nurse, on 21 August 1965 in Matamata. The two settled in Hamilton and had three sons and one daughter.

Beetham joined the then Social Credit Political League, during the 1969 general election campaign, after attending a talk by Don Bethune the Social Credit candidate for Hamilton West. Later, Beetham was elected as one of the vice presidents of the party in 1971. Also in 1971 he ran his first election campaign, an unsuccessful attempt for a position as a Hamilton City Councillor. His rapid rise in the Social Credit ranks was complete when he was elected Leader in 1972. At 36 he became the youngest leader of a political party in New Zealand&#x27;s history. He presided over Social Credit&#x27;s 1972 and 1975 election campaigns, in which they failed to get any members elected.

===Mayor of Hamilton===
In 1976, Beetham was elected Mayor of Hamilton in a by-election to replace Mike Minogue, who had resigned to take up a seat in Parliament. One of his early ideas as Mayor was to finance municipal projects with interest-free &quot;rates vouchers&quot;, but the council, dominated by his opponents, passed a 20 percent rates increase instead. His frustrations caused by political gridlock, as well as the difficulty of simultaneously leading a national political party while serving as a Mayor (a post generally expected to be apolitical in New Zealand), were factors in his decision not to seek a second term as Mayor in 1977. Ross Jansen succeeded him.

===Member of Parliament===

On 18 February 1978, Beetham won election to Parliament in a by-election for the Rangitikei electorate, to fill a vacancy caused by the death of its long-time member, the Parliamentary Speaker, Sir Roy Jack. He retained the seat in the general election later that year, and the Social Credit Political League polled 16 percent of the vote nationwide, its best result to date. His marriage to Raewyn had ended in 1978, with her remaining in Hamilton with the children. They divorced in 1980. Later that same year, Beetham married Beverley May Clark (née Morrison), who had two sons from her previous marriage, and came from a Social Credit family. Soon after the Beetham&#x27;s moved to the outskirts of Marton. Beverley was an interior decorator by profession, who helped sharpen Beetham&#x27;s style and dress sense.

In the 1981 election, the party polled just over 20 percent – the best showing for a third party since the 1920s, but fell short of its goal of holding the balance of power; its support was too evenly spread to translate into more than a couple of seats under the First-past-the-post electoral system in use at that time. The party, and Beetham himself, strongly promoted a form of proportional representation, but this was not adopted till many years later. However this saw the addition of Gary Knapp as a second Social Credit MP, meaning the party could make more of an impact inside Parliament itself.

In May 1982 National Party Prime Minister Robert Muldoon announced plans to build the controversial Clyde Dam (part of &quot;Think Big&quot;), but faced backbench dissidents voting against it. Initially opposed to the dam, Beetham and Knapp visited the dam site in Otago and reconsidered their stance. Social Credit agreed to vote for the necessary legislation in return for policy concessions from National. However, Muldoon did not deliver on most of his pledges which made Beetham and Knapp look naïve. The affair caused considerable damage to Social Credit&#x27;s popularity.

In line with his party&#x27;s policies, Beetham attempted to organise a barter trade deal with Fiji. Prime Minister Robert Muldoon vetoed the deal.

A number of factors resulted in a sharp drop in support for the Social Credit Party in the general election of 1984. One of these factors was Beetham&#x27;s ill health. A major heart attack in 1983 curtailed his activities for much of that year and early 1984, and his disappearance from the public view made it possible for a new political party, the New Zealand Party (founded by millionaire businessman Bob Jones) to fill the vacuum. This party succeeded in attracting much of the protest vote that Social Credit had previously enjoyed. Another major factor was Beetham&#x27;s earlier support for the construction of the Clyde Dam, which was strongly opposed by Social Credit&#x27;s rank and file with many supporters accusing him of betrayal.

Beetham lost his Rangitikei seat in , mainly because of electoral boundary changes; suspicions have lingered since that the redistribution may have been politically motivated (Gerrymandering). The redrawing of electoral boundaries that year saw his home town of Marton excluded from the Rangitikei electorate.

After losing his seat in Parliament, Beetham considered resigning as Social Credit leader but was persuaded to stay on after being offered a full-time salary to do so. He was then asked to stand in the seat at a by-election in June 1985. Beetham did not rule out standing, but inferred it unlikely and would do so only if Social Credit&#x27;s previous candidate in the seat was unwilling to stand again. He did not stand after Lynley Simmons, who had been Social Credit&#x27;s candidate for Timaru in 1981 and 1984, agreed to be the candidate. Out of parliament, his health improved but the party&#x27;s popularity continued to decline. In 1985 Social Credit rebranded itself as the New Zealand Democratic Party, a move Beetham had little enthusiasm for. Internal dissent began to set in and Knapp tried to convince Beetham to stand aside as leader. Beetham refused to resign and Knapp resigned as deputy leader in protest.

===Political twilight===
In 1986, Beetham lost the leadership of the party to Neil Morrison who had been elected an MP in 1984. The new leader, on the night he was elected, implied in a TV interview that the Social Credit national dividend policy was out of date and would be dropped. This was in response to a question from the interviewer, which he might not have listened to carefully. The next day Mr Beetham said he was considering resigning because the new leadership was rejecting basic Social Credit philosophy. This promoted Morrison to publicly retract his comments, and affirm that of course the national dividend would be retained as an important part of Social Credit policy. In 1988, in response to the abandonment of the party&#x27;s old name and policy platforms, he formed and led Social Credit-NZ which less of a political party but more of a pressure group organisation dedicated to furthering Social Credit monetary aims and financial principles. He was chairman of the organisation until 1995.

Beetham remained active in politics despite losing the leadership. He contested his old seat under the party&#x27;s new name in 1987; in 1990 he broke away from the Democrats and assumed leadership of a new party, under the old Social Credit banner and stood in Palmerston North instead of Rangitikei. In 1992, he attempted to put together a coalition of centrist parties, the New Zealand Centre Coalition, but was overtaken by the course of events as numerous new parties were formed around that time and crowded out the political spectrum.

His last electoral campaign was in 1996 as an independent candidate for his old Rangitikei electorate. Although placed fifth, he received almost 3,400 votes, which is a reasonable result for an independent.

===Local politics===
Following the loss of his seat in Parliament, Beetham devoted his energies to local government. In 1986 he was elected as a member of the Marton Borough Council, and was also deputy mayor, until 1989. He represented Rangitikei on the Wanganui Hospital Board (later renamed Manawatu-Wanganui Area Health Board) from 1986 to 1991. He was also elected the representative for Rangitikei on the Manawatu-Wanganui Regional Council in 1989 (where he chaired the council&#x27;s Resources and Policy Committee) and remained a member until his death.

Beetham was also a member of the Massey University Council, chairman of the board of the Palmerston North College of Education and an executive member of the New Zealand Council for Teacher Education.

===Death===
Beetham died of heart failure in 1997 at the age of 61 in Palmerston North Hospital. He had been in hospital for nearly two weeks after an angina attack. He was survived by his wife, Beverley, four children and two stepsons. His death also necessitated a by-election for the Manawatu-Wanganui Regional Council. His funeral service was held at St Stephen&#x27;s Anglican Church in Marton and attracted 450 mourners who were asked to pray for monetary reform.

==Political positions==
Beetham was known as a liberal on human rights, a conservative on moral and social issues, and a pragmatist on economic matters. His humanistic approach has been attributed to his childhood admiration of Labour Party Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage, while growing up in the Great Depression. He disliked confrontation, preferring to work for consensus in decision-making. Beetham was opposed to abortion, adhering to Social Credit&#x27;s traditional conservatism on social issues.

==Honours and awards==
In 1977, Beetham was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal. In the 1988 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for public services, and in 1990 he was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.

<doc id="871960" wikidata="Q7615037" url="?curid=871960" title="William Talbot, 1st Earl Talbot">
<text>William Talbot, 1st Earl Talbot, PC (16 May 1710 – 27 April 1782), styled as Lord Talbot from 1737 to 1761, was an English peer and Whig politician. Talbot was a notable figure among opposition Whig politicians during the reign of King George II before later coming to Court during the reign of his grandson, taking the office of Lord Steward of the Household.

==Early life and education==
Talbot was born in Worcester as the eldest surviving son of Charles Talbot, later Baron Talbot and Cecil Matthew (died 1720), daughter of Charles Matthew of Castell y Mynach, Glamorganshire. The second of five sons born to the future Baron Talbot, Talbot was educated at Eton from 1725 to 1728 and matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford on 23 January 1727, before attending Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1728. He was created DCL (Doctor of Civil Law) on 12 June 1736. In March 1734 Talbot as elected a trustee of the Georgia Society which he would remained associated with until March 1738.

==Politics==
Talbot was elected as a Member of Parliament for Glamorganshire at the 1734 general election where he succeeded outgoing Tory MP Sir Charles Kemeys. The constituency had been hitherto dominated by an alliance of three Tory peers, the Duke of Beaufort, Lord Mansel and Lord Windsor. The Mansels had dominated the seat for around forty-years until 1712 when the seat was won by a succession of two local Tory squires. Talbot stood as a Whig on the interest of his father against Bussy Mansel for the local Tories, who was noted for having a miserly disposition and a considerable fortune. Talbot narrowly won the seat over Mansel, thus being the first Whig to represent the county seat in the duration of the Hanoverian succession. In the House of Commons Talbot aligned with the Opposition Whigs under William Pulteney and was opposed to Robert Walpole and his ministry.

Talbot considered himself to be a &#x27;real Whig&#x27; and was fairly independent in his politics, associating with other Independent Whigs such as Sir Francis Dashwood, Earl Stanhope and Lord Strange, the former two being noted as close associates and friends of Talbot. These &#x27;real Whigs&#x27; promoted a political stance of &#x27;independency&#x27; which endorsed Country principles of opposing the Septennial Act, nepotism, corruption and a large standing-army, while promoting the militia system, place bills to restrict officeholders in Parliament and general measures to limit the hold of governments over the House of Commons. On these matters these Independents were broad in agreement with the Tories in opposition who they sought to differentiate themselves from through writings and semantics. Talbot expressed his political creed in a 1734 letter to Sir John Dutton where Talbot expressed:

I wish the nominal distinction of Whig and Tory abolished, as the words only, not the sense remain; a Ministerial Whig and a State Tory, when in power, are so exactly alike in their conduct, that my discernment is not sufficient to distinguish one from the other. The principles of a real Whig, in my sense of the term, are these, That government is an original compact between the governors and governed, instituted for the good of the whole community; that in a limited monarchy, or more properly regal commonwealth, the majesty is in the people, and tho&#x27;the person on the throne in superior to any individual, he is the servant of the nation;- that the only title to the crown is the election of the people; that the laws are equally obligatory to the Prince and people; that as the constitution of &quot;England&quot; is formed of three legislation branches, the balance between each must be preserved, to prevent the destruction of the whole; that elections ought to be free, the elected independent;- that a Parliamentary influence by places and pensions is inconsistent with the interest of the public; and that a Minister who endeavours to govern by corruption, is guilty of the vilest attempt to subvert the constitution;- that a standing mercenary army, in time of peace, is contrary to the laws, dangerous to the liberties, and oppressive to the subjects of &quot;Great Britain&quot;.

In the Commons Talbot was an opponent of the Court Whig administration, supporting the efforts of Tory Sir William Wyndham against the Walpole government to appoint a committee to examine the ordinance of the navy. In February 1737 Talbot vacated his seat in the House of Commons upon the death of his father, becoming Baron Talbot. Talbot for a year from March 1737 served as a common councillor within the Georgia Society, which he resigned from in 1738 after refusing to sign two applications to the Government from the society due to his strong opposition to Walpole. Despite having been deprived of his seat in the Commons, Talbot remained a notable figure within opposition circles as one of the opposition Independent Whigs. In 1747 along with Dashwood, Talbot met with Frederick, Prince of Wales who authorised the two Independent politicians to engage in careful negotiations to form a unified parliamentary opposition of Leicester House, Whigs and the Tories. After months of negotiations an opposition programme was agreed with Dashwood and Talbot remaining among Frederick&#x27;s steadiest adherents and supporters until his death in 1751. Talbot was among those who coalesced with Frederick&#x27;s agent Bubb Dodington and was promised a place in a future administration as master of the jewel office. Talbot remained an opponent of subsequent Whig administrations including that of the Duke of Newcastle which he objected to on constitutional principles and not out of want for office.

At the accession of George III in 1760, Talbot acted as Lord High Steward of the new monarch&#x27;s coronation and was summarily appointed to the Privy Council in 1761. On 19 March 1761 Talbot was created Earl Talbot and was made by Lord Bute Lord Steward of the Household, a position he would hold until his death. That January he had taken command of the newly embodied Glamorgan Militia. Talbot, much like his friend Dashwood, accepted office not out of a personal friendship or political alliance with Bute, but because they were of the opinion that the new monarch was different from his predecessor and that the new reign would reflect this shift. Thereafter Talbot&#x27;s politics seem to have aligned with those of the Court with him maintaining his household position for the remainder of his life while largely remaining uninvolved with the political questions of the day. One exception to this was with the public hostility to Dashwood cider excise in 1763 when Lord Egremont begged Talbot to attend a Glamorgan county meeting &#x27;to blast the intended opposition&#x27; to local opposition figures who pledged to repeal the excise. In autumn 1763 Talbot was among the political figures consulted by George Grenville on how best to court and appease the mainly ex-Tory Independent Country Gentlemen in the Commons, who occasionally held the parliamentary balance of power.

==Family==

Talbot had married Mary, daughter and heir of Adam de Cardonnel, secretary to the Duke of Marlborough, on 21 February 1733, at St George, Hanover Square. With his wife Talbot had two children, a daughter, Cecil, and a son, who predeceased him. He had an affair with Frances Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort (born 14 August 1711 – died 16 February 1750), wife of Henry Scudamore-Somerset, 3rd Duke of Beaufort which led to the Beauforts&#x27; divorce in 1743. Talbot and his wife had separated as a result of this in 1742. On Talbot&#x27;s character, Horace Walpole, as quoted by Eveline Cruickshanks, wrote of him:

This Lord had long affected a very free-spoken kind of patriotism on all occasions. He had some wit, and a little tincture of a disordered understanding; but was better known as a boxer and man of pleasure, than in the light of a statesman. The Duchess of——had been publicly divorced from her lord on his account; and was not the only woman of fashion who had lived with him openly as his mistress. He was strong, well made, and very comely; but with no air, nor with the manners of a man of quality. No wonder the promotion of such a minister, in a reign that advertised piety, strengthened the suspicions already entertained of the sincerity of the Court. It grew more comic still, when the new statesman appeared to be a reformer too.

Talbot had no surviving sons by the end of his life which necessitated him being created Baron Dynevor of Dynevor in the county of Carmarthen on 17 October 1780, with a special remainder in favour of daughter Cecil, and the heirs male of her body. Mary Anne Talbot claimed to be one of sixteen illegitimate children of Lord Talbot.

Talbot died 27 April 1782 at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields and was buried at St Nicholas Church in Sutton. At his death, the earldom became extinct, whilst the barony of Talbot passed to his nephew (and is now part of the earldom of Shrewsbury), and the barony of Dynevor to his daughter and thereafter to her eldest son. She had married George Rice and had two sons, the eldest of which was George Rice, 3rd Baron Dynevor.

<text>The Heritage Minutes is a series of sixty-second short films, each illustrating an important moment in Canadian history. Published by Historica Canada the &quot;Minutes&quot; integrate Canadian history, folklore and myths into dramatic storylines. Like the Canada Vignettes of the 1970s, the &quot;Minutes&quot; themselves have become a part of Canadian culture and been the subject of academic studies as well as parody.

The &quot;Minutes&quot; were first introduced on March 31, 1991, as part of a one-off history quiz show hosted by Wayne Rostad. Originally distributed to schools, they appeared frequently on Canadian television and in cinemas before feature films, and were later available online and on DVD. &quot;Radio minutes&quot; have also been made. From 1991 to 1995, 50 episodes aired. In 2012, new &quot;Minutes&quot; were produced in the lead-up to Canada&#x27;s sesquicentennial (150th anniversary of Canadian Confederation) in 2017.

The &quot;Minutes&quot; have featured appearances by some of Canada&#x27;s best-known personalities, including Jared Keeso, Michael Shanks, Calum Worthy, Colm Feore, Dan Aykroyd, and Kate Nelligan. Voice-over end narration for the Heritage Minutes has been provided by such recognizable voices as Peter Mansbridge, k.d. lang, Adrienne Clarkson, and Lloyd Robertson.

== Background ==
The thirteen original short films were broken up and run between shows on CBC Television and the CTV Network. The continued broadcast of the &quot;Minutes&quot; and the production of new ones was pioneered by Charles Bronfman&#x27;s CRB Foundation (subsequently The Historica Dominion Institute), Canada Post (with Bell Canada being a later sponsor), Power Broadcasting (the broadcasting arm of the Power Corporation of Canada), and the National Film Board. They were devised, developed, and largely narrated (as well as scripted) by noted Canadian broadcaster Patrick Watson, while the producer of the series was Robert Guy Scully.

In 2009, &quot;The Historica Foundation of Canada&quot; merged with &quot;The Dominion Institute&quot; to become &quot;The Historica-Dominion Institute&quot;, a national charitable organization. In September 2013, the organization changed its name to &quot;Historica Canada&quot;. While the foundations have not paid networks to air &quot;Minutes&quot;, in the early years they have paid to have them run in cinema theatres across the country. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has ruled that &quot;Heritage Minutes&quot; are an &quot;on-going dramatic series&quot;; each vignette thus counts as ninety-seconds of a station&#x27;s Canadian content requirements.

The first sets of &quot;Heritage Minutes&quot; were released in five segments between 1991 and 2000. A set of eight new &quot;Heritage Minutes&quot;, covering military moments in Canadian history, were released in 2005. In 2012, two new &quot;Minutes&quot; were created on the War of 1812 in anticipation of the war&#x27;s bicentenary, and in 2014 two more &quot;Minutes&quot; were released on John A. Macdonald and George-Étienne Cartier that had been filmed in and around Toronto in September 2013. To honour the centenary of the start of World War I two &quot;Minutes&quot; were released: one on the Winnipeg Falcons in 2014 and one on Canadian Nursing Sisters in early 2015. In September 2015, to commemorate the 35th anniversary of Terry Fox&#x27;s run to conquer cancer, Historica released a &quot;Minute&quot; on Fox&#x27;s inspirational run.

February 2016 saw the release of a &quot;Minute&quot; on Viola Desmond, a trailblazing black female entrepreneur from Halifax who spoke out against racial discrimination in Nova Scotia. On June 21, the 20th anniversary of National Aboriginal Day, Historica Canada released two new &quot;Minutes&quot;. The first tells the story of Chanie &quot;Charlie&quot; Wenjack, whose death sparked the first inquest into the treatment of Indigenous children in Canadian residential schools. The second, Naskumituwin, highlights the making of Treaty 9 from the perspective of historical witness George Spence, an 18-year-old Cree hunter from Albany, James Bay. On October 19, Historica Canada released another Heritage Minute that shows a story about an Inuit artist named Kenojuak Ashevak. It is also the first Heritage minute that is narrated on not just its official languages (English and French) but also a third language, where this Heritage Minute is narrated in Inuktitut.

A 2012 Ipsos Reid poll of 3,900 Canadians selected the five most popular Minutes. Tied for first place were the episodes on Jackie Robinson and the Halifax Explosion, followed by Jennie Kidd Trout, Winnie-the-Pooh and Laura Secord.

== List ==
Of the over 100 &quot;Heritage Minutes&quot; available online, one on Canadian peacekeeping in Cyprus was pulled from broadcast shortly after its 1991 premiere, and was only posted on Historica Canada YouTube channel in 2016, well being omitted from the listing on &quot;Historica Canada&quot; official website. According to The Canadian Encyclopedia published by Historica Canada:

In 2020, three Heritage Minutes were deleted from Historica&#x27;s website and Youtube channel - Louis Riel (1991), Grey Owl (1999), and Sir John A. Macdonald (2014). Historica told CTV News in 2024 that the removal of the Louis Riel Heritage Minute was due to a lack of consultation with the Métis community at the time of production, and concerns about presenting the Heritage Minute in classrooms, due to it graphically showing the hanging of the Metis Leader. However, the Manitoba Metis Federation stated that Historica had not consulted with them about removing the Heritage Minute and expressed support for the violent reality of the depiction.


== Parodies ==

* The Canadian sketch comedy shows &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;, &quot;The Rick Mercer Report&quot;, &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot;, and &quot;Rock et Belles Oreilles&quot;, have parodied the &quot;Heritage Minute&quot; format in sketches, or used the format for satire.
* The Comedy Network has aired short parodies titled &quot;Sacrilege Moments&quot;.
* Canadian rapper Classified parodied the Heritage Minute in his music video for the song &quot;O Canada...&quot;
* Canadian cartoonist Kate Beaton adapted the &quot;Heritage Minute&quot; format in a comic about Margaret Trudeau, wife of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.
* In 2007, the Internet comedy group LoadingReadyRun celebrated Canada Day by telling the story of the &quot;Heritage Minutes&quot; in the format of a &quot;Heritage Minute&quot;.
* In the second episode of season 1 of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, the main challenge is based on parodying Heritage Minutes as &quot;Her-itage Moments&quot;; the parodied ads were the one on Nellie McClung and the suffragist movement in Manitoba, and the one about Dr. Wilder Penfield&#x27;s advances in neuroscience research.

<doc id="871983" wikidata="Q1270200" url="?curid=871983" title="Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre">
<text>Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre is a Tibetan Buddhist complex associated with the Karma Kagyu school located at Eskdalemuir, Scotland.

==History==
Before the present Temple complex was built, Samye Ling centred on just one building, a former hunting lodge called Johnstone House. In 1965 the Johnstone House Trust was formed with the objectives
:to make available to the public facilities for study and meditation based on Buddhist and other religious teaching leading to mental and spiritual well-being: and to provide guidance for those in need of such help: and in particular the utilisation of the property known as Johnstone House, Eskdalemuir, for such purposes.

Initially the community there was led there by a Canadian Theravada monk named Anandabodhi. When the community declined, Anandabodhi returned to Canada; he was subsequently ordained in the Tibetan Vajrayana tradition and enthroned as Namgyal Rinpoche by the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa.
In 1967 the Johnstone House trustees invited the Tibetan lamas and refugees Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and Akong Rinpoche to take over. They named the new community &quot;Samye Ling&quot;, and were shortly joined by the thangka master-artist Sherab Palden Beru and the monk Samten. &quot;Samye&quot; refers to the first Buddhist monastic university in Tibet, while &quot;Ling&quot; means &#x27;Place&#x27;.

Trungpa Rinpoche quickly came into conflict with both Akong Rinpoche and the trustees. He drank heavily and slept with his students. He married one of these, a fifteen-year-old girl at the time the relationship began, attracting press attention. By this time he had already allegedly been banished to a nearby house and allegedly divested by the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa of his position as an official representative of the Karma Kagyu lineage. Accounts vary about this supposed event. In 1970 he left for America to form other centres definitively ending his association with Samye Ling, except for a single, brief visit at the end of the 1970s to recover his seals of office, once the Karmapa had agreed to empower him as Vidyādhara, a Holder of the Karma Kagyü Lineage.

For about the decade 1970 onwards Samten, Beru, and Akong Rinpoche together were the main resident Tibetans at the centre. They were joined during 1976 and 1977 by the Mani-pa Lama bLa mChog. During this seminal period of the 1970s, Samye Ling was the main and oldest Tibetan centre in Europe. As such, it received important visits from eminent teachers of many traditions, including first the Kalu Rinpoche (1973 and thereafter), the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa (Nov. 1975 and 12.12.-26.12.1977), Khamtrul Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyense Rinpoche and Urgyen Tulku.

In 1969, musicians David Bowie and Leonard Cohen were students at Samye Ling.
In fact Bowie not only studied Buddhism at Samye Ling, he almost became a monk there:

&quot;I was a terribly earnest Buddhist at the time [...] I had stayed in their monastery and was going through all their exams, and yet I had this feeling that it wasn&#x27;t right for me. I suddenly realised how close it all was: another month and my head would have been shaved.&quot;

The centre flourished and developed under the guidance of Akong Rinpoche and his brother Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche, who serves as both Abbot and Retreat Master.

Penelope Van Der Have was one of the donors of Rokpa Trust. 

Current Trustees include John Maxwell, retired Judge known for his work with the Birmingham Six.

Sean McGovern is the Secretary of Rokpa Trust. 

The centre includes one of the first Tibetan temples to be constructed in Western Europe, a large Stupa, and accommodation for those taking a range of courses on Buddhism, meditation, spiritual development and art.

==ROKPA trust==

The Johnstone House Trust ceased to exist in 1995 and the centre now describes itself as part of the ROKPA trust whose objectives are
:to promote Buddhism and to foster non-sectarian inter-religious dialogue and understanding. To provide medical care and therapy. To provide education. To relieve poverty.

The ROKPA trust administers a number of other centres and projects worldwide, notably the Holy Island Project which has Buddhist retreat facilities and a centre for world peace and health on Holy Island on the Firth of Clyde and its Overseas Projects on behalf of ROKPA International based in Switzerland.

A ROKPA International project based at Samye Ling to raise funds for the girls school at Kandze Monastery was successful in reaching its target of £9,449. As at 2010 the trust was actively involved in relief efforts following the Yushu earthquake.

In 2008 the total declared income of the ROKPA trust was £2,916,136. The total funds received for Overseas Projects was £294,586 of which £260,361 was disbursed to ROKPA International.

According to the Charity Commission, the current trustees of the ROKPA Trust in 2024 (Charity number: 1059293) are:

 • Abbot Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche (Chair)
 • Tsultim Palbar Lama (appointed in 2015)
 • Ani Lhamo (Edith Hope) 
 • Karma Lhamo Cosgrove 
 • John Frederick Michael Maxwell
 • Elise Kristine Sylvest Jacobsen

The trust is planning a further expansion of its Samye Ling temple project involving a major multimillion-pound extension which will eventually house a museum, a library, lecture theatres, offices and accommodation. Work began on this in early 2008. It lodged an amendment to the layout of this second phase with the Dumfries and Galloway Council on 18 June 2010.

==Preservation of Tibetan art and crafts==
Under the guidance of the Tibetan artist Sherab Palden Beru, Samye Ling has also become a centre for the creation, repair and restoration of thangkas, principally in the Karma Gadri style. Since the 1970s Sherab has trained a number of western practitioners in the highly specialised techniques needed to create thangkas. The temple walls are decorated with many examples of the work of both Sherab Palden Beru and his western pupils.

Traditional deity and monumental sculpture and the creation of prayer-wheels are also carried out at the centre under the direction of resident and visiting Tibetan experts. The grounds of the centre feature many examples of their work, such as a statue of Nagarjuna. This latter statue was sculpted by Lama Thubten Kunsal from Tashi Gonsar Gong monastery in Derge, East Tibet. On 12 October 2013 the centre announced that Thubten Kunsal has been named by Chengdu police as one of three individuals suspected of the murders of Akong Rinpoche, co-founder of the centre, and two others in Chengdu, China, on 8 October 2013.

==Scottish sensibility==

Listed as a tourist attraction by VisitScotland, the centre attracts visitors who come simply to see a spectacular gilded temple, stupas and gardens with statues of Bodhisattvas and Buddhas.

In its early days there was a history of uneasy relations with neighbouring residents, with disputes over planning applications and suspicion about behaviour of residents and visitors. Nevertheless, the centre has come to enjoy cordial relationships with the local community. Many of its original members are now incorporated into that community and its economy, providing much needed support for local concerns such as primary schools. Local leaders such as former MP and Liberal Party leader David Steel are warmly supportive.

In a 2003 interview with the &quot;Sri Lanka Daily News&quot; Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche said that the Scottish Tourist board had told him it was the 10th most visited place in Scotland:
:&quot;There seems to be something about Tibetan Buddhism which appeals to people in the West, where so many people are disillusioned with the stress and the lack of a spiritual aspect in their lives.&quot;

Popular Scottish comedian Billy Connolly often visits Samye Ling.

In 2010 Lama Yeshe Losal designed a Buddhist tartan whose colours represent the five elements in Tibetan cosmogeny:
:&quot;We are fortunate to be established as part of the Scottish community and wanted a tartan for our Sangha to show how much appreciation we have for the people, culture and tradition of Scotland&quot;.

<text>The is a Cabinet-level ministry of the government of Japan responsible for global environmental conservation, pollution control, and nature conservation. The ministry was formed in 2001 from the sub-cabinet level Environmental Agency established in 1971. The Minister of the Environment is a member of the Cabinet of Japan and is chosen by the Prime Minister, usually from among members of the Diet.

In March 2006, the then-Minister of the Environment Yuriko Koike, created a &quot;furoshiki&quot; cloth to promote its use in the modern world.

In August 2011, the Cabinet of Japan approved a plan to establish a new energy watchdog under the Environment Ministry, and the Nuclear Regulation Authority was founded on September 19, 2012.

==Organization==

* Minister&#x27;s Secretariat (大臣官房)
* (総合環境政策統括官)
* Global Environment Bureau (地球環境局)
* Environment Management Bureau (水・大気環境局)
* Nature Conservation Bureau (自然環境局)
* (環境再生・資源循環局)

==Cool Biz==
The Ministry of the Environment began advocating the Cool Biz campaign in summer 2005 as a means to help reduce electric consumption by limiting use of air conditioning and allowing the wearing of less formal officewear. This idea was proposed by then-Minister of the Environment Yuriko Koike under Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.

=== Super Cool Biz ===
Following the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, the shut down of many nuclear power plants for safety reasons lead to energy shortages. To conserve energy, the government recommended setting air conditioners at 28 degrees Celsius, switching off computers not in use, and called for shifting work hours to the morning and taking more summer vacation than usual. The government then launched a &quot;Super Cool Biz&quot; campaign to encourage workers to wear outfits appropriate for the office yet cool enough to endure the summer heat. Polo shirts and trainers are allowed, while jeans and sandals are also acceptable under certain circumstances. June 1 marked the start of the Environment Ministry&#x27;s campaign, with full-page newspaper ads and photos of ministry workers smiling rather self-consciously at their desks wearing polo shirts and colorful Okinawa kariyushi shirts. The campaign was repeated in 2012 and 2013.

<text>In physics, two experimental techniques are often called complementary if they investigate the same subject in two different ways such that two different (ideally non-overlapping) properties or aspects can be investigated. For example, X-ray scattering and neutron scattering experiments are often said to be complementary because the former reveals information about the electron density of the atoms in the target but gives no information about the nuclei (because they are too small to affect the X-rays significantly), while the latter allows one to investigate the nuclei of the atoms but cannot tell one anything about their electron hulls (because the neutrons, being neutral, do not interact with the charged electrons).

Scattering experiments are sometimes also called complementary when they investigate the same physical property of a system from two complementary view points in the sense of Bohr. For example, time-resolved and energy-resolved experiments are said to be complementary. The former uses a pulse which is well-defined in time. The latter uses a monochromatic pulse well defined in energy (its frequency is well known).

<doc id="872026" wikidata="Q5285024" url="?curid=872026" title="Diyar Bakr">
<text>Diyar Bakr () is the medieval Arabic name of the northernmost of the three provinces of the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), the other two being Diyar Mudar and Diyar Rabi&#x27;a. According to the medieval geographer al-Baladhuri, all three provinces were named after the main Arab tribes that were settled there by Mu&#x27;awiya in the course of the Muslim conquests of the 7th century. The Diyar Bakr was settled by the Rabi&#x27;a subgroup of the Banu Bakr, and hence the two provinces are sometimes referred to collectively as &quot;Diyar Rabi&#x27;a&quot;. In later Turkish usage, &quot;Diyar Bakr&quot; referred to the western portion of the former province, around Amid (which hence became known as Diyarbakır in Turkish).

Diyar Bakr encompasses the region on both banks of the upper course of the river Tigris, from its sources to approximately where its course changes from a west-east to a southeasterly direction. Its main city was Amida (Amid in Arabic), and other major settlements included Mayyafariqin, Hisn Kaifa, and Arzan. Geographically and politically, in early Islamic times the Diyar Bakr was usually part of the Jazira, but it was sometimes joined to the Armenian province to the north. In the late 9th century, it was controlled by an autonomous dynasty founded by Isa ibn al-Shaykh al-Shaybani. In the mid-10th century, the region passed into the hands of the Hamdanids, but their rule was contested by the Buyids (978–983) and after that the Marwanids. 

The Marwanid emirate ruled the region for almost a century before being annexed by the Seljuk Empire in 1084–1085. Following the Seljuk realm&#x27;s collapse after the death of Malik-Shah I in 1092, a series of small emirates established itself across the region, with the Artuqids of Mardin the most important among them. In the late 12th century, the province came under Ayyubid control, and in the mid-13th century it was divided between the Ayyubids in the east and the Seljuks of Rum, who controlled the western portion around Amida. Around 1260, the region was conquered by the Mongols, who allowed the local rulers to continue to exercise power as their vassals. In the 14th century, the region was conquered by the Aq Qoyunlu, who disputed control with the Qara Qoyunlu and the last Ayyubid princes. In the early 16th century, it was for a time occupied by the Safavids before coming under Ottoman control in 1516.

* Tomobe

On March 19, 2006, the towns of Iwama and Tomobe were merged into the expanded city of Kasama. Therefore, Nishiibaraki District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

==District Timeline==
* February 15, 1958 - The town of Kasama gained city status.
* February 1, 2005 - The village of Nanakai was merged with the town of Jōhoku, and village of Katsura (both from Higashiibaraki District), to create the town of Shirosato (in Higashiibaraki District).
* October 1, 2005 - The town of Iwase was merged with the town of Makabe, and the village of Yamato (both from Makabe District) to create the city of Sakuragawa.
* March 19, 2006 - The towns of Iwama and Tomobe were merged into the expanded city of Kasama. Therefore, Nishiibaraki District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

<doc id="872042" wikidata="Q137555" url="?curid=872042" title="Ogaden">
<text>Ogaden (pronounced and often spelled &quot;Ogadēn&quot;; , ) is one of the historical names used for the modern Somali Region. It is also natively referred to as Soomaali Galbeed (). The region forms the eastern portion of Ethiopia and borders Somalia. It also includes another region to the north known as Haud.

The Ogaden is a vast plateau located to the south and southeast of the Ethiopian Highlands, and is overwhelmingly inhabited by Somali people. It represents the westernmost region inhabited by the Somalis in the Horn of Africa. It is largely a semi-arid region and encompasses the plains between the border of Somalia and Ethiopia, extending towards the southeastern highlands, where larger cities like Harar and Dire Dawa are located near.

The primary river in the region is the Shebelle, which is fed by temporary seasonal streams. Towards the southwestern edge of the Ogaden is the source of the Ganale Doria River, which joins Dawa River to become the major Jubba River on the Somali border. The Ogaden is known for its oil and gas reserves, although development efforts have been hindered by instability prevailing in the area.

==Etymology==
The origins of the term &quot;Ogaden&quot; has been an elusive question. It is usually attributed to the Somali clan of the same name, referring only to their land originally, and eventually expanding to encompass most parts of the modern Somali Region of eastern Ethiopia. The Ogaden clan&#x27;s name itself comes from their progenitor, Abdirahman Absame&#x27;s nickname of Ogaadeen, which is a Somali term that means &quot;He who takes care of another&quot;. An alternative (possibly folk) etymology analyses the name as a combination of the Harari word &quot;ūga&quot; (&quot;road&quot;) and Aden, a city in Yemen, supposedly deriving from an ancient caravan route through the region connecting Harar to the Arabian Peninsula.

During the new region&#x27;s founding conference, which was held in Dire Dawa in 1992, the naming of the region became a divisive issue, because almost 30 different ethnic Somali clans live in the region. The ONLF sought to name the region &#x27;Ogadenia&#x27;, whilst the non-Ogadeni Somali clans who live in the same region opposed this move. As noted by Abdul Majid Hussein, the naming of the region where there are several Somali clans as &#x27;Ogadenia&#x27; following the name of a single clan would have been divisive. Finally, the region was named the Somali region.

==Demographics==
The inhabitants are predominantly ethnic Somalis, of almost 30 clans. The Ogaden clan of the Darod constitute the majority in the region, and were enlisted in the Ogaden National Liberation Movement, which is why the region is associated with the Ogaden clan. Other Somali clans in the region are Sheekhaal, Marehan, Isaaq, Geri Koombe Gadabuursi, Issa, Massare, Gabooye, Degodia, Jidle, as well as the Karanle clans of Hawiye.
==History==
There are few historical texts written about the people who lived in what is known today as the Somali Region, sometimes referred to as &quot;The Ogaden&quot; region of Ethiopia. The vast majority of the inhabitants today are Muslim and ethnically homogenous. In its early history, the Ogaden was inhabited by Harla, a now extinct people. Harla are linked to the Harari and Somali Ogaden clan. The region became one of the earliest footholds for the spread of Islam into Africa. At the time, rivalries between the established Muslims in the Ogaden were recurring with those of the littoral in Zeila.

The Ogaden region was part of the Ifat Sultanate in the 13th century and later the Adal Sultanate in the 15th century. The city of Harar, serving as the effective capital of Ogaden, became a key administrative center for Adal. In the first half of the 16th century, the Ethiopian–Adal War broke out. Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, the Imam of Adal, launched a jihad against Abyssinia in response to escalating Abyssinian incursions into Muslim territories. Repeated military expeditions from the highlands into the southeast over several decades prior significantly unified the Somali and other Muslim communities in the region, who then joined Imam Ahmed&#x27;s jihad. Abyssinian attacks were frequent and intense during the 15th and 16th centuries, but they halted in the mid-17th century, not resuming until Emperor Menelik&#x27;s expansions at the end of the 19th century. The regional successor of Ifat and Adal, the Ajuran Sultanate, governed its territories from Qalafo along the upper Shabelle River in eastern Ogaden until its decline in the 17th century.

=== 1800s ===

During the pre-colonial era the Ogaden was neither under Ethiopian rule, nor Terra nullius, as it was occupied by organized Somali communities. Independent historical accounts are unanimous that previous to the penetration into the region in the late 1880s, Somali clans were free of Ethiopian and Shewan control. It has been observed that geographers mapping out the continent of Africa for the British government in the mid to late 1800s made no reference of any Ethiopians in the Ogaden, and maps from before 1884 drew the Ethiopian Empire&#x27;s domain as confined by the River Awash. Sir Richard Francis Burton&#x27;s famous 1856 exploration book &quot;First Footsteps in East Africa,&quot; makes no mention of an Ethiopian presence while describing his time in the Ogaden.

==== Menelik&#x27;s invasions and Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty (1887–1897) ====
In 1887, Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II conquered the city of Harar during his efforts to expand the empire and in 1891, announced a programme of ambitious colonialism to the European powers. This marked the start of a tentative yet violent invasion into the Ogaden region. In the first phase of Ethiopian penetration into the region, Menelik dispatched his troops from occupied Harar on frequent raids that terrorized the region. Indiscriminate killing and looting was commonplace before the raiding soldiers returned to their bases with stolen livestock. Repeatedly between 1890 and 1900, Ethiopian raiding parties into the Ogaden caused devastation. Imperial military expeditions dispatched into the Ogaden engaged in the torching of Somali settlements, and foreign travelers in the region widely reported countless stories of suffering at the hands of the Abyssinian invaders.

Menelik&#x27;s expansion into Somali inhabited territory coincided with the European colonial advances in the Horn of Africa, during which the Ethiopian Empire imported a significant amount of arms from European powers. The large scale importation of European arms completely upset the balance of power between the Somalis and the Ethiopian Empire, as the colonial powers blocked Somalis from receiving firearms. However the Ethiopians were also defeated numerous times by poorly armed Somalis such as in 1890 near Imi where Makonnen&#x27;s troops had suffered a large defeat to Somali warriors. A British hunter Colonel Swayne, who visited Imi in February 1893, was shown &quot;the remains of the bivouac of an enormous Abyssinian army which had been defeated some two or three years before.&quot;

Before the emergence of the anti-colonial Dervish movement in the 20th century, Somalis had limited access to firearms. When European colonial powers began to exert influence in the Horn of Africa, the Brussels Conference Act of 1890 imposed an arms embargo on the Somali population. During the same period Ethiopian Emperor Menelik, who was legally armed with rifles by European powers through the port cities of Djibouti and Massawa, began expanding into Somali inhabited territories. British colonial administrator Francis Barrow Pearce writes the following concerning the Ethiopian raids into the Ogaden:The Somalis, although good and brave fighting men, cannot help themselves. They have no weapons except the hide shield and spear, while their oppressors are, as has already been recorded, armed with modern rifles, and they are by no means scrupulous concerning the use of them in asserting their authority...The Abyssinians themselves have no more claim (except that of might) to dominate the wells than a Fiji Islander would have to interfere with a London waterworks company.In 1897 in order to appease Menelik&#x27;s expansionist policy Britain ceded almost half of the British Somaliland protectorate to Ethiopia in the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1897. Ethiopian authorities have since then based their claims to the Ogaden upon the treaty and the exchange of letters which followed it. International law professor W. Michael Reisman, observed that, &quot;as a matter of law and fact, the 1897 treaty was void because it presumed an authority which the Somalis had never accorded to Great Britain.&quot; The Somalis, he notes, had given no authority to the British to transfer Somali territory to another state. In fact, the British had committed to protecting Somali territory, the primary reason for the Protectorate, and in attempting to transfer the land to Ethiopia, they were acting without competence, exceeding their jurisdiction, and concluding an agreement without the participation of the central party. Furthermore, Reisman notes that even had treaty originally been valid, it would have been invalidated by Ethiopia&#x27;s failure to commit to key legal obligations.

=== 1900s ===
As Emperor Menelik II continued his campaign of indiscriminate raiding and attacks against the Somalis of the Ogaden region between 1890 and 1899, Somali clans residing in the plains of Jigjiga were in particular targeted. The escalating frequency and violence of the raids resulted in Somalis consolidating behind the Dervish Movement under the lead of Sayyid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan. As the Ethiopian Empire began expanding into Somali territories at the start of the 1890s, the town of Jigjiga came under intermittent military occupation until 1900. At the start of the year, Abyssinian troops occupied the town with the construction of a fort in the outskirts. Subsequently, the anti-colonial Dervish Movement led by Sayid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan had its first major battle when it attacked the Ethiopian forces occupying Jigjiga to free livestock that had been looted from the local population.
The Ethiopian hold on Ogaden at the start of the 20th century was tenuous, and administration in the region was &quot;sketchy in the extreme&quot;. Sporadic tax raids into the region often failed and Ethiopian administrators and military personnel only resided in Harar and Jijiga. Control over the region was expressed through intermittent raids and expeditions that aimed to seize Somali livestock as tribute. Attempts at taxation in the region were called off following the massacre of 150 Ethiopian troops in January 1915.

In the 1920s and 1930s, there were no permanent Ethiopian settlements or administration in any Somali inhabited land, only military encampments. Due to native hostility, the region was barely occupied by Ethiopian authorities, who exerted little to no presence east of Jijiga, until the Anglo-Ethiopian boundary commission in 1934 and the Wal Wal incident in 1935. It was only after 1934 when the Anglo-Ethiopian boundary commission attempted to demarcate the border, did the Somalis who had been transferred to the Ethiopian Empire during the 1897 treaty realize what had happened. This long period of ignorance about the transfer of their regions was facilitated by the lack of &#x27;any semblance&#x27; of effective control by the Somalis to indicate that they were being annexed by Ethiopia.

In the years leading up to the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935, the Ethiopian hold on the Ogaden remained tenuous. After the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in 1936, Ogaden was attached to Italian Somaliland, becoming the Somalia Governorate within the new colony of Italian East Africa. Following the British conquest of this colony, the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement placed Ogaden under temporary British control. The British sought to unite Ogaden with British Somaliland and the former Italian Somaliland to realize Greater Somalia which was supported by many Somalis.

==== Ogaden and Haud transfer (1945–1955) ====
Following World War II, Somali leaders in the Ogaden region of Ethiopia repeatedly put forward demands for self-determination, only to be ignored by both Ethiopia and the United Nations. Ethiopia unsuccessfully pleaded before the London Conference of the Allied Powers to gain the Ogaden and Eritrea in 1945, but their persistent negotiations and pressure from the United States eventually persuaded the British to cede Ogaden to Ethiopia in 1948. The last remaining British controlled parts of Haud were transferred to Ethiopia in 1955. The population of the Ogaden did not perceive themselves to be Ethiopians and were deeply tied to Somalis in neighboring states. Somalis widely considered Ethiopian rule in the Ogaden to be a case of African colonial subjugation.

In 1948, the British Military Administration, which had been in control of the Ogaden since WWII, commenced a withdrawal. This transition saw the replacement of British officials with Ethiopian counterparts between May and July of that year in a significant handover process. In the town of Jijiga, incoming Ethiopian authorities instructed the Somali Youth League (SYL) to remove their flag, as they had declared both the party and its emblem as unlawful. The SYL defied this directive, leading to the flag being machine-gunned by an armored vehicle. This event escalated following the killing of a police officer after a grenade was thrown of the roof of the SYL headquarters. The police responded by firing into a crowd of protesters killing 25. Following this incident, Ethiopian administration resumed in Jijiga for the first time in 13 years. Then, on 23 September 1948, following the withdrawal of British forces and the appointment of Ethiopian district commissioners, areas east of Jijiga were placed under Ethiopian governance for the first time in history. The SYL was banned and an attempt was made to ban all Somali political activity in the region. Tens of thousands of Somalis fled the Ethiopian military in the Ogaden during this period, and were recognized by Britain and Italy as political refugees.

In the mid-1950s, Ethiopia for the first time controlled the Ogaden and began incorporating it into the empire. In the 25 years following the commencement of Ethiopian rule in this era, hardly a single paved road, electrical line, school or hospital was built. The Ethiopian presence in the region was always colonial in nature, primarily consisting of soldiers and tax collectors. The Somalis were never treated as equals by the Amhara invaders and were scarcely integrated into the Ethiopian Empire.

=== Post-Somali Independence ===

Following Somalia&#x27;s independence in 1960, the Ogaden was rocked by waves of popular revolts which were brutally repressed by Emperor Haile Selassie&#x27;s government - resulting in deep animosity developed towards the Amharas by the Somalis. In many towns, Somali people were barred from employment. During this period, the newly independent Somali Republic and the Ethiopian Empire under Haile Selassie were on the verge of full-scale war over the Ogaden issue, particularly in 1961 and in the border war of 1964. Though the newly formed Somali government and army was weak, it had felt pressured and obliged to respond to what Somali citizens widely perceived as oppression of its brethren by an Ethiopian military occupation. In a bid to control the population of the region during the 1963 Ogaden revolt, an Ethiopian Imperial Army division based out of Harar torched Somali villages and carried out mass killings of livestock. Watering holes were machine gunned by aircraft in order to control the nomadic Somalis by denying them access to water. Thousands of residents were driven out from the Ogaden into Somalia as refugees. At the peak of the 1963 revolt, the Somali insurgents fighting for self-determination under the banner of &#x27;Nasrallah&#x27; controlled nearly 70 percent of the Ogaden region.

For nearly a year after the 1964 war, most major Somali towns in the Ogaden were under direct military administration, and the Ethiopian government also introduced a new policy of encouraging Amhara farmers to resettle in the valuable pastureland&#x27;s available in the Ogaden that were used by Somali nomads’ herds as grazing areas. Under new laws, Somali nomads had no recognized claim to these territory and were harassed by the military as a result. Wells frequented by nomads were poisoned, and new ones were created for the incoming migration of Amhara farmers and imperial army troops concurrently launched economic warfare on the nomadic way of life by devastating massive herds of invaluable livestock.

==== 1970s ====

Throughout the late 1970s, internal unrest in the Ogaden region continued as the Western Somali Liberation Front (WSLF) waged a guerrilla war against the Ethiopian government. Ethiopia and Somalia fought the Ogaden War during 1977–78 over the region and its peoples. After the war, an estimated 800,000 people crossed the border into Somalia where they would be displaced as refugees for the next 15 years. The defeat of the WSLF and Somali National Army in early 1978 did not result in the pacification of the Ogaden. At the end of 1978 the first major outflow of refugees numbering in the hundreds of thousands headed for Somalia, and were bombed and strafed during the exodus by the Ethiopian military. During 1979, the Western Somali Liberation Front persisted in its resistance, regaining control of rural areas.

==== 1980s ====

Foreign correspondents who visited the Ogaden during the early 1980s noted widespread evidence of a &#x27;dual society&#x27;, with the Somali inhabitants of the region strongly identified as &#x27;Western Somalis&#x27;. Artificial droughts and famine were induced by the Derg regime to break down Somali opposition to Ethiopian rule in the Ogaden. In the early 1980s the Ethiopian government rendered the region a vast military zone, engaging in indiscriminate aerial bombardments and forced resettlement programs. During 1981 there were an estimated 70,000 Ethiopian troops in the Ogaden, supported by 10,000 Cuban army troops who garrisoned the regions towns.

In the years following the 1977–1978 Ogaden War, many supporters of the Western Somali Liberation Front (WSLF) became disillusioned with the organizations increasing reliance on Mogadishu and were frustrated by international portrayals of the struggle in the Ogaden as merely a border matter between Ethiopia and Somalia. They would go on to form the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF).

=== Fall of the Derg and rise of ONLF ===
After the fall of the Derg regime, an ONLF a central committee was formed in January 1992, laying the foundation for an organized and cohesive organization. By the time Mengistu had fallen, the ONLF had significantly consolidated its position in the region. Since 1992, the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front (TPLF) dominated EPRDF government sought to curb Somali demands for self-determination by influencing politics in the region. To this end the central government portrayed the ESDL as a pan-Somali organization in contrast to the Ogaden clan dominated ONLF. While many Somalis saw the ESDL as a merely an extension of the Ethiopian government, the strategy put the ONLF under greater pressure. Despite an agreement between the central government and the ONLF to cooperate on security and administration in the lead up to the 1992 elections, a mutual suspicion existed. Following the 1992 attack on Al-Itihaad, mistrust of the EPRDF within the ONLF greatly deepened.

To take part in the upcoming 1992 regional elections the two existing Somali political entities in the Ogaden, the ONLF and Al-Itihaad Al-Islamiya (AIAI), organized themselves into different constituencies across the Ogaden. Later that year the Ethiopian government forces attacked AIAI&#x27;s headquarters in the region killing several high ranking figures. Following the attack, Al-Itihaad quickly regrouped and declared a jihad against the Ethiopian military presence in the region. As fighting between AIAI and the Ethiopian military raged throughout 1992, a serious internal debate and two factions emerged within the ONLF over whether to join the war. One wing argued that it was clear that the new Ethiopian government was not serious about self-rule and democracy, so the armed struggle should be resumed. The opposing side argued that the government should still be given a chance considering the upcoming regional elections slated for December 1992. It was also noted that the organization only possessed a small military wing. Eventually the argument to refrain from joining the war and struggle through democratic means prevailed, and the government&#x27;s war against AIAI ended in a ceasefire soon before the elections.

During the December 1992 elections for District Five (what later became the Somali Region), the ONLF won 80% of the seats of the local parliament. Though the war between Al-Itihaad and the government had ended before the election, AIAI did not participate. During the new region&#x27;s founding conference, which was held in Dire Dawa in 1992, the naming of the region became a divisive issue. Almost 30 Somali clans live in the Somali Region of Ethiopia. The ONLF sought to name the region &#x27;Ogadenia&#x27;, whilst the non-Ogadeni Somali clans who live in the same region opposed this move. As noted by Abdul Majid Hussein, the naming of the region where there are several Somali clans as &#x27;Ogadenia&#x27; following the name of a single clan would have been divisive. Finally, the region was named the Somali region.

The 1995 general elections were boycotted by the majority of the ONLF, Al-Itihaad and large segments of the Ogaden population due to governments heavy handed interference in the political process. Some ONLF members who opposed the boycott participated in the elections, and performed poorly. Major discontent was provoked by the EPRDF led government after it had moved the state capital from Gode to Jigjiga in 1994. Following the boycott, the government went so far as to form another organization called &#x27;New ONLF&#x27;. The &#x27;New ONLF&#x27; and ESDL won the 1995 elections and then merged into the Somali People&#x27;s Democratic Party (SPDP).

=== 2000s ===
In 2007, the Ethiopian Army launched a military crackdown in Ogaden after Ogaden rebels killed dozens of civilian staff workers and guards at an Ethiopian oil field. The main rebel group is the Ogaden National Liberation Front under its Chairman Mohamed O. Osman, which is fighting against the Ethiopian government. Some Somalis who inhabit in the &#x27;Ogaden&#x27; claimed that Ethiopian military kill civilians, destroy the livelihood of many of the ethnic Somalis and commit crimes against the nomads in the region. However, testimony before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs revealed massive brutality and killings by the ONLF rebels, which the Ethiopian government labels &quot;terrorists.&quot; The extent of this war can&#x27;t be established due to a media blockade in the &#x27;Ogaden&#x27; region. Some international rights organizations have accused the Ethiopian government of committing abuses and crimes that &quot;violate laws of war,&quot; as a recent report by the Human Rights Watch indicates. Other reports have claimed that Ethiopia has bombed, killed, and raped many Somalis in the Ogaden region, while the United States continues to arm Ethiopia in the United States&#x27; ongoing War on Terror in the Horn of Africa.

==Geography==

The Somali Region, the second largest region in Ethiopia is around , and borders Djibouti, Kenya and Somalia. Important towns include Jijiga, Degahbur, Gode, Kebri Dahar, Fiq, Shilabo, Kelafo, Werder and Danan.

===Ecology===
The Ogaden is part of the Somali Acacia–Commiphora bushlands and thickets ecoregion. It has been a historic habitat for the endangered African wild dog, &quot;Lycaon pictus&quot;; However, this canid is thought by some to have been extirpated from Ogaden.

The Ogaden is a plateau, with an elevation above sea level that ranges from in the northwest, falling to about along the southern limits and the Wabi Shebelle valley. The areas with altitudes between are characterised as semi-arid, receiving as much as of rainfall annually. More typical of the Ogaden is an average annual rainfall of and less. The landscape consists of dense shrubland, bush grassland and bare hills. In more recent years, the Ogaden has suffered from increasingly erratic rainfall patterns, which has led to an increasing frequency of major droughts: in 1984–85; 1994; and most recently in 1999–2000, during which pastoralists claim to have lost 70–90 percent of their cattle. It also includes another region in the north known as Haud.

<doc id="872044" wikidata="Q7892539" url="?curid=872044" title="United States lightship Chesapeake (LV-116)">
<text>United States lightship &quot;Chesapeake&quot; (LS-116/WAL-538/WLV-538) is a museum ship owned by the National Park Service and on a 25-year loan to Baltimore City, and is operated by Historic Ships in Baltimore Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. A National Historic Landmark, she is one of a small number of preserved lightships. Since 1820, several lightships have served at the Chesapeake lightship station and have been called &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. Lightships were initially lettered in the early 1800s, but then numbered as they were often moved from one light station to another. The name painted on the side of lightships was the short name of the Light Station they were assigned to and was the daytime visual aspect of the many Aids to Navigation on board lightships. The United States Coast Guard assigned new hull numbers to all lightships still in service in April 1950. After that date, Light Ship 116 was then known by the new Coast Guard Hull number: WAL-538. In January 1965 the Coast Guard further modified all lightship hull designations from WAL to WLV, so &quot;Chesapeake&quot; became WLV-538.

&quot;Chesapeake&quot; had many redundant systems in order to maintain her position through most storms. The 5000-pound (2300 kg) main anchor was backed up by a second 5000-pound anchor attached to the side of the ship. The 30,000 candela main light was also backed up with a secondary lamp and the Radio Locator Beacon also had a backup system. On more than one occasion (in 1933, 1936, and 1962) the main anchor chain snapped during violent storms and the ship had to use her engines to stay in place and drop her second anchor.

==History==
The light vessel was built at Charleston Drydock &amp; Machine Co. in Charleston, S.C. for $274,434.00; the keel was laid on 6 February 1929, the ship was launched on 22 October 1930 and delivery was on 23 June 1930. She was one of six ships in the LS 100 class of lightships, which included LS 100, LS 113, LS 114, LS 115, LS 116 and LS 117. The first light station assignment for the LS 116 was the Fenwick Shoal station off the coast of Delaware, marked FENWICK. In 1933 Lightship 116 was then assigned to the Chesapeake Light Station, about 17 miles offshore from the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay. The ship was also absorbed into the Coast Guard in 1939, as were all vessels in the United States Lighthouse Service.

Service in the US Coast Guard meant a pay cut for the sailors aboard &quot;Chesapeake&quot; and other Lightships, as well as the requirements for the crew to pass Coast Guard physical exams and wear uniforms. Coast Guard officers, usually a Warrant Bos&#x27;n, were also placed in command of the lightships, which meant a more efficient, orderly and strict operation. It did also, however, mean better supplies and training reached the crew. During World War II, &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was based out of Sandwich, Massachusetts, where she served as an examination and guard vessel at the north entrance of the Cape Cod Canal and helped protect the important port of Boston. As WW2 ended, she was returned to the CHESAPEAKE light station.

In the 1960s with the introduction of automated buoys as well as permanent light stations, the lightship fleet was slowly mothballed. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; left her station at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay in September 1965 when she was replaced by a large, manned light tower similar to an oil rig. This station was helicopter accessible and was easier to maintain than a lightship. Eventually the light tower was fully automated. Eight lightships were built after &quot;Chesapeake&quot;.

&quot;Chesapeake&quot;″s last tour of duty was at the mouth of the Delaware Bay from 1966 to 1970 where she was named &quot;DELAWARE&quot;. A large 104 ton buoy beacon replaced her at this station in 1970. After leaving Delaware Bay, &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was moored in Cape May, New Jersey, until her decommissioning on 6 January 1971. She was then transferred to the National Park Service and used as a seagoing environmental education classroom until she was handed over to the city of Baltimore in 1982. In 1988 &quot;Chesapeake&quot; became part of the Baltimore Maritime Museum, now the Historic Ships in Baltimore museum and is moored at Pier 3 in Baltimore&#x27;s Inner Harbor. She is open for touring after a paid admission to the museum. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 1 August 1980 and was designated a National Historic Landmark on 20 November 1989. &quot;Chesapeake&quot; and her companions are major contributing elements in the Baltimore National Heritage Area.

<doc id="872045" wikidata="Q336657" url="?curid=872045" title="Alexander Hamilton, 10th Duke of Hamilton">
<text>Alexander Hamilton, 10th Duke of Hamilton, 7th Duke of Brandon (3 October 1767 – 18 August 1852), styled as the Earl of Angus until 1799 and Marquess of Douglas and Clydesdale from 1799–1819, was a Scottish politician and art collector.

== Life ==
Born on 3 October 1767 at St. James&#x27;s Square, London, the eldest son of Archibald Hamilton, 9th Duke of Hamilton, he was educated at Harrow School and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 4 March 1786. He received his MA on 18 February 1789.

Hamilton was a Whig, and his political career began in 1802, when he became MP for Lancaster. He remained in the House of Commons until 1806, when he was appointed to the Privy Council, and Ambassador to the court of St. Petersburg until 1807; additionally, he was Lord Lieutenant of Lanarkshire from 1802 to 1852. He received the numerous titles at his father&#x27;s death in 1819. He was Lord High Steward at King William IV&#x27;s coronation in 1831 and Queen Victoria&#x27;s coronation in 1838, and remains the last person to have undertaken this duty twice. He became a Knight of the Garter in 1836. He held the office of Grand Master Mason of the Freemasons of Scotland between 1820 and 1822. He held the office of President of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland between 1827 and 1831. He held the office of Trustee of the British Museum between 1834 and 1852.
He married Susan Euphemia Beckford, daughter of William Thomas Beckford and Lady Margaret Gordon, daughter of Charles Gordon, 4th Earl of Aboyne, on 26 April 1810 in London, England.

Hamilton was a well-known dandy of his day. An obituary notice states that &quot;timidity and variableness of temperament prevented his rendering much service to, or being much relied on by his party ... With a great predisposition to over-estimate the importance of ancient birth ... he well deserved to be considered the proudest man in England.&quot; He also supported Napoleon and commissioned the painting &quot;The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries&quot; by Jacques-Louis David.
Lord Lamington, in &quot;The Days of the Dandies&quot;, wrote of him that &#x27;never was such a magnifico as the 10th Duke, the Ambassador to the Empress Catherine; when I knew him he was very old, but held himself straight as any grenadier. He was always dressed in a military laced undress coat, tights and Hessian boots, &amp;c&#x27;. Lady Stafford in letters to her son mentioned &#x27;his great Coat, long Queue, and Fingers cover&#x27;d with gold Rings&#x27;, and his foreign appearance. According to another obituary, this time in &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine,&quot; he had &#x27;an intense family pride&#x27;.

==Death and legacy==
Hamilton had a strong interest in Ancient Egyptian mummies, and was so impressed with the work of mummy expert Thomas Pettigrew that he arranged for Pettigrew to mummify him after his death. He died on 18 August 1852 at age 84 at 12 Portman Square, London, England and was buried on 4 September 1852 at Hamilton Palace, Hamilton, Scotland. In accordance with his wishes, Hamilton&#x27;s body was mummified after his death and placed in a sarcophagus of the Ptolemaic period that he had originally acquired in Paris in 1836 ostensibly for the British Museum. At the same time he had acquired the sarcophagus of Pabasa, an important nobleman which is now in the Kelvingrove Museum. In 1842 Hamilton had begun construction of the Hamilton Mausoleum as repository for the overcrowded family vault at the Palace. He was interred there with other Dukes of Hamilton, from the 1858 completion of the Mausoleum until 1921 when subsidence and the subsequent demolition of the Palace forced removal of the bodies to the Bent cemetery in Hamilton, where he still lies buried in his sarcophagus.

His collection of paintings, objects, books and manuscripts was sold for £397,562 in July 1882. The manuscripts were purchased by the German government for £80,000. Some were repurchased by the British government and are now in the British Museum.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1810, Hamilton married Susan Euphemia Beckford, daughter of novelist William Beckford of Fonthill Abbey, Wiltshire, by Lady Margaret Gordon, daughter of the 4th Earl of Aboyne

By his wife, Hamilton had one son and one daughter:
*William Hamilton, 11th Duke of Hamilton (1811–1863), who married Princess Marie Amelie of Baden
*Lady Susan Hamilton (1814–1899), who married 1st, Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle; 2nd, Jean Alexis Op de Beeck of Brussels.

<doc id="872052" wikidata="Q5538567" url="?curid=872052" title="George Dodington (died 1720)">
<text>George Dodington (c. 1662 – 28 March 1720) of Eastbury Park, Dorset was a merchant, office holder and Whig politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons from 1705 to 1720, under the patronage of Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford.
==Early life and family==
Dodington was the eldest son of John Dodington of Dodington, Somerset and his wife Hester Temple, daughter of Sir Peter Temple, 2nd Baronet of Stowe, Buckinghamshire. His grandfather Sir Francis Dodington had been granted in trust the profits of a commissionership of appeals in excise which fell to his son. When Dodington&#x27;s father died in 1673, Sir Francis&#x27; second wife tried to claim these but Dodington&#x27;s mother counter-claimed and as a result Dodington was appointed to a post on the commission.

==Business activities==
Dodington prospered and by 1688 was part owner of four ships. In 1690 he and his partners secured lucrative contracts for supplying clothing to the army. Also, by 1687 he had started to undertake occasional work for the Treasurer of the Navy - and was finally in the service of Admiral Edward Russell. In 1695, Russell appointed him his paymaster and office manager, as a result of which Russell, who became Earl of Orford in 1697, became a powerful patron throughout his career. Dodington was a commissioner for Greenwich Hospital in 1695, commissioner for taking subscriptions to the land bank in 1696 and was appointed trustee for Exchequer bills in 1697. His increasing wealth allowed him to become a significant subscriber under both posts. He married by licence dated 12 February 1697 Eleanor Bull, daughter of Henry Bull MP.

==Political career==
In the late 1690s, Dodington became a target of Lord Orford&#x27;s enemies who smeared him with financial impropriety in his offices, as an indirect attack on his patron. Although he could argue in his own defence and was supported by the Whigs, he lost his offices as paymaster and trustee for exchequer bills, and spent five years sorting out Orford&#x27;s accounts. At the 1705 general election, he was returned unopposed as Whig Member of Parliament for Winchelsea. Although his father on his death told him to sell the Winchelsea estate, he did not, and so maintained an electoral interest there. In 1706, he was appointed secretary to the English commissioners for the Union with Scotland and became a trustee for a loan to the Emperor. He was Chief Secretary for Ireland from 1707 to 1708 and represented Charlemont in the Irish House of Commons from 1707 to 1713. At the 1708 general election, he was returned again for Winchelsea and also for Bridgwater and chose to sit for Bridgwater. From 1708 to 1710 he was one of the Lords of the Admiralty. He was returned again at Bridgwater in 1710. In 1711 he became a commissioner for taking subscriptions to the South Sea Company. However he was threatened with strong opposition at Bridgwater at the 1713 general election and had himself returned for Winchelsea instead. He became an Irish Privy Councillor in 1714 and Clerk of the Pells for Ireland in 1715.

At the 1715 general election, Dodington was returned unopposed as MP for Bridgwater. Also from 1715 he was Lord Lieutenant of Somerset. He became very rich and commissioned Sir John Vanbrugh to design a large mansion to be built on his estate in Eastbury.

==Death and legacy==
Dodington died on 28 March 1720 and left his estate to his nephew George Bubb, who assumed the surname of Dodington and commissioned the building of Eastbury Park.

<text>The Austin Sixteen Light Six is a British car that was made by Austin from 1927. Announced in October 1927, the first deliveries were planned for March 1928.

To distinguish the car from the smaller engined models in the range a plated &quot;Austin Six&quot; script was fixed to the radiator grille.

==1927==
The Austin Sixteen was introduced as a medium saloon sitting within Austin&#x27;s range above the Seven and Twelve models but still much smaller than the 3.6 Litre Twenty.

The six-cylinder engine was new but had similarities to the engine fitted to the Twenty with its timing chain at the rear of the block. The design was up to date with the gearbox mounted in-unit with the engine and semi elliptic springs all round for the suspension. Triplex safety glass was fitted to all front screens from March 1929.

A wide range of body types was available at first but was simplified over the years. The coupés went first in 1930 followed by the Weymann type fabric saloons in 1931.

==1934==
In August 1933 various improvements were announced for 1934 models. The gearbox gained synchromesh on 3rd and 4th gears and an alternative larger (2511 cc) 18 hp engine was made available at no extra charge. An early automatic gearbox was available between 1934 and 1936 but few sold. A longer wheelbase chassis became an option.

Of this version 5742 16s and 2630 18s were made.

===Hayes selfselector transmission===
&quot;This provides a drive which is automatic in variation of ratio within limits, easily set by a finger and thumb lever on the top of the steering wheel. The actual transmission is through steel rollers which transmit the drive between curved steel races, the ratio being altered by rocking the rollers to different driving positions to engage with differing diameters of the driving and driven races. There are no gears—except for reverse—and a wide variation in ratios is available automatically. The driving rollers are rocked or precessed to give varying ratios by hydraulic means and the driver by his little lever can modify the performance as road conditions require. Subject to the control setting, the automatic functioning ensures a constant engine speed whatever the tractive resistance met with on the road, the transmission varying its ratio to balance the resistance as it increases or decreases. The engine speed by creating oil pressure in the hydraulic control system, tends to precess the rollers to give a high ratio drive. This is counterbalanced by the reaction of the tractive resistance, which tends to give a low ratio precession. A valve worked by the movement of the forward and reverse lever which engages the drive —in the ordinary way and is centrally placed like the ordinary speed lever—releases the pressure in the hydraulic control unit when the lever is in its neutral and reverse positions, so that the drive is always at low ratio for starting from rest or reversing.

&quot;The finger and thumb control lever works in a small quadrant which is marked at the top &quot;Traffic&quot; then &quot;High&quot; and at the bottom &quot;Low&quot; and finally &quot;Cold&quot; with spaces in between. Variations of this lever govern engine speeds. The forward, neutral and reverse positions for the central hand lever are stepped. To start the car from rest a driver presses out his clutch, moves his hand lever forward, and lets in the clutch in the ordinary way with slight acceleration. Thereafter the whole of the drive is done with the accelerator pedal, the accelerator allowing the engine to run up and keep constant maximum speed governed by the control lever on the top of the steering wheel by which engine braking power can also be regulated. When the accelerator is pressed after being released the effect is rather similar to that with a free wheel in use, in that the engine picks up to the speed that is suitable to the drive. The engine is available as a brake, and greater power of this kind can be had by moving the control lever down towards low&quot;Motoring correspondent, &quot;The Times&quot;

==1935==
Further upgrades were made in 1935. The body range was simplified and now had only the 5 and 7 seat saloons. Externally the most obvious change was to the radiator surround which was painted body colour rather than chrome plated, and a small external boot was added to the rear which contained the spare wheel. Synchromesh was added to second gear. The larger engine was modified to have only four rather than eight main bearings.

==1937==
In 1937, the last year this car was made, the smaller engined Sixteen was dropped and pressed steel road wheels replaced the previously fitted wire wheels.

Between 1935 and 1937 12,731 were produced.

==Performance==
The 16 hp engined car could reach and return depending on the body fitted.

==Catalogue 1927 to 1937==
The first name for this car was Austin Sixteen Light Six. In 1930 Light Six was dropped and it was an Austin Sixteen. From 1933 it was deemed necessary to offer an 18 hp engine at no extra charge, in mid 1937 this car&#x27;s body was replaced by a new shape only available with the 18 hp engine and known as an Austin Eighteen.

<doc id="872096" wikidata="Q4974067" url="?curid=872096" title="Sally Jessy Raphael">
<text>Sally Lowenthal (born February 25, 1935), better known as Sally Jessy Raphael, is an American retired tabloid talk show host, who is best known for her program &quot;Sally&quot; (originally called &quot;The Sally Jessy Raphael Show&quot;).

==Early life and education==
Lowenthal was born on February 25, 1935, in Easton, Pennsylvania. She attended and graduated from Easton Area High School. She also spent time in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where her father, Jesse Lowenthal, was in the rum exporting business and her mother, Zelda Lowenthal (aka Dede Lowry), ran an art gallery. She has a younger brother, Steven Lowenthal.

She spent some of her teenage years in Scarsdale, New York, where one of her first media jobs was at the local AM radio station, WFAS. In the late 1950s, the station had a program by and for junior high school students and Raphael had the opportunity to read the news on the air. She later attended the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and went to the Caribbean / West Indies islands to attend the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan. Raphael studied acting under the tutelage of Sanford Meisner at New York City&#x27;s noted Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre.

She took her mother&#x27;s maiden name of Raphael as her professional last name and plucked the theatrical surname of Jessy from her father&#x27;s family to use as a distinguishing middle name.

==Career==

===Journalism and broadcasting===
Following her graduation from the Columbia University on Morningside Heights in northwest Manhattan borough of New York City, she became a news correspondent, covering Central America because of her Puerto Rican heritage and connections for the two major competing American news-gathering syndicates of the time, Associated Press (A.P.) and the United Press International (U.P.I.), also thanks in large part to her ability to speak both English and Spanish fluently and to easily translate and switch between the two. She also obtained considerable experience in the media in Puerto Rico, where she worked in both radio and television. One of her first jobs was hosting a TV cooking show. While working in radio, she met the man who became her second husband, Karl Soderlund, who was the general manager of a radio station there that hired her. After he was unfortunately fired, the two left Puerto Rico to work back on the continent in Miami, Florida (with its heavily bi-lingual Hispanic population). While Raphael was on the air as a radio announcer in Miami, she met and became friends with veteran journalist and talk show host Larry King, who later became a nationally famous and legendary with his late night wide-ranging radio interview program on the Mutual Broadcasting System in late 1970s and early 1980s, and later on cable television as hosted nightlive TV talk show host &quot;Larry King Live&quot; on CNN (Cable News Network), which aired from 1985 to 2010.

Raphael&#x27;s broadcasting career was not an immediate success. She told numerous reporters over the years that she bounced around from station to station in both Puerto Rico and the United States, working as a disc jockey, news reporter, and the host of a show where she interviewed celebrities. She worked at 24 various stations, and was fired from 18 of them. In the early 1980s, she was asked to do a call-in advice show on WMCA in New York City. In the late 1980s, she played herself on the &quot;The Equalizer&quot; TV series in the episode &quot;Making of a Martyr&quot;.

===Talk show===
Raphael&#x27;s husband Karl Soderlund assumed the role of her manager, and was a partner in her two biggest successes. She hosted a radio call-in advice show distributed by NBC Talknet that ran from 1981 to 1987, but she is best known for hosting the television talk show &quot;The Sally Jessy Raphael Show&quot; (later shortened to &quot;Sally&quot;), which ran in first-run syndication from October 17, 1983, to May 24, 2002. &quot;Talknet&quot; was brand new when she came to the attention of producer Maurice Tunick. According to David Richards of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Tunick had auditioned a number of potential hosts, but hadn&#x27;t yet found the right one. Tunick gave Raphael a one-hour trial run on NBC&#x27;s Washington, D.C., affiliate, WRC, in August 1981. Before going on the air, she decided that rather than doing a political show, she would give advice and discuss subjects she knew a lot about, such as relationship problems. Soon, her advice show was being heard on over 200 radio stations, and she developed a loyal group of fans.

One of those fans turned out to be iconic talk show host Phil Donahue, who happened to hear her show one night and liked how she related to the audience. His encouragement led to a tryout on television, where producer Burt Dubrow gave her a chance to be a guest host on his talk show. She was not very polished, but people who had loved her radio show were very positive about her being on TV. Her non-threatening and common-sense manner appealed to Dubrow, who believed she would gain more confidence as she got some TV experience. By mid-October 1983, she was given her own show on KSDK-TV in St. Louis. &quot;The Sally Jessy Raphael Show&quot; was only a half-hour, but it was the beginning of her successful career as a talk show host. 

Raphael became known to television viewers for her oversized red-framed glasses, a trademark that began entirely by accident. The source of her famous red-framed glasses goes all the way back to her first broadcast news job. Raphael had difficulty reading the teleprompter and, with five minutes before air time, quickly went to a store across the street from the studio to purchase a pair of reading glasses. The only one she could find was a red pair. While her bosses disliked them, the audience seemed to think they looked good, so she kept wearing that style.

By 2000, both Raphael and The Jerry Springer Show were in decline. As one media critic observed, Springer&#x27;s ratings were the lowest they had been in three years, but Raphael&#x27;s ratings were the lowest they had been in 12 years. Raphael was already having problems with her syndicator: she believed that USA Networks Inc. was more interested in doing promotion for Springer, whose show was more popular than hers, and for Maury Povich, who had recently left Paramount Television to join USA&#x27;s syndication arm, than they ever were for her own show. She celebrated her 3,500th episode in early 1998. By March 2002, it was announced that, after an 18-year run, her show was being cancelled. In 2002, Raphael was named by &quot;Talkers Magazine&quot; to both their 25 Greatest Radio Talk Show Hosts of all time (#5), and the 25 Greatest Television Talk Show Hosts of all time (#11). She was one of only three personalities to make both the radio and the TV lists.

From approximately 2005 to 2008, she hosted a daily radio show, &quot;Sally Jessy Raphael on Talknet&quot; (previously called &quot;Sally JR&#x27;s Open House&quot;), on the Internet and in syndication to local radio stations. The show&#x27;s flagship station was WVIE, broadcasting from Baltimore, Maryland, and the show aired on numerous AM stations in New England, the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest, in addition to one station KWFM in Arizona. The show also aired on XM Satellite Radio&#x27;s America&#x27;s Talk channel from November 19, 2007, until its end eight months later. The name &quot;Talknet&quot; is a revival of the name of the old NBC Talknet, the now-defunct radio network that carried her previous radio show from 1981 to 1987. She abruptly ended the Talknet program July 7, 2008.

On November 10, 2010, Raphael, along with former famous national talk show hosts Phil Donahue, Geraldo Rivera, Ricki Lake and Montel Williams, were invited as guests on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;.

Raphael offered to induct conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh (1951–2021), into the Radio Hall of Fame when he was voted into the Hall in 1993. Surprised by the offer, Limbaugh accepted, only to see Raphael use her speech to speak out against the vote and excoriate Limbaugh. The following day, longtime radio news commentator Paul Harvey used his radio program to defend Limbaugh, who was privately hurt by Raphael&#x27;s betrayal. In an act of retribution, one of Limbaugh&#x27;s staffers slipped a picture of Raphael without her makeup or trademark glasses (taken from one of Raphael&#x27;s staffers, as both hosts worked in the same studio at the time) onto Limbaugh&#x27;s television program without his knowledge.

In 2014, Raphael hosted the Logo web series &quot;Sally Jessy Rides&quot;.

In 2024, Raphael cameo in the &quot;Everybody Still Hates Chris&quot; episode &quot;Everybody Still Hates Drew’s Brother&quot;.

==Personal life==
Raphael was married for the first time in 1956 to Andrew Vladimir; they divorced seven years later. They had two daughters, Allison and Andrea, and two grandsons, Max and Kyle. Allison died at the age of 33 on February 2, 1992; her death was ruled an accidental overdose because of &quot;combined effects of several prescribed drugs and over-the-counter medications.&quot;

She married Karl Soderlund in 1963. He later became her manager. They have one adopted son, Jason, and three foster children. They were married for 57 years until Soderlund&#x27;s death in 2020.

<text>Ruth Hyde Paine (born September 3, 1932) is a former friend of Marina Oswald, who was living with her at the time of the JFK assassination. According to official government investigations, including the Warren Commission, Lee Harvey Oswald stored the 6.5 mm caliber Carcano rifle used to shoot U.S. President John F. Kennedy in Ruth Paine&#x27;s garage, unbeknownst to her and her husband, Michael Paine.

Ruth Paine answered more than 5,000 questions for the Warren Commission. There were over 500 witnesses for the Warren Commission, and the average number of questions asked for each witness was less than 300. Furthermore, Ruth Paine has given more interviews than any other Warren Commission witness, always consistent with her Warren Commission testimony.

== Early life ==
Paine was born Ruth Avery Hyde in New York City to William A. and Carol E. Hyde. She went to Antioch College in Ohio and became a Quaker. She met her future husband Michael Paine through her interest in folk dancing and music. Though not a Quaker himself, Michael attended meetings with Ruth. They married on December 28, 1957.

In 1959 Michael Paine got a job with Bell Helicopter in Fort Worth, Texas, 30 miles from Dallas, and the Paines moved into a house in the suburb of Irving (Michael Paine&#x27;s step-father, Arthur M. Young, designed the first Bell Helicopter). As liberals in Dallas, the Paines were isolated, and Ruth Paine was quite lonely.

Ruth Paine had been studying Russian since 1957. In the late 1950s, she participated in Quaker pen pal programs and the East-West Contact Committee, which sponsored visits by three Soviets to the US. In 1963 she signed up to teach a summer class in Russian at St. Mark&#x27;s School in Dallas, but only one student signed up (William Hootkins, who became an actor and had a minor role in the movie &quot;Star Wars&quot; as X-wing pilot Jek Porkins).

Ruth Paine met the Oswalds through her interest in the Russian language. She had learned to read Russian but needed help with conversational Russian. Also, she and Michael Paine were separated at this time. A mutual friend from their Madrigal singing group, Everett Glover, invited her to a party at his apartment on February 22, 1963, because he thought she would be interested in meeting two interesting people who spoke Russian.

The attendance of the couple, Lee and Marina Oswald, was arranged by Oswald&#x27;s friend, 51-year-old White Russian émigré aristocrat George de Mohrenschildt, a well-educated petroleum geologist with intelligence connections.

==John F. Kennedy assassination==

===Involvement with Oswald family===
Ruth Paine drove Marina Oswald to New Orleans when the Oswalds moved there in May 1963 and back to Dallas when they moved again in September 1963. When the Oswalds resettled in the Dallas area, Marina and her child with Lee, June, moved in with Ruth Paine in the suburb of Irving, Texas, while Lee stayed in a boarding house under the name O.H. Lee. The second Oswald child was born after Marina moved in. Marina helped with the housework and Ruth&#x27;s Russian studies while Lee visited on weekends. Michael and Ruth had long been separated, but remained on good terms. Michael was a frequent visitor and cared for his children deeply. At the suggestion of a neighbor, Linnie Mae Randle, Ruth Paine told Lee Oswald about a job opportunity at the Texas School Book Depository.

Lee Harvey Oswald stayed at the Paine home with Marina and his children unannounced on Thursday night, November 21, 1963—the night before President Kennedy was assassinated. When Oswald left for work on the morning of November 22, he brought a large package that he had kept in the Paine&#x27;s garage with him to work at the Texas School Book Depository. Oswald&#x27;s coworker and friend, Wesley Frazier testified that Oswald told him the bag contained curtain rods. The Warren Commission later concluded that the package actually contained the rifle used by Oswald in the assassination.

Eight days after the assassination of President Kennedy, on November 30, 1963, Ruth Paine inadvertently discovered evidence possibly linking him to an attempted assassination of General Edwin Walker. Among the letters that Ruth Paine reportedly sent to Marina was a thick book of household advice in Russian. The book contained an undated note left by Lee for Marina on April 10, 1963 (the day of the Walker assassination attempt) that Marina later testified she had concealed. Before the Kennedy assassination, Dallas police had no suspects in the Walker shooting.

===Aftermath of assassination===
Ruth Paine testified before the Warren Commission. She said she would not use the word &quot;mister&quot; as it was &quot;contrary to Quaker practice&quot; though she later called Guy Mamantov &quot;Mr. Mamantov&quot;. She described an &quot;Impression of the Impression&quot; routine, with Michael and Lee Oswald: &quot;It has to be my impression of his impressions. I don&#x27;t recall the evening too well, the evening of the second. I do recall we certainly had dinner together. I can&#x27;t recall what the predominant language was. Lee and Michael, of course, talked in English. Not wanting to exclude her entirely from the conversation, I made opportunity to talk with her in Russian after the meal was over. She and I did the dishes and talked in Russian, and we were in the kitchen while Michael was talking to Lee in English in the living room, so I do not know what was said then between the two of them.&quot;

Paine has been interviewed by several authors, including Priscilla Johnson McMillan, William Manchester, Thomas Mallon, and Gerald Posner. She also testified in Jim Garrison&#x27;s trial of Clay Shaw. Paine was not called to testify before the House Select Committee on Assassinations. She even testified at a 1986 mock trial of Lee Harvey Oswald.

After the assassination, Marina and Lee Oswald&#x27;s mother, Marguerite, briefly stayed with Ruth Paine until Marina was taken into custody by the Secret Service. Marguerite and Lee&#x27;s brother Robert did not like Ruth Paine, which may have influenced Marina Oswald. They thought Paine sought attention for herself, an opinion Marina would later express before the Warren Commission. When Marina testified in the Shaw trial, she said she had been &quot;advised by the Secret Service not to be connected with (Ruth Paine)...She was sympathizing with the CIA.&quot; Ruth wrote to Marina incessantly, with letters that took an almost desperate tone, but received no response except for a Christmas card. They met briefly in 1964 but have not seen each other since. Paine heard news about Marina through author Priscilla Johnson McMillan until McMillan&#x27;s relationship with Marina broke off in the early 1980s.

Ruth Paine returned to Pennsylvania and became principal of a Quaker school in the Greene Street Friends School in Germantown. She soon moved to St. Petersburg, Florida and earned a master&#x27;s degree in psychology from the University of South Florida. After working for the school system in Franklin County in the Florida Panhandle, she returned to St. Petersburg and worked for the Hillsborough County, Florida school system until her retirement. She is active in Quaker and liberal charities and organizations and lives in Santa Rosa, California.

The City of Irving bought the former Paine home on W. 5th St. in 2009 to restore it to its 1963 condition and turn it into a museum in time for the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination on November 22, 2013.

Author and researcher Sylvia Meagher wrote:

Ruth Paine...is a complex personality, despite her rather passive façade...Some examples from her testimony show a predisposition against Oswald and a real or pretended friendliness toward the FBI and other Establishment institutions, which should not be overlooked in evaluating her role in the case...Mrs. Paine is sometimes a devious person, and her testimony must be evaluated in that light.

Paine has expressed her belief in the official conclusion that Oswald acted alone and has denied conspiracy theorists&#x27; suggestions to connect her and Michael to their relatives and ancestors holding important government and business positions, such as her sister, Sylvia Hyde Hoke, being listed as an employee of CIA .

In Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;JFK&quot;, the Paines are depicted as the highly suspect Bill and Janet Williams, played by Gary Carter and Gail Cronauer. While most names in the movie &quot;JFK&quot; were not changed, the Paines were renamed to avoid potential legal action. (The name Janet Williams was used again in the 1993 TV movie &quot;Fatal Deception: Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald&quot;, in which Quenby Bakke played the role.) The 2022 documentary &quot;The Assassination &amp; Mrs. Paine&quot; explores the Paines and their connections to the assassination.

<text>John Carroll, VC (16 August 1891 – 4 October 1971) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was also known as Jack Carroll.

==Early life==
Born in Brisbane, Queensland to Irish parents, Carroll moved to Western Australia while still a child. He worked as a labourer and railway guard before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force as a private in April 1916.

==Military career==
Joining the Australian 3rd Division, Carroll was originally a reinforcement for the Western Australian 44th Battalion before moving to the New South Wales 33rd Battalion in November 1916.

On 7–12 June 1917 at St. Yves, Belgium, during the Battle of Messines, Private Carroll rushed the enemy&#x27;s trench and bayoneted four of the occupants. He then noticed a comrade in difficulty and went to his assistance, killing another of the enemy. Next, he single-handedly attacked a machine-gun team, killing three of them and capturing the gun. Later, two of his comrades were buried by a shell; in spite of heavy shelling and machine-gun fire, he managed to rescue them.

Carroll was later severely wounded at Passchendaele in October 1917. His rehabilitation was successful but after briefly returning to his unit, the Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes, then in England, arranged for furlough to Australia for Victoria Cross recipients to help recruiting in Australia.

It has been claimed that Carroll failed on three occasions to appear at Buckingham Palace for his Victoria Cross award ceremony and when he did turn up on the fourth occasion he took advantage of one of the entitlements of VC recipients to call out the Palace Guard. These stories first appeared in the Perth Daily News on 2 November 1927, and the source of the story would seem to be Carroll himself. He related the story while he was in hospital after an industrial accident in which one of his feet was amputated. Just out of surgery and presumably still in pain, he was interviewed by a reporter who does not seem to have checked the veracity of the stories.

In addition to the Victoria Cross, Carroll was awarded the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.

==Later life==
Carroll died on 4 October 1971, at the age of 80, and is buried in Karrakatta Cemetery, Perth, Western Australia. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

==Legacy==
The John Carroll ward at the former Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood is named in his honour. In addition, a street in the suburb of Hughes in Canberra, the capital of Australia, is named after Private Carroll (the suburb being named after Prime Minister Billy Hughes). On Anzac Day 2018, Carroll and fellow VC recipient Thomas Axford, were honoured with a paver on the Walk of Fame in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia.

<doc id="872129" wikidata="Q6130229" url="?curid=872129" title="James Brindley Nicolson">
<text>James Brindley Eric Nicolson, (29 April 1917 – 2 May 1945) was a fighter pilot and wing commander in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. He was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, for his actions in August 1940 during the Battle of Britain.

==Early life==
James Brindley Eric Nicolson was born in Hampstead, London, on 29 April 1917. He studied at the Yardley Court and Tonbridge School. In 1935, Nicolson began his career as an engineer at Ricardo Engines. In 1936, he joined the Royal Air Force, with the service number 39329. After his training, he joined No. 72 Squadron in 1937 and later moved to No. 249 Squadron in 1940.

==Second World War==

Nicolson was 23 years old and a flight lieutenant in No. 249 Squadron during the Second World War when he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 16 August 1940 having taken off from RAF Boscombe Down near Salisbury, Nicolson&#x27;s Hawker Hurricane was almost certainly fired on by the Messerschmitt Bf 109 of Heinz Bretnütz of II./JG 53, who returned to base with claims for two Hurricanes following this action. Nicolson&#x27;s engine was damaged and the petrol tank set alight. As he struggled to leave the blazing machine, he saw another Messerschmitt, managed to get back into the bucket seat, pressed the firing button, and continued firing until the enemy plane dived away to destruction. He was able to open his parachute in time to land safely in a field. On his descent, he was fired on by members of the Home Guard, who ignored his cry of being a RAF pilot.

===Victoria Cross citation===
The announcement and accompanying citation for the decoration was published in supplement to the London Gazette on 15 November 1940, reading

Fully recovered by September 1941, Nicolson was posted to India in 1942. Between August 1943 and August 1944, he was a squadron leader and commanding officer of No. 27 Squadron, flying Bristol Beaufighters over Burma. During this time, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

As a wing commander, Nicolson was killed on 2 May 1945 when a RAF B-24 Liberator from No. 355 Squadron, in which he was flying as an observer, caught fire and crashed into the Bay of Bengal. His body was not recovered. He is commemorated on the Singapore Memorial.

Nicolson was the only Battle of Britain pilot and the only pilot of RAF Fighter Command to be awarded the Victoria Cross during the Second World War. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Air Force Museum, Hendon, England.

==Commemoration==
In 2015, the RAF repainted a modern Eurofighter Typhoon jet, ZK349, in Second World War colours, and applied Nicolson&#x27;s squadron number, GN-A, to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.

<text>(; MLK; ), full name  (m-l; ), was a communist political organization in Sweden formed in 1970 by (Left Youth League), the youth organization of VPK. Within VUF several ultraleftist tendencies had surged during the 1960s, orientating it toward Maoism. VUF broke with VPK in 1968; in 1970, they formed MLK. MLK was ideologically almost identical with the larger KFML/SKP, with Marxism–Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought as the ideological backbone. MLK supported KFML/SKP in elections.

Notable former members include later Left Party leader Gudrun Schyman.

MLK suffered a major split in 1972 when a group under leadership of Anders Carlberg (had been the chairman of VUF) left MLK and formed &quot; (League COMMUNIST).

MLK published &#x27;,&#x27; and &quot; (in Finnish). The two latter ones were published between 1971 and 1978. Between 1980 and 1982, MLK and Kommunistisk Ungdom, the new VPK youth organisation, were involved in a legal dispute over the right to publish newspapers using the name Stormklockan, with MLK winning the dispute in the Court of Appeal for Western Sweden.

MLK maintained four bookstores, named after Set Persson, in Stockholm, Trollhättan, Sundsvall and Kiruna.

In 1981, MLK unified itself with Röd Ungdom, the youth organization of SKP.

<doc id="872141" wikidata="Q1526305" url="?curid=872141" title="Hebrew Union College – Jewish Institute of Religion">
<text>The Hebrew Union College – Jewish Institute of Religion (also known as HUC, HUC-JIR, and The College-Institute) is a Jewish seminary with three locations in the United States and one location in Jerusalem. It is the oldest extant Jewish seminary in the Americas and the main seminary for training rabbis, cantors, educators and communal workers in Reform Judaism. HUC-JIR has campuses in Cincinnati, Ohio, New York City, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem. The Jerusalem campus is the only seminary in Israel for training Reform Jewish clergy.

==History==

HUC was founded in Cincinnati in 1875 under the leadership of Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise. Jacob Ezekiel was Secretary of the Board, registrar, and treasurer from the College&#x27;s inception until just before his death in 1899. The first rabbinical class graduated in 1883. The graduation banquet for this class became known as the Trefa Banquet because it included food that was not kosher, such as clams, soft-shell crabs, shrimp, frogs&#x27; legs and dairy products served immediately after meat. At the time, Reform rabbis were split over the question of whether the Jewish dietary restrictions were still applicable. Some of the more traditionalist Reform rabbis thought the banquet menu went too far, and sought an alternative between Reform Judaism and Orthodox Judaism which led to the founding of American Conservative Judaism.

In 1950, HUC gained a second campus when it merged with the rival Reform Jewish Institute of Religion (JIR) in New York. JIR was previously affiliated with the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue next door. Additional campuses were added in Los Angeles in 1954, and in Jerusalem in 1963.

In 1979, HUC moved its New York campus from the original JIR building to 1 West Fourth Street in Greenwich Village. The Jewish Association for Services for the Aged took over the building until 1997, when the Ramaz School, in an expansion deal for itself and York Prep School, bought the building and traded it with York for their prior campus on the block of Ramaz. In January of 2025, the building on West 4th Street was sold to New York University for $75 million, and will leave the property by 2027, pending renovation of its new location in another building in Manhattan.

Hebrew Union College – Jewish Institute of Religion is an international seminary and graduate school offering a wide variety of academic and professional programs. In addition to its Rabbinical School, the College-Institute includes Schools of Graduate Studies, Education, Jewish Non-Profit Management, sacred music, Biblical archaeology and an Israeli rabbinical program.

The Los Angeles campus runs many of its programs and degrees in cooperation with the neighboring University of Southern California. Their collaboration includes the creation of the Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement, an interfaith think tank through the partnership of HUC, USC and Omar Foundation. CMJE holds religious text-study programs across Los Angeles. 

Rabbi Alfred Gottschalk was appointed as HUC&#x27;s sixth president, following the death of Nelson Glueck. As president, Gottschalk oversaw the growth and expansion of the HUC campuses, the ordination of Sally Priesand as the first female rabbi in the United States, the investiture of Reform Judaism&#x27;s first female hazzan and the ordination of Naamah Kelman as the first female rabbi to be ordained in Israel.

In 1996, Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman was appointed as the 7th President of the College-Institute. He was succeeded in 2000 by Rabbi David Ellenson as the 8th President. The 9th president of HUC-JIR, elected in 2014, was Rabbi Aaron D. Panken, Ph.D. A noted authority on rabbinic and Second Temple literature, with research interests in the historical development of legal concepts and terms, Rabbi Panken was killed in a plane crash on May 5, 2018, while piloting a single-engine Aeronca 7AC over New York&#x27;s Hudson Valley.

Andrew Rehfeld was elected the 10th president on December 18, 2018, and inaugurated at Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati on October 27, 2019.

On April 11, 2022, the Board of Governors at HUC voted to shutter the residential rabbinical program in Cincinnati by 2026 due to financial troubles and falling enrollment.

Also in 2022, HUC for the first time granted a certificate of ordination to a nonbinary candidate.

==Debbie Friedman School of Sacred Music==
The cantorial school of the Hebrew Union College – Jewish Institute of Religion was founded in 1947. The school is located on the New York campus of HUC-JIR at One West Fourth Street. It offers a five-year graduate program, conferring the degree of Master of Sacred Music in the fourth year and ordination as cantor in the fifth year.

Cantorial School at HUC-JIR begins in Jerusalem and continues for the next four years in New York. While in Israel, students study Hebrew, and Jewish music, and get to know Israel. Cantorial students study alongside Rabbinical and Education students. In New York, the program includes professional learning opportunities as a student-cantor, in which students serve congregations within and outside of the NY area.

The curriculum includes liturgical music classes covering traditional Shabbat, High Holiday and Festival nusach, Chorus, Musicology, Reform Liturgy and Composition; Judaica and text classes such as Bible, Midrash and History; and professional development. Each student is assigned practica (mini-recitals) during the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year of school culminating with a Senior Recital (based on a thesis) during the 5th year.

Rabbi David Ellenson, then president of Hebrew Union College – Jewish Institute of Religion, announced on January 27, 2011, that the School of Sacred Music would be renamed the Debbie Friedman School of Sacred Music in honor of Debbie Friedman. The renaming officially occurred on December 7, 2011.

==Women&#x27;s equality==

HUC has both male and female students in all its programs, including rabbinic and cantorial studies. Julia Ettlinger (1863-1890) became its first female student in 1875. As of January 2022, it has 839 women rabbinical graduates. (See Women rabbis). The first female rabbi to be ordained by HUC was Sally Priesand, ordained in 1972, the only woman in a class with 35 men. The first female cantor to be invested by HUC was Barbara Ostfeld in 1975.

After four years of deliberation, HUC decided to give women a choice of wording on their ordination certificates beginning in 2016, including the option to have the same wording as men. Up until then, male candidates&#x27; certificates identified them by the Reform movement&#x27;s traditional &quot;morenu harav,&quot; or &quot;our teacher the rabbi,&quot; while female candidates&#x27; certificates only used the term &quot;rav u’morah,&quot; or &quot;rabbi and teacher.&quot; Sally Priesand herself was unaware that her certificate referred to her any differently than her male colleagues until it was brought to her attention years later. Rabbi Mary Zamore, executive director of the Reform movement&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Rabbinic Network, explained that the HUC was uncomfortable with giving women the same title as men. In 2012 she wrote to Rabbi David Ellenson, HUC&#x27;s then president, requesting that he address the discrepancy, which she said was &quot;smacking of gender inequality.&quot;

In 2021, following new reports about sexual abuse by former HUC president Sheldon Zimmerman and recently-deceased professor Michael Cook, three separate Reform organizations began internal investigations of sexual harassment and other forms of discrimination. HUC retained the law firm Morgan Lewis, who conducted 170 interviews addressing incidents beginning in the 1970s. The report described the culture at the school&#x27;s campuses as a &quot;good old boys&quot; mindset demonstrating favoritism towards cisgender men, particularly at the Cincinnati and Jerusalem campuses. It found that students and administration were reluctant to confront professors over repeated incidents of harassment and discrimination, as many of the perpetrators are or were revered scholars in their field, and complaints were often swept under the rug. Former professors Steven M. Cohen, Michael Cook, and Stephen Passamaneck, Director of Litiurgical Arts and Music Bonia Shur, and former presidents Alfred Gottschalk and Sheldon Zimmerman were reported to be the subject of repeated credible allegations of sexual harassment. The report recommended renaming or removing endowed chairs, scholarships, statues, and buildings that honor the wrongdoers. The school&#x27;s current president and board both stated that they would make teshuvah (repent), work to prevent such incidents, and revise policies for handling misconduct complaints.

==Resources==
The HUC library system contains one of the most extensive Jewish collections in the world. Each campus has its own library:
* Klau Library in Cincinnati, the main research library. This library is the second-largest collection of printed Jewish material in the world (the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem is the first). The library states it has 700,000 volumes, including 150 incunabula and over 2,000 manuscript codices.
* Klau Library in New York—130,000 volumes.
* S. Zalman and Ayala Abramov Library in Jerusalem—100,000 volumes.
* Frances-Henry Library in Los Angeles—100,000 volumes.

The three U.S. campuses share a catalog, but the Jerusalem collection is separately cataloged.

==Publications==
Hebrew Union College operates Hebrew Union College Press, a university press, through which it releases Jewish Studies-related publications. It also issues a yearbook of studies titled Hebrew Union College Annual, published since 1924.

==Museum==
The Dr. Bernard Heller Museum at Hebrew Union College – Jewish Institute of Religion in New York presents exhibitions highlighting Jewish history, culture, and contemporary creativity.

Since its founding in 1983 as the Joseph Gallery, the museum has grown physically to encompass of exhibition space, expanding to include the Petrie Great Hall, Klingenstein Gallery, Heller Gallery and Backman Gallery.

The Hebrew Union College – Jewish Institute of Religion in Los Angeles originally housed The Skirball Museum. The museum collection moved to the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles when the Center opened in 1996. The Skirball Cultural Center is independent of HUC, however, both organizations continue to collaborate on select programs and exhibitions.

The Hebrew Union College – Jewish Institute of Religion also manages the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles and Skirball Museum in Jerusalem.

==Jewish Language Project==
The Jewish Language Project (JLP), run by Professor Sarah Bunin Benor at HUC–JIR, is a research program dedicated to the preservation of Jewish diasporic languages. The project also seeks to raise awareness among Jewish communities about Jewish languages around the world, both those that are endangered and those that are emerging. The JLP was launched in 2020 and its activities include convening organizations and scholars to document endangered Jewish languages and created collaborative dictionaries for emerging Jewish languages. JLP&#x27;s initiatives include the creation of a comprehensive resource on Jewish languages in the form of a series on online dictionaries, with information on over 30 different languages, including their history, grammar, vocabulary, and cultural significance. Most prominent is the Jewish English Lexicon, an online dictionary of words derived from various Jewish languages that Jews use when they are speaking English. Other initiatives concern endangered Jewish languages and feature documentation to preserve terms and phrases.

<doc id="872144" wikidata="Q6189858" url="?curid=872144" title="Jewish Institute of Religion">
<text>The Jewish Institute of Religion was an educational establishment created by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise in 1922 in New York City. While generally incorporating Reform Judaism, it was separate from the previously established Hebrew Union College. It sought to train rabbis &quot;for the Jewish ministry, research, and community service.&quot; Students were to serve either Reform or traditional pulpits.

Wise&#x27;s early support for Zionism, and his dispute with Reform hierarchy over the &quot;question whether the pulpit shall be free or whether the pulpit shall not be free, and, by reason of its loss of freedom, reft of its power for good&quot;, led to the establishment of his Free Synagogue in 1907. Wise remained president until 1948, and housed JIR next to his Free Synagogue on West 68th Street. He hoped that its graduates would generate other Free Synagogues &quot;animated by the same spirit of free inquiry, of warm Jewish feeling, and of devotion to the cause of social regeneration.&quot; JIR from the start inclined to Zionism, in contrast to HUC, which at the time did not favor Jewish nationalism.

In 1939 Helen Levinthal became the first American woman to complete the entire course of study in a rabbinical school, which she did at JIR. However, she only received a Master of Hebrew Letters (and a certificate recognizing her accomplishment) upon graduation, rather than a Master of Hebrew Letters and ordination as the men received, since the faculty felt it was not yet time for women&#x27;s ordination as rabbis.

Motivated largely by budgetary difficulties, Wise accepted the prospect of JIR&#x27;s merger with HUC once the biblical archaeologist Nelson Glueck assumed the presidency. Negotiations were completed in 1948 and in 1950 the two schools merged. In 1954 a school in Los Angeles was chartered and, in 1963, primarily as a result of Glueck&#x27;s efforts, a Jerusalem campus, initially devoted to archaeology, was opened.

<text>Bedford Modern School (often called BMS or simply Modern) is a Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference independent school in Bedford, England. The school has its origins in The Harpur Trust, born from the endowments left by Sir William Harpur in the sixteenth century. BMS comprises a junior school (ages 6–11) and a senior school (ages 11–18).

The school has had four names. In 1873 the school became Bedford Modern School to reflect its modern curriculum, providing an education for the professions. BMS provided education not only for the locality but also for colonial and military personnel abroad, seeking good education for their young families.

==History==
Bedford Modern School has its origins in The Harpur Trust, born from the endowments left by Sir William Harpur in the sixteenth century. Since the separation of Bedford School and BMS in 1764, the School has had four names: the Writing School, the English School, the Commercial School and finally Bedford Modern School, the last change being made in 1873 to reflect the School&#x27;s modern curriculum, providing an education for the professions.

BMS provided education not only for the locality but also for colonial and military personnel seeking good education for their young families. In 1834 BMS moved from its original premises in St Paul&#x27;s Square to buildings designed by Edward Blore in Harpur Square, Bedford.

The ‘Long Swim’ was established under Robert Poole (headmaster of BMS from 1877 to 1900), a ‘free-for-all’ swimming race in the River Great Ouse from Bedford town bridge to the ‘Suspension Bridge’. The gruelling event was stopped in 1957 due to river pollution. Up to 2010 an annual compulsory steeplechase was still taking place at the school for each year group.

During World War II, the inventors Cecil Vandepeer Clarke and Stuart Macrae took a prototype of their limpet mine to Bedford Modern School swimming baths, which were closed for such occasions. Clarke was an excellent swimmer and was able to propel himself through the water with a prototype bomb attached to a keeper plate on webbing around his waist.

Dame Alice Owen&#x27;s School was evacuated to BMS for the entire duration of World War II.

The school’s Prichard Museum, a collection of artefacts sent back to the school mainly from old boys around the world, became Bedford Museum. George Witt was a major benefactor to the school&#x27;s museum.

The successful growth of the school meant that the buildings became increasingly cramped and in 1974 the school moved to new premises in Bedford. The Foundation Stone for the new building was laid by Margaret Thatcher. On 11 May 1976, Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a commemorative panel at the new school building during her visit with Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

BMS became a coeducational day school in 2003. In 2014, BMS celebrated the 250th anniversary of its separation from Bedford School. David Scott Daniell wrote about his schooldays at BMS in his first novel, &quot;Young English&quot;.

==School houses==
Following a tradition of over a hundred years the Senior School Houses of BMS were: North, South, East, West, County and United Boarders. United Boarders comprised the combined boarding houses: Culver, Shakespeare, and School House. The day boy houses often, though not always, reflected the parts of the town or county from which the boys hailed and were mentioned in the chorus of the school song.

A decision was made in October 1997 for the house system to play a more central role in the school and to reinvigorate internal competition whilst upholding its traditions. Six heads of house were appointed from the staff under the direction of a senior head of house, with the brief to establish a modern house system to be integrated into a new school structure and working week, beginning in September 1998. A competition was launched to establish the new house names. The houses were named in honour of six Old Bedford Modernians who had gained national or international recognition in their field.

Each house has its own tie which consists of stripes of the three school colours and their own house colour. Inter-house sports cover all major and minor sports run by the school, at both junior and senior level, and range from rugby and hockey (major sports) to shooting and fencing (minor sports). There are also non-sporting events such as quizzes and Music and Drama competitions. Students take leadership roles as house captain or house deputies.

==Monitors==

Monitors are selected, following a written application process, from students in the upper sixth. Each team of monitors works with a specific year group, and are led by two senior monitors, appointed by the head master. Senior monitors, along with the heads of school, are entitled to wear a red trim on their blazer.

==Coeducation==
Until 2003, BMS was a day and boarding school for boys. Following 12 years of discussions, Bedford Modern School closed its boarding houses and became coeducational in September 2003. In 2013, BMS celebrated 10 years of coeducation, with a play written by Mark Burgess commissioned to celebrate the event.

==Extracurricular activities==

===Sport===

BMS competes against Bedford School, Berkhamsted School, Bishop&#x27;s Stortford College, Eton College, Hampton School, Harrow School, Kimbolton School, Haileybury, Merchant Taylors, Oakham School, Oundle School, St Albans School, Stowe School and Stamford School in rugby union or rowing.

The shooting range was closed and demolished to make space for the new science faculty in 2014.

Bedford Modern has had former students going on to compete at national and international levels including two former captains of the England national rugby union team and a former captain of the England cricket team.

The school was selected as an official training site for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.

===Performance arts===
Each year, the school puts on two productions, normally musicals, with full orchestra and set, in its 300-seat auditorium. It also hosts its own Shakespeare Festival, in which local schools are invited to take part. The sixth form has its own theatre company, Theatre in Transit, which puts on a piece of theatre each year at professional venues. In September 2014, the Chamber Choir performed The Armed Man at the Royal Albert Hall as part of Sing UK&#x27;s &#x27;A Mass for Peace&#x27;.

Combined Cadet Force

BMS Combined Cadet Force was established in 1900 and comprises three sections: the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force. The Royal Marines section was closed in 2018.

==Eagle magazine==

The school has several of its own publications, the most prominent of which is named &quot;The Eagle&quot;.

&quot;The Eagle&quot; has been published mostly biannually since 1881 and doubles as an archive of life at the school during that year. &quot;The Eagle&quot; is predominantly designed and edited by sixth form students, and since 2000 is printed as a glossy magazine with around 48 pages. It often also includes feature articles and interviews with former students.

In addition to &quot;The Eagle&quot;, other publications include &quot;The Eaglet&quot;, which, until recently, was included as part of the main magazine, and includes articles from the Junior School. Another publication is the &quot;Eagle News&quot;, which is published for the benefit of OBMs. It includes School news, and follow-up articles of former pupils. In 1906, the mathematician Eric Temple Bell reported news of an earthquake in San Francisco, where he was resident at the time.

The school is still known for this magazine in the Bedford area, where extra copies were often distributed. However, distribution externally is now limited.

<text>The 6th Army () was a field army of the German Army during World War II. It is widely known for its defeat by and subsequent surrender to the Red Army at the Battle of Stalingrad on 2 February 1943. It committed war crimes at Babi Yar while under the command of Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau during Operation Barbarossa.

The 6th Army was reformed in March 1943, and participated in fighting in Ukraine and later Romania, before being almost completely destroyed in the Second Jassy-Kishinev Offensive in August 1944. Following this it would fight in Hungary, attempting to relieve Budapest, and subsequently retreating into Austria in the Spring of 1945. 6th Army surrendered to US Army forces on 9 May 1945.

==Western campaigns==
The 6th Army was formed on 10 October 1939 with General Walther von Reichenau in command through the redesignation of the 10th Army that had fought during the Invasion of Poland.

During the invasion of the Low Countries the 6th Army saw active service linking up with paratroopers and destroying fortifications at Eben Emael, Liège, and Namur during the Battle of Belgium. The 6th Army was then involved in the breakthrough of the Paris defences on 12 June 1940, before acting as a northern flank for German forces along the Normandy coast during the closing stages of the Battle of France.

==Eastern Front, 1941–43==
The 6th Army took part in Operation Barbarossa as the spearhead of Army Group South. Reichenau died in an aircraft accident while being transported to a hospital after a heart attack in January 1942. He was succeeded by his former chief of staff, General Friedrich Paulus. Paulus led the 6th Army to a major victory at the Second Battle of Kharkov during the spring of 1942.

===Case Blue===
On 28 June 1942, Army Group South launched Case Blue, the German Army&#x27;s summer offensive into southern Russia. The goals of the operation were to secure both the oil fields at Baku, Azerbaijan, and the city of Stalingrad on the river Volga to protect the forces advancing into the Caucasus.

=== Battle of Stalingrad ===

Two months after the beginning of Case Blue, the 6th Army reached the outskirts of Stalingrad on 23 August. On the same day, over 1,000 aircraft of the Luftflotte 4 bombed the city, killing many civilians.

Stalingrad was defended by the 62nd Army (Soviet Union) under the command of General Vasily Chuikov. Despite German air superiority over Stalingrad, and with more artillery pieces than the Red Army, progress was reduced to no more than several meters a day. Eventually, by mid November, the 62nd Army had been pushed to the banks of the Volga, but the 6th Army was unable to eliminate the remaining Soviet troops.

On 19 November the Stavka launched Operation Uranus, a major offensive by Soviet forces on the flanks of the German army. The first pincer attacked far to the west of the Don, with the second thrust beginning a day later attacking far to the south of Stalingrad. The 6th Army&#x27;s flanks were protected by Romanian troops, who were quickly routed, and on 23 November, the pincers met at Kalach-na-Donu, thereby encircling the 6th Army. A relief attempt was launched on 12 December by Hermann Hoth&#x27;s 4th Panzer Army, codenamed Operation Winter Storm. Despite initial progress, capturing the town of Verkhne-Kumsky and reaching the river Myshkova, the 4th Panzer Army was eventually halted and later forced to withdraw due to the threat posed to its rear by Operation Little Saturn. Also contributing to Winter Storm&#x27;s failure was Adolf Hitler&#x27;s refusal to approve of Operation Thunderclap, a planned breakout attempt by the 6th Army, to occur simultaneously. 

The 6th Army surrendered between 31 January and 2 February 1943. German casualties were 147,200 killed and wounded and over 91,000 captured, the latter including Field Marshal Paulus, 24 generals and 2,500 officers of lesser rank. Only 5,000 would survive Soviet internment and return to Germany after the war.

==Redeployment==
A new 6th Army was deployed by renaming &quot;Armee-Abteilung Hollidt&quot; on 5 March 1943 under the command of General Karl-Adolf Hollidt.

This new 6th Army later fought in Ukraine and Romania as part of Army Group South until transferred to Army Group A (later renamed to Army Group South Ukraine). In May 1944, the 6th Army became part of Army Group Dumitrescu, commanded by the Romanian general Petre Dumitrescu. The Army Group also included the Romanian 3rd Army. This instance marked the first time in the war when German commanders came under the actual (instead of nominal) command of their foreign allies. This came one month after Dumitrescu became the 5th non-German recipient of the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (4 April 1944). The 6th army was encircled and almost entirely destroyed during the Second Jassy–Kishinev Offensive carried out by the Soviets.

In October 1944, under the command of General Maximilian Fretter-Pico, the 6th Army encircled and destroyed three Soviet corps of Mobile Group Pliyev under the command of Issa Pliyev in the Battle of Debrecen. During this time, the 6th Army had the Hungarian Second Army placed under its command, and it was known as &quot;Army Group Fretter-Pico&quot; (&quot;Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico&quot;).

Command passed to General Hermann Balck on 23 December 1944. In December 1944, one of the 6th Army&#x27;s subordinate units, the IX SS Mountain Corps, was encircled in Budapest. IV SS Panzer Corps was transferred to the 6th Army&#x27;s command and a series of relief attempts, codenamed Operation Konrad, was launched during the 46-day-long Siege of Budapest.

After the failure of Konrad III, the 6th Army was made part of &quot;Army Group Balck&quot; (&quot;Armeegruppe Balck&quot;). This army group fell back to the area near Lake Balaton. Several units, including the III Panzer Corps, took part in Operation Spring Awakening, while the rest of the Sixth Army provided defence for the left flank of the offensive, in the region west of Székesfehérvár. After the failure of the offensive, the army held the line until the Soviet Vienna Offensive on 16 March 1945. This offensive tore a gap in the 6th Army between the IV SS Panzer Corps and the 3rd Hungarian Army (subordinated to Balck&#x27;s command), shattering the formation. By the end of March 1945, the 6th Army was retreating towards Vienna. It surrendered to the U.S. Army on 9 May 1945.

==War crimes==
===Bila Tserkva massacre===
Soon after the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the Sixth Army&#x27;s surgeon, the staff doctor Gerhart Panning, learned about captured Russian expanding bullets by using Jewish POWs. To determine the effects of this type of ammunition on German soldiers, he decided to test them on other human beings after asking SD member and &quot;SS-Standartenführer&quot; Paul Blobel for some &quot;guinea pigs&quot; (Jewish POWs).

In July 1941 while conducting operations in Right-bank Ukraine, the Sixth Army bloodlessly captured the Ukrainian town of Bila Tserkva. Immediately after the town&#x27;s capitulation, Sixth Army police units separated the Jewish population of the town into a ghetto and required that they wear the Star of David as identification. Two weeks after the occupation, members of &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; marched the Jews out of the town, 800 men and women in all, to be shot. The Sixth Army provided logistical support for this massacre, providing drivers, guards, weapons and ammunition. Afterwards ninety children aged twelve and under were left, their parents having been killed the night before. A staff officer with the division that made the town their headquarters wrote of their conditions:

Groscurth himself sought out the district commander and insisted that the execution must be stopped. Sixth Army headquarters was faced with a decision on what to do with the children left behind now that their parents had been murdered. The division commander passed the decision up to Walter von Reichenau, then commander of the Sixth Army, who personally authorized the massacre. All the children were murdered by Sixth Army regulars. Groscurth, appalled by the murders, wrote to his wife that &quot;We cannot and should not be allowed to win this war&quot;.

===Severity Order===
The army&#x27;s commander, Walther von Reichenau, a committed, fanatical Nazi, had this to say about the expected conduct of soldiers under his command. The order said, in part

— Conduct of Troops in Eastern Territories

Immediately after this order was issued, Sixth Army records show a dramatic increase in shootings, rapes and massacres committed by Sixth Army constituent units. The BBC upon examining the now released records of the Sixth Army, stated that there were &quot;so many executions, and so many victims that it was impossible to keep them a secret.&quot;
The Sixth Army confiscated large quantities of food to be used by its troops, creating acute food shortages in Ukraine. By January 1942, around one-third of the Kharkov&#x27;s 300,000 remaining inhabitants suffered from starvation. Many would die in the cold winter months. Civilians survived the famine by making stews out of boiled leather and sawdust, and making omelets out of coagulated blood. Survivors bitterly remembered these &quot;meals&quot; for the rest of their lives.

<doc id="872159" wikidata="Q2366545" url="?curid=872159" title="Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo">
<text>Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo () is a hereditary title in the Peerage of Spain, accompanied by the dignity of Grandee. It was conferred by King Ferdinand VII on the British General Arthur Wellesley, then 1st Viscount Wellington, later 1st Duke of Wellington, in 1812, after his important victory at the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo that same year, as a victory title. As all dukedoms but one in the peerage of Spain, it has Grandeeship attached.

==History==

Historically, this Spanish dukedom is held by the successors of the 1st Duke of Wellington holding the title of Duke of Wellington, although this has not always been the case because of different succession laws. Traditionally, when titles were created, the first holder could determine how their title would pass: in the United Kingdom, almost all ducal titles were created with agnatic primogeniture, while Spanish titles usually passed either by male primogeniture or by agnatic primogeniture. This changed with the 2006 reform to Spanish nobility succession, which enforced succession by absolute primogeniture to all titles.

In 1943, Anne Rhys (&quot;née&quot; Wellesley), the only daughter and eldest child of Arthur Wellesley, 5th Duke of Wellington, inherited the Spanish dukedom but not the British titles of her family, which passed to her uncle Gerald Wellesley, 7th Duke of Wellington after her younger brother was killed in action during the Second World War. In 1949 Anne renounced the title in favour of her uncle.

In 2010, The 8th Duke of Wellington &amp; 9th Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo ceded the Spanish dukedom to his eldest child, Charles Wellesley, Marquess of Douro, who, in accordance with Spanish procedure, made formal claim to the title with the Spanish authorities on 10 March 2010. King Juan Carlos of Spain, through his minister, granted the succession of the dukedom to the Marquess of Douro by Royal Decree of 21 May 2010. The new Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo succeeded his father as Duke of Wellington in 2014.
==Dukes of Ciudad Rodrigo since 1812==
* Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo (1769–1852) from 1812
* Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo (1807–1884) from 1852
* Henry Wellesley, 3rd Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo (1846–1900) from 1884
* Arthur Wellesley, 4th Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo (1849–1934) from 1900
* Arthur (Charlie) Wellesley, 5th Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo (1876–1941) from 1934
* Henry (Morney) Wellesley, 6th Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo (1912–1943) from 1941. Upon his death in 1943, the title went to his sister Anne.
* Anne Rhys, 7th Duchess of Ciudad Rodrigo (1910–1998) from 1943, ceded the title to her uncle in 1949
* Gerald (Gerry) Wellesley, 8th Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo (1885–1972) from 1949, ceded the title to his son 1968
* Arthur Valerian Wellesley, 9th Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo (1915–2014) from 1972, ceded the title to his son 2010
* Arthur Charles Wellesley, 10th Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo (b. 1945) since 2010

== Order of succession ==
 the heir apparent to the Dukedom of Ciudad Rodrigo is the 10th Duke&#x27;s eldest child, Arthur Wellesley, Earl of Mornington. Lord Mornington has fraternal twins, a first-born daughter, Lady Mae Madeleine Wellesley, and a second-born son, Arthur Darcy Wellesley, Viscount Wellesley. Lady Mae Madeleine is Lord Mornington&#x27;s heir apparent to the Spanish dukedom as the eldest child, while Viscount Wellesley is the heir to the British dukedom as the eldest male, which could lead to another separation of these titles.

<doc id="872164" wikidata="Q2008647" url="?curid=872164" title="Oatman, Arizona">
<text>Oatman is a census-designated place (CDP) in the Black Mountains of Mohave County, Arizona, United States, at an elevation of . In 1915, it began as a small mining camp when two prospectors struck (equivalent to $ in ) in gold, though the vicinity had already been settled for several years. Oatman&#x27;s population grew to more than 3,500 in one year. As of the 2020 United States census, its population was 102.

The town is now a Wild West tourist attraction, known for the wild burros that wander the streets.

==History==

The name Oatman was chosen in honor of Olive Oatman, a young Illinois girl who was captured and enslaved by Indians, probably from the Tolkepayas tribe, during her pioneer family&#x27;s massacre while on their journey westward in 1851. She was later sold or traded to the Mohave people, who adopted her and tattooed her face in the custom of the tribe. She was released in 1856 at Fort Yuma.

In 1863, prospector John Thomas Moss discovered gold in the Black Mountains and staked several claims, one named the Moss after himself and another after Olive Oatman, whose story was well known. For the next half-century, mining waxed and waned in the remote district until new technology, reduced transportation costs, and new gold discoveries brought prosperity to Oatman in the early 20th century. The opening of the Tom Reed mine, followed by the discovery of a rich ore body in the nearby United Eastern Mining Company&#x27;s property in 1915, brought one of the desert&#x27;s last gold rushes. The boom of 1915–1917 gave Oatman all the characters and characteristics of any gold rush boomtown. For about one decade, the mines of Oatman were among the largest gold producers in the American West.
In 1921, a fire burned down many of Oatman&#x27;s smaller buildings, but spared the Oatman Hotel built in 1902. It remains the oldest two-story adobe structure in Mohave County and is a Mohave County historical landmark. One of the hotel&#x27;s major attractions is a room designated as the suite where Clark Gable and Carole Lombard supposedly spent their honeymoon after their 1939 wedding in Kingman, Arizona. In actuality, Gable and Lombard returned directly to Los Angeles after their wedding for a press conference the next morning and did not take a honeymoon until much later in Baja California.

In 1924, the town&#x27;s main employer, United Eastern Mines, permanently shut down its operations after producing (equivalent to $ in ) worth of gold at the government-controlled market value of $20 per ounce. The district had produced (equivalent to $ in ) in gold by 1941, when the remainder of the town&#x27;s gold mining operations were ordered shut down by the government as part of the country&#x27;s war effort, because other metals were needed. Oatman was fortunate it was located on busy U.S. Route 66 and catered to travelers driving between Kingman, Arizona, and Needles, California. Yet even that advantage was short-lived, because the town was completely bypassed in 1953 when a new route was built between Kingman and Needles. By the 1960s, Oatman was all but abandoned.

The town survives as a nostalgic Route 66 stop with a Wild West feel down to the wooden sidewalks, staged shootouts, and wild burros wandering the streets. The federal government rounds up areawide wild burros using helicopters and said, &quot;Oatman is a very particular case because that town&#x27;s basically all about burros.&quot;

<text>The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Manitoba) (CCF), known informally as the Manitoba CCF, was a provincial branch of the national Canadian party by the same name. The national CCF was the dominant social-democratic party in Canada from the 1930s to the early 1960s, when it merged with the labour movement to become the New Democratic Party. The Manitoba CCF, created in 1932, played the same role at the provincial level.

It was initially a small organization, and was supported by members of the Independent Labour Party, which had existed in the province since 1920. The ILP and CCF were brought into a formal alliance in 1933, despite misgivings from some in the former party.

The ILP was the leading social-democratic party in Manitoba prior to the CCF&#x27;s formation. It had a reliable support base in Winnipeg and other urban areas, but had virtually no organization in the countryside. The CCF was formed to bring labour and farm groups into the same political camp. Some ILP members saw this as diluting their party&#x27;s integrity.

The provincial CCF had become stronger by 1936, and the ILP&#x27;s candidates in that year&#x27;s provincial election were referred to as &quot;ILP-CCF&quot;. After the election, some disgruntled ILP members succeeded in temporarily disaffiliating the parties. Pressure from David Lewis and J. S. Woodsworth brought about a quick realignment, but relations remained strained.

At the start of World War II, the ILP and CCF were again in disagreement: the ILP supported an all-out war effort, whereas the CCF supported the conscription of &quot;wealth rather than men&quot;.

This controversy contributed to the defeat of federal CCF MP Abraham Albert Heaps in the election of 1940.

The CCF eventually gained control of the ILP&#x27;s internal organization, and the two parties were effectively one after 1941. The ILP formally disbanded in 1943.

In late 1940, the ILP-CCF accepted an offer by Manitoba Premier John Bracken to become part of an all-party &quot;unity government&quot;. This decision was opposed by some national leaders (including David Lewis), but was supported by local figures such as Seymour Farmer, who had led the ILP parliamentary group since 1935. On November 4, 1940, Farmer became the first socialist politician in Canadian history to attain cabinet rank, having been sworn in as Minister of Labour.

The CCF&#x27;s experience in the coalition government was a disappointment to the party. The party leaders had hoped to use their influence to promote progressive labour legislation; instead, Bracken&#x27;s government forced Farmer to seek &quot;free votes&quot; on his ministry&#x27;s initiatives (these soon became party votes, with the CCF invariably losing). Farmer resigned from government in December 1942, and the CCF formally left the coalition in 1943. The CCF&#x27;s time in government demoralized its membership, and hindered its electoral fortunes - voters elected only three CCF MLAs in 1941.

For the next few years, the CCF&#x27;s primary concern was preventing infiltration from Communists (then officially represented by the Labour Progressive Party). Some figures in the LPP favoured cooperation with the CCF; the CCF leadership was fully opposed to this, and suspended two prominent Manitoba MLAs when they advocated formal cooperation. Accusations of being &quot;Communist sympathizers&quot; would hinder the party&#x27;s fortunes for years to come.

In 1944, the national party was performing well in the polls and a CCF government was elected in neighbouring Saskatchewan. The Manitoba CCF hoped to repeat this success the following year, but won only 10 seats out of 55. This failure was due in part to the province&#x27;s outdated electoral boundaries, which favoured rural ridings at the expense of the cities.

Farmer resigned as party leader in 1947, and was replaced the following year by Edwin Hansford. The party won only seven seats in the election of 1949, amid a period of generally poor fortunes for left-wing parties in Canada. Hansford resigned as leader in 1952, replaced by Scottie Bryce.

The selection of Bryce was somewhat unusual, in that he was a federal MP without experience in the provincial house. He was apparently chosen as party leader due to fears that his federal seat would be eliminated by redistribution. Bryce ultimately decided against joining provincial politics, and was replaced by Lloyd Stinson before the 1953 election.

Stinson was probably the most adept of the Manitoba CCF&#x27;s leaders, but he was unable to translate his personal popularity and charisma into victory at the polls. The party fell to five seats in 1953, during the first election to be held after the province&#x27;s Liberal-Conservative coalition dissolved amid acrimony.

The Liberal government of Douglas Campbell became increasingly unpopular in the mid-1950s, and the CCF was able to tap into some of the public&#x27;s discontent. Stinson was relatively popular among the province&#x27;s &quot;centre-left&quot; voters, and the CCF increased its seat total to eleven in 1958.

The primary benefactors of Campbell&#x27;s unpopularity, however, were the Progressive Conservatives under Dufferin Roblin, who won 26 seats out of 57. The Campbell government initially attempted to stay in power through an alliance with the CCF, which turned down this offer (perhaps due to the disappointment of 1940–43). Roblin was sworn in as Premier later in the year.

Roblin&#x27;s government put the CCF in a paradoxical situation. Roblin had staked out a position well to Campbell&#x27;s left in opposition. As the new Premier, he initiated long-overdue progressive legislation and outflanked the CCF in a bid for centre-left voters. The CCF was forced to lend support to Roblin&#x27;s initiatives, thereby providing his ministry with the legislative record it needed to win a majority the following year. The Tories won 38 seats the following year, with the CCF dropping to 10. Stinson resigned as party leader in 1960, and was replaced by Russ Paulley.

The national CCF had fallen to eight seats in 1958, losing much of its support to John Diefenbaker&#x27;s Tories. When the national party &quot;reinvented&quot; itself in 1961 as the New Democratic Party (via an alliance with the Canadian Labour Congress), the provincial CCF followed suit.

The &quot;New Party&quot; in Manitoba affiliated with the Manitoba Federation of Labour, and Paulley became the first provincial NDP leader later in 1961.

The CCF ceased to exist, having been superseded by the New Democratic Party of Manitoba in much the same way as it had previously superseded the ILP.

<doc id="872175" wikidata="Q2665859" url="?curid=872175" title="Cryptanalysis of the Enigma">
<text>Cryptanalysis of the Enigma ciphering system enabled the western Allies in World War II to read substantial amounts of Morse-coded radio communications of the Axis powers that had been enciphered using Enigma machines. This yielded military intelligence which, along with that from other decrypted Axis radio and teleprinter transmissions, was given the codename &quot;Ultra&quot;.

The Enigma machines were a family of portable cipher machines with rotor scramblers. Good operating procedures, properly enforced, would have made the plugboard Enigma machine unbreakable to the Allies at that time.

The German plugboard-equipped Enigma became the principal crypto-system of the German Reich and later of other Axis powers. In December 1932 it was broken by mathematician Marian Rejewski at the Polish General Staff&#x27;s Cipher Bureau, using mathematical permutation group theory combined with French-supplied intelligence material obtained from a German spy. By 1938 Rejewski had invented a device, the cryptologic bomb, and Henryk Zygalski had devised his sheets, to make the cipher-breaking more efficient. Five weeks before the outbreak of World War II, in late July 1939 at a conference just south of Warsaw, the Polish Cipher Bureau shared its Enigma-breaking techniques and technology with the French and British.

During the German invasion of Poland, core Polish Cipher Bureau personnel were evacuated via Romania to France, where they established the &quot;PC Bruno&quot; signals intelligence station with French facilities support. Successful cooperation among the Poles, French, and British continued until June 1940, when France surrendered to the Germans.

From this beginning, the British Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park built up an extensive cryptanalytic capability. Initially the decryption was mainly of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (German air force) and a few &quot;Heer&quot; (German army) messages, as the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; (German navy) employed much more secure procedures for using Enigma. Alan Turing, a Cambridge University mathematician and logician, provided much of the original thinking that led to upgrading of the Polish cryptologic bomb used in decrypting German Enigma ciphers. However, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; introduced an Enigma version with a fourth rotor for its U-boats, resulting in a prolonged period when these messages could not be decrypted. With the capture of cipher keys and the use of much faster US Navy bombes, regular, rapid reading of U-boat messages resumed.

==General principles==

The Enigma machines combined multiple levels of movable rotors and plug cables to produce a particularly complex polyalphabetic substitution cipher. 

During World War I, inventors in several countries realised that a purely random key sequence, containing no repetitive pattern, would, in principle, make a polyalphabetic substitution cipher unbreakable. This led to the development of rotor machines which alter each character in the plaintext to produce the ciphertext, by means of a scrambler comprising a set of &quot;rotors&quot; that alter the electrical path from character to character, between the input device and the output device. This constant altering of the electrical pathway produces a very long period before the pattern—the key sequence or substitution alphabet—repeats.

Decrypting enciphered messages involves three stages, defined somewhat differently in that era than in modern cryptography. First, there is the &quot;identification&quot; of the system in use, in this case Enigma; second, &quot;breaking&quot; the system by establishing exactly how encryption takes place, and third, &quot;solving&quot;, which involves finding the way that the machine was set up for an individual message, &quot;i.e.&quot; the &quot;message key&quot;. Today, it is often assumed that an attacker knows how the encipherment process works (see Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle) and &quot;breaking&quot; is often used for &quot;solving&quot; a key. Enigma machines, however, had so many potential internal wiring states that reconstructing the machine, independent of particular settings, was a very difficult task.

==The Enigma machine==

The Enigma rotor machine was potentially an excellent system. It generated a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, with a period before repetition of the substitution alphabet that was much longer than any message, or set of messages, sent with the same key.

A major weakness of the system, however, was that no letter could be enciphered to itself. This meant that some possible solutions could quickly be eliminated because of the same letter appearing in the same place in both the ciphertext and the putative piece of plaintext. Comparing the possible plaintext &quot;Keine besonderen Ereignisse&quot; (literally, &quot;no special occurrences&quot;—perhaps better translated as &quot;nothing to report&quot;; a phrase regularly used by one German outpost in North Africa), with a section of ciphertext, might produce the following:
===Structure===
The mechanism of the Enigma consisted of a keyboard connected to a battery and a current entry plate or wheel (German: &quot;Eintrittswalze&quot;), at the right hand end of the scrambler (usually via a plugboard in the military versions). This contained a set of 26 contacts that made electrical connection with the set of 26 spring-loaded pins on the right hand rotor. The internal wiring of the core of each rotor provided an electrical pathway from the pins on one side to different connection points on the other. The left hand side of each rotor made electrical connection with the rotor to its left. The leftmost rotor then made contact with the reflector (German: &quot;Umkehrwalze&quot;). The reflector provided a set of thirteen paired connections to return the current back through the scrambler rotors, and eventually to the lampboard where a lamp under a letter was illuminated.

Whenever a key on the keyboard was pressed, the stepping motion was actuated, advancing the rightmost rotor one position. Because it moved with each key pressed it is sometimes called the &quot;fast rotor&quot;. When a notch on that rotor engaged with a pawl on the middle rotor, that too moved; and similarly with the leftmost (&#x27;slow&#x27;) rotor.

There are a huge number of ways that the connections within each scrambler rotor—and between the entry plate and the keyboard or plugboard or lampboard—could be arranged. For the reflector plate there are fewer, but still a large number of options to its possible wirings.

Each scrambler rotor could be set to any one of its 26 starting positions (any letter of the alphabet). For the Enigma machines with only three rotors, their sequence in the scrambler—which was known as the &quot;wheel order (WO)&quot; to Allied cryptanalysts—could be selected from the six that are possible.

Later Enigma models included an &quot;alphabet ring&quot; like a tyre around the core of each rotor. This could be set in any one of 26 positions in relation to the rotor&#x27;s core. The ring contained one or more notches that engaged with a pawl that advanced the next rotor to the left.

Later still, the three rotors for the scrambler were selected from a set of five or, in the case of the German Navy, eight rotors. The alphabet rings of rotors VI, VII, and VIII contained two notches which, despite shortening the period of the substitution alphabet, made decryption more difficult.

Most military Enigmas also featured a plugboard (German: &quot;Steckerbrett&quot;). This altered the electrical pathway between the keyboard and the entry wheel of the scrambler and, in the opposite direction, between the scrambler and the lampboard. It did this by exchanging letters reciprocally, so that if &quot;A&quot; was plugged to &quot;G&quot; then pressing key &quot;A&quot; would lead to current entering the scrambler at the &quot;G&quot; position, and if &quot;G&quot; was pressed the current would enter at &quot;A&quot;. The same connections applied for the current on the way out to the lamp panel.

To decipher German military Enigma messages, the following information would need to be known.

Logical structure of the machine (unchanging)
*The wiring between the keyboard (and lampboard) and the entry plate.
*The wiring of each rotor.
*The number and position(s) of turnover notches on the rings of the rotors.
*The wiring of the reflectors.
Internal settings (usually changed less frequently than external settings)
*The selection of rotors in use and their ordering on the spindle (&quot;Walzenlage&quot; or &quot;wheel order&quot;).
*The positions of the alphabet ring in relation to the core of each rotor in use (&quot;Ringstellung&quot; or &quot;ring settings&quot;).
External settings (usually changed more frequently than internal settings)
*The plugboard connections (&quot;Steckerverbindungen&quot; or &quot;stecker values&quot;).
*The rotor positions at the start of enciphering the text of the message.

Discovering the logical structure of the machine may be called &quot;breaking&quot; it, a one-off process except when changes or additions were made to the machines. Finding the internal and external settings for one or more messages may be called &quot;solving&quot; – although breaking is often used for this process as well.

===Security properties===
The various Enigma models provided different levels of security. The presence of a plugboard (&quot;Steckerbrett&quot;) substantially increased the security of the encipherment. Each pair of letters that were connected together by a plugboard lead were referred to as &quot;stecker partners&quot;, and the letters that remained unconnected were said to be &quot;self-steckered&quot;. In general, the unsteckered Enigma was used for commercial and diplomatic traffic and could be broken relatively easily using hand methods, while attacking versions with a plugboard was much more difficult. The British read unsteckered Enigma messages sent during the Spanish Civil War, and also some Italian naval traffic enciphered early in World War II.

The strength of the security of the ciphers that were produced by the Enigma machine was a product of the large numbers associated with the scrambling process.
#It produced a polyalphabetic substitution cipher with a period () that was many times the length of the longest message.
#The 3-rotor scrambler could be set in 26 × 26 × 26 = ways, and the 4-rotor scrambler in 26 × = ways.
#With &quot;L&quot; leads on the plugboard, the number of ways that pairs of letters could be interchanged was formula_1
#*With &quot;L&quot;=6, the number of combinations was (100 billion) and with ten leads, it was (151 trillion).

However, the way that Enigma was used by the Germans meant that, if the settings for one day (or whatever period was represented by each row of the setting sheet) were established, the rest of the messages for that network on that day could quickly be deciphered.

The security of Enigma ciphers did have fundamental weaknesses that proved helpful to cryptanalysts.
#A letter could never be encrypted to itself, a consequence of the reflector. This property was of great help in using &quot;cribs&quot;—short sections of plaintext thought to be somewhere in the ciphertext—and could be used to eliminate a crib in a particular position. For a possible location, if any letter in the crib matched a letter in the ciphertext at the same position, the location could be ruled out. It was this feature that the British mathematician and logician Alan Turing exploited in designing the British bombe.
#The plugboard connections were reciprocal, so that if A was plugged to N, then N likewise became A. It was this property that led mathematician Gordon Welchman at Bletchley Park to propose that a &quot;diagonal board&quot; be introduced into the bombe, substantially reducing the number of incorrect rotor settings that the bombes found.
#The notches in the &quot;alphabet rings&quot; of rotors I to V were in different positions, which helped cryptanalysts to work out the &quot;wheel order&quot; by observing when the middle rotor was turned over by the right-hand rotor.
#There were weaknesses, in both policies and practice, in the way some Enigma versions were used.
#Critical material was disclosed without notice.

===Key setting===
Enigma featured the major operational convenience of being symmetrical (or self-inverse). This meant that decipherment worked in the same way as encipherment, so that when the ciphertext was typed in, the sequence of lamps that lit yielded the plaintext.

Identical setting of the machines at the transmitting and receiving ends was achieved by key setting procedures. These varied from time to time and across different networks. They consisted of &quot;setting sheets&quot; in a &quot;codebook&quot;. which were distributed to all users of a network, and were changed regularly. The message key was transmitted in an &quot;indicator&quot; as part of the message preamble. The word &quot;key&quot; was also used at Bletchley Park to describe the network that used the same Enigma setting sheets. Initially these were recorded using coloured pencils and were given the names &quot;red&quot;, &quot;light blue&quot; etc., and later the names of birds such as &quot;kestrel&quot;. During World War II the settings for most networks lasted for 24 hours, although towards the end of the war, some were changed more frequently. The sheets had columns specifying, for each day of the month, the rotors to be used and their positions, the ring positions and the plugboard connections. For security, the dates were in reverse chronological order down the page, so that each row could be cut off and destroyed when it was finished with.

Until 15 September 1938, the transmitting operator indicated to the receiving operator(s) how to set their rotors, by choosing a three letter &quot;message key&quot; (the key specific to that message) and enciphering it twice using the specified initial ring positions (the &quot;Grundstellung&quot;). The resultant 6-letter indicator, was then transmitted before the enciphered text of the message. Suppose that the specified &quot;Grundstellung&quot; was &quot;RAO&quot;, and the chosen 3-letter message key was &quot;IHL&quot;, the operator would set the rotors to &quot;RAO&quot; and encipher &quot;IHL&quot; twice. The resultant ciphertext, &quot;DQYQQT&quot;, would be transmitted, at which point the rotors would be changed to the message key (&quot;IHL&quot;) and then the message itself enciphered. The receiving operator would use the specified &quot;Grundstellung RAO&quot; to decipher the first six letters, yielding &quot;IHLIHL&quot;. The receiving operator, seeing the repeated message key, would know that there had been no corruption and use &quot;IHL&quot; to decipher the message.

The weakness in this indicator procedure came from two factors. First, use of a global &quot;Grundstellung&quot; —this was changed in September 1938 so that the operator selected his initial position to encrypt the message key, and sent the initial position in clear followed by the enciphered message key. The second problem was the repetition of message key within the indicator, which was a serious security flaw. The message setting was encoded twice, resulting in a relation between first and fourth, second and fifth, and third and sixth character. This security problem enabled the Polish Cipher Bureau to break the pre-war Enigma system as early as 1932. On 1 May 1940 the Germans changed the procedures to encipher the message key only once.

==British efforts==
In 1927, the UK openly purchased a commercial Enigma. Its operation was analysed and reported. Although a leading British cryptographer, Dilly Knox (a veteran of World War I and the cryptanalytical activities of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40), worked on decipherment he had only the messages he generated himself to practice with. After Germany supplied modified commercial machines to the Nationalist side in the Spanish Civil War, and with the Italian Navy (who were also aiding the Nationalists) using a version of the commercial Enigma that did not have a plugboard, Britain could intercept the radio broadcast messages. In April 1937 Knox made his first decryption of an Enigma encryption using a technique that he called &quot;buttoning up&quot; to discover the rotor wirings and another that he called &quot;rodding&quot; to solve messages. This relied heavily on cribs and on a crossword-solver&#x27;s expertise in Italian, as it yielded a limited number of spaced-out letters at a time.

Britain had no ability to read the messages broadcast by Germany, which used the military Enigma machine.

==Polish breakthroughs==


In the 1920s the German military began using a 3-rotor Enigma, whose security was increased in 1930 by the addition of a plugboard. The Polish Cipher Bureau sought to break it because of the threat that Poland faced from Germany, but the early attempts did not succeed. Mathematicians having earlier rendered great services in breaking Russian ciphers and codes, in early 1929 the Polish Cipher Bureau invited mathematics students at Poznań University – who had a good knowledge of the German language due to the area having belonged to Germany before being awarded to Poland after World War I – to take a course in cryptology.

After the course, the Bureau recruited some students to work part-time at a Bureau branch set up in Poznań. On 1 September 1932, 27-year-old mathematician Marian Rejewski and two fellow Poznań University mathematics graduates, Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Różycki, were hired by the Bureau in Warsaw. Their first task was reconstructing a four-letter German naval code.

Near the end of 1932 Rejewski was asked to work a couple of hours a day at breaking the Enigma cipher. His work on it may have begun in late October or early November 1932.

===Rejewski&#x27;s characteristics method===
Marian Rejewski quickly spotted the Germans&#x27; major procedural weaknesses of specifying a single indicator setting (&quot;Grundstellung&quot;) for all messages on a network for a day, and repeating the operator&#x27;s chosen &quot;message key&quot; in the enciphered 6-letter indicator. Those procedural mistakes allowed Rejewski to decipher the message keys without knowing any of the machine&#x27;s wirings. In the above example of &quot;DQYQQT&quot; being the enciphered indicator, it is known that the first letter &quot;D&quot; and the fourth letter &quot;Q&quot; represent the same letter, enciphered three positions apart in the scrambler sequence. Similarly with &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; in the second and fifth positions, and &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;T&quot; in the third and sixth. Rejewski exploited this fact by collecting a sufficient set of messages enciphered with the same indicator setting, and assembling three tables for the 1,4, the 2,5, and the 3,6 pairings. Each of these tables might look something like the following:

A path from one first letter to the corresponding fourth letter, then from that letter as the first letter to its corresponding fourth letter, and so on until the first letter recurs, traces out a cycle group. The following table contains six cycle groups.
Rejewski recognised that a cycle group must pair with another group of the same length. Even though Rejewski did not know the rotor wirings or the plugboard permutation, the German mistake allowed him to reduce the number of possible substitution ciphers to a small number. For the 1,4 pairing above, there are only possibilities for the substitution ciphers at positions 1 and 4.

Rejewski also exploited cipher clerk laziness. Scores of messages would be enciphered by several cipher clerks, but some of those messages would have the same encrypted indicator. That meant that both clerks happened to choose the same three letter starting position. Such a collision should be rare with randomly selected starting positions, but lazy cipher clerks often chose starting positions such as &quot;AAA&quot;, &quot;BBB&quot;, or &quot;CCC&quot;. Those security mistakes allowed Rejewski to solve each of the six permutations used to encipher the indicator.

That solution was an extraordinary feat. Rejewski did it without knowing the plugboard permutation or the rotor wirings. Even after solving for the six permutations, Rejewski did not know how the plugboard was set or the positions of the rotors. Knowing the six permutations also did not allow Rejewski to read any messages.

===The spy and the rotor wiring===
Before Rejewski started work on the Enigma, the French had a spy, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, who worked at Germany&#x27;s Cipher Office in Berlin and had access to some Enigma documents. Even with the help of those documents, the French did not make progress on breaking the Enigma. The French decided to share the material with their British and Polish allies. In a December 1931 meeting, the French provided Gwido Langer, head of the Polish Cipher Bureau, with copies of some Enigma material. Langer asked the French for more material, and Gustave Bertrand of French Military Intelligence quickly obliged; Bertrand provided additional material in May and September 1932. The documents included two German manuals and two pages of Enigma daily keys.

In December 1932, the Bureau provided Rejewski with some German manuals and monthly keys. The material enabled Rejewski to achieve &quot;one of the most important breakthroughs in cryptologic history&quot; by using the theory of permutations and groups to work out the Enigma scrambler wiring.

Rejewski could look at a day&#x27;s cipher traffic and solve for the permutations at the six sequential positions used to encipher the indicator. Since Rejewski had the cipher key for the day, he knew and could factor out the plugboard permutation. He assumed the keyboard permutation was the same as the commercial Enigma, so he factored that out. He knew the rotor order, the ring settings, and the starting position. He developed a set of equations that would allow him to solve for the rightmost rotor wiring assuming the two rotors to the left did not move.

He attempted to solve the equations, but failed with inconsistent results. After some thought, he realised one of his assumptions must be wrong.

Rejewski found that the connections between the military Enigma&#x27;s keyboard and the entry ring were not, as in the commercial Enigma, in the order of the keys on a German typewriter. He made an inspired correct guess that it was in alphabetical order. Britain&#x27;s Dilly Knox was astonished when he learned, in July 1939, that the arrangement was so simple.

With the new assumption, Rejewski succeeded in solving the wiring of the rightmost rotor. The next month&#x27;s cipher traffic used a different rotor in the rightmost position, so Rejewski used the same equations to solve for its wiring. With those rotors known, the remaining third rotor and the reflector wiring were determined. Without capturing a single rotor to reverse engineer, Rejewski had determined the logical structure of the machine.

The Polish Cipher Bureau then had some Enigma machine replicas made; the replicas were called &quot;Enigma doubles&quot;.

===The grill method===
The Poles now had the machine&#x27;s wiring secrets, but they still needed to determine the daily keys for the cipher traffic. The Poles would examine the Enigma traffic and use the method of characteristics to determine the six permutations used for the indicator. The Poles would then use the grill method to determine the rightmost rotor and its position. That search would be complicated by the plugboard permutation, but that permutation only swapped six pairs of lettersnot enough to disrupt the search. The grill method also determined the plugboard wiring. The grill method could also be used to determine the middle and left rotors and their setting (and those tasks were simpler because there was no plugboard), but the Poles eventually compiled a catalogue of the possible permutations (reflector and 2 leftmost rotor permutations), so they could just look up the answer.

The only remaining secret of the daily key would be the ring settings, and the Poles would attack that problem with brute force. Most messages would start with the three letters &quot;ANX&quot; (&quot;an&quot; is German for &quot;to&quot; and the &quot;X&quot; character was used as a space). It may take almost trials, but that was doable. Once the ring settings were found, the Poles could read the day&#x27;s traffic.

The Germans made it easy for the Poles in the beginning. The rotor order only changed every quarter, so the Poles would not have to search for the rotor order. Later the Germans changed it every month, but that would not cause much trouble, either. Eventually, the Germans would change the rotor order every day, and late in the war (after Poland had been overrun) the rotor order might be changed during the day.

The Poles kept improving their techniques as the Germans kept improving their security measures.

===Invariant cycle lengths and the card catalogue===
Rejewski realised that, although the letters in the cycle groups were changed by the plugboard, the number and lengths of the cycles were unaffected—in the example above, six cycle groups with lengths of 9, 9, 3, 3, 1, and 1. He described this invariant structure as the &quot;characteristic&quot; of the indicator setting. There were only 105,456 possible rotor settings. The Poles therefore set about creating a &quot;card catalogue&quot; of these cycle patterns.

The cycle-length method would avoid using the grill. The card catalogue would index the cycle-length for all starting positions (except for turnovers that occurred while enciphering an indicator). The day&#x27;s traffic would be examined to discover the cycles in the permutations. The card catalogue would be consulted to find the possible starting positions. There are roughly 1 million possible cycle-length combinations and only 105,456 starting positions. Having found a starting position, the Poles would use an Enigma double to determine the cycles at that starting position without a plugboard. The Poles would then compare those cycles to the cycles with the (unknown) plugboard and solve for the plugboard permutation (a simple substitution cipher). Then the Poles could find the remaining secret of the ring settings with the ANX method.

The problem was compiling the large card catalogue.

Rejewski, in 1934 or 1935, devised a machine to facilitate making the catalogue and called it a &quot;cyclometer&quot;. This &quot;comprised two sets of rotors... connected by wires through which electric current could run. Rotor N in the second set was three letters out of phase with respect to rotor N in the first set, whereas rotors L and M in the second set were always set the same way as rotors L and M in the first set&quot;. Preparation of this catalogue, using the cyclometer, was, said Rejewski, &quot;laborious and took over a year, but when it was ready, obtaining daily keys was a question of [some fifteen] minutes&quot;.

However, on 1 November 1937, the Germans changed the Enigma reflector, necessitating the production of a new catalogue—&quot;a task which [says Rejewski] consumed, on account of our greater experience, probably somewhat less than a year&#x27;s time&quot;.

This characteristics method stopped working for German naval Enigma messages on 1 May 1937, when the indicator procedure was changed to one involving special codebooks (see German Navy 3-rotor Enigma below). Worse still, on 15 September 1938 it stopped working for German Army and Luftwaffe messages because operators were then required to choose their own &quot;Grundstellung&quot; (initial rotor setting) for each message. Although German army message keys would still be double-enciphered, the day&#x27;s keys would not be double-enciphered at the same initial setting, so the characteristic could no longer be found or exploited.

===Perforated sheets===
Although the characteristics method no longer worked, the inclusion of the enciphered message key twice gave rise to a phenomenon that the cryptanalyst Henryk Zygalski was able to exploit. Sometimes (about one message in eight) one of the repeated letters in the message key enciphered to the same letter on both occasions. These occurrences were called &quot;samiczki&quot; (in English, &quot;females&quot;—a term later used at Bletchley Park).

Only a limited number of scrambler settings would give rise to females, and these would have been identifiable from the card catalogue. If the first six letters of the ciphertext were SZVSIK&quot;, this would be termed a 1–4 female; if &quot;WHOEHS&quot;, a 2–5 female; and if &quot;ASWCRW, a 3–6 female. The method was called &quot;Netz&quot; (from &quot;Netzverfahren&quot;, &quot;net method&quot;), or the Zygalski sheet method as it used perforated sheets that he devised, although at Bletchley Park Zygalski&#x27;s name was not used for security reasons. About ten females from a day&#x27;s messages were required for success.

There was a set of 26 of these sheets for each of the six possible sequences &quot;wheel orders&quot;. Each sheet was for the left (slowest-moving) rotor. The 51×51 matrices on the sheets represented the 676 possible starting positions of the middle and right rotors. The sheets contained about 1000 holes in the positions in which a female could occur. The set of sheets for that day&#x27;s messages would be appropriately positioned on top of each other in the perforated sheets apparatus. Rejewski wrote about how the device was operated:

The holes in the sheets were painstakingly cut with razor blades and in the three months before the next major setback, the sets of sheets for only two of the possible six wheel orders had been produced.

===Polish &quot;bomba&quot;===

After Rejewski&#x27;s characteristics method became useless, he invented an electro-mechanical device that was dubbed the &quot;bomba kryptologiczna&quot;, &#x27;cryptologic bomb&#x27;. Each machine contained six sets of Enigma rotors for the six positions of the repeated three-letter key. Like the Zygalski sheet method, the &quot;bomba&quot; relied on the occurrence of &quot;females&quot;, but required only three instead of about ten for the sheet method. Six &quot;bomby&quot; were constructed, one for each of the then possible &quot;wheel orders&quot;. Each &quot;bomba&quot; conducted an exhaustive (brute-force) analysis of the 17,576 possible message keys.

Rejewski has written about the device: 

The cipher message transmitted the &quot;Grundstellung&quot; in the clear, so when a &quot;bomba&quot; found a match, it revealed the rotor order, the rotor positions, and the ring settings. The only remaining secret was the plugboard permutation.

===Major setback===
On 15 December 1938, the German Army increased the complexity of Enigma enciphering by introducing two additional rotors (IV and V). This increased the number of possible &quot;wheel orders&quot; from 6 to 60. The Poles could then read only the small minority of messages that used neither of the two new rotors. They did not have the resources to commission 54 more bombs or produce 58 sets of Zygalski sheets. Other Enigma users received the two new rotors at the same time. However, until 1 July 1939 the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD)—the intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party—continued to use its machines in the old way with the same indicator setting for all messages. This allowed Rejewski to reuse his previous method, and by about the turn of the year he had worked out the wirings of the two new rotors. On 1 January 1939, the Germans increased the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight to between seven and ten, which made other methods of decryption even more difficult.

Rejewski wrote, in a 1979 critique of appendix 1, volume 1 (1979), of the official history of British Intelligence in the Second World War: 

==World War II==
===Polish disclosures===
As the likelihood of war increased in 1939, Britain and France pledged support for Poland in the event of action that threatened its independence. In April, Germany withdrew from the German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934. The Polish General Staff, realising what was likely to happen, decided to share their work on Enigma decryption with their western allies. Marian Rejewski later wrote:

At a conference near Warsaw on 26 and 27 July 1939, the Poles revealed to the French and British that they had broken Enigma and pledged to give each a Polish-reconstructed Enigma, along with details of their Enigma-solving techniques and equipment, including Zygalski&#x27;s perforated sheets and Rejewski&#x27;s cryptologic bomb. In return, the British pledged to prepare two full sets of Zygalski sheets for all 60 possible wheel orders. Dilly Knox was a member of the British delegation. He commented on the fragility of the Polish system&#x27;s reliance on the repetition in the indicator, because it might &quot;at any moment be cancelled&quot;. In August, two Polish Enigma doubles were sent to Paris, whence Gustave Bertrand took one to London, handing it to Stewart Menzies of Britain&#x27;s Secret Intelligence Service at Victoria Station.

Gordon Welchman, who became head of Hut 6 at Bletchley Park, wrote:

Peter Calvocoressi, who became head of the Luftwaffe section in Hut 3, wrote of the Polish contribution:

===&quot;PC Bruno&quot;===

On 5 September 1939 the Cipher Bureau began preparations to evacuate key personnel and equipment from Warsaw. Soon a special evacuation train, the Echelon F, transported them eastward, then south. By the time the Cipher Bureau was ordered to cross the border into allied Romania on 17 September, they had destroyed all sensitive documents and equipment and were down to a single very crowded truck. The vehicle was confiscated at the border by a Romanian officer, who separated the military from the civilian personnel. Taking advantage of the confusion, the three mathematicians ignored the Romanian&#x27;s instructions. They anticipated that in an internment camp they might be identified by the Romanian security police, in which the German Abwehr and SD had informers.

The mathematicians went to the nearest railroad station, exchanged money, bought tickets, and boarded the first train headed south. After a dozen or so hours, they reached Bucharest, at the other end of Romania. There they went to the British embassy. Told by the British to &quot;come back in a few days&quot;, they next tried the French embassy, introducing themselves as &quot;friends of Bolek&quot; (Bertrand&#x27;s Polish code name) and asking to speak with a French military officer. A French Army colonel telephoned Paris and then issued instructions for the three Poles to be assisted in evacuating to Paris.

On 20 October 1939, at &quot;PC Bruno&quot; outside Paris, the Polish cryptologists resumed work on German Enigma ciphers, in collaboration with Bletchley Park.

&quot;PC Bruno&quot; and Bletchley Park worked together closely, communicating via a telegraph line secured by the use of Enigma doubles. In January 1940 Alan Turing spent several days at &quot;PC Bruno&quot; conferring with his Polish colleagues. He had brought the Poles a full set of Zygalski sheets that had been punched at Bletchley Park by John Jeffreys using Polish-supplied information, and on 17 January 1940, the Poles made the first break into wartime Enigma traffic—that from 28 October 1939. From that time, until the Fall of France in June 1940, 17 per cent of the Enigma keys that were found by the allies were solved at &quot;PC Bruno&quot;.

Just before opening their 10 May 1940 offensive against the Low Countries and France, the Germans made the feared change in the indicator procedure, discontinuing the duplication of the enciphered message key. This meant that the Zygalski sheet method no longer worked. Instead, the cryptanalysts had to rely on exploiting the operator weaknesses described below, particularly the cillies and the Herivel tip.

After the June Franco-German armistice, the Polish cryptological team resumed work in France&#x27;s southern &quot;Free Zone&quot;, although probably not on Enigma. Marian Rejewski and Henryk Zygalski, after many travails, perilous journeys, and Spanish imprisonment, finally made it to Britain, where they were inducted into the Polish Army and put to work breaking German &quot;SS&quot; and &quot;SD&quot; hand ciphers at a Polish signals facility in Boxmoor. Due to their having been in occupied France, it was thought too risky to invite them to work at Bletchley Park.

After the German occupation of Vichy France, several of those who had worked at &quot;PC Bruno&quot; were captured by the Germans. Despite the dire circumstances in which some of them were held, none betrayed the secret of Enigma&#x27;s decryption.

===Operating shortcomings===
Apart from some less-than-ideal inherent characteristics of the Enigma, in practice the system&#x27;s greatest weakness was the large numbers of messages and some ways that Enigma was used. The basic principle of this sort of enciphering machine is that it should deliver a stream of transformations that are difficult for a cryptanalyst to predict. Some of the instructions to operators, and operator sloppiness, had the opposite effect. Without these operating shortcomings, Enigma would almost certainly not have been broken.

The shortcomings that Allied cryptanalysts exploited included:

* The production of an early Enigma training manual containing an example of plaintext and its genuine ciphertext, together with the relevant message key. When Rejewski was given this in December 1932, it &quot;made [his reconstruction of the Enigma machine] somewhat easier&quot;.
* Repetition of the message key as described in Rejewski&#x27;s characteristics method, above. (This helped in Rejewski&#x27;s solving Enigma&#x27;s wiring in 1932, and was continued until May 1940.)
* Repeatedly using the same stereotypical expressions in messages, an early example of what Bletchley Park would later term cribs. Rejewski wrote that &quot;... we relied on the fact that the greater number of messages began with the letters &quot;ANX&quot;—German for &quot;to&quot;, followed by &quot;X&quot; as a spacer&quot;.
* The use of easily guessed keys such as &quot;AAA&quot; or &quot;BBB&quot;, or sequences that reflected the layout of the Enigma keyboard, such as &quot;three [typing] keys that stand next to each other [o]r diagonally [from each other]...&quot; At Bletchley Park such occurrences were called &quot;cillies&quot;. Cillies in the operation of the four-rotor &quot;Abwehr&quot; Enigma included four-letter names and German obscenities. Sometimes, with multi-part messages, the operator would not enter a key for a subsequent part of a message, merely leaving the rotors as they were at the end of the previous part, to become the message key for the next part.
* Having only three different rotors for the three positions in the scrambler. (This continued until December 1938, when it was increased to five and then eight for naval traffic in 1940.)
* Using only six plugboard leads, leaving 14 letters &quot;unsteckered&quot;. (This continued until January 1939 when the number of leads was increased, leaving only a small number of letters unsteckered.)

Other useful shortcomings that were discovered by the British and later the American cryptanalysts included the following, many of which depended on frequent solving of a particular network:

* The practice of re-transmitting a message in an identical, or near-identical, form on different cipher networks. If a message was transmitted using both a low-level cipher that Bletchley Park broke by hand, and Enigma, the decrypt provided an excellent crib for Enigma decipherment.
* For machines where there was a choice of more rotors than there were slots for them, a rule on some networks stipulated that no rotor should be in the same slot in the scrambler as it had been for the immediately preceding configuration. This reduced the number of wheel orders that had to be tried.
* Not allowing a wheel order to be repeated on a monthly setting sheet. This meant that when the keys were being found on a regular basis, economies in excluding possible wheel orders could be made.
* The stipulation, for Air Force operators, that no letter should be connected on the plugboard to its neighbour in the alphabet. This reduced the problem of identifying the plugboard connections and was automated in some Bombes with a Consecutive Stecker Knock-Out (CSKO) device.
* The sloppy practice that John Herivel anticipated soon after his arrival at Bletchley Park in January 1940. He thought about the practical actions that an Enigma operator would have to make, and the short-cuts he might employ. He thought that, after setting the alphabet rings to the prescribed setting, and closing the lid, the operator might not turn the rotors by more than a few places in selecting the first part of the indicator. Initially this did not seem to be the case, but after the changes of May 1940, what became known as the Herivel tip proved to be most useful.
* The practice of re-using some of the columns of wheel orders, ring settings, or plugboard connections from previous months. The resulting analytical short-cut was christened at Bletchley Park &quot;Parkerismus&quot; after Reg Parker, who had, through his meticulous record-keeping, spotted this phenomenon.
* The re-use of a permutation in the German Air Force METEO code as the Enigma &quot;stecker&quot; permutation for the day.

Mavis Lever, a member of Dilly Knox&#x27;s team, recalled an occasion when there was an unusual message, from the Italian Navy, whose exploitation led to the British victory at the Battle of Cape Matapan. 

Postwar debriefings of German cryptographic specialists, conducted as part of project TICOM, tend to support the view that the Germans were well aware that the un-steckered Enigma was theoretically solvable, but thought that the steckered Enigma had not been solved.

===Crib-based decryption===
The term &quot;crib&quot; was used at Bletchley Park to denote any &quot;known plaintext&quot; or &quot;suspected plaintext&quot; at some point in an enciphered message.

Britain&#x27;s Government Code and Cipher School (GC&amp;CS), before its move to Bletchley Park, had realised the value of recruiting mathematicians and logicians to work in codebreaking teams. Alan Turing, a Cambridge University mathematician with an interest in cryptology and in machines for implementing logical operations—and who was regarded by many as a genius—had started work for GC&amp;CS on a part-time basis from about the time of the Munich Crisis in 1938. Gordon Welchman, another Cambridge mathematician, had also received initial training in 1938, and they both reported to Bletchley Park on 4 September 1939, the day after Britain declared war on Germany.

Most of the Polish success had relied on the repetition within the indicator. But as soon as Turing moved to Bletchley Park—where he initially joined Dilly Knox in the research section—he set about seeking methods that did not rely on this weakness, as they correctly anticipated that the German Army and Air Force might follow the German Navy in improving their indicator system.

The Poles had used an early form of crib-based decryption in the days when only six leads were used on the plugboard. The technique became known as the &quot;Forty Weepy Weepy&quot; method for the following reason. When a message was a continuation of a previous one, the plaintext would start with &quot;FORT&quot; (from &quot;Fortsetzung&quot;, meaning &quot;continuation&quot;) followed by the time of the first message given twice bracketed by the letter &quot;Y&quot;. At this time numerals were represented by the letters on the top row of the Enigma keyboard. So, &quot;continuation of message sent at 2330&quot; was represented as &quot;FORTYWEEPYYWEEPY&quot;.

&quot;Cribs&quot; were fundamental to the British approach to solving Enigma keys, but guessing the plaintext for a message was a highly skilled business. So in 1940 Stuart Milner-Barry set up a special &quot;Crib Room&quot; in Hut 8.

Foremost among the knowledge needed for identifying cribs was the text of previous decrypts. Bletchley Park maintained detailed indexes of message preambles, of every person, of every ship, of every unit, of every weapon, of every technical term, and of repeated phrases such as forms of address and other German military jargon. For each message the traffic analysis recorded the radio frequency, the date and time of intercept, and the preamble—which contained the network-identifying discriminant, the time of origin of the message, the callsign of the originating and receiving stations, and the indicator setting. This allowed cross referencing of a new message with a previous one. Thus, as Derek Taunt, another Cambridge mathematician-cryptanalyst wrote, the truism that &quot;nothing succeeds like success&quot; is particularly apposite here.

Stereotypical messages included &quot;Keine besonderen Ereignisse&quot; (literally, &quot;no special occurrences&quot;—perhaps better translated as &quot;nothing to report&quot;), &quot;An die Gruppe&quot; (&quot;to the group&quot;) and a number that came from weather stations such as &quot;weub null seqs null null&quot; (&quot;weather survey 0600&quot;). This was actually rendered as &quot;WEUBYYNULLSEQSNULLNULL&quot;. The word &quot;WEUB&quot; being short for &quot;Wetterübersicht&quot;, &quot;YY&quot; was used as a separator, and &quot;SEQS&quot; was common abbreviation of &quot;sechs&quot; (German for &quot;six&quot;). As another example, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Quartermaster started all of his messages to his commander with the same formal introduction.

With a combination of probable plaintext fragment and the fact that no letter could be enciphered as itself, a corresponding ciphertext fragment could often be tested by trying every possible alignment of the crib against the ciphertext, a procedure known as &quot;crib-dragging&quot;. This, however, was only one aspect of the processes of solving a key. Derek Taunt has written that the three cardinal personal qualities that were in demand for cryptanalysis were (1) a creative imagination, (2) a well-developed critical faculty, and (3) a habit of meticulousness. Skill at solving crossword puzzles was famously tested in recruiting some cryptanalysts. This was useful in working out plugboard settings when a possible solution was being examined. For example, if the crib was the word &quot;WETTER&quot; (German for &quot;weather&quot;) and a possible decrypt before the plugboard settings had been discovered, was &quot;TEWWER&quot;, it is easy to see that &quot;T&quot; with &quot;W&quot; are &quot;stecker partners&quot;. These examples, although illustrative of the principles, greatly over-simplify the cryptanalysts&#x27; tasks.

A fruitful source of cribs was re-encipherments of messages that had previously been decrypted either from a lower-level manual cipher or from another Enigma network. This was called a &quot;kiss&quot; and happened particularly with German naval messages being sent in the &quot;dockyard cipher&quot; and repeated &quot;verbatim&quot; in an Enigma cipher. One German agent in Britain, Nathalie Sergueiew, code-named &quot;Treasure&quot;, who had been &#x27;turned&#x27; to work for the Allies, was very verbose in her messages back to Germany, which were then re-transmitted on the &quot;Abwehr&quot; Enigma network. She was kept going by MI5 because this provided long cribs, not because of her usefulness as an agent to feed incorrect information to the &quot;Abwehr&quot;.

Occasionally, when there was a particularly urgent need to solve German naval Enigma keys, such as when an Arctic convoy was about to depart, mines would be laid by the RAF in a defined position, whose grid reference in the German naval system did not contain any of the words (such as &quot;sechs&quot; or &quot;sieben&quot;) for which abbreviations or alternatives were sometimes used. The warning message about the mines and then the &quot;all clear&quot; message, would be transmitted both using the &quot;dockyard cipher&quot; and the U-boat Enigma network. This process of &quot;planting&quot; a crib was called &quot;gardening&quot;.

Although &quot;cillies&quot; were not actually cribs, the &quot;chit-chat&quot; in clear that Enigma operators indulged in among themselves often gave a clue as to the cillies that they might generate.

When captured German Enigma operators revealed that they had been instructed to encipher numbers by spelling them out rather than using the top row of the keyboard, Alan Turing reviewed decrypted messages and determined that the word &quot;eins&quot; (&quot;one&quot;) appeared in 90% of messages. Turing automated the crib process, creating the &quot;Eins Catalogue&quot;, which assumed that &quot;eins&quot; was encoded at all positions in the plaintext. The catalogue included every possible rotor position for &quot;EINS&quot; with that day&#x27;s &quot;wheel order&quot; and plugboard connections.

===British &quot;bombe&quot;===

The British bombe was an electromechanical device designed by Alan Turing soon after he arrived at Bletchley Park in September 1939. Harold &quot;Doc&quot; Keen of the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) in Letchworth ( from Bletchley) was the engineer who turned Turing&#x27;s ideas into a working machine—under the codename CANTAB. Turing&#x27;s specification developed the ideas of the Poles&#x27; &quot;bomba kryptologiczna&quot; but was designed for the much more general crib-based decryption.

The bombe helped to identify the &quot;wheel order&quot;, the initial positions of the rotor cores, and the &quot;stecker partner&quot; of a specified letter. This was achieved by examining all 17,576 possible scrambler positions for a set of &quot;wheel orders&quot; on a comparison between a crib and the ciphertext, so as to eliminate possibilities that contradicted the Enigma&#x27;s known characteristics. In the words of Gordon Welchman &quot;the task of the bombe was simply to reduce the assumptions of &quot;wheel order&quot; and scrambler positions that required &#x27;further analysis&#x27; to a manageable number&quot;.

The demountable drums on the front of the bombe were wired identically to the connections made by Enigma&#x27;s different rotors. Unlike them, however, the input and output contacts for the left-hand and the right-hand sides were separate, making 104 contacts between each drum and the rest of the machine. This allowed a set of scramblers to be connected in series by means of 26-way cables. Electrical connections between the rotating drums&#x27; wiring and the rear plugboard were by means of metal brushes. When the bombe detected a scrambler position with no contradictions, it stopped and the operator would note the position before restarting it.

Although Welchman had been given the task of studying Enigma traffic call signs and discriminants, he knew from Turing about the bombe design and early in 1940, before the first pre-production bombe was delivered, he showed him an idea to increase its effectiveness. It exploited the reciprocity in plugboard connections, to reduce considerably the number of scrambler settings that needed to be considered further. This became known as the &quot;diagonal board&quot; and was subsequently incorporated to great effect in all the bombes.

A cryptanalyst would prepare a crib for comparison with the ciphertext. This was a complicated and sophisticated task, which later took the Americans some time to master. As well as the crib, a decision as to which of the many possible &quot;wheel orders&quot; could be omitted had to be made. Turing&#x27;s Banburismus was used in making this major economy. The cryptanalyst would then compile a &quot;menu&quot; which specified the connections of the cables of the patch panels on the back of the machine, and a particular letter whose &quot;stecker partner&quot; was sought. The menu reflected the relationships between the letters of the crib and those of the ciphertext. Some of these formed loops (or &quot;closures&quot; as Turing called them) in a similar way to the &quot;cycles&quot; that the Poles had exploited.

The reciprocal nature of the plugboard meant that no letter could be connected to more than one other letter. When there was a contradiction of two different letters apparently being &quot;stecker partners&quot; with the letter in the menu, the bombe would detect this, and move on. If, however, this happened with a letter that was not part of the menu, a false stop could occur. In refining down the set of stops for further examination, the cryptanalyst would eliminate stops that contained such a contradiction. The other plugboard connections and the settings of the alphabet rings would then be worked out before the scrambler positions at the possible true stops were tried out on Typex machines that had been adapted to mimic Enigmas. All the remaining stops would correctly decrypt the crib, but only the true stop would produce the correct plaintext of the whole message.

To avoid wasting scarce bombe time on menus that were likely to yield an excessive number of false stops, Turing performed a lengthy probability analysis (without any electronic aids) of the estimated number of stops per rotor order. It was adopted as standard practice only to use menus that were estimated to produce no more than four stops per &quot;wheel order&quot;. This allowed an 8-letter crib for a 3-closure menu, an 11-letter crib for a 2-closure menu, and a 14-letter crib for a menu with only one closure. If there was no closure, at least 16 letters were required in the crib. The longer the crib, however, the more likely it was that &quot;turn-over&quot; of the middle rotor would have occurred.

The production model 3-rotor bombes contained 36 scramblers arranged in three banks of twelve. Each bank was used for a different &quot;wheel order&quot; by fitting it with the drums that corresponded to the Enigma rotors being tested. The first bombe was named &quot;Victory&quot; and was delivered to Bletchley Park on 18 March 1940. The next one, which included the diagonal board, was delivered on 8 August 1940. It was referred to as a &quot;spider bombe&quot; and was named &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; which soon became &quot;Agnes&quot; and then &quot;Aggie&quot;. The production of British bombes was relatively slow at first, with only five bombes being in use in June 1941, 15 by the year end, 30 by September 1942, 49 by January 1943 but eventually 210 at the end of the war.

A refinement that was developed for use on messages from those networks that disallowed the plugboard (&quot;Stecker&quot;) connection of adjacent letters, was the &quot;Consecutive Stecker Knock Out&quot;. This was fitted to 40 bombes and produced a useful reduction in false stops.

Initially the bombes were operated by ex-BTM servicemen, but in March 1941 the first detachment of members of the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service (known as &quot;Wrens&quot;) arrived at Bletchley Park to become bombe operators. By 1945 there were some 2,000 Wrens operating the bombes. Because of the risk of bombing, relatively few of the bombes were located at Bletchley Park. The largest two outstations were at Eastcote (some 110 bombes and 800 Wrens) and Stanmore (some 50 bombes and 500 Wrens). There were also bombe outstations at Wavendon, Adstock, and Gayhurst. Communication with Bletchley Park was by teleprinter links.

When the German Navy started using 4-rotor Enigmas, about sixty 4-rotor bombes were produced at Letchworth, some with the assistance of the General Post Office. The NCR-manufactured US Navy 4-rotor bombes were, however, very fast and the most successful. They were extensively used by Bletchley Park over teleprinter links (using the Combined Cipher Machine) to OP-20-G for both 3-rotor and 4-rotor jobs.

===&quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Enigma===
Although the German army, SS, police, and railway all used Enigma with similar procedures, it was the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (Air Force) that was the first and most fruitful source of Ultra intelligence during the war. The messages were decrypted in Hut 6 at Bletchley Park and turned into intelligence reports in Hut 3. The network code-named &#x27;Red&#x27; at Bletchley Park was broken regularly and quickly from 22 May 1940 until the end of hostilities. Indeed, the Air Force section of Hut 3 expected the new day&#x27;s Enigma settings to have been established in Hut 6 by breakfast time. The relative ease of solving this network&#x27;s settings was a product of plentiful cribs and frequent German operating mistakes. Luftwaffe chief Hermann Göring was known to use it for trivial communications, including informing squadron commanders to make sure the pilots he was going to decorate had been properly deloused. Such messages became known as &quot;Göring funnies&quot; to the staff at Bletchley Park.

===&quot;Abwehr&quot; Enigma===
Dilly Knox&#x27;s last great cryptanalytical success, before his untimely death in February 1943, was the solving of the &quot;Abwehr&quot; Enigma in 1941. Intercepts of traffic which had an 8-letter indicator sequence before the usual 5-letter groups led to the suspicion that a 4-rotor machine was being used. The assumption was correctly made that the indicator consisted of a 4-letter message key enciphered twice. The machine itself was similar to a Model G Enigma, with three conventional rotors, though it did not have a plug board. The principal difference to the model G was that it was equipped with a reflector that was advanced by the stepping mechanism once it had been set by hand to its starting position (in all other variants, the reflector was fixed). Collecting a set of enciphered message keys for a particular day allowed &quot;cycles&quot; (or &quot;boxes&quot; as Knox called them) to be assembled in a similar way to the method used by the Poles in the 1930s.

Knox was able to derive, using his &quot;buttoning up&quot; procedure, some of the wiring of the rotor that had been loaded in the fast position on that day. Progressively he was able to derive the wiring of all three rotors. Once that had been done, he was able to work out the wiring of the reflector. Deriving the indicator setting for that day was achieved using Knox&#x27;s time-consuming &quot;rodding&quot; procedure. This involved a great deal of trial and error, imagination, and crossword puzzle-solving skills, but was helped by &quot;cillies&quot;.

The &quot;Abwehr&quot; was the intelligence and counter-espionage service of the German High Command. The spies that it placed in enemy countries used a lower level cipher (which was broken by Oliver Strachey&#x27;s section at Bletchley Park) for their transmissions. However, the messages were often then re-transmitted word-for-word on the &quot;Abwehr&#x27;s&quot; internal Enigma networks, which gave the best possible crib for deciphering that day&#x27;s indicator setting. Interception and analysis of &quot;Abwehr&quot; transmissions led to the remarkable state of affairs that allowed MI5 to give a categorical assurance that all the German spies in Britain were controlled as double agents working for the Allies under the Double Cross System.

===German Army Enigma===
In the summer of 1940 following the Franco-German armistice, most Army Enigma traffic was travelling by land lines rather than radio and so was not available to Bletchley Park. The air Battle of Britain was crucial, so it was not surprising that the concentration of scarce resources was on &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and &quot;Abwehr&quot; traffic. It was not until early in 1941 that the first breaks were made into German Army Enigma traffic, and it was the spring of 1942 before it was broken reliably, albeit often with some delay. It is unclear whether the German Army Enigma operators made deciphering more difficult by making fewer operating mistakes.

===German Naval Enigma===
The German Navy used Enigma in the same way as the German Army and Air Force until 1 May 1937, when they changed to a substantially different system. This used the same sort of setting sheet but, importantly, it included the ground key for a period of two, sometimes three days. The message setting was concealed in the indicator by selecting a trigram from a book (the &quot;Kenngruppenbuch&quot;, or K-Book) and performing a bigram substitution on it. This defeated the Poles, although they suspected some sort of bigram substitution.

The procedure for the naval sending operator was as follows. First they selected a trigram from the K-Book, say YLA. They then looked in the appropriate columns of the K-Book and selected another trigram, say YVT, and wrote it in the boxes at the top of the message form:

They then filled in the &quot;dots&quot; with any letters, giving say:

Finally they looked up the vertical pairs of letters in the Bigram Tables

and wrote down the resultant pairs, UB, LK, RS, and PW which were transmitted as two four letter groups at the start and end of the enciphered message. The receiving operator performed the converse procedure to obtain the message key for setting his Enigma rotors.

As well as these &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; procedures being much more secure than those of the German Army and Air Force, the German Navy Enigma introduced three more rotors (VI, VII, and VIII), early in 1940. The choice of three rotors from eight meant that there were a total of 336 possible permutations of rotors and their positions.

Alan Turing decided to take responsibility for German naval Enigma because &quot;no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself&quot;. He established Hut 8 with Peter Twinn and two &quot;girls&quot;. Turing used the indicators and message settings for traffic from 1–8 May 1937 that the Poles had worked out, and some very elegant deductions to diagnose the complete indicator system. After the messages were deciphered they were translated for transmission to the Admiralty in Hut 4.

====German Navy 3-rotor Enigma====
The first break of wartime traffic was in December 1939, into signals that had been intercepted in November 1938, when only three rotors and six plugboard leads had been in use. It used &quot;Forty Weepy Weepy&quot; cribs.

A captured German &quot;Funkmaat&quot; (&quot;radio operator&quot;) named Meyer had revealed that numerals were now spelt out as words. EINS, the German for &quot;one&quot;, was present in about 90% of genuine German Navy messages. An EINS catalogue was compiled consisting of the encipherment of EINS at all 105,456 rotor settings. These were compared with the ciphertext, and when matches were found, about a quarter of them yielded the correct plaintext. Later this process was automated in Mr Freeborn&#x27;s section using Hollerith equipment. When the ground key was known, this EINS-ing procedure could yield three bigrams for the tables that were then gradually assembled.

Further progress required more information from German Enigma users. This was achieved through a succession of &quot;pinches&quot;, the capture of Enigma parts and codebooks. The first of these was on 12 February 1940, when rotors VI and VII, whose wiring was at that time unknown, were captured from the , by minesweeper .

On 26 April 1940, the Narvik-bound German patrol boat &quot;VP2623&quot;, disguised as a Dutch trawler named &quot;Polares&quot;, was captured by . This yielded an instruction manual, codebook sheets, and a record of some transmissions, which provided complete cribs. This confirmed that Turing&#x27;s deductions about the trigram/bigram process were correct and allowed a total of six days&#x27; messages to be broken, the last of these using the first of the bombes. However, the numerous possible rotor sequences, together with a paucity of usable cribs, made the methods used against the Army and Air Force Enigma messages of very limited value with respect to the Navy messages.

At the end of 1939, Turing extended the clock method invented by the Polish cryptanalyst Jerzy Różycki. Turing&#x27;s method became known as &quot;Banburismus&quot;. Turing said that at that stage &quot;I was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken&quot;. Banburismus used large cards printed in Banbury (hence the Banburismus name) to discover correlations and a statistical scoring system to determine likely rotor orders (&quot;Walzenlage&quot;) to be tried on the bombes. The practice conserved scarce bombe time and allowed more messages to be attacked. In practice, the 336 possible rotor orders could be reduced to perhaps 18 to be run on the bombes. Knowledge of the bigrams was essential for Banburismus, and building up the tables took a long time. This lack of visible progress led to Frank Birch, head of the Naval Section, to write on 21 August 1940 to Edward Travis, Deputy Director of Bletchley Park: 

Schemes for capturing Enigma material were conceived including, in September 1940, Operation Ruthless by Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming (author of the James Bond novels). When this was cancelled, Birch told Fleming that &quot;Turing and Twinn came to me like undertakers cheated of a nice corpse...&quot;

A major advance came through Operation Claymore, a commando raid on the Lofoten Islands on 4 March 1941. The German armed trawler &quot;Krebs&quot; was captured, including the complete Enigma keys for February, but no bigram tables or K-book. However, the material was sufficient to reconstruct the bigram tables by &quot;EINS-ing&quot;, and by late March they were almost complete.

Banburismus then started to become extremely useful. Hut 8 was expanded and moved to 24-hour working, and a crib room was established. The story of Banburismus for the next two years was one of improving methods, of struggling to get sufficient staff, and of a steady growth in the relative and absolute importance of cribbing as the increasing numbers of bombes made the running of cribs ever faster. Of value in this period were further &quot;pinches&quot; such as those from the German weather ships &quot;München&quot; and &quot;Lauenburg&quot; and the submarines and .

Despite the introduction of the 4-rotor Enigma for Atlantic U-boats, the analysis of traffic enciphered with the 3-rotor Enigma proved of immense value to the Allied navies. Banburismus was used until July 1943, when it became more efficient to use the many more bombes that had become available.

====M4 (German Navy 4-rotor Enigma)====

On 1 February 1942, the Enigma messages to and from Atlantic U-boats, which Bletchley Park called &quot;Shark&quot;, became significantly different from the rest of the traffic, which they called &quot;Dolphin&quot;.

This was because a new Enigma version had been brought into use. It was a development of the 3-rotor Enigma with the reflector replaced by a thin rotor and a thin reflector. Eventually, there were two fourth-position rotors that were called Beta and Gamma and two thin reflectors, Bruno and Caesar, which could be used in any combination. These rotors were not advanced by the rotor to their right, in the way that rotors I through VIII were.

The introduction of the fourth rotor did not catch Bletchley Park by surprise, because captured material dated January 1941 had made reference to its development as an adaptation of the 3-rotor machine, with the fourth rotor wheel to be a reflector wheel. Indeed, because of operator errors, the wiring of the new fourth rotor had already been worked out.

This major challenge could not be met by using existing methods and resources for a number of reasons.
# The work on the Shark cipher would have to be independent of the continuing work on messages in the Dolphin cipher.
# Solving Shark keys on 3-rotor bombes would have taken 50 to 100 times as long as an average Air Force or Army job.
# U-boat cribs at this time were extremely poor.

It seemed, therefore, that effective, fast, 4-rotor bombes were the only way forward. This was an immense problem and it gave a great deal of trouble. Work on a high speed machine had been started by Wynn-Williams of the TRE late in 1941 and some nine months later Harold Keen of BTM started work independently. Early in 1942, Bletchley Park were a long way from possessing a high speed machine of any sort.

Eventually, after a long period of being unable to decipher U-boat messages, a source of cribs was found. This was the Kurzsignale (short signals), a code which the German navy used to minimise the duration of transmissions, thereby reducing the risk of being located by high-frequency direction finding techniques. The messages were only 22 characters long and were used to report sightings of possible Allied targets. A copy of the code book had been captured from on 9 May 1941. A similar coding system was used for weather reports from U-boats, the &quot;Wetterkurzschlüssel&quot;, (Weather Short Code Book). A copy of this had been captured from on 29 or 30 October 1942. These short signals had been used for deciphering 3-rotor Enigma messages and it was discovered that the new rotor had a neutral position at which it, and its matching reflector, behaved just like a 3-rotor Enigma reflector. This allowed messages enciphered at this neutral position to be deciphered by a 3-rotor machine, and hence deciphered by a standard bombe. Deciphered Short Signals provided good material for bombe menus for Shark. Regular deciphering of U-boat traffic restarted in December 1942.

===Italian naval Enigma===
In 1940 Dilly Knox wanted to establish whether the Italian Navy were still using the same system that he had cracked during the Spanish Civil War; he instructed his assistants to use rodding to see whether the crib &quot;PERX&quot; (&quot;per&quot; being Italian for &quot;for&quot; and &quot;X&quot; being used to indicate a space between words) worked for the first part of the message. After three months there was no success, but Mavis Lever, a 19-year-old student, found that rodding produced &quot;PERS&quot; for the first four letters of one message. She then (against orders) tried beyond this and obtained &quot;PERSONALE&quot; (Italian for &quot;personal&quot;). This confirmed that the Italians were indeed using the same machines and procedures.

The subsequent breaking of Italian naval Enigma ciphers led to substantial Allied successes. The cipher-breaking was disguised by sending a reconnaissance aircraft to the known location of a warship before attacking it, so that the Italians assumed that this was how they had been discovered. The Royal Navy&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941 was considerably helped by Ultra intelligence obtained from Italian naval Enigma signals.

===American &quot;bombes&quot;===

Unlike the situation at Bletchley Park, the United States armed services did not share a combined cryptanalytical service. Before the US joined the war, there was collaboration with Britain, albeit with a considerable amount of caution on Britain&#x27;s side because of the extreme importance of Germany and her allies not learning that its codes were being broken. Despite some worthwhile collaboration among the cryptanalysts, their superiors took some time to achieve a trusting relationship in which both British and American bombes were used to mutual benefit.

In February 1941, Captain Abraham Sinkov and Lieutenant Leo Rosen of the US Army, and Lieutenants Robert Weeks and Prescott Currier of the US Navy, arrived at Bletchley Park, bringing, among other things, a replica of the &quot;Purple&quot; cipher machine for Bletchley Park&#x27;s Japanese section in Hut 7. The four returned to America after ten weeks, with a naval radio direction-finding unit and many documents, including a &quot;paper Enigma&quot;.

The main American response to the 4-rotor Enigma was the US Navy bombe, which was manufactured in much less constrained facilities than were available in wartime Britain. Colonel John Tiltman, who later became Deputy Director at Bletchley Park, visited the US Navy cryptanalysis office (OP-20-G) in April 1942 and recognised America&#x27;s vital interest in deciphering U-boat traffic. The urgent need, doubts about the British engineering workload, and slow progress prompted the US to start investigating designs for a Navy bombe, based on the full blueprints and wiring diagrams received by US Navy Lieutenants Robert Ely and Joseph Eachus at Bletchley Park in July 1942. Funding for a full, $2 million, Navy development effort was requested on 3 September 1942 and approved the following day.
Commander Edward Travis, Deputy Director and Frank Birch, Head of the German Naval Section travelled from Bletchley Park to Washington in September 1942. With Carl Frederick Holden, US Director of Naval Communications they established, on 2 October 1942, a UK:US accord which may have &quot;a stronger claim than BRUSA to being the forerunner of the UKUSA Agreement&quot;, being the first agreement &quot;to establish the special Sigint relationship between the two countries&quot;, and &quot;it set the pattern for UKUSA, in that the United States was very much the senior partner in the alliance&quot;. It established a relationship of &quot;full collaboration&quot; between Bletchley Park and OP-20-G.

An all electronic solution to the problem of a fast bombe was considered, but rejected for pragmatic reasons, and a contract was let with the National Cash Register Corporation (NCR) in Dayton, Ohio. This established the United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory. Engineering development was led by NCR&#x27;s Joseph Desch, a brilliant inventor and engineer. He had already been working on electronic counting devices.

Alan Turing, who had written a memorandum to OP-20-G (probably in 1941), was seconded to the British Joint Staff Mission in Washington in December 1942, because of his exceptionally wide knowledge about the bombes and the methods of their use. He was asked to look at the bombes that were being built by NCR and at the security of certain speech cipher equipment under development at Bell Labs. He visited OP-20-G, and went to NCR in Dayton on 21 December. He was able to show that it was not necessary to build 336 Bombes, one for each possible rotor order, by utilising techniques such as Banburismus. The initial order was scaled down to 96 machines.

The US Navy bombes used drums for the Enigma rotors in much the same way as the British bombes, but were very much faster. The first machine was completed and tested on 3 May 1943. Soon these bombes were more available than the British bombes at Bletchley Park and its outstations, and as a consequence they were put to use for Hut 6 as well as Hut 8 work. A total of 121 Navy bombes were produced.

The US Army also produced a version of a bombe. It was physically very different from the British and US Navy bombes. A contract was signed with Bell Labs on 30 September 1942. The machine was designed to analyse 3-rotor, not 4-rotor traffic. It did not use drums to represent the Enigma rotors, using instead telephone-type relays. It could, however, handle one problem that the bombes with drums could not. The set of ten bombes consisted of a total of 144 Enigma-equivalents, each mounted on a rack approximately long high and wide. There were 12 control stations which could allocate any of the Enigma-equivalents into the desired configuration by means of plugboards. Rotor order changes did not require the mechanical process of changing drums, but was achieved in about half a minute by means of push buttons. A 3-rotor run took about 10 minutes.

===German suspicions===
The German navy was concerned that Enigma could be compromised. They printed key schedules in water-soluble inks so that they could not be salvaged. They policed their operators and disciplined them when they made errors that could compromise the cipher. The navy minimised its exposure. For example, ships that might be captured or run aground did not carry Enigma machines. When ships were lost in circumstances where the enemy might salvage them, the Germans investigated. After investigating some losses in 1940, Germany changed some message indicators.

In April 1940, the British sank eight German destroyers in Norway. The Germans concluded that it was unlikely that the British were reading Enigma.

In May 1941, the British deciphered some messages that gave the location of some supply ships for the battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; and the cruiser &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;. As part of the &quot;Operation Rheinübung&quot; commerce raid, the Germans had assigned five tankers, two supply ships, and two scouts to support the warships. After the &quot;Bismarck&quot; was sunk, the British directed its forces to sink the supporting ships &quot;Belchen&quot;, &quot;Esso Hamburg&quot;, &quot;Egerland&quot;, and some others. The Admiralty specifically did not target the tanker &quot;Gedania&quot; and the scout &quot;Gonzenheim&quot;, figuring that sinking so many ships within one week would indicate to Germany that Britain was reading Enigma. However, by chance, British forces found those two ships and sank them. The Germans investigated, but concluded Enigma had not been breached by either seizures or brute-force cryptanalysis. Nevertheless, the Germans took some steps to make Enigma more secure. Grid locations (an encoded latitude and longitude) were further disguised using digraph tables and a numeric offset. The U-boats were given their own network, &quot;Triton&quot;, to minimise the chance of a cryptanalytic attack.

In August 1941, the British captured . The Germans concluded the crew would have destroyed the important documents, so the cipher was safe. Even if the British had captured the materials intact and could read Enigma, the British would lose that ability when the keys changed on 1 November.

Although Germany realised that convoys were avoiding its wolfpacks, it did not attribute that ability to reading Enigma traffic. Instead, Dönitz thought that Britain was using radar and direction finding. The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; continued to increase the number of networks to avoid superimposition attacks on Enigma. At the beginning of 1943, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; had 13 networks.

The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; also improved the Enigma. On 1 February 1942, it started using the four-rotor Enigma. The improved security meant that convoys no longer had as much information about the whereabouts of wolfpacks, and were therefore less able to avoid areas where they would be attacked. The increased success of wolfpack attacks following the strengthening of the encryption might have given the Germans a clue that the previous Enigma codes had been broken. However, that recognition did not happen because other things changed at the same time: the United States had entered the war, and Dönitz had sent U-boats to raid the US East Coast, where there were many easy targets.

In early 1943, Dönitz was worried that the Allies were reading Enigma. Germany&#x27;s own cryptanalysis of Allied communications showed surprising accuracy in its estimates of wolfpack sizes. It was concluded, however, that Allied direction finding was the source. The Germans also recovered a cavity magnetron, used to generate radar waves, from a downed British bomber. The conclusion was that the Enigma was secure. The Germans were still suspicious, so each submarine got its own key net in June 1944.

By 1945, almost all German Enigma traffic (Wehrmacht military; comprising the Heer, Kriegsmarine, and Luftwaffe; and German intelligence and security services like the Abwehr, SD, etc.) could be decrypted within a day or two, yet the Germans remained confident of its security. They openly discussed their plans and movements, handing the Allies huge amounts of information, not all of which was used effectively. For example, Rommel&#x27;s actions at Kasserine Pass were clearly foreshadowed in decrypted Enigma traffic, but the Americans did not properly appreciate the information.

After the war, Allied TICOM project teams found and detained a considerable number of German cryptographic personnel. Among the things learned was that German cryptographers, at least, understood very well that Enigma messages might be read; they knew Enigma was not unbreakable. They just found it impossible to imagine anyone going to the immense effort required. When Abwehr personnel who had worked on Fish cryptography and Russian traffic were interned at Rosenheim around May 1945, they were not at all surprised that Enigma had been broken, only that someone had mustered all the resources in time to actually do it. Admiral Dönitz had been advised that a cryptanalytic attack was the least likely of all security problems.

==After World War II==
Modern computers can be used to solve Enigma, using a variety of techniques. There have been projects to decrypt some remaining messages using distributed computing.

On 8 May 2020, to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day, GCHQ released the last Enigma message to be decrypted by codebreakers at Bletchley Park. The message was sent at 07:35 on 7 May 1945 by a German radio operator in Cuxhaven and read: &quot;British troops entered Cuxhaven at 14:00 on 6 May 1945 – all radio broadcast will cease with immediate effect – I wish you all again the best of luck&quot;. It was immediately followed by another message: &quot;Closing down forever – all the best – goodbye&quot;.

The break into Enigma had been kept a secret until 1974. The machines were used well into the 1960s in Switzerland, Norway (Norenigma), and in some British colonies.

<doc id="872180" wikidata="Q1147908" url="?curid=872180" title="Pyometra">
<text>Pyometra or pyometritis is a uterine infection. Though it is most commonly known as a disease of the unaltered female dog, it is also a notable human disease. It is also seen in female cattle, horses, goats, sheep, swine, cats, rabbits, hamsters, ferrets, rats and guinea pigs. Pyometra is an important disease to be aware of for any dog or cat owner because of the sudden nature of the disease and the deadly consequences if left untreated. It has been compared to acute appendicitis in humans, because both are essentially empyemas within an abdominal organ.

==Signs and symptoms==

The most obvious symptom of open pyometra is a discharge of pus from the vulva in a female that has recently been in heat. However, symptoms of closed pyometra are less obvious. Symptoms of both types include vomiting, loss of appetite, depression, and increased drinking and urinating. Fever is seen in less than a third of female dogs with pyometra. Closed pyometra is a more serious condition than open pyometra not only because there is no outlet for the infection, but also because a diagnosis of closed pyometra can easily be missed due to its insidious nature. Bloodwork may show dehydration and/or increased white blood cell count. X-rays will show an enlarged uterus, and ultrasound will confirm the presence of a fluid filled uterus.

==Cause==
The risk of developing pyometra differs between dog breeds. Pyometra is a result of hormonal and structural changes in the uterus lining. This can happen at any age, regardless of how many heat cycles have occurred or previous pregnancies (or lack thereof), although it becomes more common as the dog gets older. The main risk period for a female is for eight weeks after her peak standing heat has ended. Normally during this period, the cervix, which opens during heat, begins to close, and the inner lining begins to adapt back to normal. However, cystic hyperplasia of the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) – known as cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH) – may occur at this time for some animals, as an inappropriate response to progesterone.

Under these circumstances, bacteria (especially &quot;E. coli&quot;) that have migrated from the vagina into the uterus find the environment favorable to growth, especially since progesterone also causes mucus secretion, closes the cervix (preventing uterine drainage), and decreases uterine contractility. The condition of the cervix is a major factor in the severity of the condition.
:* If the cervix is open, the infected material can leave the body, and this is far easier and safer to treat. This is known as open pyometra.
:* If the cervix is fully closed, there is no discharge from the vulva, and like in appendicitis, the uterus may rupture and pus escapes into the abdomen, causing peritonitis and possible rapid death. This is known as closed pyometra.

===Hormonal influences and mis-mating shots===
Females that have received estradiol as a mismating shot in diestrus are at risk for more severe disease because estrogen increases the number of progesterone receptors in the endometrium. 25 percent of females receiving estradiol in diestrus develop pyometra. Pyometra is less common in female cats because progesterone is only released by the ovaries after mating. Also in cats, the risk of developing the disease differs depending on breed.

==Treatment==
The most important aspect of treatment of pyometra is quick action to provide supportive care. Female dogs are often septic and in shock (see septic shock). Intravenous fluids and antibiotics should be given immediately. Once the female dog has been stabilized, then the treatment of choice is an emergency spay. In livestock the treatment of choice for minor cases is dinoprost tremethamine (lutalyse). Supportive antibiotic treatment may be recommended also. Severe cases require surgery.

<doc id="872189" wikidata="Q1126163" url="?curid=872189" title="Connaught Tunnel">
<text>The Connaught Tunnel is in southeastern British Columbia, on the Revelstoke–Donald segment. The tunnel carries the Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) main line under Mount Macdonald in the Selkirk Mountains. The tunnel, opened by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) in 1916, replaced the previous routing over Rogers Pass.

==History==
===Summit route deficiencies===
Traffic restrictions imposed by a single track comprising of 2.2 percent gradients, emerging competition, and snow-related costs, were negative factors. The 1910 Rogers Pass avalanche, and other avalanches on the pass, influenced but did not unduly pressure CP to consider alternatives; however, snow clearing and maintaining snow sheds was an ongoing burden.

Rarely assigning more than one pusher locomotive per train, trains over 1,016 tons had to be cut. Higher capacity locomotives had helped, but the next leap forward would not occur until the Selkirk locomotives emerged in 1929. In 1912, the average of eight trains (peaking at 11) per day in each direction was forecast to double over the next four years. The program to double-track much of the route through the mountains could create a bottleneck at Rogers Pass. Following the 1906–1908 recession, by 1912, passenger and freight volumes surpassed records. Whereas passenger train length could increase, freight could not, because of weight capacity limits. Furthermore, the former had priority, causing siding waits for the latter.

The opening of the Grand Trunk Pacific (GTP) posed a threat to CP&#x27;s grain and Asian trade. Using a single locomotive, GTP could haul 2,041 tons from Edmonton to Prince Rupert, via Yellowhead Pass, four times the weight CP could haul across the mountains on its main line. The opening of the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) via the Yellowhead to Vancouver, the premier destination, prompted greater alarm. The opening of the Panama Canal, which bypassed all North American rail routes, offered some compensation in that grain traffic destined for Europe could travel westward by rail.

===Prior significant improvements in the mountains===
In 1902, the Ottertail Diversion, west from Field, eliminated the need for pushers. In 1887, after a tunnel collapsed near Palliser, the temporary realignment around a bluff of the Kicking Horse River existed until the Palliser Tunnel (1906). In 1909, the Spiral Tunnels replaced the Big Hill. 

===Alternatives===
====Routes====
The three basic options within the Selkirks were to use the Big Bend, double-track the summit, or dig a tunnel. The Big Bend route was not a viable contender. Estimates indicated that a tunnel would be cheaper than snow sheds and operational costs for double-tracking the summit.

====Tunnels====
Three schemes were considered. In 1912, Thomas Kilpatrick, superintendent of the Mountain Subdivision, suggested a tunnel, which would have shortened the line by , reducing the pusher gradient by on the east slope and on the west one. This alignment would have eliminated the bridges at Mountain, Surprise, and Stoney creeks, but was rejected owing to perceived construction deadlines, and a route beneath the headwaters of the Illecillewaet River, vulnerable to leakage. The deadline and route fears proved suspect.

F.F. Busteed, general superintendent of the Pacific Division, proposed a tunnel, which would have shortened the line by , reducing the pusher gradient by on the east slope and on the west one. John G. Sullivan, chief engineer, recommended a tunnel, similar to, but more expensive than, the Busteed one. All proposals eliminated the Loops on the west slope of the pass route.

===Proposal and tender===
The stated advantages were three-fold. Primarily, the tunnel lowered the grade; secondly, it shortened the distance; and thirdly, it bypassed an avalanche-prone zone.

The specified alignment would lower the track summit from to , shorten the line by , reduce the pusher gradient by on the east slope and on the west one, and eliminate the Stoney, Surprise, and Mountain creek bridges. The tunnel grade would be 0.95% westward. At the west portal, the route required a diversion of the Illecillewaet River for about . Let out to tender in April 1913, the bids received were unacceptably high. It was immediately retendered as a cost-plus contract, with bonus and penalty clauses. After negotiations with the lowest bidder, the contract was awarded to Foley, Welch and Stewart (FW&amp;S) in July 1913.
===Construction===
The Rogers Pass article shows the summit route details. Only the crest and eastern slope of the tunnel route is underground.

The primary construction camp was near the western portal, a secondary one was near the eastern portal, and a minor one was at Bear Creek. The western portal one, housing 300, was approached either from Loop Spur or the government road from Glacier House. The eastern portal one, housing 200, had only rail access. Both comprised a police post, small hospital, general store, offices, apartments, bunkhouses, kitchen, dining hall, and lounge, with electric lighting and plumbing for water and sanitation. 

Operating three shifts daily, a pioneer tunnel advanced from each end, from which cross cuts were made to the main tunnel so work could carry on at a number of headings simultaneously. Compressed air equipment, blasting, steam shovels, and narrow-gauge cars were used. At high and wide, the tunnel would accommodate double tracks. The western side involved penetrating thick mud, extremely hard rock, and finally softer rock. The highest point of the Selkirks track was just inside the western portal. Three steam shovels were based on the west side and one on the east. Death and injury were not uncommon. Mirroring the advance across the pass in the 1880s, concern for the health and safety of workers was not a priority. Beating world monthly tunneling records, the pioneer headings met in December 1915, and the main bores in July 1916.

The unacceptably high cost projection scrapped the electrification plan. Instead, ventilation fans were installed. East of the tunnel, the plan for double-tracking to Six-Mile Creek was amended to a level single track connecting with the existing line at Stoney Creek. This reduced the pusher gradient on the east slope by , less than specified. However, it retained the substantial investment in the bridges at Mountain, Surprise, and Stoney creeks. The tunnel was completed 11 months ahead of schedule and below budget. One calculation of costs listed tunneling $4.91M, tunnel track $0.16M, approaches $0.86M, and ventilation $0.11M, totaling $6.04M, less the salvage value of the abandoned line $1.67M. Extending the concrete lining during 1919–1925 added a further $2.60M. The $8.64M total is in line with a different calculation of $8.45M. In all, the route was shortened by .

===Repairs, modifications, and emergencies===
In 1919, 30 drums of gasoline and kerosene, used by the concrete mixers engaged in the lining operation, ignited. A tunnel watchman, who rushed some distance to the nearest telephone to alert Connaught station at the eastern portal, did not survive. His warning saved the westbound transcontinental, then at the station, from proceeding into the tunnel. Nine workers escaped on a handcar from the east portal, and one watchman staggered from the west portal.

To deal with crumbling rock in the roof, the concrete tunnel lining was extended from to . Prior to the 1925 completion of the project, falling rock killed or injured several workers.

In 1928, a locomotive boiler explosion killed three crew members near Glacier.

In 1929, two train crew died when their locomotive fell into the ravine when a girder collapsed on the Surprise Creek Bridge.

The 1931 flood sent 2,000 replacement ties through the tunnel and filled the west portal cutting to a depth with of mud and debris, which took five days to dig out.

Approved in 1958, the following year a single track down the center (replacing the double tracks) provided sufficient clearance for tri-deck automobile carriers.

In 1972 and 1976, the tunnel fans and housing sustained extensive damage on catching fire.

In 1977, soon after departing the Glacier siding (Mile 85.9), a westbound loaded 109-car coal train lost control, and broadcast a warning that they were travelling too fast to make the curves at Illecillewaet. On hearing the radio message, a 60-car eastbound freight accelerated to safely reach Illecillewaet siding (Mile 98.1), before three crew members stepped clear of their train. The runaway&#x27;s three lead locomotives, 45 cars, a remote control locomotive, and the following 22 cars, were destroyed on derailing at Mile 94.4. The impact shifted a bridge from its footings and damaged a snow shed. The crew sustained minor injuries. The line remained closed for a week.

In 1985, a nearby rock slide derailed one of the four locomotives hauling a coal train. 

The tunnel was deepened to clearances matched with the Mount Macdonald Tunnel in 1993 to accommodate double-stack container cars with future electrification. This first 24/7 work project undertaken by CP was a significant engineering challenge.

In 1997, eight cars of a train derailed in the vicinity. 

In 2015, six cars of a westbound freight derailed on Stoney Creek Bridge. The train had diverted to the eastbound route because the Mount Macdonald Tunnel was being vented. The incident occurred when the train lost momentum on the steeper grade and stopped with the cars on the bridge. However, restarting on the curve caused the heavier cars at the front and rear of the train to lift the lighter middle cars from the track.

===Operation===
The first commercial train was December 1916, which traveled via Loop Spur, since the pass line remained in use until a few days later. The most northern part of the Loops between the two hillsides, which had been a long trestle, but likely infilled around 1906, needed to be breached by the new line. 

Automatic block signalling came in the 1920s. To improve visibility on the 1929 introduction of the Selkirk locomotives, trains switched to the left-hand track before entering the tunnel. In 1950, multiple aspect signalling was installed. In 1954, diesel locomotives became standard. 

Pusher units cut into westbound freight trains at Beavermouth, before disconnecting at Stoney Creek. On occasions, when pushers worked through to Glacier, crew were required to wear respirators, owing to the tunnel fumes. The tunnel blocked radio communication. The 1974 realignment west of Beavermouth moved the connection point to Rogers. After the 1988 opening of the Mount Macdonald Tunnel, westbound traffic primarily used that lower gradient route, with Connaught handling eastbound. During the pusher station&#x27;s existence, six engineers, six maintenance workers, and nine locomotives were based at Rogers. Five-engine units were used on heavy trains carrying grain, coal, and potash. Four-engine units were used on other freights.

===Notability===
When opened, the tunnel ranked eighth in length:
# Simplon Tunnel (1906) 
# Gotthard Tunnel (1882) 
# Lötschberg Tunnel (1913) 
# Fréjus Rail Tunnel (Mont Cenis) (1871) , extended (1881) 
# Arlberg Railway Tunnel (1884) 
# Ricken Tunnel (1910) 
# Tauern Railway Tunnel (1909) 
# Connaught Tunnel (1916) 

However, it took the title from the Hoosac Tunnel (1875) as the longest railway tunnel in North America until displaced by the Moffat Tunnel (1928) in 1928.

Officially opened in July 1916 by the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, the governor general, the Selkirk Tunnel was renamed the Connaught Tunnel weeks later.

In 2001, the tunnel was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame.

When partway through the project, rock drillers J. A. McIlwee and Sons encountered an unexpected predominance of crumbly slate, FW&amp;S dismissed the subcontractor, rather than negotiate a contract variance. After several appeals, including a hearing of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the courts awarded McIlwee about $576,000 for breach of contract. At the time, this was the largest single judgement obtained in a BC court.

W.J. Hackman (1928–1953) was the first child born in the tunnel. The birth occurred on the westbound CP No. 2. Passenger train. The next birth appears to have occurred in 1939.

<text>Georgia Day is the holiday which the U.S. state of Georgia recognizes in honor of its colonial founding as the Province of Georgia. On February 12, 1733 [NS] James Oglethorpe landed the first settlers in the &quot;Anne&quot;, at what was to become Georgia&#x27;s first city (and later the first state capital), Savannah. Not a public holiday, it was created by Georgia&#x27;s General Assembly, which provided that Feb. 12, &quot;the anniversary of the landing of the first colonists in Georgia under Oglethorpe&quot;—be observed in the public schools as Georgia Day. The law was never repealed, but was not included in the code when it was officially compiled in 1981. Its official legal status is unclear. 

Georgia Day is now observed on or around February 12 at the Georgia Day Parade hosted by the Georgia Historical Society as part of the Georgia History Festival.

<doc id="872208" wikidata="Q3273397" url="?curid=872208" title="Jharkhand Mukti Morcha">
<text>Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (; ) is a political party in the Indian state of Jharkhand which was founded by Binod Bihari Mahato. Shibu Soren is the president of the JMM. JMM is also an influential political party in the state of Odisha and parts of neighbouring of states. Its election symbol for Jharkhand is &quot;Bow and Arrow&quot;.

The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th-century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand. The State of Jharkhand also came into existence on Birsa Munda&#x27;s birthday in 2000.

== Formation ==
For almost six decades the movement to separate Jharkhand from Bihar had been attempting to gain a foothold. The Jharkhand Party gained political strength but commissions examining the demands for a separate Jharkhand State consistently rejected its demands. Before 1962, the Jharkhand Party held between 23 and 32 seats in the Bihar Legislative Assembly. In 1962, it won 20 seats. Jaipal Singh Munda merged the Jharkhand Party with the Indian National Congress in 1963 and became a minister in Vinodanand Jha&#x27;s government in Bihar. But other members did not join the Congress.

In the 1967 general election, the party had a very poor showing with only eight Assembly seats. The party soon split into several splinter parties each claiming to be the real Jharkhand Party. These included the Jharkhand Party led by N. E. Horo, the Jharkhand Party led by Naren, and the All India Jharkhand Party led by Bagun Sumroi. There was also the Hul Jharkhand Party led by Justin Richard, which further fragmented and became the Bihar Progressive Hul Jharkhand Party led by Shibu Soren.

Jharkhand Mukti Morcha was founded by Soren, Binod Bihari Mahato and Marxist Co-ordination Committee leader A. K. Roy. The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, a 19th-century tribal warrior from Jharkhand, who fought against British rule in the region.

On 4 February 1973, Mahato became president of the party and Soren became its general secretary. Prominent party leaders at that time included Roy, Nirmal Mahto and Tek Lal Mahto, among others.

== Early years ==

In its early years, the JMM under Soren&#x27;s leadership brought industrial and mining workers who were mainly non-tribals belonging to the Dalit and backward communities such as Surdis, Doms, Dusadh, Kurmi, Koiri, Gowala, and Teli into its fold. However Soren&#x27;s association with the late politician Gyanranjan brought him close to the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He won the Dumka Lok Sabha seat in 1972. Irked by Soren&#x27;s association with the Indian National Congress, a few younger members of the JMM banded together in Jamshedpur and set up the All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU). This did not affect the growth of the JMM in the 1991 Indian general election, where the party won six seats.

Ram Dayal Munda reignited the movement for Jharkhand by unifying splinter groups among the tribals. Under his guidance the Jharkhand Coordination Committee was constituted in June 1987, comprising 48 organisations and group including the JMM factions. Due to Munda, Shibu Soren, Suraj Mandal, Simon Marandi, Shailendra Mahato, and AJSU leaders like Surya Singh Besra and Prabhakar Tirkey briefly shared a political platform, but the JMM pulled out of JCC as it felt that &quot;the collective leadership was a farce&quot;. In 1988 and 1989, the JMM, AJSU and JPP successfully orchestrated so-called bandhs, economic blockades.

==Jharkhand Yuva Morcha==

Jharkhand Yuva Morcha (Jharkhand Youth Front) and Jharkhand Chhatra Morcha (Jharkhand Student Front), the youth and student wings of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, were constituted at a conference in Ranchi 16 October 1991.

<text>Victoria Gotti (born November 27, 1962) is an American writer and television personality, known for being the daughter of Gambino crime family Mafia boss John Gotti.

==Early life==
Victoria Gotti was born November 27, 1962, in Brooklyn, New York. Her parents are mob boss John Gotti and Victoria (DiGiorgio) Gotti, whose father was of Italian descent, and mother was of half Italian half Russian ancestry. Gotti was raised in a two-story house in Howard Beach, New York, with her four siblings, which include brother John A. Gotti, sister Angel, and her younger brother Frank, whom she referred to as her &quot;little doll&quot;.

==Career==
===Writing===
Victoria Gotti was a columnist at the &quot;New York Post&quot; and a reporter for WNYW, the New York City flagship station of the Fox Television Network.

In 1995, Gotti wrote her first book, &quot;Women and Mitral Valve Prolapse&quot;, which was inspired by and documented her own struggle with the illness. In 1997, she published her mystery novel &quot;The Senator&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, followed by more: &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Watching You&quot; (1998), &quot;Superstar&quot; (2000), and &quot;Hot Italian Dish&quot; (2006). She additionally wrote the memoirs &quot;This Family of Mine: What It Was Like Growing Up Gotti&quot; (2009).

===Television===
From August 2004 until December 2005, Gotti was the star of &quot;Growing Up Gotti&quot;, an American reality television series on the A&amp;E Network, on which she starred with her three sons. In August 2005, days before the third-season premiere of &quot;Growing Up Gotti&quot;, Gotti stated that she had breast cancer. However, after being accused of faking her illness by various media outlets, she admitted soon after her initial announcement that she did have precancerous cells present in her breast, rather than an actual diagnosis.

In early 2012, Gotti appeared as one of 18 contestants on the American reality television series &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, which premiered on February 19. Gotti was eliminated in week 2 of the competition.

On September 22, 2013, Gotti made a guest appearance on &quot;The Real Housewives of New Jersey&quot; alongside cast member Teresa Giudice, appearing in the season 5 episode &quot;Hair We Go Again&quot;. She appeared on the show again in the season 6 episode &quot;Roses Are Red, Dina Is Blue&quot;, which premiered on August 24, 2014.

In December 2014, Gotti made a guest appearance in &quot;Storm A-Brewin&#x27;&quot;, a fifth-season episode of the VH1 reality show &quot;Mob Wives&quot;. Despite having criticized the authenticity of that show in a 2012 radio interview, in which she characterized it as a &quot;train wreck&quot; and &quot;not real&quot;, Gotti appeared in the episode for a scene in which cast member Angela Raiola seeks her advice on how to resolve her conflicts with her inner circle.

On February 9, 2019, Lifetime aired the documentary film &quot;Victoria Gotti: My Father&#x27;s Daughter&quot; which stars Chelsea Frei as Victoria Gotti and Maurice Benard as John Gotti. Victoria Gotti serves as the narrator, co-writer, and executive producer of this film.

==Personal life==
In 1984, Agnello married Victoria despite her parents&#x27; disapproval. The couple had three sons, Carmine, John, and Frank. The family lived in a mansion in Old Westbury, New York, which was the filming location in 2004 for the reality television series &quot;Growing Up Gotti&quot;.

In 2003, while Agnello was in jail, Victoria Gotti divorced him on grounds of constructive abandonment.

In May 2009, foreclosure was approved on the $3.2 million mansion that Gotti was awarded as part of her divorce from Carmine Agnello.

<text>Beckton is a suburb in east London, England, located east of Charing Cross and part of the London Borough of Newham. Adjacent to the River Thames, the area consisted of unpopulated marshland known as the East Ham Levels in the parishes of Barking, East Ham, West Ham and Woolwich. The development of major industrial infrastructure in the 19th century to support the growing metropolis of London caused an increase in population with housing built in the area for workers of the Beckton Gas Works and Beckton Sewage Treatment Works. The area has a convoluted local government history and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. Between 1981 and 1995 it was within the London Docklands Development Corporation area, which caused the population to increase as new homes were built and the Docklands Light Railway was constructed.

==History==
===Toponymy===
Beckton is named after Simon Adams Beck, the governor of the Gas Light and Coke Company when work building Beckton Gas Works began in November 1868. The name New Beckton was used in 1881 for the workers estate at Cyprus.

===Local government===
Prior to industrialisation, the area that became Beckton was remote and unpopulated Thameside marshland, known as the East Ham Levels. Urban development took place in the south of the parish of East Ham, the part of the parish of Barking to the west of the River Roding and the part of Woolwich parish that was north of the River Thames. The western extremity was in the parish of West Ham. There was also a county boundary, with Barking, East Ham and West Ham in Essex and Woolwich in Kent. The whole area became part of the expanded Metropolitan Police District in 1840. Reflecting an increase in population and the need for more effective local government, local boards were formed for Woolwich in 1852, West Ham in 1856, East Ham in 1878 and Barking Town in 1882. The section in the detached part of Woolwich parish came within the Metropolitan Board of Works district in 1855 and in 1889 this area became the County of London under the control of the newly formed London County Council. The Barking Town and East Ham sections now came within the Essex County Council area, but West Ham instead formed a separate county borough because its population was high enough. East Ham was also elevated to this status in 1915. This continued until 1965 when the London Borough of Newham in Greater London was formed from territory that had been part of East Ham, West Ham, Barking and Woolwich. Beckton was within the London Docklands Development Corporation area from 1981 to 1995.

===Beckton sewage works===

Beckton Sewage treatment works were first established in 1864 as part of Joseph Bazalgette&#x27;s scheme to remove sewage (and hence reduce disease) from London by creating two large sewers from the capital, one on each side of the Thames and known as the Southern and Northern Outfall Sewers. The Beckton sewage works (TQ448823), at the end of the northern outfall sewer, is Europe&#x27;s 7th largest and is now managed by Thames Water. The outfall sewer has been landscaped and now also serves as the Greenway cycle track through east London.

The site was mooted in 2005 as the location for a desalination plant, but the proposal was rejected by Mayor Ken Livingstone as environmentally unacceptable. The scheme has been resurrected by the successive mayor, Boris Johnson, as part of a deal with Thames Water to reduce delays in fixing roadworks throughout London. The sewerage works has been expanded to handle the flow from the Thames Tideway Scheme.

===Beckton gasworks===

Situated north and east of the Royal Docks, the area was formerly heavily industrialised, and was the location of Beckton Gas Works, the largest gasworks in Europe, which served the capital. An adjacent by-products works also produced a wide variety of products including ink, dyes, mothballs, and fertilisers, all by-products of the process of turning coal to coke in the production of town gas. Britain converted from town gas to North Sea natural gas over the period 1966-77 and the Beckton gasworks were closed in 1976.

An extensive toxic spoil-heap from the Gasworks was known ironically as &#x27;Beckton Alps&#x27;. Originally running from the Northern outfall sewer south to Winsor Terrace, this was landscaped in the 1980s. Part became a high Artificial ski slope for a time, opened by Diana, Princess of Wales, with a viewing platform at the summit and a Swiss-style bar at the foot. However, the site is now derelict.

===Urban development===
Beckton railway station opened in 1874 as the eastern terminus of a branch from Custom House.

Immediately after the Second World War, large numbers of prefabs were built in Beckton to house those made homeless by the war. The prefab-lined streets were all named after well-known generals and war heroes, but in the redevelopment of North Beckton in the 1980s, these were all swept away with the exception of Eisenhower Drive.

Containerisation during the 1960s, and the development of the docks at Tilbury, released all the land from the Thames up to the A13 which had been earmarked for a new, North Albert Dock. The original District Plan envisaged a large Council-owned estate, and major infrastructure works—including a huge drainage scheme with pumping stations—were put in place. However, following the creation of the London Docklands Development Corporation, much of the land was sold off resulting in today&#x27;s blend of largely private housing.

In more recent times, industry has left the area, leaving huge areas of brownfield land, and Beckton has been redeveloped as part of the Docklands project. It now comprises mainly housing and several out-of-town shopping centres, and the architecture is mostly post-1982. Small areas of Victorian housing survive in Winsor Terrace, originally built as accommodation for Gas Light and Coke Company staff, and in the &#x27;Nottingham&#x27; estate off Prince Regent Lane. It is served by local buses and Beckton DLR station, which acts as the terminus of the DLR&#x27;s Beckton branch.

Beckton absorbed the localities of Cyprus and Winsor Park, which was built in the 1870s to house gasworks employees. Several original properties survive on Winsor Terrace, with two-up-two-downs for the workers and generously proportioned end-of-terrace houses for foremen. North Beckton, bordering the northern end of Woolwich Manor Way, was mostly built up in the late 1980s with a network of short streets, even shorter cul-de-sacs and dinky homes, many built as part of social housing schemes.

In the early 21st century, Beckton burgeons south and further east, towards Gallions Reach, being an essential part of the Thames Gateway. &quot;Gallions Hotel&quot;, part of the Furlong City development by the lock that links the Royal Docks to the Thames, was formerly a rail terminus which connected with passenger ships leaving for all parts of the British Empire. Many colonial officials and their families spent their last night in Britain in the Gallions Hotel, which was mentioned by Rudyard Kipling in his novel, &quot;The Light That Failed&quot;.

In 2003, the largest Shopping Park in London, Gallions Reach was built. There are another three retail parks in the area; Beckton Triangle Retail Park, Beckton Gateway and Beckton Retail Park.


==Geography==
Its boundaries are the A13 trunk road to the north, Barking Creek to the east, the Royal Docks to the south, and Prince Regent Lane to the west. The area around Prince Regent Lane is also known as Custom House. Modern Beckton is divided into East Beckton, Mid Beckton, North Beckton, West Beckton, South Beckton and Cyprus (named after the British capture of Cyprus from the Ottoman Empire in 1878, which occurred as the original estate was being built).

Beckton is at the western end of the London Riverside redevelopment zone of the Thames Gateway. Transport for London is planning a new bridge, the Gallions Reach Crossing, which will connect Beckton to Thamesmead on the southern bank of the River Thames.

==Demographics==

Beckton is home to a significant Lithuanian community, which has led to the area being dubbed as &quot;Bektoniškės&quot; or &quot;Little Lithuania&quot;. As many as 8,000 Lithuanians are estimated to have settled in Beckton following an increase in mobility for Lithuanian nationals across the European Union in 2007.

==Culture and community==
The Gasworks were still extant—although derelict—in the early 1980s, when Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s team came scouting for an area that could double for the battle scenes in his 1987 film, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;. The Gasworks rough concrete structures were painted with Vietnamese script, and then strategically dynamited so as to resemble war-torn Huế. Retail parks now cover most of the Gasworks site.

Other notable films shot in and around the Beckton area during the 1980s included the 1981 James Bond film, &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, which featured extensive aerial views of the Gasworks in the pre-credit sequence. Beckton was also used as a location in Michael Radford&#x27;s 1984 feature film adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;—the Gasworks served as the setting for Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Proletarian Zones&quot;.

The video for Loop&#x27;s 1990 single &#x27;Arc-lite&#x27; was filmed on the set of &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, as was the video for the 1997 Oasis single, &quot;D&#x27;You Know What I Mean?&quot;

Andrew Birkin&#x27;s 1990 film of Ian McEwan&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Cement Garden&quot;, was also filmed in Beckton and starred Charlotte Gainsbourg. In several scenes of &quot;The Cement Garden&quot;, aircraft can be heard taxiing at the nearby London City Airport. Winsor House, which served as the backdrop to the film was later demolished and the Winsor House Hotel stands there now.

In the opening minutes of the 2007 Simon Pegg film &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;, the Tate &amp; Lyle factory, Silvertown, and the City Airport aprons can be seen through the window blinds of Building 1000.

Footballer Jermain Defoe was born in Beckton. Defoe has said Beckton has &quot;made him the man he is today&quot;. On 13 February 2006 Jermain Defoe scored his 100th Premier League goal against Charlton. He celebrated making a &quot;B&quot; sign with his hands to commemorate Beckton. 

On 14 May 2010 Beckton was the location of a terrorist attack on local Member of Parliament Stephen Timms. He was approached by 21-year-old Islamist Roshonara Choudhry during his constituency surgery at the Beckton Globe library and stabbed twice in an attempted assassination. Timms survived the attack and the perpetrator was jailed for life.

==Education==

The University of East London Docklands Campus is a campus of the University of East London (UEL) situated in the Docklands area of east London in the Cyprus area of Beckton. The campus opened in 1999. It is one of three UEL campuses, the others being the Stratford Campus and the new University Square Stratford location.

Kingsford Community School is a secondary school located close to Beckton DLR. It opened in September 2000, and educates full-time children from the ages of 11 to 16.

<doc id="872229" wikidata="Q7758907" url="?curid=872229" title="The Quatermass Memoirs">
<text>The Quatermass Memoirs is a British radio drama-documentary, originally broadcast in 5 episodes on BBC Radio 3 in March 1996. Written by Nigel Kneale, it was born out of his &quot;Quatermass&quot; series of films and television serials, which had first been broadcast in the 1950s. The idea for the show appeared as BBC radio intended to create a season of programming looking back at the 1950s, and it was the final piece of writing Kneale completed relating to the character.

The show is centered on the character of Professor Bernard Quatermass who, albeit older than in the previous series, is &quot;the same very concerned scientist&quot; but worried about his previous decisions. Andrew Keir, who had played Quatermass in the 1967 film &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;, was chosen to voice the character. Later, Nigel Kneale himself became dismissive of the serial, but critics gave the production relatively positive reviews.

==Overview==
The series mixes three different strands: a new monologue by Kneale in which he discusses the genesis and development of the Quatermass serials and their main character; archival material from the television productions, and from documentary and newsreel coverage of key events of the times in which they were made, such as the Cold War, the advent of nuclear weapons and the embryonic Space Race; and the dramatised strand, in which the Professor discloses his reasons for reclusion and discusses his demons with a persistent reporter who invades his hermitage (and ultimately becomes his friend). This third element is set several years after the events of the third serial, &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1958–59), and shortly before those of the fourth and final serial, &quot;Quatermass&quot; (1979). Continuity is maintained with the 1979 serial by presenting Quatermass living in seclusion in the Scottish Highlands, while the final episode reveals that the social collapse foreshadowing the events of the final story has already begun.

==Production==
Kneale had brought Quatermass&#x27;s story to a close in the 1979 serial &quot;Quatermass&quot;, and for many years saw no reason to revisit the character. However, in 1995 he was approached by BBC Radio producer Paul Quinn with an idea for creating a drama-documentary about the character as part of a season of BBC radio programming looking back at the 1950s. Quinn told &quot;Dreamwatch&quot; magazine: &quot;For many people who remember the seminal experience of hiding behind the sofa when the &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials came on the television, &quot;Quatermass&quot; was the 1950s. His adventures [...] have gone down in popular cultural history&quot;. Kneale was intrigued by the idea, and agreed to write new dramatic material of Quatermass relating his memories which Quinn could then combine with archive clips from the existing episodes of the various &quot;Quatermass&quot; television serials. Kneale saw the older Quatermass of this new serial as &quot;the same very concerned scientist who is now, in retrospect, horribly worried about what he may have done to the world through his encounters with various lifeforms that were better not contacted&quot;. It was Kneale&#x27;s first radio work since he had written the play &quot;You Must Listen&quot; for the BBC in 1952, and his first work for the BBC in any medium since the mid-1970s.

The programme was commissioned in July 1995, with the original working title of &quot;Quatermass and the Ultimate Conspiracy&quot;. When Quinn discovered that some of the soundtracks of the &quot;Quatermass&quot; episodes were considered to be of too poor a quality to use, the idea for the series was re-shaped to add the new elements of Kneale&#x27;s monologue and archive news reports. Kneale, however, later denied that any of the news stories which &quot;The Quatermass Memoirs&quot; suggested had inspired parts of his work had ever been in his mind at the time. He said that he had used a degree of creative licence when &quot;explaining&quot; these apparent inspirations in his monologue sections.

A further problem for Quinn was that none of the actors who had played Quatermass for BBC Television in the 1950s were still alive. This was solved by employing Andrew Keir, who had played Quatermass in the Hammer Film Productions version of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; in 1967, a performance which Kneale had liked. Keir was happy to take the part, but somewhat concerned about only being used as a &quot;link man&quot; and not in a fully dramatic role. The clips that were used from the original BBC episodes were all carefully edited so that the actors playing Quatermass were never heard, and thus the differences between their voices and Keir&#x27;s would not confuse the audience. Also in the cast were Emma Gregory as the journalist, Mandy, and Zulema Dene as Quatermass&#x27;s housekeeper, Maire.

The five episodes, each of approximately twenty minutes, were broadcast across one week from 4 to 8 March 1996, as part of &quot;The Fifties&quot; season of programming. The serial was promoted in listings magazine &quot;Radio Times&quot; with an article by Kneale about Quatermass and his opinion of other science fiction programmes. Episode one was transmitted at 10.32pm on the Monday (originally scheduled for 10.05pm but delayed by a live concert broadcast beforehand); episode two at 9.30pm on the Tuesday; episode three 9.00pm on Wednesday, episode four 10.15pm on Thursday and episode five at 9.40pm on the Friday. The production was made and transmitted in stereo. It was Andrew Keir&#x27;s final professional performance; he died the following year.

The digital radio station BBC7 repeated the series on several occasions from October 2003. In 2006 it was released on CD by BBC Audio as part of their &quot;Classic Radio Sci-Fi&quot; range, with cover artwork by Chris Achilleos.

==Reception==
Nigel Kneale himself was largely dismissive of the serial in the years following its broadcast: &quot;God knows it wasn&#x27;t a very important sort of thing. The BBC didn&#x27;t care tuppence about what they were doing, because they really don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing, certainly not in radio... [Andrew Keir] must have been pretty ill when this nonsense was going on&quot;.

Reviewing the first episodes of both &quot;The Quatermass Memoirs&quot; and &quot;In the Fifties&quot;—another programme running as part of &quot;The Fifties&quot; season—&quot;The Times&quot;″s reviewer Peter Barnard was impressed. Despite thinking that such a season of programming was &quot;a necessarily premature commemoration&quot;, he felt that both series had &quot;demonstrated how radio&#x27;s better moments often take conventional pegs and hang some original clothing on them&quot;.

&quot;The Independent&quot;″s radio critic Robert Hanks was unimpressed with Kneale&#x27;s script for the dramatic sections, but praised the performance of Andrew Keir in the title role: &quot;Lesser actors would treat Kneale&#x27;s downbeat script with a certain detachment, but Keir is prepared to charge even the most banal lines with a terror that&#x27;s both a treat and a lesson&quot;. Hanks also felt that &quot;The Fifties&quot; season as a whole, as demonstrated by &quot;The Quatermass Memoirs&quot;, had a somewhat misleading focus: &quot;You get the sense that a vogue for science fiction is being interpreted as the spirit of the Fifties, with emphasis being put on a handful of sci-fi films. If you really wanted to read the age through its movies, you&#x27;d have to include Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, late Ealing and early Norman Wisdom, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley. It&#x27;s a lot to accommodate; perhaps sticking to terror is just less intimidating&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Dyer&quot; (DD-84) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==
The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails.

Assigned to U.S. patrol squadrons based on Gibraltar, &quot;Dyer&quot; sailed from New York 9 July 1918 with Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Delano Roosevelt embarked for transportation to Plymouth, England. Arriving 21 July &quot;Dyer&quot; got underway 5 days later arriving Gibraltar on the 29th. On 4 August she began her service as escort for merchant convoys and Army transports between Gibraltar and Marseilles, France, making nine such voyages until the end of hostilities.

Operating from Venice as flagship for the force, &quot;Dyer&quot; took part in relief activities in the Balkans and Middle East, carried passengers and supplies in the Adriatic and aided in the execution of the terms of the Austrian Armistice until 16 April, when she sailed for the United States. &quot;Dyer&quot; arrived at New York 14 June 1919 with two Members of Congress embarked.
