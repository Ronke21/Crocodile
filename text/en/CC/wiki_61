<text>Théodore Chassériau (; ; September 20, 1819 – October 8, 1856) was a Dominican-born French Romantic painter noted for his portraits, historical and religious paintings, allegorical murals, and Orientalist images inspired by his travels to Algeria. Early in his career he painted in a Neoclassical style close to that of his teacher Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, but in his later works he was strongly influenced by the Romantic style of Eugène Delacroix. He was a prolific draftsman, and made a suite of prints to illustrate Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;. The portrait he painted at the age of 15 of Prosper Marilhat makes Chassériau the youngest painter exhibited at the Louvre museum.

==Life and work==
Chassériau was born in El Limón, Samaná, in the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo (now the Dominican Republic). His father Benoît Chassériau was a French adventurer who had arrived in Santo Domingo in 1802 to take an administrative position in what was until 1808 a French colony. Theodore&#x27;s mother, Maria Magdalena Couret de la Blagniére, was the daughter of a mulatto landowner born in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti). In December 1820 the family left Santo Domingo for Paris, where the young Chassériau soon showed precocious drawing skill. He was accepted into the studio of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres in 1830, at the age of eleven, and became the favorite pupil of the great classicist, who regarded him as his truest disciple. (An account that may be apocryphal has Ingres declaring &quot;Come, gentlemen, come see, this child will be the Napoleon of painting.&quot;)

After Ingres left Paris in 1834 to become director of the French Academy in Rome, Chassériau fell under the influence of Eugène Delacroix, whose brand of painterly colorism was anathema to Ingres. Chassériau first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1836, and was awarded a third-place medal in the category of history painting. In 1840 Chassériau travelled to Rome and met with Ingres, whose bitterness at the direction his student&#x27;s work was taking led to a decisive break. While in Italy, Chassériau made landscape sketches and studied Renaissance frescoes.


Among the chief works of his early maturity are &quot;Susanna and the Elders&quot; and &quot;Venus Anadyomene&quot; (both 1839), &quot;Diana Surprised by Actaeon&quot; (1840), &quot;Andromeda Chained to the Rock by the Nereids&quot; (1840), and &quot;The Toilette of Esther&quot; (1841), all of which reveal a very personal ideal in depicting the female nude. Chassériau&#x27;s major religious paintings from these years, &quot;Christ on the Mount of Olives&quot; (a subject he treated in 1840 and again in 1844) and &quot;The Descent from the Cross&quot; (1842), received mixed reviews from the critics; among the artist&#x27;s champions was Théophile Gautier. In 1843, Chassériau painted murals depicting the life of Saint Mary of Egypt in the Church of Saint-Merri in Paris, the first of several commissions he received to decorate public buildings in Paris.

Portraits from this period include the &quot;Portrait of the Reverend Father Dominique Lacordaire, of the Order of the Predicant Friars&quot; (1840), and &quot;The Two Sisters&quot; (1843), which depicts Chassériau&#x27;s sisters Adèle and Aline.

Throughout his life he was a prolific draftsman; his many portrait drawings executed with a finely pointed graphite pencil are close in style to those of Ingres. He also created a body of 29 prints, including a group of eighteen etchings of subjects from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; in 1844.

He exhibited the colossal portrait &quot;Ali-Ben-Hamet, Caliph of Constantine and Chief of the Haractas, Followed by his Escort&quot; in the Salon of 1845, where it received equivocal reviews. In 1846, Chassériau made his first trip to Algeria. From sketches made on this and subsequent trips he painted such subjects as &quot;Arab Chiefs Visiting Their Vassals&quot; and &quot;Jewish Women on a Balcony&quot; (both 1849, now in the Louvre). A major late work, &quot;The Tepidarium&quot; (1853, in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay), depicts a large group of women drying themselves after bathing, in an architectural setting inspired by the artist&#x27;s trip in 1840 to Pompeii. His most monumental work was his decoration of the grand staircase of the Cour des Comptes, commissioned by the state in 1844 and completed in 1848. He followed the example of Delacroix in executing this work in oil on plaster, rather than in fresco. This work was heavily damaged in May 1871 by a fire set during the Commune, and only fragments could be recovered; these are preserved in the Louvre.

After a period of ill health, exacerbated by his exhausting work on commissions for murals to decorate the Churches of Saint-Roch and Saint-Philippe-du-Roule, Chassériau died at the age of 37 in Paris, on October 8, 1856. He is buried in the Montmartre Cemetery.

==Technique and style==
Chassériau&#x27;s art has often been characterized as an attempt to reconcile the classicism of Ingres with the romanticism of Delacroix. In composing his narrative paintings, his concern for the decorative arrangement of figures and the creation of a mood took precedence over narrative coherence. His preferred method of working was to study his model carefully and then draw from memory. He favored the serpentine pose, especially for his female figures. Art historian Jonathan P. Ribner calls &quot;the inclined neck and bent knee&quot; Chassériau&#x27;s &quot;signature motif&quot; and says that &quot;his command of foreshortening and three-dimensional composition remained uneven to the end, and this limitation is reflected in the tenacity of his ... inclination toward flattened, stylized poses.&quot; According to Léon Rosenthal, Chassériau was &quot;much less concerned with bringing heroes to life or developing characters than desirous of producing subtle and infinitely rich impressions suggested to him by the themes he chooses&quot;.

==Legacy==
His work had a significant impact on the style of Puvis de Chavannes and Gustave Moreau, and—through those artists&#x27; influence—reverberations in the work of Paul Gauguin and Henri Matisse. There is in Paris a Society for the painter: &quot;Association des Amis de Théodore Chassériau&quot;.

Works of Chassériau are in the Musée du Louvre where a room is dedicated to him, in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, and in the Musée de Versailles. Collections in the United States holding works by Théodore Chassériau include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University, the National Gallery of Art of Washington, D.C., the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Museum of the Art Rhode Island School of Design, The J. Paul Getty Museum and the Art Institute of Chicago.

<text>John Queen (February 11, 1882 – July 15, 1946) was a labour activist and Manitoba politician who was a leader of the Winnipeg General Strike, for which he served a year in prison.

He was a Labour city councillor in Winnipeg from 1916 to 1921; MLA for Winnipeg from 1920 to 1941; and the mayor of Winnipeg from 1935–1936 and 1938–1942. He was also the parliamentary leader of Manitoba&#x27;s Independent Labour Party from 1923 to 1935.

==Background==
Queen was born at Lanarkshire, Scotland in 1882, the son of John Queen and Jane Todd, both natives of Scotland. A cooper by trade, he arrived in Canada in 1906 with his younger brother William, moving into a rooming house at 259 Dorothy St., a stone&#x27;s throw from the massive Canadian Pacific Railway yards where many working-class Scottish and English immigrants were then employed. He operated a horse-drawn delivery wagon for a laundry. On June 25, 1908, Queen married Katherine Ross, who had herself emigrated from Scotland in 1907.

By 1911 the family, which by then included a son John and a daughter Gloria (later Gloria Queen-Hughes, a prominent feminist and mayoral candidate), were living in the working-class neighbourhood of Weston.

==Political activism==
Queen soon became involved in the radical politics of Winnipeg. He joined the Social Democratic Party of Canada in 1908, as the group was breaking away from the more doctrinaire Socialist Party of Canada. Queen&#x27;s own variety of socialism was undogmatic, and was strongly influenced by the reform liberalism of John Stuart Mill.

== Elected political career ==

===City council===
Queen was elected to the Winnipeg City Council in 1916. He served on this body representing Ward Five until 1921. In this capacity, he argued for a more progressive tax system, and defended the rights of returning soldiers. He intended to run for federal office in 1917 but stood aside in the interest of labour unity.

Queen was a leading figure in the Winnipeg General Strike, and received a one-year jail sentence for &quot;seditious conspiracy&quot; in 1920. This did not hurt his popularity among the city&#x27;s workers, and he was elected by Winnipeg voters to the Manitoba Legislature in 1920 and as mayor later.

===Elected to provincial legislature===
In June 1920, while still serving his prison term, he was elected to the Manitoba Legislature in the ten-member district of Winnipeg. After taking his seat in 1921, he supported a motion to allow &quot;peaceful picketing&quot; within the province; this motion was defeated.

The SDPC ceased to exist in 1920. Queen was re-elected in 1922 as an &quot;Independent Workers&quot; candidate. 

He then joined the Independent Labour Party. When Fred Dixon resigned in 1923, Queen became the ILP&#x27;s parliamentary leader.

Canada&#x27;s labour movement experienced several setbacks in the late 1920s, and the ILP was not an especially strong electoral force during Queen&#x27;s time as leader. Only three party members were elected in 1927, all from Winnipeg—Queen, William Ivens and Seymour Farmer. 

The party fared slightly better in 1932, winning four seats in Winnipeg (electing Ivens, Farmer, Hyman and Queen) and electing Harold Lawrence in St. Boniface who beat out veteran Conservative MLA Joseph Bernier. 

The party made little headway beyond urban areas, however, and remained a relatively small opposition group to the Progressive government of John Bracken.

===Mayor===
After failed attempts in 1932 and 1933, Queen was elected mayor of Winnipeg in 1934 (defeating John McKerchar, the candidate of the city&#x27;s business interests). Queen again pushed for progressive taxation, and spoke out against a proposed tax reduction for various businesses within the city. As mayor, he passed a tax reform bill that provided for a significant increase in the city&#x27;s revenues.

Queen served as mayor from 1935 to 1936, and again from 1937 to 1942. He did not endorse many explicitly socialist policies during his period in office, instead he favoured a general programme of civic improvement. Queen&#x27;s housing reforms were upheld as a model for the rest of the nation. He held leading positions in the Canadian Federation of Mayors and Municipalities.

===Later political career===
Queen continued to serve in the provincial legislature during his tenure as mayor, though he turned over the leadership of the party to Seymour Farmer in 1935. 

Along with the rest of the ILP caucus, he became affiliated with the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation in 1933. His defeat in the provincial election of 1941 seems to have been unexpected.

Queen was also defeated when he ran for re-election as Winnipeg&#x27;s mayor in 1942, He lost another bid in 1944. Opposition from Winnipeg&#x27;s Communists was undoubtedly a contributing factor in both cases.

He died at home in Winnipeg on July 15, 1946.

<doc id="861799" wikidata="Q3181800" url="?curid=861799" title="John Stanley (KG)">
<text>Sir John Stanley, KG (–1414) of Lathom, near Ormskirk in Lancashire, was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and titular King of Mann, the first of that name. He married a potential heiress, Isabel Lathom, and several unexpected deaths soon made her very wealthy. This marriage, combined with his own abilities, allowed him to rise above the usual status of a younger son.

==Origins==
He was the second son of Sir William Stanley of Stourton,) by his wife Alice Massey of Timperley, Cheshire. Sir William Stanley was Master-Forester of the Forest of Wirral and was notorious for his repressive activities.

==Marriage and children==

In 1385 he married Isabel Lathom, daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas Lathom of Lathom in Lancashire, a great landowner in south-west Lancashire. The marriage took place despite the opposition of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster and gave Stanley great wealth he could never have hoped for as the younger son. By his wife, he had four sons and two daughters, including:
*Sir John Stanley (died 1437), eldest son and heir;
*Henry Stanley;
*Thomas Stanley;
*Ralph Stanley

==Crest of Lathom==

The heraldic crest of Lathom (&quot;An eagle wings extended or preying on a child proper swaddled gules in a cradle laced or&quot;) was adopted by Sir John Stanley and his descendants. An ancient myth (&quot;the Stanley Legend&quot;), of several varieties, is attached to the image depicted, one given by (died circa 1568), Bishop of Sodor and Man being that the &quot;Lord of Lathom&quot; was issueless and aged &quot;fowerscore&quot; adopted an infant &quot;swaddled and clad in a mantle of redd,&quot; which an eagle brought unhurt to her nest in Terlestowe wood, and which he named Oskell, and made heir of Lathom, where he became the father of Isabel Stanley, stolen away in the first instance by her knight, and afterwards forgiven by Sir Oskell&quot;.
 The Stanley crest is today memorialised in the name of several English public houses displaying the sign of &quot;The Eagle and Child&quot;, often situated within manors once held by the Stanley family.

==Career==
===Declared an outlaw===
Both John Stanley and his elder brother, William Stanley (who succeeded their father as Master-Forester), were involved in criminal cases which charged them with a forced entry in 1369 and with the murder of Thomas Clotton in 1376. Conviction for the murder of Clotton resulted in Stanley being declared an outlaw. However, he was already distinguishing himself in military service in the French wars, and he was pardoned in 1378 at the insistence of his commander, Sir Thomas Trivet.

===Justiciar of Ireland===
The year 1386 saw his first appointment in Ireland as deputy to Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland. This occurred because of the insurrection created by the friction between Sir Philip Courtenay, the English Lieutenant of Ireland, and his appointed governor James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond. Stanley led an expedition to Ireland on behalf of de Vere and King Richard II to quell it. He was accompanied by Bishop Alexander de Balscot of Meath and Sir Robert Crull. Butler joined them upon their arrival in Ireland. Because of the success of the expedition, Stanley was appointed to the position of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Alexander to Chancellor, Crull to Treasurer, and Butler to his old position as Governor. In 1389 Richard II appointed him Justiciar of Ireland, a post he held until 1391. He was heavily involved in Richard&#x27;s first expedition to Ireland in 1394–1395.

Throughout the 1390s he was involved in placating possible rebellion in Cheshire. Between 1396 and 1398 he served as Captain of Roxburgh Castle. He took part in Richard II&#x27;s expedition to Ireland in 1399. However, on his return to England, Stanley, who had long proved adept at political manoeuvring, turned his back on Richard and submitted to King Henry IV, the first of the House of Lancaster.

===Under the Lancastrians===
Stanley&#x27;s fortunes were equally good under the Lancastrians. He was granted lordships in the Welsh Marches, and served a term as Lieutenant of Ireland. In 1403 he was made Steward of the Household of Henry, Prince of Wales, (later Henry V). Unlike many of the Cheshire gentry, he took the side of the king in the rebellion of the Percys. He was wounded in the throat at the Battle of Shrewsbury.

In 1405 he was granted the tenure of the Isle of Man, which had been confiscated from the rebellious Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland. In this period he also became Steward of the Household to King Henry IV, and was appointed by him a Knight of the Garter. In 1413 King Henry V of England sent him to serve once more as Lieutenant of Ireland. He summoned the Parliament, which met in Dublin in November 1413.

==Death and burial==
In 1414 he died at Ardee, County Louth, Ireland, after being satirised by the O&#x27;Higgins&#x27; of Meath for despoiling the lands and raiding the cows of Niall O&#x27;Higgins. He lasted but five weeks, according to the Four Masters, before succumbing &quot;to the virulence of the lampoons&quot;. His body was returned to his home at Lathom and was buried at Burscough Priory near Ormskirk, about 3 miles south-west of Lathom. This was deemed in some quarters the second such &quot;Poet&#x27;s Miracle&quot; performed by the O&#x27;Higgins.

==Offices==
During his career Stanley held the following offices:-
* Lord Lieutenant of Ireland between 1386 and 1388.
* Justiciar of Ireland between 1389 and 1391.
* Justice of Chester in 1394
* Controller of the Royal Household in 1399
* Lieutenant of Ireland between 1399 and 1401
* Steward of the Household to the Prince of Wales circa 1403, later King Henry V
* Surveyor of the Forests of Macclesfield, Mare and Mondrem, Cheshire in 1403
* Governor of the City and County of Cheshire in 1403
* He was invested as a Knight, Order of the Garter (K.G.) circa 1405
* Steward of Macclesfield in 1406

He was granted the Isle, Castle, Peel and Lordship of Mann, by King Henry IV of England
* Sovereign Lord of the Isle of Man in 1406
* Constable of Windsor Castle in 1409
* Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (second term) from 1413 until his death in 1414.

==Poet==
It has been suggested that Stanley was the as-yet unidentified &quot;Gawain Poet&quot;. The Garter motto &quot;Honi soit qui mal y pense&quot; appears at the end of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, and the poet exhibits a detailed knowledge of both hunting and armour. Scholars identify the poet&#x27;s dialect as that of north-west Staffordshire or south-east Cheshire.

<text>Gregor Fisher (born 22 December 1953) is a Scottish comedian and actor. He is best known for his portrayal of the title character in the comedy series &quot;Rab C. Nesbitt&quot;, a role he has played since the show&#x27;s first episode in 1988. He has also had roles in films such as &quot;Without a Clue&quot; (1988), &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003), &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (2004) and &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot; (2016).

==Early life==
Fisher was born in Menstrie, Clackmannanshire, and following the death of his mother was brought up in Edinburgh, Langholm, and Neilston and attended Barrhead High School. He attended the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow.

==Career==
===Early work===
Fisher worked with Scottish comedian Rikki Fulton on his hit sketch series &quot;Scotch and Wry&quot; (whose broadcast was mainly restricted to BBC One Scotland). Another Scottish comedian he worked with was Hector Nicol, in the BBC drama &quot;Just a Boys&#x27; Game&quot; (1979).

Later, he appeared in Michael Radford&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; as Winston Smith&#x27;s neighbour Parsons. In 1988, he had a leading role in &quot;Silent Mouse&quot;, a dramatised television documentary telling the story of the creation of the Christmas carol &quot;Silent Night&quot;. In the same year he had a cameo (as a Victorian policeman) in the Michael Caine/Ben Kingsley vehicle, &quot;Without a Clue&quot;.

===&quot;Rab C. Nesbitt&quot;===

Fisher is best known for his portrayal of the main character of the sitcom &quot;Rab C. Nesbitt&quot;, this itself was a spin-off from the BBC2 sketch comedy &quot;Naked Video&quot;, where the Nesbitt character originated, along with &quot;The Baldy Man&quot; who also obtained his own eponymous spin-off series, and is particularly associated with two Hamlet adverts involving photography, the first where he cannot get a satisfactory passport photo from a photobooth and lights up a cigar to calm himself down; the second where he cannot get a satisfactory family portrait and lights up a cigar to calm himself down. Johnny Depp based his Glaswegian accent for the role of Tarrant Hightopp, the Mad Hatter in the 2010 film &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, on that used by Fisher’s Rab C. Nesbitt character.

In 1994–1995, he played the title role in the BBC series &quot;The Tales of Para Handy&quot;, in which he was reunited with Rikki Fulton. Fisher had also appeared in the 1999 sitcom &quot;Brotherly Love&quot; and in the 2002 sitcom &quot;Snoddy&quot;. He also appeared with Iain Glenn in the BBC Masterpiece theatre version of &quot;Kidnapped&quot;.

===&quot;Love Actually&quot;===

Fisher appeared in the 2000 BBC adaptation of &quot;Gormenghast&quot;. Fisher starred as a main character D.S. Doug Duvall in the drama &quot;Missing&quot;, made by SMG Productions in 2006, the two-part thriller was not broadcast on STV until November 2008. In November 2006, he starred as Grandpa Potts in &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, in a three-month run of the show in Edinburgh. Most recently he has starred in the BBC&#x27;s adaption of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, in the role of Mr Bumble.

In 2003, he appeared in the romantic comedy film &quot;Love Actually&quot;, where he played the role of the manager to fading music star, Billy Mack (Bill Nighy). In 2004, he played the role of Solanio in the Michael Radford film, &quot;The Merchant of Venice.&quot; In an interview in &quot;The Metro&quot; on 20 February 2008 he stated that he is no longer recognised as Rab C. Nesbitt, and rather is more likely to be stopped by fans for his recent role as Mr Bumble in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. &quot;Empty&quot;, a comedy series starring Fisher, began on BBC2 on 28 February 2008. 

===&quot;Rab C. Nesbitt&quot; renewal===

On BBC2, on 23 December 2008, he reprised his role as Rab C Nesbitt in a Christmas special. Fisher&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Boy from Nowhere&quot;, was published in 2015. To coincide with the publication, BBC One Scotland broadcast a documentary, &quot;In Search of Gregor Fisher&quot;, which followed Fisher and ghostwriter Melanie Reid during part of their research for the book.

<doc id="861802" wikidata="Q1541975" url="?curid=861802" title="Multiple system atrophy">
<text>Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tremors, slow movement, muscle rigidity, postural instability (collectively known as parkinsonism), autonomic dysfunction and ataxia. This is caused by progressive degeneration of neurons in several parts of the brain including the basal ganglia, inferior olivary nucleus, and cerebellum. MSA was first described in 1960 by Milton Shy and Glen Drager and was then known as Shy–Drager syndrome.

Many people affected by MSA experience dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, which commonly manifests as orthostatic hypotension, impotence, loss of sweating, dry mouth and urinary retention and incontinence. Palsy of the vocal cords is an important and sometimes initial clinical manifestation of the disorder.

A prion of the alpha-synuclein protein within affected neurons may cause MSA. About 55% of MSA cases occur in men, with those affected first showing symptoms at the age of 50–60 years. MSA often presents with some of the same symptoms as Parkinson&#x27;s disease. However, those with MSA generally show little response to the dopamine agonists used to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease and only about 9% of MSA patients with tremor exhibit a true parkinsonian pill-rolling tremor.

MSA is distinct from multisystem proteinopathy, a more common muscle-wasting syndrome. MSA is also different from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, sometimes referred to as multiple organ failure, and from multiple organ system failures, an often-fatal complication of septic shock and other severe illnesses or injuries.

==Signs and symptoms==
MSA is characterized by the following: Autonomic and at least one Motor (clinically established MSA criteria 2022)
* autonomic dysfunction: Post-void urinary residual volume ≥100 mL (usually by ultrasound); Unexplained urinary urge incontinence; or Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (≥20/10 mmHg blood pressure drop) within 3 minutes (usually by head‐up tilt) 
* parkinsonism (muscle rigidity +/ tremor and slow movement: MSA-P)
* cerebellar ataxia (Poor coordination/unsteady walking: MSA-C)

A variant with combined features of MSA and dementia with Lewy bodies may also exist. There have also been occasional instances of frontotemporal lobar degeneration associated with MSA.

===Initial presentation===
The most common first sign of MSA is the appearance of an &quot;akinetic-rigid syndrome&quot; (i.e. slowness of initiation of movement resembling Parkinson&#x27;s disease) found in 62% at first presentation. Other common signs at onset include problems with balance (cerebellar ataxia) found in 22% at first presentation, followed by genito-urinary symptoms (9%): both men and women often experience urgency, frequency, incomplete bladder emptying, or an inability to pass urine (retention). About 1 in 5 MSA patients experience a fall in their first year of disease.

For men, the first sign can be erectile dysfunction. Women have also reported reduced genital sensitivity.

===Progression===
As the disease progresses, one of three groups of symptoms predominates.
These are:
# Parkinsonism - slow, stiff movement, writing becomes small and spidery
# Cerebellar dysfunction - difficulty coordinating movement and balance
# Autonomic nervous system dysfunction - impaired automatic body functions, including one, some, or all of the following:
::* postural or orthostatic hypotension, resulting in dizziness or fainting upon standing up
::* urinary incontinence or urinary retention
::* impotence
::* constipation
::* vocal cord paralysis
::* dry mouth and skin
::* trouble regulating body temperature due to sweating deficiency in all parts of the body
::* loud snoring, abnormal breathing or inspiratory stridor during sleep
::* other sleep disorders including sleep apnea, REM behavior disorder
::* double vision
::*muscle twitches
::* Cognitive impairment

==Genetics==
One study found a correlation between the deletion of genes in a specific genetic region and the development of MSA in a group of Japanese patients. The region in question includes the SHC2 gene which, in mice and rats, appears to have some function in the nervous system. The authors of this study hypothesized that there may be a link between the deletion of the SHC2 and the development of MSA.

A follow-up study was unable to replicate this finding in American MSA patients. The authors of the study concluded that &quot;Our results indicate that SHC2 gene deletions underlie few, if any, cases of well-characterized MSA in the US population. This is in contrast to the Japanese experience reported by Sasaki et al., likely reflecting heterogeneity of the disease in different genetic backgrounds.&quot;

Another study investigated the frequency of RFC1 intronic repeat expansions, a phenomenon implicated in CANVAS; a disease with a diagnostic overlap with MSA. The study concluded that these repeats were absent in pathologically confirmed MSA, suggesting an alternative genetic cause.

==Pathophysiology==

Multiple system atrophy can be explained as cell loss and gliosis or a proliferation of astrocytes in damaged areas of the central nervous system. This damage forms a scar which is then termed a glial scar. The presence of inclusion bodies known as Papp–Lantos bodies, in the movement, balance, and autonomic-control centres of the brain are the defining histopathologic hallmark of MSA.

The major filamentous component of Papp-Lantos bodies, glial and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, is alpha-synuclein. Mutations in this substance may play a role in the disease. The conformation of the alpha-synuclein is different from that of alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies. The disease probably starts with an oligodendrogliopathy. It has been proposed that the α-synuclein inclusions found in Oligodendrocytes result from the pruning and the engulfment of diseased axonal segments containing aggregated α-synuclein, i.e., of Lewy neurites 

Tau proteins have been found in some glial cytoplasmic inclusion bodies.

==Diagnosis==

=== Clinical ===
Clinical diagnostic criteria were defined in 1998 and updated in 2007 and in 2022. Certain signs and symptoms of MSA also occur with other disorders, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, making the diagnosis more difficult.

Features characteristic of OPCA include progressive cerebellar ataxia, leading to clumsiness in body movements, veering from midline when walking, wide-based stance, and falls without signs of paralysis or weakness. Clinical presentation can vary greatly between patients, but mostly affects speech, balance and walking. Other possible neurological problems include spasmodic dysphonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, rigidity, dysarthria, dysphagia and neck dystonic posture. Diagnosis may be based on a thorough medical exam; the presence of signs and symptoms; imaging studies; various laboratory tests; and an evaluation of the family history.

=== Radiologic ===
Both MRI and CT scanning may show a decrease in the size of the cerebellum and pons in those with cerebellar features (MSA-C). The putamen is hypointense on T2-weighted MRI and may show an increased deposition of iron in the Parkinsonian (MSA-P) form. In MSA-C, a &quot;hot cross bun&quot; sign is sometimes found; it reflects atrophy of the pontocerebellar tracts that give T2 hyper intense signal intensity in the atrophic pons.

MRI changes are not required to diagnose the disease as these features are often absent, especially early in the course of the disease. Additionally, the changes can be quite subtle and are usually missed by examiners who are not experienced with MSA.

=== Pathologic ===
Pathological diagnosis can only be made at autopsy by finding abundant glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) on histological specimens of the central nervous system.

&quot;Olivopontocerebellar atrophy&quot; can be used as a pathological term to describe degeneration of neurons in specific areas of the brain – the cerebellum, pons, and inferior olivary nucleus. OPCA is present in several neurodegenerative syndromes, including inherited and non-inherited forms of ataxia (such as the hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia known as Machado–Joseph disease) and MSA, with which it is primarily associated.

Contrary to most other synucleinopathies, which develop α-synuclein inclusions primarily in neuronal cell populations, MSA presents with extensive pathological α-synuclein inclusions in the cytosol of oligodendrocytes (glial cytoplasmic inclusions), with limited pathology in neurons. MSA also differs from other synucleinopathies in its regional pathological presentation, with α-synuclein positive inclusions detected predominantly in the striatum, midbrain, pons, medulla and cerebellum, rather than the brainstem, limbic and cortical regions typically effected in Lewy inclusion diseases. However, recent studies using novel, monoclonal antibodies specific for C-terminally truncated α-synuclein (αSynΔC) have now shown that neuronal α-synuclein pathology is more abundant than previously thought. One group revealed robust α-synuclein pathology in the pontine nuclei and medullary inferior olivary nucleus upon histological analysis of neurological tissue from MSA patients.
Histopathological investigation on six cases of pathologically confirmed MSA, using antibodies directed at a variety of α-synuclein epitopes, revealed substantial variation in α-synuclein protein deposition across both cases and brain regions within cases, providing evidence for &#x27;strains&#x27; of aggregated conformers that may differentially promote pathological prion-like spread.

In 2020, researchers at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston concluded that protein misfolding cyclic amplification could be used to distinguish between two progressive neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson&#x27;s disease and multiple system atrophy, being the first process to give an objective diagnosis of Multiple System Atrophy instead of just a differential diagnosis.

===Classification===
MSA is one of several neurodegenerative diseases known as synucleinopathies: they have in common an abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein protein in various parts of the brain. Other synucleinopathies include Parkinson&#x27;s disease, the Lewy body dementias, and other more rare conditions.

====Old terminology====

Historically, many terms were used to refer to this disorder, based on the predominant systems presented. These terms were discontinued by consensus in 1996 and replaced with MSA and its subtypes, but awareness of these older terms and their definitions is helpful to understanding the relevant literature prior to 1996. These include striatonigral degeneration (SND), olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA), and Shy–Drager syndrome. A table describing the characteristics and modern names of these conditions follows:

The term &quot;olivopontocerebellar atrophy&quot; was originally coined by Joseph Jules Dejerine and André Thomas. It was subdivided as:
Non-hereditary diseases formerly categorized as olivopontocerebellar atrophy have were reclassified as forms of MSA as well as to four hereditary types, that have been currently reclassified as four different forms of spinocerebellar ataxia:
====Current terminology====
The current terminology and diagnostic criteria for the disease were established at a 2007 conference of experts and set forth in a position paper. This Second Consensus Statement defines two categories of MSA, based on the predominant symptoms of the disease at the time of evaluation. These are:
* MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) - defined as MSA where extrapyramidal features predominate. It is sometimes termed striatonigral degeneration, a parkinsonian variant.
* MSA with cerebellar features (MSA-C) - defined as MSA in which cerebellar ataxia predominates. It is sometimes termed sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy.

==Management==

===Supervision===
Ongoing care from a neurologist specializing in movement disorders is recommended, because the complex symptoms of MSA are often not familiar to less-specialized neurologists. Hospice/homecare services can be very useful as disability progresses.

===Drug therapy===

Levodopa (L-Dopa), a drug used in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, improves parkinsonian symptoms in a small percentage of MSA patients. A recent trial reported that only 1.5% of MSA patients experienced any improvement at all when taking levodopa, their improvement was less than 50%, and even that improvement was a transient effect lasting less than one year. Poor response to L-Dopa has been suggested as a possible element in the differential diagnosis of MSA from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

The drug riluzole is ineffective in treating MSA or PSP.

===Rehabilitation===
Management by rehabilitation professionals including physiatrists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and others for difficulties with walking/movement, daily tasks, and speech problems is essential.

Physiotherapists can help to maintain the patient&#x27;s mobility and will help to prevent contractures. Instructing patients in gait training will help to improve their mobility and decrease their risk of falls. A physiotherapist may also prescribe mobility aids such as a cane or a walker to increase the patient&#x27;s safety.

Speech therapists may assist in assessing, treating and supporting speech (dysarthria) and swallowing difficulties (dysphagia). Speech changes mean that alternative communication may be needed, for example, communication aids or word charts.

Early intervention of swallowing difficulties is particularly useful to allow for discussion around tube feeding further in the disease progression. At some point in the progression of the disease, fluid and food modification may be implemented.

===Avoidance of postural hypotension===
One particularly serious problem, the drop in blood pressure upon standing up (with risk of fainting and thus injury from falling), often responds to fludrocortisone, a synthetic mineralocorticoid. Another common drug treatment is the alpha-agonist midodrine.

Non-drug treatments include &quot;head-up tilt&quot; (elevating the head of the whole bed by about 10 degrees), salt tablets or increasing salt in the diet, generous intake of fluids, and pressure (elastic) stockings. Avoidance of triggers of low blood pressure, such as hot weather, alcohol, and dehydration, are crucial. The patient can be taught to move and transfer from sitting to standing slowly to decrease risk of falls and limit the effect of postural hypotension. Instruction in ankle pumping helps to return blood in the legs to the systemic circulation. Other preventative measures are raising the head of the bed by 8 in (20.3 cm), and the use of compression stockings and abdominal binders.

====Supine hypertension====

In addition to orthostatic hypotension, supine hypertension, where the BP is excessively high lying down, is a frequent problem in multiple system atrophy. Treatment of one symptom can easily aggravate the other, and supine hypertension in such patients has been linked to the same cardiovascular complications as essential hypertension.

===Support===
Social workers and occupational therapists can also help with coping with disability through the provision of equipment and home adaptations, services for caregivers and access to healthcare services, both for the person with MSA as well as family caregivers.

==Prognosis==
The average lifespan after the onset of symptoms in patients with MSA is 6–10 years. Approximately 60% of patients require a wheelchair within five years of onset of the motor symptoms, and few patients survive beyond 12 years. The disease progresses without remission at a variable rate. Those who present at an older age, those with parkinsonian features, and those with severe autonomic dysfunction have a poorer prognosis. Those with predominantly cerebellar features and those who display autonomic dysfunction later have a better prognosis.

===Causes of death===
The most common causes of death are sudden death and death caused by infections, which include urinary catheterization infections, feeding tube infections, and aspiration pneumonia. Some deaths are caused by cachexia, also known as wasting syndrome.

==Epidemiology==
Multiple system atrophy is estimated to affect approximately 5 per 100,000 people. At autopsy, many patients diagnosed during life with Parkinson&#x27;s disease are found actually to have MSA, suggesting that the actual incidence of MSA is higher than that estimate. While some suggest that MSA affects slightly more men than women (1.3:1), others suggest that the two sexes are equally likely to be affected. The condition most commonly presents in persons aged 50–60.

==Research==
Mesenchymal stem cell therapy may delay the progression of neurological deficits in patients with MSA-cerebellar type.

<text>Southern Democrats are members of the U.S. Democratic Party who reside in the Southern United States.

Before the American Civil War, Southern Democrats were mostly whites living in the South who believed in Jacksonian democracy. In the 19th century, they defended slavery in the United States and promoted its expansion into the Western United States against the Free Soil opposition in the Northern United States. The United States presidential election of 1860 formalized the split in the Democratic Party and brought about the American Civil War. After the Reconstruction Era ended in the late 1870s, so-called redeemers were Southern Democrats who controlled all the southern states and disenfranchised African-Americans.

The monopoly that the Democratic Party held over most of the South showed signs of breaking apart in 1948, when many white Southern Democrats—upset by the policies of desegregation enacted during the administration of Democratic President Harry Truman—created the States Rights Democratic Party. This new party, commonly referred to as the &quot;Dixiecrats&quot;, nominated South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond for president. The new party collapsed after Truman won the 1948 United States presidential election.

Despite being a Southern Democrat himself, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. These actions led to heavy opposition from Southern Democrats. Many scholars have stated that southern whites shifted to the Republican Party after a civil rights culture change and accepted social conservatism.

Republicans first dominated presidential elections in the South, then won a majority of Southern gubernatorial and congressional elections after the 1994 Republican Revolution. By the 21st century, and especially after the 2010 midterm elections, the Republican Party had gained a solid advantage over the Democratic Party in most southern states. Southern Democrats of the 21st century tend to be more progressive than their predecessors.

==History==
===1828–1861===

The title of &quot;Democrat&quot; has its beginnings in the South, going back to the founding of the Democratic-Republican Party in 1793 by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. It held to small government principles and distrusted the national government. Foreign policy was a major issue. After being the dominant party in U.S. politics from 1801 to 1829, the Democratic-Republicans split into two factions by 1828: the federalist National Republicans (who became the Whigs), and the Democrats. The Democrats and Whigs were evenly balanced in the 1830s and 1840s. However, by the 1850s, the Whigs disintegrated. Other opposition parties emerged but the Democrats were dominant. Northern Democrats were in serious opposition to Southern Democrats on the issue of slavery; Northern Democrats, led by Stephen Douglas, believed in Popular Sovereignty—letting the people of the territories vote on slavery. The Southern Democrats, reflecting the views of the late John C. Calhoun, insisted slavery was national.

The Democrats controlled the national government from 1853 until 1861, and presidents Pierce and Buchanan were friendly to Southern interests. In the North, the newly formed anti-slavery Republican Party came to power and dominated the electoral college. In the 1860 presidential election, the Republicans nominated Abraham Lincoln, but the divide among Democrats led to the nomination of two candidates: John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky represented Southern Democrats, and Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois represented Northern Democrats. Nevertheless, the Republicans had a majority of the electoral vote regardless of how the opposition split or joined and Abraham Lincoln was elected.

===1861–1933===

After the election of Abraham Lincoln, Southern Democrats led the charge to secede from the Union and establish the Confederate States. The United States Congress was dominated by Republicans; a notable exception was Democrat Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, the only senator from a state in rebellion to reject secession. The Border States or Border South of Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri of the Upper South were torn by political turmoil. Kentucky and Missouri were both governed by pro-secessionist Southern Democratic Governors who vehemently rejected Lincoln&#x27;s call for 75,000 troops. Kentucky and Missouri both held secession conventions, but neither officially declared secession, leading to split Unionist and Confederate state governments in both states. Southern Democrats in Maryland faced a Unionist Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks and the Union Army. Armed with the suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and Union troops, Governor Hicks was able to stop Maryland&#x27;s secession movement. Maryland was the only state south of the Mason–Dixon line whose governor affirmed Lincoln&#x27;s call for 75,000 troops.

After secession, the Democratic vote in the North split between the War Democrats and the Peace Democrats or &quot;Copperheads&quot;. The War Democrats voted for Lincoln in the 1864 election, and Lincoln had a War Democrat — Andrew Johnson — on his ticket. In the South, during Reconstruction the White Republican element, called &quot;Scalawags&quot; became smaller and smaller as more and more joined the Democrats. In the North, most War Democrats returned to the Democrats, and when the &quot;Panic of 1873&quot; hit, the Republican Party was blamed and the Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in 1875. The Democrats emphasized that since Jefferson and Jackson they had been the party of states rights, which added to their appeal in the White South.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the Democrats, led by the dominant Southern wing, had a strong representation in Congress. They won both houses in 1912 and elected Woodrow Wilson, a New Jersey academic with deep Southern roots and a strong base among the Southern middle class. The Republican Party regained Congress in 1919. Southern Democrats held powerful positions in Congress during the Wilson Administration, with one study noting “Though comprising only about half of the Democratic senators and slightly over two-fifths of the Democratic representatives, the southerners made up a large majority of the party’s senior members in the two houses. They exerted great weight in the two Democratic caucuses and headed almost all of the important congressional committees.”

From 1896 to 1912 and 1921 to 1931, the Democrats were relegated to second place status in national politics and didn&#x27;t control a single branch of the federal government despite universal dominance in most of the &quot;Solid South.&quot; In 1928 several Southern states dallied with voting Republican in supporting Herbert Hoover over the Roman Catholic Al Smith, but the behavior was short lived as the Stock Market Crash of 1929 returned Republicans to disfavor throughout the South. Nationally, Republicans lost Congress in January 1931 and the White House in March 1933 by huge margins. By this time, too, the Democratic Party leadership began to change its tone somewhat on racial politics. With the Great Depression gripping the nation, and with the lives of most Americans disrupted, the assisting of African-Americans in American society was seen as necessary by the new government.

===1933–1981===
During the 1930s, as the New Deal began to move Democrats as a whole to the left in economic policy, Southern Democrats were mostly supportive, although by the late 1930s there was a growing conservative faction. Both factions supported Roosevelt&#x27;s foreign policies. By 1948 the protection of segregation led Democrats in the Deep South to reject Truman and run a third party ticket of Dixiecrats in the 1948 United States presidential election. After 1964, Southern Democrats lost major battles during the Civil Rights Movement. Federal laws ended segregation and restrictions on black voters.

During the Civil Rights Movement, Democrats in the South initially still voted loyally with their party. After the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the old argument that all Whites had to stick together to prevent civil rights legislation lost its force because the legislation had now been passed. More and more Whites began to vote Republican, especially in the suburbs and growing cities. Newcomers from the North were mostly Republican; they were now joined by conservatives and wealthy Southern Whites, while liberal Whites and poor Whites, especially in rural areas, remained with the Democratic Party.

The New Deal program of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) generally united the party factions for over three decades, since Southerners, like Northern urban populations, were hit particularly hard and generally benefited from the massive governmental relief program. FDR was adept at holding White Southerners in the coalition while simultaneously beginning the erosion of Black voters away from their then-characteristic Republican preferences. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s catalyzed the end of this Democratic Party coalition of interests by magnetizing Black voters to the Democratic label and simultaneously ending White supremacist control of the Democratic Party apparatus. A series of court decisions, rendering primary elections as public instead of private events administered by the parties, essentially freed the Southern region to change more toward the two-party behavior of most of the rest of the nation.

In the presidential elections of 1952 and 1956 Republican nominee Dwight D. Eisenhower, a popular World War II general, won several Southern states, thus breaking some White Southerners away from their Democratic Party pattern. The senior position of Southern Congressmen and Senators, and the discipline of many groups such as the Southern Caucus meant that Civil Rights initiatives tended to be blunted despite popular support.

The passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a significant event in converting the Deep South to the Republican Party; in that year most Senatorial Republicans supported the Act (most of the opposition came from Southern Democrats). From the end of the Civil War to 1961 Democrats had solid control over the southern states on the national level, hence the term &quot;Solid South&quot; to describe the states&#x27; Democratic preference. After the passage of this Act, however, their willingness to support Republicans on a national level increased demonstrably. In 1964, Republican presidential nominee Goldwater, who had voted against the Civil Rights Act, won many of the &quot;Solid South&quot; states over Democratic presidential nominee Lyndon B. Johnson, himself a Texan, and with many this Republican support continued and seeped down the ballot to congressional, state, and ultimately local levels. A further significant item of legislation was the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which targeted for preclearance by the U.S. Department of Justice any election-law change in areas where African-American voting participation was lower than the norm (most but not all of these areas were in the South); the effect of the Voting Rights Act on southern elections was profound, including the by-product that some White Southerners perceived it as meddling while Black voters universally appreciated it. Nixon aide Kevin Phillips told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1970 that &quot;Negrophobe&quot; Whites would quit the Democrats if Republicans enforced the Voting Rights Act and blacks registered as Democrats. The trend toward acceptance of Republican identification among Southern White voters was bolstered in the next two elections by Richard Nixon.

Denouncing the forced busing policy that was used to enforce school desegregation, Richard Nixon courted populist conservative Southern Whites with what is called the Southern Strategy, though his speechwriter Jeffrey Hart claimed that his campaign rhetoric was actually a &quot;Border State Strategy&quot; and accused the press of being &quot;very lazy&quot; when they called it a &quot;Southern Strategy&quot;. In the 1971 &quot;Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot; ruling, the power of the federal government to enforce forced busing was strengthened when the Supreme Court ruled that the federal courts had the discretion to include busing as a desegregation tool to achieve racial balance. Some southern Democrats became Republicans at the national level, while remaining with their old party in state and local politics throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Several prominent conservative Democrats switched parties to become Republicans, including Strom Thurmond, John Connally and Mills E. Godwin Jr. In the 1974 &quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot; decision, however, the ability to use forced busing as a political tactic was greatly diminished when the U.S. Supreme Court placed an important limitation on &quot;Swann&quot; and ruled that students could only be bused across district lines if evidence of de jure segregation across multiple school districts existed.

In 1976, former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter won every Southern state except Oklahoma and Virginia in his successful presidential campaign as a Democrat, being the last Democratic presidential candidate to win a majority of the states in the South as of 2024. In 1980 Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan won every southern state except for Georgia, although Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, Arkansas, North Carolina and Tennessee were all decided by less than 3%.

===1981–2008===
In 1980, Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan announced that he supported &quot;states&#x27; rights.&quot; Lee Atwater, who served as Reagan&#x27;s chief strategist in the Southern states, claimed that by 1968, a vast majority of southern Whites had learned to accept that racial slurs like &quot;nigger&quot; were offensive and that mentioning &quot;states rights&quot; and reasons for its justification, along with fiscal conservatism and opposition to social programs understood by many White southerners to disproportionally benefit Black Americans, had now become the best way to appeal to southern White voters. Following Reagan&#x27;s success at the national level, the Republican Party moved sharply to the New Right, with the shrinkage of the &quot;Eastern Establishment&quot; Rockefeller Republican element that had emphasized their support for civil rights.

Economic and cultural conservatism (especially regarding abortion and LGBT rights) became more important in the South, with its large religious right element, such as Southern Baptists in the Bible Belt. The South gradually became fertile ground for the Republican Party. Following the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the large Black vote in the South held steady but overwhelmingly favored the Democratic Party. Even as the Democratic party came to increasingly depend on the support of African-American voters in the South, well-established White Democratic incumbents still held sway in most Southern states for decades. Starting in 1964, although the Southern states split their support between parties in most presidential elections, conservative Democrats controlled nearly every Southern state legislature until the mid-1990s. On the eve of the Republican Revolution in 1994, Democrats still held a 2:1 advantage over the Republicans in southern congressional seats. Only in 2011 did the Republicans capture a majority of Southern state legislatures, and have continued to hold power over Southern politics for the most part since.

Many of the Representatives, Senators, and voters who were referred to as Reagan Democrats in the 1980s were conservative Southern Democrats. They often had more conservative views than other Democrats. But there were notable remnants of the Solid South into the early 21st century.

* One example was Arkansas, whose state legislature continued to be majority Democrat (having, however, given its electoral votes to the Republicans in the past three presidential elections, except in 1992 and 1996 when &quot;favorite son&quot; Bill Clinton was the candidate and won each time) until 2012, when Arkansas voters selected a 21–14 Republican majority in the Arkansas Senate.
* Another example was North Carolina. Although the state has voted for Republicans in every presidential election since 1980 except for 2008, the State legislature was in Democratic control until 2010. The North Carolina congressional delegation was heavily Democratic until January 2013 when the Republicans could, after the 2010 United States census, adopt a redistricting plan of their choosing.

In 1992, Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton was elected president. Unlike Carter, however, Clinton was only able to win the southern states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia. While running for president, Clinton promised to &quot;end welfare as we have come to know it&quot; while in office. In 1996, Clinton would fulfill his campaign promise and the longtime Republican goal of major welfare reform came into fruition. After two welfare reform bills sponsored by the Republican-controlled Congress were successfully vetoed by the President, a compromise was eventually reached and the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act was signed into law on August 22, 1996.

During the Clinton administration, the southern strategy shifted towards the so-called &quot;culture war,&quot; which saw major political battles between the Religious Right and the secular Left. Chapman notes a split vote among many conservative Southern Democrats in the 1970s and 1980s who supported local and statewide conservative Democrats while simultaneously voting for Republican presidential candidates. This tendency of many Southern Whites to vote for the Republican presidential candidate but Democrats from other offices lasted until the 2010 midterm elections. In the November 2008 elections, Democrats won 3 out of 4 U.S. House seats from Mississippi, 3 out of 4 in Arkansas, 5 out of 9 in Tennessee, and achieved near parity in the Georgia and Alabama delegations.

Republicans first dominated presidential elections in the South, then won a majority of Southern gubernatorial and congressional elections after the 1994 Republican Revolution, and finally came to control a majority of Southern state legislatures by the 2010s.

===2009–present===
In 2009, Southern Democrats controlled both branches of the Alabama General Assembly, the Arkansas General Assembly, the Delaware General Assembly, the Louisiana State Legislature, the Maryland General Assembly, the Mississippi Legislature, the North Carolina General Assembly, and the West Virginia Legislature, along with the Council of the District of Columbia, the Kentucky House of Representatives, and the Virginia Senate. Democrats lost control of the North Carolina and Alabama legislatures in 2010, the Louisiana and Mississippi legislatures in 2011 and the Arkansas legislature in 2012. Additionally, in 2014, Democrats lost four U.S. Senate seats in the South (in West Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, and Louisiana) that they had previously held. By 2017, Southern Democrats only controlled both branches of the Delaware General Assembly and the Maryland General Assembly, along with the Council of the District of Columbia; they had lost control of both houses of the state legislatures in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and West Virginia.

Nearly all White Democratic representatives in the South lost reelection in the 2010 midterm elections. That year, Democrats won only one U.S. House seat each in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Arkansas, and two out of nine House seats in Tennessee, and they lost their one Arkansas seat in 2012. Following the November 2010 elections, John Barrow of Georgia was left as the only White Democratic U.S. House member in the Deep South, and he lost reelection in 2014. There would no more White Democrats from the Deep South until Joe Cunningham was elected from a South Carolina U.S. House district in 2018, and he lost re-election in 2020.

However, even since January 2015, Democrats have not been completely shut out of power in the South. Democrat John Bel Edwards was elected governor of Louisiana in 2015 and won re-election in 2019, running as an anti-abortion, pro-gun conservative Democrat. In a 2017 special election, moderate Democrat Doug Jones was elected a U.S. Senator from Alabama, though he lost re-election in 2020. Democrat Roy Cooper was elected governor of North Carolina in 2016 and won re-election in 2020. Southern Democrats saw some additional successes in 2019, as Andy Beshear was elected governor of Kentucky and won re-election in 2023. As of February 2024, Democrats control the governorships of Kentucky, North Carolina, Maryland, and Delaware and the state legislatures of Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia. Joe Manchin would be the last Democrat to win statewide in West Virginia in 2018. Manchin managed to escape the gravity of partisanship, even despite it being in a state Trump won by 40 points. He later switched to Independent status, before ultimately declining to run for re-election.

Since 2017, most U.S. House or state legislative seats held by Democrats in the South are majority-minority or urban districts. Due to growing urbanization and changing demographics in many Southern states, more liberal Democrats have found success in the South. In the 2018 elections, Democrats nearly succeeded in taking governor&#x27;s seats in Georgia and Florida and gained 12 national House seats in the South; the trend continued in the 2019 elections, where Democrats took both houses of the Virginia General Assembly, and in 2020 where Joe Biden narrowly won Georgia with Republicans winning down ballot, along with Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff narrowly winning both U.S. Senate seats in that state just two months later. However, Democrats would lose the governor races in Florida and Georgia in 2022 by wider margins than in 2018, though Senator Warnock won re-election in Georgia.

Virginia is a notable exception to Republican dominance in the former 11 Confederate states, due to Northern Virginia being part of the Washington metropolitan area, with both major parties continuing to be competitive in the State in the 21st century. Dr. Ralph Northam, a Democrat and the governor of Virginia (2018–22), admitted that he voted for George W. Bush in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. Despite this admission, Northam, a former state Senator who has served as Lieutenant Governor of Virginia from 2014 to 2018, easily defeated the more progressive and cosmopolitan candidate, former Representative Tom Perriello, by 55.9 percent to 44.1 percent to win the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 2017. Both of Virginia&#x27;s U.S. Senators are Democrats, while the incumbent governor Glenn Youngkin is a Republican.

As of the 2020s, Southern Democrats who consistently vote for the Democratic ticket are mostly urban liberals or African Americans, while most White Southerners of both genders tend to vote for the Republican ticket, although there are sizable numbers of swing voters who sometimes split their tickets or cross party lines.

==Southern Democratic presidential tickets==
At various times, registered Democrats from the South broke with the national party to nominate their own presidential and vice presidential candidates, generally in opposition to civil rights measures supported by the national nominees. There was at least one Southern Democratic effort in every presidential election from 1944 until 1968, besides 1952. On some occasions, such as in 1948 with Strom Thurmond, these candidates have been listed on the ballot in some states as the nominee of the Democratic Party. George Wallace of Alabama was in presidential politics as a conservative Democrat except 1968, when he left the party and ran as an independent. Running as the nominees of the American Independent Party, the Wallace ticket won 5 states. Its best result was in Alabama, where it received 65.9% of the vote. Wallace was the official Democratic nominee in Alabama and Hubert Humphrey was listed as the &quot;National Democratic&quot; candidate.

<text>Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids (often referred to simply as Fat Albert) is an educational American animated television series created, produced, and hosted (in live action bookends) by comedian Bill Cosby, who also lent his voice to a number of characters, including Fat Albert himself. Filmation was the production company for the series. The show premiered in 1972 and aired until 1985 (with new episodes being produced sporadically during that time frame). The show, based on Cosby&#x27;s remembrances of his childhood gang, focused on Fat Albert (known for his catchphrase &quot;Hey hey hey!&quot;), and his friends.

The show features an educational lesson in each episode, emphasized by Cosby&#x27;s live-action segments. In addition, at the end of the early episodes, the gang typically joins in their North Philadelphia junkyard to play a song on their cobbled-together instruments, summarizing the show&#x27;s lesson.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that the show &quot;enjoyed enormous success&quot; throughout its run. The show&#x27;s success led Cosby to create a second animated series, &quot;Little Bill&quot;, in the late 1990s. &quot;Little Bill&quot; was intentionally designed to be visually different from &quot;Fat Albert&quot;, while retaining similar educational lessons and roots in Cosby&#x27;s childhood experiences.

==Origins and history==
The character Fat Albert first appeared in Bill Cosby&#x27;s stand-up comedy routine &quot;Buck Buck,&quot; as recorded on his 1967 album &quot;Revenge&quot;. The stories were based upon Cosby&#x27;s tales about growing up in inner city North Philadelphia. In 1969, Cosby and veteran animator Ken Mundie brought Fat Albert to animation in a prime-time special entitled &quot;Hey, Hey, Hey, It&#x27;s Fat Albert&quot;.

The special, which aired on NBC, was a hybrid of live action and animation. The music for the special was written and performed by jazz pianist/keyboardist Herbie Hancock in 1969 and was released on the Warner Bros. album &quot;Fat Albert Rotunda&quot;. For the animated portion of the special, it was necessary to develop the actual appearance of each of the Fat Albert Gang&#x27;s characters. For this, Ken Mundie relied on animator Amby Paliwoda, a former Disney artist. Paliwoda not only created all the Gang&#x27;s characters, but painted a &quot;group portrait&quot; which was eventually shown on the front page of &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine shortly before the showing of the special.

The producers wanted NBC to bring &quot;Fat Albert&quot; to Saturday mornings, but the network programming managers rejected this because the series was too educational. Bill Cosby and a new production company, Filmation Associates, then took the property to CBS. The Fat Albert gang&#x27;s character images were primarily created by the artist Randy Hollar, with the assistance of one-time Disney animator Michelle McKinney, under the direction of Ken Brown.

Retitled &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot;, the series premiered on September 9, 1972, on CBS. Production lasted for 12 years, though production of the series was not continuous. It also spent another season in first-run syndication (1984–85). Three prime-time holiday specials (Halloween, Christmas, and Easter) featuring the characters were also produced. Like most Saturday morning cartoons of the era, &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot; contained an adult laugh track, which was eliminated during the final season. The series was rerun on NBC Saturday mornings and on the USA Network in 1989.

In the late 1990s, Bill Cosby developed a second animated series, &quot;Little Bill&quot;, which was intentionally designed to look different from &quot;Fat Albert&quot;. The executive producer of &quot;Little Bill&quot;, Janice Burgess, stated that the Fat Albert character was &quot;more broadly comic&quot; and exaggeratedly cartoonish than &quot;Little Bill&quot;. However, the two shows shared similar educational messages.

==Characters==

===The Cosby Kids===
* Fat Albert Robertson (voiced by Bill Cosby; singing by Michael Gray) is based on Cosby&#x27;s childhood friend Albert Robertson. The main character in the series, he is usually the conscience of the Junkyard Gang. Though very obese, he is athletic and enjoys playing sports. He always wears a burnt orange shirt (which became red later on) and blue pants. Civic-minded and wise beyond his years, Fat Albert works hard to maintain integrity in the gang and with others, and is the lead singer as well as bagpipe-accordion (made from a funnel, radiator and an airbag) player in the Junkyard Band and on occasion, plays the bedspring.
* James &quot;Mushmouth&quot; Mush (voiced by Bill Cosby) is a slack-jawed simpleton with big lips. He always wears a red knit hat with a blue scarf and always speaks in virtual Ubbi Dubbi, tantamount to an overdose of novocaine in the mouth, which Cosby would later use in the &quot;Dentist&quot; monologue from his 1983 film, &quot;Himself&quot;. Mushmouth plays a homemade bass guitar in the Junkyard Band.
* &quot;Dumb&quot; Donald Parker (voiced by Lou Scheimer) is a lanky, dimwitted fellow. He is Rudy&#x27;s best friend. He always wears a green long-sleeved jersey three sizes too big, and a pink stocking knit cap covering his entire face except his eyes and mouth. In the Junkyard Band, he plays a trombone made out of plumbers&#x27; pipe and a morning glory horn from an old phonograph. In the &quot;Fat Albert&quot; film and while in the real world, Donald takes off his cap and learns that he has a handsome face.
* William &quot;Bill&quot; Cosby (voiced by Bill Cosby) is a character based on Cosby himself and is the host of the series. Like the others, Bill is a good athlete and enjoys playing sports. However, he spends most of his time trying, often unsuccessfully, to keep his little brother Russell out of trouble. Like Fat Albert, Bill is often a voice of reason in the gang, although at times a little more stubborn. In the Junkyard Band, he plays homemade drums made from a discarded foot-pedal trash can using spoons for sticks.
* Russell Cosby (voiced by Jan Crawford) is Bill&#x27;s younger brother (based on his real-life brother—whom he often talked about in his routines) and the smallest and youngest of the Junkyard Gang. He always wears a heavy blue jacket, a yellow scarf, red boots, and a dark blue Ushanka winter hat regardless of the weather. Russell has a penchant for making snide remarks and blunt observations (much to his older brother&#x27;s consternation). Russell frequently criticizes Rudy, reserving his most withering insults for when Rudy is being especially cocky. His catchphrase is &quot;no class&quot;. He plays the xylophone in the Junkyard Band (made out of empty cans and a discarded coat rack).
* &quot;Old Weird&quot; Harold Simmons (voiced by Gerald Edwards) is a tall, skinny, beady-eyed kid who is the tallest one of the Junkyard Gang and always wears a gold dress blazer, a brown sock on one foot and a red sock on the other, and is clumsy. In the Junkyard Band, he plays a harp made from bedsprings, and on occasion plays a &quot;dressmaker dummy&quot; in the percussion section. In the film adaptation, he is called &quot;&quot;Old&quot; Weird Harold&quot;, as he was in Cosby&#x27;s stand-up routines.
* Rudy Davis (voiced by Pepe Brown for the first two seasons, then Eric Suter for the rest of the series) is a sharp-dressed, smooth-talking, cocky huckster whose smart-aleck attitude frequently gets him into trouble. He is Dumb Donald&#x27;s best friend. Rudy&#x27;s cocky attitude and dismissive demeanor are often the catalyst for a typical plot&#x27;s conflict. But inside he has a good heart and usually learns lessons from his mistakes. In the Junkyard Band, he plays a makeshift banjo, whose parts include a broomstick handle and sewing-thread spool to hold the strings. However, when shown playing apart from the others, Rudy plays an electric guitar (personalized with a big &quot;R&quot;). He always wears an orange flat cap, a fuchsia vest, a pink turtleneck, purple bell-bottom jeans, and boots. Rudy&#x27;s personality in the &quot;Fat Albert&quot; movie is much different as he is portrayed as a kind and chivalrous gentleman who falls in love with the female lead Doris (Kyla Pratt).
* Bucky Miller (voiced by Jan Crawford), as his name indicates, has a large overbite. He is a quick and flexible athlete. Bucky plays a stovepipe organ in the Junkyard Band.

===Others===
* Miss Berry is the kids&#x27; first teacher and mentor. She is later replaced by Mrs. Breyfogle. In later seasons, the kids went to a different school where their teacher and mentor was Miss Wucher. All three characters were voiced by Jay Scheimer, wife of executive producer Lou Scheimer.
* Mudfoot Brown (voiced by Bill Cosby) is a wise old man and unemployed vagrant who gives advice to the gang, often using reverse psychology to get his point across. He has a talent for telling tall tales. He makes a minor appearance in the film adaptation at the beginning and end of the film, voiced by Earl Billings. However, he is never referred to by name in the film.
* The Brown Hornet (voiced by Bill Cosby) is the title character of a show about an African-American superhero whose cartoons were watched regularly by the gang. He is a parody of the Green Hornet.
** Stinger (voiced by Lou Scheimer) is the Brown Hornet&#x27;s beefy sidekick whose gruff exterior masks a soft heart.
** Tweeterbell (voiced by Erika Scheimer) is a female robot assistant to the Brown Hornet and Stinger.
* Cluck (voiced by Lou Scheimer) is a duck that followed the gang regularly in early episodes, but stopped appearing after season 1.
* Legal Eagle (voiced by Lou Scheimer) is another show-within-a-show, involving a crime-fighting cartoon eagle.
** Moe and Gabby (voiced by Jan Crawford &amp; Gerald Edwards) are two lazy, klutzy squirrel underlings that work with Legal Eagle as police officers.
* Margene (voiced by Erika Scheimer) is a classmate and good friend of Fat Albert&#x27;s. In one episode she and Albert ran for co-president of the Student Council and beat out two other candidates, both of whom were running on platforms of racism. A straight-A student, Margene occasionally got in with the wrong people but always managed to rebound; in a different episode she got hooked on drugs, and in another she got innocently involved in a violent cult.
* The 3 River Blockbusters are the Junkyard Gang&#x27;s main rivals when it comes to competing in sports such as baseball and football. The Blockbusters stole the championship in a competition called &quot;buck buck&quot; in the episode &quot;Moving&quot;. One of them was voiced by Gerald Edwards, and another was voiced by Eric Suter. They make an appearance in the film adaptation, which features totally different members, with the leader, dubbed as Crips, voiced by Catero Colbert and credited as &quot;Lead Teen&quot;.
* Pee Wee (voiced by Keith Sutherland) is a small boy who looks up to Fat Albert and the gang. While being small in stature, his best athletic skill is kicking a football at a long distance. When the bigger kids could not get anything out of a small van, Pee Wee is there to retrieve it.

Lou Scheimer, Jay Scheimer, Erika Scheimer (as &quot;Erika Carroll&quot;), Keith Sutherland, Lane Scheimer, Bill Cosby, Eric Suter, Gerald Edwards, Jan Crawford, Eric Greene, Ty Henderson, Kim Hamilton, Frank Welker, Linda Gary and Greg Morris provided additional voices.

==Episodes==
==Educational lessons and songs==
&quot;Fat Albert&quot; was honored and noted for its educational content, which included Cosby earning a Doctorate in Education. In every show&#x27;s opening Cosby would playfully warn:

During each episode, Fat Albert and his friends (aka The Junkyard Gang), dealt with an issue or problem commonly faced by children, ranging from stage fright, first loves, medical operations, and personal hygiene to more serious themes (though toned down for younger children) including vandalism, stealing, racism, rape, smoking, being scammed by con artists, sexually transmitted diseases, child abuse, kidnapping, drug use, gun violence, and death.

At the end of most episodes (with some exceptions in the case of particularly serious themes), the gang would sing a song about the theme of the day. This sequence, similar to those seen in other Filmation shows including &quot;The Archie Show&quot;, has often been parodied. The musical sequence was dropped during the &quot;Brown Hornet&quot;/&quot;Legal Eagle&quot; years. When Fat Albert entered syndication, some of the episodes produced prior to 1979 had their songs removed in favor of a Brown Hornet story. This was the case with &quot;Shuttered Window&quot; which dealt with the issue of death, in which the Brown Hornet encountered a robotic teacher and leader who realizes that his functions are worn out will soon cease to function. The teacher informs Hornet of this fact and Hornet has to let the teacher&#x27;s citizens know that they must go on without their leader/teacher. This sets up the real world story regarding the recurring character Undeen and the sudden death of her Uncle Monty (although no reference to the Brown Hornet story told by Fat Albert as is the normal case in the 1979–84 episodes).

The series enjoyed one of the longest runs in the history of Saturday morning cartoons.

==Revamps and renames==
In 1979, the show was re-titled The New Fat Albert Show and featured a new segment titled &quot;The Brown Hornet&quot; detailing the adventures of a black crime fighter in outer space whose design resembled a caricature of Bill Cosby, who also performed vocal talents on the character. His shows always contained an object lesson for the viewers. The gang would watch the program at the beginning of each episode, and then they would invariably face a situation that forced them to apply the object lesson.

In 1984, the show was syndicated and renamed The Adventures of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids. The lack of network restrictions allowed the producer to delve into more mature subject matter. A notable episode (&quot;Busted&quot;) featured the kids having an inadvertent brush with the law and given a &quot;Scared Straight!&quot;-style tour of an occupied maximum security prison; it even contained utterances (by the jail&#x27;s inmates) of the words &quot;damn&quot; and &quot;bastard&quot; (Cosby had appeared in the beginning of the episode advising viewers that those words would be used as part of the story&#x27;s dialogue to realistically depict jail life). Another notable episode, &quot;Gang Wars&quot;, featured a child being shot and killed. Another segment was added: &quot;Legal Eagle&quot;, a crime-fighting eagle with a pair of bumbling police deputy squirrels. Production of new episodes ceased in 1985.

==Theme song==
The theme song, &quot;Gonna Have a Good Time&quot;, was composed by Ricky Sheldon and Edward Fournier, and performed by Michael Gray (vocals), Kim Carnes (background vocals) and Edward Fournier (background vocals).

A cover of the show&#x27;s theme song, performed by Dig, is included on the 1995 tribute album &quot;Saturday Morning: Cartoons&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot;, produced by Ralph Sall and released on MCA Records. The song&#x27;s chorus (&quot;Na-na-na, gonna have a good time!&quot;) was also sampled in Fatboy Slim&#x27;s 1998 hit single &quot;Praise You&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot; was named the 82nd best animated series by IGN.

&quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot; received an Emmy nomination in 1974. Production of the final season of the series overlapped with the start of production of Bill Cosby&#x27;s live-action sitcom, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, which began airing on NBC in fall 1984.

In 1993, &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine named &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot; the best cartoon series of the 1970s in its issue celebrating 40 years of television.

In 2002, Fat Albert was placed at number 12 on TV Guide&#x27;s list of the 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time.

In 2020, Joyce Slaton of Common Sense Media argued that the series is an &quot;old-school cartoon...[with] strong positive messages.&quot; She noted that while the show&#x27;s themes like kidnapping, racism, and child abuse may cause parents to be concerned, there is &quot;fresh humor, funky music, and the strong positive messages&quot;.

==Availability==
===Syndication===
As of 2013, &quot;Fat Albert&quot; was seen Saturday mornings on Retro Television Network (RTV), TheCoolTV, and weekdays and weekends on Bounce TV, both of which are digital networks. It was also seen weekdays on the now-defunct Sky Angel services Angel Two and Kids &amp; Teens TV, as well as World Harvest Television. &quot;Fat Albert&quot; was also available streaming online from HallmarkSpiritClips.com.

As of July 2015, &quot;Fat Albert&quot; was no longer on Bounce TV&#x27;s lineup. Bounce TV had previously pulled the comedy series &quot;Cosby&quot; from their lineup in the wake of the Bill Cosby sexual assault allegations, but it is unclear if the cancellations of the &quot;Fat Albert&quot; episodes was related to these allegations. However, several months after returning reruns of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; in December 2016, Bounce TV quietly re-added &quot;Fat Albert&quot; to its schedule in March 2017, until it was eventually removed from the schedule again in late April 2018. As of 2025, there are seldom attempts to re-air this program in reruns at this time as further details are undisclosed.

===Home media===
During the mid-1980s, Thorn EMI Video released several volumes of &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot; on VHS as part of their &quot;Children&#x27;s Matinee&quot; line of animated programs, with each cassette typically containing three episodes. Additional volumes were released later in the decade by Video Treasures, including the three holiday specials.

In 2002, Time Life distributed 11 volumes of the series on VHS and DVD through mail-order. Each volume contained two episodes, with the DVD releases containing a bonus third episode, along with character profiles and a bonus &quot;Brown Hornet&quot; segment from the 1980-82 seasons. The episodes included were from the 1972-76 seasons, with only one coming from the &quot;New Fat Albert&quot; season in 1979. Some of the episodes were edited versions, either using 1979-82 &quot;Brown Hornet&quot; re-broadcasts in place of the closing song segments, 1984 re-broadcasts with the live-action Cosby segments re-filmed, or alternate prints of 1972 episodes with no laugh track. The 11th volume included the Christmas and Halloween specials. These were the only DVD releases to present the show in its original NTSC format, as future DVD releases use PAL prints.

In 2004, UrbanWorks Entertainment acquired the rights to the series, subsequently releasing several &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot; DVDs including a two-volume collection featuring 24 episodes, as well as all specials to coincide with the theatrical release of the feature film adaptation. Volume 1 contains two DVDs with episodes 1–12 (airdates 9/9–11/25/1972), along with a CD containing the opening theme, the closing theme, and 12 songs from each of the 12 episodes shown in vol. 1 Volume 2 contains two discs with episodes 13–24 (airdates 12/2/1972–9/13/1975), along with a CD containing the opening theme, the closing theme, and 12 songs from each of the 12 episodes shown in vol. 2. In addition, UrbanWorks Entertainment released a Greatest Hits four-disc DVD box set, containing 20 uncut episodes in their original broadcast presentation and original airdate order, as well as a five-best episodes set via &quot;Ventura Distribution&quot;.

In 2008, Classic Media acquired the rights to the series and stated at the time that they intended to release the entire series on DVD. This never happened as they only re-released &quot;The Fat Albert Halloween Special&quot; and &quot;The Fat Albert Easter Special&quot; on DVD via distribution partner Genius Products.

On April 6, 2012, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series (under license from Classic Media) and planned to release a complete series box set on DVD. The DVD set was released on June 25, 2013.

On September 4, 2012, Classic Media re-released all three holiday specials together in one collection entitled &quot;The Hey Hey Hey Holiday Collection&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

==Other media==
Gold Key Comics released a comic book adaptation of &quot;Fat Albert&quot;, which ran for 29 issues from 1974 to 1979.

In 2012, Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids appeared in MetLife&#x27;s &quot;Everyone&quot; commercial during Super Bowl XLVI.

==Film adaptation==
In 2004, 20th Century Fox released a film adaptation of the series titled &quot;Fat Albert&quot;. The film stars Kenan Thompson as Fat Albert, Kyla Pratt, and Bill Cosby. The film acts as a sequel to the series where Fat Albert and the boys journey into the real world after jumping out of a television in order to help a lonely girl named Doris (Kyla Pratt) with her social anxiety. The boys enjoy being in the real world but after a meeting with their creator, Bill Cosby, Fat Albert is informed that if he and the others do not return to the television world immediately, they will turn into celluloid dust.

<text>There have been three baronetcies created for members of the Bacon family, all in the Baronetage of England. As of 2008, one creation is extinct and two of the creations are extant. The extant titles have been merged since 1755.

The Bacon baronetcy, of Redgrave in the County of Suffolk, is the premier baronetcy in the Baronetage of England, which was created on 22 May 1611 for Nicholas Bacon, Member of Parliament for Beverley and Suffolk, and the eldest son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, a prominent Elizabethan politician. The philosopher and statesman Francis Bacon was his half-brother. Bacon was the first person to be created a baronet. As the baronetcy is the oldest extant English baronetcy, the holder is considered the Premier Baronet of England. Bacon&#x27;s second son Butts Bacon was created a baronet, of Mildenhall, in his own right in 1627 (see below). Bacon was succeeded by his eldest son, Edmund, the second Baronet. He represented Eye and Norfolk in the House of Commons. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, Robert, the third Baronet. On his death, the title passed to his grandson, Edmund, the fourth Baronet. He served as High Sheriff of Suffolk from 1665 to 1666. He died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his first cousin, Robert, the fifth Baronet. He was the son of Butts Bacon, younger son of the fourth Baronet. When he died, the title passed to his son, Edmund, the sixth Baronet. He sat as Member of Parliament for Thetford and Norfolk. He had no sons and on his death in 1755, the line of the second Baronet failed.

The late Baronet was succeeded by his third cousin once removed, Sir Richard Bacon, 8th Baronet, of Mildenhall, great-great-grandson of the aforementioned Sir Butts Bacon, 1st Baronet, of Mildenhall, second son of the first Baronet of Redgrave. He died without surviving issue and was succeeded by his nephew, Edmund, the eighth/ninth Baronet. He was the son of the fourth Baronet of Mildenhall by his second wife Mary Castell. His elder son, Edmund, the ninth/tenth Baronet, died without surviving male issue in 1864. He was succeeded by his nephew, Henry, the tenth/eleventh Baronet. He was the son of Nicholas Bacon, younger son of the eighth/ninth Baronet. Bacon was High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1867. His elder son, Hickman, the eleventh/twelfth Baronet, was High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1887 and a justice of the peace and Deputy Lieutenant of the county. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, Nicholas, the twelfth/thirteenth Baronet. He was High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1895, a justice of the peace and Deputy Lieutenant for the county and Chairman of the Lindsey County Council. He was succeeded by his only son, Edmund, the thirteenth/fourteenth Baronet. He was a soldier, businessman, public servant and Lord-Lieutenant of Norfolk. In 1970 he was made a Knight of the Garter. As of 2014 the titles are held by his only son, the fourteenth/fifteenth Baronet, who succeeded in 1982.
The Bacon baronetcy, of Mildenhall in the County of Suffolk, was created in the Baronetage of England on 29 July 1627 for Butts Bacon, seventh son of the first Baronet of the 1611 creation. His great-grandson (the title having descended from father to son), Edmund, the fourth Baronet, represented Orford in Parliament. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Edmund, the fifth Baronet. He was Member of Parliament for Thetford. His only son, Edmund, the sixth Baronet, died unmarried at an early age in 1750. He was succeeded by his uncle, Henry, the seventh Baronet. He also died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, Richard, the eighth Baronet. In 1755 he succeeded his third cousin once removed as eighth Baronet of Redgrave. For further history of the titles, see above.

The Bacon baronetcy, of Gillingham in the County of Norfolk, was created in the Baronetage of England on 7 February 1662 for Nicholas Bacon. He was the son of Nicholas Bacon, fourth son of the first Baronet of the 1611 creation and brother of the first Baronet of the 1627 creation. His two sons, the second and third Baronets, both succeeded in the title. They both died young and the title became extinct on the latter&#x27;s death in 1685.

==Family seat==
Redgrave Manor, the former family seat in Suffolk, was bought by the elder Sir Nicholas Bacon from Henry VIII in 1542 and substantially restored between 1545 and 1554. It was the seat of the Bacon family until debts forced the fifth Baronet, Sir Robert Bacon, to sell the estate in 1702 to Sir John Holt.

<doc id="861816" wikidata="Q614163" url="?curid=861816" title="Liberal Party of Macedonia">
<text>The Liberal Party of Macedonia () was a conservative-liberal political party in North Macedonia. The party was a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party. Its last chairman was Ivon Velichkovski.

==History==
The Liberal Party was established on 5 October 1990 as the Union of Reform Forces in Macedonia (Сојуз на реформски сили, &quot;Sojuz na reformski sili&quot;, SRS) under the chairmanship of Stojan Andov. Although it shared its name with the Union of Reform Forces operating in other parts of Yugoslavia and headed by Prime Minister Ante Marković, it was not directly linked to the party. However, due to Marković&#x27;s popularity, the party performed well in the 1990 parliamentary elections, receiving 13.3% of the vote in the first round and 16.1% in the second, winning a total of 11 seats. The party also ran in an alliance with the Young Democratic-Progressive Party (MDPS) in some areas, and with the Social Democratic Party in others. The joint SRS–MDPS candidates won six seats, whilst the alliance with the Social Democratic Party failed to win a seat.

In 1991, the party merged with the Young Democratic-Progressive Party, and was renamed Reform Forces in Macedonia–Liberal Party, before becoming the Liberal Party in June 1993. It was part of the Alliance for Macedonia in the 1994 general elections. The Alliance won 87 seats in the Assembly, whilst the Liberal Party won a further five seats running alone and one seat where it ran in alliance with the Social Democratic Union.

In April 1997, the Liberal Party merged with the Democratic Party to form the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). However, several former members of the Liberal Party broke away from the LDP in December 1999 to re-established the party. In 1999-2001 its leader was Risto Gushterov and in 2001-2008 - again Stojan Andov.

The party ran in an alliance with the VMRO-DPMNE for the 2002 elections, but the alliance was defeated by the Together for Macedonia coalition. The two remained in an alliance with the addition of several other parties for the 2006 elections, which it emerged from as the largest bloc in the Assembly with 45 of the 120 seats, of which two were held by the Liberal Party.

In 2008-2011, its chairman was Borche Stoyanovski; in 2011-2019 its chairman was Ivon Velichkovski.

Prior to the 2008 elections the party joined Sun – Coalition for Europe alongside the Social Democratic Union (SDSM) and several other parties. The coalition lost the elections to the VMRO-DPMNE-led For a Better Macedonia alliance. The Liberal Party remained in alliance with the SDSM for the 2011 elections, again losing to the VMRO-DPMNE-led alliance. Her leader Ivon Velichkoski in 2011-2014 was a member of parliament from the opposition.

Prior to the 2014 elections, the party became part of the Citizen Option for Macedonia coalition. Party ran independently in 2016 elections, but received less than four thousand votes (0.33 %), no MPs and gradually diminished.

In the beginning of 2019, Ivon Velichkovski resigned from the party and in the mid-2019 it was officially erased from the list of the political parties of North Macedonia. In October 2021, Ivon Velichkovski founded a new political formation - Movement for a New Republic.

<text>Abraham Albert Cohen (August 16, 1895 – October 17, 1981) was a Greek-born Romaniote Jewish Swiss novelist who wrote in French. He worked as a civil servant for various international organizations, such as the International Labour Organization. He became a Swiss citizen in 1919.

==Biography==

Abraham Albert Cohen () was born in Corfu, Greece, in 1895, to Greek Jewish parents. Albert&#x27;s parents, who owned a soap factory, moved to Marseille, France, when he was a child. Albert Cohen discusses this period in his novel &quot;Le Livre de ma mère&quot; (&quot;The Book of My Mother&quot;). He studied at a private Catholic school. In 1904, he started high school at Lycée Thiers, where he met and started a lifelong friendship with Marcel Pagnol, and graduated in 1913.

In 1914, he left Marseille for Geneva, Switzerland, and enrolled in law school. He graduated from law school in 1917 and enrolled in literature school in 1917, where he remained until 1919. In 1919, he became a Swiss citizen. That same year he married Elisabeth Brocher, who in 1921 gave birth to their daughter, Myriam. In 1924, his wife died of cancer. In 1925, Albert Cohen became director of &quot;Revue Juive&quot; (&quot;The Jewish Review&quot;), a periodical whose writers included Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. From 1926 to 1932, he worked in International Labour Organization in Geneva. In 1933, he married his second wife, Marianne Goss.

In 1939, living in France, he became a personal representative of Chaim Weizmann, the president of the Zionist Organization. He helped Jewish refugees from Nazism to reach Palestine. In 1940, after the German invasion in France, Cohen fled to London. The Jewish Agency for Palestine then made him responsible for establishing contacts with exiled governments. On January 10, 1943, Cohen&#x27;s mother died in Marseille. That same year, he met his future third wife, Bella Berkowich. In 1944, he became an attorney for the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees. In 1947, Cohen returned to Geneva where he held a senior post in International Refugee Organization until 1954. In 1957, he turned down the post of Israeli Ambassador in order to pursue his literary career.

He died in Geneva at the age of 86 and is buried in the Jewish Cemetery of Veyrier, near Geneva.

==Cohen&#x27;s literature==
Through four different books, Cohen&#x27;s fiction can be considered as one long autobiographical fiction. It is the story of the radiant Solal – Cohen&#x27;s double – a handsome and successful civil servant of the League of Nations whose charismatic identity is a constant struggle between his Jewish roots and his social status.

His masterpiece, &quot;Belle du Seigneur&quot;, originally included the novel that was later published as &quot;Les Valeureux&quot;. &quot;Belle du Seigneur&quot; is called &quot;the book of love&quot;, and tells Solal&#x27;s passionate, cruel yet realistic love affair with Ariane Deume, a married non-Jewish woman. In 1968, the novel received the French Academy award. Since then, the novel has been one of the biggest sellers of the prestigious Gallimard White Collection. In 2022, Cohen&#x27;s works were published in the prestigious Bibliothèque de la Pléiade.

<text>The United Democratic Front is a political party in Malawi founded in 1992 by Bakili Muluzi. It claims to be a liberal party in Malawi and is mainly strong in the southern region populated by ethnic Yao. Bakili Muluzi was President of Malawi from 1994 to 2004.

==History==
The United Democratic Front is a prominent political party in Malawi that was founded in 1992 by Bakili Muluzi. Until 2009, the party was a member of Liberal International, which it joined at the latter&#x27;s Reykjavík Congress in 1994.

=== Rise of DPP faction===
It came into power in 1994 under Bakili Muluzi; he was in power until 2004, serving two terms. 
It continued in power under Bingu wa Mutharika; however, Muluzi remained the head of the party. After succeeding Muluzi, Mutharika came into conflict with much of the party, including Muluzi, and he left the party in February 2005 to form the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). In 2009, it was the DPP which won the election. This led to mass defections from the UDF to the ruling DPP. The party however, continued to restructure.

==Political performance==
In 1994, the UDF candidate Bakili Muluzi came to power in Malawi. 
In the general election held on 20 May 2004, the UDF&#x27;s candidate for president, Bingu wa Mutharika, won 35.9% of the vote and was elected. The party also won 49 out of 194 seats.

On 24 April 2008, a UDF convention, which included 2,000 delegates, chose Muluzi as the party&#x27;s 2009 presidential candidate, despite questions about his eligibility due to term limits. He received 1,950 votes at the convention against 38 for Vice-President Cassim Chilumpha.

<text>Apsley George Benet Cherry-Garrard (2 January 1886 – 18 May 1959) was an English explorer of Antarctica. He was a member of the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; expedition and is acclaimed for his 1922 account of this expedition, &quot;The Worst Journey in the World&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born in Bedford, as Apsley George Benet Cherry, the eldest child of Apsley Cherry of Denford Park and his wife, Evelyn Edith (née Sharpin), daughter of Henry Wilson Sharpin of Bedford. He was educated at Winchester College and at Christ Church, Oxford where he read classics and modern history. While at Oxford, he rowed in the 1908 Christ Church crew which won the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta.
His surname was changed to Cherry-Garrard by the terms of his great-aunt&#x27;s will, through which his father inherited the Lamer Park estate near Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire. Apsley inherited the estate on his father&#x27;s death in 1907.

Cherry-Garrard had always been enamoured of the stories of his father&#x27;s achievements in India and China where he had fought with merit for the British Army, and felt that he must live up to his father&#x27;s example. In September 1907, Edward Adrian Wilson met with Robert Falcon Scott at Reginald Smith&#x27;s home in Cortachy, to discuss another Antarctic expedition; Smith&#x27;s young cousin Apsley Cherry-Garrard happened to visit and decided to volunteer.

== Antarctica ==

At the age of 24, &#x27;Cherry&#x27; was one of the youngest members of the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; expedition. This was Scott&#x27;s second and last expedition to Antarctica. Cherry&#x27;s application to join the expedition was initially rejected as Scott was looking for scientists, but he made a second application along with a promise of towards the cost of the expedition.

Rejected a second time, he made the donation regardless. Struck by this gesture, and at the same time persuaded by Edward Adrian Wilson, Scott agreed to take Cherry-Garrard as assistant zoologist. The expedition arrived in the Antarctic on 4 January 1911. During the remainder of the southern summer, from January to March, Cherry-Garrard helped lay depots of fuel and food on the intended route of the party which would attempt to reach the South Pole.

=== Winter journey ===

With Wilson and Henry Robertson Bowers, Cherry-Garrard made a trip to Cape Crozier on Ross Island in July 1911 during the austral winter in order to secure an unhatched emperor penguin egg to hopefully help scientists prove the evolutionary link between all birds and their reptile predecessors by analysis of the embryo. Cherry-Garrard suffered from a high degree of myopia, seeing little without the spectacles that he could not wear while sledging.

In almost total darkness, and with temperatures ranging from , they man-hauled their sledge from Scott&#x27;s base at Cape Evans to the far side of Ross Island. The party had two sledges, but the poor surface of the ice due to the extremely low temperatures meant that they could not drag both sledges as intended during parts of the outward journey. They were thus forced to relay, moving one sledge a certain distance before returning for the other. This highly inefficient means of travelling – walking for every one advanced – meant at times they could only travel a couple of miles each day.

Frozen and exhausted, they reached their destination in 19 days and built an improvised rock wall igloo with canvas roof on the slopes of Mount Terror just a few miles from the penguin colony at Cape Crozier. They managed to collect three penguin eggs intact before a force eleven blizzard struck on 22 July, ripping their tent away and carrying it off in the wind. The igloo roof lasted one more day before it too was ripped away by the wind, leaving the men in their sleeping bags under a thickening drift of snow, singing songs and hymns above the sounds of the storm to keep their spirits up.

When the winds subsided on 24 July, by great fortune they found their tent lodged in a hollow drift at the bottom of a steep slope half a mile away. Cherry-Garrard suffered such cold that he shattered most of his teeth due to chattering in the frigid temperatures. Desperately exhausted by the cold and lack of sleep, they left anything they didn&#x27;t need behind and began their return journey. Only progressing a mile and a half some days, they eventually arrived back at Cape Evans shortly before midnight on 1 August. Cherry-Garrard later referred to this as the &#x27;worst journey in the world&#x27; at the suggestion of his neighbour George Bernard Shaw, and gave this title to his book recounting the fate of the 1910–1913 expedition.

=== Polar journey ===
On 1 November 1911, Cherry-Garrard set off to accompany the team that would make the attempt on the South Pole, along with three supporting parties of men, dogs and horses. At the foot of the Beardmore Glacier, the horses were shot and their flesh cached for food, while the dog teams turned back for base. At the top of the Beardmore Glacier, on 22 December, Cherry-Garrard was in the second supporting party to be sent home, arriving back at base on 26 January 1912.

=== One Ton Depot ===

Scott had left orders for dog-driver Meares and surgeon Edward L. Atkinson to take the dog teams south in early February 1912 to meet Scott&#x27;s party on 1 March at latitude 82° or 82°30′S, and to assist his return journey. As Cecil Meares was not available for work, Atkinson had to attend to a medical emergency, and George Simpson was busy, the fateful choice fell on Cherry-Garrard. Belatedly, on 26 February 1912, Cherry-Garrard and dog handler Dimitri Gerov set off southwards and soon reached One Ton Depot on 3 March, and deposited additional food.

They waited there seven days hoping to meet the South Pole team. Cherry-Garrard and Dimitri then turned back on 10 March. Scott&#x27;s party was at that time only , i.e. three dog marches south of One Ton Depot. Scott and his companions eventually reached a point south of One Ton Depot, where they starved or froze to death. Cherry-Garrard later wrote that &quot;the primary object of this journey with the dog team[s] was to hurry Scott and his companions home&quot; but they &quot;were never meant to be a relief journey&quot;.

He justified his decision to wait for a week and then turn back, stating that the poor weather, with daytime temperatures as low as , made further southward travel impossible, and the lack of dog food meant he would have had to kill dogs for food, against Atkinson&#x27;s orders. They returned to base on 16 March empty-handed, immediately causing anxiety about Scott&#x27;s fate.

Two days later, Cherry-Garrard fainted and became an invalid for the following days. Atkinson set forth to fetch Scott, but on 30 March was forced to turn back in the face of low temperatures, and concluded that Scott&#x27;s party had perished.

=== Search journey ===
Cherry-Garrard was eventually appointed record keeper and continued zoological work. The scientific work continued through the winter and it was not until October 1912 that a team led by Atkinson and including Cherry-Garrard was able to head south to ascertain the fate of the South Pole team.

On 12 November, the bodies of Scott, Wilson and Bowers were found in their tent, along with their diaries and records, and geological specimens they had hauled back from the mountains of the interior. Cherry-Garrard was deeply affected, particularly by the deaths of Wilson and Bowers, with whom he had made the journey to Cape Crozier.

== Later life ==

Not long after his return to civilization in February 1913, Cherry-Garrard accompanied Edward Atkinson on his journey to China to assist Atkinson with his investigation on a type of parasitic flatworm that was causing schistosomiasis among British seamen. At the start of the Great War, Cherry-Garrard, along with the help of his mother and sisters, converted Lamer, his family estate, into a field hospital for wounded soldiers returning from the front. Cherry-Garrard journeyed to Belgium in August 1914 with Major Edwin Richardson, a dog trainer who used dogs to sniff out wounded soldiers and founded the British War Dog School, to assist on the front with a pack of bloodhounds. Cherry-Garrard volunteered for this opportunity, in part due to his experience with handling dogs in Antarctica. After this opportunity was cut short, Cherry-Garrard returned to England and was eventually commissioned in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and commanded a squadron of armoured cars in Flanders. Invalided out in 1916, he suffered from clinical depression as well as ulcerative colitis which had developed shortly after returning from Antarctica. His lifespan preceded the description and diagnosis of what is now called post-traumatic stress disorder.

Although his psychological condition was never cured, the explorer was able to treat himself to some extent by writing down his experiences, although he spent many years bed-ridden due to his afflictions. He required repeated dental treatment because of the damage done to his teeth by the extreme cold. He many times revisited the question of what possible alternative choices and actions might have saved the South Pole team — most notably in his 1922 memoir &quot;The Worst Journey in the World&quot;.

On 6 September 1939, Cherry-Garrard married Angela Katherine Turner (1916–2005), whom he had met during a Norwegian cruise in 1937. They had no children. After the Second World War, ill health and taxes forced him to sell his family estate and move to a flat in London, where he died in Piccadilly on 18 May 1959. He is buried in the north-west corner of the churchyard of St Helen&#x27;s Church, Wheathampstead.

== Writings ==

In 1922, encouraged by his friend George Bernard Shaw, Cherry-Garrard wrote &quot;The Worst Journey in the World&quot;. Over 80 years later this book is still in print and is often cited as a classic of travel literature, having been acclaimed as the greatest true adventure story ever written. It was published as Penguin Books&#x27; 100th publication. As Scott was still considered a hero in postwar Britain at the time of the book&#x27;s publication, there was some criticism of the book upon release which were aimed at Cherry&#x27;s descriptions of the negative qualities and traits of Scott. In an article in &quot;The Times&quot;, one critic said of the book that &#x27;he has evidently, quite in the postwar manner resolved to say what he thinks and emphasize the &quot;heroism&quot; of the story as little as possible.&#x27; More recently, however, Roland Huntford has dismissed the &quot;Worst Journey&quot; as &quot;an immature but persuasive, highly charged apologia&quot;.

Cherry-Garrard contributed an essay in remembrance of T. E. Lawrence in the first edition of a volume edited by Lawrence&#x27;s brother, A. W. Lawrence, &quot;T. E. Lawrence, by His Friends&quot;. Subsequent abridged editions omit his article. Cherry-Garrard hypothesises in this essay that Lawrence undertook extraordinary acts out of a sense of inferiority and cowardice and a need to prove himself. He suggests, too, that Lawrence&#x27;s writings – as well as Cherry&#x27;s own – were therapeutic and helped in dealing with the nervous breakdown of the events they recount.

== Legacy ==
The igloo on Cape Crozier was discovered by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1957–1958. Only of the stone walls remained standing. Relics were removed and placed in museums in New Zealand.

The three penguin eggs brought back from Cape Crozier are now in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London.

Cherry-Garrard was portrayed by Barry Letts in the 1948 film &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot;, by Hugh Grant in the 1985 television serial &quot;The Last Place on Earth&quot;, and by Mark Gatiss in the 2007 television docudrama &quot;The Worst Journey in the World&quot;.

<text>Cement shoes, concrete shoes, or Chicago overcoat is a method of murder or body disposal, usually associated with criminals such as the Mafia or gangs. It involves weighing down the victim, who may be dead or alive, with concrete and throwing them into water in the hope the body will never be found. In the US, the term has become a tongue-in-cheek euphemism for a threat of death by criminals. While a common trope in fiction, only one real-life case has ever been authenticated.

== Cement shoes==

Cement shoes involve first binding, incapacitating or killing the victim and then placing each foot into a bucket or box, which is then filled with wet concrete (a mixture of cement powder, rock, water and sand), or even simply cement powder and water. Typically in films and novels, the victim is still alive as they watch the concrete harden, heightening the torture and drama. After the concrete sets, the victim is thrown into a body of water such as a river, lake or the ocean.

== Real-life incidents ==
Despite being a theme in Hollywood movies like &quot;Lady in Cement&quot; and books like E. L. Doctorow&#x27;s &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot;, whether such a cumbersome and time-consuming method of execution was practical remained in question. Cement takes many hours or even days to fully harden and, until 2016, there was never a documented case—although crime historian Thomas Reppetto said there have probably been real-life examples that have never been found.

In May 2016, the first and only documented case of &quot;cement shoes&quot; was reported. The body of Brooklyn gang member Peter Martinez, aged 28, better known on the streets as Petey Crack, washed up near Manhattan Beach in Brooklyn. His head was wrapped in duct tape, the immediate cause of his death. His feet and shins were encased in concrete set inside a bucket. His body floated to the shore due to air in the concrete because it was not given enough time to dry before being thrown into the ocean.

Concrete has been used as a weight to dispose of a body. In 1941, the body of Philadelphia racketeer Johnnie Goodman was found by a crab fisherman in a New Jersey creek, weighed down with an block of concrete. On August 24, 1964, the body of Ernest Rupolo, aged 52, a trigger man who informed on Vito Genovese in 1944, was found in Jamaica Bay, New York, with concrete blocks tied to his legs. It is also speculated that bootlegger Rocco Perri was murdered by being fitted with cement shoes and thrown into Hamilton Harbour in 1944.

The French Army used cement shoes on Algerians who were murdered on so-called &quot;death flights&quot; during the Algerian War. The victims were called &quot;&quot; &#x27;Bigeard shrimp&#x27; after General Marcel Bigeard, who ordered the procedure. Bigeard put his victims&#x27; feet in a basin, poured quick-setting cement in and threw the person into the sea from the top of a helicopter, said Paul Teitgen, secretary general of the French police in Algiers in 1957, and notable opponent of torture during the war.

==Parodies==
A Far Side cartoon parodied the practice, depicting a fish given &quot;Styrofoam shoes&quot; in order to &quot;sleep with the humans&quot;, a reference to how drowned people are referred to as &quot;sleeping with the fishes&quot;.

<doc id="861832" wikidata="Q3048772" url="?curid=861832" title="Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia">
<text>The Malaysian People&#x27;s Movement Party (Malay: &quot;Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia&quot;; abbrev: GERAKAN or less commonly as PGRM) is a liberal political party in Malaysia. Formed in 1968, Gerakan gained prominence in the 1969 general election when it defeated the ruling Alliance Party in Penang and won the majority of seats in Penang&#x27;s state legislature. In 1972, Gerakan joined the Alliance Party, which later became Barisan Nasional (BN), the ruling coalition of Malaysia until 2018. It has been a member of Perikatan Nasional (PN) since 2021.

Gerakan played a dominant role in the Penang state legislature from 1969 until 2008. It also enjoyed some success nationally as part of the ruling BN coalition, particularly in the 2004 general election, but Its fortune declined sharply in the 2008 election. Following the fall of BN in the 2018 general election, where Gerakan lost all its seats, it left the coalition. The party joined the then ruling Perikatan Nasional in 2021. It had no representation at the national or state-level until the 2023 Kedah state election, where the party achieved its first electoral victory since 2014. Despite clashes with its coalition allies, the party is perceived to be dependent on continued membership within Perikatan Nasional.

The party is assisted by an affiliated think tank called SEDAR Institute (Socio-Economic Development And Research Institute). The party is a member of the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats. At its height, the party&#x27;s primary source of support came from the country&#x27;s ethnic Chinese who constitute 80% of the party&#x27;s membership, with 15% being Indian, and the remaining spread between Malays and other groups.
== History ==
=== Formation ===
In 1959, the leader of Malaysian Chinese Association Dr. Lim Chong Eu resigned his position as president after conflict with UMNO leader Tunku Abdul Rahman over the allocation of seats in the 1959 general election. Dr Lim requested that MCA be given 40 seats to contest (MCA was allocated 30 seats). He left MCA, and later set up the United Democratic Party in 1962. In 1968, UDP was dissolved and its former members, together with the Labour Party and others, joined force to form a new party Gerakan. The six founders of the party were Professor Syed Hussain Alatas, Dr. Tan Chee Khoon, Dr. J.B.A. Peter, Lim Chong Eu, Professor Wang Gungwu, and V. Veerapan. Although the majority of its supporters were Chinese, the party positioned itself as a Malaysian, non-communal party that received some support from the Indians and Malays. Its pro tem president was Professor Syed Hussein Alatas, and later Lim took over the presidency which lasted until 1980.

=== 1969–2007 ===
The party won the state of Penang in the 1969 general election by taking 16 out of 24 seats, winning control from the MCA. Lim Chong Eu became Penang&#x27;s Chief Minister. Gerakan and the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, which won in Kelantan, were the only parties not then affiliated with the Alliance Party to form a state government in Malaysia. However, due to internal disputes within the party, for example over plan for closer ties with Alliance, the party was split. Many of its members, such as Syed Hussein Alatas, V. David, Veerappen, and Tan Chee Khoon, left to form Parti Keadilan Masyarakat Malaysia (PEKEMAS). The PEKEMAS party however proved to be short-lived, and Gerakan itself became reduced and largely Chinese as many non-Chinese left the party. In 1972, Gerakan joined the Alliance which became Barisan Nasional in 1973.

In 1973, a number of former MCA members from Perak and Selangor who were expelled from the party, including Lim Keng Yaik and Paul Leong Khee Seong, joined Gerakan. In 1980, Lim Chong Eu decided to retire from the post of party president, and Lim Keng Yaik won the presidency over Lim Chong Eu&#x27;s preferred candidate Paul Leong. Lim Keng Yaik stayed as president of Gerakan until he decided to retire in 2007.

Gerakan had continual conflicts with MCA as it challenged MCA&#x27;s position as the main Chinese party within BN. In the 1978 general election, disputes broke out between Gerakan and MCA as seven ex-MCA members (with support from MCA) stood against Gerakan. The party lost some seats but managed to retain its stronghold Penang despite losing its position as the biggest party in Penang. Gerakan also sought to expand its influence in others states, especially in Perak, an effort helped by continued defections from MCA. In 1979, Michael Chen stood against Lee San Choon for the MCA Presidency but lost, then later in 1981 joined Gerakan. He was followed by 120,000 dissidents MCA members, thereby allowing Gerakan to create of new branches and become a nationwide organisation. (Chen however later rejoined MCA after a failed challenge to replace Lim Keng Yaik as leader in 1984). In the 1982 general election, it increased its representation in both the national level (from 4 to 5, out of 7 seats allocated) as well as state level (from 12 to 15).

Before the 1986 general election, Gerakan came into conflict with UMNO when it was suggested that a Malay, possibly Anwar Ibrahim should replace Lim Chong Eu as Penang Chief Minister after his term expired. Gerakan threatened to resign from BN unless it was allocated more seats. It was then allocated 9 seats, it nevertheless lost 4 of these, thereby ending with the same number of seats (5). It also saw increased pressure from Democratic Action Party which increased its representation in the Penang state assembly and overtook Gerakan as the second largest party in the state.

In the 1990 general election, it suffered a setback when Lim Chong Eu was defeated by Lim Kit Siang of Democratic Action Party in his Padang Kota constituency, after which Lim Chong Eu retired from politics. Nevertheless, Gerakan retained the post of Chief Minister of Penang with Dr. Koh Tsu Koon taking over the position. In the 1995 general election, Gerakan bounced back, winning 7 parliamentary seats and 23 state seats.

For nearly four decades, from 1969 to 2008, although not necessarily the biggest party (UMNO was the biggest party in Penang for many years from the late 1970s onward), Gerakan played a dominant role in the Penang State Legislature, and became closely associated with the fortune of Penang. In that time there had been only two chief ministers in Penang, Lim and Koh Tsu Koon, both from Gerakan. In 1996, in an attempt to win broader support, the party shifted its headquarter to Kuala Lumpur.

In the 2004 general election, Gerakan achieved its best electoral result, winning 10 parliamentary seats and 30 state seats. On 27 August 2005, its president Lim Keng Yaik was challenged by the Deputy Kerk Choo Ting in its party election. Lim retained his party President post after winning with 983 votes against 628 votes for Kerk. Koh Tsu Koon became the new Deputy President which he won unopposed after the nomination day for the party election.

=== 2008–2017 ===
In 2008, Lim Keng Yaik retired from politics after relinquishing the post of party president in 2007. Koh Tsu Koon took over as acting president in 2007, and won the presidency uncontested in the 2008 party elections.

In the 2008 general election, the party suffered its worst electoral defeat. The party retained only two parliament seats, compared to the 10 seats it had before the election. As a result, the party lost its only cabinet post in the ensuing cabinet shuffle. In addition, Gerakan also lost power in Penang after governing the state for almost 39 years. Soon after the defeat, a number of prominent members, such as Tan Kee Kwong and Lee Kah Choon, went over to the opposition coalition Pakatan Rakyat to take up posts with Opposition-led state governments in Penang and Selangor.

After the dismal performance in the 12th general election, Gerakan launched a party rejuvenation campaign in conjunction with the party&#x27;s 40th anniversary celebrations on 25 May 2008 in its bid to rebound in mainstream politics and to regain people&#x27;s confidence. It outlined three main thrusts, namely to voice Gerakan&#x27;s ideology, policy position and advocate Malaysian solutions for various major issues, to rebuild, rebrand and re-empower the party at all levels, and to regain people&#x27;s confidence. The party also launched a new slogan, &quot;Forward Together with One Heart&quot; (Satu Hati Gerak Bersama), and set out its area of concerns and strategies.

In the 2013 general election, the party failed to improve its position and losing one its two remaining parliamentary seats. Later in the year, Mah Siew Keong took over as president after beating Penang Gerakan chairman Teng Chang Yeow for the post. In 2016, for the first time in history, the President of BN did not attend the annual general meeting of Gerakan and instead briefly appeared on video for 2 minutes.

=== 2018–present ===

In the 2018 general election, Gerakan failed to win any seat and therefore had no representation in Parliament for the first time. On 23 June 2018, the party unanimously decided to leave BN in the aftermath of the election. Following the party&#x27;s departure from Barisan Nasional, the party contested in the 2019 Tanjung Piai by-election, which it lost. It joined the Perikatan Nasional coalition in February 2021.

Gerakan contested the 2022 Malaysian general election as part of the Perikatan Nasional coalition. However, it again failed to win any seat in the parliamentary or state elections. However, the party won a seat in the 2023 Kedah state election, which is the party&#x27;s first electoral victory since the 2014 Telok Intan by-election.

<doc id="861836" wikidata="Q7278455" url="?curid=861836" title="Rab C. Nesbitt">
<text>Rab C. Nesbitt is a Scottish comedy television series that originally aired between 1988 and 1999. The show returned for a one–off special in 2008, before being re-commissioned in 2010. Its second run was broadcast from 2010 to 2014. The series has been described as &quot;Glasgow&#x27;s greatest ever sitcom&quot; by BBC Two.

Produced by BBC Scotland, it focuses on the title character, Robert &quot;Rab&quot; C. Nesbitt (portrayed by Gregor Fisher), an alcoholic Glaswegian who seeks unemployment as a lifestyle choice. Rab C. Nesbitt was originally a recurring character in the BBC2 sketch series &quot;Naked Video&quot; (1986–1990).

The revived series broadcast attracted an audience figure of 2 million. At its peak, &quot;Rab C. Nesbitt&quot; attracted viewing figures of roughly 5 million.

== Background ==
The pilot episode, made for BBC Scotland in 1988, was a Christmas special entitled &quot;Rab C Nesbitt&#x27;s Seasonal Greet&quot;, which was broadcast on 22 December 1988 and then repeated on the network the following year. The first series began on 27 September 1990 and continued for seven more, ending on 18 June 1999. The show returned for a one-off special on 23 December 2008. The special saw several developments for Rab, which would eventually carry on into the revived series which would be broadcast firstly in 2010. In the special episode broadcast in 2008, Gash now has a daughter, Peaches; Mary and Ella have set up in business together as cleaners (and Jamesie, Rab and sometimes Gash all work for their company, House Mice); and Rab himself has converted to Christianity and given up alcohol.

A ninth series of six episodes began airing on 21 January 2010. The show&#x27;s return received a good critical response and high audience figures, leading to a tenth series being commissioned by the BBC for broadcast in 2011. Filming for the series commenced in February 2010, and began broadcasting in October 2011. Following a two-year break, Elaine C. Smith confirmed on her Twitter page that a new year&#x27;s special had completed filming on 10 October 2013, and was aired on BBC Two on 2 January 2014.

Ian Pattison created and wrote all 65 episodes, and Colin Gilbert produced and directed all 65 episodes as well. Topics include alcoholism, Neo Nazis and sexually transmitted infections. Often several normally unapproachable subjects were used in the same episode. The series is also known for its uncompromising use of Glaswegian accents and dialect, and its technique of breaking the fourth wall by frequently having Rab address the viewer directly.

The series has featured guest appearances from the likes of Norman Lovett, Peter Mullan, Rikki Fulton, Mary Lee, Anita Dobson, Timothy Spall, Stanley Baxter, Kevin McNally, Clive Russell, Jerry Sadowitz, Viv Lumsden, Sylvester McCoy, Russell Hunter, Peter Capaldi and then-unknowns David Tennant, Ashley Jensen, Ford Kiernan, Greg Hemphill, Karen Dunbar, Elaine Ellis, Jane McCarry and Paul Riley. Series 10 episode 2 notably featured an appearance by Scottish singer Susan Boyle, who was the runner-up on &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; in 2009.

The series was taken live on tour in 1991, known as &quot;Rab C. Nesbitt: In the Flesh&quot;, thus meaning that no new series was broadcast that year. A live recording of the tour was released on VHS in 1992 as &quot;Rab C. Nesbitt: Live&quot;. Two script books accompanying the series have also been released, alongside Rab&#x27;s autobiography, a novel entitled &quot;A Stranger Here Myself&quot;.

== Cast and characters ==

=== Nesbitt family ===

; Robert &quot;Rab&quot; C. Nesbitt: Gregor Fisher (1988–2014). An alcoholic without denial, sarcastic, deadbeat, self-styled &quot;street philosopher&quot; and &quot;sensitive big bastard&quot;, although &quot;sensitive by Govan standards&quot;. Described by his wife Mary as not &quot;&quot;an&quot; unemployed person&quot; but &quot;&quot;the original&quot; unemployed person&quot;, Rab is very rarely seen in anything other than a shabby pinstripe suit, plimsolls, a filthy headband and a string vest. He has two sons, Gash and Burney. Rab has four brothers, all dead; Rab only survived because he was the only one out of the five who was able to understand the benefits form. He claims to have been talented as a teenager, but never went anywhere with it due to Govan-dwellers being scared of talent when they saw it and tried &quot;tae batter it tae death wi&#x27; empty wine bottles&quot;. At some point before the episode &quot;Clean&quot; he managed to clean up his act, giving up alcohol, helping around the house, finding religion, and presiding over a temperance group; so far he has only relapsed on-screen twice. He is also shown to break the fourth wall.
; Mary &quot;Mary Doll&quot; Nesbitt: Elaine C. Smith (1988–2014). Rab&#x27;s long-suffering wife, more functional and aspirational than her husband. Claims that on the day she was born it was a toss-up whether she or the dog&#x27;s litter would end up at the bottom of the river Clyde in a sack (Burney: &quot;She won. There&#x27;s nae bloody justice, eh?&quot;). Currently runs a successful house-cleaning business with Ella Cotter called the &quot;House Mice&quot;. Mary has repeatedly split up with Rab over the course of the show as has often flirted with other townsfolk to try to get back at him. However, somehow, she and Rab always seem to get back to together, usually for the sake of the &quot;weans&quot; (&quot;little ones&quot;). Mary has had a lot of odd-jobs over the years, often taken as a quickie to pay off a final demand bill or outstanding arrears. Mary has stuck by Rab through many tough situations over the years.
; Gash Nesbitt: Andrew Fairlie until 2008, Iain Robertson 2010–2024 (1988–2014). The Nesbitts&#x27; elder son. Described by his father as &quot;so anal-retentive he&#x27;s still shitein&#x27; rusks.&quot; Has dabbled with Christianity, hard drugs, Hare Krishna, Scottish nationalism, and ram-raiding BT shops in his efforts to find himself. He has an on-off girlfriend, Bridie, and by the time of the show&#x27;s return, now has a teenage daughter, Peaches, whom the Nesbitts dote upon. Rab has often taken more interest in Gash than his other son, Burney, and seems to favour Gash as he doesn&#x27;t give as much lip. Fairlie left the role following the 2008 special, and Robertson was re-cast in the role and appeared from 2010.
; Burney Nesbitt: Eric Cullen (1988–1993). The Nesbitts&#x27; younger son, who briefly dabbled with neo-Nazism. Was also discovered to be gifted at painting, although gave up this avenue when he realised it wasn&#x27;t getting him any sex. Burney often gave his father more grief than his brother, and often became more of a nuisance in his father&#x27;s eyes. Actor Eric Cullen left the programme following series three due to personal issues, and was replaced by David McKay&#x27;s Screech. Cullen died in 1996, shortly after he was asked to return to the role of Burney for the 1997 series. In the 2008 Christmas special, it is revealed that Burney died in a &quot;ramming&quot; accident and was buried nearby.
; Screech Nesbitt: David McKay (1994–1997). Rab&#x27;s nephew, who replaces Eric Cullen&#x27;s Burney from 1994. Screech comes to live with the Nesbitts after Burney goes to live in at a boarding school. Screech is much more outspoken that his predecessor, and has much more of a rebellious side. He seems to get along with Gash better than Burney did. Actor David McKay earlier portrayed Young Young McGurn&#x27;s son Bimbo in &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot;, and was cast in the role of Screech following his initial appearance in 1992. McKay left the role in 1997.

=== Cotter family ===

; James Aaron &quot;Jamesie&quot; Cotter: Tony Roper (1988–2014). Rab&#x27;s longtime friend, as well as chronic serial philanderer and self-described &#x27;scumbag&#x27;. Jamesie is always seen with his trademark shabby sports jacket and bottle of Irn-Bru. On one occasion, he was described by his wife as &quot;a slippery-lookin&#x27; article, about 93-year-old, wearing crusty jeans, with the eyes of an unemployed rapist&quot;. On several occasions he has played the part of the devil on Rab&#x27;s shoulder, urging him to take up drinking again in &quot;Clean&quot;. His attitude towards women (he is very keen on having sexual relations with any number of women but refuses to trust them) is implied to have stemmed from a traumatic relationship with his cancer-ridden mother; he spent much of his childhood tending to her, receiving little but abuse in return. It was known that he was once a football player until sustaining a shoulder injury which had forced him to quit.
; Ella Cotter: Barbara Rafferty (1988–2014). Jamesie&#x27;s fiery wife, with her red beehive haircut and leopard skin coat. Seems to loathe her husband and frequently considers murdering him. In the meantime, she enjoys torturing him on occasion, notably breaking his shoulder with a crowbar and scratching his sunburnt chest. She has stabbed him at least once. She is every bit as promiscuous as Jamesie. She is part of a house-cleaning business with Mary, called The House Mice. Ella and Jamesie have never had children, due to the fact that Ella had gynaecological problems, a fact which Jamesie cruelly rubs in her face when he gets another woman pregnant.

=== Pub regulars ===

; Andra: Brian Pettifer (1988–2014). One of Rab&#x27;s best friends, described more than once as looking &quot;like a Ninja Turtle&quot;. Married to a woman called Bobbie whom he finds so repulsive that he dry heaves when thinking about sleeping with her. Andra has a comb-over haircut and is often mocked for being less adventurous than his counterparts. Andra was a regular in the Two Ways Inn before its closure, and quickly transferred his custom to the Giblet. Pettifer reprised the role for the 2014 special, the only pub regular to appear in the episode.
; Dodie: Alex Norton in 1988, Iain McColl from 1990–2011 (1988–2011). Another of Rab&#x27;s best friends. Dodie is implied to be fond of unconventional methods of intoxication, e.g. sniffing shoe polish, and had an interest in crossdressing also. He too, like Andra, has an insufferable wife whom he loathes and he retches when he thinks about sleeping with her. Dodie did not appear in the 2008 special or Series 9. He also did not appear in the 2014 special, as McColl had died in 2013 following complications from a cancer diagnosis. McColl was not replaced in the role.
; Dougie: Charlie Sim (1988–1992). The barman of the Two Ways Inn. He was the original owner of the pub before handing the pub over to Norrie following his retirement. Dougie was much more bitter and sour than his successor, and was less tolerant of the acts of the pub regulars than his successor. Sims left the role in 1992 and was replaced by Kazek in the role of Norrie.
; Norrie: John Kazek (1992–1999). The barman of the Two Ways Inn. Norrie takes over the running of the pub after Dougie gives up the job. Norrie is much more tolerant but often steps in when violence is about to break out. Norrie has more of a sensitive side and is willing to show some sympathy when required. He tries to update the pub with foreign grub and games machines. Before he worked in the pub, he was a psychiatric nurse.
; Camille: Cora Bissett (2010–2014). The barmaid of The Giblet since its opening in 2010. During the episode &quot;Passion&quot;, she was the object of both Gash and Jamesie&#x27;s affections. Bisset did not appear in the 2014 special. Again, it is not known whether she had left the role or was unavailable at the time of filming. She replaced Kazek when he decided not to return to the series.

=== Recurring cast ===

; Hugh &quot;Shug&quot;: Sean Scanlan (1990–1999). Mary&#x27;s maternal cousin, Hugh feigns Englishness or at least pretends to be a middle-class Scot due to Scottish cultural cringe and to the distaste displayed at anything working-class and/or Scottish by his wife Phoebe. Hugh is Mary&#x27;s cousin, and moved to Sidcup at some point in the 1980s.
; Phoebe: Sara Corper until 1993, Sarah Crowden until 1996, Juliet Cadzow in 1999 (1990–1999). An extremely middle-class English woman, married to Hugh. Phoebe is ashamed of his Scottish roots and often displays her disgust when his heritage begins to show.
; Bridie: Nicola Park (1998–2011). Gash&#x27;s on-off girlfriend, with whom he has a daughter, Peaches. Bridie first appeared in Series 8, and returned to the role for the ninth and tenth series. Again, Park did not appear in the 2014 special, and it is unknown whether Park has left the role or was unavailable for filming.
; Peaches Nesbitt: Rachael Crossan (until 2011), Anna Devitt (2011–2014). Gash and Bridie&#x27;s daughter, upon whom all the Nesbitts dote. Peaches is a teenager by the time of the 2014 special. Crossan originally portrayed Peaches for series nine and ten. However, she did not return for the 2014 special and Devitt was cast in the role instead, making her first appearance.

<text>The Constitutional Union (; ; ) is a political party in Morocco aligned with the ruling monarchy. The party has a history of cooperating with two other parties with a liberal orientation, the National Rally of Independents and the Popular Movement, since 1993.

==History==
The grouping was founded by then Prime Minister Maati Bouabid in 1983 and favoured by King Hassan II. In the 1984 parliamentary election, it won the greatest number of seats, but remained far from an absolute majority. Later it became an ordinary party without a special role in Morocco&#x27;s multi-party system.

The party is a full member of Liberal International, which it joined at the latter&#x27;s Dakar Congress in 2003. Its electoral symbol is a horse.

In the parliamentary election held on 27 September 2002, the party won 16 out of 325 seats. In the next parliamentary election, held on 7 September 2007, the party won 27 out of 325 seats. The party won 23 out of 325 seats in the parliamentary election held in November 2011, being the seventh party in the parliament.

<text>The Popular Movement (; ) is a royalist and traditionalist rural-focused political party in Morocco. It is a member of Liberal International. The party has a history of cooperating with two other parties with a liberal orientation, the National Rally of Independents and the Constitutional Union, since 1993.

==History==
The Popular Movement was founded in 1957 by the Berber tribal chief Mahjoubi Aherdane with help from Abdelkrim al-Khatib who founded later a splinter party (&quot;Mouvement populaire démocratique et constitutionnel&quot;) that became the Justice and Development Party. It was initially a rural party with conservative and tribal orientation, that unconditionally supported the monarchy and aimed at countering nationalist Istiqlal Party. Although the party has been dominated by Berber speakers, it has not developed a distinct Berber agenda.

The present party results from a 25 March 2006 merger between the main party which had kept the original name and two splinter parties, the National Popular Movement (&quot;Mouvement National Populaire&quot;) and the Democratic Union (Union démocratique).

The party is a full member of Liberal International, which it joined at the latter&#x27;s Dakar Congress in 2003.

In the parliamentary election held on 27 September 2002, the party won 27 out of the total 325 seats. It improved its standing in the parliamentary election held on 7 September 2007, winning 41 out of 325 seats.

The party won 32 out of 325 seats in the parliamentary election held in November 2011, being the sixth party in the parliament.

<doc id="861848" wikidata="Q6928401" url="?curid=861848" title="List of Porridge characters">
<text>Porridge is a British sitcom, starring Ronnie Barker and Richard Beckinsale, written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, and broadcast on BBC1 from 1974 to 1977. The programme ran for three series and two Christmas specials, and was followed by a feature film of the same name (in the United States, the film was released under the title &quot;Doing Time&quot;).

The sitcom focuses on two prison inmates, Norman Stanley Fletcher (played by Barker) and Lennie Godber (played by Beckinsale), who are serving time at the fictional HMP Slade in Cumberland.

Several characters from &quot;Porridge&quot; reappear in the sequel series &quot;Going Straight&quot; (1978) and in the 2003 spoof documentary &quot;Life Beyond the Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher&quot;. The 2016 &#x27;reboot&#x27; series of &quot;Porridge&quot; has a different cast of characters, including Nigel Norman Fletcher, grandson of Norman Stanley Fletcher in the original series.

==Overview==
==Mr Barrowclough==
Henry Barrowclough is a prison officer portrayed by Brian Wilde. Unlike Mr Mackay, whose harsh and confrontational methods he disapproves of (though he dare not make this known to Mr Mackay), Barrowclough is a timid, sympathetic man who firmly believes that the role of prison is to rehabilitate rather than punish. He does not share Mackay&#x27;s tough military background, having done his National Service in Royal Air Force stores in the comfortable surroundings of Singapore.

Mr Barrowclough does not seem to be cut out for the life of a prison officer, and he says in the movie version whilst in conversation with a new officer that Slade prison (the officer&#x27;s club at least) is a &quot;miserable place&quot; and that the only reason he stays is that it keeps him away from being at home with his wife. Fletcher and the other prisoners constantly abuse his leniency to acquire more pleasant jobs, cells or special privileges. They also know how to forge his signature. However, despite this, the prisoners do hold a great deal of fondness for Barrowclough. At one point, in an attempt to raise his prestige due to the vicious nature of Mr. Wainwright, the temporary replacement for Mr Mackay, they stage a riot, refusing to stop for even the harshest of threats, including Wainwright himself. But when, on Fletch&#x27;s suggestion, Barrowclough is called into the hall, they fall silent as he nervously enters, and do not hesitate in obeying his rather timid requests, such as, &quot;Now, why don&#x27;t you all put those things down...?&quot; and, &quot;In the meantime, why don&#x27;t we all file back to our cells in a nice, orderly fashion...?&quot;

However nervous his job makes Mr Barrowclough, it is nothing compared to the fear he has of his oft-mentioned but never seen wife, Alice. It is partly because of Fletcher&#x27;s advice on dealing with his wife that Barrowclough is especially accommodating when dealing with his requests and misdemeanours. Fletcher once described him as looking like &quot;Arthur Askey on stilts&quot;.

==Ingrid Fletcher==
Ingrid Rita Godber (née Fletcher) was played by Patricia Brake. Ingrid is Fletch&#x27;s eldest child (allegedly conceived against Karl Marx&#x27;s tomb). She often visited her father in Slade Prison, oblivious to her appeal to the other inmates, much to her father&#x27;s despair. It was on one of these trips that she met Fletch&#x27;s cellmate Godber. Upon Godber&#x27;s release the two met up, and by the time Fletch was released, three years later, the two were engaged. They were married in the final episode of &quot;Going Straight&quot; and are seen to be still married 25 years later in the spoof documentary, &quot;Life Beyond the Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher&quot;, with one son.

==Norman Stanley Fletcher==

Norman Stanley Fletcher was played by Ronnie Barker. Known as &quot;Fletch&quot;, he is the main character in the series and shares a cell with Lennie Godber. A habitual criminal from north London, Fletch has previously served several terms of imprisonment.

==Lennie Godber==

Leonard Arthur &quot;Lennie&quot; Godber was played by Richard Beckinsale. Godber is from Birmingham, supports Aston Villa, has an O Level in geography, and studies for a history O Level while in prison. Before he was arrested he shared a flat with his girlfriend Denise in nearby Smethwick. In an effort to help her furnish her new apartment, Godber broke into a neighbour&#x27;s flat. He was caught, and it was for this that he was sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment. Denise later broke up with Godber through a Dear John letter.

Godber often came into conflict with the ever suspicious Mr Mackay, who appeared to find it very hard to believe that Lennie was not up to something. Even when he was, MacKay found it very hard to pin anything on him, thanks to Godber&#x27;s penchant for dramatics, and, occasionally, to the cover-up efforts of Fletch and the sympathetic Mr Barrowclough. Godber works in the prison kitchen where he has ample opportunities to steal valuable commodities, such as butter and pineapple chunks, which Fletcher is fond of. Godber also briefly took up a career as a boxer in the prison, although this was short-lived when he became involved in match fixing.

Godber appears in all but four episodes of &quot;Porridge&quot;. He is absent from the pilot (&quot;Prisoner and Escort&quot;) series 1 episodes &quot;Ways and Means&quot; and &quot;Men Without Women&quot;, and series 2&#x27;s &quot;No Peace for the Wicked&quot;. In the sequel &quot;Going Straight&quot;, Godber is engaged to Fletcher&#x27;s daughter Ingrid, having met her whilst she was on a prison visit. In the final episode, they get married. In the 2003 mockumentary &quot;Life Beyond the Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher&quot;, they are still married, and have a son. Richard Beckinsale died in 1979, so Godber&#x27;s absence from the mockumentary is explained by a phone call to his wife saying he was stuck in traffic.

==Harry Grout==
&quot;Genial&quot; Harry Grout, also referred to as &#x27;Grouty&#x27;, is feared by all prisoners. His schemes include running a drugs ring funded by the doctor&#x27;s office and fixing boxing matches. If crossed, Grouty has little hesitation in setting one of his various heavies on those who displease him. Grouty also arranges things such as prison breaks, as seen in the Christmas special &quot;No Way Out,&quot; in which the major plot involves his trying to arrange a breakout plan, with much help from an unwilling Fletcher.

In the 2003 mockumentary &quot;Life Beyond The Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher&quot;, it is revealed that after being released from prison Grouty continued running his &quot;business empire&quot; (although he insisted it was now straight, and no one could prove otherwise), and also became a &quot;celebrity criminal&quot;, in a similar manner to Frankie Fraser and The Krays. He died of a heart attack, but just before he died, he told Fletcher where his stash was hidden. Fletcher is seen laying a memorial wreath at his funeral which simply says &quot;Nerk&quot;.

==Cyril Heslop==
Cyril Heslop was played by Brian Glover. Heslop is prominent in Season 1 of the show and was briefly Fletcher&#x27;s cellmate. He was also one of the three new arrivals, along with Fletcher and Godber, into Slade Prison in the first episode of the series, having been given three years for breaking and entering. Heslop is quite dim and slow-witted, once being described by Mr. Mackay as &quot;thick as two short planks.&quot;

This is also demonstrated in the fact that he is always several minutes behind every conversation, such as laughing at jokes made some time earlier or making remarks to or asking questions about a subject that was talked about many minutes ago, when the conversation has moved on. Heslop is also known among the prison inmates for his interesting anecdotes, many of which relate to events which took place &quot;at the wife&#x27;s sister&#x27;s in Sidcup&quot;, which he launches into at random moments, with every inmate present ending their conversation to listen to him. It is mentioned in his first appearance his birthday was on 1 April, which Fletcher considers to be &quot;quite fitting&quot; for him.

==Lukewarm==
Lukewarm was played by Christopher Biggins. Lukewarm is a rotund young man with a calm and personable demeanour, who originates from the Midlands (though during the series, and in &quot;Going Straight&quot; he is said to be from Middlesbrough). The circumstances that brought him to be in prison are unknown, although in one episode – the &quot;Porridge&quot; Christmas Special, &quot;No Way Out&quot; – he relieved Mr Barrowclough of his watch in a manner strongly suggestive of a pickpocket. He is openly gay, and his partner Trevor is a watch repairer from Southport; Trevor appears in the episode &quot;Men Without Women&quot;. Lukewarm shared a cell with the elderly Blanco, over whom he would fuss a lot, especially when Blanco was due to face the parole board. Blanco did concede that, for all his fussing, Lukewarm did keep the cell nice and clean. Lukewarm is often seen knitting.

Although he is a trusted friend and confidant of Fletcher&#x27;s, he seldom becomes directly involved in his schemes, preferring instead to spend his association time observing the latest goings-on whilst busying himself with his latest knitting projects. He works in the kitchens alongside Godber and is an enthusiastic if notoriously untalented cook, although it was said that he did make good pasties. Lukewarm was released three months prior to Fletcher in &quot;Going Straight&quot;. Fletcher mentions to McLaren that he received a letter from Lukewarm, stating his case is coming up after he was accused of stealing a woman&#x27;s handbag, which he claimed was his own. In the mockumentary &quot;Life Beyond The Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher&quot;, his real name is revealed as being Timothy Underwood, although in &quot;Just Desserts&quot; he appears to be addressed by a warder as Lewis. It is stated that he is now married to Trevor and living in Denmark.

==Jim McLaren==
Jim &quot;Jock&quot; McLaren is played by Tony Osoba. Along with Godber and Warren, McLaren is a regular conspirator with and confidant of Fletcher. A mixed race young man from Greenock, Scotland, he claims to have been adopted. Subjected to racist abuse when he first arrived at Slade Prison, he was aggressive and hostile. Fletcher (who called him &quot;Jock&quot;) was tasked with enabling him to defeat such abuse and provocation, and to encourage his intelligence and resourcefulness. A keen football player (and fan of perennial Scottish League underdogs Greenock Morton), McLaren was soon turning out every Saturday afternoon for the inter-wing football matches. He is the last of their circle to be released, and Fletcher is seen bidding him farewell in the first episode of &quot;Going Straight&quot;. In &quot;Life Beyond The Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher&quot;, McLaren is a member of the Scottish Parliament.

==&quot;Bunny&quot; Warren==
&quot;Bunny&quot; Warren is played by Sam Kelly. Warren is a trusted friend of Fletcher, Godber and McLaren, and frequently joins in with their schemes. He was imprisoned for burglary, after being caught due to his inability to read a sign saying &quot;Warning: burglar alarm&quot;. Fletcher and Godber frequently remark about his low intellect and Warren is self-conscious of his illiteracy - particularly his inability to read letters from his wife - and sometimes wistfully muses on his desire to (at least try to) learn &quot;new things&quot;.

==Mr Mackay==
Mr Mackay is played by Fulton Mackay. Mackay is a tough prison officer whose constant obsession in life is to catch Fletcher out. Mackay has the authority to make decisions affecting the entire wing, such as banning Christmas celebrations in the episode &quot;No Way Out&quot;, so is presumably the wing&#x27;s senior officer. Fletch&#x27;s sly tactics in misdeeds ranging from fixing boxing matches, stealing pills from the prison doctor and eggs from the prison farmyard right through to finding new and imaginative ways to stick two fingers up at Mackay and get away with it, were specially designed to get up Mackay&#x27;s nose. In return, Mackay&#x27;s frenzied attempts to catch Fletch out, when fruitful, gave Mackay a level of smugness and satisfaction which was only accentuated by Fletch&#x27;s hostility and skulking.

Born into a poor family, Mackay went on to be a drill sergeant (though in &quot;Going Straight&quot; this is changed to Warrant Officer Class 2) in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and ran a boarding house in Peebles with his wife, Marie, before joining the prison service. Mackay&#x27;s temper is agitated by the constant suspicion he has of Fletcher, and his despair at the leniency of his optimistic, mild-mannered, kind-hearted colleague Mr Barrowclough. Mackay&#x27;s homeland of Scotland serves as a constant source of entertainment for Fletcher, who is always on the lookout for an opportunity to antagonise Mackay. In one episode Mackay asks Fletcher whether he felt he was working class. Fletcher responds, &quot;I did, until I visited Glasgow. Now I think I&#x27;m middle class.&quot;

Mackay appears in the first episode of &quot;Going Straight&quot;, where it is revealed he has left Slade Prison after reaching the compulsory retirement age for prison officers. He shares the same train as Fletcher and the two end up crossing paths. Though they are initially hostile to each other when Fletcher realises that he has retired, Fletcher later inadvertently saves Mackay from accidentally getting involved in a criminal operation and framed. Mackay subsequently parts ways with Fletcher on better terms, and shakes his hand for the first and final time.

===Medals===
During the series Mackay regularly wore his army service ribbons on his uniform. During the run of the series he wore the General Service Medal 1918–1962, the Korea Medal, and the UN Korea Medal. For the film this was inexplicably expanded to an additional row containing the 1939–1945 Star, the Defence Medal, the War Medal 1939–1945, and lastly the Jubilee Medal, 1977, which was awarded on the 25th anniversary of Elizabeth II&#x27;s rule.




==Harris==
Harris is a prisoner played by Ronald Lacey. A middle-aged Teddy Boy with a fish face and ginger hair, Harris – much like &quot;Horrible&quot; Ives – is loathed by prison officers and prisoners alike. His sly manner, cowardice, and utter lack of integrity – accompanied by an insistently oleaginous manner – irritates even the easy-going, lukewarm and emollient Mr Barrowclough. Harris is a thief (an activity taboo inside prison) and a cheat, and bullies anyone whom he deems to be weaker than he is. However, he in turn is dominated by all those above him, such as Harry Grout, Mr Mackay and Fletcher.

He was arrested following a botched attempt to steal an elderly lady&#x27;s handbag, as she had hidden a brick in it, and she succeeded in pinning Harris down until the police arrived.

With the arrival of Judge Rawley at Slade, Harris is relegated to the job of mucking out and feeding the pigs on the prison farm. Later, he, McLaren and another inmate attack Judge Rawley, but are stopped by Fletcher. Harris is then accused of stealing Judge Rawley&#x27;s watch, and Fletcher decides to hold a kangaroo court with Rawley as the judge, Fletcher as the prosecutor and Warren as the defence counsel. However, because Fletcher insisted on a proper enquiry, Rawley has no option but to clear Harris. Harris returns Rawley&#x27;s watch, but with the mechanism removed.

==&quot;Horrible&quot; Ives==
Bernard &quot;Horrible&quot; Ives is a prisoner serving time in Slade for committing fraud. He was played by Ken Jones. Ives is a creep, a cheat and a snitch, universally loathed by the other inmates of Slade Prison. He originated from Liverpool. Almost all his spoken sentences begin with the words &quot;&#x27;ere listen&quot;. Fletcher once commented &quot;Ives is such a loser that if Elizabeth Taylor had triplets, he&#x27;d have been the one in the middle, on the bottle.&quot;

Ives is interviewed in the 2003 mockumentary &quot;Life Beyond the Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher&quot;. While most of the ex-prisoners interviewed are shown to have gone straight, Ives is shown collecting for a fake charity.

==Blanco Webb==
Blanco Webb is played by David Jason. An elderly inmate, Blanco first appears in the episode &quot;No Peace for the Wicked&quot; where he helps Fletcher steal some Jaffa Cakes. He features heavily in the episode &quot;Happy Release&quot; where he and Fletcher are in adjacent beds in the prison hospital, Fletcher having broken his foot and Blanco having been diagnosed with a &quot;tired heart&quot;. Also in the hospital is Norris (played by Colin Farrell) — considered &quot;scum&quot; even by the other inmates — who had managed to con Blanco out of his only possessions: an antique silver snuff box, a Japanese wireless radio, and a musical box that played &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; when opened. Fletcher manages to reacquire Blanco&#x27;s possessions with Godber&#x27;s help, and manages to get Norris, newly released, re-arrested after only one day by tricking him into trying to dig for &quot;treasure&quot; underneath Leeds United&#x27;s Elland Road pitch.

Throughout his lengthy prison sentence, Blanco continued to profess his innocence, and when parole was granted (in the episode &quot;Pardon Me&quot;) he refused, preferring the prospect of dying in prison to that of admitting guilt. When he is finally granted a pardon, Fletcher warns him not to seek revenge on the person who really killed his wife. Blanco responds by telling Fletcher

No. I know &#x27;im wot did it. It were the wife&#x27;s lover. But don&#x27;t worry, I shan&#x27;t go round searching for him, &#x27;e died years ago. That I do know. It were me that killed him!.

This however conflicts with the episode &quot;No Peace for the Wicked&quot;, where it is implied that he was jailed for an armed robbery on a wages van. Despite Blanco being an elderly character, actor David Jason was in his mid-30s when he played him.

<doc id="861863" wikidata="Q3507217" url="?curid=861863" title="Sylvia Daoust">
<text>Sylvia Daoust, CM, CQ RCA (May 24, 1902 – July 19, 2004) was a Canadian sculptor who was one of the first female sculptors in Quebec. She studied at the Council of Arts &amp; Manufactures and the École des Beaux-Arts, with Charles Maillard and Maurice Feliz, and later with Edwin Holgate at the Art Association of Montreal.

She won many notable prizes for her work, which has been exhibited in institutions in the United States, Italy, and Canada. She is known for her portrait sculptures, and for revitalizing the traditions of liturgical art. Daoust was also one of the original members of the organization Le Retable d’Art Sacre, a group that helped transform the state of Roman Catholic churches in French Canada. Daoust died in Montreal in 2004 at the age of 102.

==Life and education==
Daoust was born on May 24, 1902, in Montreal, Quebec, the eldest of seven children. From an early age she began drawing, sketching, painting and also sculpting clay figurines. The figurines caught the eye of the Sisters of St. Anne, who encouraged her to enroll at the École des Beaux-Arts de Québec.

In 1915, she began studying at the Conseil des arts et manufactures with Joseph Franchère, Joseph Saint-Charles and John Young Johnstone. In 1923, Daoust enrolled in the École des beaux arts, which had just recently opened. In 1927, she graduated with a specialized teaching degree in drawing. In 1929, Daoust won the Lord Willingdon Competition, the first-place prize in an inter-provincial competition for sculpture and in the same year received a scholarship to study in France from the province of Québec She studied in France with Henri Charlier.
She returned home in 1930, teaching drawing, anatomy, modeling, and sculpting at the École des Beaux-Arts in Québec City until 1943. Daoust then moved back to Montreal to be a professor of wood and stone sculpting at the Montreal School of Fine Arts (1943–1968).

After her death in 2004, she was buried in the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

== Work ==
The majority of Daoust&#x27;s works are religious in content and form. They have been described as a combination of the formal characteristics of modernism with the austerity of sculpture of the Middle Ages.

While she did extensive work in the classroom, 1948 marked the beginning her career in modernist art alongside fellow artist and peer, Paul-Émile Borduas. During the early 1940s movement of sacred art, she became acquainted with Dom Bello, the architect of Saint Benedict Abbey in Saint-Benoit-du-Lac, Québec. She put aside her pursuit of modernist art and delved into scared art. Dom Bellot was in charge of Saint Joseph&#x27;s Oratory and she worked with his guidance there and in collaboration with Henri Charlier. Her transition into sacred art was marked by the production of approximately thirty wooden statues to which she added colour accents and experimented with different materials such as aluminum and leather. She participated in over twenty exhibits and collectives, although much of her work was not displayed in art galleries.

Daoust was one of the original founding members of &quot;Le Retable d’Art Sacre&quot;, an organization that advocated and promoted the standards of religious art within the Roman Catholic churches in Québec. She continued to sculpt into her 90s, and her last works were for the chapel of the Holy Cross Fathers in Montreal.

== Collections and awards ==
Daoust&#x27;s works are in the collection of the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec, and the National Gallery of Canada, among others.

Her public sculptures include the bronze of Nicolas Viel adorning the façade of the Quebec Legislature (National Assembly), &quot;Mary Queen of the World&quot; at Montreal&#x27;s Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral and a statue of Édouard Montpetit at the Université de Montréal.

In 1942, she won the first prize for &quot;Our Lady of Montreal&quot;, in the competition held on the occasion of the Third Centenary of the Founding Nationale de St. Jean Baptiste. In 1951, she was named to the Royal Canadian Academy of Art and in 1961 she was awarded the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada&#x27;s Allied Arts Award. In 1975, Daoust won the Philippe Hébert Prize by the St. Jean Baptiste Society. In 1976, she was made a member of the Order of Canada and honoured in 1987 as a chevalier of the Ordre national du Québec.

* Allied Arts Medal, Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, 1961.
* Royal Society of Canada
* Order of Canada, 1976

<text>Snort is a free open source network intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS) created in 1998 by Martin Roesch, founder and former CTO of Sourcefire. Snort is now developed by Cisco, which purchased Sourcefire in 2013.

In 2009, Snort entered InfoWorld&#x27;s Open Source Hall of Fame as one of the &quot;greatest [pieces of] open source software of all time&quot;.

==Uses==
Snort&#x27;s open-source network-based intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) has the ability to perform real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Snort performs protocol analysis, content searching and matching.

The program can also be used to detect probes or attacks, including, but not limited to, operating system fingerprinting attempts, semantic URL attacks, buffer overflows, server message block probes, and stealth port scans.

Snort can be configured in three main modes: 1. sniffer, 2. packet logger, and 3. network intrusion detection.

===Sniffer Mode===
The program will read network packets and display them on the console.

===Packet Logger Mode===
In packet logger mode, the program will log packets to the disk.

===Network Intrusion Detection System Mode===
In intrusion detection mode, the program will monitor network traffic and analyze it against a rule set defined by the user. The program will then perform a specific action based on what has been identified.

==Third-party tools==
There are several third-party tools interfacing Snort for administration, reporting, performance and log analysis:
* Snorby – a GPLv3 Ruby on Rails application
* BASE
* Sguil (free)

==Development and production==
The series&#x27; co-creator Douglas Ross thought that summer camp would be the &quot;perfect setting for a reality-based program geared for 9 to 12-year-olds.&quot; Ross, a former camper himself, pitched the idea to the Disney Channel and the then head of programming and production Rich Ross. He was given the green light to create the series without a pilot episode. The location, Camp Waziyatah, was decided a few months before the 1997 camp season started. The producers conducted about 100 phone interviews and 60 home visits before selecting 27 campers. Four camp counselors were chosen from both the camp&#x27;s existing group and 350 members of the public in response to an open call on the Internet. The first season was filmed for 56 days straight by three film crews. The boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; cabins had all male and all female crews, led by directors Donald Bull and Laura Zucco respectively. Over 1,000 hours was shot by two directors, two cameras, and two sound operators.

On July 15, 1999, Disney ordered a second season; it premiered on March 5, 2000. In June 2000, production began on a third season which was announced on July 12; it began airing on June 3, 2001.

<text>Brian Caswell (born 13 January 1954) is an Australian author of young adult fiction.

==Biography==
Brian Caswell was born in a village called Gwernaffield in Wales, on 13 January 1954. His family moved to England, when he was 5 years old. When he was 12, in 1966, Caswell&#x27;s family moved to Australia. He received a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma of Education, and graduated from the University of NSW. In the 1970s, Caswell took up singing and songwriting, and was successful for some years, one of his songs making the top 40 music charts and another winning a &#x27;Golden Guitar&#x27; for song of the year. He became a school teacher in 1976, giving up performing, but continued writing songs.

Caswell taught at several high schools, mainly in the areas of history, English and creative writing. For 15 years he worked as a teacher and basketball coach. He began writing for the students he was teaching, publishing his first book, &quot;Merryll of the Stones&quot;, in 1989. He gave up teaching after his success of his first two books, and began to write full-time. He won the 1995 Children&#x27;s Peace Literature Award for his book, &quot;Deucalion&quot;.

In 1998, he began working with friend and co-author David Chiem, to develop MindChamps – a company established to research the neuroscience and psychology of education and to develop engaging learning strategies in tune with the demands of the 21st century. Since 2007, he has written five books for parents and teachers on different aspects of education and the development of the learning mind.

Caswell lives in Fountaindale, New South Wales, with his wife, Marlene.

=== MindChamps ===
With 45 years of experience as a teacher, author, lecturer and creativity coach, Brian is the Dean of Research and Programme Development at MindChamps. Since MindChamps was founded in Sydney, Australia in 1998, David Chiem and Brian have worked with thousands of young people around the world, and advised and trained thousands more parents, trainers, teachers and education advisors to help them make a difference in the lives of the children under their care.

<text>The Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra or HUC (Hospitals of the University of Coimbra), is a university hospital that partners with the University of Coimbra, Portugal. This complex is known as a centre of research with a broad range of clinical services and medical specialties. It is a branch of the larger Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, a rebranded merged institution created during the eruption of the European sovereign debt crisis and the Portuguese economic and financial crisis in 2012.

==History==
In its early days, it used to function in two separated buildings which can be traced back to the 16th century. Part belonged to the College of St. Jerome begun in the 1560s. In 1836 it was handed over to the University of Coimbra, and twelve years later several hospital departments were transferred there. From then on it was known as the Hospital of St. Jerome. Several features bear witness to its history: the gateway built in the middle of the 18th century, which used to serve as the main entrance to the hospital and the great staircase built soon afterwards, remarkable not only for the elegance of its lines but also for the tiles that make up the side panel containing a variety of scenes set in a Rococo moulding.

The second building is the Royal College of Arts, which belonged to the Society of Jesus and was begun in 1568. The Coimbra High School was installed in this building in 1836 but in 1853 some hospital departments were transferred here. From 1870 onwards it was entirely given over to the hospital. In the late 1980s, these two old buildings were abandoned by the HUC services and are now patrimony of the University of Coimbra.

Nowadays the main centre of HUC operates in its own building, inaugurated in 1987 in Celas area of Coimbra. There are many other buildings of this hospital, dispersed around a large area in Coimbra, forming a huge Medical Centre.

In 2012, due to the European sovereign debt crisis and the Portuguese economic and financial crisis, the government merged the Coimbra University Hospitals with the Centro Hospitalar de Coimbra (C.H.C.) in order to reduce costs, fight overcapacity and unnecessary redundancy and create economic synergies for the state run hospitals operating in Coimbra.

The rebranded merged institution was then renamed C.H.U.C. - Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Coimbra.

<text>The Democratic Party (, ) is a liberal party in Curaçao founded in 1944. The party has participated in elections for the Estates of the Netherlands Antilles (Curaçao constituency) and the Island Council of Curaçao until the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010, obtaining a single seat in the island council in 2007.

By obtaining 1019 registrations of support, the party qualified (a minimum of 743 was required) for participation in the Curaçao General Election of 2012 on 19 October in a combined list with Laboral named Partido Democrat Laboral, where it obtained 1.2% of the votes but failed to obtain any seats. In the primary elections of 2016, the party received 1094 votes, again sufficient for participation, but did not end up winning any seats.

==Election results==
From 1954 until 1978, the party was part of the government of the Netherlands Antilles led by prime-minister Efrain Jonckheer, but it did not have any seats in the Estates of the Netherlands Antilles from 1995. At the legislative elections in the Netherlands Antilles, 18 January 2002, the party won 2.4% of the popular vote and none of the 14 Curaçao-seats in the Estates of the Netherlands Antilles. It took part in the elections of 27 2006 and 2010 where it obtained 3.7% and 2.5% of the vote of Curaçao respectively, but failed to win a seat.

In 2007, the party obtained a single seat in the island council (with 5% of the vote). At the Island Council elections of 2010, DP obtained 4% of the vote (3048 votes), about 500 votes shy of a seat in the Island Council (and its successor: the Estates of Curaçao).

<doc id="861892" wikidata="Q2461476" url="?curid=861892" title="Royal International Air Tattoo">
<text>The Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) is the world&#x27;s largest military airshow, held annually in July, usually at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire, England, in support of The Royal Air Force Charitable Trust. The show typically attracts a total of 150,000 to 200,000 spectators over the weekend. RIAT often features upwards of 200 aircraft over the weekend in July, visiting from countries across the globe. RIAT has 200+ static aircraft attend over the weekend and normally around 25+ flying displays each day of the event. 

==History==
The first Air Tattoo was staged at North Weald Airfield in Essex in 1971, with just over 100 aircraft taking part. The event was founded by Paul Bowen and Timothy Prince, who were CAA air traffic controllers, and Air Marshal Sir Denis Crowley-Milling. From 1973 to 1983 it was held intermittently at RAF Greenham Common, initially under the title of the Royal Air Forces Association, South Eastern Area, Air Tattoo before moving to RAF Fairford in 1985. The show became the International Air Tattoo in 1976, and recognition of its unique status was granted by Elizabeth II in 1996, when the current Royal International Air Tattoo title was adopted.

* The show took place at Fairford every two years until it became an annual show from 1993. Due to redevelopment work at RAF Fairford the show was held at RAF Cottesmore, Rutland in 2000 and 2001.
* Guinness World Records have recognised RIAT 2003 as the world&#x27;s largest ever military airshow, with 535 aircraft in attendance.
* RIAT 2022 saw 266 aircraft from 33 nations on display, as the show returned from an extended hiatus due to COVID-19.

The event has had a number of air show firsts, including the first display and landing of the B-2A Spirit stealth bomber outside the United States of America during the 1997 &quot;50 Years of the USAF&quot; event and in 2008 the first landing of the Lockheed F-22 Raptor in Europe.

The RIAT has evolved into an important showcase for the world&#x27;s military, taking place the week after the annual Global Air &amp; Space Chiefs&#x27; Conference in London and the week before the bi-annual Farnborough Airshow which occurs in &#x27;even&#x27; years. RIAT allows the military aerospace industry to showcase its products to both the general public and customers in a more relaxed environment outside the commercial selling pressure of the Farnborough trade show. The Farnborough show also restricts public attendance, in 2022 this was to a single day with free entry for under-21s to promote aerospace careers/recruitment.

As an extension to the Air Tattoo, Bowen and Price started the Flying Scholarship for Disabled People in 1983 in memory of Douglas Bader, who was a war hero and pilot despite losing his legs in an aerobatic crash. They have given over 400 scholarships to people with all types of disabilities and carry on the legacy of Bader.

===2008 cancellation===
The 2008 airshow was to feature two themes, the &quot;90th Anniversary of the Royal Air Force&quot; and &quot;Global Engagement&quot; and was scheduled to be held on 12–13 July. The USAF Air Combat Command&#x27;s F-22 Raptor Demo Team had made the first trans-Atlantic flight for the new stealth aircraft to participate in the show. On 11 July, the day before the air show opened to the public, Queen Elizabeth II presented, in poor weather conditions, new colours to the RAF and RAF Regiment in front of selected guests and VIPs. A week of heavy rainfall made the already-waterlogged car parks and parts of the airfield unusable. Safety concerns for the hundreds of thousands of expected visitors led the organisers to a last-minute cancellation of the public section of RIAT for the first time in the show&#x27;s history.

===RIAT 2009===
RIAT 2009 was held on 18–19 July 2009. The show celebrated the 60th anniversary of NATO by charting its history in chronological order. The show also featured a Search and Rescue display to recognise the significance of missions undertaken by the aircraft and people that undertake these jobs. The show reportedly had over 160,000 spectators.

===RIAT 2010===
RIAT 2010 was held on 17–18 July 2010. The themes for the show were the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, Training Aircraft and the 150th anniversary of Cadets. Nine members of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets and three members of the New Zealand Air Training Corps were invited to the event for the first time, as part of the International Air Cadet Exchange. The F-22 Raptor also appeared in its first RIAT flying display since 2008&#x27;s cancelled show. Notable visitors to the 2010 show included James May and David Jason.

===RIAT 2011===
RIAT 2011 was held on 16–17 July 2011. This Air Tattoo looked back over the past four decades as it celebrated the show&#x27;s 40th anniversary with a series of special aerial displays and ground entertainment. It also hosted a gathering of specially-decorated &quot;Tiger&quot; aircraft from the NATO Tiger Association. Tiger aircraft came from NATO squadrons that have a Tiger or Big Cat in their emblem and their association marked its 50th anniversary in 2011. RIAT 2011 saw a smaller crowd than usual of 138,000 attend the show. The pilot of the SoloTürk team, Murat Keleş was honoured with the highest award, the King Hussein Memorial Sword for the Best Overall Flying Demonstration.

===RIAT 2012===
RIAT 2012 was held on 7–8 July 2012. It saw the debut of Royal Air Force&#x27;s largest-ever aircraft, the Airbus Voyager; its new aerial refuelling multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft, which are military-converted Airbus A330 wide-body airliners. Another debut was the Black Eagles aerobatic team from South Korea and Japan became the 54th nation to participate at the tattoo with the arrival of one of its four Boeing KC-767Js operated by the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, which also brought the JASDF Taiko Drummers to the show.

===RIAT 2013===
RIAT 2013 took place on 20–21 July 2013. Invitations of participation were distributed to over 70 countries. The programme featured an Airbus A400M Atlas and one of the first deliveries of the Airbus A380 to British Airways, both of which flew in formation with the Royal Air Force Red Arrows aerobatic team over the show weekend. RIAT 2013 was also notable due to the lack of U.S. military aircraft represented at the event, due to U.S. government sequestration.

===RIAT 2014===

RIAT 2014 took place 11–13 July 2014; the first time in its history that the show has been open to the public on a Friday. The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II was to make its anticipated European debut but was grounded in the U. S. due to an engine failure before it could cross the Atlantic. Highlights of 2014&#x27;s show included a pair of Polish Air Force Sukhoi Su-22 Fitters along with celebrations for the 50th display season of the Red Arrows.

===RIAT 2015===

RIAT 2015 was staged from 17–19 July 2015. The show&#x27;s main theme was the celebration of 75 years since the Battle of Britain took place in the summer of 1940. RIAT 2015 also marked the last year of Avro Vulcan XH558&#x27;s airworthiness, being retired later in the year. The show also paid tribute to 35 years of the Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment, with three aircraft performing flypasts over the weekend.

==Incidents==

===Mid-air collision at IAT 1993===

On 24 July 1993, two MiG-29 Fulcrums of the Russian Air Force collided in mid-air and crashed away from the public. No one was hurt. After ejecting, the two pilots landed safely. Investigators later determined that pilot error was the cause, after one pilot did a reverse loop and disappeared into the clouds, the other one lost sight of his wingman and aborted the routine.

===2002 Italian Air Force accident===
In 2002 a G-222 of the Italian Air Force made a hard landing after demonstrating a steep descent approach, also known as the &quot;Sarajevo approach&quot;, developed for the airbridge for supplying Sarajevo during its blockade in the Bosnian War. After initial touchdown the aircraft bounced up and came back heavily on the nose wheel, which then collapsed. The crew evacuated the aircraft safely and the show was paused while the runway was cleared of the damaged aircraft.

<text>Saint Hermenegild or Ermengild (died 13 April 585; ; , from Gothic &quot;𐌹𐍂𐌼𐌿𐌽𐌰𐌲𐌹𐌻𐌳𐍃 *Airmana-gild&quot;, &quot;immense tribute&quot;), was the son of King Liuvigild of the Visigothic Kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. He fell out with his father in 579, then revolted the following year. During his rebellion, he converted from Arianism to Chalcedonian Christianity. Hermenegild was defeated in 584 and exiled. His death was later celebrated as a martyrdom due to the influence of Pope Gregory I&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues&quot;, in which he portrayed Hermenegild as a &quot;Catholic martyr rebelling against the tyranny of an Arian father.&quot;

==Marriage to Ingund==
Hermenegild was the eldest son of Liuvigild and his first wife. He was a brother of Reccared I and brought up an Arian. Liuvigild made his sons co-regents.
In 579, he married Ingund, the daughter of the Frankish King Sigebert I of Austrasia who was a Chalcedonian. Her mother was the Visigoth princess Brunhilda of Austrasia. The twelve-year-old Ingund was pressured by Hermenegild&#x27;s stepmother Goiswintha to abjure her beliefs, but she stayed firm in her faith.

Liuvigild sent Hermenegild to the south to govern on his behalf. There, he came under the influence of Leander of Seville, the older brother of Isidore of Seville. Hermenegild was converted to Chalcedonian Christianity. His family demanded for him to return to Arianism, but he refused.

Around then, he led a revolt against Liuvigild. Contemporary accounts attribute that to politics, rather than primarily religious differences. He asked for the aid of the Byzantine Empire, but it was occupied with defending itself from territorial incursions by the Sasanian Empire. For a time, Hermenegild had the support of the Suebi, who had been defeated by Liuvigild in 579, but he forced them to capitulate once again in 583.

Hermenegild fled to Seville and when it fell to a siege in 584, he went to Córdoba. After Liuvigild paid 30,000 pieces of gold, the Byzantines withdrew and took Ingund and her son with them.

Hermenegild sought sanctuary in a church. Liuvigild would not violate the sanctuary. He sent Reccared inside to speak with Hermenegild and to offer peace. That was accepted, and peace was made for some time.

==Imprisonment and death==
Goiswintha, however, brought about another alienation within the family. Hermenegild was imprisoned in Tarragona or Toledo. During his captivity in the tower of Seville, an Arian bishop was sent to Hermenegild for Easter but he would not accept the Eucharist from him. King Liuvigild ordered him beheaded; he was executed on 13 April 585.

He had one son by his wife named Athanagild after his matrilineal great-grandfather king Athanagild. They both tried to seek refuge in Constantinople after his execution, but it was refused while they were already in Sicily. She then returned to the Frankish Kingdom, where her son remained under her and her mother&#x27;s custody.

==Reputation and legacy==
Hermenegild&#x27;s reputation as a Catholic martyr is not present in contemporary Spanish accounts, such as John of Biclaro&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon continuans Victorem Tunnunensem&quot; and Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;Historia de regibus Gothorum, Vandalorum et Suevorum&quot;, which mention only his revolt and not his conversion. The French chronicler Gregory of Tours, in his &quot;Decem Libri Historiarum&quot;, recounts Hermenegild&#x27;s conversion and credits it as the cause of his rebellion; however, he judges Hermenegild harshly as a traitor. Of Hermenegild, Gregory wrote: &quot;Poor prince, he did not realize that the judgment of God hangs over anyone who makes such plans against his own father, even if that father be a heretic.&quot; It is the Italian Pope Gregory I who first identifies Hermenegild as a martyr. Writing in his &quot;Dialogues&quot;, Pope Gregory states that Hermenegild was killed after refusing communion from an Arian bishop. Pope Gregory credited Hermenegild&#x27;s death as inspiring his brother Reccared&#x27;s conversion, and thus the conversion of the Visigoth kingdom, saying that Reccared &quot;could never have effected all this, if king Hermigildus had not died for the testimony of true religion; for, as it is written: Unless the grain of wheat falling into the earth doth die, itself remaineth alone; but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit.&quot; It is chiefly on Pope Gregory&#x27;s assessment that Hermenegild&#x27;s subsequent legacy rests.

As a Catholic martyr, Hermenegild rose to prominence in Spain during the period following the Reconquista, during which time there was renewed interest in the Visigothic &quot;golden age&quot;. In 1585, at the urging of Philip II of Spain, Pope Sixtus V authorized the cult of Hermenegild in Spain; recognition was later extended to the whole church by Pope Urban VIII. Saint Hermenegild became celebrated through artistic representation such as poetry, painting, and plays. One example of this is &quot;El mártir del sacramento, San Hermenegildo&quot;, a Eucharistic play written in the 1680s by the Mexican nun Juana Inés de la Cruz. Another example is the Italian Cardinal Francesco Sforza Pallavicino&#x27;s 1644 tragedy &quot;Ermenegildo martire&quot;, which is considered a masterpiece of seventeenth-century Jesuit hagiographical drama. Francisco de Herrera the Younger&#x27;s 1654 painting &quot;The Triumph of St. Hermenegild&quot;, originally for the Church of the Discalced Carmelites in Madrid, is now in the collection of the Museo del Prado.

In art and Catholic Iconography, Saint Hermenegild is depicted with an ax as well as a crown, sword, and cross. Hermenegild&#x27;s entry in the Roman Martyrology, translated to English, reads: &quot;In Seville, Spain, St. Hermenegild, Martyr. He was the son of Liuvigild, the Arian king of the Visigoths. He was imprisoned when he confessed the Catholic faith. When he refused to take communion from the Arian bishop during the Easter service, his perfidious father ordered that he be brought down with an axe. Thus he left this earthly realm and entered Heaven as a king and martyr.&quot; Hermenegild&#x27;s feast day is April 13. He is the patron of the &quot;Real Hermandad de Veteranos de las Fuerzas Armadas y la Guardia Civil&quot; (&quot;Royal Brotherhood of Veterans of the Armed Forces and the Civil Guard&quot;) in Spain. The Royal and Military Order of Saint Hermenegild, established by Ferdinand VII of Spain in 1814, is also named in his honor.

==Parentage==
According to the 9th-century &quot;Chronicle of Alfonso III&quot;, Erwig was the son of Ardabast, who had journeyed from the Byzantine Empire to Hispania during the time of Chindasuinth, and married Chindasuinth&#x27;s niece Goda. Ardabast (or Artavasdos), was probably an Armenian or Persian Christian exile in Constantinople or in Byzantine Africa. In Hispania he was made a count. 

17th-century Spanish genealogist Luis Bartolomé de Salazar y Castro gave Ardabast&#x27;s father as Athanagild, the son of Saint Hermenegild and Ingund, and his mother as Flavia Juliana, a daughter of Peter Augustus and niece of the Emperor Maurice. This imperial connection is disputed by Christian Settipani, who says that the only source for Athanagild&#x27;s marriage to Flavia Julia is José Pellicer, who he claims to be a forger.

<doc id="861898" wikidata="Q638600" url="?curid=861898" title="Teen Titans (TV series)">
<text>Teen Titans is an American animated superhero television series created by Glen Murakami and developed by Murakami, David Slack and Sam Register. Based on DC Comics&#x27;s superhero team Teen Titans, it was produced by Warner Bros. Animation, and DC Comics (for season 5). The show premiered on Cartoon Network on July 19, 2003; its first two seasons also aired on Kids&#x27; WB. Initially, only four seasons were planned, but the popularity of the series led to Cartoon Network ordering a fifth season. The final half-hour episode of the show, &quot;Things Change&quot;, aired on January 16, 2006; it was later followed by a TV movie, &quot;Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo&quot;, that premiered on September 15 the same year, serving as the series finale. A 15-minute episode titled &quot;The Lost Episode&quot; was released as part of an online promotional campaign by Post Consumer Brands in January 2005.

&quot;Teen Titans&quot; became one of Cartoon Network&#x27;s most popular series, renowned for its humor, storylines, and banter between the main characters. During its run, the series was nominated for three Annie Awards and one Motion Picture Sound Editors Award. Spin-off media included comics, DVD releases, video games, music albums, and collectible toys. In 2013, the show spawned a spin-off, titled &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;, which received a theatrical film that was released on July 27, 2018, titled &quot;Teen Titans Go! To the Movies&quot;. In 2019, a crossover film with &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; was released, titled &quot;Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans&quot;. It features the first appearance of the original series characters after 13 years.

The series was first shown on Boomerang from February 2, 2009, replacing &quot;&quot; until October 31, 2010. It returned to Boomerang&#x27;s line-up on October 3, 2011, and left the schedule again on June 1, 2014.

==Premise==

&quot;Teen Titans&quot; is based primarily on stories by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez from the 1980s, featuring characters, storylines, and concepts introduced during the run, and incorporating a similar group of members. The five main members of the eponymous team in the series are Robin (Scott Menville), the intelligent and capable leader of the Teen Titans; Starfire (Hynden Walch), a quirky, curious alien princess from the planet Tamaran; Cyborg (Khary Payton), a half-human/half-robot cyborg who is known for his strength and technological prowess; Raven (Tara Strong), a stoic girl from the parallel world Azarath who draws upon dark energy and psionic abilities; and Beast Boy (Greg Cipes), a good-natured joker who can transform into various animals. They are situated in Titans Tower, a large T-shaped building featuring living quarters, a command center, and a variety of training facilities on an island just offshore from the West Coast metropolis of Jump City. The team deals with all manner of criminal activity and threats to the city, while dealing with their own struggles with adolescence, their mutual friendships, and their limitations.

The first season focuses on the Teen Titans&#x27; introduction to the mysterious supervillain Slade (Ron Perlman), who seeks to turn Robin into his apprentice. The second season is an adaptation of &quot;The Judas Contract&quot; storyline where new hero Terra (Ashley Johnson) joins the team while secretly plotting against them with Slade. The third season depicts Cyborg&#x27;s conflict with H.I.V.E. and their leader Brother Blood (John DiMaggio), prompting Cyborg to form the superhero team Titans East with Aqualad (Wil Wheaton), Speedy (Mike Erwin), Bumblebee (T&#x27;Keyah Crystal Keymáh), and Más y Menos (Freddy Rodriguez). In the fourth season, Raven finds herself unwillingly involved in a plot that threatens the existence of the world when her demon father Trigon (Kevin Michael Richardson) seeks to enslave the Earth. For the fifth season, the Teen Titans join forces with numerous other heroes to combat the Brotherhood of Evil, Beast Boy&#x27;s longtime adversaries, and their army of villains.

==Episodes==

==Cast and characters==
===Main===

* Scott Menville as Robin
* Hynden Walch as Starfire
* Khary Payton as Cyborg
* Tara Strong as Raven
* Greg Cipes as Beast Boy

===Secret identities===

Unlike most other superhero television series, the &quot;Teen Titans&quot; characters maintain their superhero identities at all times, with any hints at the concept of an alter ego or secret identity rarely explored.

The secret identity of Robin, an alias assumed by multiple characters in the comics, is never explicitly revealed in the series. However, several hints are provided to suggest he is Dick Grayson, the original Robin and founding member of the Teen Titans:
* Robin&#x27;s alternate dimensional counterpart Larry in the episode &quot;Fractured&quot; is named Nosyarg Kcid—Dick Grayson spelled backwards.
* Robin&#x27;s future counterpart in the episode &quot;How Long Is Forever?&quot; has taken on the identity of Nightwing, Grayson&#x27;s second superhero alias.
* The main romance in the show is Robin&#x27;s relationship with Starfire, whom Grayson would romance in the comics.
* A glimpse into Robin&#x27;s consciousness by Raven in the episode &quot;Haunted&quot; shows the memory of two acrobats falling from a trapeze, a reference to the death of Grayson&#x27;s acrobat parents being the catalyst for him becoming Robin.
* Further connections to the Batman mythos include two references in the episode &quot;The Apprentice, Pt. II&quot;, when Robin responds to a suggestion by the villain Slade that he &quot;might be like a father to [him]&quot; with &quot;I already have a father&quot; (which transitions to a shot of flying bats) and a fight scene on the rooftop of Wayne Enterprises.

The &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; episode &quot;Permanent Record&quot; would satirize the mystery of Robin&#x27;s identity by explicitly giving his name as &quot;Robin v.3: Tim Drake&quot; (the third Robin), with &quot;Dick Grayson&quot; and &quot;Jason Todd&quot; (the second Robin) being written over. Subsequent episodes, however, establish him as Dick Grayson through vague flashbacks to his boyhood at Haley Circus.

In the comics, Starfire and Raven are the real names of their respective characters. While the show does not specify this with the latter, the former acknowledges &quot;Starfire&quot; as the English translation of her name in the season 5 episode &quot;Go!&quot; and her native name, Koriand&#x27;r, is used in the season 3 episode &quot;Betrothed&quot;. The comic versions of these characters, however, also use the civilian aliases Kory Anders and Rachel Roth, which are not used on the show.

The policy of not mentioning the characters&#x27; secret identities would be broken in the season 5 premiere &quot;Homecoming&quot; when Elasti-Girl refers to Beast Boy by his real name, Garfield. Cyborg&#x27;s real name in the comics, Victor Stone, is referenced in the season 3 premiere &quot;Deception&quot; when he uses &quot;Stone&quot; as an undercover alias, although the series does not identify this as his real name.

==Production==
===Soundtrack===
The series is known for featuring both an English and Japanese version of its title theme song, created by Andy Sturmer and performed by Japanese band Puffy AmiYumi. The title theme used in the regions where the show was broadcast varied; some would play only one version, while Japan - and the English language video editions - would use both, according to the respective episode&#x27;s plot theme: the English lyrics for more serious stories, the Japanese version for more comedic tones.

The first-season episode &quot;Mad Mod&quot; also featured another song by Puffy AmiYumi, &quot;K2G&quot;. In the feature-length film &quot;Trouble in Tokyo&quot;, a literal translation of the Japanese song, whose actual lyrics differ greatly from its English counterpart, is performed for comedic effect.

===Cancellation===
In mid-November 2005, TitansTower.com reported that prospects for a sixth season were unlikely, and fans were urged to express their support for the show to Cartoon Network. Several days after this initial posting, the series was announced to have been cancelled. According to Wil Wheaton, the actor who provided the voice of Aqualad, the series was terminated by new Warner Bros. Animation executives, who made the decision not to renew the series based on its sixth season pitch. Wheaton&#x27;s story was contradicted by series story editor Rob Hoegee, who stated that the decision came from Cartoon Network, not WB, and that the crew was informed during the writing phase of season five that there were no plans for a sixth season. The show&#x27;s producer David Slack indicated that he was given different reasons for the show&#x27;s cancellation; either the ratings dropped after the &quot;scary&quot; season 4, or Mattel wanted the show dead because Bandai had the show&#x27;s toy deal. Cartoon Network announced that Mattel had become its &quot;master toy licensee&quot; in 2006.

After the last episode, Warner Bros. Animation released a feature film titled &quot;Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo&quot;. The film premiered at San Diego Comic-Con and was shown on Cartoon Network first on September 15, 2006, before airing on Kids&#x27; WB on September 16, and releasing on DVD on February 6, 2007.

===Proposed spin-off===
As early as August 2006, there were reports that &quot;Teen Titans&quot; would undergo a possible re-branding, with producer Glen Murakami citing the 1995 hiatus of &quot;&quot;, which was retooled in 1997 as &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;. According to Rob Hoegee, this had been suggested by Sam Register after he and David Slack had left the show, leaving Glen Murakami and Amy Wolfram to develop a proposal for a new show that would have expanded the team with all the new characters introduced in Season 5. When they had sent the pitch in, it was ultimately declined.

According to reports, the new show would have been titled &quot;New Teen Titans&quot;, and rather than focusing on the original five, would have featured a rotating cast. Some of these proposed teamups included:

* Robin, Speedy, Aqualad, and Kid Flash (a tribute to the original Titans from the comic book)
* Kid Flash, Mas y Menos
* Wildebeest, Jericho, and Gnarrk
* Hot Spot, Killowat, and Red Star
* Raven, Starfire, Kole, Argent, Bumblebee, and Pantha (in a story titled &quot;Truth or Dare&quot;)

The show was slated to introduce new villains, notably one named &quot;Athena&quot; who had the Midas touch and was accompanied by an ever changing roster of superpowered suiters as well as a posse of robot girls, and see the return of villains such as Mad Mod, Control Freak, and Soto. Series artist, Brianne Drouhard, has also stated doing visual development on a character that wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the reporting. Murakami also expressed interest in using Phobia, Mister Twister, and Ravager.

The pitch documents included information on a holiday episode, as well as a plot line in which Herald would unknowingly create a rift in &quot;Dimension X&quot;, allowing a microscopic, self-replicating creature to travel to Earth. According to series artist Derrick J. Wyatt, this would have tied back to the original show, and the unnamed creature from the series finale &quot;Things Change&quot;.

===Crossover with &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;===
A mid-credits scene from &quot;Teen Titans Go! To the Movies&quot; featured the 2003 Titans&#x27; return, in which Robin states they&#x27;ve &quot;found a way back&quot;.

In 2019, Warner Bros. released a crossover film featuring the Titans from both shows, titled &quot;Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans&quot;. The film premiered at San Diego Comic-Con on July 21, followed by a digital release on September 24 and a DVD and Blu-ray release on October 15. The events of the film take place during the fifth season of &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;.

==Legacy==
The series was revisited as a series of shorts in 2012 for the &quot;DC Nation&quot; programming block on Cartoon Network. Dubbed &quot;New Teen Titans&quot;, the shorts began airing on September 11. The shorts featured the Titans in chibi form, with the principal cast members of the original series returning.

Ciro Nieli, one of the show&#x27;s directors, would go on to create Disney&#x27;s &quot;Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!&quot;, another superhero action show with a large anime influence, but premiered in 2004 on Jetix, and featured Beast Boy&#x27;s voice actor Greg Cipes as the voice of Chiro, the show&#x27;s main protagonist. Sam Register, producer of the series, also made his own show in 2004 with &quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi&quot; on Cartoon Network, which was based on the pop duo who did the theme song, and also had an anime influence, but was created more to be a slapstick comedy in the veins of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;.

&quot;Teen Titans Go! &quot; was announced as a spin-off, with many voices the same, but not significantly related in terms of story to both the &quot;Teen Titans&quot; series and the &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; shorts. The series premiered on April 23, 2013.

Richardson, Payton, Strong, Cipes, and Walch reprised their respective character roles as Trigon, Cyborg, Raven, Beast Boy, Starfire, and Blackfire in &quot;DC Super Hero Girls&quot;.

Payton reprised his role as Cyborg in &quot;Lego DC Comics: Batman Be-Leaguered&quot;, &quot;Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League vs. Bizarro League&quot;, &quot;Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League – Attack of the Legion of Doom&quot;, &quot;Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League – Cosmic Clash&quot;, &quot;Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League – Gotham City Breakout&quot; along with Cipes, Walch, and Menville (although he played the Damian Wayne Robin), &quot;Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: The Flash&quot;, and &quot;Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Aquaman – Rage of Atlantis&quot;. He has also reprised his role as Cyborg on &quot;Justice League Action&quot;.

Several character details from &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, like Raven&#x27;s standard incantation &quot;Azarath Metrion Zinthos&quot; and Beast Boy&#x27;s super-werewolf form from the episode &quot;The Beast Within&quot;, were incorporated into the animated film &quot;Justice League vs. Teen Titans&quot;.

===Impact on DC continuity===
&quot;Teen Titans&quot; has never been established to be a part of the larger DC Animated Universe or &quot;The Batman&quot; animated series. Series producer Bruce Timm said the series would not cross over with &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;. Despite this, the series was alluded to in the &quot;Static Shock&quot; episode &quot;Hard as Nails&quot;, where Static asked Batman where Robin was, to which Batman responded, &quot;With the Titans...You&#x27;ll meet them some day&quot;. The character Speedy, who first appeared in the episode &quot;Winner Take All&quot;, later appeared in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; with the same costume design and voice actor (Mike Erwin). Kid Flash was voiced by Michael Rosenbaum in his appearances in the show, who was the same actor who voiced the Flash in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;; both characters are the Wally West incarnations. The follow-up series, &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;, has featured several appearances by Batman, but they have all been non-speaking appearances. Both Batman and Alfred Pennyworth appear in DC Nation&#x27;s &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; &quot;Red X Unmasked&quot;. In the season 2 episode of &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Serious&quot;, Aqualad (voiced by Khary Payton), Superboy, and Miss Martian of the &quot;Young Justice&quot; team appear.

Much like the DC Animated Universe (as well as &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot;), the series has affected the comics that initially inspired it, including: Beast Boy adopting the series&#x27; purple and black outfit during DC&#x27;s &quot;52&quot; storyline and later appearing with the pointed ears and fanged teeth originated by the series, future Cyborg having the same armor pattern of his animated counterpart in the &quot;Titans Tomorrow&quot; storyline, Raven adapting her animated counterpart&#x27;s costume design in the &quot;One Year Later&quot; storyline, the characters Más y Menos making appearances in &quot;52&quot; and the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; limited series, the character Joto was renamed &quot;Hot Spot&quot; during &quot;52&quot; to match his cartoon counterpart, and the villain Cinderblock appearing in a fight with the comic incarnation of the Titans. Red X is later included in the mainstream comic publications through the two-issue teaser comic &quot;Future State Teen Titans&quot; and its follow-up series, &quot;Teen Titans Academy&quot;.

==Reception==
Early into the series&#x27; run, Executive Producer and Cartoon Network and Warner Bros. Animation Vice President Sam Register responded to criticism regarding the style of the show with a statement slightly contradicting Murakami&#x27;s statement about wanting Robin to &quot;be cool&quot; with his metal-tipped boots:
However, while the series&#x27; creators initially stated that younger children were the intended audience for the series, &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; writer J. Torres notes that the progression and deeper themes of the show widened the appeal to a much broader audience:
 In 2009, &quot;Teen Titans&quot; was named the 83rd best animated series by IGN.

TVLine lists the theme song from the series among the best animated series themes of all time.

==In other media==
===Comics===

From 2004 to 2008, DC Comics published a comic book series based on &quot;Teen Titans&quot; called &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;. The series was written by J. Torres and Todd Nauck, Larry Stucker was the regular illustrator. While the comic&#x27;s stories stand independently, its issues were done so as not to contradict events established in the animated series&#x27; episodes. Often, &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; also referenced episodes of the show, as well as expanding on parts of the series.

In July 2024, DC Comics published a comic book series named &quot;Primer: Clashing Colors&quot; that features this iteration of the Teen Titans. It is written by Thomas Krajewski and Jennifer Muro, illustrated by Gretel Lusky. The comic focuses on Ashley Rayburn putting her powers to the test in order to be put on the team with the rest of the main cast. 

===Toys===
Bandai released a line of action figures based on the &quot;Teen Titans&quot; animated series. The line included 1.5 inch &quot;Comic Book Hero&quot; mini figures, 3.5 inch action figures (including &quot;Teen Titans Launch Tower Playset&quot;, &quot;Teen Titans Command Center&quot;, &quot;Battling Machines&quot;, &quot;T-Vehicles&quot;, &quot;T-Sub Deluxe Vehicles&quot;), 5 inch action figures, 6.5 inch plush Super-D Toys, and 10 inch figures. Amongst the characters included in the line were the main members of the Teen Titans, Titans East, and various allies and villains.

===Video games===
&quot;Teen Titans&quot; is a video game released on October 16, 2005 for the Game Boy Advance. It was the first video game adaptation based on the animated television series. The plot of the game followed Brother Blood having stolen copies of the Titans&#x27; DNA to create a clone army. Playable characters featured the main cast, Robin, Raven, Beast Boy, Starfire, and Cyborg. A console version of the game and a sequel titled &quot;Teen Titans 2&quot; was released in 2006.

==Films==
&quot;Teen Titans Go! vs. Teen Titans&quot;, released on July 21, 2019, features the main cast of &quot;Teen Titans&quot; along with the one of &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; in a crossover where both versions must fight villains from their respective worlds.

&quot;Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths – Part Three&quot;, released on July 16, 2024, contains a cameo where Titans Tower from the animated series can be momentarily seen.

<doc id="861899" wikidata="Q2735114" url="?curid=861899" title="Authentic Radical Liberal Party">
<text>The Authentic Radical Liberal Party ( or &quot;PLRA&quot;) is a liberal and radical political party in Paraguay. The party is a full member of Liberal International. The &quot;liberales&quot;, as they are known, are the leading opposition to the dominant conservative Colorado Party. They have taken this position since the end of the Alfredo Stroessner dictatorship in 1989. They are the political successors of the Liberal Party, which traces its history back to 10 July 1887.

The party was formed by Domingo Laíno, Carmen Casco de Lara Castro, Carlos Alberto González, Miguel Ángel Martínez Yaryes, and others in 1978, in opposition to the Constitutional Amendment of 1977 which imposed no term limits to the re-election of the Paraguayan president. The PLRA remained officially unrecognized from its foundation in 1978 until the overthrow of Alfredo Stroessner. During this time, PLRA activists suffered continual harassment.

In the presidential elections of 2008, the party achieved victory over the Colorado Party for the first time in 61 years through a political alliance headed by leftist Fernando Lugo and composed by other left-wing political parties. At the 2008 legislative elections, the party won 26 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 14 seats in the Senate. They were approximately tied with the Colorados in the number of seats won in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.

Following the June 2012 impeachment of Fernando Lugo, which the PLRA spearheaded, the governing alliance fell apart, and Vice-President Federico Franco took over the presidency, thus exercising the first all-PLRA government in Paraguay. The PLRA has remained in opposition since 2013. As one of Paraguay’s two traditional parties, the PLRA is notable for its lack of a clear political program, which is a reflection of its division into personalist factions, dominated by networks of national and local caudillos.

<doc id="861906" wikidata="Q206161" url="?curid=861906" title="Mount Herzl">
<text>Mount Herzl ( &quot;Har Hertsl&quot;), also &quot;Har ha-Zikaron&quot; ( lit. &quot;Mount of Remembrance&quot;), is the site of Israel&#x27;s national cemetery and other memorial and educational facilities, found on the west side of Jerusalem beside the Jerusalem Forest.

It is named after Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism. Herzl&#x27;s tomb lies at the top of the hill. Yad Vashem, which commemorates the Holocaust, lies to the west of Mt. Herzl. Israel&#x27;s war dead are also buried there. Mount Herzl is 834 meters above sea level.

==History==
In 1934, Zionist leader Menahem Ussishkin organized the re-interment of Leon Pinsker in Nicanor Cave on Mount Scopus in an attempt to build a pantheon for the great leaders of the Jewish nation. Ussishkin was buried there himself in 1941. When Mount Scopus became an enclave, cut off from Jerusalem, the implementation of this plan was no longer feasible.

During summer 1949, Theodor Herzl&#x27;s remains were reinterred on a hill in West Jerusalem which faced the Mount of Olives from a distance and renamed in his honour, Mount Herzl. In November 1949, soldiers who fell during the 1947–1949 Palestine war in the Jerusalem area were buried on the north slope of the hill.

Apart from Theodor Herzl, Mt. Herzl is the burial place of five of Israel&#x27;s prime ministers: Levi Eshkol, Golda Meir, Yitzhak Shamir, Yitzhak Rabin (who is buried beside his wife Leah) and Shimon Peres. Israeli presidents are also buried on Mt. Herzl, as are other prominent Jewish and Zionist leaders.

Mt. Herzl is the venue for many commemorative events and national celebrations.

The military section was designed and landscaped by two Hungarian-born architects, Asher Hiram and Haim Giladi.

==Theodor Herzl&#x27;s grave==

In 1903, Theodor Herzl wrote in his will:
I wish to be buried in a metal coffin next to my father, and to remain there until the Jewish people will transfer my remains to Eretz Israel. The coffins of my father, my sister Pauline, and of my close relatives who will have died until then will also be transferred there.

When Herzl died a year later, he was interred in Vienna. Forty-five years later, Herzl&#x27;s remains were brought to Israel and re-interred in Jerusalem. The location of the burial site was selected by a special state commission in the top of a hill in Jerusalem. He was buried on 17 August 1949. A temporary stone marked his grave for several years until the site was developed into a national cemetery. Sixty-three entries were submitted in the competition for the design of his new tombstone. The winner was Joseph Klarwein&#x27;s design, consisting of an unadorned black granite stone inscribed with the name Herzl.

The area around his tomb was expanded into the plaza where the first Independence Day ceremony was held in 1950.

Despite Herzl&#x27;s wishes, his daughter Pauline and son Hans were not originally buried beside him. Their remains were moved to Mt. Herzl in 2006. A third daughter was murdered in the Holocaust and her place of burial is unknown. The small Stephen Norman Park, located between the Herzl Museum and the Herzl Educational Center, is dedicated to the memory of Herzl&#x27;s only grandson, who killed himself in the United States in 1946 after learning about the fate of his family during the Holocaust and being confronted with Jewish misery in the Displaced Persons camps, and was reinterred on Mt. Herzl in December 2007. Herzl&#x27;s parents and sister are also buried at Mount Herzl.

==National Civil Cemetery==
Israel&#x27;s main cemetery for the leaders of the country and people who sacrificed their lives for the country is located on the southern slope of Mt. Herzl, established there in 1952 when Ben Gurion decided to bury the finance minister in Helkat Gedolei Ha&#x27;Uma, close to Herzl&#x27;s grave. The design of the cemetery area was continued over the following years when other famous people from the Zionist movement were brought to be buried there.

===Great Leaders of the Nation===
The Great Leaders of the Nation&#x27;s Plot or Memorial Park holds the graves of several Prime Ministers, Presidents, Knesset speakers and other chosen national leaders of the State of Israel. It forms a separate section of the Mount Herzl cemetery from that of the leaders of the Zionist Organization (after 1960: World Zionist Organization), which is situated nearby.

The Hebrew name Helkat Gedolei Ha&#x27;Uma () is used in common parlance either in a narrower meaning, for the State of Israel leaders&#x27; section, or in a wider one, which includes pre-state Zionist leaders.

Buried there are Presidents Zalman Shazar and Chaim Herzog, Shimon Peres and Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol, Golda Meir, Yitzhak Rabin and his wife Leah Rabin. Other notable graves are those of the first speaker of the Knesset, Yosef Sprinzak and his wife Hanna, the first Minister of Finance, Eliezer Kaplan, Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek, and First Lady Aura Herzog. Despite the national significance of the cemetery, some Israeli leaders were buried elsewhere, most notably Chaim Weizmann (buried at Weizmann House), Yitzhak Ben-Zvi (buried at Har HaMenuchot Cemetery); David Ben-Gurion (buried at Midreshet Ben-Gurion); Menachem Begin (buried at Mount of Olives) and Ariel Sharon (buried at his home in the Negev).
Deciding who should be buried on Mt. Herzl has sometimes been controversial. For example, the decision to bury Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky, who died in 1940, on Mt. Herzl, was fiercely opposed by many Labour Party stalwarts, who claimed that Jabotinsky was an ultra-right nationalist undeserving of such an honour. Only in 1964 did Prime Minister Levi Eshkol decide in favor of burying him there, in the interest of promoting national reconciliation and setting aside political grievances. Soldiers awarded with the Medal of Valor may also be buried at Mount Herzl.

To the north of Herzl&#x27;s grave is a plot reserved for the leaders of the (World) Zionist Organization, among them David Wolffsohn, Nahum Sokolow, Simcha Dinitz, and Arieh Dulzin. In the same section are the graves and cenotaphs of close relatives of Theodor Herzl.

The grave of Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky and his family is in a separate plot southwest of Herzl&#x27;s grave.

===Victims of Acts of Terror Memorial===
The Victims of Acts of Terror Memorial is the main memorial for all victims of terrorism in Israel from 1851 until today. The memorial was opened in 1997, and every year a ceremony is held on the plaza, in memory of the victims of terror. The memorial is located in the National Civil Cemetery next to Helkat Gedolei Ha&#x27;Uma.

===Other memorials===
* Olei Hagardom plot: Jewish underground fighters executed for their activities
* Common grave of the 204 illegal immigrants who went down with the &quot;Salvador&quot; in December 1940
* Common grave of the 44 immigrants aboard the &quot;Egoz&quot; (sank in 1961)

The main Israel Defense Forces cemetery is located on the northern slope of Mt. Herzl. It was established in November 1949, when soldiers who fell in
the Jerusalem area were buried there. In 1949, the government decided to turn the site into the main cemetery for IDF members who have fallen in the line of duty. The Israel Police cemetery, for police officers who have fallen in the line of duty, is also located there.

There are specific areas or monuments for the following categories of fallen fighters:
* National Memorial Hall For Israel&#x27;s Fallen
* Garden of the Missing in Action (burial places are unknown)
* Memorial for the Jewish soldiers in the Red Army in World War II
* Memorial for the Jewish soldiers in the Polish Army in World War II
* Memorial for the volunteers of the Yishuv (Jewish community in Palestine) in World War II
* Memorial for the 140 Jewish Palestinian soldiers who went down with the British ship SS Erinpura in 1943 during World War II
* Memorial for the 23 (in Hebrew numerals: Kaf-Gimel) Palmach sea commandoes who disappeared during Operation Boatswain under British command in 1941
* Common grave of the Nabi Daniel Convoy of 27 March 1948 (15 dead)
* Monument for the fallen fighters of the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem (surrendered on 28 May 1948)
* Memorial for the 69 sailors who went down with the &quot;Dakar&quot; submarine in 1968 and whose bodies were never recovered
* Common grave of the defenders of Neve Yaakov who fell in 1948
* Common grave of the fighters fallen in the Battles of Latrun of 1948
* Common grave of the Radar Hill fighters
* Common grave of the defenders of Kfar Etzion who fell in 1948

* Operation Peace for Galilee (First Lebanon War, 1982) plot
* Soldiers who fell since 1990
* Six-Day War, one of several plots
* Yom Kippur War, one of several plots

All soldiers, regardless of rank or unit, are buried side by side. The gravestones are plain and unadorned, only recording name, rank, parents&#x27; names, and place and date of birth and death.

The military cemetery also honours the memory of Israel&#x27;s fallen Christian, Muslim, and Druze soldiers who have served in the Israeli security forces.

===Garden of the Missing in Action===

The Garden of the Missing in Action is a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Memorial and Memory Garden for soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces and those who fought for the pre-state Land of Israel whose resting places are unknown from 1914 until today. The garden was established on 29 February 2004 in a ceremony attended by army chiefs, the Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz, and members of the Jerusalem Municipality at the National Military and Police cemetery. The garden also contains memorials to those lost aboard the submarine INS &quot;Dakar&quot; and the 23 Who Went Down at Sea.

An annual memorial service for the Missing Soldiers of Israel takes place in the garden&#x27;s main plaza on Seventh of Adar day.

The garden includes &quot;empty graves&quot; and stone monuments to the memory of missing soldiers. At the entrance to the garden, there is a small plaza where memorial ceremonies to the missing are held. On the north side of the plaza there is a memorial to the missing sailors of the INS &quot;Dakar&quot; submarine, which sank in the Mediterranean sea. On the north side of the plaza is a memorial wall bearing the names of all missing soldiers and fighters from 1914 until today. On the top of the wall there is a waterfall.

===National Memorial Hall For Israel&#x27;s Fallen===
A national memorial hall was built at the entrance to the National Military and Police cemetery to honour the memory of the 22,684 soldiers and security personnel who have fallen defending the land of Israel since 1860. It is designed in the shape of a torch rising some 18 meters and an eternal flame burns there all year long. A candle for each soldier is lit twice a year – once on the anniversary of the soldier&#x27;s death, and on Memorial Day. The cost of the project was NIS40 million.

== Gardens ==
Above the Herzl Museum and the main plaza is the Nations Garden, where trees have been planted by visiting presidents and heads of state. There are two small observation decks looking out over Jerusalem. A menorah sculpture stands opposite the main plaza entrance.

Situated between the Herzl Museum and the Stella and Alexander Margulies Education Center, the Stephen Norman Garden is named for Herzl&#x27;s grandson, Stephen Norman. He was the only member of Herzl&#x27;s family to visit Palestine or to be a Zionist. It is a place for groups and students to gather to hear about Mount Herzl. On one wall of the garden, a quote from Norman, in 1945, is inscribed: &quot;You will be amazed at the Jewish youth in Palestine...they have the look of freedom.&quot;

==Museums and study centers==
===Herzl Museum===
Herzl Museum, an interactive museum at the main entrance to Mt. Herzl, offers a glimpse into the life of Theodor Herzl, the man behind the dream of a Jewish homeland.

===Yad Vashem===
Yad Vashem is in the western region of Mount Herzl on the Mount of Remembrance in Jerusalem, 804 meters above sea level and adjacent to the Jerusalem Forest. Yad Vashem is complex containing two types of sites - memorial museums and monuments, and a research institute. Memorial sites include the Holocaust History Museum and the Museum of Holocaust Art; indoor memorials such as the Children&#x27;s Memorial and the Hall of Remembrance; outdoor commemorative sites such as the Valley of the Communities, the Cattle Car memorial and various sculptures; and a synagogue. The Holocaust research facilities are grouped around a research institute and include archives, a library, publishing house and an educational center, The International School for Holocaust Studies. Yad Vashem honours non-Jews who saved Jews during the Holocaust, at great personal risk, as the &quot;Righteous among the Nations&quot;.

The Memorial Path, leading from the entrance of Yad Vashem up to the Mount Herzl national cemetery, was established in 2003 and includes plaques that mark important events from the beginning of Zionism until the creation of the state of Israel.

===Zionism study center===
In 2010, work began on a Zionism Studies Center next to the Herzl museum, with the opening scheduled for 2013.

==Archaeology==
Mitspe Karem () is an archaeological park located in the Jerusalem Forest on the west side of the Mount of Remembrance, near the Yad Vashem museum. There are finds from various periods, including the Early Bronze Age, Iron Age, possibly Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine period.

In 1986, Smith joined CBS News as a reporter and was named a correspondent in 1987.

For thirteen years, Smith was a contributor to &quot;The CBS Evening News with Dan Rather&quot;, &quot;48 Hours&quot;, and CBS News documentaries. The majority of his time at CBS was spent anchoring the CBS morning show. From November 30, 1987, to June 14, 1996, he served as a co-anchor of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;. After leaving the show, Smith was featured on the CBS Evening news in a weekly report called &quot;Travels with Harry,&quot; which looked at unique people and places around the country. Starting in 1999, he hosted the A&amp;E Network television series &quot;Biography&quot; and The History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Modern Marvels&quot;.

On October 28, 2002, Smith returned to the CBS morning show, by that point renamed &quot;The Early Show&quot;. He hosted the program for eight years before CBS announced that Smith and co-anchors Maggie Rodriguez and Dave Price would leave the show at the end of 2010. His last day on the show was December 31, 2010. By that point, Smith had spent a total of seventeen years on a CBS morning show. Upon leaving the program, Smith became a Senior Correspondent for CBS News and substitute anchor for the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, and &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;. In addition to his television assignments, Smith delivered a daily &quot;Harry Smith Reporting&quot; editorial for the CBS Radio Network.

On July 8, 2011, CBS News notified its employees that Smith would depart the network after 25 years. NBC News subsequently announced that Smith would join that network and contribute to the prime-time newsmagazine program &quot;Rock Center with Brian Williams&quot;.

Since the canceling of &quot;Rock Center with Brian Williams&quot;, Smith has continued to report regularly on various NBC News platforms and substitute anchor on &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. He contributes a weekly story on Sunday mornings on the weekend edition of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; in a segment called &quot;Sundays with Harry&quot;.

In the fall of 2015, Smith began regularly serving as co-host on the weekend edition of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; alongside his former colleague from &quot;The Early Show&quot;, Erica Hill. Smith was part of a rotating group of co-hosts that filled the co-anchor chair after it was vacated by Lester Holt when he was named weekday anchor of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;.

Smith retired from NBC News in March 2024. In an on-air conversation with anchor Lester Holt following the broadcast of his final segment, Smith thanked viewers and NBC saying: &quot;I have nothing but gratitude... Every time I would always come on this show, I was always welcomed so generously. I&#x27;ve had just this unbelievable array of phenomenal experiences since coming to NBC, and so I&#x27;m really full of nothing but gratitude. Every time I&#x27;ve come on, everyone would drop their phones, pay attention to the story and then respond.&quot; In retirement, Smith returned to his alma mater, Central College, to teach.

== Personal life ==
Smith lives in New York City with his wife, sportscaster Andrea Joyce, and their two sons.

He is a cyclist and regularly commuted on a folding bike to work in New York City and he also rides a &quot;racing&quot; road bicycle.

<doc id="861919" wikidata="Q2978942" url="?curid=861919" title="Refractory clergy">
<text>During the French Revolution, the National Assembly abolished the traditional structure of the Catholic Church in France and reorganized it as an institution within the structure of the new French government through the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. One of the new requirements placed upon all clergy was the necessity of an oath of loyalty to the State before all foreign influences such as the Pope. This created a schism within the French clergy, with those taking the oath known as , and those refusing the oath known as non-juring clergy or refractory clergy.

== Background ==

In the centuries preceding the French Revolution, the Church had functioned as an autonomous entity within France. It controlled roughly 10% of all French land, levied mandatory tithes upon the populace, and collected revenues from its estates, all of which contributed to the Church&#x27;s total income, which it was not obliged to disclose to the state.

Under the &quot;ancien regime&quot;, France was divided into three Estates, and the clergy occupied the First Estate, with the aristocracy comprising the Second Estate, and the commoners the Third Estate. As one of the first two privileged Estates, the Church was exempt from taxation, although every five years the Assembly of the Clergy met and arranged a &quot;don gratuit&quot; (free gift) to be given to the King on behalf of the Church.

Over the course of the 18th century, France fell into deeper and deeper financial crisis. On multiple occasions, the state attempted to revoke the Church&#x27;s tax-free status in order to tap into its significant financial resources, with official declarations calling for formal surveys of the Church&#x27;s wealth and subsequent taxations being levied in 1749 and 1780. Both were successfully rebuffed by the Church, whose infrastructure, organization, man-power, and influence were still powerful in France. Nonetheless, these events show that a desire to check the power and privileges of the Church was gaining momentum before the Revolution erupted.

== During the French Revolution ==

In an attempt to find a peaceful resolution to mounting popular unrest and calls for reform, King Louis XVI first convened the Assembly of Notables in 1787 and then revived the Estates-General in 1789. During the 1787 Assembly, clerical representatives strongly opposed any reforms directed towards the Church, but by the meeting of the Estates-General, internal divisions began to form. Bishops and other ‘high clergy’ (who were often of noble stock) generally allied with the Second Estate in the preservation of their traditional privileges. However, many parish priests and other ‘low clergy’ sided with the Third Estate, representing their own class and the class of their flocks.

Things began to change quickly in 1789. On August 4, the newly assembled National Assembly drafted the ‘Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen,’ and over the next year completely dismantled French society and began to rebuild it from the ground up. Part of this included confiscating Church property and transferring ownership to the state. By June 1790 the Assembly had officially abolished the nobility, and on July 12 passed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy.

=== Civil Constitution of the Clergy ===

This new legislation dismantled and restructured the Church along the same lines as with the rest of society. Bishoprics were realigned to correspond with the eighty-three departments France had been divided into, and any additional bishoprics were abolished. Clergy were forbidden from recognizing the authority of any Church officials beholden to a foreign power. This included the Pope, whose position they were allowed to acknowledge, but not his authority. New bishops were forbidden from seeking confirmation from the Pope, but were allowed to write him to inform him of their position and reassert a unity of faith.

The most contentious aspect of the constitution, however, involved how new bishops were to be appointed to office and the duties required of them. The Church was in essence incorporated as another branch of the state. With bishops to be elected by popular vote. This was received with outrage by many clergy, as it not only completely up-ended the traditional appointment system of the Church, but would furthermore allow Protestants, Jews, and atheists to directly influence Church matters. Perhaps the greatest problem though, was Article XXI of Title II. This required a bishop to take an oath before municipal officials asserting his loyalty to the nation of France before all other things. Failing this their office would be declared vacant.

Sentiments between the Church and the Revolution began to sour much faster after this. While &quot;reform&quot; had been the stated goal by revolutionaries before, anti-religious rhetoric calling for the abolishment of the Church as a whole began to gain prominence. In October 1790, the National Convention banned priests, monks, nuns, and any who had previously occupied such positions from teaching in schools, and many members of the convention began calling for a “religion of patriotism” to supplant Catholic Christianity entirely. In November, the oath described in the Civil Constitution of the Clergy was drafted, and by the end of the year the Assembly proclaimed executive authority to enforce said oath.

=== Refractory clergy ===
The oath of loyalty created a massive schism within the French clergy. Many lower clergy had initially supported revolutionary calls for reform, even within the Church; but this was beyond the pale. Thousands of priests, monks, and nuns now had to choose between refusing the oath and risking arrest and punishment, or taking the oath and risking their salvation. On 13 April 1791, the Pope forced the issue by issuing the papal encyclical &quot;Charitas&quot;, officially condemning the Revolution&#x27;s actions towards the Church and leveling excommunication upon any clergy who took the oath.

The clergy split into juring priests (those who took the oath) and non-juring or refractory priests (those who refused). Both factions could face persecution, as communities with strong revolutionary sentiments would beat, stone, or even kill non-juring priests, while in more religiously traditional communities juring priests could face similar assaults.

This controversy was the first major issue to divide the popular masses on revolutionary reforms. Never had royalists or other counter-revolutionaries had popular constituencies, but there were many who believed the state had no right to meddle in the affairs of God to this degree and were loyal to their local priests. Also, sectors of France that had long-standing conflict with Protestant communities refused to support anything that threatened Catholic doctrine. Many clergy previously supportive of the Revolution were driven into opposition, and thousands of clergy hid or fled the country entirely.

=== Impact ===

While there were organized efforts to hunt down refractory priests and organized protests of religious ceremonies, many revolutionary leaders began to see this as detrimental to the movement. Some were vehemently ethically opposed, such as Maximilien Robespierre, who argued that atheism was a dangerous product of aristocratic decadence, and believed that a moral society should at least acknowledge the provenance of a Supreme Being. Others had more practical objections, knowing that deep-seated religious beliefs would not be eliminated quickly, and that mobilizing popular support for the Revolution was of top importance. Dividing and alienating the masses over religious issues was unhelpful.

Throughout all this, Louis XVI was appalled. Louis was a devout man, and while he was required to give public approval to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, in private he rejected it. On Palm Sunday in April 1791, he took communion from a non-juring priest. While friends, advisors, and even his wife had been strongly urging him to flee the country, Louis had resisted these suggestions. The attack on the clergy was potentially the tipping point that eventually led to the King&#x27;s doomed flight to Varennes in June 1791.

<text>Delena cancerides, the communal huntsman, flat huntsman or social huntsman, is a large, brown huntsman spider native to Australia. It has been introduced to New Zealand, where it is sometimes known as the Avondale spider. This was the species used in the Australian movie &quot;Napoleon&quot; and widely in &quot;Arachnophobia&quot;, and all films depict them as having a deadly venomous bite, but they are generally considered harmless to humans in real-life. It was first described by Charles Athanase Walckenaer in 1837.

==Behaviour==

Highly unusual among spiders, the flat huntsman spider is a social species, even sharing prey. They are often found under loose bark (their flat shape is an adaptation for this) in colonies up to 300, but they are highly aggressive and commonly cannibalistic toward members from other colonies. They hunt their food rather than spin webs for it. They are timid towards humans and bites are infrequent, and when they occur, symptoms are usually very minor.

==Distribution==

The species is found all over Australia, including Tasmania. It was introduced to New Zealand in 1924. Its range in New Zealand expanded slowly out of Avondale, a suburb of Auckland, hence the alternative New Zealand common name. There is a sculpture in the Avondale shopping centre celebrating the spider.

==Appearance and genetics==
Male &quot;D. cancerides&quot; have a body length of , while females are larger, with a body length of . The body is light brown and covered in dense, fine hairs. The legs are also hairy, and can have a span of over . 

Various populations show major differences in the chromosomes, leading to the recognition of several &quot;chromosomal subspecies&quot;, but these hybridize where in contact and there is little genetic divergence.

<doc id="861928" wikidata="Q1123417" url="?curid=861928" title="Refractory">
<text>In materials science, a refractory (or refractory material) is a material that is resistant to decomposition by heat or chemical attack and that retains its strength and rigidity at high temperatures. They are inorganic, non-metallic compounds that may be porous or non-porous, and their crystallinity varies widely: they may be crystalline, polycrystalline, amorphous, or composite. They are typically composed of oxides, carbides or nitrides of the following elements: silicon, aluminium, magnesium, calcium, boron, chromium and zirconium. Many refractories are ceramics, but some such as graphite are not, and some ceramics such as clay pottery are not considered refractory. Refractories are distinguished from the &quot;refractory metals&quot;, which are elemental metals and their alloys that have high melting temperatures.

Refractories are defined by ASTM C71 as &quot;non-metallic materials having those chemical and physical properties that make them applicable for structures, or as components of systems, that are exposed to environments above &quot;. Refractory materials are used in furnaces, kilns, incinerators, and reactors. Refractories are also used to make crucibles and molds for casting glass and metals. The iron and steel industry and metal casting sectors use approximately 70% of all refractories produced.

==Refractory materials==

Refractory materials must be chemically and physically stable at high temperatures. Depending on the operating environment, they must be resistant to thermal shock, be chemically inert, and/or have specific ranges of thermal conductivity and of the coefficient of thermal expansion.

The oxides of aluminium (alumina), silicon (silica) and magnesium (magnesia) are the most important materials used in the manufacturing of refractories. Another oxide usually found in refractories is the oxide of calcium (lime). Fire clays are also widely used in the manufacture of refractories.

Refractories must be chosen according to the conditions they face. Some applications require special refractory materials. Zirconia is used when the material must withstand extremely high temperatures. Silicon carbide and carbon (graphite) are two other refractory materials used in some very severe temperature conditions, but they cannot be used in contact with oxygen, as they would oxidize and burn.

Binary compounds such as tungsten carbide or boron nitride can be very refractory. Hafnium carbide is the most refractory binary compound known, with a melting point of 3890 °C. The ternary compound tantalum hafnium carbide has one of the highest melting points of all known compounds (4215 °C).

Molybdenum disilicide has a high melting point of 2030 °C and is often used as a heating element.

== Uses ==
Refractory materials are useful for the following functions:

# Serving as a thermal barrier between a hot medium and the wall of a containing vessel
# Withstanding physical stresses and preventing erosion of vessel walls due to the hot medium
# Protecting against corrosion
# Providing thermal insulation

Refractories have multiple useful applications. In the metallurgy industry, refractories are used for lining furnaces, kilns, reactors, and other vessels which hold and transport hot media such as metal and slag. Refractories have other high temperature applications such as fired heaters, hydrogen reformers, ammonia primary and secondary reformers, cracking furnaces, utility boilers, catalytic cracking units, air heaters, and sulfur furnaces. They are used for surfacing flame deflectors in rocket launch structures. 

==Classification of refractory materials==

Refractories are classified in multiple ways, based on:

# Chemical composition 
# Method of manufacture 
# Size and shape
# Fusion temperature 
# Refractoriness 
# Thermal conductivity

===Chemical composition===

====Acidic refractories====
Acidic refractories are generally impervious to acidic materials but easily attacked by basic materials, and are thus used with acidic slag in acidic environments. They include substances such as silica, alumina, and fire clay brick refractories. Notable reagents that can attack both alumina and silica are hydrofluoric acid, phosphoric acid, and fluorinated gases (e.g. HF, F2). At high temperatures, acidic refractories may also react with limes and basic oxides.

* Silica refractories are refractories containing more than 93% silicon oxide (SiO2). They are acidic, have high resistance to thermal shock, flux and slag resistance, and high spalling resistance. Silica bricks are often used in the iron and steel industry as furnace materials. An important property of silica brick is its ability to maintain hardness under high loads until its fusion point. Silica refractories are usually cheaper hence easily disposable. New technologies that provide higher strength and more casting duration with less silicon oxide (90%) when mixed with organic resins have been developed. 
* Zirconia refractories are refractories primarily composed of zirconium oxide (ZrO2). They are often used for glass furnaces because they have low thermal conductivity, are not easily wetted by molten glass and have low reactivity with molten glass. These refractories are also useful for applications in high temperature construction materials.
* Aluminosilicate refractories mainly consist of alumina (Al2O3) and silica (SiO2). Aluminosilicate refractories can be semiacidic, fireclay composite, or high alumina content composite.

====Basic refractories====
Basic refractories are used in areas where slags and atmosphere are basic. They are stable to alkaline materials but can react to acids, which is important e. g. when removing phosphorus from pig iron (see Gilchrist–Thomas process). The main raw materials belong to the RO group, of which magnesia (MgO) is a common example. Other examples include dolomite and chrome-magnesia. For the first half of the twentieth century, the steel making process used artificial periclase (roasted magnesite) as a furnace lining material.

* Magnesite refractories are composed of ≥ 85% magnesium oxide (MgO). They have high slag resistance to lime and iron-rich slags, strong abrasion and corrosion resistance, and high refractoriness under load, and are typically used in metallurgical furnaces.
* Dolomite refractories mainly consist of calcium magnesium carbonate. Typically, dolomite refractories are used in converter and refining furnaces.
* Magnesia-chrome refractories mainly consist of magnesium oxide (MgO) and chromium oxide (Cr2O3). These refractories have high refractoriness and have a high tolerance for corrosive environments.

====Neutral refractories====
These are used in areas where slags and atmosphere are either acidic or basic and are chemically stable to both acids and bases. The main raw materials belong to, but are not confined to, the R2O3 group. Common examples of these materials are alumina (Al2O3), chromia (Cr2O3) and carbon.

* Carbon graphite refractories mainly consist of carbon. These refractories are often used in highly reducing environments, and their properties of high refractoriness allow them excellent thermal stability and resistance to slags.
* Chromite refractories are composed of sintered magnesia and chromia. They have constant volume at high temperatures, high refractoriness, and high resistance to slags.
* Alumina refractories are composed of ≥ 50% alumina (Al2O3).

===Method of manufacture===
#Dry press process
#Fused cast
#Hand molded
#Formed (normal, fired or chemically bonded)
#Un-formed (monolithic-plastic, ramming and gunning mass, castables, mortars, dry vibrating cements.)
#Un-formed dry refractories.

===Size and shape===
Refractory objects are manufactured in standard shapes and special shapes. Standard shapes have dimensions that conform to conventions used by refractory manufacturers and are generally applicable to kilns or furnaces of the same types. Standard shapes are usually bricks that have a standard dimension of and this dimension is called a &quot;one brick equivalent&quot;. &quot;Brick equivalents&quot; are used in estimating how many refractory bricks it takes to make an installation into an industrial furnace. There are ranges of standard shapes of different sizes manufactured to produce walls, roofs, arches, tubes and circular apertures etc. Special shapes are specifically made for specific locations within furnaces and for particular kilns or furnaces. Special shapes are usually less dense and therefore less hard wearing than standard shapes.

====Unshaped (monolithic)====
These are without prescribed form and are only given shape upon application. These types are known as monolithic refractories. Common examples include plastic masses, ramming masses, castables, gunning masses, fettling mix, and mortars.

Dry vibration linings often used in induction furnace linings are also monolithic, and sold and transported as a dry powder, usually with a magnesia/alumina composition with additions of other chemicals for altering specific properties. They are also finding more applications in blast furnace linings, although this use is still rare.

===Fusion temperature===
Refractory materials are classified into three types based on fusion temperature (melting point).

*Normal refractories have a fusion temperature of 15801780 °C (e.g. fire clay)
*High refractories have a fusion temperature of 17802000 °C (e.g. chromite)
*Super refractories have a fusion temperature of &gt; 2000 °C (e.g. zirconia)

===Refractoriness===
Refractoriness is the property of a refractory&#x27;s multiphase to reach a specific softening degree at high temperature without load, and is measured with a pyrometric cone equivalent (PCE) test. Refractories are classified as:

* Super duty: PCE value of 33–38
* High duty: PCE value of 30–33
* Intermediate duty: PCE value of 28–30
* Low duty: PCE value of 19–28

===Thermal conductivity===
Refractories may be classified by thermal conductivity as either conducting, nonconducting, or insulating. Examples of conducting refractories are silicon carbide (SiC) and zirconium carbide (ZrC), whereas examples of nonconducting refractories are silica and alumina. Insulating refractories include calcium silicate materials, kaolin, and zirconia.

Insulating refractories are used to reduce the rate of heat loss through furnace walls. These refractories have low thermal conductivity due to a high degree of porosity, with a desired porous structure of small, uniform pores evenly distributed throughout the refractory brick in order to minimize thermal conductivity. Insulating refractories can be further classified into four types:

# Heat-resistant insulating materials with application temperatures ≤ 1100 °C
# Refractory insulating materials with application temperatures ≤ 1400 °C
# High refractory insulating materials with application temperatures ≤ 1700 °C
# Ultra-high refractory insulating materials with application temperatures ≤ 2000 °C

<text>Interstate 220 (I-220) in Mississippi is a loop around Jackson that provides an Interstate connection for I-55 and I-20. The northern terminus for the route is in the suburb of Ridgeland, at exit 104 on I-55. The highway was Mississippi&#x27;s first auxiliary Interstate, complete by 1981.

Traffic heading to and from the city&#x27;s western side can use this route. By avoiding Downtown Jackson, it also offers a different route for those traveling from I-55 south to I-20 west and from I-20 east to I-55 north.

The southern terminus for the route is in western Jackson at I-20, exit 41. The route is long. Although control cities of North Jackson and West Jackson are used at the southern and northern terminuses, respectively, no control cities are used along the interior length of the route (including guide signs at interchanges). Secondary signs at the terminuses direct drivers to use the route as a shortcut to Memphis, Tennessee, and Vicksburg.

==Route description==
I-220 begins at a directional T interchange with I-20 on the west side of Jackson. Its exits start with a partial cloverleaf interchange for US Highway 80 (US 80) west toward Clinton and east toward Pearl. As this Interstate runs, it also runs concurrently with US 49 as it passes through a partial cloverleaf interchange with Clinton Boulevard and Capitol Street, a diamond interchange with Industrial Drive, and then making its way toward its own partial cloverleaf interchange with Medgar Evers Boulevard, making its departure from I-220 north, and I-220 south is concurrent with US 49 south for the remainder of its route going south. I-220 north then makes its interchanges with Watkins Drive, Hanging Moss Road/Highland Colony Parkway, and then terminates at a directional T interchange with I-55 south, going past a short part of Ridgeland and back into Jackson, and north going to Grenada and Memphis, Tennessee.

==History==
The Interstate was first planned in 1971 and was completed by 1981.

A new interchange opened to traffic on I-220 in 2004. This $13.4-million (equivalent to $ in ) project completed a diamond interchange constructed at Industrial Drive between the Clinton Boulevard and US 49 north junctions. The project also resulted in the expansion of I-220 from four to six lanes from Clinton Boulevard (exits 2A and 2B) northward to Industrial Drive.

<doc id="861942" wikidata="Q106768821" url="?curid=861942" title="Green papaya salad">
<text>Green papaya salad is a spicy salad made from shredded unripe papaya. Originating in Laos, it is a national dish and a cornerstone of Lao cuisine, known locally as tam som or tam mak hoong. The dish exemplifies bold, vibrant flavors, blending sour, spicy, salty, and sweet elements, and holds deep cultural significance in Laos.

Green papaya salad is also widely popular in Thailand, particularly in the Isan region, which shares close ethnic and cultural ties with Laos due to its predominantly ethnic Lao population. Introduced to Thailand via Isan, the dish—called som tam in Thai—became a staple of Thai cuisine and spread nationwide. Beyond Laos and Thailand, green papaya salad has also gained regional prominence across continental Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam, as well as Xishuangbanna (China).

==Etymology==
The dish is deeply rooted in Lao cuisine, where it is traditionally called &quot;tam mak hoong&quot; (, , ) or &quot;tam som&quot; (, , ), in which the word &quot;tam&quot; () refers to the pounding of ingredients in a mortar, a method of preparation central to Lao and neighboring culinary traditions.

In Thailand, the salad is widely known as &quot;som tam&quot; (, , ), combining the Thai words &quot;som&quot; (ส้ม, &quot;sour&quot;) and &quot;tam&quot; (ตำ, &quot;pounded&quot;). In Isan, a region with strong cultural and linguistic ties to Laos, the salad uses Lao-derived names &quot;tam bak hung&quot; () or &quot;tam som&quot; ().

Regional variations and names include:

* Burmese: သင်္ဘောသီးသုပ် (&quot;thìn bau: thi: thoùp&quot;)
* Khmer: បុកល្ហុង (&quot;bok l’hong&quot;)
* Rakhine: ပဒကာသီးသုပ် (&quot;pədəɡà θí θùp&quot;)
* Vietnamese: &quot;gỏi đu đủ&quot; (a general term for papaya salad, often less spicy)

==History==
Papayas and chili peppers were introduced to Southeast Asia by the Spanish and Portuguese explorers in the 17th century from the Americas in the Columbian Exchange. Simon de la Loubère (1642-1729), a French diplomat, mentioned in his book that the cultivation of papaya was already widespread in Siam in 1693.

Although it is unknown when papayas and chili peppers entered Laos specifically, they had already been fully integrated into the Lao territory by the time Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix and Henri Mouhot visited in mid-1800s, and were listed among key ingredients for preparing main Lao dishes. The Lao were introduced to papaya (&quot;mak hung&quot;) from Khmer Loeu living in provinces bordering the southeastern Laos (who called them &quot;l&#x27;hun&quot; or &quot;lohung/rohung&quot; in Khmer). Papaya, among other fruits, were cultivated in Cambodia in the 1500s.

Green papaya salad was mentioned as a favorite Lao dish by a former Lao politician, Katay Don Sasorith (1904-1959), in a memoir recounting his experience during his primary school years in 1910s. Furthermore, according to the travelogue “Nirat Wang Bang Yi Khan” written in 1869 by Thai poet Khun Phum, the dish was already known among members of the Lao royal family living as war hostages in Bang Yi Khan compound in Bangkok, Siam.

<doc id="861943" wikidata="Q3050972" url="?curid=861943" title="WLS-TV">
<text>WLS-TV (channel 7) is a television station in Chicago, Illinois, United States, serving as the market&#x27;s ABC network outlet. It has been owned and operated by the network&#x27;s ABC Owned Television Stations division since the station&#x27;s inception. WLS-TV&#x27;s studios are located on North State Street in the Chicago Loop, and its transmitter is located atop the Willis Tower.

==History==
=== WENR-TV (1948–1953) ===
The station first signed on the air on September 17, 1948, as WENR-TV. It was the third television station to sign on in the Chicago market behind WGN-TV (channel 9), which debuted six months earlier in April, and WBKB (channel 4), which changed from an experimental station to a commercial operation in September 1946. As one of the original ABC-owned stations on channel 7, it was the second station to begin operations after WJZ-TV in New York City, and before WXYZ-TV in Detroit, KGO-TV in San Francisco and KECA-TV in Los Angeles.

The station&#x27;s original call letters were taken from co-owned radio station WENR (890 AM), which served as an affiliate of the ABC Radio Network (WENR would eventually merge with WLS, with which it shared a frequency under a time-sharing arrangement until ABC purchased a 50% interest in WLS in 1954).

=== WBKB-TV (1953–1968) ===
In February 1953, ABC merged with United Paramount Theatres (UPT), the former theater division of Paramount Pictures. UPT subsidiary Balaban and Katz owned WBKB (which shared a CBS affiliation with WGN-TV). The newly merged American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, as the company was known then, could not keep both stations because of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations then enforced that forbade the common ownership of two television stations licensed to the same market. As a result, WBKB&#x27;s channel 4 license was sold to CBS, which subsequently changed that station&#x27;s call letters to WBBM-TV; that outlet would move to VHF channel 2 several months later on July 5, 1953. The old WBKB&#x27;s on-air and behind-the-scenes staff stayed at the new WBBM-TV, while the WBKB call letters and management moved to channel 7 (from 1965 to 1968, a &quot;-TV&quot; suffix was included in the station&#x27;s calls, modifying it to WBKB-TV).

=== WLS-TV (1968–present) ===
Sterling &quot;Red&quot; Quinlan served as the station&#x27;s general manager from the early 1950s to the mid-1960s, and became a giant in early Chicago television. Quinlan was instrumental in starting the careers of Tom Duggan, Frank Reynolds and Bob Newhart. The station courageously aired &quot;The Tom Duggan Show&quot; in the mid-1950s, which became the most popular show in the Chicago market, far outdrawing other network competition. Channel 7 had its call letters changed to WLS-TV on October 7, 1968, named after WLS Radio, which ABC had wholly owned since 1959 when the network bought the 50% interest it did not already hold in the station from the &quot;Prairie Farmer&quot; magazine. Ironically, ABC merged WLS with WENR, its shared-time partner, in 1954.

In 1963, Al Parker joined the station as an announcer and worked in that capacity for 26 years. Until his departure, he also served as an announcer for &quot;AM Chicago&quot; and &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. He died September 30, 2000, at the age of 74.

WLS-TV had claimed to be &quot;Chicago&#x27;s first television station&quot; in its sign-ons and sign-offs during its first three decades (implying a connection with the original WBKB on channel 4), but admitted to its true roots with WENR with its 30th anniversary in 1978.

On January 17, 1984, WLS-TV launched Tele1st, an ABC-owned overnight subscription television service that carried a mix of films and lifestyle programs for four hours per night six days a week after the station&#x27;s sign-off at 2 a.m.; the service was similar in format to competitor ONTV (which was carried locally on WSNS-TV, channel 44 (now a Telemundo owned and operated station)) and other over-the-air pay services that existed during the early and mid-1980s. Tele1st was created with the concept of allowing users to record programming for later viewing; therefore, its decoder boxes were designed to unencrypt the signal only with the aid of a VCR. Scrambling codes that were sent to the box and relayed to the VCR were changed on a monthly basis, requiring subscribers to record additional footage airing immediately before and after that night&#x27;s schedule to retrieve codes to play back the recorded programs properly; this resulted in any recordings being viewable only during that calendar month. Tele1st was deemed a failure, attributing only 4,000 subscribers at its peak, and ceased operations on June 30, 1984.

In 1988, WLS-TV agreed to sell production rights to &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; to her Harpo Productions company, but ABC O&amp;Os continued to air the show until the end of its run in 2011.

==Programming==
WLS-TV currently airs the &quot;Weekend Adventure&quot; educational programming block and the network&#x27;s political/news discussion program &quot;This Week&quot; one hour later than most ABC stations due to its weekend morning newscasts.

===Network programs time-shifted===
* From that program&#x27;s debut in January 2003, WLS-TV aired &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; on a one-hour delay at 12:02 a.m. as the station aired reruns of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; at 11:02 p.m. after &quot;Nightline&quot; (this practice ended after &quot;Oprah&quot;—by then in reruns, as the daytime talk show aired its last episode that May—discontinued its syndication run on September 9, 2011; &quot;Kimmel&quot; was subsequently moved to 11:02 p.m. three days later on September 12).
* For many years, WLS-TV was the only ABC owned-and-operated station that did not carry &quot;Live with Kelly and Mark&quot; in its various incarnations. &quot;Live&quot;″s traditional 9 a.m. timeslot was occupied on Channel 7 by &quot;Oprah&quot; prior to the former program&#x27;s national debut in September 1986 until May 2011, and later by &quot;Windy City Live&quot; from May 2011 to September 2013; the program—which is produced by New York City sister station WABC-TV—had, however, occasionally aired in an overnight timeslot on WLS from 1991 to 1993 and again from 1999 to 2002. Other Chicago stations that aired &quot;Live&quot; in a daytime slot included WFLD (1990–1991 and 1997–1999), WBBM-TV (1993–1995) and WGN-TV (1995–1997 and 2002–2013). On September 2, 2013, &quot;Live with Kelly and Mark&quot; (at the time was named &quot;Live with Kelly and Michael&quot;) moved to WLS-TV (from WGN-TV), with &quot;Windy City Live&quot; being bumped to 11 a.m. as a result.
* From its premiere in September 2019 until September 2021, WLS-TV was the only ABC-owned station not to carry &quot;Tamron Hall&quot;, due to a lack of a viable timeslot in its daytime schedule. independent station WCIU-TV (channel 26) carried it for its first two seasons, with the show moving to WLS-TV in the third season after the end of &quot;Windy City Live&quot;.

===Other WLS-TV produced programs===
* &quot;190 North&quot; – a local lifestyle program (named after the station&#x27;s studio address at 190 North State Street in the Loop) formerly hosted by Janet Davies; the show began broadcasting in 1998 and then in high-definition on May 6, 2007. The show ran on Sundays at 11 p.m., with a rebroadcast on Saturday nights from 1998 to 2013. It returned later in 2013 in a retooled format, only airing a few times a year.
* &quot;Let&#x27;s Dish&quot; – a food-based travel program produced by WLS-TV for the Live Well Network, and shown locally on digital channel 7.2.
* &quot;Windy City Weekend&quot; – a weekly lifestyle program that formerly served as a weekday afternoon talk show with a live audience known as &quot;Windy City Live&quot;, hosted by Ryan Chiaverini and Valerie Warner that premiered as a daily program on May 26, 2011, replacing &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. Initially airing weekdays at 9 a.m., the live telecast moved to 11 a.m. on September 2, 2013, and at 1 p.m. on June 27, 2016, with reruns airing at 2 p.m. (on digital subchannel 7.2) and at 12:07 a.m. (after ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot;). The show ended after 10 years as a daily program on September 3, 2021; it later recast as a weekly program, known as &quot;Windy City Weekend&quot; on September 10, 2021, and it airs Fridays at 11:30 a.m.
* Since 1991, the station has broadcast a local New Year&#x27;s Eve special known as &quot;Countdown Chicago&quot;.

===Former WLS-TV produced programs===
* &quot;The Chicago Huddle&quot; – a local sports program about the Chicago Bears hosted by Ryan Chiaverini. The program aired Sundays 10:30 a.m. during the NFL season until during the 2009-10 Bears season.
* &quot;Chicagoing&quot; – a local public affairs program hosted by Bill Campbell. Aired on Sunday mornings at 11:30 a.m., the program ran its final broadcast on December 26, 2010.

===Former syndicated programming produced in Chicago===
* &quot;At the Movies&quot; – nationally syndicated film review program, produced at WLS-TV&#x27;s studios, and distributed by Disney-ABC Domestic Television. It aired Saturdays 10:35 p.m. with reruns Sundays 10:30 a.m. The program aired its final original broadcast on August 14, 2010.
* &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; – previously a local program &quot;A.M. Chicago&quot;, it received the name about one year after Oprah Winfrey began hosting. The program was created by WLS-TV, but was later produced by Harpo Productions and CBS Television Distribution at Oprah&#x27;s Harpo Studios. It aired weekdays at 9 a.m., in both its local and syndicated incarnations. The program ended with its final original broadcast airing on May 25, 2011. Reruns continued weeknights at 11:02 p.m. until September 9, 2011.

===Sports programming===
WLS-TV is the local over-the-air host of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games involving the Chicago Bears, airing simulcasts of the team&#x27;s ESPN-televised games (WLS-TV&#x27;s corporate parent, The Walt Disney Company, owns 80% of ESPN, and the ABC Owned Television Stations have right of first refusal for simulcasts of ESPN&#x27;s NFL telecasts within a team&#x27;s home market). Because of this, atypical for a network-owned station outside of breaking news and severe weather coverage necessitating such situations, the station has had to reschedule ABC network programs preempted by the telecasts. The preseason and &quot;MNF&quot; telecasts mark the only NFL games to have aired on WLS-TV since ABC lost the rights to NFL games in 2006; during the regular season, Bears games are rotated between WBBM-TV (through the &quot;NFL on CBS&quot;), WMAQ-TV (through &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot;) and especially WFLD (through the &quot;NFL on Fox&quot;). Since 2010, however, it has deferred the right of first refusal due to the popularity and live voting requirements of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, with WCIU-TV carrying the &quot;MNF&quot; games when the former program&#x27;s fall season is ongoing (an exception being WLS&#x27; carriage of an &quot;MNF&quot; Bears game against the Dallas Cowboys on December 9, 2013, when the team honored former head coach Mike Ditka, after the &quot;DWTS&quot; fall season had already ended).

On December 12, 2014, WLS-TV signed a new five-year broadcast agreement with the Chicago Cubs, in which WLS televised 25 of the Major League Baseball team&#x27;s games per year, starting with the 2015 season. The arrangement partially replaced one with WGN-TV (which had broadcast Cubs games since its inception in April 1948), which voluntarily pulled out of its existing broadcast deal with the team for the 2015 season and subsequently agreed to carry a reduced slate of 45 games. The WLS broadcasts were seen on DirecTV&#x27;s version of MLB Extra Innings, and the feed provided was the WLS signal seen in the Chicago market (unlike with the feeds of WGN broadcasts, where public service announcements were seen in place of local commercials and station promos).

As ABC has a limited sports programming schedule during the Major League Baseball season prior to September (when the MLB regular season and college football season overlap), the station mainly carried the team&#x27;s weekend daytime games in order to limit preemption of the network&#x27;s prime time programming. The deal (along with all of the Cubs&#x27; broadcast television deals) ended after the 2019 season, when the team launched the cable-only Marquee Sports Network to carry their game telecasts.

WLS-TV also carries select Chicago Bulls games as part of their &quot;NBA on ABC&quot; telecasts.

From 1999 to 2004 and again since 2021, WLS-TV carries select Chicago Blackhawks games as part of their &quot;NHL on ABC&quot; telecasts.

===News operation===
WLS-TV broadcasts 41 hours, 25 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6 hours, 5 minutes each weekday and hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). WLS-TV also contracts with iHeartMedia to provide weather forecasts for their Chicago market stations, including WLIT-FM (93.9), WCHI-FM (95.5), WVAZ (102.7), WKSC-FM (103.5), and WGCI-FM (107.5).

====News department history====

In 1969, WLS-TV adopted the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; format that the other ABC owned-and-operated stations began implementing in the late 1960s, after the news format was popularized when it originated at New York City flagship WABC-TV. Beginning in 1968, the station&#x27;s main evening newscasts were co-anchored by Fahey Flynn, a bowtie-wearing broadcaster who had spent the previous 15 years at WBBM-TV; and Joel Daly, who was hired away by WLS from WJW-TV in Cleveland in 1967. The duo served as the anchors of the station&#x27;s 6 and 10 p.m. newscasts until Flynn&#x27;s death in August 1983. In 1970, the two were joined by John Drury, who helmed the 5 p.m. newscast. By 1973, WLS&#x27; &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; broadcasts surpassed NBC-owned WMAQ-TV (channel 5)&#x27;s newscasts to become Chicago&#x27;s top-rated news operation, a lead it held until WBBM-TV surpassed channel 7 for the top spot in 1979. For much of the 1970s and 1980s, it waged a spirited battle for second place in the Chicago news ratings between its two main competitors.

Around the time of Flynn&#x27;s death, Channel 7 had been experiencing a ratings decline, prompting major changes to the station&#x27;s management. ABC hired Bill Applegate from WNEV-TV in Boston (now WHDH) as the station&#x27;s news director. Shortly after, general manager Peter Desnoes resigned to co-found Burnham Broadcasting. His replacement was Chicago native Dennis Swanson, who worked for WGN-TV and WMAQ-TV before becoming news director at ABC&#x27;s Los Angeles station, KABC-TV. ABC also commissioned Frank Gari to compose an updated version of the &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; &quot;Tar Sequence&quot; theme widely associated with the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; format. The result was &quot;News Series 2000&quot;, a theme package that was quickly picked up by other ABC O&amp;Os and affiliates.

Upon his return to Chicago, Swanson would be tasked with finding a replacement for Flynn on the 6 p.m. news, as well as a new host for its &quot;AM Chicago&quot; program after host Robb Weller departed for New York City. He responded to the latter by bringing in Oprah Winfrey, at the time the host of &quot;People Are Talking&quot; on ABC&#x27;s then-affiliate in Baltimore, WJZ-TV.

Within a year, the program had moved to first place in the ratings. &quot;AM Chicago&quot; entered into national syndication in 1986 and was renamed &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. Channel 7 was the flagship station for the show, and it, along with most of ABC&#x27;s other owned-and-operated stations, carried it until it went out of production in September 2011. Swanson also re-hired lead anchor John Drury, who had left for WGN-TV in 1979; and Floyd Kalber, who had led WMAQ-TV to the top of the ratings in the 1960s. Drury and Mary Ann Childers were a popular anchor team at WLS-TV during the 1980s and 1990s, accompanied by weather anchor Steve Deshler and sports anchor Tim Weigel. In March 1986, channel 7 passed WBBM-TV as the highest-rated news station in Chicago. It has held the lead ever since, aside from a brief period when WBBM-TV forged a tie for first in the late 1980s.

In 1992, the station replaced the &quot;News Series 2000&quot; package (as the other ABC O&amp;Os did over the following year, due partly to increased royalties for use of the &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; theme and its variants by the original theme&#x27;s composer, Lalo Schifrin) with a new news music package, also produced by Gari, called &quot;News Series 2000 Plus&quot; (since renamed &quot;Stimulus&quot;), which has remained in use by WLS ever since and was updated in 2013. In 1996, WLS-TV dropped the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; brand after 26 years, in favor of the network-centric &quot;ABC 7 News&quot;; the move was part of a standard branding effort imposed by ABC across its owned-and-operated stations which saw the incorporation of the ABC name into their local brands (most of the other ABC O&amp;Os retained their existing news branding, as sister stations such as WABC-TV and WPVI-TV in Philadelphia retained their &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; or &quot;Action News&quot; identities).
WLS-TV debuted a street-side studio at its North State Street facility on April 10, 2006, during the station&#x27;s morning newscast, although the station had begun broadcasting its newscasts from that studio two days earlier on April 8. On the weekend of April 29–30, 2006, WLS-TV upgraded its news helicopter with a high definition camera, rebranding it as &quot;Chopper 7 HD&quot;. On January 6, 2007, WLS-TV became the first Chicago television station to broadcast all of its local programming—including newscasts—in high definition, although most remote field footage remained in 16:9 widescreen standard definition at the time. Since then, WLS-TV upgraded most of its field footage to HD, although some field reports remain in widescreen SD.

On December 23, 2007, a Mazda MPV minivan drove through a reinforced studio window at the State Street Studio two minutes into the 10 p.m. newscast, startling anchor Ravi Baichwal on air and creating a 20-degree draft as the glass shattered upon the car&#x27;s impact; no one was injured in the crash. Evanston resident Gerald Richardson was subsequently charged with felony damage to property for the incident. On November 11, 2012, WLS-TV expanded its Sunday 8 a.m. newscast from to two hours, leading into ABC&#x27;s &quot;This Week&quot;. The 8 a.m. portion of the Saturday morning newscast was expanded to two hours from 8 to 10 a.m. on August 24, 2013. Nearly a week later on August 30, WLS-TV discontinued its hour-long weekday 11 a.m. newscast (which originated in 1992 as a half-hour program at 11:30, before it expanded into an earlier, one-hour broadcast on October 6, 2003, following the cancellation of &quot;Port Charles&quot;) after 21 years, and replaced it on September 2 with &quot;Windy City Live&quot;, whose original 9 a.m. slot became occupied by &quot;Live! with Kelly and Michael&quot; when it moved to WLS from WGN-TV on that date (as such, it became the first – and currently, the only – ABC owned-and-operated station without a midday newscast). With the move and the midday newscast&#x27;s cancellation, news and weather cut-ins were incorporated into &quot;Windy City Live&quot;.

On October 26, 2013, WLS-TV reintroduced the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; brand (as &quot;ABC 7 Eyewitness News&quot;), as part of an overall rebranding of its newscasts that included new graphics and a modernized update to the &quot;Stimulus&quot; theme. In an interview with media columnist Robert Feder, WLS-TV president/general manager John Idler said the reasoning behind the restoration of the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; brand, was that it &quot;[still] resonated strongly with [viewers in] the Chicago market&quot;, despite being dropped by the station 17 years earlier. On November 2, 2013, WLS expanded the early block of its weekend morning newscasts, with the extension of its hour-long 6 a.m. newscast on Saturdays and Sundays to two hours at 5 a.m.

On February 10, 2014, WLS-TV entered into a partnership agreement with the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; to include the use of the station&#x27;s weather team in the newspaper&#x27;s weather section, replacing WMAQ-TV, whose previous partnership ended the day before; in addition, the station would air a &#x27;look ahead&#x27; of the newspaper&#x27;s front page and stories, with the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; promoting WLS&#x27;s newscasts and programming in turn.

On December 14, 2014, WLS-TV entered into a news share agreement with WCIU-TV to produce a weeknight-only 7 p.m. newscast titled &quot;ABC 7 Eyewitness News at 7:00 on The U&quot;; the program debuted on January 12, 2015, and is the fifth newscast produced by ABC O&amp;O for a separately owned station in the station&#x27;s home market (along with existing programs produced by sister stations in Raleigh, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Los Angeles for WLFL, WPHL-TV, KOFY-TV and KDOC-TV in the respective markets, and a since-canceled newscast produced by KFSN-TV for KAIL in Fresno).

On June 27, 2016, WLS-TV revived its 11 a.m. newscasts for the first time since 2013, becoming the fourth television station in Chicago to do so; which completes against WMAQ-TV (who revived its midday newscasts in September 2011 and moved to the time period in September 2014), WBBM-TV (who began airing a half-hour 11 a.m. newscasts in early 2000s), and WGN-TV (who began its midday newscasts in 1984; followed by some expansions in September 2008 and October 2009). In June 2016, after several years of unsuccessful syndicated talk show replacements for the canceled &quot;All My Children&quot; (including &quot;Katie&quot; and &quot;FABLife&quot;), the station moved &quot;General Hospital&quot; to 2 p.m., then &quot;Windy City Live&quot; to 1 p.m. to accommodate the 11 a.m. newscast, with a replay of the latter late night after &quot;Nightline&quot;.

On July 29, 2019, It was announced that WLS-TV would end its news share agreement with WCIU-TV, ending the weeknight program for that station, the 7 p.m. newscast &quot;ABC 7 Eyewitness News at 7:00 on The U&quot; after 4 years, with the final broadcast on August 30 of that same year. The mutual parting of ways came as WCIU became the market&#x27;s CW affiliate on September 1, leaving no room for a newscast on the station&#x27;s schedule.

On June 19, 2023, WLS-TV debuted its new on-air look for the first time in a decade as it was the first ABC owned-and-operated station to unveil its new standard graphics package.

====Ratings====
According to the Nielsen local news ratings for the February 2011 sweeps period, WLS-TV remained in first place overall, with the 10 p.m. newscast getting a 9.7 rating share, down a tenth of a point from a 9.8 during the same time the previous year. The station remained in second place for its prime time lead-in.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
&lt;section begin=subs /&gt;

&lt;section end=subs /&gt;
Prior to February 24, 2011, WLS-DT3 carried &quot;ABC 7 News NOW&quot;, featuring local news and weather and national/sidebar content from The Local AccuWeather Channel. The ABC O&amp;Os discontinued their Local AccuWeather channels on February 24, 2011, replacing its programming with a letterboxed standard-definition simulcast of their Live Well subchannels, though AccuWeather&#x27;s content/branding agreement with ABCOTS, including WLS-TV, continued unchanged. WLS-DT3 formerly served as a charter affiliate of Laff diginet from its launch in January 2015. To accommodate the WXFT channel share which took effect in December 2017, WLS-TV discontinued the third Laff subchannel, which shifted over to a subchannel of WXFT&#x27;s sister station, WGBO-DT2, and reduced the Live Well feed from a reduced-bitrate 720p broadcast to a 480i format. After WLS moved to their new channel post-spectrum transition, it soon picked up This TV after ABCOTS picked up the network for their stations in the spring of 2021.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WLS-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, at noon on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 52, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcast use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era VHF channel 7.

WLS operated its digital signal at low power (4.75 kW) to protect the digital signal of NBC affiliate WOOD-TV in Grand Rapids, Michigan (which also broadcasts on channel 7, but at a much higher radiated power). As a result, many viewers were not able to receive the station. The FCC sent extra personnel to Chicago, Philadelphia and New York City to deal with difficulties in those cities. WLS had received 1,735 calls just by the end of the day on June 12 (WBBM only received 600), and an estimated 5,000 calls in total by June 16.

WLS-TV was just one station which needed to increase its signal strength or move its frequency to solve its problems, but a power increase required making sure no other stations were affected. WLS received a two-week experimental permit for a power increase late in June. WLS had also applied for a permit to construct a low-power fill-in digital translator station on UHF channel 32 (the former analog frequency of WFLD), but abandoned that plan (the channel 32 RF frequency has since been claimed by WMEU-CD). Eventually the FCC granted it a permit to transmit on a second frequency, UHF channel 44, formerly occupied by WSNS-TV; WLS announced the availability of that frequency on October 31, 2009.

Throughout construction of the new maximized transmitting facilities at the Willis Tower, WLS operated both channels 7 and 44 from its auxiliary facilities at the John Hancock Center under an STA. WLS operated channel 7 as a fill-in translator with a power of 7 kW, and operating their full power operations on channel 44 with a power of 1 MW. Through the use of virtual channel technology, both operating frequencies were re-mapped and displayed as channel 7, which would cause some digital tuners to have two versions of virtual channels 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3, while tuning sequentially. In October 2012, WLS-TV completed construction from the Willis Tower and its operating channel 44 at the 1 million watt power level. The station continued its dual-frequency operations until 12:03 p.m. on March 18, 2013, when WLS-TV formally ceased operations on VHF channel 7, leaving UHF channel 44 as its permanent allotment. Since WLS-TV officially moved its full-power operations to channel 44, it is the only ABC-owned station to vacate its former analog allotment for its digital operations and the second ABC O&amp;O to operate its full-power operations on the UHF band, after Fresno sister station KFSN-TV (which was forced onto UHF in 1961 when it was a CBS affiliate, as the FCC preferred Fresno to be a &quot;UHF island&quot;).

On June 12, 2017, WLS-TV&#x27;s parent company ABC Owned Television Stations and Univision Communications announced they would enter into a channel sharing agreement following the sale of the over-the-air spectrum of UniMás owned-and-operated station WXFT-DT in the FCC&#x27;s spectrum reallocation auction for $126.1 million on April 13, 2017; as mentioned above, the transition of WXFT to the WLS-TV spectrum occurred eight months later. During the 2019 digital television repack, the station relocated from UHF channel 44 as it was no longer allocated to broadcast television and is now broadcasting on UHF channel 22.

Inside the Bloc, the party won three seats. After the elections, the Bloc fell apart in three parliamentary groups of the constituent parties.

In 2001, Oleg Serebrian released a manifest with the intention to found a social liberal party. This initiative was joined by the Christian Democratic League of Women and the National Youth League of Moldova. In 2002 the Party of Democratic Forces merged into the party. Since November 2006 the Social Liberal Party was a member of Liberal International.

It merged into the Democratic Party of Moldova in February 2008.

<text>The Our Moldova Alliance (, , AMN) was a social-liberal political party in Moldova led by Serafim Urechean, former mayor of Chișinău. It merged into the Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova (PLDM) during April 2011.

==History==
The Our Moldova Alliance was established as a party in 2003 from the merger of:

*the Social Democratic Alliance of Moldova or the Braghiș Alliance, successor of the social-political Movement &quot;Civic Alliance for Reforms&quot; and the Party of Social Democracy &quot;Furnica&quot; (Ant), was a social-democratic party established in 1997 and adopted this name in 2001. It was led by Dumitru Braghiș and absorbed the Socio-political Movement &quot;Plai Natal&quot; in 2002.
*the Liberal Party, a liberal party created as a merger of the Party of Rebirth and Conciliation of Moldova (1995), National Peasant Christian Democratic Party (1993) and the Social Liberal Union &quot;Force of Moldova&quot;, the latter was being a merger of the National Liberal Party (1993) and the Social-Political Movement &quot;For Order and Justice&quot; (2000). Among its leaders was former president Mircea Snegur. The last party leader was Veaceslav Untila.
*the Independents&#x27; Alliance of Moldova, a party founded in 2001 by Serafim Urechean, mayor of Chișinău.
*the Popular Democratic Party of Moldova, a party established in 1997.

==Moldovan parliamentary election, 2005==
At the 2005 parliamentary elections, on 6 March 2005, the party was part of the Democratic Moldova Electoral Bloc with the Democratic Party of Moldova (PDM) and Social Liberal Party (PSL), which won 28.4% of the popular vote and 34 out of 101 seats. After the elections the bloc fell apart in three parliamentary groups of the constituent parties, so the Alliance formed a separate group with 23 deputies until the 2009 elections, when they won fewer seats.

==Moldovan parliamentary election, 2009==
At the April 2009 parliamentary elections, the Our Moldova Alliance won 11 seats. With the other opposition parties, it participated in the successful blocking of the election of a presidential candidate from the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (PCRM) during the May–June 2009 presidential election, which led to new elections. At the July 2009 parliamentary election, the Our Moldova Alliance lost 4 seats, receiving a total of 7 seats. However, other opposition parties gained enough seats for a majority and the PCRM was defeated. In August 2009, the party became a political force within the Alliance For European Integration. The party lost all parliamentary representation in the 2010 parliamentary election.

<doc id="861973" wikidata="Q424145" url="?curid=861973" title="Praziquantel">
<text>Praziquantel (PZQ), sold under the brandname Biltricide among others, is a medication used to treat a number of types of parasitic worm infections in mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish. In humans specifically, it is used to treat schistosomiasis, clonorchiasis, opisthorchiasis, tapeworm infections, cysticercosis, echinococcosis, paragonimiasis, fasciolopsiasis, and fasciolosis. It should not be used for worm infections of the eye. It is taken by mouth.
Side effects in humans may include poor coordination, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and allergic reactions. While it may be used during pregnancy, it is not recommended for use during breastfeeding. Praziquantel is in the anthelmintic class of medications. It works partly by affecting the function of the worm&#x27;s sucker.
Praziquantel was approved for medical use in the United States in 1982. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==
Praziquantel is used to treat diseases caused by infection with several types of internal/gastrointestinal, and external parasites, including:
* Hydatid disease caused by infection of various organs with larval stages of tapeworms of the genus &quot;Echinococcus&quot;
* Cysticercosis caused by infection of the brain and/or muscles with the eggs and larvae of the pork tapeworm &quot;Taenia solium&quot; (though it has been judged less effective than albendazole in treatment of neurocysticercosis)
* Taeniasis caused by intestinal infection with &quot;Taenia saginata&quot; and &quot;Taenia solium&quot;
* Diphyllobothriasis caused by intestinal infection with &quot;Diphyllobothrium latum&quot;
* Hymenolepiasis caused by &quot;Hymenolepis nana&quot; and &quot;Hymenolepis diminuta&quot;
* Bertielliasis caused by intestinal infection with &quot;Bertiella studeri&quot;
* In dogs and cats, whose gastrointestinal tracts are infected with the tapeworms &quot;Dipylidium caninum&quot; or &quot;Taenia taeniaeformis&quot;, respectively; praziquantel is also often used in fixed combination with pyrantel embonate against the roundworms (ascarids): &quot;Toxocara cati&quot; and &quot;Toxascaris leonina&quot;. Praziquantel is also effective against &quot;Echinococcus multilocularis&quot;.
* Schistosomiasis caused by trematodes of the genus &quot;Schistosoma&quot;: As of 2005, praziquantel is the primary treatment for human schistosomiasis, for which it is usually effective in a single dose.
* Clonorchiasis brought on by the Chinese liver fluke &quot;Clonorchis sinensis&quot;
* Opisthorchiasis brought on by the liver flukes &quot;Opisthorchis viverrini&quot; and &quot;Opisthorchis felineus&quot;
* Paragonimiasis caused by infection with lung flukes, mostly of the species &quot;Paragonimus westermani&quot;
* Fasciolopsiasis caused by the giant intestinal fluke &quot;Fasciolopsis buski&quot;
* Echinostomiasis caused by infection with intestinal flukes of the genus &quot;Echinostoma&quot;
* Metagonimiasis caused by infection with intestinal flukes of the genus &quot;Metagonimus&quot;
* Heterophyiasis caused by the intestinal fluke &quot;Heterophyes heterophyes&quot;
* Gastrodiscoidiasis caused by the intestinal fluke &quot;Gastrodiscoides hominis&quot;

==Side effects==
The majority of side effects develop due to the release of the contents of the parasites as they are killed and the consequent host immune reaction. The heavier the parasite burden, the heavier and more frequent the side effects normally are.
* Central nervous system (CNS): Frequently occurring side effects are dizziness, headache, and malaise. Drowsiness, somnolence, fatigue, and vertigo have also been seen. Almost all patients with cerebral cysticercosis experience CNS side effects related to the cell-death of the parasites (headache, worsening of pre-existing neurological problems, seizures, arachnoiditis, and meningism). These side effects may be life-threatening and can be reduced by coadministration of corticosteroids. All patients with cerebral cysticercosis are strongly recommended to be hospitalized during treatment.
* Gastrointestinal tract: About 90% of all patients have abdominal pain or cramps with or without nausea and vomiting. Diarrhea may develop and may be severe with colic. Sweating, fever, and sometimes bloody stools may occur together with diarrhea.
* Liver: Asymptomatic and transient increases of liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are noted frequently (up to 27%). No case of symptomatic liver damage has been seen so far.
* Sensitivity reactions: Urticaria, rash, pruritus and eosinophilia in white blood cell counts
* Other locations/body as a whole: Lower back pain, myalgia, arthralgia, fever, sweating, various cardiac arrhythmias, and hypotension

===Pregnancy===
The WHO states praziquantel is safe during pregnancy (although does not recommend use during the first trimester). Animal studies have failed to reveal evidence of fetal harm. Praziquantel is effective in reducing schistosomiasis during pregnancy. Another trial found that treatment with praziquantel did not increase the rates of low birthweight, fetal death, or congenital anomalies.

==Drug interactions==
The antibiotic rifampicin decreases plasma concentrations of praziquantel.

Carbamazepine and phenytoin are reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel. Chloroquine also reduces its bioavailability.

The drug cimetidine heightens praziquantel bioavailability.

==Mechanism of action==
The drug&#x27;s mode of action is not exactly known at present, but experimental evidence indicates praziquantel increases the permeability of the membranes of schistosome cells towards calcium ions. The drug thereby induces contraction of the parasites&#x27; muscle, resulting in paralysis in the contracted state. The dying parasites are dislodged from their site of action in the host organism and may enter systemic circulation or may be destroyed by host immune reaction (phagocytosis). Additional mechanisms including focal disintegrations and disturbances of oviposition (laying of eggs) are seen in other types of sensitive parasites.

Another hypothesis regarding the mechanism of action is that it interferes with adenosine uptake in worms. This effect may have therapeutical relevance given that the schistosome, as the &quot;Taenia&quot; and the &quot;Echinococcus&quot; (other praziquantel-sensitive parasites), is unable to synthesize purines, such as adenosine, &quot;de novo&quot;.

Bayer&#x27;s Animal Health Division website states, &quot;Praziquantel is active against cestodes (tapeworms). Praziquantel is absorbed, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in the bile. Upon entering the digestive tract from the bile, cestocidal activity is exhibited. Following exposure to praziquantel, the tapeworm loses its ability to resist digestion by the mammalian host. Because of this, whole tapeworms, including the scolices (plural of &quot;scolex&quot;), are very rarely passed after administration of praziquantel. In many instances, only disintegrated and partially digested pieces of tapeworms will be seen in the stool. The majority of tapeworms are digested and are not found in the feces.&quot;

Praziquantel is administered as a racemate, but only the (&quot;R&quot;)-enantiomer is biologically active; the enantiomers may be separated using a resolution of an amine obtained from praziquantel.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Praziquantel is well absorbed (about 80%) from the gastrointestinal tract. However, due to extensive first-pass metabolism, only a relatively small amount enters systemic circulation. Praziquantel has a serum half-life of 0.8 to 1.5 hours in adults with normal renal and liver function. Metabolites have a half-life of 4 to 5 hours. In patients with significantly impaired liver function (Child-Pugh score B and C), the serum half-life is increased to 3 to 8 hours. Praziquantel and its metabolites are mainly excreted renally; within 24 h after a single oral dose, 70 to 80% is found in urine, but less than 0.1% as the unchanged drug. Praziquantel is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 pathway via CYP3A4. Agents that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 such as phenytoin, rifampin, and azole antifungals will affect the metabolism of praziquantel.

Praziquantel has a particularly dramatic effect on patients with schistosomiasis. Studies of those treated have shown that within six months of receiving a dose of praziquantel, up to 90% of the damage done to internal organs due to schistosomiasis infection can be reversed.

==History==
Praziquantel was developed in the laboratories for parasitological research of Bayer AG and Merck KGaA in Germany (Elberfeld and Darmstadt) in the mid-1970s.

<text>Salvinorins are a group of natural chemical compounds and their structural analogs. Several salvinorins have been isolated from &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot;. They are classified as diterpenoid furanolactones. Salvinorin A is a hallucinogen with dissociative effects.

Several salvinorins have been isolated and characterized.

== Occurrence ==
Originally isolated from &quot;S. divinorum&quot;, salvinorins are also detected in smaller amounts in:
* &quot;Salvia recognita&quot; (salvinorin A, 212.9 μg/g)
* &quot;Salvia absconditiflora&quot; (salvinorin A at 51.5 μg/g, and salvinorin B at 402.2 μg/g)
* &quot;Salvia glutinosa&quot; (salvinorin A, 38.9 μg/g)
* &quot;Salvia potentillifolia&quot; (salvinorin B, 2352.0 μg/g)
* &quot;Salvia adenocaulon&quot; (salvinorin B, 768.8 μg/g)

For comparison, the amount of salvinorin A in &quot;S. divinorum&quot; ranges from 0.89 to 3.70 mg/g. All fractions reported are based on dry mass.

Interestingly, the above reported species are not very closely related to &quot;S. divinorum&quot;.

== Associated compounds ==

In search for useful biological activity, several synthetic and semi-synthetic analogs have been prepared for study. Semi-synthetic analogs include salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether and salvinorin B methoxymethyl ether. Fully synthetic analogs include herkinorin.

Several derivates can be conveniently made from salvinorin B. Most derivatives are selective kappa opioid agonists as with salvinorin A, although some are even more potent, with the most potent compound 2-ethoxymethyl salvinorin B being ten times stronger than salvinorin A. Some derivatives, such as herkinorin, reduce kappa opioid action and instead act as mu opioid agonists.

22-Thiocyanato-salvinorin A is notable because of its functional selectivity. 2-Methoxymethyl Salvinorin B is seven times more potent than Salvinorin A at KOPr in GTP-γS assays.

Many other terpenoids have been isolated from &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot;, including classes named divinatorins and salvinicins. None of these compounds have shown significant (sub-micromolar) affinity at the kappa-opioid receptor, and there is no evidence that they contribute to the plant&#x27;s psychoactivity.

They include: Fukushima Joins Titanic, Katrina as a Single Word for Disaster, March 16, 2011, Fukushima: A Nuclear Threat to Japan, the U.S. and the World, April 6, 2011 and Fukushima and Nuclear Power: Playing with Fire, April 25, 2011. He also is the author of twelve analytical reports about the threat of pandemic influenza, has written guest editorials and been asked to speak about several issues, including the challenges facing large pharmaceutical companies, the need to restructure the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and difficulties facing the U.S. healthcare system.

Brozak participated in the production of two films- as an Associate Producer of &quot;Money for Nothing: Inside the Federal Reserve&quot; (2013) and as Executive Producer of &quot;American Veteran&quot; (2017).

Brozak was Chairman and CEO of StormBio, Inc, a development stage biotechnology company focused on the attenuation of Cytokine Storm, specifically in influenza. StormBio was developing therapeutics to minimize the mortality and morbidity resulting from Highly Pathogenic Influenza infections, such as H5N1 and H1N1 influenza strains.

StormBio&#x27;s approach was to modulate runaway inflammation. Many of the deaths and much of the permanent damage from influenza is caused by a runaway inflammatory process called cytokine storm. It was anticipated that StormBio&#x27;s therapeutics also could be used to treat a variety of other inflammatory conditions. StormBio was affiliated with leading scientists in the field of inflammation and had in-licensed intellectual property and novel therapeutics directed at treating people in the event of an influenza pandemic.

===Political life===

Campaigning for Congress during the 2004 election, Brozak kicked off his campaign with a front-page feature story, &quot;A Marine Jumps Party Lines to Join Democrats in Trenches&quot;, in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, where he gave early warning of the nearly insurmountable challenges faced by the shortage of U.S. troops in Iraq and the need for a modified strategy to subdue insurgency and create a secure nation in Iraq. His campaign focused on the lack of planning for the Iraq war, the strain it placed on our military, and the severe economic repercussions that would ensue—specifically the rise in energy prices. He also stressed the need for unfettered research in stem cells and the need for a fair trade policy with other countries. Brozak was featured in an article in the magazine Salon, which described his campaign as &quot;a referendum on Bush&#x27;s military folly.&quot;

During his Congressional campaign, Brozak was invited to speak during prime time at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, where he criticized the Bush administration for lack of planning prior to the war in Iraq. He was later criticized by bloggers in the Internet publication, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; for his strong position against administration partisanship in political appointments at the Pentagon. Brozak was defeated by incumbent Mike Ferguson (Republican) for New Jersey&#x27;s 7th Congressional District.

===Military career===
Brozak is a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Marine Corps, having served in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and the Caribbean. He has been attached to units within the United Nations, specifically as a Foreign area officer at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, and as a Public Information Officer in the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH). Brozak was also attached to units within NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and has worked with the Inter-American Defense Board.

Brozak resumed active duty service in the Marine Corps immediately after the September 11 attacks in 2001 as Officer in Charge of Mobilization Training Unit NY- 17 in New York City. He later served as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, leading a team to the Middle East to evaluate National Guard and Reserve mobilization. Upon returning from Iraq, his team wrote a report that criticized the lack of troop strength and drain on the reserves caused by the Iraq/Afghanistan deployments. His subsequent active duty assignment before retiring was Chief Spokesperson for OSD&#x27;s National Committee for the Employer support of the Guard and Reserve in Washington D.C. Brozak participated as a Marine Corps officer representing the Department of Navy and Marine Corps retirees on the SECNAV Retiree Council. Brozak was twice awarded the Navy/Marine Corps Meritorious Service Medal, his last one for his efforts in Washington.

==Personal life==
Born in 1961, Brozak is married and has two children. Brozak has been a resident of Westfield, New Jersey.

<text>The Danish Social Liberal Party (, RV, ) is a social-liberal political party in Denmark. The party was founded as a split from the Venstre Reform Party in 1905.

Historically, the centrist party has played a central role in Danish politics and has supported governments on both sides of the political spectrum, as co-operation is a primary belief of the party. A pro-European party, it is a member of Liberal International and the ALDE, and has one MEP in the Renew Europe group in the European Parliament.

==History==

=== 1905–1930s ===
The party was founded in 1905 as a split from the &quot;Venstre&quot;. The initial impetus was the expulsion of &quot;Venstre&quot;&#x27;s antimilitarist wing from the party in January 1905. The expelled members held a founding conference for the new party in Odense, on 21 May 1905. In addition to the differences over military spending, the social liberals also took a more positive view than Venstre towards measures that aimed to reduce social inequality. The party also became the political leg of the cultural radical movement. The party was cautiously open to aspects of the welfare state, and also advocated reforms to improve the position of smallholders, an important early group of supporters. The party&#x27;s social-liberal ideals are said to have been inspired by the political economists Henry George and John Stuart Mill. Until 1936 party was member of the International Entente of Radical and Similar Democratic Parties.

The first Social Liberal Cabinet was formed in 1909 with Carl Theodor Zahle serving as Prime Minister (1909–1910). From 1913 to 1920, Zahle led the second Social Liberal Cabinet with the Social Democrats serving as parliamentary support, keeping Denmark neutral during World War I. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the party served as coalition partners along with the Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning, and managed to lead the country through the recession by implementing far-reaching social reforms.

=== Post-World War II ===
After 1945, the party continued with its pragmatic ways, influencing either as coalition partner as parliamentary support. From 1957 to 1964 they served as coalition partners in a Social Democratic led government, while Hilmar Baunsgaard served as Prime Minister 1968–1971 in a coalition government with Venstre and the Conservative People&#x27;s Party as partners. In the 1968 general elections the party reached an all-time high of 15% of the vote, while they only received 11.2% in the 1973 landslide election.

During the 1980s, the party served either as parliamentary support or as coalition partner in various Conservative led governments.

After an all-time low in the 1990 general elections (where the party only received 3.5% of the vote), the party once again started cooperating with the Social Democrats under leadership of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, participating in a coalition government in 1993.

=== 2001–present ===
In the early 2000s, the political scene was marked by &quot;bloc&quot;-politics, with &quot;blue bloc&quot; being led by Venstre and &quot;red bloc&quot; by the Social Democrats. The Danish People&#x27;s Party overtook the Social Liberals&#x27; key position as prime candidate for parliamentary support. Furthermore, the DPP&#x27;s anti-immigrant policies made the Social Liberals profile themselves as a progressive party being pro-globalisation, pro-EU and more tolerant towards refugees and immigrants. At the same time the party profiled itself on reforming the welfare system, campaigning to abolish &quot;efterløn&quot; and lower taxes. As such the party served to unite a modern social profile with a more liberal economic profile. This served to appeal the more well-educated urbanised parts of the country, resulting in 9.2% of the vote at the 2005 general elections.

In a 2006 press release, they tried to mark themselves as once again being able to lead a government, doing away with the presumption of the party only being able to serve as government partner or parliamentary support. The strategy proved unpopular both among voters and within the party itself. On 7 May 2007 MP Naser Khader and MEP Anders Samuelsen left the party and formed the New Alliance, known today as the Liberal Alliance, along with Conservative MEP Gitte Seeberg. At a press conference on 15 June 2007, it was announced that MP Margrethe Vestager would take over leadership of the party after Marianne Jelved, and that the party would rethink its strategy. The party returned to its historical role as possible coalition partner and at the political centre of Danish politics. Vestager clarified during the run-up to the 2007 general election that her party would only be supporting a government led by the Social Democrats. Still, the party only won 5.1% of the vote.

At the subsequent 2011 general elections, the party support rose to 9.5% and regained eight seats to resume a total of 17. Together with the Social Democrats and the Socialist People&#x27;s Party, they formed a three-way government coalition.

On 31 August 2014, Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt nominated Margrethe Vestager as Denmark&#x27;s EU Commissioner, resulting in her resignation as party leader. The party&#x27;s parliamentary group subsequently elected Morten Østergaard as new leader.

At the 2015 general elections, the party lost nine out of 17 seats and was reduced to 4.6%. The party lost a share of its voters to the newly formed The Alternative, a Green political party formed by former member of the party Uffe Elbæk.

At the 2019 general elections, the party rose to 8.6% of the vote, doubling its number of seats to 16. Østergaard stated that he would support a government led by the Social Democrats only if changes would be made to the previous government&#x27;s strict immigration policies.

On 7 October 2020, Morten Østergaard stepped down as leader of the party following allegations of sexual harassment from within the party. Sofie Carsten Nielsen was elected new leader the same day.

Nielsen resigned on 2 November 2022, following the loss of nine out of 16 seats in the 2022 Danish general election. The Social Liberal Party had instigated the election by threatening a vote of no confidence against Mette Frederiksen&#x27;s government in July 2022 due to the 2020 Danish mink cull. One day later, Martin Lidegaard became leader of the party.

== Relationship to other parties ==
The Danish Social Liberal Party has traditionally kept itself in the centre of the political scale. Since the early 1990s, though, it has primarily cooperated with the Social Democrats. Internationally, the party has cooperated with the Swedish Centre Party and Liberals, the Norwegian Venstre party, the Dutch Democrats 66, and the British Liberal Democrats.

== Etymology ==
The literal translation of the party&#x27;s name &quot;Radical Left&quot; refers to its origin as the historically radical wing of its parent party Venstre (&quot;Left&quot;). In a modern context, this literal translation is somewhat misleading, as the party is considered to be centrist in the Danish political spectrum. The use of &quot;Left&quot; in the name of the party, as with the Norwegian party Venstre, is meant to refer to liberalism and not modern left-wing politics. The Danish Venstre was originally to the left of the conservative and aristocratic right-wing party Højre, whose name meant &quot;Right&quot;.

<doc id="862016" wikidata="Q2198161" url="?curid=862016" title="Leech (character)">
<text>Leech is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Leech made his first appearance in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; as a Morlock, a group of mutants whose deformities force them to live in the sewers under Manhattan. He is usually depicted as being around twelve years old (his exact age is unrevealed). He speaks in broken English and refers to himself in the third person.

==Publication history==
Leech first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #179 (March 1984), and was created by Chris Claremont and John Romita Jr.

Leech appeared as part of the &quot;Morlocks&quot; entry in The &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition&quot; #9.

==Fictional character biography==

As a child, Leech was abandoned and left to die when his mutations became apparent. He was found by the Morlock Caliban and taken to a human-looking mutant woman named Annalee who raised him and several other young mutant orphans as her children. He made friends with X-Factor ward Artie Maddicks and had a few brief encounters with the X-Men.

In &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot;, Leech is one of the few survivors of the Marauders&#x27; massacre of the Morlocks. X-Factor takes him and Artie in until they can be enrolled in St. Simons, a private school that willingly accepts mutant children.

Soon after they began attending this school, Leech and Artie are captured by mutant-hunting demons. Leech&#x27;s technologically enhancing mutant friend, Taki Matsuya and an ad-hoc team of mutants, calling themselves the X-Terminators, join with the New Mutants in battling the demonic threat. They adventure through much of New York, witnessing much, such as innocent men being eaten, before the threat is contained.

Leech, Artie, and Taki return to St. Simons, though they do not stay out of trouble. Taki&#x27;s crush on a teacher leads to uncovering a plot by mutant-hating humans to kidnap and kill as many mutants as possible. The young trio disobey orders and literally fly off. After much violence, the kidnapping plans are discovered and the conspirators arrested. A nearby resident, Ida Fassbender, discovers the trio&#x27;s technologically assisted jaunts, and her paranoia endangers their lives. She resolves the problem and unofficially becomes the boys&#x27; grandmother. Leech is comforted by Ida&#x27;s resemblance to Annalee.

Another kidnapping plan works successfully and Artie and Leech are taken by the murderous mutant terrorists Gene Nation.

This group was composed of second-generation Morlocks, the descendants of those who survived the massacre in the tunnels. They were born and raised in an alternate dimension with a faster flow of time than this one, called &quot;The Hill&quot;. They sought revenge for those who wronged their forebears. Gene Nation led a campaign to hunt down and kill as many humans as possible, since it was the humans&#x27; unwillingness to accept them that forced their parents into the tunnels in which they were massacred. Leech and Artie wanted no part of this, but were trapped until they were rescued by Generation X. They were thereafter made junior members.

===Generation X===

Leech and Artie continued to live in the Massachusetts Academy under the care of Emma Frost and Sean Cassidy. They are later joined by Franklin Richards, who stays at the school while suffering from the loss of his family. Their friendship has unexpected benefits, as Leech is able to control Franklin&#x27;s powers when they, aggravated by his grief, go out of control.

The three visit the farm belonging to Hank McCoy&#x27;s parents. Back at the Academy, they encounter Howard the Duck and other allies and as a group, are attacked by Black Tom Cassidy. Howard risks his life to save them all, then they are taken away by the Man-Thing. Leech and the rest have several adventures as the team called the Daydreamers. When Richards&#x27; family, who had previously been exiled to an alternate universe (see &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot;), return, the group was disbanded. Leech and Artie go back to the academy and take on more active roles.

Soon after, the school became bankrupt, and Emma and Sean were forced to open the school to human students. To keep Artie and Leech from being isolated, Emma gave them both an image inducer in the form of watches. The boys were quick to abuse this new technology, and were quickly set straight by Emma. Soon after, the school became exposed as a home for mutants, and Artie, Leech, and Penance were all sent away to protect them from any possible dangers that might arrive.

===Weapon X===

At some point, Leech is captured by the revived Weapon X program and was used by the Weapon X program to keep imprisoned mutants under control. When the program was about to be discovered, those responsible attempted to erase all information surrounding it by killing the prisoners. Leech survives and is one of the estimated 198 mutants who retained their powers after M-Day and moves to an encampment in the Xavier Institute.

When an exploding supervillain causes the general public to turn on superheroes, Domino, Shatterstar, and Caliban break out the 198 and take them to a bunker in the middle of the desert. They are sealed inside with nuclear weapons that are activated for self-detonation, but they are eventually freed from the bunker. Leech accompanies Caliban down to the old Morlock tunnels where they are attacked by an extremist group of Morlocks led by Masque, who after knocking out Caliban, kidnaps Leech because he needs Leech&#x27;s powers. He is then rescued by the X-Men and Skids.

Leech and Artie Maddicks were invited to Franklin Richards&#x27;s birthday, and as a gift, Franklin invited them to live with the Fantastic Four. The two are now in a special class with intelligent moloids, Alex Power (Zero-G) of the Power Pack and other gifted kids. It is later revealed that Leech&#x27;s cancelling powers were the reason that Reed Richards wanted him to be with Franklin. Leech later joins Reed&#x27;s new Future Foundation superhero team.

==Powers and abilities==
Leech can dampen or completely suppress, for an undetermined amount of time, the powers and abilities of any superpowered beings within 50 feet of him. His dampening ability in the beginning was involuntary and uncontrollable, but now his ability appears to be under his conscious control. Leech explained to Johnny Dee he could consciously bring his dampening field in close, so that persons are not dampened unless they touch him.

Leech has also been shown to dampen abilities that are non-mutant in origin at times, like the Fantastic Four, Hazmat of the Avengers Academy, and during Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; event, Leech negated the powers of the superhero team Power Pack, whose abilities were bestowed on them by an extraterrestrial.

When his ability has been targeted at mutants with super strength, at times his victims have become temporarily thin and frail.

==Reception==
In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Leech and Artie Maddicks 23rd in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.

<text>James Patrick McGranery (July 8, 1895 – December 23, 1962) was a United States representative from Pennsylvania, a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and Attorney General of the United States.

==Early life and career==

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Patrick McGranery, and Bridget (&quot;née&quot; Gallagher), both Irish immigrants, McGranery attended parochial schools and graduated from Roman Catholic High School in 1916 and Maher Preparatory School. He was in the United States Army Air Corps as an observation pilot and as an adjutant in the 111th Infantry Regiment from 1917 to 1919. He received a Bachelor of Laws from Temple University Beasley School of Law in 1928 and was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar the same year. He entered the private practice of law in Philadelphia from 1928 to 1937. He was a member of the Democratic State Committee from 1928 to 1932. He was an unsuccessful candidate for District Attorney of Philadelphia County in 1931 and for election to the 74th United States Congress in 1934. He served as Chairman of the Registration Commission of the City of Philadelphia in 1935. He was a United States representative from Pennsylvania from 1937 to 1943. He was admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States in 1939. He was an assistant to the United States Attorney General in the United States Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., from 1943 to 1946.

==Congressional service==

McGranery was elected as a Democrat to the 75th United States Congress and to the three succeeding Congresses and served from January 3, 1937, until his resignation on November 17, 1943, to become an assistant to the United States Attorney General.

==Federal judicial service==
In March, 1946, President Harry S. Truman awarded McGranery the Medal for Merit, at the time the highest civilian decoration in the United States. McGranery was nominated by President Truman on July 31, 1946, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania vacated by Judge Harry Ellis Kalodner. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 31, 1946, and received his commission on August 7, 1946. He took the oath of office on October 9, 1946. His service was terminated on May 26, 1952, due to his resignation.

==Post judicial service==

McGranery was the Attorney General of the United States from May 27, 1952, to January 20, 1953. In 1952, McGranery revoked the re-entry permit of Charlie Chaplin while the actor was voluntarily abroad, following concerns over communist sympathies. To re-enter the country, Chaplin was required by immigration law to answer questions regarding “moral turpitude,” and he instead chose to remain abroad for twenty years. McGranery returned to the private practice of law in Washington, D.C., from 1954 until his death.

==Death==

McGranery died on December 23, 1962, in Palm Beach, Florida. He was interred in Arlington National Cemetery in Fort Myer, Virginia.

<doc id="862025" wikidata="Q3790407" url="?curid=862025" title="The Pruitts of Southampton">
<text>The Pruitts of Southampton is an American situation comedy that aired during the 1966-67 season on the ABC network. The show was based on the novel &quot;House Party&quot; (1954) by Patrick Dennis. It was ABC&#x27;s attempt to turn female stand-up comic Phyllis Diller into a sitcom comedienne very much in the style of Lucille Ball. Child actress Lisa Loring formerly of TV&#x27;s &quot;The Addams Family&quot; also had a small role on the show as Phyllis&#x27;s daughter 
Suzy Pruitt.

The program starred Diller as Phyllis Pruitt, and featured Gypsy Rose Lee and Richard Deacon in supporting roles with Diller feeling the series was an inverted version of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. The show&#x27;s producers originally sought comic actress Beatrice Lillie in the Diller role. Exteriors of the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina were used as the locale.

In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it number 20 on its TV Guide&#x27;s 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time list.

==Premise==
The Pruitts, a supposedly incredibly wealthy family living on Long Island in the Hamptons, have been approached by the Internal Revenue Service about overdue taxes. An audit revealed that the Pruitts were in fact broke. Rather than reveal this fact publicly and cause the economic depression which would presumably result, an improbably charitable IRS allowed them to continue living in their mansion and maintaining the pretensions of great wealth, which was difficult given their reduced circumstances. By mid-season, in order to raise more money, Phyllis Pruitt had opened the mansion to boarders, attracting a &quot;nutty&quot; collection of tenants as well, a group that included Paul Lynde as her hopeless brother, John Astin as her brother-in-law, and Marty Ingels as a handyman.

In the premiere episode, Phyllis Pruitt unsuccessfully tries to roast a turkey in a front-loading washing machine.

==Development and history==
The show was created by executive producer David Levy, who also served in the same capacity on the ABC television series &quot;The Addams Family&quot; from 1964 to 1966. When ABC canceled that show in the spring of 1966, a few &quot;Addams Family&quot; alumni were recruited for the Diller series. Vic Mizzy, who composed the finger-snapping theme song to &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, composed the musical theme for Diller&#x27;s show as well.

According to &quot;Television&quot; magazine, &quot;The Pruitts of Southampton&quot; finished 77th among the 91 shows rated during the 1966–1967 season. It began the season airing on Tuesdays, opposite &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot; on CBS, which finished second in the ratings.

On January 13, 1967, with the episode &quot;Little Miss Fixit&quot;, the program changed its title to The Phyllis Diller Show. John Astin, who played Gomez Addams on &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, joined the cast the same month, and the show began airing on Fridays. In addition, the series marked a reunion for Astin and Marty Ingels who had starred in the 1962-1963 ABC-TV sitcom, &quot;I&#x27;m Dickens, He&#x27;s Fenster&quot;.

In the fall of 1968, NBC signed Diller to a weekly variety series hoping that the comedian would have the same kind of success that Carol Burnett had achieved for the rival network CBS. The program, entitled &quot;The Beautiful Phyllis Diller Show&quot;, did poorly in ratings and was canceled after three months.

<doc id="862027" wikidata="Q7459191" url="?curid=862027" title="Seymour Farmer">
<text>Seymour James Farmer (June 20, 1878 – January 16, 1951) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as Winnipeg MLA from 1922 to 1949. During this time he also served as mayor of Winnipeg 1923-1924 and later as city councillor in the late 1920s and in the 1930s. He was the leader of the Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation from 1935 to 1947. He served as a cabinet minister in Manitoba&#x27;s World War II coalition government.

== Early life and career ==
Farmer was born in Cardiff, Wales, the son of Seymour Farmer and Bessie Alexander Sander, and was educated there. He moved to Canada in 1900 and worked as a railway clerk. In 1910, he was Fred Dixon&#x27;s campaign manager in the latter&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for election to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. He became an accountant for the International Grain Company in 1913 and retained that position until 1927. Farmer married Lydia Gwendoline Ashton.

== Political career ==
Along with Dixon, Farmer opposed conscription during World War I. During the Conscription Crisis of 1917, he was nominated by the Anti-Conscription League to contest the federal riding of Winnipeg Centre in the 1917 federal election. He withdrew from the contest so as not to split the anti-conscriptionist vote between a Laurier Liberal and himself.

Farmer supported the Winnipeg General Strike. After the strike&#x27;s end, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1919 and 1920.

In December 1920, he was one of the founding members of Manitoba&#x27;s Independent Labour Party (ILP). He considered running for the federal riding of Winnipeg Centre in the 1921 election, but withdrew in favour of J.S. Woodsworth.

Farmer was elected the 30th mayor of Winnipeg in 1922 and 1923. He could not command majority support from the city&#x27;s councillors though. He was defeated by Ralph Webb in 1924. He later served as a councillor in 1928 and 1929, and again in the 1930s.

Farmer was also elected to the provincial legislature for Winnipeg in the 1922 election, along with fellow ILP members Fred Dixon, John Queen and William Ivens. Winnipeg at the time was a 10-seat district electing MLAs through STV. He was re-elected in the 1927 and 1932 elections.

Farmer replaced Queen as party leader in 1935. Farmer&#x27;s early years as party leader were marked by conflict between the ILP and the newly formed Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). In 1933, the ILP had affiliated with the CCF and agreed to support the CCF&#x27;s skeletal network in the province. By 1936, the CCF had grown into a more powerful organization, and many ILP members were concerned about their autonomy. There were ideological differences between the two groups: the ILP was exclusively a labour party, while the CCF wanted to reach out to farmers as well.

For the provincial election of 1936, Farmer and other candidates campaigned under the &quot;ILP-CCF&quot; banner. The Social Credit movement, with its victory in Alberta under its sails, tried for success in Manitoba. Farmer responded by writing pamphlet &quot;Social Credit or Social Ownership&quot;. In it he called for social ownership of utilities and industries and for a social dividend which was to be arrived at in different means than the social credit dividend espoused by Alberta premier William Aberhart. ILP/CCF increased their representation to seven seats.

After the election, a group of disgruntled ILP members forced a temporary disaffiliation from the CCF. Pressure from David Lewis and J. S. Woodsworth brought the two parties back in alignment, but their relationship remained tenuous.

At the start of World War II, Farmer approved of federal CCF leader Woodsworth&#x27;s pacifist stance in the House of Commons of Canada. Farmer endorsed the CCF&#x27;s call to conscript &quot;wealth rather than men&quot; for the war effort. Most of the ILP supported an all-out war effort, however. This exacerbated tensions between the groups. The ILP finally dissolved in 1943 after its internal operations had been taken over by CCF loyalists.

Throughout the 1930s, Manitoba premier John Bracken had attempted to bring the province&#x27;s opposition parties into a &quot;non-partisan&quot; coalition government. Bracken&#x27;s Progressives absorbed the provincial Liberals in 1932, but the other parties turned down his requests on two separate occasions. With the start of the war, however, &quot;non-party&quot; government became a more viable option. The Conservatives and Social Credit joined the government in 1940; despite opposition from David Lewis, Farmer convinced the CCF to do the same.

Farmer argued (somewhat dubiously) that Bracken was willing to adopt labour-friendly policies, and that the CCF would benefit more from joining government than from being the sole group in opposition. He also argued that an all-party government would defer the next provincial election for a year, ll and allow the CCF more time to organize. Lewis eventually resigned himself to the alliance, and the CCF entered Manitoba&#x27;s government in late 1940. Farmer was the first member of a social democratic party in Canada to receive a cabinet portfolio and was sworn in as Minister of Labour on 4 November.

By any measurement, the CCF&#x27;s tenure in government was a disaster for the party. While the Conservatives were fully integrated into the management of the province, Social Credit and the CCF were marginalized. Bracken forced Farmer&#x27;s labour legislation to face free votes in the legislature, which soon took the form of party votes, with the CCF invariably on the losing side.

The Manitoba CCF was demoralized in the election of 1941. Keeping an earlier pledge, it contested only ten ridings and fell from seven to three members.

Support for the CCF rose nationally throughout 1942, and there was a growing desire among many in the Manitoba party to leave the coalition. Farmer resigned from cabinet in December 1942, and the CCF formally left the government the following year.

Farmer continued as party leader through the election of 1945. The campaign was a disappointment to the party; although it received more votes than the governing Liberal-Progressives (35% to 33%), it won only ten seats in the legislature. Farmer resigned as party leader in June 1947 and was replaced the following year by E.A. Hansford.

Farmer did not contest the election of 1949 and died on January 16, 1951.

<text>Maggie Roswell (born November 14, 1952) is an American actress, comedian, writer and producer from Los Angeles, California. She is well known for her voice work on the Fox network animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, in which she has played recurring characters such as Maude Flanders, Helen Lovejoy, Miss Hoover, and Luann Van Houten, as well as several minor characters. This work has earned her an Annie Award nomination.

Roswell made her acting break-through in the 1980s with appearances in films such as &quot;Midnight Madness&quot; (1980), &quot;Lost in America&quot; (1985), and &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; (1986), and guest appearances on television shows such as &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, &quot;Masquerade&quot;, and &quot;Happy Days&quot;. She appeared frequently in the sketch comedy &quot;The Tim Conway Show&quot; from 1980 to 1981, and did voice acting for a few animated films and television shows. Roswell also performed in some theater plays, including one in 1988 directed by Julia Sweeney.

In 1989, Roswell was hired for the first season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. She played a few minor characters until she became a regular cast member with the introduction of Maude Flanders in the second season. In 1994, Roswell and her husband Hal Rayle moved from Los Angeles to Denver to raise their daughter. Together they established the Roswell &#x27;n&#x27; Rayle Company, creating and voicing advertisements for companies. Because of her move to Denver, Roswell had to travel to Los Angeles twice a week to tape &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. This ultimately led to her requesting a pay raise in 1999; however, Fox refused to offer her the amount she wanted so she quit the show. Roswell returned to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in 2002 after reaching a deal to record her lines from her Denver home.

==Career==

===First acting work===
Roswell was born on November 14, 1952, and raised in Los Angeles, California. After going to Catholic school and Los Angeles City College, she began a career in acting. In the 1970s, she made some guest appearances on television shows such as &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, but she did not gain her first big acting roles until the 1980s. In the 1980 film &quot;Midnight Madness&quot;, she played a character that leads a group of sorority sisters who are participating in a college puzzle solving race. Roswell also starred in the sketch comedy &quot;The Tim Conway Show&quot; in 1980 and 1981. She appeared in the film &quot;Lost in America&quot; (1985) as the character Patty, and she had a supporting role in the film &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; (1986). She also acted in the two-part television film &quot;The Deliberate Stranger&quot;. In addition, Roswell played some minor roles in television shows in the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, including guest appearances on &quot;Remington Steele&quot; (1983), &quot;Masquerade&quot; (1984), &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1984), &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; (1993), and &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; (1993). She was offered a chance to replace Gilda Radner on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, but turned down the offer when her agent told her &quot;the show wasn&#x27;t going anywhere.&quot;

Roswell has also worked on stage. In 1986 she appeared in improvisatory shows directed by Paul Sills at Lamb&#x27;s Theatre, in which the actors were given characters and situations by the audience members. In 1988, she had a role in Julia Sweeney&#x27;s play &quot;Mea&#x27;s Big Apology&quot; at Groundling Theatre in Los Angeles. She played Eunice, a cynical woman who works at a malpractice insurance company and is a colleague to the main character. The company people do everything they can to dismiss her because they do not want to pay her retirement benefits, which are about to take effect. Roswell reprised this role in a 1992 revival of the play, also at Groundling Theatre.

===Early &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Roswell &#x27;n&#x27; Rayle, pay dispute===
In addition to her live action roles, Roswell did some voice acting in animated films and shows, including the voice of Teegra in &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; from 1983. This led to her being hired on the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in 1989. Her first appearance was in the season one episode &quot;Homer&#x27;s Night Out&quot;, in which she voiced the character Princess Kashmir (a belly dancer who seduces Homer). Out of the total thirteen episodes of the first season, Roswell appeared in four; however, they were only minor roles. Roswell did not become a regular cast member until the middle of the second season in the episode &quot;Dead Putting Society&quot; (1990), with the introduction of Maude Flanders (neighbor to the Simpson family and the loving wife of Ned Flanders). Roswell went on to voice other recurring characters on the show, such as Helen Lovejoy (the reverend&#x27;s wife), Miss Hoover (an elementary school teacher), and Luann Van Houten (the mother of Bart&#x27;s best friend, Milhouse), as well as several more one-time characters and background characters. Fellow &quot;Simpsons&quot; cast member Nancy Cartwright wrote in her autobiography that &quot;Maggie Roswell has been blessed with a skill in creating one of the hardest things to create: the &#x27;normal sound,&#x27; whatever that is. So she can easily slip into the gal next door or any number of assorted reporters, medical students, jury members, accountants, scientists and moms.&quot; 

Roswell was nominated for an Emmy Award for her work on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. She also received a 1997 Annie Award nomination in the category &quot;Best Individual Achievement: Voice Acting by a Female Performer in a TV Production&quot; for her role as Shary Bobbins in the episode &quot;Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious&quot;, but lost to June Foray.

Roswell began writing, producing, and/or voicing advertisements for companies. She and her spouse established &quot;The Roswell &#x27;n&#x27; Rayle Company&quot; for this purpose, and built a recording studio in their basement. In 1994, they did radio advertisements in Denver for Burger King, Christy Sports, and an insect exhibit at the Museum of Natural History. The same year, Roswell provided her voice for Campbell&#x27;s Soup and Pontiac commercials as part of their business. The company is still active as of 2010. They are now also providing comedic ring tones.

In 1997, Roswell appeared in the film &quot;Switchback&quot; alongside Danny Glover and Dennis Quaid. 
Roswell left &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The dispute was not revealed to the press at first; Fox originally reported that she decided to quit only because she was tired of flying between Denver and Los Angeles for the recording sessions. Then Roswell announced that she had asked for a raise, not only because she was tired of the traveling, but because of the increasing cost of flight tickets. Roswell was paid $1,500 to $2,000 per episode during the three seasons before she left, and she asked Fox for a raise to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only offered her a $150 raise, which did not even cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit. She told &quot;The Denver Post&quot; that &quot;they offered me a $150 raise. I mean, that&#x27;s lint in Fox&#x27;s pocket. But Fox wanted to prove a point, I guess. I was flying myself back and forth from Denver to L.A. It was exhausting. I loved doing the show and they thought that I would come back. But now I&#x27;m busy doing other things.&quot; She further added that &quot;I was part of the backbone of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and I don&#x27;t think the money I asked for was exorbitant. I wasn&#x27;t asking for what other cast members make. I was just trying to recoup all the costs I had in travel. If they&#x27;d flown me in, I&#x27;d still be working.&quot; At that point, the six main cast members of the show were paid $125,000 per episode. As a result of Roswell&#x27;s departure, Marcia Mitzman Gaven was hired to voice her characters, with Maude Flanders killed off in the episode &quot;Alone Again, Natura-Diddily&quot;.

===Return to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and later work===
Roswell returned to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in 2002 in the season premiere of the fourteenth season, in which Maude made an appearance as a ghost. She reached a deal with Fox to record her lines from her Denver home, the dispute ended, and Roswell has remained on the show. She also appeared as Helen Lovejoy in the film &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; (2007). She attended the gala premiere together with her daughter, who was fourteen years old at the time. Roswell told &quot;The Denver Post&quot; that she was surprised she was given two tickets; &quot;Everybody in Hollywood is killing to get their kid there. My daughter&#x27;s big thrill is to meet [the band] Green Day,&quot; which also appeared in the film.

In 2004, Roswell had a minor role in the film &quot;Silver City&quot;. In 2009, she starred in the play &quot;Bunny Bunny: Gilda Radner, a Sort of Romantic Comedy&quot; at Avenue Theater in Denver. It opened in May of that year. The play recounted events in the career of actress Gilda Radner, who Roswell played, from 1975 (the start of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;) to her death in 1989.

Roswell enjoys singing. On February 7, 1999, she debuted as a nightclub singer at the Denver Chop House &amp; Brewery, where she performed on behalf of the homelessness charity Family Homestead. In June 2003, she sang at Denver&#x27;s Rattlebrain Theatre on Sunday nights with The Sirens.

==Personal life==

Roswell met fellow voice actor Hal Rayle in 1986, and they married in 1987. He had done roles such as the Predator in &quot;Predator 2&quot;, the ghoulies in &quot;Ghoulies II&quot;, and Marvin the Martian in Air Jordan commercials. They moved from Los Angeles to Denver, Colorado, in June 1994 to raise their adopted daughter, who was born in 1993. Between March and November every year, when episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; were being recorded, Roswell had to fly back to Los Angeles twice a week to attend the table reads and the recording sessions. In an article about her and her husband&#x27;s move, Ricky Lopes of &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; wrote: &quot;When &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is taping, she goes to Los Angeles every Friday morning for the first reading, flies back that afternoon, flies back Sunday to tape the show Monday and flies back home that night.&quot; Roswell said she &quot;got the idea for the way Helen Lovejoy says &#x27;B-bye, b-bye, b-bye,&#x27; to everyone when they leave the church from the way the flight attendants say it when you get off the plane.&quot;

Roswell is a registered Democrat and still adheres to the Catholic faith she was raised in.

<doc id="862034" wikidata="Q8028681" url="?curid=862034" title="Wivenhoe Park">
<text>Wivenhoe Park is a landscaped green space of more than at the eastern edge of Colchester, England. It is the site of Wivenhoe House, a four-star hotel, based in an eighteenth-century Grade II listed house. Wivenhoe House is also home to the Edge Hotel School, the first school of its kind in the UK and since October 2018 a department of the University of Essex. Since the 1960s, Wivenhoe Park has also been home to the Colchester Campus of the University of Essex.

John Constable painted the park in 1816. His painting, &quot;Wivenhoe Park&quot;, is now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC.

Wivenhoe Park has received a Green Flag Award six times and has received a Gold Award as a Hedgehog Friendly Campus. The parkland has been voted one of the top ten green spaces in the UK, in the People&#x27;s Choice Award on four consecutive occasions and is the only university campus to have achieved this award.

The park is host to a very large colony of rabbits. Habitat surveys have identified many other species at Wivenhoe Park.

== History ==
In 1845, Wivenhoe Park was inherited by John Gurdon Rebow, the widow of Mary Rebow, the daughter of Lt General Francis Slater Rebow depicted in Constable&#x27;s painting. John Gurdon Rebow rebuilt Wivenhoe House and remodelled the park.

In April 1856, Prince Albert visited Colchester to inspect the new barracks and travelled out to see some of the troops on exercise in Wivenhoe Park, presumably at the invitation of John Gurdon Rebow. A report of the royal visit to Wivenhoe Park, including an engraving, was published by the London Illustrated News. 

Wivenhoe Park was sold to the Gooch family in 1908.

== Features ==
Outstanding trees still remain at Wivenhoe Park including ancient oaks and the cork oaks planted by John Constable. A tree walk detailing close to 40 trees in the parkland was created by Christopher Howard in 2013.

Wivenhoe House is included on the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest as a Grade II* listed building. Other listed structures in Wivenhoe Park include two Gatehouses (one to the east of the house, and the other to the north-west), the Stable Block, and the boundary wall and ha-ha which provide the domestic curtilage to the house. Each of these structures is Grade II listed. Wivenhoe Park is included on the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest.

Another notable building within the grounds is the Sports Pavilion designed by influential architects John Meunier and Barry Gasson and now used by student sports teams. The design reflects some of the ideas later used in their designs for The Burrell Collection in Glasgow. 

== Constable&#x27;s painting ==
Constable was invited to stay at Wivenhoe House in August 1816. The painting depicts the parkland surrounding Wivenhoe House including cows grazing, swans on the lake and fishermen bringing in their nets. Major Rebow&#x27;s daughter, Mary Rebow, is depicted riding her donkey cart.

<text>The Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) is a communist party in India. The party was founded on 19 March 1940 by Tridib Chaudhuri and has its roots in the Bengali liberation movement Anushilan Samiti and the Hindustan Socialist Republican Army.

The party got around 0.4% of the votes and three seats in the Lok Sabha elections in 1999 and 2004. It is part of the Left Front (West Bengal), Left Front (Tripura) and Congress-led United Democratic Front (Kerala).

==History==

===Development of Anushilan Marxism===
A major section of the Anushilan movement had been attracted to Marxism during the 1930s, many of them studying Marxist–Leninist literature whilst serving long jail sentences. A minority section broke away from the Anushilan movement and joined the Communist Consolidation, and later the Communist Party of India. The majority of the Anushilan Marxists did however, whilst having adopted Marxist–Leninist thinking, feel hesitant over joining the Communist Party.

The Anushilanites distrusted the political lines formulated by the Communist International. They criticised the line adopted at the 6th Comintern congress of 1928 as &#x27;ultra-left sectarian&#x27;. The Colonial theses of the 6th Comintern congress called upon the communists to combat the &#x27;national-reformist leaders&#x27; and to &#x27;unmask the national reformism of the Indian National Congress and oppose all phrases of the Swarajists, Gandhists, etc. about passive resistance&#x27;. Moreover, when Indian left-wing elements formed the Congress Socialist Party in 1934, the CPI branded it as Social Fascist. When the Comintern policy swung towards Popular Frontism at its 1935 congress, at the time by which the majority of the Anushilan movement were adopting a Marxist–Leninist approach, the Anushilan Marxists questioned this shift as a betrayal of the internationalist character of the Comintern and felt that the International had been reduced to an agency of Soviet foreign policy. Moreover, the Anushilan Marxists opposed the notion of &#x27;Socialism in one country&#x27;.

However, although sharing some critiques against the leadership of Joseph Stalin and the Comintern, the Anushilan Marxists did not embrace Trotskyism. Buddhadeva Bhattacharya writes in &#x27;Origins of the RSP&#x27; that the &quot;rejection of Stalinism did not automatically mean for them [the Anushlian Samiti] acceptance of Trotskyism. Incidentally, the leninist conception of international socialist revolution is different from Trotsky&#x27;s theory of Permanent Revolution which deduces the necessity of world revolution primarily from the impossibility of the numerically inferior proletariat in a semi-feudal and semi-capitalist peasant country like Russia holding power for any length of time and successfully undertaking the task of socialist construction in hand without the proletariat of the advanced countries outside the Soviet Union coming to power through an extension of socialist revolution in these countries and coming to the aid of the proletariat of the U.S.S.R.&quot;

:Anushilan Marxists adhered to the Marxist–Leninist theory of &#x27;Permanent&#x27; or &#x27;Continuous&#x27; Revolution. &#x27;...it is our interest and task to make the revolution permanent&#x27; declared Karl Marx as early as 1850 in course of his famous address to the Communist League, &#x27;until all more or less possessing classes have been forced out of their position of dominance, the proletariat has conquered state power, and the association of proletarians, not only in one country but in all dominant countries of the world, has advanced so far that competition among the proletarians of these countries has ceased and that at least the decisive productive forces are concentrated in the hands of the proletarians.&#x27;&quot;

By the close of 1936, the Anushilan Marxists at the Deoli Detention Jail in Rajputana drafted a document formulating their political line. This document was then distributed amongst the Anushilan Marxists at other jails throughout the country. When they were collectively released in 1938 the Anushilan Marxists adopted this document, &quot;The Thesis and Platform of Action of the Revolutionary Socialist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist): What Revolutionary Socialism Stands for&quot;, as their political programme in September that year.

At this point, the Anushilan Marxists, recently released from long jail sentences, stood at a cross-roads. Either they would continue as a separate political entity or they would join an existing political platform. They felt that they lacked the resources to build a separate political party. Joining the CPI was out of the question, due to sharp differences in political analysis. Neither could they reconcile their differences with the Royists. In the end, the Congress Socialist Party, appeared to be the sole platform acceptable for the Anushilan Marxists. The CSP had adopted Marxism in 1936 and their third conference in Faizpur they had formulated a thesis that directed the party to work to transform the Indian National Congress into an anti-imperialist front.

During the summer of 1938, a meeting took place between Jayaprakash Narayan (leader of CSP), Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee, Tridib Chaudhuri and Keshav Prasad Sharma. The Anushilan Marxists then discussed the issue with Narendra Deva. The Anushilan Marxists decided to join CSP, but keeping a separate identity within the party.

===In the CSP===
The great majority of the Anushilan Samiti had joined the CSP, not only the Marxist sector. The non-Marxists (who constituted about a half of the membership of the Samiti), although not ideologically attracted to the CSP, felt loyalty towards the Marxist sector. Moreover, around 25% of the HSRA joined the CSP. This group was led by Jogesh Chandra Chatterji.

In the end of 1938 Anushilan Marxists began publishing &quot;The Socialist&quot; from Calcutta. The editor of the journal was Satish Sarkar. Although the editorial board included several senior CSP leaders like Acharya Narendra Deva, it was essentially an organ of the Anushilan Marxist tendency. Only a handful issues were published.

The Anushilan Marxists were soon to be disappointed by developments inside the CSP. The party, at that the time Anushilan Marxists had joined it, was not a homogenous entity. There was the Marxist trend led by J.P. Narayan and Narendra Deva, the Fabian socialist trend led by Minoo Masani and Asoka Mehta and a Gandhian socialist trend led by Ram Manohar Lohia and Achyut Patwardan. To the Anushilan Marxists differences emerged between the ideological stands of the party and its politics in practice. These differences surfaced at the 1939 annual session of the Indian National Congress at Tripuri. Ahead of the session there were fierce political differences between the leftwing Congress president, Subhas Chandra Bose, and the section led by Gandhi. As the risk of world war loomed, Bose wanted to utilise the weakening of the British empire for the sake of Indian independence. Bose was re-elected as the Congress president, defeating the Gandhian candidate. But at the same session a proposal was brought forward by Govind Ballabh Pant, through which gave Gandhi veto over the formation of the Congress Working Committee. In the Subjects Committee, the CSP opposed the resolution along with other leftwing sectors. But when the resolution was brought ahead of the open session of the Congress, the CSP leaders remained neutral. According to Subhas Chandra Bose himself, the Pant resolution would have been defeated if the CSP had opposed it in the open session. J.P. Narayan stated that although the CSP was essentially supporting Bose&#x27;s leadership, they were not willing to risk the unity of the Congress. Soon after the Tripuri session the CSP organised a conference in Delhi, in which fierce criticism was directed against their &#x27;betrayal&#x27; at Tripuri.

The Anushilan Marxists had clearly supported Bose both in the presidential election as well by opposing the Pant resolution. Jogesh Chandra Chatterji renounced his CSP membership in protest against the action by the party leadership.

Soon after the Tripuri session, Bose resigned as Congress president and formed the Forward Bloc. The Forward Bloc was intended to function as a unifying force for all leftwing elements. The Forward Bloc held its first conference on 22–23 June 1939, and at the same time a Left Consolidation Committee consisting of the Forward Bloc, CPI, CSP, the Kisan Sabha, League of Radical Congressmen, Labour Party and the Anushilan Marxists. Bose wanted the Anushilan Marxists to join his Forward Bloc. But the Anushilan Marxists, although supporting Bose&#x27;s anti-imperialist militancy, considered that Bose&#x27;s movement was nationalistic and too eccletic. The Anushilan Marxists shared Bose&#x27;s view that the relative weakness of the British empire during the war should have been utilised by independence movement. At this moment, in October 1939, J.P. Narayan tried to stretch out an olive branch to the Anushilan Marxists. He proposed the formation of a &#x27;War Council&#x27; consisting of himself, Pratul Chandra Ganguli, Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee and Acharya Narendra Deva. But few days later, at a session of the All India Congress Committee, J.P. Narayan and the other CSP leaders pledged not to start any other movements parallel to those initiated by Gandhi.

===Foundation of RSPI(ML)===
The Left Consolidation Committee soon fell into pieces, as the CPI, the CSP and the Royists deserted it. Bose assembled the Anti-Compromise Conference in Ramgarh, Bihar, now Jharkhand. The Forward Bloc, the Anushilan Marxists (still members of the CSP at the time), the Labour Party and the Kisan Sabha attended the conference. The conference spelled out that no compromise towards Britain should be made on behalf of the Indian independence movement. At that conference the Anushilan Marxists assembled to launch their own party, the Revolutionary Socialist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist), severing all links to the CSP. The first general secretary of the party was Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee.

The first War Thesis of RSP in 1940 took the call for &quot;turning imperialist war into civil war&quot;. But after the attack by Germany on the Soviet Union, the line of the party was clarified. RSP meant that the socialist Soviet Union had to be defended, but that the best way for Indian revolutionaries to do that was to overthrow the colonial rule in their own country. RSP was in sharp opposition to groups like Communist Party of India and the Royist RDP, who meant that antifascists had to support the Allied war effort.

===After Independence===
In October 1949, the Kerala Socialist Party passed through a split. A section of its cadres, like N. Sreekandan Nair, Baby John and K. Balakrishnan, joined RSP and built a branch of the party in Kerala.

Ahead of the 1952 general election, negotiations took place between RSP and the United Socialist Organisation of India. USOI, a coalition of socialist groups, wanted RSP to join its ranks. RSP declined, but a partial electoral agreement was made. USOI supported RSP candidates in two Lok Sabha constituencies in West Bengal, but in other constituencies USOI and RSP candidates contested against each other. In the end, three RSP candidates were elected, two from Bengal and one from Kerala.

In 1953 Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee left the party and rejoined the Indian National Congress. Tribid Kumar Chaudhuri became the new general secretary of the party.

In 1969 RSP sympathizers in East Pakistan formed the Sramik Krishak Samajbadi Dal. RSP and SKSD maintains a close relations from that moment onwards.

Ahead of the 1977 elections, a section of the party in Kerala broke away and formed the National Revolutionary Socialist Party. The NRSP contested the election in alliance with the Communist Party of India (Marxist).

==Recent history==
In 2000 a severe split affected the Kerala branch, when the regional party chief Baby John broke away and formed Revolutionary Socialist Party (Bolshevik). The RSP(B) joined the Congress-led United Democratic Front.

In 2002 RSP supported, along with the other Left Front parties, the presidential candidature of Lakshmi Sahgal. Saghal, who challenged the main candidate A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, got around 10% of the votes.

The erstwhile RSP, which was part of the LDF for almost three decades, decided to walk out of the LDF in March 2014, after the CPI(M) arbitrarily announced the candidature of politburo member and sitting legislator M. A. Baby for the Kollam Lok Sabha seat. Later RSP was offered the loksabha seat by the UDF. The RSP candidate N. K. Premachandran defeated LDF candidate M.A. Baby in the election of 2014. Later in June 2014, both the factions of RSP in Kerala- RSP(B) and RSP merged. Later, a faction headed by Kovoor Kunjumon left the party to form a new party named Revolutionary Socialist Party (Leninist). The main faction of the RSP successfully defended its bastion Kollam Loksabha seat in 2019 fielding N. K. Premachandran again despite aggressive campaign by the LDF but suffered huge defeats in the 2016 and 2021 Kerala Legislative Assembly elections, with all its candidates losing. But, Kovoor Kunjumon was elected to the Legislative Assembly from Kunnathur, and his party supports the LDF.

==Current situation==
In Kerala, RSP is the part of UDF and N K Premachandran is the present MP (Kollam Lok Sabha) in the Lok Sabha. RSP(L) is the part of LDF in Kerala and Kovoor Kunjumon is the present MLA (Kunnathoor) in Kerala Assembly. RSP is part of the Left Front in West Bengal and Tripura.

<text>Links between creativity and mental health have been extensively discussed and studied by psychologists and other researchers for centuries. Parallels can be drawn to connect creativity to major mental disorders including bipolar disorder, autism, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, OCD and ADHD. For example, studies have demonstrated correlations between creative occupations and people living with mental illness. There are cases that support the idea that mental illness can aid in creativity, but it is also generally agreed that mental illness does not have to be present for creativity to exist.

== History ==
It has been proposed that there is a link between creativity and mental illness. Major depressive disorder appears among playwrights, novelists, biographers, and artists at a higher rate than the general population. Association between mental illness and creativity first appeared in academic literature in the 1970s, but speculation about a link between &quot;madness&quot; and &quot;genius&quot; dates back at least to the time of Aristotle, to whom Seneca attributes the aphorism &quot;No great mind has ever existed without a touch of madness.&quot; The word &quot;genius&quot; may refer to literary genius, creative genius, scholarly genius, &quot;all around&quot; genius, etc. The Ancient Greeks believed that creativity came from the gods, in particular the Muses (the mythical personifications of the arts and sciences, the nine daughters of Zeus). In the Aristotelian tradition, genius was viewed from a physiological standpoint, and it was believed that the same human quality was perhaps responsible for both extraordinary achievement and melancholy. On this topic, Romantic writers had similar ideals, with Lord Byron having pleasantly expressed, &quot;We of the craft are all crazy. Some are affected by gaiety, others by melancholy, but all are more or less touched&quot;.

Individuals with mental illness are said to display a capacity to see the world in a novel and original way; literally, to see things that others cannot. However, people do not require a mental illness to do so.

== Studies ==
For many years, the creative arts, from visual arts and writing to music and drama, have been used in therapy for those recovering from mental illness or addiction.

Another study found that increased levels of creativity were more common amongst those with schizotypal personality disorder than in people with either schizophrenia or people without mental health diagnoses. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the prefrontal cortex, schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their &quot;right&quot; prefrontal cortex. This study hypothesized that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. Consistent with this hypothesis, ambidexterity is also more common in people with schizotypal personality disorder as well as people with schizophrenia.

Three studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal and hypomanic personality and several different measures of creativity. Specifically, Divergent Thinking Fluency, the Biographical Inventory of Creative Behaviors, as well as Self-rated Creativity.

Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and mood disorders, particularly manic-depressive disorder (a.k.a. bipolar disorder) and depressive disorder (a.k.a. unipolar disorder). In &quot;Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament&quot;, Kay Redfield Jamison summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in writers, poets and artists. She also explores research that identifies mood disorders in such famous writers and artists as Ernest Hemingway (who shot himself after electroconvulsive treatment), Virginia Woolf (who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on), composer Robert Schumann (who died in a mental institution), and famed visual artist Michelangelo.

A study by Simon Kyaga and others looked at 300,000 people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or unipolar depression, and their relatives, and found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives.

A study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to kill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder.

However, as a broader group, those in the creative professions (defined as &quot;scientific and artistic occupations&quot;) were no more likely to experience psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the &quot;Journal of Psychiatric Research&quot; reports.

Research in this area is usually constrained to cross-section data-sets. One of the few exceptions is an economic study of the well-being and creative output of three famous music composers over their entire lifetime. The emotional indicators are obtained from letters written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Liszt, and the results indicate that negative emotions had a causal impact on the creative production of the artists studied.

Psychological stress has also been found to impede spontaneous creativity. In fact, Robert Epstein describes it as a creativity killer. Instead, people must work to cultivate creativity like any other skill. He found that capturing your ideas, seeking out challenges, increasing your knowledge, and surrounding yourself with others who do the same help creativity grow rather than focusing on your stress.

A 2005 study at the Stanford University School of Medicine measured creativity by showing children figures of varying complexity and symmetry and asking whether they like or dislike them. The study showed for the first time that a sample of children who either have or are at high risk for bipolar disorder tend to dislike simple or symmetric symbols more. Children with bipolar parents who were not bipolar themselves also scored higher dislike scores.

A study by Sally Anne Gross and George Musgrave suggested that high levels of self-reported anxiety and depression amongst musicians might be explained, at least in part, by the nature of their working conditions.

== Mood and creativity ==
There have been many studies on the correlation between mood and creativity with very different results. Some studies seem to show a correlation between positive mood (affect) and heightened creativity. Other studies show that negative moods seem to be correlated with heightened creativity. One such research paper concludes, &quot;Negative moods signal that the status quo is problematic and that additional effort needs to be exerted to come up with new and useful ideas.&quot; The debate is not binary, with some studies saying that both positive and negative emotions play a role in creativity. Additionally, the connection between mood and creativity is rarely direct; rather, being in certain moods forces or fosters people into certain actions that make them more creative at the moment. For instance, negative emotions have been shown to increase the amount a person will reflect and ruminate, which then can cause a person to be more creative.

== Bipolar disorder ==

Bipolar disorder may stimulate creativity, as manic episodes can include prolonged periods of elevated energy. The first empirical study about this topic was done by Nancy Andreasen in the 1970s. She expected for the correlation to be between Creativity and Schizophrenia. She instead discovered that the correlation was actually between creativity and those with mood disorders. Specifically, that 80% of her sample had experienced at least one major episode. In her follow-up study 15 years later, she found that 43% had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and 2 had committed suicide. In her book &quot;Touched with Fire&quot;, American clinical psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison wrote that 38% of writers and poets had been treated for a type of mood disorder, and 89% of creative writers and artists had experienced &quot;intense, highly productive, and creative episodes&quot;. These were characterized by &quot;pronounced increases in enthusiasm, energy, self-confidence, speed of mental association, fluency of thought and elevated mood&quot;. Although mania is characterized by reckless and possibly self-destructive behavior, in milder forms, the energy and free-flowing thinking of mania can fuel creativity.

There is a range of types of bipolar disorder. Individuals with Bipolar I Disorder experience severe episodes of mania and depression with periods of wellness between episodes. The severity of the manic episodes can mean that the person is seriously disabled and unable to express the heightened perceptions and flight of thoughts and ideas in a practical way. Individuals with Bipolar II Disorder experience milder periods of hypomania during which the flight of ideas, faster thought processes and ability to take in more information can be converted to art, poetry or design. In a study done by Shapiro and Weisberg, they found that it was not the depressive episodes, but rather coming out of them that sparked the creativity. Specifically, the self-image that one has during hypomania causing them to be more self-confident and allows them to have the confidence to create.

Dutch artist Vincent Van Gogh is widely theorised to have had bipolar disorder. Other notable creative people with bipolar disorder include Carrie Fisher, Demi Lovato, Kanye West, Stephen Fry (who has cyclothymia, a milder and more chronic form of bipolar disorder), Mariah Carey, Jaco Pastorius, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ronald Braunstein, and Patty Duke.

== Schizophrenia ==
People with schizophrenia live with positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. Positive symptoms (psychotic behaviors that are not present in healthy people) include hallucinations, delusions, thought and movement disorders. Negative symptoms (abnormal functioning of emotions and behavior) include flat affect, anhedonia, among others. Cognitive symptoms include problems with executive functioning, attention, and memory. One artist known for his schizophrenia was the Frenchman Antonin Artaud, founder of the Theatre of Cruelty movement. In &quot;Madness and Modernism&quot; (1992), clinical psychologist Louis A. Sass noted that many common traits of schizophrenia – especially fragmentation, defiance of authority, and multiple viewpoints – happen to also be defining features of modern art. However, it has been found that those who have it are the most creative either before or after active periods, not during them.

Multiple research studies study a link between reduced latent inhibition, and the psychopathology of acute-phase schizophrenia. This is suggestive of a correlation between psychopathology and creativity, but should not be interpreted as a causal relationship.

== Arguments that support link ==
In a 2002 conversation with Christopher Langan, educational psychologist Arthur Jensen stated that the relationship between creativity and mental disorder &quot;has been well researched and is proven to be a fact&quot;, writing that schizothymic characteristics are somewhat more frequent in philosophers, mathematicians, and scientists than in the general population. In a 2015 study, Iceland scientists found that people in creative professions are 25% more likely to have gene variants that increase the risk of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, with deCODE Genetics co-founder Kári Stefánsson saying, &quot;Often, when people are creating something new, they end up straddling between sanity and insanity. I think these results support the concept of the mad genius.&quot;

=== Bipolar disorder ===
Many famous historical figures gifted with creative talents may have been affected by bipolar disorder. Ludwig van Beethoven, Kanye West, Virginia Woolf, Ernest Hemingway, Isaac Newton, Judy Garland, Jaco Pastorius and Robert Schumann are some people whose lives have been researched to discover signs of mood disorder. In many instances, creativity and mania – the overwhelming highs that bipolar individuals often experience – share some common traits, such as a tendency for &quot;thinking outside the box,&quot; flights of ideas, the speeding up of thoughts and heightened perception of visual, auditory and somatic stimuli.

It has been found that the brains of creative people are more open to environmental stimuli due to smaller amounts of latent inhibition, an individual&#x27;s unconscious capacity to ignore unimportant stimuli. While the absence of this ability is associated with psychosis, it has also been found to contribute to original thinking. 

=== Emotions ===
Many people with bipolar disorder may feel powerful emotions during both depressive and manic phases, potentially aiding in creativity. Because mania and hypomania may decrease social inhibition, performers who have bipolar disorder may become more daring and bold during an episode. Other creators may exhibit characteristics often associated with mental illness that are not necessarily equivalent to a full-blown manic episode.

=== Posthumous diagnosis ===
Some creative people have been posthumously diagnosed as experiencing bipolar or unipolar disorder based on biographies, letters, correspondence, contemporaneous accounts, or other anecdotal material, most notably in Kay Redfield Jamison&#x27;s book &quot;Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament&quot;. &quot;Touched with Fire&quot; presents the argument that bipolar disorder, and affective disorders more generally, may be found in a disproportionate number of people in creative professions such as actors, artists, comedians, musicians, authors, performers and poets.

Scholars have also speculated that the visual artist Michelangelo lived with depression. In the book &quot;Famous Depressives: Ten Historical Sketches&quot;, MJ Van Lieburg argues that elements of depression are prominent in some of Michelangelo&#x27;s sculptures and poetry. Van Lieburg also draws additional support from Michelangelo&#x27;s letters to his father in which he states:

&quot;I lead a miserable existence and reck not of life nor honour – that is of this world; I live wearied by stupendous labours and beset by a thousand anxieties. And thus I lived for some fifteen years now and never an hour&#x27;s happiness have I had.&quot;

=== Positive correlation ===
Several recent clinical studies have also suggested that there is a positive correlation between creativity and bipolar disorder, although the relationship between the two is unclear. Temperament may be an intervening variable. Ambition has also been identified as being linked to creative output in people across the bipolar spectrum. &quot;Can Music Make You Sick? Measuring the Price of Musical Ambition&quot; by Sally Anne Gross and George Musgrave suggests that high levels of self-reported anxiety and depression amongst musicians can be explained, at least in part, by the nature of musicians&#x27; working conditions.

=== Mental illness and divergent thinking ===
In 2017, associate professor of psychiatry Gail Saltz stated that the increased production of divergent thoughts in people with mild to moderate mental illnesses leads to greater creative capacities. Saltz argued that the &quot;wavering attention and day-dreamy state&quot; of ADHD, for example, &quot;is also a source of highly original thinking... CEOs of companies such as Ikea and Jetblue have ADHD. Their creativity, out-of-the-box thinking, high energy levels, and disinhibited manner could all be a positive result of their [condition].&quot; Mania risk has also been credited with aiding in creative accomplishments because &quot;when speed of thinking increases, word associations form more freely, as do flight of ideas, because the manic mind is less inclined to filtering details that, in a normal state, would be dismissed as irrelevant.&quot;

=== Brain imaging and genetic links ===
Brain imaging studies have consistently reported that low-latent inhibition is associated with originality, creative personalities, and high levels of creative achievement. There have also been genetic studies conducted to consider genetic links between creativity and psychopathology. Several genes that have been flagged as linking to some forms of psychopathology have also been linked to creativity. These include polymorphisms of the DRD2 and DRD4 genes, the 5HT2a gene, and the NRG1 gene.

=== Correlation but not causation ===
Several studies suggest a consistent link between creativity and those with either mild forms of bipolar disorder or family histories of bipolar disorder, but not full-blown Bipolar I Disorder. These findings reiterate that creative individuals are more likely on the mild end of psychosis spectrums, but not repeatedly beyond that point. One study wrote that &quot;only elevated levels of schizotypy and psychosis-proneness found in divergent thinkers or possessing some indicators of schizotypy promotes creative achievement but not full-blown schizophrenia&quot;. Another article writes that &quot;it is likely that psychopathology and creativity are closely related; sharing many traits and antecedents but outright psychopathology may be negatively associated with creativity&quot;.

These correlations could be due, in part, to shared vulnerability factors between creativity and psychopathology, including neural hyper-connectivity, novelty salience, cognitive disinhibition, and emotional lability. There are also shared environmental factors that can simultaneously increase potential for creativity and vulnerability to psychopathology. These factors continue to drive further research, like the study &quot;Anxiety and Adverse Life Events in Professional Creative and Early Psychosis Populations&quot; (Crabtree et al.).

== Creativity and mental well-being ==
There is a popular Indian cultural belief that &quot;deep pain enhances creativity, and creative acts may actually help in healing the wounds.&quot; The healing powers of creativity are seen frequently in everyday life, as artistic outlets are often encouraged as a way to improve well-being. For many people, creativity serves to overcome psychic crises, traumatic events and depression. Creativity can also have an incredible impact on mental health and well-being by not only helping people find meaning and significance, but providing an increased sense of purpose.

== Notable individuals ==

This is a list of individuals whose creative sensibilities have been linked to their mental health.

* John Nash (1928–2015) was an American economist, noted for his contributions to game theory, who was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After undergoing several different treatments and therapies over the course of several decades, Nash effectively eschewed further psychiatric intervention and gradually adjusted to dealing with his symptoms without the usage of medications; he eventually returned to his field and earned a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994.
* Joanne Greenberg (born 1932) is an American author who wrote &quot;I Never Promised You a Rose Garden&quot; (1964), an autobiographical account of her teenage years in Chestnut Lodge working with Frieda Fromm-Reichmann. At the time she was diagnosed with schizophrenia, although two psychiatrists who examined Greenberg&#x27;s self-description in the book in 1981 concluded that she did not have schizophrenia, but had extreme depression and somatization disorder. The narrative constantly puts difference between the protagonist&#x27;s mental illness and her artistic ability. Greenberg is adamant that her creative skills flourished in spite of, not because of, her condition:
: This statement from Greenberg originally appeared on the page for &quot;Rose Garden&quot; at amazon.com and has been quoted in many places including &quot;Asylum: A Mid-Century Madhouse and Its Lessons About Our Mentally Ill Today&quot;, by Enoch Callaway, M.D. (Praeger, 2007), p. 82.
* Brian Wilson (born 1942), founding member of American rock band the Beach Boys, has bipolar and schizoaffective disorder. In 2002, after undergoing treatment, he spoke of how medication affects his creativity, explaining: &quot;I haven&#x27;t been able to write anything for three years. I think I need the demons in order to write, but the demons have gone. It bothers me a lot. I&#x27;ve tried and tried, but I just can&#x27;t seem to find a melody.&quot;
* Daniel Johnston (1961–2019) was an American singer-songwriter whose music was often attributed to his psychological issues. In a press release issued by his manager, it was requested that reporters refrain from describing Johnston as a &quot;genius&quot; due to the musician&#x27;s emotional instabilities. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s David McNamee argued that &quot;it&#x27;s almost taboo to say anything critical about Johnston. This is incredibly patronising. For one thing, it makes any honest evaluation of his work impossible.&quot;
*Marij Kogoj was a Slovenian composer with schizophrenia.
* Terry A. Davis (1969–2018) was an American computer programmer who singlehandedly created and designed an entire operating system, TempleOS, alongside full 2D and 3D graphics libraries, a programming language (HolyC) and a compiler. Although his remarks were often incomprehensible or abrasive, he was known to be exceptionally lucid if the topic of discussion was computers. He refused medication for his schizophrenia because he believed it limited his creativity. In 2017, the OS was shown as a part of an outsider art exhibition in Bourgogne, France.
* Kanye West (born 1977) is an American record producer, rapper, singer, fashion designer, Holocaust denier and antisemitic conspiracy theorist who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. West has said on his disorder, &quot;I can just tell you what I&#x27;m feeling at the time, and I feel a heightened connection with the universe when I&#x27;m ramping up. It is a health issue. This – it&#x27;s like a sprained brain, like having a sprained ankle. And if someone has a sprained ankle, you&#x27;re not going to push on him more. With us, once our brain gets to a point of spraining, people do everything to make it worse.&quot;

<doc id="862059" wikidata="Q845944" url="?curid=862059" title="The Dark Half">
<text>The Dark Half is a horror novel by American writer Stephen King, published in 1989. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; listed &quot;The Dark Half&quot; as the second-best-selling book of 1989 behind Tom Clancy&#x27;s &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;. The novel was adapted into a feature film of the same name in 1993.

Stephen King wrote several books under a pseudonym, Richard Bachman, during the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the Bachman novels were darker and more cynical in nature, featuring a far more visceral sense of horror than the psychological, gothic style common in many of King&#x27;s most famous works. When King was identified as Bachman, he wrote &quot;The Dark Half&quot; – about an author – in response to his outing.

The book&#x27;s central villain, George Stark, was named in honor of Richard Stark, the pen name of writer Donald E. Westlake under which he wrote some of his darkest, most violent books. King telephoned Westlake personally to ask permission. King&#x27;s own &quot;Richard Bachman&quot; pseudonym was also partly named for Stark: King had been reading a Richard Stark novel at the time he chose the pen name.

==Plot summary==

Thad Beaumont is an author and recovering alcoholic who lives in the town of Ludlow, Maine. Thad&#x27;s own books – cerebral literary fiction – are not very successful. Under the pen name &quot;George Stark&quot;, he writes highly successful crime novels about a psychopathic killer named Alexis Machine. When Thad&#x27;s authorship of Stark&#x27;s novels becomes public knowledge, Thad and his wife, Elizabeth, decide to stage a mock burial for his alter ego at the local cemetery, which is featured in a &quot;People&quot; magazine article. His epitaph reads: &quot;Not a Very Nice Guy.&quot;

Stark emerges from the mock grave as a physical entity, complete with the personality traits that Thad exhibited while writing as him, such as alcohol abuse and Pall Mall cigarette smoking. He then goes on a killing spree, gruesomely murdering everyone he perceives as responsible for his &quot;death&quot; – Thad&#x27;s editor, agent, and the &quot;People&quot; interviewer, among others. A cryptic message has also been found at some of the murder sites: &quot;The Sparrows Are Flying Again&quot;. Thad, meanwhile, is plagued by surreal nightmares. Stark&#x27;s murders are investigated by Alan Pangborn, the sheriff of the neighboring town of Castle Rock, who finds Thad&#x27;s voice and fingerprints at the crime scenes. This evidence, and Thad&#x27;s unwillingness to answer his questions, causes Pangborn to believe that Thad – despite having alibis – is responsible for the murders. Later, it is discovered that Stark has the same fingerprints as Thad, a clue to the twinship he and Thad share.

Thad eventually discovers that he and Stark share a mental bond, and begins to find notes from Stark written in his own handwriting. The notes tell Thad what activity Stark has been engaging in. Observing his son and daughter, Thad notes that twins share a unique bond. They can feel each other&#x27;s pain and at times appear to read the other&#x27;s mind. Using this as a key to his own situation, he begins to discover the even deeper meaning behind himself and Stark. He also realizes that the sounds of a flock of sparrows inside Thad&#x27;s head that he hears during headaches take on a new meaning in the form of &quot;psychopomps&quot;.

Pangborn eventually learns that Thad had an unborn twin brother who was absorbed into Thad &quot;in utero&quot; and later removed from his brain when he was a child. He had suffered from severe headaches and it was originally thought to be a tumor causing them. The neurosurgeon who removed it found the following inside: part of a nostril, some fingernails, some teeth, and a malformed human eye. This leads to questions about the true nature of Stark, whether he is a malevolent spirit with its own existence, or Thad himself, manifesting an alternate personality. Thad eventually destroys Stark in a showdown where he uses a bird call to bring forth a flock of sparrows that tear Stark&#x27;s body apart, but the book ends on an unhappy note. It is suggested by Alan Pangborn that Thad&#x27;s wife may be having serious doubts about the future of their relationship: she is appalled that Thad not only created Stark (if unintentionally), but that a part of him liked Stark.

==References==

In the novel &quot;Needful Things&quot;, Sheriff Alan Pangborn thinks about how Thad would get drunk and call him. He also recalls that Thad&#x27;s wife took the twins and left him. In &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;, the main character, author Mike Noonan, recalls how a Maine author named Thad Beaumont killed himself.

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted as a film, &quot;The Dark Half&quot;, by George A. Romero in 1990, and was released in 1993. It was filmed in part at Washington and Jefferson College and other locations in southwestern Pennsylvania. It starred Timothy Hutton as Thad/Stark, Michael Rooker as Alan Pangborn, and featured Julie Harris as an eccentric colleague of Thad&#x27;s who provides some vital information about the supernatural. An adventure video game adaptation was released for DOS in 1992. It was developed by Symtus and published by Capstone Software. In December 2019, it was announced that MGM would develop a film adaptation of the novel, with Alex Ross Perry set to write and direct.

In Bangladesh, the book was adopted as Trityo Noyon (The Third Eye) by Roksana Nazanin, published from Sheba Prokashoni.

<doc id="862061" wikidata="Q568944" url="?curid=862061" title="Wide Area Augmentation System">
<text>The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is an air navigation aid developed by the Federal Aviation Administration to augment the Global Positioning System (GPS), with the goal of improving its accuracy, integrity, and availability. Essentially, WAAS is intended to enable aircraft to rely on GPS for all phases of flight, including approaches with vertical guidance to any airport within its coverage area. It may be further enhanced with the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) also known by the preferred ICAO term Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS) in critical areas.

WAAS uses a network of ground-based reference stations, in North America and Hawaii, to measure small variations in the GPS satellites&#x27; signals in the western hemisphere. Measurements from the reference stations are routed to master stations, which queue the received Deviation Correction (DC) and send the correction messages to geostationary WAAS satellites in a timely manner (every 5 seconds or better). Those satellites broadcast the correction messages back to Earth, where WAAS-enabled GPS receivers use the corrections while computing their positions to improve accuracy.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) calls this type of system a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS). Europe and Asia are developing their own SBASs: the Indian GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation (GAGAN), the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), the Japanese Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS) and the Russian System for Differential Corrections and Monitoring (SDCM), respectively. Commercial systems include StarFire, OmniSTAR, and Atlas.

==WAAS objectives==
===Accuracy===

A primary goal of WAAS was to allow aircraft to make a Category I approach without any equipment being installed at the airport. This would allow new GPS-based instrument landing approaches to be developed for any airport, even ones without any ground equipment. A Category I approach requires an accuracy of laterally and vertically.

To meet this goal, the WAAS specification requires it to provide a position accuracy of or less (for both lateral and vertical measurements), at least 95% of the time. Actual performance measurements of the system at specific locations have shown it typically provides better than laterally and vertically throughout most of the contiguous United States and large parts of Canada and Alaska.

===Integrity===
Integrity of a navigation system includes the ability to provide timely warnings when its signal is providing misleading data that could potentially create hazards. The WAAS specification requires the system detect errors in the GPS or WAAS network and notify users within 6.2 seconds. Certifying that WAAS is safe for instrument flight rules (IFR) (i.e. flying in the clouds) requires proving there is only an extremely small probability that an error exceeding the requirements for accuracy will go undetected. Specifically, the probability is stated as 1×10−7, and is equivalent to no more than 3 seconds of bad data per year. This provides integrity information equivalent to or better than Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM).

===Availability===
Availability is the probability that a navigation system meets the accuracy and integrity requirements. Before the advent of WAAS, GPS specifications allowed for system unavailability for as much as a total time of four days per year (99% availability). The WAAS specification mandates availability as 99.999% (five nines) throughout the service area, equivalent to a downtime of just over 5 minutes per year.

==Operation==

WAAS is composed of three main segments: the ground segment, space segment, and user segment.

===Ground segment===
The ground segment is composed of multiple Wide-area Reference Stations (WRS). These precisely surveyed ground stations monitor and collect information on the GPS signals, then send their data to three Wide-area Master Stations (WMS) using a terrestrial communications network. The reference stations also monitor signals from WAAS geostationary satellites, providing integrity information regarding them as well. As of October 2007 there were 38 WRSs: twenty in the contiguous United States (CONUS), seven in Alaska, one in Hawaii, one in Puerto Rico, five in Mexico, and four in Canada.

Using the data from the WRS sites, the WMSs generate two different sets of corrections: fast and slow. The fast corrections are for errors which are changing rapidly and primarily concern the GPS satellites&#x27; instantaneous positions and clock errors. These corrections are considered user position-independent, which means they can be applied instantly by any receiver inside the WAAS broadcast footprint. The slow corrections include long-term ephemeric and clock error estimates, as well as ionospheric delay information. WAAS supplies delay corrections for a number of points (organized in a grid pattern) across the WAAS service area (see User Segment, below, to understand how these corrections are used).

Once these correction messages are generated, the WMSs send them to two pairs of Ground Uplink Stations (GUS), which then transmit to satellites in the Space segment for rebroadcast to the User segment.

====Reference stations====
Each FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center in the 50 states has a WAAS reference station, except for Indianapolis. There are also stations positioned in Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. See List of WAAS reference stations for the coordinates of the individual receiving antennas.

===Space segment===
The space segment consists of multiple communication satellites which broadcast the correction messages generated by the WAAS Master Stations for reception by the user segment. The satellites also broadcast the same type of range information as normal GPS satellites, effectively increasing the number of satellites available for a position fix. The space segment currently consists of three commercial satellites: &quot;Eutelsat 117 West B&quot;, &quot;SES-15&quot;, and &quot;Galaxy 30&quot;.

==== Satellite History ====
The original two WAAS satellites, named &quot;Pacific Ocean Region&quot; (POR) and &quot;Atlantic Ocean Region-West&quot; (AOR-W), were leased space on Inmarsat III satellites. These satellites ceased WAAS transmissions on July 31, 2007. With the end of the Inmarsat lease approaching, two new satellites (Galaxy 15 and Anik F1R) were launched in late 2005. Galaxy 15 is a PanAmSat and Anik F1R is a Telesat. As with the previous satellites, these are leased services under the FAA&#x27;s Geostationary Satellite Communications Control Segment contract with Lockheed Martin for WAAS geostationary satellite leased services, who were contracted to provide up to three satellites through the year 2016.

A third satellite was later added to the system. From March to November 2010, the FAA broadcast a WAAS test signal on a leased transponder on the Inmarsat-4 F3 satellite. The test signal was not usable for navigation, but could be received and was reported with the identification numbers PRN 133 (NMEA #46). In November 2010, the signal was certified as operational and made available for navigation. Following in orbit testing, Eutelsat 117 West B, broadcasting signal on PRN 131 (NMEA #44), was certified as operational and made available for navigation on March 27, 2018. The SES 15 satellite was launched on May 18, 2017, and following an in-orbit test of several months, was set operational on July 15, 2019. In 2018, a contract was awarded to place a WAAS L-band payload on the Galaxy 30 satellite. The satellite was successfully launched on August 15, 2020, and the WAAS transmissions were set operational on April 26, 2022, re-using PRN 135 (NMEA #48). After approximately three weeks with four active WAAS satellites, operational WAAS transmissions on Anik F1-R were ended on May 17, 2022.
In the table above, PRN is the satellite&#x27;s actual Pseudo-Random Number code. NMEA is the satellite number sent by some receivers when outputting satellite information (NMEA = PRN - 87).

===User segment===
The user segment is the GPS and WAAS receiver, which uses the information broadcast from each GPS satellite to determine its location and the current time, and receives the WAAS corrections from the Space segment. The two types of correction messages received (fast and slow) are used in different ways.

The GPS receiver can immediately apply the fast type of correction data, which includes the corrected satellite position and clock data, and determines its current location using normal GPS calculations. Once an approximate position fix is obtained the receiver begins to use the slow corrections to improve its accuracy. Among the slow correction data is the ionospheric delay. As the GPS signal travels from the satellite to the receiver, it passes through the ionosphere. The receiver calculates the location where the signal pierced the ionosphere and, if it has received an ionospheric delay value for that location, corrects for the error the ionosphere created.

While the slow data can be updated every minute if necessary, ephemeris errors and ionosphere errors do not change this frequently, so they are only updated every two minutes and are considered valid for up to six minutes.

==History and development==

The WAAS was jointly developed by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as part of the Federal Radionavigation Program (DOT-VNTSC-RSPA-95-1/DOD-4650.5), beginning in 1994, to provide performance comparable to category 1 instrument landing system (ILS) for all aircraft possessing the appropriately certified equipment. Without WAAS, ionospheric disturbances, clock drift, and satellite orbit errors create too much error and uncertainty in the GPS signal to meet the requirements for a precision approach (see GPS sources of error). A precision approach includes altitude information and provides course guidance, distance from the runway, and elevation information at all points along the approach, usually down to lower altitudes and weather minimums than non-precision approaches.

Prior to the WAAS, the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) did not have the ability to provide lateral and vertical navigation for precision approaches for all users at all locations. The traditional system for precision approaches is the instrument landing system (ILS), which used a series of radio transmitters each broadcasting a single signal to the aircraft. This complex series of radios needs to be installed at every runway end, some offsite, along a line extended from the runway centerline, making the implementation of a precision approach both difficult and very expensive. The ILS system is composed of 180 different transmitting antennas at each point built. 

For some time the FAA and NASA developed a much improved system, the microwave landing system (MLS). The entire MLS system for a particular approach was isolated in one or two boxes located beside the runway, dramatically reducing the cost of implementation. MLS also offered a number of practical advantages that eased traffic considerations, both for aircraft and radio channels. Unfortunately, MLS would also require every airport and aircraft to upgrade their equipment.

During the development of MLS, consumer GPS receivers of various quality started appearing. GPS offered a huge number of advantages to the pilot, combining all of an aircraft&#x27;s long-distance navigation systems into a single easy-to-use system, often small enough to be hand held. Deploying an aircraft navigation system based on GPS was largely a problem of developing new techniques and standards, as opposed to new equipment. The FAA started planning to shut down their existing long-distance systems (VOR and NDBs) in favor of GPS. This left the problem of approaches, however. GPS is simply not accurate enough to replace ILS systems. Typical accuracy is about , whereas even a &quot;CAT I&quot; approach, the least demanding, requires a vertical accuracy of .

This inaccuracy in GPS is mostly due to large &quot;billows&quot; in the ionosphere, which slow the radio signal from the satellites by a random amount. Since GPS relies on timing the signals to measure distances, this slowing of the signal makes the satellite appear farther away. The billows move slowly, and can be characterized using a variety of methods from the ground, or by examining the GPS signals themselves. By broadcasting this information to GPS receivers every minute or so, this source of error can be significantly reduced.

This led to the concept of Differential GPS, which used separate radio systems to broadcast the correction signal to receivers. Aircraft could then install a receiver which would be plugged into the GPS unit, the signal being broadcast on a variety of frequencies for different users (FM radio for cars, longwave for ships, etc.). Broadcasters of the required power generally cluster around larger cities, making such DGPS systems less useful for wide-area navigation. Additionally, most radio signals are either line-of-sight, or can be distorted by the ground, which made DGPS difficult to use as a precision approach system or when flying low for other reasons.

The FAA considered systems that could allow the same correction signals to be broadcast over a much wider area, such as from a satellite, leading directly to WAAS. Since a GPS unit already consists of a satellite receiver, it made much more sense to send out the correction signals on the same frequencies used by GPS units, than to use an entirely separate system and thereby double the probability of failure. In addition to lowering implementation costs by &quot;piggybacking&quot; on a planned satellite launch, this also allowed the signal to be broadcast from geostationary orbit, which meant a small number of satellites could cover all of North America.

On July 10, 2003, the WAAS signal was activated for general aviation, covering 95% of the United States, and portions of Alaska offering minimums.

On January 17, 2008, Alabama-based Hickok &amp; Associates became the first designer of helicopter WAAS with Localizer Performance (LP) and Localizer Performance with Vertical guidance (LPV) approaches, and the only entity with FAA-approved criteria (which even FAA has yet to develop). This helicopter WAAS criteria offers as low as 250 foot minimums and decreased visibility requirements to enable missions previously not possible. On April 1, 2009, FAA AFS-400 approved the first three helicopter WAAS GPS approach procedures for Hickok &amp; Associates&#x27; customer California Shock/Trauma Air Rescue (CALSTAR). Since then they have designed many approved WAAS helicopter approaches for various EMS hospitals and air providers, within the United States as well as in other countries and continents.

On December 30, 2009, Seattle-based Horizon Air flew the first scheduled-passenger service flight using WAAS with LPV on flight 2014, a Portland to Seattle flight operated by a Bombardier Q400 with a WAAS FMS from Universal Avionics. The airline, in partnership with the FAA, will outfit seven Q400-aircraft with WAAS and share flight data to better determine the suitability of WAAS in scheduled air service applications.

==Comparison of accuracy==
==Benefits==

WAAS addresses all of the &quot;navigation problem&quot;, providing highly accurate positioning that is extremely easy to use, for the cost of a single receiver installed on the aircraft. Ground- and space-based infrastructure is relatively limited, and no on-airport system is needed. WAAS allows a precision approach to be published for any airport, for the cost of developing the procedures and publishing the new approach plates. This means that almost any airport can have a precision approach and the cost of implementation is drastically reduced.

Additionally WAAS works just as well between airports. This allows the aircraft to fly directly from one airport to another, as opposed to following routes based on ground-based signals. This can cut route distances considerably in some cases, saving both time and fuel. In addition, because of its ability to provide information on the accuracy of each GPS satellite&#x27;s information, aircraft equipped with WAAS are permitted to fly at lower en-route altitudes than was possible with ground-based systems, which were often blocked by terrain of varying elevation. This enables pilots to safely fly at lower altitudes, not having to rely on ground-based systems. For unpressurized aircraft, this conserves oxygen and enhances safety.

The above benefits create not only convenience, but also have the potential to generate significant cost savings. The cost to provide the WAAS signal, serving all 5,400 public use airports, is just under US$50 million per year. In comparison, the current ground based systems such as the Instrument Landing System (ILS), installed at only 600 airports, cost US$82 million in annual maintenance. Without ground navigation hardware to purchase, the total cost of publishing a runway&#x27;s WAAS approach is approximately US$50,000; compared to the $1,000,000 to $1,500,000 cost to install an ILS radio system.

==Drawbacks and limitations==
For all its benefits, WAAS is not without drawbacks and critical limitations:

* Space weather. All man-made satellite systems are subject to space weather and space debris threats. For example, a solar super-storm event composed of an extremely large and fast earthbound Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) could disable the geosynchronous or GPS satellite elements of WAAS.
* The broadcasting satellites are geostationary, which causes them to be less than 10° above the horizon for locations north of 71.4° latitude. This means aircraft in areas of Alaska or northern Canada may have difficulty maintaining a lock on the WAAS signal.
* To calculate an ionospheric grid point&#x27;s delay, that point must be located between a satellite and a reference station. The low number of satellites and ground stations limit the number of points which can be calculated.
* Aircraft conducting WAAS approaches use certified GPS receivers, which are much more expensive than non-certified units. In 2024, Garmin&#x27;s least expensive certified receiver, the GPS 175, had a suggested retail price of US$5,895.
* WAAS is not capable of the accuracies required for Category II or III ILS approaches. Thus, WAAS is not a sole-solution and either existing ILS equipment must be maintained or it must be replaced by new systems, such as the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS).
* WAAS Localizer Performance with Vertical guidance (LPV) approaches with 200-foot minimums (LPV-200) will not be published for airports without medium intensity lighting, precision runway markings and a parallel taxiway. Smaller airports, which currently may not have these features, would have to upgrade their facilities or require pilots to use higher minimums.
* As precision increases and error approaches zero, the navigation paradox states that there is an increased collision risk, as the likelihood of two craft occupying the same space on the shortest distance line between two navigational points has increased.

==Future of WAAS==

===Improvement to aviation operations===
In 2007, WAAS vertical guidance was projected to be available nearly all the time (greater than 99%), and its coverage encompasses the full continental U.S., most of Alaska, northern Mexico, and southern Canada. At that time, the accuracy of WAAS would meet or exceed the requirements for Category 1 ILS approaches, namely, three-dimensional position information down to 200 feet (60 m) above touchdown zone elevation.

===Software improvements===
Software improvements, to be implemented by September 2008, significantly improve signal availability of vertical guidance throughout the CONUS and Alaska. Area covered by the 95% available LPV solution in Alaska improves from 62% to 86%. And in the CONUS, the 100% availability LPV-200 coverage rises from 48% to 84%, with 100% coverage of the LPV solution.

===Space segment upgrades===
Both Galaxy XV (PRN #135) and Anik F1R (PRN #138) contain an L1 &amp; L5 GPS payload. This means they will potentially be usable with the L5 modernized GPS signals when the new signals and receivers become available. With L5, avionics will be able to use a combination of signals to provide the most accurate service possible, thereby increasing availability of the service. These avionics systems will use ionospheric corrections broadcast by WAAS, or self-generated onboard dual frequency corrections, depending on which one is more accurate.

<text>The United States District Court for the Central District of California (in case citations, C.D. Cal.; commonly referred to as the CDCA or CACD) is a federal trial court that serves over 19 million people in Southern and Central California, making it the most populous federal judicial district. The district was created on September 18, 1966. Cases from the Central District are appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the United States government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit). Along with the Central District of Illinois, the court is the only district court referred to by the name &quot;Central&quot; – all other courts with similar geographical names instead use the term &quot;Middle.&quot;

== History ==

California was admitted to the union on September 9, 1850, and was divided into two federal trial court districts – Northern and Southern – by Act of Congress on September 28, 1850, 9 Stat. 521. The boundary was at the 37th parallel. The two districts were merged as the United States District Court for the District of California on July 27, 1866, by 14 Stat. 300. On August 5, 1886, Congress re-created the Southern District by 24 Stat. 308, while the northern half was renamed Northern District. The Eastern and Central Districts of California were created on March 18, 1966 from portions of the Northern and Southern Districts by 80 Stat. 75.

== Divisions ==

The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California is divided into three divisions, with jurisdiction over seven counties: Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura.

The Eastern Division covers Riverside and San Bernardino Counties at the Riverside courthouse.

The Southern Division covers Orange County from the Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse in Santa Ana.

The Western Division covers Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties. Cases are heard in two courthouses in downtown Los Angeles. All but two district judges are located in the new First Street Courthouse, whereas magistrate judges and two district judges maintain chambers in the Edward R. Roybal Courthouse.

== United States attorney for the Central District of California ==

The United States attorney for the Central District of California represents the United States government in civil and criminal cases before the court. , the United States attorney is E. Martin Estrada.

<text>The Audibert &amp; Lavirotte was a French automobile, manufactured in Lyon from 1894 to 1901.
The company, the oldest maker of automobiles in the city, was set up by Maurice Audibert and Emile Lavirotte built cars that were generally similar to the Benz. These were up to 6 horsepower, and featured belt drive and rear-mounted engines. In 1900, the company built three 36 hp racers, which were entered in the Nice-Salon-Nice race on 25 March 1901. They were the heaviest vehicles in the race, weighing over 1600 kilograms each. They manufactured a so-called &quot;Berline de Voyage&quot;, which may have been the first saloon car as early as 1898. The company ceased production in November 1901, after financiers did not pay and the factory was forced to shut down.
The plant was taken over by Marius Berliet in 1902. Lavirotte helped finance this action and was employed by the Berliet company until his retirement in 1927. Audibert went to Rochet-Schneider. He died in 1931.

<text>The Aultman was a 1901 American automobile manufactured in Canton, Ohio; the light steam carriage, whose makers also built a four-wheel-drive steam truck, was built for only a few years.

==History==

By 1904, the Aultman &quot;Road Locomotive&quot; was advertised nationally in &quot;Dun&#x27;s Review&quot; and was described as &quot;specially designed for heavy hauling at mines, lumber camps, smelters, quarries, etc., and for contractors, road and irrigation work.&quot; It was also noted that it was suitable for freight lines from towns &quot;off the railroads.&quot;

<text>The following are former United States district courts, which ceased to exist because they were subdivided into smaller units. With the exception of California, each of these courts initially covered an entire U.S. state, and was subdivided as the jurisdictions which they covered increased in population. Two of the district courts—those of South Carolina and New Jersey—were subdivided but later recreated. Every change to the divisions and boundaries of these courts is effected by an act of the United States Congress, and for each such action, the statutory reference is identified.
==Alabama==

The United States District Court for the District of Alabama was created on April 21, 1820, by . It was subdivided into Northern and Southern Districts on March 10, 1824, by . The Middle District was subsequently formed from parts of these two districts on February 6, 1839, by , with legislation specifying that the Middle District Court was to be held at Tuscaloosa, the Northern District Court at Huntsville, and the Southern District Court at Mobile. The Districts were reorganized on August 7, 1848. Only one judge was ever appointed to the District of Alabama.




==Arkansas==

Arkansas, originally part of the Louisiana Purchase, became part of the Missouri Territory in 1812, when Louisiana became a state. When Missouri became a state in 1819, a territorial government, including a territorial court, was organized for Arkansas, taking effect on July 4, 1819. The United States District Court for the District of Arkansas was established with a single judge when Arkansas became a state, on June 15, 1836, by , 51. The court was subdivided into Eastern and the Western Districts on March 3, 1851, by .






==California==

The United States District Court for the District of California existed from 1866 to 1886. California was admitted as a state on September 9, 1850, and was initially divided into two districts, the Northern and the Southern, by Act of Congress approved September 28 . The boundary line was at the 37th parallel north. The creating act provided that:

:In addition to the ordinary jurisdiction and powers of a District Court of the United States, with which the Southern District Court of New York has been invested, the said Courts be and hereby are invested respectively within the limits of its district with the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction and power in all civil cases now exercised by the Circuit Courts of the United States; and that in all cases where said Courts shall exercise such jurisdiction, appeals may be taken from the judgments, orders or decrees of said Courts to the Supreme Court of the United States.

On February 27, 1851, President Millard Fillmore appointed Ogden Hoffman Jr., as the judge presiding over the Northern District. The Act of August 31, 1852, made the Judge of the Northern District be Judge of the Southern District as well until otherwise provided, by , 84, effectively creating a single District in all but name until an Act of January 18, 1854 provided for the appointment of a Judge for the Southern District. The Southern District of California was abolished and the State made to constitute one district by Act of Congress approved July 27, 1866, .

Twenty years later, on August 5, 1886, Congress re-created the Southern District of California (and, by extension, the Northern District) by . Hoffman, who had continued serving as the sole district judge, again became judge of the Northern district only, there continuing in service for five more years. Erskine Mayo Ross was appointed Judge of the new Southern District and served until his promotion to the Circuit Judgeship, when he was succeeded by Olin Wellborn.

On March 18, 1966, the Eastern and Central Districts were created from portions of the Northern and Southern Districts by .




==Florida==

On the same day that Florida was admitted as a state, March 3, 1845, Congress enacted legislation creating the United States District Court for the District of Florida, . On February 23, 1847, divided the jurisdiction of this court between the Northern District and a Southern District Courts with the boundary between as:

:[T]hat part of the State of Florida lying south of a line drawn due east and west from the northern point of Charlotte Harbor, including the islands, keys, reefs, shoals, harbors, bays and inlets, south of said line, shall be erected into a new judicial district, to be called the Southern District of Florida; a District Court shall be held in said Southern District, to consist of one judge, who shall reside at Key West, in said district...

The same statute directed the Northern District to hold court at Apalachicola, Florida, and Pensacola, Florida.

On July 30, 1962, the Middle District was created from portions of the other districts by .




==Georgia==

The United States District Court for the District of Georgia was one of the original 13 courts established by the Judiciary Act of 1789, , on September 24, 1789. The District was subdivided into Northern and Southern Districts on August 11, 1848, by . The Middle District was formed from portions of those two Districts on May 28, 1926, by .








==Illinois==

The United States District Court for the District of Illinois was established by a statute passed by the United States Congress on March 3, 1819, . The act established a single office for a judge to preside over the court. Initially, the court was not within any existing judicial circuit, and appeals from the court were taken directly to the United States Supreme Court. In 1837, Congress created the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, placing it in Chicago, Illinois and giving it jurisdiction over the District of Illinois, . The District itself was eliminated by a statute passed on February 13, 1855, , under which it was subdivided into the Northern and the Southern Districts. The boundaries of the District and the seats of the courts were set forth in the statute:

:The counties of Hancock, McDonough, Peoria, Woodford, Livingston, and Iroquois, and all the counties in the said State north of them, shall compose one district, to be called the northern district of Illinois, and courts shall be held for the said district at the city of Chicago; and the residue of the counties of the said State shall compose another district, to be called the southern district of Illinois, and courts shall be held for the same at the city of Springfield.

The district has since been re-organized several times. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois was created on March 3, 1905, by , by splitting counties out of the Northern and Southern Districts. It was later eliminated in a reorganization on October 2, 1978, which replaced it with a Central District, , also formed from parts of the Northern and Southern Districts.






==Indiana==

The United States District Court for the District of Indiana was established on March 3, 1817, by . The District was subdivided into Northern and Southern Districts on April 21, 1928, by . Of all district courts that have been subdivided, Indiana existed for the longest time as a single court, 111 years.















==Iowa==

The United States District Court for the District of Iowa was established on March 3, 1845, by . The District was subdivided into Northern and Southern Districts on July 20, 1882, by .






==Kentucky==

The United States District Court for the District of Kentucky was part of one of the original 13 courts established by the Judiciary Act of 1789, , on September 24, 1789. At the time, Kentucky was not yet a state, but was within the territory of the state of Virginia. The District was unchanged when Kentucky became a state on June 1, 1792. On February 13, 1801, the Judiciary Act of 1801, , abolished the U.S. district court in Kentucky, but the repeal of this Act restored the District on March 8, 1802, . The District was subdivided into Eastern and Western Districts on February 12, 1901, by .










==Louisiana==

On March 26, 1804, Congress organized the Territory of Orleans and created the United States District Court for the District of Orleans – the first time Congress provided a territory with a district court equal in its authority and jurisdiction to those of the states. The United States District Court for the District of Louisiana was established on April 8, 1812, by , several weeks before Louisiana was formally admitted as a state of the union. The District was thereafter subdivided and reformed several times. It was first subdivided into Eastern and Western Districts on March 3, 1823, by .

On February 13, 1845, Louisiana was reorganized into a single District with one judgeship, by , but was again divided into Eastern and the Western Districts on March 3, 1849, by . Congress again abolished the Western District of Louisiana and reorganized Louisiana as a single judicial district on July 27, 1866, by . On March 3, 1881, by , Louisiana was for a third time divided into Eastern and the Western Districts, with one judgeship authorized for each. The Middle District was formed from portions of those two Districts on December 18, 1971, by .

During the course of its frequent subdivisions and reunifications, four judges served as judge of the District of Louisiana: Dominic Augustin Hall, (1812–1820), John Dick, (1821–1823), Theodore Howard McCaleb (1845–1849), and Edward Henry Durell (1866–1874). Hall was appointed to the District of Louisiana twice. He briefly resigned from the District Court to serve as a Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court. He was shortly thereafter reappointed to the same seat on the District Court, which had remained vacant in his absence.









==Michigan==

The United States District Court for the District of Michigan was established on July 1, 1836, by , with a single judgeship. The district court was not assigned to a judicial circuit, but was granted the same jurisdiction as United States circuit courts, except in appeals and writs of error, which were the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Due to the so-called &quot;Toledo War&quot;, a boundary dispute with Ohio, Michigan did not become a state of the Union until January 26, 1837. On March 3, 1837, Congress passed an act that repealed the circuit court jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the District of Michigan, assigned the District of Michigan to the Seventh Circuit, and established a U.S. circuit court for the district, .

On July 15, 1862, Congress reorganized the circuits and assigned Michigan to the Eighth Circuit by , and on January 28, 1863, the Congress again reorganized the Seventh and Eight Circuits and assigned Michigan to the Seventh Circuit, by . On February 24, 1863, Congress divided the District of Michigan into the Eastern and the Western Districts, with one judgeship authorized for each district, by .

Ross Wilkins was the only district judge to serve the District of Michigan. He was nominated by President Andrew Jackson on July 2, 1836, to the newly created seat, and was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 2, 1836. He received his commission on January 26, 1837. Upon termination of the District of Michigan, Wilkins was reassigned to the Eastern District of Michigan.






==Mississippi==

The United States District Court for the District of Mississippi was established on April 3, 1818, by . It existed for over twenty years, and was subdivided into Northern and Southern Districts on June 18, 1838, by :

:The State of Mississippi, at the date of the act of March 3, 1837... constituted one district, in which the District Court was invested with the powers of a Circuit Court. By that act the extraordinary jurisdiction of the District Court was abrogated. But by the acts of June 18, 1838, and of February 16, 1839, the district of Mississippi was divided into two districts, the Northern and Southern; and by the latter act the powers of a Circuit Court were conferred on the District Court for the Northern District.







==Missouri==

The United States District Court for the District of Missouri was established on March 16, 1822, by . However, an act of Congress passed in 1845 and upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 1851, extending federal admiralty jurisdiction to inland waterways, resulted in a substantial increase in the number of admiralty cases arising from traffic on the Mississippi River. These disputes involved &quot;contracts of affreightment, collisions, mariners&#x27; wages, and other causes of admiralty jurisdiction&quot;, and litigants of matters arising in the port city of St. Louis found it inconvenient to travel far inland to Jefferson City for their cases to be tried. The District was therefore subdivided into Eastern and Western Districts on March 3, 1857, by .






==New Jersey==

The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey was one of the original 13 courts established by the Judiciary Act of 1789, , on September 24, 1789. The District was subdivided into the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New Jersey and the United States District Court for the Western District of New Jersey on February 13, 1801, by the Judiciary Act of 1801, , with the judicial districts being headquartered in New Brunswick and Burlington, respectively. The repeal of the 1801 Act on March 8, 1802, by , restored New Jersey as a single judicial district. The only judge to serve on the briefly subdivided courts was Robert Morris, who had begun serving as a recess appointment to the District of New Jersey on August 28, 1790 and continued serving after the restoration of the single court, until June 2, 1815.




==New York==

The United States District Court for the District of New York was one of the original 13 courts established by the Judiciary Act of 1789, , on September 24, 1789. It existed for nearly twenty-five years before, on April 9, 1814, New York was divided into Northern and Southern Districts by . These Districts were later further subdivided with the creation of Eastern District on February 25, 1865 by , and the Western District on May 12, 1900, by .











==North Carolina==

The United States District Court for the District of North Carolina has a unique history among defunct district courts. It was established on June 4, 1790, by . On June 9, 1794 it was subdivided into three districts by , but on March 3, 1797, the three districts were abolished and the single District restored by , until April 29, 1802, when the state was again subdivided into three different districts by .

In both instances, these districts, unlike those with geographic designations that existed in other states, were titled by the names of the cities in which the courts sat. After the first division, they were styled the District of Edenton, the District of New Bern, and the District of Wilmington; after the second division, they were styled the District of Albemarle, the District of Cape Fear, and the District of Pamptico. However, in both instances, only one judge was authorized to serve all three districts, causing them to effectively operate as a single district. The latter combination was occasionally referred to by the cumbersome title of the United States District Court for the Albemarle, Cape Fear &amp; Pamptico Districts of North Carolina. Judge Henry Potter&#x27;s 55 years of service on this court during the period in which the state contained a single district, from April 1802 to December 1857, represents one of the longest terms ever held by a United States federal judge.

On June 4, 1872, North Carolina was re-divided into two Districts, Eastern and Western, by . The Middle District was created from portions of the Eastern and Western Districts on March 2, 1927, by .








==Ohio==

The United States District Court for the District of Ohio was established on February 19, 1803, by . The District was subdivided into Northern and Southern Districts on February 10, 1855, by .








==Pennsylvania==

The United States District Court for the District of Pennsylvania was one of the original 13 courts established by the Judiciary Act of 1789, , on September 24, 1789. It was subdivided on April 20, 1818, by , into the Eastern and Western Districts, to be headquartered in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, respectively. Portions of these districts were subsequently subdivided into the Middle District on March 2, 1901, by .






==South Carolina==
The United States District Court for the District of South Carolina was one of the original 13 courts established by the Judiciary Act of 1789, , on September 24, 1789. It was subdivided into the United States District Court for the Eastern District of South Carolina and the United States District Court for the Western District of South Carolina Districts on February 21, 1823 by . The Eastern District was headquartered at Florence, and the Western District was headquartered in Greenville. The division was solely for the purposes of holding court – a single judge presided over both districts, and the act authorized no additional court staff.

In 1898 the United States Supreme Court held in &quot;Barrett v. United States&quot; that South Carolina legally constituted a single judicial district. Congress made a more explicit effort to subdivide the District on March 3, 1911, by , . South Carolina was again Eastern and the Western Districts, with one judgeship authorized to serve both districts, effective January 1, 1912. Congress finally authorized an additional judgeship for the Western District, and assigned the sitting judge exclusively to the Eastern District, on March 3, 1915, by . However, on October 7, 1965, by , South Carolina was reorganized as a single judicial district with four judgeships authorized for the district court, and it has since remained a single District.

==Tennessee==

The United States District Court for the District of Tennessee was established with one judgeship on January 31, 1797, by . The judgeship was filled by President George Washington&#x27;s appointment of John McNairy. Since Congress failed to assign the district to a circuit, the court had the jurisdiction of both a district court and a circuit court. Appeals from this one district court went directly to the United States Supreme Court.

On February 13, 1801, in the famous &quot;Midnight Judges&quot; Act of 1801, , Congress abolished the U.S. district court in Tennessee, and expanded the number of circuits to six, provided for independent circuit court judgeships, and abolished the necessity of Supreme Court Justices riding the circuits. It was this legislation which created the grandfather of the present Sixth Circuit. The act provided for a &quot;Sixth Circuit&quot; comprising two districts in the State of Tennessee, one district in the State of Kentucky and one district, called the Ohio District, composed of the Ohio and Indiana territories (the latter including the present State of Michigan). The new Sixth Circuit Court was to be held at &quot;Bairdstown&quot; in the District of Kentucky, at Knoxville in the District of East Tennessee, at Nashville in the District of West Tennessee, and at Cincinnati in the District of Ohio. Unlike the other circuits which were provided with three circuit judges, the Sixth Circuit was to have only one circuit judge with district judges from Kentucky and Tennessee comprising the rest of the court. Any two judges constituted a quorum. New circuit judgeships were to be created as district judgeships in Kentucky and Tennessee became vacant.

The repeal of this Act restored the District on March 8, 1802, . The District was divided into the Eastern and Western Districts on April 29, 1802. On February 24, 1807, Congress again abolished the two districts and created the United States Circuit for the District of Tennessee. On March 3, 1837, Congress assigned the judicial district of Tennessee to the Eighth Circuit. On June 18, 1839, by , Congress divided Tennessee into three districts, Eastern, Middle, and Western. Again, only one judgeship was allotted for all three districts. On July 15, 1862, Congress reassigned appellate jurisdiction to the Sixth Circuit. Finally, on June 14, 1878, Congress authorized a separate judgeship for each district of Tennessee.






==Texas==

The United States District Court for the District of Texas was established on December 29, 1845, by . and based in Galveston, then the largest city in the state. John Charles Watrous, appointed to the court by President James K. Polk in May 1846, was the only federal judge to sit for the district. The District was subdivided into Eastern and Western Districts on February 21, 1857, by . When the District was subdivided, Watrous continued as judge for the Eastern District only, while Thomas Howard DuVal was appointed to the Western District. Watrous continued serving in the Eastern District until 1870. From these Districts, Texas was further subdivided with the creation of a Northern District on February 24, 1879, by . The new Southern District was created on March 11, 1902, by .




==Virginia==

The United States District Court for the District of Virginia was one of the original 13 courts established by the Judiciary Act of 1789, , on September 24, 1789.

On February 13, 1801, the Judiciary Act of 1801, , divided Virginia into three judicial districts: the District of Virginia, which included the counties west of the Tidewater and south of the Rappahannock River; the District of Norfolk, which included the Tidewater counties south of the Rappahannock; and the District of Potomac, which included the counties north and east of the Rappahannock as well as Maryland counties along the Potomac. Just over a year later, on March 8, 1802, the Judiciary Act of 1801 was repealed and Virginia became a single District again, , effective July 1, 1802.

The District of Virginia was subdivided into Eastern and Western Districts on February 4, 1819, by . At that time, West Virginia was still part of Virginia, and was encompassed in Virginia&#x27;s Western District. With the division of West Virginia from Virginia during the American Civil War, the Western District of Virginia became the District of West Virginia, and those parts of the Western District that were not part of West Virginia were combined with the Eastern District to again form a single District of Virginia on June 11, 1864, by . Congress again divided Virginia into Eastern and the Western Districts on February 3, 1871, by .








==Washington==

The United States District Court for the District of Washington was established on April 5, 1890, by . The District was subdivided into Eastern and Western Districts on March 2, 1905, by . Only one judge was ever appointed to the District of Washington.






==West Virginia==

West Virginia split from the state of Virginia during the American Civil War. At that time, Virginia was already divided into an Eastern and Western District. Congress reorganized the Western District of Virginia to conform to the boundaries of the new state of West Virginia, renaming it the United States District Court for the District of West Virginia on June 11, 1864, by . This District was subdivided into Northern and Southern Districts on January 22, 1901, by .

John Jay Jackson Jr., who had been appointed by Abraham Lincoln to what was then the Western District of Virginia, became the first judge of the District of West Virginia. He remained the only judge on that court until its subdivision.




==Wisconsin==

The United States District Court for the District of Wisconsin was established on May 29, 1848, by . It was subdivided into Eastern and Western Districts on June 30, 1870, by . Only one judge was ever appointed to the District of Wisconsin.

<text>William Robson (October 3, 1864 – ) was a Manitoba politician and the leader of the province&#x27;s Independent-Farmers party in 1921 and 1922.

==Life==
Born in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England, Robson arrived in Canada with his parents at the age of two. He worked as a farmer and was a shareholder in the Grain Grower&#x27;s Guide, a popular farmer&#x27;s newspaper in Canada. Robson also served as both a councillor and reeve during the 1910s.

In 1920, Robson was one of 12 &quot;farmer&#x27;s candidates&quot; elected to the Manitoba legislature. He defeated future Liberal leader James Breakey in Glenwood by four votes. Robson was subsequently chosen as the leader of the Independent-Farmers, the name adopted by the victorious candidates for their parliamentary caucus.

The Independent-Farmers were a diverse group and did not continue beyond the dissolution of the legislature in 1922. Afterward, the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM) represented the province&#x27;s farming community in a more organized manner.

Robson did not run for re-election in 1922 and did not serve in the government of UFM Premier John Bracken.

<text>Aurea, Societa Italiana Ferrotaie (Turin 1920-1922), Fabbrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (Turin 1922-1933). Aurea was an Italian automobile manufactured in Turin from 1921 to 1930.

==History==
Aurea built sidevalve and overhead valve four-cylinder cars with engines that started at 1460 cc in the S.V. version engine, but later were increased to 1479 cc in both S.V. and O.H.V. engine configurations. Only the &quot;S&quot; type MONZA factory racing version contained the overhead valve engine type engine. The cars were well-made, but fairly heavy. Regular production of Aureas stopped around 1926, but the company produced a few more cars from existing parts and maintained parts supply under for the vehicles under Ceirano&#x27;s new ownership and management from late 1926 onwards. After the last Aurea vehicle assembly, the same factory was used to manufacture Ceirano commercial vehicles, particularly trucks.

<text>WSM (650 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station, located in Nashville, Tennessee. It broadcasts a country music format (with classic country and Americana leanings, the latter of which is branded as &quot;Route 650&quot;) and is known as the home of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, the world&#x27;s longest running radio program. The station is owned Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. After nearly 40 years broadcasting from a studio within the Gaylord Opryland Resort &amp; Convention Center, WSM moved to a showcase studio inside the former home of Roy Acuff, just outside the Grand Ole Opry House, in July 2024.

Nicknamed &quot;The Air Castle of the South&quot;, the station broadcasts with 50,000 watts around the clock from a facility in Brentwood, Tennessee. It has one of the largest daytime coverage areas in the country, providing at least grade B coverage as far southeast as Chattanooga, as far northwest as Evansville, Indiana, as far west as Jackson, Tennessee and as far south as Huntsville, Alabama. At night, WSM&#x27;s clear channel signal reaches much of North America and nearby countries.

WSM reaches a worldwide audience via its Internet simulcast. It is the National Primary Entry Point (PEP) for the Emergency Alert System (EAS) in Middle Tennessee and the southwestern portion of Indiana.

==Programming==
WSM is one of two clear-channel stations in North America, along with CFZM in Toronto, that still primarily broadcast secular music. (CKDO, in Ontario, is authorized as a clear channel but operates at a fifth of the broadcast power of WSM and CFZM, and operates directionally such that it is inaudible in the United States).

Bill Cody has been the host of the morning show, &quot;Coffee, Country and Cody&quot; since 1998, and has been in radio since 1975. Since its establishment on January 1, 2020, the country music oriented TV network Circle simulcast &quot;Coffee, Country, and Cody&quot;, following a period of several years where the Heartland network. Cody&#x27;s &quot;Pure American Country&quot; syndicated show is flagshipped at WSM. Larry Gatlin, lead singer of the Gatlin Brothers, hosts an hourlong gospel program on the weekends as of 2016. Tracy Lawrence&#x27;s syndicated program &quot;Honky Tonkin″&quot; has been flagshipped at WSM since 2015. Dailey &amp; Vincent host a monthly radio show on the station. Chris Scruggs, grandson of Earl Scruggs, hosts a weekly show &quot;Friends and Neighbors&quot; with his house band, the Stone Fox Five, after most Friday Night Opry episodes. Mandy Barnett hosts a &quot;Nashville Songbook&quot; series for one hour each Monday evening. Charlie Worsham hosts the &quot;Air Castle Community Hour&quot;, mainly featuring artists in the Nashville music scene. Jason Coleman hosts a Sunday night piano music show in honor of his grandfather, longtime Nashville keyboardist Floyd Cramer.

The &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; fills several nights of the station&#x27;s evening schedule. Following the &quot;Opry&quot; on most Saturday nights is the &quot;Midnite Jamboree&quot;, an aftershow that was originally founded by Ernest Tubb in 1947 and continues to be sponsored by Tubb&#x27;s eponymous record shop. Following the &quot;Jamboree&quot; is the regionally syndicated &quot;Sutton Ole Time Music Hour&quot;.

Syndicated programming on WSM as of 2024 includes reruns of Bob Kingsley-era &quot;American Country Countdown&quot;, &quot;Into the Blue&quot;, &quot;The Crook &amp; Chase Countdown&quot; and &quot;Y&#x27;all Access with Kelly Sutton&quot;.

In 2017, WSM launched &quot;Route 650&quot;, a full-time Americana music streaming station available via its website, mobile app and services like TuneIn.

In 2018, WSM launched &quot;Opry Nashville Radio&quot;, a full-time streaming station billed as being &quot;based on the Grand Ole Opry and Nashville lifestyle&quot; and focusing mainly on contemporary country music. During December, this channel flips to all Christmas music.

As recently as 2020, the station was live and locally operated during the overnight hours, but the overnight host position was eliminated in February 2020.

==History==
 Founded by the National Life and Accident Insurance Company as a platform to sell the company&#x27;s insurance products, WSM first signed on October 5, 1925. The call letters were derived from the company&#x27;s motto, &quot;We Shield Millions&quot;. Studios were first located in the company&#x27;s building on Seventh Avenue and Union Street in downtown Nashville; this was the original home of the &quot;Opry,&quot; until 1934.

WSM is associated with the popularization of country music through its weekly Saturday night program, the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, the longest-running radio program in history. The &quot;Opry&quot; began as the &quot;WSM Barn Dance&quot; on November 28, 1925, with Uncle Jimmy Thompson as the first performer. George D. Hay, a newspaper reporter from Memphis, was WSM&#x27;s first program director. On December 10, 1927, Hay is quoted as saying &quot;For the past hour we have been listening to music largely from Grand Opera, but from now on we will present &#x27;The Grand Ole Opry&#x27;&quot;, contrasting the preceding program on the NBC Red Network with WSM&#x27;s local broadcast.

The station traditionally played country music in the nighttime hours, when listeners from around the United States would tune in. During daytime hours, the station broadcast long-form radio, including both local and NBC network programs, in addition to music. WSM is credited with helping shape Nashville into a recording industry capital. Because of WSM&#x27;s wide reach, musical acts from all across the eastern United States came to Nashville in the early decades of the station&#x27;s existence, in hopes of getting to perform on WSM. Over time, as more acts and recording companies came to Nashville, the city became known as the center of the country music industry. Disc jockey David Cobb is credited with first referring to Nashville as &quot;Music City USA&quot;, a designation that has since been adopted as the city&#x27;s official nickname by the local tourism board.

On November 11, 1928, the Federal Radio Commission implemented General Order 40, which assigned WSM to a frequency of 650 kHz, as Tennessee&#x27;s sole &quot;clear channel&quot; allocation. In 1932, the station boosted its power to 50,000 watts. On September 30, 1950, WSM added a television sister station on channel 4, operating as a primary NBC affiliate; WSM-TV was Nashville&#x27;s first TV station.
The studios remained in its original location until the mid-1960s, when the company built a new headquarters building downtown and new studios for WSM-TV on Knob Road in west Nashville (the TV station had been located near Belmont College). Upon completion of the new headquarters, National Life and Accident Insurance Company chose to relocate WSM radio to their new TV studios, and WSM radio, joined in 1968 by its new FM sister, broadcast from that location from 1966 to 1983. For most of its history, WSM, along with WSM-TV and the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, was owned by the Nashville-based National Life and Accident Insurance Company. In 1974, National Life and Accident Insurance Company reorganized itself as a holding company, NLT Corporation, with the WSM stations as one of the major subsidiaries.

After television became popular (thus largely eliminating the audience for full-length radio programs), WSM adopted a middle of the road (MOR) music format during the daytime hours, and continued to play country music at night. It was not until 1980 that WSM adopted the 24-hour country music format of today.

Country and bluegrass legend John Hartford parodied the distinctive style of WSM DJs on the 1971 album &quot;Aereo-Plain&quot;, humorously changing the station&#x27;s call letters to the phrase &quot;Dorothy S. Ma&#x27;am&quot;.

In 1981, the American General Corporation (now part of the American International Group) bought NLT. At one time, American General was the parent company of the Life and Casualty Insurance Company based in Nashville, former owner of WSM-TV rival WLAC-TV (now WTVF), and WLAC-AM-FM, but divested the broadcast properties in 1975, long before the NLT merger. American General was not interested in NLT&#x27;s non-insurance operations, and sold WSM, Inc. (which included Opryland Hotel, Opryland USA, Ryman Auditorium, The &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, the fledgling The Nashville Network cable television outlet, WSM-FM, and WSM) to Gaylord Broadcasting Company. WSM-TV, due to FCC ownership limits at the time, was sold instead to Gillett Broadcasting and changed its callsign to WSMV-TV. However, there was still considerable overlap between the stations&#x27; on-air personnel for some years after the ownership change. Gaylord would also move the WSM radio stations to new facilities at the Opryland Hotel, departing their shared building on Knob Road, which still houses WSMV today.

WSM broadcast in the C-QUAM format of AM stereo, which could be heard over several states at night, from 1982 until 2000.

In 1996, the station was named Radio Station of the Year at the International Bluegrass Music Awards.

In 2001, management had sought to capitalize on the success of sister station WWTN&#x27;s sports trappings by converting WSM to an all-sports format. Word was leaked to other media resulting in protests, including longtime Opry personalities and country music singers, outside the station&#x27;s studios. Management eventually made the decision to keep the station&#x27;s classic country format.

In 2003, WSM-FM and WWTN, sister stations to WSM, were sold to Citadel Broadcasting; years later these assets would be acquired by Cumulus Media after Citadel&#x27;s bankruptcy. Citadel intended to purchase WSM as well, but Gaylord decided to maintain ownership at the eleventh hour. Through a five-year joint sales agreement, however, Gaylord paid Citadel a fee to operate WSM&#x27;s sales department and provide news updates for the station. Gaylord Entertainment continued to control WSM and operate all other departments, including programming, engineering, and promotions. The agreement ended in 2008, at which point all control of the station reverted to Gaylord. In 2012, Gaylord Entertainment Company was renamed Ryman Hospitality Properties. Ryman sold minority stakes in the Opry businesses to NBCUniversal and Atairos in April 2022, but spun WSM&#x27;s license off into a subsidiary that remained separate from that transaction and wholly-owned by Ryman.

From 2002 until 2006, the station was a choice on Sirius Satellite Radio, which carried a full-time simulcast of WSM&#x27;s signal, except during NASCAR races. Briefly in 2006, the channel converted to &quot;WSM Entertainment&quot;, a separate satellite radio feed that carried the same classic country music format as the AM signal. About a year after the channel was eliminated, then-rival XM Satellite Radio announced the carriage of the Grand Ole Opry on Nashville! channel 11 beginning in October 2007, as well as the Eddie Stubbs Show on America channel 10 beginning in November 2007. After the merger between Sirius and XM, the Grand Ole Opry broadcasts were moved to the service&#x27;s The Roadhouse channel, which is heard on both Sirius and XM.
Following the devastating 2010 Tennessee flood that inundated Gaylord Opryland and the Grand Ole Opry House, the station broadcast from a makeshift studio at its transmitter site for six months, while the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; rotated between several performance sites, until the buildings at the Opryland complex were repaired. WSM&#x27;s administrative offices next door to the Grand Ole Opry House were completely destroyed by the flood, resulting in the loss of several priceless documents from the station&#x27;s history, and later demolished.

In 2024, WSM vacated its longstanding studio inside the Magnolia Lobby of Gaylord Opryland Resort &amp; Convention Center, and began a transition to a new showcase studio inside the home originally built for Roy Acuff on the grounds of the Grand Ole Opry House.

==Transmitter tower==
WSM&#x27;s unusual diamond-shaped transmitting antenna (manufactured by Blaw-Knox) is visible from Interstate 65 just south of Nashville (in Brentwood) and is one of the area&#x27;s landmarks. It is located near the I-65 exit 71 interchange with Concord Road (State Highway 253). When the tower was built in 1932, it was 878 feet (267.6m) tall and was the tallest antenna in North America. Its height was reduced to 808 feet (246 m) in 1939 when it was discovered that the taller tower was causing self-cancellation in the &quot;fringe&quot; areas of reception of the station (it is now known that 195 electrical degrees, about 810 feet, is the optimum height for a Class A station on that frequency). For a period during World War II it was designated to provide transmissions to submarines in the event that ship-to-shore communications were lost. It is now one of the oldest operating broadcast towers in the United States.

As a tribute to the station&#x27;s centrality in country music history, the diamond antenna design was incorporated into the new Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum&#x27;s design in 2001. The tower is listed as a National Engineering Landmark and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 15, 2011.

==Alumni==
* Teddy Bart, a Nashville broadcaster of long tenure, began as a singer on shows like &quot;Waking Crew&quot; and parlayed his skills into hosting that show, an afternoon drive-time program with Larry Munson in the early 1960s and Nashville&#x27;s first-ever call-in talk show, which ran from 1969 to 1981. He also hosted WSM-TV&#x27;s &quot;Noon Show&quot; in the 1970s and anchored WKRN-TV&#x27;s newscast briefly in the early 1980s before launching the group-discussion radio talk show &quot;Roundtable&quot; on WLAC in 1985, a show that ran for 20 years on several different stations.
* Keith Bilbrey moved to Nashville in 1974 to begin working for WSM, first as a substitute announcer for WSM-FM and then as a full-time disc jockey on WSM&#x27;s AM and FM stations. Throughout his career, Bilbrey worked every single time slot at WSM and became an iconic voice in the modern history of the station and was truly a fan favorite. In 1982, Bilbrey began announcing on &quot;The Grand Ole Opry&quot;. When The Nashville Network (TNN) began televising a 30-minute portion of the show in 1985, the young announcer became the first host of &quot;Grand Ole Opry Live&quot;. Bilbrey hosted &quot;Opry Live&quot;, along with the &quot;Opry&quot; warm-up show, &quot;Backstage Live&quot;, until TNN stopped airing the show in 2000. He also hosted the &quot;Opry&quot; warm-up show on WSM. His 35-year career at the station ended in 2009.
* Ralph Emery served as the overnight host of WSM from the late 1950s until the early 1970s. Because of his time slot, listeners all over the U.S. could hear Emery spin country music records. This and &quot;The Grand Ole Opry&quot; solidified WSM&#x27;s central role in the history of country music. In the 1980s, Emery gained further national fame as the host of &quot;Nashville Now!&quot; on The Nashville Network; before then, he hosted syndicated radio and television country music interview shows, and a long-running, highly rated morning show on WSMV-TV.
* Sondra Locke joined the WSM staff in late 1963 or early 1964 as secretary to operations manager Tom Griscom Tom Griscom. She left in 1965 to work for WSM-TV.
* Larry Munson was a sportscaster for the Nashville Vols, Vanderbilt Commodores men&#x27;s basketball and Vanderbilt Commodores football in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as working for WSM-TV. He was later renowned for his long tenure as the legendary voice of Georgia Bulldogs football.

* Pat Sajak (host of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;) served as the afternoon DJ on WSM during the mid-1970s. During that time, he also worked as a weekend weathercaster and substitute talk show host on WSM-TV.
* Eddie Stubbs was the station&#x27;s evening host and hosted of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; from 1995 until his retirement in 2020.
* Ernest Tubb hosted a &quot;Midnite Jamboree&quot; from his record shop following each episode of the &quot;Opry&quot; from 1947 until his death. The &quot;Midnite Jamboree&quot; continued from the record shop after his death, with other hosts, until the record shop closed in 2022.
* Grant Turner (born Jesse Granderson Turner) was known as the &quot;dean of the Opry announcers&quot; and had a nearly 50-year association with the station, also announcing country music programs in the early morning hours. His show was so popular that NL&amp;AI used its title, &quot;Opryland USA,&quot; as the name for the theme park built in 1972.

==Former sister stations==
In 1939, WSM began operating an experimental high-frequency, high-fidelity AM &quot;Apex&quot; station, W4XA, on 26.15 MHz. This was replaced in 1941 by a commercial FM station, initially with the call sign W47NV and operating on 44.7 MHz. This was reported to be first commercial FM to be fully licensed; although a few FM stations had begun broadcasting earlier, they were operating under experimental or &quot;Special Temporary Authorizations&quot; and had not yet been granted operating licenses. In 1943 the call sign was changed to WSM-FM, however the station was shut down in 1951, although its antenna is still mounted atop the Blaw Knox tower at Brentwood.

Seventeen years later the current incarnation of WSM-FM was established after a National Life subsidiary purchased WLWM and renamed it WSM-FM in 1968. This WSM-FM (95.5 MHz) was WSM&#x27;s sister until 2008, when Cumulus Media, the full owner of WSM-FM since 2003, ended its joint sales agreement with the AM station. Despite having the same base call sign, the two stations are no longer related; incidentally, both the current WSM-FM on 95.5 MHz and the current occupant of the 103.3 frequency vacated by the original WSM-FM, WKDF, are now sister stations, with each separately broadcasting a country music format.

Television channel 4 (originally WSM-TV, and now WSMV-TV), was started by WSM, Inc. in 1950 and sold to George N. Gillett Jr. in 1981.

<doc id="862079" wikidata="Q953992" url="?curid=862079" title="Liberal Party (Japan, 1881)">
<text>The is the name of several liberal political parties in the history of Japan, two of which existed in the Empire of Japan prior to 1945.

==Liberal Party of 1881==
The first Liberal Party of Japan was formed on October 18, 1881, by Itagaki Taisuke and other members of the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement (League for the Establishment of a National Assembly) to agitate for the establishment of a national assembly, with a membership based on the ideals of liberal democracy under a constitutional monarchy. It attracted a wide following of former &quot;samurai&quot; who were discontent because they were no longer an elite class and no longer received stipends from the government. The &quot;Jiyūtō&quot; also aimed for suffrage for samurai and an elected assembly in each prefecture. Itagaki was party president, with Nakajima Nobuyuki as vice-president. Other notable members included Gotō Shōjirō, Baba Tatsui, Tetchō Suehiro, Ueki Emori, and Nakae Chōmin.

The Meiji government viewed the growth of the &quot;Jiyūtō&quot; with misgivings, suspecting it of harboring tendencies towards republicanism. The party was also made vulnerable due to peasant uprisings in rural areas led or inspired by local &quot;Jiyūtō&quot; members. The Jiyūtō voted to dissolve itself on October 29, 1884, on the eve of the Chichibu Incident.

In 1887, Gotō Shojirō regrouped some members of the former &quot;Jiyūtō&quot; into a proto-party called the &quot;Daidō Danketsu&quot; Movement. This group split into two groups (Daidō Club led by Kōno Hironaka and Daidō Kyōwakai led by Ōi Kentarō and Nakae Chōmin ) in March 1889. In 1890, they were merged by Itagaki Taisuke to form the Constitutional Liberal Party, which was later renamed the Liberal Party. Some politicians who supported Gotō didn&#x27;t join this party and formed National Liberal Party.

<text>George Jerome Waldo Goodman (August 10, 1930 – January 3, 2014) was an American author and economics broadcast commentator, best known by his pseudonym Adam Smith (which was assigned by Clay Felker at &quot;New York&quot; magazine in order to keep his published articles about Wall Street anonymous). He published fiction under his own name.

==Background, education, and career==
Goodman was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Alexander Mark Goodman and Viona Cremer Goodman. He attended Harvard College, graduating &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, and served as an editor of &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;. Goodman won a Rhodes Scholarship to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he read for the B. Litt. His first novel, &quot;The Bubble Makers&quot;, published simultaneously in the UK and the United States, was written during this period.

In 1954, before the Special Forces became the Green Berets, he joined the US Army Special Forces in the Intelligence group known as Psywar (psychological warfare). In 1961, Goodman married American actress Sally Brophy, with whom he had two children. She died in 2007.

His personal style of presenting economic facts and data has been described as that of &quot;a witty, urbane dinner guest, a droll observer of human affairs&quot;, rather than a stodgy economist. Goodman pioneered a style of financial writing that made the language and concepts of Wall Street more understandable and accessible to the typical investor.

Goodman&#x27;s first non-fiction book, &quot;The Money Game&quot; (1968), was a number one bestseller for over a year and earned him the 1969 Gerald Loeb Special Book Award. In &quot;Paper Money&quot; (1981), he memorably introduced the catchphrase &quot;Assume a can opener&quot; to mock the tendency of economists to make unjustified assumptions and asked &quot;Why are the economists almost always wrong?&quot; During a stint in Hollywood, he wrote screen plays, including that for &quot;The Wheeler Dealers&quot;, starring James Garner and Lee Remick, adapted from his novel of the same title.

He was a member of the Editorial Board of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, an editor of &quot;Esquire Magazine&quot;, a writer for &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine, and a founding member of &quot;New York&quot; magazine where he worked with such writers as Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, and Gloria Steinem.

In 1984, Goodman came to television as the creator, anchor and editor-in-chief of &quot;Adam Smith&#x27;s Money World&quot;. Running on the Public Broadcasting Service in the US, it became the most honored program in its field, winning eight Emmy nominations and five Emmy Awards, as well as the Overseas Press Club Award. The documentary specials won gold medals at the Houston International Film Festival and the Flagstaff Film Festival. The show used cartoon characters and reports from the field to explain and simplify complex financial subjects to its audience. Airing in over forty countries, it was also the first American business news show broadcast in the Soviet Union, airing weekly with a Russian soundtrack.

In 1998 Goodman was elected as a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration.

==Recent work==
Beginning in 1998 Goodman traveled the globe each year doing specials on countries and regions with fast-growing or emerging economies such as China, Russia, the Pacific Rim, Latin America, India, and Israel. Goodman has also conducted interviews with leaders in both the fields of business and politics—ranging from Warren Buffett to Mikhail Gorbachev.

Beginning March 10, 2008, Goodman appeared along with two other personal finance advisers in the &quot;Dollars and Sense&quot; television advertising campaign for the Hyundai Motor Company.

==Death==
Goodman&#x27;s son Mark announced his father died at the age of 83 on January 3, 2014, at the University of Miami Hospital after a long battle with the bone marrow disorder myelofibrosis.

<doc id="862085" wikidata="Q366046" url="?curid=862085" title="Nikita Panin">
<text>Count Nikita Ivanovich Panin (; ) was an influential Russian statesman and political mentor to Catherine the Great for the first 18 years of her reign (1762–1780). In that role, he advocated the Northern Alliance, closer ties with Frederick the Great of Prussia and the establishment of an advisory privy council. His staunch opposition to the Partitions of Poland led to his being replaced by the more compliant Prince Alexander Bezborodko. Catherine appointed many men to the Senate who were related to Panin&#x27;s powerful family.

==Early life and career==
Nikita Ivanovich Panin was born in Danzig, to the Russian commandant of Pärnu, the city where he would spend most of his childhood. In 1740, he entered the Imperial Russian Army, and was rumored to be one of the favorites of Empress Elizabeth. In 1747, he was accredited to Copenhagen as Russian minister, but a few months later was transferred to Stockholm, where for the next 12 years he played a conspicuous part as the chief opponent of the French party. During his residence in Sweden, Panin, who certainly had a strong speculative bent, is said to have conceived a fondness for constitutional forms of government. Politically, he was a pupil of Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin; consequently, when in the middle 1750s, Russia suddenly turned Francophile instead of Francophobe, Panin&#x27;s position became extremely difficult. However, he found a friend in Bestuzhev&#x27;s supplanter, Mikhail Illarionovich Vorontsov, and when in 1760 he was unexpectedly appointed the governor of the little grand duke Paul, his influence was assured.

==Catherine&#x27;s reign==
Panin supported Catherine when she overthrew her husband, Tsar Peter III, and declared herself empress in 1762, but his jealousy of Catherine&#x27;s lovers caused him to constantly try to sleep with her. Also, his jealousy of the influence which Grigory Orlov and his brothers seemed likely to obtain over the new empress predisposed him to favor the proclamation of his ward the grand duke Paul as emperor, with Catherine as regent only. To circumscribe the influence of the ruling favorites, he next suggested the formation of a cabinet council of six or eight ministers, through whom all the business of the state was to be transacted, but Catherine, suspecting in the skillfully presented novelty a subtle attempt to limit her power, rejected it after some hesitation. Nevertheless, Panin continued to be indispensable. His influence partly was because he was the governor of Paul, who was greatly attached to him, partly to the peculiar circumstances in which Catherine had mounted the throne, and partly to his knowledge of foreign affairs. Although acting as minister of foreign affairs, he was never made chancellor.

Panin was the inventor of the famous Northern Accord, which aimed at opposing a combination of Russia, Prussia, Poland, Sweden, and perhaps Great Britain, against the Bourbon-Habsburg League. Such an attempt to bind together nations with such different aims and characters was doomed to failure. Great Britain, for instance, could never be persuaded it was as much in her interests as in the interests of Russia to subsidize the anti-French party in Sweden. Several other accords were attempted as well, such as Grigory Potemkin&#x27;s &quot;Eastern System&quot; (this later resulted in the basis for Catherine the Great&#x27;s Greek Plan). Yet, the idea of the Northern Accord, though never quite realized, had important political consequences and influenced the policy of Russia for many years. It explains, too, Panin&#x27;s strange tenderness toward Poland. For a long time, he could not endure the thought of destroying her, because he regarded her as an indispensable member of his accord, wherein she was to replace Austria, which circumstances had temporarily detached from the Russian alliance. All of the diplomatic questions concerning Russia from 1762 to 1783 are intimately associated with the name of Panin. His influence began to wane only when the impossibility of realizing the Northern Accord, his pet scheme over which Russia had fruitlessly sacrificed millions of rubles, became evident.

==Decline==
After 1772, when Gustav III upset Panin&#x27;s plans in Sweden, Panin pursued a policy of the Russo-Prussian alliance. As to Poland, his views differed widely from the views of both Frederick and Catherine. He firmly guaranteed the integrity of Polish territory, after placing Stanisław II on the throne, so Poland, undivided and as strong as circumstances would permit, might be drawn wholly within the orbit of Russia. He did not foresee, though, the complications which were likely to arise from Russia&#x27;s interference in the domestic affairs of Poland. Thus, the Bar Confederation, and the ensuing Russo-Turkish War, took him completely by surprise and considerably weakened his position. He was forced to acquiesce in the First Partition of Poland, and when Russia came off third-best, Grigory Orlov declared in the council that the minister who had signed such a partition treaty was worthy of death.

Panin further incensed Catherine by meddling with the marriage arrangements of the grand duke Paul and by advocating a closer alliance with Prussia, whereas the empress was beginning to incline more and more towards Austria. Nevertheless, even after Paul&#x27;s second marriage, Panin maintained all his old influence over his pupil, who, like himself, was now a warm admirer of the king of Prussia. Traditional tales exist from this period of an actual conspiracy of Panin and Paul against the empress. As the Austrian influence increased, Panin found a fresh enemy in Joseph II, and the efforts of the old statesman to prevent a matrimonial alliance between the Russian and Austrian courts catalyzed Catherine into getting rid of a counselor of whom, for some mysterious reason, she was secretly afraid. The circumstances of his disgrace are complicated and obscure. The final rupture seems to have arisen on the question of the declaration of the armed neutrality of the North, but it is known that Grigory Potemkin and the British ambassador, James Harris, had both been working against him some time before that. In May 1781, Panin was dismissed. He died two years later in the spring of 1783.

==Personal qualities==
Panin was one of the most learned, accomplished, and courteous Russians of his day. Catherine called him her encyclopedia. British ambassador John Hobart declared him to be the most amiable negotiator he had ever met. He was also of a most humane disposition and a friend of liberal institutions. As to his honesty and kindness of heart there were never two opinions. By nature a sybarite, he took care to have the best cook in the capital, and women had for him an irresistible attraction, though he never married.
