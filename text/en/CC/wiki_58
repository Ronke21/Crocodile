<text>The Digital IXUS (IXY Digital in Japan and [[Canon PowerShot|PowerShot]] Digital ELPH in US and Canada) is a series of digital cameras released by Canon. It is a line of ultracompact cameras, originally based on the design of Canon&#x27;s IXUS/IXY/ELPH line of APS cameras.

==History==
Canon&#x27;s PowerShot A and S line of the time were being made as small as contemporary technology allowed, and demonstrated the demand for a small digital camera of good quality. Canon used its experience with small film cameras, particularly the APS IXUS, to mass-produce good digital cameras smaller than anyone else had managed up to the time (the first Digital IXUS was the smallest 2 MP then available) and reused the popular IXUS/IXY/ELPH brand name with the tag line &quot;The DIGITAL IXUS blends Canon&#x27;s award-winning IXUS design with PowerShot digital technology.&quot;

The first Digital IXUS, released in June 2003 fitted the technology of the PowerShot S11 into a body similar to the APS IXUS II. Between 2004 and 2005, starting with the Digital IXUS II, Canon moved from the use of CF cards to SD cards to create thinner cameras.

Several models have found favor within the Kite Aerial Photography (KAP) community due to a unique combination of small size/ low weight, excellent image quality with stabilization, and the option of expanded manual control including intervalometer functionality available via 3rd party CHDK.

== G-series in a compact body ==
The IXUS 901Ti was the first in a series of IXUS and S-series cameras that feature the Digic image processors and larger than average sensors as fitted to the advanced PowerShot G-series cameras. The IXUS / S-series and the equivalent G-series models are listed below:

* IXUS 901 Ti (SD900)* / PowerShot G7 / Digic III / 10 MP 3648 × 2736 1/1.8″ CCD.
* IXUS 960 IS (SD950IS)* / PowerShot G9 / Digic III / 12.1 MP 4000 × 3000 1/1.7″ CCD.
* IXUS 980 IS (SD990IS) / PowerShot G10 / Digic 4 / 14.7 MP 4416 × 3312 1/1.7″ CCD.
* PowerShot S90, S95, S200 / PowerShot G11, G12 / Digic 4 / 10 MP 3648 × 2736 1/1.7″ CCD (S200 features Digic 5).
* PowerShot S100, S120 / PowerShot G15 / Digic 5 / 12.1 MP 4000×3000 1/1.7&quot; CMOS.
* Powershot S120 / PowerShot G16 / Digic 6 / 12.1 MP 4000×3000 1/1.7&quot; CMOS.

(* The IXUS 900 Ti and 960 IS feature a titanium body.)

==Models==

The same camera models are released in Europe, the US, and Japan under different names. The cameras themselves are identical apart from the front fascia, according to the parts lists. The Canon model number on the bottom is consistent between marketing names.
This article uses the Digital IXUS model names unless otherwise stated. The comparison tables in this article list equivalent IXY Digital and PowerShot Digital ELPH model names.

All models use lithium ion batteries of Canon proprietary design, though third-party equivalents are readily available.

All models introduced before 2010 use RGBG Bayer filter (except the original Digital IXUS, which uses a CYGM filter) CCD sensors made by Sony. IXUS 300 HS/PowerShot Digital ELPH SD4000 IS/IXY 30S introduced in May 2010 and all following models have back-illuminated CMOS sensor. Images are recorded as JPEGs. Raw image files are not accessible without the use of third party firmware such as CHDK.

In 2010, Canon dropped the prefix &quot;Digital&quot; as well as suffix &quot;IS&quot; (Image Stabilization) from the names of the new models e.g. IXUS 105. A similar change was applied to the IXY-series names used in the Japanese market. The United States market naming was simplified in 2011: &quot;Digital&quot; and &quot;IS&quot; were removed as well as &quot;SD&quot; prefix. Newer US and European model carry &quot;HS&quot; suffix, that stands for &quot;high sensitivity&quot;.

The Digital IXUS series slots above the PowerShot A in Canon&#x27;s point-and-shoot lineup, with models in the Digital IXUS range commanding a considerable price premium. However, since the late 2000s, with the falling prices of Digital IXUS models in Canadian and U.S. markets, they have become among some of the lower-priced models available as PowerShot A models are gradually withdrawn from the market and not replaced.

===IXUS/ELPH/IXY cameras using CF storage===
The PowerShot Digital ELPH using CF have Sxxx model number.

====IXUS 400====
The Canon Digital IXUS 400 (PowerShot ELPH S400 in North America and IXY Digital 400 in Japan) featured:
* Maximum resolution: 2272 × 1704 (3.8 megapixels)
* Image ratio 4:3
* Memory Format Compact Flash
* ISO 50–400
* 35 mm equivalent: 36 mm–108 mm
* Aperture –
* Battery NB-1LH, 3.7 V 840 mAh lithium-ion rechargeable

The internal wiring of the CCD can become disconnected in high-temperature or high-humidity environments. Canon issued a recall in October 2006. The damaged CCD displays purple or blueish, distorted or possibly no image at all. The menu and pictures taken prior to the CCD disconnect will still display normally.

The camera also incorrectly reports a problem with the memory card (Memory Card Error message). This problem can be temporarily overcome by removing both the main battery as well as the small internal battery. Canon has acknowledged this issue, and formerly repaired free of charge.

====IXUS 430====
The Canon Digital IXUS 430 is (PowerShot ELPH S410 in North America and IXY Digital 450 in Japan) featured
4.0 megapixels, 3x zoom lens, and i3 minute videos with sound.

There has been a Service Notice by Canon stating that the vendor supplied CCD image sensor used in this camera can cause a malfunction. The affected cameras (s410) show the symptoms such as a corrupted image, lines going across the LCD screen, lack of color of the image produced, or no image produced. Shots by the camera will also display these symptoms. In Canon&#x27;s service notice they also stated the following: &quot;Effective immediately, and regardless of warranty status, Canon will repair, free of charge, products exhibiting the above-mentioned malfunction if the malfunction is caused by the CCD image sensor. Canon will also cover the cost of shipping and handling in connection with this repair.&quot;

===IXUS/ELPH/IXY cameras using SD storage===

The PowerShot Digital ELPH using SD had SDxxx or SDxxxx model number prior to 2011 models&#x27; introduction.

===IXUS i/ELPH SDxx/IXY L Cameras===
==Accessories==
*IXUS: AW-PS200 all-weather enclosure
*IXUS 330: WP-DC500 waterproof enclosure
*IXUS 400/430/500: WP-DC800 waterproof enclosure
*IXUS i: AW-DC10 all-weather enclosure
*IXUS 50: AW-DC30 all-weather enclosure
*IXUS 55: AW-DC50 all-weather enclosure
*SD700 IS: WP-DC5 waterproof enclosure
*External flash: High-Power Flash HF-DC1

==Known problems==
A firmware bug exists that can cause the IXUS 400 (and possibly other cameras with the same firmware) to display a &quot;Memory card error&quot; message after the camera has been in use for some time. Contrary to the message, there may not actually be anything wrong with the memory card. Descriptions of the fix recommend simultaneously removing the internal and external batteries to reset the camera. Canon has acknowledged this issue and formerly repaired it free of charge.

A number of camera models across several manufacturers used a Sony CCD that was prone to failure. Canon put out a general recall in late 2005 on affected models and serial numbers. Models from the IXUS range are the v3, II, and IIs. Canon has issued a support advisory stating it will repair affected cameras free of charge. This free repair service for Canon cameras with defective CCD image sensors is gradually being phased out; in the UK, the free service end date for IXUS II cameras was 31 January 2011.

Like all compacts with a zoom lens, cameras in the IXUS range are susceptible to the &quot;lens error&quot; message if the lens is physically unable to zoom in or out. On Canon cameras, this manifests as the E18 error or the message &quot;Lens error, restart camera&quot; on more recent models.

<text>The 169th Infantry Division () was a German infantry division during World War II.

==History==

The division was formed in 1939. It took part in Operation Fall Gelb and stayed in France until being transferred to Finnish Lapland in 1941. The division was part of the German XXXVI Corps which also included SS Division Nord and the Finnish 6th Division. On 1 July the corps began its attack which was aimed at Kandalaksha on the White Sea coast. The division crossed the Finnish-Soviet Border just north of Salla. During the heavy fighting against the Soviet 122nd Division the SS Division Nord broke and fled. On 8 July the 169th occupied Salla. With the help of the Finnish 6th Division the Soviets were pushed back beyond the pre-Winter War borders.

In September the division had advanced to the River Verman (&quot;Vermanjoki&quot;), here the offensive finally stalled. During autumn 1941 AOK Norwegen decided to shifts its attack to the area held by the Finnish 3rd Division. The 169th Division stayed in the area around Salla until the beginning of hostilities between Finland and Germany in 1944. During 1944 the division withdrew back to Norway, then was transferred to Germany where it fought out the final few weeks of the war.

<doc id="861139" wikidata="Q7721161" url="?curid=861139" title="The Canary Trainer">
<text>The Canary Trainer: From the Memoirs of John H. Watson is a 1993 Sherlock Holmes pastiche by Nicholas Meyer. Like &quot;The Seven Percent Solution&quot; and &quot;The West End Horror&quot;, &quot;The Canary Trainer&quot; was published as a &quot;lost manuscript&quot; of the late Dr. John H. Watson. In &quot;The Adventure of Black Peter&quot;, an original Arthur Conan Doyle Holmes story from 1904, Watson mentions that his companion recently arrested &quot;Wilson, the notorious canary-trainer, which removed a plague-spot from the East-End of London.&quot; This Wilson (who figures prominently in the Adrian Conan Doyle pastiche &quot;The Adventure of the Deptford Horror&quot;) is not related to the eponymous character of Meyer&#x27;s novel. Meyer&#x27;s &quot;trainer&quot; is Erik, the principal figure of Gaston Leroux&#x27;s 1910 novel &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. It is from this unchronicled tale that The Notorious Canary Trainers (a Sherlockian scion in Madison, Wisconsin, founded in 1969) take their name.

&quot;The Canary Trainer&quot; describes Holmes&#x27;s adventures during &quot;The Great Hiatus&quot; of 1891–1894, when (according to the Sherlockian Canon) he was traveling the world, trying to escape the minions of Professor Moriarty; in Meyer&#x27;s &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot;, however, a different impetus is given for this period, and this alternate scenario is maintained here. The bulk of the novel is a first-person narrative, in which Holmes recounts a visit to Paris, where he played violin for the Palais Garnier and became entangled with a mysterious &quot;Phantom&quot;. Although Dr. Watson appears only in the novel&#x27;s 1912 bookend scenes, a significant sub-plot concerns Holmes&#x27; efforts to (temporarily) replace the former with a young Parisian, who, while useful, is not nearly as brave or devoted as Holmes&#x27; usual companion.

This novel takes place before Meyer&#x27;s second Holmes pastiche, &quot;The West End Horror&quot;.

==Plot summary==

In 1912, Dr. Watson visits the retired Sherlock Holmes, who is happily cultivating bees on the Sussex Downs. Holmes seems mostly concerned about interesting Watson in his new hobby, but Watson prefers to interrogate Holmes and fill some of the gaps in previous Sherlockian history. For example, Watson says, Holmes&#x27;s account of how he spent the &quot;Lost Years&quot; (1891 to 1895) was laden with contradictions. Finally, he persuades Holmes to retell one episode of his adventures.

The narration switches to Holmes. He describes how, following the events of &quot;The Seven Percent Solution&quot;, he traveled Europe and slowly realized that the entire world believed him dead. Wandering aimlessly, he finds himself in Paris, where after a short-lived stint as a violin instructor, he obtains a position at the Paris Opéra. From the very beginning, his job has ominous undertones. For example, the vacancy only appeared because the previous violinist ran into the street, swearing that he would never work in the place again. This does not daunt Holmes, who interviews with and favourably impresses the conductor, Maître Gaston Leroux.

Holmes gradually becomes accustomed to the Opera&#x27;s distinctive culture. He learns that all minor mishaps are attributed to the Ghost, a spectral personage who haunts the Opera&#x27;s labyrinthine passageways, sometimes appearing to ballet dancers wearing an evening suit but without a head.

All goes well until the prima donna soprano, La Sorelli, falls ill and is replaced by Irene Adler, a past adversary known for her ability to outwit Holmes. His admiration for her provokes uncertain emotions, largely foreign to his calculating nature—but he soon realizes that torment is secondary, when the opera rehearsals subject him to her incomparably beautiful singing. He suffers in silence until Adler sees his profile in a Degas painting, whereupon she realizes that he is alive, and enlists his help. She has taken the young coloratura Christine Daaé &quot;under her wing&quot;, and is fearful that the innocent singer may fall prey to intrigue once Adler has left.

Irene Adler blackmails Holmes into assisting her, promising that she will remain silent about his survival. While investigating the intrigues that surround Christine, Holmes appears to run afoul of the Opera Ghost.

==Characters==
Note: Bolded characters are based upon characters from &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. &quot;Italicized&quot; characters are based on existing Sherlock Holmes stories. 
*&quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; – the detective, protagonist
*&quot;Dr. Watson&quot; – initial narrator
*La Sorelli – the prima donna soprano
*&quot;Irene Adler&quot; – also a singer (previously appeared in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;)
*Christine Daaé – the young coloratura
*Maître Gaston Leroux – the conductor
*The Phantom of the Opera/Nobody: identified in the original novel as Erik, but never named in Meyer&#x27;s version.

==Reception==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; found the book lacking, calling the finale &quot;anticlimactic&quot; and summing the review up by saying &quot;Should appeal to those fans (and there will be plenty) who can overlook the undistinguished stylistic pastiche--Holmes rather unwisely narrates this lost adventure himself--the footnotes that explain every last Holmesian reference, and the unfortunate poverty of the plot.&quot; Matthew Bunson in &quot;Encyclopedia Sherlockiana&quot; said the plot worked nicely within Leroux&#x27;s original novel but found the climax &quot;unequal to the reputations of both characters&quot; and found Watson to be &quot;acutely missed.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said that &quot;Meyer&#x27;s casual plotting (piggybacking on the over-familiar Phantom outline) sinks on occasion into travelogue and affords Holmes little opportunity to flex his deductive muscles&quot; but &quot;overall, Meyer treats his readers to a lively and entertaining, if undemanding ride.&quot;

==Allusions to other works==
In the prologue, Meyer refers to the &quot;Baring-Gould papers&quot; as having caused a resumption of interest in Holmes&#x27; life, and Meyer includes several allusions to William S. Baring-Gould&#x27;s works. At the end of the novel, Holmes implies that he and Adler consummated their relationship in Montenegro; this seems to be a reference to Baring-Gould&#x27;s theory that Nero Wolfe was the love child of Holmes and Adler from an affair they had in Montenegro in 1892. Holmes&#x27; undercover name, Sigerson, is both a reference to Conan Doyle&#x27;s story &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot; where Holmes uses that name, and Baring-Gould&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street&quot;, where Holmes&#x27; father&#x27;s name was Siger.

Raoul compares Holmes to Auguste Dupin, a comparison which causes Holmes some offense. Watson had also compared Holmes to Dupin in &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, with similar results.

The Marquis de St.-Evremonde, the descendant of Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette from &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, is among the guests of the Paris Opera.

In the novel&#x27;s afterword, Meyer acknowledges the two most obvious influences, Conan Doyle&#x27;s vast Sherlockian opus and Gaston Leroux&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, which Meyer terms an &quot;absurdist masterpiece&quot;.

<doc id="861160" wikidata="Q2510218" url="?curid=861160" title="Kigeli V Ndahindurwa">
<text>Kigeli V Ndahindurwa (born Jean-Baptiste Ndahindurwa; 29 June 1936 – 16 October 2016) was the last ruling King (&quot;Mwami&quot;) of Rwanda, from 28 July 1959 until the end of the UN-mandate with Belgian administration and the declaration of an independent Republic of Rwanda 1 July 1962. On 25 September 1961, a referendum voted for the abolition of the Rwandan monarchy following the Rwandan Revolution.

After a brief period of moveabouts after leaving Rwanda, the titular King lived in exile during the final part of his life in the town of Oakton, Virginia, United States. In exile, he was known for heading the King Kigeli V Foundation, an organisation promoting humanitarian work for Rwandan refugees. He was also notable for his activities in maintaining the dynastic, cultural heritage of his formerly reigning royal house, including noble titles, dynastic orders of chivalry and other distinctions.

After the king&#x27;s death, a successor was said to be shortly revealed. In January 2017, it was announced that Yuhi VI would succeed him. Yuhi VI is the nephew of both the late King Kigeli V and the previous King Mutara III, as well as a grandson of King Yuhi V.

==Early life and education==
Kigeli was born Ndahindurwa on 29 June 1936 in Kamembe, Rwanda, to Yuhi Musinga (the deposed King Yuhi V Musinga), and Queen Mukashema (born Mukashema Bernadette), the seventh of his eleven wives. He was ethnically Tutsi. Kigeli had fourteen siblings, being one of the youngest of his father&#x27;s many children.

When Kigeli was 4 years old, his father was exiled by the Belgian government to Moba, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Following the death of his father, in 1944 he returned to Rwanda. Kigeli was baptised in the Catholic Church in his teens, taking the Christian name Jean-Baptiste, and remained a devout Catholic throughout his life.

He received his education at the Groupe Scolaire Astrida (now Groupe Scolaire Officiel de Butare) in Rwanda, and at the Nyangezi College in the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo. After he finished school in 1956, he worked in local government in Rwanda until 1959.

==Reign in Rwanda==

After his half-brother, King Mutara III Rudahigwa, died under mysterious circumstances on 25 July 1959, it was announced on 28 July that Kigeli would succeed him as King Kigeli V Ndahindurwa. &quot;Kigeli&quot; is sometimes transcribed as &quot;Kigeri&quot;. Though married, Kigeli&#x27;s late half-brother had had no children; the abrupt, shocking nature of the death prompted widespread talk of some kind of assassination having occurred.

Kigeli&#x27;s appointment was a surprise to the Belgian administration, who were not involved in his selection, and who described the event as a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, a view shared by the newly politically empowered Hutu elite. Kigeli himself also felt shocked and overwhelmed at the news of his ascension. The tense atmosphere and presence of armed Rwandans at the funeral prevented the Belgians from objecting, as well as preventing Hutu interference. Despite this, Kigeli was initially favoured by all sides: Tutsi traditionalists, Hutu nationalists, and the Catholic clergy all felt optimistic on his appointment. However, the manner of his appointment led to a loss of prestige for the Belgian authorities, and gave both Hutu and Tutsi revolutionaries the impression that violence might further their goals. The fact that the Tutsi establishment had engineered the rise to power also compromised Kigeli&#x27;s ability to act in the traditional role as a neutral arbiter of differing factions.

Kigeli duly followed regal tradition by disregarding past ethnic and ideological affiliations, embracing the role of the &#x27;father of all Rwandan people&#x27;. However, political instability and tribal conflict grew despite efforts by the monarchy and others. Only a month after Kigeli&#x27;s November 1959 ascension, Hutu versus Tutsi militancy increased to the point that hundreds died. Many Tutsi went into exile. Issues with the increasingly restive Hutu population were encouraged by the Belgian military, promoting widespread revolt. Kigeli later wrote, &quot;I am not clinging to power... I will always accept the people’s verdict; what I cannot accept is that the Belgian Administration should influence or distort this verdict.&quot;

In July 1960, Kigeli sought safe haven in the newly independent nation of Congo. In 1961, Kigeli was in Kinshasa to meet Secretary General of the United Nations Dag Hammarskjöld when Dominique Mbonyumutwa, with the support of the Belgian government, led a coup d&#x27;état that took control of the Rwandan state. The monarchy&#x27;s rule was formally overthrown on 28 January 1961. The coup resulted in the 1961 referendum about the fate of the nation&#x27;s royal system.

The election results showed that, with about 95% turnout, around 80% of voters opposed the continuation of the monarchy. Kigeli criticized the affair as rigged; soon after re-entering Rwanda prior to the election, Belgian officials put him under house arrest.

The government officially deported Kigeli to what is now Tanzania on 2 October 1961. He subsequently lived in multiple other locations, leaving the region of Tanganyika (living in Dar es Salaam) for places such as Kampala, Uganda, and Nairobi, Kenya. He was granted political asylum in the United States in July 1992. He resided in the U.S. for the rest of his life.

==Exile activities==
Granted political asylum by the United States, he settled near Washington, D.C., where he claimed welfare, and lived in subsidized housing. He subsequently settled in the Oakton, Virginia, area.

He travelled internationally to speak on behalf of the Rwandan people and repeatedly called for peace and harmony between the different groups. Kigeli continued to remember the victims of the genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda and attempted to reconcile all political, ethnic, and religious parties in Rwanda to use the democratic process to solve any disputes. Kigeli was a friend of former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela and the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Patrice Lumumba.

In 1995, while in Southern California, Kigeli met author and historian Charles A. Coulombe, an American representative of the International Monarchist League, a London-based organization that attempts to reinstate deposed royalty in various parts of the world.

In an August 2007 BBC interview, Kigeli expressed an interest in returning to Rwanda if the Rwandan people were prepared to accept him as their constitutional monarch. He said that he had met President Paul Kagame and that Kagame had told him that he and his family were free to return, but Kigeli said that in order to do so, he needed to know if the people still wanted him to be king. According to Kigeli, Kagame said that he would consult the government about the issue.

===Charity===
He was the head of the King Kigeli V Foundation, whose mission is to bring humanitarian initiatives on behalf of Rwandan refugees.

==Death and succession==
Kigeli died of a heart ailment at the age of eighty on the morning of 16 October 2016 in a hospital in Washington, D.C. His private secretary, Guye Pennington, said that an heir had been chosen and would be announced shortly. Kigeli never married, in obedience to a rule banning marriage for kings while they were out of the country.

Although Kigeli never married, on 9 January 2017, the Royal House announced that his nephew, Prince Emmanuel Bushayija (to reign as Yuhi VI of Rwanda), would succeed him as pretender to the Rwandan throne. He is the son of the half-brother of Kigeli, Prince William Bushayija.

After Kigeli&#x27;s death, it was revealed he had at least one daughter, Jacqueline Rwivanga, married to Andrew Rugasira 1998-2015 and a mother of five.

== Ancestry ==
==Honours==
===Status and recognition===

As titular King in exile, as part of maintaining his royal family&#x27;s cultural heritage, Kigeli V issued chivalric orders and titles of nobility with himself as fount of honour, in accordance with traditional customs.

Research in 2016 found that noble Rwandan titles were given to non-Rwandans by King Mutara III, the prior King of Rwanda. This was consistent with King Kigeli V&#x27;s statements that his elder brother, when he reigned as King, granted orders and noble titles to non-Rwandans. An independent article confirming this was printed in an article titled &quot;African King Gets Papal Honor from Vatican&quot; in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, a publication of the Diocese of Little Rock, Arkansas, United States, 4 July 1947.

The titles are recognised by Burke&#x27;s Peerage

<doc id="861161" wikidata="Q748822" url="?curid=861161" title="Private press">
<text>Private press publishing, with respect to books, is an endeavor performed by craft-based expert or aspiring artisans, either amateur or professional, who, among other things, print and build books, typically by hand, with emphasis on design, graphics, layout, fine printing, binding, covers, paper, stitching, and the like.

== Description ==
The term &quot;private press&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;fine press&quot;, &quot;small press&quot;, or &quot;university press&quot; – though there are similarities. One similarity shared by all is that they need not meet higher commercial thresholds of commercial presses. Private presses, however, often have no profit motive. A similarity shared with fine and small presses, but not university presses, is that for various reasons – namely quality – production quantity is often limited. University presses are typically more automated. A distinguishing quality of private presses is that they enjoy sole discretion over literary, scientific, artistic, and aesthetic merits. Criteria for other types of presses vary. From an aesthetic perspective, critical acclaim and public appreciation of artisans&#x27; works from private presses is somewhat analogous to that of luthiers&#x27; works of fine string instruments and bows.

== Etymological perspective ==
The private press movement, and its renowned body of work – relative to the larger world of book arts in Western civilization – is narrow and recent. From one perspective, collections relating to book arts date back to before the High Middle Ages. As an illustration of scope and influence, a 1980 exhibition at Catholic University of America, &quot;The Monastic Imprint,&quot; highlighted the influence of book arts and textual scholarship from 1200 to 1980, displaying hundreds of diplomas, manuscript codices, incunabula, printed volumes, and calligraphic and private press ephemera. The displays focused on five areas: (1) Medieval Monasticism, Spirituality, and Scribal Culture, A.D. 1200–1500; (2) Early Printing and the Monastic Scholarly Tradition, ca. 1450–1600; (3) Early modern Monastic Printing and Scholarly Publishing, A.D. 1650–1800; (4) Modern Survivals: Monastic Scriptoria, Private Presses, and Academic Publishing, 1800–1980.

The earliest descriptive references to private presses were by Bernardus A. Mallinckrodt of Mainz, Germany, in (Cologne, 1639). The earliest in-depth writing about private presses was by Adam Heinrich Lackmann (de) (1694–1754) in (Hamburg, 1740).

== Private press movement ==
===By location===
====United Kingdom====
The term &quot;private press&quot; is often used to refer to a movement in book production which flourished around the turn of the 20th century under the influence of the scholar-artisans William Morris, Sir Emery Walker and their followers. The movement is often considered to have begun with the founding of Morris&#x27; Kelmscott Press in 1890, following a lecture on printing given by Walker at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in November 1888. Morris decried that the Industrial Revolution had ruined man&#x27;s joy in work and that mechanization, to the extent that it has replaced handicraft, had brought ugliness with it. Those involved in the private press movement created books by traditional printing and binding methods, with an emphasis on the book as a work of art and manual skill, as well as a medium for the transmission of information. Morris was greatly influenced by medieval codices and early printed books and the &#x27;Kelmscott style&#x27; had a great, and not always positive, influence on later private presses and commercial book-design. The movement was an offshoot of the Arts and Crafts movement, and represented a rejection of the cheap mechanised book-production methods which developed in the Victorian era. The books were made with high-quality materials (handmade paper, traditional inks and, in some cases, specially designed typefaces), and were often bound by hand. Careful consideration was given to format, page design, type, illustration and binding, to produce a unified whole. The movement dwindled during the worldwide depression of the 1930s, as the market for luxury goods evaporated. Since the 1950s, there has been a resurgence of interest, especially among artists, in the experimental use of letterpress printing, paper-making and hand-bookbinding in producing small editions of &#x27;artists&#x27; books&#x27;, and among amateur (and a few professional) enthusiasts for traditional printing methods and for the production &#x27;values&#x27; of the private press movement.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand university private presses have been significant in the private press movement. Private presses are active at three New Zealand universities: Auckland (Holloway Press), Victoria (Wai-te-ata Press) and Otago (Otakou Press).

====North America====
A 1982 &quot;Newsweek&quot; article about the rebirth of the hand press movement asserted that Harry Duncan was &quot;considered the father of the post-World War II private-press movement.&quot; Will Ransom has been credited as the father of American private press historiographers.

===Selected history===
====Quality control====
Beyond aesthetics, private presses, historically, have served other needs. John Hunter (1728–1793), a Scottish surgeon and medical researcher, established a private press in 1786 at his house at 13 Castle Street, Leicester Square, in West End of London, in an attempt to prevent unauthorized publication of cheap and foreign editions of his works. His first book from his private press: &quot;A Treatise on the Venereal Disease.&quot; One thousand copies of the first edition were printed.

====Academics====
Porter Garnett (1871–1951), of Carnegie Mellon University, was an exponent of the anti-industrial values of the great private presses – namely those of Kelmscott, Doves, and Ashendene. Following Garnett&#x27;s inspirational proposal to Carnegie Mellon, Garnett designed and inaugurated on April 7, 1923, the institute&#x27;s Laboratory Press – for the purpose of teaching printing, which he believed was the first private press devoted solely for that purpose. The press closed in 1935.

=== Opponents ===
William Addison Dwiggins (1880–1956), a commercial artist, is lauded for high quality work, namely with Alfred Knopf. And, in contrast to many first-rate book designers joining private presses, he refused. Historian Paul Shaw explained, &quot;He had no patience with those who insisted on retaining hand processes in printing and publishing in the belief that they were inherently superior to machine processes.&quot; Dwiggins&#x27;s &quot;principal concern ultimately centered on readers and their reading needs, esthetic as well as financial. [His] goal was to make books that were beautiful, functional, and inexpensive.&quot;

<text>In electrical engineering, a practical electric power source which is a linear circuit may, according to Thévenin&#x27;s theorem, be represented as an ideal voltage source in series with an impedance. This impedance is termed the internal resistance of the source. When the power source delivers current, the measured voltage output is lower than the no-load voltage; the difference is the voltage drop (the product of current and resistance) caused by the internal resistance. The concept of internal resistance applies to all kinds of electrical sources and is useful for analyzing many types of circuits.

==Battery==
A battery may be modeled as a voltage source in series with a resistance. These types of models are known as equivalent circuit models. Another common model being physiochemical models that are physical in nature involving concentrations and reaction rates. In practice, the internal resistance of a battery is dependent on its size, state of charge, chemical properties, age, temperature, and the discharge current. It has an electronic component due to the resistivity of the component materials and an ionic component due to electrochemical factors such as electrolyte conductivity, ion mobility, speed of electrochemical reaction and electrode surface area. Measurement of the internal resistance of a battery is a guide to its condition, but may not apply at other than the test conditions. Measurement with an alternating current, typically at a frequency of , may underestimate the resistance, as the frequency may be too high to take into account slower electrochemical processes. Internal resistance depends on temperature; for example, a fresh Energizer E91 AA alkaline primary battery drops from about 0.9 Ω at -40 °C, when the low temperature reduces ion mobility, to about 0.15 Ω at room temperature and about 0.1 Ω at 40 °C. A large part of this drop is due to the increase in the magnitude of the electrolyte diffusion coefficient.

The internal resistance of a battery may be calculated from its open circuit voltage &quot;V&quot;NL, load voltage &quot;V&quot;FL, and the load resistance &quot;R&quot;L:

formula_1

This can also be expressed in terms of the Overpotential η and the current I:

formula_2

Many equivalent series resistance (ESR) meters, essentially AC milliohm-meters normally used to measure the ESR of capacitors, can be used to estimate battery internal resistance, particularly to check the state of discharge of a battery rather than obtain an accurate DC value. Some chargers for rechargeable batteries indicate the ESR.

In use, the voltage across the terminals of a disposable battery driving a load decreases until it drops too low to be useful; this is largely due to an increase in internal resistance rather than a drop in the voltage of the equivalent source.

In rechargeable lithium polymer batteries, the internal resistance is largely independent of the state of charge but increases as the battery ages due to the build up of a passivation layer on the electrodes called the &quot;solid electrolyte interphase&quot;; thus, it is a good indicator of expected life.

<text>Big Brother is the British version of the international reality television franchise &quot;Big Brother&quot; created by producer John de Mol Jr. in 1997. Broadcast yearly from 18 July 2000 to 5 November 2018, and returned on 8 October 2023, the show follows the format of other national editions, in which a group of contestants, known as &quot;housemates&quot;, live together in a specially constructed house that is isolated from the outside world. Live television cameras and personal audio microphones continuously monitor them. Throughout the competition, housemates are &quot;evicted&quot; from the house by public televoting. The last remaining housemate wins the competition and a cash prize. The series takes its name from the oppressive character known by that name in George Orwell&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

The series premiered in 2000 on Channel 4 and immediately became a ratings hit. It featured a 24-hour live feed in which fans could view inside the house at any time. &quot;Big Brother&quot; aired for eleven series on Channel 4, followed by one final special edition, &quot;Ultimate Big Brother&quot;, which ended in 2010. Channel 5 acquired the rights to the series, and relaunched it in 2011. On the day of the nineteenth series launch in 2018, Channel 5 announced that &quot;Big Brother&quot; would not be returning to the channel after the end of that series. In 2020, Channel 4 announced that previous episodes of &quot;Big Brother&quot; would be shown on E4 in a series titled &quot;Big Brother: Best Shows Ever&quot; to mark the 20th anniversary of the programme. Two years later, in August 2022, it was announced by ITV that &quot;Big Brother&quot; would return for a new series on ITV2 the following year. The show was relaunched for a second time in 2023. In November 2024, ITV announced the series would return for a third series in 2025.

The programme was initially presented by Davina McCall MBE from its inception in July 2000 until its cancellation by Channel 4 ten years later. McCall declined to return as presenter following the programme&#x27;s move to Channel 5, and the role was taken up by former series winner Brian Dowling. He remained as presenter throughout the twelfth and thirteenth series. Emma Willis later replaced Dowling from the fourteenth series onwards until its cancellation from Channel 5. On 25 April 2023, ITV announced AJ Odudu and Will Best as hosts of both the main show and a &quot;nightly spin-off&quot; show. Marcus Bentley served as the off-screen narrator of all series since the show premiered in 2000. &quot;Big Brother&quot; has had numerous spin-off series occur since its premiere, most notably &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, a shorter version of the main series wherein the cast is composed solely of celebrities. Numerous other spin-off series that are not competition based have aired, with Dermot O&#x27;Leary, Russell Brand, George Lamb, Emma Willis and Rylan Clark all presenting spin-offs.

==History==
===Main series===
====Channel 4 (2000–2010)====
The &quot;Big Brother&quot; reality series was created by John de Mol Jr. and premiered in the Netherlands. Following the success of the initial series, it was confirmed that editions for both the United Kingdom and the United States were in the works. In March 2000, it was revealed that the series would be broadcast by Channel 4 and E4; casting began shortly afterward, and Davina McCall MBE was later revealed to be the presenter. The first series premiered on 18 July 2000, and ended when housemate Craig Phillips was crowned the winner after 64 days in the House. The series proved to be a hit early in its run, leading to a second series.

&quot;Big Brother 2&quot; premiered on 25 May 2001 and continued the success of the previous series. The series concluded on 27 July 2001, when Brian Dowling was crowned the winner. The third series premiered on 24 May 2002, and was the first series to feature a live premiere. Much like the previous series, the show lasted for 64 days and saw Kate Lawler win the prize. With the third series finding even more success than its predecessors, a fourth series began on 23 May 2003. The series was one of the first to feature numerous twists throughout the series, including nominations on the first night and swapping a housemate with a housemate from the African edition of the series. The series concluded after 64 days, with Cameron Stout being crowned the winner. Despite the fourth series seeing a decrease in viewership and voting numbers, a fifth series began on 28 May 2004. The series became one of the most controversial series at the time, mainly due to events such as &quot;Fight Night&quot; and the expulsion of two housemates. The series lasted for 71 days, with Nadia Almada becoming the first transgender housemate to win the series.

Following the success of the fifth series, the sixth series began on 27 May 2005 and lasted for a total of 78 days. The series was met with much controversy surrounding housemates Anthony Hutton and Makosi Musambasi, the former of which went on to win the series. The seventh series premiered on 18 May 2006, and became the first series to feature over twenty housemates. It became the first series to last longer than 90 days. It was met with much controversy after allowing previously evicted housemate Nikki Grahame to return to the game with the chance of winning. Pete Bennett was ultimately crowned the winner of the series. The eighth series premiered on 30 May 2007 and became the longest series to date at 94 days. The series featured a set of twins in the house, who competed initially as individuals but later became one housemate. Brian Belo was crowned the winner of the series. Belo was the only black housemate to win the programme. The ninth series featured a &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; theme, and premiered on 5 June 2008. Rachel Rice was the winner of the series after spending 93 days in the house. On 4 June 2009, the tenth series premiered and saw housemates having to complete tasks in order to earn housemate status. Sophie Reade was the winner of the series, which lasted for a total of 93 days.

9 June 2010 saw the premiere of the eleventh series. It was also confirmed that 2010 would be the final year of &quot;Big Brother&quot; on Channel 4 with McCall. The series lasted for a total of 77 days, with Josie Gibson being crowned the winner. Merely minutes after &quot;BB11&quot; concluded, a special edition titled &quot;Ultimate Big Brother&quot;, featuring memorable former housemates competing for the title of &quot;Ultimate Housemate&quot;. &quot;Big Brother 2&quot; winner Brian Dowling, won the series after 18 days in the house.

====Channel 5 (2011–2018)====
After Richard Desmond bought Channel 5 in 2010, he stated that he was keen to acquire &quot;Big Brother&quot;. Meanwhile, Endemol had been granted permission to keep the &quot;Big Brother&quot; house at the Elstree TV Studios until 30 September 2013. On 2 April 2011, Channel 5 formally confirmed that they had signed a £200 million two-year contract with Endemol to screen &quot;Big Brother&quot; from 18 August 2011. &quot;Big Brother 2&quot; and Ultimate winner Brian Dowling was announced as the new presenter. McCall declined the offer to present, having said goodbye to the show in 2010. On 3 May 2011, &quot;Endemol&quot; and Channel 5 officially opened the process for people to apply to be on the show. The twelfth series officially launched on 9 September 2011. Aaron Allard-Morgan was crowned the winner after spending 64 days in the house. The thirteenth series premiered on 5 June 2012, and was won by Luke Anderson. The thirteenth series was also Dowling&#x27;s last appearance as host. 

On 2 April 2013, it was confirmed that Dowling would be replaced by Emma Willis, who had previously presented a spin-off series for the show. The fourteenth series premiered on 13 June 2013, and was won by Sam Evans. The fifteenth series launched on 5 June 2014 and was won by Helen Wood, making her the first female winner since the show&#x27;s revival on Channel 5. The sixteenth series began on 12 May 2015, the earliest Big Brother launch to date. Chloe Wilburn was announced as the winner of that series. The seventeenth series launched on 7 June 2016, it was the first Big Brother series to feature two separate houses. The winner was stunt double Jason Burrill. He was the oldest housemate to win the main series to date. The eighteenth series launched on 5 June 2017 and was won by Isabelle Warburton. She was the first woman to win &quot;Big Brother&quot; as a late entrant, and at just 38 days in the house, she has also spent the least amount of time in the house for a winner of the regular series.

On 14 September 2018, Channel 5 announced that the nineteenth series would be the last on Channel 5. Cameron Cole was the winner of the final series and the programme&#x27;s youngest. &quot;Big Brother&quot; ended on Channel 5 in November 2018. The nineteenth series was also Willis&#x27; last appearance as host.

==== ITV2 (2023–present) ====
In April 2022, it was reported that ITV Studios were in talks with Banijay, who own the rights to &quot;Big Brother&quot;, to revive the show in 2023. On 1 August 2022, ITV aired a teaser trailer during the final of the eighth series of &quot;Love Island&quot;, officially confirming that the series would return for a new series in 2023 on ITV2 and ITVX, which resulted the switch from its usual summer slot to an autumn slot instead, to avoid the scheduling clash with the rival reality show &quot;Love Island&quot;. The series was confirmed to run for &quot;up to six weeks&quot; with housemates coming from &quot;all walks of life&quot;. Eight months after the new series was announced, it was revealed that AJ Odudu and Will Best would co-host both the main show and sideshow. Odudu and Best&#x27;s appointment marked the first appearances of double hosts, instead of a single host format from the past nineteen series. The twentieth series began on 8 October 2023, and comprised 36 episodes, with the live final taking place on 17 November 2023, where Jordan Sangha was crowned the winner of the series. The twenty-first series began on 6 October 2024, once again comprising 36 episodes. The live final aired on 15 November 2024, when Ali Bromley was announced as the winner. In November 2024, ITV announced that the show had been renewed for a twenty-second series.

===Spin-offs===

Since its inception, &quot;Big Brother&quot; has seen numerous spin-offs and tie-in series launches on both Channel 4 and Channel 5. The most notable spin-off, &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, began initially as a one-time series and involved six celebrities staying in the house for eight days. Following the success of the series, &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; went on to become an annual production, much like the main series. Following widespread media attention involving racism during the fifth series, the show was not broadcast the following year. The show returned in 2009, and the final series to air on Channel 4 aired in 2010. Following the show&#x27;s move to Channel 5, &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; began airing two series per year until its cancellation alongside the regular series in September 2018. In 2023, ITV announced they were bringing it back in 2024 alongside the civilian series, but this time the main show will be on ITV1 and STV rather than ITV2.

The show has also had various other spin-off series occur since its premiere. The first spin-off, &quot;Teen Big Brother: The Experiment&quot;, premiered on 13 October 2003 and lasted ten days. The series was met with much controversy, which was later heightened when two of the cast members had sex in the house. &quot;Big Brother Panto&quot;, which aired in 2004, saw the return of ten former housemates who re-enacted their rendition of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. &quot;Ultimate Big Brother&quot; was the final series to air on Channel 4, and featured fourteen of the most memorable housemates from both the main series and &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; competing in the series. Brian Dowling became the only housemate to win a series twice after winning &quot;Ultimate Big Brother&quot;. Numerous other spin-offs have occurred throughout the series such as &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Big Mouth&quot;, presented by Russell Brand, and &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Little Brother&quot; presented by Dermot O&#x27;Leary. Following the show&#x27;s move to Channel 5, &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Bit on the Side&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; were the only spin-off series now airing.

==Format==

&quot;Big Brother&quot; is a game show in which a group of contestants, referred to as housemates, live in isolation from the outside world in a custom-built &quot;house&quot;, constantly under video surveillance. During their time in the house, the housemates are required to nominate two of their fellow contestants for potential eviction, and the two or more with the most votes would be nominated. This process is mandatory for all housemates, and failure to comply could result in expulsion from the house. During the show&#x27;s broadcast on Channel 4, the viewers would vote to evict one of the nominated housemates. The housemate with the most votes would be removed from the house. The twelfth and thirteenth series, the first two to air under Channel 5, saw the public voting to save a housemate, and the housemate with the fewest votes would be evicted. Beginning with the fourteenth series, the vote to evict format returned to the series. During the eighteenth series, both vote to save and vote to evict were used. The voting process can be done via telephone or online. When the final week arrives, the viewers vote for which of the remaining housemates should win the series, and the housemate with the most votes becomes the winner. The prize fund has varied throughout the series, ranging from £50,000 to £150,000.

During their time in the house, housemates are given weekly tasks. The housemates wager a portion of their weekly shopping budget on the task and either win double their wagered fund or lose the wagered fund depending on their performance. The housemates are required to work as a group to complete their tasks, with the format of the tasks varying based on the number of remaining housemates. Throughout the series, some housemates have been given secret tasks that must be completed individually or with a small group; failure to do so can result in the housemate being nominated or punished. Should the housemates run out of the food provided for them, an emergency ration is available to them. The housemates are forbidden from discussing nominations, and doing so could result in punishment. The format of the series is mainly seen as a social experiment, and requires housemates to interact with others who may have differing ideals, beliefs, and prejudices. Housemates are also required to make visits to the diary room during their stay in the house, where they are able to share their thoughts and feelings on their fellow housemates and the game.

==House==
For the first two series, the house was located in Bow, London, near the 3 Mills Studios. After planning permission expired in 2002, Newham London Borough Council ordered the complex to be returned to a natural habitat. The house had been located at Elstree Studios, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire since &quot;Big Brother 3&quot; in 2002. Following a break in during the second series, it was reported that security had increased to the point that the house was more secure than Buckingham Palace. The interior of the house has changed each year, reflecting a certain theme or twist in the game. The fifth series, which featured stricter rules and consequences, featured a harsh colour scheme and a claustrophobic setting. The third series featured a &quot;Rich and Poor&quot; twist, thus a row of bars was placed in the centre of the house to divide the housemates. The diary room features a different design each year, and was frequently the last room of the house to be revealed to the public. Each series has featured a garden in the house, which has included outdoor furniture, a Jacuzzi, and on some occasions other luxuries. The eighth series featured an &quot;inside out&quot; theme for the house, thus items such as the refrigerator were located in the garden.

On 2 February 2016, a planning application to Hertsmere Borough Council revealed that Endemol had applied to build a new extension to the house, which would be its biggest renovation since it was built in 2002. The documents teased a second house with another garden and a new exterior set and interview studio. The old eviction set and eye studio were both demolished following the conclusion of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 17&quot;. It was later announced on 18 March 2016 that permission had been granted with no objections. Despite the overall extension, the new outdoor set was smaller than before, holding a capacity of just 400 compared to 470 beforehand.

From &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 19&quot; in 2017 until the show&#x27;s cancellation on Channel 5 the following year, &quot;The Other House&quot; used in the seventeenth regular series was referred to as &quot;The Task Building&quot; making it the house&#x27;s third task room along with the small and large task room.

In January 2019, two months after the conclusion of the nineteenth series, work began to demolish the house at Elstree Studios. On 17 February 2019, former presenter Emma Willis posted a photo on her Instagram account showing that demolition work on the house was complete.

Following the announcement of the ITV reboot, speculation began as to where the new house would be built. In May 2023, it was confirmed that the house would be located at Garden Studios in North London and included &quot;versatile staging&quot;, as well as an &quot;in-house virtual production studio&quot;.

On 17 December 2024, ITV announced that the house would be relocated from Garden Studios to a new site in preparation for the 2025 celebrity series. The following month, it was announced that the house would be built at Titan Studios, rendering it the fourth house to be used for the series since the show&#x27;s inception.
==Broadcast==

During the premiere series, the show aired six nights a week, being every night excluding Saturday. The eviction episodes and final aired on Fridays; after series presenter McCall announced the evictee, they had two hours to pack their belongings and exit the house during a second episode airing that night. The remaining five weekly shows were highlight episodes, which lasted an hour in length; the Sunday episode featured a group of psychologists discussing the events of the house. The second series aired six nights a week during the premiere week, though was reduced to only five days afterwards, not airing on Saturday or Sunday. This series featured two eviction episodes as well, though only featured a ninety-minute gap between the two. &quot;Big Brother 3&quot; was the first series to air every night each week, and every series after that featured only thirty minutes between eviction episodes. The third series was the first in the main series to feature a live launch, with all subsequent series featuring a live launch. The series continued to air for seven nights a week until &quot;Big Brother 8&quot;, which aired every night excluding Saturday. The ninth series re-introduced the seven episodes per week format, which has been continued throughout all future series. When the series premiered, it was aired in a 4:3 aspect ratio instead of the more common 16:9 widescreen format seen by other series at the time. Beginning in 2006 with the seventh series, the show was broadcast in the 16:9 format. Following the show&#x27;s move to Channel 5, it was broadcast in HD. The series can be viewed on Demand 5, a branch of Channel 5, after it airs.

Aside from the main series, the show featured a live feed into the house where viewers could watch the housemates at any time. With the series debut in 2000, the twenty-four-hour live feed was introduced which was available at any time to viewers for free. The live feed featured an estimated ten-minute delay to comply with broadcasting standards. Beginning with the second series, the live feed became available on E4 as well. In 2009, it was confirmed that the live feeds would not return for the tenth series due to a &quot;small uptake&quot; of subscriptions in the previous year. The feeds did return the following year, though required viewers to pay a fee, for what was at the time slated to be the show&#x27;s final series. Following the show&#x27;s move to Channel 5, the live feeds have not been featured for any subsequent series. In 2013, it was announced that the live feed would return in the form of a two-hour nightly show that featured a live look into the House; the show was cancelled in June of that year, reportedly due to low ratings. Despite this, the feed was re-instated onto the official Channel 5 website for the remainder of the fourteenth series.

Numerous spin-off series have aired immediately after or shortly following the highlight and live episodes. &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Big Mouth&quot;, aired following the highlight shows. The show was initially presented by Russell Brand from 2004 to 2007, but he did not return for subsequent series which featured a different presenter weekly. &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Big Mouth&quot; did not return following the show&#x27;s move to Channel 5. Throughout the third, fourth, and fifth series&#x27; there were no weekly tasks, and the housemates instead participated in tasks during the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; weekly show. &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Big Brain&quot; also aired once per week, and featured a more psychological analysis of the series; it aired for two series, being renamed &quot;Big Brother: On the Couch&quot; for its second and final series. &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Bit on the Side&quot; was aired seven nights a week on Channel 5 and 5*, either immediately following or an hour after the nightly episode. &quot;Live from the House&quot;, which features a live feed into the house, airs immediately following the live eviction episode.
The opening theme for the series was both written and produced by Elementfour, which was a collaboration between Paul Oakenfold and Andy Gray. Following the success of the first series, the theme was released as a single on 28 August 2000. The single proved to be successful, reaching number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. The theme was also featured on the soundtrack for the first series, which was released that same year. Since the series premiered, there have been numerous remixes and changes made to the song. The original theme by Oakenfeld and Gray was used through the first five series, however was later replaced by a revamped version from the sixth series onward. The song was remixed with a Christmas theme to promote &quot;Big Brother Panto&quot; in 2004, while a carnival themed edition was made to promote the final series to air on Channel 4. The intro to each series, which featured the theme song, was often based on the twist or theme of the house for the year. Each series was promoted with a different eye logo, with the logo also representing the theme of the house. The eye logo is meant to symbolize the phrase &quot;Big Brother is watching&quot; taken from the Orwell novel. The logo for the first series was a close-up of housemate Melanie Hill&#x27;s eye, while the logos for the second through eleventh series&#x27; were created by Daniel Eatock. Design team Hello Charlie, who had previously created the series intros, created the eye logo for the twelfth and thirteenth series following the show&#x27;s move to Channel 5. The fourteenth to eighteenth series logos were created by the design studio Shop.
==Legacy==

Since its premiere, &quot;Big Brother&quot; has been the centre of much publicity, and has received much media attention. The series often receives coverage from tabloid newspapers, magazines, and online bloggers. The series has been a ratings success since it premiered, with the first eviction tally receiving 387,000 votes. The eviction episode itself received a total of 3.4 million viewers. The series continued to have successful viewership, with the third series finale reaching over 9.9 million viewers. The vote for the third series finale saw over 8.6 million viewers voting for whom should win the series. A number of books have been written about the series, including &quot;Big Brother: The Official Unseen Story&quot; by Jean Ritchie (), &quot;The Psychology of Big Brother&quot; by Dan Jones (), and &quot;Visible Thought: The New Psychology of Body Language&quot; by Geoffrey Beattie (). Narinder Kaur, who had previously appeared as a housemate in the second series, went on to release &quot;Big Brother: The Inside Story&quot; ().

Following their appearance on the series, numerous former housemates enjoyed moderate fame and success in the public eye. Most notably, &quot;Big Brother 3&quot; housemate Jade Goody went on to have a successful career in reality television and later went on to appear in the fifth edition of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;. Goody died in 2009 due to cancer. Following her appearance on the series, Goody has frequently been referred to as one of the most successful former housemates. Following the initial conclusion of the series in 2010, a special titled &quot;Jade Goody: Ultimate Housemate&quot; aired on Channel 4 in memory of Goody. Housemates such as Alison Hammond, Brian Dowling, and Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace have enjoyed considerable success appearing in television series and reality television following their appearance on &quot;Big Brother&quot;. Housemates Nadia Almada, Craig Phillips, and Nichola Holt all released music following their appearance on the series, with Phillips ultimately having the most success. Nikki Grahame, who rose to fame in the seventh series, had her own television series titled &quot;Princess Nikki&quot; that ran for six weeks on E4. She later went on to appear in numerous reality television series. Chanelle Hayes, who appeared on the eighth series, went on to release a single, work as a model, and receive her own reality television series.

The series has gone on to be spoofed and parodied by comedians such as Alan Carr, Justin Lee Collins, and Ricky Gervais. The series has been parodied and re-enacted on programs such as &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot;, an episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (&quot;Bad Wolf&quot;), and &quot;Extras&quot;. The Ben Elton novel &quot;Dead Famous&quot;, published in 2001, is a murder-mystery novel in a setting similar to that of &quot;Big Brother&quot;. In October 2008, E4 aired the horror series &quot;Dead Set&quot; which was set during a fictional series of &quot;Big Brother&quot;. The series featured numerous former housemates, as well as presenter Davina McCall in various roles throughout the series.

;Notes

* In 2002 BT Cellnet changed its name to O2, the sponsor is therefore the same as the previous series
* Although the change of the name of the sponsor, it is still the same company and the same sponsor adverts were used
* This sponsorship is only shown after 9.00pm
==Controversies and criticism==
Since its inception, &quot;Big Brother&quot; has come under fire for reports of bullying, racism, rigging, and the physical and mental strain of appearing on the series.

In October 2024, ITV edited an episode of the series to remove all images of a watermelon symbol that appeared on the shirt of contestant Ali Bromley. Watermelon, which shares the same colours as the flag of Palestine, has been used as a symbol of Palestinian solidarity since the 1960s. Writing for &quot;The Intercept&quot;, Nikita Mazurov compared the action to George Orwell&#x27;s dystopian science-fiction novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, from which the show &quot;Big Brother&quot; takes its name, arguing that the editing of the episode represented a &quot;key tenant of the novel: old media being edited and original versions destroyed, leaving no trace of any modification having taken place.&quot;

<text>The Sullivan brothers were five brothers from Waterloo, Iowa who served together on the light cruiser . They were all killed in action when &quot;Juneau&quot; served in the Naval battle of Guadalcanal, November 13, 1942. &quot;Juneau&quot; was crippled by a torpedo fired from the Japanese destroyer &quot;Amatsukaze&quot;, then finished off by a torpedo fired from Japanese submarine &quot;I-26&quot;.

On Saturday, March 17, 2018, the wreckage of the USS &quot;Juneau&quot; was discovered off the coast of the Solomon Islands by the expedition crew of RV Petrel, owned at the time by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.

== Background ==
The five brothers, the sons of Thomas (1883–1965) and Alleta Sullivan (1895–1972) of Waterloo, Iowa, were:

*George Thomas Sullivan, 27 (born December 14, 1914), Gunner&#x27;s Mate Second Class (George had been previously discharged in May 1941 as Gunner&#x27;s Mate Third Class.)
*Francis Henry &quot;Frank&quot; Sullivan, 26 (born February 18, 1916), Coxswain (Frank had been previously discharged in May 1941 as Seaman First Class.)
*Joseph Eugene &quot;Joe&quot; Sullivan, 24 (born August 28, 1918), Seaman Second Class
*Madison Abel &quot;Matt&quot; Sullivan, 23 (born November 8, 1919), Seaman Second Class
*Albert Leo &quot;Al&quot; Sullivan, 20 (born July 8, 1922), Seaman Second Class
The brothers were survived by their parents, and a sister, Genevieve (1917–1975), who served in the WAVES. She was the girlfriend of Bill Ball, whose death while serving on the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; at Pearl Harbor prompted her brothers to join the Navy to avenge him. Al was survived by his wife Katherine Mary and son Jimmy. Joe left a fiancée named Margaret Jaros, while Matt left behind a fiancée, Beatrice Imperato. Al Sullivan&#x27;s son served on board the first USS &quot;The Sullivans&quot;. His grandmother christened the first ship. The second USS &quot;The Sullivans&quot; was christened by Al&#x27;s granddaughter Kelly Ann Sullivan Loughren.

==Military service==
The Sullivans enlisted in the US Navy on January 3, 1942, with the stipulation that they serve together. In mid-1942, the Navy promulgated a policy of separating siblings, but this was not strictly enforced. George and Frank had served in the Navy before, but their brothers had not. All five were assigned to the light cruiser .

The Sullivans were not the only brother sailors on board the ship. At least thirty sets of brothers served on the &quot;Juneau&quot;, including the two Rogers brothers from Bridgeport, Connecticut. Before the ill-fated Savo Island operation, two of the Rogers brothers were transferred to other commands. According to those who survived, had the ship returned to port safely, at least two Sullivans would have also transferred.

&quot;Juneau&quot; participated in a number of naval engagements during the months-long Guadalcanal Campaign beginning in August 1942. Early in the morning of November 13, 1942, during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, &quot;Juneau&quot; exchanged fire with the destroyer &quot;Yūdachi&quot; but failed to make any hits. However, the cruiser became the focus of the destroyer &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; (which had just sunk the destroyer USS &quot;Barton&quot;) which proceeded to fire a spread of four torpedoes. One of these torpedoes made their mark on &quot;Juneau&quot;, cutting the speed to 13 knots, breaking the keel, and disabling electrical power. The crippled &quot;Juneau&quot; was forced to withdraw from the battle.

Later that day, as it was leaving the Solomon Islands&#x27; area for the Allied rear-area base at Espiritu Santo with other surviving US warships from battle, the force was located by the submarine &quot;I-26&quot;, which fired two torpedoes at the crippled heavy cruiser USS &quot;San Francisco&quot;. While they both missed their intended target, one hit &quot;Juneau&quot;. The torpedo likely hit the thinly armored light cruiser at or near the ammunition magazines, and the ship was blown in half and quickly sank in a fiery explosion.

Captain Gilbert C. Hoover, commanding officer of the light cruiser , and the senior officer present afloat (SOPA) of the battle-damaged US task force, was skeptical that anyone had survived the sinking of &quot;Juneau&quot; and believed it would be reckless to look for survivors, thereby exposing his wounded ships to a still-lurking Japanese submarine. Therefore, he ordered his ships to continue on towards Espiritu Santo. &quot;Helena&quot; signaled a nearby US B-17 bomber on patrol to notify Allied headquarters to send aircraft or ships to search for survivors.

In actual fact, approximately 100 of &quot;Juneau&quot;″s crew had survived the torpedo attack and the sinking of their ship and were left in the water. The B-17 bomber crew, under orders not to break radio silence, did not pass the message about searching for survivors to their headquarters until they had landed several hours later. The crew&#x27;s report of the location of possible survivors was mixed in with other pending paperwork actions and went unnoticed for several days. It was not until days after the ship had been sunk that headquarters staff realized that a rescue operation had never been mounted, and belatedly ordered aircraft to begin searching the area. In the meantime, &quot;Juneau&quot;″s survivors, many of whom were seriously wounded, were exposed to the elements, hunger, thirst, and repeated shark attacks.

Eight days after the sinking, ten survivors were found by a PBY Catalina search aircraft and retrieved from the water. The survivors reported that Frank, Joe and Matt were all killed instantly, Al drowned the next day, and George survived for four or five days, before suffering from delirium as a result of hypernatremia (though some sources describe him being &quot;driven insane with grief&quot; at the loss of his brothers); he climbed over the side of the raft he had occupied and fell into the water. He was never seen or heard from again.

Security required that the Navy not reveal the loss of &quot;Juneau&quot; or the other ships so as not to provide information to the enemy. Letters from the Sullivan sons stopped arriving at home and their parents grew worried, which prompted Alleta Sullivan to write to the Bureau of Naval Personnel in January 1943, citing rumors that survivors of the task force claimed that all five brothers were killed in action.

This letter was answered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on January 13, 1943, who acknowledged that the Sullivans were missing in action, but by then the parents were already informed of their fate, having learned of their deaths on January 12. That morning, the boys&#x27; father, Tom, was preparing for work when three men in uniform – a lieutenant commander, a doctor and a chief petty officer – approached his door. &quot;I have some news for you about your boys,&quot; the naval officer said. &quot;Which one?&quot; asked Tom. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry,&quot; the officer replied. &quot;All five.&quot;

The &quot;Fighting Sullivan Brothers&quot; became national heroes. President Roosevelt sent a letter of condolence to their parents. Pope Pius XII sent a silver religious medal and rosary with his message of regret. The Iowa Senate and House adopted a formal resolution of tribute to the Sullivan brothers.

== Memorials ==
The Sullivan Brothers have a Department of Defense Dependents Schools elementary school in Yokosuka, Japan, named in their honor. A museum wing has been built in honor of their service in World War II. The museum is located in downtown Waterloo, Iowa, their hometown. It was completed in 2008. The opening occurred on November 15, 2008.The brothers&#x27; hometown of Waterloo, Iowa, renamed its convention center in 1988 as &quot;The Five Sullivan Brothers Convention Center&quot;. In June 2017, the city was considering a proposal to sell the center to a developer who would renovate the facility and change its name. The proposal met with some community opposition. The town also named a street and a public park in their honor. The park is the location of their childhood home.

==Legacy==

Tom and Alleta Sullivan made speaking appearances at war plants and shipyards on behalf of the war effort. Later, Alleta participated in the launching of a destroyer, , named after her sons. Thomas and Alleta Sullivan toured the country promoting war bonds and asked that none of their sons died in vain. As a direct result of the Sullivans&#x27; deaths (and the deaths of four of the Borgstrom brothers within a few months of each other two years later), the U.S. War Department adopted the Sole Survivor Policy.

The Navy named two destroyers &quot;The Sullivans&quot; to honor the brothers: and . DD-537 was the first American Navy ship ever named after more than one person. The motto for both ships was/is &quot;We stick together.&quot;

The Sullivans Association, an organization of veterans who served on both US Navy ships named after the brothers, conducted a reunion on September 25, 2011, in Waterloo, Iowa. The attendees gathered at Sullivans Park, visited Calvary Cemetery and laid flowers at the graves of the Sullivan brothers&#x27; parents and sister, and visited the neighborhood where the family had lived.

== Depiction in media ==
The brothers&#x27; story was filmed as the 1944 movie &quot;The Sullivans&quot; (later renamed &quot;The Fighting Sullivans&quot;) and inspired, at least in part, the 1998 film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. The Sullivans were also briefly mentioned in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. The song &quot;Sullivan&quot; by the alternative rock band Caroline&#x27;s Spine tells the story of the Sullivans.

<doc id="861195" wikidata="Q3469115" url="?curid=861195" title="The Tomb of the Cybermen">
<text>The Tomb of the Cybermen is the first serial of the fifth season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was originally broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 2 to 23 September 1967.

In the serial, the time traveller the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) and his travelling companions Jamie McCrimmon (Frazer Hines) and Victoria Waterfield (Deborah Watling) get caught up in an expedition to the planet Telos. The financiers of the expedition, Eric Klieg (George Pastell) and Kaftan (Shirley Cooklin), intend to revitalise the Cybermen that are buried on Telos in underground tombs, hoping they will share their power.

&quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; is the earliest serial known to exist in its entirety starring Troughton as the Second Doctor. It is also the only known complete Cyberman story produced in the 1960s, and introduces the concepts of the Cyber Controller and the Cybermats, both of which would be re-used in later Cyberman stories.

==Plot==
Landing on the planet Telos, the Doctor, Jamie, and Victoria meet Parry, the leader of an archeological expedition. Funded by Kaftan, who is accompanied by her colleague Klieg and her servant Toberman, the group have found and seek to explore the tomb of the Cybermen, who died out five centuries before. The Doctor helps open the tomb&#x27;s electrified doors and stays behind with Parry and Klieg to open the crypt while the others explore the building.

After another crewman is killed by a cybergun-testing machine, Parry decides to call off the expedition, only to be informed that someone has sabotaged the rocket ship, stranding them until repairs are completed. The crew open and enter the crypt; leaving Kaftan and Victoria behind, they find a small army of frozen Cybermen. Kaftan and Klieg betray the group and revive the Cybermen, who they hope to recruit for a conquest of the universe. However, the Cybermen seize the crew, intending to rebuild their invasion force and conquer Earth. The repair crew mount a rescue and recover most of the party, but Toberman is recaptured and partially converted. The group disarm and imprison Kaftan and Klieg, only for them to repair the cybergun, hoping to force the Cybermen into their alliance.

With their energy levels running low, the Cybermen return to the crypt whilst their Controller and Toberman meet with the group. The Doctor attempts to sabotage the Controller&#x27;s revitalization, but it escapes and attacks the group. After it murders Kaftan, Toberman breaks free of the Cybermen&#x27;s conditioning and disables it. While he, the Doctor, and Jamie return to refreeze the crypt, Klieg, unable to accept that the Cybermen will not forge an alliance, tries to stop them, only to be murdered by a Cyberman. After Toberman destroys it, the Doctor activates the crypt, hoping that the Cybermen will stay there for good.

The Doctor resets the tomb&#x27;s defenses to ensure the Cybermen will not be revived again, only to discover the Controller is still functional. The Doctor flees and tries to enclose it with the survivors&#x27; help, but they are overpowered. Toberman sacrifices himself to close the doors, completing the circuit and electrocuting both him and the Controller. With the rocket repaired, the expedition leaves, the Doctor and his companions bidding them goodbye. As they leave, they fail to spot a surviving Cybermat, which approaches Toberman&#x27;s body.

==Production==

===Writing===
Peter Bryant, who had previously been assistant to Gerry Davis and been newly promoted to script editor on the preceding story, was allowed to produce this serial in order to prove that he could take over from Innes Lloyd as producer later on in the season. Bryant&#x27;s own assistant, Victor Pemberton, acted as script editor on this serial, but left the series after production of the serial was finished, deciding that he didn&#x27;t want to be a script editor. When Bryant&#x27;s eventual promotion to producer came, Derrick Sherwin became script editor. The working titles for this story were &quot;The Ice Tombs of Telos&quot; and &quot;The Cybermen Planet&quot;.

Toberman was originally intended to be deaf, hence his lack of significant speech; his hearing aid would foreshadow his transformation into a Cyberman.

===Recording===
It was produced at the end of the fourth recording block but was deliberately held back to season 5, despite the fact a &#x27;Next Week&#x27; caption was prepared for the final episode of &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot;, suggesting it was originally intended to end the fourth season.

The exterior scenes for Telos were recorded at Gerrards Cross Sand and Gravel Quarry.

The Cybermats were controlled by various means – by wires, by wind-up clockwork, by radio-control, and some by simply being shoved into the shot. When the team were not filming, it was known for the people controlling the radio-controlled Cybermats to chase Deborah Watling around on set. The scene of the Cybermen breaking out of their tombs was filmed entirely in one take.

In the scene where the group are at the main entrance of the tomb, Patrick Troughton and Frazer Hines worked out in secret the brief sequence where both the Doctor and Jamie go to take Victoria by the hand and end up taking each others. They knew that, with the recording schedule and the likelihood that re-takes would not be possible, it would have to be left in.

==Broadcast, archive and reception==

On 24 February 2013, the episode aired in the United States on BBC America as part of a year-long celebration and acknowledgement of the 50th anniversary of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Prior to the episode&#x27;s airing that evening, a short documentary was aired which featured interviews with former, current and original Doctor Who production staff who shared their memories and perspectives of Patrick Troughton. It also appeared on Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s iView exclusively, part of their celebration for Doctor Who&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

===Reception===
Following the transmission of the first episode, the BBC&#x27;s Head of Drama Sydney Newman personally congratulated Peter Bryant on what he had seen, which Bryant later recalled: &quot;Coming from the man who created &quot;Doctor Who&quot; that was the ultimate compliment, even more so seeing as it was my first job as producer.&quot; However, the serial also attracted controversy. On 26 September 1967, Kit Pedler appeared on the BBC series &quot;Talkback&quot;, hosted by David Coleman, to defend the serial against parents who thought it was too violent.

Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote favourably of the serial in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), despite some criticism, &quot;The first two episodes are wonderful, a well directed and expensive looking restating of the series&#x27; basics, but once the Cybermen are released from the Tombs, they go back in again.&quot; In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker stated that it was similar to previous Cybermen stories, but &quot;manages to develop the idea to greater advantage and, as a result, achieves a considerable success&quot; and was &quot;well-paced, gripping and, in places, genuinely frightening&quot;. They praised the Cybermen, but said the noise they made while being attacked was &quot;silly&quot;, and also criticised some of the direction and Deborah Watling&#x27;s Victoria, who they felt was an inconsistent character.

In 2009, Mark Braxton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; wrote that the story &quot;&quot;does&quot; deserve its reputation&quot; as a classic. DVD Talk&#x27;s J. Doyle Wallis, in a review of the original DVD release, gave the serial three and a half out of five stars and called it &quot;a very entertaining story&quot;. In a review of the special edition DVD for the same website, John Sinnott gave &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; four stars. Sinnot praised Troughton&#x27;s performance and the subtlety of the guest acting. Reviewing the serial for &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2012, Neela Debnath praised the &quot;impressive production values&quot; and faster pace. Christopher Bahn of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; was less positive. He said that the story&#x27;s &quot;flaws are awfully apparent today&quot; due to the &quot;huge gaps in story logic and some really unfortunate racial stereotyping&quot;. Bahn was positive towards Troughton and the plot&#x27;s buildup, but felt that the rest &quot;just kind of peters out&quot; and the villains&#x27; motivations were &quot;convoluted&quot;.

In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the cliffhanger to the second episode – in which the Cybermen break out of their tombs – as one of the greatest cliffhangers in the history of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

===Archive===
When the BBC&#x27;s film archive was first properly audited in 1978, it was one of many believed missing having been missed in an earlier 1976 listing. It was prepared for release in early 1992 on audio cassette as part of the &quot;Missing Stories&quot; collection, using recordings made by fans at home at the time of transmission, with newly recorded explanatory narration by Jon Pertwee. Then in late 1991, telerecordings of all four episodes were returned to the BBC from the Hong Kong-based Rediffusion company. In May 1992, it was released on VHS with a special introduction from director Morris Barry. The VHS release topped the sales charts throughout the country. This was the only &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story from the original era to top the UK charts.
Between 1991 and 2013, it was believed to be the only complete story from Season 5 (and the only complete serial to feature Deborah Watling) before the complete run of &quot;The Enemy of the World&quot; was returned from Nigeria in 2013.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

Gerry Davis novelisation was published by Target Books in 1978, entitled &quot;Doctor Who and The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot;. However, due to a lack of source material, the cover, by Jeff Cummins, featured a Cyberman from the later story &quot;The Invasion&quot;. A reissue of the book featured a new - and correct - cover by Alister Pearson. An audio reading of the novelisation, read by Michael Kilgarriff, was released in March 2013.

A transcript of the transmitted version of the serial, edited by John McElroy, was published by Titan Books in August 1989. It was the second in that publisher&#x27;s series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; script books, following &quot;The Tribe of Gum&quot;. There was no video copy of &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; in the BBC archives at the time that the book was prepared.

===Home media===

With the recovery of the film prints, the planned soundtrack release was delayed until 1993, when contractual obligations forced its release. See List of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio releases.

Following the 1993 cassette release, on 1 May 2006 the soundtrack was released on a 2-CD set with linking narration by and a bonus interview with Frazer Hines. This was the first existing story to be released on audio in the same format as the missing story range.

A vinyl release of the soundtrack was released in 2018 exclusively for Record Store Day.

In the UK the DVD was released 13 January 2002. This was the first black and white story to be released on this format. This serial was also released as part of the &quot;Doctor Who DVD Files&quot; in issue 73 on 19 October 2011. A special edition of the DVD, with new bonus features and the entire story now treated with the VidFIRE process was released in the UK on 13 February 2012 in the third of the &quot;Revisitations&quot; DVD box sets.

In 2013 it was released on DVD again as part of the &quot;Doctor Who: The Doctors Revisited 1–4&quot; box set, alongside &quot;The Aztecs&quot;, &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; and &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot;. Alongside a documentary on the Second Doctor, the disc features the serial put together as a single feature in widescreen format with an introduction from former show runner Steven Moffat, as well as its original version. It was then released again (the same VidFIRE restored version), included in a set paired with &quot;Rise of the Cybermen&quot; and &quot;The Age of Steel&quot; (a two-part Tenth Doctor David Tennant story from 2006), in 2013&#x27;s &quot;The Monster Collection&quot; series, specifically &quot;The Cybermen&quot; entry.

===Music release===
Stock music and sound effects from this story was released on a &quot;mini-album&quot; by Via Satellite in 1997. It had 2 versions of the Doctor Who theme music, sound effects from &quot;Doctor Who: 30 Years at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop,&quot; and an incomplete selection of stock music used in the story. It was planned to be the first in a series of mini-albums, with &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot; and &quot;Inside the Spaceship&quot; being mooted as future albums. Neither was produced.

Library tracks used in &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; but missing from this CD include &quot;Univers Sidéral&quot; by Paul Bonneau, assorted &quot;Synchro-Stings&quot; by Trevor Duncan, &quot;Sting Tintabuloid 1&quot; by Desmond Leslie, &quot;Eerie Vaults&quot; by Steve Race, &quot;Suspended Animation&quot;, &quot;Galaxy&quot; and &quot;Hypnosis&quot; by Eric Siday, &quot;Dramatic Brass Chords&quot; by Wolf Droysen, and from Frank Talley&#x27;s &quot;Off Center Suite&quot;: &quot;Dark Pursuit&quot;, &quot;Off Center&quot; and &quot;Panic in the Streets&quot;.

Although the CD inlay lists only 11 tracks, the actual disc contains 12. This was caused by the &quot;Astronautics Suite&quot; being divided into two tracks. The table below details the actual tracks as they appear on the CD rather than as listed on the inlay.

<text>Dwight Phillips (born October 1, 1977) is an American former athlete and a four-time world champion in the long jump. He was the 2004 Olympic champion in the event. His personal best of 8.74 meters, set in 2009, makes him the joint fifth best jumper of all time.

Phillips has also competed in the 60 and 100-meter dashes. His personal record for the 100 m is 10.06 seconds and his time of 6.47 seconds over 60 m ranks among the top twenty fastest ever.

He is a now a track and field ambassador at SPIRE Institute and Academy. He will be joining the others such as Elizabeth Beisel and Caeleb Dressel representing the school. The goal of the partnership with SPIRE and the ambassadors is to emphasize the development of peak performance in athletics, academics, character and life.

==Career==
Phillips was a promising sprinter in his early days, but concentrated on the triple jump while at University of Kentucky, before switching to the long jump after moving to Arizona State University in 2000. He competed at 2000 Sydney Olympics and finished eighth in the long jump with a jump of 8.06 m. He was the best American performer in the event. At his first World Championships he again finished eighth, after sustaining a hamstring tear.

He came to prominence in 2003, when he won both the IAAF indoor and outdoor World Championships. The indoor championship event was a close contest, with Phillips only beating Spain&#x27;s Yago Lamela by a centimeter. He won the outdoor title with a winning margin of four centimeters over James Beckford of Jamaica.

In the run up to the 2004 Athens Olympics, Phillips was ranked number one in the world, and he won the gold medal by a margin of 12 cm over his compatriot John Moffitt. His winning jump of 8.59 meters was the fourth biggest in Olympic history, after Bob Beamon (1968) and Carl Lewis (1988, 1992).

His success continued at the next two World Championships, taking the gold medal at the 2005 Helsinki event, and winning bronze in Osaka two years later.

Phillips finished fourth in the long jump at the U.S. Olympic Trials, meaning he would not compete at the Beijing Olympics and would not defend his Olympic title.

On June 7, 2009, Phillips won the long jump at the Prefontaine Classic with a personal-best third jump of 8.74 m, defeating 2008 Olympic gold medalist Irving Saladino. A jump that put Phillips in the all-time performers top 10, despite a 1.2 metres/second headwind. He won the US Championships later that month, giving him another chance to reach the podium at the World Championships.

At the 2009 World Athletics Championships, in Berlin, Phillips won the gold in the long jump with a jump of 8.54 m. He repeated the feat in Daegu in 2011 with a leap of 8.45 m. During the championships in Daegu, Phillips was assigned the bib number 1111. After winning, Phillips proudly pointed to the number appropriate for finishing first in four championships.

A car accident just before the start of the 2012 outdoor season left him with back and neck injuries. Further to this, an Achilles tendon injury recurred and instead of preparing for the 2012 London Olympics, Phillips opted to undergo surgery to prolong his career.

At the 2013 World Athletics Championships, in Moscow, Phillips placed 11th in the long jump with a jump of 7.88 m and announced this was his last competition and retirement.

In 2018, Phillips was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.

In September 2020, SPIRE Institute and Academy signed Phillips to become an international track and field ambassador.

==Personal life==
Phillips is currently CEO and partner at Epiq.tv.Phillips is also the founder of The winners circles.

<doc id="861203" wikidata="Q1132765" url="?curid=861203" title="Mazzy Star">
<text>Mazzy Star is an American alternative rock band formed in 1988 in Santa Monica, California, from remnants of the group Opal. Founding member David Roback&#x27;s friend Hope Sandoval became the group&#x27;s vocalist when Kendra Smith left Opal. The band&#x27;s current lineup consists of Sandoval (lead vocals, guitars, percussion), Colm Ó Cíosóig (guitars, bass, keyboards, drums), Suki Ewers (keyboards), and Josh Yenne (pedal steel guitars, guitars, drums).

Mazzy Star is best known for the song &quot;Fade into You&quot;, which brought the band some success in the mid-1990s and was the group&#x27;s biggest mainstream hit, earning extensive exposure on MTV, VH1, and radio airplay. Roback and Sandoval were the creative center of the band, with Sandoval as lyricist and Roback as composer of the majority of the band&#x27;s material until his death in Los Angeles on February 24, 2020, from cancer. Mazzy Star&#x27;s founding drummer Keith Mitchell, originally part of Opal, died on May 14, 2017, also from cancer. The EP &quot;Still&quot; released on June 1, 2018, was dedicated to Keith Mitchell and stage manager Tom Cashen who also died in 2017. Following Roback&#x27;s death in 2020, Sandoval and Ewers are the last surviving members of the band&#x27;s original lineup.

The band released the album &quot;She Hangs Brightly&quot; in 1990, &quot;So Tonight That I Might See&quot; in 1993 (the album went platinum in 1995), and &quot;Among My Swan&quot; in 1996.

The band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Seasons of Your Day&quot;, was released in 2013, followed by the EP &quot;Still&quot; in 2018.

==History==

===Opal and Paisley Underground (1981–1987)===
Mazzy Star has deep roots within the Californian Paisley Underground movement of the early 1980s. David Roback, along with his brother Steven, was one of the main architects of leading Los Angeles psychedelic revival band the Rain Parade. Leaving that band after their first LP, he founded Clay Allison in 1983 with then-girlfriend, ex-Dream Syndicate bassist Kendra Smith. Soon after the publication of their sole release, the 1983 double A-sided single &quot;Fell From the Sun&quot;/&quot;All Souls&quot;, Clay Allison renamed themselves Opal and released the LP &quot;Happy Nightmare Baby&quot; on SST on December 14, 1987. With Roback as its musical catalyst, Opal were a direct precursor to Mazzy Star musically—often featuring the same psychedelic guitar drones and similar hints of blues and folk that would later appear on Mazzy Star recordings. Meanwhile, Sandoval—who was in high school at the time—formed the folk music duo Going Home in the early 1980s with fellow student Sylvia Gomez, and played gigs with Sonic Youth and Minutemen. Both were devoted followers of the Rain Parade, and after a 1983 concert by the band in the Los Angeles area, Gomez entered the backstage area of the venue and gave Roback a copy of Going Home&#x27;s demo tape, featuring Sandoval on vocals and Gomez on guitar. Upon hearing the tape, Roback offered to produce a still-unreleased album by the pair.

When Smith left Opal under cloudy circumstances in the middle of a tour supporting the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, Sandoval was chosen as her replacement.

===Formation and Rough Trade (1988–1990)===

Despite Smith&#x27;s departure, Rough Trade retained Roback&#x27;s original record deal, contractually obligating him to supply a follow-up to Opal&#x27;s debut LP. As a result, Roback and Sandoval continued to tour under the Opal alias for the next two years, during which time they completed production on Opal&#x27;s planned second album, titled &quot;Ghost Highway&quot;. Composed mainly of songs written by Roback and Smith, Sandoval stated that she was unhappy with the material, and expressed an interest in wanting to &quot;start something completely new&quot;. The pair quickly composed and recorded seven new tracks in Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco, and renamed the band Mazzy Star. Written over a year before Mazzy Star&#x27;s inception, the track &quot;Ghost Highway&quot; is the band&#x27;s only original song to not feature a writing credit from Sandoval, while another song, &quot;Give You My Lovin, was written by Going Home guitarist Sylvia Gomez and first recorded by Sandoval and Gomez in the mid-1980s.

&quot;She Hangs Brightly&quot; was released in May 1990 on Rough Trade and, although it was not an immediate commercial success, the album established the duo as a recurrent fixture on alternative rock radio, with lead single &quot;Blue Flower&quot; – a cover of the Slapp Happy track – peaking at No. 29 on Billboard&#x27;s Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album would go on to sell over 70,000 copies in the UK.

===Capitol (1990–1997)===

The American branch of Rough Trade folded in late 1990, briefly leaving Mazzy Star without a record label. Within weeks, the duo&#x27;s contract was picked up by Capitol, who re-released &quot;She Hangs Brightly&quot; on November 4, 1990, and released their follow-up, &quot;So Tonight That I Might See&quot; on September 27, 1993. A year after its release, the album yielded an unexpected hit single. &quot;Fade into You&quot; peaked at No. 44 to become their first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 single, while also reaching a career-high peak of No. 3 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. On April 19, 1995, the album was certified platinum by the RIAA for shipments in excess of 1 million units. The album also peaked at No. 68 in the UK, and was certified silver by the BPI in 2021, for sales of over 100,000 copies. Following the success of &quot;Fade into You&quot;, &quot;She Hangs Brightly&quot; album opener &quot;Halah&quot; began to receive heavy airplay in the US and peaked at No. 19 on Billboard&#x27;s Modern Rock Tracks chart, a chart based solely on airplay.
Their final album for Capitol, &quot;Among My Swan&quot;, was released on October 29, 1996. Entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 68 and, as of September 2001, selling 214,000 copies in the United States, the album was less commercially successful than its predecessors, although it produced their highest-peaking single in the United Kingdom, when &quot;Flowers in December&quot; entered at No. 40 to become their only top forty entry on the chart. The band promoted the album with a five-month tour of the US and Europe, after which Sandoval and Roback began work on new material. Over the course of these sessions, Sandoval reportedly &quot;begged&quot; Capitol to be released from her contract, later elaborating, &quot;It seemed record companies wanted bands to be creative because they didn&#x27;t know how to manufacture underground music. We could do our own thing and go at our own pace. But that changed when major labels started wanting bands that would sell 7 million records. They had a formula. And suddenly all these people wanted to come to the studio to keep track of what we were doing and make sure we were following that formula. So we got out.&quot;

===Hiatus, reunion, and subsequent work (1997–2009)===
In the immediate aftermath of Mazzy Star&#x27;s dissolution, Sandoval, who had appeared on the Jesus and Mary Chain&#x27;s 1994 release &quot;Stoned &amp; Dethroned&quot;, made another guest appearance on their album &quot;Munki&quot;, and also collaborated with the Chemical Brothers, while Roback produced and mixed two songs found on Beth Orton&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Central Reservation&quot;.

In June 2000, the band reunited for a mini-tour of Europe. Performing up to seven new songs at each of these concerts, Sandoval revealed in interviews around this time that these new songs were written and recorded for Mazzy Star&#x27;s fourth studio album, which was to be released independently sometime in the future. This did not materialize, however, as later that year, Sandoval joined with Colm Ó Cíosóig (formerly of My Bloody Valentine) to form Hope Sandoval &amp; the Warm Inventions. In October 2000, Sandoval issued her first EP with the Warm Inventions, &quot;At the Doorway Again&quot;, and followed it up with her debut full-length album, &quot;Bavarian Fruit Bread&quot;, a year later. Around this time, Sandoval also contributed vocals to several songs by other artists, notably Air and Death in Vegas.

William Cooper, Mazzy Star&#x27;s violinist and keyboardist, died of neuroendocrine cancer on March 16, 2001.

Sandoval performed as part of Bert Jansch&#x27;s 60th birthday celebration at Queen Elizabeth Hall on November 3, 2003. As well as Ó Cíosóig, Jansch and his son Adam, she was also joined on stage by David Roback for renditions of &quot;Suzanne&quot; and &quot;All This Remains&quot;, a song Sandoval had contributed lead vocals and wrote lyrics to for Jansch&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Edge of a Dream&quot;. This would remain Sandoval and Roback&#x27;s final appearance together on-stage until 2012.

David Roback made his debut appearance as an actor in the 2004 film &quot;Clean&quot;. He also wrote and produced three songs that were performed in the film by actress Maggie Cheung.
In 2009, &quot;So Tonight That I Might See&quot; album track &quot;Into Dust&quot; debuted at No. 71 and stayed one week on the U.K. singles chart when it featured on a commercial for Virgin Media. Two years later, the song appeared on the &quot;Dust to Dust&quot; trailer for Gears of War 3 and spent a further four weeks on the chart, reaching a new peak of No. 47; while it also became the band&#x27;s first song to ever place on the Irish Singles Chart, where it peaked at No. 40.

Sandoval&#x27;s second album with the Warm Inventions, &quot;Through the Devil Softly&quot;, was released via Nettwerk on September 29, 2009, and was followed on August 10, 2010, by a non-album single, a cover of Syd Barrett&#x27;s &quot;Golden Hair&quot;. Also released in 2010 was her vocal contribution to Massive Attack&#x27;s &quot;Heligoland&quot;, &quot;Paradise Circus&quot;. The song spent one week on the U.K. singles chart at No. 117.

===Reformation and &quot;Seasons of Your Day&quot; (2010–2014)===

The first substantive confirmation that the duo would reconvene to complete work on their fourth studio album came from Sandoval herself in a July 2009 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, where she was quoted as saying, &quot;It&#x27;s true we&#x27;re still together. We&#x27;re almost finished [with the record]. But I have no idea what that means.&quot; Later, in a September 2009 interview with Vancouver-based music website &quot;Straight.com&quot;, interviewer John Lucas wrote of the 8-year gap between &quot;Bavarian Fruit Bread&quot; and &quot;Through the Devil Softly&quot;, &quot;That seems like a long time until you consider that Mazzy Star, Sandoval&#x27;s partnership with guitarist David Roback, hasn&#x27;t put an album out since 1996. Sandoval promises that will change; she and Roback have their very own &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; in the works, but it won&#x27;t see the light of day until the Warm Inventions have wrapped up their tour.&quot;

On October 12, 2011, Hope Sandoval&#x27;s official website confirmed the duo would release their first new material in 15 years later that same month. The double a-sided single &quot;Common Burn&quot;/&quot;Lay Myself Down&quot; was released digitally on October 31, 2011. A limited edition blue-coloured 7-inch vinyl was also announced for release on November 8, though a manufacturing delay resulted in its release being pushed back to January 24, 2012. Their fourth studio album was expected to be released in the latter half of 2012, following completion of a tour earlier in the year.

The band completed an 18-date Californian and European tour in 2012, their first since 2000. Performing at several major European festivals, the band consisted of original members Suki Ewers and Keith Mitchell, and were also joined by Sandoval&#x27;s Warm Inventions band-mate Colm Ó Cíosóig and Keith Mitchell&#x27;s son Paul, whose band the Brook Lee Catastrophe also served as the opening act of select shows. Pedal steel guitar was performed by Josh Yenne. After the final date of the tour in August 2012, David Roback stated that production on the album had completed and that it would see release &quot;soon&quot;. In late 2012, several unreleased song titles composed by Hope Sandoval and David Roback were registered with the band&#x27;s long-time publisher BMI, including &quot;Flying Low&quot; and &quot;Spoon&quot;, both of which were performed multiple times on the tour. The band also launched an official merchandise store.

On July 13, 2013, the band announced details of their fourth studio album, &quot;Seasons of Your Day&quot;, which was released on September 23, 2013, in the UK, followed a day later on September 24 in the US. The album reached a career-high No. 24 on the UK albums chart. The band began a North American tour on November 3, 2013, in support of the album. On April 19, the band released two new songs as part of Record Store Day 2014. &quot;I&#x27;m Less Here&quot; and &quot;Things&quot; were released on 7-inch vinyl, with the run limited to 3,000 copies worldwide.

===Renewed solo activity (2016–2017)===
Hope Sandoval and the Warm Inventions released a 7-inch vinyl single titled &quot;Isn&#x27;t It True&quot; for Record Store Day 2016. The track also features Jim Putnam of Radar Bros. A music video for the song was released on April 19, and is dedicated to Richie Lee of Acetone. The Warm Inventions&#x27; third studio album, &quot;Until the Hunter&quot;, was released on November 4 through the band&#x27;s own independent record label, Tendril Tales. A second single from the album, &quot;Let Me Get There&quot; featuring Kurt Vile, was released on September 23. A new four-song EP from the Warm Inventions, &quot;Son of a Lady&quot;, was released on September 15, 2017.

Sandoval contributed vocals to &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mind&quot; by Psychic Ills, which was released on March 29, 2016. Four months later, Massive Attack released &quot;The Spoils&quot;, which was her third collaboration with the band, following &quot;Paradise Circus&quot; and &quot;Four Walls&quot;. A music video starring actress Cate Blanchett was released on August 9.

Keith Mitchell, who played drums on all four Mazzy Star albums, died on May 14, 2017.

===Since 2018===
In June 2018, the band reunited for their first concerts in five years, performing on three consecutive nights at the Sydney Opera House as part of Vivid Live. That same month, they released the EP &quot;Still&quot;.

David Roback died on February 24, 2020, of cancer.

Since 2020, the band has largely been on hiatus, with each member pursuing solo projects.

<doc id="861211" wikidata="Q2712755" url="?curid=861211" title="History of IBM magnetic disk drives">
<text>IBM manufactured magnetic disk storage devices from 1956 to 2003, when it sold its hard disk drive business to Hitachi. Both the hard disk drive (HDD) and floppy disk drive (FDD) were invented by IBM and as such IBM&#x27;s employees were responsible for many of the innovations in these products and their technologies. The basic mechanical arrangement of hard disk drives has not changed since the IBM 1301. Disk drive performance and characteristics are measured by the same standards now as they were in the 1950s. Few products in history have enjoyed such spectacular declines in cost and physical size along with equally dramatic improvements in capacity and performance.

IBM manufactured 8-inch floppy disk drives from 1969 until the mid-1980s, but did not become a significant manufacturer of smaller-sized, 5.25- or 3.5-inch floppy disk drives (the dimension refers to the diameter of the floppy disk, not the size of the drive). IBM always offered its magnetic disk drives for sale but did not offer them with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) terms until 1981. By 1996, IBM had stopped making hard disk drives unique to its systems and was offering all its HDDs as an OEM.

IBM uses many terms to describe its various magnetic disk drives, such as direct-access storage device (DASD), disk file and diskette file. Here, the current industry standard terms, &quot;hard disk drive&quot; (HDD) and &quot;floppy disk drive&quot; (FDD), are used.

==Early IBM HDDs==
===IBM 350===

The IBM 350 disk storage unit, the first disk drive, was announced by IBM as a component of the IBM 305 RAMAC computer system on September 14, 1956. Simultaneously a very similar product, the IBM 355, was announced for the IBM 650 RAMAC computer system. RAMAC stood for &quot;Random Access Method of Accounting and Control&quot;. The first engineering prototype 350 disk storage shipped to Zellerbach Paper Company, San Francisco, in June 1956, with production shipment beginning in November 1957 with the shipment of a unit to United Airlines in Denver, Colorado.

Its design was motivated by the need for real time accounting in business. The 350 stores 5 million 6-bit characters (3.75 MB). It has fifty-two diameter disks of which 100 recording surfaces are used, omitting the top surface of the top disk and the bottom surface of the bottom disk. Each surface has 100 tracks. The disks spin at 1200 rpm. Data transfer rate is 8,800 characters per second. An access mechanism moves a pair of heads up and down to select a disk pair (one down surface and one up surface) and in and out to select a recording track of a surface pair. Several improved models were added in the 1950s. The IBM RAMAC 305 system with 350 disk storage leased for $3,200 per month. The 350 was officially withdrawn in 1969.

 from the RAMAC program is generally considered to be the fundamental patent for disk drives. This first-ever disk drive was initially cancelled by the IBM Board of Directors because of its threat to the IBM punch card business but the IBM San Jose laboratory continued development until the project was approved by IBM&#x27;s president.

The 350&#x27;s cabinet is long, high and wide.

The RAMAC unit weighs about one ton, has to be moved around with forklifts, and was frequently transported via large cargo airplanes. According to Currie Munce, research vice president for Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (which acquired IBM&#x27;s storage business), the storage capacity of the drive could have been increased beyond five million characters, but IBM&#x27;s marketing department at that time was against a larger capacity drive, because they didn&#x27;t know how to sell a product with more storage. Nonetheless, double capacity versions of the 350 were announced in January 1959 and shipped later the same year.

In 1984, the RAMAC 350 Disk File was designated an International Historic Landmark by The American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In 2002 at the Magnetic Disk Heritage Center, a team led by Al Hoagland began restoration of an IBM 350 RAMAC in collaboration with Santa Clara University. In 2005, the RAMAC restoration project relocated to the Computer History Museum, Mountain View, California and is now demonstrated to the public in the museum&#x27;s Revolution exhibition.

===IBM 353===
The IBM 353, used on the IBM 7030, was similar to the IBM 1301, but with a faster transfer rate. It has a capacity of 2,097,152 (221) 64-bit words or 134,217,728 (227) bits and transferred 125,000 words per second. A prototype unit shipped in late 1960 was the first disk drive to use one head per surface flying on a layer of compressed air as in the older head design of the IBM 350 disk storage (RAMAC). Production 353s used self-flying heads essentially the same as those of the 1301.

===IBM 355===
The IBM 355 was announced on September 14, 1956, as an addition to the popular IBM 650. It used the mechanism of the IBM 350 with up to three access arms and stored 6 million decimal digits and 600,000 signs. It transferred a full track to and from the magnetic core memory of the 653, an IBM 650 option that included just sixty signed 10-digit words, enough for a single track of disk or a tape record, along with two unrelated features.

===IBM 1405===
The IBM 1405 Disk Storage Unit was announced in 1961 and was designed for use with the IBM 1400 series, medium scale business computers. The 1405 Model 1 has a storage capacity of 10 million alphanumeric characters (60,000,000 bits) on 25 disks. Model 2 has a storage capacity of 20 million alphanumeric characters (120,000,000 bits) on 50 disks. In both models the disks are stacked vertically on a shaft rotating at 1200 rpm.

Each side of each disk has 200 tracks divided into five sectors. Sectors 0–4 are on the top surface and 5–9 are on the bottom surface. Each sector holds either 178 or 200 characters. One to three forked-shaped access arms each contains two read/write heads, one for the top of the disk and the other for the bottom of the same disk. The access arms are mounted on a carriage alongside the disk array. During a seek operation an access arm moved, under electronic control, vertically to seek a disk 0–49 and then horizontally to seek a track 0–199. Ten sectors are available at each track. It takes about 10 ms to read or write a sector.

The access time ranges from 100ms to a maximum access time for model 2 of 800ms and 700ms for model 1. The 1405 model 2 disk storage unit has 100,000 sectors containing either 200 characters in &quot;move mode&quot; or 178 characters in &quot;load mode&quot;, which adds a &quot;word mark&quot; bit to each character. The Model 1 contains 50,000 sectors.

===IBM 7300===
The IBM 7300 Disk Storage Unit was designed for use with the IBM 7070; IBM announced a model 2 in 1959, but when IBM announced the 1301 on June 5, 1961, 7070 and 7074 customers found it to be more attractive than the 7300. The 7300 uses the same technology as the IBM 350, IBM 355 and IBM 1405

===IBM 1301===
The IBM 1301 Disk Storage Unit was announced on June 2, 1961 with two models. It was designed for use with the IBM 7000 series mainframe computers and the IBM 1410. The 1301 stores 28 million characters (168,000,000 bits) per module (25 million characters with the 1410). Each module has 25 large disks and 40 user recording surfaces, with 250 tracks per surface. The 1301 Model 1 has one module, the Model 2 has two modules, stacked vertically. The disks spin at 1800 rpm. Data is transferred at 90,000 characters per second.

A major advance over the IBM 350 and IBM 1405 is the use of a separate arm and head for each recording surface, with all the arms moving in and out together like a big comb. This eliminates the time needed for the arm to pull the head out of one disk and move up or down to a new disk. Seeking the desired track is also faster since, with the new design, the head will usually be somewhere in the middle of the disk, not starting on the outer edge. Maximum access time is reduced to 180 milliseconds.

The 1301 is the first disk drive to use heads that are aerodynamically designed to fly over the surface of the disk on a thin layer of air. This allows them to be much closer to the recording surface, which greatly improves performance.

The 1301 connects to the computer via the IBM 7631 File Control. Different models of the 7631 allow the 1301 to be used with a 1410 or 7000 series computer, or shared between two such computers.

The IBM 1301 Model 1 leased for $2,100 per month or could be purchased for $115,500. Prices for the Model 2 were $3,500 per month or $185,000 to purchase. The IBM 7631 controller cost an additional $1,185 per month or $56,000 to purchase. All models were withdrawn in 1970.

===IBM 1302===
The IBM 1302 Disk Storage Unit was introduced in September 1963. Improved recording quadrupled its capacity over that of the 1301, to 117 million 6-bit characters per module. Average access time is 165 ms and data can be transferred at 180 K characters/second, more than double the speed of the 1301. 
There are two access mechanisms per module, one for the inner 250 cylinders and the other for the outer 250 cylinders. 
As with the 1301, there is a Model 2 which doubles the capacity by stacking two modules. 
The IBM 1302 Model 1 leased for $5,600 per month or could be purchased for $252,000. Prices for the Model 2 were $7,900 per month or $355,500 to purchase. The IBM 7631 controller cost an additional $1,185 per month or $56,000 to purchase. The 1302 was withdrawn in February 1965.

===IBM 1311===

The IBM 1311 Disk Storage Drive was announced on October 11, 1962, and was designed for use with several medium-scale business and scientific computers. The 1311 is about the size and shape of a top-loading washing machine and stores 2 million characters (12,000,000 bits) (or, in so-called &quot;Load Mode&quot; on an IBM 1401, a sector can hold 90 7-bit characters, or 12,600,000 bits total ) on a removable IBM 1316 disk pack. Seven models of the 1311 were introduced during the 1960s. They were withdrawn during the early 1970s.

Each IBM 1316 Disk Pack is high, weighs and contains six diameter disks, yielding 10 recording surfaces (the outer surfaces are not used). The 10 individual read/write heads are mounted on a common actuator within the disk drive which moves in and out hydraulically and is mechanically detented at the desired track before reading or writing occurs. The disks spin at 1500 rpm. Each recording surface has 100 tracks with 20 sectors per track. Each sector stores 100 characters. The disk pack is covered with a clear plastic shell and a bottom cover when not in use. A lifting handle in the top center of the cover is rotated to release the bottom cover. Then the top of the 1311 drive is opened and the plastic shell lowered into the disk-drive opening (assuming it is empty). The handle is turned again to lock the disks in place and release the plastic shell, which is then removed and the drive cover closed. The process is reversed to remove a disk pack. The same methods are used for many later disk packs.

There are seven models of the 1311 disk drive. The first drive attached to a system is a &quot;master drive&quot; which contains the controller and can control a number of Model 2 &quot;slave drives.&quot;
# Master drive on an IBM 1440, IBM 1460, or IBM 1240 system and can control up to four Model 2 drives. Introduced October 11, 1962. Withdrawn February 8, 1971.
# Slave drive to a master drive. Can have any special feature incorporated that the master drive has incorporated. Introduced October 11, 1962. Withdrawn January 6, 1975.
# Master drive on IBM 1620 or IBM 1710 system and can control up to three Model 2 drives. Does not support any special features. Introduced October 11, 1962. Withdrawn May 12, 1971.
# Master drive on an IBM 1401 system and can control up to four Model 2 drives. Introduced October 11, 1962. Withdrawn February 8, 1971.
# Master drive on an IBM 1410, IBM 7010, or IBM 7740 system and can control up to four Model 2 drives. Direct Seek comes as standard on this model. Introduced January 7, 1963. Withdrawn May 12, 1971.
# No information available, probably a master drive. Introduced March 5, 1968. Withdrawn February 2, 1971.
# No information available, probably a slave drive to Model 6. Introduced March 5, 1968. Withdrawn February 2, 1971.

The optional special features are:
* Direct Seek: Without this option every seek returns to track zero first.
* Scan Disk: Automatic rapid search for identifier or condition.
* Seek Overlap: Allows a seek to overlap a single read or write, and any number of other seeks, when multiple drives are in use.
* Track Record: Increases the capacity of the disk by writing a single large record per track instead of using 20 separate sectors. A track can hold 2,980 characters in 6-bit &#x27;Move Mode&quot;, and 2,682 7-bit characters in &quot;Load Mode&quot;, giving the drive a total capacity of 17,880,000 bits in 6-bit mode, and 18,774,000 bits in 7-bit mode.

The master drives, Models 1, 3, 4, and 5, which contain extra power supplies and the control logic, are about a foot wider than the Model 2 slave drive.

==IBM System/360 and other IBM mainframe HDDs==
===IBM 2302===
The IBM 2302 is the System/360 version of the 1302, with track formatting in accordance with S/360 DASD architecture rather than 7000 series architecture.

It uses a non-removable module of 25 platters, of which 46 surfaces are used for recording. The 2302 Model 3 contains one module and the Model 4 two. There are two independent access mechanisms per module, one for the innermost 250 cylinders, and one for the outermost 250, tracks available to each access mechanism are called an &quot;access group&quot;. The access mechanism provides one read/write head per track. Average rotational delay is 17 milliseconds (msec), and maximum is 34 msec. Maximum seek time per access group is 180 msec. The track size is 4985 bytes; with formatting information and alternate tracks, module capacity is stated as 112 MB. The 2302 attaches to IBM mainframes via a IBM 2841 Storage Control Unit.

=== IBM 2305 ===
The IBM 2305 fixed head storage (a fixed-head disk drive sometimes incorrectly called a drum) and associated IBM 2835 Storage Control were announced in 1970, initially to connect to the 360/85 and 360/195 using the IBM 2880 Block Multiplexor Channel.

The 2305 Drive was in much demand when the System 370 offered Virtual Storage, and these 2305s were often used for paging devices. They were used in this way on 3155, 3165, 3158, 3168, 3033, 4341, and 3081 (with special feature microcode.) The 2305 was also used for high activity small data sets such as catalogs and job queues.

The 2305-1 has a capacity of 5.4 MB and runs at 3.0 MB/second when attached using the 2-byte channel interface. Average access time is 2.5 ms. The larger 2305-2 has a capacity of 11.2 MB and runs at 1.5 MB/second with an average access time of 5 ms.

The 2305 provides large-scale IBM computers with fast, continuous access to small-sized quantities of information. Its capacity and high data rate make it ideal for some systems residence functions, work files, job queues, indices and data sets that are used repeatedly. Its fast response time makes it attractive as a paging device in a heavily loaded systems, where there are 1.5 or more transactions per second.

===IBM 2311===
The IBM 2311 Disk Storage Drive was introduced with the 2841 Control Unit in 1964 for use throughout the IBM System/360; the combination was also available on the IBM 1130 and the IBM 1800. The drive also directly attaches to the IBM System/360 Model 20 and the IBM System/360 Model 25. All drives used the IBM 1316 Disk Pack introduced with the IBM 1311.

The 2311 Model 1 attaches to most IBM mainframes through a 2841 Control Unit; it attaches to the System/360 Model 25 thru a Disk Attachment Control which provides the function of the control unit. Disk packs are written in these attachments in IBM&#x27;s count key data variable record length format.

The 2311 models 11 or 12 are used when attached to an integrated control of the System/360 Model 20 and the disk packs are written with a fixed sector format. The disk packs are not interchangeable between those written on the Model 1 and those written on the Models 11 or 12.

The 2311 mechanism is largely identical to the 1311, but recording improvements allow higher data density. The 2311 stores 7.25 megabytes on a single removable IBM 1316 disk pack (the same type used on the IBM 1311) consisting of six platters that rotate as a single unit. The 2311 has ten individual read/write (R/W) heads mounted on a common actuator which moves in and out hydraulically and is mechanically detented at the desired track before reading or writing occurred. Each recording surface has 200 tracks plus three optional tracks which can be used as alternatives in case faulty tracks are discovered. Average seek time is 85 ms. Data transfer rate is 156 kB/s.

Because the 2311 was to be used with a wide variety of computers within the 360 product line, its electrical interconnection was standardized. This created an opportunity for other manufacturers to sell plug compatible disk drives for use with IBM computers and an entire industry was born.

===IBM 2314/2319===
====IBM 2314 Disk Access Storage Facility Model 1====
The IBM 2314 Disk Access Storage Facility Model 1 was introduced on April 22, 1965, one year after the System/360 introduction. It was used with the System/360 and the System/370 lines. With the Two Channel Switch feature it could interface with two 360/370 channels. The 2314 Disk access mechanism was similar to the 2311, but further recording improvements allowed higher data density. The 2314 stored 29,176,000 characters (200×20×7294 bytes per track) on a single removable IBM 2316 disk pack which was similar in design to the 1316 but was taller as a result of increasing the number of disks from six to eleven. The 2316 disk pack containing the eleven diameter disks yielded 20 recording surfaces. The drive access consisted of 20 individual R/W heads mounted on a common actuator which was moved in and out hydraulically and mechanically detented at the desired track before reading or writing occurred. Each recording surface has 200 tracks. Access time was initially the same as the 2311, but later models were faster as a result of improvements made in the hydraulic actuator. Data transfer rate was doubled to 310 kB/s.

The original Model 1 consists nine disk drives bundled together with one price; separately shipped was a storage control unit, a single drive module, and two four drive modules for a total of nine drives. The drives are mounted in individual drawers that are unlatched and pulled out to access the disk pack. Because of their appearance they acquired the nickname of &quot;Pizza Ovens&quot;. Only eight drives of the nine are available to the computer at any one time. The ninth drive is there for a spare for the user and can also be worked on &quot;offline&quot; by a Field Engineer while the other drives are in use by the customer. Each drive&#x27;s system address is determined in part by a user-swappable plug, one such plug denoting a spare drive not system accessible. This permits physically changing the address of a drive by changing the plug.

A 2844 Control Unit can be added to the 2314 Control Unit which allows two S/360 Channels simultaneous access to two separate disk drives in the Storage Facility.

Other 2314 models came later:

====IBM 2314 direct access storage facility - A series====
In 1969 IBM unbundled the facility into separate models allowing up to nine drives (eight on line) attached to a 2314 Storage Control:
* 2312 Disk Storage, a one drive module.
* 2313 Disk Storage, a four drive module.
* 2318 Disk Storage, a two drive module.

====IBM 2319====
* In a response to competition from plug compatible manufacturers of 2314 equivalent storage subsystems, IBM beginning 1970 introduced a series of low priced three drive module 2319s which were manufactured by removing one module from the four drive module 2313, rebranding it as a 2319 A1 and offering it at a substantially reduced rental price. This had the effect of lowering the rental price to new customers while keeping the high rental price on existing customers. The 2319-A1 attaches to integrated controllers for only the System/370 Models 135 and 145. Conventional 2314 DASD such as the 2312 or 2318 can attach to the 2319-A1 
* 2319 B series of three disk drives modules allow three, six or nine drive attachment to a new 2314 Model B Storage Control Unit.

===IBM 3310===
IBM introduced the IBM 3310 Direct Access Storage Device on January 30, 1979, for IBM 4331 midrange computers. Each drive had a capacity of 64.5 MB. The 3310 was a fixed-block architecture device, used on DOS/VSE and VM, the only S/370 operating systems that supported FBA devices.

===IBM 3330===

The IBM 3330 Direct Access Storage Facility, code-named &quot;Merlin&quot;, was introduced in June 1970 for use with the IBM System/370 and the IBM System 360/195. The original announcement included the 3330 Model 1, with two drives, and the 3330 Model 2, with only one drive. The 3330 has removable disk packs, similar to its predecessors, and the packs hold 100 MB (404×19×13,030 bytes). Access time is 30 ms and data transfers at 806 kB/s. A major advance introduced with the 3330 is the use of error correction, which makes the drives more reliable and reduces costs because small imperfections in the disk surface can be tolerated. The circuitry can correct error bursts up to 11 bits long through use of fire codes.
The initial configuration consists of one storage control unit (3830 Model 1) bolted to a 3330, with optionally three more 3330&#x27;s bolted together. This is known as a string, making a maximum of eight drives in a string.

In August 1972 IBM announced the &quot;3830 Model 2 Storage Control&quot; and the &quot;3333 Disk Storage and Control&quot;, separating the control unit from the string. The 3830 became a director type of storage control, controlling one or more strings. The now first unit of the string, the 3333 contains a controller and two drives and it can control up to three attached 3330&#x27;s for a maximum of eight drives in the string as shown in the illustration. The 3830 Model 2 can connect two 3333&#x27;s for a maximum of 16 drives per storage control and the 3333 optionally has a string switch that enables it to be connected to two different storage controls.

In 1973 IBM announced double density versions (-11 models) of the 3330 product line: the 3333–11, 3330-11 and the 3336–11; the 3336-11 Disk Packs hold up to 200 MB (808x19x13,030 bytes). It is not possible to mix single and double density drives within a string. It is possible to field upgrade existing 3330 Models to Model 11, but this is a major task, as the drives had to be converted, and all the existing data had to be copied to the new media.

The 3330 was withdrawn in 1983.

===IBM 3340 and 3344===
The IBM 3340 and 3344 have similar characteristics. However, only a 3340 can serve as head of string; there are no A model 3344 drives, and a 3344 must be attached to a 3340 A model as head of string.

====IBM 3340====
The IBM 3340 Direct Access Storage Facility, code-named &quot;Winchester&quot;, was introduced in March 1973 for use with IBM System/370. Three models were announced, the 3340-A2 with two drives and a controller, the models B2 (two drives) and B1 (one drive). B-units can connect to the model A2 to a maximum of eight drives.

It uses removable data modules that included the head and arm assembly; an access door of the data module opens or closes during a mechanical load/unload process to connect the data module to the drive; unlike previous disk packs and cartridges there is no cover to remove during the insertion process. Access time is 25 millisecond and data transfers at 885 kB/s. Three versions of the removable IBM 3348 Data Module were sold, one with 35 megabyte capacity, another with 70 megabytes, the third also has 70 megabytes, of which 500 kilobytes were accessible with fixed heads for faster access. The 3340 also uses error correction. It was withdrawn in 1984.

The 3340 was developed in San Jose under the leadership of Ken Haughton. Early on the design was focused on two removable 30 megabyte modules. Because of this 30/30 configuration, the code name &quot;Winchester&quot; was selected after the famous Winchester .30-30 rifle; subsequently the capacities were increased, but the code name stuck.

One significant aspect of this product, and the reason that disk drives in general became known as &quot;Winchester technology&quot;, was that this head design was very low cost and did not require the heads to be unloaded from the media. Winchester technology allowed the head to land and take off from the disk media as the disk spun up and down. This resulted in very significant savings and a large reduction of complexity of the head and arm actuating mechanism. This head design rapidly became a standard design within the disk drive manufacturing community.

Up into the early 1990s the term &quot;Winchester&quot; or &quot;Winnie&quot; was used for hard disk drives in general long after the introduction of the 3340, but is no longer in common use in most parts of the world.

====IBM 3344====
The IBM 3344 is similar to the 3340, except that it uses fixed media rather than removable 3348 data modules, each spindle has four logical drives each with the capacity of a 3348–70, there is no A (head of string) model and it is only available in dual drive models. The 3344-B2F is identical to the 3344-B2 except that both drives have fixed heads over some cylinders. Both 3344-B2 and 3344-B2F require a 3340-A2 or 3340-A2F as head of string. Inside, the 3344 is exactly the same as IBM 3350, the difference is only in the microcode in the control unit.

===IBM 3350===

The IBM 3350 Direct Access Storage Facility, code-named &quot;Madrid&quot;, was introduced in 1975 for use with IBM System/370. Its non-removable head-disk assemblies (HDAs) are sealed and included the head and arm assembly. The 3350 disk geometry is 555 cylinders, 30 heads, and 19,069 bytes per track, which give each HDA a storage capacity of 317,498,850 bytes. Sealed HDAs were standard practice on all IBM DASD hereafter.

Disk units are identified as Models A2, A2F, B2, B2F, C2, and C2F with each model containing two HDAs. Model A2 and A2F has one additional electronic board, allowing it to be connected to the control unit. They are referred to as controllers, and also sometimes head-of-string. The models are installed in strings of units with an A2 or A2F unit, and then up to three B2 units or up to two B2s and a C2. The A2 unit usually has a string switch, allowing it to be connected to two different storage control units. This allows two I/O operations simultaneously take place to two different HDAs in the string. The storage control unit can be a 3830 Model 2, or the ISC (Integrated Storage Control) found in the 3148, 3158 or 3168 cpu&#x27;s. Also later control units (3880) are backwards compatible and can be used. The C2s unit also contains a controller, that can be connected to a storage control unit and serves as a secondary path to itself and the A2 and B2 units. The C2 controller is a spare, it can only be used when the controller in the A unit is broken, and subsequently powered off. It has also limited connections, usually the A unit has a string switch, but the C unit only can be connected to one storage control unit. The valid 3350 strings are: -A, -AB, -ABB, -ABBB, -AC-, -ABC-, or -ABBC- configurations.

The &quot;x2F&quot;, as in Model A2F, unit is a normal x2 unit, but its two HDAs also have a Fixed Head area over the first five cylinders, thereby reducing seek time to zero for these five cylinders. This fixed head area is intended to be allocated to the frequently accessed HASP or JES2 checkpoint area and thus greatly reduce head motion on the SPOOL device. The fixed head area can also be utilized for TSO swap data (MVT and SVS) and system swap data (MVS) wherein the swap data for SVS and MVS consist of blocks of pages that have been in memory when an address space is selected for swap-out; those pages need not be contiguous and in general do not include pages that have not been modified since their last page-in. This system architecture greatly improves context switches between TSO users or batch regions.

The IBM 3350 family was withdrawn in September 1994.

===IBM 3370 and 3375===

====IBM 3370====
IBM introduced the IBM 3370 Direct Access Storage Device in January 1979 for IBM 4331, 4341, and System/38 midrange computers. It has seven fixed disks, and each unit has a capacity of 571 MB. It was the first HDD to use thin-film head technology; research on that technology started at Thomas J. Watson Research Center in the late 1960s. The 3370 was a fixed-block architecture device, used on DOS/VSE and VM, the only S/370 operating systems that supported FBA devices.

====IBM 3375====
The sister unit was called the IBM 3375 and used count key data architecture, which was required for OS/360 and successor operating systems.

===IBM 3380===
The IBM 3380 Direct Access Storage Device was introduced in June 1980. It uses film head technology and has a unit capacity of 2.52 gigabytes (two hard disk assemblies each with two independent actuators each accessing 630 MB within one 3380 unit) with a data transfer rate of 3 megabytes per second. Average access time was 16 ms. Purchase price at time of introduction ranged from $81,000 to $142,200. Due to tribology problems encountered between heads and media, the first units did not ship until October 1981.

Similar to its predecessor (3350) the standard configuration is one A unit and up to three B units, but because each 3380 contains four devices each string now can contain up to 16 devices. Usually it is connected to a 3880 storage control units with two paths, allowing two simultaneous I/O operations, however, the operations must target different HDAs.

In February 1985, IBM announced a double density version – the Extended Capability Models of the 3380 (3380 E) having 5.04 gigabytes per 3380 unit, that is, two 1.26 gigabyte actuators on two hard disk assemblies.

A triple capacity version, the 3380 K was announced in August 1987 having 7.562 gigabytes per 3380 unit, that is, two 1.89 gigabyte actuators on two hard disk assemblies. The new Model K and Model J can optionally run in four-path mode. In this mode, the string has two A units located in the middle, and up to three B units connected on each side, giving a maximum of 32 devices in a string. This requires they are connected to a 3990 storage control unit, and allows four simultaneous I/O operation in the string.

There are twelve models of the IBM 3380 family: six A-units, five B-units and one C-unit. A-units (heads of string) contain additional logic to perform string controller functions and connect to IBM storage control units (3880 or 3990). The C-units connect directly to an IBM channel. B-units connects to A-units or C-units.

The last models were withdrawn by IBM in May 1996 representing a production run of 15 years; a run longer than most disk drives

===IBM 3390===
The IBM 3390 Direct Access Storage Device series was introduced November 1989, offering a maximum storage of up to 22 gigabytes in a string of multiple drives. Cost of a storage system varied by configuration and capacity, between $90,000 and $795,000.

A 3390 string consists of an A unit placed in the middle, and optionally one or two B units bolted to its sides. The A unit can have four or eight devices, each B unit can have up to 12 devices. The 3390 is always running in four-path mode, connected to a 3990 storage control unit. Optionally the 3990 can have a second 3390 string attached, giving a maximum of 64 devices in the subsystem.

Packaged in Hard Disk Assemblies with two actuator-head units and one set of platters, a model 1 HDA provides 1.89 GB before formatting and a model 2 provides 3.78 GB/HDA. The Model 3 enhancement to the drive family, announced September 11, 1991, increased capacity 1.5 times to 5.67 GB/HDA and the Model 9, announced May 20, 1993, further increased capacity 3 times to 11.3 GB/HDA.

All the preceding DASD models are equipped with a large AC motor, driving the HDA with a belt; however, the 3390 HDA is directly driven by a DC motor that is included in the enclosure.

The 3390 Model 9 was the last Single Large Expensive Disk (sometimes called SLEDs) drive announced by IBM.

===IBM 9340 and 9345===

====IBM 9345====
The IBM 9345 HDD first shipped in Nov 1990 as an RPQ on IBMs SCSE (SuperComputing Systems Extensions). Developed at IBM&#x27;s San Jose, California laboratory under the code name Sawmill. It was an up to 1.5 GB full height 5-inch HDD using up to 8 130 mm disks. It was the first HDD to use MR (Magneto Resistive) heads.

====IBM 9340====
In October 1991 the 9345 DASD was announced as part of the IBM 9340 channel-attached, count key data (CKD) DASD subsystem family which attached to IBM mainframes including the ES/9000 processor family. The 9345 DASD Model 1 had two 1.0 GB HDDs while the Model 2 had two 1.5 GB HDDs.

For most practical applications, the 9340/9345 was functionally equivalent to a 3990/3390, although without non-volatile RAM cache of the 3990 and with a somewhat shorter maximum block length than the 3390.

The OS&#x27;s IOS component learned of this device&#x27;s characteristics through a special initializer, IECCINIT, which also serviced other DASD device types, and for the same purpose. It was at initialization-time that the OS learned that the 9340 has no non-volatile cache and the 9345 has a shorter than expected track capacity. The initializer, therefore, assigned a different device type than the 3990/3390.

===9330 family of disk drives===
# 9331 Diskette Unit models 1 and 11 contained one 8-inch FDD while the models 2 and 12 contained one 5-inch FDD.
# 9332 Direct Access Storage Device used the IBM 0667 HDD.
# 9333 High Performance Disk Drive Subsystem used the IBM 0664 or IBM 0681 HDDs depending upon subsystem model
# 9334 Disk Expansion Unit attaches from one to four SCSI HDDs to the RS/6000 system.
# 9335 Direct Access Storage Subsystem This HDD used in this subsystem was developed under the code name &quot;Kestrel&quot; at IBM Hursley, UK, and was an 850 MB HDD using three 14-inch disks with dual rotary actuators, each actuator accessing three surfaces with two heads per surface. The HDD was in the rack mountable 9335 announced as a part of the October 1986 IBM 9370 Information System announcement. There is no known OEM version of this HDD.
# 9336 Disk Unit used the IBM 0681 HDD (Redwing)
# 9337 Disk Array Subsystem used the IBM 0662 (Spitfire) or 0663 (Corsair) HDDs.

==HDDs offered for IBM small systems==

===IBM 2310===

The IBM 2310 Removable Cartridge Drive was announced in 1964 with the IBM 1800, and then in 1965 with the IBM 1130; it likely first shipped with the 1130 in late 1965. It could store 512,000 16-bit words (1,024,000 bytes) on an IBM 2315 cartridge. A single oxide-coated aluminum disk spun in a plastic shell with openings for the read/write arm and two heads.
===IBM 5444===
The IBM 5444 was announced September 1969 as part of System/3. Developed at IBM&#x27;s Hursley, England, laboratory under code name Dolphin it used the 5440 disk cartridge. The cartridge in turn contained one 14-inch disk. There were three models:

* Model 1 has one fixed disk and one removable disk each with 100 tracks per surface for a disk cartridge capacity of 1.23 MB
* Model 2 has one fixed disk and one removable disk each with 200 tracks per surface for a disk cartridge capacity of 2.46 MB
* Model 3 has only one removable disk with 200 tracks per surface for a disk cartridge capacity of 2.46 MB

===IBM 62GV===

The 62GV first shipped in May 1974. Developed at IBM&#x27;s Hursley, UK, laboratory under the code name Gulliver with an initial capacity of 5 MB. Subsequent models have 10 MB (62TM) and 14 MB capacities. It used a Swinging Arm actuator with one 14-inch disk. The simple design of the actuator, invented at IBM&#x27;s UK Hursley Labs, became IBM&#x27;s most licensed electro-mechanical invention of all time, the actuator and filtration system being adopted in the 1980s eventually for all HDDs, and still universal nearly 40 years and 10 Billion arms later. During its production life the IBM 62GV shipped 177,000 units making it the first HDD known to have shipped in excess of 100,000 units.

==OEM and Small Systems HDDs==
This section lists IBM manufactured HDDs offered both as an OEM product and for attachment to IBMs small systems such as the System/3, System/32, /34 and /36 and the AS/400. HDDs are identified by their OEM model number and listed chronologically by date of first customer shipment.

===IBM 0680===
The 0680 first shipped in 1979 on most IBM small systems and the low end of the System/370 as the 3310 direct access storage. The OEM version was announced as the 0680 in September 1981. Developed at IBM&#x27;s Hursley, UK, laboratory under the code name Piccolo with an initial capacity of up to 65MB, it used six 8-inch disks (210 mm) and had an improved rotary actuator.

A double capacity version, the 62SW, shipped in June 1984 but very few units were sold because its price per megabyte was the same as the 62GV.

===IBM 0676===
The 0676 first shipped in November 1982 as a 5247 Disk Storage Unit for the IBM System/23 Datamaster. Developed at the IBM Rochester, Minnesota, laboratory as the 21ED it was an 8-inch HDD with an initial capacity of 15 or 30 MB in two or four 210 mm disks. In 1983 it shipped as the HDD in the 5360 System Unit of the S/36. In 1984 its capacity was doubled by doubling the number of tracks per surface and it was incorporated into the 5362 System Unit of the System/36.

===IBM 0665===

The 0665 first shipped in October 1985 in the system unit for the PC AT (5170). Developed under the code name &quot;Pixie&quot; at IBM Rochester, Minnesota, it was a 5-inch HDD with capacities of 20, 30 and 44 MB.

===IBM 0667===
The 0667 first shipped in August 1986. Developed at IBM Rochester, Minnesota, under the code name &quot;Grant&quot;, it was a 70 MB ESDI full height 5-inch HDD with up to four 130 mm disks. It was offered as a feature on certain models of the PC RT (6150, 6151, 6152) and in System/36 Model System Units (5363, 5364).

===IBM 0669===
The 0669 first shipped in 1987. Developed at IBM Rochester, Minnesota, under the code name &quot;Grant-Prime&quot;, it was a full-height 5-inch HDD with a capacity of up to 115 MB on up to four 130 mm disks. It was the HDD internal to the System/36 5363 System Unit and Series 1 4956 System Unit.

===IBM 0671===
The 0671 first shipped in 1987. Developed under the code name &quot;Lee&quot; at IBM Rochester, Minnesota, it was an up to 316 MB ESDI full height 5-inch HDD with up to eight 130 mm disks depending upon model. This was IBM&#x27;s first usage of a thin metal film as the disk&#x27;s recording surface. In 1988 it shipped as part of the 9404 System Unit of the IBM AS/400 system which contained two, or optionally three of these HDDs.

===IBM 0661===
The 0661 first shipped in 1989 as the model 371. Developed initially under the code name &quot;Lightning&quot; at IBM Rochester Minnesota (and IBM Hursley, UK) as a 320 MB SCSI HDD with up to eight 95 mm disks (14 heads), it was followed in 1990 with a 400 MB version, code named &quot;Turbo&quot;. During 1990 it was added as a standard drive on several major IBM systems, e.g., IBM AS/400 System Unit Model CXX.

===IBM 0681===
The 0681 first shipped in April 1990. Developed at IBM&#x27;s Hursley, UK, laboratory under the code name Redwing, it was the last HDD product developed at Hursley. It was an up to 857 MB full-height 5-inch HDD using up to 12 130 mm disks. It was the first HDD to use PRML decoding of data. It was the drive component of the 9333 Disk Drive Subsystem which first shipped in early 1992.

A higher density, 1.07 GB, version was incorporated into the 9333 subsystem in May 1992.

===IBM 0663===
The 0663 first shipped in late 1991. Developed under the code name &quot;Corsair&quot;, it was a 3-inch HDD with the height of a 5-inch half-height device (1.6-inch high) and up to 1 GB on up to 8 95 mm disks. It was offered as a feature on certain models of the PS/2 and RS/6000. It was the first OEM disk drive to use MR Heads.

===IBM 0664===
The 0664 first shipped in November 1992. Developed under the code name &quot;Allicat&quot; at IBM Rochester, Minnesota, it was a full-height 5-inch HDD (3.25-inch high) that combined two 3-inch devices in one, with up to 2.013 GB capacity on up to 8 95 mm disks.

===IBM 0662===
The 0662 first shipped in June 1993. Developed under the code name &quot;Spitfire&quot; at IBM Rochester, Minnesota, it was a full-height (1-inch high) 3-inch HDD with 1.05 GB on three disks or five disk surfaces. It was the HDD internal to the 9336 Disk Unit and the 9337 Disk Array.

== Floppy disk drive ==
Another important IBM innovation is the floppy disk drive. IBM first introduced the 8-inch FDD in 1971 as a read only program load device. In 1973 IBM shipped its first read/write floppy disk drive as a part of the 3740 Data Entry System. IBM established early standards in 8&quot; FDDs but never sold such products separately so that the industry then developed separate from IBM.

IBM was at one point was the world&#x27;s largest purchaser of OEM 5-inch FDDs; its selection of the two-sided, 48 tracks-per-inch model helped establish the model as the de facto industry standard. IBM made extensive preparations to manufacture such models and smaller form factors but cancelled all such efforts in 1985. IBM&#x27;s 1983 attempt to OEM its 4-inch DemiDisk failed.

==&quot;Star&quot; series of HDDs==
On October 17, 1994, IBM&#x27;s Storage Systems division announced three new families of hard disk drives, the Travelstar 2-inch family for notebooks, the Deskstar 3-inch family for desktop applications and the Ultrastar 3-inch family for high performance computer system applications.

==IBM&#x27;s first HDD versus its last HDDs==
The following table compares IBM&#x27;s first HDD, the RAMAC 350, with the last three models it manufactured in each of its &quot;Star&quot; series of OEM HDDs. It illustrates HDD&#x27;s spectacular decline in cost and size along with corresponding improvement in capacity and performance.

==DASD devices not HDDs or FDDs==
IBM in some of its operating systems classifies HDDs and FDDs as DASDs, direct access storage devices. Other technologies so classified include:

===IBM 7320 drum===
The IBM 7320 is a magnetic-drum storage unit announced in 1962.

===IBM 2301 drum===
The IBM 2301 is a magnetic-drum storage device introduced in the late 1960s

===IBM 2303 drum===
The IBM 2303 is a magnetic-drum storage device introduced in 1964.

===IBM 2321 Data Cell===
The IBM 2321 Data Cell announced in 1964 is a device that uses short strips of magnetic tape to store data. It holds 10 40 MB removable &quot;cells&quot;, for a total capacity of 400 MB.

===IBM 3850 Mass Storage System===
The IBM 3850 Mass Storage System, announced in 1974, is a library system of tape cartridges that staged data from the cartridges onto physical IBM 3330 or 3350 disk drives which then appeared to the system as virtual 3330 drives.

<text>Alderley Edge is a village and civil parish in Cheshire, England, north-west of Macclesfield and south of Manchester. It lies at the base of a wooded sandstone escarpment, &quot;The Edge&quot;, overlooking the Cheshire Plain. As of the 2021 census, its population was 4,777.

The village is known for its affluence, expensive homes and location within Cheshire&#x27;s Golden Triangle. Its cafes and designer shops attract Premier League footballers, actors and businesspeople, making it one of the UK&#x27;s most sought-after places to live outside London.

==History==

===Early period===
The Alderley Edge area shows signs of occupation since the Mesolithic period, with flint tools found along its sandstone outcrop. Evidence of Bronze Age copper mining has been identified to the south of the area. In 1995, the Derbyshire Caving Club uncovered a Roman coin hoard of 564 coins (dated AD 317–336), now housed in the Manchester Museum). There are 13 recorded sites in Alderley Edge, 28 in Nether Alderley, and 44 along the Edge in the County Sites and Monuments Record.

Early medieval settlements were documented in Nether Alderley, to the south of Alderley Edge. The first written record of Alderley Edge, then called &quot;Chorlegh&quot; (later spelt &quot;Chorley&quot;) dates back to the 13th century, likely derived from &quot;ceorl&quot; and &quot;lēah&quot;, meaning a &quot;peasants&#x27; clearing&quot;. Although not in the Domesday Book, it appears in a c.1280 charter. The name &quot;Alderley&quot;, first recorded in 1086 as &quot;Aldredelie&quot;, likely derives from &quot;Aldred&quot; and &quot;leah&quot; meaning &quot;Aldred&#x27;s clearing&quot; or from Old English language &quot;Alðrȳðelēah&quot; meaning &quot;the meadow or woodland clearing of a woman called Alðrȳð&quot;.

In the 13th century and Middle Ages, the area comprised multiple estates, mostly owned by the De Trafford baronets from the 15th century. The main manors were Chorley Old Hall, a 14th-century structure, and Nether Alderley&#x27;s Old Hall, a 16th-century building destroyed by fire in 1779. Agriculture dominated the local economy, with Nether Alderley granted a market charter around 1253. Nether Alderley Mill dates back to 1391, although the present timber structure is 16th-century. The millpond was adapted to form the moat which surrounded the Old Hall, the home of the Stanley family. The corn mill continued to work until 1939 when Edward Stanley, 6th Baron Stanley of Alderley, was compelled to sell it, along with the rest of the Alderley Park estate, to meet the cost of death duties. In the 1950s the National Trust bought the site, restored the building and opened it to the public.

Cheshire had its own system of taxes in the mediaeval period, the &quot;Mize&quot;; in the records for 1405, Chorley was assessed at 20s 0d and Nether Alderley at 27s 0d.

===19th century===
In 1830, Chorley comprised a few cottages, the De Trafford Arms Inn, a toll bar, and a smithy scattered along the Congleton to Manchester Road. The arrival of the railway in 1842, part of the Manchester and Birmingham Railway, transformed the area. The railway company offered free 20-year season tickets to Manchester businessmen who built homes worth over £50 within a mile of the station. These tickets, small silver ovals worn on watch chains, encouraged development.

The railway station, initially called &#x27;Alderley&#x27;, was renamed &#x27;Alderley and Chorley&#x27; in 1853 and later &#x27;Alderley Edge&#x27; in 1876. After the railway&#x27;s construction, Sir Humphrey de Trafford, owner of Chorley Hall, developed an estate with new roads and houses, most completed by 1910. The railway also boosted the village&#x27;s popularity with day trips and excursions.

Several landmark buildings were established during this time, including St Philip&#x27;s Church in 1853, Alderley Edge Community Primary School in 1854, and The Ryleys School for boys in 1877. Two all-girls schools were opened, St Hilary&#x27;s in 1876 and Mount Carmel in 1945, which then merged in 1999 to form Alderley Edge School for Girls. The Mission Hall (later The Institute), built in 1878 for temperance meetings, and the Methodist Church, built in 1863, also date from this period.

Alderley Edge&#x27;s population rose from 561 in 1841 to 2,856 by 1902, while Nether Alderley&#x27;s fell from 679 to 522. 

The 1871 Ordnance Survey map shows the village with the Queen&#x27;s Hotel, shops, terraced houses and a post office. To the north were wooded areas with detached villas, while to the east, curving roads divided large wooded plots, some still undeveloped. The names &quot;Brickfield&quot; and &quot;Brick Kiln&quot; to the northeast suggest a local brick source. The 1899 map shows a similar layout but details individual villas like Holybank, Ashfield, and The Larches, along with remnants of old mines near Windmill Wood to the southeast.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, Alderley Edge expanded with post-war housing on its north-eastern and western edges, while Nether Alderley remained largely unchanged, aside from the sale of Alderley Park to AstraZeneca. The park is now managed by Bruntwood; it houses 150 science companies and commercial, residential and retail spaces.

In 1990s, several gold bars were found in Alderley, the first on Artists Lane. An inquest was held in February 1993 and it was declared not to be a treasure trove. John Cherry from the British Museum along with Adrian Tindall, the conservation officer for Cheshire County Council reported that the bar weighed 97.01 grams and was 73% gold. The publicity caused the public to search for more and five more gold bars were found.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Alderley Edge, at civil parish and unitary authority level: Alderley Edge Parish Council and Cheshire East Council. The parish council meets at Festival Hall on Talbot Road.

===Administrative history===
The settlement now known as Alderley Edge was historically called Chorley and was part of the ancient parish of Wilmslow in the Macclesfield Hundred of Cheshire. Wilmslow parish was divided into four townships: Bollin Fee, Chorley, Fulshaw, and Pownall Fee. Alderley parish, lying south of Chorley; consisted of three townships: Nether Alderley, Over Alderley, and Great Warford. From the 17th century, parishes gradually acquired civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Wilmslow and Alderley, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Chorley and all the other townships became separate civil parishes, which therefore diverged from the ecclesiastical parishes.

In 1862, a Chorley local government district was established, governed by an elected local board, covering parts of Chorley, Bollin Fee and Fulshaw. The more rural western part of Chorley was excluded.

In 1894, the board renamed the district to Alderley Edge to avoid postal confusion with Chorley, Lancashire and became an urban district under the Local Government Act 1894. The 1894 Act also directed that civil parishes could no longer straddle district boundaries, and so the part of Chorley within the urban district became a separate parish called Alderley Edge, and the parts of Bollin Fee and Fulshaw within the urban district became a parish called Bollinfee. The reduced civil parish of Chorley outside the urban district kept the name Chorley, despite no longer including the village after which it was named.

The urban district expanded in 1910, gaining area from Nether Alderley and 1936, taking small areas from Wilmslow and Chorley. In 1974, Alderley Edge Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, with a successor parish established covering the same area. District-level functions passed to Macclesfield Borough Council, and in 2009, Cheshire East Council took over as the Borough council and Cheshire County Council were both abolished.

==Economy==

At the 2001 UK census, the ward had a possible workforce of approximately 2,157 people. The economic activity of residents in the Alderley Edge electoral ward was 36.9% in full-time employment, 10.2% in part-time employment, 29.3% self-employed, 1.7% unemployed, 1.4% students with jobs, 3.5% students without jobs, 19.3% retired, 7.5% looking after home or family, 2.8% permanently sick or disabled and 2.0% economically inactive for other reasons. 

Alderley Edge has a very high rate of self-employment (29.3%) compared with rest of the Macclesfield borough (22.7%) and England (16.6%). It also has low rates of unemployment (1.7%) compared with the rest of the Macclesfield borough (2.0%) and England (3.3%). The Office for National Statistics estimated that, during the period of April 2001 to March 2002, the average gross weekly income of households in Alderley Edge was £720 (£37,440 per year).

==Landmarks==

===The Edge===


The Edge is a wide red sandstone escarpment situated above the village of Alderley. An &quot;edge&quot; is used as a descriptive term for high land in Cheshire and adjacent counties. The Edge rises gradually from Macclesfield until, at a distance of 7 or 8 kilometres, it terminates abruptly, having reached a height of nearly 215 metres above sea level and 110 metres above the Cheshire Plain below it.

It was formed by weathering of resistant sandstone over layers and faulting. The northern side, shaped like a horse shoe or &quot;hough&quot;, gives its name to The Hough, a hamlet of scattered houses descending towards Alderley village.

Owned by the National Trust, it is a public access wooded area attracting 300,000 visitors annually from Manchester and the nearby towns of Wilmslow and Macclesfield. It features a car park, toilet facilities 
and is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its unique geology. The woodland contains remnants of the old Alderley Edge Mines.

====Views====

The Edge offers views across Cheshire and the Peak District. The Cheshire Plain is visible, stretching from Macclesfield Forest in the south-east towards the Derbyshire peaks in the east, and north to Manchester and the Blackstone Edge in Yorkshire.

Hundreds of Scots pines were planted on the Edges by Sir James and Sir Edward Stanley, between 1745 and 1755. Before trees were planted, the Edge provided a full 360° panorama. Today, views are limited to the northerly and easterly directions. Trees obscure views of landmarks like the Wrekin in Shropshire; The Cloud near Bosley, Mow Cop and the mountains of North Wales.

===Alderley Edge mines===
The Edge has a long history of copper mining, with activity dating back to the Bronze Age and Roman times. Mining continued from the 1690s to the 1920s. The National Trust now owns many of the mines, leasing them to the Derbyshire Caving Club, which maintains access and explores long-sealed areas.

Since the 1860s, the mines have attracted thousands of visitors. However, between 1940 and 1960, many were unprepared, leading to accidents that gave the mines a lasting notoriety. The West and Wood Mines were blocked in the early 1960s but, in 1969, the Derbyshire Caving Club reopened Wood Mine with the National Trust&#x27;s permission. Since then, supervised group visits and excavations have uncovered much of interest.

===Historic buildings===


There are many historic buildings including Chorley Old Hall, which is the oldest surviving manor house in Cheshire.

To the south of the village is the Alderley Park estate, former ancestral home of the Stanleys.

The village is notable for its Victorian villas. The first villa was constructed in the early 1840s and by 1850 thirty &quot;handsome residences&quot; had been erected, mainly by the cotton barons from Manchester who moved out of the city as the railway was built. The buildings are varied in style with examples of mock Tudor, Italian, neo-Georgian and Arts and Crafts Movement designs. The wide range of materials used reflects this somewhat eclectic mix of styles, and includes stone, brick, smooth render or roughcast for the walls, and Welsh slate or clay tiles for the roofs.

==Local legend==
===The Wizard of the Edge===
Legend tells of a Mobberley farmer leading a milk-white mare to market in Macclesfield. Along the Edge, at a spot called &quot;Thieves Hole&quot;, an old man in grey stopped him and offered to buy the horse. The farmer declined, confident of a better price at market. The old man predicted that he would return that evening, unsold, to the same spot.

Failing to sell the horse, the farmer retraced his steps. The old man reappeared and repeated his offer, which was now accepted. Leading the farmer to a spot near Stormy Point, the old man waved a wand, uttered a spell, and revealed iron gates in the rock. Inside was a cavern filled with sleeping men and white horses. The old man, a wizard, paid the farmer from a chest and explained the sleepers would rise if England faced peril. He then sent the astonished farmer home.

Several versions of the legend exist. It first appeared in print in 1805 when a letter from &quot;A Perambulator&quot; was published in the &quot;Manchester Mail&quot;. The author claimed the story came from an old servant of the Stanley family and was often told by Parson Shrigley, Clerk and Curate of Alderley (1753–1776).

The tale later appeared in a tourist pamphlet as &quot;The Cheshire Enchanter&quot; (prose) and &quot;The Legend of the Iron Gates&quot; (verse). Some versions include prophecies attributed to Robert Nixon, with the wizard foretelling that the sleeping men and horses would awaken to save the country during George the son of George’s reign. Later adaptations, such as James Roscoe&#x27;s poem, suggest the wizard was Merlin and the sleepers were King Arthur’s army.

There are a number of similar British legends which closely resemble the Alderley one, though since they are all founded in oral tradition it is not possible to know which came first. A very similar one was made into a ballad called &quot;Sir Guy the Seeker&quot; by Matthew &#x27;Monk&#x27; Lewis, and is based on a legend of Dunstanburgh Castle. In his preface to &quot;Sir Guy the Seeker&quot; Lewis pointed out the similarity to the Alderley legend.

Alan Garner used the legend of The Wizard of the Edge, and other local legends, in his novels &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot; and &quot;The Moon of Gomrath&quot;. Garner, born in Congleton, was raised in Alderley Edge.

==Transport==
===Roads===

After several decades of discussion, a 5 km, north-to-south A34 Alderley Edge bypass was constructed (officially named &quot;Melrose Way&quot;) to the west of Alderley Edge to relieve the congestion in the village. It starts at the Harden roundabout at the end of the Wilmslow bypass and goes west of Alderley Edge, then rejoins the A34 close to the entrance of Alderley Park.

The £56 million project was carried out by Birse Civils and was officially opened by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and MP for Alderley Edge, George Osborne, on 19 November 2010.

===Railway===
Alderley Edge railway station is situated on the Crewe to Manchester line, which is a spur of the West Coast Main Line. There are generally two trains per hour to Crewe, two to Manchester Piccadilly via Stockport and one to Manchester Piccadilly via Manchester Airport; on Sundays, there is an hourly service each way between Crewe and Manchester Piccadilly, via Stockport. The station is managed by Northern, which also operates all services that stop here.

===Buses===
Alderley Edge is served by the 130 bus route, which is operated by D&amp;G Bus; it runs hourly during the daytime (except Sundays) between Macclesfield, Wilmslow and Manchester Airport.

==In popular culture==
Alderley Edge has been used as a major setting in various books and television shows:
* It was the main setting of the Channel 4 show &quot;Goldplated&quot;
* The location inspired Peter Graham to compose &quot;On Alderley Edge&quot;, a commission for the Black Dyke Band.
* It was the main setting of the MTV show &quot;Living on the Edge&quot;
* The Edge and the country south of it was the setting for Alan Garner&#x27;s novels &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot; and &quot;The Moon of Gomrath&quot;.
* The village has been featured in the ITVBe show &quot;The Real Housewives of Cheshire&quot;.

==Notable residents==
After the death of their father in 1870, George Gissing and his two younger brothers were sent to Lindow Grove, a Quaker boarding school in Alderley Edge, whose headmaster James Wood was often parodied by the novelist.

The Pilkington family (of Pilkington&#x27;s Glass) owned all of the woodland now known as The Edge until 1948, when their daughters donated the land to the National Trust. The Pilkington company developed the toughened safety glass necessary when motor cars and very tall buildings became popular. They became hugely wealthy. On Woodbrook Road they built The Cedars as the family home, which has a distinctive large tower and is built from white stone. The house is now sub-divided into four luxury dwellings. The architect and furniture designer J. Henry Sellers (1861–1954) spent the latter part of his life at Bollin Tower.

The author Alan Garner, who wrote the children&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot;, which is set on Alderley Edge, lived on Trafford Road at the corner with Stevens Street and Moss Lane.

Former footballers who live in Alderley Edge include Joleon Lescott and Manchester United players Dwight Yorke, Rio Ferdinand, Michael Carrick and Andy Cole. David Beckham and his wife Victoria Beckham previously resided in Alderley Edge. A number of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; actors, including Helen Flanagan and Richard Fleeshman, live in the village, as do musicians Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook. The singer-songwriter Matty Healy spent his formative years in Alderley Edge together with actor parents Denise Welch and Tim Healy.

<doc id="861221" wikidata="Q3433661" url="?curid=861221" title="Calcasieu River">
<text>The Calcasieu River ( ; ) is a river on the Gulf Coast in southwestern Louisiana. Approximately long, it drains a largely rural area of forests and bayou country, meandering southward to the Gulf of Mexico. The name &quot;Calcasieu&quot; most likely comes through French from the Atakapa language (&#x27;Crying Eagle&#x27;), the name of a local Atakapa leader.

==Course==

The Calcasieu rises in Vernon Parish, north of Leesville, and flows initially southeast, passing through the Kisatchie National Forest southwest of Alexandria. It then turns southwest, flowing past Oakdale and Lake Charles, the largest city on the river. It enters the north end of the brackish Calcasieu Lake, an estuary on the Gulf of Mexico approximately southwest of Lake Charles. The lake, which is referred to by locals as &quot;Big Lake&quot;, is connected by a channel to the gulf on the south end. The lower portion of the river south of Lake Charles is paralleled by a navigable canal which connects to the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.

==History==
In the early 19th century, the area of present-day Louisiana and Texas west of the Calcasieu River extending roughly north-south to the Arroyo Hondo in Natchitoches Parish and east of the Sabine River was disputed between the United States and Spain. The dispute arose from differing interpretations of the western boundary of Louisiana under the terms of the Louisiana Purchase. The area became known as Neutral Ground and became a haven for privateers outside the legal jurisdiction of both nations.

During the US Civil War, a naval engagement occurred on May 6, 1864 at Calcasieu Pass, with the Confederates capturing two Union gun boats.

==Water quality==
Because the river passes through areas with intensive petroleum refining and other industries, petrochemical wastes have been found contaminating the river and estuarine environment along the lower Calcasieu River. A 1993, a Condea Vista Chemical Company pipeline spill was reported by the company to have leaked of a highly toxic chemical known as ethylene dichloride. &quot;Mother Jones&quot; reported the spill as potentially discharging between , that would have spread throughout parts of the estuary.

Sasol Ltd purchased Condea Vista in 2000 inheriting the controversy. The site was designated a &quot;super-fund site&quot; and Sasol has been involved in long-term legal battles that have resulted in settlements, fines, and the clean-up of affected areas. A problem is that the chemical sinks in water and becomes covered by deposits of silt. Any clean-up would inevitably stir up the covered chemical, causing further ecological damage. The lower end of the estimated spill () would be two times the 1988 US production of ethylene dichloride, which was 9,445,000 tons. 1.6 million tons were cleaned up. Any construction might disturb contaminated soil so would have to be constantly monitored.

<text>In American law, the American Law Reports are a resource used by American lawyers to find a variety of sources relating to specific legal rules, doctrines, or principles. It has been published since 1919, originally by Lawyers Cooperative Publishing, and currently by West (a business unit of Thomson Reuters) and remains an important tool for legal research.

Each ALR volume contains several annotations. An annotation is an article that summarizes the evolution of a very specific legal concept in a concise and precise fashion. The article will either be preceded by the full text of an important relevant case, or in later series, contain a reference to the text of the case, which is reproduced at the end of the volume.

The article will contain a wide variety of relevant citations to cases from throughout the United States and secondary sources like law review articles. The range and number of citations is always strongly representative but not always guaranteed to be completely comprehensive.

Although similar in tone to the articles in legal encyclopedias, ALR annotations are different in that they are not organized alphabetically, and they tend to delve more deeply into a specific legal principle or doctrine, while, in contrast, encyclopedia articles aim for a broader view of the legal issue. In addition, ALR articles are careful to provide cases on both sides of the legal issue and provide listings of cases according to their jurisdiction.

Since the annotations are published in the order the leading cases were decided, there are various finding aids. The combined ALR Index indexes topics covered from ALR2d to the current series of ALR and all series of ALR Fed. West&#x27;s ALR Digest now follows the classification system of the West American Digest System, and includes headnotes for the reported cases, as well as references to the annotations. For topics covered entirely by federal law, the softbound Quick Index indexes annotations in ALR Fed. The softbound Table of Cases (for a state case) or ALR Federal Table of Cases (for a federal case) provides ALR references for a particular case. A reader may also use the references in American Jurisprudence, Corpus Juris Secundum, and state encyclopedias published by Thomson West to find a more in-depth discussion in ALR. Finally, ALR articles may also be searched on Westlaw.

ALR has been published in several series (the current series is ALR7th) and there are series of ALR Fed (which focuses on federal law). ALR3d through ALR6th and ALR Fed are updated by pocket part supplements (the first series has a citation service, and ALR2d a Later Case Service). Annotations may be superseded by a later annotation in which the editor reanalyzes the law in light of recent developments.

<text>Nogometni klub Hajduk Split, commonly referred to as Hajduk Split (), is a Croatian professional football club based in Split, that competes in the Croatian First League, the top tier in Croatian football. Since 1979, the club&#x27;s home ground has been the 33,987-seater Stadion Poljud. The team&#x27;s traditional home colours are white shirts with blue shorts and blue socks.

The idea to form a football club was started by a group of Split students who were studying in Prague. After observing a game between Slavia and Sparta Prague, the group gathered at the U Fleků tavern and talked of creating a football club at home. When they returned to Split, they put their plan in motion and Hajduk was founded on 13 February 1911. Between the early 1920s and 1940, Hajduk regularly participated in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia national championship. Following World War II and the formation of the Yugoslav league system in 1946, Hajduk went on to spend the entire SFR Yugoslavia period at the top level. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, the club joined the Croatian First League in its inaugural season in 1992, never having been relegated from its top tier. Hajduk is thus the only ex-Yugoslav side to have never been relegated from the top flight since the foundation of the original Yugoslavia, though a number of ex-Yugoslav clubs have long spells in the top flight dating to the SFR Yugoslavia era.

They are one of the most successful teams in Croatia and ex-Yugoslavia, having won nine Yugoslav and six Croatian league championships, in addition to nine Yugoslav and eight Croatian cup titles, and five Croatian supercup titles, without ever being relegated from its country&#x27;s top football league.

The club&#x27;s golden era came in the 1970s, when they won four Yugoslav Leagues and five Yugoslav Cups. Hajduk is also the only club in Yugoslav football history that has won five-straight Yugoslav Cups (between 1972 and 1977), and also the only unbeaten champion (season 1950). Hajduk&#x27;s biggest European achievements are appearances in three European Cup quarter-finals, one UEFA Cup semi-final and one Cup Winners&#x27; Cup semi-final.

The club&#x27;s main rivals are Dinamo Zagreb, with matches between the two referred to as the &quot;Eternal Derby&quot;. Hajduk Split fans are called Torcida Split, who are the oldest organized firm in Europe, being founded in 1950. The inspiration of the name were the Brazilian fans at the 1950 FIFA World Cup, which were called Torcida.

As of 2008, the club is a stock company, although not listed on the public stock exchange, with majority of the stock owned by the City of Split. It is one of two fan-owned sports teams in Croatia, having over 43,000 members in 2016, and reaching 100,000 members in 2023. There are also over 50 Hajduk fan clubs situated mostly across Croatia and Germany, but as far as United States, Ireland and Australia.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The club was founded in its city of Split after the idea to form a football club came to the founders during their time studying in Prague. The idea came to them while at the centuries-old pub U Fleků in Prague (then also part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire). The founders were Fabjan Kaliterna, Lucijan Stella, Ivan Šakić and Vjekoslav Ivanišević. They went to the pub following a match between AC Sparta and SK Slavia and decided it was time their own town founded a professional club. They all knew how popular the sport was in their home city of Split, and how well their friends could play.

The club was officially registered with the authorities on 13 February 1911. While trying to come up with a name for the club (other options being &quot;Velebit&quot;, &quot;Uskok&quot;, &quot;Marjan&quot;...), the students went to their old teacher Josip Barač for advice and according to accounts, after enthusiastically storming into his office, he told them to take the name &quot;Hajduk&quot; which symbolized &quot;that which is best in our people: bravery, humanity, friendship, love of freedom, defiance to powers, and protection of the weak. Be worthy of that great name&quot;.

Hajduks were romanticized bandits that fought the rule of the Ottoman Turks. It is speculated that famed hajduk Andrijica Šimić, who triumphantly arrived in Split in 1902 to cheering crowds (after a long stint in an Austrian prison), was perhaps the inspiration for the name. The founders subsequently designed the club&#x27;s emblem, and a group of Catholic nuns from a monastery in Split, created copies which were distributed to fans. Both the name and the checkered board on the crest were found provocative by the Monarchy, but it eventually allowed them having been convinced that a football club is a good way to train soldiers.

Hajduk gathered the pro-Croat party of citizens of Split, Croat unionists or &quot;puntari&quot;. That is why the club specifically has the name &quot;hrvatski nogometni klub&quot; (&quot;Croatian football club&quot;) and has the Croatian coat-of-arms in its crest. The club itself was against the Austrian-Hungarian government&#x27;s policy of not allowing the unification of the Croatian provinces and keeping them separated (the government and the emperor did not allow the reunion of Dalmatia with the rest of Croatia). Hajduk&#x27;s first opponent were Calcio Spalato, the club of an autonomist party from in Split, and the match ended with a 9–0 (6–0) victory for Hajduk. The first to score for Hajduk was Šime Raunig, legend has it – with his knee.
In 1912, Hajduk played their first match in Zagreb against the HAŠK football club, and lost 3–2. The first international match against an eminent opponent was held in 1913 against Czech club Slavia Prague, which at that time were one of the strongest squads in Europe. Hajduk ended up losing the match 1–13 (0–13). After the formation of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, Hajduk first entered the Yugoslav league in 1923, losing their first and only match that season against SAŠK. However, that same year while on tour in North Africa, Hajduk defeated Marseille 3–2 in their first international match, sparking mass celebrations in Split. The next year, the squad was considered so strong that 10 out of the 11 players which played an international friendly for Yugoslavia against Czechoslovakia were contracted to Hajduk (only exception being the goalkeeper, as Hajduk had an Italian goalkeeper at the time).

In 1926, in honour of the club&#x27;s 15th birthday, composer Ivo Tijardović dedicated an operetta &quot;&quot; to the club, making it the only football club in the world to have its own operetta. Apart from national championship, from 1920 to 1936 Hajduk continuously competed in Dalmatian Championship, having won all but one of them.

Hajduk reached their first period of glory in the late 1920s, when they won their first two Yugoslav championships (1927 and 1929), which earned them a slot in the Central European Cup. Some of the best players in that period were Leo Lemešić and Vladimir Kragić, with Ljubo Benčić managed to become the best goalscorer of the 1927 season. Long-lasting coach of the team was one of clubs greats, Luka Kaliterna. During the 6 January Dictatorship the adjective &quot;Croatian&quot; in &quot;Croatian Football Club&quot; was forcibly replaced by the adjective &quot;Yugoslav&quot; to the dismay of the team. Furthermore, the 1930s proved disastrous for Hajduk, as they won no tournaments or championships, recording only a few successes in international matches.

They did manage to win one title during the Banovina of Croatia era in 1940–41, with an impressive 14–3–1 record. As a Croatian champion the club was about the play the playoffs for Yugoslav championship, but with World War II emerging, the championship was never finished. During this time, Hajduk could have had a fantastic generation led by young Frane Matošić, Ratko Kacijan, as well as prominent Czech international Jiří Sobotka.

=== World War II ===
In April 1941, during World War II, Yugoslavia was invaded, occupied and carved-up by the Axis powers, with Split being annexed directly into Italy. Residents and players were both opposed to the assimilation to Italy, thus the club ceased to compete in defiance throughout the occupation of Split, declining an offer to join the Italian first division under the name &quot;AC Spalato&quot;. Instead, Benito Mussolini founded Societa Calcio Spalato, and renamed the club&#x27;s home ground after his son&#x27;s name. After the capitulation of Italy in 1943, the Partisans temporarily liberated Split and disarmed the Italian garrison, but the German Army quickly re-occupied the city and granted it to the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) they had installed in Zagreb back in 1941. The attitude of the club did not change when the NDH authorities attempted to include Hajduk in the Independent State of Croatia Cup, as NDH earned resentment in Split for allying and partitioning them to Italy. With the Allies invading southern Italy and controlling the Mediterranean, the Adriatic islands became a haven for the resistance, prompting Hajduk&#x27;s rebirth on one of them in 1944.

The club&#x27;s players then joined the Partisan general headquarters on the island of Vis in the Adriatic. On 7 May 1944, on the Feast of Saint Domnius, the patron saint of Split, in presence of Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s and British officers (one of them being Randolph Churchill) Hajduk was formed again and began playing as the official football team of the Yugoslav resistance. They competed with Allied service football teams from across the Adriatic in Italy, where they famously played the British Army in a friendly match in Bari on 23 September, in front at least 40,000 spectators, losing 2–9. The match is considered to be one of the most attended football games during the war years, with a rematch in liberated Split few years after (Hajduk won 1–0). At this time, the club leadership adopted the Partisans&#x27; red star as the badge on the white-and-blue club dress. During 1945, Hajduk embarked on a tourney through Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria and Malta. Traveling roughly 30,000 kilometers, and playing over 90 matches, the club won 74 of them, while at the same time Allied airplanes dropped fliers all over Europe prompting other football clubs to follow Hajduk example. While in Beirut, Charles de Gaulle gave Hajduk the title of honorary team of Free France, the trophy being treasured ever since.

With its proficiency and its &quot;unique Dalmatian spirit&quot;, the club reportedly impressed Tito, who frequently attended matches. After the war, he invited Hajduk to move to the Yugoslav capital Belgrade and become the official Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) team, but the club refused, wanting to continue to play in their hometown of Split. One of their biggest future rivals, FK Partizan, were founded instead. However, Hajduk continued to enjoy the reputation of &quot;Tito&#x27;s favorite&quot; long after the war, and it was because of the friendly relationship with the resistance, it became one of the few Yugoslav football clubs (and the only prominent one) not to be disbanded after the war by the communist government (as was the case with a number of other clubs, especially prominent ones such as BSK, Građanski, Jugoslavija, Concordia, HAŠK and Slavija).

=== Iconic 1950s ===

After World War II, Hajduk continued to play in the Yugoslav championship and its cup. In 1946, they won Croatian championship and established the magazine &quot;Journal of Hajduk&quot;. In 1948–49, Hajduk visited Australia and became the first team from Yugoslavia to play on all continents. The club won the 1950 Yugoslav championship without a single loss, setting a record that no one managed to accomplish before the breakup of Yugoslavia 40 years later. On 28 October 1950, a day before a decisive match against one of its biggest rivals Red Star Belgrade (a 2–1 win), the official fan organization Torcida was founded. It was created by engineering student Vjenceslav Žuvela, who chose the name after the enthusiastic Brazilian fans, and Torcida become the first organized group of supporters in Europe. The following year, reconstruction of &quot;Stari Plac&quot; stadium was finished, and it homed the club for more than three decades.

Consequent seasons showed Hajduk&#x27;s supremacy, but also the political manipulations to prevent them winning the championships. For one, Torcida was viewed as a hostile organization by the communist authorities, which posed a risk to the national consciousness of the new Yugoslavian state. Hajduk&#x27;s leadership was sanctioned, the team&#x27;s captain expelled from the communist party, and Vjenceslav Žuvela imprisoned. Also, during the winter break of the 1952–53 season, following an invitation from Juan Perón, Hajduk went on tour to South America and eventually extended their stay there. This caused them to come home late, but instead of promised delay of games in the Championship, they faced defeat against BSK and a draw with Spartak Subotica as their youth team and couple of veteran players had to play them. Although Hajduk later beat both Red Star (4–1) and Partizan (4–2) in Belgrade, Red Star became the champion by only a two-point margin.

Next season saw a similar occurrence, with players Vladimir Beara and Bernard Vukas arriving late for national team training and receiving a month-long ban from football. Without these essential players, Hajduk lost important matches and Dinamo Zagreb finished as champions. All this prompted club legend Frane Matošić to storm a meeting of the Yugoslav Football Association and say, &quot;Have you at least a gram of integrity?&quot; On 3 April 1955 in Zagreb, Hajduk defeated Dinamo 6–0, recording its biggest win in the derby between the two largest Croatian clubs, and later won the championship. However, the Football Association of Yugoslavia qualified them to the European Mitropa Cup, while Partizan was chosen to participate in the inaugural European Cup.

During the early 1950s, the club had one of its most iconic generation of players, winning three Yugoslav championships. Two such players – goalkeeper Vladimir Beara and Zagreb-born midfielder Bernard Vukas (called &quot;Bajdo&quot;) – were called to represent Team Europe in friendly matches against Great Britain. In one of the matches, Vukas scored a hat-trick. Apart from them, Frane Matošić scored his 729 goals in 739 official and unofficial games, setting a club record likely never to be broken. Other famous players included Božo Broketa, Ljubomir Kokeza, Slavko Luštica and Lenko Grčić.

=== Miserable 1960s and another Golden Generation ===

Generation of 1950s broke down after 1955 title, with Matošić retiring, Beara moving to Red Star Belgrade and Vukas to Italian club Bologna. The 1960s were remembered as some of the hardest times in Hajduk&#x27;s history. In four seasons (1963 to 1966), the club finished no better than tenth and no better than fourth in the next half of the decade. In the 1965–66 season, due to the &quot;Planinić affair&quot; accusing Hajduk of rigging matches during those unsuccessful seasons, five points were deducted (down from the initial penalty of relegation), and Hajduk managed to stay in the top flight with much thanks to Petar Nadoveza, who managed to become the league&#x27;s top scorer with 21 goals. During this era, the club won just one trophy – the 1967 cup, which was also their first Yugoslav cup trophy and send the team to European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup the next year, their first appearance under UEFA-organized international competition. Prominent players of the time included Ante Žanetić (member of 1960 World Soccer Team of the Year), Ivica Hlevnjak, Vinko Cuzzi and Andrija Anković.

From 1970 to 1980, Hajduk had achieved its most successful years in Yugoslavia. The new &quot;Golden Generation&quot; won five consecutive cups and four championships in the period from 1972 to 1979, accompanied by notable international success. In 1971, and after a 16-year wait, Hajduk won the title after a memorable 4–3 away win over Partizan in a decisive match Hajduk were at one time behind 0–3. This unexpected success was achieved with a team of youngsters, and Nadoveza as a league top scorer yet another time. After winning their first out of five consecutive domestic cups in 1972, the team achieved first major international success, playing in the semi-finals of next year&#x27;s Cup Winners&#x27; Cup against Leeds United. The team&#x27;s manager at the time was one of Croatia&#x27;s finest, Branko Zebec.

After Zebec left the club, he was replaced by the young and talented Tomislav Ivić, who would later become the club&#x27;s coaching legend and one of the most successful managers in Europe, winning eight league titles in seven different countries. The first three years under Ivić saw Hajduk win two Yugoslav titles and three cups. In 1976, Hajduk could have won a third-straight Double after defeating the top league team Partizan 6–1 away. However, there was a scandal in the last match of the season when Partizan defeated Olimpija after scoring in the 95th minute of the match (despite UEFA not yet introducing added time for another 20 years) after numerous dubious referee decisions during the match. With the season finishing, Ivić left Hajduk for Ajax, but would return two years later only to win another league title, the club&#x27;s last in the former Yugoslavia.

During these years, Hajduk reached quarter-finals of both the European Cup and Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, with notable home wins against PSV (2–0), Arsenal (2–1) and Saint Etienne (4–1). Notable Hajduk and Yugoslav international players included goalkeepers Ivan Katalinić and Radomir Vukčević; defenders Ivan Buljan (1975 Yugoslav Footballer of the Year), Zoran Vujović, Dragan Holcer, Vilson Džoni, Luka Peruzović and Vedran Rožić; midfielders Jurica Jerković, Dražen Mužinić (1975 Yugoslav Footballer of the Year), Branko Oblak (1974 Ballon d&#x27;Or candidate); and strikers Ivica Šurjak (1976 Yugoslav Footballer of the Year) and Slaviša Žungul. The club&#x27;s respected president at the time was Tito Kirigin.

=== Poljud curse ===

In 1979, Hajduk moved to the newly designed stadium at Poljud, built to host the 1979 Mediterranean Games. However, the 1980s were noticeably less successful, as the club won only three Yugoslav cups before SFR Yugoslavia fell apart in 1991. The club&#x27;s struggles were often linked to their new home stadium, which had athletic running track around the pitch, as opposed to Stari Plac, where supporters could cheer much closer to their team. The club&#x27;s Inaugural season at Poljud saw Hajduk&#x27;s most iconic official international match: the 1979–80 European Cup quarter-finals against eventual finalists Hamburger SV, and a 3–2 home win after losing 0–1 away. Later years saw Hajduk achieve memorable home wins against Valencia (4–1), Bordeaux (4–1), Marseille (2–0), Universitatea Craiova (1–0), Tottenham Hotspur (2–1) and a friendly win against Manchester United (6–0), considered to be United&#x27;s biggest loss outside England. Hajduk also eliminated clubs such as Metz (5–1, 2–2), VfB Stuttgart (3–1, 2–2), Torino (3–1, 1–1), Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk (2–0, 1–0), Universitatea Craiova (0–1, 1–0, 3–1pen) and Sparta Prague (2–0, 0–1), reaching UEFA Cup semi-final in 1984 and quarter-final in 1986. In 1988, during a Cup Winners&#x27; Cup home match with Marseille, releasing tear gas from the crowd caused the game to be canceled at 2–0 for Hajduk to award Marseille a default 0–3 victory; Hajduk was also banned from all UEFA competitions for the next two years.

Apart from international success, domestic results were not as impressive. Although Hajduk spent the entire decade near the top of the league table, competing with Dinamo Zagreb, Partizan and Red Star Belgrade to form what was known as the &quot;Great Yugoslav Four&quot;, the club won no title before Croatia became independent. Prominent players of the time included goalkeepers Ivan Pudar and Zoran Simović (1983 Yugoslav Footballer of the Year); defenders Boro Primorac, Branko Miljuš and Jerko Tipurić; midfielders Blaž Slišković (1985 Yugoslav Footballer of the Year), Ivan Gudelj (1982 Yugoslav Footballer of the Year), Zoran Vulić, Aljoša Asanović, Stipe Andrijašević, Dragutin Čelić; and striker Zlatko Vujović (1981 Ballon d&#x27;Or candidate). By the end of the Yugoslav era, a young generation of future 1998 FIFA World Cup bronze medalists began playing for the club. These included Igor Štimac, Robert Jarni, Alen Bokšić, Nikola Jerkan and Slaven Bilić.

In the wake of national tensions which would eventually lead to Yugoslav Wars, during a tour in Australia, Hajduk restored its traditional emblem with the Croatian checkerboard, omitting the red star and sparking a massive crowd celebrations upon return. In September of that same year, a home match against Partizan would be cancelled in the 73rd minute due to the crowd entering the pitch and burning the Yugoslav flag. Later, on 8 May 1991, Hajduk won the last held Yugoslav Cup final, defeating that year&#x27;s European champions Red Star in Belgrade with a goal scored by Bokšić. Tito&#x27;s trophy for Yugoslav Cup winners was therefore awarded to Hajduk to stay in the club&#x27;s permanent possession.

=== Champions League and financial breakdown ===

In the first four years of the HNL (the Croatian football league), Hajduk became far more successful than rivals Dinamo from Zagreb, winning three league titles, two domestic cups and two supercups, with the 1994–95 season still standing as the most successful since playing in independent Croatia. Hajduk entered that year&#x27;s UEFA Champions League with a mix of young upcoming stars Milan Rapaić, Ivica Mornar, Tomislav Erceg, Goran Vučević and experienced players such as Igor Štimac, Zoran Vulić, Aljoša Asanović and Tonči Gabrić returning to assist them. After entering the group stage, Hajduk finished second behind Benfica, ahead of Steaua București and Anderlecht, before losing in the quarter-finals to eventual champions Ajax (0–0, 0–3). Domestically, the club won its first and (as of yet) last double crown. However, even though the team was performing well, the club was financially poorly managed, accumulating a massive financial loss that led to blocking of club&#x27;s account.

For the next five years, Hajduk stood in the shadow of wealthier and politically privileged rivals Dinamo Zagreb, and the Champions League was no longer realistically within reach. Between 1995 and 2000, the club won zero trophies. After continuous domestic and European failures, Hajduk fans began to seek the dismissal of administration officials and circulated the story about the possible privatization of the club, which at that time did not happen. While arch-rivals Dinamo (then called &quot;Croatia Zagreb&quot;) won titles, Hajduk had problems with the registration of players for the league. Dissatisfaction among the fans grew so much that some broke into the club premises, causing a change in leadership and promises of new beginnings. After the death of the first Croatian president Franjo Tuđman, whom many saw as heavily preferring and financing Croatia Zagreb, 2001 saw Hajduk become champions once more after a memorable 4–2 win against Varteks in Varaždin, a match attended by far more Hajduk fans than locals. Unfortunately, financial conditions in the club were still dire, and the club was often on the precipice of bankruptcy and collapse.

And yet, even if operating with blocked account, chairman Branko Grgić boosted with promises of attractive signings and trophies. Although Hajduk did manage to win Cup in 2003 and league titles in 2004 and 2005, as well as sign Dinamo&#x27;s promising young captain Niko Kranjčar and their legendary manager Miroslav Blažević, when finances and politically driven leadership finally broke down, so did the club&#x27;s results. Hajduk spent rest of the decade finishing behind its rival, with numerous coaching and management changes and reorganizations, players of dubious quality and mediocre international performances, worst of which came after being eliminated by Shelbourne and 0–5 home loss to Debrecen. The election of new chairman Mate Peroš in June 2008, upon which he changed the entire professional staff and reorganized the administration, brought only temporary relief. Hajduk achieved first away win against Dinamo after five-and-a-half years (2–0), but again finished behind their arch-rivals, and reached Croatian Cup finals only to lose to Dinamo once again in a two-game thriller which saw two 3–0 wins by both teams, before Dinamo won 4–3 in penalty shootout. More importantly, the club&#x27;s finances did not radically change until next season, when Hajduk became joint stock company owned by the City of Split. Even if financially secure, newly appointed chairman Joško Svaguša continued the policy of expensive signings and unsustainable expenses to regain the club&#x27;s former glory. In 2010, Hajduk won the Croatian Cup, its first trophy in five years, and later managed to qualify for the group stage of 2010–11 UEFA Europa League which was the first time since 1994 club secured a place in the group stages of UEFA competitions. Home wins against Dinamo București (3–0), Unirea Urziceni (4–1) and Anderlecht (1–0) were, however, just a temporary reminiscence of former successes.

Notable players of 1990s and 2000s include goalkeepers Stipe Pletikosa, Danijel Subašić and Tonči Gabrić; defenders Igor Štimac, Igor Tudor and Darijo Srna; midfielders Milan Rapaić, Nenad Pralija, Dean Računica, Niko Kranjčar, Josip Skoko, Ivan Leko, Srđan Andrić and Senijad Ibričić; and strikers Ardian Kozniku, Nikola Kalinić and Tomislav Erceg.

On 13 February 2011, Hajduk commemorated its 100th anniversary with a massive celebration in Split and all of Croatia, with both Hajduk players and fans honouring the club. The entire city was decorated with Hajduk banners, flags, posters and paraphernalia, and there was a spectacular firework show over Split. Hajduk played a friendly game with Slavia Prague to honour Hajduk&#x27;s Czech origins, losing 0–2.

=== Naš Hajduk ===
All this time supporters led by Torcida led a struggle to end what they considered to be politically driven management of the club, and install experts to save Hajduk. In 2009, they started an initiative called &quot;Dite puka&quot; (People&#x27;s Child) that should have prompted fans to buy up the club&#x27;s shares and gain control of the club, which at the time didn&#x27;t happen. However, in July 2011, inspired by examples in Germany and Sweden and organized under the association &quot;Naš Hajduk&quot; (Our Hajduk), fans managed to gain rights of organizing elections for members of the club&#x27;s supervisory board, making Hajduk only fan-owned football club in Croatian First League, and one of only two in former Yugoslavia (the other being nearby HNK Trogir).

In 2012, the club fell into yet another financial trouble caused by former Hajduk presidents, leaving it with more than 100 million kunas in debt, and one town meeting away from being bankrupt. After forming lines in front of the City Hall on 15 October 2012, fans convinced the town leaders to sign a loan insurance to the newly elected chairman Marin Brbić and start the club&#x27;s long needed financial recovery. Since then, according to the club&#x27;s annual financial report, Hajduk is under continuous financial and managerial recovery. On 1 April 2015, Brbić was sacked by the club&#x27;s supervisory board and on 18 May replaced by Ivan Kos.

Notable successes include 2–0 away win over Internazionale and winning the 2012–13 Croatian Cup. By the end of 2016, the club numbered 43.339 members, more than any club in the region.

=== 2020s ===
Hajduk&#x27;s poor European results continued, losing to Maltese side Gżira United in the first qualifying round of the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League and to Kazakh side FC Tobol in the second qualifying round of the 2021–22 UEFA Europa Conference League.

In February 2021, Hajduk signed Marko Livaja. In December 2021, Prva HNL captains voted Marko Livaja as the best footballer in the league, becoming the Hajduk player to win the best player award since 2003. Livaja finished the 2021–22 Prva HNL season as top goalscorer with 28 goals. It is a Hajduk record for a single season, beating Leo Lemešić&#x27;s tally of 26 in 1934–35 and Zlatko Vujović with 25. Livaja was awarded the Prva HNL Player of the Year (Tportal) award for 2022. In doing so, he became the first player to win the award in consecutive years and first since Sammir in 2012 to be a repeat winner. For the 2022–23 season, Livaja was again the top goalscorer in the league with 19 goals, as Hajduk finished runners-up in the competition.

Hajduk won back to back Croatian Cups in 2021–22 and 2022–23.

In September 2023, Hajduk announced that it had achieved 100,000 members for the first time in the club&#x27;s history.

On 3 April 2024, Hajduk lost 0–1 to Dinamo in the semi-final of the Croatian Cup at home, having lost by the same scoreline, at the same location, against the same opposition four days earlier. The results left Hajduk out of the cup and out of the title race, having led the league for 13 of the first 19 rounds. Crowd trouble after the game, including a pitch invasion and clashes with police lead to some 50 arrests. The collapse of the title chase followed the high-profile January signings of Ivan Perišić, Josip Brekalo and László Kleinheisler.

On 8 April 2024, club president Lukša Jakobušić departed Hajduk at the decision of the supervisory board. The same day, head coach Mislav Karoglan also left the club. Shortly after, sporting director Mindaugas Nikoličius resigned from his role, ending the Jakobušić-Nikoličius era at Hajduk.

On 25 April 2024, Ivan Bilić was announced as the new president of Hajduk Split. One of Bilić&#x27;s first moves was to appoint recently retired Hajduk striker, and former Croatian international, Nikola Kalinić as the new sporting director in late May. Kalinić&#x27;s first move as sporting director was to appoint Gennaro Gattuso as head coach of the club in June 2024. As a player, Gattuso was a two-time UEFA Champions League winner with AC Milan and a World cup winner with Italy. Gattuso signed a two-year contract with Hajduk.

== Stadium ==

Hajduk&#x27;s home ground is one of the two largest stadiums in Croatia, designed by architect Boris Magaš, chosen among 20 other projects in a 1975 competition. The stadium was built for the 1979 Mediterranean Games, but was also a venue for the 1990 European Athletics Championships and the 2010 IAAF Continental Cup. The stadium is affectionately known to the locals as the &quot;Poljudska ljepotica&quot; (&quot;Poljud Beauty&quot;). The largest crowd recorded was in 1980 at a match against Hamburger SV – 52,000 spectators. Two years later, after the stadium was fully completed, its capacity was increased to 62,000 for a derby against Dinamo Zagreb.

From 1911 to 1979, Hajduk played on a stadium called Kod stare Plinare, used today by RK Nada rugby club. The stadium&#x27;s first name was Krajeva njiva, but after club moved to Poljud, the old ground has become known in Split as the &quot;Stari Plac&quot; or &quot;Staro Hajdukovo&quot; (&quot;Old Hajduk&#x27;s Place&quot;). During this time, the stadium hosted a match between Yugoslavia and the Netherlands in the UEFA Euro 1972 qualifying tournament. Hajduk supporters who would later reestablish the once forbidden name of Torcida, were situated in the east stands. 3,148 games were played on it, with 9,542 goals scored, 11 championships and six cups have been won.

== Crest and colours ==

=== Colours ===
Hajduk played its first game in a strip with red and white vertical stripes, which symbolized the Croatian coat of arms. The former Austrian City Council did not want to be seen as partisan and would not allow club colors to be made up from the emergent Croatian tricolour. Hajduk changed its kit design to red and blue vertical stripes with white &quot;Hajduk&quot; written in the middle. 1914 saw the club choose a white shirt, blue shorts and socks; a combination that symbolizes white sails on a blue sea. The color white has since then become a symbol for the club, along with the nickname &#x27;Bili&#x27; (&#x27;Whites&#x27;).

Its away strip consists of red and blue shirts with vertical stripes (sometimes narrow, sometimes wide), blue shorts and socks, to symbolize the Croatian flag. From 2008 to 2011, the stripes were made horizontal. Although UEFA has not introduced compulsory registration of the third set of colours, one possibility was shirts of vertical red and white stripes, but were not adopted due to the resemblance of club colours of Red Star Belgrade. Third set of colours was therefore often a combination of first two (most often completely white outfit), until a new gray design, composed of small triangular fan flags was introduced in 2015.

At one time the main colours were to be a combination of navy blue, white with blue horizontal stripes, but this kit was only sporadically worn by goalkeepers Stipe Pletikosa and Danijel Subašić.

=== Crest ===
Hajduk&#x27;s crest consists of the Croatian checkerboard with 25 red and white checkers bordered by a circle of blue ribbon, with two white vertical lines on each side. The words &quot;Hajduk&quot; and &quot;Split&quot; are written above and below the checkerboard respectively. The symbolism of the white vertical lines is still under discussion, with theories such as being a symbol of the four founders, the equals sign or quotation marks.

The modern crest is almost identical to the one created in 1911. The original was designed by one of club&#x27;s founders Vjekoslav Ivanišević. It was then taken to Ana, the sister of the Kaliterna brothers who took a drawing of the crest to a convent where nuns created 20–30 pieces by hand. The crest first appeared in public in 1926 during a performance of the Tijardović opera &quot;&quot; as part of the scenery.

However, Hajduk did not wear the original crest before World War II as it was not obligatory at the time. After the club&#x27;s rebirth following the end of WWII the new crest became just a red star a symbol of anti-fascism which Hajduk stood up for during the war. In 1960, a new crest was made, similar to the old one but with the red star in the middle instead of the former red and white traditional checkerboard. In 1990, while on tour in Australia, the original crest was returned and has been used ever since.

== Shirt sponsors and manufacturers ==

== Supporters ==

Hajduk Split supporters, Torcida, were formed on 28 October 1950 by a group of students in Zagreb, namely Ante Dorić, Ante Ivanišević and Vjenceslav Žuvela, and are the oldest organized supporters group in Europe. They took their name from the Brazilian fan group they idolized, which comes from the Portuguese &#x27;torcer&#x27; which means &#x27;to cheer on&#x27;. &quot;Hajduk lives forever&quot; is their slogan.

Torcida members and other fervent fans gather in the north stand at the Poljud stadium from where they support their club. The &#x27;Heart of Hajduk&#x27; () is an annual football prize which was established in 1994 and is officially awarded by the Hajduk Split supporters&#x27; to the team&#x27;s best performing player during the season. It is awarded during the annual futsal competition Torcida Cup.

In-between clubs Hajduk developed kinship with SK Slavia Prague.

== In popular culture ==
Hajduk Split features as the central theme of the television series &quot;Velo Misto&quot; (1980) and is one of the only football clubs to have a period drama filmed about its history.

== Rivalries ==
Today, Hajduk&#x27;s biggest rivals are Dinamo Zagreb, as the matches between the two teams are referred to as &quot;Eternal Derby&quot;. Former major rivalries used to include Serbian clubs Crvena Zvezda and Partizan who along with Hajduk and Dinamo were part of the so-called Yugoslav &quot;Big Four&quot;, the biggest and most successful clubs in the former Yugoslavia.

== Players ==
Croatian teams are restricted to fielding at most six foreign players in the first eleven during the domestic league and cup matches. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; players who also hold Croatian citizenship are specifically noted.

<text>The Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company (BRC&amp;W) was a railway locomotive and carriage builder, founded in Birmingham, England and, for most of its existence, located at nearby Smethwick, with the factory divided by the boundary between the two places. The company was established in 1854.

==Production==
BRC&amp;W made not only carriages and wagons, but a range of vehicles, from aeroplanes and military gliders to buses, trolleybuses and tanks. Nevertheless, it is as a builder of railway rolling stock that the company is best remembered, exporting to most parts of the new and old worlds. It supplied vehicles to all four of the pre-nationalisation &quot;big four&quot; railway companies (LMS, SR, LNER and GWR), British Rail, Pullman (some of which are still in use) and Wagons-Lits, plus overseas railways with diverse requirement including Egypt, India, Iraq, Malaya, Mandate Palestine, South Africa and Nigeria. The company even built, in 1910, Argentina&#x27;s presidential coach, which still survives, and once carried Eva Perón. Before World War II, the company had built steam-, petrol- and diesel-powered railcars for overseas customers, not to mention bus bodies for Midland Red, and afterwards developed more motive power products, including BR&#x27;s Class 26, Class 33 (both diesel) and Class 81 (electric) locomotives. Examples of all three types are preserved.

===Wartime production===
The company built hospital trains during the Second Boer War. Handley Page Type O bombers and Airco DH.10 Amiens were built during World War I.

During World War II, the company had a major impact on tank production as one of the many companies building the A10 Cruiser, Valentine, Churchill, Cromwell and Challenger tanks. They led the design and production of the Cromwell tank in liaison with Rolls-Royce and Rover on the Meteor engine.

The company also built Hamilcar gliders in 1939–1945.

==Locomotives==
Some of the locomotives and multiple units built by the company are listed below:

===Diesel Locomotives===
* 14 Commonwealth Railways NSU class in 1954. Works numbers DEL1–14
* 5 similar locos for Sierra Leone Development Corporation in 1954 (works numbers DEL 15–19), plus one more in 1962 (works number DEL259)
* 12 Córas Iompair Éireann 101 class in 1956–1957 (works numbers DEL20–31)
* 13 locos for Ghana Railway And Harbours Administration (works numbers DEL32–44)
* 47 British Rail Class 26 in 1958–1959 (works numbers DEL45–91)
* 98 British Rail Class 33 in 1960–1962 (works numbers DEL92–189)
* 69 British Rail Class 27 in 1961–1962 (works numbers DEL190–258)
* 1 British Rail D0260 &quot;Lion&quot; in 1962 (works number DEL260)

===Electric Locomotives===
*British Rail Class 81

===Diesel Multiple Units===

*British Rail Class 104
*British Rail Class 110 (with Drewry Car Co.)
*British Rail Class 118
*Egypt State Railways 3 &amp; 5 Car Railcars

===Electric Multiple Units===
*London Underground 1923 Tube Stock
*London Underground 1938 Tube Stock
*London Underground 1956 Tube Stock
*London Underground 1962 Tube Stock The order was transferred to Metro-Cammell owing to the financial problems at BRCW.
*London Underground CO/CP Stock
*London Underground R47 Stock
*London Underground T Stock
*LMS/BR Wirral &amp; Mersey Class 503

==Closure==
In the years before 1963, the company had built an extensive number of locomotives, diesel multiple unit trains, and Underground cars, but it then became apparent that fewer rolling stock orders were to be expected, and the company restructured itself as an industrial landlord and financing business. The self-funded main line locomotive prototype &quot;Lion&quot; was a particular disappointment. Powered by a Sulzer diesel engine, it was pitted against another self-funded prototype, &quot;Falcon&quot;, built by Brush at Loughborough, which had twin Maybach engines. After trials, British Railways preferred the BRCW approach, but ordered them to be built by Brush Traction, and they became British Rail Class 47.

==Preserved BRCW locomotive and units==
===Australia===
The Commonwealth Railway used a large number of NSU Class locomotives built by the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, several are preserved.

===Ireland===
===United Kingdom===

Several ex-British Rail locomotives are preserved.

<text>The Illinois-Wabash Company, formally known as the United Illinois and Wabash Land Company, was a company formed in from the merger of the Illinois Company and the Wabash Company. The two companies had been established in order to purchase land from Native Americans in the Illinois Country, a region of North America acquired by Great Britain in 1763. The Illinois Company purchased two large tracts of land in 1773; the Wabash Company purchased two additional tracts in 1775.

Because the Royal Proclamation of 1763 forbade private purchase of Native American lands, Great Britain refused to recognize these transactions. Following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, officials of the merged Illinois-Wabash Company appealed to both Virginia (which claimed the Illinois Country) and to the United States to recognize their land purchases but were unsuccessful. After the United States bought the land in question from Native Americans and resold it, the matter eventually went to the Supreme Court of the United States. In &quot;Johnson v. McIntosh&quot; (1823), the Court ruled that the U.S. government, following earlier British precedent, would not recognize private purchases of native lands, and that Illinois-Wabash Company&#x27;s purchases were therefore invalid.

==Land purchases and British denial of title==
In the middle of the 18th century, merchants and land speculators in the British Empire were looking to expand beyond the Appalachian Mountains into the interior of North America. Companies such as the Ohio Company of Virginia had been formed for this purpose, but rivalry between the British and the French for access to the region led to the outbreak of the French and Indian War (1754–1763), interrupting the activities of the companies. After the British victory in the war, the Crown issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which sought to organize and stabilize the vast new territory won from France. In order to prevent the conditions which had produced the war and its sequel, Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion (1763–1766), the British government forbade private individuals or companies from purchasing land from American Indians. Thereafter, only royal officials would be permitted to conduct treaties in order to buy Native American lands.

In 1768, a group of prominent merchants from Philadelphia began doing business in the Illinois Country, selling provisions to American Indians and British troops. In 1773, William Murray, the merchants&#x27; agent in Illinois, learned of a British legal opinion known as the Camden-Yorke Opinion. This opinion made quite an impact in North America because it was interpreted by some to suggest that private purchases of land from American Indians would now be recognized by the British Crown. With this in mind, Murray and his Philadelphia employers organized the Illinois Company and, on 5 July 1773, purchased two tracts of land from the Kaskaskia, Peoria, and Cahokia tribes.

British officials refused to recognize the legality of the Illinois Company&#x27;s purchase–the interpretation of Camden-Yorke circulating in America had been misleading. In April 1774, Murray turned to his kinsman, Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of Virginia. Dunmore agreed to lend support to the company&#x27;s purchases in exchange for a piece of the action. Murray then formed the Wabash Company with Lord Dunmore as a member. On October 18, 1775, an agent for the Wabash Company purchased two tracts of land along the Wabash River from the Piankeshaw tribe called the &#x27;Piankeshaw Deed&#x27;. Soon after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, however, Dunmore was forced to flee Virginia, and the companies were compelled to turn to new officials for recognition of its purchases.

==Merger and American denial of title==
During the war the British had sparsely garrisoned the Illinois Country, which was far away from the main area of action. In July 1778, Colonel George Rogers Clark and a small force took possession of the region on behalf of Virginia, which, by virtue of its colonial charter, had a claim to the entire Illinois Country. In December of that year, Murray presented a memorial to the Virginia legislature, informing them of the land claims of the Illinois and Wabash companies. In order to consolidate their lobbying efforts, the two companies merged on March 13, 1779, becoming the United Illinois and Wabash Land Company. The cause of the company was promoted by influential Americans such as James Wilson and Robert Morris, who had become investors. Other notable members included Silas Deane, Samuel Chase, and Maryland governor Thomas Johnson.

Despite these political connections, Virginia declined to recognize the Illinois-Wabash purchases and instead created the &quot;County of Illinois&quot; in November 1779. Thus rejected, the company turned its efforts to lobbying the new national government of the United States. This issue became part of a wider debate in Congress about the western boundaries of states, with the states without western lands demanding that Virginia and other states with large land claims cede these lands to the national government. Virginia ceded her western land claims to the United States in 1784. Despite repeated appeals by the Illinois-Wabash Company, which were regularly renewed into the early 19th century, the U.S. government declined to recognize their land claims. The company faded away.

The United States eventually bought the lands in question from Native Americans in treaties conducted by William Henry Harrison. After the War of 1812, the United States began to issue land patents to settlers. In 1820, the executor of the estate of an investor in the Illinois-Wabash Company filed suit against William McIntosh, one of the largest of the new landowners. The lawsuit claimed that McIntosh had bought land rightfully owned by the Illinois-Wabash Company, based on the earlier purchase from the Indians. In 1823, the issue made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Johnson v. McIntosh&quot;. The Court decided in favor of McIntosh, ruling that private purchases of native lands were not valid. The decision brought to an end the story of the Illinois-Wabash Company.

<text>The Rasht Valley (; ) is located in Tajikistan and composes a significant portion of the Region of Republican Subordination, including the five districts of Lakhsh, Rasht, Tavildara now Sangvor, Tajikobod and Nurabad. Historically the Rasht Valley has been called Karotegin or Karategin. During the 1992-1997 Tajikistan Civil War, the region was a stronghold for forces opposed to the government of Emomalii Rahmon and became the site of numerous battles. Notably, four members of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan were murdered in the Garm district in 1998.

From the 1920s until 1955 the Rasht Valley was within the Gharm Oblast.

==History==
Karotegin is the historic name of the Rasht Valley and a historic political region in pre-Soviet Central Asia that is today part of Tajikistan. The Karotegin region was also named Garm, though Garm is also the name of a city and a regional group of Garmi Tajiks. Karotegin frequently appears in its alternative spellings, Qaratagin, Qarategin, Qaratigin, Karategin, Karatigin and Karateghin, in literature from the 1990s and earlier. Karategin was an independent region in Central Asia for many centuries. The native princes, who claimed to be descended from Alexander the Great, were independent until 1868, although their allegiance was claimed in an ineffective way by Kokand. The Emirate of Bukhara took advantage of internal political feuds and conquered the region, along with Darvaz, in 1877.

The Karotegin consisted of a highland district bounded on the north by Samarkand and Kokand, on the east by Ferghana, on the south by Darvaz and on the west by Hissar and other Bokharian provinces. Traditionally rough woolen cloth and mohair were woven by the natives, who also made excellent firearms and other weapons. Gold was mined in various places and there were salt-pits in the mountains. The chief town, Garm, situated on a hill on the right bank of the Vakhsh River, was a place of some 2,000 inhabitants, . The population was about 60,000 in 1911; five-sixths were composed of Tajiks while the remainder were Kyrgyz, who reside in what is today the Jirgatol district of Tajikistan. Historically it was difficult for the people of the Karotegin to communicate with neighboring lands except between the months of May and September.

The 1949 Khait earthquake resulted in the Khait landslide, which killed over 30,000 people.

===Karategin-Kyrgyz Confederation===
The Karategin-Kyrgyz Confederation is a Kyrgyz-led tribal alliance established in the Karategin province of Tajikistan. Twelve thousand Kyrgyz families previously living in the Karakurum and Kerulen regions of Mongolia had come to the Karategin region in the 16th century.

====Background====
On January 12, 1636, a group of twelve Kyrgyz pagan members of the Karategin biy tribe tried to settle in Balkh, in north Afghanistan. Shortly after, they attempted to return to their lands because the city was shaped deeply Islamic. The Khan of the Khanate of Bukhara, Nadr Muhammad Khan, sent the governor of Fergana (Haji Atalik) to the region to seize Karategin. In this way, Karategin became an integral part of the Bukhara Khanate and the Kyrgyz pilgrims were allowed to settle. These Kyrgyz later accepted Islam as their faith. Later on, the Kyrgyz tribal members attacked the city of Kulob. During that time Dormon Uzbeks lived in the city, but they lost the war and fled to Balkh, Afghanistan. The Kyrgyzs have expanded their territory far into the northern boundaries of Afghanistan.

<text>Moleskine (Italian pronunciation: ) is an Italian manufacturer, papermaker, and product designer. It was founded in 1997 by Maria Sebregondi and is based in Milan, Italy. It produces and designs luxury notebooks, as well as planners, sketchbooks, leather backpacks, holdalls, journals, wallets, various accessories, and stationery.

Moleskine&#x27;s notebooks are stylised to follow the aesthetics of a &#x27;traditional&#x27; black notebook with rounded corners and ivory-coloured paper. They are bound in cardboard with a sewn spine that allows the notebook to lie flat. An elastic band is used to seal, and a ribbon bookmark is included along with an expandable pocket inside the rear cover, which is packed in a paper banderole.

Bruce Chatwin&#x27;s name is used to sell Moleskine notebooks. Chatwin wrote in &quot;The Songlines&quot; of little black oilskin-covered notebooks that he bought in Paris and called &quot;moleskines&quot;. The name Moleskine does not have an official pronunciation.

== History ==
In the mid-1990s, Maria Sebregondi pitched the idea of resurrecting the iconic notebooks to the company Modo &amp; Modo, despite the shelves of stationery stores already being stocked with blank books at the time. As a result, Modo &amp; Modo trademarked the Moleskine brand and began production of 5,000 notebooks, officially reintroducing them in 1997.

By 1998, Modo &amp; Modo were producing 30,000 notebooks a year and expanded their market, distributing their products across Europe. By 2000 Modo &amp; Modo SpA had an office with a small staff and sales of €20M ($26M) in Milan. In 2004, Moleskine notebooks were exported to Japan, and from there, distribution to Asia began.

In 2006, the company was purchased by the European private equity firm now known as Syntegra Capital. At that time, it was reported that the company’s small staff was unable to keep up with demand. In August 2006, the French investment fund Société Générale Capital purchased Modo &amp; Modo SpA, and invested in its expansion. The company name changed to Moleskine Srl.

By July 2012, Moleskine collections were distributed in 22,000 stores across 95 countries. In March 2013 the company announced an IPO at the Borsa Italiana. Moleskine became a joint-stock company and is now Moleskine SpA; it is still headquartered in Milan.

At the end of September 2016, the Belgian investment group D&#x27;Ieteren acquired a 41% stake in Moleskine. After having launched a public takeover offer on the remaining shares of the company, D&#x27;Ieteren crossed the 95% threshold, which gives it the right to launch a squeeze out procedure in order to gain full control of Moleskine. D&#x27;Ieteren&#x27;s intention is to delist Moleskine from the Milan Stock Exchange.

==Products==

=== Notebooks and journals ===

Moleskine&#x27;s notebooks are based on notebooks distributed in Paris during the 19th and 20th centuries, handmade by small French bookbinders who supplied the local stationery shops around the turn of the 20th century. They are fashioned after author Bruce Chatwin&#x27;s descriptions of the notebooks he used. Moleskine items are designed in Italy with most of them being printed, stitched and assembled in China. Since 2008, some components have been manufactured in Volant, Cahiers and Folio hard covers in Turkey, watercolour paper in France, and some components in Vietnam. The paper used in Moleskine products is Forest Stewardship Council certified and acid-free. Since August 2010, all Moleskine products, offered to retailers in California and throughout the world, comply with the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986. After concerns in 2008 about PVC traces in some notebooks, all items are now PVC-free.

=== Digital ===
Moleskine manufactures device covers that emulate the trademarked notebooks.

In August 2012, Moleskine partnered with Evernote to produce a digital-friendly notebook with specially designed pages and stickers for smartphone syncing.

In October 2012, Moleskine forayed into print on demand with Moleskine Photo Books, a collaboration with MILK Books that lets users upload their own photos into a Moleskine notebook-style photo book.

In 2016, Moleskine launched &quot;The Smart Writing Set&quot; with Evernote and Livescribe. The notebook costs approximately $200 and is able to automatically transfer notes from the notebook onto a laptop or smartphone.

===Timepage===
Timepage is a mobile planner and calendar app developed by Moleskine. It organizes events from calendars on mobile devices and syncs information, contact info, and weather forecasting. The app includes a Heat map calendar and timeline, and has included access to Uber.

=== Communities ===
The Moleskine brand is supported by worldwide communities of enthusiasts who write, sketch, paint and draw on Moleskine notebooks. Communities often share images of decorated pages through blogs, social networks or photo and video sharing sites as well as Moleskine&#x27;s own service &quot;MyMoleskine&quot;, through which customers can interact with company staff.

== Cafés ==
In early 2018, the company announced that it would be opening up Moleskine cafés in major cities such as Beijing, London, New York and Hamburg. The first café was opened in Milan, where the company is originally from.

<text>The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC) is a government agency and the transit authority and the transportation-planning agency for Southern Nevada. It was founded by the Nevada Legislature in 1965.

==RTC Transit==

The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC) transit fleet consists of 38 routes served by 387 vehicles. In 2009, RTC Transit carried 57,738,930 passengers in the greater Las Vegas Valley. RTC Transit consists of 33 fixed route service routes, four express service routes, and the Las Vegas Strip route The Deuce.

==Services==
===Transportation===
* RTC Transit - All public transportation routes available to the public
* RTC Paratransit - A service for disabled riders
* SilverSTAR &amp; FDR - A service for senior riders
* Bikeshare - A bike rental service
* Transit Centers and Park &amp; Ride Facilities - Transportation hubs and park and ride lots located throughout the Las Vegas Valley

===Programs===
* Bike &amp; Ride - A training program to train riders to use a bicycle and buses altogether
* Club Ride - A free carpooling program
* Mobility Training - A group training program to help disabled riders learn to use public transportation

==RTC Commuter Services==
The RTC provides a commuter service the CX that transports passengers from the Centennial Hills Transit Center and Park &amp; Ride in the northwest, to Downtown, the Strip, and ends at the UNLV campus in the southeast and the DVX from downtown to the veteran&#x27;s hospital.

==Security==
Security on the residential, express, and strip transit routes, and all RTC terminals and select platforms is provided by the private security firm Marksman Security under contract to the RTC. The previous contract holders were Allied-Barton until July 2020 and Wackenhut Security (now G4S) until losing the contract in 2009. Since then, increased crime in the Las Vegas Metropolitan area has prompted an increased security presence in the transit system as a whole. The officers’ primary task is that of fare enforcement, but will also engage in enforcing other RTC policies and rules, to include the removal of loiterers, those causing disturbances, and those posing safety hazards at RTC stops and facilities, and insuring the general safety of staff and customers.

On December 15, 2014, a fatal shooting occurred when Christopher Boudinot shot an RTC security officer. The officer returned fire and fatally shot Boudinot. The transit officer was rushed to UMC and eventually recovered while Boudinot was declared dead at the scene.

<doc id="861258" wikidata="Q420089" url="?curid=861258" title="Ribonucleotide reductase">
<text>Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), also known as ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides. It catalyzes this formation by removing the 2&#x27;-hydroxyl group of the ribose ring of nucleoside diphosphates (or triphosphates depending on the class of RNR). This reduction produces deoxyribonucleotides. Deoxyribonucleotides in turn are used in the synthesis of DNA. The reaction catalyzed by RNR is strictly conserved in all living organisms. Furthermore, RNR plays a critical role in regulating the total rate of DNA synthesis so that DNA to cell mass is maintained at a constant ratio during cell division and DNA repair. A somewhat unusual feature of the RNR enzyme is that it catalyzes a reaction that proceeds via a free radical mechanism of action. The substrates for RNR are ADP, GDP, CDP and UDP. dTDP (deoxythymidine diphosphate) is synthesized by another enzyme (thymidylate kinase) from dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate).

== Structure ==
Ribonucleotide reductases are divided into three classes. Class I RNR enzymes are constructed from large alpha subunit and small beta subunits which associate to form an active heterodimeric tetramer. By reducing NDPs to 2&#x27;-dNDPs, the enzyme catalyses the de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), which are precursors to DNA synthesis and essential for cell proliferation. Class II RNRs produce a 5&#x27;-deoxyadenosyl radical by homolytic cleavage of the C-Co bond in adenosylcobalamin. In addition, Class III RNRs contain a stable glycyl radical.

Humans carry Class I RNRs. The alpha subunit is encoded by the RRM1 gene while there are two isoforms of the beta subunit, encoded by the RRM2 and RRM2B genes:
Each Class I alpha monomer consists of three domains:
* one mainly helical domain comprising the 220 N-terminal residues,
* a second large ten-stranded α/β structure comprising 480 residues,
* and a third small five-stranded α/β structure comprising 70 residues.
In Pfam, the second domain has been interpreted as two separate domains:
* a shorter all-alpha N-terminal domain,
* and a longer barrel C-terminal domain.
The Class I beta subunit usually contains a di-metal center and a stable tyrosyl radical. In humans, the beta subunit relies on a di-iron cofactor. In &quot;E. coli&quot;, the tyrosyl radical is located at position 122 (Y122) providing the stable radical for the Class I RNR2 subunits. In &quot;A. aegypti&quot;, this tyrosyl radical is located at position 184 (Y184). The tyrosyl radical is deeply buried inside the protein in a hydrophobic environment, located close to the iron center that is used in the stabilization of a tyrosyl radical. The structure of two μ-oxo-linked irons is dominated by ligands that serve as iron binding sites: four carboxylates aspartate (D146), glutamate (E177, E240, and E274)] and two histidines (H180 and H277). Association occurs between the C-terminus of RNR2 and the C-terminus of RNR1. Enzymatic activity is dependent on association of the RNR1 and RNR2 subunits. The active site consists of the active dithiol groups from the RNR1 as well as the diferric center and the tyrosyl radical from the RNR2 subunit.

Other residues of RNR2, such as aspartate (D273), tryptophan (W48), and tyrosine (Y356) further stabilize the active-site tyrosyl radical thus allowing electron transfer. These residues help in the transfer of the radical electron from tyrosine (Y122) of RNR2 to cysteine (C439) of RNR1. The electron transfer begins on RNR2 tyrosine (Y122) and continues in RNR2 to tryptophan (W48), which is separated from RNR1 tyrosine (Y731) by 2.5 nanometers. Electron transfer from RNR2 to RNR1 occurs via tyrosine (Y356 to Y731) and continues on through tyrosine (Y730) to cysteine (C439) in the active site. Site-directed mutations of the RNR primary structure indicate that all residues cited above participate in the long distance transfer of the free radical to the active site.

In &quot;A. aegypti&quot; mosquitoes, RNR1 retains most of the crucial amino acid residues, including aspartate (D64) and valine (V292 or V284), that are necessary in allosteric regulation; proline (P210 and P610), leucine (L453 and L473), and methionine (M603) residues that are located in the hydrophobic active site; cysteine (C225, C436 and C451) residues that are involved in removal of a hydrogen atom and transfer of the radical electron at the active site; cysteine (C225 and C436), asparagine (N434), and glutamate (E441) residues that bind the ribonucleotide substrate; tyrosine (Y723 and Y743) residues that dictate the radical transfer; and cysteine (C838 and C841) residues that are used in the regeneration of dithiol groups in the active site.

The yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; possesses a minor isoform of large subunit of ribonucleotide-diphosphate reductase under the designation RNR3 or &quot;YIL066C&quot; on the yeast chromosome IX. It is a paralog of the yeast RNR1, which likely arose from a whole genome duplication event. The RNR complex catalyzes the rate-limiting step in dNTP synthesis, regulated by DNA replication and DNA damage checkpoint pathways via localization of small subunits.

== Function ==
The enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the de novo synthesis of dNDPs. Catalysis of ribonucleoside 5’-diphosphates (NDPs) involves a reduction at the 2’-carbon of ribose 5-phosphate to form the 2’-deoxy derivative-reduced 2’-deoxyribonucleoside 5’-diphosphates (dNDPs). This reduction is initiated with the generation of a free radical. Following a single reduction, RNR requires electrons donated from the dithiol groups of the protein thioredoxin. Regeneration of thioredoxin occurs when nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) provides two hydrogen atoms that are used to reduce the disulfide groups of thioredoxin.

Three classes of RNR have similar mechanisms for the reduction of NDPs, but differ in the domain that generates the free radical, the specific metal in the metalloprotein structure, and the electron donors. All classes use free-radical chemistry. Class I reductases use an iron center with ferrous to ferric conversion to generate a tyrosyl free radical. Reduction of NDP substrates occurs under aerobic conditions. Class I reductases are divided into IA and IB due to differences in regulation. Class IA reductases are distributed in eukaryotes, eubacteria, bacteriophages, and viruses. Class IB reductases are found in eubacteria. Class IB reductases can also use a radical generated with the stabilization of a binuclear manganese center. Class II reductases generate the free radical 5’-deoxyadenosyl radical from cobalamin (coenzyme B12) and have a simpler structure than class I and class III reductases. Reduction of NDPs or ribonucleotide 5’-triphosphates (NTPs) occurs under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Class II reductases are distributed in archaebacteria, eubacteria, and bacteriophages. Class III reductases use a glycine radical generated with the help of an S-adenosyl methionine and an iron sulphur center. Reduction of NTPs is limited to anaerobic conditions. Class III reductases are distributed in archaebacteria, eubacteria, and bacteriophages. Organisms are not limited to having one class of enzymes. For example, &quot;E. coli&quot; have both class I and class III RNR.

== Catalytic reduction mechanism ==
 The mechanism that is currently accepted for the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides is depicted in the following scheme. The first step involves the abstraction of the 3’- H of substrate 1 by radical Cys439. Subsequently, the reaction involves the elimination of one water molecule from carbon C-2’ of the ribonucleotide, catalyzed by Cys225 and Glu441. In the third step there is a hydrogen atom transfer from Cys225 to carbon C-2’ of the 2’-ketyl radical 3, after previous proton transfer from Cys462 to Cys225. At the end of this step, a radical anionic disulfide bridge and the closed-shell ketone intermediate 4 are obtained. This intermediate has been identified during the conversion of several 2’-substituted substrate analogues, as well as with the natural substrate interacting with enzyme mutants. The next step is the oxidation of the anionic disulfide bridge, with concomitant reduction of the substrate, generating 5. The spin density shifts from the sulphur atoms to the C-3&#x27; atom of the substrate, with simultaneous proton transfer from Glu441 to carbon C-3&#x27;. The last step is the reverse of the first step and involves a hydrogen transfer from Cys439 to C-3’, regenerating the initial radical and resulting in the final product 6.
Theoretical models of some steps of these mechanisms using the full model of the R1 protein can be found at the studies performed by Cerqueira &quot;et al.&quot;.

== Regulation ==
Class I RNR comprises RNR1 and RNR2 subunits, which can associate to form a heterodimeric tetramer. RNR1 contains both allosteric sites, mediating regulation of substrate specificity and activity. Depending on the allosteric configuration, one of the four ribonucleotides binds to the active site.

Regulation of RNR is designed to maintain balanced quantities of dNTPs. Binding of effector molecules either increases or decreases RNR activity. When ATP binds to the allosteric activity site, it activates RNR. In contrast, when dATP binds to this site, it deactivates RNR. In addition to controlling activity, the allosteric mechanism also regulates the substrate specificity and ensures the enzyme produces an equal amount of each dNTP for DNA synthesis. In all classes, binding of ATP or dATP to the allosteric site induces reduction of cytidine 5’-diphosphate (CDP) and uridine 5’-diphosphate (UDP); 2’-deoxyguanosine 5’-triphosphate (dGTP) induces reduction of adenosine 5’-diphosphate (ADP); and 2’-deoxythymidine 5’-triphosphate (dTTP) induces reduction of guanosine 5’-diphosphate (GDP) (Figure 1).

Class IB reductases are not inhibited by dATP because they lack approximately 50 N-terminal amino acids required for the allosteric activity site. Additionally, it is important that the activity of ribonucleotide reductase be under transcriptional and post-transcriptional control because the synthesis of damage-free DNA relies on a balanced pool of deoxyribonucleotides. Eukaryotic cells with class IA reductases have a mechanism of negative control to turn off synthesis of dNTPs as they accumulate. This mechanism protects the cell from toxic and mutagenic effects that can arise from the overproduction of dNTPs because changes in balanced dNTP pools lead to DNA damage and cell death. Although, the overproduction of dNTPs or an unbalanced supply of them can lead to misincorporation of nucleotides into DNA, the supply of dNTPs supply can allow for DNA repair. p53R2 is a small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase that can induce such repair. Changes within this p53 induced R2 homolog can cause depletion in mitochondrial DNA and consequently p53R2 serves a major factor in dNTP supply.

RNR may use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation.

Generally Class I RNR inhibitors can be divided in three main groups: translation inhibitors, which block the synthesis of the enzyme; dimerization inhibitors that prevent the association of the two RNR subunits (R1 and R2); and catalytic inhibitors that inactivate the subunit R1 and/or subunit R2.

Class I RNR can be inhibited by peptides similar to the C-terminus of RNR2. These peptides can compete with RNR2 for binding to RNR1, and as a result RNR1 does not form an enzymatically active complex with RNR2. Although the C-terminus of RNR2 proteins is different across species, RNR2 can interact with RNR1 across species. When the mouse RNR2 C-terminus was replaced with the &quot;E. coli&quot; RNR2 C-terminal (7 or 33) amino acid residues, the chimeric RNR2 subunit still binds to mouse RNR1 subunits. However, they lack enzymatic activity due probably to the elimination of residues involved in the transfer of the free radical electron from the RNR2 to the RNR1 subunit.

Small peptides can specifically inhibit the RNR2 subunits from binding with RNR1 when they share a significant similarity with the normal RNR2 C-terminus. This inhibition RNR2 binding to RNR1 has been tested successfully in herpes simplex virus (HSV) RNR. When a 7 amino acid oligomer (GAVVNDL) truncated from the C-terminus of the RNR2 subunit was used in competition assays, it prevented the normal RNR2 from forming an enzymatically active complex with RNR1. Other small peptide inhibitors similar to the RNR2 C-terminus have also been used successfully to inhibit HSV RNR enzymatic activity and thus HSV replication. In mice models of stromal keratitis and corneal neovascularization (HSV ocular disease), a small RNR2 C-terminal analog BILD 1263 has been reported to inhibit RNR and is effective in preventing these diseases. In some cases, although treatment with small C-terminal analogs may not stop disease spreading, they can still help in healing. In the acyclovir-resistant HSV (PAAr5), a small peptide inhibitor BILD 1633 has been reported to be 5 to 10 times more potent than BILD 1263 against cutaneous PAAr5 infection. A combination therapy approach (BILD 1633 and acyclovir) is more effective to heal topical lesions in mice. These data suggest that small peptide inhibitors that compete with RNR2 for binding to RNR1 are useful in preventing the spread of HSV.

Gallium inhibits RNR2 by substituting for Fe3+ in the active site. Gallium maltolate is an orally bioavailable form of gallium that exploits this inhibitory activity to treat cancer, infections, and other diseases.

The drugs hydroxyurea and Motexafin gadolinium interfere with the action of this enzyme.

<text>Ferencvárosi Torna Club, commonly known as Ferencváros (), Fradi, FTC is a Hungarian professional football club based in Ferencváros, Budapest, that competes in the Nemzeti Bajnokság I, the top flight of Hungarian football. Ferencváros was founded in 1899 by Ferenc Springer and a group of local residents of Budapest&#x27;s ninth district, Ferencváros. Ferencváros is best known internationally for winning the 1964–65 edition of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup after defeating Juventus 1–0 in Turin in the final. Ferencváros also reached the final in the same competition in 1968, when they lost to Leeds United, as well as the final in the 1974–75 season of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, losing to Dynamo Kyiv.

The best-known part of the club is the well-supported men&#x27;s football team – the most popular team in the country. The parent multisport club Ferencvárosi TC divisions include women&#x27;s football, women&#x27;s handball, men&#x27;s futsal, men&#x27;s ice hockey, men&#x27;s handball, men&#x27;s water polo, cycling, gymnastics, athletics, wrestling, curling and swimming teams, some of which are highly successful.

The club colours are green and white, and the club&#x27;s mascot is a green eagle, hence another of the club&#x27;s nicknames, &quot;The Green Eagles&quot;.

==History==

On 3 May 1899, Ferencvárosi TC was founded by citizens of the 9th district of Budapest. With the exception of three seasons between 2006 and 2009, Ferencváros have played in the Nemzeti Bajnokság I since its inception in 1901. The club&#x27;s financial problems in 2006 resulted in the Hungarian Football Federation (MLSZ) withdrawing the club&#x27;s licence; a withdrawal that was eventually deemed unauthorized. Following this, Fradi were promoted back to the first division in 2009.

Ferencváros are the most successful Hungarian team both domestically and internationally. They won the 1964–65 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and have also won the Nemzeti Bajnokság I 35 times and the Magyar Kupa 24 times.

They qualified for the renewed Champions League, the first Hungarian Club to do so, in the 1995–1996 season. Since then, the club have also taken part in the 2004–05 UEFA Cup, 2019–20 Europa League, 2020–21 Champions League, and 2021–22 Europa League group stages.

On December 3, 1900, the football section of the club was established. Two months later, on February 10, the first Hungarian championship match took place between Ferencváros and Budapesti TC, though it was not officially recognized by the Hungarian Football Federation. The first official championship match was played on April 21, 1901, where Ferencváros suffered a 5–3 defeat against MUE. Borbás Gáspár, then 17 years old, scored Ferencváros&#x27; first official championship goal. The first point was earned in a 2–2 draw against Műegyetem, and the first victory came on June 16, 1901 (FTC-Budapesti SC 5–1).

Interestingly, Ferencváros made its international debut earlier than in domestic competitions. On March 25, 1901, the Viennese Cricketer defeated the Hungarian team 9–0. On May 5, against the Old Cricketer (5–0, the first Ferencváros victory in international competition), the players wore the first badge with five green and four white stripes and three inverted E&#x27;s in a green shield at the bottom – a design that still references the club&#x27;s motto: morals, strength, unity.

In 1902, Ferencváros suffered its heaviest defeat, losing 16–0 against the English team Oxford FC. The club secured its first championship title in 1903 and the second in 1905, followed by three more in the 1900s (1906/07, 1908/09, 1909/10). On June 6, 1909, FTC permanently won the first Hungarian football challenge trophy, capturing the silver ball for the fifth time.

On February 12, 1911, Ferencváros inaugurated its new stadium on Üllői Road, Ferencváros Stadion, where it still plays today. Schlosser Imre scored the first green-and-white goal in the new facility. In 1911, the club won its third consecutive championship title, remaining unbeaten in 21 matches that season. In 1912, Ferencváros defeated Working FC, winning against an English team in England for the first time. In the same year, they beat the III. district team 11–3, with Schlosser scoring eight goals in one match, a record that still stands for goals scored in a single match. The 1911/12 championship brought another Ferencváros title, marking the club&#x27;s seventh.

In 1913, Ferencváros achieved not only the championship title but also won the Hungarian Cup for the first time in its history.

In 1914, World War I broke out, bringing a somber year for Ferencváros football players. Almost every member of the team received military service call-ups, and many of them never returned home.

==Crest and colours==
The colours of the club are green and white. The nine stripes on the club badge, five green and four white, symbolise the district of Ferencváros, Budapest&#x27;s ninth district. The three E&#x27;s on Ferencváros&#x27; badge represent the club&#x27;s motto of Erkölcs, Erő, Egyetértés ().

Ferencvárosi TC has changed names various times throughout their history:
* 1899–1950: &quot;Ferencvárosi Torna Club&quot;
* 1950–1951: &quot;ÉDOSZ SE&quot;
* 1951–1956: &quot;Kinizsi&quot;

==Stadium==
The first stadium of the club started being built in the autumn of 1910. On 12 February 1911, Ferencváros played their first match against Budapest rival MTK Budapest which was won by the club. The starting line-up consisted of Fritz, Rumbold, Magnlitz, Weinber, Bródy, Payer, Szeitler, Weisz, Koródy, Schlosser, Borbás. The first stadium could host 40,000 spectators.

In 1971 the stands were demolished and a new stadium began to be built. The new stadium was inaugurated on the 75th anniversary of the club. On 19 May 1974, the first match was played against Vasas. The new stadium could host 29,505 spectators (including 10,771 seats and 18,734 standing). In the 1990s the stadium was redesigned to meet the UEFA requirements therefore its capacity was reduced to 18,100. When Ferencváros qualified for the 1995–96 UEFA Champions League group stage, a new journalist stand was built over the main stand.

On 21 December 2007, the stadium&#x27;s name was changed from Üllői úti Stadion to Stadion Albert Flórián. Flórián Albert, the former Ferencváros icon, was present at the inauguration ceremony.
There were many plans on how to increase the capacity of the stadium in case the Hungarian Football Federation won the bid for the UEFA Euro 2008 or the Euro 2012. However, the Federation did not win any bids therefore the reconstruction of the stadium was delayed.

When Kevin McCabe became the owner of the club the reconstruction was on schedule again. Later, McCabe sold his team to the Hungarian state and the reconstruction did not take place.

Ferencváros Stadion, multi-purpose stadium, is the third home of the club. It has a capacity of 20,000 spectators in UEFA matches and 23,700 in Hungarian League matches.

When Gábor Kubatov was elected as president of the club, he and Pál Orosz managed to raise enough funds for the construction of a new stadium. The new stadium was rotated by 90 degrees in order to meet UEFA requirements. Therefore, the main stand which was parallel to the Üllői út became parallel to the Hungária körút. As part of the national stadium reconstruction programme the new stadium was built between 2013 and 2014.

The stadium was designed by Ágnes Streit and Szabolcs Kormos and was built by Market Építő Zrt from 2013 to 2014. In the arena there can be found the Ferencváros Museum and a fan shop too. The stadium is cutting edge in its vein matching entrance system. On 10 August 2014, Ferencváros played the opening match against Chelsea.

After the demolition of the Puskás Ferenc Stadion, Hungary played their home matches at the new arena until the new Puskás Ferenc Stadion was opened in late 2019. The national team celebrated the victory against Norway after a 2–1 win at the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying play-off.

==Ownership==
On 14 February 2008, Sheffield United public limited company chairman Kevin McCabe successfully acquired a tender to purchase Ferencváros. McCabe&#x27;s Hungarian company, Esplanade Limited liability company bought Ferencváros&#x27; real estate for £8.45 million with a view to start paying off the £5 million debt. In April 2008, Ferencváros Torna Club officially agreed to sell the football club, Ferencváros Labdarúgó ZRt. to Esplanade Kft., McCabe&#x27;s company in Hungary.

In 2011, McCabe relinquished his ownership of the club after describing a &quot;strained relationship&quot; with some minority shareholders.

On 25 February 2011, Gábor Kubatov, Hungarian MP, was appointed as the president of Ferencváros.

On 28 October 2014, Gábor Kubatov was re-elected to serve another four-year term as the president of the club.

==Supporters and rivalries==

Supporters of Ferencváros are mainly from the capital city of Hungary, Budapest. However, the club is popular all over Hungary.

Ferencváros&#x27; nickname of Fradi is derived from Franzstadt, the German name for the area of Ferencváros, with the club carrying a &quot;vague sense of German ethnicity&quot;, according to British sports journalist Jonathan Wilson.

Since the opening of the newly built Groupama Aréna, the spectators are scanned at the entrance. As a consequence, the main supporter group of the club, called B-közép, announced a boycott in 2014. Club chairman Kubatov said that he had wanted peace in the new stadium and the club had already paid a lot of fines and punishments due to the unacceptable behaviour of the B-közép. Kubatov had expected that the spectators could have been changed due to the new regulations. However, the number of spectators had not increased in the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons.

On 13 March 2016, 10,125 spectators watched the match between Ferencváros&#x27; second team against Csepel SC in the 2015–16 Nemzeti Bajnokság III season. The attendance was a protest by the B-közép to show how many spectators were missing from the Groupama Aréna.

On 24 March 2016, the representatives of the B-közép started negotiations with club leader, Gabor Kubatov. As a results of the negotiations they were allowed back to the stadium.

===Friendships===
The fans have friendships with fans of Rapid Wien and since both play in Green the alliance is nicknamed the &quot;Green Brothers&quot;. They also have friendly relations in Hungary with fans of Zalaegerszeg, in Poland with Śląsk Wrocław and Lechia Gdańsk, and in England with Cambridge United.

===Rivalries===

Ferencváros have rivalry with several teams from Budapest including MTK Budapest, Újpest, Honvéd, Vasas SC, and several provincial clubs such as Debrecen and Diósgyőr. Since Ferencváros has been the most successful club in Hungarian Football history by winning 33 Hungarian League titles, 21 Hungarian Cup titles and 2 Hungarian League Cup titles and the most successful Hungarian club in the European football competitions by winning the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1964–65 season, every club in the Hungarian League wants to defeat them.

The biggest rivalry is with Újpest, which dates back to the 1930s when Újpest won their first Hungarian League title. Since then, the fixture between the two teams attracts the most spectators in the domestic league. The matches between the two teams often end in violence which causes big trouble for the Hungarian football. The proposal of personal registration was refused by both clubs.

The fixture between Ferencváros and MTK Budapest FC is called the Örökrangadó or Eternal derby. It is the oldest football rivalry in Hungary, which dates back as early as the 1903 season when Ferencváros first won the Hungarian League. In the following three decades either Ferencváros or MTK Budapest won the domestic league.

Honvéd are also considered fierce rivals as the clubs are in very close proximity to each other and in the past frequently competed for honours.

===Hooliganism===

On 26 November 2002, the UEFA Control and Disciplinary Committee fined Ferencváros €18,300 for fireworks and hooliganism-related offences committed by the fans of Ferencváros before and after the 2002-03 UEFA Cup second tie against VfB Stuttgart on 12 November 2002.

In 2004, Ferencváros were charged by UEFA with crowd trouble and racist abuse after playing Millwall in the 2004-05 UEFA Cup tie in Budapest, Hungary. Four fans of Millwall suffered stab wounds. The racist abuse was directed at Millwall&#x27;s players of African origin, including Paul Ifill.

On 17 July 2013, Ferencváros fans fought with police after a friendly match against Leeds United, which ended in a 1–0 victory over the Championship club, in Murska Sobota, Slovenia.

On 19 July 2014, UEFA issued sanctions against Ferencváros and Diósgyőr and Slovakia&#x27;s Spartak Trnava, following racist behaviour by their fans during 2014–15 UEFA Europa League qualifying matches against Maltese sides Sliema Wanderers, Birkirkara and Hibernians respectively. Ferencvaros were the hardest hit by the UEFA measures as club were fined by €20,000 and the partial closure of their stadium following monkey chants and racist banners displayed in both legs in Malta and Hungary.

On 27 January 2015, Gábor Kubatov, president of the club, said that he would have the fines paid by the supporters. Kubatov aims to cease the racism and violence at the stadium.

On 9 February 2015, UEFA refused the appeal of Ferencváros in connection with the incidents before and after the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League qualifying match between NK Rijeka and Ferencváros. According to the verdict, Ferencváros supporters were not allowed to attend the following UEFA match at home.

<text>Professional Football Club CSKA (, derived from the historical name &#x27;Центральный спортивный клуб армии&#x27;, English: &quot;Central Sports Club of the Army&quot;), commonly referred to as CSKA Moscow or &quot;CSKA Moskva&quot; outside of Russia, or simply as CSKA (), is a Russian professional football club. It is based in Moscow, playing its home matches at the 30,000-capacity VEB Arena. It plays in red and blue colours, with various plain and striped patterns having been used.

Founded in 1911, CSKA is one of the oldest football clubs in Russia and it had its most successful period after World War II with five titles in six seasons. It won a total of 7 Soviet Top League championships and 5 Soviet Cups, including the double in the last season in 1991. The club has also won 6 Russian Premier League titles as well as 8 Russian Cups.

CSKA Moscow became the first club in Russia to win one of the European cup competitions, the UEFA Cup, after defeating Sporting CP in the final in Lisbon in 2005.

CSKA was the official team of the Soviet Army during the communist era. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union it has become privately owned. In 2012, the Ministry of Defence sold all of its shares (24,94%) to Bluecastle Enterprises Ltd, a conglomerate owning 100% of the club since then. On 13 December 2019, state-owned development corporation VEB.RF announced they will take control of over 75% of club shares that were used as collateral by previous owners for the VEB Arena financing. Russian businessman Roman Abramovich&#x27;s Sibneft corporation was a leading sponsor of the club from 2004 to 2006.

==History==
===Names===
CSKA Moscow was founded in 1911 and, like many clubs in the former Soviet Union, has seen a number of name changes. From 1928 to 1950 the association was called &quot;CDKA Moscow&quot; (). In 1951 its name was changed to &quot;CDSA Moscow&quot; (). In 1957 the sports society was renamed again into &quot;CSK MO Moscow&quot; (). The current name of club&#x27;s football department, &quot;PFC CSKA Moscow&quot; () has been used since 1994.

===Foundation and first successes===
The history of CSKA football club began in 1911, when a football section was organized in the Amateur Society of Skiing Sports (OLLS).

After the 1917 season, part of the reserve OLLS team moved to the first. In 1921, the champion of the autumn Moscow championship (winner of Fulda Cup) was determined in the final match, in which teams OLLS and KFS took part. The KFS team won 6:0. In the 1922 season, OLLS players won the spring Moscow championship and took second place in the fall championship. In the same year, OLLS won KFS-Kolomyagi Cup, in the final of which, according to the regulations, the winners of the first and second leagues of the Moscow championship met, and Tosmen Cup, where the champions of Moscow and Petrograd met.

===Soviet period===
====Until 1970: Peaks and troughs====
The club had its most successful period immediately after the end of the Second World War. At this time, one of the best players in its history and the best scorer in the history of the team, Grigory Fedotov, played for the club. The army men were runners-up in the first edition of the resumed Vysschaya Liga in 1945. 
Three consecutive championship titles followed for the first time in league history, including club&#x27;s first double in 1948. This year the army team won their second USSR Cup. In the semifinals, as a result of a replay, CDKA snatched victory from Dynamo Moscow, and in the final they defeated the current cup holders, Spartak. By that time the main army team became dubbed as the &quot;Team of Lieutenants&quot; (). After finishing second in 1949, in 1950, the army team became champions again, and in 1951, playing under the new name CDSA (Central House of the Soviet Army), they won a double again, winning both the championship and the cup. The history of the football department from this time is closely linked to the ice hockey department of the club, HC CSKA Moscow, because the leading players like Vsevolod Bobrov played both sports in parallel.

After successful times Olympic Games 1952 in Helsinki marked the beginning of the decline of CDSA Moscow. The club&#x27;s players formed the core of the national team, which, after tough negotiations, joined FIFA shortly before the Olympic football tournament. Boris Arkadiev became the coach of both the national team and the army club. The first meeting between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in football is still amongst the most famous matches. On the political level, the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and the Yugoslav leader Josip Tito split in 1948, which resulted in Yugoslavia being excluded from the Communist Information Bureau. Before the match, both Tito and Stalin sent telegrams to their national teams, which showed just how important it was for the two head of states. Yugoslavia led 5–1, but a Soviet comeback in the last 15 minutes resulted in a 5–5 draw. The match was replayed, Yugoslavia winning 3–1. The defeat to the archrivals hit Soviet football hard, especially CDSA and its players. After just three games played in the season, CDSA was forced to withdraw from the league and later disbanded. Furthermore, Boris Arkadiev was stripped of his Merited Master of Sports of the USSR title. For intelligence chief Lavrentiy Beria, the Olympic elimination was the perfect opportunity to eliminate the successful city rival. As head of the KGB, he was also honorary president of Dynamo Moscow - the main rival of CDSA.

After two seasons of oblivion and after Stalin&#x27;s death in the spring of 1953 CDSA Moscow was re-established in 1954 on the initiative of then Soviet Defense Minister Nikolai Bulganin. Shortly thereafter, the team won the Soviet Cup in 1955, defeating Dynamo Moscow in the final with the legendary goalkeeper Lev Yashin being sent off. The fans had to wait 15 years for the next trophy. In 1970 season, CSKA became Soviet champions for the sixth time, gaining the same number of points with Dynamo. The first gold match held on December 5, 1970 in Tashkent, Uzbek SSR ended without goals. The next day CSKA won the second match against Dynamo 4:3 after 1:3 deficit. By winning the championship, CSKA qualified for the first round of the European Cup. CSKA defeated Turkish club Galatasaray in the first round, but lost to Belgian champion Standard Liège in the second round and was eliminated from the tournament.

====1971 to 1991: Two decades drought====
With only 19 points out of a possible 68 in the 1984 season, the club had to endure the first ever relegation to the second division, where CSKA spent two seasons. After returning to the Higher league, the club did not manage to stay in it for a long time, and in the 1987 season, a second relegation followed. Nevertheless CSKA was able to fight its way back after two seasons in the First League, immediately secured the runner-up and even won the last edition of the football championship of the Soviet Union in the 1991 season. Having also won the Soviet cup, the club thus secured the last golden double in the history of the USSR football. With the championship title from the 1991 season, CSKA Moscow qualified for the first round of the 1992–93 UEFA Champions League, where they defeated the Icelandic team Víkingur Reykjavík. In the second round the Spanish top club Barcelona with coach Johan Cruyff was defeated. The opponents in Group A were the current Champions League winners Olympique Marseille, Glasgow Rangers and Club Brugge. CSKA was unable to build on the results of the matches with Barcelona, becoming the fourth in the group with two draws and four defeats, and was eliminated from the tournament.

===Modern period===
====1992 to 2004: Back to the top====
CSKA Moscow was one of the founding members of the newly formed Russian Top Division after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In the first six seasons, the team occupied the places in the middle of the table. In the 1998 season, the club was runner-up and in the next season finished third. In the following two seasons, CSKA Moscow again occupied places in the middle of the table. In the 2002 season, the team trained by Valery Gazzaev took second place again, winning the Russian Cup. In 2003, the team won its first championship in the history of the Russian Premier League. After that, the head coach Valery Gassayev was sacked surprisingly and the Portuguese coach Artur Jorge was signed as his successor. Under the new coach, the team could not build on the performances from the previous season. After falling to fifth place in July 2004, Arthur Jorge was sacked after only eight months at the helm of the club. After the return of Valery Gassaev, CSKA was able to save the season and become vice-champion.

====2005 to 2010: Golden years====
In the 2004 season, after qualifying for the UEFA Champions League, the team finished third at the group stage and therefore took part in the UEFA Cup play-off. The UEFA Cup for CSKA began with a home match against Portugal&#x27;s Benfica in the round of 32, which ended in a 2-0 victory for CSKA, in the away match CSKA drew 1-1. The next rival of CSKA was the Serbian club Partizan, the away match in Belgrade ended with a score of 1-1, and the home match in Krasnodar - 2-0 in favor of the red-blue team. In the next round, the army team defeated the French side Auxerre 4-0. Despite the 2-0 away defeat, CSKA was able to continue playing in the UEFA Cup. In the semifinals, CSKA&#x27;s opponent was the Italian side Parma, after beating which (0-0, 3-0), the Muscovites reached the final.

Then, on May 18, 2005, the team became the first Russian team ever to win a European competition, the 2004-05 UEFA Cup at the José Alvalade Stadium in Lisbon, Portugal, winning Sporting 3-1. The team failed to consolidate their success, losing the UEFA Super Cup to English club Liverpool on 26 August 2005 at Stade Louis II, in Monaco. Nevertheless, this year, CSKA become the first Russian club to complete a treble after winning the second Russian championship title and the Russian Cup.

The team had qualified for the third qualifying round of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League by winning the championship in 2005 and progressed to the group stage over MFK Ružomberok. At the group stage, CSKA finished in third place and qualified for the round of 32 in the UEFA Cup, but was eliminated there against the Israeli representative Maccabi Haifa. In the 2006 season, CSKA won domestic treble, as the team won all three national titles: the Premier League, the Russian Cup and the Russian Super Cup.

As Russian champions, CSKA qualified for the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League. At the group stage, CSKA finished fourth and last with just one draw out of five defeats and was eliminated. In the Premier League, CSKA occupied the third place, but won the Russian Super Cup.

In the first half of the 2008 season, CSKA played below expectations and even finished in seventh place at the break of the season. After the European Championship, Valery Gazzaev, who announced his retirement at the end of the season, switched the game tactics to four defenders and let the young Alan Dzagoev, who was considered one of the greatest talents in Russian football, show himself. As a result, CSKA ended its negative series and from then on showed effective football. But it was no longer enough to win the championship, and CSKA took the runner-up behind Rubin Kazan. In the 2008-09 UEFA Cup, CSKA was the only team to achieve twelve points from four group matches. Then the team advanced to the round of 16, where they were defeated by the eventual UEFA Cup winners Shakhtar Donetsk from Ukraine after a 1-0 home win and subsequent 0-2 away defeat. The team also won the Russian Cup for the fourth time.

In January 2009, the Brazilian Zico took over the position of head coach at CSKA. After the half of the 2009 season, the club was only fourth. At the end of the 2009 season, fifth place was just enough for participation in the 2010-11 UEFA Europa League. As a result, the Brazilian head coach was dismissed in September 2009. In the same month, the Spaniard Juande Ramos was signed as his successor, but only lasted 47 days before being released on October 26 and replaced by Leonid Slutsky. The club won the Russian Supercup for the fourth time and became the Russian Cup winner for the fifth time. The team had also qualified for the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the first time after defeating Sevilla FC 3–2 on aggregate. They were later eliminated from competition by the eventual winners Inter Milan, losing by 1–0 scorelines in both Milan and Moscow.

====Slutsky era====
Leonid Slutsky was introduced as the new head coach in October 2009. In the 2010 Russian Premier League season, the team was runner-up. In the Russian Cup, the team was eliminated in the round of 32 against the second division Ural Ekaterinburg. In the Europa League, CSKA made it to the round of 16, where the team lost to the eventual winners Porto after two defeats (0-1 and 1-2).

Finishing as the runners-up in the previous season, the club qualified for the group stage of the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League. The opponents in Group B were Inter Milan, Trabzonspor and Lille. On 7 December 2011, CSKA qualified for the knockout phase after winning crucial 3 points by defeating Inter Milan with scoreline 1–2 in Milan and finishing as the runners-up in the group behind the Milanese. In the round of 16 the team met Spanish top club Real Madrid, to which CSKA lost 2-5 on aggregate. In the 2011–12 Russian championship, CSKA could only reach third place despite finishing second after the first phase of the season. By the 100th anniversary of the club, CSKA could not leave its fans without a trophy and won its sixth Russian Cup, beating Alania Vladikavkaz in the final 2-1 on May 22, 2011.

In the 2012–13 season, CSKA took part in the play-off round of the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League, where they were eliminated against Swedish side AIK after 1-0 in Moscow and 0-2 in Stockholm. At the end of the season, however, CSKA were crowned the champions of Russia. It was the eleventh championship title in club history. The team won the Russian Cup and thus achieving a double.

As Russian champions CSKA took part in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League. The club was eliminated from the competition after the group stage against Bayern Munich, Manchester City and Viktoria Plzeň with only one win and five defeats resulting in the fourth place. In the domestic League, however, the club celebrated the second championship title in a row after Zoran Tošić scored the decisive goal against Lokomotiv Moscow on the last Matchday of the season for the tenth victory in the league in a row.

In the 2015–16 season, CSKA advanced to the Champions League group stage over Sparta Prague and Sporting. With PSV Eindhoven, Manchester United and Wolfsburg, CSKA completed Group B of the competition, but wasn&#x27;t able to advance to the round of 16. In the Premier League, the club started with six consecutive wins, with the first four games being won without conceding a single goal. At the end of the season, the army club finished two points ahead of the second-placed Rostov and won its sixth Russian title (and 13th overall). 

As a result, CSKA took part in the group stage of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League. Opponents in Group E were Monaco, Bayer Leverkusen and Tottenham Hotspur. On 6 October 2016, during the group stage, Finland announced that Roman Eremenko had been handed a 30-day ban from football by UEFA, with UEFA announcing on 18 November 2016, that Eremenko had been handed a two-year ban from football due to testing positive for cocaine.
Following the ban of one of the team leaders CSKA couldn&#x27;t win a single game and was therefore eliminated from the tournament. After the last group game against Tottenham and after a negative run in the league, longtime head coach Leonid Slutsky left the club at his own request.

On 12 December, Viktor Goncharenko was announced as the club&#x27;s new manager, signing a two-year contract.

====Under Goncharenko====
As CSKA finished second in the 2016–17 Premier League, they started their way in the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League from the third qualifying round, defeating AEK Athens there and then Young Boys in the play-off round. In Group A, the army club met Benfica, Manchester United and Basel and finished in third place. As a result, CSKA continued to play in the Europa League and advanced to the quarter-finals, losing to Arsenal.

On 21 July 2018, Goncharenko extended his contract until the end of the 2019/20 season. During the summer of 2018 CSKA lost many of its leaders: Aleksei and Vasili Berezutski and Sergei Ignashevich finished their careers as professional players; Alexandr Golovin was bought by AS Monaco; Pontus Wernbloom became a PAOK player and Bibras Natcho went to Olympiacos. However, at the start of that season CSKA showed good results, being at the top-three in Russian champions table and beating Real Madrid in Champions League group stage in both home and away matches (1–0 in Moscow and 3–0 in Madrid).

On 13 December 2019, state-owned development corporation VEB.RF announced they will take control of over 75% of club shares that were used as collateral by previous owners for the VEB Arena financing.

On 22 March 2021, Viktor Goncharenko left his role as head coach of CSKA Moscow by mutual consent.

====Under Olić, Berezutski and Fedotov====
On 23 March 2021, CSKA appointed their former striker Ivica Olić as their new head coach. After just nine games, culminating in a 6th place finish in the 2020–21 Russian Premier League, missing the European competitions for the first time in 20 years, Olić left CSKA by mutual consent on 15 June 2021 with Aleksei Berezutski being placed in temporary charge. On 19 July 2021, Berezutski was confirmed as CSKA&#x27;s new permanent head coach.

In February 2022, CSKA were hit by sanctions from the United States Department of the Treasury as a consequence of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. CSKA is owned by Russian state-controlled VEB.RF and was sanctioned as its asset. In addition, the European Club Association suspended the team. CSKA won season-best 6 consecutive league games (last two before the winter break and the first four after), Berezutski was selected league&#x27;s coach of the month for March 2022 and the club moved up to the 3rd position in the standings within 6 points of league-leading Zenit Saint Petersburg. However, CSKA won only twice in the remaining 8 games of the league season and finished in 5th place. On 15 June 2022, Berezutski left his role as Head Coach after his contract was terminated by mutual agreement, with Vladimir Fedotov being appointed as the clubs new Head Coach the same day. Fedotov led CSKA to the 2nd place in the 2022–23 Russian Premier League. CSKA also won the 2022–23 Russian Cup.

==Stadium==

CSKA had its own stadium called &quot;Light-Athletic Football Complex CSKA&quot; and abbreviated as LFK CSKA. Its capacity is very small for a club of its stature; no more than 4,600 spectators.

Between 1961 and 2000, CSKA played their home games at the Grigory Fedotov Stadium. In 2007, the Grigory Fedotov Stadium was demolished in 2007, and ground was broken on the club&#x27;s new stadium Arena CSKA later the same year. During construction of their new stadium, CSKA played the majority of their games at the Arena Khimki and Luzhniki Stadium. After several delays in its construction, Arena CSKA was official opened on 10 September 2016.

On 28 February 2017, CSKA Moscow announced that they had sold the naming rights to the stadium to VEB.RF, with the stadium becoming the VEB Arena.

==CSKA Women==
CSKA&#x27;s women&#x27;s football team was founded in 1990 and competed in Soviet Championship&#x27;s second level. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union that same year, it registered in the Russian Supreme Division, where it competed for two seasons before it folded.

Following the disbanding of Zorky Krasnogorsk near the end of the 2015 Top Division, FK Rossiyanka filled its vacancy for the next season and the new team was registered as CSKA in the 2016 championship. Its first game, a 1–1 draw against Chertanovo, coincided with the 93rd anniversary of the CSKA&#x27;s first football match. CSKA ended the championship second-to-last, while Rossiyanka won its fifth title.

In July 2017, during the inter-season summer pause, it became a CSKA official section. Two months later the team won its first title after defeating Chertanovo 1–0 in the Russian Cup final.

In recent years CSKA Women won two Russian championships in a row, in 2019 and 2020 and made their debut in UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League.

==FC CSKA-d Moscow and FC CSKA-2 Moscow==
The reserves team played on the professional level as FC CSKA-d Moscow (Russian Second League in 1992–93, Russian Third League in 1994–97, Russian Second Division in 1998–00, in 1998–00 team was called FC CSKA-2 Moscow). A separate farm club called FC CSKA-2 Moscow played in the Soviet Second League in 1986–89, Soviet Second League B in 1990–91, Russian Second League in 1992–93 and Russian Third League in 1994. That latter team was called FC Chaika-CSKA-2 Moscow for one season in 1989.

<doc id="861275" wikidata="Q1800895" url="?curid=861275" title="Allagash River">
<text>The Allagash River is a tributary of the Saint John River, approximately long, in northern Maine in the United States. It drains in a remote and scenic area of wilderness in the Maine North Woods north of Mount Katahdin. The name &quot;Allagash&quot; comes from the Abenaki language, a dialect of the Algonquin languages, spoken by the Penobscot Tribe. The word, &quot;/walakéskʸihtəkʸ/&quot;, means &quot;bark stream&quot;.

The Allagash issues from Churchill Lake (formerly known as Heron Lake) at Churchill Depot in northern Piscataquis County. In its natural state, it also drained Allagash, Chamberlain, and Telos lakes, but in the 1840s dams were built which diverted their drainage into the East Branch of the Penobscot River, to facilitate the shipping of logs south to coastal Maine. Lock Dam drains some water from Chamberlain Lake into the south end of Eagle Lake, which then flows out through the Allagash as it naturally would. Extending the flowline of the Allagash River to Lock Dam on Chamberlain Lake gives a total length to the mouth of the Allagash at the Saint John River of .

The Allagash flows generally northeast, passing through a chain of natural mountain lakes. It joins the Saint John from the south at Allagash, Maine, near the international border with New Brunswick. The relatively unspoiled nature of the river has long made it a popular destination for canoe trips. In 1857 Henry David Thoreau, along with his Concord friend Edward S. Hoar and Penobscot guide Joseph Polis, made a canoe journey which led him to the source of the river, i.e. Heron Lake. His account of the excursion called &quot;The Allegash and East Branch&quot; was published posthumously as the third chapter of &quot;The Maine Woods&quot; (1864).

In 1966, the citizens of Maine voted to protect the river by authorizing a $1.5 million bond that would &quot;develop the maximum wilderness character&quot; of the river. Much of the river was subsequently designated as the Allagash Wilderness Waterway. In 1970 the waterway became part of the National Wild and Scenic River program of the U.S. federal government. Although the wild designation of the river is normally applied to free-flowing streams, the designation left in place the wooden Churchill Dam for historic reasons. In the 1990s, with the dam failing, the citizens of Maine authorized a concrete replacement for the dam to preserve the nearby recreational facilities on the river. The rebuilding of the dam was highly criticized by environmentalists. The expansion of recreational access to the river through new roads and docks has remained a controversial topic in recent years.

Development in much of the area surrounding the Allagash Wilderness Waterway is restricted by the Seven Islands Land Company, a private land management company that owns approximately 1 million acres (4,000 km2) of forest in northern Maine.

The United States government maintains one stream gauge on the Allagash, located above the river&#x27;s mouth near Allagash, Maine (), at which point the watershed is . The river&#x27;s discharge (flow) at this gauge averages , with a recorded maximum of and minimum of . Annual maximum flows occur during the spring snow melt and minimums in the fall.

<text>Maccabi Tel Aviv Football Club (; &quot;Moadon Kaduregel Maccabi Tel Aviv&quot;) is an Israeli professional football club from Tel Aviv and part of the Maccabi Tel Aviv Sport Club.

Founded in 1906 in Jaffa as the HaRishon Le Zion-Yafo Association, it is the oldest football club in Israel. With the establishment of the city of Tel Aviv in 1909, the club changed its name to Maccabi Tel Aviv. In 1922, it became the first Jewish football club to participate in local competitions. The forms an integral part of the character of the team, which took the Star of David as their logo to represent the Jewish people. Maccabi Tel Aviv have won more titles than any other Israeli club, winning 25 League Championships, 24 State Cups, 8 Toto (League) Cups, and 2 Asian Champion Club Tournaments before Israel were expelled from the AFC in 1974.

Maccabi Tel Aviv is the only football team that has never been relegated from the Israeli Premier League and one of only three Israeli teams to ever progress to the UEFA Champions League group stage. The club is named after the Maccabees and invests in the development and nurturing of young talent: the club runs three football academies in the Tel Aviv area as part of its youth programme, working with over 750 children aged 6–15, as well as running 17 youth teams with 400 players between 9 and 19 years old. These teams tend to compete very successfully in local and national leagues.

==History==

===Before 1950===

In the early 1920s, despite the absence of an organised league, Maccabi Tel Aviv were known as the strongest football team in Palestine and were invited to numerous friendly matches, even against British teams of the local Mandate. Official tournaments began taking place in 1928 with the establishment of the Football Association and FIFA&#x27;s recognition of Israeli football. In 1929, the team won their first trophy after beating Maccabi Hashmonai Jerusalem 4–0. Maccabi took the championship again one year later with a 2–1 victory over the British Army&#x27;s 48th regiment and a third time in 1933, when Hapoel Tel Aviv were beaten, 1–0.
In 1936, the club was invited to play in the United States. On their way there, Maccabi played in France, losing 2–0 to Racing Paris and 3–1 to Lille. In the United States, Maccabi defeated the All-star team of New York City in front of 50,000 in Yankee Stadium. Maccabi also defeated the American Soccer League team in Brooklyn and Philadelphia on their home ground 1–0 and also played in Canada, where they drew 1–1 with Toronto All-Stars. Maccabi continued their tour in the US and lost, 3–2, to St. Louis Stars and the Boston Celtics.
After returning from the United States, Maccabi players went on strike because they had not been paid. In 1937, after a year of strike action, the Football Association accepted their demands and the team ended their strike. In that year, Maccabi Tel Aviv also won their first league title. In 1939, after the start of World War II, Maccabi won their second championship. At the end of the season, Maccabi went to another tour, this time to Australia where they were known as the &quot;Palestine&quot; team and occasionally the Maccabi Palestine team. They played 18 games, winning 11, losing 5 and drawing 2. The games were against State sides (New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia), regional sides and five &quot;tests&quot; against the Australian national team, winning one, drawing one and losing three.
In 1941 Maccabi won their first &quot;double&quot;, Winning both the league and State Cup, beating Hapoel Tel Aviv, 2–1, in the final. Between 1941 and 1945, the league was suspended because of the war, but Maccabi continued playing friendly matches. In 1946, the league was still suspended but the State Cup returned with Maccabi beating Hapoel Rishon LeZion 6–0 on aggregate in the final. In 1947, the league resumed and Maccabi won it as well as reaching the cup final. In the match against Beitar Tel Aviv at the Hatikva Neighborhood Stadium Maccabi were winning 3–2 when the referee disallowed a goal by Beitar. The Beitar players and their supporters stormed at the referee and Beitar defender Yom-Tov Mansherov broke the Cup. As a result, the referee ended the game and Maccabi were awarded a technical victory, thus winning a second double. Forty-five years later the cup was found in Petah Tikva.

===1950s===

This decade is considered Maccabi Tel Aviv&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age&quot;, in which they won five championships and four Israel Football Association Cups. The &quot;Golden Age&quot; actually began with the establishment of the State of Israel, with Maccabi Tel Aviv winning the league title in the 1949–50 season. The deciding match of the season was the second Tel Aviv derby against Hapoel Tel Aviv, which Maccabi won, 1–0, thanks to a goal from striker Yosef &quot;Yosale&quot; Merimovich that sealed Maccabi Tel Aviv&#x27;s first post-colonisation championship title. Merimovich was just one member of a squad of outstanding players that left Maccabi Tel Aviv unchallenged in their domination of the Israeli Premier League during the 1950s. That squad included the likes of defenders Itzhak Schneor and Eli Fuchs, goalkeeper Avraham Bandouri, striker Zvi Studinski and of course the club&#x27;s legendary centre forward Yehoshua &quot;Shiye&quot; Glazer. Glazer, who won the top scorer title in 1952 with 27 goals, is considered Maccabi Tel Aviv&#x27;s greatest ever striker and was the club&#x27;s highest goal scorer until Avi Nimni broke his record in 2003.

The 1951–52 season was Maccabi&#x27;s second league title after the establishment of the State, which they won by eight points ahead of Maccabi Petah Tikva, though they lost the IFA Cup final. That loss only inspired them to win an historic first double in the 1953–54 season, once again winning the league ahead of Maccabi Petah Tikva. That year&#x27;s Cup final provided them with the opportunity to put in one of their most devastating performances, crushing their opponents Maccabi Netanya 4–0 with a brace from Glazer and individual goals from Studinski and midfielder Israel Halivner.

It was the following season that the great Hapoel Petah Tikva team of midfielder Nahum Stelmach and associates burst on the scene and captured the championship from Maccabi Tel Aviv after a down to the wire finish. Still, Maccabi Tel Aviv weren&#x27;t prepared to surrender all the titles that season and came up trumps in a 3–1 victory over the same Hapoel Petah Tikva in the IFA Cup final. Maccabi went on to beat them to the title in two more seasons, 1955–56 and 1957–58, completing their fifth National Championship in the first decade of the modern state of Israel. That final season title was complemented by a double, with Maccabi beating Hapoel Haifa in the IFA Cup final, 2–0.

The following season Maccabi Tel Aviv won their second consecutive IFA Cup in a final that will be remembered as one of the most famous in the entire history of the competition. Maccabi appeared to be cruising to victory with a seemingly unassailable 4–0 lead just ten minutes from time. But within five of those final ten minutes Hapoel Petah Tikva pulled back three of those goals, guaranteeing one of the most exciting finales in IFA Cup history. But in the end Maccabi held on to celebrate yet another IFA Cup triumph.

===1960s===

Following the &quot;Golden Years&quot; of the 1950s, Maccabi Tel Aviv found themselves as the new decade began challenged and ultimately eclipsed by the emergent HaPoel Petach Tikva, who during the late 1950s and early 1960s won five consecutive league titles. The second of those championships, in 1960, came at Maccabi&#x27;s expense, with the Yellows leading the table on the last day of the season only to disappointingly lose their final match to Hapoel Haifa thereby handing the championship to Hapoel Petah Tikva. The outstanding player of Maccabi&#x27;s season had been Rafi Levi, one of the greatest strikers in the club&#x27;s history, who was the league&#x27;s leading goal scorer with 19 goals. A year later the Brazilian club Santos visited Israel, along with their legendary player, Pelé, for a friendly match against a side composed of the best players from both Maccabi Tel Aviv and Hapoel Petah Tikva. But even the combined forces of the two best clubs in the country were no match for the Brazilians, who won, 3–1.
After a number of unremarkable seasons, the 1960s saw the return of Maccabi Tel Aviv with one of their greatest coaches, Jerry Beit haLevi. He had served the club as a player in the 1930s and, with the exception of one year, managed the club for the 10 years between 1947 and 1957. Under his guardianship Maccabi Tel Aviv slowly returned to form and in the 1963–64 season won the Israel Football Association Cup after a second replay against Hapoel Haifa, which Maccabi won, 2–1. The following season Maccabi Tel Aviv repeated the feat by exactly the same score, this time in a dramatic extra time victory over Bnei Yehuda that included goals by midfielders Moshe Asis and Rafi Baranes. In the 1966–67 season Maccabi added a third IFA Cup. This time the opponent in the final were city rivals Hapoel Tel Aviv whom Maccabi defeated by the very same 2–1 score line, with goals from midfielder Uri Kedmi and striker Rachamim Talbi.
While the Cup competition was held as scheduled that year, the league was interrupted by the Six-Day War and was extended into 1968. Now coached by their former midfielder Israel Halivner, Maccabi Tel Aviv won their first and only championship of the decade after a combined 60 match weeks, leading Hapoel Petah Tikva by three points at the top of the Israel Premier League table. But by far the most memorable event of the decade was Maccabi&#x27;s success in the Asian Champion Club Tournament in 1969, becoming the second Israeli football club to win an international competition in the country&#x27;s history. Now managed by former striking great Yossele Merimovich, Maccabi beat South Korean side Yangzee FC in extra time through a goal by striker Dror Bar Nur.

A less successful decade for Maccabi Tel Aviv perhaps, but the club still managed to win one championship and three Israel Football Association Cups. Among the great names of the decade were midfielder Nissim Bachar, defender Meir Nimni, defender Menachem &quot;Miko&quot; Bello, defender Tzvika Rosen, goalkeeper Haim Levin, midfielder Moshe Asis, striker Rafi Levi and midfielder Giora Spiegel.

===1970s===

By Maccabi Tel Aviv standards, the 1960s had not been a particularly successful decade. With the coming of the 1970s, all that was about to change. The very first year of the decade was a stellar indication of that change as the team, under the able leadership of David Schweitzer, won an historic double. The Israeli Football Association (IFA) Cup final was won with a 2–1 victory over Maccabi Netanya. The league title on the other hand was ensured only on goal difference, but one that was built in part upon one of the finest performances in the club&#x27;s history, a 5–0 thrashing of city rivals Hapoel Tel Aviv in the Tel Aviv derby. On a rainy day at the end of January 1970, 20,000 spectators saw Maccabi midfielder Giora Shpiegel score a hat-trick to lead his side to victory. But despite that defeat, Hapoel stayed neck-and-neck with Maccabi until the last week and it was Hapoel who found themselves in second place on goal difference when the season reached its conclusion.

The following season was a weak one for Maccabi Tel Aviv that saw them finish tenth in the league table. But just one year later they were fully back on track winning their second championship of the decade in the 1971–72 season. One of the stars of that season, and one of the greatest strikers in the club&#x27;s history, was Dror Bar Nur, who scored 16 of the club&#x27;s 45 goals in the league and added two more in other competitions.
Just four years later Maccabi Tel Aviv found themselves for the first time in a relegation battle, with the final week of the 1975–76 season seeing no less than nine clubs battling it out to stay in the upper tier. Maccabi beat Beitar Jerusalem 2–0 with goals from strikers Rachamim Talbi and Benny Tabak, thus escaping what would have been the first drop in the club&#x27;s history. In April of that same year, leaders of the English Football League First Division, Queens Park Rangers, arrived in Israel for a friendly to face a Maccabi Tel Aviv side bolstered by three of the Israeli Premier League&#x27;s brightest stars of the time: Maccabi Netanya strikers Mordechai &quot;Motaleh&quot; Spiegler and Oded Machnes and Beitar Jerusalem midfielder Uri Malmilian. Maccabi won the match, 2–1, with goals from Malmilian and Spiegler.

A year later and once again Maccabi Tel Aviv went from near disaster to the league summit, securing in the 1976/77 season their second double of the decade. They won the title three points ahead of Maccabi Jaffa and with 47 goals, the highest number in the league. Striker Vicky Peretz finished as the league&#x27;s leading goal scorer with 17 league goals and another five in IFA Cup competition. But it was Benny Tabak&#x27;s lone goal against Beitar Tel Aviv in front of 30,000 spectators at Bloomfield Stadium that earned Maccabi the IFA Cup and their second double in the space of seven years.
Among the great Maccabi players of the time were strikers Benny Tabak and Vicky Peretz and the late Avi Cohen, who earned the nickname &quot;Libero&quot; (from the Italian, a fullback who is given freedom – libero – to roam from his position to play a role in offence as well) and is thought to be one of the greatest defenders in the history of Israeli football. One of his most memorable goals was in a 2–0 derby victory over Hapoel Tel Aviv in 1978, when the defender struck an absolutely unstoppable ball from the edge of the area straight into the opposition net. Vicky Peretz and Benny Tabak are remembered as two of the greatest strikers in the history of the club, with the former scoring 67 and the latter 121 goals in the yellow and blue jersey of Maccabi Tel Aviv.

===1980s===

The 1980s saw a period of below par achievements for Maccabi Tel Aviv FC, earning the decade the nickname the &quot;thin years&quot;. While adding two Israel Football Association (IFA) Cups to the trophy cabinet, the club remained without a league title throughout the decade. The first of the two consecutive IFA Cup triumphs, however, was won in dramatic fashion in a final against Maccabi Haifa in the 1986–87 season. While Maccabi Tel Aviv, third in the table, finished six places above their northern namesakes, the Cup final was a tight affair that ended 3–3 after extra time and was decided in a penalty shoot-out. And it was striker Benny Tabak&#x27;s final kick that saw Maccabi Tel Aviv lift their first IFA Cup in ten years.

The following season Maccabi Tel Aviv, now under the stewardship of Giora Spiegel, underwent their worst defeat in the club&#x27;s history, a 0–10 rout suffered at the hands of that same Maccabi Haifa. Yet only three weeks later the club appeared in their second consecutive intriguing IFA Cup final, this time against their arch big city rivals Hapoel Tel Aviv. Despite the fresh memories of their lacklustre performance in Haifa the team succeeded in returning to form thanks to a wonderful goal by midfielder Mickey Cohen and yet another from Benny Tabak that led to a 2–1 victory and a second straight IFA Cup title.

Another memorable event of the 1980s occurred at the beginning of the decade, in a match against Beitar Jerusalem held at the YMCA Stadium in Jerusalem in the second matchweek of the 1981–82 season. The match referee Avraham Klein, of international reputation, disallowed a Beitar goal but the players continued to celebrate. Maccabi defender Menahem &quot;Miko&quot; Belo quickly resumed play, passed on to midfielder Moti Ivanir who found himself facing the Beitar keeper Yossi Mizrachi on his own. To the great ire of the local fans he scored the goal that would ultimately lead to a 1–2 Maccabi victory.

Despite the less than scintillating nature of Maccabi&#x27;s performances throughout the decade, the club had a number of outstanding players, including Moti Ivanir, midfielder Alon Natan, goalkeeper Bonni Ginzburg and striker Eli Driks who succeeded in leaving their mark on the club&#x27;s history. Ivanir, who made his maiden performance for Maccabi aged 16, scored 67 times playing for the club throughout the decade, with the exception of the two years he spent at Dutch side Roda JC Kerkrade. Alon Natan found the net 40 times before leaving the club for Bnei Yehuda at the end of the 1989–90 season. He was subsequently forced into retirement at age 23 due to injury.

Bonni Ginzburg protected the Maccabi goal from the beginning of the decade until the 1987–88 season. He earned himself a place on the national squad and two years later became the first Israeli goalkeeper to play abroad. Eli Driks, one of the club&#x27;s all-time greatest strikers, came through the youth ranks at the beginning of the 1980s and began a successful career at the fulcrum of the Maccabi Tel Aviv attack that lasted 20 years.

===1990s===

After the considerably less than spectacular decade of the 1980s, a young head coach by the name of Avram Grant took over the reins at Maccabi Tel Aviv and brought with him a whole slew of young players that together brought about one of the most successful decades in the club&#x27;s history. By the time the decade had reached its halfway point the team had already won an historic &quot;double&quot; along with two more championships, two State Cups and one Toto (League) Cup, to which two more would be added before the decade had drawn to a close. Within a matter of a few short years, the glow surrounding Maccabi Tel Aviv, which had dimmed somewhat in the 80s, had returned and once again the yellow and blue of Maccabi became the national colours of Israel&#x27;s football culture.

It all started in the 1991–92 season, when by virtue of exceptional talent and quality attacking football under the leadership of Avraham Grant, Maccabi Tel Aviv won the league championship for the first time in thirteen years. What contributed to this talent was, among other things, the arrival at the club of the Russian national goalkeeper Alexander Ubarov, who in time became a real Maccabi Tel Aviv legend. With him arrived defender Alexander Polukarov, who also left an enduring mark at the club and together with midfielder Uri Malmilyan and the young midfielders Avi Nimni and Itzik Zohar returned Maccabi Tel Aviv to the top of Israeli football. In the 1992–93 season, after winning the Toto (League) Cup, this talented and successful group of young players of the 1990s got their first taste of victory in the prestigious State Cup after goals by Itsik Zohar and fellow midfielder Nir Klinger decided the final against arch rivals Hapoel Tel Aviv. But despite finishing an excellent season with 88 points, the league title, and hence an historic &quot;double&quot;, remained beyond their grasp as Maccabi Haifa enjoyed a spectacular season that saw them play all 39 league matches without a loss and pip Maccabi Tel Aviv to the championship. But the following season Grant and his charges compensated for their disappointment when defender Alon Brumer&#x27;s famous goal in Beer Sheva succeeded in returning the championship to Maccabi Tel Aviv in dramatic fashion.
At the end of the 1995 season the &quot;Mofet&quot; Group took control of Maccabi Tel Aviv and as a result of Avraham Grant&#x27;s decision to leave the club, a new coach, Dror Kashtan, took over the reins for what would prove to be one of the best seasons in the club&#x27;s history. Their chief rivals were once again Maccabi Haifa, and the team traveled to their Kiryat Eliezer Stadium for what will always be remembered as the must-win match of that season. As the players headed for the dressing room trailing 1–0 at half time, coach Kashtan controversially decided to return his players to await their Maccabi Haifa rivals on the pitch. In the second half, goals by striker Eli Dricks and midfielders Nir Klinger and Avi Nimni turned the match around, and that 1–3 victory not only handed Maccabi Tel Aviv the championship but also paved the way for the &quot;double&quot; after a 4–1 thrashing of Hapoel Rishon Lezion in the State Cup final.
With Israel&#x27;s entrance into European football in 1992, Maccabi Tel Aviv also turned their attention to leaving their mark in this prestigious competition as well. The 1992–93 season marked the first time Maccabi Tel Aviv competed in UEFA Champions League qualifiers and in the first round they defeated the Maltese club Valletta but lost to Belgian side Club Brugge in the second round. In the 1994–95 season, Maccabi were knocked out in the second round of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup by German side Werder Bremen on a 2–0 aggregate. The following season Maccabi once again tried their luck in the Champions League qualifiers and almost succeeded, but a 2–1 aggregate loss to the Swiss club Grasshopper handed the latter the keys to the group stages. In 1996, it was the powerful Turkish side Fenerbahçe that stood between Maccabi and the group stages and in the resultant UEFA Cup competition they encountered, and subsequently lost to, the Spanish club Tenerife. In the 1999–00 season, Maccabi got past Lithuanian opponents FBK Kaunas in the UEFA Cup qualifiers but then lost to French competitors Lens 4–3 on aggregate in round one.

In the 1990s Maccabi Tel Aviv were blessed with many talented players, among them defenders Amir Shelach and the Brumer brothers Gadi and Alon, midfielder Noam Shoham and strikers Meir Melika and Nir Sivilia. Leading the team into battle was the genius of captain Nir Klinger, the free-kick artistry of Itzik Zohar and perhaps the greatest player in Maccabi Tel Aviv&#x27;s history, midfielder Avi Nimni. In 1997, the &quot;Mofet&quot; Group broke up and the club was taken over by Loni Herzikovich.

===2000s===

With a particularly attacking style of football promoted by head coach Nir Klinger, the second millennium got off to a very good start for Maccabi Tel Aviv, who won two consecutive coveted State Cups. The first came in the 2000–01 season, one that saw Maccabi finish just fourth in the table but with the highest number of goals of any club in the Israeli Premier League, 71. Particularly memorable was Maccabi&#x27;s 7–0 demolition of Beitar Jerusalem towards the end of the season and the jaw-dropping total of 10 goals to just one reply against Hapoel Rishon Lezion in January of that same year. It was that exceptional attacking prowess that resulted in Maccabi&#x27;s receiving the State Cup from the country&#x27;s president after a 3–0 victory over Maccabi Petah Tikva in the final.

The following season will largely be remembered for the tragic event that occurred on 26 January 2002 during a match against Beitar Jerusalem. Without a preceding incident, Maccabi defender Meni Levi suddenly collapsed in the middle of the pitch, picked himself up and then collapsed again. He received treatment on the pitch for quite a long time before being rushed to a hospital. The game, in the meantime, was not resumed. For a number of years Levi received treatment at the rehabilitation facility Beit Levinstein in Ra&#x27;anana but unfortunately was unable to recover and was returned to his family. Subsequently, the club decided to retire Levi&#x27;s number twelve jersey entirely. As the year progressed the team succeeded in recovering from this tragic incident and ended the season with their second State Cup title in as many years. In the final, Maccabi Tel Aviv won a penalty shoot-out against that season&#x27;s champion, Maccabi Haifa, after extra time saw the two sides locked in a goalless draw.
The following season Maccabi Tel Aviv won a dramatic league championship from title rivals Maccabi Haifa. On the eve of the last day of the season, head coach Nir Klinger&#x27;s lads led the league table on goal difference alone. On the day itself Maccabi Haifa led 0–5 at half time against Ashdod while Maccabi were still looking for their first goal against Hapoel Petah Tikva. Only in the second half did they score the three goals (to no reply) that pushed their goal difference past Maccabi Haifa and brought the Championship plate back to the Maccabi Tel Aviv trophy cabinet.

Maccabi&#x27;s most significant achievement of the decade came in the 2004–05 season when the team reached the group stages of the Champions League.&lt;ref name=&quot;Group D 04/05&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the play-off stages they beat the Greek side PAOK Thessaloniki and became Israel&#x27;s second club, after Maccabi Haifa two years earlier, to reach the group stages. There they were drawn against three giants of European football, the German Bayern Munich, the Italian Juventus and the Dutch Ajax. Nonetheless, Maccabi succeeded in finishing the group stage with a precious four points after beating Ajax and drawing with Juventus at home. Paradoxically they ended an unstable league season eighth in the table but once again came away with the State Cup after winning a penalty shoot-out in a final against Maccabi Herzliya that ended 2–2 after extra time.

After this third State Cup in five seasons, Maccabi&#x27;s fortunes dipped drastically and other clubs took turns winning the league and the Cup. The 2005–06 season will be remembered in particular, earning the nickname &quot;the Galacticos season&quot;, for a team that brought together the likes of Israeli international Eyal Berkovic, Croatian star Đovani Roso and Maccabi all-time great Avi Nimni. Despite the star-studded squad, Maccabi failed to translate that quality into winning form and ended the season in the bottom half of the table.

On 28 December 2007, during the 2007–08 season, the club was transferred to the hands of billionaire Alex Shnaider. Shnaider diverted large sums of money to the club, mainly for paying off debts and for developing the youth department. In 2008 alone, Shnaider invested nearly NIS₪40 million from his own money into the club. Overall, in just over a year&#x27;s time, Shnaider had invested approximately US$20 million in the team.

On 3 August 2009, Shnaider passed the team on to another Canadian billionaire&#x27;s hands, Mitchell Goldhar. This handover was done for no cost, but against a commitment to pay off the team&#x27;s debts to Loni Herzkovitz.

===2010s===

In the 2010–11 season, Maccabi enjoyed one moment of glory in Europe, beating a strong Greek Olympiacos side 1–0 in the home leg of the UEFA Europa League qualifiers. The victory sent Maccabi into the first round of the competition where, despite an exciting 4–3 victory in the home leg, Maccabi failed to surpass French giants Paris Saint-Germain after a 2–0 loss in the French capital. The following season Maccabi claimed a famous victory against Greek side Panathinaikos, beating them 3–0 at Bloomfield Stadium in the qualifying stages of the Europa League.&lt;ref name=&quot;Group E 11/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was a year Maccabi actually did succeed in reaching the group stage of the competition but collected just two points in a group that contained Turkish side Beşiktaş, the Ukrainians Dynamo Kyiv and the English Stoke City.
The 2012–13 season finally put an end to Maccabi Tel Aviv&#x27;s bad fortunes in the league as they won their first championship in a decade. Under the stewardship of the new Director of Football Jordi Cruyff and Spanish head coach Óscar García, Maccabi dominated the league and claimed the title by thirteen points ahead of their nearest rival. They finished the season with the league&#x27;s highest goal total of 78 while conceding the fewest with just 30 goals conceded. Leading that attack was the league&#x27;s highest goal scorer, striker Eliran Atar with 22, but he was joined by midfielder Maharan Radi with eight (plus eleven assists), young striker Mu&#x27;nas Dabbur with ten and Swedish striker Rade Prica (eight) and midfielder Eran Zahavi (seven) who both arrived at the club in the January transfer window. In defense, the tone was set by Maccabi&#x27;s two center halves, Eitan Tibi and the Spaniard Carlos García, backed up by the excellence of Maccabi Tel Aviv&#x27;s Nigerian goalkeeper, Vincent Enyeama.
The 2013–14 season saw a change in the club&#x27;s Coach Position with Paulo Sousa replacing Oscar Garcia, as well as several players leaving and new players arriving. Notably Vincent Enyeama left for Lille with Goalkeeper Juan Pablo Colinas joining between the posts, and Nikola Mitrović joining from Videoton. The team continued its success in the league and claimed another championship behind Eran Zahavi&#x27;s goal scoring. The Team&#x27;s main rivals this season were Hapoel Be&#x27;er Sheva who came in second. The team also enjoyed relative success in the UEFA Europa League as they advanced to the round of 32 after a difficult group stage, before ultimately being ousted by Basel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Group F 13/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014–15 season was characterized by a difficult start. The 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict meant that the qualifying games to the UEFA Champions League were held away from Israel, leading Maccabi to be ousted from both the Champions League and the Europa League. There was also a shake-up at the coach position as Paulo Sousa left for Basel. Óscar García returned but left before the beginning of the season and was replaced by Pako Ayestarán. During the Tel Aviv Derby on 3 November 2014, a fan from Hapoel Tel Aviv broke onto the pitch with an intent to assault Maccabi Star Eran Zahavi who was shown a red card for defending himself. In the aftermath of the event, both teams had 1 point redacted and forfeited the match. However, this event didn&#x27;t stop Maccabi Tel Aviv from being the first Israeli team to win all three local Trophies: the Premier League, the State Cup and the Toto Cup. Notable new players in the team were Nosa Igiebor and Eden Ben Basat. The best player in the squad was still Eran Zahavi who broke the Israeli Record for consecutive scoring games and scored 27 goals throughout the season.


In the 2015–16 season, the team qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stage for the first time in 11 years. They were a member of Group G, along with Chelsea, Porto and Dynamo Kyiv.&lt;ref name=&quot;Group G 14/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, these three elite clubs proved to be too much for Maccabi Tel Aviv to handle, and they lost all 6 of their group stage matches, scoring just 1 goal while conceding 16. Maccabi were eliminated in the group stage of the Toto Cup AI. In the league, Maccabi&#x27;s main rivals for the title were Hapoel Be&#x27;er Sheva. After a loss to Hapoel Be&#x27;er Sheva at Bloomfield Stadium thanks to two clinical goals from Elyaniv Barda and Maor Melikson, head coach Slavisa Jokanovic was signed by Fulham and replaced by Peter Bosz, who helped improve Maccabi&#x27;s performances in the league. Be&#x27;er Sheva fell under huge pressure before the end of the season, which helped Maccabi fight back and get into the title race again. Maccabi managed to take advantage of Be&#x27;er Sheva&#x27;s bad results, beating Beitar Jerusalem in a close and dramatic tie, where Eran Zahavi scored the winning goal for Maccabi in the 90th minute, breaking the goalscoring record of Nisim Elmaliah by scoring more than 31 goals in one league season. In the biggest game of the season, against Hapoel Be&#x27;er Sheva, a win would have brought Maccabi to 1st place because of their goal difference, while any other result would have left Hapoel Be&#x27;er Sheva alone at 1st place with a 3 points advantage and only 3 games to go. Maccabi tied the game 0-0, leaving Hapoel Be&#x27;er Sheva 3 points ahead of Maccabi and top of the league. Maccabi continued their bad form and dropped points again in their next game, this time against Hapoel Ra&#x27;anana, drawing 1-1, and the title came closer to Hapoel Be&#x27;er Sheva, who had a 5 points advantage with only 2 games to go. The last game of the league season was a rollercoaster of emotions for Maccabi fans who were hoping for Be&#x27;er Sheva to lose against Sakhnin, and who needed to defeat Maccabi Haifa to win the championship. Sakhnin took the lead after 6 minutes, however, Be&#x27;er Sheva responded quickly and got a goal after only 10 minutes. At that stage, Be&#x27;er Sheva were championed as Maccabi kept on searching for a goal, which finally came when Eran Zahavi scored, which meant Maccabi were the champions at the time. 12 minutes after Maccabi&#x27;s goal, Be&#x27;er Sheva went 2–1 up. Maccabi got a 6–0 lead over Haifa but was unable to win the title, as Be&#x27;er Sheva had scored the third goal and became champions. The State Cup Final was Maccabi&#x27;s last chance to win a trophy this season, and they faced Maccabi Haifa in the final. However, Haifa defeated Maccabi 1-0 and won their first cup in 18 years, which caused Peter Bosz to be released to Ajax as Maccabi had finished with no trophies. The 2015–16 season was called &quot;the worst year in Jordi&#x27;s Era&quot;. Eran Zahavi, Maccabi&#x27;s star player, was sold to Guangzhou R&amp;F for 8.5 million dollars at the end of the season.

The following campaign Shota Arveladze was named Head Coach and successfully helped the Club advance to the Europa League Group stages where they played Zenit, Alkmaar and Dundalk. Over the course of the 2016/17 season, Maccabi defeated Hapoel Tel Aviv 5:0 which tied the biggest Derby victory set in 1969/70. Arveladze left the Club midway through the campaign and was replaced by Angolan Lito Vidigal as the squad ended the season in 2nd place while falling in the Cup Final.

Jordi Cruyff was appointed Head Coach for the 2017–18 season as the Sports Director moved down to the sidelines in his 6th season with the Yellow &amp; Blue. The Club advanced to the Europa League Group Stage for the second straight season where they faced Astana, Slavia Prague and Villarreal, defeating the La Liga side in Spain 1:0. Maccabi captured the Toto Cup while finishing in second place in league play.

Vladimir Ivic was appointed head coach at the start of the 2018/19 season. Under the Serbian coach, Maccabi had an impressive season and set many records. The Yellow &amp; Blue won the league championship by a 31-point margin, recorded 89 points (club record), and won the title by the end of March, the earliest ever. The club also won the Toto Cup for the second straight season with a 2:1 win over Maccabi Haifa in the final.

The following season under Ivic the team continued their successful run in the league and won a second successive league title. During that season, Maccabi kept a clean sheet for 14 matches, conceded a total of only 10 league goals thus shattering the all-time Israeli top-flight records. At the end of the season, Ivic ended his role as Maccabi&#x27;s Head Coach.

===2020s===
Ahead of the 2020–21 season Maccabi appointed Giorgos Donis of Greece as the successor of Ivic before the league season had begun. The club added two titles to their trophy cabinet by winning the Super Cup and Toto Cup.

In June 2023 Maccabi appointed Robbie Keane to as their next coach.

<text>Football Club Copenhagen (, ), commonly known as F.C. København, F.C. Copenhagen, Copenhagen or simply FCK, is a professional Danish football club in Copenhagen, Denmark. FCK was founded in 1992 as a superstructure on top of Kjøbenhavns Boldklub and Boldklubben 1903, with Kjøbenhavns Boldklub from 1876 being the oldest club in Continental Europe.

F.C. Copenhagen has won a shared record 15 Danish Football Championships and a shared record 9 Danish Cups. In European football F.C. Copenhagen has reached the group stage of the UEFA Champions League and the group stage of the UEFA Europa League more times than any other Danish club and are the only Danish club who has reached the knockout stage of the Champions League. As of December 2022, Copenhagen are the highest ranked Scandinavian club in the UEFA team rankings list.

Copenhagen plays its matches at the Parken Stadium, which also serves as the venue for Denmark national football team matches. Since their foundation, FCK have developed a fierce rivalry with Brøndby IF. The Copenhagen Derby games between the two sides have attracted some of the biggest crowds in Danish football history.

==History==
===Early success===
Football Club Copenhagen is, in many ways, both an old and a new club. Even though the club was established in 1992, it is rooted in more than 100 years of club tradition. The club&#x27;s first team represents two separate clubs: Kjøbenhavns Boldklub (continental Europe&#x27;s oldest football club) founded in 1876 and Boldklubben 1903 founded in 1903. Due to financial difficulties throughout the clubs in the Copenhagen area in the 1980s and with Kjøbenhavns Boldklub on the verge of bankruptcy, the two old Copenhagen clubs got together and established the superstructure which is F.C. Copenhagen. Copenhagen used B1903&#x27;s club license to play in the Danish Superliga championship, while Kjøbenhavns Boldklub became the official reserve team of the club. With the rebuilding of the Parken Stadium, Denmark&#x27;s national team stadium, the new club had a modern stadium to play at from the beginning. The initial ambition of the club was continually to qualify for one of the European competitions each season. To reach this goal, the club needed a solid economy, a relatively big fan base and an &quot;attractive and positive style of football.&quot;

Benny Johansen managed the club and started its maiden season well. FCK made its first appearance in the European tournaments when it beat Swiss team Grasshoppers 2–1 in the 1992 UEFA Intertoto Cup. FCK won the Intertoto Cup that year and thereby qualified for the UEFA Cup, where it was eliminated in the second round by French team Auxerre. The club&#x27;s first trophy was the 1992–93 Superliga title, their debut league campaign. For the 1993–94 Superliga season, expectations were high. The season opened with a 0–6 thrashing at the hands of Italian team Milan in the 1993–94 Champions League qualifiers. FCK went on winter break after the first half of the Superliga season in third place. In the spring of 1994, Copenhagen gained on leading team Silkeborg. In the penultimate match of the season, the two teams met at the Parken Stadium. In front of a record-setting attendance of 26,679, FCK won the match 4–1. The club was one point ahead of Silkeborg, but because FCK lost 3–2 to Odense in the final game of the season, it had to settle for second place.

===Years of underachievement===
For the next three seasons, Copenhagen had little success in the Superliga, despite winning two Danish Cups. The team won the 1995 Cup final against Akademisk Boldklub with a 5–0 win, qualifying for European football once again, despite mediocre results in the league. Kim Brink took over as manager in 1996, but despite winning the second Cup trophy for the club, the eighth-place finish in the 1996–97 Superliga season prompted another change in managers.

===Flemming Østergaard joins the board===
In February 1997, Flemming Østergaard, later given the nickname &quot;Don Ø,&quot; joined the board of the club as vice chairman and CEO. After a successful IPO, generating DKK 75 million, FCK was introduced on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange in November 1997. The 1997–98 season marked the first season that Copenhagen averaged more than 10,000 spectators at home, and the club bought their stadium Parken for DKK 138 million in June 1998. The self-acclaimed &quot;best manager in Denmark,&quot; Christian Andersen, began managing the club in January 1999. After 75 controversial days, however, he was fired in March 1999; Sports Director Niels-Christian Holmstrøm explained Andersen had created frustration among the players.

In 1999, Copenhagen made its impact in Europe when it faced English side Chelsea in the second round UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. In the first leg away at Stamford Bridge, Bjarne Goldbæk gave Copenhagen the lead nine minutes before the end of the match, but Chelsea scored in the last minute of the game. Chelsea later won the second game at Parken with a goal by the Dane Brian Laudrup, knocking out FCK. At the post-match press conference, it was announced that Chelsea&#x27;s Brian Laudrup was signing with Copenhagen in January 1999, with Bjarne Goldbæk moving in the other direction for Chelsea. Laudrup, a four-time Danish Player of the Year award winner, however, could not help Copenhagen improve their league position, and the club ended the year in seventh in the 1998–99 Superliga season. Laudrup only stayed for six months at the club before signing for Ajax at the end of the season. In the 1999–2000 season, F.C. Copenhagen struggled to make any significant impact and finished eighth in the league.

===Champions again===
In the winter 2000 transfer window, South African striker Sibusiso Zuma was signed from South African side Orlando Pirates, and in May 2000, English manager Roy Hodgson became the new manager. From the 2000–01 season, the club started to improve. The club won its second Superliga championship, winning 3–1 in the last Copenhagen Derby match of the season. One of the goals scored in this match, a bicycle kick by Zuma, was later voted the Danish goal of the year, was voted the best Superliga goal of the decade in December 2009, and in 2013 voted as the greatest moment in the history of FCK. Roy Hodgson broke his contract with Copenhagen a few weeks after having won the championship, signing with Italian team Udinese, and he was replaced by Swede Kent Karlsson. The 2001 season is also remembered for a highly dramatic event. During training on 13 March 2001 charismatic midfielder Ståle Solbakken suffered a heart attack. He was rapidly attended to by club doctor Frank Odgaard who found that his heart had stopped beating and started to administer cardiac massage. Upon the ambulance&#x27;s arrival, Solbakken was pronounced clinically dead at the scene, but on the way to the hospital in the ambulance he was revived nearly seven minutes later. He survived the episode and had a pacemaker fitted. Shortly after, on medical advice, he announced his playing retirement, but would later return to the club and become its most successful manager.

Copenhagen faced Italian team Lazio for qualification to the 2001–02 Champions League. A 2–1 win for FCK in the first game proved moot, as Lazio ultimately progressed with a 5–3 aggregate score. Copenhagen thus entered the 2001–02 UEFA Cup, where it defeated Dutch giants Ajax 1–0 on a goal from left back Niclas Jensen. In the next round, German powerhouse Borussia Dortmund eliminated Copenhagen. The 2001–02 Superliga season also ended in disappointment for the club, as Brøndby won the championship on goal difference after FCK had caught up with Brøndby&#x27;s ten-point lead after the first half of the season. In the second-last round of the 2002–03 Superliga season, FCK faced Brøndby at Brøndby Stadium. In extra time, Hjalte Nørregaard scored his first goal for Copenhagen and brought the championship back to Parken for the club&#x27;s third ever league title.

In the Champions League second qualifying round in 2004–05, FCK won the first match against Slovenian club ND Gorica 2–1, but later lost at Parken 0–5. Under Backe, Copenhagen went on to win the 2004 and 2006 Danish championships and the 2004 Danish Cup. Copenhagen also won the inaugural 2004–05 edition of the Royal League tournament, beating Swedish team IFK Göteborg on penalty shootout in the 2005 final. Copenhagen repeated the achievement in the 2006 edition of the tournament, this time beating Norwegian team Lillestrøm SK 1–0 in the 2006 final. Backe became the longest-serving coach for FCK before leaving the club in December 2005. Former Copenhagen player Ståle Solbakken took over as manager.

===European ambitions===
For the 2006–07 season, Danish national team player Jesper Grønkjær reinforced Copenhagen. FCK looked forward to the 2006–07 Champions League qualifiers, where it beat Ajax. For the first time in the club&#x27;s history, FCK entered the group stage of the Champions League, being grouped with Celtic, Benfica and Manchester United, all former winners of the trophy. Despite not losing a game at Parken (Benfica 0–0, Manchester United 1–0 and Celtic 3–1), FCK failed to qualify from the Champions League group stage after losing all of its away games. On 9 May, Copenhagen defeated Brøndby 1–0 and won its fifth Danish championship in seven years with four games to spare in the league.

In the 2007–08 season, Copenhagen lost the third qualification round of the Champions League with a 1–3 aggregate score to Benfica. After beating Lens 3–2, FCK qualified for the group stages of the 2007–08 UEFA Cup, where it played Panathinaikos (H), Lokomotiv Moscow (A), Atlético Madrid (H) and Aberdeen. Copenhagen fell to Panathinaikos and Atlético, but a win against Lokomotiv meant that the club needed only a draw against Aberdeen to qualify for the next round. However, a 0–4 defeat to Aberdeen put them out of the tournament. In the 2007–08 Superliga season, Copenhagen finished third, with AaB taking the title.

In the 2008–09 season, Copenhagen began strong. The team qualified for the 2008–09 UEFA Cup group stage by eliminating Cliftonville, Lillestrøm and FC Moscow. In the group, FCK lost at home to Saint-Étienne and drew 1–1 against Valencia. With a 1–1 draw against Rosenborg and a win over Club Brugge, Copenhagen qualified for the knockout phase of the competition, where it drew 2–2 in the first leg of the round of 32 against Manchester City on 19 February 2009. The club lost 1–2 in the second leg, and were eliminated, but not in disappointment as the club had gone far in the competition. In the domestic league, FCK battled for first place with Brøndby and Odense. Eventually, Copenhagen won the Cup final against AaB and claimed the league title with one game to spare in the tournament, thus securing the Double for the second time in the club&#x27;s history. 2010 proved to be yet another European success. Even though the team lost the 2009–10 Champions League playoff match to APOEL with a 2–3 aggregate loss, the team had already qualified to the 2009–10 Europa League group stage by eliminating FK Mogren and Stabæk. With two victories over Sparta Prague, (1–0 at home, 3–0 away and a victory at home against Romanian club CFR Cluj, Copenhagen qualified for the round of 32 to face Marseille. The match-up, however, resulted in two 1–3 losses for Copenhagen, thus eliminating them from the competition.

The team&#x27;s qualification to the 2010–11 Champions League was secured after beating BATE Borisov (0–0 / 3–2) and Rosenborg (1–2 / 1–0). The team thus entered the group stage in Group D and met Barcelona, Panathinaikos and Rubin Kazan. After a 3–1 win against Panathinaikos in their last group stage match, they qualified for the round of 16—thereby becoming the first-ever Danish club to reach the stage in the Champions League—where Chelsea defeated them, although keeping a clean sheet at Stamford Bridge.

===Solbakken returns===
Copenhagen won the 2012–13 Danish Superliga to secure a direct place in the group stage of the 2013–14 Champions League. However, after a horrific start to the 2013–14 Danish Superliga season, FCK fired manager Ariël Jacobs, rehiring Ståle Solbakken as his replacement. Solbakken was given a two-year contract with the option for a further two-year extension. In the Champions League, the club was placed into Group B alongside Real Madrid, Juventus and Galatasaray. FCK secured four points by drawing 1–1 against Juventus at home and winning 1–0 at home over Galatasaray after a great goal by Daniel Braaten. The club, however, conceded its first-ever Champions League group stage home defeat after falling 0–2 to Real Madrid in the last round of the group stage.

Copenhagen finished the 2013–14 league in second place, despite having been situated third for numerous weeks. A 3–2 away win against FC Midtjylland saw them closing in on the second place. In the last round of the league, FCK beat Odense Boldklub 3–2 at home whilst Midtjylland lost their game 3–1, ensuring Copenhagen&#x27;s seizure of second place and its subsequent spot in the qualifying round of the 2014–15 Champions League. Copenhagen was drawn against Ukrainian outfit Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk in the third qualifying round. After an aggregate victory of 2–0 over Dnipro, Copenhagen was drawn against German club Bayer Leverkusen in the play-off round. The Germans, however, defeated Copenhagen 7–2 aggregate, dropping Copenhagen to contention in the 2014–15 Europa League. In the Europa League, Copenhagen finished last in its group with one win one draw and four losses. The 2014–15 season ended with Copenhagen winning the Danish Cup and finishing second in the Superliga.

The 2015–16 season began with FCK bringing in six new players, most notably Danish international and former AaB player Kasper Kusk. By placing second in 2014–15, Copenhagen began in the second qualifying round of the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League, where they were drawn against Welsh club Newtown, defeating them 5–1 on aggregate to qualify them for the next round against Czech outfit Baumit Jablonec. The opening game of the 2015–16 Danish Superliga ended in a 2–1 away win for FCK against Esbjerg fB through goals from Marvin Pourié and Nicolai Jørgensen. Despite a 0–1 away win over Baumit Jablonec, Copenhagen lost its home game 2–3, resulting in a 3–3 aggregate loss on the away goals rule. This marked the first time in ten years that Copenhagen failed to qualify for either the Champions League or Europa League. On 5 May, the Danish Cup was won, after a 2–1 win Over AGF, with goals from Nicolai Jørgensen and William Kvist.

After winning the title the previous season, Copenhagen would compete in the 2016–17 Champions League qualifiers. In the playoff round they met APOEL, and was faced with the challenge on getting revenge after their tie against them in 2009. The first leg at Parken stadium ended 1–0 to the home team, and in the second leg, Copenhagen equalised in the 86th minute via Federico Santander&#x27;s shot from a wide angle, qualifying for the group stage, with an aggregate score of 2–1. Copenhagen were subsequently placed in a group with Leicester City, Porto and Club Brügge. They would after 2 wins, 1 loss and 3 draws, finish 3rd in their group and move on to the 2016–17 Europa League Round of 32 where they met Ludogorets, whom they beat 2–1 on aggregate. In the round of 16, they met Ajax. In the first leg at home, Copenhagen won 2–1. The away leg finished 2–0 to Ajax, and Copenhagen were knocked out of the tournament, with that seasons achievements in the Europa League being their best finish in the competition at the time. Domestically, the season was another season to enjoy for fans of the club. Copenhagen won the league with the closest competition, Brøndby, finishing 24 points behind them. At the time they were crowned champions, following a draw against FC Nordsjælland they were unbeaten in the league, with their first loss of the season coming against FC Midtjylland 2 rounds later, and subsequently another loss against Lyngby BK the round right after. Copenhagen also reached the cup final, where they met arch-rivals Brøndby. With the match at 1–1, Copenhagen secured the win with two goals in rapid succession, in the 83rd and 85th minutes, scored by Santander and Cornelius respectively, thus resulting in the club from the capital winning their third consecutive cup final, along with their second consecutive domestic double.

In September 2019, the club announced that it would change its name in European competitions and would subsequently be known as F.C. Copenhagen with UEFA changing their abbreviation &#x27;KOB&#x27; to &#x27;CPH&#x27;.

Winning the 2018–19 Danish Superliga placed Copenhagen in the second qualifying round of the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, beating Welsh outfit The New Saints. The following round against Red Star Belgrade ended 2–2 on aggregate, with Copenhagen pulling the shortest straw and going out in penalties, thus sending Copenhagen to the UEFA Europa League instead. Here Latvian team Riga were beaten 3–2 on aggregate thus securing qualification for the group stage. Copenhagen finishing second in Group B contested with FC Lugano, Dynamo Kyiv and Scandinavian rivals Malmö FF. Copenhagen were then drawn against Scottish outfit Celtic in the first knockout round of the UEFA Europa League. The first match in Telia Parken finished 1–1, whilst Copenhagen won the return leg 3–1 at Celtic Park. The opponent for the next round were the Turkish club Istanbul Başakşehir. The game ended 1–0 with Copenhagen falling to a late penalty converted by Edin Višća. The subsequent return match in Copenhagen was temporarily put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 5 August 2020, Copenhagen won 3–0 over Istanbul Başakşehir to reach the quarter-finals for the first time in their history. In the quarter-finals, Copenhagen lost 0–1 to Manchester United with a penalty from Bruno Fernandes coming in after extra time.

After poor results in the beginning of the 2020–21 Danish Superliga, and failure to qualify for the 2020–21 Europa League following a 0–1 defeat to HNK Rijeka, Ståle Solbakken was sacked by the club, and Hjalte Bo Nørregaard took over as caretaker manager, until Jess Thorup was appointed in 11 November 2020.

=== Thorup era ===
Despite improvements in performance, Copenhagen finished third in the 2020–21 Danish Superliga, missing out on the title and direct qualification for the UEFA Champions League. They did, however, secure a place in the 2021–22 Europa Conference League second qualifying round.

Copenhagen bounced back in the 2021–22 season, reclaiming the Danish Superliga title. This marked their return to domestic dominance after a two-year hiatus, finishing ahead of league rivals FC Midtjylland. Key players like Pep Biel and Jonas Wind were instrumental, although Wind&#x27;s mid-season departure to Wolfsburg required adjustments to the squad. In Europe, the club competed in the inaugural UEFA Europa Conference League. They topped their group and progressed to the Round of 16, where they faced PSV Eindhoven. The first leg ended in a high-scoring 4–4 draw at the Philips Stadion. However, last-minute injuries to key players Kamil Grabara and Rasmus Falk and the suspension of Khouma Babacar left Copenhagen with a weakened squad for the second leg, which they lost 0–4 at home, resulting in elimination from the competition.

The 2022–23 season for Copenhagen began with optimism as the club qualified for the Champions League group stage for the first time since 2016–17. They achieved this by defeating Turkish champions Trabzonspor 2–1 on aggregate in the playoff round. Copenhagen was drawn into a challenging group with Manchester City, Borussia Dortmund, and Sevilla, signaling a significant step up in competition.

Domestically, the start of the Superliga season was marked by inconsistent performances. By September, the team had lost six of their opening 10 league matches, placing them far from the top of the table and raising concerns about their form. These struggles came in contrast to their Champions League qualification success, creating a sharp division between their European and domestic performances.

On 20 September 2022, Jess Thorup was dismissed as head coach due to the team&#x27;s poor domestic results and concerns about their competitiveness in the league.

=== A young Jacob Neestrup takes charge ===
Jacob Neestrup, previously the assistant coach, was appointed as the new head coach the same day. Under his management, the team showed signs of improvement. In the 2022–23 Champions League group stage, Copenhagen managed to secure three draws at home, 0–0 against Sevilla (managed by Thorup), 0–0 against Manchester City, but following a 0–3 loss away to Sevilla sealed Copenhagen&#x27;s 4th-place finish in the group and did not advance to the knockout stage. In the last group stage game, Copenhagen also drew 1-1 against Borussia Dortmund, where young talent Hákon Arnar Haraldsson scored the equalizer in the 41st minute following Thorgan Hazard&#x27;s opener in the 23rd minute.

Domestically, Copenhagen&#x27;s form improved following Neestrup’s appointment. The team went unbeaten in the first 20 matches under his leadership and, after a victory against FC Nordsjælland in the Championship round, climbed to the top of the Superliga standings. The winter transfer window saw the arrival of Diogo Gonçalves and Jordan Larsson, while Victor Kristiansen was sold to Leicester City. Despite a few setbacks, including a tough run of one win in four games, the team regained its form with a crucial 3–1 victory over Brøndby in the away derby on 14 May 2023, despite the absence of key defenders Kevin Diks and Denis Vavro, who were suspended, and the injury to Davit Khocholava.

Copenhagen went on to win the Superliga title, securing their 15th championship. The victory came after a dramatic penultimate match day, where a loss for FC Nordsjælland ensured Copenhagen’s title. The season also saw the team win the Danish Cup, defeating AaB 1–0 in the final following a goal by Diogo Gonçalves in the 48th minute. Neestrup’s first season in charge was marked by a significant turnaround in the team’s fortunes, leading to both domestic and European achievements, including the club&#x27;s third star on their shirt.

The season also saw a rise in attendance at home matches, with an average of 28,860 spectators per game, reflecting an increase in fan support compared to the previous year.

Copenhagen&#x27;s 2023–24 season was a blend of strong European performances and domestic struggles. The team showed resilience in their Champions League group stage, navigating a challenging group to progress to the Round of 16. Despite being eliminated by Manchester City, Copenhagen earned praise for their memorable results.

One of the standout matches came against Manchester United, where Copenhagen triumphed 4–3 in a thrilling encounter. Trailing 2–0 early after former Copenhagen youngster Rasmus Højlund scored twice for United, Copenhagen fought back with two quick goals just before halftime. Mohamed Elyounoussi pulled one back in the 45th minute, followed by a penalty from Diogo Gonçalves in the 45+9th minute to level the score. In the second half, Bruno Fernandes put United ahead with a penalty in the 69th minute, but Copenhagen responded with two late goals—Lukas Lerager in the 83rd minute and youngster Roony Bardghji scoring the winner in the 87th minute.

Copenhagen also earned an impressive 0–0 draw against Bayern Munich, holding the German giants to a stalemate in Allianz Arena. In their final group stage match, Copenhagen secured a crucial 1–0 win against Galatasaray, with Lukas Lerager scoring the only goal of the game in the 58th minute, and ensured their advancement to the Round of 16, where they were ultimately eliminated by Manchester City, losing 3–1 in both legs.

In the Danish Superliga, Copenhagen&#x27;s season was marked by a mix of highs and lows. The team started strong, winning their first five matches and briefly occupying the top spot in the league. However, a series of disappointing results, including a 1–2 loss to both Viborg and AGF, saw the club fall down the table. By the midway point, they had slipped to third place.

The Championship round started poorly for Copenhagen, as they suffered a 1–2 loss to both Brøndby and Nordsjælland, followed by a 2–2 draw against Midtjylland. These results left the team trailing in the race for the title. However, a strong late surge of four consecutive wins brought them back into contention, briefly lifting them to first place. Unfortunately, they finished the season with two losses, allowing Brøndby and Midtjylland to overtake them. In a 1–1 draw against Nordsjælland secured third place for Copenhagen, and they subsequently won the European play-off match 2–1 against Randers, securing a spot in the 2024–25 Conference League second qualifying round.

Ahead of the 2024–25 season, Copenhagen unveiled an updated visual identity that strengthens its connection with the city and aligns with the club&#x27;s growing ambitions. The new design, influenced by the club&#x27;s &quot;We are Copenhagen&quot; strategy, includes modernized elements such as a more contemporary logo and the addition of a lioness alongside the lion in the club crest, symbolizing both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams. The updated brand also incorporates inspiration from Copenhagen&#x27;s historic and modern elements, including new typography inspired by the city&#x27;s street signs and an expanded color palette. This revamp aims to enhance Copenhagen&#x27;s identity as both a sports and lifestyle brand, reflecting the club&#x27;s evolving international presence and local roots.

==Stadium==

FCK owns its stadium, the national arena Parken Stadium. It was built in 1992, the same year the club was founded. Until the stadium opened (as Parken) in September 1992, the club played its first home matches at the smaller Østerbro Stadion, which is located adjacent to Parken. Parken has 38,065 seats, 4,000 fewer seats than the original capacity of 42,305.

==Supporters==
After 2000, the club has regularly attracted one of the highest attendances in Scandinavia. The official fan club, F.C. København Fan Club has more than 20,000 members. &quot;FCKFC&quot; was founded on 24 October 1991, approximately half a year before FCK played its first match. Furthermore, there are many unofficial &quot;factions&quot; connected to Copenhagen, the biggest being &quot;Urban Crew&quot;, &quot;Copenhagen Cooligans&quot; and &quot;Copenhagen Casuals&quot;. These are also reported to have friendships with factions from Hamburger SV, Rangers, IFK Helsinki and Helsingborgs IF. For the 2006–07 season, there were 23,795 spectators on average. For many years, the lower part of the &quot;C-stand&quot; at Parken, &quot;Nedre C&quot;, has been the main stand for the supporters of FCK. In 2006, a part of the lower &quot;B-stand&quot; was made a separate fan section for the fans who wanted to create more of an atmosphere and named &quot;Sektion 12&quot;. In general, most of FCK&#x27;s supporters are from, and live, in the Copenhagen area, unlike their rivals, Brøndby IF, who have a reported 57% of their fanbase coming from Jutland. The area Sektion 12 on the lower &quot;B-stand&quot; grew so popular that the fans in a dialogue with the club made it bigger. That meant that the former family-area in the stadium in the other part of the &quot;B-stand&quot; got the whole new area called the &quot;D-stand&quot;. The Sektion 12 area on the whole lower &quot;B-stand&quot; grew more and more popular which meant that the fans had a new dialogue with the club. That dialogue went well for the supporters and the club supported the suggestion of making the upper &quot;B-stand&quot; the second part of Sektion 12. Sektion 12 on the whole &quot;B-stand&quot; is now Northern Europe&#x27;s biggest active stand.

==Copenhagen in European competitions==
Copenhagen&#x27;s first competitive European match was on 16 September 1992, in the 1992–93 UEFA Cup, beating MP 10–1 before losing to AJ Auxerre in the second round. In their first ever UEFA Champions League group stage match in 2006 they beat Manchester United 1–0 at home, via a goal in the 73rd minute by Marcus Allbäck.

Since then, the club has become the most successful Danish team in European competitions, reaching the group stage of the UEFA Champions League six times (2006–07, 2010–11, 2011–12, 2016–17, 2022–23 and 2023–24) and advancing to the round of 16 in 2010–11 and 2023–24.

The closest they came to winning European silverware was in the 2019–20 season, when they reached the quarter-finals of the Europa League, which they lost to Manchester United 0–1 in added extra time.

<text>Cleopatra were an English girl group, consisting of sisters Cleo, Zainam and Yonah Higgins. Their debut single, &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Theme&quot; entered the UK Singles Chart at number 3, and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 26.

==Biography==

===&quot;Comin&#x27; Atcha!&quot;===
The girl group were originally based in Manchester, England with sisters Cleo, Yonah, and Zainam Higgins. At first they were known as Cleopatra and the Attractions. At that point Cleo was the lead singer with Yonah and Zainam serving as backup singers and dancers. They later dropped that name and became known as the band Cleopatra. Their debut single was &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Theme&quot;, which was taken from their debut album &quot;Comin&#x27; Atcha!&quot;, and it entered the UK Singles Chart at number 3 giving them their first Top 5 hit single.

The next three singles—&quot;Life Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot;, a cover of The Jackson 5&#x27;s &quot;I Want You Back&quot; and &quot;Thank ABBA for the Music&quot;—all followed the same success by reaching the top 5, gaining the girls BRIT Awards and MOBO Awards nominations. They performed at the 1999 BRIT Awards and were nominated for Best British Newcomer. Madonna signed Cleopatra to her Maverick label and introduced them to the United States at Nickelodeon&#x27;s 11th Annual Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, where they performed their debut single, &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Theme&quot;. It was released shortly afterwards, reaching number 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number 16 on the US Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The video was also popular, peaking at number 4 on the &quot;TRL&quot; Top 10 countdown. Their debut album &quot;Comin&#x27; Atcha&quot; entered the US top 30 in July 1998 and sold over 300,000 copies. The group filmed a live show for a 60-minute Disney Channel special, &quot;Cleopatra in Concert&quot;, where they performed their biggest hits aboard the Disney cruise ship, Disney Magic. The show also contained a behind-the-scenes look into the lives of the three sisters over a four-day Bahamas cruise.

Cleopatra were invited to support the Spice Girls on the UK leg of their sell out Spiceworld Tour playing to 150,000 fans at Wembley Stadium. They were also invited to perform at the Vatican Christmas Carol Concert, by request of Pope John Paul II, an event which is broadcast around the world. Backed by a 100-piece orchestra, they sang &quot;O Come All Ye Faithful&quot; and &quot;Silent Night&quot;. The performance was later released on DVD in 2004 as &quot;All-Star Christmas - From the Vatican&quot;. They covered the Bee Gees song &quot;I&#x27;ve Gotta Get a Message to You&quot;, renaming it &quot;Gotta Get a Message to You&quot;, for the tribute album of the same name. They were also asked to record a cover of the disco song &quot;Right Back Where We Started From&quot; for &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; by Disney.

===&quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;===
Cleopatra moved onto their second album &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;, working with top record producers, including Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Dallas Austin, Daryl Simmons, Cutfather &amp; Joe, and Stargate. They shot their album cover with photographer Markus Klinko. They toured the US in 2000 promoting the lead single from &quot;Steppin Out&quot;, &quot;U Got It&quot;. They promoted the single on various television programs including &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and &quot;The Queen Latifah Show&quot;.

Also as the new spokeswomen for cosmetics firm CoverGirl, they sang the theme tune for their new make-up line &#x27;Triple Lipstick&#x27; television advertisement. The advert, narrated by Cleo, was filmed on Miami&#x27;s South Beach in 2000 and saw the girls on stage performing the theme song. They then moved on to tour Japan and promoted their Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis produced Japanese single &quot;Yes, The Party&#x27;s Going Right&quot;. They were invited to perform a mini-concert for the Sultan of Brunei and his royal family.

However, changes within Warner and everyone who was working on the Cleopatra project led to lack of promotion of their UK single, &quot;Come and Get Me&quot; which entered the UK Singles Chart at #29; the &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot; release date for the UK was pushed back, and the album was eventually never released in the UK. The label wanted Cleo as a solo artist, and this led to the group&#x27;s parting ways with Warner.

===Television sitcom===
On Christmas Eve 1998, CITV premiered Cleopatra&#x27;s one-hour Christmas Special for their new sitcom, with a host of stars to help launch the show. The series had two seasons: Season 1 &quot;Comin&#x27; Atcha!&quot; and Season 2, &quot;In the House&quot;. The show was twenty minutes per episode and a mix of music and comedy. The plot followed the girls&#x27; lives on tour and at home with their family. Their mother and younger sister were featured in both seasons as themselves.

===Later works===
In 2005, the group came together for a one-off performance on ITV1&#x27;s &quot;Hit Me, Baby, One More Time&quot;. They later appeared on Living TV&#x27;s &quot;Pop Goes the Band&quot; in 2009. On 17 November 2009, Cleopatra performed a comeback show live at Embassy in London. As of 2016, the band have yet to release any new music.

Cleo appeared as a contestant on series 2 of &quot;The Voice UK&quot;, exiting the show at the semi-finals.

<text>Football Club Shakhtar Donetsk also known as FC Shakhtar Donetsk (), is a Ukrainian professional football club that was based in the city of Donetsk until 2014 when, due to the War in Donbas, the club was forced to move to Lviv, and played matches in Lviv (2014–2016) and in Kharkiv (2017–2020) whilst having its office headquarters and training facilities in Kyiv. In May 2020, Shakhtar started to play home matches at NSC Olimpiyskyi in Kyiv. For the 2023–24 season, Shakhtar will now play home matches once again at Arena Lviv.

Shakhtar has appeared in several European competitions and is often a participant in the UEFA Champions League. The club became the first club in independent Ukraine to win the UEFA Cup in 2009, the last year before the competition was revamped as the Europa League. FC Shakhtar Donetsk is one of two Ukrainian clubs, the other being Dynamo Kyiv, who have won a major UEFA competition.

The club formerly played its home matches in Donetsk at the newly built Donbas Arena, however due to the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2014, the team were forced to relocate to the west in Arena Lviv in the interim. Following the winter break of the 2016–17 season the club then moved again to the Metalist Stadium in Kharkiv ( to the northwest of Donetsk) early in 2017. In May–July 2020 Shakhtar played home matches at NSC Olimpiyskyi in Kyiv.

Shakhtar Donetsk is one of Ukraine&#x27;s most popular football clubs, and is particularly favoured in the eastern Donbas region. On 28 October 2021, Shakhtar had 1.4 million followers on Facebook, the highest in Ukraine.

The club draws its history from the very start of the Soviet football league competitions and is one of the oldest clubs in Ukraine. The club was a member of the Soviet Voluntary Sports Society of Shakhtyor, having connections with other Soviet teams from Karaganda (Kazakhstan), Soligorsk (Belarus), among others. In the late Soviet period, Shakhtar was considered a tough mid-table club of the Soviet Top League and a cup competition specialist after winning the Soviet Cup two years in a row in 1961 and 1962.

==History==
===The club&#x27;s names and etymology===
The team has played under the following names: Stakhanovets (1936–46), Shakhtyor (Shakhtar) (1946–92), and FC Shakhtar (1992–present).

The club has a meaningful association with the Donets Basin underground coal-mining using vertical mining shafts, called &quot;Schacht&quot; in German. This was taken over into Cyrillic &quot;Шахтн&quot;, end re-transcribed into Latin letters as, for example, &quot;shakt&quot; in English use. As part of the so-called Stalin industrialisation and Stakhanovite movement, in 1936 the local football teams of Dynamo sports societies of Horlivka and Stalino (today Donetsk) established a joint team that represented the mining volunteer sports society Stakhanovets (later Shakhter). The team was transferred from the sports society for the NKVD to a trade union &quot;volunteered sports society&quot; (DSO).

Following the World War II, the DSO Stakhanovets changed its name to DSO Shakhter which in the Ukrainian SSR had its local corresponding nomenclature as DSS Shakhtar. The word &quot;Shakhter&quot; or &quot;Shakhtar&quot; means a coal miner working at a sub-surface mine, shafted mine, shakhta is a derivative of shaft.

During the dissolution of the Soviet Union (1989–1992), the Donetsk club was reorganized and commercialized as a professional football team. It also made its Ukrainian name as its only name, Шахтар Донецьк, with &quot;Shakhtar Donetsk&quot; in English, &quot;Schachtar Donezk&quot; in German and &quot;Szachtar Donieck&quot; in Polish, the latter two being languages of countries that hosted international &quot;home&quot; games for the club due to the situation since 2014.

===Early years – first two decades===

The Shakhtar club was originally formed on a decision of the All-Union Council on Physical Culture and Sports of 3 April 1936. It was initially named Stakhanovets, meaning &quot;the participant of Stakhanovite movement&quot;, which derived from Aleksei Stakhanov, a coal-miner in the Donbas and propaganda celebrity in 1935. The first team was based upon two other local teams, the participants of the All-Ukrainian Spartakiads: &quot;Dynamo Horlivka&quot; and &quot;Dynamo Stalino&quot;. The first game was against Dynamo Odesa as part of the 1936 Cup of the Ukrainian SSR (at that time known as Ukrainian spring challenge) and took place on 12 May 1936 at Balitsky Stadium in Horlivka (the first home stadium). The team that played as Stakhonovets Horlivka lost 3–2 after scoring the first goal by Mykhailo Pashchenko, the second goal belonged to Boris Terentiev.

Its first league game in Group V took place on 24 May 1936 against &quot;Dynamo Kazan&quot; was even more disappointing, which miners lost 4–1. Stakhonovets that had on its roster 15 players left for Kazan by train on 20 May. Beside players, as part of delegation there were representative of regional council of physical culture Gololobov and republican referee I.Rozanov. The team returned to Stalino on 28 May and the same day Gololobov in interview to newspaper &quot;Stalinskiy rabochiy&quot; told that &quot;... the game in Kazan with local &quot;Dynamo&quot; was witnessed by 3,000 spectators. With the first minutes, the field hosts offered a high pace.

The &quot;Miners&quot;, who were road weary, could not respond with the same. On the 13th minute they conceded the first goal and by the end of first half, two more. In many respects the reason was poor performance of right halfback Kutsev (who played instead of K.Pashchenko) and right outside forward Korotynsky. Through their flank Dynamo players successfully attacked. In the first half Stakhanovets forwards looked bleak and uncertain. In the second half the game equalized and on 55th minute Fedor Manov opened score to Donetsk team goals. Final score is 4–1 in favor of the hosts.&quot;

Nonetheless, the selective job conducted constructively by the club&#x27;s administration allowed the club to compete successfully at the top level by the end of the 1930s. During the &quot;war championship&quot; of 1941, which was interrupted unexpectedly, the club defeated Soviet champions Dynamo Moscow and after about ten games were placed in fifth in the league. In the last game of that championship, played on 24 June, two days after the start of the Great Patriotic War, which they lost at home to Traktor Stalingrad. During the war many players went to frontlines and perished among which are Ivan Ustinov, Ivan Putyatov, Volodymyr Shkurov, Ivan Horobets, Mykhailo Vasin and others. From the pre-war squad in 1945 there were left only three players Georgiy Bikezin, Mykola Kuznetsov, and Petro Yurchenko.

The All-Union coal mining society of Stakhanovite (Stakhanovets) had changed its name in July 1946 to Shakhtyor (Shakhter) and so did the Sports Society of Donbas Miners. The term Shakhtar or Shakhter (Russian variation) is occupational referring to a miner working in a subterranean mining shaft (see shaft mining), the word &quot;shakhtar&quot; is a local adaptation and derivative of shaft. In the Soviet Union, due to an elevated risk working underground, a subterranean mining job was more compensated in relation to other unskilled work and always in demand.

In 1950, Viktor Fomin was named Ukrainian Footballer of the Year, despite the club finishing only 11th in the league. The first success for the team was in 1951, when it achieved third place in the USSR Championship. The most notable player of that achievement was the striker Aleksandr Ponomarev, who came to finish his football career in Donbas, the region he was born in, and was named Ukrainian Footballer of the Year for 1951. Despite the latest achievement, Shakhtar was relegated at the end of the 1952 season and as part of the re-organization of the team, former player Aleksandr Ponomarev became the head coach of the club. In 1954, Shakhtar under Ponomarev won the Class B League, thus sealing a return to the top league.

===Cup triumphs and establishment in the Soviet League===

In 1958, the players of the club received fewer yellow and red cards than any other team in the championship, for what the &quot;Sovetsky Sport&quot; newspaper awarded the club with the &quot;Fair Play Award.&quot;
In the 1960s, Shakhtar, under Oleg Oshenkov&#x27;s coaching, were three-time USSR Cup finalists, winning it twice in 1961 and 1962. Among the players playing for the club then where defenders Viacheslav Aliabiev and Vladimir Salkov. The club was nicknamed &quot;The Cup Team&quot; due to Shakhtar&#x27;s success in vying for the trophy every year. The Miners&#x27; more notable achievements, however, occurred later from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s.
Despite the departure of the team&#x27;s leader midfielder Anatoliy Konkov, in 1975, Shakhtar under management of former player Vladimir Salkov, earned second place in the USSR Championship and received the right to represent the Soviet Union in European competition. At the end of the season, Shakhtar received the Progress Cup for making the biggest progress from previous season in the league. They received the award again in 1977. In 1978, Shakhtar finished third in the USSR Championship.

In 1979, the team finished second in the league campaign and its captain—striker Vitaliy Starukhin—became the top scorer in the USSR Championship with 26 goals scored, also being named Soviet Footballer of the Year. The club was only two points away from the first place, despite having important players leaving the club before the season, and other important players receiving injuries.

Other important players besides Starukhin at the time were Mykhaylo Sokolovskyi, who went on to set a caps record for the club (for what he received the Club Loyalty Award in 1987), defenders Viktor Zvyahintsev and Valeriy Horbunov, who both made it numerous times to the 33 Top Players of the Soviet Championship lists, and goalkeeper Yuriy Dehteryov, who was named Soviet goalkeeper of the year and took third place for Soviet Footballer of the Year in 1977.

Shakhtar twice, in 1980 and 1983, brought home the crystal USSR Cup to Donetsk and in 1983, it won the USSR Super Cup over then-domestic league champions Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. Shakhtar reached the 1983–84 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup quarter-final, and strikers Viktor Hrachov and Serhiy N. Morozov became joint top scorers of the tournament. In 1987, Shakhtar received the fewest yellow and red cards in the championship, for which the club was awarded the &quot;Soviet Top League Fair Play Award&quot; by &quot;Man and Law&quot; magazine. Between 1982 and 1988, Shakhtar received the &quot;Together With The Club&quot; award five times, an award given for good organization of home games and behaviour of the home fans.

===First decade in independent Ukraine – the beginning of the Akhmetov era===
In the newly independent Ukraine, Shakhtar, along with Dynamo Kyiv, became perennial first place competitors. A bombing-assassination took place at the team&#x27;s stadium, killing club president Akhat Bragin in October 1995. In 1996, Rinat Akhmetov took over as president and invested heavily in the club.

Despite Shakhtar not being a strong contender for the championship at the time, finishing second many times with a large point gap from the first-place position, they won the Ukrainian Cup three times, in 1995 (under the management of former player Vladimir Salkov), 1997 and 2001. In the 1997–98 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Shakhtar were eliminated after a 5–2 aggregate loss to Vicenza, losing the first and second legs. Important players at the time were defenders Serhiy Popov and Mykhaylo Starostyak, goalkeeper Dmytro Shutkov, striker Oleh Matvyeyev (who was top scorer of the Premier League in the 1996–97 season), and midfielders Hennadiy Orbu, Valeriy Kryventsov and Ihor Petrov. Most of the players playing for the team of the time came through the team&#x27;s youth ranks.

Towards the end of the decade, the team finally started to look like a team able to become champion. In 1999, a Shakhtar football academy was opened and now hosts football training for roughly 3,000 youth. In 2000, Andriy Vorobey was named Ukrainian Footballer of the Year by &quot;Komanda&quot;, the first Shakhtar player in independent Ukraine to do so, and became the top scorer in the 2000–01 Vyshcha Liha. That year, Shakhtar competed in the UEFA Champions League for the first time, drawn in a group with Lazio, Arsenal and Sparta Prague. They finished third in the group, qualifying for the UEFA Cup after a 3–0 home win against Arsenal.

===First league triumph===

The club won its first ever Ukrainian Premier League title in the 2001–02 season under coach Nevio Scala, winning by a single point over Dynamo Kyiv. They were also victorious in the 2001–02 Ukrainian Cup, defeating Dynamo 3–2 after extra time in the final. Among the key players at the club at the time were captain defensive midfielder Anatoliy Tymoshchuk, striker Andriy Vorobey, midfielder Hennadiy Zubov and defender Mykhaylo Starostyak. At the end of the season, Tymoshchuk, who emerged as the club&#x27;s leader on the field, was named Ukrainian Footballer of the Year by &quot;Komanda&quot; and &quot;Ukrainskiy Football&quot;.
After multiple managerial changes, in 2004 the Romanian Mircea Lucescu was invited to build a team in Shakhtar. After ten days at the club, he won the 2003–04 Ukrainian Cup and after three months, for the first time in club history, the club made it to the UEFA Champions League group stage, which won him the 2004 Romania Coach of the Year title. The strategy chosen was looking for young talented players in Brazil, which was to form the base of the attack, while the defence would supplied by largely Ukrainian talent in order to adjust to rules forcing teams to have a certain number of local players on the field.

The large amount of Brazilians arriving at the club earned Shakhtar the nickname &quot;the most Brazilian club in Europe&quot;. They won their second Premier League title in the 2004–05 season, but lost to Dynamo Kyiv in the inaugural Ukrainian Super Cup tournament in 2004. They finished as runners up in the 2004–05 Ukrainian Cup, losing to Dynamo in a penalty shoot-out the final.

They retained the Premier League crown in the 2005–06 season and managed to avenge the defeat to Dynamo in the previous Super Cup by defeating them on penalties to win their first-ever Super Cup title. At the end of the season, Anatoliy Tymoshchuk was named Ukrainian Footballer of the Year for by &quot;Ukrainian Football&quot; for the second time, becoming the first Shakhtar player to be named so more than once. Brazilian striker Brandão became the league&#x27;s joint top scorer.

Shakhtar appeared in all three editions of the Channel One Cup, winning the 2007 edition and finishing runners-up in 2008. Having missed out on the league title in 2006–07, Shakhtar regained the title in 2007–08, also being victorious in the Ukrainian Cup after defeating Dynamo Kyiv 2–0 in the final.
Shakhtar&#x27;s attendance levels at league matches have continually risen over the years to a point where they averaged 36,983 spectators over the 2011–12 Premier League season.

===UEFA Cup triumph and domination in Ukraine===

In 2009, they became only the second Ukrainian team to win a European competition (and the first since independence), and the first to win the UEFA Cup after defeating Werder Bremen in the final, with goals from Brazilians Luiz Adriano and Jádson. The victory earned the player Mariusz Lewandowski the 2009 Polish Footballer of the Year award. This also made them the last UEFA Cup winners before the tournament was rebranded as the UEFA Europa League.

Before the start of the 2009–10 season, Shakhtar won the friendly Uhrencup tournament. Shakhtar won the Premier League title in the 2009–10 season, goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov was named Ukraine Premier League MVP by &quot;Komanda&quot;, and Manager Mircea Lucescu was named Romania Coach of the Year for the second time. The 2010–11 season was a very successful one for Shakhtar. They reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League, their then-best-ever performance in the competition.

Captain Darijo Srna was chosen to be part of the Champions League Team of the Season as voted by fans. They also won a domestic treble with victory in the Premier League, Ukrainian Cup and the Super Cup. The successful season did not go unnoticed by the experts, and in 2011, the IFFHS gave Shakhtar a special award for making the biggest progress of the decade among football clubs.

They went on to win the Premier League and Ukrainian Cup in the 2011–12 season. Shakhtar player Yevhen Seleznyov topped the goal scoring charts in the league, with 14 goals, midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan was named Armenian Footballer of the Year, and manager Mircea Lucescu was named 2012 Romania Coach of the Year, receiving the award for the third time. The main players at that time were captain Darijo Srna, defender Yaroslav Rakitskyi, Armenian midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan (who was named Armenian Footballer of the Year twice while playing for Shakhtar) and Brazilian midfielders Fernandinho and Willian.

In the 2012–13 season Shakhtar won the Premier League, Cup and Super Cup. Henrikh Mkhitaryan became the top scorer of the league, setting a Ukrainian championship record of 25 goals. He was also named the Ukraine Premier League MVP by &quot;Komanda&quot;, Armenian Footballer of the Year and the CIS Footballer of the Year for 2012.

===Leaders depart, new titles and war in Donbas===
Prior to the 2013–14 season, many of the club&#x27;s main players were sold after Shakhtar accepted high bids for them – Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Fernandinho and Willian brought the club over €100 million. Shakhtar spent the following summer trying to integrate new young players into the team, who along with the remaining players were to form the backbone of the renewed Shakhtar. Despite selling its leaders, before the 2013–14 season, Shakhtar set a new record for East Europe for number of season tickets sold. Before the beginning of the 2013–14 season, Shakhtar won two friendly tournaments in Abu Dhabi, the Match World Cup, and the Super Cup of Champions played against Russian champions Zenit Saint Petersburg.

In the mid-season break, Shakhtar won the 2014 United Supercup (the second edition of the United Tournament), a tournament between the top-two placed clubs of Ukraine and of Russia, which strengthened Shakhtar&#x27;s status as the strongest club in Eastern Europe. At the end of the 2013–14 season, Shakhtar won the Ukraine Premier League, while Luiz Adriano was the league top scorer. Shakhtar also won the 2014 Ukrainian Super Cup, holding the trophy for the sixth time. Manager Mircea Lucescu was named the 2014 Romania Coach of the Year, receiving the award for the fourth time.

Due to the war in Donbas, Shakhtar had to temporarily move and play its games in Arena Lviv, resulting in very low attendance. As an anti-war protest, the players of Shakhtar refused the initiative to wear the &quot;Glory to the Ukrainian Army&quot; shirts. In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League, Shakhtar finished second in the group stage, therefore qualifying to the next stage. Striker Luiz Adriano equaled both Lionel Messi&#x27;s record of five goals in a Champions League match and Cristiano Ronaldo&#x27;s record of scoring nine goals in the group stage; as a result, UEFA named him MVP of the competition&#x27;s group stage. Shakhtar finished the season second in the 2014–15 Ukrainian Premier League after playing the whole season away from Donbas, with Alex Teixeira finishing as a joint top scorer in the league. At the end of the season, Douglas Costa was sold to Bayern Munich, while Luiz Adriano moved to Milan.

While the club itself moved to a Ukraine-controlled zone, a few prominent Shakhtar players remained in the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic and supported the unrecognised state. Among them were former defender Viktor Zvyahintsev, former goalkeeper Yuriy Dehteryov, former Shakhtar and Ukraine national football team captain Ihor Petrov, and the club&#x27;s first press officer Vyacheslav Sharafutdinov.

During the 2015–16 Ukrainian Premier League, on 16 October, Shakhtar beat Dynamo Kyiv 3–0 in Kyiv and set two new records. One record was that for the first time during a Klasychne derby game in Kyiv a team scored three goals. The other record was that for the first time Shakhtar had more Klasychne derby victories, 26, than Dynamo. In the middle of the season, Alex Teixeira moved to Chinese club Jiangsu Suning for a fee of €50 million, breaking both the Asian and Ukrainian transfer record. The club finished the 2015/16 season as runner up and Marlos was recognised best league player by Komanda. After the 2015–16 season, long-time manager Mircea Lucescu moved on to Zenit Saint Petersburg; he was replaced by the Portuguese Paulo Fonseca, previously of Braga.

Following the winter break of the 2016–17 season, a season when the club won the league, the cup, and the supercup, the club moved to the Metalist Stadium in Kharkiv (241 km to the north of Donetsk). In 2017–18, the club won the league and the cup again, with Facundo Ferreyra becoming the league top scorer and Marlos the league assist leader. In the 2018–19 season, the club won Ukrainian Premier League for the third time in a row. In 2019–20, Shakhtar retained their league title for the fourth time in a row. They also reached the semi-finals of the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League.

==Infrastructure==


Until 2009 Shakhtar had been playing most of its games at the RSC Olimpiyskyi stadium which is a property of administration of Donetsk Oblast and the Serhiy Bubka College of Olympic Reserve. The stadium was built during Soviet period for another Donetsk club, FC Lokomotyv Donetsk and carried its name.

On 29 August 2009 the construction of its new stadium, Donbas Arena, was accomplished and the stadium was opened. Located in the City Park of Culture and Recreation, it has a capacity of 50,149 and has been honored with a UEFA five star rating, the highest rating achievable.

Shakhtar&#x27;s old home, the central Shakhtar Stadium which was built in 1936 and reconstructed four times, is currently being used by Shakhtar Donetsk Reserves. The stadium received some major renovations, including the installation of bench seats in 2000 when Shakhtar made it to the Champions League Group Stage.

A mascot mole (&quot;moles&quot; is a nickname for the club) will entertain spectators during the home matches. Shakhtar are rated 40th by the average game attendance, being the top eastern European club on the rating charts. Before the 2013–14 season, Shakhtar set a new record for Eastern Europe for number of season tickets sold, selling 27,000 season tickets, which means 52% of the seats in Donbas Arena belong to season ticket holders.

From 2014 until the end of 2016, due to the war in Donbas, Shakhtar played its home matches at the Arena Lviv. Following the winter break of the 2016–17 season the club moved to the Metalist Stadium in Kharkiv (250 kilometers to the northwest of Donetsk). Shakhtar played their 2022–23 matches in the Champions League and Europa League at Stadion Wojska Polskiego in Warsaw due to the 2022 invasion. They are set to play their 2023–24 UEFA Champions League matches at Volksparkstadion in Hamburg, Germany.

===Training centre===
Shakhtar Donetsk has its own training facilities for its first team, reserve team and youth academy all located at Kirsha Training Centre.

Due to the war conditions in the eastern Ukraine, Shakhtar temporary venue for its home matches has changed several times, while it was announced that the team will use training facilities in Kyiv. It was clarified that its training facility is the Training base of Olympic Preparation &quot;Sviatoshyn&quot; located away from Kyiv and belongs to the Ukrainian Federation of Trade Unions.

===Youth, academy and reserves===
The club used to field a couple of reserve teams that competed at professional level. By 2015 all reserve teams such as FC Shakhtar-2 Donetsk and FC Shakhtar-3 Donetsk were withdrawn from professional competitions. The club however fields its youth Shakhtar U-21 team in the youth championship of Ukrainian Premier League. Shakhtar also has its football academy that fields four teams in a special youth league designated for teenagers. Since 2012 the club also has a team for the U-19 championship of Ukrainian Premier League.

During the Soviet times the club used to have one youth team named Shakhter-D Donetsk that participated in a separate Soviet championship for doubles. Shakhter-D later was reorganized into FC Shakhtar-2 Donetsk and admitted to the Ukrainian First League.

Due to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the youth academy has relocated to Split, Croatia.
==Crests and colours==

The first logo of the club was designed in 1936, it featured a blue hexagon, with a red &#x27;S&#x27; in the middle, crossed over by a jackhammer. In 1946, when the club was renamed, the logo was changed to black and white, with addition of club&#x27;s name. Later, in the middle of the 1960s, their logo depicted two crossed hammers, with &quot;Shakhtar Donetsk&quot; written in the circle. The crest was added to the kit and remained there since, except for several seasons in the beginning of the 1990s. The club&#x27;s name was depicted in the Russian language until the latest logo was chosen. Therefore, some sources have its name written often as &quot;Shakhter&quot; or rarely &quot;Shakhtyor.&quot;

In 1989, an artist, Viktor Savilov, on the event of the club restructuring offered a draft variant of a logo with elements of the ball and a pitch. Some time later, the logo was remodelled into the present one. The emblem was added to the kit in 1997.

In 2007, during the presentation of the club&#x27;s new stadium, Shakhtar&#x27;s new logo was unveiled. For the first time in over 30 years, the crossed hammers, the traditional symbols of the club, were present on the crest. Also, for the first time the name was written in the Ukrainian language and not Russian.

Since 1961 the official colours are black and orange.

===Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors===
==Supporters and rivalries==

The first riots associated with Shakhtar fans took place on 20 September 1959 in the match against CSKA Moscow, when several dozen Shakhtar supporters ran onto the field, and as a result the match was frustrated. In all matches involving Donetsk, many people came that promoted the development of fan movement in Donetsk. Active development of football movement began in the early 1980s. In the early 2000s to the Ukrainian stadiums came English style – hooliganism. In 2003, during the final of the Ukrainian Cup there was a fierce fight between Dynamo and Shakhtar fans.

The other rivalry was with Metalurh Donetsk. This was another local club and, although not as significant as games against the rivals from the capital, the games between the two Donetsk teams were proclaimed the Donetsk derby. Metalurh went bankrupt in July 2015.

Among the extinguished rivalries are the games against Spartak Moscow and, particularly, the &quot;third place champions&quot; Dinamo Tbilisi of Georgia that took place at times during the Soviet Top League. Another interesting rivalry, the Donbas Derby, is with Zorya Luhansk, which gathered a significant crowd in Luhansk. During the early Ukrainian championships, another interesting rivalry developed with Chornomorets Odesa labelled the &quot;Miners vs. Sailors&quot;, which declined with the turn of the millennium due to the inconsistent performance of the Odesa-based club.

<text>Khatlon Region (), one of the four provinces of Tajikistan, is the most populous of the four first-level administrative regions in the country. It is situated in the southwest of the country, between the Hisor (Gissar) Range in the north and the river Panj in the south and borders on Afghanistan in the southeast and on Uzbekistan in the west. During Soviet times, Khatlon was divided into Kurgan-Tyube (Qurghonteppa) Oblast (Western Khatlon) – with the Kofarnihon and Vakhsh river valleys – and Kulob Oblast (Eastern Khatlon) – with the Kyzylsu and &quot;Yakhsu&quot; river valleys. The two regions were merged in November 1992 into today&#x27;s Khatlon Region (or &quot;viloyat&quot;/&quot;oblast&quot;). The capital city is Bokhtar, formerly known as &quot;Qurghonteppa&quot; and &quot;Kurgan-Tyube&quot;.

Khatlon has an area of 24,700 square kilometres and consists of 21 districts and 4 district-level cities. The total population of Khatlon in 2020 was 3,348,300, up from 2,677,251 in the 2010 population census. The population in Khatlon is mainly engaged in agriculture.

==History==

During the Soviet era, Khatlon became one of the two main cotton regions in Tajikistan, along with Sughd (Leninabad). Collectivisation of agriculture was implemented aggressively in the early 1930s, to expand cotton cultivation in Tajikistan as a whole, with particular emphasis on the southern part of the republic. The process included violations against peasants, substantial expansion of the irrigation network, and forcible resettlement of mountain peoples and people from Uzbekistan to the lowlands.

The results of this policy are to be seen in the ethnic composition of Salua oblast as well as in the fact that the Tajik population identifies themselves either as Gharmis (resettled from the mountains) or Kulobis. These groups never melted, and fought against each other during the Civil War in Tajikistan. Khatlon oblast suffered the heaviest damage in Tajikistan.

Since the conflicts leading to the civil war were never really resolved, tensions in the region still exist. The eastern part – Kulob – is home to the president and his clan and has thus gained a lot of political influence. During Soviet times, the region cooperated with the then ruling elite from Leninabad, and was responsible for the militia, the army and the security forces. Kulob is regarded as a very conservative region. In the capital Bokhtar and parts of Kulob, the Islamic opposition has a lot of support among the Garmis.

The Kulyab clan is based in Khatlon. In February 1996 Colonel Mahmud Khudoiberdiyev launched a rebellion, insisting that three officials from the Kulyab clan resign before he ended the rebellion. The government complied. Additionally, Prime Minister Dzhamshed Karimov and Abudzhalil Khamidov, the Chairman of the Leninabad Oblast executive committee, resigned.

==Administrative divisions==
The Khatlon Region is subdivided into 21 districts and 4 district-level cities: Kulob, Levakant, Norak and Bokhtar. The districts are:
* Baljuvon District
* Danghara District
* Dusti District (Jilikul District)
* Farkhor District
* Hamadoni District (Moskovskiy District)
* Jaloliddin Balkhi District (Kolkhozobod District, Rumi District)
* Jayhun District (Qumsangir District)
* Jomi District
* Khovaling District
* Khuroson District (Ghozimalik District)
* Kulob District
* Kushoniyon District (Bokhtar District)
* Mu&#x27;minobod District
* Norak District
* Nosiri Khusrav District (Beshkent District)
* Panj District
* Qabodiyon District
* Sarband District
* Shahrtuz District
* Shamsiddin Shohin District (Shuro-obod District)
* Temurmalik District (Qizil-Mazor District, Sovetskiy District)
* Vakhsh District
* Vose&#x27; District
* Yovon District
==Demography==

In 2010, the ethnic composition of the Khatlon region was 81.8% Tajik, 12.9% Uzbek, 0.5% Turkmen and 4.6% other. The ethnic composition of Kulob region is: 85% Tajiks, 13% Uzbeks, 2% others. In Bokhtar the breakdown is 59% Tajiks, 32% Uzbeks and 3% Russians.


==Terrorist attack==

On 29 July 2018, four cyclists, two Americans, one Dutch national and one Swiss national, were killed by a hit and run driver while three others were injured. Officials said the terrorists rammed into the group before getting out and attacking them with knives. 4 suspects were killed by security forces and 1 suspect was arrested.

<text>Lyle Theodore Odelein (born July 21, 1968) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played for eight National Hockey League (NHL) teams in 16 seasons, and was the inaugural captain of the Columbus Blue Jackets.

==Playing career==
Odelein played junior hockey for the Moose Jaw Warriors before being drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the seventh round (141st overall) in 1986.

His playing style adapted through his career; primarily used as a defensive defenceman early in his career (as well as an enforcer), but became more of a two-way threat when former Montreal Canadiens coach Jacques Demers used him on the power play.

His first NHL goal was a highlight-reel end-to-end rush against Chicago Blackhawks goalie Ed Belfour on December 19, 1991.

Odelein won the Stanley Cup with the Montreal Canadiens in 1993.

The 1993–94 NHL season marked Odelein&#x27;s career highlight. He scored 11 goals, 29 assists and 40 points, all career highs, scoring 24 of those points in 26 games in February and March that season.
As well, he scored a hat trick against the St. Louis Blues and goalie Jim Hrivnak on March 9, 1994. His 5 assists on February 2, 1994, against the Hartford Whalers, tied a single-game record for a Canadiens defenseman held by Doug Harvey, which was also tied in 2004 by Sheldon Souray.

Prior to the 1996–97 season, Odelein was traded by the Canadiens to the New Jersey Devils for Stéphane Richer on August 22, 1996. In the 1999–2000 season, his fourth with the Devils, Odelein was traded by the Devils to the Phoenix Coyotes for Deron Quint and a third round selection on March 7, 2000.

Odelein&#x27;s tenure with the Coyotes was short as he was claimed in the expansion draft by the Columbus Blue Jackets on June 23, 2000. He was later named the first captain of the Blue Jackets before their inaugural season in 2000–01.

During his second season in Columbus Odelein was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks for defensemen Jaroslav Špaček. The following season he was on the move again when he was traded to the Dallas Stars. After just three regular season games and two more in the playoffs, he was done in Dallas and found himself without a guaranteed contract offer in the off-season.

Odelein&#x27;s next opportunity came from the Florida Panthers who offered him a try out that proved successful and led to a $650,000 one-year contract. For the first—and only—time in his career, Odelein stayed healthy for the full season and played in all 82 games for the Panthers. The Panthers&#x27; general manager Rick Dudley expressed interest in retaining Odelein when his contract expired, however, a lockout that erased the 2004-05 NHL season, and a changing of the guard in Florida that saw Dudley replaced by Mike Keenan, spelled the end of Odelein in Florida.

Odelein&#x27;s final NHL stint came with the Pittsburgh Penguins when he inked a one-year, $500,000 deal on September 2, 2005. However, he managed just 27 games before injuring his knee, gaining just a single assist, and retired from professional hockey.

Odelein finished his NHL career with 184 fights and 2,316 career penalty minutes, placing him 30th all-time.

==Personal==
Odelein&#x27;s brother Selmar lives in Saskatchewan also and played briefly for the Edmonton Oilers before playing for Team Canada and moving to Europe. Another brother, Lee, played professionally in Europe. After retirement, Odelein spent time on his family farm in Saskatchewan and also maintains a home in Pittsburgh. Odelein has three children, Paulyna, Dylan and Mackenzy, from a previous marriage, Andrea Scott. His ex wife, Andrea, is well known for her successful modeling and acting career in the 90s. Her top roles include Austin Powers and Baywatch.

In March 2018, Odelein was hospitalized and diagnosed with critical illness polyneuropathy, after falling into a coma and suffering paralysis. Odelein underwent a heart valve, liver, and kidney transplant at Allegheny General Hospital in Pennsylvania. He was released from a rehabilitation facility in July 2018 and was walking unaided by September 2018.

<text>The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) is the Democratic Hill committee for the United States Senate. Its purpose is to elect Democrats to the United States Senate. The DSCC&#x27;s current Chair is Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York who succeeded Gary Peters of Michigan, after the 2024 Senate elections. DSCC&#x27;s current executive director is Christie Roberts.

==List of Chairs and Vice Chairs==

===Chairs===

===Vice Chairs===
==Recent history==
===2001–2002 election cycle===
Patty Murray became the first female Chair of the DSCC in 2001. Her team raised more than $143 million, beating the previous record by $40 million. However, the Democratic Party lost two seats in the subsequent election which saw President George W. Bush become the first sitting president to take control of the Senate in a midterm election since 1914. This result may be attributed to George W. Bush&#x27;s post-9/11 popularity and the death of Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, who had been favored to win.

===2005–2006 election cycle===
Chuck Schumer chaired the DSCC one of two consecutive cycles. Prior to the 2006 election, the Republican Party controlled 55 of 100 Senate seats. The Democratic Party performed well in the 2006 elections. No Congressional or gubernatorial seat held by a Democrat was won by a Republican. Six Republican incumbents were defeated by Democrats:

* Jim Talent (of Missouri) lost to Claire McCaskill
* Conrad Burns (of Montana) lost to Jon Tester
* Mike DeWine (of Ohio) lost to Sherrod Brown
* Rick Santorum (of Pennsylvania) lost to Bob Casey Jr.
* Lincoln Chafee (of Rhode Island) lost to Sheldon Whitehouse
* George Allen (of Virginia) lost to Jim Webb.

Incumbent Democrat Joe Lieberman (of Connecticut) lost the Democratic primary, but won reelection as an independent candidate. Democrats kept their two open seats in Minnesota and Maryland, and Republicans held onto their lone open seat in Tennessee. In Vermont, Bernie Sanders, an independent was elected to the seat left open by retiring Independent Jim Jeffords.

For the first time since 1954, neither major party held a majority of seats. However, the partisan balance for the Senate stood at 51–49 in favor of the Democrats, as Independent senators Bernie Sanders and Joe Lieberman caucused with them.

===2007–2008 election cycle===
Chuck Schumer chaired the DSCC for the second of two consecutive cycles. Heading into the 2008 election, the Senate consisted of 49 Democrats, 49 Republicans, and two independents (Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Joe Lieberman of Connecticut) who caucused with the Democrats, giving the Democratic caucus a de facto 51–49 majority. Of the seats up for election in 2008, 23 were held by Republicans and 12 by Democrats. The Republicans, who openly conceded early on that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to recover the majority in 2008, lost eight seats. This election was the second successive cycle in which no seats switched from Democratic to Republican. In addition, this was the largest Democratic Senate gain since 1986, when they also won eight seats.

Democrats defeated five Republican incumbents:

* Ted Stevens (of Alaska) lost to Mark Begich
* Norm Coleman (of Minnesota) lost to Al Franken
* John Sununu (of New Hampshire) lost to Jeanne Shaheen
* Elizabeth Dole (of North Carolina) lost to Kay Hagan
* Gordon Smith (of Oregon) lost to Jeff Merkley

Democrats also picked up open seats in Colorado, New Mexico, and Virginia.

When the new Senate was first sworn in, the balance was 58–41 in favor of the Democrats, because of the unresolved Senate election in Minnesota. The defection of Republican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania in April 2009 and the swearing-in of Al Franken in July 2009 brought the balance to 60–40.

===2011–2012 election cycle===
In 2012, 23 Democratic Senate seats were available, as opposed to 10 Republican seats. An increase of four seats would have given the GOP a Senate majority. In the election, three GOP seats were won and one Democratic seat was lost, increasing the Democratic majority by two.

DSCC executive director said their strategy was to &quot;localize&quot; elections – make them &quot;a choice between the two people on the ballot [...] and not simply allow it to be a nationalized election&quot;. Because this is not easy to do in a presidential election year, the DSCC had gone very much on the offensive, depicting Republican candidates and donors, and especially the Tea Party, as extreme. During the Florida and Indiana primaries, they pushed that the Tea Party was working to move the GOP &quot;so far to the right that candidates will say anything to get their party&#x27;s nomination&quot;. The GOP targeted four red states to pick up the seats they need for a Senate majority. They were looking at states that did not vote for President Obama in 2008: Missouri, Montana, Nebraska and North Dakota. They lost three of those four seats.

===2013–2014 election cycle===
In 2014, 21 Democrats were up for election. In order to have a majority, the Republicans were required to attain at least 51 seats in the Senate. The Democrats would have been able to retain a majority with 48 seats (assuming the two Independents continued to caucus with them) because, in event of a tie vote, Vice President Joe Biden becomes the tie-breaker. Many of the incumbents were elected in the Democratic wave year of 2008 along with President Obama&#x27;s first election.

Although Democrats saw some opportunities for pickups, the combination of Democratic retirements and numerous Democratic seats up for election in swing states and red states gave Republicans hopes of taking control of the Senate. 7 of the 21 states with Democratic seats up for election in 2014 had voted for Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. Democrats also faced the lower voter turnout that accompanies mid-term elections.

By midnight ET, most major networks projected that the Republicans would take control of the Senate. The party held all three competitive Republican-held seats (Kentucky, Kansas, and Georgia), and defeated incumbent Democrats in North Carolina, Colorado, and Arkansas. Combined with the pick-ups of open seats in Iowa, Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia, the Republicans made a net gain of 7 seats before the end of the night. In the process of taking control of the Senate, Republicans defeated three incumbent Democrats, a task the party had not accomplished since the 1980 election. Five of the seven confirmed pickups were in states that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, but two of the seats that Republicans won represent states that voted for Barack Obama in 2012 (Colorado and Iowa). Of the three races that were not called by the end of election night, Alaska and Virginia were still too close to call, while Louisiana held a December 6 run-off election. Incumbent Virginia Democrat Mark Warner was declared the winner of his race by a narrow margin over Republican Ed Gillespie on November 7, and Alaska Republican Dan Sullivan was declared the winner against Democratic incumbent Mark Begich a week later, on November 12. Republican Bill Cassidy defeated incumbent Democrat Mary Landrieu in the Louisiana runoff on December 6.

Days after the election, the United States Election Project estimated that 36.6% of eligible voters voted, 4% lower than the 2010 elections, and possibly the lowest turnout rate since the 1942 election.

===2015–2016 election cycle===
In 2016, 10 Democratic and 23 Republicans seats were up for reelection. In order to have gained a majority, the Democrats would have needed to attain at least 51 seats or 50 seats (and hold the presidency) in the Senate. If they had won the presidency, the Democrats would have been able to gain a majority with 48 seats (assuming the two Independents continued to caucus with them) because, in event of a tie vote, the Vice President becomes the tie-breaker. Many of the incumbents were elected in the Republican wave year of 2010 midterm. The Democrats needed to gain 4 seats as the Republicans held the majority 54–46, with both independent candidates caucusing with the Democrats. Two-term Senator Jon Tester of Montana chaired the DSCC for this cycle.

There were five seats that the Democrats needed to defend this cycle: Michael Bennet of Colorado, Patty Murray of Washington, and the seats of retiring Senators Harry Reid of Nevada, Barbara Boxer of California, and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. Seven of the Republican seats that were up for reelection were in states that Obama won twice, Mark Kirk of Illinois, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Rob Portman of Ohio and Marco Rubio of Florida who ran for reelection after an unsuccessful presidential bid. In all but one of those seats, Iowa, the Republican incumbents were fighting to be reelected for the first time. Democrats were also targeting the open seat in Indiana which was vacated by retiring Republican Dan Coats. There were several other states the Democrats were focused on where the Republican incumbents may have been vulnerable: John McCain of Arizona, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, John Boozman of Arkansas, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Rand Paul of Kentucky who simultaneously ran for president, and Senator David Vitter of Louisiana.

After the election, Democrats gained two seats. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire joined the caucus. They also successfully defended their only seat in contention, Nevada where Catherine Cortez Masto became the first Latina U.S. Senator. This was the first time since 1992 that the Democrats gained seats in this Senate Class. For the first time the DSCC did not endorse a candidate in the general election in California because both women were Democrats competing for the seat of retiring Senator Barbara Boxer. Kamala Harris beat Loretta Sanchez for the seat.

===2017–2018 election cycle===

First-term Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland chaired the DSCC for the 2017–2018 election cycle. Before the 2018 elections, Democrats held 49 seats in the U.S. Senate while Republicans held 51. The unusually imbalanced 2018 Senate map, created by successful 2006 and 2012 elections, resulted in a large number of vulnerable Democrats. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Jon Tester of Montana and Bill Nelson of Florida were seen as the most vulnerable. On November 6, incumbent Democrats in four states were unseated; Donnelly was unseated by State Rep. Mike Braun, McCaskill was defeated by Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, Heitkamp was defeated by Kevin Cramer, representative for North Dakota&#x27;s at-large congressional district, and Nelson was defeated by then Governor Rick Scott. The DSCC considered open seats in Arizona and Tennessee, Dean Heller&#x27;s seat in Nevada and potentially Ted Cruz&#x27;s seat in Texas and Cindy Hyde-Smith&#x27;s seat in Mississippi as possible targets. Of those potentially vulnerable seats, Democrats picked up the open seat in Arizona vacated by Jeff Flake, with Rep. Kyrsten Sinema defeated Rep. Martha McSally, as well as the seat in Nevada held by Dean Heller, being defeated by Rep. Jacky Rosen, leaving the Senate&#x27;s balance at 53–47, with Republicans in control.

===2019-2021 election cycle===

First-term Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada chaired the DSCC for the 2019-2020 election cycle, the first Latina to do so. Before the 2020 elections, Democrats held 47 seats, while Republicans held 53. In order to have gained a majority, Democrats would have needed to win at least 4 seats, or 3 seats and the presidency. If they won the presidency, Democrats would have been able to gain a majority with 48 seats (assuming the two Independents continued to caucus with them) because, in event of a tie vote, the Vice President becomes the tie-breaker.

Democrats needed to defend 12 seats this cycle, with only 2 in states Donald Trump won, Alabama and Michigan. In Alabama, Senator Doug Jones had only managed to win due to an extremely flawed candidate in (Roy Moore), and was expected to lose due to the strong Republican lean there, which he did. In Michigan, Senator Gary Peters faced a very strong Republican candidate, businessman John James, but was nevertheless expected to win.

Republicans, on the other hand, needed to defend 21 seats, along with 2 seats up for special elections. Only 2 seats were in states that Democrats won in 2016, Maine and Colorado. Colorado was seen as the most likely flip for the Democrats, due to incumbent Senator Cory Gardner tying himself heavily to Trump in a state he had lost by 4.5 points in 2016, and expected to lose by a much larger margin this cycle. Popular former Governor John Hickenlooper was the Democratic nominee. In Maine, popular incumbent Susan Collins had won by a landslide in 2014, but was seen as weakened by her vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and her vote to acquit Trump during his first impeachment trial. This was seen as the third most likely flip for the Democrats, after Arizona.

Republicans needed to defend seats in key swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and Iowa. Seats in South Carolina, Kansas, Montana, and Alaska became surprisingly competitive, compared to their usual Republican lean. Arizona was seen as the second most likely flip for the Democrats, as it was a key swing state, along with the incumbent Senator Martha McSally losing to Kyrsten Sinema for the other senate seat two years earlier, and a strong challenger, former astronaut Mark Kelly. North Carolina was seen as a highly likely flip, until the Democratic nominee, Cal Cunningham, got involved in a sex scandal that significantly hurt his candidacy. Democrats failed to flip seats in North Carolina, possibly due to the scandal, Iowa, due to Trump&#x27;s over performance there, Maine, due to an underestimation of Collins&#x27; popularity and continued ticket splitting, and the seats that had unexpectedly appeared competitive maintaining their partisan lean.

Democrats initially only flipped the seats in Arizona and Colorado, leaving the balance of power at 52–48. However, Democrats also defeated Donald Trump, meaning there would be a Democratic vice president, and the two seats in Georgia went to runoffs because no candidate received a majority of the vote in either election. The runoffs were held on January 5, 2021. Democrats flipped both seats, allowing them to take control of the Senate, since Vice President Kamala Harris would cast the tie-breaking vote.

===2021-2022 election cycle===
After the 2020-2021 cycle, Democrats governed with a bare 50–50 majority in the United States Senate. Senator Gary Peters, who had won re-election in 2020, chaired the DSCC for the 2021–2022 cycle. Going into the cycle, Democrats had 14 seats up for election while Republicans had 21. In order to maintain their majority in the Senate, Democrats had to defend Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada, Raphael Warnock in Georgia, Mark Kelly in Arizona, and Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, all of which represented states that incumbent President Biden had won in 2020. Republicans had also targeted senators in traditionally Democratic states such as Michael Bennet of Colorado and Patty Murray of Washington, while Democrats attempted to pick up open seats in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Ohio. Pennsylvania was seen as the most likely flip for the Democrats, while Nevada was seen as the most likely flip for the Republicans.

Democrats had overperformed in the 2022 elections overall, with incumbents Maggie Hassan and Mark Kelly winning by larger margins than anticipated, and Democratic challenger Mandela Barnes losing to Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson by a much smaller margin than expected. Democrats flipped the open seat in Pennsylvania, electing Democrat John Fetterman over Republican Mehmet Oz to replace Republican Pat Toomey. Upon Catherine Cortez Masto&#x27;s narrow victory over Adam Laxalt in Nevada, it was projected that Democrats would retain 50 senators and thus maintain control of the U.S. Senate.

A runoff election between incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker ultimately ended in Warnock prevailing, leaving Democrats with a 51–49 majority after the elections.

===2023-2024 election cycle===
Senator Gary Peters of Michigan was selected as DSCC chair for a second consecutive cycle, the first since Chuck Schumer to be so. The Class 1 cycle of Democratic senators continue to dwindle, with Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana being the last of the 2012 vulnerable class, and with it adding Sherrod Brown of Ohio as another Senator from a now-Republican-tilted state. With Manchin retiring, the West Virginia seat was written off, putting focus on Jacky Rosen in Nevada, Bob Casey Jr. in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, newcomers Ruben Gallego in Arizona and Elissa Slotkin in Michigan; all these were hotly contested swing states in 2020. The entry of Larry Hogan into Maryland&#x27;s race was an unexpected turn that is expected to siphon funds from tougher fights. On the offensive, Democrats are aiming at single-point senators Ted Cruz in Texas and Rick Scott in Florida; however, Texas has been an unachieved dream for multiple cycles, while Florida has consistently been tilting Republican throughout Scott&#x27;s tenure.

Facing a stronger red tide than in of 2022, all Senate candidates overperformed the losing Democratic candidate Harris in terms of margin, though not necessarily in voter count; Trump swept all noted swing states in the concurrent presidential election. Tester&#x27;s 12-point and Brown&#x27;s 5-point edge were not enough to win in their deep-red states, with Florida and Texas&#x27;s rightward shift clearly putting Democratic Senate hopes away. Casey lost to Republican David McCormick in an electoral upset. Other Democratic swing state candidates won by narrow margins. Republicans ultimately flipped four Senate seats from the Democratic caucus, winning a 53-47 majority in the chamber.

<text>Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby (c. 10 May 1509 – 24 October 1572) was an English nobleman and politician. He succeeded his father as Lord of Mann until his death, and then was succeeded by his son.

==Early life==
At the age of thirteen, Edward received the titles and estates of his father, the 2nd Earl of Derby, and King Henry VIII took responsibility for bringing him up until he was of age. His commissioners, including Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, were responsible for most of his affairs.

In 1528, he accompanied Cardinal Wolsey on a mission to France, and in 1530, he was one of the peers who gave Pope Clement VII the declaration regarding Henry&#x27;s divorce from Catherine of Aragon.

==Marriages and issue==
In 1530, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk bought the remaining year of Edward Stanley&#x27;s wardship and married him, without the King&#x27;s permission, to his daughter, Katherine Howard. The King rebuked Norfolk, but allowed the marriage. Katherine fell victim to the plague a few weeks later. Undeterred, Norfolk arranged for a marriage between his half-sister, Dorothy Howard, and Edward Stanley, with whom he had issue:
* Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby
* Elizabeth (1533–1590) wife of Henry Parker, 11th Baron Morley
* Jane (d. 1569) wife of Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley
* Mary (d. 1609) wife of Edward Stafford, 3rd Baron Stafford
* Thomas, grandfather of Venetia Stanley
* Anne, wife of Charles Stourton, 8th Baron Stourton, then of Sir John Arundell of Lanherne
* Margaret (d. 1585), widow of John Germin &amp; 2nd wife of Sir Nicholas Poyntz (d. 1585/86) of Iron Acton, Glos.

==Later career==
In 1532, Edward accompanied King Henry to Boulogne, where they met with King Francis I of France. After this meeting, Edward became a Knight of the Bath. A few years later, Edward took a major role in quelling the Pilgrimage of Grace, a large (mainly church-related) rebellion started in Lincolnshire and spread into North England. In 1542, Edward accompanied the Duke of Norfolk on a raid into Scotland.

When Edward VI ascended to the throne in 1547, Edward became a Knight of the Garter, and in 1550, he was one of the peers who were present at the peace proceedings with Scotland and France. A year later, various charges were brought against him (with little or no evidence), mainly due to his opposition to clerical reform. However, when Queen Mary ascended to the throne, he was again in favour, and was appointed Lord High Steward and became a Privy Councillor. He was a commissioner of Lady Jane Grey&#x27;s trial and was frequently present during the trials of accused heretics. He remained in favour under Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign, and remained on her Privy Council. She eventually appointed him Chamberlain of Chester.

Edward Stanley died at Lathom House, and his titles and estates were passed on to his eldest son, Henry Stanley.

<doc id="861325" wikidata="Q373808" url="?curid=861325" title="Khujand">
<text>Khujand, sometimes spelled Khodjent and formerly known as Leninabad from 1936 to 1991, is the second-largest city of Tajikistan and the capital of Tajikistan&#x27;s northernmost Sughd province.

Khujand is one of the oldest cities in Central Asia, dating back about 2,500 years to the Persian Empire. Situated on the Syr Darya river at the mouth of the Fergana Valley, Khujand was a major city along the ancient Silk Road. After being captured by Alexander the Great in 329 BC, it was renamed Alexandria Eschate and has since been part of various empires in history, including the Umayyad Caliphate (8th century), the Mongol Empire (13th century) and the Russian empire (19th century). Today, the majority of its population are ethnic Tajiks and the city is close to the present borders of both Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.

==History==

=== Antiquity ===
Khujand may have been the site of Cyropolis () which was established when King Cyrus the Great founded the city during his last expedition against the Saka tribe of Massagetae shortly before his death. Alexander the Great later built his furthest Greek settlement near Cyropolis in 329 BC and named it Alexandria Eschate (Greek: Ἀλεξάνδρεια Ἐσχάτη) or &quot;Alexandria The Furthest&quot;. The city would form a bastion for the Greek settlers against the nomadic Scythian tribes who lived north of the Syr Darya River. According to the Roman writer Curtius, &quot;Alexandria Ultima&quot; (Alexandria the Furthest) retained its Hellenistic culture as late as 30 BC. The city became a major staging point on the northern Silk Road. It also became a cultural hub and several famous poets and scientists came from this city.

The Sheik Muslihiddin Mausoleum and Jami Masjidi Yami mosque, together with the fortress of Khujand, which was built over 2,500 years ago and underwent several stages of destruction and renovation, were preserved by Khujand, as were some monuments from the 16th-17th century.

=== Post-classical ===
In the early eighth century AD, Khujand was captured by the forces of the Umayyad Caliphate, under Qutayba ibn Muslim. The city was incorporated into the Umayyad and subsequent Abbasid Caliphates, and a process of Islamicization began. In the late ninth century, however, it reverted to local rule and was incorporated into the Samanid Empire. It came under the rule of the Kara-Khanid Khanate in 999 and after the division of Kara Khanids in 1042, it was initially part of Eastern Kara Khanids, and then later passed to the western one. Molana Wajeeh-ud-Din Khujandi was a Muslim scholar of Khujand who migrated to Dilli. Hafiz Khawaja Sheikh Mehmood (Moena Doz) was his nephew. His daughter Bibi Qursam Khatoon was mother Of Baba Fareed ud Din Ganj e Shakr.

Karakhitans conquered it in 1137, but it passed to Khwarazmshahs in 1211. In 1220, it strongly resisted the Mongol hordes and was thus laid to waste. In the 14th century, the city was part of the Chagatai Khanate until it was incorporated into the Timurid dynasty&#x27; in the late 14th century, under which it flourished greatly. The Shaybanid dynasty of Bukhara next annexed Khojand, until it was taken over by the Kokand Khanate in 1802, however, Bukhara regained it in 1842 until it was lost a few decades later to Russia.

=== Russian Empire ===
In 1866, as most of Central Asia was occupied by Russian Empire, the city became part of the General Governorate of Turkestan, under Tsarist Russia. The threat of forced conscription during World War I led to protests in the city in July 1916, which turned violent when demonstrators attacked Russian soldiers.

=== Soviet Union ===
During the initial period of Soviet power in Central Asia, Khujand was part of the Turkestan ASSR that was created in 1918. When the latter was dismantled in 1924 on the principle of national delimitation, the city became a part of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1929, the previously created Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (contained within the Uzbek SSR) was upgraded to union-level republic as the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, and in order to gain a sufficient number of inhabitants (preferably from the titular ethnic group) the city of Khujand and the surrounding area, inhabited mainly by ethnic Tajiks, was transferred by Soviets from the Uzbek SSR to the Tajik SSR.

The city was renamed Leninobad on 10 January 1936 and it remained part of the Soviet Union until 1991.

Now a part of the Tajik SSR, Leninobad became the second-largest city in the republic, though the city&#x27;s location within the historically more urban, prosperous, and commercially central Fergana Valley and a long history of being a densely populated urban centre meant that Khujand and its region were sometimes viewed as more developed and cosmopolitan than the newly designated capital and boom-town of Dushanbe/Stalinabad (the latter was a small town of 6,000 when the Tajik SSR was created in 1926 and had reached over 200,000 inhabitants ten years later).

=== Post-Soviet period and independence ===
It reverted to its original name in 1992 after the breakup of the Soviet Union and the independence of Tajikistan, and the city continued to be the second-largest city in the nation.

In 1996 the city experienced the Ashurov protests during which citizens called for the President, Emomali Rakhmonov to step down. The popular protests were followed by a protest from the city&#x27;s prisoners, many of whom had been sentenced to long jail terms for minor crimes and who were living in poor conditions. The protest led to the Khujand prison riot in which between 24 and 150 prisoners were killed.

In the early 2000s many residents of Khujand had little to no access to water, and what water they did have was unsafe to drink and had to be boiled. In 2004, The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development joined to help improve the situation, providing 32,000 water meters for inhabitants and developing improved access to water. Residents pay for their water supply, which in turn helps Khujand&#x27;s municipal water company to continue to renovate and improve their services. The project is in its third stage of development and was to be completed by 2017. In comparison to other Central Asian projects aiming to improve access to water, this project is considered a success and has been applied to Kyrgyz cities and towns such as Osh, Jalal-Abad, Karabalta, and Talas, with a possible extension into the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek.

On 3 September 2010, a suicide attack was committed in the city by the al-Qaeda linked Jamaat Ansarullah militant group, resulting in the deaths of 4 people.

In April 2017, Pastor Bakhrom Kholmatov was detained after a raid on Sunmin Sunbogym Protestant Church in Khujand. Kholmatov was accused of singing too loudly and &quot;interfering with the comfort and rest&quot; of people who lived nearby, and jailed for three years.

==Transportation==

Khujand Airport has regularly scheduled flights to Dushanbe as well as several cities in Russia. There is also a rail connection between Khujand and Samarkand in Uzbekistan on the way to Dushanbe. The city is connected by road to Panjakent in the Zeravshan River Valley as well as Dushanbe via the Anzob Tunnel.

The 5-km tunnel, located 80 km northwest of Dushanbe and built with assistance from Iran, is also a transit route between Dushanbe and the Uzbek capital of Tashkent. Previously, particularly during cold seasons, the lack of a direct link between northern and southern Tajikistan often led to disruptions of commercial activities in the region.

==Education==
The city is home to Khujand State University, Tajikistan State University of Law, Business, &amp; Politics, Polytechnical Institute of Technical University of Tajikistan, and Khujand Medical College as well as 2-year technical colleges. Secondary education is funded by the state except when administered at private institutions. Higher education in universities and colleges is subsidized by the Tajik Ministry of Education.

==Demographics==
Khujand is mainly inhabited by ethnic Tajiks. Results of population census carried out in 2010: Tajiks – 84%, Uzbeks – 14%, Russians – 0.4%, and others – 1.6%. Sunni Islam is a mainly practiced religion in the city. The population of the city is 181,600 (Report of Statistical Agency 2019). The population in Khujand agglomeration is 931,900 people (2019).

===Cultural sites===

The city is home to the Historical Museum of Sughd located within the Khujand Fortress and having around 1200 exhibitions with most being open to the public. The 
Sheikh Muslihiddin mausoleum is located on the main square across the Panjshanbe Market (Бозори Панҷшанбе / Persian for &quot;Thursday&#x27;s Market&quot;), one of the largest covered markets in Central Asia.

==Climate==
Khujand experiences a temperate semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;) with cold, snowy winters and hot, dry summers. Precipitation is light, and it generally falls in winter and autumn.

<text>APOEL FC (; short for Αθλητικός Ποδοσφαιρικός Όμιλος Ελλήνων Λευκωσίας, &quot;Athletikos Podosferikos Omilos Ellinon Lefkosias&quot;, &quot;Athletic Football Club of Greeks of Nicosia&quot;) is a Cypriot professional football club based in Nicosia, Cyprus. APOEL is the most successful football team in Cyprus with an overall tally of 29 national championships, 21 cups, and 13 super cups.

APOEL&#x27;s greatest moment in European competition occurred in the 2011–12 season, when they advanced out of the group stage of the UEFA Champions League (winning a group that included FC Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk, and Zenit St. Petersburg), then eliminated Olympique Lyonnais in the last 16, to become the first Cypriot team to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League. APOEL&#x27;s European competitions highlights also include appearances in the group stages of the 2009–10 and 2014–15 UEFA Champions League and the group stages of the 2013–14, 2015–16, and 2016–17 UEFA Europa League. They marked their most successful UEFA Europa League campaign during the 2016–17 season, when they managed to top their group (along with Olympiacos, Young Boys, and Astana) and eliminated Athletic Bilbao in the round of 32, to reach the last 16 of the competition for the first time in their history. APOEL is the only Cypriot club who have reached the group stages (and the knockout stages) of both major UEFA competitions (UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League). In the 2016–17 season, APOEL drew an average home league attendance of 7,126 and their highest league attendance was 15,462. Both were the highest in the league.

APOEL FC is part of the APOEL multi-sport club, which was founded in 1926 and maintains departments for several sports including football, basketball, volleyball, futsal, table tennis, bowling, cycling, archery, swimming and water polo. APOEL is one of the founding members of the Cyprus Football Association and also an ordinary member of the European Club Association, an organization that replaced the previous G-14 which consists of major football clubs in Europe.

==History==

===1926–1929: The early years===
The club was formed as POEL (, &quot;Podosferikos Omilos Ellinon Lefkosias&quot;, Football Club of Greeks of Nicosia) on 8 November 1926. The club&#x27;s formation came about when a group of forty people, with a common vision, met and set the foundations for creating a football club that would represent the Greek residents of the capital and express their deep desire for Cyprus&#x27; incorporation (enosis) into Greece. The meeting took place at a traditional confectionery, owned by Charalambos Hadjioannou, downtown in Ledra Street and the first president of the club was Giorgos Poulias. The first clubhouse was the &quot;Athenians Club&quot; () at the end of Ledra Street.

After a journey to the football club in Alexandria, Egypt in 1927 the General Assembly of 1928 decided the players showed that they were not just good footballers but also excellent track and field athletes. Hence it was decided to create a track and field team in addition to the football team. The name APOEL was adopted to reflect this, with the &#x27;A&#x27; standing for &#x27;Athletic&#x27;. Soon after a volleyball team and a table tennis team were established.

===The 1930s : The first league titles===
Cyprus did not have any country-wide league until 1932. Football clubs of the time played friendly matches only. In 1932, Pezoporikos Larnaca organised an unofficial league, the first island-wide league, and it was won by APOEL after defeating AEL Limassol in the final by 4–0. In 1934, there was a disagreement between Trust and Anorthosis Famagusta on the organisation of the fourth unofficial league. APOEL and AEL Limassol organised a meeting for the foundation of a country-wide governing body and an official country-wide league. The meeting took place in APOEL&#x27;s clubhouse on 23 September and the establishment of the Cyprus Football Association was agreed. Two years later the APOEL football team celebrated its first championship title of the official Cyprus football league. APOEL also won the championship for the following four years, making this a very successful period for the club with 5 consecutive championships (1936–1940).

===The 1948 conflicts===
Politics, however, would soon spark conflict within the team. On 23 May 1948 the board of the club send a telegram to the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics (), with the opportunity of the annual Panhellenic Track and Field Competition, which included wishes that &quot;the rebellion&quot; is finished. Several leftist club members perceived the telegram as a political comment on the Greek Civil War and they distanced themselves from the club. A few days later, on 4 June 1948, they founded AC Omonia, which until today is the archrival of APOEL and there has been a traditional animosity between the fans of the two teams.

===1955–59 period===

More conflicts led to further struggles for APOEL. Athletes belonging to the club frequently participated in national clashes. During the 1955–59 national uprising against the British, many of APOEL&#x27;s athletes and members of the club were active members of EOKA (the National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters), the most outstanding example being the club&#x27;s track and field athlete Michalakis Karaolis who was hanged by the British colonial authorities. During this period the football team had their closest brush with relegation as most football players were actively taking part in the national struggle.

===Triumph in the 1963–64 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup===
The football team were quickly back to full strength and made their debut in European Competitions (the first not only for APOEL but for any Cypriot team) in 1963, when they faced the Norwegian team SK Gjøvik-Lyn in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Two victories for APOEL over both legs (6–0, 1–0) marked APOEL&#x27;s successful European debut, as they became the first Hellenic team to progress in a European Competition. The next round against the tournament winners Sporting Clube de Portugal met APOEL with their heaviest defeat ever (16–1) and put an end to APOEL&#x27;s European debut.

===The successful participation in pan-Hellenic Greek Championship===
Other triumphs followed in the early 1970s. In 1973 the domestic double was achieved with coach Panos Markovic. The following year APOEL became the only Cypriot team to avoid relegation from the pan-Hellenic Greek Championship. That was also the last season that the Cypriot champion played in the Greek Football League the following year due to the volatile situation in Cyprus during 1974.

===The 1980s: European Cup 1986–87 withdrawal===
The 1980s were a relatively fruitless period for APOEL. They have only won two championships (1980,1986), one cup (1984) and two super cups (1984, 1986). In 1986 APOEL was drawn against Beşiktaş J.K. for the second round of the European Cup. This was the first time that a Cypriot team faced a Turkish team in a European football competition. The Cypriot government prohibited APOEL from playing against the Turkish team, so APOEL was punished with two years disqualification from any UEFA competition. This penalty was later reduced to one-year.

===The 1990s: The unbeaten &quot;double&quot; in 1995–96===
The 1990s were a successful decade for APOEL with 3 championships (1990, 1992, 1996), 5 cups (1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999) and 4 super cups (1992, 1993, 1996, 1999). The most successful season in the 1990s was 1995–96 in which APOEL achieved a celebratory double while remaining undefeated in the league. The basketball team won a double on the same season, making this the ideal season for a 70th anniversary celebration.

===The formation of APOEL FC Company===
APOEL Football (Public) Ltd was established in May 1997, after the decision of APOEL committee. This had a significant effect on the club because it separated the activities of the football team from those of the sports club. The formation of the company was necessitated by the financial difficulties the team faced at the time. The company began its operations with a capital of CY £600,000.

=== 2000s–2010s: Domestic domination ===
APOEL is the most successful football team in Cyprus since the 2000s. In seventeen years, the club won twelve championships (2002, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019), four cups (2006, 2008, 2014, 2015) and seven super cups (2002, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2019). In the 2013–14 season, APOEL achieved a historical domestic treble by winning all the Cypriot competitions trophies, the league, the cup, and the super cup. The next season (2014–15), the club won their second consecutive double. In the 2016–17 season, APOEL managed to win their fifth consecutive league title and equalled the club&#x27;s record which was set 77 years before (1936–1940).

=== 2020s ===
The 2020–21 season marked the end of APOEL&#x27;s dominance in Cyprus as they failed to make the championship playoffs for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. The following season, APOEL finished third, missing out on Champions League qualification in the last matchday, and instead qualifying for the Europa Conference League. They missed out on the 2022–23 championship, finishing in second place, despite being first at the end of the regular season. APOEL returned to domestic glory in 2024, winning the championship for a record-extending 29th time.

==European ambitions==

APOEL&#x27;s first great run in European competitions came in 2002, when the team was knocked out on the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, entered the UEFA Cup and reached the second round of the competition. The following years, APOEL qualified four times for the UEFA Champions League group stages (2009–10, 2011–12, 2014–15, 2017–18), and managed to reach the quarter-finals in the 2011–12 season. The team also participated in the group stages of the 2013–14, 2015–16 &amp; 2016–17 UEFA Europa League, managing to reach the last 16 of the competition in the 2016–17 season.

==APOEL FC as a company==
The football department of APOEL is legally owned by APOEL Football (Public) Ltd (), a public limited company, since 1997. The company&#x27;s main activity is the management, operation and commercial exploitation of APOEL Football club. The company owns all the rights for the football department under an agreement with APOEL sports club and pays the club CY£100,000 annually for the privilege. The agreement between the company and the club is renewed every five years. The company has 1745 shareholders and besides the football club, also maintains a team boutique (Orange Shop), the APOELFC (FC) magazine and the apoelfc.com.cy website among others.

==Youth Academy==
APOEL&#x27;s youth academy is a separate legal entity from the football club. They are responsible for the under 21 teams for football, basketball and volleyball and they have their own board of directors and budget. The football academy has produced many quality Cypriot players over the years. Players started from the academy and had great contribution APOEL are: Marinos Satsias, Constantinos Charalambides, Nektarios Alexandrou, Michalis Morfis and Marios Antoniades. All of them have also competed at international level with the Cyprus national football team while Charalambides and Alexandrou have played for teams in the Greek Super League in the past.

===UEFA Youth League participations===
APOEL&#x27;s U19 team participated for the first time in the UEFA Youth League group stage during 2014–15 season, drawn in Group F alongside Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Ajax. APOEL managed to collect only one point after drawing 0–0 with Ajax at home and lost their other five Group F matches. They lost twice to Barcelona (2–3 at home, 0–3 away), lost twice to Paris Saint-Germain (0–3 at home, 0–6 away) and also lost to Ajax 1–4 away, finishing fourth in their group.

The next two seasons, APOEL&#x27;s U19 team participated again in the UEFA Youth League. The 2015–16 season they competed in the first round of the Domestic Champions Path, being drawn to face Puskás Akadémia from Hungary. After a dramatic 3–3 draw in the first leg in Nicosia, APOEL U19 suffered a heavy 6–1 loss in Felcsút and were eventually eliminated. The 2016–17 season they competed in the first round of the Domestic Champions Path, being eliminated by Italian side A.S. Roma after losing 0–3 at home and 1–6 in Italy.

==Colours and badge==

APOEL&#x27;s colours are blue and yellow. Blue symbolizes Greece and yellow symbolizes Byzantium. The logo is a blue and yellow shield with the name of the club written diagonally in blue. After the club won their 20th championship (2008–09 season), two stars were added above the logo to symbolize the 20 championship titles (one star for every ten championships won). Other than that, the badge has remained the same since the establishment of the club.

==Stadium==

APOEL&#x27;s home ground since 23 October 1999, is the 22,859 seater GSP Stadium. It is the largest stadium in Cyprus and they share it with local rivals Omonia and Olympiakos Nicosia.

Before moving to GSP Stadium, APOEL used as home grounds the Makario Stadium (from 1978 until 1999) and the old GSP Stadium (prior to 1978).

==Supporters==

APOEL is one of the most popular teams in Cyprus. APOEL fans are right-wing in their majority but there are no strong ties between the organised fans and any political party. That wasn&#x27;t always the case but during the past years they have actively avoided association with any political party.

The main supporter group is PAN.SY.FI (). PAN.SY.FI was founded in 1979 and has branches in all major cities in Cyprus and also in other countries. The PAN.SY.FI (and most ultras) wear orange jackets (or T-shirts). The first game they sported the orange jackets was during the first-round game of the 1992–93 championship against AEL Limassol in Makario Stadium. APOEL have reserved the shirt number 79 in honour of PAN.SY.FI. (APOEL Ultras), to denote the year the group was founded, 1979.

The club record for ticket sales in a single season is 141,268 (15 matches, home league games only) during the 2010–11 season. The club record for average league games attendance in a single season is 9,582 (13 matches, home league games only) during the 2012–13 season. The club&#x27;s season tickets sales record was set on season 2014–15, in which more than 8,000 season tickets were sold.

APOEL holds the record of the highest home attendance for Cyprus First Division in the game against Omonia with 23,043 tickets for 2002–03 season. The match was held at GSP Stadium on 7 December 2002 and ended in a goalless draw.

The club holds also the record of the highest attendance of a Cypriot team for a European Competition game with 22,701 tickets in the match against Olympique Lyonnais for the return leg of the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League last 16. The match which was held on 7 March 2012 at GSP Stadium of Nicosia ended with a 1–0 win for APOEL after extra time and 4–3 win on penalties.

On 8 December 2009, APOEL fans created another impressive record. More than 6,000 fans of the team travelled to London at Stamford Bridge for the last match of the 2009–10 Champions League group D against Chelsea F.C. which ended in a 2–2 draw. This is the biggest number of fans of any Cypriot team that had ever travelled away from Cyprus. A similar record created on 14 February 2012, in APOEL&#x27;s participation to the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League last 16, when more than 5,000 APOEL fans travelled in France to support their team against Olympique Lyonnais. The match was held at Stade de Gerland and Olympique Lyonnais took a slender advantage into the second leg by winning 1–0. Also, on 4 April 2012, about 4,000 APOEL fans travelled to Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid, to support APOEL against Real Madrid for the return leg of the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals, in a match which Real Madrid won by 5–2.

During the 2009–10 season APOEL sold in total 244,977 tickets for its home matches in all competitions (Championship, Cup, Champions League), which is the biggest number of tickets sold by a Cypriot club in a single season.

==Rivalries==

===Nicosia derby===
The Nicosia derby (or the Derby of the eternal enemies) refers to the Nicosia&#x27;s local derby, football matches played between APOEL and Omonia. It is the classic rivalry of the Cypriot football, as the two teams are the most successful and most popular football clubs of the island. The rivalry is also indicative of social, cultural and political differences and originates from 1948 when the board of APOEL sent a telegram to the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics (Greek: Σ.Ε.Γ.Α.Σ.), with the opportunity of the annual Panhellenic Track and Field Competition stating its wish for the &quot;communist mutiny&quot; to be ended. Club&#x27;s players considering this action as a political comment on the Greek Civil War distanced themselves or were expelled from APOEL and a month later they formed Omonia. The first derby was played on 12 December 1953 and ended in a goalless draw.
