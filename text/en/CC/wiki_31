<text>Today FM is a commercial FM radio station, owned and operated by Bauer Audio Ireland Limited, which broadcasts throughout Ireland. Broadcasting since 17 March 1997, it broadcasts mostly music, with a daily news and current affairs programme. Today FM holds a licence from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland as far as the year 2027. The station recorded pretax profits of €7.4 million on a turnover of €19.4 million in early 2009, more than twice what it was two years previously.

Today FM broadcasts from studios in Marconi House, Digges Lane, Dublin 2. On 1 June 2021 Bauer Media Audio announced the completion of its acquisition of Communicorp Group in Ireland, including Today FM.

==History==
The first independent national radio franchise holder in Ireland was 100-102 Century Radio, which launched in 1989 and closed down abruptly in November 1991 amid heavy financial losses. The Independent Radio and Television Commission did not re-advertise the contract until 1996.

Radio Ireland Limited, originally owned by John McColgan and Moya Doherty (and because of their involvement, dubbed &quot;Radio Riverdance&quot;), won the contract when it was advertised.

In 2002, Scottish Radio Holdings plc acquired Radio Ireland Limited from its shareholders. In June 2005, an agreed takeover offer for that company was made by Emap. Denis O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Communicorp was the highest bidder for Emap&#x27;s Irish operations when that company decided to sell its radio stations, buying FM104, Highland Radio and Today FM on 14 July 2007. In October 2007, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) approved Communicorp&#x27;s proposed takeover of Today FM and Highland Radio, but not FM104. The deal was completed by January 2008. Due to a Competition Authority decision, Communicorp was required to sell-on FM104, which it did (to UTV Media) immediately upon its acquisition. The takeover closed in April 2008.

In 2008, Today FM moved their studios from their original base at 112 Upper Abbey Street, Dublin, across the Liffey to Marconi House in Digges Lane, Dublin 2, where it shares the building with its Communicorp sister station, Newstalk. The building also housed another Communicorp station, Phantom (later TXFM), until it ceased broadcasting in October 2016. In June 2017 it was announced that the group&#x27;s other Dublin-based stations, 98FM and Spin 1038, would also be moving into the same premises.

The experienced broadcaster and radio programmer Tom Hardy served as the station&#x27;s Director of Programming from 1998 until January 2013, when he was replaced by Martin McGuire. The position was later taken up by the station&#x27;s former evening presenter Colm O&#x27;Sullivan, now of Cork&#x27;s Red FM. Adelle Nolan took over the role in 2016 and it is now held by Phil Manzor, formally of Spin 1038 and Spin South West.

On Tuesday 1 June 2021 Bauer Media Audio announced the completion of its acquisition of Communicorp Group in Ireland, including Today FM.

==Broadcast history==
The station went on air, originally known as Radio Ireland, on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, 17 March 1997. At first, the station was a mixed network, airing much talk programming, including a farming show and various types of music, including traditional Irish, classical music, light opera. However, following six months of disastrous ratings, and with a listenership of just 1%, the station was revamped, and on 1 January 1998 became 100-102 Today FM. The station axed almost all of its programming and changed its music policy entirely. Eamon Dunphy&#x27;s co-host (Anne-Marie Hourihan) was axed, with Dunphy being heavily promoted as a solo act and Ian Dempsey and Ray D&#x27;Arcy were poached from arch-rivals RTÉ. The IRTC went along with the schedule changes, though in a statement soon after the relaunch said it was not entirely satisfied with the new schedule. However, within three months, the station&#x27;s listenership had almost doubled.

Today FM reshuffled its daytime schedule in 2004, reducing &quot;The Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show&quot; to add an extra hour to &quot;The Ray D&#x27;Arcy Show&quot; so that it could compete directly with rival, &quot;The Gerry Ryan Show&quot;. Philip Cawley&#x27;s afternoon show was reduced and Tony Fenton was given a lunchtime show.

In April 2006, Ray D&#x27;Arcy conducted an interview with comedian Des Bishop. Bishop joked about being gay. D&#x27;Arcy asked Bishop to provide an &quot;exclusive&quot;. Bishop said, &quot;I&#x27;m gay... I&#x27;m not, but hey!&quot; D&#x27;Arcy said, &quot;You&#x27;re very comfortable with your sexuality?&quot; Bishop said, &quot;Me and Derek Mooney are doing a show&quot;. The audience laughed. D&#x27;Arcy moved to a commercial break before, he said, Bishop &quot;outs anyone else&quot;. The incident provoked much commentary in the media, with the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; observing &quot;Instantly, the Irish-American comedian was the villain of the piece and Derek was all over the front page&quot;, while Ray D&#x27;Arcy was also criticised for his choice of words.

On 29 February 2008, Matt Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Last Word&quot; was the final show to be presented from the old studios. The first show to be presented from the new Digges Lane studio was &quot;Friday Night 80s&quot; with Phil Cawley from 19:00. The first song played was &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

On 15 October 2011, Today FM confirmed Sam Smyth&#x27;s Sunday radio show was being dropped. He had been presenting it for 14 years. Smyth had previously offended his bosses by commenting in a newspaper and on television about the Moriarty Tribunal, which criticised Today FM owner Denis O&#x27;Brien. Smyth said on air the next morning that he had been told not to talk about the end of his show and stopped one of his guests from talking about it too &quot;before someone comes downstairs and pulls a wire we better move onto something else.&quot; The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said it was concerned at the development. The &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, of which Denis O&#x27;Brien is a leading shareholder, reported that Anton Savage was being lined up to replace Sam Smyth. Eamon Dunphy subsequently resigned from Today FM&#x27;s sister station Newstalk, in solidarity with Smyth and because, he said, the radio station&#x27;s management wanted &quot;dissenting voices&quot; such as Constantin Gurdgiev off the airwaves.

Ray D&#x27;Arcy hosted the weekday mid-morning slot for 15 years but abruptly left Today FM to rejoin RTÉ with immediate effect in December 2014. Alison Curtis served as an interim host until the appointment of Anton Savage who began his show, &quot;The Anton Savage Show&quot; on 26 January 2015, which now airs every Monday to Friday from 9 am to midday. Savage&#x27;s previous Sunday morning show, &quot;Savage Show&quot; which aired every Sunday from 11 am to 1 pm ended and the slot was taken over by comedian Neil Delamere who now presents his own show titled &quot;Neil Delamere&#x27;s Sunday Best&quot; which airs every Sunday from 11 am to 1 pm.

On 17 August 2015, Colm O&#x27;Sullivan announced that his show &quot;The Mix-Up&quot; which had aired every Monday-Thursday 7-9 pm was ending after three years of being on-air and that O&#x27;Sullivan himself was retiring from the DJ business after nearly twenty years to take up a position as the new Programme Director of Today FM, O&#x27;Sullivan having joined Today FM in February 2013 with his show, &quot;The Mix-Up&quot; airing for the first time on Monday 4 February 2013.

Anton Savage left the radio station on 2 December 2016, due to a disagreement with the radio station, and was replaced by Dermot Whelan and Dave Moore. On 25 January 2017, comedian Al Porter was announced, live on air, as the new host of the midday show, moving into Whelan and Moore&#x27;s old slot. On 13 February 2017, Porter&#x27;s show aired for the first time. However, in November 2017, after allegations of sexual misconduct made against Porter, he decided to resign from Today FM with immediate effect.

On 30 October 2024, Ed Smith announced he was leaving the station, after 25 years.

<doc id="853123" wikidata="Q648062" url="?curid=853123" title="Aztek (character)">
<text>Aztek is the name of two superheroes appearing in DC Comics. Both versions are based out of the fictional Vanity City, and are champions of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl. The first Aztek first appeared in &quot;Aztek, The Ultimate Man #1&quot; in August 1996, and was created by Grant Morrison, Mark Millar, and N. Steven Harris. Following the short run series, Aztek appeared in several issues of &quot;JLA&quot; also written by Morrison. The second Aztek, this one being a female version, appeared in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; vol. 5 #20 in December 2017, created by Steve Orlando and Ivan Reis, as the rival and later partner of the Ray.

==Fictional character biography==
===Uno===
Uno is raised from childhood by a secret organization named the Q Society to be the champion of Quetzalcoatl and battle their enemy, the deity Tezcatlipoca. He is given a magical suit of armor that bestows many abilities and augmenting his strength. After his training is completed, he enters the United States and assumes the identity of recently deceased physician Curt Falconer.

Aztek later joins the Justice League, but resigns after learning that Lex Luthor is a benefactor of the Q Society. He is blinded while battling the planet-destroying machine Mageddon, who is revealed to be Tezcatlipoca. In &quot;World War III&quot;, Aztek sacrifices himself to help Superman destroy Mageddon/Tezcatlipoca.

===Nayeli Constant===
A new version of the character, Nayeli Constant, debuted in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; vol. 5 #20. She is a software engineer in Austin, Texas who obtains Aztek&#x27;s helmet and armor and modifies them to suit her needs. Constant comes into conflict with the Ray, as they both seek to protect Vanity, before they decide to work together.

==Powers and abilities==
Aztek has peak human physical and mental conditioning. He wears an ancient helmet and armor powered by a &quot;four-dimensional mirror&quot;, from which he derives flight, infrared and X-ray vision, invisibility, intangibility, bodyheat camouflage, entrapment nets, plasma beams and density manipulation, as well as augmenting his peak physical abilities to superhuman levels. The helmet could feed information directly into his brain even after he was blinded in his first confrontation with Mageddon. The four-dimensional power source could self-destruct in a highly explosive manner.

== Other versions ==
An alternate timeline variant of Aztek known as Azteka appears in the &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; storyline.

== In other media ==
* Aztek appears in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, voiced by Chris Cox in &quot;Question Authority&quot; and Corey Burton in &quot;I Am Legion&quot;. This version is a member of the Justice League.
* Aztek appears as a character summon in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.

== Bibliography ==
The original run of the eponymous title has been collected as a trade paperback: &quot;JLA Presents: Aztek, the Ultimate Man&quot; (by co-authors Grant Morrison and Mark Millar, and pencils by N. Steven Harris, and inks by Keith Champagne, 1996; collects &quot;Aztek, the Ultimate Man&quot; #1–10, 240 pages, April 2008, ).

Aztek also appeared in several issues of Morrison&#x27;s &quot;JLA&quot; (5, 10–12, 15, 36, 38–41), as well as the final two issues of Mark Millar&#x27;s &quot;JLA: Paradise Lost&quot; and his fill-in issue for &quot;JLA&quot; (27).

He has profile entries in &quot;JLA Secret Files and Origins&quot; #1, &quot;JLA–Z&quot; #1, and &quot;The DC Comics Encyclopedia&quot;.

<text>The Independent Eye is an American theatre company currently based in Sebastopol, California.

The group was founded in 1974 by Conrad Bishop and Elizabeth Fuller, who were then performing with Theatre X in Milwaukee and had helped to found that group. Bishop and Fuller moved to Chicago and began writing and producing their own work, performing sometimes as a duo and sometimes with a small core of collaborators. The group was later established as a regional theatre in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and Philadelphia, before moving to Sebastopol in 1999. It has toured throughout the United States and Europe, and has created numerous works for radio. Its current public radio series &quot;Hitchhiking off the Map&quot; has won a Silver Reel Award from the National Federation of Community Broadcasters.

<text>William Thomas Ward (born 5 May 1948) is an English drummer. He was a co-founder and the original drummer for the heavy metal band Black Sabbath. Ward helped found Black Sabbath in 1968 alongside bandmates Ozzy Osbourne (lead singer), Tony Iommi (guitarist), and Geezer Butler (bass).

==Biography==
===Early years and Black Sabbath===
Bill started to play drums as a child, listening to the big bands of the 1940s; his early major influences were Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich and Louie Bellson. Later he was influenced by drummers such as Larrie Londin, Bernard Purdie, Joe Morello, Keef Hartley, Hughie Flint, John Bonham, Ringo Starr, Jim Capaldi and Clive Bunker. In the mid-1960s Ward sang and played drums in a band called the Rest, before he and guitarist Tony Iommi played together in a band called Mythology, and upon that band&#x27;s dissolution joined vocalist Ozzy Osbourne and bassist Geezer Butler, who had previously played together in a band called Rare Breed. The new band called themselves Earth, but were soon renamed Black Sabbath. During this time Ward played occasionally with the band Bakerloo.

Ward&#x27;s drug and alcohol use increased throughout Black Sabbath&#x27;s heyday. By the late 1970s he was drinking during gigs, something he had never done before. He also began experiencing panic attacks. Ward has said he cannot remember the recording of the 1980 album &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; due to his alcohol abuse. According to Black Sabbath bandmate Iommi, Ward disappeared on 21 August 1980, without saying goodbye, other than a telephone call to then-Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio informing him &quot;I&#x27;m off then, Ron.&quot; He then briefly played in a band called Max Havoc. He sat out one album (1981&#x27;s &quot;Mob Rules&quot;) before returning to Black Sabbath for 1983&#x27;s &quot;Born Again&quot; album. Ward once again left for health reasons before the band toured in support of &quot;Born Again&quot;. He again rejoined Black Sabbath in 1984 to record new material with David Donato but after several demo tapes, he once again left Sabbath.

===Pranks===

According to Tony Iommi, he and the band would often set Ward&#x27;s beard on fire and perform other harmful pranks on him. On one occasion, Ward even received third-degree burns. In an interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot;, Iommi described it as follows:

Iommi claims that Ward almost died after a prank-gone-wrong during recording of &quot;Vol. 4&quot; in 1972. The band were renting a Bel Air mansion belonging to John DuPont of the DuPont chemical company. The band found several spray cans of gold DuPont paint in a room of the house; finding Ward naked and unconscious after a night of heavy drinking, they thought it would be funny to cover the drummer from head to toe in gold paint. Ward soon became violently ill and had a seizure and an ambulance had to be called. The paint had blocked all of Ward&#x27;s pores, which his bandmates were subsequently informed can be fatal.

===Solo career===
After a few years in hiatus, Ward decided to return to playing music in the late 1980s. In 1989 he went to work on a solo album, which featured a huge array of guest musicians, including former Black Sabbath bandmate Ozzy Osbourne and his guitarist, Zakk Wylde. Released in January 1990, &quot;Ward One: Along the Way&quot; showcased Ward&#x27;s versatility in musical tastes and abilities; he even sang vocals on some of the songs. It would be seven years before he released his second solo album, &quot;When the Bough Breaks&quot;, in 1997.

In 2002 he released the song &quot;Straws&quot; as a single for charity. The song would reappear on his 2015 album &quot;Accountable Beasts&quot;.

===Later career===

Before the full Black Sabbath reunion, Ward and the original Sabbath had reunited twice for short sets, first for Live Aid in 1985 and then at a Costa Mesa, California Ozzy Osbourne show on 15 November 1992. Sabbath, with Judas Priest singer Rob Halford replacing Ronnie James Dio who had recently left the band, opened the show for Osbourne. The Ozzy Osbourne band (Osbourne, Zakk Wylde, Mike Inez, Randy Castillo and John Sinclair) then did a full set before Osbourne was reunited with Iommi, Butler and Ward for four numbers.

Ward made a brief return to the band for a South American tour in 1994 with Tony Martin fronting, before finally rejoining the band for the two shows at the Birmingham NEC, England on 4 and 5 December 1997, which made up the &quot;Reunion&quot; album. When what was billed as the original line-up reunited for the Ozzfest tour in 1997, Mike Bordin played drums.

Ward was forced to skip all but the last two Black Sabbath appearances in 1998 while he recovered from a heart attack suffered during the tour rehearsals that May. As the band rehearsed, Ward stopped and asked if he could lie down for a spell. He then asked for his assistant and informed the band that his arm had gone numb. Iommi and Butler then left for a short time, not knowing the severity of Ward&#x27;s condition. Outside, they saw an ambulance pass but weren&#x27;t aware what was happening. Upon returning to the rehearsal space a short time later, a frantic Osbourne informed them &quot;Bill has had a heart attack! Bill has had a heart attack!&quot; As was the case in 1980, he was replaced at short notice by Vinny Appice, although this time it was always intended to be a temporary absence for Ward, health permitting.

In 2000, Ward participated in a partial Black Sabbath reunion of sorts, joining Iommi and Osbourne to record the track &quot;Who&#x27;s Fooling Who&quot; for Iommi&#x27;s first solo album.

Since mid-2002, Ward has done a monthly internet-only radio show named &quot;Rock 50&quot; on radio station WPMD from Cerritos College in California. Ward plays a variety of metal, hard rock, and some classic rock.

===Brief reunion with Black Sabbath===
In October 2006, news leaked that Ward would be reuniting with Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Ronnie James Dio for a tour though under the moniker Heaven &amp; Hell. However, Ward later decided not to participate in the tour or continue participation in the band because of musical differences with &quot;a couple of the other bandmembers&quot; and a reported concern about extended touring. His spot in the band was filled by Vinny Appice.

On 11 November 2011, Iommi, Butler, Osbourne, and Ward announced that they were reuniting to record a new album with producer Rick Rubin and to start touring in 2012. In February 2012, however, Ward left before work commenced on &quot;13&quot;, the first studio recording to include original band members Iommi, Osbourne and Butler since the live album &quot;Reunion&quot; (1998), which contained two new studio tracks, one of which featured Ward&#x27;s playing. Ward said that he had failed to reach an agreement regarding his contract. However, he did later admit that his weight would have been an issue in a 2013 tour. Osbourne also suggested in an open letter that Ward&#x27;s decision not to take part was down to his health. In April 2015, Ward criticised Osbourne on his Facebook fan page via a letter to his and the band&#x27;s fans. This prompted a rebuttal from Osbourne on his Facebook page:

Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave drummer Brad Wilk filled in for Ward for &quot;13&quot;.

Ward&#x27;s surgery on his shoulder prevented him from playing drums again until May 2014, delaying his third studio album &quot;Accountable Beasts&quot;. He had also expressed a desire to tour behind the album once it is released, provided that sales were acceptable.

Ward reunited with Sabbath members Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler to accept the &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; award at the May 2015 Ivor Novello Awards.

In 2016, Ward debuted with a new band called &quot;Day of Errors&quot;, which played its first gig in June that year at Gaslamp in Long Beach, California and also features Joe Amodea on guitar/vocals and Kill Devil Hill singer Jason &quot;Dewey&quot; Bragg on vocals.

Ward was due to play a string of dates with his new band in December 2017 but had to cancel these when he was hospitalised with heart problems in November.

He once again reunited with Iommi and Butler in Los Angeles in May 2019, as Black Sabbath were awarded a Lifetime Achievement Grammy. Though Sabbath did not perform, Rival Sons performed a set of their songs for the occasion. A short time later, Osbourne said in an interview that he wants to play one last show with the band&#x27;s original line-up. Ward announced three weeks later on his Instagram that he loved all three of his former Black Sabbath bandmates very much and was open-minded to playing a final show with them. The last show Black Sabbath played was on 4 February 2017 in their native Birmingham, with Tommy Clufetos on drums instead of Ward. He also says, &quot;I would love to do a studio album with Sabbath, with all the original members. I&#x27;m just saying that I&#x27;m just floating that out there – I haven&#x27;t talked to anybody about that or anything else.&quot;

In February 2025, it was announced that Ward would reunite with Black Sabbath, for a final one-off show at Villa Park on 5 July 2025.

==Personal life==
Ward has two sons, Nigel and Aron, and one daughter, Emily.

According to his Black Sabbath bandmates Tony Iommi and Ozzy Osbourne, Ward has dramatically changed his lifestyle since Black Sabbath&#x27;s 1970s and early 80s heyday. Iommi says he stopped smoking, gave up alcohol, became a vegan, and does not use drugs of any kind. Osbourne says that Ward has been sober for approximately 30 years. However, more recently Osbourne has criticised Ward&#x27;s health, describing him in 2013 as &quot;incredibly overweight&quot; and suggesting that he would have been unable to drum for Black Sabbath had he stayed in the band following their 2011 reunion, given his physical condition, although Ward himself has insisted his health has not affected his ability to play the drums.

Ward later admitted he underwent gastrointestinal surgery in 2013, and is still recovering. &quot;Currently my health is not bad but it&#x27;s certainly not good enough to play in any band, never mind Black Sabbath.&quot; By 2021, he admitted that he was no longer able to play his drum parts for Black Sabbath, but was open to recording another studio album with them.

Ward stated in an interview he &quot;lost a friend&quot; in Osbourne after his statements about Ward&#x27;s health in 2012, but maintained contact with Butler and Iommi. However, they appear to have reconciled since then, as Osbourne named Ward as one of the people that kept in touch with him during his health problems in 2019.

In 2016, Ward expressed his distaste for religion saying that he grew up in a &quot;heathen&quot; family and did not believe in a &quot;fire and brimstone god [...] bloody rubbish!&quot; He did however enjoy singing in Sunday church choirs growing up.

== Influence ==
Drumming website Totaldrumsets has listed Ward among &quot;The 100 Most Influential Drummers Ever!&quot; and has defined him &quot;the mastermind behind the unholy birth of heavy metal drumming&quot;.

In 2016, he was ranked 42nd in Rolling Stone&#x27;s list &quot;100 Greatest Drummers of All Time&quot;.

==Equipment==
In the early years of Black Sabbath, Ward used Ludwig and Slingerland drum kits, as well as Zyn and Zildjian cymbals and Speedking drum pedals. Currently, he uses Tama drums, Sabian cymbals, Vic Firth drumsticks, and Gibraltar hardware.

<text>Reutlingen (; ) is a city in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is the capital of the eponymous district of Reutlingen. As of June 2018, it had an estimated population of 116,456. Reutlingen has a university of applied sciences, which was founded in 1855, originally as a weavers&#x27; school. Today, Reutlingen is a home to an established textile industry and also houses machinery, leather goods and steel manufacturing facilities. It has the narrowest street in the world, Spreuerhofstraße (width 31 cm).

==Geography==
Reutlingen is located about south of the State capital of Baden-Württemberg, Stuttgart. It lies in the Southwest corner of Germany, right next to the Swabian Jura, and that is why it is often called &quot;The gateway to the Swabian Jura&quot; (). The Echaz river, a tributary of the Neckar, flows through the city centre.

Along with the old university town of Tübingen (about to the west), Reutlingen is the centre of the Neckar-Alb region. It is also part of the larger Stuttgart Metropolitan Region.

===Climate===
==History==
The first settlements in the area are believed to date from the 4th or 5th century.
Some time around 1030, Count Egino started to build a castle on top of the &quot;Achalm&quot;, one of the largest mountains in Reutlingen district (about 706 m). One of the towers of this castle was rebuilt in the 19th century and is open to visitors. The name &quot;Reutlingen&quot; was first mentioned in writing in the so-called &quot;Bempflingen Treaty&quot; () which is dated approximately 1089–90.

Reutlingen&#x27;s earliest documented mention dates back to 1089 in the Bempflingen Treaty, which was an inheritance agreement between Zwiefalten Monastery and the descendants of the Achalm Count. In 1180, Reutlingen was given market privileges by Frederick Barbarossa. The settlement of Reutlingen was likely concentrated around the present-day Katharinenstraße and Untere Wilhelmstraße due to strategic considerations.

Around 1180, Reutlingen received market rights and, between 1220 and 1240 it was promoted to city status and city-walls and fortifications were built. Shortly thereafter, from 1247 to 1343, the city&#x27;s landmark, the St. Mary&#x27;s Church () was built.

In 1377 Reutlingen was the scene of a victory by the Swabian League, formed in the previous year by 14 Swabian cities, led by Ulm, over the Count of Württemberg. In 1519, a later Swabian League came to Reutlingen&#x27;s help when Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg attempted to seize the city; the League landed a crushing blow, conquering Württemberg and selling it to Charles V.
In 1495 and 1516 the Jews were exiled from the city.
As a result of such struggles, Reutlingen became an Imperial City of the Holy Roman Empire, free from allegiance to the Duke of Württemberg. In 1530, Reutlingen&#x27;s city council signed the Augsburg Confession, and in 1580 and the Formula of Concord, key documents of Lutheranism. In 1803, in the wake of the French Revolutionary Wars, Reutlingen lost its independence in the German Mediatisation, being restored to Württemberg.

The worst disaster in the history of Reutlingen happened in 1726, when a major fire swept through the city, destroying 80% of all residential houses and almost all public buildings, and making 1,200 families homeless. The impact of this fire, which lasted three days, is still visible today.

During World War II, the wings of the V-1 flying bomb were manufactured in Reutlingen, making the city the target of several allied bombing raids.

The reconstruction of Reutlingen and its democratization is closely linked to the name Oskar Kalbfells, who was the first democratically elected mayor of the city to shape Reutlingen&#x27;s political history until 1973 after World War II.

In 1947 Reutlingen came to the newly founded state of Württemberg-Hohenzollern, which merged with the state of Baden-Württemberg in 1952.

On 24 July 2016 a Syrian killed a pregnant woman in a machete attack.

==Culture==
On Mutscheltag (the first Thursday after Epiphany), townspeople gather in halls and homes to play games of dice, the winner of which earns parts or whole Mutschel loaves of bread. The Mutschelspiele (Mutschel games) consist of small games scored by tally marks, and are won both independently and by grand total at the end of the hour or night. This tradition is unique to the city of Reutlingen.

<text>Black Lightning (Jefferson Michael &quot;Jeff&quot; Pierce) is a superhero who appears in American comic book published by DC Comics. The character, created by writer Jenny Blake Isabella with artist Trevor Von Eeden, first appeared in &quot;Black Lightning&quot; #1 (April 1977), during the Bronze Age of Comic Books. Although his precise origin story has varied over the years, he is generally depicted as a metahuman superhero who uses the ability to generate and control electricity to defend his community – and the world – as Black Lightning. Although not the first black superhero to be featured in DC Comics stories, Black Lightning was DC&#x27;s first African-American superhero to headline his own series.

In his earliest stories, Black Lightning was depicted as a schoolteacher from the crime-ridden Suicide Slum area of Metropolis who acquires electrical superpowers from a technologically advanced power belt that he put to use to clean up crime in his neighborhood. Over time, Pierce establishes himself as a successful superhero in the DC Universe, and later stories depict him as having &quot;internalized&quot; the belt&#x27;s powers as a result of his latent metagene. Later retellings of Black Lightning&#x27;s origins simplified his story by depicting him as a metahuman with the inborn ability to manipulate and generate electricity. The character later went on to father two superhero daughters, Thunder and Lightning, and work closely alongside Batman as a founding member of the Outsiders superhero team.

DC originally commissioned Isabella to create its first black character following on from Isabella&#x27;s successful work for Marvel Comics with Luke Cage. However, only 11 issues of the series were published before DC ran into financial trouble in 1978 which led them to cut back the majority of their titles. The character went on instead to be featured prominently in books like &quot;Justice League of America&quot; in DC&#x27;s new slimmed-down offering of titles, exposing him to more readers, with the character being remembered for providing critical perspective on established superheroes like Batman and Superman. Early elements of the character were controversial, and later removed or toned down. For example, in early stories, he wore an afro wig and spoke in an exaggerated Harlem jive vernacular to disguise that he was in fact the highly educated schoolteacher, Jefferson Pierce.

Black Lightning had proven a popular character for DC and was ranked 85th overall on &quot;IGN&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Comic Books Heroes&quot; list in 2011. The character has been adapted into various media, including animated television series, video games, and comic strips. Cress Williams portrays Black Lightning in a self-titled series and the Arrowverse series &quot;The Flash&quot; and &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;.

==Creation==
In her blog, Isabella wrote that the character&#x27;s background as a teacher at her former high school was inspired by the sitcom &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;. The superhero name &quot;Black Lightning&quot; originated from a &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; cover displayed on Julius Schwartz&#x27;s wall, in which she asks another superhero to &quot;stop this black lightning before it splits that building in two&quot;. Isabella liked the reference to lightning and wrote: &quot;The words &#x27;black lightning&#x27; sounded cool to me in the era when so many movies included &#x27;black&#x27; in their titles, so I decided that&#x27;s what I would name my creation.&quot;

==Publication history==

The original candidate for DC Comics&#x27; first headlining black superhero was a character called the Black Bomber, a white racist who would turn into a black superhero under stress. Comics historian Don Markstein later described the character as &quot;an insult to practically everybody with any point of view at all&quot;. When the editor who had approved the Black Bomber left the company before the character had seen print, Jenny Blake Isabella (whose previous writing experience included Luke Cage, a black Marvel Comics superhero with his own title) was asked to salvage the character. Isabella convinced editors to instead use her Black Lightning character, which she had been developing for some time.

Isabella wrote the first 10 issues of &quot;Black Lightning&quot; (before handing it over to Dennis O&#x27;Neil and Trevor Von Eeden), designed the character&#x27;s original costume, and drew the first 11 issues. Only one issue scripted by O&#x27;Neil came out before the series was canceled in 1978 as part of a general large-scale pruning of the company&#x27;s superhero titles known as the DC Implosion. Issue #12 was published in &quot;Cancelled Comic Cavalcade&quot; and &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #260.

Black Lightning made a number of guest appearances in various titles over the next few years, including a string of issues of &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; written by O&#x27;Neil, then shifted to &quot;Detective Comics&quot; and a two-part story in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; in which he declined an offer of membership. In 1983, with his powers restored, he regularly appeared again as a member of Batman&#x27;s spinoff superhero team, the Outsiders. When &quot;The Outsiders&quot; ended, he returned to making occasional guest appearances.

In 1995, a new &quot;Black Lightning&quot; series began with art by Eddy Newell and again written by Jenny Blake Isabella, who was fired after the eighth issue and replaced with Australian writer Dave de Vries. The series was canceled five issues after Isabella left the title, the decision having been made before these issues had seen print. Isabella said she believes the editor replaced her with a newer writer to consolidate his position in the company.

A &quot;Black Lightning: Year One&quot; six-issue limited series, written by Jen Van Meter and illustrated by Cully Hamner saw a bi-weekly release in 2009, and was nominated for two Glyph Awards in 2010.

As part of the New 52, a revamped version of Black Lightning appeared in &quot;DC Universe Presents&quot; that was paired with the Blue Devil.

==Fictional character biography==
===Year One===
A gold medal-winning Olympic decathlete, Jefferson Michael Pierce returned to his old neighborhood in the Southside (Suicide Slum) section of the city of Metropolis with his wife Lynn Stewart and his daughter Anissa to become the principal of Garfield High School. Southside, as it was once known, was where his father—renowned journalist Alvin Pierce—had been murdered. Guilt over this event was a factor in his decision to leave the city of Metropolis. Suicide Slum was being torn apart by a local organized criminal gang called the 100, shady corporations, and crooked local politicians like Tobias Whale. A family friend and tailor, Peter Gambi, had taught a much younger Jefferson how to suppress his inborn metahuman abilities so that he would not accidentally hurt any of the people he cared about. Upon his return, Gambi suggested to Jefferson that he should use his powers to help the neighborhood, and refers him to a plaque with the paraphrased Milo Sweetman quote &quot;Justice, like lightning, should ever appear to some men hope, to other men fear&quot;. (the original text of which was &quot;Justice, like lightning, ever should appear to few men&#x27;s ruin, but to all men&#x27;s fear. Of mortal justice if thou scorn the rod, believe and tremble, thou art judged of God&quot;.) Appalled by the public murder of Earl Clifford, one of his more promising students, Pierce tried to intervene on behalf of the schoolchildren but quickly learned that the 100 objected violently to any interference. Pierce adopts the costumed identity &quot;Black Lightning&quot; where he had the costume, mask, and wig made by Gambi.

Years later, he would tell fellow African-American superhero Mister Terrific that he chose the name &quot;Black&quot; Lightning because he &quot;was the only one of us around&quot; at the time, and he &quot;wanted to make sure everyone knew who they were dealing with.&quot;

===Outsiders===

After his own series was cancelled, Black Lightning lost his electrical powers, but continued fighting without them. The loss eventually turned out to be psychosomatic, a symptom of a crisis of confidence resulting from the accidental death of a female bystander named Trina Shelton during an altercation between Black Lightning and some gun-wielding thugs. Batman, wanting to recruit him to rescue Lucius Fox in Markovia, helped him regain his powers; this eventually led him to join Batman&#x27;s team, the Outsiders. During his time with the Outsiders, a group of villains called the Masters of Disaster captured Black Lightning at the behest of the parents of Trina Shelton to avenge the death of their daughter; however, upon learning that he still regretted what happened and was willing to be executed by them, they risked their lives to save him. In &quot;Invasion!&quot;, the Dominators detonated a Gene-Bomb that wreaked havoc with anyone possessing the metagene by making them lose control of their powers. After the breakup of the Outsiders, Black Lightning moved to Brick City to continue his solo career.

===Secretary of Education===
When Lex Luthor was elected President of the United States in 2000, he appointed Jefferson Pierce as Secretary of Education, with Pierce accepting as he concluded that he could do more good working within the system than outside it. He resigned amidst controversy over his &quot;worst-kept secret in Washington&quot; identity as Black Lightning and his alleged inadvertent killing of a criminally-minded corporate CEO, for which President Pete Ross (who had since succeeded Luthor) then pardoned him.

Making frequent guest appearances in several DC series, Pierce has appeared in &quot;Green Arrow&quot; (who had a one-night stand with his niece, a successful attorney named Joanna Pierce). Pierce helped the Green Arrow track down Dr. Light in the &quot;Green Arrow&quot; &quot;Heading into the Light&quot; story arc. He also appeared in the new &quot;Outsiders&quot;, of which his daughter, Anissa (using the alias Thunder), is a member. He came to fight the new Sabbac and help his daughter alongside Captain Marvel Jr. and the Outsiders. He had on an outfit that mixed his second outfit with the colors of the first. After teaming up with the Outsiders, incoming President Pete Ross asked him to resign as Secretary of Education. which he did.

At some point prior to his resignation, Pierce used his pull in Washington to deny the gangster Holocaust a permit to build a casino on Paris Island in Dakota. This would come back to haunt Pierce sometime later when the enraged Holocaust attacked him while he was giving the graduation speech at Ernest Hemingway High School.

===&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;===
In issue #5 of the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline, it was shown that Black Lightning was one of the eight people Batman had considered to aid him in destroying the Brother Eye satellite, which controlled the OMACs. Booster Gold, who was not on the list of eight, but knew about the candidates from his knowledge of the future, contacted Lightning before Batman did, as historical data from the future had shown who had aided Batman. Lightning accepted, arriving at the Batcave to await orders. He then forged an uneasy yet effective alliance with Mister Terrific, combining their powers of electrical manipulation and invisibility technology to strike at the villainous AI from the inside.

After the third Secret Society of Super Villains was formed, Black Lightning (as a member of Brad Meltzer&#x27;s new Justice League) began using his status as Lex Luthor&#x27;s former Secretary of Education to gain information from supervillains.

===Outsiders redux===
In &quot;Outsiders&quot; vol. 3 #45, it was revealed that three years have passed since Jefferson&#x27;s niece Joanna Pierce was murdered and that, upon initially learning of her death, Jefferson went after the corrupt businessman Martin Somers, the man who was responsible. He had intended to wound Somers with his lightning shot, but apparently ended up killing him. Jefferson turned himself in to the authorities. However, it is revealed that Deathstroke was responsible for Somers&#x27; death by firing a dart of toxin to Somers moments before Jefferson shot his lightning. Hence, he was dead before he hit the ground. Jason Todd discovered the truth while eavesdropping on the assassin&#x27;s conversation with Lex Luthor (who was really Alexander Luthor, Jr. in disguise) and contacted Nightwing with this information. When Nightwing and Anissa told Jefferson of this in prison, he disbelieved it and intended to pay for Somers&#x27; death. Anissa herself intended to break her father out of Iron Heights Prison. Upon learning from Todd that other inmates were about to carry out a contract hit on Pierce (whose identity as an inmate had leaked to unknown parties), the Outsiders resolved to assist her. They freed him from jail and, with the audio recording of Deathstroke&#x27;s conversation, cleared his name.

===Justice League of America===
Years ago, the Green Arrow brought Black Lightning to the attention of the Justice League of America, who extended an offer of membership to Black Lightning. He turned down the offer, preferring to work as a loner and focus on street-level crime, though he did offer to become a reservist. Years later, when all of the JLA reservists were called in to fight a newly revived Amazo, Black Lighting was one of the heroes called, confirming that the League had accepted his offer. Most recently, however, Black Lightning has joined the JLA, once again appearing with a modified costume. He appears to be primarily based in Washington, D.C. again. Black Lightning assists the JLA with intelligence gathered from the criminal community. Many supervillains still believe he is &#x27;in&#x27; with Lex Luthor and are thus willing to cooperate with him. Jefferson also helps the team in a battle against Amazo. He was the first member of the League to respond to the recent attacks made by the Amazons of Themyscira, and he also saved the President of the United States in this event.

Black Lightning was the focus of the one-shot issue &quot;Final Crisis: Submit&quot;, in which he helped Tattooed Man and his family escape at the cost of his own freedom. He is subsequently shown in issue #4 of &quot;Final Crisis&quot; under Darkseid&#x27;s thrall.

===Outsiders===
Alfred Pennyworth recruits Black Lightning into a new version of the Outsiders following an attack by Doctor Hurt which left Thunder comatose. Unlike previous iterations of the team, these Outsiders must live &quot;off the grid&quot; and stay out of contact with friends and family for months at a time. It is confirmed that, due to this new commitment, Black Lightning has left the Justice League.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In DC&#x27;s 2011 reboot of its continuity, &quot;The New 52&quot;, Black Lightning comes into conflict with Blue Devil over their confrontation of Tobias Whale&#x27;s crime wave. He later made an appearance as a possible recruit for the Justice League.

===&quot;Black Lightning: Cold Dead Hands&quot;===
Black Lightning appeared in &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; in Detective Comics, and from there spun out into the series &quot;Batman &amp; the Outsiders&quot;. Jenny Blake Isabella, the creator of Black Lightning, rebooted the character in a 2017 miniseries.

==Powers and abilities==

Originally, Black Lightning had no innate powers, using a belt that allowed him to generate a force field and project electrical bolts. He was later retconned to be a metahuman.

Black Lightning can produce a vast amount of bioelectricity he can channel against his opponents to a variety of effects, from stunning to killing. With more effort, he can control the electromagnetic force-field generated by his power to use it as shield against incoming attacks and to ionise objects to throw them to enemies.
==Supporting characters==
===Family===
Jefferson has had two daughters by his ex-wife Lynn Stewart, both of whom have followed in his footsteps and become superheroes. His oldest daughter, Anissa Pierce, has taken on the code name &quot;Thunder&quot; and served on an incarnation of his team the Outsiders. His 16-year-old, younger daughter Jennifer Pierce, was recently recruited by the Justice Society of America under the code name &quot;Lightning&quot;. A version of Lightning first appeared in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, a 1996 miniseries published by DC Comics.

Pierce claims that people frequently ask him if related to Static, much to his chagrin. It is later revealed that Static is a fan of Black Lightning and has a poster of the hero in his room in Titans Tower.

<text>The Obion River system is the primary surface water drainage system of northwestern Tennessee, United States.

==Description==

The Obion has four major forks, the North Fork, Middle Fork, South Fork and Rutherford Fork (which is named after Henry Rutherford an early surveyor of the area). The confluences of these forks are a few miles above the mouth of the Obion&#x27;s discharge into the Mississippi River. For the greater parts of their lengths, the forks exist as separate streams.

In the mid-20th century, the Obion system was largely channelized for agricultural purposes, under the auspices of the &quot;Obion-Forked Deer Basin Authority&quot;, a Tennessee state agency that coordinated this work with the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Some of the adverse effects of channelization included increasing erosion of land, loss of wildlife habitat, and increased flooding downstream. But with the restoration of wetlands along the river in the 21st century, this process has now been halted and – in a few places – somewhat reversed.

The origin of the name &quot;Obion&quot; is obscure. Some say that it is derived from a Native American word and others that it represents a corruption of the name of an Irish fur trapper, O&#x27;Bion or, perhaps, O&#x27;Brien.

Obion County, Tennessee, is named after the Obion River.

After the 1818 Chickasaw cession of West Tennessee (known in Kentucky as Jackson Purchase), explorer Davy Crockett moved to the South Fork Obion River in Weakley County (present-day Gibson County after restructuring of the county in 1837). There he built a log cabin along the River, where he and his family resided until his trip to Texas in 1835. 

On February 16th, 2025 a levee along the Onion River failed, resulting in widespread flooding in multiple countries in West Tennessee. The entire town of Rives was completely flooding resulting in water rescues.wpsd

He was the son of Maria Hampton, a daughter of Dr. John Thomas Hampton, a soldier of the American Revolutionary War and a close friend of Thomas Jefferson. His grandmother, Mercy Harris-Hampton, was the daughter of Benjamin Harris, the &quot;fighting Quaker&quot; of the American Revolutionary War. Benjamin Harris Brewster was named after him.

Benjamin&#x27;s father was Francis Enoch Brewster, a descendant of William Brewster, a passenger on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. The elder Brewster was a successful and well-known attorney in Philadelphia who had abandoned Benjamin&#x27;s mother, Maria Hampton, for her companion Isabella Anderson, by whom he had two children out of wedlock. His step-brothers were Frederick Carroll Brewster (1825–1898), who became Attorney General of Pennsylvania, and Enoch Carroll Brewster (1828–1863).

Benjamin&#x27;s sister, Anne Hampton Brewster (1818–1892), was one of America&#x27;s first female foreign correspondents, publishing primarily in Philadelphia, New York and Boston newspapers. She was a &quot;social outlaw&quot; (as a friend described her) by refusing to marry, by converting to Catholicism, by moving out of her older brother Benjamin&#x27;s house in order to live alone, by moving to Rome, and, foremost, by continuing to write through it all, first as a dilettante and then as a self-supporting professional.

In their father&#x27;s will he had named his two sons Frederick and Enoch Carroll Brewster as his sole beneficiaries. Benjamin fought on behalf of his sister for her share of the estate and for the destruction of the will, which he eventually won.

===Education===

He graduated from Princeton College in 1834, and was conferred upon the degrees of A.B., A.M., and LL.D. He studied law in the office of Eli Kirk Price, a noted Philadelphia lawyer and legal reformer and who was head of the Philadelphia Bar, and he was admitted to practice on January 5, 1838.

===Marriages===
In 1857, he married as his first wife, Elizabeth von Myerbach de Reinfeldts, the widow of Dr. Shulte of Paris, France. Elizabeth died in 1868; however, Benjamin continued to spend many vacations with his wife&#x27;s parents in Germany near Cologne. There were no children from his first marriage.

He was remarried on July 12, 1870. His second wife, Mary Walker, was born in Mississippi on December 13, 1839, and died on March 9, 1886, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was the daughter of Robert John Walker, Secretary of the Treasury under President James Knox Polk and Mary Blechenden Bache. Mary Bache was the daughter of Sophia Durrell Dallas and Richard Bache Jr., who served in the Republic of Texas Navy and was elected as a Representative to the Second Texas Legislature in 1847. Sophia was the daughter of Arabella Maria Smith and Alexander J. Dallas an American statesman who served as the U.S. Treasury Secretary under President James Madison. She was a great-granddaughter of Sarah Franklin Bache and Richard Bache, and a great-great-granddaughter of Benjamin Franklin. In addition she was a niece of George Mifflin Dallas, the 11th Vice President of the United States, who served under James K. Polk.

Mary Walker married Adrien Deslonde on May 25, 1858. He was the son of André Deslonde, a sugar planter from St. James Parish, Louisiana. Deslonde&#x27;s sister Caroline was the wife of P.G.T. Beauregard and his sister Mathilde was the wife of John Slidell. Walker and Deslonde later divorced, after which Mary Walker married Benjamin Brewster. The children of Mary Walker and Adrien Deslonde included Andre W. Brewster, who was raised by Brewster and took his name.

===Family===
Benjamin and Mary had one child, Benjamin Harris Brewster, Jr., born on October 22, 1872, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Benjamin, Sr.&#x27;s great-grandson was Daniel Baugh Brewster (November 23, 1923 – August 19, 2007), a Democratic member of the United States Senate, who represented the State of Maryland from 1963 until 1969. He was also a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1950 to 1958, and a representative from the 2nd congressional district of Maryland in the United States House of Representatives from 1959 to 1963.

==Career==
In 1846 Brewster was appointed commissioner by President James K. Polk to adjudicate the claims of the Cherokee against the U.S. federal government. He was appointed Attorney General of Pennsylvania in 1867 by Governor John W. Geary.

He was chief prosecutor in the case of the U.S. Postal Service&#x27;s Star Route Frauds.

In 1881, Chester A. Arthur appointed Brewster Attorney General of the United States, an office he held for the duration of Arthur&#x27;s term.

==Death==

He died on April 4, 1888, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he is buried in Woodlands Cemetery.

<doc id="853140" wikidata="Q3934793" url="?curid=853140" title="Richard Dragon">
<text>Richard Dragon (or simply Dragon) is the alias of two characters appearing in media published by DC Comics. Although both incarnations differ in alignment, they are both portrayed as accomplished martial artists with connections to the League of Assassins.

The first incarnation, Richard Drakunovski, was created by Dennis O&#x27;Neil and James R. Berry in the novel &quot;Kung Fu Master, Richard Dragon: Dragon&#x27;s Fists&quot; (1974) under the pseudonym &quot;Jim Dennis&quot;. O&#x27;Neil later adapted the character for DC Comics in the comic book &quot;Richard Dragon, Kung Fu Fighter&quot;. A thief who was trained in martial arts and decided to use his skills for good, the character is considered one of DC Comic&#x27;s premier martial artists alongside peers such as Bronze Tiger, Lady Shiva, and Batman. In more recent continuities, the character is depicted as a more benevolent member of the League of Assassins who was killed by a former student.

In DC&#x27;s New 52 continuity, a new villainous character who uses the alias is revealed to be the Green Arrow villain Ricardo Diaz Jr. Raised as son of a kingpin, the character would be prompted to seek revenge after witnessing Green Arrow kill his father. Eventually finding the League of Assassins, he was mentored by Richard Drakunvoski in martial arts but rejected his more peaceful philosophies and killed his master before adopting his moniker.

The Ricardo Diaz incarnation of the character appears in &quot;Arrow&quot;, portrayed by Kirk Acevedo.

==Fictional character biography==
===Richard Drakunovski===
As a teenage sneak thief in Japan, young Richard Dragon broke into a dojo outside of Kyoto to steal a priceless jade Buddha. Before he could get away, Dragon was caught and beaten by the dojo&#x27;s teenage student, Ben Turner. O-Sensei, the dojo&#x27;s master, saw something worth nurturing in Richard, and for the next seven years taught Ben and Richard, side by side, mastery of the martial arts. Richard came to find an inner peace, only using his skill when absolutely necessary. Once he felt there was nothing more he could teach them, the O-Sensei left the two. Turner and Dragon were recruited by Barney Ling, head of the law-keeping espionage agency known as G.O.O.D. (Global Organization of Organized Defense), to join the organization. Together Ben and Richard would defeat the corrupt businessman Guano Cravat, foiling his plans to instigate a war for his own benefit. Ben and Richard founded a martial arts dojo in Manhattan, and Richard would go on to battle international threats such as Telegram Sam, the Preying Mantis, the League of Assassins, and his former superior, Barney Ling.

Thirsty for revenge, Cravat would arrange for the murder of Carolyn Wu-San, one of O-Sensei&#x27;s god-daughters. Aided by Barney Ling, Cravat tricked Carolyn&#x27;s sister, Sandra Wu-San, into believing Dragon was the murderer. Consumed with a need for revenge, Sandra trained to the peak of human capability, mastering martial arts to defeat Dragon. When the two masters finally met in battle, however, Dragon was able to show Sandra that Cravat had deceived her. Without Dragon&#x27;s death as a goal, Sandra no longer had a need for her martial arts mastery. Sensing she needed guidance, Dragon helped her to explore the spiritual side of martial arts. Ultimately deciding that she was Sandra no more she rechristened herself &quot;Shiva&quot;. She fought crime with Dragon and Ben Turner until the three parted ways. Turner, brainwashed by the villainous Sensei of the League of Assassins, became the renegade Bronze Tiger. Dragon decided to retire, devoting himself to teaching others. Lady Shiva became one of the world&#x27;s greatest assassins.
After the character&#x27;s title was canceled, Dragon became a supporting character in the 1980s series, &quot;The Question&quot;. The title character of that book, Vic Sage, was a masked crime-fighter based in Hub City, who came into conflict with Lady Shiva. After all but killing The Question, Shiva sent him to see Richard Dragon for training. Sage&#x27;s stubborn streak made him near impossible for most people to teach. However, when he met Dragon he found himself reluctant to challenge his new sensei because Dragon was in a wheelchair. Richard trained The Question both in martial arts and eastern philosophy, forcing him to question his world view and let go of much of his anger. Of note, he loosely quoted Zhuangzi&#x27;s story . Later Richard would start referring to his student as &quot;Butterfly&quot; because of this. Richard said that Shiva had saved Sage because she saw a passion for combat in him while Richard, on the other hand, thought that Sage&#x27;s passion was for curiosity. Regardless, Richard realized that for Sage to have a spiritual awakening he had to first let go of the self-destructive behaviors that Hub City brought out in him. Thus Richard sent Sage back home. As he left, Sage met Shiva again, and the two briefly sparred. She explained that this fight had been for her to test her own perceptions. She thought she had seen a &quot;warrior&#x27;s passion&quot; in him that was lacking skills, and felt that she had been proved correct since he faced her a second time knowing she had destroyed him the first. Shiva concluded that she had been right about him and Richard wrong, but Sage proposed that maybe he had just been &quot;curious&quot; what would happen if they fought again, which would make Richard right. Sage adopted the identity of The Question again, futilely trying to save the city.

Just as Sage&#x27;s doomed efforts to save Hub City threatened to destroy him, Dragon arrived to advise his student. Dragon finally convinced Sage that his crusade to save Hub City was no longer doing anything but destroying him. When Sage collapsed from exhaustion and his injuries, Richard revealed that he was capable of using his legs perfectly, and put Sage in the wheelchair. Dragon had realized he would need the chair to make Sage let down his defenses - Sage was so &quot;full of macho&quot; that he would never have listened to him otherwise.

The chair had not been just a charade, however. Richard revealed that he had &quot;allowed&quot; himself to be handicapped as part of his own learning process, going on to state &quot;I was a teacher then. I am about to become something else. So I discard that option&quot;. The city had truly degenerated by this point with all pretense of law and order long lost. Richard, who had thought his studies had put him beyond such things, found himself shocked and horrified by the actions of people in Hub City. For example, a man was using a dead baby to try and beg for &#x27;milk money&#x27;. When Richard and the others uncovered this, he tossed the body into a nearby trash can.

Dragon wordlessly met Lady Shiva, who had arrived on the outskirts of Hub City in the helicopter that was to take Sage and Dragon away - she wished to go toward and enjoy the chaos that Sage and Richard were rejecting. Shiva uses force and threats to ensure the pilot would do what she wishes.
Richard would next appear as sensei to Oracle, helping her to see past her own wheelchair-related limitations. Dragon spends months training her in escrima, the Philippine art of stick fighting, a martial art she could use despite her wheelchair.

Not long after that, the masked heroine Huntress became the main suspect in a series of murders. Realizing that her headstrong nature would likely mean her death this time, The Question saved her from her many pursuers (including the police and Batman), and took her to Richard Dragon. Seeing many similarities between her and The Question, Dragon helped teach the adventuress to control her anger and &quot;slow down&quot;.

After Huntress joined the Birds of Prey, Richard Dragon aided her in fighting the Twelve Brothers in Silk, an Asian martial arts squad that protected a major heroin distributor.

In 2004, the title was revived and the character revamped by Chuck Dixon and Scott McDaniel, only to be canceled after twelve issues. In this short series, Richard Dragon is a bullied school kid who enrolls in a karate dojo to better himself. The dojo&#x27;s instructor was a &quot;mail-order&quot; black belt, who is later defeated by the Bronze Tiger. The Bronze Tiger then agrees to train young Dragon. He eventually meets and falls in love with Lady Shiva. Although he wins the martial arts tournament she is watching, she chides him for not being able to live up to the powerful name of &quot;Dragon&quot;. Shiva becomes Dragon&#x27;s lover and instructor, and the series touches on their now strained relationship.

The series begins with the Tiger locating Dragon, who is seeking death by fighting in death matches. He agrees to help Dragon resolve his problems with Shiva if he agrees to stop killing. In tracking Shiva they are confronted by Nightwing and Connor Hawke. Nightwing alludes to Dragon training him, as Dragon trained Bruce Wayne, who passed that training on to Nightwing.

At the end of the series, Dragon and Shiva are pitted in combat. Dragon gains the upper hand in the fight, and as he begins to deliver his death blow, Shiva&#x27;s devout followers rush to save her, knocking Dragon away. Unhappy at this disturbance, Shiva attacks and possibly kills her followers before returning to kill Dragon with her signature move, the Leopard Claw. Dragon is, however, resurrected by the demonic Neron who wants Dragon to kill Shiva. Dragon refuses and walks away from Neron, saying that both had held up their parts of the agreement.

Richard Dragon appears starting in Week 26 of the comic book &quot;52&quot;, in the mystic city of Nanda Parbat, where he starts to train former Gotham Detective Renee Montoya. His appearance matches that of the Richard Dragon seen before the Dixon reboot (albeit with a full head of long hair, as when training Question and Oracle, rather than balding when training Huntress). In this story Dragon makes references to a conversation he had with The Question in the &quot;Question&quot; series, contradicting at least some of Chuck Dixon&#x27;s Richard Dragon series. The &quot;52&quot; series is also where Richard&#x27;s former student, Vic Sage, dies from cancer.

In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC universe. Richard Dragon was visited by Ricardo Diaz Jr. and trained him in martial arts. When Richard Dragon tried to teach him about peace, patience, and compassion, he was killed by Ricardo who saw weakness in him. To honor Richard, Ricardo adopted the &quot;Richard Dragon&quot; moniker for his own use.

===Ricardo Diaz Jr.===

A new version of Richard Dragon is introduced following DC&#x27;s &quot;The New 52&quot; 2011 continuity relaunch. A character identifying himself as Richard Dragon first appears in &quot;Green Arrow&quot; (vol. 5) #23 (2013). In &quot;Green Arrow&quot; (vol. 5) #31, he appears leading a team of Green Arrow&#x27;s enemies, referred to as the Longbow Hunters. In &quot;Green Arrow&quot; (vol. 5) #32 the character identifies himself as Ricardo Diaz Jr., the namesake son of a drug kingpin who had been killed by John Diggle (posing as Green Arrow). In addition, he also killed the original Richard Dragon and took his moniker for his own use. He revealed that after his father&#x27;s death and the fall of his criminal empire, he sought out and found the League of Assassins where his sensei taught him to become a living weapon. He claims that when his sensei also taught him patience and compassion, which he perceived to be a weakness, he killed his sensei and took his name. Diaz/Dragon places a 30-million-dollar bounty on Green Arrow, which three members of the Longbow Hunters (Brick, Killer Moth, and Red Dart) intend to split. Green Arrow is able to defeat all of them with the help of his young half-sister, Emiko. Green Arrow is then reunited with his old partner, John Diggle, after Dragon attempts to kill Diggle by defenestration. In a fight against both Arrow and Diggle, Dragon is able to significantly injure both of them, but is ultimately defeated.

== Characterization ==

=== Students of Richard Dragon ===
Several characters have undergone training with Richard Dragon: The Question, Huntress, Oracle, Renee Montoya, and Lady Shiva. He&#x27;s also trained Dick Grayson, Batman, and Connor Hawke although they appeared in the 2004 series. Given that the version of Richard Dragon seen in 52 appeared to be the version seen prior to the 2004 retcon, the canonical nature of these students is unclear.

In the New 52, the Green Arrow villain who takes the name Richard Dragon (Ricardo Diaz, Jr.) is revealed to have killed the original man by that name, who had been his sensei, explaining the original Richard Dragon&#x27;s absence from the New 52.

==Skills and abilities==

=== Richard Drakunovski ===
The first incarnation of Richard Dragon is not endowed with inherent superhuman abilities, but rather his mastery of martial arts allows him to create the illusion of possessing such capabilities. With expertise in both armed combat and unarmed techniques, Dragon is skilled in various conventional weapons but primarily relies on his unarmed skills. He has achieved mastery in all known hand-to-hand martial arts disciplines, which encompass styles such as Aikido, Muay Thai, Karate, Kung Fu, Judo, Pencak Silat, Taekwondo, Escrima, and Jeet Kune Do. His proficiency in these diverse martial arts forms is well-documented. In addition to his combat prowess, Richard Dragon is a learned philosopher, particularly in matters pertaining to leading a heroic life. He has provided guidance to notable individuals such as the Huntress and Wonder Woman, offering insights into the correct paths they should follow.

Richard Dragon possesses a mystical artifact called the Dragon&#x27;s Claw, which is a talisman of significance. While it is believed to possess mystical properties, it is widely speculated that the totem primarily serves as a focal point for Dragon&#x27;s concentration and does not inherently possess its own supernatural powers. During moments of intense adversity, the Dragon&#x27;s Claw enables Dragon to channel and direct his own qi (life energy) in a focused manner, aiding him in challenging situations.

=== Richard Diaz, Jr. ===
Similar to his predecessor, the second Richard Dragon does not possess any superhuman abilities. However, he is a highly skilled martial artist who received comprehensive training from his mentor in all aspects of martial arts. Diaz&#x27;s fighting style diverges from that of his teacher, as he possesses the ability to analyze and exploit the weaknesses of his opponents. He has a keen eye for assessing an individual&#x27;s physical attributes such as height, weight, and other characteristics. This perceptiveness allows him to accurately predict the movements and attacks of his adversaries, showcasing his prowess as a strategic and tactical mastermind. Diaz&#x27;s aptitude for developing and recognizing complex combat strategies makes him an imposing figure as a crime lord. Additionally, he possesses remarkable reflexes, as demonstrated by his ability to catch trick arrows fired by Green Arrow.

==Other versions==
=== Richard Dragon Jr. ===
Richard Dragon Jr. debuted in &quot;Robin&quot; #1 (2021). Created by Joshua Williamson and Gleb Melnikov, the character is implied to be the son of the original Richard Dragon, Richard Drakunvonski. He participates in the League of Lazarus before Talia al Ghul offers him membership in the League of Shadows.

==In other media==
===Television===

Ricardo &quot;Dragon&quot; Diaz appears in media set in the Arrowverse, portrayed by Kirk Acevedo as an adult and Max Archibald as a young man.
* Primarily appearing in &quot;Arrow&quot;, this version is an arsonist, crime lord, and drug dealer with dragon tattoos on his neck and left shoulder. In the sixth season, he manipulates Cayden James into helping him take control of Star City before Oliver Queen exposes and captures everyone on Diaz&#x27;s payroll, forcing him to go into hiding. In the seventh season, Diaz seeks revenge by targeting Queen and his family, hiring the Longbow Hunters to assist him and taking a drug that grants super-strength, but is captured by Emiko Queen and Team Arrow. Incarcerated at Slabside Maximum Security Prison, Diaz is recruited into A.R.G.U.S.&#x27;s Ghost Initiative to help them locate Ninth Circle financier Dante, through whom Diaz hired the Longbow Hunters, though Diaz betrays them to help Dante escape. He is subsequently returned to Slabside, where Emiko kills him to prevent him from revealing information on the Ninth Circle.
* An alternate version of Diaz who became a police officer after John Deegan rewrote reality makes a cameo appearance in the crossover &quot;Elseworlds&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, the th Motzkin number is the number of different ways of drawing non-intersecting chords between points on a circle (not necessarily touching every point by a chord). The Motzkin numbers are named after Theodore Motzkin and have diverse applications in geometry, combinatorics and number theory.

The Motzkin numbers formula_1 for formula_2 form the sequence:

: 1, 1, 2, 4, 9, 21, 51, 127, 323, 835, ... 

== Examples ==

The following figure shows the 9 ways to draw non-intersecting chords between 4 points on a circle ():

The following figure shows the 21 ways to draw non-intersecting chords between 5 points on a circle ():

== Properties ==

The Motzkin numbers satisfy the recurrence relations

:formula_3

The Motzkin numbers can be expressed in terms of binomial coefficients and Catalan numbers:

:formula_4

and inversely,

:formula_5

This gives

:formula_6

The generating function formula_7 of the Motzkin numbers satisfies
:formula_8
and is explicitly expressed as
:formula_9

An integral representation of Motzkin numbers is given by
:formula_10.

They have the asymptotic behaviour
:formula_11.

A Motzkin prime is a Motzkin number that is prime. Four such primes are known:

: 2, 127, 15511, 953467954114363 

== Combinatorial interpretations ==

The Motzkin number for is also the number of positive integer sequences of length in which the opening and ending elements are either 1 or 2, and the difference between any two consecutive elements is −1, 0 or 1. Equivalently, the Motzkin number for is the number of positive integer sequences of length in which the opening and ending elements are 1, and the difference between any two consecutive elements is −1, 0 or 1.

Also, the Motzkin number for gives the number of routes on the upper right quadrant of a grid from coordinate (0, 0) to coordinate (, 0) in steps if one is allowed to move only to the right (up, down or straight) at each step but forbidden from dipping below the = 0 axis.

For example, the following figure shows the 9 valid Motzkin paths from (0, 0) to (4, 0):

There are at least fourteen different manifestations of Motzkin numbers in different branches of mathematics, as enumerated by in their survey of Motzkin numbers.
 showed that vexillary involutions are enumerated by Motzkin numbers.

<text>Bosco/Gurin (, Walser German: &quot;Gurin&quot; / &quot;Guryn&quot;, Lombard: &quot;Bosch&quot; / &quot;Gürin&quot;) is a municipality in the district of Vallemaggia in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. The village is near the end of the valley of Bosco Gurin, near the Italian border. Despite the overall prominence of Italian in Ticino, the small municipality of Bosco/Gurin is historically German-speaking.

==History==

Bosco/Gurin is first mentioned in 1244 as &quot;als Buscho de Quarinobis&quot;. Until 1934, it was known as Bosco-Vallemaggia, and in German as Gurin.

The village was started during Walser migration in the 13th century, with the first settlers arriving in 1244. 
Today the Walser German dialect is being abandoned in favour of the Italian language, and Italian speakers make up the majority in the village. Bosco/Gurin is the only municipality in Ticino where German is a co-official language.

The Walser emigrated from the Val Formazza Walser around 1240 at the request of the Lombardy rulers and the &quot;Capitanei&quot; of Locarno who needed a band of mercenaries. In 1244, a noble family from Locarno and the villagers of Losone leased from the pastures around the village. Later these pastures passed fully into their possession. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the Walser colony survived almost totally isolated. The rare contacts with the outside world were more with the Val Formazza or Valais than from the rest of Ticino. The geographic isolation strengthened the independent living habits and traditions of the village. The town was frequently buried by avalanches.

The parish church of St. James and St. Christopher was consecrated in 1253, probably at the same time that the village separated from the parish of Cevio. It was expanded and rebuilt in the 15th and 16th centuries. The chapel of Madonna della Neve is from the early 18th century.

The area was briefly part of the Canton of Lugano, before the canton was unified with Bellinzona to form Ticino.

Up until the 20th century, the village was almost completely isolated. By 1914, there were seasonal migration (especially by masons) into the German-speaking Switzerland. Livestock and farming (potatoes, rye, hemp) have been the main sources of income over the centuries. During the winter months, villagers made timber vessels, spin linen, hemp and wool, and embroider handkerchiefs.
In the 20th century, much of the population emigrated. In 1936, the local museum was opened. By 2004, there were only 72 inhabitants left, from a peak of 382 in 1850.

A custom in Bosco/Gurin (found also in the Avers valley, Graubünden) was to build houses with a &quot;Seelabalga&quot; (&quot;soul-beam&quot;). This was a sliding wooden door covering a small round hole through the wall, which was opened to allow the soul of a deceased inhabitant to depart.

==Geography==

Bosco is located in the Vallemaggia district, and the highest municipality in Ticino at an elevation of .

Bosco/Gurin has an area, , of . Of this area, or 3.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 27.9% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 0.9% is settled (buildings or roads), or 1.3% is either rivers or lakes and or 42.1% is unproductive land.

Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 0.2% and transportation infrastructure made up 0.6%. Out of the forested land, 11.6% of the total land area is heavily forested, while 12.0% is covered in small trees and shrubbery and 4.3% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 2.9% is used for growing crops. All the water in the municipality is flowing water. Of the unproductive areas, 22.3% is unproductive vegetation and 19.7% is too rocky for vegetation.

<text>The Bald River is a river located in Monroe County, Tennessee in the Cherokee National Forest. It is a tributary of the Tellico River. Just before it empties into the Tellico, the river falls over a large waterfall, Bald River Falls, which is variously reported as being between 80 and 100 feet (25 and 30 m) high. The river then flows under a bridge on Forest Service Road 210 (the falls and the river mouth are both very readily visible from the bridge). The falls is regarded as one of the most impressive and scenic waterfall in East Tennessee. The river is short in length but powerful as it flows through a steep, densely wooded valley and it is constantly replenished by the area&#x27;s frequent rains. It rises just north of the North Carolina state line near the crest of the Unicoi Mountains and flows northeast for a short distance before turning to the northwest.

The forests of the Bald River basin and the Tellico River basin were almost completely logged by the Babcock Lumber Company during the early 20th century, from their local base of operation at Tellico Plains. The present road up the Tellico River was built on the old logging railroad bed built by Babcock.

==Wilderness== 
The Upper Bald River Wilderness was designated as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System in 2018 by the U.S. Congress. Along with the Bald River Gorge Wilderness to the north, most of the Bald River watershed is protected as a wilderness area and managed by the Cherokee National Forest.

The forest&#x27;s fast-flowing rivers support trout fishing. Rainbow trout are stocked in many streams and rivers. Brook trout and brown trout are also present. Bass, bluegill and crappie are found in the forest&#x27;s lakes, which are also open to wind surfing, water skiing and boating.

Trails criss-cross the forest. In addition to the Appalachian Trail, these include the John Muir Recreation trail, other hiking trails, and some trails designed for equestrian use. Bicycle trails are being developed. Camping is available in RV campgrounds and tent-only camping areas, and primitive tent camping is allowed throughout much of the forest.

==Wilderness areas==
There are eleven official wilderness areas in Cherokee National Forest, which are all part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Three of these extend into neighboring National Forests (and also into neighboring states, where the forest changes names): 
*Bald River Gorge Wilderness
*Big Frog Wilderness (Cherokee NF in Tennessee and Chattahoochee NF in Georgia)
*Big Laurel Branch Wilderness
*Citico Creek Wilderness
*Cohutta Wilderness (Chattahoochee NF in Georgia and Cherokee NF in Tennessee)
*Gee Creek Wilderness
*Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness (Nantahala NF in North Carolina and Cherokee NF in Tennessee)
*Little Frog Mountain Wilderness
*Pond Mountain Wilderness
*Sampson Mountain Wilderness
*Unaka Mountain Wilderness

<doc id="853155" wikidata="Q7798900" url="?curid=853155" title="Thunder (DC Comics)">
<text>Thunder is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by writer Judd Winick and artist Tom Raney in the Modern Age of Comic Books. She is first mentioned in &quot;Green Arrow&quot; (vol. 2) #26 (July 2003) and first appears a month later in &quot;Outsiders&quot; (vol. 3) #1. Born Anissa Pierce, she is a metahuman and daughter of superhero Black Lightning, able to increase her physical density and durability and create massive shockwaves.

Pierce is also the older sister of Jennifer, herself a superhero operating under the alias Lightning. Against her parents&#x27; wishes, Anissa chooses to utilize her abilities to fight crime. She is invited and accepts a position with the superhero team the Outsiders. Pierce is involved in a relationship with her teammate Grace Choi.

Along with her presence in various comic books Thunder has made appearances on a number of television shows and appeared in the live action Arrowverse series &quot;Black Lightning&quot;, portrayed by Nafessa Williams.

==Fictional character biography==
===Daughter of Black Lightning===
Although it is not clear but one assumes she got her powers genetically from her father who is also a metahuman. Her father Jefferson Pierce (Black Lightning) and her mother Lynn Stewart did not want her following in his footsteps, and he struck a bargain with her: she would graduate from college before considering a career in crimefighting. She did, and the same night of her graduation she donned a costume and became Thunder. She is also the older sister of Lightning.

===Outsiders===

Shortly after Thunder had started her solo career, she was approached by Arsenal, who offered her a spot on the new team of Outsiders. Reasoning that she could best learn the superhero trade with a team, she agreed to this offer and became an Outsider. Although she got along with most of her teammates, she seemed to come into conflict with Grace, a tough promiscuous bouncer, constantly. They were however quite effective as a team, and the two slowly came to a grudging respect between them; later on they became lovers.

Eventually her father appeared at the Outsiders headquarters, demanding her resignation from the team. Naturally, she refused and when the danger of Sabbac arose again, her father even decided to accompany the Outsiders. During that adventure, the two came to respect each other&#x27;s abilities, neither having seen the other in action before, and Thunder was allowed to remain an Outsider.

The extent of her invulnerability was tested during a fight with the re-formed Fearsome Five. The matter transmuter Shimmer converted the air in her lungs to water, which caused an inflammation so great that she had pulmonary edema and Acute respiratory distress syndrome, which nearly killed her. She recovered and continued to serve with the Outsiders.

===&quot;One Year Later&quot;===

OYL, Anissa remains a member of the Outsiders (a team that was currently believed to be dead), and has been involved in the attempted toppling of the regime of Mali. Her role has been instrumental in the mission, having gone undercover amongst the government, a role that has required her to pretend she was having a sexual relationship with the country&#x27;s ruler Ratun Bennin; in actuality Metamorpho used a hallucinogenic compound to fool the dictator. She compromised the team&#x27;s mission when she revealed her cover and attacked Mali&#x27;s army, who were going to slaughter a village.

It was revealed that Thunder has been in a romantic relationship with her teammate Grace, making her one of a handful of LGBT people of color in the DC roster. Thunder was recently kicked off The Outsiders upon Batman&#x27;s reorganization of the team, being replaced by the Martian Manhunter. She rejoined the team, when Grace invited her on a mission, without Batman&#x27;s approval.

During the &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; events an assembly of the Outsiders, including Anissa, receives a message from the missing Batman, asking them to feed a secret code in the cybernetic mind of the ReMAC, allowing him to track the Caped Crusader and the Black Glove and help him into his fight. As they reluctantly comply, due to Batgirl, the code reveals itself as a cybernetic boobytrap set by Doctor Hurt, the mastermind behind Batman&#x27;s downfall, and ReMAC explodes. Several Outsiders are wounded, and Anissa sustains brain injuries severe enough to knock her in a seemingly irreversible coma. However her in-costume appearance in the &quot;Final Crisis: Submit&quot; story suggest she recovered afterwards, as the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; storyline occurs after the events in &quot;R.I.P.&quot;, though Thunder is still shown in a coma during the &quot;Batman and the Outsiders Special&quot;, where her father ultimately joins up with a new roster of Outsiders to take her place.

Thunder eventually reappears many months later, now living with Grace in a state of semi-retirement. The inconsistencies regarding her coma are briefly touched upon when it is explained that Anissa had been &quot;in and out of hospitals&quot; for a prolonged period after her initial injuries. Following a botched mission, Black Lightning arrives at Anissa and Grace&#x27;s apartment with several other fugitive members of the new Outsiders, telling Anissa that he simply wishes to see his children again after spending months without any contact with his family. He briefly expresses discomfort over his daughter&#x27;s sexual orientation, but Anissa tells him off by stating that Grace was there for her when he wasn&#x27;t. When the Justice Society of America attacks the apartment to bring the Outsiders into custody, Anissa chooses to side with her father and fight off the attacking heroes, which ultimately leads to a confrontation with her younger sister, Lightning, whom she claims was always thought of as the &quot;favorite&quot;. After the fight is broken up by Doctor Fate, Anissa and Grace choose to rejoin the Outsiders on a mission to Markovia, where Amanda Waller tasked them with capturing Geo-Force.

==Powers and abilities==
Thunder has the ability to increase her body&#x27;s mass while preserving volume, which effectively increases her density. In this state she is near-immovable, almost completely invulnerable. A mob enforcer once suffered a compound fracture after trying to punch Thunder in the face. Notably, she can make her skin strong enough to withstand bullets. Just by stomping the ground she can create massive shockwaves.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Kingdom Come&quot;===
In an alternate universe depicted in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, a young boy who inherited his father&#x27;s powers and became the new owner of Thunderbolt operates as Thunder.

<doc id="853157" wikidata="Q1423789" url="?curid=853157" title="Tecmo">
<text>was a Japanese video game corporation founded in 1967. It had its headquarters in the Kudankita district of Tokyo. Its subsidiary, Tecmo Inc, was located in Torrance, California. Prior to 1986, Tecmo was formerly known as Tehkan.

Tecmo is known for the &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot;, &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, &quot;Deception&quot;, &quot;Fatal Frame&quot;, &quot;Gallop Racer&quot;, &quot;Monster Rancher&quot;, &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, &quot;Rygar&quot;, &quot;Star Force&quot; and &quot;Tecmo Bowl&quot; video game series. When it was still called Tehkan, the company released arcade games such as &quot;Bomb Jack&quot;, &quot;Gridiron Fight&quot; and &quot;Tehkan World Cup&quot;.

In 2009, Tecmo merged with Koei to form the holding company Tecmo Koei Holdings and was operated as a subsidiary until April 2010 when Tecmo was dissolved. Its brand continued to be used until 2016. Its video game franchises are now owned and published by Koei Tecmo Games.

==History==
The company was founded on July 31, 1967, as a supplier of cleaning equipment. By 1969, it started to sell amusement equipment.

===Early history===
Tecmo Ltd., which merged with Koei in 2009, was itself the combination of two companies: Imperial Trustee Corporation (founded in 1964) and Nippon Yacht Co, Ltd (founded in 1967).

==== Imperial Trustee Corporation====
The origins of Tecmo dates to September 1964 as the Imperial Trustee Corporation, a company specialized in the management of building maintenance including the supplying of cleaning equipment. In July 1969, the company started to sell entertainment amusement equipment and opened its first self-managed amusement facility in March 1970 in Chiba Prefecture.

In October 1977, the Imperial Trustee Corporation was renamed &quot;Tehkan Ltd&quot;, with the trade name changed as well to &quot;Tehkan&quot;. Tehkan is derived from the name , the company&#x27;s original Japanese name.

In March 1981, a U.S. division was inaugurated in Los Angeles as &quot;U.S. Tehkan, Inc.&quot;. A month later, in April 1981, Tehkan released in Japan its first internally developed arcade video game, titled &quot;Pleiads&quot; (which was distributed in America by Centuri).

On January 8, 1986, Tehkan Ltd officially changed its name to Tecmo Ltd. The company&#x27;s first internally developed home video game &quot;Mighty Bomb Jack&quot; was released for the Family Computer in April 1986.

==== Nippon Yacht Co, Ltd====
On July 31, 1967, the Nippon Yacht Corporation was established to handle the real estate of ships.

On December 6, 1982, Nippon Yacht Co, Ltd was renamed &quot;Tehkan Electronics Corporation&quot;.

===Merger of Tecmo and Tehkan Electronics Corporation. Focus on console video games===
On April 1, 1987, Tecmo Ltd. merged with its sister company Tehkan Electronics Corporation. The former&#x27;s name was retained for the merger but the latter was the actual surviving company.

By the turn of the decade, Tecmo was firmly in the camp of video game consoles. Though still involved in the arcade industry, much of the success was achieved on the Nintendo Entertainment System with titles such as &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, &quot;Tecmo Bowl&quot; and the Japan-only &quot;Tsuppari Ōzumō&quot;. When Sony released its PlayStation in the 1990s, Tecmo joined the endeavor which set the tone for series such as &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, &quot;Monster Rancher&quot;, &quot;Deception&quot; and &quot;Gallop Racer&quot;.

Tecmo enters the second section of Tokyo Stock Exchange in March 2000 and transitioned to the first section in March 2001.

On October 1, 2001, Tecmo founder, Yoshihito Kakihara, steps down as president and representative director due to health issues. Kakihara becomes chairman and representative director while vice president, Junji Nakamura, becomes president and representative director. By 2002, Tecmo stopped producing new arcade games.

On January 1, 2006, Tecmo president, Junji Nakamura, steps down while Yoshimi Yasuda was named his successor. Nakamura becomes chairman of Tecmo until his resignation from the company on February 1, 2006.

On July 18, 2006, Tecmo&#x27;s founder, Yoshihito Kakihara, died of interstitial pneumonia at the age of 67.

Tecmo delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange on March 26, 2009, right before the merger with Koei took effect.

===Lawsuits===
On February 14, 2007, former president, Junji Nakamura, filed a lawsuit against Tecmo demanding payment of 166 million yen in executive retirement benefits. A settlement in the matter was reached on March 28.

On June 3, 2008, Team Ninja head Tomonobu Itagaki resigned from the company and filed a 145 million yen ($1.4 million) lawsuit against Tecmo president, Yoshimi Yasuda, for &quot;unpaid completion bonuses&quot; and &quot;emotional distress&quot;. This was followed by another lawsuit filed on the 16th of June by two plaintiffs on behalf of Tecmo&#x27;s 300 employees for unpaid wages amounting to ¥8.3 million.

===Merger with Koei===
On August 29, 2008 Square Enix made plans for a friendly takeover of Tecmo by purchasing shares at a 30 percent premium with a total bid of ¥22.3 billion. On September 4, 2008, Tecmo officially declined the takeover proposal. Tecmo subsequently engaged in talks with Koei about a possible merger between the two companies, and agreed in November 2008 to merge on April 1, 2009, to form Tecmo Koei Holdings.

On January 26, 2009, the two companies officially announced the merger, and the holding company formed on April 1, 2009, as planned. Tecmo initially continued to be operated as a subsidiary and brandname of Tecmo Koei Holdings. In January 2010, the United States subsidiaries of Tecmo Inc. and Koei America merged to create Tecmo Koei America Corporation.

Tecmo was effectively declared disbanded in Japan on April 1, 2010, as part of a major international reorganization within Tecmo Koei Holdings. Relevant intellectual properties were slated to be further managed by Koei Tecmo Games.

On March 15, 2010, and roughly two weeks before Tecmo was dissolved, its internal development studio was spun off as a separate company under the name of &quot;Tecmo Co, Ltd.&quot;, a wholly owned subsidiary of Koei Tecmo Games. This new company was initially called &quot;Tehkan&quot; to avoid confusion with the other company that was still operating for another two weeks. When Tecmo disbanded on April 1, 2010, Tekhan was renamed Tecmo. This was short-lived as the new Tecmo along with the new Koei video game developers were both dissolved and merged into Koei Tecmo Games a year later, on April 1, 2011.

Despite having been dissolved twice as a legal entity, Tecmo continued to appear as a label on video games by Koei Tecmo Games until another corporate reorganization in 2016 abandoned the brand name for good. Video games by Koei Tecmo Games marketed with the Tecmo logotype included &quot;Dead or Alive 5&quot;, &quot;Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; and &quot;Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess&quot;.

<doc id="853158" wikidata="Q2220814" url="?curid=853158" title="Sandia Peak Tramway">
<text>The Sandia Peak Tramway is an aerial tramway, adjacent to Albuquerque, New Mexico, in the United States. It stretches from the northeast edge of the city to Sandia Peak, on the ridge line of the Sandia Mountains and has the world&#x27;s third longest single span. It is the longest aerial tram in the Americas, and was the longest in the world from 1966 until being surpassed in 2010 by the Wings of Tatev in Armenia.

==History==

The Sandia Peak Ski Company was founded by Ben Abruzzo (a balloonist) and Robert Nordhaus (the father of William Nordhaus, a Nobel Prize–winning economist). Nordhaus was inspired to build a tram to the ski slope after seeing other trams during a ski trip to Switzerland. Bell Engineering, of Lucerne, Switzerland, built the tramway. The project took over 5,000 helicopter trips, airlifting workers and materials. The tram cars pass over two towers, the second of which required over 2,000 helicopter trips to build. The tramway has carried more than 12 million passengers since its maiden voyage, on May 7, 1966. New tram cars were installed in 1986, and new track cables in 2009. New tram cars were again installed in May 2016.

===New Year 2022 incident===
On New Year&#x27;s Eve, 2021, a winter storm caused the emergency cable to ice over and droop onto the track cables, causing the tramway to stop mid-course. Nineteen employees from TEN 3, the restaurant at the top terminal, and a Sandia Peak tram-cabin operator were aboard the downhill tram car evacuating the restaurant for the approaching storm, and were trapped for over 17 hours. A cabin operator was stranded in the uphill tram car. Despite wind and snow, all were rescued, without injury, on the afternoon of January 1, 2022. Members of the Albuquerque Mountain Rescue Council helped the passengers rappel down the upper tower and hike to a point where they could be rescued by a Bernalillo County Sheriff&#x27;s Office helicopter.

==Description==

The tram is a type known as a &quot;double reversible jigback aerial tramway,&quot; where &quot;jigback&quot; implies that when one tram car is ascending, the other is descending. Its two cars are capable of carrying 50 passengers each and have numerous safety and backup systems, such as multiple emergency braking systems and a grounding system that ensures the safety of passengers in the event of a lightning strike. The tramway ascends the steep western side of the highest portion of the Sandia Mountains, from a base elevation of to a top elevation of . A trip up the mountain takes 15 minutes to ascend , and the normal operating speed of the tram is . Approximately four &quot;flights&quot; leave every hour from the base and top termini. The viewshed from the tram includes all of Albuquerque and roughly of the New Mexico countryside.
The tramway has only two support towers. The first tower, which is tall, is situated at an elevation of above sea level and built as an inclined tower with an inclination angle of 18 degrees. The second, just tall, is situated at the end of a major spur of the mountains at an elevation of and was built by the aid of over 2,000 helicopter trips, with support rods driven up to into the granite.

The longest span is between the second tower and the top terminal. This span is the third-longest clear tramway span in the world, at a length of . Mid-span, the cables are above the mountainside. This span passes over Domingo Baca Canyon, part of which is referred to as TWA Canyon. This is the site of the crash of TWA Flight 260 on February 19, 1955, in which the lives of all 16 passengers and crew were lost. While much of the wreckage was removed during construction of the tramway, some still remains on the canyon floor and may be visible to riders of the tram.

==Activities on top==

At the top of Sandia Peak there are many year-round recreational options. The restaurant, TEN 3 (stylized as 10|3), is directly adjacent to the top tram terminal and offers scenic views to the west. Many Forest Service trails offer recreational hiking, backpacking and nature hikes to visitors. Additionally, the tram terminal is located at the top of Sandia Peak Ski Area, which is on the opposite side of the mountain from the tramway and the city. Skiing is available in the wintertime, and during the summer more than of mountain biking trails are available. Bikes cannot be taken onto tram cars. There is no public transportation in this area of Albuquerque; the tram is accessible only by car, bicycle, or foot.

<text>Exhibition railway station is located on the Exhibition line in Queensland, Australia. It serves the Brisbane Exhibition Ground in Bowen Hills and is normally only opened during the Ekka show each August.

Previously an extra ticket surcharge had to be paid to travel to the station. In 2009, Translink CEO Peter Strachan blamed the surcharge on the Royal National Agricultural &amp; Industrial Association not willing to pick up the cost of running the station. The surcharge was removed in 2012.

Because of the requirements of the Show, the station is equipped with facilities for dealing with livestock. The line passing through the station is regularly used by trains traveling between Roma Street station and Mayne depot.

==Cross River Rail==
Construction of the Cross River Rail project will see Exhibition Station upgraded for year-round operation and the development of a precinct between the station and the nearby RBWH. The island platform will run for 165 metres in length, allowing it to provide for up to nine-car trains. A viaduct was built to allow for rail passage over the showgrounds.

The tunnel portal for the Cross River Rail line will be located south of the Exhibition Station and the next station for southbound Cross River Rail services will be the underground Cross River Rail platforms at Roma Street.

<text>The Tellico River is a river in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. It rises in the westernmost mountains of North Carolina, and then flows through Monroe County, Tennessee, before joining the Little Tennessee River under the Tellico Reservoir. With a length of , it is a major tributary of the Little Tennessee River, and is one of the primary streams draining the Unicoi Mountains.

The Tellico River and its main tributaries are renowned for their brook, brown, and rainbow trout fishing. Upstream from Tellico Lake, above Tellico Plains, Tennessee, the Tellico is a premier trout stream. It meanders through a mountain gorge before reaching the broad plains downstream of Tellico Plains.

==Hydrography==
The Tellico River rises in the Unicoi Mountains (a subrange of the Blue Ridge Mountains) near the Cherokee County/Graham County line, in North Carolina&#x27;s Nantahala National Forest. The North Carolina side includes the Upper Tellico Off-highway vehicle area.

After the river crosses into Tennessee and enters the Cherokee National Forest, it is joined by its major tributaries, the Bald and North rivers. After exiting the mountains, the river enters Tellico Plains, a relatively flat and isolated area carved out by the river and several tributaries, namely Morgan Creek and Smoky Run. A stretch of the river above Tellico Plains runs parallel to the Cherohala Skyway.

Beyond Tellico Plains, the river winds its way northward through rural Monroe County, Tennessee, before entering the slack waters of Tellico Lake. This lower section of the river absorbs several major streams, including Ballplay Creek and Notchy Creek. These names are from Henry Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;Draught of the Cherokee Country&quot;, from his 1761-1762 Timberlake Expedition to the Overhill Cherokee. Fort Loudoun, a reconstructed 18th-century British fort that is now the focus of a state park, was built on an island at the Tellico River&#x27;s confluence with the Little Tennessee River. In 1760 the Cherokee laid siege to the fort and defeated the garrison, in an effort to expel the British from their territory, but were later forced out themselves in the 19th century.

==History==

The Tellico River was a central part of the traditional homelands of the Cherokee people, who occupied territory in what are now organized as South Carolina, northwestern North Carolina, southeastern Tennessee, and northeastern Georgia. The Overhill Cherokee occupied towns on the west side of the Appalachian Mountains, along the lower Little Tennessee River and upper Tennessee River. The numerous Cherokee towns in this area were recorded by British colonist Henry Timberlake during his 1761-1762 Expedition to the Overhill region. He created a highly detailed map, &quot;Draught of the Cherokee Country&quot; (see on this page), and a memoir recording many details of the chiefs and the populations of the towns.

After continuing conflicts during the American Revolutionary War, the United States moved to enforce Indian Removal of most of the Cherokee and other Southeast tribes by the late 1830s to Indian Territory, west of the Mississippi River. European Americans settled in much of the area, initially cultivating it for agriculture.

In the early 20th century, the Tellico River basin was logged by the Babcock Lumber Company. The present-day road along the Tellico River from Tellico Plains was built on the old Babcock logging railroad bed. After cutting most of the standing Tellico River basin forests, Babock sold the land to the United States Forest Service.

===21st century uses===

The Tellico River&#x27;s rocky descent provides class III-IV whitewater recreation. The runs are especially popular during the spring because of higher water levels. The narrow extreme rapids on the Tellico River are well suited for kayaks, canoes, C1s and duckies, but not for larger rafts (although rafts can and do run the section from just above Baby Falls to the bridge below Jared&#x27;s Knee, but usually in late winter/early spring or during periods of very high water; Baby Falls was first ran by a raft in the early 1990s).

While there is continuous access to the river from the road, these runs are popular: 
* Trout Hatchery to Bridge above the Bald River confluence, class II-III
* The Ledges - from the Bridge above the Bald River confluence to bridge below Jared&#x27;s Knee, class III-IV
* Bridge below Jared&#x27;s Knee to Ranger Station, class II-III
* Ranger Station to Tellico Plains, class I-III

==Etymology==
According to the United States Geological Survey, variant names of the Tellico River include Delaquay River, Talequo River, Terrique River, and Tellequo River. The latter spelling was used by Henry Timberlake on his map, &quot;Draught of the Cherokee Country&quot;, based on his 1761-1762 Timberlake Expedition to the Overhill Cherokee.

The word &quot;Tellico&quot; was the name of several Cherokee towns, the largest of which was Great Tellico, located on the Tellico River near what developed as present-day Tellico Plains, Tennessee. In Cherokee the word is more properly written &quot;Talikwa&quot;. According to James Mooney, the meaning of the word was lost.

<doc id="853163" wikidata="Q631153" url="?curid=853163" title="Transformer (Lou Reed album)">
<text>Transformer is the second solo studio album by American recording artist Lou Reed. Produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, the album was released on November 8, 1972 by RCA Records. It is considered an influential landmark of the glam rock genre, anchored by Reed&#x27;s most successful single, &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;, which touched on controversial topics of sexual orientation, gender identity, prostitution, and drug use. Although Reed&#x27;s self-titled debut solo album had been unsuccessful, Bowie had been an early fan of Reed&#x27;s former band the Velvet Underground and used his fame to promote Reed, who had not yet achieved mainstream success.

==Background==
As with its predecessor &quot;Lou Reed&quot;, &quot;Transformer&quot; contains songs Reed composed while in the Velvet Underground (here, four out of eleven). &quot;Andy&#x27;s Chest&quot; was first recorded by the band in 1969 and &quot;Satellite of Love&quot; demoed in 1970; these versions were released on &quot;VU&quot; and &quot;Peel Slowly and See,&quot; respectively. For &quot;Transformer,&quot; the original up-tempo pace of these songs was slowed down.

&quot;New York Telephone Conversation&quot; and &quot;Goodnight Ladies&quot; were played live during the band&#x27;s summer 1970 residency at Max&#x27;s Kansas City; the latter takes its title refrain from the last line of the second section (&quot;A Game of Chess&quot;) of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s modernist poem, &quot;The Waste Land&quot;: &quot;Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night&quot;, which is itself a quote from Ophelia in &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

As in Reed&#x27;s Velvet Underground days, the connection to artist Andy Warhol remained strong. According to Reed, Warhol told him he should write a song about someone vicious. When Reed asked what he meant by vicious, Warhol replied, &quot;Oh, you know, like I hit you with a flower&quot;, resulting in the song &quot;Vicious&quot;. Reed wrote in his book, &quot;Between Thought and Expression&quot;, about his single &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;: &quot;They were going to make a musical out of Nelson Algren&#x27;s book &quot;A Walk on the Wild Side&quot;. When they dropped the project I took my song and changed the book&#x27;s characters into people I knew from Warhol&#x27;s factory. I don’t like to waste things.&quot;

==Production==
&quot;Transformer&quot; was produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, both of whom had been strongly influenced by Reed&#x27;s work with the Velvet Underground. Bowie had obliquely referenced the Velvet Underground in the cover notes for his album &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; and regularly performed both &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Man&quot; in concerts and on the BBC during 1971–1973. He even began recording &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; for inclusion on &quot;Pin Ups&quot;, but it was never completed; Ronson ended up using the backing track for his solo album &quot;Play Don&#x27;t Worry&quot; in 1974.

Mick Ronson (who was at the time the lead guitarist with Bowie&#x27;s band, the Spiders from Mars) played a major role in the recording of the album at Trident Studios, London, serving as the co-producer and primary session musician (contributing guitar, piano, recorder and backing vocals), as well as arranger, contributing the string arrangement for &quot;Perfect Day&quot;. Reed lauded Ronson&#x27;s contribution in the &quot;Transformer&quot; episode of the documentary series &quot;Classic Albums&quot;, praising the beauty of his work and keeping down the vocal to highlight the strings. The songs on the album are now among Reed&#x27;s best-known works, including &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;, &quot;Perfect Day&quot; and &quot;Satellite of Love&quot;, and the album&#x27;s commercial success elevated him from cult status to become an international star.

==Artwork==

The cover art was from a Mick Rock photograph that inadvertently became over-exposed as he was printing it in the darkroom. Rock noticed the flaw but decided he liked the fortuitous effect enough to submit the image for the album cover.

According to Rock, &quot;When I showed Lou the contact sheets, he zeroed in on the transformer shot. I made the print myself – as I usually did in those days. The first test I made fell out of focus in the exposure. Lou loved the result. It took me twelve attempts to reproduce this accident for the final larger print for the album cover&quot;.

Karl Stoecker (who also shot the first three Roxy Music album covers) took the back cover photo of a woman and a man. The woman is 1960s London supermodel Gala Mitchell. The man is portrayed by Ernie Thormahlen (a friend of Reed). The man appears to have a noticeable erection, although Reed has said this was actually a banana which Thormahlen had stuffed down his jeans before the photo shoot.

==Release==
The first single from the album, &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;, became an international success, despite its controversial subject matter. The song&#x27;s lyrics mention transgender issues, sex acts, and drugs, leading it to be edited in some countries and banned in others. It is now generally regarded by fans and critics as Reed&#x27;s signature tune. &quot;Satellite of Love&quot; was issued as the second single in February 1973. In 2002, a 30th anniversary edition of the album was released; in addition to demos of &quot;Hangin&#x27; Round&quot; and &quot;Perfect Day&quot;, it includes a hidden track featuring an advert for the album. Following Reed&#x27;s death in October 2013, digital sales of &quot;Transformer&quot;, &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;, and &quot;Perfect Day&quot; all rose more than 300%, and &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; cracked the new &quot;Billboard&quot; Rock Digital Songs chart at No. 38.

==Critical reception==
In a mixed review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Nick Tosches noted the songs &quot;Satellite of Love&quot;, &quot;Vicious&quot;, &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; and &quot;Hangin&#x27; &#x27;Round&quot; which he felt expressed a stimulating sexuality saying &quot;Reed himself says he thinks the album&#x27;s great. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s nearly as good as he&#x27;s capable of doing. He seems to have the abilities to come up with some really dangerous, powerful music, stuff that people like Jagger and Bowie have only rubbed knees with.&quot; In a retrospective review for &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Tom Hull remarked that Reed &quot;wrote a bunch of clever new songs and tried to cash in on producer David Bowie&#x27;s trendily androgynous glam rock, which worked well enough to break &#x27;Walk on the Wild Side.&#x27;&quot;

In 1997, &quot;Transformer&quot; was named the 44th greatest album of all time in a &quot;Music of the Millennium&quot; poll conducted in the United Kingdom by HMV, Channel 4, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Classic FM. In 2000, it was voted number 58 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. &quot;Transformer&quot; is also ranked at number 55 on &quot;NME&quot;″s list of &quot;Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked at number 194 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, and is ranked 109 on the 2020 list. It is also on &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Albums Ever&quot;.

In 2018, 33⅓ published a book by musician Ezra Furman about &quot;Transformer&quot;.

<doc id="853169" wikidata="Q2435222" url="?curid=853169" title="Tim Roemer">
<text>Timothy John Roemer (born October 30, 1956) is an American diplomat and politician who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1991 to 2003 as a Democrat from Indiana&#x27;s 3rd congressional district. Subsequently, he was the president of the Center for National Policy (CNP), a Washington, D.C.–based national security think tank. He served as U.S. Ambassador to India from 2009 to 2011. Roemer currently serves on the advisory board of Washington, D.C.–based non-profit America Abroad Media.

==Early life and education==
Tim Roemer was born in 1956 in South Bend, Indiana. His grandfather, William F. Roemer, was a philosophy professor at the University of Notre Dame; and his grandmother was an elementary school teacher. Roemer&#x27;s parents, James and Mary Ann Roemer, also worked at Notre Dame as dean of students and coordinator of volunteer activities, respectively. His uncle, William F. Roemer Jr., was an FBI agent who battled organized crime. Roemer graduated from Penn High School in 1975 and worked at various jobs from the age of 14 to help pay for college.

Tim Roemer graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a B.A. degree in 1979. He earned his M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame; his 1985 dissertation was titled &quot;The Senior Executive Service: Retirement and Public Personnel Policy.&quot;

==Political career==
Tim Roemer entered politics by serving on the staff of U.S. Representative John Brademas of Indiana (1978–1979) while still in college. After completing his doctorate, he served on the staff of U.S. Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona (1985–1989).
In 1990, Roemer ran and won as a Democrat in 1990 to represent Indiana&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, his boss&#x27; former district, serving six terms in Congress from 1991 to 2003. While in the House, Roemer served on the Intelligence, Education and Workforce, and Science committees. He did not run for reelection in 2002.

Tim Roemer voted in favor of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and the Caribbean Basin Initiative. He opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), feeling it provided incentives for businesses to move out of the country (as may have happened in his district). Roemer voted against presidential fast-track trade promotion authority, believing that the United States should have been stricter in its enforcement of existing agreements.

Much of Roemer&#x27;s efforts during his congressional career were related to improving education. He was the principal author of the Ed-Flex bill, which encouraged states to seek innovative approaches to education. Roemer was the chief sponsor of the &quot;Transition to Teaching&quot; bill that helped address teacher shortages by recruiting and training professionals to become teachers. Roemer was also the lead sponsor of the five-year reauthorization of Higher Education Act, which reduced interest rates on student loans, increased Pell Grants, increased funding for teacher training, and expanded aid to families.

Tim Roemer was a principal sponsor of the AmeriCorps national service program, and a co-author of a bill to expand Head Start services to provide childcare coverage for women moving from welfare to work. He co-wrote legislation on reauthorizing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and wrote an amendment to tax relief legislation for teacher certification of professionals in outside fields. He co-authored &quot;School-to-Work&quot; legislation to help non-college-bound high school students learn skills to prepare them for the workforce.

In his final term in Congress, Roemer was instrumental in passing the No Child Left Behind Act and pushed for full funding for the program.

Roemer was one of the first members of Congress to call for a Cabinet-level federal executive department to oversee national security, and was an original sponsor of the legislation to create the Department of Homeland Security. Eventually he opposed the revisions proposed by the Bush administration, because of concerns about bureaucratic inefficiencies, and voted against the creation of DHS. Roemer advocated a &quot;civilian reserve corps&quot; to train more fluent speakers in foreign languages for the Intelligence Community. Roemer was an original sponsor of bioterrorism legislation and legislation aimed at creating the 9/11 Commission, upon which he later served.

==Post-electoral career==

Tim Roemer was appointed as a member of the 9/11 Commission to investigate the terrorist attacks on the US. He was a candidate for chair of the Democratic National Committee (gaining the support of Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid). He lost to Howard Dean, who had unsuccessfully sought the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination.

Roemer was criticized as too conservative for the post, due to his anti-abortion stance and his oft-mentioned vote in 1993 against the President Bill Clinton economic plan. Roemer is a moderate Democrat, voting more liberally on some foreign policy issues and conservatively on social issues.

Roemer endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries and campaigned vigorously for him, particularly in his home state of Indiana, where he joined Lee H. Hamilton in support of Obama. Roemer&#x27;s moderate, bipartisan politics, and national security experience led to speculation (from Chris Cillizza and Ben Smith) that Roemer was considered a possible vice presidential running mate for Obama.

Roemer served as a distinguished scholar at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. He became a partner at Johnston and Associates, a public and legislative affairs consultancy. He was later selected as the president of the Center for National Policy. After leaving his post as U.S. Ambassador to India in 2011, he became a senior executive at the Washington, D.C.–based public affairs firm APCO Worldwide.

Roemer served on the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism, a bipartisan commission created by Congress in 2007. This was one of the reforms recommended by the 9/11 Commission to examine how the United States can best address this threat to national security.

In addition, Roemer served on the Washington Institute for Near East Policy&#x27;s Presidential Task force on Combating the Ideology of Radical Extremism, and the National Parks Second Century Commission.

==Diplomatic career==

Roemer was nominated by President Barack Obama as the 21st U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of India on May 27, 2009. His nomination was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on July 10, 2009, he was sworn in on July 23, 2009, in the State Department&#x27;s ceremonial Benjamin Franklin Treaty Room and he presented his credentials to Indian President Pratibha Patil on August 11, 2009.

During his tenure as Ambassador, several policies and initiatives were announced. President Obama stated during his visit to India in November 2010 that the U.S. would support India as a permanent member to a reformed United Nations Security Council. The United States also removed India&#x27;s defense and space-related entities from the U.S. &quot;Entity List,&quot; opening the door for increased cooperation, technology transfer, and commercial sales in the defense and space industries. The United States agreed to set up a Global Disease Detection Center. and will work with India on its new Global Center for Nuclear Energy Partnership. The United States and India will partner globally to support food security in Africa and reconstruction in Afghanistan.

On July 23, 2010, Ambassador Roemer and Indian Home Affairs Secretary G.K. Pillai signed the Counterterrorism Cooperation Initiative. This agreement expands cooperation in several areas such as transportation security, border security, money laundering and terrorist financing, and megacity policing. The U.S. government also agreed to give the Government of India access to David Headley, one of the planners of the 26/11 terrorist attacks in Mumbai.

Ambassador Roemer presided over several high level visits including visits by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. The first annual strategic dialogue meeting between the United States and India was held in June 2010 in Washington D.C., with the second scheduled for July 2011 in New Delhi.

During his two-year tenure, India moved up to be the 12th leading trade partner of the United States. In 2010, exports in goods from the United States to India were up 17 percent and two-way trade in goods increased 30 percent. During President Obama&#x27;s visit to India, the United States announced 20 deals totaling $10 billion in U.S. exports that will lead to more than 50,000 jobs in America.
During his tenure, the United States also pushed to make the G-20 the premier international economic body and reformed the IMF to give India greater representation.

Ambassador Roemer travelled throughout India during his two years, visiting 17 states. He was the first Ambassador in over 10 years to visit Jammu and Kashmir, including a September 20, 2010, visit to the city of Leh to bring relief supplies to 400 rural families affected by a recent flash flood.

In May 2011, Roemer received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of Notre Dame and gave the commencement address to The Graduate School.

On April 26, 2011, he announced his resignation as Ambassador and returned to the U.S.
A press release from the U.S. embassy in India stated ambassador Roemer leaving by June citing family reasons. Indian politician Shashi Tharoor wrote that Roemer resigned the post following India&#x27;s decision to reject two American aircraft manufacturing tenders worth US$10 billion.

==Personal life==
Tim Roemer married Sally Johnston of Louisiana in 1989. They have four children: Patrick Hunter Roemer, Matthew Bennett Roemer, Sarah Kathryn Roemer, and Grace Elizabeth Roemer. Roemer is the son-in-law of J. Bennett Johnston and Mary (Gunn) Johnston. His father-in-law Johnston is a Democratic politician who served as a member of the United States Senate from Louisiana from 1972 to 1997.
The Roemers are Roman Catholic. When in Washington, they attend St. Thomas à Becket Catholic Church in Reston, Virginia.

<doc id="853170" wikidata="Q5139154" url="?curid=853170" title="Coccidioides immitis">
<text>Coccidioides immitis is a pathogenic fungus that resides in the soil in certain parts of the southwestern United States, northern Mexico, and a few other areas in the Western Hemisphere.

==Epidemiology==
&quot;C. immitis&quot;, along with its relative &quot;C. posadasii&quot;, is most commonly seen in the desert regions of the southwestern United States, including certain areas of Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, and Utah; and in Central and South America in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Venezuela.

===Precise location===
&quot;C. immitis&quot; is largely found in California, but also Baja California and Arizona, while &quot;C. posadasii&quot; is regularly found in Texas, northern Mexico and in Central and South America. Both &quot;C. immitis&quot; and &quot;C. posadasii&quot; are present in Arizona. &quot;C. immitis&quot; is more common west of the Tehachapi Mountains, while &quot;C. posadasii&quot; is more common east of it. &quot;Coccidioides&quot; spp. are found in alkaline, sandy soils from semi-desert regions with hot summers, gentle winters, and annual rainfall between . These fungi are usually found beneath the surface.

==Clinical manifestation==
&quot;C. immitis&quot; can cause a disease called coccidioidomycosis (valley fever). Its incubation period varies from 7 to 21 days. Coccidioidomycosis is not easily diagnosed on the basis of vital signs and symptoms, which are usually vague and nonspecific. Even a chest X-ray or CT scan cannot reliably distinguish it from other lung diseases, including lung cancer. Blood or urine tests are administered, which aim to discover &quot;Coccidioides&quot; antigens. However, because the &quot;Coccidioides&quot; creates a mass that can mimic a lung tumor, the correct diagnosis may require a tissue sample (biopsy). A Gomori methenamine silver stain can then confirm the presence of the &quot;Coccidioides&quot; organism&#x27;s characteristic spherules within the tissue. The &quot;C. immitis&quot; fungus can be cultured from a patient sample, but the culture can take weeks to grow and requires special precautions on a part of the laboratory staff while handling it (screw cap vials and sterile transfer hoods are recommended). It is reported as the tenth-most often acquired infection in the laboratory conditions with two documented deaths. Until October 2012, &quot;C. immitis&quot; had been listed as a select agent by both the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and was considered a biosafety level 3 pathogen.

== Treatment ==
* Most &quot;Coccidioides&quot; infections have an incubation period from one to four weeks and resolve without specific therapy; few clinical trials have assessed outcomes in less-severe disease.
* Commonly used indicators to judge the severity of illness include:
** Continuous fever for longer than 1 month
** Body-weight loss of more than 10%
** Intense night sweats that persist for more than 3 weeks
** Infiltrates that involve more than half of one lung or portions of both lungs
** Prominent or persistent hilar adenopathy
** Anticoccidioidal complement fixation IgG titers of 1:16 or higher
** Absence of dermal hypersensitivity to coccidioidal antigens
** Inability to work
** Symptoms that persist for more than 2 months
* Risk factors for dissemination (for which treatment should be initiated):
** Primary infection during infancy
** Primary infection during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester or immediately &quot;post partum&quot;
** Immunosuppression (e.g., patients with HIV/AIDS, transplant recipients, patients receiving high-dose corticosteroids, those receiving antitumor necrosis factor medications)
** Chronic debilitation or underlying disease, including diabetes mellitus or preexisting cardiopulmonary disease
** High inoculum exposures
** Certain ethnicities, such as Filipino, Black, or Hispanic

=== Azoles ===
The introduction of azoles revolutionized treatment for coccidioidomycosis, and these agents are usually the first line of therapy. However, none of these azoles are safe to use in pregnancy and lactation because they have shown teratogenicity in animal studies.

Of the azoles, ketoconazole is the only one approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of coccidioidomycosis. Nevertheless, although it was initially used in the long-term treatment of nonmeningeal extrapulmonary disease, more-potent, less-toxic triazoles (fluconazole and itraconazole) have replaced it. Itraconazole (400 mg/day) appears to have efficacy equal to that of fluconazole in the treatment of nonmeningeal infection and have the same relapse rate after therapy is discontinued. However, itraconazole seems to perform better in skeletal lesions, whereas fluconazole performs better in pulmonary and soft tissue infection. Serum levels of itraconazole are commonly obtained at the onset of long-term therapy because its absorption is sometimes erratic and unpredictable. Complications can include hepatic dysfunction.

For patients who are unresponsive to fluconazole, options are limited. Several case reports have studied the efficacy of three newer antifungal agents in the treatment of disease that is refractory to first-line therapy: posaconazole and voriconazole (triazole compounds similar in structure to fluconazole) and caspofungin (glucan synthesis inhibitor of the echinocandin structural class). However, these drugs have not been FDA approved, and clinical trials are lacking. Susceptibility testing of &quot;Coccidioides &quot;species in one report revealed uniform susceptibility to most antifungal agents, including these newer drugs.

In very severe cases, combination therapy with amphotericin B and an azole have been postulated, although no trials have been conducted. Caspofungin in combination with fluconazole has been cited as beneficial in a case report of a 31-year-old Asian patient with coccidioidal pneumonia. In a case report of a 23-year-old Black male with HIV and coccidioidal meningitis, combination therapy of amphotericin B and posaconazole led to clinical improvement.

Posaconazole has been approved by the European Commission as a salvage therapy for refractory coccidioidomycosis. Clinical trials are now ongoing for further evaluation. Voriconazole is also being studied in salvage therapy for refractory cases. A case report indicated that voriconazole in combination with amphotericin B as salvage therapy for disseminated coccidioidomycosis was successful.

Several case reports have studied caspofungin, with differing results. Caspofungin 50 mg/day following administration of amphotericin B in a patient with acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis who had undergone transplantation showed promising results. In a patient with disseminated coccidioidomycosis, first-line therapy with amphotericin B and caspofungin alone failed to elicit a response, but the patient was then given caspofungin combined with fluconazole, with good results. A published report described a patient with disseminated and meningeal coccidioidomycosis in whom conventional therapy with fluconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin B failed; caspofungin 50 mg/day after a loading dose of 70 mg intravenously was also unsuccessful.

=== Amphotericin ===
Amphotericin B, introduced in 1957, remains the treatment of choice for severe infections. It is usually reserved for worsening disease or lesions located in vital organs such as the spine. It can be administered either in the classic amphotericin B deoxycholate formulation or as a lipid formulation. No studies have directly compared amphotericin B with azole therapy. Complications include renal toxicity, bone marrow toxicity, and local systemic effects (fever, rigors).
=== Duration of therapy and costs ===
The objectives of treatment are resolution of infection, decrease of antibody titers, return of function of involved organs, and prevention of relapse. The duration of therapy is dictated by the clinical course of the illness, but it should be at least 6 months in all patients and often a year or longer in others. Therapy is tailored based on a combination of resolution of symptoms, regression of radiographic abnormalities, and changes in CF IgG titers. Immunocompromised patients and patients with a history of meningeal involvement require lifelong treatment.

The cost of antifungal therapy is high, from $5,000 to $20,000 per year. These costs increase for critical patients in need of intensive care. Arizona spent an average of $33,762 per patient with coccidioidomycosis between 1998 and 2001.

==HHS select agents listing==

Along with &quot;C. posadasii&quot;, &quot;C. immitis&quot; was featured on the select agents and toxins list compiled by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), as evident from the Code of Federal Regulations (42 CFR 73). However, on October 5, 2012 due to advances in medical research and development of a number of licensed treatments, both pathogens were removed from the HHS select agents listing.

<text>Alice Lynne &quot;Lindy&quot; Chamberlain-Creighton (&quot;née&quot; Murchison, born 4 March 1948) is a New Zealand–born Australian woman who was falsely convicted in one of Australia&#x27;s most publicised and notorious murder trials and miscarriages of justice. Accused of killing her nine-week-old daughter, Azaria, while camping at Uluru ( Ayers Rock) in 1980, she maintained that she saw a dingo leave the tent where Azaria was sleeping. The prosecution case was circumstantial and depended upon forensic evidence that was eventually found to be deeply flawed.

Chamberlain was convicted on 29 October 1982, and her appeals to the Federal Court of Australia, and High Court of Australia, were dismissed. On 7 February 1986, after the discovery of new evidence clothing the same as Azaria wore Chamberlain was released from prison on remission. She and her husband Michael Chamberlain, co-accused, were officially pardoned in 1987, and their convictions were quashed by the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in 1988. In 1992, the Australian government paid Chamberlain $1.3 million in compensation. In 2012, a fourth coroner&#x27;s inquest found (as did the first inquest) that Azaria died &quot;as a result of being attacked and taken by a dingo&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Alice Lynne Murchison, known as &quot;Lindy&quot; from a young age, was born on 4 March 1948 in Whakatāne, New Zealand, the daughter of Avis and Cliff Murchison. The family were members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, with her father working as a church pastor.

In 1949 (when Lindy was 20 months old), the family moved to Australia and based themselves in Victoria, with regular moves (usually once per year) as Lindy&#x27;s father transferred to pastor new churches. She received her education in Victoria and gained her Matriculation in Benalla in 1965. During holiday times, she worked as a shop assistant, a clerk, and waitressing. In later times, she found work as a receptionist and as a book keeper.

On 18 November 1969, she married an Adventist pastor, the New Zealand-born Michael Chamberlain, and for the first five years after their marriage they lived in Tasmania with Michael pastoring to churches there. This is where Aiden, her first child, was born in 1973. During these 5 years, Lindy gained her certificate from Launceston Technical College in dressmaking, tailoring and drafting. The new family then moved to Queensland, with Lindy later giving birth to her second child (Regan) in Bowen in 1976 and, after living in Innisfail, they moved to Mount Isa in Northern Queensland. 
Friends of Lindy&#x27;s were aware that she had always wanted a girl (with one, Mrs. Ransom, later giving evidence about this) and on 11 June 1980 the Chamberlain&#x27;s first daughter, Azaria, was born. At this time in 1980, and when their daughter Azaria went missing, Michael Chamberlain was serving as minister of Mount Isa&#x27;s Seventh-day Adventist church with Lindy being highly involved in the church as well as doing the normal duties of a clergyman&#x27;s wife. She was also using her dressmaking skills to specialise in making wedding dresses to order.

Her second daughter and fourth child, Kahlia, was born in November 1982 at the Darwin Hospital while Lindy was in the custody of Darwin Prison after being falsely convicted of Azaria&#x27;s murder. Lindy&#x27;s new baby daughter was taken from her at birth prior to her return to prison to continue serving her mandatory life sentence with hard labour.

==Azaria&#x27;s disappearance==

When Azaria was 9 weeks old, the family went on a camping trip to Uluru, arriving on 16 August 1980. On the night of 17 August, Chamberlain reported that the child had been taken from their tent by a dingo. A massive search was organised; Azaria was not found but the jumpsuit she had been wearing was discovered about a week later about from the tent, bloodstained about the neck, indicating the probable death of the missing child. A matinee jacket the child had been wearing was not found at the time. From the day Azaria went missing, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain maintained a dingo took their child. Early on in the case, the facts showed that for the two years before Azaria went missing, Uluru chief ranger Derek Roff had been writing to the government urging a dingo cull and warning of imminent human tragedy. Roff noted that dingoes in the area were becoming increasingly aggressive, approaching and sometimes biting people.

==Conviction, imprisonment and release==
The initial inquiry, held in Alice Springs, Northern Territory, by Alice Springs magistrate and coroner Dennis Barritt in December 1980 and January 1981, supported the Chamberlains&#x27; account of Azaria&#x27;s disappearance, finding a dingo took the child. The Supreme Court quashed the findings of the initial inquest and ordered a second inquest in December 1981, with the taking of evidence concluded in February 1982. By an indictment presented to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in September 1982, Chamberlain was charged with Azaria&#x27;s murder. Michael Chamberlain was charged with being an accessory after the fact. On 29 October 1982 the Chamberlains were both found guilty as charged. 

===First inquest===

As is common in cases where someone dies in unusual or suspicious circumstances, a coronial inquest was held to attempt to determine the manner and cause of death. The first of many inquests was held from 15 December 1980 to 20 February 1981 in Alice Springs. The coroner, Stipendiary Magistrate Denis Barritt, found that a dingo snatched and killed Azaria Chamberlain. The parents, Michael and Lindy Chamberlain, were not implicated in any way with the disappearance of their child.

===Second inquest===
In committing the Chamberlains for trial, the coroner who performed the second inquest and recorded the findings as to the cause and manner of Azaria&#x27;s death stated that although the evidence was to a large degree circumstantial, a properly instructed jury could arrive at a verdict with regard to the clothing evidence. He surmised that the Chamberlains knew dingoes were in the area, attempted to simulate a dingo attack, recovered Azaria&#x27;s buried body, removed her clothing, damaged the clothing by cutting, rubbed the clothing in vegetation, and deposited the clothing for later recovery. On this basis and that of blood evidence of unknown origin found in the Chamberlains&#x27; car, the Chamberlains were prosecuted and convicted for the murder of their two-month-old baby, with Lindy sentenced to life imprisonment without parole 
and Michael Chamberlain suspended for three years as an accessory to murder. The stain believed to have been blood that was found in the Chamberlains&#x27; car was later determined to be most likely a sound-deadening compound from a manufacturing overspray.

===Prosecution claims===
The prosecution&#x27;s theory was that in a five- to ten-minute absence from the camp fire, Lindy returned to her tent, stopped her young son Aidan from following her, changed into tracksuit pants, took Azaria to her car, obtained and used scissors to cut Azaria&#x27;s throat, either the carotid arteries or jugular veins. All experts stated there was an absence of evidence of arterial bleeding on the jumpsuit and death would have taken up to 20 minutes if the jugular was cut. The prosecution continued that she then waited for Azaria to die, hid the body in a camera case in the car, cleaned the blood from everything including the outside of the camera case, removed her tracksuit pants, obtained baked beans for her son from the car, returned to the tent, left blood splashes there, and then brought her son Aidan back to the campfire without attracting the attention of other campers. Camper Greg Lowe gave evidence that he observed her go to the tent with Azaria and Aidan and then walk to the car with her left arm around Aidan and her right arm unimpeded. She then returned to the tent and immediately claimed that she saw a dingo taking her baby with evidence implicating a dingo being purely coincidental. It was claimed she was fortunate that no one noticed alleged blood on Chamberlain&#x27;s clothes in the hours after the disappearance. Chamberlain opening the car where the body was allegedly hidden to give a dog the scent of Azaria from her clothes in the car was called a daring act. She also must have done it without her husband&#x27;s knowledge or he was also incredibly daring since he left his children in her care afterwards. He told the police that he had given them the wrong camera case and then gave them the one that was allegedly used to conceal the body.

In the second inquest, concerning the clothing evidence alone:

# The clothing of the deceased child had been buried prior to its finding and probably contained the body of the child when buried.
# Soil type of a pH found on the clothing is consistent with the pH of the soil at the camp and also with the consistency of the soil in clothing and at the site and is inconsistent with the type of soil and pH in the area in which the clothing was found.
# There is no evidence on the clothing of dragging or catching nor the presence of saliva. It was argued that the absence of saliva was not remarkable as a witness gave evidence of heavy rain in the area. The clothing was not subjected to heavy rain as there is evidence that heavy rain would have adversely affected the bloodstaining on the clothing and this is not the case. This lack of presence of saliva and dragging is inconsistent with a dingo carrying the body a distance of some four kilometres.
# The jumpsuit was completely done up by studs to the neck which remained closed while the child was bleeding.
# After the blood had dried the two top studs were undone prior to the clothing being buried whilst containing the body of the child.
# There is evidence provided by fluorescent examination to suggest the presence of a palm print of a small adult right hand and some evidence of the presence of a left hand caused by a person holding the child when that person&#x27;s hands were contaminated with wet blood.
# Single holes or indentations which appear in the clothing could be consistent with teeth marks of an animal but the absence of tissue stains in conjunction with those holes make it inconsistent with an animal holding the body of the child. The evidence clearly establishes that the clothing has been cut and in places torn by a person or persons and in particular the cut on the collar was made after the bloodstaining had occurred, It was argued that one area of damage in the general area of the elbow may be consistent with an animal tearing, but the evidence is very strong that such a tearing by an animal would be inconsistent because of the lack of evidence of the presence of tissue staining which would inevitably be involved if an animal had caused the damage to the clothing.
# Vegetation contamination on the clothing is inconsistent with vegetation found at the scene and inconsistent with the likely contamination which would have occurred if the clothing with a body in it had been carried by an animal. This supports the view that the vegetation contamination was caused by human intervention.
# The clothes as found were not strewn around the area and this is inconsistent with an animal being responsible for their placement.
# The clothing was found adjacent to a path near the base of a rock and adjacent to a dingo&#x27;s lair.
# Scissors were found in the Chamberlain&#x27;s car on which there was present human fetal blood staining on the cutting edge and on the hinge areas. There is evidence to support that when comparable scissors are used to cut through blood that blood would be deposited on the cutting edge. An inference can be drawn that these scissors were used to cut the deceased&#x27;s clothing. There is no weight to the argument that the subject scissors were unable to cut clothing as this was after the stud had been removed from the scissors to enable certain tests.

From this evidence it was concluded that both Chamberlains were implicated in covering their crime.

The prosecution&#x27;s expert testimony for forensic evidence included that of James Cameron, a scientist who had also given crucial evidence in a case in England which was later overturned when his expert evidence was proved wrong. With regard to the timing of the baby&#x27;s cry and Chamberlain&#x27;s whereabouts, the prosecution also claimed that the Chamberlains convinced fellow camper and witness Sally Lowe to say that she heard Azaria cry after Chamberlain returned to the camp fire.

===Evidence that a dingo took Azaria Chamberlain===
Camper Sally Lowe and Michael Chamberlain gave evidence that they heard a baby cry at a time when Chamberlain was with them at the barbecue area and Azaria was believed to be in the family tent.

Witness Judith West, who was camped 30 metres (98 feet) away, testified to hearing a dog&#x27;s low, throaty growl coming from that direction, a sound that she associated with growls her husband&#x27;s dogs made when he was slaughtering sheep.

Chamberlain gave evidence that, in response to others hearing Azaria cry, she went to the tent. Halfway to the tent, she thought she saw a dingo emerging from the tent having difficulty getting out of the tent and shaking its head vigorously. Her view of its nose was obscured. She cried &quot;Michael, Michael, the dingo&#x27;s got my baby!&quot; and ran into the tent to check on her children. Azaria was missing. She chased in the direction she thought it had gone, and called out to her husband for a torch.

Police Detective Sergeant John Lincoln gave evidence that he took photographs of large paw prints a few centimetres from Azaria&#x27;s cot and found what was probably blood outside the tent. He collected samples but they were not tested.

Lowe also gave evidence that she had brought Reagan out of the tent after the occurrence. When she was in the tent she observed a pool of blood in the tent about 15 cm by 10 cm (6 by 4 inches). However, the amount of blood was disputed. Another witness who entered the tent that night, police Constable Frank Morris, gave evidence that there were only a few drops of blood on a couple of blankets and a sleeping bag in the tent.

A scientific witness located blood on the wall of the tent. Scientist Dr. Andrew Scott agreed that the spray mark of blood was consistent with a dingo carrying a bleeding baby. However, he did not believe that it was human blood. Canine hairs were located in the tent and on Azaria&#x27;s jumpsuit. The Chamberlains did not own a dog.

Les Harris, then President of the Dingo Foundation, gave evidence that his opinion based on years of studying dingoes is that a dingo could have enveloped the head of a baby in its mouth and carried the weight of a baby over long distances. He produced photographs of dingoes enveloping the head of a baby-sized doll in its jaws. However, forensic expert Professor James Cameron gave evidence that, based on studying plaster casts of dingo jaws, it was impossible for a dingo to open its jaws wide enough to encompass a child&#x27;s head.

Tourist Max Whittacker gave evidence that he attended a search later on the night of the disappearance with people including the head ranger and an Aboriginal tracker (known to be Nipper Winmarti). He claimed to have been called by the head ranger to help him and the Aboriginal tracker to follow dingo paw prints and scrape marks in the sand in a westerly direction. He was led to believe they were following the trail of a dingo carrying a heavy object believed to be Azaria&#x27;s body. &quot;I now know that the Aboriginal&#x27;s account of following these tracks west that night has been denied by rangers and the Aboriginal&#x27;s account of this incident has not been accepted.&quot;

Although expert opinion varied as to whether the clothes damage could have been caused by a dingo some took the view that it could have been. Further, marks on nappy fragments were similar to marks resulting from a dingo on another nappy that was used for testing purposes. Azaria&#x27;s clothing was found only 30 metres (98 feet) from a dingo&#x27;s den, although no one, including the chief ranger and his deputy, was aware of the den at the time.

===Claims of human interference with clothes===
Some evidence indicates human intervention between the time of discovery of Azaria&#x27;s clothes and the time that the police photographed them.

Camper Wallace Goodwin, who was the first to discover the jumpsuit, singlet and nappy, gave evidence that the whole of the jumpsuit was undone, that the clothes were lying on the ground naturally not artificially, and that he believed the singlet was beside the jumpsuit not inside it. However, police Constable Frank Morris, the first police officer to examine the clothes after Goodwin located them, gave evidence that only the top four buttons were undone and the singlet was inside it. He stated that he picked up the clothes to check the inside for human remains and then returned it to the ground and photographed it. The singlet that had been placed back in the jumpsuit was inside out. Chamberlain gave evidence that she always ensured that singlets were not inside out.

===Post-conviction===
Shortly after her conviction, Chamberlain was escorted from Berrimah Prison under guard to give birth to her fourth child, Kahlia, on 17 November 1982, in Darwin Hospital, and was returned thereafter to prison. An appeal to the Federal Court against conviction was subsequently dismissed. Another appeal against her conviction was rejected by the High Court in February 1984.

===Release on new evidence===

New evidence emerged on 2 February 1986 when Azaria&#x27;s matinee jacket, which the police had maintained did not exist, was found partially buried adjacent to a dingo lair in an isolated location near Uluru. Five days later, on 7 February 1986, with the discovery of Azaria&#x27;s missing jacket supporting the Chamberlains&#x27; defence case, Chamberlain was released from prison, and her life sentence was remitted by the Northern Territory Government. In 1987, a Royal Commission began investigating the matter further.

===Morling Royal Commission===
The purpose of the royal commission was to enquire into and report on the correctness of the Chamberlain convictions. In reaching the conclusion that there was a reasonable doubt as to the Chamberlains&#x27; guilt, Commissioner Trevor Morling concluded that the hypothesis that Chamberlain murdered Azaria had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Although the commission was of the opinion that the evidence afforded considerable support for the dingo hypothesis, it did not examine the evidence to see whether it had been proved that a dingo took the baby. To do so would, in the words of Morling, involve a &quot;fundamental error of reversing the onus of proof and requiring Mrs Chamberlain to prove her innocence&quot; (at p. 339 of the report).

==Acquittal==
In acquitting the Chamberlains in 1988, the Supreme Court found that the alleged &quot;baby blood&quot; found in the Chamberlains&#x27; car, upon which the prosecution so heavily relied, could have been any substance, but was likely that of a sound deadening compound from a manufacturing overspray (which contained no blood). This finding underscored inconsistencies in the earlier blood testing, which, along with the later-recovered matinee jacket from a dingo lair area, had given rise to the Morling Royal Commission&#x27;s doubts about the propriety of her conviction. The court also noted that as DNA testing was not advanced in the early 1980s, the expert testimony given by the prosecution at trial and relied on by the jurors was reasonable evidence at the time, even though it was ultimately found to be faulty.

===Third inquest===
After the Chamberlains were acquitted by the Supreme Court in September 1988 and their convictions overturned, a third inquest in 1995 took place, with the coroner&#x27;s report stating that it was a &quot;paper inquest&quot; rather than a full inquest since there was little new evidence and the second inquest was never fully completed. The coroner considered the Morling Royal Commission&#x27;s report enquiring into the correctness of the convictions against Chamberlain along with submissions made on behalf of the Chamberlains, and returned an open verdict in Azaria&#x27;s cause of death, or, insufficient evidence by the prosecution that failed to meet the required standard of proof for conviction. Specifically, he wrote 
&quot;After examining all the evidence I am unable to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Azaria Chamberlain died at the hands of Alice Lynne Chamberlain. It automatically follows that I am also unable to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Michael Leigh Chamberlain had any involvement in the death.&quot; 
He also wrote that because the evidence for the death-by-dingo hypothesis was never developed, &quot;I am unable to be reasonably satisfied that Azaria Chamberlain died accidentally as a result of being taken by a dingo.&quot; He noted that &quot;Indeed, the evidence affords considerable support for the view that a dingo may have taken her. To examine the evidence to see whether it has been proved that a dingo took Azaria would be to make the fundamental error of reversing the onus of proof and requiring Mrs Chamberlain to prove her innocence.&quot;

===2012 inquest===
The Chamberlains continued to push for a resolution to the investigation into the death of Azaria as being caused by one or more dingoes without human interference. A new inquest began in February 2012 and new figures on dingo attacks on Fraser Island were collated by the Queensland Government&#x27;s Department of Environment and Resource Management and provided as evidence at the Azaria Chamberlain inquest. Coroner Elizabeth Morris said that the new evidence in relation to dingo attacks on infants and young children had helped convince her to reopen the investigation. After 32 years of intense media interest and public excoriation, the Chamberlains stated they remained unsatisfied with bare acquittal and presumed innocence, and were keen to finally, and definitively, determine how their daughter died. On 12 June 2012, an Australian coroner made a final ruling that a dingo took baby Azaria Chamberlain from a campsite in 1980 and caused her death. Morris apologised to the Chamberlain family while an amended death certificate was immediately made available to them.

==Subsequent life==
Chamberlain published &quot;Through My Eyes: an autobiography&quot; in 1990. The Chamberlains divorced in 1991. On 20 December 1992, she married Rick Creighton, an American publisher and fellow member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and is now known as Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton. She and Creighton live in Australia. In 2007, Chamberlain spoke out in support of the parents of Madeleine McCann and said she would be willing to talk to the McCanns.

In August 2010, on the 30th anniversary of the death of Azaria, Chamberlain appealed on her website to have the cause of death amended on Azaria&#x27;s death record. In 2012, the coroner&#x27;s final report identified that a dingo was the cause of death.

==Film and other adaptations==
In the 1983 Australian television movie about the case, &quot;Who Killed Baby Azaria?&quot;, Chamberlain was played by Elaine Hudson; the movie aired on Network Ten. In the 1988 film &quot;Evil Angels&quot; (released as &quot;A Cry in the Dark&quot; outside Australia and New Zealand) the role was played by Meryl Streep, whose performance received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in 1989. Miranda Otto played Chamberlain in the 2004 Australian television mini-series &quot;Through My Eyes: The Lindy Chamberlain Story&quot;, which aired on the Seven Network.

Australian composer Moya Henderson wrote the opera &quot;Lindy&quot; to a libretto by Judith Rodriguez. In 1990, the Rank Strangers&#x27; recording of their song &quot;Uluru&quot;, which supported the Chamberlains and called for compensation to be paid to them, finished in the final five of the Australian Country Music Awards in Tamworth, New South Wales.

In 2021, Australian drag queen Etcetera Etcetera portrayed Chamberlain on the Snatch Game episode of the first series of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race Down Under&quot;. The performance was roundly criticised in the media and by fellow contestants for being in poor taste.

Also in 2021, the release of Lindy Chamberlain from prison after the jacket of her baby daughter was found in a dingo lair was featured in episode three of the Australian series &quot;The Newsreader&quot;.

<text>The Exhibition railway line is a special-purpose railway line in Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, Australia. It conveys Queensland Rail City network passengers during the Royal Queensland Show (locally known as &quot;the Ekka&quot;) in August and rare other special events held in the showgrounds. It is informally known as the Ekka Loop.

Goods trains also use the Exhibition line to access the Normanby marshalling yard and to travel across Brisbane while avoiding city stations and congestion between Bowen Hills and Roma Street stations. QR Traveltrain long-distance passenger services similarly use the Exhibition line to arrive at and depart from Roma Street station. Empty City network and Traveltrain sets also use the line to access the Normanby train washing facility and the Mayne locomotive and electric depot.

==History==
When the Roma St to Sandgate railway opened in 1882, it had been constructed via Normanby to avoid the need for land resumptions through the Brisbane CBD. When passenger trains were diverted to the new line via Central station in 1890, traffic diminished significantly, and the section between Exhibition station and Mayne along with Normanby station was closed in 1900.

Traffic on the QR system continued to grow, and so the closed section was reopened in 1911 to allow goods trains from the North Coast line to use that route to reach Roma St, the main goods yard in Brisbane. When the locomotive and carriage sheds were relocated from Roma St to Mayne in 1927, the line was duplicated to deal with the additional empty trains travelling to and from Brisbane&#x27;s main terminating station.

The line was electrified in 1982 to allow empty electric units to travel to and from Roma St.

In 2023, the line was realigned as part of the Cross River Rail project in what was described as one of the longest and most complicated pieces of track work ever undertaken in South East Queensland. Works included a new 150-metre bridge outside the Brisbane Showgrounds.

==Line guide and services==
Services stop at city stations (Roma Street, Central and Fortitude Valley) before the loop leaves the main line in the middle of platform 4 of Bowen Hills, and therefore can not stop here for passengers. The service runs in both directions.

Passengers for/from the Airport, Doomben, Caboolture, Ferny Grove, Nambour and Gympie North, Redcliffe Peninsula and Shorncliffe lines change at Central or Fortitude Valley, and Beenleigh, Cleveland, Gold Coast, Ipswich, Rosewood and Springfield lines at Roma Street.

<doc id="853175" wikidata="Q5073783" url="?curid=853175" title="Characterizations of the exponential function">
<text>In mathematics, the exponential function can be characterized in many ways.
This article presents some common characterizations, discusses why each makes sense, and proves that they are all equivalent. 

The exponential function occurs naturally in many branches of mathematics. Walter Rudin called it &quot;the most important function in mathematics&quot;.
It is therefore useful to have multiple ways to define (or characterize) it.
Each of the characterizations below may be more or less useful depending on context.
The &quot;product limit&quot; characterization of the exponential function was discovered by Leonhard Euler.

== Characterizations ==

The six most common definitions of the exponential function formula_1 for real values formula_2 are as follows.
# &quot;Product limit.&quot; Define formula_3 by the limit:formula_4
# &quot;Power series.&quot; Define as the value of the infinite series formula_5 (Here denotes the factorial of . One proof that is irrational uses a special case of this formula.)
# &quot;Inverse of logarithm integral.&quot; Define formula_3 to be the unique number such that formula_7 That is, formula_3 is the inverse of the natural logarithm function formula_9, which is defined by this integral.
# &quot;Differential equation.&quot; Define formula_10 to be the unique solution to the differential equation with initial value:formula_11 where formula_12 denotes the derivative of .
# &quot;Functional equation.&quot; The exponential function formula_3 is the unique function with the multiplicative property formula_14 for all formula_15 and formula_16. The condition formula_16 can be replaced with formula_18 together with any of the following regularity conditions: For the uniqueness, one must impose &quot;some&quot; regularity condition, since other functions satisfying formula_14 can be constructed using a basis for the real numbers over the rationals, as described by Hewitt and Stromberg. 
# &quot;Elementary definition by powers.&quot; Define the exponential function with base formula_20 to be the continuous function formula_21 whose value on integers formula_22 is given by repeated multiplication or division of formula_23, and whose value on rational numbers formula_24 is given by formula_25. Then define formula_3 to be the exponential function whose base formula_27 is the unique positive real number satisfying: formula_28

== Larger domains ==
One way of defining the exponential function over the complex numbers is to first define it for the domain of real numbers using one of the above characterizations, and then extend it as an analytic function, which is characterized by its values on any infinite domain set. 

Also, characterisations (1), (2), and (4) for formula_3 apply directly for formula_30 a complex number. Definition (3) presents a problem because there are non-equivalent paths along which one could integrate; but the equation of (3) should hold for any such path modulo formula_31. As for definition (5), the additive property together with the complex derivative formula_32 are sufficient to guarantee formula_33. However, the initial value condition formula_18 together with the other regularity conditions are not sufficient. For example, for real &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, the functionformula_35satisfies the three listed regularity conditions in (5) but is not equal to formula_36. A sufficient condition is that formula_18 and that formula_38 is a conformal map at some point; or else the two initial values formula_18 and formula_40 together with the other regularity conditions. 

One may also define the exponential on other domains, such as matrices and other algebras. Definitions (1), (2), and (4) all make sense for arbitrary Banach algebras.

== Proof that each characterization makes sense ==

Some of these definitions require justification to demonstrate that they are well-defined. For example, when the value of the function is defined as the result of a limiting process (i.e. an infinite sequence or series), it must be demonstrated that such a limit always exists.

=== Characterization 1 ===
The error of the product limit expression is described by:formula_41
where the polynomial&#x27;s degree (in &quot;x&quot;) in the term with denominator &quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot; is 2&quot;k&quot;.

=== Characterization 2 ===
Since
formula_42
it follows from the ratio test that formula_43 converges for all &quot;x&quot;.

=== Characterization 3 ===
Since the integrand is an integrable function of , the integral expression is well-defined. It must be shown that the function from formula_44 to formula_45 defined by
formula_46
is a bijection. Since is positive for positive , this function is strictly increasing, hence injective. If the two integrals
formula_47
hold, then it is surjective as well. Indeed, these integrals &quot;do&quot; hold; they follow from the integral test and the divergence of the harmonic series.

=== Characterization 6 ===
The definition depends on the unique positive real number formula_27 satisfying: formula_49This limit can be shown to exist for any formula_23, and it defines a continuous increasing function formula_51 with formula_52 and formula_53, so the Intermediate value theorem guarantees the existence of such a value formula_27.

== Equivalence of the characterizations ==

The following arguments demonstrate the equivalence of the above characterizations for the exponential function. 

=== Characterization 1 ⇔ characterization 2 ===

The following argument is adapted from Rudin, theorem 3.31, p. 63–65.

Let formula_55 be a fixed non-negative real number. Define
formula_56

By the binomial theorem,
formula_57
(using &quot;x&quot; ≥ 0 to obtain the final inequality) so that:
formula_58
One must use lim sup because it is not known if &quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot; converges. 

For the other inequality, by the above expression for &quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot;, if 2 ≤ &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;, we have: 
formula_59

Fix &quot;m&quot;, and let &quot;n&quot; approach infinity. Then
formula_60
(again, one must use lim inf because it is not known if &quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot; converges). Now, take the above inequality, let &quot;m&quot; approach infinity, and put it together with the other inequality to obtain:
formula_61
so that
formula_62

This equivalence can be extended to the negative real numbers by noting formula_63 and taking the limit as n goes to infinity.

=== Characterization 1 ⇔ characterization 3 ===

Here, the natural logarithm function is defined in terms of a definite integral as above. By the first part of fundamental theorem of calculus,
formula_64

Besides, formula_65

Now, let &quot;x&quot; be any fixed real number, and let
formula_66

, which implies that , where is in the sense of definition 3. We have
formula_67

Here, the continuity of ln(&quot;y&quot;) is used, which follows from the continuity of 1/&quot;t&quot;:
formula_68

Here, the result ln&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;n&quot;ln&quot;a&quot; has been used. This result can be established for &quot;n&quot; a natural number by induction, or using integration by substitution. (The extension to real powers must wait until &quot;ln&quot; and &quot;exp&quot; have been established as inverses of each other, so that &quot;a&quot;&quot;b&quot; can be defined for real &quot;b&quot; as &quot;e&quot;&quot;b&quot; ln&quot;a&quot;.)

=== Characterization 1 ⇔ characterization 4 ===
Let formula_73 denote the solution to the initial value problem formula_74. Applying the simplest form of Euler&#x27;s method with increment formula_75 and sample points formula_76 gives the recursive formula:formula_77This recursion is immediately solved to give the approximate value formula_78, and since Euler&#x27;s Method is known to converge to the exact solution, we have:formula_79

=== Characterization 2 ⇔ characterization 4 ===
Let n be a non-negative integer. In the sense of definition 4 and by induction, formula_80.

Therefore formula_81

Using Taylor series,
formula_82 This shows that definition 4 implies definition 2.

In the sense of definition 2,
formula_83

Besides, formula_84 This shows that definition 2 implies definition 4.

=== Characterization 2 ⇒ characterization 5 ===

In the sense of definition 2, the equation formula_85 follows from the term-by-term manipulation of power series justified by uniform convergence, and the resulting equality of coefficients is just the Binomial theorem. Furthermore: 
formula_86

=== Characterization 3 ⇔ characterization 4 ===
Characterisation 3 first defines the natural logarithm:formula_87then formula_88 as the inverse function with formula_89. Then by the Chain rule:formula_90i.e. formula_91. Finally, formula_92, so formula_93. That is, formula_94 is the unique solution of the initial value problem formula_95, formula_96 of characterization 4.

Conversely, assume formula_97 has formula_91 and formula_99, and define formula_100 as its inverse function with formula_101 and formula_102. Then:formula_103i.e. formula_104. By the Fundamental theorem of calculus,formula_105

=== Characterization 5 ⇒ characterization 4 ===
The conditions and imply both conditions in characterization 4. Indeed, one gets the initial condition by dividing both sides of the equation
formula_106
by , and the condition that follows from the condition that and the definition of the derivative as follows:
formula_107

=== Characterization 5 ⇒ characterization 4 ===

Assum characterization 5, the multiplicative property together with the initial condition formula_108 imply that: formula_109

=== Characterization 5 ⇔ characterization 6 ===
By inductively applying the multiplication rule, we get:
formula_110
and thus
formula_111
for formula_112. Then the condition formula_16 means that formula_114, so formula_27 by definition. 

Also, any of the regularity conditions of definition 5 imply that formula_116 is continuous at all real formula_30 (see below). The converse is similar.

=== Characterization 5 ⇒ characterization 6 ===
Let formula_116 be a Lebesgue-integrable non-zero function satisfying the mulitiplicative property formula_14 with formula_120. Following Hewitt and Stromberg, exercise 18.46, we will prove that Lebesgue-integrability implies continuity. This is sufficient to imply formula_121 according to characterization 6, arguing as above.

First, a few elementary properties:
# If formula_116 is nonzero anywhere (say at formula_123), then it is non-zero everywhere. Proof: formula_124 implies formula_125.
# formula_126. Proof: formula_127 and formula_116 is non-zero.
# formula_129. Proof: formula_130.
# If formula_116 is continuous anywhere (say at formula_123), then it is continuous everywhere. Proof: formula_133 as formula_134 by continuity at formula_135.

The second and third properties mean that it is sufficient to prove formula_33 for positive &quot;x&quot;.

Sinceformula_116 is a Lebesgue-integrable function, then we may define formula_138. It then follows that
formula_139

Since formula_116 is nonzero, some can be chosen such that formula_141 and solve for formula_116 in the above expression. Therefore:
formula_143

The final expression must go to zero as formula_134 since formula_145 and formula_146 is continuous. It follows that formula_116 is continuous.

<text>Thomas Watt Gregory (November 6, 1861February 26, 1933) was an American politician and lawyer. He was a progressive and attorney who served as US Attorney General from 1914 to 1919 under US President Woodrow Wilson.

==Early life==
Gregory was born in Crawfordsville, Mississippi. He graduated from the Webb School (Bell Buckle, Tennessee) in 1881 and Southwestern Presbyterian University, today known as Rhodes College, in 1883, and was a special student at the University of Virginia. Gregory entered the University of Texas at Austin in 1884 and graduated a year later with a degree in law.

He began the practice of law in Austin in 1885 and served as a regent of the University of Texas for eight years. Gregory Gymnasium was named in honor of his efforts to provide an adequate exercise facility for the students and faculty of the university. He declined appointment as assistant attorney general of Texas in 1892 and an appointment to the state bench in 1896, but he &quot;gained experience as a trust prosecutor as a special counsel for the state of Texas.&quot;

He embraced the progressive rhetoric of the early 20th century by his condemnations of &quot;plutocratic power,&quot; &quot;predatory wealth,&quot; and &quot;the greed of the party spoilsmen&quot; and participated in Edward M. House&#x27;s Democratic coalition.

Gregory was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention at St. Louis and at state delegate at-large at the Baltimore convention. He was appointed Special Assistant to the US Attorney General in 1913 in the investigation and proceedings against the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company.

==Attorney General==

In 1914, US President Woodrow Wilson appointed him US Attorney General, an office that Gregory held until 1919. Despite a continuing commitment to progressive reform, Gregory provoked enormous controversy performance as attorney general because of his collaboration with Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson and others in orchestrating a campaign to crush domestic dissent during World War I.

Gregory helped frame the Espionage and Sedition Acts, which compromised the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and press, and he lobbied for their passage. He encouraged extralegal surveillance by the American Protective League and directed the federal prosecutions of more than 2000 opponents of the war: &quot;By 1918 the Attorney General was able to declare, &#x27;It is safe to say that never in its history has this country been so thoroughly policed.&#x27;&quot;

In 1916, Wilson wanted to appoint Gregory to the US Supreme Court, but Gregory declined the offer because of his impaired hearing, his eagerness to participate in Wilson&#x27;s re-election campaign, and his belief that he lacked the necessary temperament to be a judge. He was a member of Wilson&#x27;s Second Industrial Conference in 1919 and 1920.

==Death and legacy==
During a trip to New York to confer with Franklin Roosevelt, Gregory contracted pneumonia and died. He is buried in Austin.

His portrait was painted in 1917 by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862–1947) and hangs in the Department of Justice in Washington, DC.

<text>The Allright (known in Germany as the Allreit and outside of Germany as the Vindec-Special) was a German automobile manufactured from 1908 to 1913 at the Cologne-Lindenthal factory that produced Allright, Tiger, Roland, and Vindec-Special bicycles and motorcycles.

The first Allright-Mobil of 1908 was offered with an air-cooled v-twin engine and four wire wheels. It weighed and could reach .

From 1910 an improved model was offered, available as two-seater Runabout or delivery truck. Its 960 cc v-twin engine delivered at 1300 rpm. A rear-wheel-drive vehicle, its axle was driven via a conical leather clutch, a three-speed transmission, and chains. The vehicle weighed and could attain a speed of . It was sold for 3,000 German gold marks.

==Vindec-Special==
In 1906 the Motor Cycling Club&#x27;s gold medal was awarded to those who could complete the 391-mile journey from London to Edinburgh in under 24 hours. The fastest finisher was Tom Woodman (22h 38m) riding a 5-horsepower Vindec-Special motor-bicycle. W. H. &#x27;Billy&#x27; Wells in second was also riding a Vindec-Special.

Vindec-Specials were also placed in the 1907 Isle of Man TT Twin Cylinder race, Billy Wells coming second and Arnold Dent fourth.

<doc id="853184" wikidata="Q7781245" url="?curid=853184" title="Themeparks LLC">
<text>Themeparks LLC, later known as Kentucky Kingdom LLLP, was an American company that operated two amusement parks. The company was originally formed as &quot;227 Plus One&quot; in the late 1980s by Ed Hart and is based in Louisville, Kentucky. Themeparks&#x27; first park was Kentucky Kingdom, which it bought in 1989 and sold to Premier Parks (now Six Flags) in 1997. Themeparks subsequently operated Magic Springs Theme Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas from 2000 to 2008 before selling it to PARC Management. Themeparks LLC repurchased Kentucky Kingdom in 2013 and operated the amusement park from 2014 to 2020. In February 2021, Kentucky Kingdom was sold to Herschend Family Entertainment.

==History==
===The first decade (1989–2008)===

In early April 1989, businessman Ed Hart bought the then-bankrupt Kentucky Kingdom amusement park&#x27;s operating rights in a contract with the Kentucky State Fair Board. Hart then turned the park around and reopened it for the 1990 season. During this time, Hart founded Themeparks LLC specifically for the project.

On September 26, 1997, Themeparks LLC announced that Kentucky Kingdom would be sold to Premier Parks for $64 million, the deal was finalized on November 7. In 1998, Premier Parks purchased Six Flags Theme Parks from Time Warner, Kentucky Kingdom became Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom on June 21, 1998.

In the late 1990s, Hart was approached by Fitraco, a Belgian company, to reopen Magic Springs amusement park in Arkansas. Hart then reassembled and restarted Themeparks LLC, only one year after it dissolved after the sale of Kentucky Kingdom to Premier Parks (now Six Flags). Hart and Themeparks LLC then reopened the park on May 27, 2000, after five years being closed. During Themeparks LLC&#x27;s operations at Magic Springs, attendance grew to new highs, after the additions of Crystal Falls Water Park and the Timberwood Amphitheater.

In October 2002, the company made a bid for VisionLand, a theme park in Bessemer, Alabama, but the price was too high.

Themeparks LLC sold Magic Springs and Crystal Falls to PARC Management in June 2008. Themeparks LLC then dissolved for a second time afterwards.

===Return to Kentucky Kingdom (2010–2021)===

In 2010, Themeparks LLC temporarily renamed itself to KK Redevelopment LLC to buy back Kentucky Kingdom from the state of Kentucky. In late 2011, The Kentucky State Fair Board ended their plans with KK Redevelopment LLC to reopen Kentucky Kingdom, after they failed to reach a lease agreement by a September 30 deadline. On October 19, 2012, KK Redevelopment LLC submitted a new proposal to reopen the park, the proposal included $50 million in startup funding and $70 million over the term of a lease with the state.

On January 24, 2013, The Fair Board approved the proposal from KK Redevelopment LLC and Ed Hart to reopen Kentucky Kingdom. The park (along with Hurricane Bay) was set to reopen on May 24, 2014, with new thrill rides and a bigger water park. Kentucky Kingdom and Hurricane Bay is now open with Themeparks LLC as the new operators. They spent over 50 million dollars to bring back Kentucky Kingdom and during the first year of operation. Theme Park LLC added a $7 million roller coaster named Lightning Run and doubled the size of the water park. Though Themeparks LLC does operate Kentucky Kingdom, the company was commonly referred to as Kentucky Kingdom LLLP when relating to Kentucky Kingdom.

On February 23, 2021, at a press conference attended by Kentucky governor Andy Beshear and Louisville mayor Greg Fischer, it was announced that the operating rights to Kentucky Kingdom had been sold to Herschend Family Entertainment, a Georgia-based company that operated three theme parks.

===Proposed amusement parks===

After selling Kentucky Kingdom to Premier Parks in 1997, Hart began planning to build a brand new amusement park near Seattle, Washington, which was to be called &quot;The Great Northwest Theme Park&quot;. The park was to be 100 acres and be located in the town of Lakewood. It was planned to open in the Spring of 2002. However, the project was scrapped for unknown reasons.

In the early 2000s, Hart and Themeparks LLC began developing a new theme and water park, which was to be called Thrillopolis, and to be located in Nashville, Tennessee. Nashville&#x27;s only amusement park, Opryland USA, had previously closed permanently several years prior in 1997 and was replaced by a shopping mall in 2000. The closest amusement park to Nashville at this time was Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. On June 17, 2002, Hart announced that Thrillopolis would not be built in Nashville, due to funding issues with the local government. In late 2002, Themeparks LLC did try to find property for Thrillopolis in Wilson County, Tennessee, even signing an exclusivity agreement with Wilson County on October 15, 2002. However, by the mid-2000s, plans to open Thrillopolis had been canceled.

<text>The Allstate is an American automobile offered for sale through Sears, Roebuck and Co. during the 1952 and 1953 model years. It was a rebadged version of the Henry J, a car manufactured by the Kaiser-Frazer company from 1950 through 1954.

==History==
The Sears retail chain had previously marketed vehicles made by the Lincoln Motor Car Works under the name &quot;Sears Motor Buggy&quot; between 1908 and 1912.

These horseless carriages were of the &quot;high-wheeler&quot; variety with large wagon-type wheels. Their high ground clearance was well-suited to muddy, wagon-rutted country roads. Customers were accustomed to mail ordering through the Sears catalog, and the Sears Motor Buggy could be delivered to the nearest railroad siding. A wood crate would arrive, and the customer had to install the wheels and add oil to the engine, but Sears deemed the product not profitable at $370 and was dropped from the catalog after 3,500 orders.

==Development==
The Allstate was the brainchild of Henry J. Kaiser, who saw distribution by Sears as another means to mass-market his slow-selling &quot;Henry J&quot; two-door sedan, introduced in 1950. The independent automakers at the time, such as Kaiser-Frazer, could compete with the vast dealer networks marketing the cars made by the &quot;Big Four&quot; auto companies at the time. The catalog and retail chain was also interested in working out a deal.

Starting in 1945, Sears executive, Theodore Houser, discussed the idea with Kaiser-Frazer. Allstate automobiles were planned to be built on the senior Kaiser platforms. The concept came together after Kaiser-Frazer developed the affordable Henry J model. 

Thus, after three years of negotiations between Kaiser-Frazer and Sears, the production of Allstate was announced on November 20, 1951, by Sears merchandising vice president, Theodore V. Houser, and Kaiser-Frazer administrative vice president, Eugene Trefethen. The three-year delay was also partly due to resistance from existing Kaiser-Frazer dealerships fearing competition with Sears.
The Allstate was essentially a Henry J, but with several differences that included Allstate badges on the hood and rear deck, a more upscale interior of Saran plaid or occasionally leather or smooth vinyl, unique hubcaps/wheel covers, horn buttons and instrument bezels, a locking trunk lid, distinctive engine color (blue), custom armrests and sun visors, revised door locks and keys, and special parking and taillamp assemblies. The cars came finished in Sears-blue paint. Most notably, the Allstate featured a unique two-bar grille and jet-plane hood ornament designed by Alex Tremulis, who had come to Kaiser-Frazer from the Tucker Corporation. Tremulis described it as a &quot;rush job&quot; including the Allstate logo with an outline map of the United States.

==Production==
The Allstate was built by Kaiser-Frazer in Willow Run, Michigan (and after 1953 by Kaiser-Willys in Toledo, Ohio) and was based on Kaiser&#x27;s compact Henry J. One body style was offered, a fastback two-door sedan in two trim and equipment levels, Series 4 and Series 6.

For 1952, the Series 4 came in the Model 111 Standard (the best seller at US1,486), and Model 113 DeLuxe ($1,539) trim versions, and was also available in an austere Model 110 Basic version for $1,395. The Series 6 Basic was priced at $1,594 and the better-trimmed, swift Model 115 DeLuxe was offered at $1,693. (The Standard was not offered in the Series 6.) The cars had a wheelbase. The marketing slogan was &quot;Your one brand new car for &#x27;52! Allstate!&quot;

No appearance changes were made for 1953, but Allstate cars weighed as much as more than their 1952 counterparts.

Sears dropped marketing the Allstate Basic models. Thus, prices increased substantially; the entry-level Series 4 Standard Model 210 sold for $1,528 and the DeLuxe Model 213 for $1,589. The Series 6 was now only offered in the upscale DeLuxe Model 215 version at $1,785 and was the most popular Allstate that year.

The standard Allstate interior material was made from tightly twisted strands of paper that were woven together and then coated in plastic, which proved to be unusually durable and attractive. This enhancement eliminated the need for seat covers. Aftermarket seat covers were popular accessories in the 1950s; many were made of this material to provide durability.

Unlike early Henry Js, which were built without trunk lids to reduce costs, the Allstates featured a regular opening trunk lid.

Series 4 cars used an L-head I4 engine producing , and the Series 6 was powered by a L-head I6 rated at , both built by Willys. A three-speed manual transmission was standard, with overdrive available for $104 extra.

One mechanical difference between Allstate and Henry J was that Allstates were equipped with Allstate-brand tires, tubes, spark plugs, and batteries, all with their own Sears &quot;Triple Guarantee&quot; warranties.

Initially, the Allstate was offered only in the south and southwest United States, with plans to expand distribution as demand for the product grew. Sears locations selling Allstates included Baytown, Texas; Beaumont, Texas; Birmingham, Alabama; Dallas, Texas; Fayetteville, North Carolina; Houston, Texas; Jackson, Mississippi; Knoxville, Tennessee; Little Rock, Arkansas; Lubbock, Texas; Memphis, Tennessee; Norfolk, Virginia; Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Portsmouth, Virginia; Richmond, Virginia; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Waco, Texas.

While some Sears outlets tried to stock at least one sample of the car, most were built on demand by Kaiser-Frazer, which made delivery to the store where they were sold. Kaiser-Frazer urged its dealers to service Allstate cars when asked. Many Kaiser-Frazer dealers were displeased to see &quot;their cars&quot; sold by another outlet, especially since the Allstate carried more standard equipment, yet sold at a lower price than the Henry J.

Sears marketed the car as &quot;the lowest-priced full-sized sedan on the U.S. market.&quot; However, Sears did not accept trade-ins from Allstate buyers, and there may have been a reluctance to buy a car through a department store where service was thought to be questionable. The lack of a trade-in program also proved to be a serious impediment to the sale of Graham-Bradley tractors from Graham-Paige Motors by Sears in the late 1930s.

==Epilogue==
A total of 2,363 Allstates were sold during two model years before Sears discontinued the marque: 1,566 during 1952 and 797 in 1953. Kaiser discontinued the Henry J the following year.

The Allstate has become a car desired by collectors as reflected in the few remaining examples in original condition and by their current market values. As of 2022, a restored 1953 Allstate was on display in the corporate building of Allstate in Northbrook, IL.

<text>In Western esotericism, left-hand path and right-hand path are two opposing approaches to magic. Various groups engaged with the occult and ceremonial magic use the terminology to establish a dichotomy, broadly simplified as (malicious) black magic on the left and (benevolent) white magic on the right. Others approach the left/right paths as different kinds of workings, without connotations of good or bad magical actions. Still others treat the paths as fundamental schemes, connected with external divinities on the right, contrasted with self-deification on the left.

The terms have their origins in tantra: the right-hand path (RHP, or &quot;dakṣiṇācāra&quot;) applied to magical groups that follow specific ethical codes and adopt social convention, while the left-hand path (LHP, or &quot;vāmācāra&quot;) adopts the opposite attitude, breaking taboos and abandoning set morality. Contemporary occultists such as Peter J. Carroll have stressed that both paths can be followed by a magical practitioner, as essentially they have the same goals.

== Terminology ==

=== Right-hand path ===
The right-hand path is commonly thought to refer to magical or religious groups which adhere to a certain set of characteristics:
* They divide the concepts of mind, body and spirit into three separate, albeit interrelated, entities.
* They adhere to a specific moral code and a belief in some form of judgement, such as karma or the Threefold Law.

The occultist Dion Fortune considered Abrahamic religions to be RHP.

=== Left-hand path ===
Historian Dave Evans studied self-professed followers of the left-hand path in the early 21st century, making several observations about their practices:
*They often reject societal convention and the status quo, which some suggest is in a search for spiritual freedom. As a part of this, LHP followers embrace magical techniques that would traditionally be viewed as taboo, for instance using sex magic or embracing Satanic imagery. As Mogg Morgan wrote, the &quot;breaking of taboos makes magic more potent and can lead to reintegration and liberation, [for example] the eating of meat in a vegetarian community can have the same liberating effect as anal intercourse in a sexually inhibited society.&quot;
* They often question religious or moral dogma, instead adhering to forms of personal anarchism.
* They often embrace sexuality and incorporate it into magical ritual.

== History of the terms ==

=== Tantra and Madame Blavatsky ===
&quot;Vāmācāra&quot; is a Sanskrit term meaning &quot;left-handed attainment&quot;. The converse term is &quot;dakshinachara&quot;. The Western use of the terms &quot;left-hand path&quot; and &quot;right-hand path&quot; originated with Madame Blavatsky, a 19th-century occultist who founded the Theosophical Society. She had travelled across parts of southern Asia and gave accounts of having met with many mystics and magical practitioners in India and Tibet. She developed the term &quot;left-hand path&quot; as a translation of the term &quot;vamachara&quot;, an Indian Tantric practice that emphasised the breaking of Hindu societal taboos by having sexual intercourse in ritual, drinking alcohol, eating meat and assembling in graveyards, as a part of the spiritual practice. The term &quot;vamachara&quot; literally meant &quot;the left-hand way&quot; in Sanskrit, and it was from this that Blavatsky first coined the term.

Returning to Europe, Blavatsky began using the term. It was relatively easy for her to associate &quot;left&quot; with evil in many European countries, where it already has had an association with evil and bad luck since the Classical Latin era. As the historian Dave Evans noted, homosexuals were referred to as &quot;left-handed&quot;, while in Protestant nations Roman Catholics were called &quot;left-footers&quot;.

=== Adoption into the western esoteric tradition ===
In New York, Madame Blavatsky founded the Theosophical Society with several other people in 1875. She set about writing several books, including &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot; (1877) in which she introduced the terms &quot;left-hand path&quot; and &quot;right-hand path&quot;, firmly stating that she herself followed the RHP, and that followers of the LHP were practitioners of black magic who were a threat to society. The occult community soon picked up on her newly introduced duality, which, according to historian Dave Evans, &quot;had not been known before&quot; in the Western Esoteric Tradition. For instance, Dion Fortune, founder of the magical group the Society of the Inner Light, also took the side of the RHP, making the claim that followers of the LHP were homosexuals and that Indian servants might use malicious magical rites devoted to the goddess Kali against their European masters.

Aleister Crowley further altered and popularized the term in certain occult circles, referring to a &quot;brother of the left-hand path&quot;, or a &quot;black brother&quot;, as one who failed to attain the grade of Magister Templi in Crowley&#x27;s system of ceremonial magic. Crowley also referred to the left-hand path when describing the point at which the Adeptus Exemptus chooses to cross the Abyss, which is the location of Choronzon and the illusory eleventh Sephira, which is Da&#x27;ath or Knowledge. In this example, the adept must surrender all, including the guidance of his Holy Guardian Angel, and leap into the Abyss. If his accumulated karma is sufficient, and if he has been utterly thorough in his own self-destruction, he becomes a &quot;babe of the abyss&quot;, arising as a Star in the Crowleyan system. On the other hand, if he retains some fragment of ego, or if he fears to cross, he then becomes encysted. The layers of his self, which he could have shed in the Abyss, ossify around him. He is then titled a &quot;brother of the left-hand path&quot;, who will eventually be broken up and disintegrated against his will, since he failed to choose voluntary disintegration. Crowley associated all this with &quot;Mary, a blasphemy against Babalon&quot;, and with the celibacy of Christian clergy.

A figure Fortune considered to be a follower of the LHP was Arthur Edward Waite, who did not recognise these terms, and acknowledged that they were newly introduced and that in any case he believed the terms LHP and RHP to be distinct from black and white magic. However, despite Waite&#x27;s attempts to distinguish the two, the equation of the LHP with black magic was propagated more widely in the fiction of Dennis Wheatley; Wheatley also conflated the two with Satanism and also the political ideology of communism, which he viewed as a threat to traditional British society.

===Later 20th and 21st centuries===
In the latter half of the 20th century various groups arose that self-professedly described themselves as LHP but did not consider themselves as practicing black magic. In 1975, Kenneth Grant, a student of Aleister Crowley, explained in &quot;Cults of the Shadow&quot; that he and his group, the Typhonian Order, practiced the LHP. Grant&#x27;s usage takes meaning from its roots in eastern Tantra; Grant states that it is about challenging taboos, but that it should be used in conjunction with the RHP to achieve balance.

<text>Tamer Nafar (, ; born June 6, 1979) is a Palestinian rapper, actor, screenwriter and social activist of Israeli citizenship. He is the leader and a founding member of DAM, the first Palestinian hip hop group.

== Early life ==
Nafar was born to Fawzi Nafar and Nadia Awadi. He grew up in poverty in Lod, a mixed Arab-Israeli city in Israel, which was a major hub for drug smuggling and crime.

Tamer discovered hip-hop at age 17, when he began learning English by listening to Tupac and translating his lyrics to Arabic using an English-Arabic dictionary.

== Career ==
Tamer recorded his first single &quot;Untouchable&quot;, a reference to &quot;The Untouchables&quot; movie.

In 1998, Tamer released his first EP &quot;Stop Selling Drugs&quot;, featuring his younger brother Suhell.

=== DAM ===
In 2000, their friend Mahmood Jreri joined the Nafar brothers to establish DAM, the first Palestinian hip-hop group.

The trio named themselves &quot;Da Arab MCs&quot; to create the acronyms DAM, a word that means &quot;lasting&quot; or &quot;persisting&quot; in Arabic and &quot;blood&quot; in Hebrew (דם). In an interview for &quot;Democracy Now&quot; (2008), Tamer said that the group&#x27;s name suggested “eternal blood, like we will stay here forever,” evoking a politics of resilience and survival (or دام - &quot;sumood&quot;, in Arabic).

The group members are the grandchildren of those who experienced the Nakba and the children of those who mobilized the Arab minority in Israel in the 1970s and 1980s. This generation is challenging the insults to Palestinian identity and advocates Palestinian self-determination while objecting to racism and inequality.
DAM is notable for their ability to rap in English, Arabic and Hebrew. The group first rapped in English and then in Hebrew as the words flowed better this way.
DAM understood that their potential for meaningful social impact depends on their ability to express their message in Arabic, Hebrew and English, drawing upon vernacular phrases, slang, obscenities and indigenous references to each cultural frame. In this way, DAM is able to reach disparate audiences.

On September 3, 2000, Tamer&#x27;s friend &quot;Booba&quot; (Hussam Abu Gazazae) was killed during a drive-by shooting, an incident that drove Tamer to record his first protest song with a political reference, despite the fact that his friend had been killed by an Arab. A cover of Abd al Majeed Abdalla&#x27;s song &quot;Ya Tayeb al Galb&quot;, the song was called &quot;Booba&quot; and featured Ibrahim Sakallah on the hook.

In the outbreak of the Second Intifada in October 2000, Tamer and Mahmood decided to write their first direct political song &quot;Posheem Hapim me Peshaa&quot; (Innocent Criminals). It was recorded over an instrumental of &quot;Hail Mary&quot; by Tupac and featured lines such as &quot;when Jews protest, the cops use clubs / when Arabs protest, the cops take their souls&quot; and &quot;if it is a democracy how come I&#x27;m not mentioned in your anthem&quot; followed by the chorus &quot;before you judge me, before you understand me, walk in my shoes, and you will hurt your feet, because we are criminals, innocent criminals.&quot;

The song created controversy in the Israeli media and put DAM in conflict with some of their fellow Israeli rappers such as Subliminal. Much of the subsequent fall-out was recorded in the documentary &quot;Channels of Rage&quot;. Despite the controversy, the song was later remixed by Israeli rock musician Aviv Geffen and American-Israeli director Udi Aloni made a music video for the song in 2003.

=== 2003: &quot;Channels of Rage&quot; ===
In 2003 Israeli film director Anat Halachmi released the documentary &quot;Channels of Rage&quot;, which won the Wolgin Award for best documentary at the 2003 Jerusalem Film Festival. The film follows Tamer Nafar and DAM on one side and the right-wing Zionist rapper Kobi Shimoni (Subliminal and the Shadow) on the other. Meeting in a dark alley in Tel Aviv, the groups nearly come to blows over recent comments made by Tamer and Shimoni. Once collaborative and cherishing, the relationship quickly dissolved as each began to embody a political ideology following the collapse of the 2000 Camp David Summit and the beginning of the Second Intifada. Coming to terms with the violence on the streets of Tel Aviv and Jenin, both artists retreated from their once close relationship, based on a mutual love of hip-hop, into nationalism.

=== 2004: The Born Here campaign ===
Tamer uses music and art as a tool for activism. In 2004, DAM was invited by the Shateel organization to produce songs discussing discrimination and poverty in mixed Arab-Israeli cities, commenting on Israeli demolition of Palestinian houses and the dangerous entrance into Lod, which required residents to cross eight train tracks to reach the city. DAM collaborated with a local R&amp;B singer and created the song &quot;Born Here&quot; as a reference to a popular Israeli song by the duo Dats and Datsa whose chorus&#x27; lyrics begin &quot;I was born here, my children were born here, and this is where I built my house with my two hands&quot;. DAM changed this to &quot;I was born here, my grandparents were born here, and this is where you destroyed our houses with your hands&quot;. Due to the campaign&#x27;s success, the Israeli government built a bridge above the train tracks for safer crossing and allowed DAM to tour Israel discussing their cause.

=== 2006: Debut album &quot;Ihda&quot; ===

After touring the world and releasing number one singles on Arab charts, DAM became the first Palestinian hip hop group to release an album with a major label after signing with EMI Arabia. The album, &quot;Ihda″&quot;, was released in 2006. DAM also signed with the French booking agency 3D Family to tour music festivals around the world promoting the album, visiting the Sundance film festival, Womad, Doha DIFF (Doha International film festival), Dubai Film Festival, Trinity International Hip Hop Festival USA, Vine Rock, Taybeh Beer Festival Palestine, and Casa Festival Morocco, where they shared the stage with internationally known artists including GZA of the Wutang Clan, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Dead Prez, Chuck D of Public Enemy, Pharaoh Monch, Rachid Taha, Ahmad al Khoury, Immortal Technique, and others. The album included 15 tracks, including some number one hits. Though mainly about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the album was also notable for being the first Arab rap album to discuss women&#x27;s rights. The album&#x27;s song &quot;Hurriyet Unta&quot; (freedom for my sisters), features Safa&#x27; Hathoot, the first female Palestinian rapper, criticizes the oppression of women along with the oppression of the Palestinians.

=== 2008: &quot;Slingshot Hip-Hop&quot; ===
In 2008 &quot;Slingshot Hip Hop&quot; – a film about Palestinian Hip Hop by Jackie Salloum was released. Slingshot Hip-Hop is a performative type of documentary that stresses subjective experience and emotional response to the world. It talks about personal stories that might be considered unconventional, although perhaps poetic and experimental. &quot;Slingshot Hip Hop&quot; braids together the stories of young Palestinians living in Gaza, the West Bank and inside Israel as they discover hip hop and employ it as a tool to surmount divisions imposed by occupation and poverty. Following the debut in the Sundance film festival, the film got a lot of attention and won many prizes, and featured guest appearances by international artists such as Chuck D from Public Enemy and Afrika Bambaataa.

=== 2012: Second album: &quot;Dabke on the Moon&quot; ===
In 2012, DAM released their second official album, &quot;Dabke on the Moon&quot;.

The main producer was Tamer and Suhell&#x27;s cousin, Nabil Nafar, a Danish-Palestinian producer who came to Lod and worked with them on six tracks.

In the track &quot;A letter from the cell&quot;, DAM worked with the classical oud players Trio Joubran and Lebanese percussionist Bachar Khalife (the son of legendary composer and oud player Marcel Khalife). The result is a melancholic, non-traditional hip-hop song heavily influenced by classical Arabic composition and instruments.

=== 2013: Room No. 4 ===
In 2013, Tamer Nafar directed the photography campaign Room No. 4 illustrated the reality faced by the children when arrested and detained and is based on the children&#x27;s testimonies in the report. &quot;Room No. 4&quot; is an interrogation room in the Russian Compound–the main Israeli police office in Jerusalem–where Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, including children, are interrogated. to protest child arrests in East Jerusalem. The campaign

=== 2014: &quot;#Who_U_R&quot; ===
In 2014, Tamer Nafar and DAM released the music video &quot;#Who_U_R&quot;. The video was directed by Oscar-nominated Palestinian filmmaker Scandar Copti. &quot;#Who_U_R&quot; was written in response to the rape of a 16-year-old Texan teenager Jada, whose assault was recorded, shared, and mocked on social media in 2014.

Tamer stated about the video that, &quot;Women&#x27;s struggle is beyond the Middle East. It’s an international struggle.&quot; He discusses how the concept was to &quot;take the social part of my individual progress and to take my social issues to the international stage.&quot;

The song generated a Twitter campaign throughout the Middle East. The hashtag #Who_You_R encouraged men to send in photos of themselves doing housework as a way to break gender norms and support women.

=== 2016: &quot;Junction 48&quot; ===
Tamer starred in the feature film &quot;Junction 48&quot; directed by Udi Aloni and written by Nafar and Oren Moverman. Nafar&#x27;s youth and early years as a rapper formed the basis for the semi-autobiographical movie. The film won the Audience Award at the Berlin International Film Festival, Best International Film at the Tribeca Film Festival and 2 awards at the Slovakia Art Film Festival for Best Film and Best Male Actor (Tamer).

As an actor and a writer, Tamer&#x27;s work has appeared in numerous stage plays in Israel/Palestine and Europe. He has performed alongside veteran Palestinian directors Norman Issa and Nizar Zoabi in Anton Chekhov’s plays.

== Controversial statements ==
Nafar performed at a joint conference between the University of North Carolina and Duke University known as Conflict Over Gaza: People, Politics, and Possibilities. During Nafar&#x27;s performance he said &quot;I know it might sound [like] R&amp;B stuff, but don&#x27;t think of Rihanna when you sing it, don&#x27;t think of Beyoncé. Think of Mel Gibson. Go that anti-Semitic. Let&#x27;s try it together because I need your help. I cannot be anti-Semitic alone.&quot; Gibson is an actor and filmmaker who has said &quot;the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.&quot;

UNC&#x27;s Interim Chancellor, Kevin Guskiewicz, condemned the &quot;disturbing&quot; language in Nafar&#x27;s performance, while members of the audience said that Nafar&#x27;s comment was a sarcastic remark meant to mock the idea that people fighting for Palestinian liberation must be anti-Semitic.

<text>Edward Ball Knobel (21 October 1841 – 25 July 1930) was an English businessman and amateur astronomer. He was born in London, England.

He started to study law but his love of geology made him change to the Government School of Mines (now part of Imperial College London) in 1861. In 1862, he changed his career again, starting to work for Bass &amp; Co. at Burton upon Trent as an analytical chemist in the brewery department. He rose to become a manager and Head Brewer. He then became a manager of a Courtauld&#x27;s silk factory at Bocking in 1875. His final position was with the Ilford Photographic Company.

In 1872, he purchased an 8.5 inch reflecting telescope to further his interest in astronomy. His work on a publication about the chronology of star catalogues in 1875 let him to study the work of early Arab astronomers and learn some Arabic and Persian. He then prepared a new edition of the star catalogue in the Almagest using all available sources in Greek, Arabic and Latin. After a long collaboration with C. H. F. Peters, a final collated version was published in 1915. In 1917 he published a translation of Ulugh Beg&#x27;s star catalogue. He was President of both the British Astronomical Association and the Royal Astronomical Society (1892–1893 and 1900–1901).

A crater on Mars was named in his honour.

==Family==
One of Knobel&#x27;s daughters, Emily Maud Knobel, was a Fellow of the Zoological Society and an expert on parrots, particularly their care in captivity.

<doc id="853212" wikidata="Q2705899" url="?curid=853212" title="Red vs. Blue">
<text>Red vs. Blue, often abbreviated as RvB, is an American web series created by Burnie Burns with his production company Rooster Teeth. The show is based on the setting of the military science fiction first-person shooter series and media franchise &quot;Halo&quot;. It is distributed through Rooster Teeth&#x27;s website, as well as on DVD, Blu-ray, and formerly on the El Rey Network and Netflix. The series centers on two opposite teams fighting in an ostensible civil war—shown to actually be a live fire exercise for elite soldiers—in the middle of Blood Gulch, a desolate box canyon, in a parody of first-person shooter video games, military life, and science fiction films.

Initially intended to be a short series of six to eight episodes, the project quickly and unexpectedly achieved significant popularity following its premiere on April 1, 2003. The series consists of nineteen seasons and seven mini-series. &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; was the second longest-running animated webseries of all time, behind &quot;Homestar Runner&quot;, until its conclusion. The series concluded with the feature-length movie &quot;Red vs. Blue: Restoration&quot;, originally intended to be the final season prior to the shutdown of Rooster Teeth, which was released on May 7, 2024.

&quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; emerged from Burnie Burns&#x27; voice-over gameplay videos of Bungie&#x27;s FPS video game &quot;&quot;. The series is primarily produced using the machinima technique of synchronizing video footage from a game to pre-recorded dialogue and other audio. Footage is mostly from the multiplayer modes of &quot;&quot; and its followups on the Xbox consoles.

The series has been generally well-received. Praised for its originality, the series has won four awards at film festivals held by the Academy of Machinima Arts &amp; Sciences. It has also won the award for &quot;Best Animated Web Series&quot; from the International Academy of Web Television (IAWTV). It also won a 2013 Webby Award for Animation, as well as nominated in 2014. It has been credited with bringing new popularity to Machinima, helping it to gain more mainstream exposure, and attracting more people to the art form. Graham Leggat, former director of communications for Lincoln Center&#x27;s film society, described &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; as &quot;truly as sophisticated as Samuel Beckett&quot;. Rooster Teeth has created episodes, some under commission from Microsoft, for special events. The voice actors from &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; appear in cameos for &quot;Halo 3&quot; and &quot;Halo 4&quot;. The series is also referenced in &quot;&quot; and &quot;Halo Infinite&quot;.

==Overview==
The &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; storyline spans nineteen full-length seasons and seven mini-series. Rooster Teeth periodically releases self-referential public service announcements and holiday-themed videos, which are generally unrelated to the main storyline and not considered canon. In these videos, the members of both teams are actors who claim to be from &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;.

Although the visual background of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; was primarily taken from the &quot;Halo&quot; series, Rooster Teeth consciously limits connections to the &quot;Halo&quot; fictional universe. A special video made for E3 2003 portrays Master Chief, &quot;Halo&quot;&#x27;s protagonist, as a larger-than-life member of the army, and the &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; trailer and first episode establish that the series is set between the events of the first two games. Beyond these references, the storyline is independent, a decision that, according to Burns, is intended to increase accessibility to those unfamiliar with the games. For example, even though the cast of the fourth and fifth seasons include characters from the Covenant Elite alien race, Rooster Teeth never portrays those characters in their original &quot;Halo&quot; context. Beginning with the sixth season, titled &quot;Reconstruction&quot;, the series begins to follow &quot;Halo&quot; more closely. It is established that Reconstruction onwards takes place one year after &quot;Halo 3&quot; and several characters indirectly reference Smart AI, the Human-Covenant War, and Forerunners. Also at several points it is noted that Project Freelancer is under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Space Command.

During its first seventeen seasons, &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; centered on the Red and Blue Teams, two groups of soldiers engaged in a supposed civil war. Originally, each team occupies a small base in a box canyon known as Blood Gulch. According to , one of the Red Team soldiers, each team&#x27;s base exists only in response to the other team&#x27;s base. It is later revealed that there is no actual civil war; both the Red and Blue armies are under the same command, Project Freelancer, and only exist as training simulations for Freelancer Agents. Although both teams generally dislike each other and have standing orders to defeat their opponents and capture their flag, neither team is usually motivated to fight the other, with the exception of Sarge, the leader of Red Team.

The eighteenth season, referred to as &quot;Zero&quot;, centers on an elite team of special operations soldiers, known as Shatter Squad, as they try to stop another group of soldiers, known as Viper, from getting the keys to a powerful suit of armor known as the Ultimate Power. Unlike the original series, &quot;Zero&quot; instead parodies action movies. While certain character, vehicle, and weapon models are carried over from &quot;Halo 5: Guardians&quot;, the series tries to distance itself from the &quot;Halo&quot; universe, instead introducing a new military force known as the Alliance of Defense in place of the UNSC. Rather than being a machinima produced in the &quot;Halo&quot; engine, the series is now fully animated in Unreal Engine 4 and uses assets from the Unreal Engine Marketplace that are unrelated to the &quot;Halo&quot; franchise, although there are moments that scenes are animated to mimic machinima limitations. &quot;Family Shatters&quot; originally acted as a non-canonical spinoff involving the characters introduced in &quot;Zero&quot; but was retroactively made the nineteenth season of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; after the release of &quot;Restoration&quot;.

== Cast and characters ==
During its original run, &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; featured characters whose personalities are skewed in different ways and to varying degrees. Character interaction and dialogue, instead of action, would drive the story. The original series centered on eleven main characters. Other characters, both team-affiliated and unaffiliated, human and non-human, have played significant roles throughout the story. Notable later additions to the cast include The Director and The Chairman, as well as the Freelancers, which are named after U.S. states. AIs are also important characters, and are named after Greek letters. As is a common habit in most forms of military, the soldiers usually refer to each other by their last names.

Throughout the original series, the Red Team primarily consists of their hotheaded leader Super Colonel Sarge (Matt Hullum), his attentive second-in-command Captain Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Simmons (Gus Sorola), the lazy Captain Dexter Grif (Geoff Ramsey), the oblivious/effeminate Private Franklin Delano Donut (Dan Godwin), and their apathetic Spanish-speaking robot mechanic Lopez the Heavy (Burnie Burns). 

For the majority of the series, the Blue Team consisted of their sardonic de facto leader Private Leonard L. Church (Burns), the self-described ladies man Captain Lavernius Tucker (Jason Saldaña), the dimwitted Captain Michael J. Caboose (Joel Heyman), and the no-nonsense Freelancer Agent Texas/&quot;Tex&quot; (Kathleen Zuelch). They were later joined by Private Kaikaina &quot;Sister&quot; Grif (Becca Frasier), Grif&#x27;s promiscuous sister, in &quot;Season 5&quot;. 

However, Blue Team&#x27;s roster (with the exception of Tucker and Caboose) became mixed with every passing season after the deaths of the original Church and Tex at the end of &quot;Reconstruction&quot;, being joined by Epsilon (Burns), who would go on to take Church&#x27;s identity and Tex II (Zuelch) during &quot;Recreation&quot; and &quot;Revelation&quot; respectively until their deaths in &quot;Season 13&quot; and &quot;Season 9&quot;. The team was later joined by the emotionally scarred Freelancer Agent Washington/&quot;Wash&quot; (Shannon McCormick) at the end of &quot;Revelation&quot; after first meeting the Reds and Blues during &quot;Reconstruction&quot;. Blue Team currently consists of Tucker, Caboose, Wash, and Sister, the latter of whom rejoined the team during &quot;The Shisno Paradox&quot;. 

Also part of the Reds and Blues are the somewhat incompetent Medical Officer Frank &quot;Doc&quot; DuFresne (Hullum), who first appeared in &quot;Season 2&quot;, and the impatient and competitive Freelancer Agent Carolina (Jen Brown), who first appeared in &quot;Season 9&quot;, both of whom are unaffiliated with a specific team and instead just act as members of both groups.

Over the years, &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; has attracted numerous notable guest stars, namely Ed Robertson, Elijah Wood, Christopher Sabat, The Zellner Brothers, Amber Benson, Dan Avidan, Arin Hanson, SungWon Cho, Ricco Fajardo, Daman Mills, Anthony Padilla, and Ian Hecox.

===Development===

&quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; emerged from Burnie Burns&#x27;s voiceover-enhanced gameplay videos that he created for a website called drunkgamers.com, which was run by Geoff Fink (later Geoff Ramsey) and Gustavo Sorola. Having played &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot; extensively, the &quot;drunkgamers&quot; crew discussed one day whether the Warthog, an automobile in the game, looks like a puma. This discussion, re-created in , was &quot;the spark for the whole series&quot;. Seeing potential for a full story, Burns created a which was released September 5, 2002, on the Drunkgamers website, but it was largely ignored, and, for unrelated reasons, &quot;drunkgamers&quot; soon closed. Four months later, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; contacted Ramsey for permission to include a different &quot;drunkgamers&quot; video in a CD to be distributed with the magazine. Ramsey granted permission, but he and Burns felt that they needed a website to take advantage of the exposure from &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;. They therefore resurrected &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; and re-released the trailer to coincide with the &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; issue. The was released on April 1, 2003.

Rooster Teeth was initially unaware of the broader machinima movement. In 2004, Co-producer Matt Hullum stated in an interview with &quot;GameSpy&quot;, &quot;When we first started &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; we thought we were completely original. We never imagined that there were other people out there using video games to make movies, much less that it was a new art form with a hard to pronounce name and an official organization.&quot;

The nature of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; was different from Burns&#x27;s initial expectation. A partial character introduction released between the original trailer and the first episode featured extensive action and violence, set to Limp Bizkit&#x27;s song &quot;Break Stuff&quot;. However, as work continued, the focus shifted to situation comedy rather than the heavy action initially implied. Although the series parodies video games, Ramsey noted, &quot;We try not to make it too much of an inside joke. And I think we use more bureaucracy and military humor than anything else, which everybody working in an office can identify with.&quot; Rooster Teeth has stated that &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; was influenced by &quot;Homestar Runner&quot;, &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;, and possibly &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

Rooster Teeth initially envisioned &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; to be short, but the series grew beyond their expectations. Burns and Ramsey had preconceived a list of jokes for which they allocated six to eight episodes. By , however, they realized that the series had fleshed out more than expected; they had covered only about one third of their original list. Later in , Burns estimated a series of 22 episodes; however, driven by the series&#x27; popularity, he realized that there was more potential story than could be covered in that length, and was able to conceive an extension of the season 1 plot. The whole production team eventually quit their jobs and began to work full-time on the series; to generate revenue they created an online store to sell T-shirts.

On June 16, 2006, Burns announced a five-part mini-series, &quot;Red vs. Blue: Out of Mind&quot;, which chronicles the adventures of the mercenary Tex after her disappearance in . The mini-series premiered exclusively on the Xbox Live Marketplace, but Rooster Teeth later made it available on their official site.

The original series, &quot;The Blood Gulch Chronicles&quot;, ended on June 28, 2007, with the release of episode 100. On April 4, 2008, Burns announced a new series, &quot;Red vs. Blue: Reconstruction&quot;, the group&#x27;s first &quot;Halo 3&quot; series and the beginning of the new &quot;Recollection&quot; story arc. Several voice actors returned in &quot;Reconstruction&quot;, which ran from April 5 to October 30, 2008. Rooster Teeth announced plans for a sequel &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; series, each separated by a few weeks&#x27; break. The mini-series &quot;Red vs. Blue: Relocated&quot; bridged the gap between &quot;Red vs. Blue: Recreation&quot; and the previous season. During a Late Nite Jenga Jam podcast, Burnie Burns officially confirmed that the working title of the eighth Red vs. Blue series was &quot;&quot;Red vs. Blue: Resolution&quot;. The title was later finalized as &quot;Red vs. Blue: Revelation&quot;&quot;. The first four episodes were previewed at PAX East in March. After five seasons, Rooster Teeth expanded the scope and animation of the show, hiring renowned animator Monty Oum for action scenes, starting with season 8. On April 1, 2010, the premiere of &quot;Revelation&quot; attracted such a large audience that both roosterteeth.com and Blip.tv (who formerly hosted Rooster Teeth&#x27;s videos) crashed.

On March 28, 2011, Rooster Teeth presented the first trailer for &quot;Season 9&quot; of Red vs Blue which aired on June 14, 2011, during which time Miles Luna officially joined the company. Season 9 acted as a semi-prequel, fleshing out the event surrounding &quot;Project Freelancer&quot;, one of the key elements of the plot in previous seasons, while continuing the events left off in &quot;Revelation&quot;. &quot;Season 10&quot;, which continued Season 9&#x27;s pattern of showing both stories simultaneously, began on May 28, 2012, and ended on November 5, 2012. The season concluded the Freelancer backstory while setting up the events of Season 11. The first &quot;RWBY&quot; trailer was shown following the conclusion of the season&#x27;s credits.

On September 7, 2012, Burnie Burns appeared on &quot;What&#x27;s Trending&quot; and confirmed that there would be a &quot;Season 11&quot;, which premiered on June 14, 2013, and started the Chorus Trilogy. The trilogy picked up where Season 10 left off and returned to a format similar to that of The Blood Gulch Chronicles, having no pre-rendered CGI. The season ended on November 11, 2013. On February 3, 2014, Miles Luna announced &quot;Season 12&quot; on Rooster Teeth&#x27;s website. The season premiered on April 28, 2014, and concluded on September 29, 2014. The final season of the Chorus Trilogy, &quot;Season 13&quot;, was announced on March 4, 2015, with a release date of April 1, 2015. The season brought back a handful of characters from the series, including Sharkface, the Counselor, Junior, and Sister, and ended with a cliffhanger on September 7, 2015.

On April 1, 2016, a trailer for &quot;Season 14&quot; was released, with its first episode airing on May 8, 2016. Breaking from the format of the previous seasons, Season 14 was instead an anthology season, featuring various backstories, such as the trilogy of episodes starring Locus and Felix, and/or non-canon &quot;PSA-type&quot; episodes, such as the third Sarge movie trailer. The season ended on October 16, 2016.

On February 24, 2017, it was announced that Joe Nicolosi, writer and director of the Season 14 episode &quot;The Brick Gulch Chronicles&quot; would be writing and directing Season 15. Its trailer was released on March 30, 2017, and the season itself premiered on April 2, 2017.

Nicolosi returned for Season 16, &quot;Red vs. Blue: The Shisno Paradox&quot;, where he also had the help of writer Jason Weight. The season premiered on April 15, 2018. While Nicolosi could not return for the seventeenth season due to other commitments within Rooster Teeth, he co-wrote the story with Weight, who was promoted to head writer, and Miles Luna, who penned one of the season&#x27;s episodes. Machinima animators Josh Ornelas and Austin Clark took over as directors of &quot;Red vs. Blue: Singularity&quot;, which premiered on March 9, 2019.

On January 15, 2020, Season 18, &quot;Red vs. Blue: Zero&quot;, was confirmed to be in development with a brief 3-second clip being shown in a promo trailer for upcoming Rooster Teeth releases. It was initially scheduled to premiere on October 19, 2020, but was delayed to November 9, 2020. Director Torrian Crawford referred to the season as a &quot;restart&quot; for the series, as it follows a mostly new cast, has cleaner humor, and is more action-focused than previous iterations.

On July 7, 2023, at Rooster Teeth&#x27;s annual convention RTX, it was announced that the series would return for a nineteenth and final season subtitled &quot;Restoration&quot;. Hullum was announced to return to direct while Burns, who had since left the company, was confirmed to return as the lead writer. The reveal trailer retcons the events of the &quot;Shisno Trilogy&quot; and &quot;Zero&quot; (seasons 15–18) as simulations created by Epsilon-Church. On March 28, 2024, it was announced that the initial plan of an episodic release for the nineteenth season had changed due to the shutdown of Rooster Teeth and the season would instead be released as a feature-length movie, which premiered on May 7, 2024. Following its release, &quot;Family Shatters&quot;, which was originally a non-canonical spinoff of &quot;Zero&quot;, retroactively took the place of a nineteenth season.

===Writing===
The process by which the show is written has changed as the show progressed. In the first season, Burnie Burns would typically write an episode script on a Sunday afternoon before the episode was to be released on Friday. Scripts were written with minimal planning as the storyline grew beyond the 6 to 8 episodes originally expected. Church&#x27;s death, as well as the revelation of Tex as a female character, both of which drove most of the season 1 plot, were conceived shortly before their respective episodes began production.

In January 2005, Burnie Burns and Kathleen Zuelch were interviewed in an episode of &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; on G4. In response to a question regarding any drawbacks to using machinima techniques, Burns responded &quot;There are drawbacks, like it&#x27;s a very limited world&quot;. PC games often allow for the addition and integration of new game assets, such as new levels and textures; console games are much more limited in this respect. &quot;But really what you end up doing is you end up writing around what&#x27;s in that world, that limited world ... sometimes we sit around and we think &#x27;what can we possibly do with stuff that&#x27;s in the game?&#x27;&quot;. As an example, the skull from the Oddball multiplayer mode of &quot;Halo&quot; was used for the flashback scene in episode 10, in which Tex beats Private Jimmy to death with his own skull.

After the first season, the writing process changed. Matt Hullum was added as a main writer in the next season, and plot events were planned much more in advance. Approximately 40 to 80 pages of rough plot and dialogue are now written out before production on a season begins. In describing the writing process, Burns has said that main plot points are assigned to occur at certain points in a season, and that they would begin writing each episode by asking how much they wanted to advance towards the next plot point.

===Audio===
Dialogue for an entire episode is typically recorded over one or two days and cut together for filming the day after. Until midway through season 3, audio for the voice actors living in Texas had been recorded in a makeshift soundproof booth in Burns&#x27; guest room closet. Currently, however, audio is recorded in a professional recording booth in the Rooster Teeth offices in Austin, Texas, with the recordings later being compressed to a slightly lower quality. During season 1, dialogue for the voice actors living in Los Angeles, California — Joel Heyman, Kathleen Zuelch, and Matt Hullum — was recorded over the phone. Afterwards, a second recording studio was set up in Hullum&#x27;s Los Angeles home. As Hullum moved back to Texas in season 3, Heyman and Zuelch now record their own dialogue. Jason Saldaña and Gus Sorola also recorded audio by phone while temporarily residing in New York State and Puerto Rico respectively.

===Music===

Initially, the first several episodes of the series did not include any music. In May 2003, Nico Audy-Rowland, the bandleader of Trocadero, was introduced to Red vs. Blue and enjoyed the series enough to submit a song about it to Burns, who liked the piece and promptly requested more music for Red vs. Blue. Episode 8, &quot;Don&#x27;t Ph34r The Reaper&quot;, was the first to include music. However, for the release of the season 1 DVD, music was retrofitted into earlier episodes, often during transitions.
Trocadero&#x27;s &quot;Blood Gulch Blues&quot;, whose last few measures are now heard during each episode&#x27;s title sequence, is used as background music for the character introductions on the Red vs. Blue season DVDs. According to Trocadero&#x27;s website, the song&#x27;s lyrics are intended to highlight episode 2&#x27;s joke about the Warthog and the notion that there is as much bickering and fighting within each team as there is conflict between the two sides. In fact, &quot;Blood Gulch Blues&quot; never mentions Red vs. Blue. The song is from the band&#x27;s debut full-length album &quot;Roses Are Red, Violets Are Blue&quot; which was released in 2004. The band&#x27;s style is alternative rock, taking influence from elements of blues, alternative rock, and western types of music. Trocadero continued to provide music for the show from their second and third albums, &quot;Ghosts That Linger&quot; and &quot;Flying by Wire&quot;.

Beginning with &quot;Red vs. Blue: Revelation&quot;, the main score for each season has been crafted by Jeff Williams, the former keyboardist of Trocadero, in addition to many of Trocadero&#x27;s songs being reused. Williams&#x27;s soundtracks have genres containing mixed elements of score music, hard rock, and sometimes electronic and rap. Williams often features others on vocals including Lamar Hall, Red Rapper, Barbara La Ronga, Nicole D&#x27;Andrea, his daughter Casey Lee Williams, Sandy Lee Casey, and some members of the cast, and collaborates with Steve Goldshein on some tracks. The soundtracks also feature several parody songs, and some songs included are heard in PSAs and Rooster Teeth shorts. With the release of season eleven, Williams moved away from providing music for Red vs. Blue to work on Rooster Teeth&#x27;s new series, &quot;RWBY&quot;. Trocadero returned as the sole-provider of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;&#x27;s score for the first time since season seven, also providing a new theme song &quot;Contact&quot; effectively replacing &quot;Blood Gulch Blues&quot;. David Levy joined the music team alongside Trocadero in season 13 and continued to write music through season 17. Omega Sparx took over as lead composer for season 18 and returned alongside Williams and Levy to contribute to the score for &quot;Restoration&quot;.

===Recording===
&quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; is mostly recorded using a number of networked Xbox consoles. As the games evolved and Rooster Teeth grew, consoles were changed to eight connected Xbox 360s and later sixteen Xbox Ones. Within a multiplayer game session, the people controlling the avatars &quot;puppet&quot; their characters, moving them around, firing weapons, and performing other actions as dictated by the script, and in synchronization with the prerecorded dialogue. The camera is simply another player, whose first-person perspective is recorded raw to a computer. The Apple Macintosh games &quot;Marathon&quot; and &quot;Marathon 2: Durandal&quot; were also used in Season 3 for scenes that occur in the distant past; this has the effect of making the graphical quality of the series an indication of time&#x27;s progression throughout the story. The first five seasons of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; were later reshot in high definition using the PC ports of &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot; and &quot;Halo 2&quot;, which have also been featured in later seasons whenever those games were required.

In the interview on &quot;The Screen Savers&quot;, Burns described the use of machinima techniques to record the show thus: &quot;It&#x27;s like normal animation but instead of, y&#x27;know, sitting down, drawing everything by hand, we just use controllers.&quot; During the earlier seasons, Ramsey developed a technique to handle the gamepad with his foot in case more than four characters were in the scene.

In scenes using the original &quot;Halo&quot;, a bug was exploited that made it so that by holding a pistol and looking down, the character would appear to be holding the pistol down but looking up, as if more relaxed. At the same time, changing the perspective the head would bob, giving the impression that the character was talking. The glitch also either made vertical movement limited or returned the character&#x27;s appearance to normal, so characters would have to estimate movements, since they were always looking down.

Bungie eliminated the bug in &quot;Halo 2&quot;, so that the on-screen characters appear to look up or down correctly. To facilitate the production of machinima, Bungie implemented a new feature that made it possible to achieve the same effect as the original bug. In &quot;Halo 2&quot;, pressing down on the D-Pad of the Xbox controller makes the player character appear to hold a weapon in a neutral position, without aiming it at anyone, while looking straight ahead. This also allowed them to move the heads up and down to achieve a more dynamic appearance for some scenes.

In footage made using &quot;Halo&quot;, a weapon aiming reticle appears in the center of the screen. This reticle appears because, as with most machinima, the camera&#x27;s view is from the perspective of a weapon-wielding player. The exception to this is footage recorded by killing the camera player&#x27;s avatar. Footage made using &quot;Halo: Custom Edition&quot; allowed for a player to act as a free roaming camera, and thus contained no reticle. In &quot;Halo 2&quot;, a bug in the Oddball multiplayer mode allows the player to drop all weapons, causing the weapon reticle to disappear. This bug has been used in all &quot;Halo 2&quot; footage from episode 46 onwards.

To gain unique angles in the series, Rooster Teeth first used a tank in the game to emulate crane shots by standing the cameraman on the turret while it was raised. Later, they found it more practical to stand the cameraman on other characters in the game. This trick has also been used for other purposes, such as standing Donut on two characters to create the illusion that he could jump higher than is possible in the game.

For scenes which include the flag (CTF), only two colors could be used (Sarge&#x27;s and early Donut&#x27;s red, and Caboose&#x27;s blue) as CTF is a team game and only red and blue colors could be used. When the flag used among different colored characters, it is only shown with a standard red or blue character, mixed with scenes with other characters behaving as if it is present.

During recording, there was an issue with the Blue Team&#x27;s deceased leader, Church. Church appears as a ghost for some parts of the show, and he needed to appear transparent to the viewer. To achieve this, all scenes with ghost-Church had to be recorded twice, once with Church in them and once without him. After the switch to Halo 2, Church&#x27;s ghost form was portrayed using the &quot;Poor Camo&quot; Armor enhancement.

Another difficulty when recording in &quot;Halo 2&quot; was the enormous shadow over Red Base in the map Coagulation. This shadow had a detrimental effect on the appearance of the characters. To avoid this, late in Season 4 a glitch was discovered that allowed a character to appear lit even in a dark area. Burnie Burns stated in the Season 4 audio commentary that the glitch was something they kept noticing a lot while recording the episodes, and when they discovered how to replicate it they utilized it extensively. During the first five seasons, the videos were mostly recorded on the &quot;Halo&quot; map Blood Gulch and its &quot;Halo 2&quot; counterpart, Coagulation, although later episodes have increasingly been recorded on other maps.

Episodes that have been made with the games starting with &quot;Halo 3&quot; have used the theater mode camera. The Forge Mode from &quot;Halo 4&quot; onward also helped by providing a green screen and the creation of entire areas for certain scenes.

Starting in season 8, action sequences have been made with dedicated animation that involve stunts not possible with the previous game engine. For this, they teamed up with animator Monty Oum, a fan of the series. Making the show more ambitious and reliant on computer animation led to extensive planning – fight choreography, storyboards, animatics – for episodes that take months to be completed, in contrast to machinima ones that are done in just a week.

===Post-production===
Adobe Premiere Pro is used to edit the audio and video together, add the titles, and create some of the special effects not normally possible on the console or in the games used. Adobe After Effects is also used, typically by Hullum, to create animated props not found in the regular game engine. Examples of these extra props include tombstones in and ornaments, presents, and lights in the Christmas 2004 video.

As the camera player&#x27;s view has a heads-up display (HUD), black bars are added in post-production to hide the top and bottom portions containing irrelevant in-game information, creating a letterbox effect. Most machinima is made with computer games, which often have HUDs that can be easily disabled in one way or another. Console games such as &quot;Halo&quot; and &quot;Halo 2&quot; are often more limited in this respect. In 2010, Rooster Teeth Productions released a remastered edition of &quot;The Blood Gulch Chronicles&quot; that removed the black bars and aiming reticle existent in previous versions of the series, which was done by re-shooting the first four seasons in the PC versions of &quot;Halo&quot; and &quot;Halo 2&quot;.

==Other media==
A book based on the series, titled &quot;Red vs. Blue: The Ultimate Fan Guide&quot;, was published November 17, 2015. Written by Eddy Rivas and Burnie Burns, it collects information about the series over its first twelve seasons and most of its thirteenth season.

Due to the popularity and success of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;, Rooster Teeth has created dozens of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;-themed merchandise available for sale on the website&#x27;s store. Rooster Teeth has released several posters featuring major characters accompanied by their most popular quotes, dubbed &quot;-isms posters&quot;. Several t-shirts based on quotes from the show have also been created.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; attracted interest immediately; the first episode was featured on Slashdot, Penny Arcade, and Fark on the same day, and had 20,000 downloads within a day. The following episodes wound up downloaded hundreds of thousands of times, forcing a change on the distribution to peer-to-peer file sharing to cut the increasing server costs. Ramsey noted &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; also &quot;had a broader appeal than we anticipated&quot;, gathering a female following along with the expected demographic of young adult males. Shortly after episode 2, Bungie contacted Rooster Teeth. Although the crew had feared that any contact would be to force an end to the project, Bungie enjoyed the videos and was supportive; one staff member called the production &quot;kind of brilliant&quot;. A deal was arranged to ensure that the series could continue to use Bungie&#x27;s game properties without license fees. The relationship has continued with Bungie&#x27;s successor in the &quot;Halo&quot; series, 343 Industries. &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; continued to attract more attention, and by April 2004, Kevin J. Delaney of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; estimated that weekly viewership was between 650,000 and 1,000,000. In a 2006 interview, Strange Company founder Hugh Hancock called the series probably &quot;the most successful machinima productions &quot; and estimated that it was generating almost US$200,000 annually. &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; content was also included with a premium &quot;Legendary&quot; edition of &quot;Halo 3&quot;.

&quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; was widely acclaimed within the machinima industry. The first season won awards for Best Picture, Best Independent Machinima Film, and Best Writing at the Academy of Machinima Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; 2003 Machinima Film Festival. Two years later, at the 2005 festival, the won an award for Best Independent Machinima and was nominated for five others. At the 2006 Machinima Festival, the series was nominated for awards in voice acting and writing, but won neither.

Among film critics, the response was generally positive. Darren Waters of &quot;BBC News Online&quot; called &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; &quot;riotously funny&quot; and &quot;reminiscent of the anarchic energy of &quot;South Park&quot;&quot;. Reviewing the three season DVDs for &quot;Cinema Strikes Back&quot;, Charlie Prince wrote, &quot;&quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; is hysterical in large part because all the characters are morons, and so the seemingly intense conflict with the opposing base doesn&#x27;t exactly work the way you&#x27;d think it would.&quot; Leggat described the series as &quot;[p]art locker-room humor, part Beckett-like absurdist tragicomedy, part wicked vivisection of game culture and sci-fi action films and games&quot;. Ed Halter of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; dismissed the humor as shallow and described the first season as &quot;&quot;Clerks&quot;-meets-&quot;Star Wars&quot;&quot;. Leggat defended the humor, arguing, &quot;The literary analog is absurdist drama.&quot; It has also been critiqued by academic D. Bruno Starrs as an anti-war film.

Another common criticism of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; was that its season 3 plot was too far-fetched and out-of-character. Charlie Prince wrote, &quot;By the third season, however, the &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; idea seems to be running out of steam ... It&#x27;s not funny so much as just odd.&quot; Writing for the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;, Wilma Jandoc agreed that the first part of &quot;season 3 ... throws the teams into a ridiculous situation and has limited member interactions, leading to a lack of witty dialogue&quot;. In an &quot;about.com&quot; review of the season 4 DVD, writer Eric Qualls thought that season 3 was &quot;a little too long, and too complicated, and the jokes were a bit too far apart&quot;. Nevertheless, both Prince and Jandoc were optimistic that the series would improve, and Qualls stated that the fourth season had &quot;returned to the series&#x27; roots&quot; as &quot;some of the funniest stuff you&#x27;ll ever see&quot;. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reviewer Chad Sapieha complained that season 3 &quot;seemed as though they were trying to come up with more physical gags rather than focusing on the dialogue&quot; before the writing picked up in the following seasons.

Rooster Teeth Productions has created special &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; videos for various events. For example, Microsoft has commissioned &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; videos for Xbox demo kiosks found in game stores and for a developer conference. Barenaked Ladies has also commissioned videos for their concerts, as frontman Ed Robertson was a fan of the series, and would later voice a character, Captain Butch Flowers. Other videos have been specifically created for gaming magazines, including &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; and &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;; gaming conventions, including E3 and the Penny Arcade Expo; and the Sundance Film Festival.

&quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; has also received praise from soldiers stationed in the Middle East. An August 2005 blog entry by Kimi Matsuzaki of 1UP.com displays photographs of soldiers holding various weapons, as well as copies of the first and second season &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; DVDs. Geoff Ramsey later stated in an interview, &quot;We get a lot of merchandise and DVDs out to Iraq and get a lot of great e-mails back.&quot;

&quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; has been acknowledged by Xbox Live through Grifball, a game variant which is featured on the Halo 3 multiplayer; Grifball originated as a joke by Sarge in the 4th season that alluded to inflicting pain on Grif. The notability and impact of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; extends to video games outside the &quot;Halo&quot; series as well. The developers of the Xbox 360 video game &quot;Gears of War&quot;, Epic Games, made a reference to a &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; gag through an in-game achievement called, &quot;Is it a spider?&quot;; the award is earned for tagging opponents with grenades. Another reference to the series appears on Bungie&#x27;s website. On a player&#x27;s &quot;Halo 3&quot; profile screen the description of a kill or death with a flag is &quot;Right next to the headlight fluid&quot;. In &quot;Halo 3&quot; itself, the second campaign scenario features a &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; skit, wherein two cast members voice over a soldier attempting to bypass a locked door. Different skits are seen on each difficulty level. In &quot;Halo: Reach&quot;, Dr. Halsey&#x27;s office contains a data-file detailing the UNSC&#x27;s &quot;reaction&quot; to the films. In the expansion pack for &quot;Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare&quot;, there is an achievement called &quot;Chupathingy,&quot; when killing a Chupacabra.

===Impact on machinima===
&quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; is widely credited with attracting public attention to machinima and web-series. The first instance of machinima dates back to the 1990s in the first-person shooter game &quot;Quake&quot;. A group that called themselves &quot;The Rangers&quot; created a software mod of them typing in the chat box and putting lines of dialogue on the screen. This group named these &quot;videos&quot; &quot;Diary of a Camper.&quot; Even though Rooster Teeth is not the first to produce machinima, Clive Thompson credited &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; as &quot;the first to break out of the underground&quot;. Tavares, Gil, and Roque called it machinima&#x27;s &quot;first big success&quot;, and Paul Marino noted that &quot;the series proved so popular that it not only transcended the typical gamer, it also claimed fans outside the gaming world&quot;. In 2005, Thompson wrote that &quot;Microsoft has been so strangely solicitous that when it was developing the sequel to Halo last year [2004], the designers actually inserted a special command—a joystick button that makes a soldier lower his weapon—designed solely to make it easier for Rooster Teeth to do dialogue&quot;.

&quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; has motivated the fan base to create the machinima &quot;Sponsors vs. Freeloaders&quot;. This series lived on the forums of roosterteeth.com. The series has inspired other machinima productions, including &quot;The Codex.&quot; Other &quot;Halo&quot; machinimas that are not necessarily related to, or influenced by, &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; are: &quot;Arby &#x27;n&#x27; the Chief&quot;, &quot;The Forgotten Spartans&quot;, &quot;Matchmaking&quot;, &quot;Spriggs&quot;, &quot;Rise of the Spartans&quot;, &quot;Playtime&quot;, &quot;C n&#x27; P&quot;, and &quot;Sandguardians&quot;.

In machinima, &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; has been mentioned as the most successful example of the trend toward serial distribution. According to Hugh Hancock, this format allows for gradual improvement as a result of viewer feedback, and gives viewers a reason to return for future videos. Hancock argues that this model was necessary for &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;″s success: &quot;Sunday night is Red vs. Blue night, just as (in the UK) Thursday used to be Buffy. Had RvB released their films as single downloads of an hour and a half, they&#x27;d have had nowhere near the success they currently enjoy.&quot; Karen Moltenbrey explains that, machinima films were quite lengthy and were typically not episodic. Rooster Teeth was able to combine these aspects by compiling the episodic adventures into a feature-length film and selling DVDs.

==Distribution==
&quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; episodes were originally available in QuickTime (QT) and Windows Media Video (WMV) formats, with the most recent season available at the time in full and episodes from the previous seasons available in a rolling archive, cycling on a weekly basis. This original setup was intended to help to control bandwidth costs; as of September 2005, the official Rooster Teeth website was serving 400 terabytes of data monthly. Video content has now moved to streaming, with initial releases occurring through the website directly, followed by YouTube later on. Red vs. Blue Season 16 was not released to YouTube until March 19, 2019, unlike previous seasons which released on YouTube a week after being made available to FIRST members on the site. Previously it was hosted by &quot;Blip&quot;, though it has switched over to being hosted directly on the website with Jwplayer acting as its video player, after Blip was shut down. All freely released episodes are currently available and the rolling archive has been retired. &quot;Out of Mind&quot; was initially a free download on the Xbox Live Marketplace, along with some &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; episodes being available purchased. More recently, episodes became available to be streamed on &quot;Halo Waypoint&quot;.

Members of the official website can become FIRST members, originally referred to as sponsors, for a fee of US$5 every month or US$20 every six months. FIRST members formerly could access videos a day before members can view them and a week before a general public release, but now get to view them a full week before both free members and non-members can view them, as well as the ability to access special content released only to FIRST members. For example, before the premiere of season 12, Rooster Teeth released exclusive audio logs featuring some of the main characters exclusively for FIRST members.

Episodes were originally released in different resolutions; higher resolutions were reserved for FIRST members. Beginning with the &quot;Red vs. Blue: Out of Mind&quot; mini-series, Rooster Teeth began to film and edit videos in 720p high-definition, and release episodes in widescreen format, instead of hiding the game HUD through the letterboxing seen in fullscreen releases. On January 8, 2007, the release of episode 87, Matt Hullum announced that videos would be viewable using Adobe Flash. He stated that the change allowed Rooster Teeth to release public videos in a higher resolution &quot;while keeping the file size low&quot;, and that the entire video archive would be updated. Code to embed the Flash video on other websites was also distributed. In a site journal entry, Burns clarified that downloadable versions would continue to be released, but after their Flash counterparts. Eventually, during Season 10, downloadable episodes ceased to be posted. This was likely to prevent re-uploading episodes onto YouTube ahead of public release.

Although it is distributed serially over the internet, &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; is also one of the first commercially released products made using machinima, as opposed to a product merely containing machinima. DVDs (and later Blu-rays) of every completed seasons are sold through Rooster Teeth&#x27;s official website, as well as at several retailers in the United States, such as Target and Wal-Mart. Rooster Teeth claimed in 2017 that &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; has sold more than 1 million DVDs of individual seasons and box sets. Initially each season&#x27;s episodes were edited together in the DVD releases to play continuously as full-length films, though later seasons were written as singular films with episodes being split up later during production. Because some episodes contain dialogue that continues into or past the episode credits, Rooster Teeth either removes that dialogue entirely or films extra footage to replace the original fade to black. On April 1, 2008, Rooster Teeth released a box set of all five seasons, including a DVD of new bonus content. In 2010, a remastered box set of the first five seasons was released, with the first four seasons being completely reshot, featuring a proper 16:9 aspect ratio instead of the highly letterboxed look of the original episodes, and a much higher resolution. On November 6, 2012, to celebrate ten years, Rooster Teeth released a DVD and Blu-ray box set, titled &quot;RVBX&quot;, comprising the first ten seasons and five discs worth of bonus content, two of which are almost entirely newly released material.

Theatrical presentations of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; seasons at the Lincoln Center and at other film festivals are cut (sometimes extensively) for time. In a 2005 interview, Burns noted that the first season, normally 75 minutes in length, was cut to 55 minutes for these venues, with an entire episode omitted. Burns stated in a journal entry that the 134-minute season 3 DVD version had to be shortened to &quot;a watchable-in-a-theater runtime of 100 minutes&quot;.

The first 5 seasons were made available on Netflix in July 2014, with Seasons 6–12 debuting on the streaming service in April 2015. On March 4, 2015, Rooster Teeth debuted a new YouTube channel dedicated entirely to &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;, where the first twelve seasons were uploaded to between March 6–29 in anticipation for the release of the thirteenth season&#x27;s premiere on April 1, 2015. The channel has over 886 thousand subscribers, and over 268 million video views, as of July 2019. The channel has since been renamed to &quot;Rooster Teeth Animation&quot; and features other original animated Rooster Teeth productions such as &quot;RWBY&quot; and &quot;Camp Camp&quot;.

El Rey Network syndicated the series in its entirety in November 2015, with the series premiering on December 5, 2015. Founder Robert Rodriguez called the series a &quot;truly groundbreaking machinima series, with a strong focus on quality writing and pioneering motion capture techniques&quot;.

In May 2022 it was announced that FilmRise had acquired streaming rights for &quot;Nomad of Nowhere&quot;, &quot;Camp Camp&quot;, and &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;, grouping episodes from each series into &quot;traditional half-hour formats and seasons for streaming.&quot;

<text>The Automobiles Leroux-Pisart (ALP) was a Belgian automobile built in 1920 in Brussels.

==History==
André Leroux and André Pisart founded the company in 1919. The company&#x27;s headquarters were on Boulevard de Waterloo in Brussels . In the same year, the production of automobiles, designed by Leroux, began. The brand name was ALP.

From July 1920, the company name was changed to SA Mécanique-Automobile Soméa. It is unclear whether this was a name change or a new owner. Baron Pierre de Caters was president, Germanès, Mulders, Leroux and Pisart were involved. A new factory was built in Vilvoorde. In 1921, Leroux left the company. Paul Bastien was hired as the new designer. The new brand name Soméa was introduced in December 1921 at the latest. Production ended in December 1923 and the company was dissolved.

<text>Icecast is a streaming media project released as free software maintained by the Xiph.Org Foundation. It also refers specifically to the server program which is part of the project. Icecast was created in December 1998/January 1999 by Jack Moffitt and Barath Raghavan to provide an open-source audio streaming server that anyone could modify, use, and tinker with. Version 2, a ground-up rewrite aimed at multi-format support (initially targeting Ogg Vorbis) and scalability, was started in 2001 and released in January 2004.

==History==
Icecast was originally developed by Moffitt in 1998 for SMU&#x27;s radio station. At the time, the station was constantly losing its FCC license and was at the time only able to reach listeners in the same building. Given that all of the dorms throughout campus had Ethernet connectivity, using streaming audio to broadcast was a natural solution, but currently available audio streaming software, such as RealAudio, was too expensive. Moffitt created Icecast, allowing the station to easily reach everywhere on campus without the necessity of FCC licensing or a transmitter upgrade. Initially developed to support mp3 files, Vorbis support was added shortly after.

==Technical details==
The Icecast server is capable of streaming audio content as Opus or Vorbis over standard HTTP, video as WebM or Theora over HTTP, and MP3, AAC, and NSV over the SHOUTcast protocol. Theora, AAC, and NSV are only supported in version 2.2.0 and newer.

Icecast requires external programs, called &quot;source clients&quot;, to originate the streams, and the Icecast project includes a source client program known as IceS. The source runs typically in the place where the audio is generated (e.g., a studio) and the Icecast server where a high-bandwidth connection is available (e.g., a colocation centre). Since version 2.4.0 source clients can use plain HTTP standard PUT requests instead of the custom SOURCE method.

<text>Channels of Rage () is a 2003 documentary film by Anat Halachmi.

== Synopsis ==
The film focuses on two young rap artists, Subliminal, an Israeli Jew, and Tamer Nafar, a Palestinian citizen of Israel, and focuses on their music, friendship, and their politicization as public figures. The film traces the relationship between Tamer and Subliminal, as the events of the Second Intifada unfold, and lets the viewer draw conclusions from the souring relations between the two as an individual representation of the polarization process which took place during these years of bloody conflict. In this aspect, the film succeeds in delivering the atmosphere of the loss of hopes for peace after the failure of the Camp David summit between Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat and the renewed intensity of the conflict since. The film was featured in the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival.

<doc id="853222" wikidata="Q4734792" url="?curid=853222" title="Alpena Flyer">
<text>The Alpena Flyer was an American automobile manufactured between 1910 and 1914 in Alpena, Michigan by the Alpena Motor Car Company. Approximately 480 cars in 13 models were produced, costing around $1,500, and only one remaining car is known to exist today. The car was intended to be light and inexpensive, and to make Alpena into an &quot;Automobile City&quot;.

==Models==
The Alpena Flyer was produced as a standard touring car for 4 or 5 passengers; a four-door, 5 passenger touring car; and a roadster. Prices for the 1911 Alpena Flyer standard touring car was $1450; the four-door, 5 passenger car was $1600; and the roadster was $1450.

The Alpena Flyer was designed for speed, using unit engine/gearbox construction with three-point suspension. Specifications of the 1911 model included a four-cylinder engine made by Northway or Rutenber. It had almost 40 horsepower, disc clutch, water cooling, a Splitdorf magneto, Schebler carburetor, sliding gear transmission with three speeds and reverse, a wheelbase, wheels and 24 inch x -inch tires, and torque tube drive. It weighed and was offered only in dark royal blue.

The 1912 Alpena Flyer had 7 models, which included a 40-horsepower engine, 120&quot; wheelbase, 36x4 tires, electric lights, self-start, 3 oil lamps, 2 gas headlamps, and removable rims.

1912 Model J - Alpena &quot;thirty&quot; 4 door touring

1912 Model F - Alpena &quot;forty&quot; four-door touring car

1912 Model G - Alpena &quot;forty&quot; Gentlemen&#x27;s Speedster

==History==
In 1911 the Alpena Flyer was advertised as &quot;The Greatest, Biggest and Most Sensational Actual Values In The Automobile World For $1450.00.&quot;

Alpena Motor Car ran into legal and financial problems shortly after the Flyer was first built. In 1912, the company was sued for patent infringement over its suspension design. The patent holder, Emile Huber, brought suit against the company, and the car manufacturer was fined $400,000 for the offense. A cash shortage followed and the company was insolvent by 1914.

Of the several hundred cars built by Alpena Motor Car, just one example survives, on display in Alpena at the Besser Museum. This example is a 1911 Standard Touring Alpena Flyer.

Production figures are unclear, but the company likely did not make more than 1,000 cars. Some estimate that it only produced a few hundred units.

<text>Queensland Rail (QR) is a railway operator in Queensland, Australia. Queensland Rail is owned by the Queensland Government, and operates both suburban and interurban rail services in South East Queensland, as well as long-distance passenger train services connecting Brisbane to regional Queensland. QR also owns and maintains rolling stock, in addition to approximately of track and related infrastructure.

==History==

===Early history===

Queensland Railways was the first operator in the world to adopt a narrow gauge (in this case ) for a main line, and this remains the system-wide gauge in Queensland.

The colony of Queensland separated from New South Wales in 1859, and the new government was keen to facilitate development and immigration. Improved transport to the fertile Darling Downs region situated west of Toowoomba was seen as a priority. As adequate river transport was already established between the capital Brisbane and the then separate settlement of Ipswich, the railway commenced from the latter locality and the initial section, built over the relatively flat, easy country opened to Bigge&#x27;s Camp, at the eastern base of the Little Liverpool Range, on 31 July 1865. Called the Main Line, the only significant engineering work on that section was the bridge over the Bremer River to North Ipswich.

Tunneling excavation through the Little Liverpool Range delayed the opening of the next section to Gatton by 10 months, but the line was opened to Toowoomba in 1867, the ascent of the Main Range being the reason for the adoption of narrow gauge.

Built by the Queensland Government to the unusual (for the time) gauge of , the line largely followed the alignment surveyed by a private company, the Moreton Bay Tramway Company, which had proposed to build a horse-drawn tramway but had been unable to raise funds to do so beyond an initial start on earthworks.

The adoption of a narrow gauge was controversial at the time and was largely predicated by the government&#x27;s desire for the fastest possible construction timeframe at the least cost. This resulted in the adoption of sharper curves and a lower axle load than was considered possible using the standard gauge, and an assessment at the time put the cost of a narrow gauge line from Ipswich to Toowoomba at 25% of the cost of a standard gauge line. In a colony with a non-indigenous population of 30,000 when the decision was made, it is understandable.

The network evolved as a series of isolated networks. It wasn&#x27;t until the completion of the North Coast line in December 1924 that all were joined. The exception was the Normanton to Croydon line which always remained isolated. At its peak in 1932, the network totaled .

Changing transport patterns resulted in the closure of many development branch lines from 1948 onwards, but at the same time the main lines were upgraded to provide contemporary services, and from the 1970s an extensive network of new lines was developed, particularly to service export coal mines.

===Electrification===

Commencing in November 1979, the Brisbane suburban network was electrified.

In 1978, discussions were commenced on the possible electrification of the Blackwater and Goonyella coal networks. This was due to an expected increase in coal traffic across the networks, an ageing diesel-electric locomotive fleet and the increase in diesel fuel costs. By early 1983, a decision had been made to electrify the networks and by early 1984, contracts were already starting to be let for the new locomotives and other works for the project. The decision was made to electrify with the 25 kV AC railway electrification system as used on the Brisbane suburban network. This would allow future connection of the Brisbane network with the coal networks via the North Coast line.

The project was to be carried out in four stages:

* Stage 1: Electrification of the main line from Gladstone to Rockhampton, including parts of Rockhampton marshalling yard, then west to Blackwater and the coal mines in the area. This was a total of of the track.
* Stage 2: Electrification of the coal lines south of Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point, then west through the Goonyella system, southwest to Blair Athol and south to Gregory – linking the Goonyella system to the Blackwater system. This was a total of of the track.
* Stage 3: Electrification of the main western line from Burngrove to Emerald. This would allow electric freight from Rockhampton to Emerald.
* Stage 4: Electrification of the line from Newlands coal mine to Collinsville and northeast to Abbott Point. This stage never went ahead. In 1986, it was decided to electrify the North Coast line between Brisbane and Gladstone instead and this became known as Stage 4.

===Interstate freight expansion===

In September 1999, Queensland Rail was rebranded as QR. In March 2002, Queensland Rail purchased Northern Rivers Railroad and rebranded it Interail, fulfilling a long-held ambition of expanding beyond its state borders.

In March 2003, Queensland Rail entered the Hunter Valley coal market when Interail commenced a contract from Duralie Colliery to Stratford Mine. Another coal contract was won in late 2003 for the haulage of coal from Newstan Colliery, Fassifern to Vales Point Power Station. In 2004, Interail began running Brisbane to Melbourne and Sydney to Melbourne intermodal services. In June 2005, Queensland Rail acquired the CRT Group.

In June 2006, the Western Australian business of the Australian Railroad Group was purchased.

===Privatisation and the current era===

QR was responsible for all Queensland freight services, and from 2002 operated interstate services under the Australian Railroad Group, Interail and QR National brands. These were all spun out into a separate entity in July 2010, and later privatised as Aurizon.
In June 2009, the Queensland Government announced the privatisation of Queensland Rail&#x27;s freight business. This resulted in Queensland Rail&#x27;s freight assets being transferred to QR National (now Aurizon) from 1 July 2010.

In April 2013, the Queensland Parliament passed the Queensland Rail Transit Authority Bill 2013 that restructured Queensland Rail. The explanatory notes published for the bill outlined that the existing Queensland Rail Limited entity would remain although no longer be a government-owned corporation and that entity would become a subsidiary of a new Queensland Rail Transit Authority (QRTA), in effect creating a Queensland Rail group. Under the revised arrangements Queensland Rail Limited retained assets and liabilities and staff were transferred to the QRTA. As a result of transferring the staff to the QRTA, the government moved those employees from the federal industrial relations system to the state-based industrial relations system, giving the state more control over industrial arrangements. In November 2013, five labour unions commenced legal proceedings in the High Court of Australia alleging that the QRTA was subject to the federal industrial jurisdiction rather than the state system. In April 2015, the court ruled the QRTA was subject to the Fair Work Act 2009 and the federal industrial relations jurisdiction.

=== Chief Executive Officers ===
==Services==
===South East Queensland===

QR operates urban and interurban rail services throughout South East Queensland as part of the Translink network. Rail services operate on twelve lines, Beenleigh, Caboolture, Cleveland, Doomben, Exhibition, Ferny Grove, Gold Coast, Ipswich–Rosewood, Redcliffe Peninsula, Shorncliffe, Springfield and Sunshine Coast. QR operate these with the Electric Multiple Units (EMU), Suburban Multiple Units (SMU), Interurban Multiple Units (IMU) and New Generation Rollingstock (NGR) class electric multiple units.

===Long-distance trains===
Queensland Rail operate five long-distance passenger rail services, under the brand name Queensland Rail Traveltrain:

*&quot;Tilt Train&quot;: Brisbane to Rockhampton 
*&quot;Spirit of Queensland&quot;: Brisbane to Cairns
*&quot;Spirit of the Outback&quot;: Brisbane to Longreach
*&quot;Westlander&quot;: Brisbane to Charleville
*&quot;Inlander&quot;: Townsville to Mount Isa

Connecting road coach services are operated.

Annual patronage all travel and tourism servies in 2022–23 was 690,000. In 2007/08, the subsidy for the Brisbane–Cairns route (NCL) was $130 million, or $900 per passenger. In 2001/02 it was $270 million.

===Tourist trains===
Queensland Rail also operate two tourist services:
*&quot;Gulflander&quot;: Normanton to Croydon
*Kuranda Scenic Railway: Cairns to Kuranda

===Former services===
Queensland Rail operated many named trains including:
*&quot;Capricornian&quot;: Brisbane to Rockhampton, operated from 1970 until 1993 when replaced by the &quot;Spirit of the Outback&quot; 
*&quot;Great South Pacific Express&quot;: Kuranda to Sydney luxury train operated from 1999 until 2003
*&quot;The Midlander&quot;: Rockhampton to Winton, operated from 1954 until 1993 when replaced by the &quot;Spirit of the Outback&quot; 
*&quot;Savannahlander&quot;: Cairns to Forsayth, operated from 1995 until 2004 when contracted out to a private operator
*&quot;Spirit of Capricorn&quot;: Brisbane to Rockhampton, operated from 1988 until 2003
*&quot;The Sunlander&quot;: Brisbane to Cairns, operated from 1953 until 2014 when replaced by the &quot;Spirit of Queensland&quot;

==Rolling stock==
QR sourced steam locomotives from many manufacturers including Armstrong Whitworth, Avonside Engine Company, Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company, Dübs &amp; Co, Kitson &amp; Co, Nasmyth, Wilson &amp; Co, Neilson and Company, North British Locomotive Company, Vulcan Foundry and Yorkshire Engine Company all of the United Kingdom, Baldwin Locomotive Works of the United States, as well as Australian manufacturers Clyde Engineering, Evans, Anderson, Phelan &amp; Co, Islington Railway Workshops, Newport Workshops, Phoenix Engine Company, Toowoomba Foundry and Walkers Limited. It also built some in-house at North Ipswich Railway Workshops.

In 1936, the company owned 750 locomotives, 67 railcars, 998 coaches, 94 mail cars, 177 brake vans and 18.699 goods wagons.

Dieselisation commenced in 1952 with early purchases being imported from GE Transportation and English Electric, before standardising on locally made products from A Goninan &amp; Co, Clyde Engineering, English Electric and Walkers Limited. Electric locomotives were purchased from Clyde Engineering, Walkers Limited and Siemens. Electric multiple units have been purchased from Walkers Limited, Downer Rail and Bombardier Transportation, the latter of two which are still present in Queensland to this day.

With the closure of many rural branch lines in the 1990s there was excess motive power on the QR and it was chosen to standardise by using Clyde based diesel locomotives. Most, if not all of the English Electric locomotives were withdrawn by 2000.

In June 2021 QR announced that it had shortlisted 3 applicants (Alstom, CAF and Downer Rail) to manufacture 20 (later expanded to 65) new electric multiple units. In 2023, it was confirmed that 65 new six-car units would be built by Downer Rail at a new state facility in Torbanlea, near Maryborough. These will allow for expansion of the fleet and retiring of the remaining EMU and ICE units.
 This table only includes locomotives owned by Queensland Rail. QR also hires locomotives from Aurizon as required.

==Workshops==
From its inception, QR&#x27;s primary workshops were the North Ipswich Railway Workshops. It was replaced by the Redbank Railway Workshops in the 1960s. The Mayne Yard rail precinct is now the forefront for the repairs and maintenance of the fleet.

==Incidents==

Notable incidents involving Queensland Rail include:

* On 9 June 1925, 9 people were killed in an accident near Traveston, atop a timber trestle bridge aboard the Rockhampton Mail service. The train was reported to have derailed, causing 2 cars (1 Passenger Car, and 1 Baggage Car) to fall into the Traveston Creek. The incident overall caused 9 fatalities and over 50 injuries.
* On 5 May 1947, a crowded charter train de-railed and crashed near Camp Mountain due to excessive speeds down a hill and a bend with 16 deaths. This accident is still the worst &quot;loss of life&quot; accident in Qld Rail history.
*On 25 February 1960, the East Bound Midlander derailed and drashed 1.5 km away from Bogantungan (Located Between Emerald and Barcaldine) on what is now called Spirit of the Outback Service. Floodwaters, had washed away a tree which hit some pylons holding the Medway Creek Bridge up. The east bound train hauled by two C17 locomotives, at the time had 120 passengers on-board. When the service arrived at the bridge at 2:32am, it plunged 7 – 1/2M into the creek bed after the bridge gave way. Floodwater quickly filled carriages. Both locomotives ended up in the water, as well as three passenger cars. Overall, seven People lost their lives and 43 people were injured. The Medway Creek disaster is seen as the worst in QR&#x27;s History.
* On 23 March 1985, two passenger trains collided head-on near Trinder Park station on the Beenleigh line. Two people died (one of whom was the driver of the south-bound train), and 31 people sustained injuries. Affected units EMU11 and EMU27 were both travelling concurrently on the single track section of the line, despite several &quot;fail-safe&quot; measures and the use of RCS (remote control signalling).
* On 21 September 2001, EMU units 05 and 60 collided with a cattle train near Petrie, causing two carriages of Unit 05 and one carriage of Unit 60 to be scrapped, with the three remaining carriages merged to form EMU 60.
* On 15 November 2004, a Diesel Tilt Train VCQ5 derailed at Berajondo on the North Coast Line due to excessive speed resulting in injuries to over 100 people.
* On 14 September 2012, EMU41 collided with a heavy vehicle that became grounded on the level crossing at St Vincent&#x27;s Road, Banyo, on the Shorncliffe line. The train driver performed all necessary braking measures, however they were not alerted in time and the train collided with the vehicle, causing extensive damage to the vehicle and the train (along with another train that was in the stationary near the crash). Injuries were sustained by both drivers.
* On 31 January 2013, IMU173 failed to stop at Cleveland station and collided with the station toilet block resulting in major damage to the train and minor injuries to several commuters and staff.
*On 18 June 2021, A Queensland Rail operated Train – at the time being used for driver training collided with a Loaded Aurizon Coal Train, at Westwood, West of Rockhampton. The incident occurred at 11:26am on an Aurizon operated trainline, while the locomotive was travelling to Bluff. The Queensland Rail Locomotive had three drivers onboard, two of whom suffered injuries. There was one fatality. The QR locomotive 2471 sustained severe damage, with the Aurizon locomotive sustaining less substantial damage. A report of the incident is due in Q2 2022.

<text>Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster is a 1997 bestselling nonfiction book written by Jon Krakauer. It details Krakauer&#x27;s experience in the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, in which eight climbers were killed and several others were stranded by a storm. Krakauer&#x27;s expedition was led by guide Rob Hall. Other groups were trying to summit on the same day, including one led by Scott Fischer, whose guiding agency, Mountain Madness, was perceived as a competitor to Hall&#x27;s agency, Adventure Consultants.

==Summary==
Krakauer describes the events leading up to his eventual decision to participate in an Everest expedition in May 1996, despite having mostly given up mountain climbing years before. Krakauer was a journalist for the adventure magazine &quot;Outside&quot;, and initially his intention to climb Everest had been purely professional. He had planned to climb only as far as the mountain&#x27;s base camp, and to report on the commercialization of the mountain. However, the idea of going to Everest reawakened his childhood desire to climb the mountain. Krakauer asked his editor to put off publishing the story for a year so that he could train for a climb to the summit. 

From there, the book moves between describing events that took place on the mountain, and the unfolding tragedy, which occurs during the push to the summit. (The 1996 expedition season saw eight recorded deaths, including that of Krakauer&#x27;s guide, Rob Hall. It also saw the third-highest recorded number of deaths on the mountain in a single day. The April 2015 Nepal earthquake had caused the most, at 21.) Krakauer concludes that essential safety methods that had been adopted over the years by experienced guides on Everest were sometimes compromised by the competition between rival guiding agencies to get their respective clients to the summit.

==Controversy==
Krakauer&#x27;s recounting of certain aspects of the climb generated criticism, both from some of the climb&#x27;s participants and from fellow mountaineers such as Galen Rowell. Much of the criticism centers on Krakauer&#x27;s account of how Anatoli Boukreev, an experienced Kazakh high-altitude climber and guide for Scott Fischer, had handled the climb. Boukreev had descended the summit before his clients did, ostensibly out of concern for their safety, in order to prepare for potential rescue efforts. Although Krakauer acknowledged that Boukreev&#x27;s efforts after descending the mountain were heroic (he engaged in repeated solo rescue efforts, saving at least two climbers&#x27; lives), he questioned Boukreev&#x27;s judgment during the climb, in particular his decision to descend from the summit ahead of his clients, his decision not to use supplementary oxygen, his choices of gear on the mountain and his interactions with clients. Boukreev provided a rebuttal to these claims in his 1997 book, &quot;The Climb&quot;.

Mountaineer Galen Rowell criticized Krakauer&#x27;s account, citing numerous inconsistencies in his narrative, and observed that Krakauer had been asleep in his tent while Boukreev was rescuing other climbers. Rowell argued that not only were Boukreev&#x27;s actions heroic but his judgment was also prescient: “[Boukreev] foresaw problems with clients nearing camp, noted five other guides on the peak [Everest], and positioned himself to be rested and hydrated enough to respond to an emergency. His heroism was not a fluke.&quot;

Krakauer&#x27;s account has also been criticized for omitting to mention that the team members were receiving accurate daily weather forecasts and knew about the impending storm.

In Krakauer&#x27;s 1999 paperback edition of &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;, he addresses some of the criticisms in a detailed postscript.

==Adaptation==
Film rights for &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; were purchased by Sony almost immediately after the book&#x27;s publication. The book was adapted into the TV movie &quot;Into Thin Air: Death on Everest&quot; (1997), starring Peter Horton as Scott Fischer and Christopher McDonald as Krakauer. The book and the film both contain the same strong editorial viewpoint regarding the fundamental causes of the tragedy, although the film differs sharply from the book in details regarding responsibility.

The 2015 film &quot;Everest&quot;, by director Baltasar Kormákur, depicts the same events as the book, with actor Michael Kelly portraying Krakauer. According to Kormákur, it is not based on Krakauer&#x27;s book.

: This book puts forward evidence that detailed weather forecasts were being received by several groups well in advance of their teams&#x27; summit attempts. These forecasts highlighted clearly the oncoming strong storm that struck the mountain on 10th/11th May causing the tragedy. While most of Ratcliffe&#x27;s comments are directed towards the two expedition leaders for ignoring the forecasts and continuing on the summit attempts, thereby exposing clients to such high risk, he also makes clear that in his view, Krakauer and many others&#x27; description of the storm as &quot;sudden and unexpected&quot; is wholly inaccurate. Furthermore, Ratcliffe suggests that Krakauer, by not mentioning the forecasts, did not produce an accurate or adequately researched account.

<text>The &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; (copyright registered on September 18, 1899) is an early ragtime musical composition for piano composed by Scott Joplin. It was one of Joplin&#x27;s early works, becoming the model for ragtime compositions by subsequent composers. It is one of the most famous of all ragtime pieces. Its success led to Joplin being dubbed the &quot;King of Ragtime&quot; by his contemporaries. The piece gave Joplin a steady if unspectacular income for the rest of his life.

Despite ragtime&#x27;s decline after Joplin&#x27;s death in 1917, the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; continued to be recorded by many well-known artists. The ragtime revival of the 1970s brought it back to mainstream public notice once again.

== Background ==
The &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; is associated with the city of Sedalia, Missouri, although there is no record of Joplin having a permanent residence there before 1904. Joplin arrived in Sedalia in 1894 as a touring musician and stayed with the family of Arthur Marshall, who later became one of Joplin&#x27;s students and a ragtime composer in his own right. Joplin played as a solo musician at dances and at the major black clubs in Sedalia, among them the &quot;Maple Leaf Club&quot;. It is possible that the rag was named after the Maple Leaf Club, although there is no direct evidence to prove the link, and there were probably many other possible sources for the name in and around Sedalia at the time.

Although there were hundreds of rags in print by the time of the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&#x27;s&quot; publication, Joplin was not far behind. His first published rag was &quot;Original Rags&quot; (March 1899). The &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; was already known in Sedalia prior to its publication in 1899; composer and pianist Brun Campbell claimed to have seen the manuscript of the work in or around 1898. Prior to its publication, Joplin anticipated that the piece would be a success—he told Arthur Marshall that &quot;The Maple Leaf will make me the king of ragtime composers&quot;.

The exact circumstances which led to publication of the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; are unknown, and there are versions of the event which contradict each other. After approaching several publishers, Joplin signed a contract with John Stillwell Stark on August 10, 1899 for a royalty of one cent ($ in ) on all sales of the rag, with a minimum sales price of 25 cents($ in ). The &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; was published between August 10 and September 20, 1899, when the United States Copyright Office received two copies of the score. It was reissued in 1900 or 1901 with a new cover showing a green maple leaf and a photograph of Joplin. In 1903, Stark issued a &quot;Maple Leaf Rag Song&quot;, an arrangement of Joplin&#x27;s music with words by Sydney Brown.

== Structure ==
The &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; is a multi-strain ragtime march with athletic bass lines and offbeat melodies. Each of the four parts features a recurring theme and a striding bass line with copious seventh chords. The piece may be considered the &quot;archetypal rag&quot; due to its influence on the genre; its structure was the basis for many other rags, including &quot;Sensation&quot; by Joseph Lamb.

It is more carefully constructed than almost all the previous rags, and the syncopations, especially in the transition between the first and second strain, were novel at the time.

Generally, the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; is considered difficult to play; a pianist must have very good coordination in the left hand to perform it successfully, particularly for the trio, which involves leaps of two octaves. When it was published, it was considered significantly more difficult than the average Tin Pan Alley and early ragtime sheet music common at the time.

&quot;Gladiolus Rag,&quot; a later composition by Joplin, is a developed variant of the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; showcasing Joplin&#x27;s increasing musical sophistication, and is usually played at a somewhat slower tempo. In addition, the first strains of Joplin&#x27;s &quot;The Cascades,&quot; &quot;The Sycamore,&quot; &quot;Leola,&quot; and &quot;Sugar Cane&quot; are modeled on the structure Joplin created for the first strain of &quot;Maple Leaf Rag.&quot;

The composition starts in the key of A-flat major and changes to D-flat major during the first part of the trio, then modulates back to A-flat major.

==Lyrics==
In 1903, Stark issued a &quot;Maple Leaf Rag Song&quot;, an arrangement of Joplin&#x27;s music with words by Sydney Brown. Brown&#x27;s lyrics tell the story of a poor man from Accomack County, Virginia, who stumbles into a ballroom where, in spite of his anxiety over the state of his appearance, he manages to wow the crowd with the Maple Leaf Rag. While the men are jealous of his dancing abilities and draw their razors, the women love him, and the &quot;finest belle&quot; sends for a carriage and the two of them ride away.

Modern ragtime composer Ron O&#x27;Dell has commented that the song has characteristics in common with rap, such as the lyrical themes, the lyrics being written in the African American Vernacular English of the time, and the fact that the lyrics are sung over the least melodic strain of the music.

== Popularity and legacy ==

There have been many claims about the sales of the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;, for example that 1 million copies of the sheet music were sold in the composer&#x27;s lifetime, making Scott Joplin the first musician to sell 1 million copies of a piece of instrumental music. Joplin&#x27;s first biographer Rudi Blesh wrote that during its first six months the piece sold 75,000 copies, and became &quot;the first great instrumental sheet music hit in America&quot;. However, research by Joplin&#x27;s later biographer Edward A. Berlin demonstrated that this was not the case; the initial print-run of 400 took one year to sell, and under the terms of Joplin&#x27;s contract with a one-cent royalty would have given Joplin an income of $4, or approximately $ in . Later sales were steady and would have given Joplin an income which would have covered his expenses; in 1909 estimated sales would have given him an income of $600 annually (approximately $ in ).

In addition to sales of sheet music, it was also popular in orchestrations for dance bands and brass bands for years. Joplin failed to repeat the success of Maple Leaf Rag, with none of his other famous rags (such as &quot;The Entertainer&quot;) garnering as much popularity as the Maple Leaf Rag did. The royalties earned by the sheet music sales did provide Joplin with a steady income for the rest of his life, however.

Soon after the publication of the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;, the earliest recordings of the rag took place; band leader Wilbur Sweatman recorded it onto phonograph cylinder a year later, but there are no known copies which have survived. The earliest surviving record of the rag comes from the second known recording of the rag by the United States Marine Band from 1906.

While Joplin never made an audio recording, his playing is preserved on seven piano rolls for use in mechanical player pianos. All seven were made in 1916. Berlin theorizes that by the time Joplin made these recordings he may have been experiencing discoordination of the fingers, tremors and an inability to speak clearly, symptoms of syphilis, the disease that took his life in 1917. The recording of &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;, on the Aeolian Uni-Record label from June 1916 was described by biographer Blesh as &quot;shocking ... disorganized and completely distressing to hear&quot;. Berlin notes that the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; roll was &quot;painfully bad&quot; and likely to be the truest record of Joplin&#x27;s playing at the time. The roll, however, does not reflect his abilities earlier in life.

The piece was a selection in the White Star Line songbook in the early 1900s, and could have possibly been played aboard the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; during its ill-fated maiden voyage in 1912.

The tune continued to be in the repertoire of jazz bands decades later, with artists such as the New Orleans Rhythm Kings in the 1920s, and Sidney Bechet in the 1930s giving it up-to-date adaptations, maintaining a timeless quality to it. As an indication of its persistent popularity and recognition, it was performed on phonograph records six times in each of the three decades after its first publication. In 1930, it was featured in the gangster movie classic, &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;. &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; was the Joplin piece found most often on 78 rpm records.

In November 1970, Joshua Rifkin released a recording called &quot;Scott Joplin: Piano Rags&quot; on the classical label Nonesuch, which featured as its first track the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;. It sold 100,000 copies in its first year and eventually became Nonesuch&#x27;s first million-selling record. The Billboard &quot;Best-Selling Classical LPs&quot; chart for September 28, 1974 has the record at number 5, with the follow-up &quot;Volume 2&quot; at number 4, and a combined set of both volumes at number 3. Separately both volumes had been on the chart for 64 weeks. The album was nominated in 1971 for two Grammy Award categories: Best Album Notes and Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra), but at the ceremony on March 14, 1972, Rifkin did not win in any category. In 1979 Alan Rich in &quot;New York&quot; magazine wrote that by giving artists like Rifkin the opportunity to put Joplin&#x27;s music on disk Nonesuch Records &quot;created, almost alone, the Scott Joplin revival.&quot;

An 8-bit version of the music is used in the 1983 Bally Midway arcade game Domino Man as background music.

The &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; is still a favorite of ragtime pianists, and has been described as an &quot;American institution ... still in print and still popular&quot;. As the copyright has expired, the composition is in the public domain. It appears in the soundtracks of hundreds of films, cartoons, commercials, and video games. In 2004, Canadian radio listeners voted it the 39th greatest song of all time.

Most recently, Maple Leaf Rag was featured as one of the piano exam pieces in Grade 8 for the years 2025 and 2026, by the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM).

In Joplin&#x27;s will, he requested that &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; be played at his funeral. When preparations were being made, however, his wife, Lottie Stokes did not allow it, because she did not think it was a proper funeral song. She later admitted regretting that decision her whole life.

<text>The Alsace was an American automobile manufactured by Piedmont between 1920 and 1921 for Automotive Products Co. of New York, made with right-hand drive for export purposes.

The car differed from other Piedmont products chiefly because it used a Rolls-Royce-shaped radiator. It had a wheelbase of and employed a 3.1 litre four-cylinder Herschell-Spillman engine.

<text>In computer science, the process calculi (or process algebras) are a diverse family of related approaches for formally modelling concurrent systems. Process calculi provide a tool for the high-level description of interactions, communications, and synchronizations between a collection of independent agents or processes. They also provide algebraic laws that allow process descriptions to be manipulated and analyzed, and permit formal reasoning about equivalences between processes (e.g., using bisimulation). Leading examples of process calculi include CSP, CCS, ACP, and LOTOS. More recent additions to the family include the π-calculus, the ambient calculus, PEPA, the fusion calculus and the join-calculus.

== Essential features ==

While the variety of existing process calculi is very large (including variants that incorporate stochastic behaviour, timing information, and specializations for studying molecular interactions), there are several features that all process calculi have in common:

* Representing interactions between independent processes as communication (message-passing), rather than as modification of shared variables.
* Describing processes and systems using a small collection of primitives, and operators for combining those primitives.
* Defining algebraic laws for the process operators, which allow process expressions to be manipulated using equational reasoning.

== Mathematics of processes ==

To define a process calculus, one starts with a set of &quot;names&quot; (or &quot;channels&quot;) whose purpose is to provide means of communication. In many implementations, channels have rich internal structure to improve efficiency, but this is abstracted away in most theoretic models. In addition to names, one needs a means to form new processes from old ones. The basic operators, always present in some form or other, allow:

* parallel composition of processes
* specification of which channels to use for sending and receiving data
* sequentialization of interactions
* hiding of interaction points
* recursion or process replication

=== Parallel composition ===
Parallel composition of two processes formula_1 and formula_2, usually written formula_3, is the key primitive distinguishing the process calculi from sequential models of computation. Parallel composition allows computation in formula_1 and formula_2 to proceed simultaneously and independently. But it also allows interaction, that is synchronisation and flow of information from formula_1 to formula_2 (or vice versa) on a channel shared by both. Crucially, an agent or process can be connected to more than one channel at a time.

Channels may be synchronous or asynchronous. In the case of a synchronous channel, the agent sending a message waits until another agent has received the message. Asynchronous channels do not require any such synchronization. In some process calculi (notably the π-calculus) channels themselves can be sent in messages through (other) channels, allowing the topology of process interconnections to change. Some process calculi also allow channels to be &quot;created&quot; during the execution of a computation.

=== Communication ===
Interaction can be (but isn&#x27;t always) a &quot;directed&quot; flow of information. That is, input and output can be distinguished as dual interaction primitives. Process calculi that make such distinctions typically define an input operator (&quot;e.g.&quot; formula_8) and an output operator (&quot;e.g.&quot; formula_9), both of which name an interaction point (here formula_10) that is used to synchronise with a dual interaction primitive.

Should information be exchanged, it will flow from the outputting to the inputting process. The output primitive will specify the data to be sent. In formula_9, this data is formula_12. Similarly, if an input expects to receive data, one or more bound variables will act as place-holders to be substituted by data, when it arrives. In formula_8, formula_14 plays that role. The choice of the kind of data that can be exchanged in an interaction is one of the key features that distinguishes different process calculi.

=== Sequential composition ===

Sometimes interactions must be temporally ordered. For example, it might be desirable to specify algorithms such as: &quot;first receive some data on formula_10 and then send that data on formula_16&quot;. &quot;Sequential composition&quot; can be used for such purposes. It is well known from other models of computation. In process calculi, the sequentialisation operator is usually integrated with input or output, or both. For example, the process formula_17 will wait for an input on formula_10. Only when this input has occurred will the process formula_1 be activated, with the received data through formula_10 substituted for identifier formula_21.

=== Reduction semantics ===
The key operational reduction rule, containing the computational essence of process calculi, can be given solely in terms of parallel composition, sequentialization, input, and output. The details of this reduction vary among the calculi, but the essence remains roughly the same. The reduction rule is:

:formula_22

The interpretation to this reduction rule is:
# The process formula_23 sends a message, here formula_16, along the channel formula_10. Dually, the process formula_26 receives that message on channel formula_10.
# Once the message has been sent, formula_23 becomes the process formula_1, while formula_26 becomes the process formula_31, which is formula_2 with the place-holder formula_21 substituted by formula_16, the data received on formula_10.
The class of processes that formula_1 is allowed to range over as the continuation of the output operation substantially influences the properties of the calculus.

=== Hiding ===
Processes do not limit the number of connections that can be made at a given interaction point. But interaction points allow interference (i.e. interaction). For the
synthesis of compact, minimal and compositional systems, the ability to restrict interference is crucial. &quot;Hiding&quot; operations allow control of the connections made between interaction points when composing
agents in parallel. Hiding can be denoted in a variety of ways. For example, in the π-calculus the hiding of a name formula_10 in formula_1 can be expressed as formula_39, while in CSP it might be written as formula_40.
=== Recursion and replication ===
The operations presented so far describe only finite interaction and are consequently insufficient for full computability, which includes non-terminating behaviour. &quot;Recursion&quot; and &quot;replication&quot; are operations that allow finite descriptions of infinite behaviour. Recursion is well known from the sequential world. Replication formula_41 can be understood as abbreviating the parallel composition of a countably infinite number of formula_1 processes:

:formula_43

=== Null process ===
Process calculi generally also include a &quot;null process&quot; (variously denoted as formula_44, formula_45, formula_46, formula_47, or some other appropriate symbol) which has no interaction points. It is utterly inactive and its sole purpose is to act as the inductive anchor on top of which more interesting processes can be generated.

==Discrete and continuous process algebra==

Process algebra has been studied for discrete time and continuous time (real time or dense time).

== History ==

In the first half of the 20th century, various formalisms were proposed to capture the informal concept of a &quot;computable function&quot;, with μ-recursive functions, Turing machines and the lambda calculus possibly being the best-known examples today. The surprising fact that they are essentially equivalent, in the sense that they are all encodable into each other, supports the Church-Turing thesis. Another shared feature is more rarely commented on: they all are most readily understood as models of &quot;sequential&quot; computation. The subsequent consolidation of computer science required a more subtle formulation of the notion of computation, in particular explicit representations of concurrency and communication. Models of concurrency such as the process calculi, Petri nets in 1962, and the actor model in 1973 emerged from this line of inquiry.

Research on process calculi began in earnest with Robin Milner&#x27;s seminal work on the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) during the period from 1973 to 1980. C.A.R. Hoare&#x27;s Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) first appeared in 1978, and was subsequently developed into a full-fledged process calculus during the early 1980s. There was much cross-fertilization of ideas between CCS and CSP as they developed. In 1982 Jan Bergstra and Jan Willem Klop began work on what came to be known as the Algebra of Communicating Processes (ACP), and introduced the term &quot;process algebra&quot; to describe their work. CCS, CSP, and ACP constitute the three major branches of the process calculi family: the majority of the other process calculi can trace their roots to one of these three calculi.

== Current research ==

Various process calculi have been studied and not all of them fit the paradigm sketched here. The most prominent example may be the ambient calculus. This is to be expected as process calculi are an active field of study. Currently research on process calculi focuses on the following problems.

* Developing new process calculi for better modeling of computational phenomena.
* Finding well-behaved subcalculi of a given process calculus. This is valuable because (1) most calculi are fairly &quot;wild&quot; in the sense that they are rather general and not much can be said about arbitrary processes; and (2) computational applications rarely exhaust the whole of a calculus. Rather they use only processes that are very constrained in form. Constraining the shape of processes is mostly studied by way of type systems.
* Logics for processes that allow one to reason about (essentially) arbitrary properties of processes, following the ideas of Hoare logic.
* Behavioural theory: what does it mean for two processes to be the same? How can we decide whether two processes are different or not? Can we find representatives for equivalence classes of processes? Generally, processes are considered to be the same if no context, that is other processes running in parallel, can detect a difference. Unfortunately, making this intuition precise is subtle and mostly yields unwieldy characterisations of equality (which in most cases must also be undecidable, as a consequence of the halting problem). Bisimulations are a technical tool that aids reasoning about process equivalences.
* Expressivity of calculi. Programming experience shows that certain problems are easier to solve in some languages than in others. This phenomenon calls for a more precise characterisation of the expressivity of calculi modeling computation than that afforded by the Church–Turing thesis. One way of doing this is to consider encodings between two formalisms and see what properties encodings can potentially preserve. The more properties can be preserved, the more expressive the target of the encoding is said to be. For process calculi, the celebrated results are that the synchronous π-calculus is more expressive than its asynchronous variant, has the same expressive power as the higher-order π-calculus, but is less than the ambient calculus.
* Using process calculus to model biological systems (stochastic π-calculus, BioAmbients, Beta Binders, BioPEPA, Brane calculus). It is thought by some that the compositionality offered by process-theoretic tools can help biologists to organise their knowledge more formally.

== Software implementations ==
The ideas behind process algebra have given rise to several tools including:

* CADP
* Concurrency Workbench
* mCRL2 toolset

== Relationship to other models of concurrency ==
The history monoid is the free object that is generically able to represent the histories of individual communicating processes. A process calculus is then a formal language imposed on a history monoid in a consistent fashion. That is, a history monoid can only record a sequence of events, with synchronization, but does not specify the allowed state transitions. Thus, a process calculus is to a history monoid what a formal language is to a free monoid (a formal language is a subset of the set of all possible finite-length strings of an alphabet generated by the Kleene star).

The use of channels for communication is one of the features distinguishing the process calculi from other models of concurrency, such as Petri nets and the actor model (see Actor model and process calculi). One of the fundamental motivations for including channels in the process calculi was to enable certain algebraic techniques, thereby making it easier to reason about processes algebraically.

<doc id="853245" wikidata="Q1202416" url="?curid=853245" title="The Living Theatre">
<text>The Living Theatre is an American theatre company founded in 1947 and based in New York City. It is the oldest experimental theatre group in the United States. For most of its history it was led by its founders, actress Judith Malina and painter/poet Julian Beck. After Beck&#x27;s death in 1985, company member Hanon Reznikov became co-director with Malina; the two were married in 1988. After Malina&#x27;s death in 2015, her responsibilities were taken over by her son Garrick Maxwell Beck, Tom Walker and Brad Burgess. The Living Theatre and its founders were the subject of the 1983 documentary &quot;Signals Through the Flames&quot;.

== History ==
In the 1950s, the group was among the first in the U.S. to produce the work of influential European playwrights such as Bertolt Brecht (&quot;In The Jungle of Cities&quot; in New York, 1960) and Jean Cocteau, as well as modernist poets such as T. S. Eliot and Gertrude Stein. One of their first major productions was Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Desire Caught By the Tail&quot;; other early productions were &quot;Many Loves&quot; by William Carlos Williams and Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Tonight We Improvise&quot;.

Based in a variety of small New York locations which were frequently closed due to financial problems or conflicts with city authorities, they helped to originate off-off-Broadway and off-Broadway as significant forces in U.S. theater. Their work during this period shared some aspects of style and content with Beat generation writers. Also during the 1950s, the American composer Alan Hovhaness worked closely with the Living Theatre, composing music for its productions. In 1959, their production of &quot;The Connection&quot; attracted national attention for its harsh portrayal of drug addiction and its equally harsh language. In the early 1960s the Living Theatre was host to avant-garde minimalist performances by artists including Simone Forti and Robert Morris.

&quot;The Brig&quot; (1963), an anti-authoritarian look at conditions in a Marine prison, was their last major production in New York before a tax dispute led to the closure of the theatre space and the brief imprisonment of Beck and Malina. Judith defended Julian at the IRS hearing dressed like Portia from &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. For the rest of the 1960s, the group toured chiefly in Europe. They produced more politically and formally radical work carrying an anarchist and pacifist message, with the company members creating plays collectively and often living together. Major works from this period included the adaptations &quot;Antigone&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, and &quot;Paradise Now&quot;, which became their best-known play. &quot;Paradise Now&quot;, a semi-improvisational piece involving audience participation, was notorious for a scene in which actors recited a list of social taboos that included nudity, while disrobing; this led to multiple arrests for indecent exposure.

The group returned to the U.S. in 1968 to tour &quot;Paradise Now&quot;, &quot;Antigone&quot;, &quot;Mysteries and Smaller Pieces&quot;, and &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. &quot;That madman who inspires us all, Artaud, does have some advice,&quot; Beck said in an informal address at Yale University after his return, &quot;and I think he is the philosopher, for those of us who work in theatre, whom we can reach toward most quickly, of whom we can say, yes, here is one man since Rousseau who does uphold the idea of the non-civilized man.&quot; He added: &quot;Our work had always striven to stress the sacredness of life.&quot; In 1971 they toured in Brazil, where they were imprisoned for several months, then deported.

The Living Theatre has toured extensively throughout the world, often in non-traditional venues such as streets and prisons. It has greatly influenced other American experimental theatre companies, notably The Open Theater (founded by former Living Theatre member Joseph Chaikin) and Bread and Puppet Theater. The Living Theatre&#x27;s productions have won four Obie Awards: &quot;The Connection&quot; (1959), &quot;The Brig&quot; (1963 and 2007), and &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1968).

In 2006, The Living Theatre signed a 10-year lease on the basement of a new residential building under construction at 21 Clinton Street, between Houston and Stanton Streets on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. The Clinton Street theater is the company&#x27;s first permanent home since the closing of The Living Theatre on Third Street at Avenue C in 1993. The company moved into the completed space in early 2007 and opened in April 2007 with a revival of &quot;The Brig&quot; by Kenneth H. Brown, first presented at The Living Theatre at 14th Street and Sixth Avenue in 1963. The re-staging, directed by Judith Malina, won Obie Awards for Direction and Ensemble Performance.

In October 2006, the company opened a revival of &quot;Mysteries and Smaller Pieces&quot;, the 1964 collective creation that defined the interactive and Artaudian style for which the company became famous.

In late 2007 / early 2008 the company founder Judith Malina performed in &quot;Maudie and Jane&quot;, a stage adaptation, directed by Reznikov, of the Doris Lessing novel, &quot;The Diary of Jane Somers&quot;.

In April 2008, Hanon Reznikov suffered a stroke. He died on May 3, 2008.

In 2010, the company presented &quot;Red Noir&quot;, adapted and directed by Judith Malina. In 2011, the company presented &quot;Korach&quot;, by Malina, and a revival of &quot;Seven Meditations on Political Sado-Masochism&quot;, directed by Malina and Tom Walker. Also in 2011, the company created &quot;The Plot Is The Revolution&quot;, starring Malina and Silvia Calderoni, a co-production with the Italian group Motus. In 2012, the company presented &quot;The History of the World&quot;, written and directed by Malina. In 2013, the company presented &quot;Here We Are&quot;, written and directed by Malina. The company also vacated its Clinton Street space.

In 2014, Judith Malina&#x27;s play &quot;No Place to Hide&quot; premiered at the Clemente Soto Velez Center on the Lower East Side. The production later took to the streets of New York for the Underground Zero Festival, and was performed at Burning Man. Malina was writing &quot;Venus and Mars&quot; when she died in April 2015.

== Goals and influences ==
From its conception, The Living Theatre was dedicated to transforming the organization of power within society from a competitive, hierarchical structure to cooperative and communal expression. The troupe attempts to do so by counteracting complacency in the audience through direct spectacle. They oppose the commercial orientation of Broadway productions and have contributed to the off-Broadway theater movement in New York City, staging poetic dramas.

The primary text for The Living Theatre is &quot;The Theatre and its Double&quot;, an anthology of essays written by Antonin Artaud, the French playwright. It was published in France in 1937 and by the Grove Press in the U.S. in 1958. This work deeply influenced Julian Beck, a bisexual painter of abstract expressionist works. The troupe reflects Artaud&#x27;s influence by staging multimedia plays designed to exhibit his metaphysical Theatre of Cruelty. In these performances, the actors attempt to dissolve the &quot;fourth wall&quot; between them and the spectators.

<text>The Legacy Centre of Excellence is an intercultural arts centre in the Newtown area of Aston, Birmingham, England.

==History==
The centre occupies the site of the former Aston Hippodrome, which was a major variety theatre between 1908 and 1960. The Aston Hippodrome hosted performances by the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Judy Garland and Morecambe and Wise. The building was demolished in 1980, but in 1991 Birmingham City Council set up a project to create a new cultural facility on the site, specifically to reflect the highly diverse culture of the surrounding area.

The Drum started hosting events in 1994, the first being an exhibition called &quot;Negritude&quot;. In 1996, the singer Cleo Laine accepted a cheque from the National Lottery on behalf of The Drum. The Drum Arts Centre was fully opened in 1998 and established itself as the United Kingdom&#x27;s national centre for Black British and British Asian arts. Activities included music, drama, spoken word, exhibitions, visual arts, comedy and dance.

In October 2013, during Black History Month, The Drum was visited by then British Prime Minister David Cameron, who was shown around the venue by its CEO Charles Small.

In 2014, poet Benjamin Zephaniah and musician Courtney Pine were made patrons of The Drum, using their influence to help raise funds for a refit of the venue. In 2015, the establishment was approved for its first major renovation and extension since it first opened.

===Closure===
In March 2016, however, the decision was taken liquidate, amid financial troubles. The announcement to close was caused outrage among community representatives and residents. Birmingham musician Laura Mvula described the news as &quot;terrible&quot;. An online community petition to save the venue from closure was signed by 3,294 people but was unsuccessful in its campaign. The Drum Arts Centre permanently closed its doors on 30 June 2016.

==Reopening==
The centre was reopened in September 2019 under new management as the Legacy Centre of Excellence, billed by its new owners as &quot;Europe’s largest independent Black-owned Business and Arts Centre&quot;.

==Facilities==
The centre has two auditoria, the 350-seat main auditorium and a 120-seat &quot;Andy Hamilton Studio,&quot; named after saxophonist Andy Hamilton. It also has an exhibition space, a cafe-bar, a business suite and a multimedia production suite.

The venue is also available for private hire.

<doc id="853268" wikidata="Q1825008" url="?curid=853268" title="Alta Car and Engineering Company">
<text>The Alta Car and Engineering Company was a British sports and racing car manufacturer, commonly known simply as Alta. Their cars contested five FIA World Championship races between 1950 and 1952, as well as Grand Prix events prior to this. They also supplied engines to a small number of other constructors, most notably the Connaught and HWM teams.

==Early history==
The company was founded by engineer Geoffrey Taylor (1903–1966) in Surbiton, Surrey, and produced its first automobile in 1929. Alta&#x27;s first vehicle was a sports car powered by a 1.1L engine, featuring an aluminium block, wet liners, and shaft-driven twin overhead camshafts, which Taylor designed himself. It was offered in naturally aspirated or supercharged form giving . A choice of four speed non-synchromesh or pre-selector gearboxes was available. These were mounted on a low-slung chassis frame with open two- or four-seat bodies. Thirteen were made, of which five are thought to survive.
This design, and its later 1.5L and 2L sister cars, sold steadily, but in limited numbers, right up to the outbreak of war in 1939. With the highest power option the car was capable of and 0–60 mph in 7 seconds. In 1937 the company introduced front independent suspension to the chassis. They became popular among club racers due to their ability to be converted easily from 1.5L to 2L or &quot;vice versa&quot;, allowing drivers on a limited budget to contest more than one class without having to buy a second car.


In 1934, Taylor produced the first Alta to be designed solely for competition. The resulting light-weight, off-set single seat voiturette cars achieved quite a reputation in shorter events such as hill-climbs, sprints, and time-trials. Once again, Alta&#x27;s keen pricing, in comparison to the expensive ERA models, resulted in many sales to amateur racers. However, a lack of reliability kept the Alta name out of the long distance Grand Prix events. A revised voiturette design appeared in 1937, with independent front suspension. George Abecassis had some success with this design, winning a string of events before the Second World War interrupted. As war approached, Taylor was drafting designs for a new straight-8 engine and a third-generation voiturette, this time with fully independent suspension. This last prewar car was highly advanced for its time, and was very nearly complete in late 1939. However, as soon as war was declared, Alta&#x27;s production capabilities were given over to the war effort, and production of the new designs was halted.

In February 2018, a 1936 Alta 2-Litre Sports (chassis no. 64S) sold at Bonhams&#x27; Paris auction for 345,000€ inc. premium.

==Post-war==

===Alta GP===

Despite Alta&#x27;s diminutive size, and their status as a primarily road car manufacturer, Alta was in fact the first British constructor to produce a new Grand Prix car following the end of World War II. Austerity limitations of raw materials did not stop Taylor beginning production of designs he had been developing throughout the war years, and the Alta GP car appeared in 1948. He also restarted production of the road-going sports cars, although without further development funding the popularity of these models rapidly dwindled. Prior to 1948, the last pre-war Alta was campaigned with varying degrees of success.

The Alta GP car was a development of the pre-war design, but was powered by a supercharged 1.5L engine, developing approximately 230bhp, and retained the 4-speed pre-selector gearbox of the prewar cars. Taylor developed the independent suspension design further, introducing wishbones and rubber linkage bushings. The first car was supplied to privateer driver George Abecassis, who campaigned it throughout 1948 and into 1949, but only finished once. Abecassis would go on to use Alta engines to power his HWM team from 1951 to 1955.

Modifications were made to the bodywork and gearchange for the subsequent 1949 and 1950 GP2 and GP3 vehicles, GP3 also gaining a two-stage supercharger. Once again they were built to order, and supplied to Geoffrey Crossley and Joe Kelly respectively. Crossley took GP2 to the 1949 Belgian Grand Prix, but could only manage seventh place. In 1950 he set a number of speed records over 50 miles, 50 km and 100 km at the Montlhéry circuit. Kelly concentrated mostly on Irish races, and his best finish was third in the 1952 Ulster Trophy. Both drivers took their respective chassis to the 1950 British Grand Prix, the first ever Formula One World Championship race. However, while Kelly finished, he was unclassified; Crossley retired with a transmission fault.

Kelly later carried out extensive modification and rebuilding work on GP3, running it as the Irish Racing Automobiles (IRA) car during 1952 and 1953. His most significant change was to replace the Alta engine with a Bristol unit.

===Alta F2===
Lacking the funding necessary to develop a Formula One successor to the GP design, Taylor decided to move into the junior Formula Two category. The engine produced was a 1970 cc inline 4-cylinder, naturally aspirated unit, developing around . Unfortunately, Alta&#x27;s own chassis design followed the preceding GP car very closely, and this resulted in an overweight car considering the greatly reduced power available from the unsupercharged motors. Tony Gaze and Gordon Watson took F2/1 and F2/2 on a tour of European races, but good results were hard to come by.

Although according to Dennis Jenkinson&#x27;s book &quot;Historic Racing Cars&quot; the uncompleted GP4 machine was converted and became F2/3 this was not correct and chassis GP4 was sold to Bobbie Baird in Ireland and eventually became a Jaguar engined 2 seater sportscar. It competed in this form and still exists as a Jaguar 2 seater sportscar. F2/3 was no more successful than its siblings. F2/4 followed in construction and was sold to Orlando Simpson before Peter Whitehead placed an order for what was to become the last Alta car built: F2/5. This F2 Alta was entered for World Championship Grands Prix events, first driven by himself in the 1952 French Grand Prix, and then by his half-brother Graham Whitehead at the 1952 British Grand Prix. Neither run produced a points finish, but this was not to be the last time that the Alta name appeared in Formula One.

===Alta the engine supplier===

While the F2 engine might have been overwhelmed by the chassis&#x27; bulk, tweaks made by Peter Whitehead to the unit in his car showed that the design had tuning potential. Alta engines had already been used by the HWM team since 1949, and from 1953 many more mechanics would come to know the Taylor-designed power plant. Peter Whitehead led the way by removing the engine from F2/5 and installing it into a Cooper T24 chassis, which he ran in the 1953 British Grand Prix. Also present at Silverstone that day were no fewer than four Alta-powered HWM cars. HWM had, the previous year, scored what was Alta&#x27;s only significant victory, when Lance Macklin won the 1952 BRDC International Trophy race at Silverstone. Over the next few years 1.5L and 2.5L Alta engines would find their way into many British-built F1 hopefuls, the most successful of which were Connaught and Cooper. Ultimately the engine would prove to be capable of approximately . With the collapse of Connaught in 1959, the Alta name disappeared from Formula One for good.

===Aftermarket speed equipment===

After World War Two, Alta produced aftermarket speed equipment. Their best known product was an overhead valve head conversion kit for the early Morris Minor &amp; Morris Eight, which came with a flathead engine. This allowed the 27 BHP flathead to double its power. They also made high compression cylinder heads for the Austin 7.

==Recent history==
Geoffrey Taylor died in 1966 at the age of 63. In 1976, his son Michael attempted to revive the Alta name with a Formula Ford car but was not successful. A handful of the pre-war sports and single seat cars survive, all in private ownership. GP101, which was originally owned by George Abecassis, was rebuilt for Phil Scragg as a hill climb car and is still in use. F2/5 has been reunited with its original powerplant and has participated in a number of Historic race meeting in recent years, including the 1999 Goodwood Revival meeting.

<text>The Altena was a Dutch motorcycle and automobile made by NV Haarlemsche Automobiel &amp; Motorrijwielfabriek, based in Haarlem-Heemstede from 1900 to 1906.
The first car built was powered by a 3.5 hp De Dion single-cylinder powerplant. From 1905 models having 8, 10, and 12 hp engines were offered.

The company was declared bankrupt in 1906 but a few cars were advertised into 1907.

It is estimated that some 40 or 50 cars were made.

<text>Origin (alternatively known as Wolverine: Origin or Origin: The True Story of Wolverine) is a six-issue comic book limited series published by Marvel Comics from November 2001 to July 2002, written by Bill Jemas, Joe Quesada and Paul Jenkins, and illustrated by Andy Kubert (pencils) and Richard Isanove (color).

&quot;Origin&quot; tells the story of the superhero Wolverine, best known as a member of the X-Men. Since the character first appeared in the early 1970s his history had often been shrouded in mystery, with bits of information revealed piecemeal over time (notably in &quot;Weapon X&quot;), but this series was the first to reveal Wolverine&#x27;s early days and his original background.

==Plot==

The series reveals that Wolverine was born James Howlett, the son of rich plantation owners in 19th-century Canada. He is a sickly child who suffers from allergies, so his loving father, John Howlett, Jr., brings an orphaned girl named Rose up from the town to be his companion. The two children also often play with Dog Logan, son of the Howletts&#x27; brutal groundskeeper, Thomas Logan (who looks a lot like the fully-grown Wolverine). Readers are led to believe that Dog was the young Wolverine, but this is later revealed to be not the case. The children&#x27;s friendship is spoiled by the tension between the boys&#x27; fathers centering on James&#x27; mother, Elizabeth, who went mad after her first son, John, died under mysterious circumstances years earlier. Rose later stumbles upon Elizabeth changing, and sees that she has three parallel scars along her ribs, hinting that John Howlett III had claws.

As a result of beatings and alcohol, Dog, over the next few years, becomes increasingly like his father, and his misdeeds, including an attempted assault on Rose and the killing of James&#x27; dog, become so violent that he and his father are expelled from the manor. Thomas returns for the purpose of robbing the Howlett estate and to convince Elizabeth to leave with him (it is implied that they had an affair and that Thomas may be the biological father of Elizabeth&#x27;s sons).

John Howlett enters the bedroom after hearing noises. Thomas kills John Howlett with a shotgun in front of all three children and Elizabeth. The horror of his father&#x27;s death causes James&#x27; powers to manifest for the first time, and he uses his claws to kill Thomas and injure Dog, before lapsing into shock. Elizabeth tells James &quot;Not you too&quot; (implying that something similar had happened to his deceased brother), rejecting him with disgust. James escapes and Rose follows him. Meanwhile, Elizabeth, surprisingly, cradles the body of Thomas Logan rather than that of her husband. After a few moments, with her shallow grip on reality shattered, she picks up Thomas&#x27; shotgun and kills herself in front of Dog.

Questioned by the police, Dog accuses Rose of the killings and the fact that she fled the scene with James appears to confirm this. James is still in shock and appears to have no recollection of what happened. This loss of memory is due to Wolverine&#x27;s/James&#x27; healing factor which, in effect, &quot;healed&quot; (by putting up a mental block) the mentally devastating traumas of witnessing his father&#x27;s death, the confusion at his mother&#x27;s anger towards him and the pain and surprise caused by the sudden manifestation of his claws. 

Rose seeks help from her aunt, her only relative, who rejects her, and even James&#x27; grandfather drives them both from the house due to the manifestation of James&#x27; powers, mentioning he has had to deal with this sort of thing before. They are given some money and take the train from Alberta to British Columbia, where they are given work in a stone quarry by the foreman, Smitty. Rose claims that her male companion is her cousin and, since they are on the run, calls him Logan to conceal his identity; though why she should choose the name of their enemy remains unexplained.

Over several years James/Logan strengthens physically, to the point where he no longer resembles the sickly child he had been, although his memory is still shattered. He often goes into the woods to hunt game, typically among a pack of wolves. He quickly becomes the head of the pack, and begins using his claws to hunt. He turns down Rose&#x27;s offers to tell him about his past, and reacts angrily when the subject comes up. She therefore keeps detailed notes in her diary.

James becomes close to the foreman, Smitty, who, in turn, develops romantic feelings toward Rose, which she returns. He courts her with books, including poetry by William Blake and a history of the samurai (warriors whom Wolverine of the X-Men would later model himself after). Logan&#x27;s public identity as her cousin makes it impossible for him to declare his own feelings for her. He seems to deal with his feelings by working hard at the quarry, and is given the nickname Wolverine by the local population, who compare his intense digging to a wolverine going after a root. He also develops a feud the with camp&#x27;s obese cook, &quot;Cookie&quot; Malone, who goes out of his way to cause trouble for Logan from the time he and Rose arrive. After years of enduring Malone&#x27;s abuses, Logan eventually gives him a beating after the cook provokes an explosion in the quarry and kills many workers in the process.

Smitty eventually asks Rose to marry him, which she accepts, and Smitty informs her that the cage fights are a fast and easy way to earn some extra money. He asks her to leave with him, which she is reluctant to do because of Logan. Logan sees Rose kissing Smitty and, feeling betrayed, later confronts her and confesses his feelings to her, though she rejects him for Smitty after he turns down her offer for him to go with them. Just before the couple leaves to be wed, Dog comes to the bar, originally sent by Old Man Howlett, on his deathbed, to find his heir. Logan works out his violence in a series of cage fights, and confronts Smitty at the last cage fight after venting his fury on Malone, and quickly has him at his mercy. Despite mixed feelings, Logan wishes Rose to be happy and allows Smitty to defeat him purposely.
After the last cage fight, Dog confronts Logan. Dog blames Logan for the events that led to his father&#x27;s death and is actually there for revenge. In the ensuing fight, Logan gives Dog a beating, but as he is about to kill him, Rose is accidentally impaled on Logan&#x27;s claws. Logan goes mad with grief (his healing factor throwing up another mental block due to accidentally killing his first love) and runs into the woods, where he stays for an as yet unknown amount of time, living like a wild animal. Smitty attempts to find him during this period and tries to bring him back to humanity, but fails as Logan no longer wishes to be found.

Logan would not let Rose tell him about his past, which he had forgotten anyway. Malone steals Rose&#x27;s few belongings, and spitefully burns her diary which contains the truth of Logan&#x27;s past.

==Themes==
Psychologist Suzana E. Flores argues that the narrative depicts complex childhood trauma and its effects, including dissociative amnesia and hypervigilance. Among other causes, Logan&#x27;s mother shows traits of a &quot;consciously absent mother&quot; partly as the result of the loss of her first child prior to his birth, and this led her to be &quot;unable to conceptualize caring for another child.&quot;

==Production==
For decades, Wolverine&#x27;s origins had been a mystery. After the success of the first &quot;X-Men&quot; film, it was decided that if the character&#x27;s origin was not told in the comic, it would be told on the film.

Paul Jenkins wanted certain characters, artwise and relationship-wise, to resonate with those knowledgeable about Wolverine&#x27;s character history. Smitty was supposed to look somewhat like Cyclops, and his relationship with Jean Grey lookalike Rose to be what sparks Wolverine&#x27;s jealousy in his fictional future. Similarly, Dog was to be a representation of Sabretooth, Wolverine&#x27;s greatest nemesis.

When an interviewer asked Jenkins whether the character Dog Logan was Sabretooth, Jenkins replied that he had not intended it to be him, but said he would not have a problem with another writer doing it later. In April 2009, Marvel Comics released a one-shot specialty comic entitled &quot;X-Men Origins: Sabretooth&quot;, which was part of a series of origin stories for a number of other X-Men characters. The comic chronicled some of Sabretooth&#x27;s earliest childhood experiences. Within the comic, it is revealed that Sabretooth&#x27;s childhood and early life, with the exception of being in an abusive family, differs distinctly from the life of Dog as shown in the &quot;Origin&quot; mini-series.

==Sales==
The final issue #6 of &quot;Origin&quot; was ranked second in sales for the January 2002 period with pre-order sales of 166,997.

==Sequel==
At 2013 San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel announced a sequel to the original limited series titled &quot;Origin II&quot;. Written by Kieron Gillen with art by Adam Kubert, brother of original artist Andy Kubert, the first issue was released in December 2013.

==In other media==
The film &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;, partially inspired by &quot;Origin&quot;, wherein James Howlett in 19th-century Canada discovers his mutant powers and Victor Creed is Logan&#x27;s half brother.

In the video game &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;, a trivia caption on the loading screens says Victor Creed&#x27;s nickname as a boy was &quot;Dog&quot;.

<text>The Alter Motor Car Company, of Plymouth, Michigan, produced over 1,000 automobiles between 1914 and 1916.

The company was organized on January 26, 1914, by Guy Hamilton, F.M. Woodward, and other local residents. Construction of the factory started in the spring of 1914. Soon after, they started production of the Alter designed by Clarence Alter of Manitowoc, Wisconsin. The car was made from component parts shipped to Plymouth by rail and then assembled at the Farmer Street factory.

At its peak, the factory employed 100 people, and produced 25 vehicles a day. January 1917, the company went into receivership, and closed. The factory building still stands on Farmer Street near downtown Plymouth, across from the Cultural Center. In 2000 it was restored and, as of October 2007, is home to the C.D. Sparling Co., a small manufacturing company.
The 1914 model was a five-passenger touring car. A roadster was later introduced. The 1916 Alter model was described as &quot;the classy look and finish of the higher priced cars&quot;, by the Plymouth Mail (local newspaper) on March 3, 1916. The 1916 model had a 27 horsepower 4-cylinder engine, fuel tank under the cowl, with a wheelbase of . The 1916 Alter sold for $685.

==Rarity==
Only one Alter model is still known to exist, car No. 75, a 1915 model Alter. In 1959, Mr. &amp; Mrs Dale Blair from Upper Sandusky, Ohio, drove to Plymouth to see the factory where the vehicle was built. He later displayed the vehicle in the Old Car Festival at Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan. Clarence Moore, a charter member of the Plymouth Historical Society eventually bought the car. It is now on display at the Plymouth Historical Museum.

<text>Kateb Yacine (; 2 August 1929 or 6 August 1929 – 28 October 1989) was an Algerian writer notable for his novels and plays, both in French and Algerian Arabic, and his advocacy of the Berber cause.

==Biography==
Kateb Yacine was officially born in 6 August 1929 in Constantine, though it is likely that his birth occurred four days earlier. Although his birth name is Yacine Kateb, he once said that he was so used to hearing his teachers calling out names with the last name first that he adopted Kateb Yacine as a pen name.

He was born into a scholarly maraboutic Chaoui Berber family from the modern Sedrata, in &quot;wilaya&quot; of Souk Ahras (in the Aurès region). His maternal grandfather was the &#x27;bach adel&#x27;, or deputy judge of the qadi in Condé Smendou (Zirout Youcef). His father was a lawyer, and the family followed him through his various assignments in different parts of the country. Young Kateb (which means &#x27;writer&#x27;), attended the Sedrata Quran school in 1937, then in 1938 the French school in Lafayette (Bougaa) in Little Kabylie, where the family had moved. In 1941 he enrolled in the colonial &#x27;collège&#x27; (secondary school) of Setif as a boarder.

Kateb Yacine was in his third year of &quot;collège&quot; when the demonstrations of 8 May 1945 occurred. He participated in these demonstrations that ended with the massacre of between six and eight (according to nationalists forty-five) thousand Algerians by the French army and police in the Sétif and Guelma massacre. Three days later he was placed under arrest and imprisoned for two months. From that point on he became a partisan for the nationalist cause. Expelled from secondary school, watching his mother&#x27;s psychological health decline, passing through a period of dejection and being immersed in the writings of Lautréamont and Baudelaire, his father sent him to the high school in Bône (Annaba). There he met &#x27;Nedjma&#x27; (&#x27;the star&#x27;), an &#x27;already married cousin&#x27; with whom he lived for &#x27;maybe eight months&#x27;, as he later acknowledged.

While living with Nedjma he published his first collection of poetry in 1946. He had already become &#x27;politicized&#x27; and started giving lectures under the auspices of the Algerian People&#x27;s Party, &#x27;the great nationalist party of the masses&#x27;. Yacine went to Paris in 1947, &quot;into the lion&#x27;s den&quot; as he put it.

In May 1947, he joined the Algerian Communist Party and gave a lecture in the &#x27;Salle des Sociétés savantes&#x27; on emir Abd al-Qadir. During a second visit to France the following year he published &#x27;Nedjma ou le Poème du Couteau&#x27; (a hint of what was to follow) in the revue &#x27;Le Mercure de France&#x27;. He was a journalist at the daily &#x27;Alger Républicain&#x27; between 1949 and 1951.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1950, Yacine worked as a longshoreman in Algiers. He returned to Paris where he would stay until 1959. During this period in Paris he worked with Malek Haddad, developed a relationship with M&#x27;hamed Issiakhem, and in 1954, spoke extensively with Bertold Brecht. In 1954, the revue Esprit published Yacine&#x27;s play &#x27;Le cadavre encerclé&#x27;, which was staged by Jean-Marie Serreau but was banned in France.

&#x27;Nedjma&#x27; was published in 1956 (and Kateb would not forget the editor&#x27;s comment: &quot;This is too complicated. In Algeria you&#x27;ve got such pretty sheep, why don&#x27;t you talk about your sheep?&quot;). During the Algerian War of Independence, Yacine was forced to travel abroad for a long time due to the harassment he faced from the DST. He lived in numerous places, subsisting as a guest writer or working various odd jobs in France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Yugoslavia and the USSR.

After a stay in Cairo, Yacine returned again to Algeria in 1962, shortly after the independence celebrations. He resumed writing for &#x27;Alger Républicain&#x27; but traveled frequently between 1963 and 1967 to Moscow, France and Germany. &#x27;La Femme sauvage&#x27;, which he had written between 1954 and 1959, was performed in Paris in 1963. &#x27;Les Ancêtres redoublent de férocité&#x27; was staged in 1967. &#x27;La Poudre d&#x27;intelligence&#x27; was also staged in Paris in 1967 and an Algerian Arabic version in Algiers in 1969. In 1964 Yacine published six essays on &#x27;our brothers the Indians&#x27; in &#x27;Alger Républicain&#x27; and recounted his meeting with Jean-Paul Sartre while his mother was being committed to the psychiatric hospital in Blida (&#x27;La Rose de Blida&#x27;, in &#x27;Révolution Africaine&#x27;, July 1965). He left for Vietnam in 1967, completely abandoning the novel and wrote &#x27;L&#x27;Homme aux sandales de caoutchouc&#x27;, a play celebrating Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese struggle against imperialism, that was published, performed and translated into Arabic in 1970.

The same year Yacine returned to make a more permanent home in Algeria. During this period he had a significant change in philosophy: he refused to continue writing in French, and instead began working on popular theatre, epics and satires, performed in dialectal Arabic. Beginning this work with the theatre company &#x27;Théatre de la Mer&#x27; from Bab El Oued in 1971, sponsored by the Ministère du Travail et des Affaires Sociales, Kateb traveled all over Algeria for five years, putting on plays for an audience of workers, farmers and students.

Between 1972 and 1975 Kateb went with on tour performing the plays &#x27;Mohamed prends ta valise&#x27; and &#x27;La Guerre de deux mille ans&#x27; to France and to the German Democratic Republic. The Algerian government in Sidi-Bel-Abbes more or less sentenced him to direct the city&#x27;s regional theatre as a kind of exile. Having been forbidden to appear on television, Yacine staged his plays in schools or businesses. He was often criticized for his emphasis on Berber tradition and the &#x27;Tamazight&#x27; language, as well as for his liberal positions on issues of gender equality such as his position against women being required to wear a headscarf.

In 1986 Kateb Yacine circulated an excerpt of a play about Nelson Mandela, and in 1987 he received the Grand prix national des Lettres in France.

In 1988 the Avignon Festival staged &#x27;Le Bourgeois sans culotte ou le spectre du parc Monceau&#x27;, a play about Robespierre that Yacine wrote at the request of the Arras Cultural Center for the bicentennial commemoration of the French Revolution. Yacine settled in Verscheny in Drôme, traveled often to the United States and continued to make frequent trips to Algeria. At his death he left an unfinished work on the Algerian riots of October 1988. In 2003 his works were admitted to the Comédie-Française.

Taught in the language of the colonizer, Kateb Yacine considered the French language the Algerians&#x27; spoil of the war for independence. He declared in 1966 that &quot;La Francophonie is a neocolonial political machine, which only perpetuates our alienation, but the usage of the French language does not mean that one is an agent of a foreign power, and I write in French to tell the French that I am not French&quot;. Trilingual, Kateb Yacine also wrote and supervised the translation of his texts into the Berber language. His work manifests his multicultural country&#x27;s search for identity and the aspirations of its people.

Kateb Yacine is the father of three children, Hans, Nadia and Amazigh Kateb, singer for the band Gnawa Diffusion.

<text>Altham was an automobile manufactured from 1898 to 1899, in Fall River, Massachusetts, United States. It was designed by George J. Altham, and manufactured by Altham International Motor Car Company, which was based in Boston, Massachusetts, United States.

== History ==
In 1896, a designer George J. Altham from Fall River, Massachusetts, United States, after years of work, had made a petrol engine. In August 1897, he installed it in a vehicle for testing purposes. In 1898, Altham International Motor Car Company was established, with its headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. By October 1898, the working prototype was sufficiently developed, and the commercial production of the Altham car had begun. The manufacturing factory was located in Fall River, Massachusetts, United States. The production ended in 1899, with only a few vehicles being built overall.

== Specifications ==
The Altham car had an air-cooled two-cylinder petrol engine, with 6 horsepower (4.4 kW), and 1000 revolutions per minute. The vehicle had two seats.

<doc id="853298" wikidata="Q1501208" url="?curid=853298" title="Kips Bay, Manhattan">
<text>Kips Bay, or Kip&#x27;s Bay, is a neighborhood on the east side of the New York City borough of Manhattan. It is roughly bounded by 34th Street to the north, the East River to the east, 23rd Street to the south, and Third Avenue to the west.

Kips Bay is part of Manhattan Community District 6, and its primary ZIP Codes are 10010 and 10016. It is patrolled by the 13th and 17th Precincts of the New York City Police Department.

== Geography ==
According to &quot;The Encyclopedia of New York City&quot; and the New York City Department of City Planning, Kips Bay proper is generally bounded by East 34th Street to the north, the East River to the east, East 27th Street to the south, and Third Avenue to the west. City documents have also used New York City census tract 70 (from 29th to 34th streets, First to Third avenues) as an approximation for Kips Bay, and referred to tract 66, immediately below it, as &quot;Bellevue South&quot;.

The &quot;American Guide Series&quot; defines the combined Kip&#x27;s Bay–Turtle Bay area as running from 27th Street north to 59th Street, and from Third Avenue to the East River, excluding the neighborhoods of Beekman Place and Sutton Place.

For its entry on Kips Bay, the American Institute of Architects&#x27; &quot;AIA Guide to New York City&quot; uses the area from 23rd Street north to roughly 38th Street, and from the East River west to just past Second Avenue.

== History ==

===Colonial settlement===

Kips Bay was an inlet of the East River running from what is now 32nd Street to 37th Street. The bay extended into Manhattan Island to just west of what is now First Avenue and had two streams that drained into it. The bay was named after New Netherland Dutch settler Jacobus Hendrickson Kip (1631–1690), son of Hendrick Hendricksen Kip, whose farm ran north of present-day 30th Street along the East River. The bay became reclaimed land, yet &quot;Kips Bay&quot; remains the name of the area. Kip built a large brick and stone house, near the modern intersection of Second Avenue and East 35th Street. The house stood from 1655 to 1851, expanded more than once, and when it was demolished was the last farmhouse from New Amsterdam remaining in Manhattan. Iron figures fixed into the gable-end brickwork commemorated the year of its first construction. Its orchard was famous, and, when first President George Washington was presented with a specimen of its &quot;Rosa gallica&quot; during his first administration (1789–1793), when New York was serving as the first national capital city, it was claimed to have been the first garden to have grown it in the Thirteen Colonies.

Kips Bay was the site of the Landing at Kip&#x27;s Bay, an episode of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) and part of the New York and New Jersey campaign. About 4,000 British Army troops under General William Howe landed at Kips Bay on September 15, 1776, near what is now the foot of East 33rd Street off the East River from a Royal Navy fleet which had first landed earlier on Staten Island, then Long Island for the pivotal Battle of Brooklyn (also known as the Battle of Long Island) the previous month. Howe&#x27;s forces defeated about 500 American militiamen stationed at Kips Bay by Washington and commanded by Colonel William Douglas. The American forces immediately retreated, and the British occupied New York Town at the south point of the island soon afterward forcing General Washington to retreat northward to the Harlem River.

A single survivor of the late 18th or early 19th century in the neighborhood is the simple vernacular white clapboard house, much rebuilt, at 203 East 29th Street. The house, standing gable-end to the street, is one of a mere handful of wooden houses that remain on Manhattan Island. Its date of construction is unknown but has been variously dated from around 1790 to as late as 1870; currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the house is privately owned and not open to the public.

South of the Kips Bay Farm stood the substantial Federal-style villa erected facing the East River by Henry A. Coster, in the thirty-acre estate that was purchased in 1835 by Anson Greene Phelps; towards the city, the Bull&#x27;s Head cattle market fronting the Boston Post Road extended southwards from 27th Street to 23rd Street, affording a distinctly less rural aspect; the villa was removed to make way for row houses in the 1860s and the cattle market was moved farther out of town, to 42nd Street.

=== Later development ===
The neighborhood has been rebuilt in patches, featuring both new high-rise structures often set back from the street, and a multitude of exposed party walls that were never meant to be seen in public. A nearly forgotten feature is the private alley called Broadway Alley, between 26th and 27th streets, halfway between Lexington and Third avenues, reputedly the last unpaved street in Manhattan (by 2024, the alley has been paved with asphalt); it is not known what this alley is named after, since it is not near the main Broadway.

In 1940 the Madison Square Boys (and later Girls) Club, which previously had been located on East 30th Street just east of Second Avenue, built its own facilities on East 29th Street (back-to-back with its older facility). In the 1990s, the Club sold its building to the Churchill School and Center, and moved its office in the Empire State Building.

In the 1960s and 1970s, several high-rise apartment complexes were constructed between First and Second avenues as a result of urban renewal. Located between East 30th and 33rd streets, the NYU-Bellevue urban renewal project resulted in the development of Kips Bay Towers, a 1,112-unit apartment complex designed by architect I. M. Pei and completed in 1963. The Bellevue South urban renewal project, located between 23rd and 30th streets, resulted in multiple housing developments, including East Midtown Plaza and Phipps Plaza (named after 19th century industrialist and philanthropist Henry Phipps).

Waterside Plaza is a residential and business complex built on a pier above the East River between East 25th and 30th streets which is adjacent to another deck over the river constructed for the United Nations International School. There were plans to build River Walk, a development with additional above-water apartments, offices, and a hotel in the 1980s, but environmental concerns and community opposition doomed the project. Today, the waterfront south of Waterside Plaza is Stuyvesant Cove Park. The park includes a small man-made brownfield land mass extending out into the East River, which was created from excess concrete dumped into the river when the site was a ready-mix plant.

<doc id="853301" wikidata="Q529914" url="?curid=853301" title="Philip Francis Thomas">
<text>Philip Francis Thomas (September 12, 1810 – October 2, 1890) was an American lawyer, mathematician and politician. He served in the Maryland House of Delegates, was the 28th Governor of Maryland from 1848 to 1851, and was Comptroller of Maryland from 1851 to 1853. He was appointed as the 23rd United States Secretary of the Treasury in 1860 in the Buchanan administration. After unsuccessfully standing for the United States Senate in 1878, he returned to the Maryland House of Delegates, and later resumed the practice of law.

Thomas was also elected twice to the United States House of Representatives, once in 1838 and again in 1874. He holds the all-time record for the longest break in between two terms of service in Congress, with 34 years separating his only two terms.

== Governor of Maryland ==
Born in Easton, Maryland, he graduated from Dickinson College in Pennsylvania in 1830. He studied law and became a lawyer in Easton. Thomas was a delegate to the Maryland&#x27;s constitutional convention in 1836 and a member of the Maryland House of Delegates in 1838, 1843, and 1845. He was elected as a Democrat to the 26th Congress in 1838 from , but declined to run again in 1840. He went back to his law practice, but returned to politics eight years later when he was elected the 28th Governor of Maryland, a position he held through 1851. While Governor, in 1849 he commissioned Maryland&#x27;s contribution to the Washington Monument, a marble building stone upon which the colonial Sparrow Seal of Maryland was engraved.

From 1851 to 1853, he was Comptroller of Maryland and then collector of the port of Baltimore from 1853 to 1860, and United States Commissioner of Patents for a fragment of that year (February through December).

== Secretary of the Treasury ==
Thomas was appointed United States Secretary of the Treasury in the Presidential Cabinet of President James Buchanan and served from December 12, 1860 until his resignation on January 14, 1861. 

When Howell Cobb, the 22nd Secretary of the Treasury resigned in 1860, Buchanan appointed Thomas the 23rd Secretary. Thomas reluctantly accepted the position. Immediately upon entering office, Thomas had to market a bond to pay the interest on the public debt. There was little faith in the stability of the country due to the threat of secession by the Southern United States, and war appeared inevitable. Northern bankers refused to invest in Thomas&#x27;s loan, wary that the money would go to the South. Following Interior Secretary Jacob Thompson, Thomas resigned after only a month in response to his failure to obtain the loan. However, other sources point to Thomas&#x27;s &quot;disagreement with (then President) Buchanan&#x27;s emerging policy concerning South Carolina.&quot; His letter of resignation reprinted in the New York Times states that his reason for doing so was President Buchanan&#x27;s reply accepting the resignation in that same New York Tines edition of January 17, 1861—six days after the event—stated that Thomas in his brief tenure as Secretary of the Treasury had discharged &quot;duties in a manner highly satisfactory to myself.&quot;

== Later political career ==
Two years later, he again became a member of the Maryland House of Delegates in 1863. He presented credentials as a senator-elect to the United States Senate for the term beginning March 4, 1867, but was not seated as a person &quot;who had given aid and comfort&quot; to the Confederate cause by way of giving money to his son &quot;to aid him in joining the rebel army.&quot; The charge against him was contested in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;partisan intolerance,&quot; and in &quot;The Chicago Times&quot; as &quot;lawless despotism.&quot; However, Senator Jacob Howard of Michigan speaking to the Senate in mid-February 1868 had catalogued all of the ways in which Thomas had aided the insurrection: e.g., &quot;only three days before he (Secretary Thomas) resigned his place as Secretary of the Treasury, the sub-treasury at Charleston, South Carolina was robbed deliberately by the rebels, plundered, taken into possession by the government there while Thomas here at Washington stands by quietly, offers no rebuke, makes no effort to defend the public treasure.&quot; As his reason for resignation on January 11, 1861, Thomas cited &quot;the purpose of the Cabinet and President to enforce the collection of the customs in the port of Charleston.&quot;

He was then elected as a Democrat to the 44th Congress from the 1st Congressional district of Maryland, serving from 1875 to 1877, and declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1876.

He was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the United States Senate in 1878. He returned to the Maryland House of Delegates twice, in 1878 and 1883, and then resumed the practice of law in Easton.

== Death and burial ==

He died in Baltimore in 1890 and is buried in Spring Hill Cemetery in Easton.

<doc id="853303" wikidata="Q7986080" url="?curid=853303" title="West Nile virus in the United States">
<text>The West Nile virus quickly spread across the United States after the first reported cases in Queens, New York, in 1999. The virus is believed to have entered in an infected bird or mosquito, although there is no clear evidence. The disease spread quickly through infected birds. Mosquitoes spread the disease to mammals. It was mainly noted in horses but also appeared in a number of other species. The first human cases usually followed within three months of the first appearance of infected birds in the area except where cold weather interrupted the mosquito vectors. Since the virus has become widely established in the U.S., an average of 130 deaths a year have occurred.

Differences in surveillance and reporting between health departments and generally increased surveillance as the disease spread cause some problems in direct comparison of the number of cases and the mortality rate. The reported number of infected in 2009 was 720, but the estimated total number of infected the same year was . The true mortality rate is thought to be much lower because most cases are so mild they go undiagnosed. Some estimates put severe cases at only 1% of all cases. It is believed that the elderly or people with weak immune systems are most vulnerable to serious illness or death if bitten by a mosquito infected by West Nile. Most mild cases go undiagnosed. In addition, some more severe but non-neuroinvasive cases are not reported to the CDC. Some mild cases are discovered during blood donation screening. 1,039 West Nile-tainted blood donations were discovered between 2003 and mid-2005. 30 cases of West Nile from blood transfusion were known, the majority from 2002 before blood screening was instituted.

In the first ten years since the virus arrived in the U.S., over 1,100 deaths occurred with human cases reported from every U.S. state except Maine, Alaska and Hawaii. (Animal cases have been occasionally found in Maine and in Puerto Rico.) In 2012, there was a widespread outbreak with the highest death toll and second-highest total case numbers. Maine and Puerto Rico reported one case each, the first time the disease was reported in those places.

==Discovery in the United States==
In August 1999, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) began receiving reports of large die-offs of crows in parks across New York City. On August 9, dead wild crows were discovered outside both the Queens Zoo and the Bronx Zoo, prompting head pathologist Tracey McNamara to begin investigating what was going on. At the same time, Dr. Deborah Asnis, an infectious disease specialist at Flushing Hospital Medical Center in Queens, noticed two male patients who were suffering from similar, unusual symptoms. The two patients, aged 60 and 75 respectively, were exhibiting sudden paralysis in their arms and legs, as well as disorientation and high fevers. Lab testing also showed elevated numbers of white blood cells within the spinal fluid of both males. Neither of the patients were responding to antiviral drugs. Possible early hypotheses included botulism, viral encephalitis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, or meningitis, but none of these illnesses exactly matched the symptoms. Asnis decided to pursue a more concrete diagnosis by contacting authorities and other colleagues.

Dr. Asnis contacted Dr. Marcelle Layton, the New York City Department of Health&#x27;s chief epidemiologist, on Monday, August 23, 1999, to report her patients&#x27; symptoms. Layton advised Asnis to send samples of the patients&#x27; blood and spinal fluid to the New York State Department of Health in Albany for further analysis. Around the same time, Dr. McNamara identified a potential viral encephalitis in brain tissue from the dead crows and sent samples off for further testing. Meanwhile, by Friday, August 27, just four days after Asnis had contacted Layton, two additional patients had been identified in Queens. The number rose to eight by Sunday, August 29, at Flushing Hospital Medical Center and other hospitals in Queens. All of the early patients resided within a few miles of one another. They were also frequent gardeners in the evenings.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (C.D.C.) initially identified the mystery illness as St. Louis encephalitis on September 3, 1999. The city of New York began widespread spraying for mosquitos later that same day. However, laboratory testing continued to determine a definitive cause of the symptoms.

On September 9, Dr. McNamara contacted the C.D.C. with concerns that the epidemiologic pattern of this outbreak were not consistent with St. Louis encephalitis, which does not cause bird die-offs. Additionally, she reported that other known avian viral diseases would have resulted in the deaths of other bird species in the zoos (avian influenza and Newcastle disease would have killed chickens in the petting zoo and eastern equine encephalitis would have killed emus on exhibit). Since only corvids appeared to be dying, she suggested the possibility of a novel pathogen. The C.D.C. disagreed that the epidemiologic pattern was inconsistent and declined to test tissue samples from animal species. Instead, Dr. McNamara sent tissue samples to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory. On September 11, they reported that the samples she submitted were positive for a flavivirus, marking the first time a virus in this genus was implicated in an animal disease.

The U.S. federal government eventually revised its diagnosis from St. Louis encephalitis to West Nile virus on September 27, 1999, based on research by Dr. Duane J. Gubler, a C.D.C. expert on arborviruses, and their own testing on samples submitted by Dr. McNamara.

Both Dr. McNamara and Dr. Asnis have been credited by health experts with the early identification of West Nile virus in the United States. Their actions likely prevented a more widespread outbreak. In their 2003 book, &quot;The New Killer Diseases: How the Alarming Evolution of Germs Threatens Us All&quot;, authors Elinor Levy and Mark Fischetti praised Dr. Asnis&#x27; response to the symptoms, writing that, &quot;Asnis did something other doctors might not have bothered to do.&quot; They elaborated that, &quot;One of the worst problems with our disease-detection system is that many doctors never report cases of strange symptoms, either because they are unsure of the disease they are facing, they&#x27;re ignorant of the reporting requirement, or they simply never get around to it. Deborah Asnis was highly conscientious.&quot;

== Recent cases ==
During the years between 1999 and 2010, an estimate of 3 million people have been infected in the United States. Highest incidence rates are observed in states of the central great plains, with South Dakota, Wyoming and North Dakota leading in incidence.

During the 2012 West Nile virus outbreak in Texas, 1,868 cases were reported. Male patients, persons &gt;65 years of age, and minorities were at highest risk for neuroinvasive disease. At total of 1,868 cases including 844 (45%) WNND (West Nile neuroinvasive disease) cases and 89 deaths (case-fatality rate 5%). Dates of onset ranged from May 1, 2012, through December 6, 2012. The outbreak peaked during week 33 (mid-August) with 225 reported cases, which is historically the same peak for all reported WNV cases in Texas during 2002–2011. The median time from date of symptom onset to date of official report to TxDSHS was 27 days (range 6–274 days). Of the 254 counties in Texas, 135 (53%) reported a WNV case. The overall incidence rate for the state was 7.8 cases per 100,000 population. Almost half of the cases were reported from the northeastern quadrant of the state, including the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex (902 [48%] cases): Dallas (396 [21%]), Tarrant (259 [14%]), Collin (64 [3%]), and Denton (183 [10%]) counties. These 4 counties had a combined incidence rate of 16 cases per 100,000 population.

<text>Thaton (; ) is a town in Mon State, in southern Myanmar on the Tenasserim plains. Thaton lies along the National Highway 8 and is also connected by the National Road 85. It is southeast of Yangon and north of Mawlamyine. Thaton was the capital of Thaton Kingdom from at least the 4th century BC to the middle of the 11th century AD.

==Etymology==
Thaton is the Burmese name of Sathuim (သဓီု) in Mon, which in turn is from Sudhammapura () in Pali, after Sudharma, the moot hall of the gods. This name has Buddhist symbolism: according to the 4th-century &quot;Buddhavaṃsa&quot;, this was the name of the city where the Śobhita Buddha was born, as well as the name of his father, and &quot;Sudhammavati&quot; was also the name of the city where the Sujāta Buddha &quot;held his first assembly of monks&quot;. The name of Thaton probably originated as the formal Pali name &quot;Sudhamma&quot;, which then became vernacular Mon form &quot;Sadhuim&quot;, which is in turn pronounced &quot;Thaton&quot; in Burmese.

==Geography==
Thaton is located on a &quot;fanlike&quot; area at the foot of an elongated mountain spur, with the coast to the west. There is a significant slope within the city, from 43 m above sea level at the northeast corner to 9 m in the southwest. Just south of Thaton, the mountain range opens up and there is a valley 20 km long offering passage to Hpa-an and eventually over the Three Pagodas Pass to central Thailand. Besides the mountain range, there are also eight smaller hills that form a low arc around the city. Seven of these are located on the west and south, which conveniently provide protection against flooding on the side that is otherwise exposed to the sea. The eighth hill, Neimindara, is on the northeast. It is thought to have been a key strategic point in pre-cannon times, and &quot;the troops that held this hill controlled the city&quot;.

On the west side of Thaton is a fault line, which the railway follows. To the south are the Gawt and Waba streams.

Southern Myanmar has extensive deposits of laterite, a reddish-yellow soil which is rich in iron. At Thaton, this is found as a &quot;clay layer&quot; about 10 cm below the ground surface. Historically, laterite was widely used as a building material in southern Myanmar, and today, it is also mined extensively for iron in the area north of Thaton.

Silting has resulted in the coastline moving away from Thaton, which is now a sleepy town on the rail line from Bago to Mawlamyine (Moulmein).

===Climate===
==History==

Thaton was the capital of the Thaton Kingdom, a Mon Kingdom which ruled present day Lower Burma between the 4th and 11th centuries. Like the Burmans and the Thais, some modern Mons have tried to identify their ethnicity and, specifically this kingdom at Thaton, with the semi-historical kingdom of Suwarnabhumi (&quot;The Golden Land&quot;); today, this claim is contested by many different ethnicities in south-east Asia, and contradicted by scholars.

In the kingdom of Dvaravati, Thaton was an important seaport on the Gulf of Martaban, for trade with India and Sri Lanka. Shin Arahan, also called Dhammadassi, a monk born in Thaton and raised and educated in Nakhon Pathom, an old capital of the Mon kingdom of Dvaravadi, now in Thailand, took Theravada Buddhism north to the Burmese kingdom of Bagan. In 1057, King Anawrahta of Bagan conquered Thaton.

However, Michael Aung-Thwin, has disputed the entire traditional narrative of a &quot;Thaton Kingdom&quot; and its conquest by Anawrahta. No contemporary inscriptions refer to Thaton or its conquest by Anawrahta, and the full version of the conquest story does not appear in later chronicles until U Kala&#x27;s &quot;Mahayazawingyi&quot;, written in the early 1700s. Aung-Thwin also disputes the existence of Thaton itself during this time period, writing that &quot;it is not even certain that the area... was not under the ocean&quot; during the first millennium CE, since the shoreline likely would have been much farther inland at the time.

===Contemporary epigraphy===
The first undisputed mention of Thaton is in the 1479 Kalyani Inscriptions, which were written in the Middle Mon language and attributed to Dhammazedi. This inscription uses &quot;Sudhuim&quot;, which is the usual Mon form of the name.

Thaton is not mentioned before this, although other inscriptions from Bagan and Ava monarchs do mention places farther south. Then in 1486, the name Sudhammapura appears in three Mon inscriptions. There is one inscription purportedly dating to 1067 records the building of a temple by a king Manuho of Thaton, but based on linguistic analysis (for example, the spelling of certain words is more characteristic of later times than of Pagan times), Aung-Thwin says the inscription is likely from a later period. (Even among scholars who are proponents of the idea that Thaton was a major capital at this time period, the 1067 inscription is also rejected for the same reasons, and they say it could be no earlier than the 1500s.)

The earliest dated inscriptions found near Thaton (but not mentioning it) are the Kyaik Talan and Kyaik Te inscriptions, which were made in 1098 under Kyanzittha. The two inscriptions were found at the Kyaik Talan and Kyaik Te stupas in Ayetthema, on the northwest side of Kelasa Mountain. The inscriptions record the renovation of the stupas under Kyanzittha.

===Archaeology===
An urban site at Thaton was excavated between 1975 and 1977 under U Myint Aung. The site is small, with an area of about 1,500 square yards and &quot;at most three major stupas&quot;. A large structure that may have been a palace has partially been excavated, at the center of the site. Part of the city walls also remain. 

The walled area of Thaton is mostly rectangular in shape, roughly measuring 2010 m from north to south and 1290 m from east to west. The walls aren&#x27;t perfectly rectangular, though — the northeast and southeast corners each have a few rounded segments that serve to &quot;draw water off from streams flowing down from peaks on the escarpment&quot;. The overall layout resembles the 1st-millennium site of Halin, which also had a rectangular shape.

The lower layers of Thaton&#x27;s city walls contain numerous fingermarked bricks, which according to Elizabeth Moore are characteristic of first-millennium architectural remains over a wide area including not just Myanmar but also parts of India and Thailand. As a result, Moore and San Win date the walls of Thaton to the first millennium as well.

Remains of city gates have been found on the north and south walls, but none have been found on the east or west walls.

Three carved reliefs of Hindu deities found at Thaton in the 19th century have been variously stylistically dated to the 9th/10th or 11th centuries. One depicts Shiva and Parvati. The other two are reddish sandstone reliefs, each over a meter tall, depicting the god Vishnu reclining on the serpent Ananta Shesha. Three lotus stems are depicted as coming out of Vishnu&#x27;s navel, and smaller figures of Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva are depicted sitting on them. (Normally, there would only be one lotus and deity coming out of Vishnu&#x27;s navel.) The exact find spots for these three reliefs was not recorded, so their function is unknown. They were likely intended for local faithful, indicating an &quot;eclectic religious milieu&quot; at first-millennium Thaton. All three were destroyed during the Second World War when they were kept in the University of Yangon&#x27;s library.

Another relief found at Thaton is a 1.2 m-tall depiction of Shiva sitting down, with his bull Nandi shown below his right leg and a &quot;buffalo demon&quot; below his left knee.

There is also a set of &quot;sema&quot;, or boundary stones, at the Kalyani Thein ordination hall near the Shweyazan stupa. The Kalyani &quot;sema&quot; are each over a meter tall and carved with panels depicting of the life of Gautama Buddha and floral designs at the top. Their date is highly uncertain — stylistically similar &quot;sema&quot; found in Thailand are associated with the Dvaravati culture and dated to the 6th through 9th centuries, but the Kalyani &quot;sema&quot; also have their own distinct forms that have been tentatively associated with Mon migrations from Haripuñjaya in the 12th and 13th centuries.

Myint Aung&#x27;s excavation in the 1970s did not produce any radiocarbon dating, so the exact date of the site is uncertain. According to Moore and San Win, repeated renovations and additions to pilgrimage sites has made detecting first-millennium remains &quot;extremely difficult&quot;. However, as mentioned above, they identify the fingermarked bricks as evidence of first-millennium occupation at Thaton.

===Historiography of the conquest story===
The origins of the conquest story by Anawrahta in 1057 are unclear and &quot;apparently does not go back to any single source&quot;. According to Michael Aung-Thwin, the story may have originated from Bagan&#x27;s conquest of Lower Burma during this period. Anawrahta&#x27;s southward expansion is well-documented in contemporary inscriptions, with about 28 votive tablets recording his activity as far south as Mergui. But no Bagan-era inscription mentions a conquest of Thaton, which would be unusual because it would have been directly on the route to Mergui.

====In the &quot;Zambu Kungya&quot;====
The earliest text to mention something like the conquest of Thaton is the &quot;Zambu Kungya&quot;, written by Wun Zin Min Yaza, who served as a minister under the Ava-period kings Mingyi Swasawke and Mingaung I in the late 1300s and early 1400s. The only surviving part of this is an 1825 copy, although some of its content was also incorporated into the &quot;Maniyadanabon&quot;, which was written in the late 1700s.
This version (the one incorporated into the &quot;Maniyadanabon&quot;) says nothing about a conquest of Thaton; it only says that in 1054 &quot;the king, ministers, officers, people, and monks of Thaton carried the three Pitakas of the scriptures&quot; to Bagan. Although the version in the &quot;Maniyadanabon&quot; was only written in 1781, Aung-Thwin writes that it &quot;is very likely a good preservation&quot; of the &quot;Zambu&quot;.

====In the Kalyani Inscriptions====
The Kalyani Inscriptions of 1479, which are relatively close in date to the &quot;Zambu Kungya&quot;, are often cited to illustrate the conquest of Thaton, However, Aung-Thwin writes that the Kalyani Inscriptions contain no direct reference to this event. Instead, they refer to two completely separate things: in one part, the Pali version of the inscription says simply that Anawrahta &quot;took a community of monks together with the &quot;Tipiṭaka&quot; and established the religion in Arimaddanapura, otherwise called Pugāma&quot;, without saying where the monks or texts came from; in another part, the inscriptions refer to the decline of Thaton during the reign of a king Manohor, without mentioning any sort of conquest. These two parts were then conflated, according to Aung-Thwin, into a single narrative of conquest in 18th-century chronicles and then repeated by 19th-century colonial scholars.

Aung-Thwin interprets the Kalyani Inscriptions as a way of legitimizing Dhammazedi&#x27;s religious reform to more closely follow what he saw as a more &quot;orthodox&quot; form of Theravada Buddhism of the Mahavihara tradition. Thus, the story of Thaton&#x27;s decline under Manohor was meant to &quot;illustrate what happened when Buddhist kings allowed the religion to decay&quot;. It also &quot;invented the tradition of an &#x27;earlier&#x27; Thaton&quot; that had practiced an earlier, more &quot;pure&quot; version of Buddhism before being corrupted, so that his own religious reforms could appeal to an even older tradition and overcome opposition from &quot;conservative forces in Lower Burma&quot; who were following an allegedly corrupted strain of Buddhism.

====In the &quot;Jinakālamālī&quot;====
The &quot;Jinakālamālī&quot;, written in Pali in the early 1500s by an author from Chiang Mai, is the first work to mention Anawrahta&#x27;s conquest of Manohara&#x27;s kingdom. It appears to treat the story as &quot;an illustration of Buddhist principles&quot;: a weak ruler like Manohara, who fails to properly uphold Buddhist ideals, would inevitably be defeated by a strong ruler who does.

====In the &quot;Mahayazawingyi&quot;====
The &quot;first chronicle of Burma with the most comprehensive and complete version&quot; of the conquest story is U Kala&#x27;s &quot;Mahayazawingyi&quot;, written sometime between 1712 and 1720. It is not clear where U Kala got this story from — none of the sources he is said to have used mention the conquest of Thaton. He may have been using older sources that are now lost, or he may have synthesized or embellished it based on the sources he was using. In any case, U Kala&#x27;s version proved influential: it was used as a source for both the &quot;Yazawin Thit&quot; and especially the &quot;Hmannan Maha Yazawindawgyi&quot;, which &quot;depended heavily on his work&quot;.

====In the &quot;Yazawin Thit&quot;====
The &quot;Yazawin Thit&quot;, written by Twinthin Taikwun Maha Sithu in the late 1700s, introduces a couple of details not found in previous or contemporary sources. First, Twinthin — a well-educated scholar who was already familiar with Old Burmese inscriptions — was the first scholar to specifically cite the Kalyani Inscriptions as a source for the conquest of Thaton (probably because he interpreted it as confirming what was by his time &quot;common knowledge&quot;). Second, he was the first one to write that Shin Arahan was born at Thaton, which was repeated in the &quot;Hmannan&quot;.

== Sites of interest ==
Thaton&#x27;s primary Buddhist pagoda is Shwesayan Pagoda, which is near the town&#x27;s main Myoma Market. Myathabeik Pagoda is perched on a hilltop east of the town. Thaton is home to the U Pho Thi Library, which houses an extensive collection of palm-leaf manuscripts, at the Saddhammajotikārāma Monastery.

<text>Alan Davis (born 18 June 1956) is an English artist and writer of comic books, known for his work on titles such as &quot;Captain Britain&quot;, &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;, &quot;ClanDestine&quot;, &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, &quot;Excalibur&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

==Career==

===UK work===

Davis began his career in comics on an English fanzine. His first professional work was a strip called &quot;The Crusader&quot; in &quot;Frantic Magazine&quot; for Dez Skinn&#x27;s revamped Marvel UK line.

Davis&#x27;s big break was drawing the revamped Captain Britain story in &quot;Marvel Superheroes&quot;. At the time, he was working full-time in a warehouse in Corby doing work that included loading trucks. He initially had no interest in pursuing a career in comics, as he considered drawing to be a hobby. Due to his inexperience, Davis did not leave enough room for word balloons in the five-page first installment, so it had to be recut to six pages. Afterwards, Alan Moore took over writing duties on &quot;Captain Britain&quot;. Davis drew 14 issues of the monthly &quot;Captain Britain&quot; title, which was later reprinted in trade paperback. Davis and Moore formed a close working partnership as creators; they also created D.R. and Quinch for &quot;2000AD&quot;. Later, Davis replaced Garry Leach on &quot;Marvelman&quot; in &quot;Warrior&quot; and yet again worked with Moore. He also drew the story &quot;Harry Twenty on the High Rock&quot; in &quot;2000AD&quot;.

Davis created the illustrations used by the Post Office in their 2019 Marvel commemorative stamp set. The set included ten stamps featuring individual superheroes as well as a miniature sheet.

===American work===
In 1985 Davis received his big break in the United States when he was hired by DC Comics to draw &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot;, written by Mike W. Barr. Davis took over from Jim Aparo, who launched the direct market version of the title. His work proved popular enough for him to be assigned artistic duties on DC&#x27;s flagship title &quot;Detective Comics&quot; in 1986, again with Barr writing. During the &quot;&quot; storyline, however, Davis encountered difficulties with his editor and left after the first issue of the four-issue storyline. The remaining three issues were illustrated by Todd McFarlane. In the story, which featured Joe Chill, the murderer of Batman&#x27;s parents, Barr wanted Chill to have a large gun. He asked Davis to draw him with a Mauser with an extended barrel, similar to the one used by the Paul Kirk version of Manhunter. However, after Davis rendered Chill with this firearm throughout &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #575 and on its cover, he obtained copies of the pages for &quot;Batman&quot; #404 by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli, which was scheduled to be released months before the &quot;Year Two&quot; storyline, and saw that Chill was depicted using a smaller handgun without the extended barrel. When asked by editorial to redraw the gun in his artwork, Davis refused. Dick Giordano redrew the gun in the artwork.

Davis accepted an offer by &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; writer Chris Claremont to work on Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;X-Men&quot; books. With Claremont, Davis drew two &quot;New Mutants Annuals&quot; and three issues for &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;. In 1987 the duo launched the monthly series &quot;Excalibur&quot;, which featured a team consisting of Captain Britain and Meggan together with former X-Men members Kitty Pryde, Nightcrawler and Rachel Summers. The stories, set in England, saw appearances by many characters from Moore&#x27;s and Davis&#x27; &quot;Captain Britain&quot; stories of the early 1980s, including the Crazy Gang and the Technet. Davis&#x27; pencils were inked by Paul Neary and, later, Mark Farmer. Davis left with issue 24 due to deadline pressures, but returned with issue 42, this time also as writer. During this second run, according to Davis, &quot;[Editor] Terry Kavanagh spoiled me, gave me near total freedom, and encouraged me to experiment.&quot; Among the new characters he created for his second run on the title were Feron, Cerise, Micromax and Kylun.
In 1994 Davis created a new series of original characters called the ClanDestine, which featured the Destines, a family of long-lived, magically powered British superhumans. Davis wrote and penciled the title for the first eight issues. He departed after issue 8, and the series was canceled with issue 12. In 1996 Davis wrote and drew the two issue crossover miniseries &quot;X-Men and The ClanDestine&quot;.

In 1991, Davis reunited with writer Barr to draw the sequel to &quot;Year Two&quot;, the one-shot &quot;&quot;. During much of the 1990s Davis drew many of Marvel and DC Comics major characters and titles, including &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot;. He was also commissioned to write both main X-Men series in 1999 (providing art for &quot;X-Men&quot; as well), but he left the following year.

Starting in October 2002 he wrote and drew for Marvel &quot;Killraven&quot;, a six-issues miniseries revamping the title character of the 1970s. After a return to &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, working again with Claremont, Davis wrote and drew in 2006–2007 a six-issue &quot;Fantastic Four: The End&quot; limited series for Marvel (not to be confused with a similar one-shot written by Stan Lee and drawn by John Romita Jr). In February 2008, Davis wrote and pencilled a five-part &quot;ClanDestine&quot; miniseries and the one-shot &quot;Thor: Truth of History&quot; for Marvel. Davis most recent work has been in &quot;Totally Awesome Hulk&quot; (#7–8, 2016), the Thanos Trilogy (2018–2019) and a reunion with Roy Thomas in 2019 for two issues of &quot;The Savage Sword of Conan&quot; (#10–11, volume 2).

==Personal life==
Davis and his wife Heather have a son, Thomas, and a daughter, Pauline. Thomas had recently been born when Davis began his work on the &quot;Captain Britain&quot; stories in 1981, and Pauline was born a few years later.

<doc id="853308" wikidata="Q1584975" url="?curid=853308" title="Michael Manning (fetish artist)">
<text>Michael Manning (born 1963) is an American comic book artist and writer, fine art illustrator, and traditionally trained animator currently based in Los Angeles, California. He is best known for his graphic novel series, &quot;The Spider Garden&quot; and &quot;Tranceptor&quot;, which combine elements of pan-sexual fetishism and BDSM culture with complex characters in science fiction and fantasy settings. He is also active in the supernatural horror and fantasy genres, drawing adaptations of the work of authors such as H.P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allan Poe, and Alexandre Dumas for the Graphic Classics comics anthology series, as well as illustrating an anachronistic version of the German folk epic, The Nibelungen.

==Biography==

===Early career===

Manning was born in Flushing in the New York City borough of Queens and raised in Beverly, Massachusetts where he exhibited an early interest in drawing and writing. Exposure to Japanese animation, fairy-tale book illustration, American and European comics, and the mythology of many cultures all contributed to the formation of his emerging style.

=== 1980s ===
Manning went on to study film and animation at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. He began self-publishing art and comics in 1987 while working at Olive Jar Animation in Brookline, MA as an animator and director of short films, commercials, and music videos. Self-published titles such as &quot;Shunga&quot;, &quot;Ukiyo-X&quot; and &quot;Z/Xero&quot; brought his work to the attention of comic book artists John Bergin and James O&#x27;Barr (creator of The Crow) who in turn showed his work to Kevin Eastman of Tundra Publishing. This led to the inclusion of two of Manning&#x27;s short pieces (one of which was a collaboration with &quot;Red Spider White Web&quot; author Misha Nogha) in Tundra&#x27;s &quot;Bone Saw&quot; anthology - Manning&#x27;s first professional comics publication.

=== 1990s ===
A move to San Francisco in 1991 coincided with Manning&#x27;s decision to focus on comic books and erotic illustration full-time. Manning continued to self-publish and produce work for the Bay Area&#x27;s emerging BDSM/sex-zine community while his artwork and stage/costume design for multi-media performances appeared regularly at local music venues, fetish events, and art galleries. Much of his graphic work from this period was subsequently collected and published in the art collection &quot;Lumenagerie&quot; (1996) and the anthology &quot;Cathexis&quot; (1997). He also wrote and drew four volumes of the Spider Garden series and in collaboration with artist Patrick Conlon the first installment of the &quot;Tranceptor&quot; series.

=== 2000s ===
A second collection, &quot;Inamorata: The Erotic Art of Michael Manning&quot; with an introduction by Patrick Califia-Rice, was published by Last Gasp in 2005 just after Manning moved to Los Angeles. The second volume in the &quot;Tranceptor&quot; series, &quot;Iron Gauge&quot;, was published in 2007.

Manning&#x27;s artwork has been exhibited in galleries in San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Boston, Omaha, Miami, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Milan. In 2002, mural-sized reproductions of panels from his &quot;In A Metal Web&quot; graphic novel were featured as part of a special installation at San Francisco&#x27;s Yerba Buena Center for the Arts comic book-themed exhibition &quot;Fantastic! Comics and the Art of Illusion&quot;.

Manning&#x27;s work appears to illustrate &quot;Tales of Gor&quot;, a role-playing game based on the works of John Norman, written by James Desborough.

==The Spider Garden Series==

The Spider Garden graphic novel series, written and drawn by Manning, currently consists of four volumes in the following order: &quot;The Spider Garden&quot; (1995), &quot;Hydrophidian&quot; (1996), &quot;In A Metal Web&quot; (2004), and &quot;In A Metal Web II&quot; (2004).

===Publication History===
The first volume of the Spider Garden series was originally produced under contract for Kevin Eastman&#x27;s Tundra Publishing line. After Manning was released from his contract with Tundra in 1994, The Spider Garden became the inaugural book in NBM Publishing&#x27;s Amerotica line with the three subsequent volumes in the series also appearing under the NBM/Amerotica imprint. An Italian language edition of the first volume was published by Phoenix Erotica in 1999, followed by French and Italian language editions from BD Érogéne in 2000.

===Plot===
Set in a futuristic, matriarchal world of warring clans which vaguely recalls feudal-era Japanese culture, the action centers on the eponymous Spider Garden, a palace-fortress populated by concubines, human pets, and the spider-like automata who give the Garden its name. The Garden&#x27;s ruler is Shaalis the Sacred Androgyne, a seemingly immortal hermaphrodite who is referred to by the pronouns &#x27;Hir&#x27; and &#x27;S/He&#x27; (pronounced as &quot;her&quot; and &quot;she&quot; respectively) to denote Hir multi-gendered status.

The main plot follows the socio-political intrigues between Shaalis&#x27; Metal Spider Clan and the Serpentine Sisters, Squamata and Lichurna - incestuous twins who command the rival Water Serpent Clan which is based in an aquatic palace, Hydrophidian. Caught in the middle are former lovers Sasaya Nijan, a female courtesan who enters service in the Spider Garden in order to settle a gambling debt, and Lord Verio, head of the Double Ibis Clan who, following a failed assassination attempt on the Sacred Androgyne, finds himself deposed and forced into an alliance with the Serpentine Sisters.

Also appearing in the story are the Tengu, a non-human race of horse-like bipeds. Inspired by but not identical to the tengu of Japanese legend, it is implied that these creatures once held humanity in bondage in the distant past.

<text>Experimental theatre (also known as avant-garde theatre), inspired largely by Wagner&#x27;s concept of Gesamtkunstwerk, began in Western theatre in the late 19th century with Alfred Jarry and his Ubu plays as a rejection of both the age in particular and, in general, the dominant ways of writing and producing plays. The term has shifted over time as the mainstream theatre world has adopted many forms that were once considered radical.

Like other forms of the avant-garde, it was created as a response to a perceived general cultural crisis. Despite different political and formal approaches, all avant-garde theatre opposes bourgeois theatre. It tries to introduce a different use of language and the body to change the mode of perception and to create a new, more active relation with the audience.

==Relationships to audience==
Famed experimental theatre director and playwright Peter Brook describes his task as building &quot;… a necessary theatre, one in which there is only a practical difference between actor and audience, not a fundamental one.&quot;

Traditionally audiences are seen as passive observers. Many practitioners of experimental theatre have wanted to challenge this. For example, Bertolt Brecht wanted to mobilise his audiences by having a character in a play break through the invisible &quot;fourth wall&quot;, directly ask the audience questions, not giving them answers, thereby getting them to think for themselves; Augusto Boal wanted his audiences to react directly to the action; and Antonin Artaud wanted to affect them directly on a subconscious level. Peter Brook has identified a triangle of relationships within a performance: the performers&#x27; internal relationships, the performers&#x27; relationships to each other on stage, and their relationship with the audience. The British experimental theatre group Welfare State International has spoken of a ceremonial circle during performance, the cast providing one half, the audience providing another, and the energy in the middle.

Aside from ideological implications of the role of the audience, theatres and performances have addressed or involved the audience in a variety of ways. The proscenium arch has been called into question, with performances venturing into non-theatrical spaces. Audiences have been engaged differently, often as active participants in the action on a highly practical level. When a proscenium arch has been used, its usual use has often been subverted.

Audience participation can range from asking for volunteers to go onstage to having actors scream in audience members&#x27; faces. By using audience participation, the performer invites the audience to feel a certain way and by doing so they may change their attitudes, values and beliefs in regard to the performance&#x27;s topic. For example, in a performance on bullying the character may approach an audience member, size them up and challenge them to a fight on the spot. The terrified look on the audience member&#x27;s face will strongly embody the message of bullying to the member and the rest of the audience.

Physically, theatre spaces took on different shapes, and practitioners re-explored different ways of staging performance and a lot of research was done into Elizabethan and Greek theatre spaces. This was integrated into the mainstream, the National Theatre in London, for example, has a highly flexible, somewhat Elizabethan traverse space (the Dorfman), a proscenium space (the Lyttelton) and an amphitheatre space (the Olivier) and the directors and architects consciously wanted to break away from the primacy of the proscenium arch. Jacques Copeau was an important figure in terms of stage design, and was very keen to break away from the excesses of naturalism to get to a more pared down, representational way of looking at the stage.

==Social contexts==
The increase of the production of experimental theaters during the 1950s through the 1960s has prompted some to cite the connection between theater groups and the socio-political contexts in which they operated. Some groups have been prominent in changing the social face of theatre, rather than its stylistic appearance. Performers have used their skills to engage in a form of cultural activism. This may be in the form of didactic agit-prop theatre, or some (such as Welfare State International) see a performance environment as being one in which a micro-society can emerge and can lead a way of life alternative to that of the broader society in which they are placed. For instance, in a study of South American theatrical developments during the 1960s, the Nuevo Teatro Popular materialized amid the change and innovations entailed in the social and political developments of the period. This theatrical initiative was organized around groups or collective driven by specific events and performed themes tied to class and cultural identity that empowered their audience and help create movements that spanned national and cultural borders. These included Utopian projects, which sought to reconstruct social and cultural production, including their objectives.

Augusto Boal used the Legislative Theatre on the people of Rio to find out what they wanted to change about their community, and he used the audience reaction to change legislation in his role as a councillor. In the United States, the tumultuous 1960s saw experimental theater emerging as a reaction to the state&#x27;s policies on issues like nuclear armament, racial social injustice, homophobia, sexism and military–industrial complex. The mainstream theater was increasingly seen from as a purveyor of lies, hence, theatrical performances were often seen as a means to expose what is real and this entails a focus on hypocrisy, inequality, discrimination, and repression. This is demonstrated in the case of Grotowski, who rejected the lies and contradictions of mainstream theater and pushed for what he called as truthful acting in the performances of his Poor Theater as well as his lectures and workshops.

Experimental theatre encourages directors to make society, or our audience at least, change their attitudes, values, and beliefs on an issue and to do something about it. The distinction was explained in the conceptualization of experimentation that &quot;goes much deeper and much beyond than merely a new form/or novel content&quot; but &quot;a light that illuminates one&#x27;s work from within. And this light in the spirit of quest – not only aesthetic quest – it is an amalgam of so many quests – intellectual, aesthetic, but most of all, spiritual quest.&quot;

==Methods of creation==
Traditionally, there is a highly hierarchical method of creating theatre - a writer identifies a problem, a writer writes a script, a director interprets it for the stage together with the actors, the performers perform the director and writer&#x27;s collective vision. Various practitioners started challenging this and started seeing the performers more and more as creative artists in their own right. This started with giving them more and more interpretive freedom and devised theatre eventually emerged. This direction was aided by the advent of ensemble improvisational theater, as part of the experimental theatre movement, which did not need a writer to develop the material for a show or &quot;theater piece&quot;. In this form the lines were devised by the actors or performers.

Within this many different structures and possibilities exist for performance makers, and a large variety of different models are used by performers today. The primacy of the director and writer has been challenged directly, and the directors role can exist as an outside eye or a facilitator rather than the supreme authority figure they once would have been able to assume.

As well as hierarchies being challenged, performers have been challenging their individual roles. An inter-disciplinary approach becomes more and more common as performers have become less willing to be shoe-horned into specialist technical roles. Simultaneous to this, other disciplines have started breaking down their barriers. Dance, music, video art, visual art, new media art and writing become blurred in many cases, and artists with completely separate trainings and backgrounds collaborate very comfortably.

== Interculturalism and Orientalism in Experimental Theatre ==
In their efforts to challenge the realism of western drama, many modernists looked to other cultures for inspiration. Indeed, Artaud has often credited the Balinese dance traditions as a strong influence on his experimental theories: his call for a departure from language in the theatre, he says, partially came to him as a concept after having seen the Balinese Theatre&#x27;s performance at the Colonial Exhibition in Paris in 1931. He was particularly interested in the symbolic gestures performed by the dancers and their intimate connection to the music; in his &quot;Notes on Oriental, Greek and Indian Cultures,&quot; we find a curiosity as to what the French theatre scene could become if it pulled from traditions such as Noh and Balinese dance.

Similarly, it is in his essay on Chinese acting that Brecht used the term Verfremdungseffekt for the first time. Brecht&#x27;s essay, written shortly after having witnessed performer Mei Langfang&#x27;s demonstration of a few Peking Opera performance practices in 1935 Moscow, elaborates on his experience on his experience feeling &quot;alienated&quot; by Mei&#x27;s performance: Brecht notably mentions the absence of a fourth wall in the demonstration, which later on became a staple in Brechtian theatre, and the &quot;stylistic&quot; nature of the performance; another key concept which would find its way into Brecht&#x27;s later theories. In fact, three of Brecht&#x27;s plays are set in China (&quot;The Measures Taken&quot;, &quot;The Good Person of Szechwan&quot;, and &quot;Turandot&quot;)

Yeats, pioneer of the modernist and symbolist movement, discovered Noh drama in 1916, as detailed in his essay &quot;Certain Noble Plays of Japan&quot;, which reveals a strong interest in the musicality and stillness of the Noh performance. His production of the same year, &quot;At the Hawk&#x27;s Well&quot; was created by loosely following the rules of a Noh Play: Yeats&#x27; attempt at exploring Noh&#x27;s spiritual power, its lyrical tone and its synthesis of dance, music and verse.

Additionally, Gordon Craig repeatedly theorized about &quot;the idea of danger in the Indian theatre&quot;, as a potential solution to the lack of risk-taking in the western theatre, and some might argue his theories about an über-marionette actor could be compared to the kathakali training. In 1956, Grotowski too found himself an interest for Eastern performance practices, and experimented with using some aspects of Kathakali in his actor training program. He had studied the South-Indian tradition in Kerala, at the Kalamandalam.

In many cases, these practitioners&#x27; pulling of theatrical conventions from the East came from their desire to explore unexpected or novel approaches to theatre-making. Audiences at the time were not often exposed to Eastern theatre practices, and the latter were hence a powerful tool for modernists: Brecht could easily generate the alienation of his western audiences by presenting them with these supposedly &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;foreign&quot; theatrical conventions they were simply not familiar with. Artaud and Yeats could experiment with the musicality and ritualistic nature of Eastern dance traditions as a means to reconnect the western theatre to the mystical and to the universe; and both Grotowski and Craig could draw from the kathakali performers&#x27; training as a means to challenge the western theatre&#x27;s sole focus on psychological truth and truthful behavior.

However, their exposure to these theatre traditions was extremely limited: these theatre-makers&#x27;s understandings of the Eastern traditions they were pulling from were often limited to a few readings, translations of Chinese and Japanese works, and, in the case of Brecht and Artaud, the witnessing of an out-of-context demonstration of Balinese Theatre Dance and Peking Opera conventions. Remaining geographically distant, for the most part, of the traditions they wrote about, the &quot;oriental theatre&quot; could hence be argued to be more of a construct than a true practice for these theatre-makers. While they do pull from Eastern traditions, Brecht, Artaud, Yeats, Craig and Artaud&#x27;s respective articulations of their vision for theatre predate their exposure to these practices: their approach to Eastern theatre traditions were filtered &quot;through a personal agenda&quot;, and the absence of earnest curiosity for the oriental theatre could be argued to have led to its misinterpretation and distortion in the modernist movement.

Furthermore, Eastern theatre was repeatedly reduced by these western practitioners to an exotic, mystical form. It is important here to acknowledge the importance of cultural context in theatre-making: these practitioners&#x27; isolating of a particular ritual or convention from its broader cultural significance and social context shows perhaps that this &quot;questionable exoticization&quot; was customarily used to push their own preconceived notions about the theatre, rather than to explore the culture they were borrowing from.

<text>The Ferny Grove railway line is a suburban railway line in Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, Australia. It is part of the Queensland Rail Citytrain network. 
==History==

Based on initial surveys, in 1885 the Queensland Government planned to construct a railway line to Samford with the intention of extending it to Gympie. However, no immediate action was taken and further surveys resulted in the decision to construct the line to Gympie via the Mayne railway station (Bowen Hills) which created the North Coast railway line.

The relocation of Brisbane&#x27;s cattle sales yard from Normanby to Newmarket created a need to provide a railway to Newmarket. With financial guarantees provided by the Windsor Shire Council and the Enoggera Divisional Board, the Queensland Railways built a branch line from Mayne railway station (Bowen Hills) to Newmarket railway station to service the cattle yards and beyond to Enoggera railway station for suburban passenger services. This line opened on 5 February 1899. The suburban service to Enoggera was not very profitable and the Queensland Government resisted any efforts to extend the Brisbane tramway services to Enoggera to avoid further competition.

With the financial assistance of the Australian Defence Department, the line was extended to Rifle Range railway station (now called Gaythorne railway station) on 16 February 1916. The line was extended to Mitchelton railway station on 2 March 1918. The line was extended to Samford railway station on 1 July 1918, to Samsonvale railway station (3 March 1919), to Kobble railway station (3 November 1919) and finally to Dayboro railway station on 25 September 1920. The additional traffic on the line led to its duplication to Newmarket in 1921. The sales yards were moved to Cannon Hill in 1931.

On 5 May 1947, a packed excursion train derailed at Camp Mountain, after Ferny Grove railway station, in what is Queensland&#x27;s worst rail tragedy, the Camp Mountain train disaster.

The line was duplicated to Mitchelton in 1953, and the first automatic level crossing boom gates in Queensland were installed at Wilston Road, Newmarket in 1954.

The line was closed beyond Ferny Grove after 30 June 1955 after the freight traffic was lost to road transport. Ferny Grove was initially known as Ferny Flats, but the railway department changed the name of the railway station because of a Ferny Flats in New South Wales; the surrounding area followed suit.

==2008–2012 upgrades==
Between 2008 and 2012 the remaining single track section between Mitchelton and Ferny Grove was duplicated, including an upgraded Ferny Grove station, an additional 1000 car parking spaces and construction of a new bus interchange.

==Line guide, frequency and services==

Typical service frequency on the Ferny Grove Line is four trains per hour (every 15 minutes) on weekdays and two trains per hour (every 30 minutes) at night and on weekends, increasing to 8 trains per hour (every 7.5 minutes) during weekday peak times for faster travel times for commuters working in the Brisbane central business district. Most services stop at all stations to Roma Street railway station. The typical travel time between Ferny Grove and Brisbane City is approximately 31 minutes (to Central).

Ferny Grove line services typically continue as Beenleigh line services.

Passengers for and from the Airport, Caboolture, Doomben, Nambour and Gympie North, Redcliffe Peninsula and Shorncliffe lines change at Bowen Hills, and all other lines at Roma Street.

<text>readelf is a program for displaying various information about object files on Unix-like systems, similar to objdump. It is part of the GNU binutils.

== readelf and objdump ==
Both programs are capable of displaying the contents of ELF format files. objdump sees an ELF file through a BFD filter. If BFD has a bug where it disagrees about a machine constant in e_flags, then the odds are good that it will remain internally consistent. The linker sees it the BFD way, objdump sees it the BFD way, GAS sees it the BFD way. There was need for a tool to go find out what the file actually says.

This is why the readelf program does not link against the BFD library - it exists as an independent program to help verify the correct working of BFD.

There is also the case that readelf can provide more information about an ELF file than is provided by objdump. In particular it can display DWARF debugging information which (at the moment) objdump cannot.

== Example ==
The following command displays the contents of the file&#x27;s dynamic section (to examine the shared library dependencies and rpath):
$ readelf -d &lt;file name&gt;

<text>John Victor Romita (; January 24, 1930 – June 12, 2023) was an American comic book artist best known for his work on Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and for co-creating characters including Mary Jane Watson, the Punisher, Kingpin, Wolverine, and Luke Cage. Romita was the father of John Romita Jr., also a comic book artist, and the husband of Virginia Romita, who was for many years Marvel&#x27;s traffic manager.

His first comics work was in 1949 as a ghost artist for Timely Comics, the precursor to Marvel, through which Romita met editor-in-chief Stan Lee. In 1951, Romita began drawing horror, war, and romance comics for Atlas Comics (previously Timely), and also drew his first superhero work, a 1950s revival of Captain America. He worked exclusively for DC Comics from 1958 to 1965 and was the artist for many of their romance comics. During these years, Romita further developed his ability to draw beautiful women, which he later became well-known for.

Romita joined Marvel in 1965, initially drawing Daredevil comics. In 1966, when Spider-Man artist and co-creator Steve Ditko left Marvel, Romita was chosen by writer Lee as the new artist for &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. Within a year of Romita becoming the Spider-Man artist, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; rose from Marvel&#x27;s second-best-selling title to the company&#x27;s top-seller. Romita brought a new romance style to Spider-Man comics that soon became the new design for the character. In June 1973, Romita was promoted to Marvel&#x27;s art director and heavily influenced the look of Marvel comics throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Romita was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2002.

==Early life==
John Victor Romita was born on January 24, 1930, in Brooklyn, New York City, where he was also raised. The son of Marie and Victor Romita, a baker, he also had three sisters and a brother. Romita was of Italian descent, from Sicily. He began drawing at 5 years old. Romita graduated from Manhattan&#x27;s School of Industrial Art in 1947, having attended for three years after spending ninth grade at a Brooklyn junior high school. Among his instructors were Howard Simon, a book illustrator, and Ben Clements, a magazine illustrator. Romita was deeply influenced by a variety of artists and illustrators. As a young reader of comics, he admired Noel Sickles, Roy Crane, and Milton Caniff. Caniff&#x27;s &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; in particular was an early inspiration for Romita. Later in his career, he also drew inspiration from Sy Barry, Alex Toth, and Carmine Infantino. Beyond comics, he looked up to commercial illustrators such as Jon Whitcomb, Coby Whitmore, and Al Parker.

On Romita&#x27;s 17th birthday, he received his first artist work from the Manhattan General Hospital. An anesthesiologist paid Romita $60 a week to create a medical exhibit on pneumatology medicine, which Romita completed in six months. Romita entered the comics industry in 1949 on the series &quot;Famous Funnies&quot;. &quot;Steven Douglas up there was a benefactor to all young artists&quot;, Romita recalled. &quot;The first story he gave me was a love story. It was terrible. All the women looked like emaciated men and he bought it, never criticized, and told me to keep working. He paid me two hundred dollars for it and never published it—and rightfully so&quot;.

==Career==
Romita was working at the New York City company Forbes Lithograph in 1949, earning $30 a week, when comic book inker Lester Zakarin, a friend from high school whom he ran into on a subway train, offered him either $17 or $20 a page to pencil a 10-page story, possibly a crime comic about 1920s mobsters, for him as an uncredited ghost artist. Now making more money on two pages than his usual weekly salary, Romita accepted the story and continued to ghost for Zakarin on other work. The work was for Marvel&#x27;s 1940s forerunner, Timely Comics, which helped give Romita an opportunity to meet editor-in-chief and art director Stan Lee. Romita ghost-penciled for Zakarin on Trojan Comics&#x27; &quot;Crime-Smashers&quot; and other titles, eventually signing some &quot;Zakarin and Romita&quot;.

===Atlas Comics===

The collaboration ended in early 1951, when Romita was drafted into the U.S. Army. Taking the initiative prior to induction, he showed art samples to the base art director on Governors Island in New York Bay, who arranged for him to be stationed there to do layouts for recruitment posters once Romita had completed basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey. Romita was promoted to corporal after seven or eight months; now allowed to live off the post, he rented an apartment in Brooklyn.

When not on duty, Romita could leave the base and go into Manhattan. In mid- to late 1951, he recalled in 2002, &quot;I went uptown one day for lunch. I stopped over at Stan Lee&#x27;s [office in the Empire State Building, where Timely Comics had by now evolved into Atlas Comics], and his secretary came out ... and I said, &#x27;Stan doesn&#x27;t know my name but I&#x27;ve worked for him for over a year&#x27;. I was in uniform! She must&#x27;ve told him this GI ... wants to do some comics. She said, &#x27;Stan said here&#x27;s a four-page science fiction story&#x27;. I penciled it and struggled with my first inking. That was the first story I did on my own. I did Westerns and war stories then&quot;. The collection &quot;Marvel Visionaries: John Romita Sr.&quot; and former Marvel editor-in-chief Roy Thomas, in &quot;Alter Ego&quot; 9, each identify that four-page science fiction story as &quot;It!&quot;, about a murderous alien in the guise of a baby. That story saw print in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #4 (December 1951), although the Grand Comics Database lists Romita&#x27;s first identified published comic-book work as penciler and inker of the six-page story &quot;The Bradshaw Boys&quot; in Atlas&#x27; &quot;Western Outlaws&quot; #1 (February 1951)—published nearly a year earlier. This may refer to a ghosted Zakarin story. The Atlas Tales database lists both &quot;It!&quot; and the six-page &quot;Out of My Mind&quot;, in &quot;Astonishing&quot; #7 (also December 1951), as Romita&#x27;s first full penciling and inking—although &quot;It!&quot; carries a later job number (9118) than the other tale (8964).

Romita went on to draw a wide variety of horror comics, war comics, romance comics and other genres for Atlas. His most prominent work for the company was the short-lived 1950s revival of Timely&#x27;s hit character Captain America, in &quot;Young Men&quot; #24–28 (December 1953 – July 1954) and &quot;Captain America&quot; #76–78 (May–September 1954). Romita had been offered the Captain America work by Lee after Mort Lawrence&#x27;s art was deemed unsatisfactory. The character was billed now as &quot;Captain America, Commie Smasher&quot; in the wake of the Cold War and faced enemies associated with the Soviet Union. The series was a commercial failure, and was cancelled after just three issues. Romita attributed the series&#x27; failure to the changing political climate, particularly the public opposition to the Korean War; the character subsequently fell out of active publication for nearly a decade.

Additionally, Romita would render one of his first original characters, M-11 the Human Robot, in a five-page standalone science-fiction story in &quot;Menace&quot; #11 (May 1954). While not envisioned as an ongoing character, M-11 was resurrected decades later as a member of the super-hero team Agents of Atlas. Romita was the primary artist for one of the first series with a black star, &quot;Waku, Prince of the Bantu&quot;—created by writer Don Rico and artist Ogden Whitney in the omnibus title &quot;Jungle Tales&quot; #1 (September 1954). The ongoing short feature starred an African chieftain in Africa, with no regularly featured Caucasian characters. Romita succeeded Whitney with issue #2 (November 1954).

===DC Comics romance-comics artist===
In the mid-1950s, while continuing to freelance for Atlas, Romita did uncredited work for DC Comics. Romita had been recommended to DC&#x27;s editors by his artist friend Carmine Infantino while serving in the Korean War. After declining comics sales in the late 1950s forced Atlas to let most of their artists go, Romita transitioned to work for DC exclusively in 1958. His first known work for the company is the tentatively identified penciling credit for the cover of romance comic &quot;Secret Hearts&quot; #58 (October 1959), and, confirmably, pencils for the seven-page story &quot;I Know My Love&quot;, inked by Bernard Sachs in &quot;Heart Throbs&quot; #63 (January 1960). Other titles to which he contributed include &quot;Falling in Love&quot;, &quot;Girls&#x27; Love Stories&quot;, &quot;Girls&#x27; Romances&quot;, and &quot;Young Love&quot;.

Romita&#x27;s artwork for these stories followed the house style for DC comics, and the first pages of his issues were often done by another artist. The cover art for romance comics was soon done primarily by Romita. He would &quot;swipe&quot;—an artists&#x27; term for using existing work as models, a common practice among novices—from movie stills and from the Milton Caniff comic strip &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;. Bernard Sachs and Sy Barry inked some of Romita&#x27;s romance work, but Romita began inking his own pencils in the late 1950s or early 1960s. Romita had hoped a DC editor would eventually offer him a superhero comic, such as a &quot;Batman&quot; filler issue, but Romita remained on the romance titles.

Shortly afterward, however, romance comics began declining in popularity, and by 1965, DC had ceased buying art for new romance comics. The company then only used romance comics from their large inventory of previously unpublished comics or published reprints. Romita was not offered work by the other genre departments, although admitted he did not try to present himself to them either. Romita&#x27;s last known DC story work was the six-page &quot;My Heart Tricked Me&quot;, inked by Sachs, in &quot;Girls&#x27; Romances&quot; #121 (December 1966), though his spot illustrations, some or all of it reprints of earlier work, continued to appear on one-page &quot;beauty tip&quot; and other filler pages, as well as on letters pages, through early 1970, as did the occasional reprinted story.

===Joining Marvel Comics===
Even before his final original DC story was published, Romita had already returned to freelance for what had now become Marvel Comics. His first work for Marvel was inking Jack Kirby&#x27;s cover and Don Heck&#x27;s interior pencils on the superhero-team comic &quot;The Avengers&quot; #23 (December 1965).

Romita directed most of his efforts, however, toward finding advertising storyboard work. He obtained a position at the large ad agency BBDO through his friend Al Normandia, one of the firm&#x27;s art directors. &quot;They were going to pay me $250 a week. I&#x27;d made just over $200 a week with the romance [comics] but only by killing myself&quot; with long hours of work. Struggling to find new ideas for comics, Romita decided he would only do inking for comic work again.

Marvel editor Stan Lee, however, had heard of Romita leaving DC, and asked to see him. At a three-hour meeting over lunch, Romita recalled that Lee promised to match the agency salary if Romita would come work for Marvel. Lee also assured him the freedom to choose his work location, allowing him to work either from home or the office on any given day, based on Romita&#x27;s own preference. Romita had also received an offer to work in advertising, but chose Marvel instead because Lee had promised consistent assignments. Though Romita felt he no longer wanted to pencil, in favor of being solely an inker, Lee soon enticed him otherwise:

Romita began a brief stint on &quot;Daredevil&quot; beginning with issue #12 (January 1966), initially penciling over Jack Kirby&#x27;s dynamic layouts as a means of learning Marvel&#x27;s storytelling house style. Sales perked; while the title had a smaller print run than Marvel flagships &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, it briefly had the company&#x27;s highest percentage of sales compared to print-run. It also proved to be a stepping-stone for Romita&#x27;s signature, years-long penciling run on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. During this time, a DC editor offered Romita to work on their Metamorpho character, but he declined. Lee wrote a two-part &quot;Daredevil&quot; story for issues #16–17 (May–June 1966) with Spider-Man guest starring, to see the character depicted by Romita.

===Spider-Man===
The reason for the tryout was the growing estrangement between Spider-Man co-creators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. When Ditko abruptly left Marvel after completing &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #38 (July 1966), Lee gave Romita the assignment. This followed Romita&#x27;s eight-issue &quot;Daredevil&quot; run, the cover of the subsequent issue #20 (September 1966), and an incidental Hulk and two Captain America stories (in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #77, March 1966, and &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #76–77, April–May 1966, respectively). While Romita&#x27;s depiction of Spider-Man would eventually become the company mascot and the definitive look to the general public, the artist had trepidations:

Lee later commented that this transition in Romita&#x27;s style actually worked out for the benefit of the series, as it gradually weaned readers off the Ditko look while ultimately allowing Romita to work in the style he most excelled at. Romita took over &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; with issue #39 (August 1966). His first inker on what would become Marvel&#x27;s flagship series was Mike Esposito, who initially used the pseudonym &quot;Mickey Demeo&quot; to conceal from his regular employer, rival DC Comics, that he was moonlighting at Marvel. After three issues, Romita inked himself for issues #43–48 (November 1966 – May 1967), before Esposito returned—uncredited for issue #49 (June 1967), then as Mickey Demeo until finally taking credit under his own name with issue #56 (January 1968). Except for one issue (#65) inked by his successor, Jim Mooney, the Romita-Esposito team continued through issue #66 (November 1968), establishing the new look of Spider-Man. &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; had been Marvel&#x27;s second-best-selling title at the time Romita began drawing it. Within a year, it overtook &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; to become the company&#x27;s top seller.

Romita designed the look of Mary Jane Watson, a supporting character in the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; series who would later become the lead character&#x27;s romantic interest. Romita has stated that in designing Mary Jane, he &quot;used Ann-Margret from the movie &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; as a guide, using her coloring, the shape of her face, her red hair and her form-fitting short skirts.&quot; Mary Jane Watson made her first full appearance in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #42 (November 1966), although she first appeared in #25 (June 1965) with her face obscured and had been mentioned since #15 (August 1964). Peter David wrote in 2010 that Romita &quot;made the definitive statement of his arrival by pulling Mary Jane out from behind the oversized potted plant [that blocked the readers&#x27; view of her face in issue #25] and placing her on panel in what would instantly become an iconic moment.&quot; Other characters that debuted in the Lee-Romita era include the Rhino in #41 (October 1966), the Shocker in #46 (March 1967), the Kingpin in #50 (June 1967), and George Stacy in #56 (January 1968). Romita had based George Stacy on actor Charles Bickford. Lee and Romita&#x27;s stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man&#x27;s adventures. The stories became more topical, addressing issues such as the Vietnam War, political elections, and student activism.

Romita, increasingly called upon to do art corrections and touch-ups, and to interface with artists for ever-busy editor Lee, became Marvel&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; art director. Cutting back on his Spider-Man workload, Romita began doing only layouts, with finished pencils by Don Heck or Jim Mooney for nearly every issue for a year-and-a-half (#57–75, February 1968 – August 1969). Romita then stepped back for six issues, drawing only covers while John Buscema laid out issues #76–81 (September 1969 – February 1970) for others to finish.

These steps at reducing Romita&#x27;s Spider-Man workload had mixed results, Romita recalled in 2001, saying, &quot;Stan was always trying to speed me up. He had Don Heck pencil over my breakdowns for a while. ... Then, when Don had finished the pencils, [Lee would] call me in to fix up anything ... that he didn&#x27;t like. Even after it was inked, he&#x27;d have me changing what the inker had done. I told him, &#x27;This was supposed to save me time, but it isn&#x27;t!&#x27; &quot;. Romita&#x27;s initial run on the title, abetted by the three other artists, lasted through issue #95 (April 1971). Gil Kane succeeded him as Spider-Man&#x27;s regular penciler through issue #105 (February 1972). Romita then began a second stint, doing full pencils for issues #105–115 and #119 (February–December 1972, April 1974), and providing occasional inking and most of the cover art through issue #168 (May 1977). Romita suggested to writer Gerry Conway that supporting character Gwen Stacy should die at the hands of the Green Goblin in &quot;The Night Gwen Stacy Died&quot; in issue #121 (June 1973). Her demise and the Goblin&#x27;s apparent death one issue later formed a story arc widely considered as the most defining in the history of Spider-Man. In a June 2017 interview with SyFy Wire, Romita named &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #108 and 109 as the two stories he was proudest of, explaining that by the time he did those issues, he was no longer invoking Steve Ditko, and was asserting his own style as an artist. Romita pointed to the Milton Caniff-inspired brushwork with which he rendered those pages, and lamented no longer owning the originals.

Comics-art historian Daniel Herman assessed of Romita&#x27;s Spider-Man work:

Romita was the artist for the Spider-Man newspaper comic strip from its launch on January 3, 1977 through late 1980. He continued in his role as Marvel&#x27;s art director during this time, anticipating that the strip would not last. Romita had promised Lee that he would continue the comic strip as long as sales continued to grow. The Spider-Man comic strip reached an audience of 500 newspapers, making it one of the most popular adventure comic strips at the time. At the start of the fourth year, the strip&#x27;s number had begun to stagnate and then decline.

===Marvel Comics art director===
After editor-in-chief and art director Stan Lee assumed the positions of publisher and president in 1972, he promoted Romita to the position of art director in July 1973 after Romita had been in that position unofficially but on staff since 1972. In that capacity through at least the late 1980s, Romita played a major role in defining the look of Marvel Comics and in designing new characters. Among the characters he designed or helped design are the Punisher, Wolverine, Luke Cage, Bullseye, Tigra, and Brother Voodoo. Romita&#x27;s catlike design for Wolverine was based on an encyclopedia description he found on wolverines, as vicious short animals with claws. For the Punisher, a rough sketch was provided by writer Gerry Conway, with a skull and crossbones on the chest. Feeling this was too simple, Romita made the skull larger to encompass the Punisher&#x27;s torso, with his belt buckle resembling teeth. Romita also designed Natasha Romanova&#x27;s Black Widow outfit, inspired by Miss Fury.

Romita collaborated with The Electric Company and to produce &quot;Spidey Super Stories&quot; comics, which were aimed at a younger audience and created with help from child psychologists. The series had 57 comics produced between 1974 and 1982. Romita created another program called &quot;Romita&#x27;s Raiders&quot;, which allowed young artists to gain hands-on experience and learn from the art staff at Marvel.

In 1976, Romita did uncredited art corrections on the large-format, first DC/Marvel intercompany crossover, &quot;Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, over the pencils of Ross Andru. Later that same year, Romita inked Jack Kirby&#x27;s pencil work on &quot;Captain America&#x27;s Bicentennial Battles&quot;, a one-shot story published in an oversized treasury format. Around 1980, Romita&#x27;s art directing duties expanded from comic books to special projects. His duties included supervising and hiring other artists, providing corrections and cover sketches when needed, and drawing art for various merchandise.

===Later career===
Romita inked the debut of new Captain Marvel Monica Rambeau in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; #16 (1982) and the first appearance of the Hobgoblin in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #238 (March 1983). He was one of six pencilers on &quot;Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #121 (December 1986), and he penciled the nine-page story &quot;I Remember Gwen&quot; in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #365 (August 1992, the 30th-anniversary issue) and an eight-page backup story starring the hero and supporting character the Prowler in &quot;Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man Annual&quot; #13 (1993). In 1996, Romita announced his semi-retirement, but continued to work on multiple comics projects.

Romita both penciled and inked the 10-page backup story &quot;The Kiss&quot;—a flashback in which Peter Parker (Spider-Man) and his girlfriend Gwen Stacy share their first kiss—in &quot;Webspinners: Tales of Spider-Man&quot; #1 (January 1999). He drew an alternate-universe version of the Spider-Man characters in the one-shot &quot;Spidey: A Universe X Special&quot; (2001), and penciled the final four pages of the 38-page story in the milestone &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #500 (December 2003) together with his son John Jr. penciling the other pages. Romita drew one of four covers to the April 27 – May 3, 2002, issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot; to promote the release of the 2002 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film.

In the early 2000s, Romita contributed to multi-artist jams in commemorative issues. He did a panel in &quot;Captain America&quot; vol. 3, #50 (February 2002), starring the first Marvel superhero he had drawn; a portion of &quot;Iron Man&quot; vol. 3, #40 (May 2001), although the hero was not one of the artist&#x27;s signature characters; a panel for &quot;Daredevil&quot; vol. 2, #50 (October 2003); and a few pages featuring Karen Page in &quot;Daredevil&quot; vol. 2, #100 (October 2007), done in the style of the romance comics he had drawn decades earlier. Romita both penciled and inked the cover of &quot;Daredevil&quot; vol. 2, #94 (February 2007) in that same romance comics style. The following year he drew a variant cover of his signature series, for &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #568 (October 2008), doing so again with #642 (November 2010).

A Romita image of Spider-Man and a Hulk image penciled by Rich Buckler and inked by Romita were among the &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; set of commemorative stamps issued by the U.S. Postal Service on July 27, 2007.

As of 2013, he served on the Disbursement Committee of the comic-book industry charity The Hero Initiative.

==Awards==
Romita received an Inkpot Award in 1979, and was inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 2002. Romita was inducted into the Inkwell Awards Joe Sinnott Hall of Fame in 2020.

==Personal life==

John Romita Sr. married childhood sweetheart Virginia Bruno in November 1952, who also worked on staff at Marvel as traffic manager from 1975 to 1996. They lived in Brooklyn&#x27;s Bensonhurst neighborhood until 1954, when they bought a house in the Queens neighborhood of Queens Village. Some years later, the family moved to Bellerose, New York, on Long Island.

Romita and his wife had two sons, Victor and John Jr. (born August 17, 1956), who followed in his footsteps to become a noted comic-book artist himself. At the time of his death, Romita had three grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.

==Death==
Romita died in his sleep at his home in Floral Park, New York on June 12, 2023, at the age of 93. The news was broken by his son, John Jr., the following day.

==Artistic style==
Romita has been credited with creating a new Spider-Man art style with romance and adventure influences that appealed to an even wider audience. He drew a more handsome Peter Parker and beautiful women, and depicted &quot;beautiful suffering&quot; that combined soap opera and fantasy themes. The Romita have been described as &quot;The artist&#x27;s line work became more rounded, and his depiction of women in particular became a real strength that would sustain him in years to come. His women were described as &quot;fair of face but realistic rather than stylized&quot; and displayed distinctive personalities through body language. Comic artist Alex Ross has stated, &quot;For me, John&#x27;s Spidey is a design of such perfection and beauty so as to be simply the greatest-looking character in comics, by his hand.&quot;

While working on DC&#x27;s romance comics, Romita, finding the stories dull and repetitive, began looking for ways to add more personality into the artwork. For example, Romita would add flowing hair on women or objects moving in the wind for panels that had little happening and depicting characters from unique angles. After moving to Marvel, Romita was known for drawing stylistic deep shadows and defined bone structure.

<text>John Salvatore Romita (; born August 17, 1956) is an American comics artist best known for his extensive work for Marvel Comics from the 1970s to the 2010s. He is the son of artist John Romita Sr.

==Early life==
John Romita Jr. was born August 17, 1956, the son of Virginia (Bruno) and comic book artist John Romita Sr., one of the signature &quot;Spider-Man&quot; artists since the 1960s. He studied advertising art and design at Farmingdale State College in East Farmingdale, New York, graduating in 1976.

==Career==
Romita Jr.&#x27;s first contribution to Marvel Comics was at the age of 13 with the creation of the original Prowler, a sketch of which Romita had produced. Editor Stan Lee liked the name but not the costume; Romita combined the name with a design that he had previously intended for a character called the Stalker that was intended for the never-published &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #3. Inspired by Romita&#x27;s drawing, Lee, John Buscema and Jim Mooney created the Hobie Brown version of the character that would debut in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #78 (Nov. 1969).

Romita Jr. began his career at Marvel UK, doing sketches for covers of reprints. His American debut was a pin-up on Kid Colt Outlaw #218 and two months later with a six-page story entitled &quot;Chaos at the Coffee Bean!&quot; in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; #11 (1977).

Romita&#x27;s early popularity began with his run on &quot;Iron Man&quot; with writer David Michelinie and artist Bob Layton which began in 1978. The creative team introduced several supporting characters, including Tony Stark&#x27;s bodyguard girlfriend Bethany Cabe and rival industrialist Justin Hammer. In the early 1980s, he had his first regular run on the series &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and also was the artist for the launch of the &quot;Dazzler&quot; series. He and writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil introduced Madame Web in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #210 (Nov. 1980) and Hydro-Man in issue #212 (Jan. 1981). In 1982, Romita Jr. drew &quot;Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions&quot; the first limited series published by Marvel Comics. Working with writer Roger Stern on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, he co-created the character Hobgoblin. From 1983 to 1986 he had a run on the &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; with Dan Green and author Chris Claremont and co-created Forge. Romita has downplayed the significance of his run, saying that few of the characters introduced during this time were co-created by him and that his style has had no discernible influence on succeeding X-Men artists. His relationship with Claremont was rather cool at the time, as Claremont did not like his work as much as the artists he had previously worked with. He would return for a second run on &quot;Uncanny X-Men &quot;in 1993, which he said he liked better &quot;because of getting to work with [writer] Scott Lobdell.&quot;

After he ended his first run on &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;, Romita was assigned to &quot;Star Brand&quot;, one of the titles on Marvel&#x27;s New Universe imprint, which featured a character the Romita was told would be Marvel&#x27;s version of Superman. The title did not do well in sales, and Romita could not return to the X-Men. This experience, and personality conflicts that he had with those in editorial left Romita so disillusioned that he considered quitting the industry entirely. However, editor Ralph Macchio approached him one day as Romita was leaving the Marvel offices and asked him to consider working on &quot;Daredevil&quot;. Romita had never considered working on that character, despite the fact that his father had done so, but Macchio said he would be paired with writer Ann Nocenti, and that he would not only be allowed to do full pencils for the first time (having previously been restricted to doing only breakdowns), but would also collaborate on plots, and be allowed to choose his own inker. A skeptical Romita jokingly said he wanted Al Williamson, and was surprised when Williamson was assigned was confirmed a day later. For Romita himself, his stint on &quot;Daredevil&quot; was most significant for being both the first time he was allowed to do full pencils, and the first time he had a working relationship with the writer on a series. He later remarked that &quot;I finally felt like I was part of the creation process for the first time while I was on DD.&quot; In a 2017 interview with SyFy Wire, Romita stated this run reinvigorated his enthusiasm for comics work, marking a turning point in his career. His run on the title from 1988 to 1990 included the creation of long-running Daredevil nemesis Typhoid Mary. After &quot;Daredevil&quot; #282, Romita left the series to pursue other projects, though his experience on &quot;Daredevil&quot; would influence his later return to the character with Frank Miller.
Stan Lee interviewed Romita and his father in Episode 8 of the 1991–1992 documentary series &quot;The Comic Book Greats&quot;.

He worked on a host of Marvel titles during the 1990s, including a return to &quot;Iron Man&quot; for the second &quot;Armor Wars&quot; story arc, written by John Byrne; &quot;The Punisher War Zone&quot;; the &quot;Cable&quot; miniseries; and the &quot;Punisher/Batman&quot; crossover. Klaus Janson was a frequent inker.

Romita contacted Frank Miller and told him that he wanted to collaborate on a graphic novel, suggesting they work on Wolverine. Miller dismissed this, saying that too many other creators were producing books featuring that character, and instead sent Romita a rejected 64-page film treatment for what was essentially a &quot;Daredevil Year One&quot;-type story. After Romita completed adapating the story into comics form, Miller told him that he had written an addendum to be set in between Pages 17 and 18, which ended up adding 84 more pages to the book, changing its format. The result was the 144-page, 5-issue miniseries &quot;Daredevil: The Man Without Fear&quot;, which was published in 1993, The book was a retelling of the character&#x27;s origin, which reunited Romita with Williamson on inks. In a 2017 interview, Romita said that in terms of storytelling, he thought that &quot;Man Without Fear&quot; was the best work he had ever done, due to the strong storytelling and the quality of the story. Elements from the storyline were adapted into the 2015 Netflix series &quot;Daredevil&quot;.

In July 1998 Dan Jurgens and Romita Jr. relaunched the &quot;Thor&quot; series.

A January 1999 reboot of &quot;Peter Parker: Spider-Man&quot; was handled by Howard Mackie and Romita Jr.

In 2001, Romita returned to Spider-Man for a collaboration with writer J. Michael Straczynski beginning with &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; vol. 2 #30 (June 2001). The creative team produced a story for issue #36 (Dec. 2001) that served as memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks. He drew Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Wolverine&quot; with author Mark Millar. In 2004, Romita&#x27;s creator-owned project &quot;The Gray Area&quot; was published by Image Comics. He subsequently worked on the Marvel series &quot;Black Panther&quot;, &quot;The Sentry&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Vision&quot;, a backup feature in the Ultimate Marvel line, written by Mark Millar.

In 2006, Romita collaborated with writer Neil Gaiman on a seven-issue miniseries reinterpretation of Jack Kirby&#x27;s characters the Eternals. Romita worked with Greg Pak on the five-issue central miniseries of Marvel&#x27;s 2007 crossover storyline, &quot;World War Hulk&quot;.

In 2008, Romita again returned to &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. He also collaborated once more with Millar, for a creator-owned series, &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;, published by Marvel&#x27;s Icon imprint. This was later adapted into the 2010 film &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;. Romita, one of the producers, directed an animated flashback sequence in the film.

Also in 2010 he relaunched the Avengers title with popular writer Brian Michael Bendis as part of Marvel&#x27;s Heroic Age initiative.

On April 9, 2011, Romita was one of 62 comics creators who appeared at the IGN stage at the Kapow! convention in London to set two Guinness World Records, the &quot;Fastest Production of a Comic Book&quot; and &quot;Most Contributors to a Comic Book&quot;. With Guinness officials on hand to monitor their progress, writer Millar began work at 9 a.m. scripting a 20-page black-and-white comic book of his character Superior, with Romita and the other artists appearing on stage throughout the day to work on the pencils, inks, and lettering, each drawing a panel. The book was completed in 11 hours, 19 minutes, and 38 seconds, and was published through Icon on November 23, 2011, with all royalties being donated to Yorkhill Children&#x27;s Foundation.

On May 4, 2012, Romita set out to break his own record for continuous cartooning, to support the charity Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation of Nevada. He attempted to continuously sketch characters and sign comics for 50 hours straight.

In 2014, Romita Jr. became the penciller of the DC Comics flagship title &quot;Superman&quot;, starting with issue #32, in collaboration with writer Geoff Johns. Romita Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; pencils have been inked by Klaus Janson. In 2016, Romita Jr. and writer Scott Snyder collaborated on the &quot;All-Star Batman&quot; series as part of the DC Rebirth relaunch. Romita Jr. and writer Dan Abnett created &quot;The Silencer&quot; series as part of DC&#x27;s &quot;Dark Metal&quot; line. In addition, Romita worked with Frank Miller on the mini-series.

In 2020, Romita drew Kelly Sue DeConnick&#x27;s story &quot;Fore&quot; for &quot;Detective Comics&quot;″ 1027th issue.

In 2022 he once again returned to the Amazing Spider-Man title, this time with writer Zeb Wells

===Influences and techniques===
Romita&#x27;s art influences include his father John Romita Sr., as well as comics artists Jack Kirby and John Buscema, the Wyeth family of painters, and illustrator Charles Dana Gibson.

Having illustrated both gritty street-level stories of characters such as Spider-Man and Daredevil and cosmic stories such as those starring Thor, Romita says he prefers the former, because &quot;that is where I grew up. I use the same approach to each of the different story types – the story tells me what to do.&quot; He prefers to work in the Marvel Method.

==Awards==
John Romita Jr. received an Inkpot Award in 1994.

With writer J. Michael Straczynski and inker Scott Hanna, Romita Jr. won a 2002 Eisner Award for Best Serialized Story: &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #30-35: &quot;Coming Home&quot;.

<doc id="853331" wikidata="Q3070246" url="?curid=853331" title="Gilroy Garlic Festival">
<text>The Gilroy Garlic Festival was a food festival in the United States, held annually from 1979 to 2019 at Christmas Hill Park in Gilroy, California, on the last full weekend in July. After its cancellation in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a drive-through festival was held on July 23–25 and 30–31 July and August 1, 2021. In April 2022, the Gilroy Garlic Festival Association announced the indefinite suspension of the traditional large-format festival, stating that it would instead host smaller individual events. In May 2022, the festival was canceled permanently.

An annual three-day event, the Gilroy Garlic Festival was one of the country&#x27;s best-known food festivals, drawing visitors from across the nation. Located about southeast of San Jose, Gilroy is home to about 60,000 people, and the city is a major producer of garlic. The festival was Gilroy&#x27;s top fundraiser, staffed with volunteers to raise money for nonprofit groups including clubs and schools.

==History==

The inaugural Garlic Festival was held in 1979. Rudolph J. Malone, then President of Gavilan College in Gilroy, was inspired by a small town in France which hosted an annual garlic festival and claimed to be the &quot;Garlic Capital of the World.&quot; Malone started the festival, which attracted hundreds of thousands of paying visitors a year.

===2019 shooting===
On July 28, 2019, a mass shooting occurred at the 41st edition of the festival. Three people were killed, in addition to the gunman, and 12 others were injured.

===COVID-19 pandemic and cancellation===
The festival was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while 2021 saw a drive-thru festival. In April 2022, the Gilroy Garlic Festival Association announced that the event would be canceled thereafter due to prolonged losses, &quot;lingering uncertainties from the pandemic,&quot; and &quot;prohibitive insurance requirements by the City of Gilroy&quot; since the 2019 shooting.

=== California Garlic Festival ===
The California Garlic Festival has been held annually since 2022 in response to the cancellation of the Gilroy Garlic Festival. The California Garlic Festival is sometimes considered a successor of the Gilroy Garlic Festival, although they are held by two unrelated organizers.

== In popular culture ==
The Garlic Festival was featured by Huell Howser in &quot;Road Trip&quot; Episode 124.

<doc id="853348" wikidata="Q2009797" url="?curid=853348" title="Larry Lieber">
<text>Lawrence D. Lieber (; born October 26, 1931) is an American comic book writer and artist best known as co-creator of the Marvel Comics superheroes Iron Man, Thor, and Ant-Man. He is also known for his long stint both writing and drawing the Marvel Western &quot;Rawhide Kid&quot; and for illustrating the newspaper comic strip &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; from 1986 to 2018. From 1974 to 1975, he was editor of Atlas/Seaboard Comics. Lieber is the younger brother of Stan Lee, who had been a writer, editor, and publisher of Marvel Comics.

==Early life==
Larry Lieber was born in Manhattan, New York City, the second child of Romanian-Jewish immigrant parents Celia (née Solomon) and Jack Lieber, and the brother of Stanley Martin Lieber, later known as Marvel Comics editor and impresario Stan Lee. When he was six months old, the family moved to The Bronx, settling at 1720 University Avenue, which Lee described as a one-bedroom, &quot;third-floor apartment facing out back&quot;, with him and Larry sharing a bedroom and his parents using a foldout couch. At &quot;about ten-and-a-half&quot;, with his brother in the U.S. Army, Lieber and his parents returned to Manhattan, moving to the Washington Heights neighborhood. Already interested in art and drawing by this time, he attended George Washington High School there.

Lee wrote in his autobiography that when Larry was a teenager, the boys&#x27; mother died and Lieber went to live with his brother and his sister-in-law, Joan, prompting the trio&#x27;s move to Woodmere, New York, on Long Island. Lee elsewhere described that move to a two-story, three-bedroom home at 1084 West Broadway as occurring in 1949, when Larry would have been 17 or 18. As Lieber recalled it to comics historian Daniel Best, &quot;My mother died when I was 16. My brother was back from the Service, he was just married and he moved out outside of New York to Long Island. I lived with him for a while and it didn&#x27;t work out so well. I wanted to leave, so I left. I was very young and I had a couple of jobs.&quot;

At 17, Lieber became a messenger for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and also found work at the Times Square studio of Sam Furber, a letterer whose work included movie posters. For roughly a year and a half, he lived in the since-defunct Hotel Manhattan Towers, a residence hotel at Broadway and West 76th Street in Manhattan.

==Career==

===Early work===
In 1941, Lee was made the editor of Timely Comics, the future Marvel Comics, then a division of a publishing company owned by a relative, Martin Goodman. Lieber began working for Goodman as an art assistant on the magazine side, &quot;doing paste-ups. ... I was working during the day and I went to [the Pratt Institute art school, in Brooklyn, in] the evening.&quot; There Lieber began illustrating comic books; his first known credit is penciling and inking the four-page crime comics story &quot;Cop on the Beat&quot;, by an unknown writer, in &quot;All True Crime&quot; #44 (cover-dated May 1951).

In 1951, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, beginning four years of military service. Serving during the Korean War, he spent two of those years stationed at Okinawa, after having done his boot-camp training at the since-defunct Sampson Air Force Base, near the Finger Lakes region of New York State.

===1950s===
After returning from the service, Lieber attended Manhattan&#x27;s Art Students League. &quot;I still wanted to be an artist and do comics, but I had in mind to eventually become an illustrator,&quot; he said in 1999. &quot;I was drawing, but I was slow.&quot; He again drew for his brother, editor Stan Lee, at the 1950s forerunner of Marvel Comics, known generally as Atlas Comics, though whether on staff or freelance is uncertain. Regardless, his next confirmed credit is penciling and inking the three-page story &quot;A World to Conquer&quot; in &quot;Journey into Unknown Worlds&quot; #52 (Dec. 1956), followed by stories in such Atlas romance comics as &quot;Love Romances&quot;, &quot;Love Tales&quot;, &quot;Stories of Romance&quot;, &quot;True Tales of Love&quot; and &quot;The Romances of Nurse Helen Grant&quot; in issues cover-dated April to August 1957 and July 1958. Because it was not standard industry practice during this time to give writer and artist credits, Lieber may have supplied more. He recalled in 1999 he had written some or all of these stories himself, &quot;because I remember Stan was saying to me, &#x27;You write romances really well.&#x27;&quot; In 1958, following an economic downturn for the publisher and the firing of virtually all the comics staffers save Lee, &quot;Stan said he wanted somebody to help him write, and he had nobody then; he was doing it all himself. I said, &#x27;I&#x27;m not really a writer.&#x27; He said, &#x27;Oh, I&#x27;ve read your letters.&#x27;&quot;

Lieber, by now living in the Tudor City apartment complex in Manhattan, began freelancing regularly for the nascent Marvel Comics, &quot;writing stories for Jack [Kirby] to draw&quot;, referring to the artist who had co-created Captain America for the company in 1940 and had recently returned for a long, exclusive stint in which Kirby would co-create many signature Marvel characters in the Silver Age of Comics. At this point in the late 1950s, Kirby was drawing science fiction / fantasy stories followed by giant-monster tales in what collectors and historians call &quot;pre-superhero Marvel&quot; comics, primarily &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot;, &quot;Strange Tales&quot;, &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; and &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;. As Lieber recalled of those creature features,

Lieber&#x27;s earliest, tentatively confirmed pre-superhero Marvel script is for the six-page Don Heck-illustrated &quot;I Am the Beast-Man&quot; in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #77 (Oct. 1960), and his first confirmed is the 13-page &quot;I Led the Strange Search for Manoo&quot;, penciled by Kirby and inked by Dick Ayers, in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; #2 (July 1961).

===Marvel superheroes and the Rawhide Kid===
Under Stan Lee plots, Lieber would go on to script the debut origin stories and other early appearances of the superheroes Thor (co-created with artist Jack Kirby) in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot;, Iron Man (co-created with Kirby and Don Heck) in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot;, and Ant-Man (co-created with Kirby) in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;. This included creating the names of their respective alter egos: Don Blake, Tony Stark, and Henry Pym. His first superhero work, the first appearance of Marvel&#x27;s Thor in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #83 (Aug. 1962), introduced one of the mainstays of the Marvel Universe, the mystical metal &quot;uru&quot;, of which Thor&#x27;s hammer Mjolnir is made. As Lieber recalled, &quot;I kind of liked it; it was short. It&#x27;s easy on the letterer; they&#x27;re going to be using it all the time. I don&#x27;t know where the hell I came up with it. I used to get names out of the back of the dictionary, from the biographical section where you have foreign names, Russian, this and that. I used to go to it and gets parts of names to put together.&quot;

As Stan Lee recalled, in his trademark jocular style, in 1974,

Lieber in 1999 remembered circumstances less hyperbolically: &quot;Thor was just another story. I didn&#x27;t think about it at all. Stan said, &#x27;I&#x27;m trying to make up a character,&#x27; and he gave me the plot, and he said, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you write the story?&#x27;&quot; Under Lee&#x27;s plotting, Lieber&#x27;s eight Thor stories also introduced the Marvel characters Loki, Odin, and Balder, from the pantheon of Norse mythological gods; their home, Asgard; and Bifrost the Rainbow Bridge, which connected that realm to Earth. For another series, starring the Human Torch from the Fantastic Four, Lieber co-created the longstanding supervillain the Wizard in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #102 (Nov. 1962).

After the debut Iron Man story in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #39 (March 1963), however, Lee replaced Lieber with Robert Bernstein, writing as &quot;R. Berns&quot;, for the next seven issues before Lee took over the reins himself for a few stories. Don Rico, writing as &quot;N. Korok&quot;, followed for a two-issue stint. Lee then took over as regular writer for the next few years. Lieber wrote the first nine Ant-Man stories (following the character&#x27;s non-costumed introduction months earlier) in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #35-43 (Sept. 1962 - May 1963) before veteran Ernie Hart did five issues, followed by Lee taking over. As Lieber explained, Lee

Lieber, who credits Lee as a good editor, writer and writing teacher, said his brother made very few editorial changes to Lieber&#x27;s scripts. &quot;He would go over it and ... if it were in the early years, he might correct or change a line or two. But he always used it. ... I never had to, you know, go home and do it again. He was very easy, he was showing me ... and he&#x27;d make some little corrections. And as time went on, he had fewer to make.&quot;

Lieber largely left superheroes to write and pencil what would be his signature series, the Marvel Western &quot;Rawhide Kid&quot;, beginning with issue #41 (Aug. 1964) and continuing through 1973 (after which it became a reprint title). Lieber recalled,


Lieber also penciled &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; #4-5 (1967-1968), the latter introducing in flashback the late parents of protagonist Peter Parker; co-wrote and co-penciled the first solo Doctor Doom feature story, in &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot; #20 (May 1969); and did occasional other work including, for Magazine Management&#x27;s men&#x27;s magazines, several stories of the bawdy &quot;nudie-cutie&quot; comedy feature &quot;Pussycat&quot;.

With the end of his run on &quot;Rawhide Kid&quot;, Lieber found little further Marvel work. He scripted and occasionally also drew the odd Western or Sgt. Fury war-comics story or a standalone tale in one of the Marvel line of black-and-white magazines such as &quot;Vampire Tales&quot; or &quot;Haunt of Horror&quot;. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a very easy period,&quot; he said in 1999. &quot;They needed superhero-reprint covers, and I could do them somewhat in Kirby&#x27;s style.&quot; He considered seeking work at rival DC Comics, as some other Marvel writers and artists did, but found, &quot;I was the only one who could never do that because that was the price for Stan being my brother. So I could never do that. ... They would have thought Stan Lee is sending over a spy or something you know. I would see what they&#x27;re doing and go back or whatever the hell it was. So I couldn&#x27;t do that, I couldn&#x27;t work.&quot;

===Atlas/Seaboard and return to Marvel===
In 1974, Lieber left Marvel to take on an editorship at Atlas/Seaboard Comics, the term comic book historians and collectors use to refer to the &quot;Atlas Comics&quot; line published by Seaboard Periodicals, to differentiate it from the 1950s Marvel Comics predecessor Atlas Comics. Marvel Comics founder and longtime publisher Martin Goodman had left Marvel in 1972, having sold the company in 1968, and launched this new company in June 1974 to go head-to-head with Marvel and DC Comics. He hired Lieber to be editor of the Atlas black-and-white comics-magazines, and additionally hired Warren Publishing veteran Jeff Rovin to edit the color comic-book line, which soon fell under Lieber&#x27;s editorship.

As Lieber, in a 1999 interview, described his experience as editor:

When Atlas went under in late 1975, Lieber received six months severance pay and spent time trying to devise a newspaper comic strip for syndication. Lee then offered him the editorship of Marvel UK, the New York City-based imprint that produced black-and-white reprint comics for the UK market, as well as new stories of the superhero Captain Britain. With co-scripter Gary Friedrich primarily, Lieber wrote the hero&#x27;s seven-page lead feature in the weekly &quot;Captain Britain&quot; #24-37 (March 23 - June 22, 1977), and, with co-writer Jim Lawrence, Captain Britain adventures in Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;Super Spider-Man&quot; #233-246 (July 27-Oct. 26, 1977). Lieber also wrote and penciled two Spider-Man stories, in &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot; #21 and 25 (Dec. 1986, April 1987).

===Hulk and Spider-Man comic strips===
In 1978, Lieber began penciling and sometimes inking the new daily and Sunday comic strip &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, written by Lee and syndicated by the Register and Tribune Syndicate. He additionally began writing it in early 1979. Though he gave up the role of regular artist in Spring 1979 and the role of regular writer in mid-1982, he would still write and draw the occasional installment until the strip&#x27;s end in September 1982. Lieber said Lee gave a rare compliment on the Hulk strip, telling his brother, &quot;[I]t&#x27;s very good. Also I think it&#x27;s even more dramatic than [the] Spider-Man [comic strip]&quot;.

In 1980 and 1981, concurrent with the Hulk strip, Lieber contributed some degree of penciling on the daily and Sunday comic strip &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; until Fred Kida took over as regular penciler. Lieber then succeeded Kida on the daily strip in 1986. Lieber also penciled the Sunday page again from 1990 through at least 1995.

Lieber recalled in 2007,

In a 2010 interview Lieber described how he collaborated with Lee on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; strip: &quot;I get a full script. I can make certain changes, if I wish, and all that, but it&#x27;s a full script, which I welcome. ... I call him every week. I reduce the pencils and I fax them. I try to finish it, but sometimes I can&#x27;t, so he just sees roughs, but that is good enough for him to get the idea if I captured the scene right. Then he goes over it, and usually he will change things in the writing, and sometimes in the artwork. When he has made corrections, I have fortunately agreed with it.&quot; He retired from pencilling the strip in July 2018. His final strip ran September 8, 2018.

<doc id="853356" wikidata="Q369291" url="?curid=853356" title="Anglo-Spanish War (1654–1660)">
<text>The Anglo-Spanish War was a conflict between the English Protectorate and Spain between 1654 and 1660. It was driven by the economic and religious rivalry between the two countries, with each side attacking the other&#x27;s commercial and colonial interests in various ways, such as privateering and naval expeditions. 

In 1655, an English amphibious expedition invaded Spanish territory in the Caribbean, eventually capturing the island of Jamaica. In 1657, England formed an alliance with France, merging the Anglo-Spanish war with the larger Franco-Spanish War, with major land actions that took place in the Spanish Netherlands.

Although the war was terminated after The Restoration of King Charles II of England in 1660, tensions in the Caribbean with regards to the English possession of Jamaica kept the conflict going intermittently for over ten years. This included raids on Spanish territory by notable Privateer Henry Morgan. The war officially ended with two peace treaties, which were signed at Madrid in 1667 and 1670.

==Background==
When the First Anglo-Dutch War came to an end, Cromwell turned his attention to the conflict between France and Spain, both traditional rivals of England. France and Spain were both of the Roman Catholic faith, anathema to Cromwell, who believed it is God&#x27;s will that Protestantism should prevail in Europe. However, he considered Spain to be the greater threat to the Protestant cause, and thus pragmatically allied his nation with France. By going to war with Spain, he also sought a return to a policy of commercial opportunism pursued in the days of Elizabeth I and subsequently abandoned by her Stuart successors. Cromwell&#x27;s attack on Spanish trade and treasure routes immediately recalled the exploits of Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh; and it is not by accident that printed accounts of their activities began to circulate in England at this time. There was, however, one important difference: alongside silver and gold a new treasure was becoming ever more important – sugar. This meant occupation of territory, a step beyond the piracy pursued in Elizabethan days.

During the first year of the Protectorate, Cromwell conducted negotiations with the French statesman Cardinal Mazarin, resulting in the drafting of an Anglo-French alliance against Spain in October 1655. The alliance had an added benefit: France, which was currently offering refuge to the Stuarts, would now be disinclined to assist them in reclaiming the English throne.

==War==
=== Western Design ===


Meanwhile, Cromwell had already launched the Western Design against Spain&#x27;s colonies in the Spanish West Indies. The fleet left Portsmouth in late December 1654 and arrived in the West Indies in January. In May 1655, an English amphibious expedition led by General at Sea William Penn, father of the founder of Pennsylvania, and General Robert Venables invaded Spanish territory in the West Indies with the objective of capturing Hispaniola. It was one of the strongest ever to sail from England, with some 3,000 marines under the command of General Robert Venables, further reinforced in Barbados, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis.

Although Cromwell had previously been interested in the possible acquisition of Hispaniola island, the expedition&#x27;s commanders were given the freedom to determine their own priorities in the circumstances they faced on arrival. Several options were considered, including a landing on the coast of Guatemala or on Cuba. Both were discounted, as Penn and Venables decided to attempt to repeat Drake&#x27;s attack on Santo Domingo on Hispaniola. However, the 1655 Siege of Santo Domingo failed because the Spanish had improved their defences in the face of Dutch attacks earlier in the century. Cromwell, on the other hand, saw the Hispaniola defeat as God&#x27;s judgement. Despite various subsequent successes, the defeat made the whole operation against the Spanish West Indies a general failure. Venables and Penn were imprisoned therefore in the Tower of London on their arrival on England.

Jamaica was the &quot;casus belli&quot; that resulted in the actual Anglo-Spanish War in 1655. Weakened by fever, the English force then sailed west for the Colony of Santiago (present-day Jamaica), the only Spanish West Indies island that did not have new defensive works. They landed in May 1655 at a place called Santiago de la Vega, now Spanish Town. They came, and they stayed, in the face of prolonged local resistance that was reinforced by troops sent from Spain and New Spain (México). In 1657 the English Governor invited the Buccaneers to base themselves at Port Royal on Santiago, to deter the Spanish from recapturing the island. For England, Jamaica was to be the &quot;dagger pointed at the heart of the Spanish Empire&quot;, although in fact it was a possession of little value then. Cromwell, despite all difficulties, was determined that the presence should remain, sending reinforcements and supplies. New Spanish troops, sailing from Cuba, lost the Battle of Ocho Rios in 1657 and the Battle of Rio Nuevo in 1658, failing in their attempts to retake Jamaica. Nevertheless, the fear of another invasion meant that the English Governor of Jamaica Edward D&#x27;Oyley felt his new duty was to organize the defence of the island against the Spanish. By using the tactic of attacking instead of defending, he sent out Christopher Myngs to raid Spanish colonial cities and bases. Tolú and Santa Marta were among them in 1658 and the following year Cumana, Puerto Caballos and Coro were plundered and devastated and Myngs returned to Jamaica with a vast amount of plunder and treasure.

===Naval war===

In April 1656 English Admiral Robert Blake with a fleet of around forty warships, fireships and supply vessels sailed to blockade the Spanish port of Cadiz which continued throughout the summer. The Spanish remained on the defensive and took no aggressive action against the English fleet. In mid-June, Captain Edward Blagg sailed with eight ships to raid ports in northern Spain. On 24 June, Blagg raided Vigo, where a number of ships in the harbour were destroyed. While Blake replenished his water supplies on the African coast, a detachment of five frigates under a Captain Smith raided Malaga in southern Spain on 19 July. Smith sank nine Spanish ships, spiked the harbour guns and bombarded the town. A similar raid on Alicante was unsuccessful, but the threat of attack disrupted trade all along the coasts of Spain. On the evening of 8 September, one of Blake&#x27;s captains, Richard Stayner, intercepted a Spanish treasure fleet and captured or sank all but two of its ships. The loss of the cargoes of the ships captured or sunk by the English was a serious blow to the economy of Spain with an estimated loss of £2,000,000. For the first time in naval history, Blake kept the fleet at sea throughout an entire winter in order to maintain the blockade against Spain.

In February 1657, Blake received intelligence that the plate fleet from New Spain was on its way across the Atlantic. Leaving two ships to watch Cadiz, Blake sailed from there to attack the plate fleet, which had docked at Santa Cruz on Tenerife in the Canary Islands to await an escort to Spain. In April in the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Blake completely destroyed the Spanish merchant convoy—the West Indian Fleet—however, the fleet had landed the bullion before the battle. Blake was unable to seize it, but it was also unavailable to the government in Madrid.

The short-term effect of Blake&#x27;s blockade of Spain and his victory at Santa Cruz was the disruption of the Spanish economy, which depended upon silver and gold from the Americas and thereby damaged Spain&#x27;s capacity for waging war. The English lost 1,500 to 2,000 merchant ships to Spanish privateers and instead of using captured English ships to replace their destroyed convoys, the Spanish government placed the care of Spanish trade in the hands of neutral Dutch merchantmen.

===Flanders===
An Anglo-French alliance against Spain was established when the Treaty of Paris was signed in March 1657. Based on the terms of the treaty, the English would join with France in her continuing war against Spain in Flanders. France would contribute an army of 20,000 men, England would contribute both 6,000 troops and the English fleet in a campaign against the Flemish coastal fortresses of Gravelines, Dunkirk and Mardyck. It was agreed that Gravelines would be ceded to France, Dunkirk and Mardyck to England. Dunkirk, in particular, was on the Commonwealth&#x27;s mind mainly because of the privateers that were causing damage to the mercantile fleet. For Cromwell and the Commonwealth, the question of possession of Dunkirk thus passed from regional diplomatic possibility to urgent political necessity.
The combined Anglo-French army for the invasion of Flanders was commanded by the great French Marshal Turenne. The Spanish Army of Flanders was commanded by Don Juan-José, an illegitimate son of the Spanish King Philip. The Spanish army of 15,000 troops was augmented by a force of 3,000 English Royalists—formed as the nucleus of potential army for the invasion of England by Charles II, with Charles&#x27;s brother James, Duke of York, among its commanders.

The Commonwealth fleet blockaded Flemish ports but, to Cromwell&#x27;s annoyance, the military campaign started late in the year and was subject to many delays. Marshal Turenne spent the summer of 1657 campaigning against the Spanish in Luxembourg and made no move to attack Flanders until September. Mardyck was captured on 22 September and garrisoned by Commonwealth troops. Dunkirk was besieged in May 1658. A Spanish relief force attempted to lift the siege but was defeated on 4 June at the Battle of the Dunes. The Commonwealth contingent in Turenne&#x27;s army fought with distinction and impressed their French allies with a successful assault up a strongly defended sandhill 150 feet high during the battle. When Dunkirk surrendered to Turenne on 14 June, Cardinal Mazarin honoured the terms of the treaty with Cromwell and handed the port over to the Commonwealth, despite the protests of Louis XIV. The Commonwealth also honoured its obligations in respecting the rights of the Catholic populations of Mardyck and Dunkirk. A contingent of Commonwealth troops remained with Turenne&#x27;s army and were instrumental in the capture of Gravelines and other Flemish towns by the French. With the privateering threat of Dunkirk out of the way, England&#x27;s mercantile fleet suffered far fewer losses; not only because the Dunkirkers had lost their largest base but also because English trade had already been largely lost to the Dutch as a result of Dunkirker privateering.

===Restoration===
The war between France and Spain ended with the signing of the Peace of the Pyrenees on 28 October 1659. Cromwell&#x27;s death in 1658 left England in political turmoil that would result in the return of the Stuarts to the throne of England. After the Restoration of Charles II, the Anglo-Spanish War was formally terminated in September 1660 but no treaty was signed between the two nations. Charles had been allied to Spain through the Treaty of Brussels.

==Aftermath==

England and Spain had both suffered heavy economic losses; the latter suffered mainly from Blake&#x27;s blockade of Cadiz. The effect of this, particularly with the action off Cadiz and at Santa Cruz, was the disruption of the Spanish economy, which depended upon silver and gold from the Americas. This added to the difficulties of Philip&#x27;s IV&#x27;s overstretched armies, who for years had been campaigning simultaneously in Italy, the Pyrenees, Flanders and Portugal. The Spanish answered with a privateering campaign that all but wiped out English shipping trade. Consequently, the Dutch enjoyed a recovery from the losses they had suffered in the first Anglo-Dutch war and took much trade from the English. Nevertheless, with the victory of the first Anglo-Dutch war and the successes in the war against Spain, England had done enough to establish itself as one of Europe&#x27;s leading naval powers.

Spain demanded the return of possessions taken by Cromwell&#x27;s republic, to which Charles had been willing to agree. This soon changed however as Charles had become frustrated with Philip&#x27;s failure to aid in his restoration. Only a week after war had ended Charles annulled the Brussels treaty and allowed English parliament to annex England&#x27;s holdings (Jamaica, Dunkirk and Mardyck) despite Spanish protests. At the same time Charles sought a treaty with Spain so that England&#x27;s holdings could be recognised but the terms for Spain were too harsh and there was hope that the latter would recapture Jamaica in a military campaign. In order to increase his finances Charles sold Dunkirk to Louis XIV of France in November 1662 – though less than £300,000 of the promised half million was ever paid.

===Anglo-Portuguese alliance===
In 1662, Charles made a dynastic marriage with Catharine of Braganza; Tangier and Bombay were ceded to the British Crown and a military alliance was agreed to help Portugal who had been fighting to regain her independence since 1640. British troops under Frederick Schomberg were raised to serve to help fight the Spanish. Within a year the Spanish army attempted to overrun Portugal but at the crucial battle of Ameixial the Portuguese and British inflicted a crushing defeat.

In 1664 England through Sir Richard Fanshawe sought to adjust a peace between the Portuguese and Spanish crowns and then between England and Spain but to no avail. At the Battle of Montes Claros a year later another Spanish invasion was decisively defeated so much so that it ended major combat operations during the war which definitively secured Portuguese independence from Spain.

===Caribbean privateers===

The war&#x27;s Caribbean component raged on much longer. With Jamaica annexed the purpose of the &quot;Western Design&quot; (although failed in its primary objective of capturing the island of Hispaniola) survived the Protectorate itself, later to be revived in the raids ordered under the behest of the Jamaican governor Thomas Modyford. Modyford&#x27;s pretexts for licensing the buccaneers was his suspicion that Jamaica would never be secure until the Spanish government acknowledged England&#x27;s possession of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands and having it named in a treaty. The resulting privateer raids on the Spanish Main over the next ten years were devastating. Christopher Myngs raided Santiago de Cuba in 1662 and Campeche the following year. Henry Morgan later took over - his most notable attacks were at Puerto del Príncipe and at Porto bello, both in 1668 and the defeat of a Spanish squadron on Lake Maracaibo the following year. The Spanish meanwhile could do little to protect themselves.

In response Mariana, the Queen Regent of Spain, issued letters of marque for privateer attacks on English shipping in the Caribbean. One of these privateers was the famed Portuguese pirate Manuel Ribeiro Pardal. Charles II ordered the same – so Modyford commissioned Morgan once again to raid the Spanish main in order to preserve Jamaica once and for all. In December 1670 Morgan seized the islands of Old Providence and Santa Catalina forcing the garrisons to surrender. From there his fleet sailed to Chagres and seized the fort there too – Morgan hoped to cross the Isthmus of Panama but at this time he was unaware of events in Europe.

===Madrid treaties===
Spain during this time was politically, economically and militarily weakened by the decades of war and infighting. Charles II saw ideal opportunities for two eventual peace treaties signed at Madrid, both of which were favourable to England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davenport/Paulin98&quot;&gt;Davenport &amp; Paulin pp. 98–99, 188–89&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly the 1667 treaty was received with great satisfaction by English statesmen and merchants in terms of trade. With Portugal&#x27;s restoration secure the British Brigade was subsequently disbanded but England&#x27;s holdings in the Caribbean were left unsettled. Nevertheless, it was a big step for peace between the two kingdoms.

Three years later at the next Madrid treaty, Spain finally ceded Jamaica and the Cayman Islands to Britain which was a major concession and a humiliation for Spain. English ships were also able to roam the Caribbean Sea without hindrance and for the first time were not seen in the West Indies as intruders or as pirates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisher/Savelle66&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Controversially the news did not arrive in time to prevent Henry Morgan&#x27;s Panama expedition from plundering and burning Panama in 1671. Despite Spanish protests and his arrest, Morgan went unpunished claiming he had not known about the treaty.

England and Spain would be allies during the next large European conflict the War of the Grand Alliance and would remain largely at peace until 1702 with the outbreak of the Spanish Succession War.

<text>Bowen Hills railway station is located on the North Coast line in Queensland, Australia. It serves the Brisbane suburb of Bowen Hills. North of the station, the Ferny Grove line branches off. The station is one of four inner city stations that form a core corridor through the centre of Brisbane.

==History==
There have been three railways stations named Bowen Hills. The first from 1882 to 1889 was near Campbell Street. In 1890, a new station opened at the south end of the Abbotsford Road tunnel. In 1971, to allow for the Mayne marshalling yards to be expanded, Bowen Hill and Mayne Junction stations were closed with a new Bowen Hills station opening in 1973.

As part of the quadruplication of the line from Roma Street station, Platforms 3 and 4 opened on 11 June 1996.

===Accidents===
In October 1904, Archibald Kerr, a 16-year-old boy, fell from a moving train near Bowen Hills station; the boy died from the injury to the back of his head caused by the fall. At the time, the train driver was not aware of the event until he was told about it by the signalman on the train&#x27;s return journey at Brunswick Street station. The train gate was blamed as the cause of the accident at first, but after the gate was found to be in working order, the cause of the accident wasn&#x27;t known.

==Services==
Bowen Hills station is served by Airport, Beenleigh, Caboolture, Doomben, Ferny Grove, Redcliffe Peninsula, Shorncliffe, Springfield and Sunshine Coast line services. Also see Inner City timetable It is adjacent to the Mayne Stabling Yards, with many services terminating here.

<text>So Much Water So Close to Home is an album by Australian rock band Paul Kelly and the Messengers and was originally released in August 1989. The title comes from a short story of the same name by author Raymond Carver. Carver died in August 1988. Kelly co-wrote the score for the 2006 Australian film &quot;Jindabyne&quot;,
 which was also based on the same story. The entire album was recorded in the U.S. with producer Scott Litt, best known for his work with R.E.M. It was released on Mushroom/White Records in Australia &amp; New Zealand and A&amp;M Records for the rest of the world. The album peaked at #10 on the ARIA album charts, but none of its singles, &quot;Sweet Guy&quot;, &quot;Careless&quot; and &quot;Most Wanted Man in the World&quot; had any Top 40 chart success. All tracks for the album were written by Kelly, who provided vocals, guitar and harmonica and also co-produced with Litt.

==Background==
Paul Kelly had formed Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls in 1985, named for a group mentioned by Lou Reed in &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;. For international releases from 1987 on, they used the name Paul Kelly and the Messengers to avoid possible racist interpretations. They released &quot;Gossip&quot; in 1986 on Mushroom Records in Australia and in 1987 on A&amp;M Records for international release. &quot;Under the Sun&quot; was released in 1987 in Australia and in 1988 internationally.

Their next album, &quot;So Much Water So Close to Home&quot; was released in 1989 as by Paul Kelly and the Messengers in all markets. It peaked at #10 on the ARIA album charts, but none of its singles reached the ARIA Top 40 Singles charts. The entire album was recorded in the U.S. with producer Scott Litt, best known for his work with R.E.M. Litt had re-mixed some of Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls&#x27; tracks from &quot;Gossip&quot; for its US release as by Paul Kelly and the Messengers. &quot;So Much Water So Close to Home&quot; was released on Mushroom/White Records in Australia and A&amp;M Records in the United States and Europe in 1989.

The title comes from a 1975 short story of the same name by author Raymond Carver (later collected in &quot;What We Talk About When We Talk About Love&quot;). Album track, &quot;Everything&#x27;s Turning to White&quot; is based on Carver&#x27;s short story, it describes the tale of recreational fishermen who find a dead woman&#x27;s body but continue their trip for three days before reporting their discovery to police. Kelly would go on to co-write the score for the 2006 Australian film &quot;Jindabyne&quot;, which was also based on the same story. In 1991 Paul Kelly and the Messengers released their next album &quot;Comedy&quot;.

<text>Inga Swenson (December 29, 1932 – July 23, 2023) was an American actress and singer. She appeared in multiple Broadway productions and was nominated twice for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performances as Lizzie Curry in &quot;110 in the Shade&quot; and Irene Adler in &quot;Baker Street&quot;. She also spent seven years portraying Gretchen Kraus in the ABC comedy series &quot;Benson&quot;.

==Early years==
Inga Swenson was born in Omaha, Nebraska, on December 29, 1932, the youngest of three children of Geneva Pauline ( Seeger) and Axel Carl Richard &quot;A.C.R.&quot; Swenson. Her father died in a car accident when she was 15.

Swenson graduated from Omaha Central High School in 1950. While attending OCHS, as a junior, Swenson won the state title in the National Forensic League&#x27;s speech contest and later, she won the NFL&#x27;s national contest. As a high school senior she was considered the school&#x27;s best vocalist and she was also the president of the Central High Players. She studied drama at Northwestern University under Alvina Krause, among others.

== Career ==
Early in her career, Swenson had supporting roles in the films &quot;Advise &amp; Consent&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; (1962) in which she played Helen Keller&#x27;s mother. Swenson was a trained lyric soprano and starred on Broadway in &quot;New Faces&quot; (c. 1956), and &quot;The First Gentleman&quot; (1959), receiving Tony Award nominations for Best Actress in a Musical for her performances in &quot;110 in the Shade&quot; (1964) and &quot;Baker Street&quot; (1965). A life member of The Actors Studio, she said that her favorite role was Lizzie Currie in the musical &quot;110 in the Shade&quot;.

Swenson appeared in two episodes of &quot;Bonanza&quot;: &quot;Inger, My Love&quot; (1962) and &quot;Journey Remembered&quot; (1963) as Hoss&#x27;s mother. She portrayed Gretchen Kraus, the autocratic and acerbic German cook (later head housekeeper and budget director) in the TV sitcom &quot;Benson&quot;. Gretchen&#x27;s catchphrase was, &quot;I hear you!&quot; and known for childhood stories, starting with, &quot;When I was a little girl in Bavaria...&quot; Her portrayal garnered three Emmy nominations. She was cast after having appeared in a multi-episode stint as the conniving revenge-seeking Ingrid Svenson, the Swedish birth mother of Corinne Tate (Diana Canova), on the TV sitcom &quot;Soap&quot;. (&quot;Benson&quot; was a spinoff of &quot;Soap&quot; and shared the same producers.) She also appeared as Northern matriarch Maude Hazard in the mini-series &quot;North and South&quot; in 1985 and again in 1986.

Swenson retired from acting in 1998.

==Personal life and death==
Swenson married actor/singer Lowell Harris in 1953, and the couple had two sons: Mark and James. James died in a motorcycle accident in 1987, at the age of 26. Mark is retired from the motion picture and television film editing field and the financial services industry.

Swenson died in Los Angeles on July 23, 2023, at the age of 90.

<text>The America was a Spanish automobile manufactured in Barcelona from 1917 to 1922. The four-cylinder &quot;valveless&quot; model, the &quot;Tipo A&quot;, had a primitive synchromesh gearbox and worm final drive. The firm&#x27;s main product was the 1097cc &quot;Tipo B&quot;; the &quot;Tipo C&quot; was an ohv racing model.

== History ==
The general director and technical director of América Autos was engineer Manuel Pazos. One of his early designs was an elastic wheel intended to replace the inner tube tire, though the invention did not gain much acceptance due to technical issues. Another of his designs was a type of engine distribution system in which valves were replaced by what he called &quot;rotary conical distributors.&quot; The general representation of the company was entrusted to Arcadi de Bobes, who had a showroom at 30 Balmes Street, where he also sold French Hurtu cars and British Dennis trucks.

In 1917, the company introduced its first model under the &quot;América&quot; brand, the Tipo A, equipped with a four-cylinder engine. The model featured several innovations, including the aforementioned distribution system, a proprietary synchronized carburetor and gearbox (the first built in Spain), a pressurized lubrication system, and an original patented leaf spring and suspension system. The elastic wheel was offered as an option (the car came with conventional wheels as standard). Despite these innovations, the Tipo A was not commercially successful.

The failure of the Tipo A forced the company to reconsider its business strategy, and in 1919 it introduced the Tipo B, a small conventional car with a body designed by industrial coachbuilder Alfons Lucas, who had workshops at 345 Còrsega Street in Barcelona. The Tipo B was presented at the 1919 Barcelona Auto Show, where it received a favorable reception.

In 1921, the Tipo C was introduced, based on the B and intended for competition, but only one unit was ever produced. The bodywork was also crafted by Alfons Lucas. Finally, in 1922, the factory closed its doors.

<doc id="853379" wikidata="Q7233617" url="?curid=853379" title="Post (Paul Kelly album)">
<text>Post is the first solo album by Australian singer-songwriter rock musician, Paul Kelly. Kelly had moved to Sydney by January 1985, after leaving his Melbourne-based Paul Kelly Band and the breakup of his marriage to Hilary Brown.

The album was produced by Clive Shakespeare (Sherbet guitarist) and Kelly, and was released in May 1985 by the independent White Records label, leased to Mushroom Records. The album failed to chart in Australia, with only one single, &quot;From St Kilda to Kings Cross&quot;, released in April which also failed to chart. The name of the album, &quot;Post&quot; relates to both being &#x27;after&#x27; significant changes in Kelly&#x27;s life and to the sense of a &#x27;signpost&#x27; to future directions. Kelly dedicated the album to Paul Hewson, keyboardist and songwriter for New Zealand/Australian band Dragon who had died of a heroin overdose in January. Kelly has described &quot;Post&quot; as a concept album dealing with addictions – not necessarily heroin addiction – but various forms, he has also denied that the songs were autobiographical but that he wrote about the world around him.

==Background==

Paul Kelly and the Dots, had released two albums in the early 1980s, &quot;Talk&quot; and &quot;Manila&quot;, but they had little chart success. Kelly had become involved with the Melbourne drug culture, the Dots disbanded in 1982 after numerous line-up changes and Kelly formed the Paul Kelly Band. Kelly&#x27;s first marriage, to Hilary Brown, had broken up in late 1984; likewise the Paul Kelly Band had ended too. Kelly had moved to Sydney by January 1985, where he recorded &quot;Post&quot; in the studio of Sherbet guitarist Clive Shakespeare. It was self-funded (at a cost of $3,500), with Michael Barclay on drums and guitarist Steve Connolly (The Zimmerman), guest performers on the album included bass player Ian Rilen (Rose Tattoo, X), Peter Bull (Flaming Hands, Grooveyard) on keyboards and guitarist Graham Lee. They spent two weeks recording at Clive Shakespeare&#x27;s studio, Shakespeare engineered the album and co-produced with Kelly, it was released in May 1985 on the independent label White Label Records, and licensed to Mushroom Records.

The term &#x27;post&#x27; has a few layers of meaning for Kelly in this album, i.e. post Kelly&#x27;s childhood and youth in Adelaide, post his life in Melbourne, particularly post his involvement with the Melbourne drug culture, post the death of his musician friend, Paul Hewson. Kelly dedicated the album to Hewson, who was a keyboard player and songwriter for the Australian/New Zealand band, Dragon, he died of a heroin overdose in January 1985. &#x27;Post&#x27; also relates to a marker or &#x27;signpost&#x27;, pointing to a new direction, and even a way to &#x27;post&#x27; his account of the world. Kelly has described &quot;Post&quot; as a concept album dealing with addictions – not necessarily heroin addiction – but various forms, he has also denied that the songs were autobiographical but that he wrote about the world around him. The album was re-released in 1990 as one of Mushroom&#x27;s Midprice Masters and was re-released again in 2006 by Mushroom.

==Reception==

According to Australian rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, &quot;Post&quot; is a stark, personal collection of acoustic songs that highlight Kelly&#x27;s broadly based song writing skill. Australian &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine hailed &quot;Post&quot; as the best record of 1985. Both the album and the one single released from it, &quot;From St Kilda to Kings Cross&quot;, failed to chart. The album is thought by some critics to be more of a demo recording, as four tracks were re-recorded by Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls for their debut album &quot;Gossip&quot; in 1986. However, according to others it is like Bruce Springsteen’s &quot;Nebraska&quot;, where there is a beauty and delicateness in this raw production, with the emphasis on the words, the melodies, the song structures that are the defining elements of Kelly as a songwriter.
