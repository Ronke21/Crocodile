<text>Royal Air Force Lakenheath or RAF Lakenheath is a Royal Air Force station near the village of Lakenheath in Suffolk, England, UK, north-east of Mildenhall and west of Thetford. The installation&#x27;s perimeter borders Brandon.

Despite being an RAF station, Lakenheath currently only hosts United States Air Force (USAF) units and military personnel. The host wing is the 48th Fighter Wing (48 FW), also known as the Liberty Wing, assigned to United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA). The wing operates the F-15E Strike Eagle and the F-35A Lightning II.

==History==

===First World War===
The first use of Lakenheath Warren as a Royal Flying Corps airfield was during the First World War, when the area was made into a bombing and ground-attack range for aircraft flying from RFC Feltwell and RFC Thetford.

===Second World War===
In 1940, the Air Ministry selected Lakenheath as an alternative for nearby RAF Mildenhall and used it as a decoy airfield. Surfaced runways were constructed in 1941, with the main runway being , and the two subsidiary runways at .

In late 1941, Lakenheath was used by RAF flying units on detachment. The station soon functioned as a Mildenhall satellite base with Short Stirling bombers of No. 149 Squadron dispersed from the parent airfield as conditions allowed. The squadron exchanged its Vickers Wellingtons for Stirlings late in November 1941. After becoming fully operational with its new aircraft, the squadron moved into Lakenheath on 6 April 1942 and remained until mid 1944 when the squadron moved the short distance to RAF Methwold, just inside Norfolk. 

One Stirling pilot, Flight Sergeant Rawdon Middleton, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for valour on the night of 28–29 November 1942, when despite serious face wounds and loss of blood from shell-fire during a raid on the Fiat works at Turin in Italy, he brought the damaged aircraft back towards southern England. With fuel nearly exhausted his crew were ordered to bail out.

On 21 June 1943, newly re-formed No. 199 Squadron re-located to RAF Lakenheath as a second Stirling squadron. It conducted mine laying operations at sea before moving to RAF North Creake in Norfolk on 1 May 1944. No. 149 Squadron ended its association with RAF Lakenheath the same month, taking its Stirlings to RAF Methwold. The reason for the departure of the two bomber squadrons was Lakenheath&#x27;s selection for upgrading to a Very Heavy Bomber airfield, which left the airfield closed to aircraft until April 1947.

====Strategic Air Command====
Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union in Europe began as early as 1946. In November, President Harry S. Truman ordered Strategic Air Command (SAC) B-29 Superfortress bombers to Europe. Truman decided to realign United States Air Force Europe (USAFE) into a permanent combat-capable force. In July 1948, B-29s of the SAC 2nd Bombardment Group were deployed to Lakenheath. The first USAFE host unit at Lakenheath was the 7504th Base Completion Squadron, being activated in 1949. 

Amongst other units present were 3913 Air Base Sqdn (1953-55, Lt Col Archie Thomas), 3910 Installation Sqdn (1955-59, Maj John F Thomas), and 3910 Air Base Group (1955-59, Col L M Thomas).
On 30 April 1956, two Lockheed U-2s were airlifted to Lakenheath to form CIA Detachment A. The first flight of the U-2 was on 21 May. The Central Intelligence Agency unit did not remain long, moving to Wiesbaden Air Base, West Germany in June 1956.

On 10 October 1956, a United States Navy Douglas R6D-1 Liftmaster disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean after departure from RAF Lakenheath for a flight to Lajes Field in the Azores. The aircraft was on a Military Air Transport Service flight carrying 50 members of the 307th Bombardment Wing, on their way home to the United States after a temporary duty assignment and a U.S. Navy crew of nine. All 59 personnel on board were lost.

==== 48th Tactical Fighter Wing ====
Following French president Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s insistence in 1959 that all non-French nuclear-capable forces should be withdrawn from his country, the USAF began a redeployment of its North American F-100-equipped units from France. The 48th Fighter Wing left its base at Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base, France on 15 January 1960, its aircraft arriving at Lakenheath that afternoon.

The tactical components of the 48th TFW upon arrival at Lakenheath were:

*492d Tactical Fighter Squadron (blue colours, later assigned tailcode &#x27;LR&#x27;)
*493d Tactical Fighter Squadron (yellow colours, later assigned tailcode &#x27;LS&#x27;)
*494th Tactical Fighter Squadron (red colours, later assigned tailcode &#x27;LT&#x27;)

The bare metal finish and bright squadron markings were replaced with dull green-based camouflage and no squadron markings around 1966-67, but by 1970 subdued individual squadron markings had returned e.g. blue fin tip and white &#x27;LR&#x27; tailcode denoting 492d TFS.

Beginning in late 1971, the 48th TFW started its conversion to the McDonnell Douglas F-4D Phantom II, receiving aircraft that had previously served in Vietnam, with all squadrons now marked with the new &#x27;LN&#x27; tailcode. However, the delivery of F-4s was intermittent, and working up to full strength (73 aircraft) took 2½ years. Consequently the wing only resumed its full NATO and USAFE commitments on 1st July 1975. However the F-4&#x27;s service with the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing was short, as operation &quot;Ready Switch&quot; resulted in 48th Tactical Fighter Wing receiving General Dynamics F-111s in June 1977.

==== African-American Servicemembers during the Cold War ====
After the US desegregated the military in 1948, a little community of mixed-race children, whose mothers were British and whose fathers were black American servicemembers based at Lakenheath, formed in Norwich.

Vanessa Baird, whose father was a black GI based in Lakenheath airfield and whose mother was a Liverpudlian, was born in April 1958. Her father did not know about the birth. Her mother&#x27;s family was very disapproving after they found out. So Vanessa and her mother went to Norwich. There, according to Baird, some of the women married black GIs and went to the US with them.

Elaine Brown had a similar experience to Vanessa. Her mother met black GI Harold Grigsby when he was based at Lakenheath in the early 1950s. Her father was sent back to the US before Elaine was born in 1953. Elaine&#x27;s mother told her her father&#x27;s name and that he was from Washington DC. In 1996 with her husband Elaine finally found her father and met her American family.

=== Strike Eagle, 1992–2014 ===

Lakenheath received its first McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagles in 1992. On 16 December 1992, the last F-111 departed the base. Along with its departure, the 493d FS was inactivated, but then reactivated as an F-15 Eagle squadron.

On 2 March 2011, members of the 48th Security Forces Squadron were involved in a shooting at Frankfurt Airport in Germany. The members were on a bus bound for Ramstein Air Base in Germany when they were attacked by a lone gunman.

On 22 March 2011, F-15E 91-0304 crash-landed and was destroyed in eastern Libya after reportedly suffering from a mechanical failure. Both crewmen ejected and were safely recovered. On 7 January 2014, a Sikorsky HH-60 Pave Hawk from the base crashed following a bird strike while on a low-level training exercise with another helicopter (also a Pave Hawk), into the Cley Marshes near Cley next the Sea on the nearby North Norfolk coast. All four occupants died in the crash.

On 8 October 2014, F-15D 86-0182 belonging to the 493rd Fighter Squadron crashed during a training flight in a field outside Spalding, Lincolnshire. The pilot successfully ejected and was shortly recovered back to Lakenheath on board a Pave Hawk.

A U.S. Marine Corps Boeing F/A-18 Hornet of VMFA-232 &quot;Red Devils&quot; from MCAS Miramar, California, crashed after taking off from RAF Lakenheath on 21 October 2015. The pilot, Major Taj &quot;Cabbie&quot; Sareen (34), did not survive.

In addition to supporting three combat-ready squadrons of fighter aircraft, the Liberty Wing housed the 56th Rescue Squadron&#x27;s HH-60G combat search and rescue helicopters. The 56th Rescue Squadron re-located to Aviano Air Base in 2018.

On 15 June 2020, an F-15C belonging to the 493d Fighter Squadron crashed during a training flight in the North Sea, 74 nautical miles east of Scarborough at about . The body of pilot 1st Lt. Kenneth Allen was found deceased.

=== F-35 ===
==== F-35A Lightning II ====
In January 2015, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that from 2020, Lakenheath would become home to 54 of the US Air Force&#x27;s Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II multi-role fighters. The aircraft would be split between two squadrons and there would be an increase of 1,200 military personnel and between 60 and 100 civilian workers at the station. The F-35 would operate alongside the two existing F-15E squadrons based at Lakenheath.

The 495th Fighter Squadron was reactivated on 1 October 2021 to be the first Lightning II squadron at Lakenheath, with the first aircraft arriving on 15 December 2021.

==== F-35 Infrastructure ====
In 2017, a F-35 campus was being constructed on the south side of the airfield to accommodate the new aircraft. As of 2018, the main new operational buildings being developed as part of the F-35 project were as follows: a two six-bay maintenance hangars – Space for service, maintenance, storage, and staff support facilities (to be known as Hangars 4-1 and 4–2), hangar 6 (Consolidated Parts Store) – Single-storey extension to the southern side of Hangar 6, including offices and warehouses and the storage of aircraft equipment and parts., a dual squadron operations/aircraft maintenance unit (a three-storey building to provide combined facilities for two squadrons comprising Squadron Operations and Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) facilities, including mission planning, administration space in the operations section and offices to manage the maintenance of aircraft and storage space), a corrosion control and wash rack facility – Comprising single-storey hangar to maintain aircraft including a paint and sanding booth and wash rack, a Flight simulator facility ( a single-storey building to accommodate six F-35A flight simulators, administration, records, classrooms, brief/debrief rooms, and storage space, a field training detachment facility (a three-storey building to provide F-35A maintenance, including classrooms and administration rooms), aircraft ground equipment facilities (a single storey building extension and new covered storage associated with an existing building used for maintenance), a fuel system maintenance dock (a single storey hangar with fuel system maintenance dock), a munitions maintenance facility (a single storey building extension and new covered storage to an existing building for the maintenance of munitions), residential accommodation (a three or four-storey dormitory for up to 144 beds), a dining facility, a munitions storage administration maintenance building, a hospital up to four storeys to provide inpatient services, outpatient and speciality care clinics, ancillary services, support and medical administrative functions and a high school to house about 560 students.

The airfield operational surfaces were also being expanded as follows: Charlie Apron, used by F-15s was to be redeveloped and extended to allow the parking of up to forty-two F-35A aircraft in dual-occupancy shelters constructed from a light weight, canopy structure with open sides to a total area of Charlie Apron of about 78,392 square metres, combining the retained area of 58,780 square metres with the new area of 19,612 square metres. It was to be connected to maintenance hangars 4-1 and 4-2 and the squadron operations/AMU building. Alpha-Bravo Apron was to be extended to accommodate existing F-15 aircraft using Charlie Apron to an area of about 54,179 square metres, combining the retained area of 39,750 square metres with the new area of 14,429 square metres, to accommodate up to thirty-eight F-15 aircraft on the open apron which would not feature any shelters.

==== Infrastructure delivery ====
Investment of $148.4 million (£116.7M) for the delivery of F-35A infrastructure at Lakenheath was authorised by the US administration in August 2018.

In November 2018, the Defence Infrastructure Organisation awarded a £160M contract for infrastructure work to a joint venture between Kier Group and VolkerFitzpatrick.

To make way for the F-35 Campus, demolition of the first of eighteen buildings began in March 2019. The work on Alpha-Bravo Apron was completed in August 2020, allowing F-15E Strike Eagle operations of the 492nd and 494th Fighter Squadrons to be consolidated on one ramp.

==== Drone incidents ====

In 2024, between 20 November and 22 November, small unmanned aerial systems (UASs) were spotted in the vicinity of and over RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, and RAF Feltwell. The number of UASs fluctuated and they ranged in size and configuration. F-15E Strike Eagles, based at Lakenheath, were allegedly scrambled in response to the drones as they impacted local flight operations. RAF Regiment personnel were later deployed to the bases with the ORCUS C-UAS system in response to a second sighting of unidentified drones in the night hours of 25 November.

The base also has 1,500 British and US civilian staff, that serve the base at the site.

==Nuclear weapons==
Although never officially confirmed, US nuclear weapons were based at Lakenheath from the first deployment of SAC aircraft to the base in the 1950s until the 1990s. As of 2024, no US nuclear weapons are known to be based in the UK. In February 2024, US documents detailing the awarding of contracts to build new storage facilities for nuclear cores stimulated public discussion in East Anglia that nuclear weapons may be redeployed to Lakenheath in the near future.

== Heritage ==

=== Gate guardian ===
RAF Lakenheath&#x27;s gate guardian is North American F-100D Super Sabre, serial number &quot;&#x27;54-2269&#x27;.&quot; The aircraft was originally delivered to the French Air Force. On return it was moved to the &quot;Wings of Liberty Memorial Park&quot; at RAF Lakenheath. Firstly it was painted as &quot;&#x27;55-4048&#x27;&quot;, latterly as &quot;&#x27;56-3319&#x27;&quot;.

==Protests==

Since the base&#x27;s founding, RAF Lakenheath has been targeted for numerous peace protests from groups such as Stop the war coalition, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and Lakenheath Alliance for Peace.

===Pershing===
Lakenheath was one of the proposed sites of the NATO Pershing II Missile System. The deployment of the Missile system sparked protests all over Western Europe, and RAF Lakenheath was one of the most prominent military sites. The radical historian E.P. Thompson wrote in a pamphlet that basing the system at RAF Lakenheath directly endangered the lives of those in the nearby city of Cambridge:&quot;...Lakenheath is, by crow or cruise, just over twenty miles from Cambridge. It is possible that Cambridge but less probable that Oxford will fall outside the CEP. Within the CEP we must suppose some fifteen or twenty detonations at least on the scale of Hiroshima, without taking into account any possible detonations, release of radio-active materials, etc., if the strike should succeed in finding out the cruise missiles at which it was aimed.&quot; A semi-permanent &#x27;peace camp&#x27; was set up outside RAF Lakenheath. In 1985, the future Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams was arrested for singing psalms at a CND protest at Lakenheath.

=== Libya ===
Over 1,000 people demonstrated outside RAF Lakenheath in protest at the 1986 United States bombing of Libya.
===Iraq war and later===
The 2003 invasion of Iraq sparked a new wave of peace protests. In one incident, 9 protestors gained access to the base by cutting through its perimeter fence. The protestors rode bicycles along the main runway, before chaining themselves together.

Activists later established a &#x27;peace camp&#x27; outside RAF Lakenheath to draw attention to the base.

In 2006, a group of 200 people protested against the alleged nuclear weapons stored at RAF Lakenheath. Addressing the crowd was Jeremy Corbyn, who cycled to RAF Lakenheath from the railway station in Ely. There were further protests on this issue in 2008.

<text>Sandanski ( ; , formerly known as Sveti Vrach, , until 1947) is a town and a recreation center in southwestern Bulgaria, part of Blagoevgrad Province. Named after the Macedonian Bulgarian revolutionary Yane Sandanski, it is situated in Sandanski–Petrich Valley at the foot of Pirin Mountains, along the banks of Sandanska Bistritsa River. Sandanski is about 20 km away from the Bulgaria-Greece border and 100 km away from the Aegean Sea.

The town has a convenient location, a mild to warm climate (with the highest average annual temperature in the country, +16°C) and relatively high concentration of thermal water springs, which all make it a popular destination for relaxation and recreation.

==Geography==
Sandanski is located in the Sandanski–Petrich Valley, surrounded by the Pirin, Belasitsa and Ograzhden mountain ranges. The town is about 160 km south from Bulgaria&#x27;s capital Sofia along the major European Route E79. Following the same route at almost the same distance is Thessaloniki, Greece&#x27;s second largest city.

Sandanski has developed in an amphitheatrical fashion on the outer south-west flanks of Pirin Mountains along the lower reaches of Sandanska Bistritsa River. The town&#x27;s altitude varies between 240 and 300 meters. Its geographical location between Kresna and Rupel Gorges determines the town&#x27;s mild winter and unpleasant summer temperatures. Statistically Sandanski has the warmest temperatures in Bulgaria with a total of around 2700 annual sunshine hours.

Within a short drive from Sandanski is Melnik, the smallest town in Bulgaria in terms of population, but an attractive tourist destination for its authentic architecture and wine production. In a close proximity are the village of Rozhen and Rozhen Monastery. The Ancient Roman city of Parthicopolis was located nearby.

===Climate===

Sandanski has a temperate climate (Köppen Climate Classification: Cfa). Summers are very hot and dry with occasional thunderstorms and during heat waves the temperature may exceed 40 °C reaching to 45 °C, the highest recorded temperature in the city. Winters are damp and relatively mild, lasting for about three months from December through February. Springs and falls are generally about two months each. The summer is the longest season in Sandanski, lasting 4 months – from early June to late September. Precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year except for July and August when droughts often occur.

<text>Road cycling is the most widespread form of cycling in which cyclists ride on paved roadways. It includes recreational, racing, commuting, and utility cycling. As users of the road, road cyclists are generally expected to obey the same laws as motorists, however there are certain exceptions. While there are many types of bicycles that are used on the roads such as BMX, recumbents, racing, touring and utility bicycles, dedicated road bicycles have specific characteristics that make them ideal for the sport. Road bicycles generally have thinner tires, lighter frames with no suspension, and a set of drop handle bars to allow riders to get in a more aerodynamic position while cycling at higher speeds. On a flat road, an intermediate cyclist can average about , while a professional rider can average up to . At higher speeds, wind resistance becomes an important factor; aerodynamic road bikes have been developed over the years to ensure that as much as possible of the rider&#x27;s energy is spent propelling the bike forward.

==History==
In 1817, Karl von Drais created the first bicycle which used heavy steel and wood, but since then, the road bicycle industry has adopted aluminum, carbon fiber, and titanium as the main materials for production. The first steel bicycles weighed as much as 80 pounds, whereas the lightest carbon fiber road bikes now can weigh as little as thirteen pounds.

On May 31, 1868, cycling officially became a sport with the first race occurring at Saint-Cloud Park in France. While this first race was not considered a road race, road cycling races began to pop up throughout Europe in the 1870s. Road cycling as a form of recreational activity as well as a way to commute began to gain traction shortly after these first road races. Since its origins, millions of people have adopted road cycling for either recreation or commuting.

In 2020, it was estimated that about 44.5 million people worldwide participate in road cycling, which is an increase of about five million people since 2019. Demand for road bicycles as well as other types of bicycles continued to increase throughout 2021.

== Riding safety ==

Sharing the roadways with other motorists is an unavoidable aspect of road cycling, so road cyclists are generally expected to follow the same laws as their motorist counterparts. That being said, road cyclists also have the same fundamental rights as motorists. In the U.S., laws for cyclists vary by state, so it is important to keep up to date on your state&#x27;s road cycling laws. You can find a breakdown of all cycling laws by state here.

=== Helmets ===

While laws on wearing helmets vary by jurisdiction in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, helmets significantly reduce the risk of serious injury and death in the event of an accident.
=== Crash prevention ===
In 2019, 846 cyclists were killed in road related accidents in the United States. Most fatal bike crashes were caused between 6 P.M. and 9 P.M. and about 78% of fatal crashes in 2019 were in urban areas.

Some tips for crash prevention are:

* Check to make sure that your brakes work.
* Wear reflective gear as much as possible.
* If you have shoe laces, make sure they are tied so they do not get caught in the drivetrain.
* Plan your route with caution.
* Use bike lanes as much as possible.
* Invest in a rear tail light.

== Road cycling industry ==
Some of the major companies within the road cycling industry are:

* Accell Group
* Atlas Cycles (Haryana) Ltd.
* Avon Cycles Ltd.
* Cervelo
* Dorel Sports
* Giant Bicycles
* Merida Industry Co., Ltd
* Pinarello
* Shimano
* SRAM

<doc id="856916" wikidata="Q191099" url="?curid=856916" title="Petrich">
<text>Petrich ( ) is a town in Blagoevgrad Province in southwestern Bulgaria, located in Sandanski–Petrich Valley at the foot of the Belasica Mountains in the Strumeshnitsa Valley. According to the 2021 census, the town has 26,778 inhabitants.

It is the seat of Petrich Municipality.

Petrich is located close to the borders with Greece and North Macedonia. The crossing into North Macedonia is known as Novo Selo-Petrich, as the first settlement across the border is Novo Selo.

Petrich Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named for Petrich.

==History==

Petrich was included in the territory of the Bulgarian State during the reign of Knyaz Boris I (r. 852–889). During the Middle Ages it was a Bulgarian fortress of importance during Tsar Samuil&#x27;s wars (r. 997–1014) with Byzantium. During Ottoman rule, it formed part of the Rumeli Eyalet, and in the 19th century became a &quot;kaza&quot; of the Sanjak of Serres in the Salonica Vilayet. From 19 January 1892, Petrich and its district were included in the Bulgarian Exarchate, before being included in Bulgaria following the Balkan Wars in 1912–13.

In October 1925 it was the site of a brief conflict between Greece and Bulgaria sometimes called the War of the Stray Dog.

=== Antiquity ===
Petrich is one of the old towns in the valley of the middle Struma. According to local historians, the present-day town of Petrich is the heir to the ancient Thracian settlement located at the southern foot of the Kozhuh hill. In this area, located 10 km northeast of the modern city, in the 4th century BC, a Thracian settlement of the Medi tribe emerged. In the 1st century BC. the Romans conquered the lands of the Medes and then the small settlement near Kozhuh became a well-fortified Roman city - a fortress that protected the middle reaches of the Struma and Rupel gorge. According to the interpretation of the Roman historian Titus Livy, it is assumed that this city was called Petra. Archaeological excavations show that it existed until the 6th century, when it was burned by the Slavs. It is assumed that the remaining living inhabitants left the burned town and settled at the foot of the nearby mountain Belasitsa, which marked the beginning of today&#x27;s town of Petrich, adding to the old name the Slavic ending &quot;-ich&quot;. 

Recent archaeological research and the location of the ancient city of Heraclea Sintica in the Kozhuh area prove that there is no continuity between this city, located in the lands of the Thracian Sinti tribe, and modern Petrich, but a hiatus of several centuries. The earliest settlements on the site of the city appear only in the X - XI century. Petrich was formed as a significant settlement and regional center only at the end of the XII - XIV century.

=== The Middle Ages ===

The Petrich region was annexed to the Bulgarian state in 837 as a result of the war of the Bulgarian Khan Presian against Byzantium. At the end of the 10th and the beginning of the 11th century, the lands around Petrich occupied an important military-strategic place in Samuel&#x27;s state. In 1014, not far from today&#x27;s town, in the so-called Kleidion gorge, a decisive battle took place between the Bulgarian troops led by Tsar Samuel and the troops of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II. The ruins of Samuel&#x27;s fortress still remind of the blinding of the captured 14,000 Bulgarian soldiers. For this act the Byzantine emperor Basil II received the nickname &quot;the Bulgar Slayer&quot;.

During the period XII - XIV century Petrich became a strong fortress - part of the fortification system in southwestern Bulgaria. This is evidenced by the remains of the medieval fortress Gyaur Kalesi, around which the city originally arose. At least in the XIII - XIV century the city consists of two parts - a fortress, i.e. fortified city core and unfortified outer city, but with entrance-exit arteries guarded by towers.

Petrich was first mentioned in written sources in the deeds of the Serbian magnates Jovan Dragaš and Konstantin Dragaš, who in 1376 - 1377 donated local properties to the Russian monastery &quot;St. Pantaleimon&quot; in Mount Athos.
The town fell under Ottoman rule after 1395, when together with its surroundings it was included in the Kyustendil Sanjak as a center of independent Nahiyah.

=== In the Ottoman Empire ===

During the years of Ottoman rule, Petrich acquired a Muslim appearance. The Bulgarians fled to the opposite Ograzhden mountain to stay away from the arbitrariness of the Turks. The Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi visited Petrich in 1652 and reported that the palanquin had 240 not very well-developed houses with gardens. There are all two neighborhoods with a mosque, a chapel, two inns and only one bathroom. The center is a kaaza with 80 villages. There are 50 shops, which suggests the level of crafts and trade.

=== Revival struggles ===

During the Bulgarian National Revival, Petrich rose to a new life. It fueled a stubborn struggle against Greekism to impose the Bulgarian language in schools and the church. In 1855 a Bulgarian monk from Hilendar was appointed a teacher in the town, who, seeing that no one in Petrich spoke Greek, began teaching in Bulgarian, but was soon dismissed. After 1856 Pancho Popmihov opened a private school, where he taught Greek and Bulgarian. In 1857, with the labor and funds of the entire Christian population of the city, the Church of the Assumption was built. A service in Greek was introduced in the temple, and a Greek school was opened in its yard. It is housed in the house of Ivan Popmanolev, donated by his wife to the Church of the Assumption.

In 1868, the construction of the first Bulgarian church &quot;St. Nicholas&quot; was completed, which became the center of the Bulgarian population&#x27;s struggle against Greek propaganda. In the same year, the first Bulgarian church community was founded in Petrich, which established itself as the main unifying center of the Bulgarians in the Petrich region. With its assistance, in 1873, the first New Bulgarian school was opened by Hierodeacon Agapiy Voinov. In 1876, after the April Uprising, the Bulgarian school was closed, and the Greek silogos sent a free Greek teacher to Petrich. 

By virtue of the San Stefano Peace Treaty of 1878, the city entered the borders of liberated Bulgaria. According to the clauses of the Berlin Treaty, Petrich was returned to the Ottoman Empire, where it remained until 1912.

In 1882, the school opened its doors, with Kocho Mavrodiev becoming the head teacher in the city. He made great contributions to the development of Bulgarian cultural and educational work in Petrich and the Petrich region. He was the founder of the class and girls&#x27; school in the city. On his initiative, on May 11, 1889, the holiday of Slavic writing was celebrated for the first time.

At the beginning of 1892, the majority of Bulgarians in Petrich and the region officially came under the jurisdiction of the Bulgarian Exarchate.

<doc id="856919" wikidata="Q1828371" url="?curid=856919" title="Lakenheath">
<text>Lakenheath is a village and civil parish in the West Suffolk district of Suffolk in eastern England. It has a population of 4,691 according to the 2011 Census, and is situated close to the county boundaries of both Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, and at the meeting point of The Fens and the Breckland natural environments.

Lakenheath is host to the largest United States Air Force base in the United Kingdom, RAF Lakenheath.

Lakenheath Fen Nature Reserve, created in 1996, restored wetlands from agricultural fields that were growing carrots. In May 2007, it was reported that cranes were nesting in the site for the first time since the fen lands were drained in the 16th century.

The village has a single Victorian primary school, constructed in 1878, which was extended in 1969, again in 2004 and most recently in 2010/2011. There is a small shopping street on which a variety of multi-cultural shops, restaurants, and services are available. Horse-riding services are also present. The village has a modern library with various amenities. Along this main road there is a small hotel, skate park, and a children&#x27;s play park.

Lakenheath has two pubs though historically it had at least sixteen more. The Plough Inn (also known as the Wok n Rock) is a spacious flint-faced 19th-century bar, Far Eastern restaurant and takeaway. It reopened at the end of 2013 after being closed for two years. The other pub is the Brewer&#x27;s Tap. The Royal British Legion was a members-only club, but closed in April 2012.

Lakenheath is remarkable for its medieval church, built about 900 years ago in wood, eventually being rebuilt in the local flint construction style. The church on the exterior has an embattled parapet that has an array of gargoyles and other carved faces at the string course at the base. The interior includes medieval paintings and carvings on the pews. The faces of the church&#x27;s wooden angels bear the scars of the English Civil War, as none of the angels retained their original facial detail, due to religiously motivated vandalism by puritan soldiers. In early 2009, the church received a large grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and local organisations to restore its rare medieval wall paintings. The wall paintings, depicting local saint St Edmund, angels, and birds amongst other subjects, are believed to date from the 13th century.

As well as the Anglican parish church, Lakenheath has churches representing the Methodist, Strict Baptist and Pentecostal (AOG) denominations. All three of the non-Anglican church buildings are also primarily constructed of local flint, albeit with later modifications in brick.

The recently built pavilion now houses the local cricket club and hosts various events.

Lakenheath also boasts a football club playing at ‘The PIt’ stadium in the village. The club, in 2021 won promotion to the Thurlow Nunn League Premier Division, the highest they have ever been and, won the Suffolk Senior Cup for the second time in their history.

==Transportation==

Lakenheath railway station, north of the village, sees very little passenger service.

There are regular bus services to the neighbouring towns of Brandon, Mildenhall and Thetford plus buses to Bury St. Edmunds operated on school/college days which are available to the general public.

==RAF Lakenheath==
Lakenheath is host to the largest deployment of United States Air Force personnel in the United Kingdom: RAF Lakenheath. The social impact of the United States Air Force fighter airbase and its nearby sister, RAF Mildenhall, on the economy of Lakenheath and on the nearby towns and villages is important. The United States has maintained a presence in the community since bombers were stationed there during WWII conducting raids on Europe. The base has a population of around 6000 service personnel.

==Prehistory and archaeology==
During the Ice Age, the River Bytham flowed through the area that is now Lakenheath, depositing much of the modern geology found in the area.

Excavation of three early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries at RAF Lakenheath between 1997 and 2002 uncovered a total of 394 inhumation and 17 cremation burials, including one 6th-century grave with a horse burial: a man was buried next to a fully armoured horse.

==History==

During the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1381, Sir John Cavendish, the Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench and Chancellor of the University of Cambridge was pursued by rebels and caught and killed in Lakenheath.

The village was struck by an F0/T1 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.

==Climate==
Lakenheath has an oceanic climate similar to the rest of the region of East of England. It is therefore warmer and drier than the average climate of the British Isles due to its relative distance to the low-pressure dominated coastal weather systems of the Atlantic.

<text>Razlog ( ) is a town and ski resort in Razlog Municipality, Blagoevgrad Province in southwestern Bulgaria. It is situated in the Razlog Valley and was first mentioned during the reign of Byzantine emperor Basil II.

==The municipality==
The municipality of Razlog comprises the villages of Banya, Gorno Draglishte, Dobarsko, Bachevo, Godlevo, and Eleshnitsa with a total population of 20,410.

Dobarsko, located on the southern slopes of Rila, is home to several historical landmarks. The Church of Theodore Tyro and Theodore Stratelates is a national monument of culture. The church has an abundance of original murals and frescoes, including ones depicting Jesus Christ in what some observers claim to be a rocket. The icons in the tzar (king) row of the church &quot;Sretenie Gospodne&quot; (1860) were painted by Simeon D. Molerov, a representative of the Bansko Painting School.
==History==

During his 1894–1896 trip in the region of Macedonia, Bulgarian geographer Vasil Kanchov visited Razlog (then known as Мехомия, &quot;Mehomiya&quot;) and reported that it numbered 820 households, of which 500 of Eastern Orthodox Bulgarians, 300 of Muslim Bulgarians (Pomaks), 16 of Protestant Bulgarians and 5 of Eastern Orthodox Aromanians, for a total population of around 4,620. According to the same author&#x27;s 1900 study on the population of Macedonia, Razlog was populated by 4,970 people, of which 3,200 Christian Bulgarians, 1,460 Muslim Bulgarians, 80 Turks, 200 Romani and 30 Aromanians.

The town&#x27;s population actively participated in the Kresna-Razlog and Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising, Razlog, which was part of the Sanjak of Siroz in the Salonika Vilayet as &quot;Razlık&quot;, itself being liberated from Ottoman rule in 1912.

In 1925, the town was renamed from Mehomia to Razlog.

The municipality of Razlog and the whole Razlog valley possess rich inheritance of cultural monuments from different ages and civilizations. There are seven cultural monuments in the territory of Razlog. These are the Christian temples: Saint Georgi Pobedonoset (built in 1834 in Razlog); Saint Gerogii (built in 1834 in Banya village); Uspenie Bogorodichno (built in 1835 in Dolno Draglishte village) — the iconostasis in this temple was made by one of the most prominent representatives of the wood-carving school in Tryavna: Dosyu Koyuv; Saint Bogoroditsa in Dolno Draglishte village, specialists suppose that the temple was built before the 16th century; Sretenie Gospodne (built in 1860 in Dobarsko village); and Saint Theodor Тiron and Theodor Stratilat (built in 1614 in Dobarsko village). This temple has unique mural paintings; it is a cultural monument under the protection of UNESCO.

There are 70 houses in the municipality, which are archeological monuments. They are mainly from the age of the Revival — the so-called &quot;Razlog-Chepino&quot; houses.

The historic museum in Razlog presents a collection of pottery from the 19-20th century, local traditional hand-made textiles and bell-mouldings.

During the Second Balkan War (1913), the area around the town was a major battlefield between the Greek and Bulgarian armies. The town was captured by the Greek forces on 9 July (O.S.), recaptured by the Bulgarians on 16 July, and again to the Greeks on 18 July. After the following peace treaty Razlog was ceded to Bulgaria.

Razlog developed as a centre of winter tourism in the 1990s and 2000s owing to its favourable position in the vicinity of the Pirin, Rila and Rhodope mountains.

==Culture==

Razlog is a town with rich cultural traditions and customs kept through the centuries with the spirit of original Bulgarian values.

Two of the most significant folklore events in Bulgaria are organized and held in Razlog. These are the New Year&#x27;s Kukeri holidays and the gathering for folk art &quot;Pirin sings&quot;.

Proof for the original kukeri traditions is the insignia of honour, given to the municipality of Razlog by Henri Van der Kroon, president of the International Federation of European and Mediterranean carnival towns in May 2004. As a member of this federation, the kukeri groups from the municipality of Razlog regularly participate in the events organised by it.

Unique is the gathering for folk art &quot;Pirin songs&quot;, which is visited on a mass scale and takes one of the leading positions in organization and artistic organization. The gathering in the &quot;Yavorov&quot; hut has become tradition in the recent years. The hut is one of the most visited locations in the Pirin mountain. It was built 72 years ago and during the summer season it turns out to be small for numerous tourists. Interests for the tourists are local &quot;valevitsi, craftsmen&#x27;s shops and culinary art of Razlog with the scent of the &quot;kapama&quot;, &quot;chumlek&quot;, &quot;church&#x27;s beans&quot;, &quot;sugrena banitsa&quot;, etc. Of great interest are also the Easter and Christmas holiday, religious and general life customs, such as Todor&#x27;s day (horse race), Voditsi (celebration of Yordan&#x27;s day with throwing of a cross into water), Grandmother&#x27;s day, Proshki, etc.

==Education and sports==
A big part of the specialized schools in the region are in Razlog; they provide qualified labor for the sectors of the economy and development in the municipality.

The education network in the Municipality of Razlog comprises nine municipality schools, two of which are primary, six secondary, there is one school with special classes in English, Mathematics with German; there are also four national schools. Specialists in the field of business administration and management in hotels and culinary arts, electronics, transportation, and agriculture are prepared in the professional high school of tourism, the professional transport high school and professional mechanization and agriculture high school.

In 1999 &quot;ASIX&quot;-Razlog was established, a club for martial arts, in which about 60 children train actively. The members of this club have won many prizes from republican, Balkan and international tournaments. There were more than 30 medals from the republican tournament in Karate-do and Ju-jitsu in 2006.

Other sports developed in the municipality are volleyball, football, taekwondo, chess and sport orientation. The most developed sport in the town is volleyball. The local team Pirin (Razlog) is among the best teams in the elite volleyball division in Bulgaria and often produces players for the national volleyball teams of the country. The football team has achieved good results for the last several years and now it is taking part in the second professional division in Bulgaria.

==Nature==
Nature is the greatest asset of Razlog valley. North of the town is the kingdom of the Rila National Park. Pirin rises to the south — the mountain that Slavs called &quot;Mountain of Gods&quot; (Perun). The Pirin National Park is included in the convention for the Preservation of World Natural and Cultural Heritage Sites. In Pirin, there are more than 100 bird species and over 1100 plant species among which is the symbol of the mountain: the edelweiss. There are 42 mammal species: chamois, bears and others.

The most precious parts of Pirin are designated reserves. &quot;Bayuvi Dupki - Djinjiritsa&quot; is a biosphere reserve under the auspices of UNESCO, where unique formations of white and Macedonian and Bosnian pine trees are to be found, together with more than 27 Bulgarian and 43 Balkan relict species.

==Investments==
In recent years the municipality of Razlog has attracted foreign investment, connected to the development of modern technologies in the fields of machine-building, electronics, and furniture production.

For the period 2005-2006 projects for near 50 million levs were implemented, and the investments applied for the beginning of 2006 were 100 million euro. The biggest private sites are the resort complex &quot;Katarino SPA&quot;, &quot;Hotel Razlog&quot; with total investment of near 15 million euro. Of the foreign investments, the biggest are cleaning station for waste water for 6 million euro and road II-19 &quot;Simitli-Razlog-Sadovo&quot; which connects Bulgaria and Greece for 20 million euro.

The Pirin Golf &amp; Country Club complex is in the Betolovoto location, at the foot of the Pirin mountain, with views to the Rila and Rodopi mountains. Besides the golf course with 18 holes and service buildings, the complex includes construction of a &quot;Welcome zone&quot; with car park, residential zone, center (commercial center, restaurants, cafes), horse base, and sports complex.

Imminent is the realization of a project including completion of ski-zone &quot;Kulinoto&quot;, building of water park and other concomitant structures.

At the moment there are perspective researches for supplying Bansko, Razlog, Dobrinishte village and Banya village with natural gas, after which the construction of gas-conveying and distributing networks may begin in the locations foreseen for gasification.

<doc id="856921" wikidata="Q1134101" url="?curid=856921" title="Cornershop">
<text>Cornershop are an English indie rock band formed in Leicester, in 1991. The group are best known for their single &quot;Brimful of Asha&quot; from their third album &quot;When I Was Born for the 7th Time&quot;, whose remixed version topped the UK singles chart in 1998. They were formed by Tjinder Singh (singer, songwriter, and guitar), his brother Avtar Singh (bass guitar, vocals), David Chambers (drums), and Ben Ayres (guitar, keyboards, and tamboura), the first three having previously been members of General Havoc, who released one single (the &quot;Fast Jaspal&quot; EP) in 1991. The band name originated from a stereotype referring to British Asians often owning corner shops. Their music is a fusion of Indian music, indie rock, alternative and electronic dance music.

==History==
===Formation and early years: 1991–1996===
Tjinder Singh formed General Havoc whilst a student at Lancashire Polytechnic in Preston in 1987. He relocated to Leicester, where his brother and sister lived. He formed Cornershop in 1991 along with his brother Avtar and Chambers and Ayres while working as a barman at Leicester&#x27;s Magazine pub, a popular local music venue near O&#x27;Jays, where the band played their first gigs. Named after the stereotype of South Asians owning corner shops, Cornershop drew inspiration from Singh&#x27;s experiences as a British-born Sikh, mixing traditional Punjabi music with British indie rock. In the early 1990s, when the UK music press criticised singer Morrissey after accusations of racism, the band were invited to comment and the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; ran a story featuring the band burning a picture of the singer outside the offices of EMI.

Their debut release, the &quot;In The Days of Ford Cortina EP&quot;, produced by John Robb was pressed on &quot;curry-coloured vinyl&quot; and contained a blend of Indian-tinged noise pop. The sound mellowed somewhat with the release of debut album &quot;Hold On It Hurts&quot; in 1994, described by &quot;Trouser Press&quot; as &quot;a politically charged popfest, ten tracks of noisy delights that meld incisive social commentary with a firm hold on British post-punk.&quot; The album impressed David Byrne, who signed the band to his label Luaka Bop. Although David Chambers left the band in 1994 and was replaced by Nick Simms, the band re-emerged in 1995 with the &quot;6 a.m. Jullandar Shere&quot; single and the album &quot;Woman&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot;, also touring the United States including some dates on the Lollapalooza tour. The band also toured Europe with Beck, Stereolab and Oasis.

===Mainstream success: 1997–2001===
The band released their critically acclaimed album, &quot;When I Was Born for the 7th Time&quot;, in September 1997. The album incorporates a variety of genres, combining indie rock, Britpop, electronic music, and hip-hop. Tracks such as &quot;When the Light Appears Boy&quot; feature Allen Ginsberg, while &quot;Candyman&quot; includes Justin Warfield, and &quot;Good to Be on the Road Back Home&quot; features Paula Frazer. The band also covers The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot; in Punjabi. 

Recorded in multiple studios across London, San Francisco, and Preston, Lancashire, the album was produced by Tjinder Singh in collaboration with Dan the Automator and Daddy Rappaport. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it one of the essential recordings of the 1990s, and it was ranked No. 1 on &quot;Spin&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;Top 20 Albums of the Year&quot; for 1997. The album reached No. 17 on the UK Albums Chart and was certified Gold. 

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Brimful of Asha,&quot; topped John Peel&#x27;s Festive 50 list in 1997 and became an international hit following a popular remix by Fatboy Slim. The song is a tribute to the Indian playback singer Asha Bhosle and reflects Singh&#x27;s love for Trojan Records and vinyl culture.

Cornershop took a break from touring in 1998, during which frontman Tjinder Singh and guitarist Ben Ayres worked as DJs and formed the side project Clinton. In 2000, they released a disco inspired album, &quot;Disco and the Halfway to Discontent&quot;, as part of their side-project. This inspired the launch of the London-based club night called Buttoned Down Disco, which took its name from the third track on the album.

===Further activities and recent years: 2002–present===
Cornershop&#x27;s next official release was the 2002 album &quot;Handcream for a Generation.&quot; The album was recorded between 2000 and 2001 at West Orange Studios in Preston, Lancashire, and Eastcote Studios in London, with Singh producing most of the album and Rob Swift co-producing two tracks. Drawing on soul, funk, disco, house, reggae, and psychedelic rock, featuring instruments like sitar and tabla, the album also featured a collaboration with Noel Gallagher on guitar. Two singles, &quot;Lessons Learned from Rocky I to Rocky III&quot; and &quot;Staging,&quot; peaked at 37 and 80 on the UK Singles Chart. Cornershop promoted the album with UK and US tours, festival appearances, and performances with Oasis. 

Despite initial success, Cornershop parted ways with Wiiija in October 2002 due to low album sales. Since 2003, they have reportedly been working on a film about London&#x27;s independent music scene. In 2004, they released &quot;Topknot&quot; with Bubbley Kaur on Rough Trade Records, followed by the 2006 single Wop the Groove, featuring Rowetta from Happy Mondays. Their song &quot;Candyman&quot; was later used in Nike&#x27;s LeBron James VI shoe commercial, The Six &quot;Chalk,&quot; in 2008. In July 2009, they released the album &quot;Judy Sucks a Lemon for Breakfast&quot;, led by the single &quot;The Roll-Off Characteristics (Of History in the Making),&quot; on their label, Ample Play.

In 2011, Cornershop were awarded a prize for Commitment to Scene in the UK Asian Music Awards. and released &quot;Cornershop and the Double &#x27;O&#x27; Groove Of&quot;, a collaborative album with Punjabi folk singer Bubbley Kaur, which was critically acclaimed. They also launched the &quot;Singhles Club,&quot; a subscription service featuring musical collaborations and digital artwork. Their eighth album, &quot;Urban Turban&quot;, came out in May 2012, followed by their ninth album, &quot;Hold On It&#x27;s Easy&quot;, in February 2015. In July 2015, they released the single &quot;Pinpoint&quot; with Welsh singer Angharad Van Rijswijk, aka Accü.

In 2017, they gave an instrumental track called &#x27;Demon is a Monster&#x27; to the anti-Brexit podcast &#x27;Remainiacs&#x27; as a theme tune. The track was then released digitally. Cornershop are fiercely anti-Brexit. In March 2020, they released a new album, &quot;England Is a Garden&quot; to generally positive reviews. The first official video from the album accompanying the track &#x27;St Marie Under Canon&#x27; was released in February 2020.

<text>Simitli ( ) also known as Simitliya (), is a town in Blagoevgrad Province in southwestern Bulgaria. It has a population of 7,454 and is located 17 km south of Blagoevgrad. It is the seat of Simitli Municipality.

==Geography==

The town is located in the Simitli Valley at the foothills of the Rila, Pirin, and Vlahina mountain ranges. Simitli is on both banks of the river Struma, at the confluence with its tributary the Gradevska reka. Geographical locations of note are the Komatinski Cliffs between Brestovo and Sushitsa, the Kresna Gorge along the Struma, and the foothills of the Pirin Mountains at Senokos.

==Transportation==
Simitli lies along the parallel Struma motorway and first class I-1 road along the Struma valley, part of European route E79, that link the capital Sofia and the provincial centre Blagoevgrad with Greece at Kulata. At Simitli the second class II-19 road branches off I-1 heading to the town and winter resort of Bansko in the Razlog Valley. Simitli is also part of the Bulgarian State Railways network from Sofia to Greece.

==Tourism==
Some of the best whitewater rapids in the Balkans can be found on the Struma river in the Kresna Gorge. The rafting and kayaking season is from April to July and there is guided rafting every weekend. Simitli is also part of the EuroCup circuit for the European Rafting Federation every year. Every second weekend of January, there is a Kukeri or Surva festival held in the local stadium by E-79 which rivals Razlog and Pernik&#x27;s own Kukeri Festivals.

<doc id="856929" wikidata="Q1049526" url="?curid=856929" title="Yoshikazu Yasuhiko">
<text>is a Japanese animator, manga artist, and anime director. He is best known for being the character designer and animation director of the original &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; anime, which began in 1979. That same year, he began working as a manga artist, which had been his dream since childhood. His manga have been critically acclaimed and have won numerous awards.

==Early life==
Born 1947 in Engaru, Hokkaidō, Yasuhiko started to draw manga in third grade of elementary school. In high school, he learned the basics of Marxism from a teacher and was inspired by it. At the time, the world&#x27;s focus was on the Vietnam War, a proxy war between the capitalist United States and socialist Soviet Union. Yasuhiko said seeing a superpower such as the US burn down a small country naturally made him &quot;anti-American&quot;. Additionally, he viewed Japan as complicit in the war by supporting the US through Yokota Air Base and Misawa Air Base, while claiming to have a pacifist constitution, something he called unforgivable. Yasuhiko began attending Hirosaki University in 1966. A member of the New Left, he became a leader in the &quot;Zenkyōtō&quot; student movement and involved in the anti-war protests. In September 1969, Yasuhiko was arrested on suspicion of breaking and entering into Hirosaki University, and subsequently expelled.

==Career==
After moving to Tokyo at age 22, Yasuhiko joined Mushi Productions&#x27; training school and began working as an animator despite dreaming of becoming a manga artist. He has since admitted that he had no interest in animation and did not know what the job would entail, he simply applied to the newspaper advertisement on a whim in order to make a living. It was not until he storyboarded &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; (1974) that he began to find the job interesting. Yasuhiko later went freelance and worked on various anime productions for film and television. Some of his most notable works as character designer and director are &quot;Brave Reideen&quot;, &quot;Combattler V&quot;, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, and &quot;Giant Gorg&quot;. Less well known is the fact that he was the original character designer for &quot;Dirty Pair&quot;, when he illustrated the Haruka Takachiho short stories that became the 1980 fixup novel &quot;The Great Adventures of the Dirty Pair&quot;.

Yasuhiko said he had given up on manga because he was under the impression that manga artists had to use pens and he was personally unable to draw sufficiently with one. But while working on &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;, he visited Leiji Matsumoto who told him that manga artists could use brushes too. Yasuhiko made his manga debut with &quot;Arion&quot; (1979–1984). In 1981 he won the Seiun Award in the art category. Yasuhiko turned &quot;Arion&quot; into an animated film that he directed and co-wrote in 1986. That same year, he began the manga &quot;Venus Wars&quot; (1986–1990), which he also later adapted into a film. Yasuhiko became a full-time manga artist in 1989. He serialized &quot;Namuji&quot; from 1989 to 1991. It won an Excellence Award at the 1992 Japan Cartoonists Association Awards. In the mid-1990s, Yasuhiko created works such as &quot;Joan&quot;, a three-volume story of a young French girl living at the time of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, whose life parallels that of Joan of Arc; and &quot;Jesus&quot;, a two-volume biographical manga about the life of Jesus Christ. Yasuhiko created &quot;Ōdō no Inu&quot; from 1998 to 2000. In 2000, it earned him an Excellence Prize at the Japan Media Arts Festival.

Yasuhiko serialized &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin&quot; for ten years, from 2001 to 2011. He stated that, in his mind, &quot;Gundam&quot; is &quot;only&quot; the original 1979 anime series and that it is the only one that he takes responsibility for. The artist also said that subsequent installments in the franchise focused more on the &quot;Newtypes&quot; seen in the series, which lead to critics and &quot;otaku&quot; misunderstanding the theme of &quot;Gundam&quot;. Yasuhiko further stated that the perpetrators of the Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995 were &quot;undoubtedly familiar&quot; with &quot;Gundam&quot; and the &quot;Newtypes&quot;. As such, &quot;I had to do another job to correct the distortions in understanding &#x27;Gundam&#x27;--, which was why I ended up drawing &#x27;The Origin&#x27; in response to Sunrise&#x27;s request.&quot; The manga has over 10 million copies in circulation, and earned him the 2012 Seiun Award in the comics category. He returned to animation in the 2010s to direct &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin&quot;″s anime adaptations.
Yasuhiko then created &quot;Ten no Ketsumyaku&quot;, about a student in Manchuria on the eve of the Russo-Japanese War, for &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; between January 2012 and September 2016. In 2015, he won a special award for lifetime achievement at the Animation Kobe Awards. Yasuhiko began &quot;Inui to Tatsumi -Siberia Shuppei Hishi-&quot; in &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; on September 25, 2018. The historical series set during the Siberian Intervention was announced as being his last serialized manga. He was honored with a special award for lifetime achievement at the 44th Japan Academy Film Prize in 2021. He also received a lifetime achievement award at the 2022 film awards held by the Agency for Cultural Affairs. Yasuhiko stated that the 2022 film &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Cucuruz Doan&#x27;s Island&quot;, which he directed, would be his last work in animation.

==Style==
As a child, Yasuhiko was particularly fond of Mitsuteru Yokoyama&#x27;s art. His own manga are known for their action scenes. Yasuhiko does not create memos, sketches or names in advance, he draws directly onto manuscript BB Kent paper in pencil. Unusually, after deciding the page&#x27;s panel layout, he begins by drawing characters&#x27; faces. Also unusually, he inks every part of his manga with a Sakuyo brush, except the panels, which are done first with a fineliner pen. He goes through two or three brushes for a 30-page chapter. Yasuhiko said he does not know how to use white ink, so he inks around negative space that he leaves in.

Michael Toole of Anime News Network wrote that by defining the look of &quot;Gundam&quot;″s characters, Yasuhiko also defined the look of science fiction anime characters in the 1980s in general by extension. Yasuhiko signs his artwork as &quot;YAS&quot;.

<text>Carlisle Castle is a stone keep medieval fortress located in the city of Carlisle near the ruins of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. First built during the reign of William II in 1092 and rebuilt in stone under Henry I in 1122, the castle is over 930 years old and has been the scene of many episodes in British history. 

This Castle played an extremely important part in the wars between England and Scotland (the Wars of Scottish Independence). It has been the centre of many wars and invasions. During the Jacobite Rising of 1745–6, Carlisle became the last English fortress to undergo a siege. The castle was listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument on 7 August 1996.

Today the property is managed by English Heritage and is open to the public. Until 2006, the castle was the administrative headquarters of the former King&#x27;s Own Royal Border Regiment and until 2019 it was the county headquarters to the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment. A museum to the regiment is within the castle walls.

==History==
Carlisle Castle was first built during the reign of William II of England, the son of William the Conqueror. At that time, Cumberland (the original name for north and west Cumbria) was still considered a part of Scotland. William II ordered the construction of a Norman style Motte and Bailey castle in Carlisle on the site of the old Roman fort of Luguvalium, dated by dendrochronology to 72AD, with the castle construction beginning in 1092.

In 1122, Henry I of England ordered a stone castle with towers to be constructed on the site. Thus a keep and city walls were constructed. The existing keep dates from somewhere between 1122 and 1135. The tower keep castle is one of only 104 recorded examples, most being found on the Welsh border. The castle was largely rebuilt by order of David I of Scotland following the Battle of the Standard in 1138. Henry of Anjou was knighted within the castle in 1149. David died of illness there in 1153.
The act of driving out the Scots from Cumberland led to many attempts to retake the lands. The result of this was that Carlisle and its castle would change hands many times for the next 700 years. The first attempt began during the troubled reign of Stephen of England.

On 26 March 1296, John &#x27;The Red&#x27; Comyn, since the fourth quarter of 1295 Lord of Annandale, led a Scottish host across the Solway to attack Carlisle. The then governor of the castle, Robert de Brus, deposed Lord of Annandale, successfully withstood the attack, before forcing the raiders to retreat back through Annandale to Sweetheart Abbey. From 22 July to 1 August 1315, Scottish forces laid siege to the Castle. However, the Scottish lacked the resources needed to maintain a siege and withdrew.

From the mid-13th century until the Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland in 1603, Carlisle Castle was the vital headquarters of the Western March, a buffer zone to protect the western portion of the Anglo-Scottish border.

Henry VIII converted the castle for artillery, employing the engineer Stefan von Haschenperg. For a few months in 1568, Mary, Queen of Scots was imprisoned within the castle, in the Warden&#x27;s Tower. Francis Knollys described her watching two football matches on a playing green outside the castle&#x27;s postern gate. Later, the castle was besieged by the Parliamentary forces for eight months in 1644, during the English Civil War.
The last battles for the city of Carlisle and its castle were during the Jacobite rising of 1745 against George II. The forces of &quot;Prince&quot; Charles Edward Stuart travelled south from Scotland into England reaching as far south as Derby. Carlisle and the castle were seized and &quot;fortified&quot; by the Jacobites. However they were driven north by the forces of William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, the son of George II. Carlisle was recaptured, and the Jacobites were jailed and executed. That battle marked the end of the castle&#x27;s fighting life, as defending the border between England and Scotland was not necessary with both countries again one in Great Britain. 

After 1746, the castle became somewhat neglected, although some minor repairs were undertaken such as that of the drawbridge in 1783.

Some parts of the castle were then demolished for use as raw materials in the 19th century to create more or less what is visible to the visitor today. In 1851 the barracks were occupied by the 33rd Regiment of Foot with 10 officers, 150 soldiers, 2 servants and 25 soldiers&#x27; wives and children. The Army moved in to take hold of the castle and in 1873 a system of recruiting areas based on counties was instituted under the Cardwell Reforms and the castle became the depot for the 34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot and the 55th (Westmorland) Regiment of Foot. Under the Childers Reforms, the 34th and 55th regiments amalgamated to form the Border Regiment with its depot in the castle in 1881. The castle remained the depot of the Border Regiment until 1959, when the regiment amalgamated with the King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) to form the King&#x27;s Own Royal Border Regiment. The Army Reserve still use parts of the castle: 8 Platoon C Company 4th Battalion the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment are based within the Burma Block alongside a Multi Cap-Badge detachment of the Army Reserve, including Medics, Engineers, Logisticicians, Intelligence and Infanteers from other Cap Badges.

Carlisle Castle was listed as (List Entry Number: 1014579) in August 1996, by what is now Historic England. The listing for the Scheduled Ancient Monument status includes &quot;the upstanding and buried remains of Carlisle medieval tower keep castle, two lengths of Carlisle city wall, a 16th century battery, and the buried remains of much of the Roman fort known as Luguvalium, a large part of which underlies the later castle.&quot;

In 2016, Historic England undertook the first official investigation into the historic graffiti and carvings scattered over the castle site, using photogrammetric techniques to record findings. The ‘Prisoners’ Carvings’ in the Keep, and a medieval door covered in etchings, were laser scanned, photographed and filmed, alongside a Roman altar stone, medieval and postmediaeval graffiti and carvings across the complex, to produce 3D models as a record of their current condition.

==Museum==
The Castle houses Cumbria&#x27;s Museum of Military Life. The museum &quot;relates the history of Cumbria’s County Infantry Regiment, the Border Regiment and the King’s Own Royal Border Regiment and local Militia&quot;, according to &quot;Visit Cumbria&quot; guide.

== Arthurian Legend ==

In a 14th century poem, legend has it that Sir Gawain, one of the Knights of the Round Table, stayed at the Castle of Carlisle while on a hunting expedition in the haunted Inglewood Forest. He then slept with the Carle&#x27;s wife and killed him. This poem has strong parallels with another 14th century poem about Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. The story has since been re-adapted many times most recently in films from 1973, 1984 and 2021.

By some accounts, Carlisle Castle is none other than Camelot, the mythical seat of King Arthur&#x27;s court.

<text>The Odisha Communist Party is a political party in the Indian state of Odisha. OCP was formed in the beginning of the 1990s as a splinter group of Communist Party of India (Marxist). The party is led by Ajeya Rout. When the split occurred the dissidents tried to capture the trade union structure of CPI(M) in the mining areas in northern Odisha. This led to violent conflict. But the OCP-ers themselves came from southern Odisha, and they were not able to convince the northern grassroots to follow them. In the end the OCP-ers had to leave the mining areas. Today OCP is more or less defunct. It has good relations with the Indian National Congress, who gave OCP an office in the state capital Bhubaneswar.

Radhakanta Sethi, who was elected to the Odisha legislative assembly as a CPI(M)-candidate, joined OCP in 1992 after a period as an independent.

OCP participates in the Confederation of Indian Communists and Democratic Socialists.</text><links>

<doc id="856946" wikidata="Q5631493" url="?curid=856946" title="HMS Bamborough Castle">
<text>HMS &quot;Bamborough Castle&quot; was one of 44 s built for the Royal Navy during World War II. Completed in mid-1944 she sank the U-boat on 9 December. Aside from a brief period assigned to the Fishery Protection Squadron in 1946, the rest of her career was spent as part of the fleet reserve until she was scrapped in May 1959.

==Design and description==
The Castle-class corvette was a stretched version of the preceding Flower class, enlarged to improve seakeeping and to accommodate modern weapons. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They were powered by a pair of triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The &quot;Castle&quot;s carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement was 99 officers and ratings.

The Castle-class ships were equipped with a single QF Mk XVI gun forward, but their primary weapon was their single three-barrel Squid anti-submarine mortar. This was backed up by one depth charge rail and two throwers for 15 depth charges. The ships were fitted with two twin and a pair of single mounts for Oerlikon light AA guns. Provision was made for a further four single mounts if needed. They were equipped with Type 145Q and Type 147B ASDIC sets to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water. A Type 277 search radar and a HF/DF radio direction finder rounded out the Castles&#x27; sensor suite.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Bamborough Castle&quot; was laid down by J. Lewis &amp; Sons at their shipyard in Aberdeen on 1 July 1943 and launched on 11 January 1944. She was completed on 30 May and served as a convoy escort, sinking the German U-boat in the Barents Sea with depth charges on 9 December 1944. The ship was placed in reserve on 25 May 1945. &quot;Bamborough Castle&quot; was reactivated in January 1946 and assigned to the Fishery Protection Flotilla based at Plymouth before she returned to reserve in 1947. The ship was sold for scrap in 1959 and arrived at Llanelli on 22 May to be broken up.

<text>Carrozzeria Ghia SpA (established 1916 in Turin) is an Italian automobile design and coachbuilding firm, established by Giacinto Ghia and Gariglio as &quot;Carrozzeria Ghia &amp; Gariglio&quot;. The headquarters are located at Corso Guglielmo Marconi, 4, Turin. The company is currently owned by Ford Motor Company and focused on the European market through Ford&#x27;s subsidiary in the region.

Through the years, Ghia has produced many bodies for several automobile manufacturers such as Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Ferrari, Fiat, Ford, Jaguar, and Volkswagen.

== History ==

Ghia initially made lightweight aluminium-bodied cars, achieving fame with the Alfa Romeo 6C 1500, winning Mille Miglia (1929). Between the world wars, Ghia designed special bodies for Alfa Romeo, Fiat, and Lancia, one of the most famous was the Fiat 508 &quot;Balilla&quot; sports coupe (1933). The factory was rebuilt at Via Tomassi Grossi, after being demolished in an air raid during World War II (1943).
After Ghia&#x27;s death (1944), the company was sold to Mario Boano and Giorgio Alberti. The Ghia-Aigle subsidiary was established in Aigle, Switzerland (1948).

Following differences between Boano and the company&#x27;s Naples-born chief engineer and designer Luigi Segre, Boano left the company in 1953 and ownership passed to Segre in 1954. Under the ownership of Luigi Segre, between 1953 and 1957, Giovanni Savonuzzi became Direttore Tecnico Progettazione e Produzione Carrozzerie e Stile and established Ghia as the most influential proponent of that Italian styling that came to define automobile design trends worldwide. The decade between 1953 and 1963 saw many foreign firms ordering Ghia designs, such as Volkswagen (the Karmann Ghia) and Volvo. Chrysler and its designer Virgil Exner became a close partner for 15 years, resulting in eighteen Chrysler Ghia Specials (1951–53), the K-310, the Chrysler Norseman, the Imperial Crown limousines (whose notable owners included Jackie Kennedy and Nelson Rockefeller), and others. There are even a few Ghia-bodied Ferraris. Ghia also participated in the short-lived Dual-Ghia venture. Production by Ghia was always in very low numbers, giving the company&#x27;s products even greater exclusivity than those of the other Italian coachbuilders.

In June 1953, Pierre Lefaucheux, Renault&#x27;s chairman, requested Carrozzeria Ghia assistance with the Renault Dauphine.

In 1953, Boano left for Fiat, the factory moved to via Agostino da Montefeltro, and Luigi Segre took over. Ghia then brought in Pietro Frua, appointing Frua as head of &quot;Ghia Design&quot; (1957–60), designing the Renault Floride. After Segre&#x27;s death in 1963, Ghia was sold to Ramfis Trujillo in 1965, who in turn sold the company in 1967 to Alejandro de Tomaso, owner of a rival design house. De Tomaso never managed to run Ghia profitably and in 1970 he sold his shares to the Ford Motor Company. During this transition period, Ghia had partial involvement in the De Tomaso Pantera, a high-performance, mid-engined car using a Ford V8.

From then on, the Ghia studios were an integral part of Ford of Europe&#x27;s styling operation – producing mostly concept cars although some production models were styled by the firm – the most notable being the Ford Fiesta Mk1 in 1976, which was penned by Ghia&#x27;s Tom Tjaarda. Aside from this, the most publicly visible sign of Ford&#x27;s ownership of Ghia has been its use of the name to denote the luxury trim level of its European models for many years (below).

== Ghia L6.4 ==
After the Dual-Ghia project had ended, the more up-to-date Ghia L6.4 appeared in 1961. Fewer Mopar parts were used, but the car&#x27;s bespoke nature meant an astronomically high price and when production ended in 1963 only 25 (or 26) cars had been built. The car&#x27;s Chrysler V8 has SAE, and suspension and transmission parts were also hand-picked from Chrysler&#x27;s production line. Both the front and the rear seats consist of separate buckets.


== Ghia 450 SS==
At the 1963 Turin Show, Ghia showed the Fiat 2300-based Ghia G230 S. Unlike the Fiat 2300 Coupé, also designed and bodied by Ghia, the two-seater G230S was built on a tubular spaceframe which was designed and built by specialists Gilco. Four examples were built, two coupés and two convertibles. Ghia&#x27;s owner Luigi Segre had pushed for the creation of this car, but after his sudden and untimely death the G230 S never entered production. However, in 1965 film and television producer Burt Sugarman saw a picture of the G230 S on the cover of Road &amp; Track magazine and convinced Ghia to build another car using a similar design.

The result was the Ghia 450 SS, continuing Ghia&#x27;s collaboration with Chrysler by using that company&#x27;s recently introduced &quot;LA&quot; V8 engine with . So many of the car&#x27;s parts and systems came from the Plymouth Barracuda that the earliest cars came with a Barracuda manual with some pages crossed out. The 450 SS used the same design language as the smaller G230 S, but its hand beaten steel panels sat on a more traditional and sturdier ladder frame. Unlike the smaller car, the 450 SS was a 2+2 design, offering vestigial rear seat accommodation. It was only built as a two-door roadster, with a standard hardtop included. Over the years, many have credited Giorgetto Giugiaro with this design, but he only left Bertone for Ghia in late 1965 – too late to have much impact on the 450 SS, which was actually designed by Sergio Sartorelli. Giugiaro did revise the grille, front bumper, and rear before the car was presented. Presented at Turin in 1966, 57 examples were built until late 1967 (with late examples registered as model year 1968), although various sources state numbers as low as 52.


== The Ghia name ==
From 1973, the Ghia name became Ford&#x27;s top trim-level in its mainstream model range. The trend began in Europe and North America (Mustang II, Granada, Capri, Cortina, Escort, and later Fiesta, Sierra, Sierra Sapphire, Orion, Scorpio, Mondeo, Focus all had Ghia trim levels), but soon spread worldwide, particularly to the South American (with the Argentinian Ford Falcon and Taunus, the Brazilian Ford Del Rey and versions of Escort, Focus and Mondeo) and Asia Pacific markets (with the Ford Laser, Fairmont, Fairlane and Telstar). One notable exception to this convention was the Scorpio model in the United Kingdom, which was essentially a rebadged Granada Mk3, slotting in above the Ghia in the model lineup. This lasted until the major facelift of 1994, when the Granada name was dropped and replaced by Scorpio for all variants, at which point the Ghia model resumed its position at the top of the range.

In the British market, however, the practice of using the Ghia name in such a capacity was finally phased out in 2010. The &quot;Titanium&quot; name has instead replaced Ghia as the flagship trim level, and is now used globally across all of Ford&#x27;s markets to denote the top trim level. The British Ford Fiesta retained the Ghia trim designation for the longest period of any model: 31 years 8 months, uninterrupted, from February 1977 to November 2008. In the rest of Europe, the Ghia trim was discontinued as well. Starting in 2013, the Vignale branding started being used by Ford to designate the top trim levels. The Ghia studios has produced various concept cars under the Ford banner.

<text>Alphitomancy (from , and ) is a form of divination involving barley cakes or loaves of barley bread.

When someone in a group was suspected of a crime, the members of the group would be fed barley cakes or slices of barley bread. Supposedly, the guilty party would get indigestion, while all others would feel well.

<text>Otter is an infrastructure automation tool that runs under Microsoft Windows, designed by the software company Inedo. Otter utilizes Infrastructure as Code to model infrastructure and configuration.

Otter provisions and configures servers automatically, without logging in to a command prompt.

==Key areas==
Otter focuses on two key areas:
* Configuration automation - Otter allows users to model the configuration of servers, roles, and environments; monitor for drift, schedule changes, and ensure consistency across servers 
* Orchestration automation - Otter can spin up cloud servers, build containers, deploy packages, patch servers, or any other multi-server/service automation 

Otter can continuously monitor for server configuration drift, can automatically remediate drift, and can send notification when drift occurs.

==Key features==
Otter has a visual, web-based user interface that is designed to &quot;create complex configurations and orchestrations using the intuitive, drag-and-drop editor, and then switch to-and-from code/text mode as needed.&quot; Otter aims to enable DevOps practices through its UI, and shows the configuration state of an organization&#x27;s servers infrastructure (local, virtual, cloud-built). Otter supports Microsoft Windows, and supports Linux-based operating systems through SSH-based agents. 

Otter monitors servers for configuration changes, and reports when the configuration has drifted. It supports both agent and agentless Windows servers.

From version 1.5, Otter integrates with Atlassian Jira and Git via extensions.

===PowerShell===
Otter allows the use of Windows PowerShell scripts.

<text>Virginia Caroline Rappe (; July 7, 1891 – September 9, 1921) was an American model and silent film actress. Working mostly in bit parts, Rappe died after attending a party with actor Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle, who was accused of manslaughter and rape in connection with her death, though he was ultimately acquitted of both charges.

==Early life and career==
Virginia Rappe was born in Chicago, Illinois, on July 7, 1891 to a single mother, Mabel Rappe. Mabel died when Rappe was aged 11. Rappe was then raised by her grandmother. 

At age 18, she began working as a commercial and artist&#x27;s model, moving to San Francisco, California, to pursue this career in 1916. There she met dress designer Robert Moscovitz and they became engaged, but shortly afterward he was killed in a streetcar accident. 

Rappe moved to Los Angeles, where in early 1917 she was hired by director Fred Balshofer and given a prominent role in his film &quot;Paradise Garden&quot;, opposite screen star Harold Lockwood. Balshofer hired her again to costar with early drag performer Julian Eltinge and newcomer Rudolph Valentino in &quot;Over the Rhine&quot;. This film was not released until 1920, when Balshofer recut it and released it under the title &quot;An Adventuress&quot;, and later in 1922, after Rappe&#x27;s death, as &quot;The Isle of Love&quot;. She was named &quot;Best Dressed Girl in Pictures&quot; in 1918.

In 1919, Rappe began a relationship with director and producer Henry Lehrman. The couple eventually became engaged and lived together, but in the United States Census of 1920, the young actress is listed as a &quot;boarder&quot; in Lehrman&#x27;s home in Los Angeles. Rappe appeared in at least four films for Lehrman: &quot;His Musical Sneeze&quot;, &quot;A Twilight Baby&quot;, &quot;Punch of the Irish&quot; and &quot;A Game Lady&quot;. However, since many of Lehrman&#x27;s films are lost, the exact number of roles she performed for him cannot be determined.

Following Rappe&#x27;s death, rumors arose, supposedly to besmirch her character, that she had given birth in Chicago in 1918 and put the baby in foster care. These rumors were proven false by autopsy.

==Death==
The circumstances of Rappe&#x27;s death in 1921 became a Hollywood scandal and were heavily sensationalized by the media of the time. During a party held on Labor Day, September 5, 1921, in Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle&#x27;s suite at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, Rappe allegedly suffered a trauma. She died four days later on September 9 from a ruptured bladder and secondary peritonitis. She is buried at Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles alongside her fiance Henry Lehrman.
The exact events of the party remain unclear, with witnesses relating numerous versions of what happened. It was alleged that Rappe had died as a result of a violent sexual assault by Arbuckle. Arbuckle&#x27;s accuser, Bambina Maude Delmont, had accompanied Rappe to the party; she had first met Rappe only a few days earlier. Delmont, however, had a police record for extortion, prostitution and blackmail. Subsequent witnesses testified that Rappe had for some time suffered from cystitis, a condition which could have been aggravated by consuming alcohol. Witnesses also testified that Rappe had previously suffered from venereal disease, so there were allegations that her death was brought on by her health rather than by an assault, however her autopsy revealed no sign of venereal disease or any current or prior pregnancies.

After three manslaughter trials, Arbuckle was formally acquitted; his acquittal in the third trial was accompanied by an unprecedented statement of apology from the jury stating, in part, that, &quot;Acquittal is not enough for Roscoe Arbuckle. We feel that a great injustice has been done him... there was not the slightest proof adduced to connect him in any way with the commission of a crime.&quot; Nevertheless, Arbuckle&#x27;s reputation and career were ruined because of the scandal.

<text>Bembridge is a village and civil parish located on the easternmost point of the Isle of Wight. It had a population of 3,848 according to the 2001 census of the United Kingdom, leading to the implausible claim by some residents that Bembridge is the largest village in England. Bembridge is home to many of the Island&#x27;s wealthiest residents. The population had reduced to 3,688 at the 2011 Census.

Bembridge sits at the extreme eastern point of the Isle of Wight. Prior to land reclamation the area of Bembridge and Yaverland was almost an island, separated from the remainder of the Isle of Wight by Brading Haven. On the Joan Blaeu map of 1665, Bembridge is shown as &quot;Binbridge Iſle&quot;, nearly separated from the rest of Wight by River Yar.

Prior to the Victorian era Bembridge was a collection of wooden huts and farmhouses, which only consolidated into a true village with the building of the church in 1827 (later rebuilt in 1846).

==Facilities==

The historical heart of the village is located close to the church in the north of the village, consisting of a number of shops, pubs and restaurants, along with the Village Hall and site of the former Parish Council hall. Bembridge Library serves the community and there is a local museum in the same location.

Bembridge is a local service centre, hosting Bembridge C of E Primary School (see Education on the Isle of Wight for more information on the use of this term), a post office, several shops located in two main areas, and Methodist, Anglican and Catholic churches. It is also the location of a local fire station, (crewed by a team of retained firemen), and a Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station.

Bembridge Airport is a local airport with a concrete runway, and is located close to the Windmill to the south-west of the village proper heading towards Yaverland.

The Lane End district is located in the east of the village. It is largely composed of modern bungalows and a small shopping area which includes a Co-op store. The lane comes to an end at the beach, where Bembridge Lifeboat station and the Bembridge Coast Hotel are situated. The bungalows are built on the site of a cottage where Cecily Cardew lived, after whom an Oscar Wilde character was named. Further inland from Lane End is Bembridge C of E Primary School, along with the local community centre, which are connected by a large recreational playing field.

The Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club (now defunct) was located at St Helens Duver, across the harbour from Bembridge. The club was formed in 1882 and closed in the 1960s.

The war memorial was designed by local architect, Percy Stone (1856–1934).

=== Lifeboat station ===
The RNLI station is particularly significant, as it extends into the sea to the east of the village. Here lies the notorious &quot;Bembridge Ledge&quot;, a large, rocky outcrop which poses a major threat to passing boats. Although it is private sailing yachts which are most at risk, a wide variety of boats commonly run aground here, especially in the often stormy weather conditions which affect the Solent during winter months. A former Bembridge lifeboat, the , is part of the National Historic Fleet, and exhibited at Imperial War Museum Duxford.

The current offshore boathouse was completed in Autumn 2010 by BAM Nuttall and Ecochoice and houses a new Tamar class boat, the &#x27;Alfred Albert Williams&#x27;. A complete new concrete walkway was built, and the new station is made completely of naturally durable timber. The Inshore lifeboat station was rebuilt in 2014, and the interior of the offshore boathouse is accessible to visitors during set days when the station isn&#x27;t on alert. The original Victorian boathouse also survives, and is currently used as the station&#x27;s shop.

=== Coastguard lookout===
Close to the lifeboat station lies a coastguard lookout. Positioned at a high elevation, this offers views of the Solent meeting the English Channel to the east of the Isle of Wight. From this vantage point one is able to view a variety of watercraft year round, although there is more marine traffic in the summer.

=== Bembridge Windmill ===

Bembridge Windmill, the only remaining windmill on the Isle of Wight, is located to the west of the village. Dating from around 1700, it is a National Trust property generally open from April to October.

== Politics ==
Bembridge is currently represented on the Isle of Wight Council by one member of the ward of Bembridge, St. Helens and Brading.

Bembridge is governed by a Parish council of 12 members. For parish council elections the village is divided into two wards, the North and South, each electing six members to the body. The parish council has succeeded in obtaining Lottery funding for improvements to the village recently, including a play-park in Steyne Park. It is also one of the few Parish Councils that has a village centre office open 5 days a week.

=== Twinning ===
Bembridge is twinned with Plédran, Brittany, France but in name only as the federation has lapsed through non-use.

==Public transportation ==
Public transport to Newport, Ryde and Sandown is provided by Southern Vectis bus route 8.

Bembridge railway station, which was located in the north-west of the village close to the harbour served the village, with services to Brading, until 1953. The station became derelict and was demolished around 1970.
==Religion==

Bembridge is served by the Holy Trinity Church, built in the 1840s as a replacement for an 1827 church that had become unstable. St Luke&#x27;s Mission Church opened as a chapel of ease to Holy Trinity Church in 1887, along with Bembridge Methodist Church and St Michael&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church.

==Bembridge Boarding Campus==
Bembridge School was taken over by Ryde School with Upper Chine in 1996, which turned the site into Bembridge Boarding Campus. This site also houses Kingswood Centre, which operates Kingswood during term-time and Camp Beaumont during school holidays, although it is closed for a few weeks in the winter.

==New House Bembridge School==

New House Bembridge School is a Grade II Listed Building. Bembridge School Chapel is a Grade IIGV Listed Building featuring Edward Woore stained glass.

<doc id="856962" wikidata="Q276553" url="?curid=856962" title="Boyana Church">
<text>The Boyana Church () is a medieval Bulgarian Orthodox church situated on the outskirts of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, in the Boyana quarter. In 1979, the building was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.

The east wing of the two-story church was originally constructed in the late 10th or early 11th century, then the central wing was added in the 13th century under the Second Bulgarian Empire, the whole building being finished with a further expansion to the west in the middle of the 19th century. A total of 89 scenes with 240 human images are depicted on the walls of the church.

== History and architecture ==

The Boyana Church was built in three stages: in the late 10th to early 11th, the mid-13th, and the mid-19th centuries. The oldest section (the eastern church) is a small one-apse cross-vaulted church with inbuilt cruciform supports. It was built in the late 10th or the early 11th century.

The second section, which adjoins the eastern church, was commissioned by Sebastocrator Kaloyan and his wife Desislava in the mid-13th century. This building belongs to the two-floor tomb-church type. It consists of a ground-floor family sepulchre with a semi-cylindrical vault and two arcosolia on the north and south walls, and of an upper-floor family chapel identical in design to the eastern church. The exterior is decorated with ceramic ornaments.

The last section was built with donations from the local community in the mid-19th century.
The church was closed to the public in 1954 in order to be conserved and restored. It was only partially reopened in 2006.

As a protection measure, air-conditioning was installed to keep the temperature at 17–18 degrees Celsius (62–64 Fahrenheit), with low-heat lighting. Groups of up to 8 visitors are permitted to stay for 10 minutes. The building, placed under the management of the National Historical Museum (Bulgaria), was fully reopened to the public by Culture Minister Stefan Danailov on October 2, 2008.

== Frescoes ==

Besides the first layer of 11th–12th-century frescoes, of which only fragments are preserved, and the famous second layer of murals from 1259, the church also has a smaller number of later frescoes from the 14th and 16th–17th centuries, as well as from 1882. The frescoes were restored and cleaned in 1912–1915 by an Austrian and a Bulgarian specialist, and again in 1934 and 1944.

The church owes its world fame mainly to its frescoes from 1259. They form a second layer over the paintings from earlier centuries and represent one of the most complete and well-preserved monuments of medieval art in the Balkans.

Eighteen scenes in the narthex depict the life of Saint Nicholas. The painter here drew certain aspects of contemporary lifestyle. In &quot;The Miracle at Sea&quot;, the ship and the sailors&#x27; hats recall the Venetian fleet. The portraits of the patrons of the church — Sebastocrator Kaloyan and his wife Dessislava, as well as those of Bulgarian tsar Constantine Tikh and Tsaritsa Irina, are thought to be among the most impressive and lifelike frescoes in the church, and are located on the north wall of the church.

===First layer===

The first layer of frescoes, which originally covered the entire eastern church, dates from the 11th–12th century. Fragments of those frescoes have been preserved in the lower parts of the apse and the north wall, and in the upper part of the west wall and the south vault.

===Second layer===
According to the donor’s inscription on the north wall of the second section, the second layer of frescoes dates from 1259. Those frescoes were painted over the earlier layer by a team of unknown artists, who also decorated the two floors of the building commissioned by Sebastocrator Kaloyan.

The Boyana Church owes its world fame above all to the frescoes from 1259, which demonstrate the exceptional achievements of medieval Bulgarian culture. The majority of the more than 240 figures depicted here display individuality, remarkable psychological insight and vitality. The frescoes follow the canon of icon-painting established by the Seventh Ecumenical Council held in Nicaea in 787.

The frescoes in the oldest section of the church include a magnificent representation of Christ Pantocrator in the dome. The drum below shows a host of angels, with the Four Evangelists – Matthew, Mark, Luke and John – portrayed in the pendentives. Four images of Christ adorn the face of the arches: Christ Emmanuel; Christ, The Ancient of Days; and the acheiropoietic (“made without hands”) Holy Mandylion and Holy Tile. Next come scenes from the Major Feast Days and the Passions of Christ. Among the full-length portrayals of saints in the first tier, there are ten warrior saints. The Virgin Enthroned, surrounded by archangels, is represented in the altar conch. Below are four church fathers: St. Gregory the Theologian, Basil the Great, John Chrysostom and Patriarch Germanus. The frescoes flanking the altar show the deacons Laurentius, Euplius and Stephen, as well as St. Nicholas, the patron of the ground floor of the church – one of the most popular saints and the patron saint of sailors, merchants and bankers.

The life of St. Nicholas is depicted in 18 scenes in the narthex (the second section of the church). The unknown artists included elements of contemporary life in those scenes, and many of the figures are quite realistic – especially their countenances. The lunette above the entrance of the narthex displays the Virgin and Child, St. Anna and St. Joachim, and Christ Blessing. St. Catherine, St. Marina, St. Theodore the Studite and St. Pachomius are portrayed in the lower tiers on the walls. The south arcosolium features the scene of Christ Disputing with the Doctors, and the north one, the Presentation of the Virgin. Two highly revered Bulgarian saints are also represented in the narthex – St. John of Rila (the oldest surviving representation of the saint) and St. Paraskeva (Petka). The hermit St. Ephraim Syrus appears among the monks portrayed here. The expressive realistic portraits of the donors Sebastocrator Kaloyan and his wife Dessislava, and of the Bulgarian Tsar Constantine Asen Tikh and Tsaritsa Irina – painted with precision, extraordinary skill and feeling – are among the oldest portraits of figures from Bulgarian history.

==== Authorship ====

Today the name “Boyana Master” stands for the team of unknown artists who decorated the church and mastered their art in the studios of the Turnovo School of Painting. Boyana is the only and the most impressive wholly preserved monument of the Turnovo School of Painting from the 13th century. According to many leading experts, the world famous frescoes in the Boyana Church played an important role in the development of mediaeval Bulgarian and European painting.

A name, possibly that of a painter, was discovered during restoration works in 2006–2008. National History Museum director Bozhidar Dimitrov stated: &quot;The renovation revealed a rare inscription under a layer of plaster on one of the church walls: &#x27;I, Vasiliy inscribed&#x27;. The 13th-century &#x27;Boyana master&#x27; was the only painter among the kings and nobles whose names were regularly read out during sermons at the church.&quot; Restorator Grigoriy Grigorov stated &quot;The Christian Orthodox religion forbids the painter from manifesting himself, as in the eyes of the priests it is God who guides his hand. But this painter inscribed his name, knowing that the believers could not see it.&quot; Other historians and archaeologists are less convinced that the inscription identifies the &quot;master&quot;, since it could equally have been left by an assistant.

===Late frescoes===
Some parts of the church were overpainted, and the majority of those frescoes have survived to the present day. The later frescoes include a scene of the Presentation of the Virgin from the 14th century, a portrait of St. Nicholas from the 16th–17th century, and representations of the two patron saints of the Boyana Church – St. Nicholas and St. Panteleimon – from 1882.

<doc id="856967" wikidata="Q319296" url="?curid=856967" title="Madara Rider">
<text>The Madara Rider or Madara Horseman (, &quot;Madarski konnik&quot;) is a large early medieval rock relief carved on the Madara Plateau east of Shumen in northeastern Bulgaria, near the village of Madara. The monument is dated to the very late 7th or more often the very early 8th century, during the reign of the Bulgar Khan Tervel. In 1979, the monument was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== Description ==
The relief sculpture depicts a majestic horseman, approximately above ground level, carved into an almost vertical cliff. The sculpture is almost life-size. The horseman, facing right, is thrusting a spear into a lion lying at his horse&#x27;s feet, and on the left a dog is running after the horseman. The carving of the horseman&#x27;s halo and garments, as well as the bird in front of the horseman&#x27;s face, are barely recognizable due to centuries of erosion and the generally poor condition of the monument. The relief is similar to the carbon images found in Saltovo, Soulek, Pliska and Veliki Preslav.

=== Origin tradition ===
The meaning and symbolism of the sculpture is uncertain, as well as its actual masonry tradition and cultural source.

The relief probably incorporates elements of both autochthonous Thracian and the newly arrived Bulgars&#x27; particular cults. The monumental size and iconography, and many of the specific details (stirrup, halo, skull-cup, bird, etc.) are generally part of Bulgar tradition, while the rightward direction and the lion are more typical of Thracian tradition.

Some early researchers have considered it an example of the Thracian horseman – a recurring motif of a deity in the form of a horseman in the Paleo-Balkanic mythology. The motif typically features a caped horseman astride a steed, with a spear poised in his right hand. He is often depicted as slaying a beast with a spear, although this feature is sometime absent. Initially considered (and later abandoned) by Konstantin Josef Jireček and Karel Škorpil, this assumption was gradually rejected because of differences in the iconographic details, and the relation with the animals (there&#x27;s no dog).

Many scholars connect the origin of the relief with the ethnogenesis of the Bulgars, a semi-nomadic equestrian warrior culture from the Eurasian Steppe. Others have seen in the relief a resemblance to the Sasanian rock relief tradition. The hero-horseman is a common character of Turkic and Iranian-Alanic mythology. It is sometimes considered that the horseman represents or is related to the Bulgar deity Tangra, while Vladimir Toporov related it to the Iranian deity Mithra.

Still others have noted a simpler explanation: that the relief was intended to represent Khan Tervel (701–718 AD), or, once considered likely but now usually rejected, Khan Krum (802–814 AD).

=== Archaeology ===
In 1924–1935, beneath the relief (some 250 m north) were found the remnants of a complex believed to have served as a pagan shrine (three-aisled church) and a rectangular building, probably the ruler&#x27;s private dwelling, where the ruler did sacral rituals related to Tangra. At the site was also found a damaged inscription by Khan Omurtag which mentions the deity Tangra.

The complex is commonly dated to the second quarter of the ninth century, as the 1970s excavations dated the pottery between the 8th and the 10th centuries. Some argue that the earliest buildings were founded after the conversion to Christianity. Thus the pagan temple (i.e. church) and the building would have been built on an early Byzantine basilica. To the west of the building was found evidence of a Christian burial, with a golden decorated belt, dated c. 900 AD.

Later in the 20th century, two miles (c. 3.2 km) northeast from the relief was found another group of buildings consisting of a 5th–6th century basilica with inner rectangular structure, which some have interpreted as the pagan temple (though without clear evidence).

== Inscriptions ==
Three partially preserved texts in Medieval Greek, carved in the rock, can be found around the image of the rider. They bear important information regarding the history of Bulgaria in the period. The oldest inscription is the work of Tervel (701–718 AD), thus it is considered that the relief was created during his rule or immediately after the Bulgars settled the region in 680–681 AD. The other inscriptions refer to the Khans Krum (802–814 AD) and Omurtag (814–831 AD), who are most likely the ones who ordered the carvings.

Inscription I:

&quot;Justinian the emperor made a treaty [...] the Bulgars [...] and came to Tervel. My uncles at Thessaloniki did not trust the emperor with the cut-off nose and went back to the Kisiniie [...] one of his [...] The ruler Tervel made a treaty and gave to the emperor five thousand [...] with my help the emperor scored a fine victory.&quot;

Inscription II:

&quot;[...] gold. He gave eighteen [...] gold the ruler [...] soldiers [...] a ruler [...] the Greeks (Byzantines) [...] what I gave to you, I will give you every year, and the emperor sent to the ruler [...] and asked the ruler Krumesis [...] the ruler [...] divided the gold [...] began [...] he gave from [...] the ruler Krumesis gave [...] that sea [...] you did [...] the ruler [...] war they tore the treaties [...] war [...] then [...] name [...]&quot;

Inscription III:

&quot;[...] he was raised [...] tore and Omurtag the ruler set by god sent [...] help to me [...]&quot;

Inscription IV:

&quot;Khan sybigi Omurtag, ruler from god [...] was [...] and made sacrifice to god Tangra [...] itchurgu boila [...] gold [...]&quot;

== Legacy ==
The Madara Rider is depicted on the obverse of smaller Bulgarian coins (1 to 50 stotinki) issued in 1999 and 2000.

A June 29, 2008, official survey on the design of Bulgaria&#x27;s future euro coins was won by the Madara Horseman with 25.44 percent of the votes.

Madara Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after the historic site of Madara.

<doc id="856969" wikidata="Q702612" url="?curid=856969" title="Stalin Line">
<text>The Stalin Line was a line of fortifications along the western border of the Soviet Union (USSR). Work began on the system in the 1920s to protect the USSR against attacks from the west. The line was made up of concrete bunkers and gun emplacements, somewhat similar to, but less elaborate than the Maginot Line. It was not a continuous line of defense along the entire border, but rather a network of fortified districts, meant to channel potential invaders along certain corridors.

In the aftermath of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, with the westward expansion of the USSR in 1939 and 1940 into Poland, the Baltic, and Bessarabia, the decision was made to abandon the line in favour of constructing the Molotov Line further west, along the new border of the USSR. A number of Soviet generals felt that it would be better to keep both lines and to have a defence in depth, but this conflicted with the pre-World War II Soviet military doctrine.
Thus, the guns were removed, but were mostly in storage as the new line began construction. The 1941 Axis invasion caught the Soviets with the new line unfinished and the Stalin Line largely abandoned and in disrepair. Neither was of much use in stopping the onslaught, though parts of the Stalin Line were manned in time and contributed to the defense of the USSR.

Following World War II, the line was not maintained, in part due to its wide dispersal across the USSR. Unlike Western Europe, where similar fortifications were demolished for development and safety reasons, much of the line survived beyond the breakup of the USSR in 1991 due to being ignored. Today, the remains of the Stalin Line fortifications are located in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine (plus possibly the eastern parts of Moldova).

<text>The Basilica di San Lorenzo (Basilica of St. Lawrence) is one of the largest churches of Florence, Italy, situated at the centre of the main market district of the city, and it is the burial place of all the principal members of the Medici family from Cosimo il Vecchio to Cosimo III. It is one of several churches that claim to be the oldest in Florence, having been consecrated in 393 AD, at which time it stood outside the city walls. For three hundred years it was the city&#x27;s cathedral, before the official seat of the bishop was transferred to Santa Reparata.

San Lorenzo was the parish church of the Medici family. In 1419, Giovanni di Bicci de&#x27; Medici offered to finance a new church to replace an eleventh-century Romanesque rebuilding. Filippo Brunelleschi, the leading Renaissance architect of the first half of the fifteenth century, was commissioned to design it, but the building, with alterations, was not completed until after his death. The church is part of a larger monastic complex that contains other important architectural and artistic works: the Old Sacristy (&quot;Sagresta Vecchia&quot;) by Brunelleschi and having interior decoration and sculpture by Donatello; the Laurentian Library by Michelangelo; the Medici Chapels, two structures that include the New Sacristy (&quot;Sagrestia Nuova&quot;) based on Michelangelo&#x27;s designs; and the larger Cappella dei Principi (&quot;Chapel of the Princes&quot;) being a collaboration between the family and architects.

== History ==
The Basilica of San Lorenzo is considered a milestone in the development of Renaissance architecture. The basilica has a complicated building history. The project was begun around 1419, under the direction of Filippo Brunelleschi. Lack of funds slowed the construction and forced changes to the original design. By the early 1440s, only its sacristy (now called the Old Sacristy) had been worked on because that was being paid for by the Medici. In 1442, the Medici stepped in to take over financial responsibility of the church as well. After Brunelleschi&#x27;s death in 1446, the job was handed either to Antonio Manetti or Michelozzo; scholars are uncertain which. Although the building was largely completed by 1459 in time for a visit to Florence by Pius II, the chapels along the right-hand aisles were still under construction during the 1480s and 1490s.

By the time the building was completed, aspects of its layout and detailing no longer corresponded to the original plan. The principal difference is that Brunelleschi had envisioned the chapels along the side aisles to be deeper than those built and he intended them to resemble the chapels in the transept, the only part of the building that is known to have been completed as Brunelleschi designed it.

== The building in Renaissance architecture ==
The Basilica of San Lorenzo demonstrates many innovative features of the developing style of Renaissance architecture, 
*a simple mathematical proportional relationship using the square aisle bay as a module and the nave bays in a 2x1 ratio 
*the use of an integrated system of column, arches, and entablatures, based on Roman Classical models
*the use of Classical proportions for the height of the columns
*a clear relationship between column and pilaster, the latter meant to be read as a type of embedded pier
*the use of spherical segments in the vaults of the side aisles
*the articulation of the structure in &quot;pietra serena&quot; (Italian: “serene stone”)
According to one scholar, features such as the interior&#x27;s Corinthian arcades and ceiling&#x27;s flat panels mark &quot;a departure from the Gothic and a return to the Romanesque Proto-Renaissance.&quot;

At times, the design of San Lorenzo has met with criticism, particularly when compared with Santo Spirito, also in Florence and which is considered to have been constructed more or less in conformity with Brunelleschi&#x27;s ideas, even though he died before most of it was built. By the sixteenth century, Giorgio Vasari commented that along the nave, the columns should have been elevated on plinths. The steps along the aisles, supporting the pilasters, also have been considered to deviate from Classical ideals.

== Outer and inner façades ==
The Medici Pope Leo X gave Michelangelo the commission to design an outer façade of the basilica in white Carrara marble in 1518. Michelangelo made a large wooden model that shows how he adjusted the classical proportions of the Façade, drawn to scale, after the ideal proportions of the human body, to the greater height of the nave. 
Although the outer Façade of the basilica remained unbuilt, Michelangelo&#x27;s large wooden model of it remains. 

Michelangelo did design and build the internal Façade of the basilica that is seen from the nave looking back toward the entrances. It comprises three doors between two pilasters with garlands of oak and laurel and a balcony on two Corinthian columns.

In recent years, the association of &quot;Friends of the Elettrice Palatina&quot; and the Comune of Florence re-visited the question of completing the outer Façade of the basilica according to Michelangelo&#x27;s designs. To assist with the public debate, a computerized reconstruction was projected onto the plain brick Façade in February 2007. As yet, no decision has been made regarding a project use Michelangelo&#x27;s design to build the outer facade following his wooden model.

The campanile dates from 1740.

== Old Sacristy ==
Opening off the south transept of the basilica is the square, domed space, the &quot;Sagrestia Vecchia&quot;, or Old Sacristy, that was designed by Brunelleschi (1377–1446) and that is the oldest part of the present church and the only part completed in Brunelleschi&#x27;s lifetime. It contains the tombs of several members of the Medici family. It was composed of a sphere on top of a cube; the cube acting as the human world and the sphere as the heavens.

== New Sacristy ==
Opposite the Old Sacristy in the north transept of the basilica is the &quot;Sagrestia Nuova&quot; (New Sacristy), begun in 1520 by Michelangelo, who also designed the Medici tombs within it. That the architect of a building also designed the interior furnishings is a historical novelty in European architecture that is driven by his being a sculptor by training. The new sacristy was composed of three registers, the topmost topped by a coffered pendentive dome. The articulation of the interior walls may be described as early examples of Renaissance Mannerism (see Michelangelo&#x27;s Ricetto in the Laurentian Library). The combination of pietra serena pilasters on the lower register is carried through to the second register; however, in Mannerist fashion, architectural elements &#x27;seem impossible&#x27;, creating suspense and tension that is evident in this example.

Michelangelo completed most of the statuary for the new sacristy as well, however, the statues of the two patron saints planned to accompany the Madonna and Child that were planned for placement on the main wall and the sculptural elements of the two sarcophagi were left undone when he was redirected to another project by the pope, the political situation in Florence changed, and changes later occurred in papal succession. Although the new sacristy was vaulted over by 1524, these circumstances, the temporary exile of the Medici (1527), the death of Giulio, eventually Pope Clement VII, and the permanent departure of Michelangelo for Rome in 1534, meant that Michelangelo never finished the project and he refused to direct completion.

The statues that Michelangelo had carved by the time of his departure had not been put in place and were left in disarray within the chapel. In 1545, they were installed by Niccolò Tribolo. By order of Cosimo I, the remaining work was completed by 1555 by Giorgio Vasari and Bartolomeo Ammannati.

In a statement in a biography of Michelangelo that was published in 1553 by his disciple, Ascanio Condivi, and reportedly is based largely on Michelangelo&#x27;s own recollections, Condivi gives the following description of the sculptures that were planned for the sarcophagi:

The statues are four in number, placed in a sacristy... the sarcophagi are placed before the side walls, and on the lids of each there recline two big figures, larger than life, to wit, a man and a woman; they signify Day and Night and, in conjunction, Time which devours all things... And in order to signify Time he planned to make a mouse, having left a bit of marble upon the work (which [plan] he subsequently did not carry out because he was prevented by circumstances), because this little animal ceaselessly gnaws and consumes just as time devours everything.

=== Concealed corridor discovered ===
In 1976, a concealed corridor with drawings by Michelangelo on its walls was discovered under the New Sacristy.

In 1527 the citizens of Florence rebelled against the Medicis; Michelangelo supported them. After the Medicis recaptured the city in 1530, Pope Clement VII, a Medici, sentenced Michelangelo to death. It is thought that Michelangelo hid for two months in a small chamber under the Medici chapels in the Basilica of San Lorenzo with light from just a tiny window, making many charcoal and chalk drawings which remained hidden until the room was rediscovered in 1975, and opened to small numbers of visitors in 2023. Michelangelo was eventually pardoned by the Medicis and the death sentence lifted, so that he could complete work on the Sistine Chapel and the Medici family tomb. He left Florence for Rome in 1534.

== Cappelle Medicee ==


The most celebrated and grandest part of San Lorenzo is the &quot;Cappelle Medicee&quot; (Medici Chapels) in the apse. The Medici were still paying for it when, in 1743, the last living member of the family, Anna Maria Luisa de&#x27; Medici, died. In 1742, she had commissioned Vincenzo Meucci to paint the &quot;Glory of Florentine Saints&quot;, a fresco, inside the cupola. Approximately fifty lesser members of the Medici family are buried in the crypt. The final design (1603–1604) was by Bernardo Buontalenti, based on models of Alessandro Pieroni and Matteo Nigetti. Above is the &quot;Cappella dei Principi&quot; (Chapel of the Princes), a great but awkwardly domed octagonal hall where the grand dukes are buried. The style shows Mannerist eccentricities in its unusual shape, broken cornices, and asymmetrically sized windows. In the interior, the ambitious decoration with coloured marble overwhelms the attempts at novel design. Its centre was supposed to feature the Holy Sepulchre, moved from Jerusalem, although attempts to buy and, failing that, to steal it failed.Ref.?

== Cappella Corbelli ==
The Corbelli chapel, in the southern transept, contains a monument by the sculptor Giovanni Dupré to the wife of Count Moltke-Hvitfeldt, formerly Danish ambassador to the Court of Naples.

<text>Pirin National Park (), originally named Vihren National Park, covering the larger part of the Pirin Mountains in southwestern Bulgaria, spanning an area of .

It is one of the three national parks in the country, the others being Rila National Park and Central Balkan National Park. The park was established in 1962 and its territory was expanded several times since then. Pirin National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. The elevation varies from to at Vihren, Bulgaria&#x27;s second highest summit and the Balkans&#x27; third.

The park is situated in Blagoevgrad Province, the nation&#x27;s southwesternmost region, on the territory of seven municipalities: Bansko, Gotse Delchev, Kresna, Razlog, Sandanski, Simitli, and Strumyani. There are no populated places within its territory. Two nature reserves are located within the boundaries of Pirin National Park: Bayuvi Dupki–Dzhindzhiritsa and Yulen. Bayuvi Dupki–Dzhindzhiritsa is among the oldest in Bulgaria, established in 1934 and is included in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves under the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Programme. The whole territory is part of the network of nature protection areas of the European Union, Natura 2000.

Pirin is renowned for its 118 glacial lakes, the largest and the deepest of them being Popovo Lake. Many of them are situated in cirques. There are also a few small glaciers, such Snezhnika, located in the deep Golemiya Kazan cirque at the steep northern foot of Vihren, and Banski Suhodol. They are the southernmost glaciers in Europe.

Pirin National Park falls within the Rodope montane mixed forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic temperate broadleaf and mixed forest. Forests cover 57.3 percent of the parks area and almost 95 percent of them are coniferous forests. The average age of the forests is 85 years. Bulgaria&#x27;s oldest tree, Baikushev&#x27;s pine, is located in the park. With an approximate age of about 1,300 years, it is a contemporary of the foundation of the Bulgarian state in 681 CE. The fauna of the Pirin National Park is diverse and includes 45 species of mammals, 159 species of birds, 11 species of reptiles, 8 species of amphibia, and 6 species of fish.

== History and park administration ==

Pirin National Park was established on 18 November 1962 in order to preserve the natural ecosystems and landscapes along with their plant and animal communities and habitats. Originally named Vihren National Park, the protected area initially covered 67.36 km2. Its territory was expanded several times until it reached its current area of 403.56 km2 in 1999. In 1983, Pirin National Park was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as an area of outstanding natural importance. By the Constitution of Bulgaria, the park is exclusively state-owned.

According to the classification of the International Union for Conservation of Nature the park falls within management category II (national park) with main objective protecting functioning ecosystems while allowing human visitation and its supporting infrastructure. The entire territory of the park is included in the European Union network of nature protection areas Natura 2000. Pirin National Park is listed as an important bird and biodiversity area by BirdLife International.

Pirin National Park is managed by a directorate subordinated to the Ministry of Environment and Water of Bulgaria based in the town of Bansko at the northern foothills of the mountain. As of 2004, the park administration had 92 employees. There are two visitor and information centres located in Bansko and Sandanski. The park is divided in six sectors: &quot;Bayuvi Dupki&quot; with office in Razlog, &quot;Vihren&quot; with office in Bansko, &quot;Bezbog&quot; with office in Dobrinishte, &quot;Trite Reki&quot; and &quot;Kamenitsa&quot;, both with office in Sandanski, and &quot;Sinanitsa&quot; with office in Kresna.

== Geography ==

=== Overview ===

Pirin National Park encompasses much of the homonymous mountain range in southwestern Bulgaria, which forms part of the Rila–Rhodope Massif. To the north it is divided from the Rila mountain range by the Predel Saddle and mountain pass at 1140 m elevation, to the east reaches the valley of the river Mesta, including the Razlog Valley, to the south the Paril Saddle (1170 m) forms the border with the Slavyanka mountain range, and to the west reaches the valley of the river Struma. The park is situated entirely in Blagoevgrad Province in the municipalities of Bansko (36.6% of the park&#x27;s territory), Gotse Delchev (4.9%), Kresna (14.9%), Razlog (10.2%), Sandanski (30.7%), Simitli (2.3%) and Strumyani (0.4%).

=== Relief and geology ===
The tectonics of the Pirin is primarily the result of Precambrian, Hercynian, alpine and tectonic movements and events. The modern relief of Pirin was shaped in the Pleistocene (2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago) when the mountain was subjected to alpine glaciation related to the global cooling. This glaciation passed in parallel with that of the Alps. The limits of the glaciers reached 2200–2300 m. All glacial forms in the mountain range are within the borders of Pirin National Park.

The Pirin mountain range is divided into three sections: northern, middle and southern, with the northern one being the highest and containing all glacial formations and lakes. The park covers the northern section, itself divided into two zones. The northern zone consists of the steep marble Vihren ridge with the three highest summits in the mountain: Vihren (2914 m), Kutelo (2908 m) and Banski Suhodol (2884 m), as well as the ridge Koncheto (2810 m). The southern zone consists of granite ridges and includes Pirin&#x27;s fourth highest summit Polezhan, at 2851 m. There are more around 60 summits above 2600 m.

The relief of Pirin National Park is alpine and highly fragmented and is characterized with steep slopes, high ridges and deep river valleys. The highest point is Vihren at an elevation of 2914 m, the second highest summit in Bulgaria and the third one in the Balkan Peninsula, while the lowest elevation in the park is at 950 m near Bansko. Nearly 60% of the park&#x27;s area is situated above 2000 m. The distribution of the territory of the park by elevation is as follows: up to 1000 m – 1.64 km2 (0.4%), 1000–1600 m – 51.09 km2 (12.7%); 1600–2000 m – 121.08 km2 (30.0%); 2000–2500 m – 198.31 km2 (49.1%); above 2500 m – 31.45 km2 (7.8%). The inclination of the park&#x27;s territory is steep — more than 90% the total area is classified as steep (21–30°) or very steep (above 31°).

Geologically Pirin is a massive anticline formed by metamorphic rocks — gneiss, biotite and crystalline schists, amphibolite, quartzite and marble. Paleozoic granitoid rocks are found in restricted areas in the outskirts of Pirin National Park. Granitoid rocks from the Upper Cretaceous form two distinct plutons: Northern Pirin and Bezbog. The Central Pirin pluton covers the southern reaches of the park and is dated to the Upper Oligocene. The granitoid rocks cover 55% of the park&#x27;s territory.

=== Climate ===

Pirin falls within the continental Mediterranean climate zone and due to its elevation the higher sectors have Alpine climate. The climate is influenced by Mediterranean cyclones mainly in late autumn and in winter, bringing frequent and high rainfall, and by the Azores anticyclone in summer, making the summer months hot and dry. The relief has a crucial influence on the climate. Pirin has three elevation climate zones — low between 600 and 1000 m (16% of the total area), middle between 1000 and 1800 m (40%) and high above 1800 m (44%). The temperature decreases with the elevation, which is more visible in summer. The mean annual temperature is around 9–10 °C in the lower, 5–7 °C in the middle and 2–3 °C in the higher elevation. The coldest month is January with average temperature varying between −5 and −2 °C. The hottest month is July with temperature averaging 20 °C at 1600 m and 15 °C at 2000 m. Temperature inversions, i.e. increase in temperature with height, are observed in 75% of the winter days.

The annual precipitation is 600–700 mm in the lower elevation zones and 1000–1200 mm in the higher ones. The rainfall occurs mostly in winter and spring, while summer is driest season. The air humidity is 60–75% in August and 80–85 % in December. In winter the precipitation is mainly snow, varying from 70–90% at the lower elevations to 100% at higher. The average number of days with snow cover varies from 20–30 to 120–160. The highest thickness of the snow cover reaches 40–60 cm at 1000–1800 m in February and 160–180 cm above 1800 m in March (190 cm on Vihren). In some winters the snow thickness can reach 250–350 cm. Avalanches occur frequently in winter.

=== Hydrology ===
The territory of Pirin National Park is almost equally divided between the basins of the rivers Struma (206.06 km2 or 51.1%) and Mesta (197.50 km2 or 48.9%). The watershed follows the main ridge of the mountain in direction north-west to south-east. Pirin is the source of 10 tributaries to the Struma, the largest one being Sandanska Bistritsa, and another 10 to the Mesta. The rivers are short, steep and with high water volume. They form numerous waterfalls which are generally not as high as those in Rila or the Balkan Mountains. The highest one is Popinolashki waterfall, measuring some 12 m. The average annual discharge of the park&#x27;s rivers is 355,6 million m3, of them 188,5 million m3 flow to the Struma and 167,1 million m3 to the Mesta. The discharge from the park per square kilometre is 2.3 times larger than Pirin&#x27;s average and 5.6 times larger than Bulgaria&#x27;s average.

The landscape is dotted with 118 permanent glacial lakes, conventionally divided into 17 groups, such as Popovo Lakes, Kremenski Lakes, Banderishki Lakes, Vasilashki Lakes, Valyavishki Lakes, Chairski Lakes, Vlahini Lakes or Tipitski Lakes. The largest of them is Popovo Lake with 123,600 m2, which makes it Bulgaria&#x27;s fourth largest glacial lake. With a depth of 29.5 m, it is also Pirin&#x27;s deepest lake and Bulgaria&#x27;s second. Situated at an elevation of 2710 m the Upper Polezhan Lake is the highest one in the mountain and in the country.

Another remnant from the last Ice Age are two small glaciers. Snezhnika is located in the deep Golemiya Kazan cirque at the steep northern foot of Vihren and is the southernmost glacier in Europe. Banski Suhodol Glacier is larger and situated a bit to the north below Koncheto Ridge.

== Biology ==

=== Ecosystems and forests ===

Pirin National Park falls within the Rodope montane mixed forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic temperate broadleaf and mixed forest. The plant communities in the park can be classified into several main groups: communities found around bodies of water; bush communities of the subalpine zone; grasslands, including meadows, subalpine and alpine pastures; forest communities; rock communities; and communities of secondary character, which are a result of human activity.

Forests cover 231.10 km2 or 57.3% of the park&#x27;s total area. Of them 95% are coniferous forests and 5% are deciduous forests. The mean age of the forest is 85 year. Around 34.3% of the wooded territory is covered with trees above 140 years. The oldest tree in Bulgaria, the 1300–year Baikushev&#x27;s pine of the species Bosnian pine (&quot;Pinus heldreichii&quot;), is found in the park and is a contemporary of the foundation of the Bulgarian state in 681 AD.

There are 16 tree species; of them three are Balkan endemic taxa with limited areal — the Bulgarian fir (&quot;Abies borisii-regis&quot;), Macedonian pine (&quot;Pinus peuce&quot;) and Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii). The largest area is occupied by dwarf mountain pine (&quot;Pinus mugo&quot;) – 59.62 km2, Macedonian pine (&quot;Pinus peuce&quot;) – 54.15 km2, Norway spruce (&quot;Picea abies&quot;) – 23.79 km2, European beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot;) – 10.98 km2 and Bosnian pine – 8.93 km2. The Macedonian and the Bosnian pines in Pirin National Park constitute respectively 42% and 52% of their total area in Bulgaria.

=== Flora ===

The flora of the park is diverse and is characterized with high endemism due to the combination of southern geographic latitude and high elevational variation. The varied relief creates various ecological environments for plants, further diversified by the dominant rock types which form siliceous and calcareous terrain on the territory of the park. Lakes and streams also diversify the conditions creating wetland habitats for hygrophyte species.

Non-vascular plants constitute the least researched part of Pirin&#x27;s flora. The least studied of them are the algae with 165 species, including two endemics. The largest concentration of algae species is found in Popovo and Kremenski lake groups. The Bryophytes, including mosses, are represented by 329 known species. The number of lichen species is 367, or 52% of Bulgaria&#x27;s total diversity. Of them 209 species are found in the coniferous forests and 156 — on calcareous terrain.

The vascular plants in Pirin National Park include 1315 species of 94 families and 484 genera, or approximately 1/3 of Bulgaria&#x27;s flora. The flora has largely preserved its indigenous character. The number of vascular plant species is expected to grow in case of future detailed research, especially at lower elevations. The species are divided almost equally to representatives of the sub-Mediterranean and Circumboreal floristic regions. The number of species included in the Red Book of Bulgaria is 114. There are 18 species endemic to the park and another 17 are restricted only to Bulgaria, which makes a total of 35 Bulgarian endemic species. The park is also home to 86 Balkan endemic species.

The endemic species restricted to the park are: Pirin poppy (&quot;Papaver degenii&quot;), Pirin meadow-grass (&quot;Poa pirinica&quot;), Urumov oksitropis (&quot;Oxytropis urumovii&quot;), Kozhuharov oksitropis (&quot;Oxytropis kozhuharovii&quot;), Banderishka lady&#x27;s mantle (&quot;Alchemilla bandericensis&quot;), Pirin lady&#x27;s mantle (&quot;Alchemilla pirinica&quot;), Kelererova asineuma (&quot;Asyneuma kellerianum&quot;), Pirin sandwort (&quot;Arenaria pirinica&quot;), Pirin sedge (&quot;Carex pirinensis&quot;), Pirin fleabane (&quot;Erigeron vichrensis&quot;), David mullein (&quot;Verbascum davidoffii&quot;), lesser Pirin fescue (&quot;Festuca pirinica&quot;), Pirin hogweed (&quot;Heracleum angustisectum&quot;), Yavorkova rattle (&quot;Rhinanthus javorkae&quot;), Pirin thyme (&quot;Thymus perinicus&quot;), &quot;Daphne domini&quot;, &quot;Daphne velenovskyi&quot;.

=== Fauna ===

The vertebrate fauna of Pirin National Park consists of 229 species. The number of mammal species is 45. The distribution of the mammalian species by order is as follows: Insectivora – 5, Chiroptera – 16, Lagomorpha – 3, Rodentia – 7, Carnivora – 9 and Artiodactyla – 4. The European snow vole is a relict species. Among the species of highest conservation value are brown bear, gray wolf, wildcat, European pine marten, wild boar, red deer, roe deer and Balkan chamois. The small mammals, especially rodents and bats, are not fully studied in the whole territory of the park.

The total number of bird species is 159. Of them 91, or 57%, are passerine. Three species are relict — boreal owl, white-backed woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. The park&#x27;s rarest residents are lesser spotted eagle with a single nesting pair, booted eagle, golden eagle with 2 to 5 pairs, short-toed snake eagle with two pairs, saker falcon, peregrine falcon with three pairs, western capercaillie, hazel grouse, rock partridge, corn crake, Eurasian woodcock and stock dove.

There are 11 reptile and 8 amphibian species. There are Central European species (fire salamander, yellow-bellied toad, smooth snake), Palearctic (common toad, European green toad, common frog), Euro-Siberian (European tree frog, common European viper, grass snake, viviparous lizard), Irano-Turanian (marsh frog), Southern European (agile frog), Euro-Mediterranean (European green lizard), Mediterranean (common wall lizard) and Balkan (Erhard&#x27;s wall lizard).
The ichthyofauna includes 6 fish species: common minnow, European eel (considered extinct), western vairone, brown trout, rainbow trout and brook trout. The limited number of species is determined by the high elevation of the park. The glacial lakes, streams and upper river courses are inhabited by few fish species. The western vairone is known only from the Kremenski lakes and might in fact represent a new undescribed species.

The number of identified invertebrate species in Pirin National Park is 2091, which is 40% of the estimated 4500 species to inhabit the park. They are poorly researched and there is not enough data to assess the qualitative and quantitative parameters even of the main populations of endemic and relict species. There are 218 endemic, 176 relict and rare 294 species.

The Araneae are represented by 321 species, or 35% of Bulgaria&#x27;s total. The spiders prefer the north-eastern slopes and are most diverse in the coniferous forests. There are 36 species of Myriapoda, or 20% of Bulgaria&#x27;s total. They are distributed mainly in the forests and are less frequent in the sub-Alpine and the Alpine zones. The Mollusca are 89 species and represent 27% of the nation&#x27;s total (excluding the marine molluscs). Only 2% of Bulgaria&#x27;s Ephemeroptera are found in the park — two species. The number of Orthopterida species is 63, or around 30% of the nation&#x27;s total. The highest diversity is found in the valleys of the rivers Banderitsa and Damyanitsa. The Plecoptera are represented by 40 species, forming 40% of Bulgaria&#x27;s diversity. There are 323 Heteroptera species, or 32% of the ones known in Bulgaria. They are most diverse in the northern parts of the park, in the Bayuvi Dupki–Dzhindzhiritsa Reserve. The Coleoptera are 639 species and this number it is estimated to raise to 1800–1900. The Neuropterida are 25 species, or 20% of Bulgaria&#x27;s total diversity. There are 36 Hymenoptera species, found mainly at lower elevations. The Trichoptera are 59 species, or 24% of Bulgaria&#x27;s total. The Lepidoptera are 449, including 116 butterflies and 333 moths. Some of the most spectacular butterflies are the mountain Apollo (&quot;Parnassius apollo&quot;), clouded Apollo (&quot;Parnassius mnemosyne&quot;), false Eros blue (&quot;Polyommatus eroides&quot;), mountain Alcon blue (&quot;Phengaris rebeli&quot;), large blue (&quot;Phengaris arion&quot;), scarce tortoiseshell (&quot;Nymphalis xanthomelas&quot;), Titania&#x27;s fritillary (&quot;Boloria titania&quot;), eastern large heath (&quot;Coenonympha rhodopensis&quot;), Cynthia&#x27;s fritillary (&quot;Euphydryas cynthia&quot;), etc.

== Recreation ==

Pirin National Park is a popular tourist destination. The park&#x27;s main information center is in Bansko and houses an interactive exhibit on the park&#x27;s forests, allowing visitors to acquaint themselves with facts about the park&#x27;s vegetation and wildlife. There is also a 30-seat projection room with multimedia equipment. As of 2002 on the territory of the park there were 1837 beds, including 885 in mountain refuges, 214 in hotels, 124 in bungalows and 615 in premises belonging to different departments of the state administration. Some of the refuges include Bezbog, the largest and most modern one; Banderitsa, constructed in 1915 by order of Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, and Vihren.

There are 20 marked hiking trails in the park. Trail No. 1 is part of the E4 European long distance path and crosses the park following the itinerary Predel Refuge–Yavorov Refuge–Vihren Refuge–Tevno Lake–Pirin Refuge–Popov Grasslands. The most challenging hiking trail follows the top of the Koncheto ridge at an elevations of approximately 2,810 m, between the peaks Banski Suhodol (2,884 m) and Kutelo (2,908 m). The north-western side of Koncheto is almost vertical and 300–400 m deep, while the south-western side is less steep (approximately 30 degrees) but reaches 800 m in depth.

== Development and Environmental Risks ==
There are many factors which threaten the ecosystems in the park. Rock quarries, wildland arson, industrial and illegal logging, poaching, excessive trail use, vehicle access, and most notably the ski resorts have put the park under significant threat.

There has been a steady development of skiing infrastructure since the early nineties along the northeast of the range, most notably in the town of Bansko, which has become an international winter resort. In 2003, a large forested portion of the Todorka peak and the nearby ridges were cleared to begin the construction of the resort which today has 13 ski lifts and 75 km of slopes. The expansion of the resort took place even though the park legislature strictly forbids such activity in the park&#x27;s limits. Since the building started, Bansko has experienced severe flooding of the Glazne river, due to the intervention.

In December 2017, the Bulgarian government, without warning changed the legislature of the park so that commercial logging and construction of roads and buildings within 50% the park is made legal. This sparked a wave of protests against the continuous tampering with the world heritage site, which have continued throughout February and March 2018. The protests were supported by Ska Keller who is vice-president of the Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament. In November 2017, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other local NGOs filed a lawsuit against the Bulgarian Ministry of the Environment and Water as they deemed that plans for development of the area violated environmental regulations.

<text>Johannes Albrecht Blaskowitz (10 July 1883 – 5 February 1948) was a German &quot;Generaloberst&quot; during World War II. He was a recipient of the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. After joining the Imperial German Army in 1901, Blaskowitz served throughout World War I, where he earned an Iron Cross for bravery. 

During WWII, Blaskowitz led the 8th Army during the Invasion of Poland and was the Commander in Chief of Occupied Poland from 1939 to 1940. He wrote several memoranda to the German high command speaking out against SS atrocities, and he handed out death sentences to SS members for crimes against Polish civilians. Based upon these actions against the SS, Adolf Hitler personally limited Blaskowitz&#x27;s future advancement. He commanded Army Group G during the Allied invasion of Southern France and Operation Nordwind, the last major German offensive of World War II on the Western Front. Blaskowitz later commanded the remnants of Army Group H as it withdrew to Northern Netherlands before surrendering to Allied forces.

After the war, he was charged with war crimes in the High Command Trial at Nuremberg. He died by suicide during the trial on 5 February 1948.

==Early years==
Johannes Blaskowitz was born on 10 July 1883 in the village of Paterswalde, (East Prussia), Germany (now Bolshaya Polyana in the Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia). He was the son of a Protestant pastor, Hermann Blaskowitz, and his wife Marie Blaskowitz, née Kuhn. In 1894, Blaskowitz joined cadet school at Köslin (now Koszalin, Poland) and afterwards at Berlin Lichterfelde. In 1901, he started his military career as a supreme officer candidate cadet in an East Prussian regiment in Osterode (Polish: Ostróda).

During World War I, Blaskowitz served on the Eastern and Western Fronts and was employed in the General Staff. He rose to command an infantry company by 1918, and was awarded the Iron Cross for bravery.

==Interwar period==
Blaskowitz&#x27;s war service secured him a place in the small postwar Reichswehr during the Weimar Republic, through whose ranks he rose to the rank of General. His attitude towards the Nazis&#x27; seizure of power in 1933 was reportedly indifferent because he believed that the armed forces should be &quot;politically neutral&quot;.

In early 1939 he commanded the German forces that occupied Czechoslovakia, and was promoted to General of Infantry and given command of the 8th Army just prior to the outbreak of World War II. He was mocked because of the poor Czech language used in the first decree as the occupation commander. It was immediately replaced by the corrected version of the decree.

==Invasion of Poland==

During the invasion of Poland, the 8th Army under Blaskowitz&#x27;s command was responsible for the northern part of the front under Army Group South, led by Gerd von Rundstedt. The 8th Army saw heavy combat during the Battle of the Bzura and later besieged the Polish capital of Warsaw. On 28 September 1939, Blaskowitz accepted the surrender of General Tadeusz Kutrzeba and the Polish forces in Warsaw. After the campaign, he was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross, promoted to Generaloberst and appointed as Commander-in-Chief East in Poland on 20 October 1939.

As a traditional soldier, Blaskowitz kept firm control on the men under his command in their dealings with civilians and was opposed to Army participation in war crimes by the SS and &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;. He handed out death sentences to members of the SS for crimes against the civilian population, which were rescinded by Adolf Hitler. Between November 1939 and February 1940 he wrote several memoranda to higher military officials, in which he detailed SS atrocities in Poland, their negative effects on Wehrmacht soldiers, the insolent attitude of the SS toward the army and warned that the SS &quot;might later turn against their own people in the same way.&quot; However, his protests failed to produce results, and merely earned him the enmity of Hitler, Hans Frank, Reinhard Heydrich and Heinrich Himmler, while Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl dismissed them as naive and &quot;uncalled for&quot;.

Commander-in-Chief Walther von Brauchitsch forwarded Blaskowitz&#x27;s first memorandum to Hitler on 18 November, who launched a tirade against Blaskowitz, denouncing his concerns about due process as &quot;childish&quot; and poured scorn on his &quot;Salvation Army attitude.&quot; In February 1940, Blaskowitz prepared a list of 33 complaints against the SS. Among his complaints were strip searches and rape of Jewish women, a whipping orgy in Nasielsk affecting 1,600 Jews, and a clear case of race mixing committed by a junior SS officer. Blaskowitz concluded that &quot;It is a mistake to massacre some 10,000 Jews and Poles, as is being done at present; for—so far as the mass of the population is concerned—this will not eradicate the idea of a Polish state, nor will the Jews be exterminated.&quot; Blaskowitz was relieved of his command on 29 May 1940. Having thus encountered Hitler&#x27;s wrath, Blaskowitz was the only Generaloberst at that time who was not promoted to Generalfeldmarschall in summer 1940 after the fall of France.

==Occupation of France==
Following the Fall of France in May 1940, Blaskowitz was initially slated to command the 9th Army for occupation duties, but the appointment was blocked by Hitler and instead he was appointed to a relatively minor position as Military Governor of Northern France, a position he held until October 1940, when he was transferred to the command of the 1st Army, on the southwest coast between Brittany and the Pyrenees. 

On 10 November 1942, the 1st and 7th Army under Blaskowitz&#x27;s command launched &quot;Case Anton&quot;, the military occupation of Vichy France. The 1st Army advanced from the Atlantic coast, parallel to the Spanish border, while the 7th Army advanced from central France towards Vichy and Toulon. The 50,000-strong Vichy French Army took defensive positions around Toulon, but when confronted by German demands to disband, it did so since it lacked the military capability to resist. By the evening of 11 November, German tanks had reached the Mediterranean coast. &quot;Anton&quot; marked the end of the Vichy regime as a nominally independent state. However, Blaskowitz&#x27;s forces failed to secure the Vichy French fleet at Toulon, which was scuttled by the French.

In May 1944, following the appointment of Gerd von Rundstedt as Commander-in-Chief in the West, Blaskowitz was appointed the head of Army Group G. This comparatively small command, consisting of the 1st Army and the 19th Army, was given the task of defending southern France from the imminent Allied invasion. When in Normandy, he managed to convince Field Marshal Erwin Rommel that the &quot;rumours&quot; Rommel had heard about atrocities on the Eastern Front were actually true.

According to historian Christopher Clark, in France, Blaskowitz tried to &quot;build a constructive relationship with the local population&quot;, even though the conditions for him to do so were worse than in Poland. He encouraged the troops deployed to support French agriculture to act &quot;selflessly&quot;. On the one hand, he tried to ensure that German counterinsurgency would be conducted in accordance with international norms as far as possible. He publicly distanced himself from units that committed the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre. On the other hand, when the prefects in Toulouse complained about crimes against civilians in &quot;counter-terrorism&quot; procedures conducted by the SS, Blaskowitz defended the right of the German army to defend itself, even though he admitted sometimes innocent people were harmed: &quot;..He recommended that the French authorities be told that &quot;it is imperative that innocent people sometimes fall victim to the bullet [...]. Against such a struggle [namely on the part of the partisans of the Resistance], the Wehrmacht must and will defend itself under all the means of power at its disposal.&quot; After the July Bomb Plot, he sent a note that proclaimed loyalty to Hitler. Clark speculates that he might have feared that he was suspected. There was no evidence that suggests Blaskowitz ever protested the deportation of Jews from France. Although army appraisal forms, compiled by Rundstedt, described him as a National Socialist, Christopher Clark opines that Blaskowitz likely never had any ideological attachment to Nazism. According to Clark, professionalism enabled Blaskowitz to follow his own principles even against the political Zeitgeist, but the same professionalism made him unsuitable for political resistance. After a visit in October 1943, German resistance member Ulrich von Hassell lamented that it was not fruitful to discuss with Blaskowitz who saw everything from a military point-of-view. From this &quot;very bounded standpoint&quot;, whatever one thought about the regime&#x27;s moral character became overshadowed by duty to his superiors and his troops, as well as the people whose fate &quot;now hung in balance.&quot;

==Campaign in the West 1944–45==
The invasion of southern France commenced on 15 August 1944, with Operation Dragoon, when Allied forces landed on the Riviera between Toulon and Cannes. Blaskowitz&#x27;s forces had been weakened by the relocation of its divisions to other fronts and the replacement of its soldiers with third-rate &quot;Ostlegionen&quot; outfitted with obsolete equipment. Although badly outnumbered and lacking air defence, Blaskowitz brought up troops, stabilized the front, and led a fighting withdrawal to the north to avoid encirclement. U.S. Army units pursued Blaskowitz&#x27;s forces up through the Vosges mountains before pausing to regroup and refuel in early September. There, Blaskowitz&#x27;s troops were reinforced by the 5th Panzer Army under Hasso von Manteuffel. Blaskowitz was in overall command of German forces defending Nancy, although the city was encircled and fell on 15 September 1944, most of the German forces escaped encirclement.

By September 1944, Army Group G was pushed back to the Alsace region, near the German border. Blaskowitz wanted to entrench his forces, but Hitler ordered him to immediately counterattack George S. Patton&#x27;s U.S. Third Army. Both Manteuffel and Blaskowitz realized the futility of such an action, but obeyed orders. Their attack near Arracourt caught U.S. forces in disarray and pushed them back to near Lunéville on 18–20 September, at which point resistance stiffened and the attack was suspended. As a result, Hitler summarily relieved Blaskowitz, replacing him with Hermann Balck. The halt of the Third Army in September allowed Blaskowitz&#x27;s forces to strengthen the fortress of Metz. Patton&#x27;s forces first reached the fortress at Metz on 5 September 1944, forcing a German surrender on 21 November 1944. The battle of Metz took over 10 weeks, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. An attempt by Third Army to seize Fort Driant just south of Metz was also defeated. Blaskowitz reviewed Patton&#x27;s decision to launch a headlong attack straight into the fortifications of Metz by saying: &quot;A direct attack on Metz was unnecessary. The Metz fortress area could have been masked. In contrast a swerve northward in the direction of Luxemburg and Bitburg would have met with greater success and caused our 1st Army&#x27;s right flank collapse followed by the breakdown of our 7th Army.&quot;

Balck was unable to stop the Third Army&#x27;s advance, and in late December he was relieved of command of Army Group G, Blaskowitz was recalled to his previous command and ordered to attack in Alsace-Lorraine in support of the ongoing Ardennes offensive. The goal of the offensive was to destroy the Seventh United States Army and French First Army, as well as seize Strasbourg. On 1 January 1945, in Operation Nordwind, Army Group G attacked the Seventh Army, forcing them to withdraw. However, the Germans were halted near Haguenau in late January and failed to achieve its main objectives.

Blaskowitz was subsequently transferred to the Netherlands on 30 January, where he succeeded Kurt Student as commander of Army Group H. For the following three months he conducted a fighting withdrawal against the British 2nd Army, and was awarded the Swords to his Knight&#x27;s Cross. This command was redesignated in early April 1945 and Blaskowitz became commander-in-chief of the northern (still occupied) part of the Netherlands. During the Dutch famine of 1944–45, Blaskowitz allowed air corridors for Allied airdrops of food and medicine to the Dutch civilian population.

On 5 May Blaskowitz was summoned to the Hotel de Wereld in Wageningen by Lieutenant-General Charles Foulkes, (commander of I Canadian Corps), to discuss the surrender of the German forces in the Netherlands. Prince Bernhard, acting as commander-in-chief of the Dutch Interior Forces, attended the meeting. Blaskowitz agreed with all proposals by Foulkes. However, nowhere in the building – some sources say nowhere in the whole town – could a typewriter be found. Thus, the surrender document could not be typed. The next day, both parties returned and, in the presence of both Foulkes and Prince Bernhard, Blaskowitz signed the surrender document, which in the meantime had been typed.

==Indictment and trial==
Blaskowitz was tried for war crimes at the High Command Trial (Case No. 12), one of the subsequent Nuremberg trials. In one notorious case he was accused of ordering the execution of two deserters after the German surrender. He died by suicide on 5 February 1948. After breaking away from his guards, he jumped off a balcony into the inner courtyard of the court building. During the Nuremberg trials, Blaskowitz and Werner von Blomberg, Minister of War during the years leading to World War II, signed affidavits declaring that:Both the indictment and the suicide have since been considered an enigma by scholars because Blaskowitz almost certainly would have been acquitted on all counts and had been told by his defence to expect to be acquitted. According to Hans Laternser, the defence counsel for the lead defendant, Wilhelm von Leeb, the prosecution told him, &quot;Blaskowitz did not need to do that as he would certainly have been acquitted&quot;. That led to Laternser questioning the indictment. According to Clark, Blaskowitz could have counted on an acquittal. Historian Jen Scholten states in Norbert Frei&#x27;s book on the elites of Nazi Germany, that the Nuremberg judges expressly saw Blaskowitz as a positive example of how Wehrmacht officers could have behaved.

<text>A racing bicycle, also known as a [[road bike]], is a bicycle designed for competitive road cycling, a sport governed by and according to the rules of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI).

Racing bicycles are designed for maximum performance while remaining legal under the UCI rules. They are designed to minimise aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, and weight, and balance the desire for stiffness for pedaling effiency with the need for some flexibility for comfort. Racing bicycles sacrifice comfort for speed compared to non-racing bicycles. The drop handlebars are positioned lower than the saddle to put the rider in a more aerodynamic posture. The front and back wheels are close together so the bicycle has quick handling, which is preferred by experienced racing cyclists. The derailleur gear ratios are closely spaced so that the rider can pedal at their optimum cadence. However, racing bicycles must retain the ability to maneuver safely within a tightly-packed peloton, and be sufficiently comfortable to ride for races of six hours or more.

Bicycles and most wheels ridden in professional competition must be type-approved by the UCI, and made available for commercial sale. It is common for professional road cycling teams to use prototype bicycles and equipment before they become commercially available.

Racing bicycles are generally legal for use on public roads and are widely used for non-racing fitness and utility riding.

== Distinction between road bicycles and others ==
Bicycles for racing on velodromes are track bicycles; bicycles for racing off-road are mountain bicycles, cyclo-cross bicycles, gravel bicycles or cycle speedway bicycles; bicycles that race according to the rules of the International Human Powered Vehicle Association include faired recumbent bicycles which, on flat ground, are the fastest bicycles in the world. Recumbents were excluded from the UCI definition of a bicycle on 1 April 1934.

Time trial bicycles are a subset of road bicycles that are designed for time trial events. The UCI rules for these bikes are slightly less prescriptive than those for &quot;massed start road races&quot; (see rules 1.3.020 to 1.3.023).

Triathlon bicycles are governed by International Triathlon Union (ITU) rules, which allow more recent technological developments than do the UCI rules.

Due to the lower air resistance and better body stance for pushing, road bicycles are more efficient for smooth road use. Cyclo-cross bicycles, used for racing on off-road circuits, are closer to racing bikes than mountain bikes. They have wider, treaded tires and are less efficient than racing bikes at higher speeds on sealed roads. Gravel bicycles evolved from cyclo-cross bicycles and are drop-bar bicycles designed for riding on maintained but unsealed roads, often over very long distances.

==Frame==
The frame of a road bicycle must, according to the UCI regulations, be constructed using a &quot;main triangle&quot; with three straight tubular shapes—the top tube, down tube, and seat tube. These three tubes, and other parts of the frame, need not be cylindrical, however, and many racing bicycles feature frames that use alternative shapes. Traditionally, the top tube of a racing bicycle is close to parallel with the ground when the bicycle is in its normal upright position. Some racing bicycles, however, have a top tube that slopes down towards the rear of the bicycle; the &quot;compact&quot; frame geometry was popularized by Giant.

Frame manufacturers are free to use any material they choose in the frame. For most of the history of road racing, bicycle frames were constructed from steel tubing, and aluminium and titanium alloys were also used successfully in racing bicycles. Racing bicycles in these three materials are still commercially available and are still used by some amateur racing cyclists or in vintage racing classes. However, virtually all professional road racing cyclists now use frames constructed from various carbon fiber composite materials, and a typical modern carbon fiber frame weighs less than 1 kg (2.2 lbs).

Particularly since the introduction of carbon fiber frames, the shape of the tubes that make up the frame has increasingly diverged from the traditional cylinder, either to modify the ride characteristics of the bicycle, reduce weight, or simply achieve styling differentiation. However, a recent trend in road bicycle frame design is tubing claimed to reduce aerodynamic drag, adopting many design features from time trial bicycles, and the majority of top-level teams use bikes with aerodynamic tube shaping at least some of the time.

Unlike mountain bikes, most road bicycles do not have a dedicated suspension. The majority of damping is provided by the tires, padding in a cyclist&#x27;s clothing, seat, and handlebar tape. Wheels, frames, and forks provide a limited amount of flex, and manufacturers tune the thickness and construction of frame tubing to offer the best compromise between a stiff frame (desired for pedalling efficiency, particularly when sprinting) and ride comfort. Additionally, a few manufacturers offer racing bicycles using additional flexing points or vibration-absorbing materials at key points in the frame for additional comfort.

== Wheels and tires ==
Most road bicycles use 700C bicycle wheels (622 mm bead seat diameter), with matching tyres that are 23-28 mm wide. Wider tires became more common over the 2010s, as more sophisticated measurement showed that wider tires increase rider comfort, improve grip, and decrease rolling resistance without unduly affecting aerodynamics.

The wheels greatly affect the performance of a racing bike. The rim of the wheel can be shaped for greater aerodynamic efficiency making a triangular cross-section to form a teardrop with the tire. 

For aerodynamics and rotating weight, it is generally better to reduce the number of spokes in the wheel. For high-end wheelsets, the spokes can be shaped to have a bladed cross-section, further reducing wind resistance.

The most common wheel material for professional racing is now molded carbon fiber rims being a popular choice for pro-level racers and enthusiasts. Aluminium rims are still widely used outside racing and by some less well-funded amateur racers. Carbon fiber rims are lighter than the same shape in aluminium, allowing riders to choose &quot;deeper&quot;, more aerodynamic rims without an unacceptable weight penalty. Race-grade wheelsets are very expensive and often fragile. Riders who race often choose to own at least two pairs of wheels: a heavier, more durable, and cheaper wheelset for training, and a lighter, more aerodynamic wheelset for racing. Racers with sufficient resources may have multiple racing wheelsets to choose from depending on the course and weather conditions; deeper rims lose their aerodynamic advantage, and are hard to control, in high crosswinds, and on mountainous courses the lightest possible wheelset may be preferred by some riders.

To reduce both air resistance and rolling resistance on the road, tires are lightweight, narrow, and have a thin, smooth tread. Track racing tires can be inflated up to circa . Tires for road racing used to be inflated to pressures almost as high in the belief that this minimised rolling restistance. However, it was discovered that on real road surfaces, much lower tyre pressures or around , depending on rider weight and conditions, result in both a more comfortable ride and lower rolling resistance. Until recently, most racing bikes used tubular tires which have no beads: they are sewn around the tube and glued to the rim. These tires provide an advantage in weight (lacking the relatively heavy wire bead), grip and pinch flat protection, but their greatest advantage lies in the ability to use a very lightweight simple box-section rim, rather than the U-shaped clincher rim. A U-shaped clincher rim must be made of relatively heavier gauge material to prevent the tire pressure from spreading the inherently weak U shape and allowing the tire to come off the rim. Advances in tire technology, however, have seen the far more practical (due to greater ease of changeability) clincher (beaded) tire close the gap. Some teams are using tubeless tires, which are claimed to offer the resistance to pinch flats of tubular tires, as well as greater ease of fitment and lower rolling resistance than tubulars.

Wheel moment of inertia is a controversial subject. In this article: wheel theory, the author does some calculations on wheel effects. Moment of inertia changes result in a decrease in watts of between .004 and .022%, while lower mass provided between .2 and .46%, and better aerodynamics provided between .6 and 1.8% decrease in power. Based on this it can be argued that wheel moment of inertia effects are neither noticeable nor important. At the same time, a product launched in 2008 to dynamically alter the rotating inertia of bicycle wheels claims to have &quot;outperformed the standard, equivalent wheel by 5.6 seconds per mile&quot; (or about 3.5 seconds per km).

==Components==
Road bike components are collectively referred to as the groupset. The quality of the groupset determines how refined the bike feels, how much maintenance it requires, and contributes to the performance of the bike. The three major groupset manufacturers of complete groupsets for racing bicycles are Shimano, SRAM, and Campagnolo. Some companies only produce specific components of the groupset, such as Full Speed Ahead (often abbreviated to FSA). The companies have different design strategies, and some cyclists have great brand loyalty for one or the other.

In the early 1990s, Shimano introduced dual-control with a system called Shimano Total Integration (STI). STI is characterized by its combined brake and shift levers, or &quot;brifters&quot;. Previously, the shifters were mounted on the stem, handlebar ends or the down tube of the frame. Dual control addressed the problem of having to reposition a hand to change gears. STI was followed by the competing Campagnolo/Sachs Ergolever. SRAM uses a technology known as Double Tap for their integrated shifter/brake lever.

In the mid 1990s Mavic, known for their wheelsets, introduced an electronic shifting system which was pioneered in the Tour de France by American Greg LeMond and later on by Briton Chris Boardman, who liked the fact that the system allowed him to shift from his aerobars and his brake levers. The system did not catch on due to technological hurdles. In 2009, Shimano commercially released the Dura-Ace Di2 electronic shifter, and Campagnolo and SRAM followed suit in the early 2010s. As of 2022, the vast majority of top-level professional teams use electronic shifting, as do many amateur riders. Mechanical derailleurs remain popular with amateur racers and recreational riders for cost reasons.

Groupset manufacturers have gradually increased the number of gears on racing bicycles, allowing a greater range between the highest and lowest gears while maintaining relatively small gaps between each successive gear. As of 2022, most racing bicycles used in professional racing have 2 front chainrings and 11 or 12 gears on the rear cassette.

Carbon fiber has also become more popular for components. Shimano, Campagnolo and SRAM have introduced carbon fiber for their high-end shifters and brake levers, cranks, and parts of their derailleurs. Carbon fiber stems, handlebars, shoe soles, forks and seatposts are also more commonplace, including integrated stem/handlebar combinations. The advantages of carbon fiber are low weight as well as increased vibration damping leading to a more comfortable ride.

As of 2022, the majority of professional teams use hydraulic disc brakes for most or all races. A few top-level professional teams still use bikes with caliper brakes in mountain stages, as their disc-brake models are significantly heavier than the UCI&#x27;s legal minimum weight of 6.8 kg. Disc brakes offer better stopping performance, particularly in wet conditions. For many years, racing bicycles were required to use caliper brakes by UCI regulation, but manufacturers began producing road bikes with disc brakes for recreational use in the mid-2010s, and their use was trialled in professional racing in 2016 and 2017. Rider disquiet over the crash safety of disc brakes led to the introduction of versions with chamfered edges to reduce the risk of the rotating disc acting as a cutting blade. In 2018, the UCI concluded the trial and legalised the use of disc brakes in all road racing events.

==Non-competitive uses==
Road bicycles are built for casual recreational use, often labeled as &quot;sportif&quot; bicycles or &quot;dropped-bar fitness bikes&quot;. These have much in common with a competitive racing bicycle, but the frame geometry is relaxed to make the bicycle more comfortable over long distances, though less effective for short bursts of speed. They usually have a wider range of gear ratios (with greater gaps between each ratio) and fewer high-tech racing features.

For recreational road cycling, the road-style bicycles with drop handlebars used to be the norm in the 1980s, along with the &quot;touring bicycle&quot; (a drop-handlebar bike with a slightly longer wheelbase to provide a smoother ride and less sensitivity to steer and balance disturbances). These designs, called &quot;road bikes&quot; or colloquially, &quot;roadies&quot; or &quot;racing bikes&quot;, have become less popular in recent years. The Mountain bike geometry, with its straight handlebars and upright sitting position (resembling the city bike), have moved into the high-performance spaces, and high production volumes have brought down costs significantly.

==UCI rules==
The UCI rules currently specify that a road bicycle have the following characteristics:
* be a vehicle with a front wheel steered by a handlebar and a rear wheel driven by a system comprising pedals and a chain by the legs moving in a circular movement
* that the only points of support are the following: the feet on the pedals, the hands on the handlebars and the seat on the saddle
* wheels must be of equal diameter, between 70 cm and 55 cm, and must have minimum 12 spokes; spokes can be round, flattened or oval, as far as no dimension of their sections exceeds 10 mm
* maximum length 185 cm
* maximum width 50 cm
* the peak of the saddle must be at least 5 cm behind a vertical plane passing through the bottom bracket spindle
* the saddle must be between 24 cm and 30 cm in length
* the distance between the bottom bracket spindle and the ground must be between 24 cm and 30 cm
* the distance between the vertical passing through the lower bracket spindle and the front wheel spindle must be between 54 cm and 65 cm
* the distance between the vertical passing through the bottom bracket spindle and the rear wheel spindle must be between 35 cm and 50 cm
* the maximum internal distance between the front fork ends is 10.5 cm, and of the rear stays 13.5 cm
* minimum mass 6.8 kg (14.99 lb)
* frame must be built around a main triangle, constructed of tubular elements (that may have non-circular cross-sections) such that the form of each encloses a straight line
* The maximum height of the frame elements shall be 8 cm and the minimum thickness 2.5 cm. The minimum thickness shall be reduced to 1 cm for the chain stays and the seat stays. The minimum thickness of the elements of the front fork shall be 1 cm; these may be straight or curved. The top tube may slope, provided that this element fits within a horizontal template defined by a maximum height of 16 cm and a minimum thickness of 2.5 cm

Note that the regulations regarding the dimensions of the bike are allowed exception, given that the rider can demonstrate a morphological need for the exception based on limb size or other factors.

These rules effectively and purposely rule out recumbent bicycles, and have done so since 1934.

<text>The Apperson was a brand of American automobile manufactured from 1901 to 1926 in Kokomo, Indiana.

==Company history==
The company was founded by the brothers Edgar and Elmer Apperson shortly after they left Haynes-Apperson; for a time they continued to use a FR layout-mounted flat-twin engine, following it with a horizontal four.

==Apperson cars==
In 1904, Apperson offered vertical fours in two models. The 1904 &quot;Apperson Touring Car&quot; was a touring car model. Equipped with a tonneau, it could seat 6 passengers and sold for US$6000. The vertical-mounted straight-4, situated at the front of the car, produced 40 hp (29.8 kW). A 4-speed transmission was fitted. The steel-framed car weighed 2800 lb (1270 kg). The wheel base was 96 inches. The Apperson offered electric lights, a novelty for the time, and used a modern cellular radiator. The 25 hp (18.6 kW) version weighed 1800 lb (816 kg) and sold for US$3500.

In 1906 the company cataloged a 95 hp (71 kW) four at $10,500. The next year the first of the famed Jackrabbit speedsters rolled off the line; this was a 60 hp (45 kW) that sold for $5000. For a time, the entire range was known as the &quot;Jack Rabbit&quot; - in 1913 a 32.4 hp (24 kW) four and a 33.7 hp (25 kW) six were listed, and a 33.8 hp (25 kW) 90-degree V-8 of 5.5 L (5502 cc/335 in3) followed in 1914.

==Roadplane models introduced==
In 1916 the company announced production of the &quot;Roadplane&quot; six and eights. The term &quot;Roadplane&quot; did not refer to a specific model but was a marketing concept devised by Elmer Apperson that was applied to the &quot;Chummy Roadster&quot; and the &quot;Touring&quot; car. Elmer took the unusual step of patenting the &quot;Chummy Roadster&quot; design (see:&quot;U.S. Patent 48359&quot;).

The &quot;Silver-Apperson&quot;, designed by Conover T. Silver, was launched in 1917; the model was known as the &quot;Anniversary&quot; after 1919. A sedan proprietary with six cylinders of 3.2 L (3243 cc/197 in3) appeared in 1923, and a Lycoming eight-cylinder was offered beginning in 1924.

==Final production==
By 1924, Apperson and Haynes were both losing sales; a rumored remarriage came to naught, and Apperson folded for good despite the introduction of four-wheel brakes on the 1926 models.

<doc id="856991" wikidata="Q503387" url="?curid=856991" title="Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo">
<text>The Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo (, &quot;Ivanovski skalni tsarkvi&quot;) are a group of monolithic churches, chapels and monasteries hewn out of solid rock and completely different from other monastery complexes in Bulgaria, located near the village of Ivanovo, south of Rousse, on the high rocky banks of the Rusenski Lom, above the river. The complex is noted for its beautiful and well-preserved medieval frescoes. The churches are inside Rusenski Lom Nature Park.

==History==

The caves in the region had been inhabited by monks from the 1220s, when it was founded by the future Patriarch of Bulgaria Joachim I, to the 17th century, where they hewed cells, churches and chapels out of solid rock. At the peak of the monastery complex, the number of churches was about 40, while the other premises were around 300, most of which are not preserved today.

Second Bulgarian Empire rulers such as Ivan Alexander and Ivan Asen II frequently made donations to the complex, as evidenced by donor portraits in some of the churches. Other patrons included nobles from the capital Tarnovo and nearest big medieval town Cherven, with which the monastery complex had strong ties in the 13th and 14th century. It was a centre of hesychasm in the Bulgarian lands in the 14th century and continued to exist in the early centuries of the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria, but gradually decayed.

The Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979.

==Preserved heritage==
The monastery complex owes much of its fame to 13th- and 14th-century frescoes, preserved in five of the churches, which are thought of as wonderful examples of Bulgarian mediaeval art. The rock premises used by the monks include the St Archangel Michael Chapel (&quot;The Buried Church&quot;), the Baptistery, the Gospodev Dol Chapel, the St Theodore Church (&quot;The Demolished Church&quot;) and the main Church, with the 14th-century murals in the latter one being arguably the most famous of all in Ivanovo and noted as some of the most representative examples of Palaeologan art. 

Many century-old inscriptions have also been preserved in the monastical premises, including the famous indented inscription of the monk Ivo Gramatik from 1308–1309.

<text>The Apple Eight was a short-lived American automobile manufactured by the Apple Motor Car Company in Dayton, Ohio, from 1915 to 1917. The Apple 8 model cost $1,150 and had . An inline eight-cylinder engine and three-speed transmission were in a unit. Well-tested standard vendor parts were used. The body had a wheelbase and could seat five. It was advertised as a luxury car and used the slogan &quot;No hills too steep. No roads too rough&quot;.

William A. Apple formed W. A. Apple Auto Top Company in 1912 to make tops for the Ford Model T. In 1915 he changed the name to W. A. Apple Motor Car Co. and began assembling the Eight in May. By September he had assembled 40. A fire on October 11, 1915, completely destroyed the factory. After suing his insurance company, in 1917 William A. was awarded $28,014.31. He returned to car tops and upholstery. A successor business, W. A. Apple Textile Manufacturer, built parachutes during World War II.

<doc id="856996" wikidata="Q1752950" url="?curid=856996" title="List of lakes and lochs of the United Kingdom">
<text>The list of lakes, lochs, loughs and llyns of the United Kingdom is a link page for some large lakes of the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), including lochs fully enclosed by land.

Lakes in Scotland are called &quot;lochs&quot;, and in Northern Ireland &quot;loughs&quot; (pronounced the same way, i.e. (/lɒç/)). In Wales a lake is called a &quot;llyn&quot;. The words &quot;loch&quot; and &quot;lough&quot;, in addition to referring to bodies of freshwater (&quot;lakes&quot;), are also applied to bodies of brackish water or seawater, which in other countries or contexts may be called fjord, firth, estuary, bay etc. In particular, the term &quot;sea-loch&quot; is used in Scotland in this way, as the English language equivalent of &#x27;fjord&#x27;. (There are many examples, including Loch Carron, Loch Torridon etc.) 

Some of the largest lakes in England and Wales are man-made reservoirs or lakes whose size has been increased by damming.

==Largest water bodies in the United Kingdom==

This table includes the ten largest fresh water bodies by area. Lough Neagh is the largest water body in the UK by this measure, although Loch Ness is the largest by volume and contains nearly double the amount of water in all the lakes of England and Wales combined. Loch Morar is the deepest of the UK&#x27;s lakes and Loch Awe the longest. Murray and Pullar (1910) note that the mean depth of Loch Ness is 57.4% of the maximum depth – higher than in any other large deep loch in Scotland. The deepest lake in England is Wast Water which descends to 76 metres (249 ft).

<text>Bamburgh Castle, on the northeast coast of England, by the village of Bamburgh in Northumberland, is a Grade I listed building.

The site was originally the location of a Celtic Brittonic fort known as &quot;Din Guarie&quot; and may have been the capital of the kingdom of Bernicia from its foundation 420 to 547. In that last year, it was captured by King Ida of Bernicia. After passing between the Britons and the Anglo-Saxons three times, the fort came under Anglo-Saxon control in 590. The Normans later built a new castle on the site, which forms the core of the present one. After a revolt in 1095 supported by the castle&#x27;s owner, it became the property of the English monarch.

In the 17th century, financial difficulties led to the castle deteriorating, but it was restored by various owners during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was finally bought by the Victorian era industrialist William Armstrong, who completed its restoration. The castle still belongs to the Armstrong family and is open to the public.

==History==
===Medieval history===

Built on top of a black crag of volcanic dolerite, and part of the Whin Sill, the location was previously home to a fort of the indigenous Celtic Britons known as &quot;Din Guarie&quot;. It may have been the capital of the kingdom of Bernicia, the realm of the Gododdin people, from the realm&#x27;s foundation until 547, the year of the first written reference to the castle. In that year the citadel was captured by the Anglo-Saxon ruler Ida of Bernicia (Beornice) and became Ida&#x27;s seat.

The castle was briefly retaken by the Britons from his son Hussa during the war of 590 before being retaken later the same year. Circa 600, Hussa&#x27;s successor Æthelfrith passed it on to his wife Bebba, from whom the early name &quot;Bebbanburh&quot; was derived.
The Normans built a new castle on the site, which forms the core of the present one. William II unsuccessfully besieged it in 1095 during a revolt supported by its owner, Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumbria. After Robert was captured, his wife continued the defence until coerced to surrender by the king&#x27;s threat to blind her husband.

Bamburgh then became the property of the reigning English monarch. Henry II probably built the keep as it was complete by 1164. Following the Siege of Acre in 1191, and as a reward for his service, King Richard I appointed Sir John Forster the first Governor of Bamburgh Castle. Following the defeat of the Scots at the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross in 1346, King David II was held prisoner at Bamburgh Castle.

During the civil wars at the end of King John&#x27;s reign, the castle was under the control of Philip of Oldcoates. In 1464 during the Wars of the Roses, it was subject to a nine-month siege by Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, the &quot;Kingmaker&quot;, on behalf of the Yorkists which was marked by the extensive use of artillery.

===Modern history===

The Forster family of Northumberland continued to provide the Crown with successive governors of the castle until the Crown granted ownership (or a lease according to some sources) of the church and the castle to another Sir John Forster in the mid-1500s, after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The family retained ownership until Sir William Forster (d. 1700) was posthumously declared bankrupt, and his estates, including the castle, were sold to Lord Crew, Bishop of Durham (husband of Sir William&#x27;s sister Dorothy) under an Act of Parliament to settle the debts in 1704.

Crewe placed the castle in the hands of a board of trustees chaired by Thomas Sharp, the Archdeacon of Northumberland. Following the death of Thomas Sharp, leadership of the board of trustees passed to John Sharp (Thomas Sharp&#x27;s son) who refurbished the castle keep and court rooms and established a hospital on the site. In 1894, the castle was bought by the Victorian industrialist William Armstrong, who completed the restoration.

During the Second World War, pillboxes were established in the sand dunes to protect the castle and surrounding area from German invasion and, in 1944, a Royal Navy corvette was named HMS &quot;Bamborough Castle&quot; after the castle. The castle still remains in the ownership of the Armstrong family.

After the War, the castle became a Grade I Listed property. The description included this comment about the status of the building in 1952 and its history:Castle, divided into apartments. C12; ruinous when acquired by Lord Crewe in 1704 and made habitable after his death by Dr. Sharpe ... Acquired by Lord Armstrong, who had extensive restoration and rebuilding of high quality by C.J. Ferguson, 1894-1904. Squared sandstone and ashlar.

===Location===

About to the south on a point of coastal land is the ancient fortress of Dunstanburgh Castle and about to the north is Lindisfarne Castle on Holy Island. Inland about 16 miles (26 km) to the south is Alnwick Castle, the home of the Duke of Northumberland.

===Environmental factors===
Air quality levels at Bamburgh Castle are excellent due to the absence of industrial sources in the region. Sound levels near the north–south road passing by Bamburgh Castle are in the range of 59 to 63 dBA in the daytime (&quot;Northumberland Sound Mapping Study&quot;, Northumberland, England, June 2003). Nearby are breeding colonies of Arctic and common terns on the inner Farne Islands, and of Atlantic puffin, European shag and razorbill on Staple Island.

===Archaeology at Bamburgh===
Archaeological excavations were started in the 1960s by Brian Hope-Taylor, who discovered the gold plaque known as the Bamburgh Beast as well as the Bamburgh Sword. Since 1996, the Bamburgh Research Project has been investigating the archaeology and history of the Castle and Bamburgh area. The project has concentrated on the fortress site and the early medieval burial ground at the Bowl Hole, located in sand dunes to the south of the castle, evidence of which had first been revealed in a storm of 1817.

During excavations at the Bowl Hole between 1998 and 2007, the remains of 120 individuals from the 7th and 8th century were discovered in that graveyard. The research project was led by Professor Charlotte Roberts of Durham University, and found remains of individuals who had originated from Ireland, Scotland, Scandinavia, the Mediterranean and North Africa.

Finally, in 2016, they were moved into the crypt of St Aidan&#x27;s Church, Bamburgh; the crypt can be viewed by visitors through a small gate.

===Armstrong and Aviation Artefacts Museum===
The castle&#x27;s laundry rooms feature the Armstrong and Aviation Artefacts Museum, with exhibits about Victorian industrialist William Armstrong and Armstrong Whitworth, the manufacturing company he founded. Displays include engines, artillery and weaponry, and aviation artefacts from two world wars.

== Civil parish ==
Bamburgh Castle was a civil parish, in 1951 the parish had a population of 18. Bamburgh Castle was formerly a township in Bambrough parish, from 1866 Bamburgh Castle was a civil parish in its own right until it was abolished on 1 April 1955 and merged with Bamburgh.

==In popular culture==
===Selected literary appearances===
The castle features in the ballad &quot;The Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh&quot; written in circa 1270. Late medieval British author Thomas Malory identified Bamburgh Castle with &quot;Joyous Gard&quot;, the mythical castle home of Sir Launcelot in Arthurian legend.

In literature, Bamburgh, under its Saxon name Bebbanburg, is the home of Uhtred Uhtredson, the main character in Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;The Saxon Stories&quot;. It features either as a significant location or as the inspiration for the protagonist in all books in the series, starting with &quot;The Last Kingdom&quot;, and the sequels &quot;The Pale Horseman,&quot; &quot;The Lords of the North,&quot; &quot;Sword Song,&quot; &quot;The Burning Land&quot;, &quot;Death of Kings&quot;, &quot;The Pagan Lord&quot;, &quot;The Empty Throne&quot;, &quot;Warriors of the Storm&quot;, &quot;The Flame Bearer&quot;, &quot;War of the Wolf&quot;, &quot;Sword of Kings&quot; and &quot;War Lord&quot;.

The castle and also the village provide the setting for the crime novel &quot;Bamburgh&quot; written by LJ Ross.

While Lake Srebarna was studied many times in the past by foreign biologists, the first Bulgarian scientist to take an interest in the area was Aleksi Petrov, who visited the reserve in 1911. In 1913, the whole of Southern Dobrudja was incorporated in Romania, but was returned to Bulgaria in 1940, when the area was visited once again by Petrov to examine the colonies of birds that nest there.
The area was proclaimed a nature reserve in 1948 and is a Ramsar site since 1975. The reserve was recognized as World Natural Heritage Site under the 1972 Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage and included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1983.

== Legends ==
There are several legends about the origin of the lake&#x27;s name. The one is about a khan named &quot;Srebrist&quot;, who died in the neighbourhood whilst engaging in an unequal battle with the Pechenegs. A second one tells about a boat full of silver (&quot;srebro&quot; in Bulgarian) along the shores of the lake. According to a third one, which is regarded as most plausible, the name comes from the silvery reflections on the lake&#x27;s surface during full moon.

== Flora and Fauna ==

=== Flora ===

There are hydrophyte species such as reed in and around the lake. The reserve is home to 139 plant species, 11 of them are in danger of extinction outside the territory of Srebarna.

=== Fauna ===

A wide variety of fauna exists in the area. 39 mammal, 21 reptile and amphibian and 10 fish species inhabit the reserve, but it is most famous for the 179 bird species that nest on its territory. These species include multiple species of herons and cormorants, the glossy ibis, the Dalmatian pelican, the mute swan, the greylag goose, the marsh harrier and the bluethroat. Small mammals in the reserve include several shrew and mice species.

<text>Aquila Italiana (founded as the and quickly renamed the ) was an Italian automobile manufacturer from 1906 to 1917. The company was renamed again in 1909 to after it was bought by a state – the Marsaglia part came from the name of the bank owner&#x27;s son (Vincenzo Marsaglia, a talented automobile driver).

Designed by , the cars were big four- and six-cylinder models with ioe engines of an advanced type. There was an interruption in construction after 1908, but the company introduced new models in 1911; these featured 4192 cc six-cylinder engines and proved to be successful in many races. Among Aquila Italiana drivers were Meo Constantini (later to join Bugatti at Molsheim, where he became first a racing driver and later the Chef d&#x27;Equipe) and Carlo Masetti (Count Giulio Masetti&#x27;s elder brother).

== Production ==
The company Aquila Italiana produced approximately 1,500 cars (across all models).

<doc id="857015" wikidata="Q3137609" url="?curid=857015" title="Pseudoaneurysm">
<text>A pseudoaneurysm, also known as a false aneurysm, is a locally contained hematoma outside an artery or the heart due to damage to the vessel wall. The injury passes through all three layers of the arterial wall, causing a leak, which is contained by a new, weak &quot;wall&quot; formed by the products of the clotting cascade. A pseudoaneurysm does not contain any layer of the vessel wall.

This differentiates it from a true aneurysm, which is contained by all three layers of the vessel wall, and a dissecting aneurysm, which has a breach in the innermost layer of an artery and subsequent dissection/separation of the tunica intima from the tunica media.

A pseudoaneurysm, being associated with a vessel, can be pulsatile; it may be confused with a true aneurysm or dissecting aneurysm.

The most common presentation of pseudoaneurysm is femoral artery pseudoaneurysm following access for an endovascular procedure, and this event may complicate up to 8% of vascular interventional procedures. Small pseudoaneurysms are capable of spontaneous clotting, while others require surgical intervention.

A pseudoaneurysm may also occur in a chamber of the heart following myocardial damage due to ischemia or trauma. A pseudoaneurysm of the left ventricle is a potentially lethal complication of a heart attack.

==Signs and symptoms==
Pseudoaneurysms usually present as a painful, tender, pulsatile mass. The overlying skin is sometimes erythematous (red). They can sometimes be confused with abscesses. The patient may describe a history of catheterization or trauma, and they may note that the pulsatile mass is gradually expanding.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis should be suspected if the patient has a history of arterial trauma. This can include arterial access for catheterization (i.e., the common femoral artery), blunt trauma (i.e., to an extremity), or penetrating trauma (i.e., gunshot or blast injury). Blunt or penetrating trauma can cause a disruption in the arterial wall, leading to a pseudoaneurysm. A patient with such a history who presents with a painful, pulsatile, tender mass at the site of catheterization or trauma should be suspected to have a pseudoaneurysm. The diagnosis should be confirmed using Duplex ultrasonography, which will reveal arterial blood flow into the pseudoaneurysm. A CT angiogram or conventional angiogram can also diagnose a pseudoaneurysm.

&quot;It is important that the diagnosis be confirmed before any procedures are performed. Incision and drainage of a suspected abscess, which is instead a pseudoaneurysm, could lead to extensive hemorrhage.&quot;

==Locations==

A pseudoaneurysm can form in communication with essentially any artery in the body. With the high volume of cardiac catheterizations performed today, femoral artery pseudoaneurysms, in addition to pseudoaneurysms of arteriovenous fistulas used for hemodialysis, are the most common. These fistulas [or grafts] may get infected and may rupture, leading to massive bleeding and death.

Pseudoaneurysms can form in the legs days, months, or even years after blunt or penetrating trauma.

Although aneurysms and left ventricular aneurysms may involve any wall segment, &quot;aneurysms&quot; in the posterolateral wall are frequently due to pseudoaneurysms. In contrast, the most common location for a true left ventricular aneurysm involves the apex of the heart.

A pseudoaneurysm can also occur in the aorta as a consequence of traumatic aortic rupture.

Outside of the heart, pseudoaneurysms associated with pancreatitis can occur in several of the abdominal vessels, including the superior mesenteric artery, superior pancreaticoduodenal artery, inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery, and others.

==Treatment==
Many options exist for the treatment of pseudoaneurysms. While surgery was the gold-standard treatment in the past, several less-invasive treatment options are popular today.

===Covered stent===
Since the pseudoaneurysm communicates with an artery through a hole in the arterial wall, a covered stent may be placed endovascularly across this hole to &quot;exclude it,&quot; or to prevent it from receiving blood flow from the artery. The covered stent is composed of metal and is covered with Teflon (PTFE) or another sterile fabric-like material. The covered stent remains in place permanently, and the pseudoaneurysm, without a continuous flow of arterial blood, then thromboses. Advantages of this technique are that it has a high success rate without the need for an open surgery. Complications include covered stent migration, persistent leakage of blood into the pseudoaneurysm, fracturing (breaking) of the stent, and infection of the stent or of the arterial insertion site.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi:10.1590/S1677-54492008000300016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultrasound probe compression===
Another option for treatment is ultrasound probe compression of the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. The &quot;neck&quot; of the pseudoaneurysm is the narrow path of blood flow between the artery, through the arterial wall, and into the pseudoaneurysm cavity. The artery, neck, and pseudoaneurysm are seen on ultrasound. The ultrasound probe can be pushed firmly against the patient&#x27;s skin to compress the neck of the pseudoaneurysm for usually about 20 minutes. During this time, the blood within the pseudoaneurysm clots; after the probe is then removed, the pseudoaneurysm will hopefully remain clotted and will not continue to expand. The procedure may be stopped early due to patient discomfort. It is less successful if the patient is obese, since there is more fatty tissue between the skin and the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. It also is less successful if the neck of the pseudoaneurysm is wider, since it is less likely to clot off during the period of compression. Finally, it is also much less successful if the patient is taking aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin), or another anticoagulant, since these would prevent clotting of blood within the pseudoaneurysm. Advantages are that this is the least invasive method of stopping arterial blood flow into a pseudoaneurysm.

===Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection===
In addition to covered stent placement, another popular, minimally-invasive technique used today is ultrasound-guided thrombin injection. Thrombin (factor IIa in the coagulation cascade) is a clotting factor that converts fibrinogen into fibrin, which then polymerizes to form a blood clot. Under ultrasound guidance, thrombin can be injected directly into a pseudoaneurysm, causing it to clot. Advantages are that the technique is relatively easy to perform, is successful, and is minimally invasive. One contraindication to this procedure is if there is an arteriovenous fistula (communication between an artery and vein), in addition to the pseudoaneurysm. This occurs with about 10% of pseudoaneurysms. If this is present, thrombin injected into the pseudoaneurysm could then enter the venous circulation and possibly lead to distant thrombosis.

===Surgical ligation (with or without distal bypass)===
Open surgery may also be performed to remove pseudoaneurysms or prevent them from expanding. If the artery is small and &quot;expendable&quot; - the tissues it supplies have adequate collateral blood flow - then the artery supplying the pseudoaneurysm may be ligated both proximally and distally to the pseudoaneurysm. The pseudoaneurysm may or may not be removed. If the tissues supplied by the artery do not have sufficient collateral flow (the artery is not expendable), then a vein or synthetic graft would have to be anastomosed proximally and distally to allow for continued blood flow around the pseudoaneurysm. Advantages are that the technique has been successful in the treatment of pseudoaneurysms for many years. However, it is more invasive (a large skin incision is necessary), and there is more postoperative pain and a risk for wound infection. One of the less invasive options may be preferred in a patient with many comorbidities, who is at high risk for surgery.

<doc id="857019" wikidata="Q7524427" url="?curid=857019" title="Sinister Dexter">
<text>Sinister Dexter is a long-running comics series in British comics anthology &quot;2000 AD&quot;, created by Dan Abnett and David Millgate.

==Overview==
Set in the near future, it features the exploits of gun sharks (hitmen) Finnigan &quot;Finny&quot; Sinister and Ramone &quot;Ray&quot; Dexter in the city of Downlode, sprawled across Central Europe &quot;like a hit and run victim&quot;. Occasional stories have taken place in other cities, or off planet. The size of Downlode is never specified in the strip, but it appears to stretch from Spain to eastern Europe.

The appearance of the city largely depends on the artist of the particular storyline: often it appears to be styled after the former soviet bloc, with many statues and wide boulevards, plus dilapidated cars such as Trabants and VW Beetles; however, in other strips the city looks clean and futuristic, like the Mega-City One of Judge Dredd stories in the same magazine. The story &quot;London Town&quot; shows that London and Great Britain still exist separate from Downlode.

Police drive generic saloon cars resembling Ford Crown Victorias, painted as the cars of the Los Angeles Police Department; black on bonnet and boot, with DCPD written on the white doors. In early strips the police used hovercars with &quot;Polizei&quot; written on the side, and this hovercraft technology appears in later stories, retrofitted to old cars such as Checker Cabs. Sinister and Dexter themselves drive a 1950s Edsel, this started out as a hardtop but in the story &quot;Alibi of Broadway&quot; had its roof torn off and was re-built as a convertible.

Advanced robots are occasionally seen in the stories, but appear to be very rare, and are usually controlled by humans and are unable to think for themselves. Some characters also have several cyborg implants, including Ramone himself who has a &quot;Fony Headcase&quot; television implanted into his eyes. In one story a malfunction in this temporarily gave him the ability to see in infra-red and detect a small hole in a crime-bosses&#x27; personal forcefield (referred to as a very rare and expensive technology).

The atmosphere of the stories suggests a time of economic recession. Sophisticated army hardware is sold off to the highest bidder, usually criminal gangs. Additionally many strips feature the city looking worn and run-down even in &quot;rich&quot; areas. In the story &quot;Mother &#x27;Lode and the Red Admiral&quot; it is mentioned that Korea has developed cold fusion and become the world&#x27;s richest nation.

Ramone uses a pair of &quot;Ruger Nines&quot;, often drawn as silver 9mm pistols, or occasionally as revolvers. Sinister&#x27;s &quot;Minigun&quot; (not to be confused with General Electric&#x27;s Minigun) has been drawn differently by different artists: small pump-action shotgun, large double-barrelled revolver and small machine pistol. It can fire different kinds of bullets, including high explosives.

The title &quot;Sinister Dexter&quot; is a play on words; in Latin &quot;sinister&quot; means &quot;left&quot; or &quot;on the left side&quot; and &quot;dexter&quot; means &quot;right&quot; or &quot;on the right side&quot;. The term is mentioned in the 1960s Discordian religious book &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;.

The initial inspiration for Sinister Dexter came from Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta&#x27;s characters in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. However Dexter is designed to look like Wesley Snipes.

==Plot==

In early stories the duo work as freelance hit-men, taking contracts from their &quot;fact-totem&quot;, a PDA-like device, and killing people for money. The kingpin of crime in these early stories is Holy Moses Tanenbaum.

Eventually a large price is put on the head of Holy Moses himself, expecting Sinister and Dexter to take the contract he sends hit-men to kill them, after killing these they decide to take the contract, as their reputation would dictate they have to take the toughest jobs. After a battle which results in the duo both being nearly killed Holy Moses is killed and the person who put out the contract is revealed to be his wife, Demi Octavo.

A brief period of gang violence follows as various gangs attempt to take control of the city&#x27;s underworld for themselves. Eventually The Czar, moblord of the Russian mafia calls a conference of gang leaders in an attempt to resolve the situation and hires Sinister and Dexter as security for the meeting. During the meeting, Sinister and Dexter discover that, naturally, every single gang has made plans to assassinate the other gang leaders. After these are fought off The Czar reveals &quot;himself&quot; to be a robot double outfitted with a close-focus nuke in its chest cavity. With the gang leaders dead The Czar is able to take over the underworld for himself.

Following the gang-war, Sinister and Dexter are hired by an accountant working for a Mr Bronsky &quot;Ballpeen&quot; Hammer as protection to &#x27;expedite&#x27; the handover of the year-end accounts. The rendezvous between the accountant and Mr Hammer&#x27;s men in Fred Quimby Municipal Park is violently interrupted by the Department of Taxation, causing the &quot;Infamous Audit Showdown of &#x27;66&quot;. As a result of the carnage, Sinister and Dexter decide to take a holiday and The Czar recommends that they visit a nightclub in Asbestopol known as the Bawdwalk. At the club a pair of hired muscle known as Buddy Boom and Buddy Bing are threatening the club owner, Kilopatra, so Sinister and Dexter step in to help him and scare off the heavies, thus picking themselves up a holiday job.

Kilopatra sends the pair off to pay a visit to local mob-king Philly O&#x27;Fisch, as it was he who sent the two heavies after Kilopatra. Sinister and Dexter kill the two Buddies and warn Philly off Kilopatra under threat of taking one of the many contracts that Philly has on his head. When they return from this job, they run into Demi Octavo who is at the nightclub under a pseudonym, she tells the pair that the word spread that she was the one who put out the hit on Holy Moses Tanembaum so she decided to escape Downlode. The Czar suggested that she head to the Bawdwalk, which convinces Sinister and Dexter that The Czar has set them all up.

The pair invade Philly&#x27;s island lair and kill him and all of his minions and return to Downlode to take out the Czar using a giant, cyborg alligator that ticks (referencing J. M. Barrie&#x27;s Peter Pan). After this, Demi Octavo takes over as mob-queen and hires Sinister and Dexter as her personal guardians.

Stories from now on generally revolve around them protecting her empire, though occasionally they also take contracts from other people. During this time Demi&#x27;s younger sister, Billi Octavo, decides to become a Gunshark, but a misunderstanding results in her killing some respected city dignitaries. During the ensuing police chase Sinister explains the unwritten &quot;Gunshark Code&quot; that they never kill cops or &quot;innocents&quot;. Later Billi hacks into the police database and finds the dignitaries she killed were actually guilty of &quot;perverted&quot; crimes and it had been covered up. She released this data to the media and the police were forced to abandon the hunt. It is also revealed most rank-and-file police officers actually support Gunsharks, because they only kill other criminals which results in less criminals overall.

Later Dexter begins to see visions on his &quot;Headcase&quot; TV which suggest he is a wanted serial killer, the Blemvoi Butcher. It turns out the actual killer also has a &quot;Headcase&quot; and the signals have been transposed. The Butcher lures the pair and two police officers, including the &quot;by-the-book&quot; Tracey Weld, into a trap. Dexter kills the butcher and this eventually leads to his becoming romantically involved with Weld.

In Eurocrash, Demi sees her empire begin to crumble, so plans to marry Prince Guapo and unite the two biggest gangs and restore &#x27;peace&#x27; to Downlode. The wedding gets hijacked by &#x27;syns&#x27; (artificial humanoids) and Finnigan and Ramone fail to protect Demi, who dies. They both blame each other and walk away from their partnership.

Downlode Tales depicts Sinister and Dexter going their own ways, with Dexter joining the &#x27;Ass Kickers&#x27; D.U.R. police unit to avoid jail, and Sinister putting together his &#x27;whack pack&#x27; to avenge Demi&#x27;s killers.

As the city once again descends into turmoil, the pair mentor a trainee Gunshark, Kal Kutter, who accompanies them on several adventures and eventually becomes a highly competent Gunshark in his own right.

Another mob boss, called Apellido, begins to take over the city and sends a huge squad of &quot;bullet monkeys&quot; (inferior but cheaper gunsharks) after Billi Octavo. Sinister attempts to get her out of the city but the other hitmen are chasing the two. Meanwhile, Dexter is with Detective Weld when he hears the news and rushes out of the house with his guns drawn. By chance he is seen by a police officer who tells him to freeze, before going to get out his handcuffs. Dexter misinterprets this as the officer going for his gun and kills him, thereby breaking the gunshark code. He escapes but doesn&#x27;t get very far before being surrounded. Fearful of being tortured in prison a standoff ensues, and he is eventually shot by Weld. Sinister is last seen speeding out of the city, with a wounded Billi octavo in the car, still pursued by the bullet monkeys.

The story line at the end of 2005 (over the instalments &quot;...and Death shall have no dumb minions&quot; and &quot;Festive Spirits&quot;) seemed to suggest that the deadly duo were both dead. However, this didn&#x27;t stop some one-page &quot;gag strips&quot; from appearing in the &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot;

This issue has now been addressed in passing as part of the twist in the, initially apparently unconnected, series &quot;Malone&quot;. The &quot;Festive Spirits&quot; story, in which both appeared as skeletal zombies who were apparently ignored by their old friends, is hinted at merely being one of Malone&#x27;s dreams.

After surviving the showdown with his boss, Apellido, Sinister changed his face and took drugs to try to forget his past, fleeing offworld to Generica. It wasn&#x27;t until Rocky Rhodes told him of his true identity that he returned to Downlode City to get revenge on Apellido making sure he knows that he&#x27;s now alive. It was also revealed that Ramone also survived the shooting but was rendered quadriplegic.

Sinister allowed himself to be captured and was sent to the same prison as Ramone, with a plan to escape. After enlisting the help of two other prisoners, he executes the break-out and escapes with Ramone in a wheelchair. Heading to an old doctor friend it is revealed Ramone has been kept immobilised by an implant in his spine. With this removed, and surviving an attack by another Apellido hit-squad, they head for a run-down lock-up containing the Edsel and their old guns. They collect these and drive back into Downlode to again work as gunsharks, bringing the series full circle.

<text>Riccardo Paletti (15 June 1958 – 13 June 1982) was an Italian motor racing driver. Paletti was killed when he crashed on the start grid in his second Formula One start.

==Life before racing==
Born in Milan, Riccardo Paletti was the son of Gianna and Arietto Paletti, a Milanese entrepreneur who had built his fortune as a real estate developer, and amongst a number of business interests was the importer for Pioneer audio equipment in Italy.

Paletti&#x27;s early sporting interests were broad; he was Italian junior karate champion at thirteen, and was in contention for a place on the Italian national alpine skiing youth team.

==Racing before Formula One==
In 1978 Paletti entered nine races in Formula Super Ford, and in his inaugural race he led for 18 laps. Although he did not win during the first season, he took two second places and finished third in the overall championship. During the end of his first season, he also made his Formula 3 debut in the Italian Championship with a March-Toyota. In 1979, Paletti entered a full F3 championship season, but his best placings were two fifth-place finishes. Later the same year, he competed in a few Formula 2 races for the first time with the team run by Mike Earle. His best result was at Misano, where he finished eighth.

For the 1981 European F2 championship season, Earle severed his collaboration with March to start with Onyx. Paletti tested extensively during the winter, and the effort paid off during the opening rounds of the season, as he qualified 10th in the first race at Silverstone, before finishing second behind Mike Thackwell. He retired in the second round at Hockenheim but set the fastest lap of the race, and his good form continued in round three at Thruxton, where he finished third — this time behind Roberto Guerrero. At that point, he was joint second in the championship with Stefan Johansson, trailing Thackwell by three points. But from then, his results declined, and he finished tenth in the championship.

==Formula One career==
Although still on a learning curve in the lower class racing, Paletti decided to join the uncompetitive team Osella in 1982. He admitted that Formula One struck him with a little bit of fear, but his sponsor, Pioneer, wanted him to move up and Paletti did not want to miss his opportunity. His teammate was the experienced Frenchman driver Jean-Pierre Jarier. He travelled with a personal medical adviser who was monitoring his blood pressure and heartbeat with small sensors attached to his body during testing and practice sessions. His diet was constantly adapted to the results. Few Formula One drivers took this professional approach seriously at the time.

Making his first attempt during the South African Grand Prix in January 1982, Jarier managed to haul his Osella to qualify in the last position on the grid but Paletti was almost two seconds slower, failing to qualify.

For the second round of the season, at the Jacarepaguá circuit near Rio de Janeiro, the venue for the Brazilian Grand Prix, Paletti had to prequalify on Friday morning, but a wheel fell off the Osella after a suspension failure and again he did not make the grid.

The next round of the championship was the US GP West at the street circuit of Long Beach. Jarier found the right set-up for the Osella and managed to put the car in the top ten during qualifying. Paletti was a massive three and a half seconds slower and failed to qualify again.

For the fourth Grand Prix of the season, at Imola on 25 April, amidst a war between the FISA and FOCA, only 14 cars loyal to the organisation started the race. Paletti had managed to beat the ATS of Eliseo Salazar and was supposed to start from the back of the grid. However, on Sunday afternoon Paletti&#x27;s Osella failed to fire up for the warm-up lap and by the time he had left the pits the other cars were already lining up for the start. As a result, the moment he crossed the starting line he was already 49 seconds behind. He never got close to the rest of the field and after seven laps he had to park his car due to another suspension failure.

At Zolder Paletti failed to prequalify on Friday, getting more and more disappointed with the Osella. The new chassis, which was to be introduced at Monaco, gave some promise, but still Paletti knew that qualifying for Monaco was virtually impossible with only twenty entries allowed to start in the narrow streets of the principality. There was only one new monocoque for Jarier and the new rear suspension was delayed. Once again, Paletti failed to prequalify.

On his seventh Grand Prix, in Detroit, Paletti was much closer to Jarier&#x27;s pace and, although the gap was still over a second, he qualified right behind his teammate. However, during the warm-up session Paletti lost a wheel at the beginning. The mechanics tried to repair the car in time for the race and, while there still was the possibility of starting the race in the spare car, that option went up in smoke as well, after Jarier&#x27;s fire extinguisher had gone off accidentally. Jarier took the spare car. This meant it would be a race against time for Paletti&#x27;s mechanics to set up the car and they were still busy when the rest of the field progressed to the grid. But just as the work was finished, with Paletti ready to get in the car, news broke that Jarier had hit the wall, damaged his car and was on his way back to the pits. So Paletti&#x27;s car was ready for Jarier to jump in and start the race from the pit lane, leaving Paletti behind as a spectator once more.

== Death ==
Paletti qualified for the Canadian Grand Prix on Sunday 13 June 1982, the first time he would start successfully in a full line-up. At the start, the lights took an unusually long time to turn to green. During this time, Didier Pironi, who had the pole position, stalled the engine of his Ferrari. Pironi lifted his hand to signal the problem just as the lights switched to green, which was too late to abort the start. The other cars swerved across the track, trying to squeeze past Pironi&#x27;s stationary car. Raul Boesel just clipped the back left of the Ferrari, spinning his March into the path of Eliseo Salazar and Jochen Mass. Salazar, Boesel and Mass suffered minor impacts but it looked as if everyone had passed the Ferrari without serious consequences. However, Paletti could not react in time and slammed into the rear of the stranded Ferrari at 180 km/h (), catapulting it into the path of Geoff Lees. The Osella&#x27;s nose was crushed heavily.

Due to the force of the severe impact, Paletti sustained heavy chest injuries and was lying unconscious in his car, wedged against the steering wheel. Sid Watkins, the FIA&#x27;s head doctor, was on the scene to stabilise and assist Paletti. As Watkins climbed over the wreckage of the Osella, the petrol from the fuel tank ignited, enveloping the car in a wall of fire. When the fire was finally put out, the injured Paletti was without a pulse. It took the rescue workers 25 minutes to cut him out safely from his wrecked car, as the sparks caused by the cutting equipment threatened to re-ignite the petrol on the track. He was flown by a medical helicopter to the Royal Victoria Hospital, where he died soon after arriving. His mother was watching from the stands, where they were to celebrate his 24th birthday later that week. Paletti suffered a torn aorta as well as fractures to both legs. According to track doctor Jacques Bouchard his pupils were already dilated when medical personnel arrived and that the extended extraction time made no difference to his chances of survival.

Paletti was the second Formula One driver to die during the 1982 season. Five weeks earlier, Gilles Villeneuve had a fatal crash during qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder. Paletti was the last Formula One driver to die in a race until the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, which saw the death of Roland Ratzenberger during qualifying and of three-time world champion Ayrton Senna during the race itself. In 1986 Elio de Angelis was killed during testing at Circuit Paul Ricard three days after the 1986 Monaco Grand Prix, but the test was not part of a Grand Prix.

In tribute to Paletti, the racetrack at Varano de&#x27; Melegari, in the province of Parma (northern Italy) is now called the Autodromo Riccardo Paletti. There is also a side altar in the Church of Santa Maria al Carrobiolo, Monza dedicated to his memory, in the Chapel of the Crucifix.

Paletti is buried at the Cimitero Maggiore di Milano.

<text>The International Human Powered Vehicle Association (IHPVA) is a US-based organization dedicated to promoting the design and development of human powered vehicles (HPVs) and the keeping of speed and distance records for these vehicles and bikes.

== History ==
The IHPVA was founded in 1976 in the USA and was for many years an association of individual members with the publications Human Power and HPV News. In 1997, the IHPVA was reorganised into an international association with national organisations as members and an American association which adopted the name Human Powered Vehicle Association HPVA.

Due to conflicts regarding record keeping and copyrights, the HPVA left the IHPVA in 2004. In 2008, the HPVA renamed itself to IHPVA while the IHPVA of this time decided to keep its name, resulting in a brief period with two organisations of the same name.

In a hostile takeover, the American IHPVA also seized control of the domain name ihpva.org away from the international IHPVA. This tried to regain its domain by appealing to the ICANN&#x27;s ombudsman but was unsuccessful and in 2009 renamed itself to World Human Powered Vehicle Association (WHPVA).

== Members ==
Today&#x27;s IHPVA is an association of individuals from all over the world and has affiliate associations in North America. The affiliates are:

== IHPVA records ==

The IHPVA maintains speed and distance records for various times and distances for land, water and air vehicles. The current hour record was achieved by Sam Wittingham with a total Distance of 90.60 km (56.29 mi) in 2009. Its recordbase has forked from the WHPVA in 2009, who currently recognizes Francesco Russo&#x27;s 2016 claim of 92.43 km (57.43 mi) as the hour record.

<doc id="857029" wikidata="Q650531" url="?curid=857029" title="Thracian Tomb of Sveshtari">
<text>The Thracian Tomb of Svestari (Свещарска гробница, &quot;Sveshtarska grobnitsa&quot;) is southwest of the village of Sveshtari, Razgrad Province, which is northeast of Razgrad, in northeast Bulgaria. The tomb is probably the grave of Dromichaetes (; c. 300 – c. 280 BCE) who was a king of the Getae on both sides of the lower Danube (present day Romania and Bulgaria) around 300 BCE, and his wife, the daughter of King Lysimachus (Greek: Λυσίμαχος, &quot;Lysimachos&quot;; c. 360 – 281 BCE) who was a general and &quot;diadochus&quot; (i.e., &quot;successor&quot;) of Alexander the Great. The tomb is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== General information ==
Discovered and excavated in 1982 during excavations at Mound No 7 of the East Mound Necropolis of Sboryanovo (&quot;Ginina Mogila&quot;) – a tumulus of the early Hellenistic period, the Sveshtari tomb was built in the first quarter of the 3rd century BC. The tomb&#x27;s construction reflects the fundamental structural principles of Thracian cult buildings. The tomb&#x27;s architectural decor is considered to be unique, with polychrome half-human, half-plant caryatids and painted murals. The ten female figures carved in high relief on the walls of the central chamber and the decorations of the lunette in its vault are the only examples of this type found so far in the Thracian lands. It is an exceptional monument of the Getae, a Thracian people who were in contact with the Hellenistic and Hyperborean worlds, according to ancient geographers.

In 2012, archaeologists uncovered a significant treasure near the village. The treasure included a golden ring, 44 female figure depictions and 100 golden buttons, found in 150 tombs from the 4th century BC.
It has been suggested that it is part of the site of the Getan city of Helis.

== History ==
The Getae had been federated in the Odrysian kingdom in the 5th century BC. It is not known how the relations between Getae and Odrysians developed. The Balkan campaigns of Philip II of Macedon between 352 and 340 BC shattered Odrysian authority and the Getae profited from the situation. By the second half of the 4th century, the Getae occupied sites on both banks of the lower Danube and this region flourished as never before. The new Macedonian conquests, secured with considerable military power, caused consternation in the adjoining territories and thus stimulated the political fusion of the Getic tribes.

The Getic tomb at Sveshtari in the western Ludogorie in Bulgaria is also supposed to have been near the location of Helis. In the vicinity of the mausoleum, the remains of a large ancient city were found along with dozens of Getic mound tombs. The settlement is situated in a natural stronghold, a plateau surrounded like a peninsula by the ravines of Krapinets River. The outer stone wall, up to 4m thick, follows the edges of the peninsula and defends a territory of about 10 hectares. The inner wall, of similar construction, encloses a roughly quadrilateral area of about 5 hectares. The fortified territory was relatively densely occupied by dwellings connected by a network of thoroughfares. Dating finds such as amphorae stamps and coins indicate that this settlement existed between c. 335 and c. 250 BC.

<text>The Arab was a high-performance English automobile designed by Reid Railton and manufactured in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, between 1926 and 1928. The factory had previously been used by the Phoenix car company.

==History==
The car came about following discussions between J. G. Parry-Thomas, design engineer at Leyland Motors, Reid Railton, his assistant and Henry Spurrier, chairman of Leyland Motors. Leyland had made 50 four-cylinder engine blocks intended to be used in fast delivery vans, but the project was not proceeded with. The three discussed what to do with the blocks, and the building of a 2-litre sporting car was agreed. A prototype was built to test the new engine using an Enfield-Allday chassis and the car taken to Brooklands for the 1924 Easter Meeting. The engine had an overhead camshaft with the same unusual valve springing using leaf springs as those found on Parry Thomas&#x27;s Leyland Eight. Drive was to the rear wheels via a Moss 4-speed gearbox and ENV spiral-bevel rear axle. It was one of the first English cars to use an electric fuel pump. Production of two variants was started in 1926 at the Letchworth works, a low-chassis sporting model and a high-chassis touring type. Two and four-seater bodies were available on the high-chassis at £525 and probably only the two-seater on the low-chassis at £550.

Parry Thomas died in March 1927 attempting to break the World Land Speed Record in his car Babs, and with his death Railton lost interest in the Arab and the Letchworth works closed after only about 6 or 7 cars were made. The remaining components were bought by Thomson &amp; Taylor, where Railton was working, based at Brooklands and a few more cars were assembled. This was something of a pity, as the car was an impressive performer with the two-seater high chassis good for 80 mph, and the Super Sports was said to have been capable of going . One high chassis is known to have been supercharged and is said to have achieved .

Two cars are known to survive, both low chassis.

<text>Karna (Sanskrit: कर्ण, IAST: &quot;Karṇa&quot;), also known as Vasusena, Anga-Raja, Sutaputra and Radheya, is one of the major characters in the Hindu epic &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;. He is the son of Surya (the Sun deity) and princess Kunti (later the Pandava queen). Kunti was granted the boon to bear a child with desired divine qualities from the gods and without much knowledge, Kunti invoked the sun god to confirm it if it was true indeed. Karna was secretly born to an unmarried Kunti in her teenage years, and fearing outrage and backlash from society over her premarital pregnancy, Kunti had to abandon the newly born Karna adrift in a basket on the Ganges. The basket is discovered floating on the Ganges River. He is adopted and raised by foster &quot;Suta&quot; parents named Radha and Adhiratha Nandana of the charioteer and poet profession working for king Dhritarashtra. Karna grows up to be an accomplished warrior of extraordinary abilities, a gifted speaker and becomes a loyal friend of Duryodhana. He is appointed the king of Anga (Bihar-Bengal) by Duryodhana. Karna joins the losing Duryodhana side of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; war. He is a key antagonist who aims to kill Arjuna but dies in a battle with him during the Kurushetra war.

He is a tragic hero in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, in a manner similar to Aristotle&#x27;s literary category of &quot;flawed good man&quot;. He meets his biological mother late in the epic then discovers that he is the older half-brother of those he is fighting against. Karna is a symbol of someone who is rejected by those who should love him but do not given the circumstances, yet becomes a man of exceptional abilities willing to give his love and life as a loyal friend. His character is developed in the epic to raise and discuss major emotional and &quot;dharma&quot; (duty, ethics, moral) dilemmas. His story has inspired many secondary works, poetry and dramatic plays in the Hindu arts tradition, both in India and in southeast Asia.

A regional tradition believes that Karna founded the city of Karnal, in contemporary Haryana.

== Nomenclature and epithets ==
Karṇa (कर्ण) is a word found in the Vedic literature, where it means &quot;the ear&quot;, &quot;chaff or husk of a grain&quot; or the &quot;helm or rudder&quot;. In another context, it refers to a spondee in Sanskrit prosody.

In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the Puranas, it is the name of a warrior character. Called Vasusena as a child by his foster parents, he became known by the name Karna because of the golden earrings of Surya he used to wear, according to the Sanskrit epics scholar David Slavitt.

The word Karna, states the Indologist Kevin McGrath, signifies &quot;eared, or the ear-ringed one&quot;. In section 3.290.5 of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Karna is described as a baby born with the ear-rings and armoured breastplate, like his father Surya.
The second meaning of Karna as &quot;rudder and helm&quot; is also an apt metaphor given Karna&#x27;s role in steering the war in Book 8 of the epic, where the good Karna confronts the good Arjuna, one of the climax scenes wherein the Mahabharata authors repeatedly deploy the allegories of ocean and boat to embed layers of meanings in the poem. For example, his first entry into the Kurukshetra battlefield is presented as the &quot;Makara&quot; movement (an arrangement of soldiers in the sea-monster pattern). As Duryodhana&#x27;s army crumbles each day, the sea and vessel metaphor repeatedly appears in the epic, particularly when Karna is mentioned. As a newborn, Karna&#x27;s life begins in a basket without a rudder on a river, in circumstances that he neither chose nor had a say. In Book 1, again in the context of Karna, Duryodhana remarks, &quot;the origins of heroes and rivers are indeed difficult to understand&quot;.

The name Karna is also symbolically connected to the central aspect of Karna&#x27;s character as the one who is intensely preoccupied with what others hear and think about him, about his fame, a weakness that others exploit to manipulate him. This &quot;hearing&quot; and &quot;that which is heard&quot;, states McGrath makes &quot;Karna&quot; an apt name and subtle reminder of Karna&#x27;s driving motivation.

Karna was also called with many names. Some of them are:

* Vasusena – Original name of Karna, means &quot;born with wealth&quot; as he was born with natural armour and earrings.
* Suryaputra – Son of Surya
* Radheya – son of Radha (Karna&#x27;s adopted mother).
* Sutaputra – son of charioteer.
* Angaraja – king of Anga.
* Daanaveera – one of charitable nature or one who is exceptionally munificent (generous)
* Vijayadhari – holder of a bow named Vijaya which was gifted by Lord Parashurama.
* Vaikartana – one who belongs to solar race (related to Surya).
* Vrisha – one who is truthful in speech and kept his vows.

== Mythology and sources: Mahābhārata ==
The story of Karna is told in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, one of the Sanskrit epics from the Indian subcontinent. The work is written in Classical Sanskrit and is a composite work of revisions, editing and interpolations over many centuries. The oldest parts in the surviving version of the text probably date to about 400 BCE. Within Mahabharata, which follows the story within a story style of narration, the account of Karna&#x27;s birth has been narrated four times.

Karna appears for the first time in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; in the verse 1.1.65 of &quot;Adi Parvan&quot; (first book) where he is briefly mentioned through the metaphor of a tree, as someone who is refusing to fight or help in the capture of Krishna. He is presented again in sections 1.2.127–148, and chapter 1.57 of the &quot;Adi Parvan&quot;. It is here that his earrings &quot;that make his face shine&quot;, as well as the divine breastplate (body armor) he was born with, are mentioned for the first time. This sets him apart as someone special, with gifts no ordinary mortal has. However, later in the epic, the generous Karna gives the &quot;earrings and breastplate&quot; away in charity, thereby becomes a mortal and later dies in a battle with Arjuna.

The story of his unmarried mother getting the child due to her curiosity, his divine connection to the Hindu god Surya, then his birth appears for the first time in the epic in section 1.104.7. The epic uses glowing words to describe Karna, but the presentation here is compressed in 21 &quot;shlokas&quot; unlike the later books which expand the details. These later sections with more details on Karna&#x27;s birth and childhood include 3.287, 5.142 and 15.38. According to McGrath, the early presentation of Karna in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; is such as if the poets expect the audience to already know the story and love the character of Karna. The text does not belabour the details about Karna in the early sections, rather uses metaphors and metonyms to colourfully remind the audience of the fabric of a character they already are assumed to be aware of. The complete narrative of his life appears for the first time in chapter 1.125.

===Manuscripts, many versions===
The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; manuscripts exist in numerous versions, wherein the specifics and details of major characters and episodes vary, often significantly. Except for the sections containing the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; which is remarkably consistent between the numerous manuscripts, the rest of the epic exists in many versions. The differences between the Northern and Southern recensions are particularly significant, with the Southern manuscripts more profuse and longer. The legends of Karna too appear in many versions, including some versions that have no support in surviving manuscripts. The manuscripts found in the North and South India for the &quot;Karna parvan&quot; book have &quot;great divergence&quot; in details, though the thematic essence is similar. Scholars have attempted to construct a critical edition, relying mostly on a study of the Bombay edition, the Poona edition, the Calcutta edition and the south Indian editions of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; manuscripts. The most accepted version is one prepared by scholars led by Vishnu Sukthankar at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, preserved at the Kyoto University, the Cambridge University and various Indian universities.

==Biography==
=== Birth and early life ===

According to the legend, there was a king of the Yadava dynasty named Shurasena who had a beautiful young daughter named Pritha (later Kunti). A &quot;rishi&quot; (Vedic scholar and seer) named Durvasa visited the king for a lengthy stay and was housed as his palace guest. Shurasena asked Pritha to ensure that Durvasa&#x27;s stay was comfortable. On leaving, having been delighted with his stay and her diligent services, Durvasa thanked her and gave her the &quot;Siddha mantra&quot;, telling her that if she ever wants, she can invoke any deity to give her a child.

Teenage Pritha became curious, wondered if the mantra would really work and, as the sun rose one morning, she initiated the mantra through which she could invoke any divine God being to provide her a son. She called the sun god Surya. He came with a golden glow, dressed up in jewellery and breastplate, and provided her with her first son. Pritha felt confused and ashamed, worried what everyone will think and how she will embarrass her family. At that time, according to Vedic civilization, if a girl gave birth to a child before her marriage, she would be less likely to be married. So, she put the newborn baby in a padded basket, and set it adrift in the small river Ashvanadi by the palace.

Later Kunti got blessed with children Yudhishtra, Bhima, and Arjuna, using this mantra. The same mantra was used by Kunti to allow her co-wife, Madri, to conceive Nakula and Sahdeva. The Spiritual &quot;fathers&quot; of the five Pandavas were Dharma, Vayu, Indra and the twin Ashwini Kumaras.

As the adolescent mother abandons her unwanted child on the river, she laments and the epic verses describe her emotions with heartbreaking poetry, according to the Indologist Patricia Greer.

The basket floats, reaches the river Charmanwati, which carries it to the Yamuna River. The basket floats on and reaches the Ganges River and on it into the kingdom of Anga (ancient Bengal). There, it is found by a charioteer&#x27;s wife Radha, who takes the baby Karna to her husband Adhiratha Nandana. They adopt him right away and name him Vasushena. They love him and raise him just like their own son. While he was growing up, his adopting parents let Karna know that they had found and adopted him. This knowledge affects Karna, he feels ashamed that he was abandoned, and this frames his sense of self-identity through the epic.

Karna attends school in Hastinapura, where he studies martial arts under the sages Drona and Kripa. When Drona declines to teach him the knowledge of the Brahmastra weapon, Karna disguises himself as a Brahmin to become a student of Parashurama, an incarnation of the god Vishnu. Upon discovering Karna&#x27;s deception, Parashurama curses him, declaring that he will forget the secret of the Brahmastra at the critical moment when he wishes to use it against his enemy.

The third Pandava prince Arjuna was Karna&#x27;s peer and equal. At school and in episodes where his character appears, he is repeatedly rejected, subjected to ridicule and bullied for being the son of a poor family, and particularly for his low birth. The boy Karna came to be known for his solitary habits, hard work, pious yoga before Surya every day, compassion and eager generosity to help anyone in need particularly Brahmins, his gift of speech, and for the pursuit of excellence in whatever he did. Karna is also known as someone who craves for respect, love and attention, who is overly sensitive to criticism, who habitually brags about his skills and martial capabilities, yet is deeply thoughtful and dharmic in critical moments of the epic.

=== Relationship with Duryodhana ===
Karna meets Duryodhana for the first time in Hastinapura during archery lessons from Drona, an event described in section 3.293 of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. They become close friends not long after, when Karna and Arjuna are at a weapons trial competition. Duryodhana sees in Karna a man who is an equal of Arjuna in martial abilities, and someone to befriend to balance out Arjuna and thereby &quot;diminish the Pandavas&quot;.

Before the competition starts, the contestants must announce theirs lineage so that men of equal ranks are placed together. After Arjuna announces his royal lineage, it is time for Karna to present his lineage. If Karna were to announce his charioteer lineage, it would disqualify him from competing against Arjuna. Duryodhana steps in and says Karna is an &quot;Arajna&quot; (a non-king, but also a word play on Arjuna) but announces that he is offering to anoint Karna as the king of Angas (Bengal). Once Karna is a king, states Duryodhana, Arjuna would not have the excuse to avoid Karna and not compete with the able warrior. Karna accepts the anointment, becomes a king that day. It also transforms him into a loyal friend to Duryodhana, with an eagerness to reciprocate the favour. Karna asks Duryodhana what he would want in return for the kingdom he just gave out of his empire, Duryodhana replies, &quot;I want your endless friendship Karna&quot;.

For the consecration ceremony, Karna&#x27;s father arrives. Bhima, one of the Pandavas, ridicules him for his low status and calls him dog-like. The public insult of his father makes Karna hate the Pandavas. At the end of the competition, while everyone rejects Karna, Duryodhana expresses amity to Karna by &quot;taking Karna by his hand&quot;. Karna feels Duryodhana is that friend who stood by him when everyone rejected him. Duryodhana becomes Karna&#x27;s lifelong close friend. In Karna, Duryodhana finds an able man and talented commander who can help him gain and retain power over an empire. In Duryodhana, Karna finds a caring friend and resourceful supporter when almost everyone is bent on ridiculing and disowning him.

Karna evolves into a character who shares Duryodhana&#x27;s view that Pandavas are bad and enemies, though for different reasons. Karna participates with Duryodhana in schemes to effect the downfall of the Pandavas. Duryodhana provides the goals, Karna conspires the means to get there.

In the final year of the exile of the Pandavas, Duryodhana plans to sow dissension and keep the entire empire to himself. In contrast, Bhisma and Drona suggest a conciliation and dividing the kingdom into two, half for Kauravas and other for Pandavas. Karna, in contrast, adopts the hawkish approach and becomes the first to suggest a direct confrontation in the form of the Kurukshetra war. He calls for &quot;together we should slay the Pandavas&quot; as the final solution. Karna persistently recommends violence and an all-out war, to settle things once and for all, by good brave warriors. Karna also accuses Bhisma and Drona as covetous materialists and dishonest in counselling Duryodhana with non-violent strategies. Duryodhana has evil intentions and is a bad king, but it is Karna who fuels Duryodhana&#x27;s ambitions and fights his battles.

With Duryodhana, Karna is a key participant in insulting the Pandavas and Draupadi. He humiliates the Pandavas with his gift of speech and mocks Draupadi, then calls her a &quot;whore&quot; and asks Duhshasana to strip her off her clothes. It is Karna&#x27;s language and insults that hurt the Pandavas and Draupadi the most, a sentiment that is noted in numerous verses of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; such as 3.13.113 and 5.93.11. Yet, states the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; scholar Alf Hiltebeitel, &quot;remarkably, Karna regrets his harsh words to Draupadi and Pandavas&quot;, in verse 5.139.45, where he confesses he spoke so to please Duryodhana.

===Conquests and defeats===
Karna is portrayed in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; as a skilled and valiant warrior, achieving several notable victories. One of his key successes was his defeat of Jarasandha, the powerful king of Magadha, during the s&quot;wayamvara&quot; of the princess of Kalinga. Despite Jarasandha’s strength and reputation, Karna prevailed and, as a mark of respect, was gifted the territory of Malini by the defeated ruler. Additionally, Karna played a critical role during Duryodhana’s military campaigns, successfully defeating various kings like Drupada and Bhaggadatta and expanding the Kaurava domain.

Karna also faced significant defeats that revealed his limitations. During the campaign against Drupada, launched as &quot;Gurudakshina&quot; for Drona, Karna and the Kauravas were unable to overcome Drupada’s forces. It was Arjuna who ultimately succeeded in capturing Drupada. Another notable loss occurred during the Pandavas’ Rajasuya Yajna, when Karna refused an alliance with Bhima, leading to a direct confrontation. Although Karna resisted fiercely, Bhima ultimately defeated him, with Karna’s divine armor (&quot;Kavacha&quot;) and earrings (&quot;Kundala&quot;) preventing his death. In the Gandharva episode during the Pandavas&#x27; exile, Karna fled from battle after Kauravas were captured by Chitrasena, the Gandharva king, after being defeated in battle. 

=== Hostilities with the Pandavas ===
The relationship between Karna and the Pandavas, particularly Arjuna, were hostile. The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; mentions Karna as the main challenger of Arjuna at sporting and skills competitions. At martial sporting events, Arjuna and Karna were often equal, though in his self-bragging style Karna once announced, states McGrath, that &quot;he will perform any feat that Arjuna has accomplished and do it better&quot;.

At the &quot;svayamvara&quot; competition of Draupadi, where she is expected to choose her husband, both Arjuna and Karna are present. Arjuna and his brothers, however, are disguised as mendicant Brahmins. They use this false identity in exile because Duryodhana had attempted to kill them using various schemes, including burning the lacquer house – custom built for the Pandavas by Duryodhana – along with the forest while they were sleeping. There are some variations regarding Karna&#x27;s participation. Some renditions show Draupadi refusing to marry Karna on account of being a &quot;Sūta&quot;, while some other versions describe him failing to string the bow by the &quot;breadth of a hair&quot;. In the end, Arjuna succeeds in the task, However Karna objects that the competition is only meant for &quot;Kshatriyas&quot;, and Brahmins such as &quot;the mendicant who just strung the bow&quot; should not be competing for the hand of Draupadi, a Kshatriya bride. Duryodhana supports him. The gathered Kshatriyas too angrily support Karna, for they against the mixing of varna (here, Brahmin-Kshatriya marriage). Arjuna maintains his calm, continues to hide his true identity, insists that he is a &quot;Brahmin who fight&quot;. Arjuna&#x27;s accomplishments and calmness win Draupadi&#x27;s heart. Draupadi picks Arjuna and awards the garland to him, signify that she chooses to marry the disguised-Brahmin Arjuna. The varna-based discrimination and verbal insults on Arjuna, for lovely Draupadi&#x27;s hand, one that Karna initiates at the time of Draupadi&#x27;s &quot;svayamvara&quot; competition comes back to haunt him many times through angry Bhima and others who remind Karna that he is merely a &quot;suta-putra&quot; (son of a charioteer). Draupadi too never likes Karna thereafter.

Karna fights and berates the Pandavas at the legendary gambling match during the royal consecration ritual. There, Karna uses the choicest words to insult Draupadi that takes the bitterness of Pandava for Karna to much more emotional level from what previously was a dispute about respective martial prowess. These are the sections of the epic when the Pandavas, Arjuna in particular, openly pledge to kill Karna. Karna retaliates with words too, stating that Arjuna&#x27;s death is so near that he will &quot;not wash his feet until Arjuna is slain&quot;.

Karna is not proud of his anger and outbursts. Later, in a quieter moment with Krishna such as in section 5.139.45, and to his lifelong friend Duryodhana in section 8.1.7, Karna confides he was wrong in insulting Draupadi and the Pandavas, it is his past karma that haunts him and is a source of his private suffering.

=== Discovery of his biological mother ===
Book 5 of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; describes two meetings where Karna discovers information about his birth. The first meeting is with Krishna, the second where his biological mother Kunti comes to meet him for the first time.

Krishna approaches Karna as an ambassador seeking to prevent violence and the war. Krishna starts by complimenting Karna for knowing &quot;the &quot;Vedas&quot; and the subtlety of the &quot;dharmasastras&quot;&quot;. He then requests his support to end the cascading cycle of violence and war. Krishna tells Karna that Kunti is his biological mother and Pandavas are his half-brothers. In section 5.138 of the epic, according to McGrath, Krishna states, &quot;by law, Karna should be considered as the eldest born of Pandavas&quot;, that he can use this information to become the king. Through his relationship to his mother Kunti, all Vrishnis on Krishna&#x27;s side will also recognize him and be his tributary, he can be the emperor with power over everyone. Yudhisthira will hold the fan for him as he sits in the throne, Bhima his umbrella, and the common wife of the Pandavas – Draupadi too – says Krishna, may marry to him. after some time, were Karna to press his status as the eldest biological Pandava brother, end the war and rule the world.

Karna declines the offer. Karna replies that though he was born from Kunti, it was the wife of a charioteer &quot;Radha who gave him love and sustenance&quot;, and that makes her his real mother. Similarly, it is from the love and affection and &quot;not scripture&quot; that he knows Adhiratha to be his real father. He is already married, says Karna, he has two sons and now grandsons, all because his father Adhiratha helped him settle into his married life. What matters most in life are the &quot;bonds of love&quot;, according to Karna, and not power over the world. He shall betray no one, remain loyal to those who love him, including his friend Duryodhana, with whom he has been in allegiance for thirteen years. It is not &quot;blood ties&quot; that matter, but how someone treats you over a period of time that does. He made a promise to Duryodhana and he will keep it. It is his duty to fight Arjuna.

Krishna then went to Kunti and asked her to meet Karna and tell him that he is her first born son and the Pandavas were his brothers. Krishna left it to her to choose between Karna and her five other sons. Kunti then went to meet Karna, finds him praying. She waits. After he finished his prayers to Surya, Karna meets Kunti for the first time in his adult life. He greets her (he now already knows her to be his biological mother). With folded hands, he introduces himself as the son of Radha and Adhiratha, and inquires about the purpose of her visit. Kunti then confesses that he is her firstborn. Surya also appears and confirms Kunti&#x27;s story, and suggests that he follow her. Karna says that though he may have been the firstborn, he never received the affection or care from her as the firstborn. &quot;You discarded me&quot;, says Karna to Kunti, &quot;you destroyed me in a way that no enemy could ever do to him&quot;. It is too late. He reiterates that he loves the parents who raised him, they love him, and he will remain loyal to his lifelong relationships. No one should abandon those who give respect and affection, says Karna in these &quot;Mahabharata&quot; verses. The war momentum shall continue and he aims to kill Arjuna. Karna promised to Kunti that he will not kill any of his other four half-brothers, but either &quot;Arjuna or I&quot; shall die and she can still say she has five sons just as she did all her life.

After these developments and pondering on Karna&#x27;s life choices, the divine Krishna, as well as a host of &quot;Mahabharata&quot; heroes, in private and after his death, honour Karna as a &quot;satpurusha&quot; (lit. &quot;a true, honest, good man&quot;) and &quot;the best among those who understand and uphold the &quot;dharma&quot;&quot;.

===Role in Kurukshetra War===
Karna was born with aspects of his divine father Surya – the earrings and armour breastplate – that made him an immortal at birth. However, despite being warned, Karna prefers to lose these natural gifts in order to uphold his reputation as the one who always gives &quot;dāna&quot; (charity), particularly to Brahmins, as being more important than his own life.

As the battle-to-death between Karna and Arjuna becomes certain, Kunti – the mother of both, faints and later weeps in sorrow that her boys are bent on killing each other. In parallel, Arjuna&#x27;s brothers and Indra – the father of Arjuna and a major Vedic deity – plan ways to make Karna mortal. Surya meets Karna and warns him of Indra&#x27;s plan to appear disguised as a Brahmin to divest him of his earrings and breastplate, and thereby his immortality. Karna disregards this warning and says that if the king of gods Indra comes to beg before him, and if he charitably gives to Indra, it will bring him &quot;renown and fame&quot;, then argues that &quot;fame is more important to him than anything else&quot;. Indra appears as predicted, and Karna cuts his birthmarks of immortality with a knife, and gives the blood-soaked donation to disguised-as-a-Brahmin Indra. The leader of gods in return praises him and gives him a missile that can only be used once and will kill any mortal or immortal.

Karna keeps the Indra&#x27;s missile in reserve since it could only be used once, and aims to kill Arjuna with it. By the thirteenth day of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; war, numerous soldiers, kings, brothers and sons of Kauravas (Karna&#x27;s side) and Pandavas (Arjuna&#x27;s side) had been killed, many by foul means. The war had entered a brutal stage, according to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; verses in sections 7.150–156. On the fourteenth day, Arjuna took revenge of his own son&#x27;s death, while Bhima and his son Ghatotkacha wreaked havoc on numerous Kaurava battalions. The war that previously started after sunrise and stopped at sunset, did not stop on the fourteenth day&#x27;s sunset as both armies continued a ferocious war to kill each other. Bhima&#x27;s son Ghatotkacha had a &quot;rakshasha&quot; lineage, and his powers of illusion to confuse the enemies grew to enormous proportions as the war dragged deeper into the fifteenth night. Duryodhana and Karna&#x27;s Kaurava friends plead that they are finished unless Karna does whatever it takes to kill Ghatotkacha. Karna hurls the &quot;Indra missile&quot; to kill Ghatotkacha. Karna thus saves his reputation among his soldiers, launches the missile and kills Ghatotkacha. Duryodhana and Kaurava army rejoice with the death of Bhima&#x27;s son Ghatotkacha, but now Karna had exhausted the weapon that gave him an advantage over Arjuna.

===Death===

As the second last day of the war and Karna&#x27;s day of death dawns, Karna asks Duryodhana to convince king Shalya to be his charioteer since he plans to kill Arjuna that day. The South Indian king considers it below his dignity to be a mere charioteer and starts insulting Karna, who retaliates with words. Duryodhana intervenes, praises both, presses Shalya to guide the chariot for the critical battle. Ultimately Shalya agrees. Since all previous commanders of Duryodhana had been killed, he anoints Karna as the &quot;senapati&quot; (commander of all his forces) for the first time. Karna and Shalya head into the battlefield together, though they keep insulting each other&#x27;s abilities and intent, lack mutual devotion and teamwork. Together they reach Arjuna with Krishna. They battle that day, each showing his martial skills of attack as well as his ability to neutralize all weapons that reach their chariot. Then, the wheel of Karna&#x27;s chariot gets stuck in the ground. Karna steps out of his chariot and is distracted while trying to unstick it. Arjuna – whose own son was killed by the Kauravas a day ago while he was trying to unstick his chariot&#x27;s wheel – takes this moment to launch the fatal attack. Karna dies.
===Marital life===

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; provides scarce information on Karna&#x27;s marital life. In the &quot;Udyoga Parva&quot;, it is mentioned that he married a Suta woman chosen by Adhiratha. She is later referenced in the &quot;Stri Parva&quot; as the mother of Vrishasena and Sushena, the two most prominent sons of Karna. Marital details of Karna&#x27;s life are expanded and reimagined in later adaptations of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

In the modern day version of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, nine sons of Karna are mentioned—Vrishasena, Chitrasena, Satyasena, Sushena, Shatrunjaya, Dvipata, Banasena, Prasena and Vrishaketu.

== Themes and symbolism ==
===Vedic and Indo-European parallelism===
The Karna-Arjuna story has parallels in the Vedic literature and may have emerged from these more ancient themes. According to McGrath, the Vedic mythology is loaded with the legendary and symbolism-filled conflict between Surya (sun) and Indra (clouds, thunder, rain). Indra cripples Surya in the Vedic mythology by detaching his wheel, while Arjuna kills Karna while he tries to fix the wheel that is stuck in the ground. As another example of parallels, Surya too has a birth mother (Night) who abandons him in the Vedic texts and he too considers his adoptive mother (Dawn) who raises him to his bright self as the true mother just like Karna. This idea was first discussed by the philologist Georges Dumézil, who remarked that similar mythology and details are found in other ancient Indo-European stories.

Karna resembles various famous characters found in Hindu texts. The attributed author of Mahabharata, the sage Vyasa, was also born from an unwed union of Satyavati and sage Parashara. German Indologist Georg von Simson states that Karna of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; resembles Kumbhakarna of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the demon brother of the main antagonist Ravana of the epic &quot;Ramayana&quot; in their powers to sway the war. Both Karna and Kumbhakarna did not take part in the great wars of their respective epics at the start.

Scholars internationally have also drawn parallels with various European mythologies. Karna&#x27;s &quot;kavacha&quot; (breastplate armour) has been compared with that of Achilles&#x27;s Styx-coated body and with Irish warrior Ferdiad&#x27;s skin that could not be pierced. He has been compared to the Greek mythological part divine, part human character Achilles on various occasions as they both have divine powers but lack corresponding status.

===Dharma-ethics===
Dharma is a complex concept in the Indian religions. It is not an atomistic or compartmentalized concept, rather incorporates &quot;ways of living, ways of seeing and ways of relating to life&#x27;s ultimate issues&quot;, according to Matilal. Of those issues, ones relating to right or wrong behaviour, duties, rights, and expectations from others are the domain of &quot;dharma-ethics&quot;. Karna&#x27;s story raises the &quot;dharma-ethics&quot; questions both while Karna acts in the epic as well as after his death. These questions arise with the circumstances related to his birth and through his death. Karna chooses loyalty to his lifelong friend and &quot;good policy based on his heart&quot; to be of higher value than accepting Krishna&#x27;s recommendation that he switch sides and become the king as the eldest son of Kunti based on &quot;dharmasastras&quot;. According to Gurcharan Das, the character of Karna in the ancient Hindu epic suggests a social debate between &quot;inherited status&quot; and &quot;deserved status&quot;, a debate that remains relevant to the contemporary times. Das writes,

===Circumstances and subjective morality===
As the Karna story unfolds, similar to other stories in epic, it raises moral dilemmas. With each dilemma, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; presents various sides and shades of answers through the characters. According to Bimal Matilal, the characters face a &quot;choice between irreconcilable obligations&quot;, between two good or two poor choices, where complex circumstances must be considered. These circumstances make the evaluation of the choices complicated and a decision difficult, subjective. When circumstances lead to a conflict between two choices that are both right in their own premises, then following one duty becomes &quot;contrary to the duty according to the other&quot;. Under these circumstances, there is an inherent subjective weighing of one moral duty against another.

According to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, human conflicts such as those illustrated through Karna-Arjuna conflict are inherently complicated and come with circumstantial depth. During violence and war, where all sides are motivated in part by their own beliefs in what constitutes righteousness, coupled with anger, frustration, and fear, the circumstances are ever more complex, actions irreversible, choices difficult. The choices made by Karna and his opponents must then be reflected upon both in terms of the circumstances and the mesh of multiple relative goods or bads, by characters each with different combinations of human strengths and weaknesses.

According to the Indologist Adam Bowles, while the Hindu &quot;Arthashastra&quot; text presents an objective analysis of situations, its &quot;dharmasutras&quot;, &quot;dharmasastras&quot; and the epics attempt to deal with the more complex, subjective scenarios of life. The &quot;dharma&quot;, according to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and as Karna&#x27;s story illustrates, is &quot;sukshma&quot; (subtle) and subjective to circumstances. According to Julian Woods, these stories suggest that the difficulty is not really between &quot;&quot;dharma&quot; and &quot;adharma&quot;&quot;, but rather &quot;conflict between different &quot;dharmas&quot;&quot;. No act, states Woods, on this earth &quot;is wholly good or wholly bad&quot;.

===Human behaviour===
Karna and other characters in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, like all human beings, combine a spectrum of good and bad behaviour, intentions and deeds. According to Das, all of the epic&#x27;s characters including Karna do good deeds, foul deeds, and they are &quot;ineradicable mixture of good and evil&quot;. With the assistance of Karna, Duryodhana plotted many evil plans against the Pandavas. Similarly, the Pandavas use foul means in an attempt to win a war, and Arjuna sets aside the Hindu behavioural code for &quot;just war&quot; when Karna becomes defenceless and distracted by his chariot&#x27;s stuck wheel.

According to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; scholar Sukthankur, as quoted by Indologist Adarkar, there are apparent contradictions in Karna&#x27;s character. His behaviour reflects a &quot;frustration complex&quot; that makes sense in light of the circumstances of his birth and early life. Karna is a mirror with &quot;insights into human nature&quot; and how circumstances have the ability to shape human behaviour and one&#x27;s personality. Karna is not evil, just a misfit or a rebel, an inspiring character if viewed from one set of values and an abnormal character from another set of values. Other characters in the epic, on both sides, present behaviour conflicted hues of human behaviour in difficult circumstances. Karna is cruel in some situations such as against Draupadi, a behaviour he himself regrets in the pages of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. To the victim Draupadi, it was a violence she would never forget nor live with, and Karna&#x27;s personal regrets did not balance out her sexual humiliation in public. The reader and epic&#x27;s audience can empathize with his psychology, as well as the psychology and the counter-behaviour of his victims.

According to Adarkar, the Karna story also illustrates a different paradigm, one that transcends the Oedipal theories and evolutionary models of human behaviour. The Karna narrative resonates deeply with some in part because of his &quot;heroic steadfastness&quot; (&quot;dhirata&quot;), being comfortable with who he is, his beliefs and acting according to his &quot;dharma&quot; rather than being someone who evolves and changes as he studies martial arts, or because of Krishna&#x27;s advice, or Kunti&#x27;s confession that Karna is her firstborn. He refuses to wear &quot;Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, states Adarkar, and thus &quot;being revealed as a fraud&quot; and ever-adapting to new psychological garb. He loves the parents who adopted him, he loves his friends and heritage. Karna exemplifies a personality that does not &quot;discard identity after identity, but rather one who thrives by accepting and steadfastly hanging on to a meaningful identity&quot;. A more modern era example of Karna-like human behaviour was in Mahatma Gandhi, who &quot;after getting well-educated in a British law school and gaining international experience&quot;, steadfastly felt more empowered to embrace his heritage and culture rather than abandon or transcend it.

===Flawed, tragic hero===
Karna is the flawed tragic hero of the Mahabharata. He is martially adept and equal to Arjuna as a warrior, a gifted speaker who embeds provocative insults for his opponents in front of an audience. He does the right thing (&quot;dharma&quot;) yet is cruel and mean (&quot;adharma&quot;). He never questions the ethics of his lifelong friend Duryodhana rather conspires and abets in Duryodhana&#x27;s quest for power through the abuse of his opponents. He complains of &quot;&quot;dharma&quot; failed him&quot; on the day of his death, yet in his abuse of Draupadi, he himself ignores the &quot;dharma&quot;. He is a victim of his circumstances beyond his choosing, as much as the cause of circumstances that victimize other flawed heroes of the epic. His life story raises compassion, sorrow with an impending sense of destruction and fear (&quot;phobos&quot; and &quot;eleos&quot;) in the audience, as any good tragic drama. According to the Indologist Daniel Ingalls, the Karna character refutes the &quot;&quot;bon mot&quot; that Indian poets knew no tragedy&quot; before the colonial British introduced European literature to the Indians. Karna, and many Rajput ballads, are clearly tragedies in the Aristotlean and Elizabethan sense, states Ingalls.

According to Julian Woods, Karna is a &quot;tragic antihero&quot; of the epic. He is both generous to the Brahmins yet arrogant and cruel to the Pandavas. He bitterly opposes the Pandavas and is the pillar of support to the Kauravas, yet as he nears his fatal battle, he is also willing to accept his mistakes and recognize the good in Yudhisthira and the Pandavas he opposes.

== Secondary literature ==
The Karna story has been retold and adapted into drama, plays and dance performances in India and southeast Asia. These versions vary significantly from each other as well as the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; manuscript.

=== Literature ===
Rabindranath Tagore wrote a poem, &quot;Karna Kunti Sangbad&quot; based on the meeting of Karna and Kunti before the war. Karna also has been topic of various contemporary literary works. The Marathi books of &quot;Radheya&quot; (1973) authored by Ranjit Desai and &quot;Mrityunjay&quot; (1967) authored by Shivaji Sawant bring forth a fictionalized account of Karna&#x27;s private and personal life. Sawant also received Moortidevi Award, instituted by Bharatiya Jnanpith, for his work and was translated into nine languages. Ramdhari Singh Dinkar in 1978 published an epic poem &quot;Rashmirathi&quot; (translation: One who rides the Chariot of light, 1952) which narrates Karna&#x27;s life. The poem has later also been adapted as a play.

==In popular culture==
*Shyam Benegal&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Kalyug&quot; adapted the &quot;Mahabharat&quot; as a conflict between rival business houses with Shashi Kapoor playing Karan, the character based on Karna.
*Rajinikanth played a character based on Karna in the 1991 Kollywood film &quot;Thalapathi&quot;. The theme of the film is based on the friendship between Karna and Duryodhana.
*Ajay Devgan played a character based on Karna in the 2010 Bollywood film &quot;Raajneeti&quot;.
*South Indian film actor Mohanlal performed Karna on the stage in &quot;Karnabharam&quot;, a Sanskrit play that was premiered in New Delhi in 2001 as part of the Bharat Rang Mahotsav directed by Kavalam Narayana Panicker. The play depicts Karna&#x27;s mental agony a day before the Kurukshetra War, as he thinks about his past and his faith.
*Bala Devi Chandrashekar plays the character of Karna in the 2015 Bharatanatyam production &quot;Karna – Destiny&#x27;s Child&quot;.

<doc id="857055" wikidata="Q5663540" url="?curid=857055" title="Harpeth River">
<text>The Harpeth River, long, is one of the major streams of north-central Middle Tennessee, United States, and one of the major tributaries of the Cumberland River. Via the Cumberland and the Ohio Rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed. The lower portion of the Harpeth is designated as a &quot;scenic river&quot; under the Tennessee Scenic Rivers Act.

==Course==
The Harpeth rises in the westernmost part of Rutherford County, Tennessee, just to the east of the community of College Grove in eastern Williamson County. The upper portion of the river has been contaminated to some extent by the operation of a lead smelting plant located near the Kirkland community that recycled used automobile batteries from the 1950s until the 1990s.

The stream flows generally westerly into Franklin, the county seat of Williamson County and suburb of Nashville. The Harpeth is the source of the area&#x27;s drinking water supply.
At Franklin, the course of the river turns more northwesterly; a few miles northwest of Franklin is the mouth of one of the Harpeth&#x27;s main tributaries, the West Harpeth, which drains much of the southern portion of Williamson County. Near this site is an antebellum plantation house called &quot;Meeting of the Waters&quot;. The river in this area flows quite near the Natchez Trace (the original road of that name, not the modern Parkway named for it, which is several miles distant). The river shortly crosses into Davidson County and receives the flow of the Little Harpeth River, another important tributary. The stream flows near the unincorporated Nashville suburb of Bellevue and shortly after this flows into Cheatham County.

The course of the river in Cheatham County is very meandering. A few miles into Cheatham County, it is joined by another major tributary, the South Harpeth, which drains some of the southwestern portion of Davidson County, southeastern Cheatham County, and a small portion of northwesternmost Williamson County.

In Cheatham County is a remarkable civil engineering feat of the early 19th century. Ironmaster Montgomery Bell built an iron mill near the &quot;Narrows of the Harpeth&quot;. At a horseshoe bend, Bell&#x27;s workers cut a tunnel through approximately 200 yards (180 m) of solid rock. They used black-powder blasting techniques to build a diversion tunnel to power the mill, which Bell called &quot;Pattison Forge&quot; (often spelled, incorrectly, &quot;Patterson&quot;) after his mother&#x27;s maiden name. Bell was so pleased with his mill that he curtailed some of his other area operations and built a home near the site. Today, the diversion tunnel and some &quot;slag&quot; are about all that remain of his mill operation. The Montgomery Bell Tunnel is a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.

Also at the &quot;Narrows of the Harpeth&quot; is a prehistoric site known as Mound Bottom, noted for the complex earthwork constructions built from 950 and occupied into the 15th century. This area has several ceremonial and burial earthwork mounds of the Native American Mississippian culture, which preceded those historic tribes of the area known to European encounter. Bell&#x27;s diversion tunnel and the sheer bluffs nearby are now part of the Narrows of the Harpeth section of Harpeth River State Park, a linear park connecting several natural, historic, and archaeological sites along the lower Harpeth.

From this historic site, the flow becomes generally more northerly, but still greatly meandering. The Harpeth soon forms the line between Dickson and Cheatham counties for the last part of its course. A few miles above the mouth are what are known as the Three Islands; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed siting a dam near this location on several occasions and did some preliminary study. It was not supported by a favorable cost-benefit ratio and the project was never built. The lower portion of the Harpeth is very popular with canoeists, supporting canoe-outfitting and related businesses.

The mouth of the Harpeth into the Cumberland is near Ashland City, the Cheatham County seat. Near the mouth is a bridge on State Route 49 named in Montgomery Bell&#x27;s honor. The mouth is just below the Cumberland&#x27;s Harpeth Island, and is somewhat submerged by the backwaters of the Corps&#x27; Cheatham Dam.

After the removal of the lowhead dam in the city of Franklin, the Harpeth is Tennessee&#x27;s second-longest unimpounded stream (the longest being the Buffalo).

==Name==
The origin of the name &quot;Harpeth&quot; is controversial. It is often claimed that the river was named for America&#x27;s first known serial killers, the Harpe brothers, known as &quot;Big Harpe&quot; and &quot;Little Harpe&quot; who were in the area in 1797; this is erroneous since the name existed on maps and documents as early as 1784, predating their fame. A late-18th-century map, published in London, purportedly shows the stream as the &quot;Fairpath&quot;; there is some dissension about whether the name is of Native American origin or perhaps a corruption of the rather common English name &quot;Harper&quot;.

Another possible origin for the name of the Harpeth River was presented by Edward D. Hicks in a paper read before the Tennessee Historical Society and published by the “American Historical Magazine” in 1900. Hicks comments upon the influence of classical literature read by learned gentlemen in the 18th century. One source popular among many in the English-speaking world, including America, was the “Spectator” published by Joseph Addison. The “Spectator” contained articles on philosophy, morals and the classics. In publication number 584, printed in 1714, is found the antediluvian love story of Hilpa, Harpath and Shalum. Harpath comes to an untimely end drowning in a river as he attempted to cross it. “The river is called to this day from his name, who perished in it, the river Harpath…”. Hicks does not offer the claim that this is the definitive origin of the name however he does say it is “certainly appropriate…I submit it as the most probable and ingenious theory I can suggest.”
Early 18th-century maps including Matthew Carey&#x27;s 1795 Map of Tennessee as well as that of John Reid, Imlay&#x27;s American Topography, Arrowsmith, and Stockdale use the spelling Harpath River which differs from the modern spelling of “Harpeth”. The exception is John Russell&#x27;s 1794 map of the Southwest Territory published in London circa 1794. The earliest known written reference is found in the diary of John Lipscomb. His July 1784 entry mentions the “Harpath” river. In addition, contemporary historian Virginia Bowman gives credence to Hicks&#x27; theory in her comprehensive book on early sites and homes of Williamson County, Tennessee.

There is no dispute that the title of the song &quot;Harper Valley PTA&quot; by Tom T. Hall is derived from this stream, indirectly. Hall, long an area resident, says that the song&#x27;s name derives from Harpeth Valley Elementary School in Davidson County in Bellevue, but he also states that the song was definitely &quot;not&quot; based on any occurrence there; rather, he simply liked the sound of it.

<text>The Arden was a British automobile manufactured from 1912 to 1916 in Balsall Common, near Coventry. Starting out as a light and somewhat crude cyclecar, by the time production finished four years later, it had grown into a well-made four-cylinder car, featuring full four-seater coachwork.

The first model in 1912 was a 8 hp V-twin, air-cooled, 898 cc JAP-engined cyclecar with a wooden chassis. This continued in production until 1915.

This was supplemented in 1914 by the 10 hp, with either a water-cooled, Alpha 1104 cc two-cylinder or 1094 cc four-cylinder engine.

A larger car, the 11.9 hp with 1701 cc engine was made in 1916 only.

One Arden, a 1913 Alpha two-cylinder-engined two-seat model, is known to survive.

<doc id="857060" wikidata="Q4831682" url="?curid=857060" title="Ayrshire Coast Line">
<text>The Ayrshire Coast Line is one of the lines within the Strathclyde suburban rail network in Scotland. It has 26 stations and connects the Ayrshire coast to Glasgow. There are three branches, to , and , all running into the high level at . 

The route is operated by ScotRail.

==History==

The Ayrshire Coast Line consists of lines that were formerly part of the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway, the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway, the Ardrossan Railway and its Largs Branch extension.

===After electrification===

The line to Ayr was electrified and Class 318 electric multiple units introduced by British Rail in September 1986. The line was promoted as the &quot;Ayr&quot;Line in Scotrail publicity. Along with the introduction of new trains, major work was undertaken refurbishing stations, major trackworks and rebuilding many bridges. At the same time resignalling was carried out, replacing the existing semaphore signals. The full electrified service, including trains to Largs and Ardrossan Harbour, commenced on 19 January 1987. These were supplemented by occasional use of Class 303 and Class 311 EMUs, then in use on the Inverclyde Line. 

These EMUs replaced the Class 101 and Class 107 DMUs that had served the line for over 30 years. Class 126 DMUs were also used on the line, but they succumbed to old age in the early 1980s.

==Services 2024==
As of December 2024, There are 4 trains per hour running every 15 minutes between Glasgow Central and Kilwinning, 2 of these continue to Ayr while 1 an hour serves Ardrossan Harbour and Largs each. Extra trains run at peak hours with all trains calling at Paisley Gilmour Street, Johnstone and Kilwinning. There are occasionally extra services which run to/from Ardrossan Harbour to connect with CalMac sailings to/from Brodick on Arran, There is an hourly service which runs between Kilmarnock and Ayr which calls at Troon and at Prestwick* On a Sunday, there are 3 trains an hour, 2 to Ayr and 1 to Largs and 4 trains per day to/from Ardrossan Harbour to connect with ferries, There are no Sunday services to/from Kilmarnock.

*Not all Kilmarnock trains call at Prestwick Town and they do not call at Prestwick Airport

==Route==

The line runs along the same Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway route as the Inverclyde Line as far as , using different platforms at Paisley Gilmour Street, where it turns south west towards Kilwinning on the route of the former Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway. Here the line branches in two, with one branch running south along the coast to Troon and Ayr. This branch also serves Prestwick Airport station, which opened in 1994. The other branch runs north along the coast to Ardrossan or Largs, becoming a single track for passenger trains after Saltcoats. Beyond Ayr, &#x27;Sprinter&#x27; DMUs continue south towards Girvan and Stranraer.

The line connects with ferries at Ardrossan to Brodick on the Isle of Arran and at Largs to Great Cumbrae.

<text>Mikulčice () is a municipality and village in Hodonín District in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 2,000 inhabitants.

==Administrative division==
Mikulčice consists of two municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):
*Mikulčice (974)
*Těšice (921)

==Geography==
Mikulčice is located about southwest of Hodonín and southeast of Brno, on the border with Slovakia. It lies in a flat landscape of the Lower Morava Valley. The municipality is crossed by the Kyjovka River. The Czech-Slovak border is formed here by the Morava River.

==History==
From the 6th until the 10th century, a Slavic fortified settlement existed 3 km southeast from the modern village on the site called Mikulčice-Valy. The settlement was one of the main centres of the Great Moravian Empire, plausibly its capital city. Excavations unearthed the remnants of twelve churches, a palace, and more than 2,500 graves (including a horse burial).

The first written mention of Mikulčice is from 1141. The Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary was first mentioned in 1353. At the beginning of the 15th century, a fortress stood here. The fortress was probably destroyed during the Hussite Wars.

Mikulčice was heavily damaged by the 2021 South Moravia tornado.

==Demographics==
==Economy==

The local economy is predominantly based on agriculture and tourism. 

==Transport==
The I/55 road (the section from Břeclav to Hodonín) passes through the municipal territory.

The railway line Přerov–Břeclav runs through Mikulčice, but there is no train station. The municipality is served by the station in neighbouring Lužice.

==Sights==

The main landmark of Mikulčice is the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. The original Gothic building from the mid-14th century was replaced by the current structure around 1500. In 1605 and 1683, the church burned down and was reconstructed. In the 1730s, it was rebuilt in the Baroque style, but the Gothic core has been preserved.

The Mikulčice-Valy site is the main tourist attraction. It is freely accessible. It includes an exhibition with archeological finds from this area, administered by the Masaryk Museum in Hodonín. Since 1962, the site has been protected as a national cultural monument.

<doc id="857078" wikidata="Q221323" url="?curid=857078" title="Golden calf">
<text>According to the Torah and the Quran, the golden calf () was a cult image made by the Israelites when Moses went up to Mount Sinai. In Hebrew, the incident is known as &quot;the sin of the calf&quot; (). It is first mentioned in the Book of Exodus.

Bull worship was common in many cultures. In Egypt, whence according to the Exodus narrative, the Israelites had recently come, the bull-god Apis was a comparable object of worship. Some believe Yahweh, the national god of the Israelites, was associated with or pictured as a sacred bull through the process of religious assimilation and syncretism. Among the Canaanites, some of whom would become the Israelites, the bull was widely worshipped as the sacred bull and the creature of El.

==Biblical narrative==

When Moses went up Mount Sinai to receive the Ten Commandments (), he left the Israelites for forty days and nights. The Israelites feared that he would not return and demanded that Aaron make them &quot;a god who shall go before us&quot;. Aaron told the Israelites&#x27; to bring their golden earrings and ornaments in order to stall for time, constructed a &quot;golden calf&quot; and he declared, &quot;&#x27;This is your god, O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt!&#x27;&quot; ().

Aaron built an altar before the calf and proclaimed the next day to be a feast to (again in order to stall for time). &quot;Early next day, the people offered up burnt offerings and brought sacrifices of well-being; they sat down to eat and drink, and then rose to dance.&quot; () 

 told Moses what the Israelites were up to back in camp, that they had turned aside quickly from the way which God commanded them and he was going to destroy them and start a new people from Moses. Moses pleaded that they should be spared &quot;And renounced the punishment planned for God’s people.&quot; ()

Moses went down from the mountain; upon seeing the calf, he became angry and threw down the two Tablets of Stone, breaking them. Moses burnt the golden calf in a fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on water, and forced the Israelites to drink it. When Moses asked him, Aaron admitted to collecting the gold and throwing it into the fire; he said it came out as a calf. ()

===Exclusion of the Levites and mass execution===

The Bible records that the tribe of Levi did not worship the golden calf. Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Whoever is for YHWH, come here!” Then all the men of Levi rallied to him. 
==Other mentions in the Bible==

The golden calf is mentioned in .
The language suggests that there are some inconsistencies in the other accounts of the Israelites and their use of the calf. As the version in Exodus and 1 Kings are written by Deuteronomistic historians based in the southern Kingdom of Judah, there is a proclivity to expose the Israelites as unfaithful. The inconsistency is primarily located in Exodus 32:4 where &quot;gods&quot; is plural despite the construction of a single calf.

The episode of the golden calf is also mentioned in the New Testament, by the apostle Paul, in 1 Corinthians chapter 10, as a warning against idolatry. &quot;Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did. Do not be idolaters, as some of them were... .&quot;

Scholars are divided on other intertextual references to the golden calf in the Torah, notably the ordeal of the bitter water in the Book of Numbers 5:17–24. Specific elements of the ritual, such as the powder mixed into water and being forced to drink, echo similar language in the aftermath of Moses punishing Israel at the end of the narrative.

==Jeroboam&#x27;s golden calves at Bethel and Dan==
According to , after Jeroboam establishes the northern Kingdom of Israel, he contemplates the sacrificial practices of the Israelites.
His concern was that the tendency to offer sacrifices in Jerusalem, which is in the southern Kingdom of Judah, would lead to a return to King Rehoboam. He makes two golden calves and places them in Bethel and Dan. He erects the two calves in what he figures (in some interpretations) as substitutes for the &quot;cherubim&quot; built by King Solomon in Jerusalem.

However, in the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (v. VIII: 8), which is taken from the Septuagint, Josephus states: &quot;He made two golden heifers, and built two little temples for them, the one in the city Bethel, and the other in Dan...and he put the heifers into both the little temples in the aforementioned cities.&quot; 

Richard Elliott Friedman says &quot;at a minimum we can say that the writer of the golden calf account in Exodus seems to have taken the words that were traditionally ascribed to Jeroboam and placed them in the mouths of the people.&quot; Friedman believes that the story was turned into a polemic, exaggerating the throne platform decoration into idolatry, by a family of priests sidelined by Jeroboam.

The declarations of Aaron&#x27;s people and Jeroboam are almost identical: 
* &#x27;These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt&#x27; (Exod 32:4, 8);
* &#x27;Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt&#x27; (1 Kings 12:28)
After making the golden calf or golden calves, both Aaron and Jeroboam celebrate festivals. Aaron builds an altar and Jeroboam ascends an altar (Exod 32:5–6; 1 Kings 12:32–33).

==Jewish views==

In &quot;Legends of the Jews&quot;, the Conservative rabbi and scholar Louis Ginzberg wrote that the worship of the golden calf was the disastrous consequence for Israel who took a mixed multitude in their exodus from Egypt. Had not the mixed multitude joined them, Israel would not have been misled to worship this molten idol. The form of the calf itself came from a magical virtue of an ornament leaf with the image of the bull which is made by Aaron.

The devotion of Israel to this worship of the calf was partly explained by a circumstance at passing through the Red Sea, when they beheld the most distinct creature about the Celestial Throne which is the resemblance of ox, then they thought it was an ox who had helped God in their journey from Egypt. After seeing Hur, son of Miriam, who was carelessly murdered by the people following his rebuke of their ingratitude action to God, Aaron was willing rather to take a sin upon himself to make an idol than to cast the burden of an evil deed upon the people if they commit so terrible sin of killing a priest and prophet among them.

Also there would be among the Israelites no priestly caste, and the nation would have been a nation of priests only if Israel had not sinned through worshiping the golden calf that the greater part of the people lost the right to priesthood, except the tribe of Levi as the only tribe who remained faithful to God and did not partake in this sinful deed.

According to Nachman of Breslov, everyone contributed to the building of the Tabernacle, and the contribution that each Jew made was his or her good points. Thus, the Tabernacle was built by the good points found in each person; this was sufficient to counteract the blemish of the golden calf. The &quot;good points&quot; are reflected in the &quot;gold, silver and copper&quot; that the Jews donated. The various colors of these metals reflect the Supernal Colors and the beauty of a person&#x27;s good deeds.

==Christian views==
Justus Knecht gives two important moral points from the episode of the golden calf: 1) &quot;The Mercy of God.&quot; &quot;The people of Israel had sinned horribly against God by their idolatry, and yet, at Moses’ intercession, He forgave them.&quot; 2) &quot;Idolatry.&quot; &quot;The weak people were most ungrateful and faithless to God. The Lord had done such great things for them! Only forty days before, full of holy fear, they had heard His voice and had repeatedly promised obedience to His Commandments; and now they transgressed the first and most important of them, and forsook God to worship idols. Saint Paul calls lust and covetousness idolatry. Whenever a man loves anything more than he loves God, he is guilty of idolatry.&quot;

==Islamic views==
The incident of the worship of the golden calf is narrated in the second chapter of the Quran, named Al-Baqarah, and other works of Islamic literature. The Quran narrates that after they refused to enter the promised land, God decreed that as punishment the Israelites would wander for forty years. Moses continued to lead the Israelites to Mount Sinai for divine guidance. According to Islamic literature, God ordered Moses to fast for forty nights before receiving the guidance for the Israelites. When Moses completed the fasts, he approached God for guidance. During this time, Moses had instructed the Israelites that Aaron was to lead them.

The Israelites grew restless, since Moses had not returned to them, and after thirty days, a man the Quran names as Samiri raised doubts among the Israelites. Samiri claimed that Moses had forsaken the Israelites and ordered his followers among the Israelites to light a fire and bring him all the jewelry and gold ornaments they had. Samiri fashioned the gold into a golden calf along with the dust on which the angel Gabriel had trodden, which he proclaimed to be the God of Moses and the God who had guided them out of Egypt. There is a sharp contrast between the Quranic and the biblical accounts of the prophet Aaron&#x27;s actions. The Quran mentions that Aaron attempted to guide and warn the people from worshipping the golden calf. However, the Israelites refused to stop until Moses had returned. The righteous separated themselves from the pagans. God informed Moses that He had tested the Israelites in his absence and that they had failed by worshipping the golden calf.

Returning to the Israelites in great anger, Moses asked Aaron why he had not stopped the Israelites when he had seen them worshipping the golden calf. The Quran reports that Aaron stated that he did not act due to the fear that Moses would blame him for causing divisions among the Israelites and that he was afraid of being killed, he explained &quot;Son of my mother, indeed this people thought me to be weak, and they were about to kill me. So do not let the enemies gloat over me, and do not take me with the wrongdoing lot.&quot; Moses realized his helplessness in the situation, and both prayed to God for forgiveness. According to Qur’anic sources Moses then questioned Samiri for the creation of the golden calf; Samiri justified his actions by stating that he had thrown the dust of the ground upon which Gabriel had tread on into the fire because his soul had suggested it to him. Moses informed him that he would be banished and that they would burn the golden calf and spread its dust into the sea. Moses ordered seventy delegates to repent to God and pray for forgiveness. The delegates traveled alongside Moses to Mount Sinai, where they witnessed the speech between him and God but refused to believe until they had witnessed God with their sight. As punishment, God struck the delegates with lightning and killed them with a violent earthquake. Moses prayed to God for their forgiveness. God forgave and resurrected them and they continued on their journey.

In the Islamic view, the calf-worshipers&#x27; sin had been &quot;shirk&quot; (), the sin of idolatry or polytheism. &quot;Shirk&quot; is the deification or worship of anyone or anything other than God (Allah in Arabic) or more literally the establishment of &quot;partners&quot; placed beside God, a most serious sin.

==Historical interpretation==

Current historiography considers that this episode was introduced into the Exodus account in the time of Josiah (late 7th century BCE) or later to discredit the custom rooted in the Kingdom of Israel (North) of identifying Yahweh with a bull. The cult of the bull was rooted in Palestine from pre-Israelite times, as attested by the archaeological find of a bronze bull in the sanctuary of the acropolis of Jasor dated to the late Bronze Age. A bronze bull has also been found in an Israelite sanctuary east of Tel Dothan, in the mountains of Samaria, dated to around the 11th century BCE.

Albertz says that when we read in 1 Kings 12:28 that the first monarch of the northern kingdom, Jeroboam, had introduced the worship of golden calves in Bethel and Dan, we must interpret that what Jeroboam really does is to return to the traditional Israelite religion, as opposed to the syncretistic innovations introduced by David and Solomon in centralizing the cult in Jerusalem.

According to Michael Coogan, it seems that the golden calf was not an idol for another god, and thus a false god. He cites as evidence:
 Importantly, there is a single calf in this narrative. While the people refer to it as representative of the &quot;gods&quot;, this is a possessive form of the word Elohim ( &quot;elo&#x27;hecha&quot;, from ), which is a name of God as well as general word for &quot;gods&quot;. While a reference to singular god does not necessarily imply Yahweh worship, the word usually translated as &#x27;lord&#x27; is Yahweh in the original, so at least it cannot be ruled out. In the chronology of Exodus the commandment against the creation of graven images had not yet been given to the people when they pressed upon Aaron to help them make the calf, and that such behavior was not yet explicitly outlawed.

Another understanding of the golden calf narrative is that the calf was meant to be the pedestal of Yahweh. In Near Eastern art, gods were often depicted standing on an animal, rather than seated on a throne. This reading suggests that the golden calf was merely an alternative to the Ark of the Covenant or the cherubim upon which Yahweh was enthroned.

The reason for this complication may be understood as
# a criticism of Aaron, as the founder of one priestly house that rivaled the priestly house of Moses, and/or
# as &quot;an attack on the northern kingdom of Israel.&quot; The second explanation relies on the &quot;sin of Jeroboam,&quot; who was the first king of the northern kingdom, as the cause of the northern kingdom&#x27;s fall to Assyria in 722 BCE. Jeroboam&#x27;s &quot;sin&quot; was creating two calves of gold, and sending one to Bethel as a worship site in the south of the Kingdom, and the other to Dan as a worship site in the north, so that the people of the northern kingdom would not have to continue to go to Jerusalem to worship (see 1 Kings 12:26–30). According to Coogan, this episode is part of the Deuteronomistic history, written in the southern Kingdom of Judah, after the fall of the northern kingdom, which was biased against the northern kingdom. Coogan maintains that Jeroboam was merely presenting an alternative to the cherubim of the Temple in Jerusalem, and that calves did not indicate non-Yahwehistic worship.

The documentary hypothesis can be used to further understand the layers of this narrative: it is plausible that the earliest story of the golden calf was preserved by E (Israel source) and originated in the northern kingdom. When E and J (Judah source) were combined after the fall of northern kingdom, &quot;the narrative was reworked to portray the northern kingdom in a negative light,&quot; and the worship of the calf was depicted as &quot;polytheism, with the suggestion of a sexual orgy&quot; (see Exodus 32:6). When compiling the narratives, P (a later Priest source from Jerusalem) may have minimized Aaron&#x27;s guilt in the matter, but preserved the negativity associated with the calf.

Alternatively it could be said that there is no golden calf story in the J source, and if it is correct that the Jeroboam story was the original as stated by Friedman, then it is unlikely that the golden calf events as described in Exodus occurred at all. Friedman states that the smashing of the Ten Commandments by Moses when he beheld the worship of the golden calf, is really an attempt to cast into doubt the validity of Judah&#x27;s central shrine, the Ark of the Covenant. &quot;The author of E, in fashioning the golden calf story, attacked both the Israelite and Judean religious establishments.&quot;

===As adoration of wealth===
A metaphoric interpretation emphasizes the &quot;gold&quot; part of &quot;golden calf&quot; to criticize the pursuit of wealth. This usage can be found in Spanish where Mammon, the Gospel personification of idolatry of wealth, is not so current.

<text>The Argo was a short-lived American automobile manufactured by the Argo Motor Co in Jackson, Michigan, between 1914 and 1918. Previously, the factory had been used by the Standard Electric Car Co to build an electric car.

The company originally made the four-cylinder &quot;Motorvique&quot; cyclecar based on the Ajax built by the Briscoe brothers in France. It had a 4-cylinder 12 hp engine and was different from the French market Ajax only in that it did not use friction drive.

Few cyclecars sold well in America, and in 1916, it was replaced by a conventional 22 hp assembled touring car in an attempt to rival Ford at producing a &quot;motor car for the millions&quot;. The 1916 model sold for $405 in two-seater form.

In 1917 the company was sold to Mansell Hackett, and the name was changed to Hackett and moved its operations to Grand Rapids, Michigan.

The company had an unknown connection with the Saginaw, Michigan, based Argo Electric vehicle company.

<text>Cyclo-cross (cyclocross, CX, cyclo-X or ″cross) is a form of bicycle racing. Races typically take place in the autumn and winter (the international or &quot;World Cup&quot; season is October–February), and consist of many laps of a short (2.5–3.5 km or 1.5–2 mile) course featuring pavement, wooded trails, grass, steep hills and obstacles requiring the rider to quickly dismount, carry the bike while navigating the obstruction and remount. Races for senior categories are generally between 40 minutes and an hour long, with the distance varying depending on the ground conditions. The sport is strongest in the traditional road cycling countries such as Belgium (Flanders in particular), France and the Netherlands.

Cyclo-cross has parallels with mountain bike racing, cross-country cycling and criterium racing. Many of the best cyclo-cross riders cross train in other cycling disciplines; however, cyclo-cross has reached such size and popularity that some racers are specialists, and many prioritize cyclo-cross races over other disciplines. Cyclo-cross bicycles are similar to road racing bicycles: lightweight, with somewhat narrow tires and drop handlebars. They are typically differentiated by their greater tire clearances, lower gearing, stronger frames, cantilever brakes or disc brakes and more upright riding position. They also share characteristics with mountain bikes in that they use knobby tread tires for traction and disc brakes. They have to be lightweight because competitors need to carry their bicycle to overcome barriers or slopes too steep to climb in the saddle. The sight of competitors struggling up a muddy slope with bicycles on their shoulders is the classic image of the sport, although unridable sections are generally a very small fraction of the race distance.

Compared with many disciplines of road and track cycle racing, tactics are fairly straightforward, and the emphasis is on the rider&#x27;s aerobic endurance and bike-handling skills. Drafting, where cyclists form a line with the lead cyclist pedaling harder while reducing the wind resistance for other riders, is of much less importance than in road racing where average speeds are much higher than in cyclo-cross.

A cyclo-cross rider is allowed to change bicycles and receive mechanical assistance during a race. While the rider is on the course on one bike, their pit crew can clean, repair and oil a spare.

==Origins and history==
There are many stories about the origins of cyclo-cross. One is that European road racers in the early 1900s would race each other to the next town over from them and that they were allowed to cut through farmers&#x27; fields or over fences, or take any other shortcuts, in order to make it to the next town first. This was sometimes called steeple chase as the only visible landmark in the next town was often the steeple. This was a way for them to stay in shape during the winter months and put a twist on road racing. In addition, riding off-road in more difficult conditions than smooth pavement increased the intensity at which the cyclists were riding and improved their on-the-road bike handling abilities. Forced running sections, or &quot;portage&quot;, were incorporated to help deliver warm blood to the feet and toes, as well as exercise other groups of muscles. Daniel Gousseau of France is credited as having inspired the first cyclo-cross races and organized the first French National Championship in 1902. Géo Lefèvre, the originator of the idea for the Tour de France, also played a key role in the early days of the sport.

After Octave Lapize attributed his win in the 1910 Tour de France to his off season training in cyclo-cross the sport began to spread to countries bordering France. Belgium organized its first national championship in 1910, Switzerland did so in 1912, then Luxembourg in 1923, Spain in 1929 and Italy in 1930.

Cyclo-cross proved itself as a sport extending beyond the boundaries of France when in 1924 the first international race, Le Critérium International de Cross-Country Cyclo-Pédestre, was held in Paris.

Like many international cycle sports, cyclo-cross is administered by the Union Cycliste Internationale; although it was not until the 1940s, around 40 years after cyclo-cross&#x27; inception, that the UCI began its regulation and the first world championship was held in Paris in 1950.

The first United States Cyclo-cross National Championships took place on 20 October 1963, in Palos Park, IL, near Chicago. These championships in the midwest continued until 1969. Cyclo-cross began to become popular in the United States in the 1970s, in New England and California. The Cyclo-cross National Championships restarted in 1975 in Berkeley, CA and have continued to be held every year at various locations throughout the United States. The Surf City race series held in Santa Cruz, CA has contributed to the history of cyclo-cross in the United States. The sport has experienced a growth in popularity in the United States since the mid-1990s. Cyclo-cross races are now regularly held in the fall and winter seasons throughout the United States and continue to grow in popularity.

==Racing seasons==
Cyclocross is typically an autumn and winter sport, the northern hemisphere season running from September to February. The World Championships take place in late January. The Canada championships are held in November with the US and UK championships held in January. In the United States, there is little racing after that except in states with year-round warm climates such as Florida and California. The cyclocross racing season within southern hemisphere nations typically runs from May to August.

Riders&#x27; age categories for cyclocross under UCI rules are currently determined by their age on 1 January which lies in the middle of the international season, i.e. they compete in the same category that they would be in for the following road season.

==Equipment==

===Bicycles===

Cyclo-cross bicycles generally resemble road racing bicycles. Cyclo-cross-specific frames differ with their wider tire clearances, knobby tires, cantilever or disc brakes, and lower gearing. Cables are generally routed on the upper side of the top tube, which allows the rider to carry the bike comfortably on the right shoulder through portage sections, and prevents cable contamination by dirt. Popular on many cyclocross bikes is routing the brakes so that the right brake is often the front brake. This is done to allow the left hand to control speed while approaching obstacles requiring the bike to be carried, while the right hand grips the frame ready to lift the bike onto the shoulder as soon as the rider&#x27;s feet touch the ground. As a high-end bicycle purpose-built for a specific sport competition, they also differ from ordinary &quot;hybrid or trekking&quot; &quot;cross bikes&quot;, which are general-purpose utility bikes fitted with slightly wider 700C tires for use on unpaved paths or trails.

Cyclo-cross bike design and frame geometry has evolved over the years. The first cyclo-cross bikes were touring-type road bikes, used for their cantilever bosses, slacker angles and wider tire clearance. Over time as the sport became more formalized, frame angles changed for quicker handling and bottom brackets heights were raised to clear broken ground. Most cyclo-cross frames have a non-compact (flat or near-flat top tube) frame design for easier shouldering. Some design features have recently begun to change, for example, a heightened bottom bracket was typical 10+ years ago; now many cyclo-cross-specific frames do not have elevated bottom brackets, in fact many have a &quot;lower&quot; bottom bracket than road racing bicycles; this is favorable since the lower seat height makes for easier remounting, and a lower center of gravity increases stability. Many cyclo-cross bicycles are now set up with a single chainring and chain &quot;drop&quot; guards. A single chainring setup simplifies mechanics and reduces the chance of the chain derailing on a bumpy course. People who do run a double chain-ring set up on their bicycles generally use a 36–46 gearing. Many professional-level cyclo-cross bikes are set up with deep-section carbon tubular wheels, not for the purpose of aerodynamics, but to keep the wheel from being entrapped in deep sand or mud sections. Tubular tires are used to avoid pinch flats, decrease rolling resistance and increase grip with lower tire pressures. In addition, single speed cyclo-cross bikes are becoming increasingly popular for a variety of reasons, including lower initial cost of setup, ease of use and maintenance, and decreased likelihood of mechanical failure on the course.

===Clothing===

Clothing is similar to that of road racing. However, since cyclo-cross is a cold-weather sport there is an emphasis toward warmer clothing such as long sleeves, tights, knickers and arm and leg warmers. While many racers will use standard two-piece road kits, there is a very strong preference to wear one piece skinsuits to maximize freedom of movement. The other advantage of skinsuits is that they are tighter, preventing the jersey from getting caught on stray tree branches during some singletrack sections of the race course. The one piece construction of the skinsuit also prevents it from exposing the torso while the rider shoulders the bike. Mountain bike shoes are adopted, as they allow the competitors to run, unlike their road racing counterparts, and due to their degree of traction (compared to smooth bottoms found on road racing shoes). Toe spikes are used to aid in running up steep muddy slopes and in the adverse underfoot conditions. Full-finger gloves are optional but generally recommended for hand protection and for grip in muddy/wet situations. Experienced riders racing in dry conditions may eschew gloves, presumably for better tractional feedback though the handlebar, and more natural bike portage.

==Courses==
Races usually consist of many laps over a short course, ending when a time limit is reached, rather than after a specific number of laps or certain distance; the typical length for senior events is one hour, with 30 and 45 minute races for lower categories being the norm. Generally each lap is around 2.5–3.5 km and is 90% rideable. Races run under UCI rules must have courses that are always at least 3 m wide to encourage passing at any opportunity, but sections of singletrack are common for small races in the US and Great Britain. A variety of terrain is typical, ranging from roads to paths with short steep climbs, off camber sections, many corners and, a defining feature, sections where the rider may need, or would be best advised to dismount and run while carrying the bike. Under-tire conditions include asphalt, hardpack dirt, grass, mud and sand. In comparison to cross-country mountain bike events, terrain is smoother. Less emphasis is put on negotiating rough or even rocky ground with more stress on increased speed and negotiating different types of technical challenges. Drafting is of far less strategic importance than in road racing, though it can still be employed in paved sections or extremely windy conditions. Instead, tactics are chiefly focused on line choice, pacing strategy, passing technique, and racers&#x27; ability to identify and exploit sections of the course that are conducive to attacking or recovery.

Each section of the course typically lasts no longer than a handful of seconds. For example, long climbs are avoided in favour of short, sharp inclines. Sections are generally linked together, or long straights broken up, with tight corners. This not only allows a standard length course to fit in a relatively small area, but also forces competitors to constantly change speed and effort. Accelerating out of corners, then having to decelerate for the next before accelerating again is a common theme.
Obstacles that force a rider to dismount and run with their bike or to &quot;bunny hop&quot; include banks too steep to ride up, steps, sand pits and plank barriers. Besides the start/finish area, these obstacles may be placed anywhere on the course that the race director desires. Several race directors have tried to limit bunny hopping for safety reasons by placing barriers in pairs or in triple (although under UCI rule no more than two barriers can appear in succession). The maximum height for a barrier is 40 cm.

Since outside assistance is allowed, pits are included to provide a consistent area for this to occur. A pit to the right of the course is normal since most riders dismount to their left. In larger events a separate pit lane is featured so only those wishing a new bike or other assistance need enter the lane (this type was debuted at the Zeddam, Netherlands World Cup of January 1999). In some cases pits are provided in two different parts of the course.

Long-format races, in which riders compete cross country also exist. Examples include the Three Peaks Cyclo-Cross, a 61 km race, Barry-Roubaix, and the American UltraCX Championship Series which consists of seven stages ranging from 80 to 115 km.

==Technique==
Cyclo-cross courses require specific technical abilities of competitors. For example, dirt single-track and streams are also sometimes integrated into the course, depending on the location, both of which require rider experience and technique. Some course sections may be extremely muddy, wet or snowy, and others are dusty and sandy. Most of these conditions are usually considered too extreme to be ridden with the standard 32c tire, and so much of the challenge of cyclo-cross lies in maintaining traction through loose or slippery terrain at speed. 

Also common are steps, barriers, ditches, stairs, steep slopes and very deep mud or sand which all require running while carrying the bicycle. Therefore the ability to fluidly dismount at speed, pick up and carry the bike, then put it back down and remount without losing momentum is key, and a faulty or slow dismount/remount may cost valuable seconds, waste energy or cause the competitor to crash. Often, when sections are extremely technical or become impossible to ride due to erosion from repeated wear or inclement weather, the racer will carry the bike and jog for an extended time to save energy.

A more recent development to overcome obstacles such as barriers and sometimes ditches is the bunnyhop, a technique which came to prominence in 1989 when Danny De Bie used it in his successful World Championship run. Bunny hopping has become less popular as a result of race directors seeking to prevent its use by setting up two or three barriers in a row. Skilled riders are still able to hop the obstacles, despite the back to back to back barriers. Many riders, such as Sven Nys, an ex-BMX racer, were known for their technical skill in bunny-hopping over various obstacles.

== Pitting ==
Sometimes, when a bike is either damaged or clogged up with debris. Riders can enter the pits ( usually either signposted or between flags ) and either switch bikes ( if they have a second bike ) or clean their current one. Much like road racing, cyclists may have a support team. However, unlike road racing, the support team is confined to the pits.

==Status as Olympic sport==
Unlike mountain bike racing, cyclo-cross is not an olympic sport. Despite cyclo-cross not being a traditional snow or ice sport, since most competitive cyclo-cross is held during the winter season, and the races can be held on the frozen or snow covered ground, there has been talk of including cyclo-cross in the Winter Olympic Games.
To support the idea UCI added Cyclo-cross Val di Sole to the UCI Cyclo-cross World Cup in 2021, which was a race contested on a fully snow covered course in Val di Sole. The idea got new impulse when in 2024 UCI president David Lappartient and the president of World Athletics Sebastian Coe joined hands in pushing for both cyclo-cross as well cross-country running to be included in the 2030 Winter Olympics in French Alps. In 2025 UCI&#x27;s Sport Director Peter van den Abeele restated the idea.

<doc id="857102" wikidata="Q4789656" url="?curid=857102" title="Argonaut (automobile)">
<text>The Argonaut was an American automobile manufactured from 1959 to 1963, or at least the company is listed as being in existence during those years. The Argonaut Motor Machine Corporation was based in Cleveland, Ohio. The company&#x27;s president was Richard S. Luntz (1919–2006).

The company announced its production plans for a line of U.S.-made luxury cars in September 1958, planned as the finest and most luxurious in the world. The prices quoted ranged from a low of $28,600 to a high of $36,000; a variety of stainless and other special steels were proposed for the car&#x27;s manufacture. A supercharged V-12 ohc aluminum air-cooled engine developing some was designed for the Argonaut, and all cars were to carry a four-year guarantee. The company claimed, in its catalogue, that two of its models (the &quot;Smoke&quot; and the &quot;Raceway&quot;) had maximum speeds approaching 240 mph.

A number of high tech features were claimed, among them special tires with interwoven strands of steel to withstand sustained speeds of 200 mph, electric shock absorbers (individually adjustable from the cockpit) and 3 independent braking systems.

A news article about the Argonaut announcement appeared in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on September 14, 1958, and &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine published an article with several illustrations in the January 1959 issue, including a photo of a chassis and engine. A number of local articles also appeared in Cleveland area newspapers over the next few years. The &quot;Spotlight on Detroit&quot; column on page 12 of the December 1958 issue of Motor Trend Magazine (not available online) has pictures of the frame, a few parts including the instrument panel, and drawings of the different proposed body styles.

In a 1987 interview, Luntz said that an influential group of backers &quot;felt that to put Italian bodies on an American chassis would infuriate the steel companies&quot;. In one article, these Italian coachbuilders were stated to be Bertone and Touring. Luntz also stated that 3 Argonaut prototypes were built, but all research since has only verified one surviving example: a 392 cubic inch Chrysler marine V-8 engine and 3-speed manual overdrive transmission mounted in a custom-built rolling chassis, but without any body. This is the chassis that was publicly displayed and pictured in newspaper accounts of the period, and was listed (with photo) in an auction catalog from the late 1970s, then owned by a private New York State collector.

The Blackhawk Museum in Danville, California, featured a complete Argonaut automobile from 1988 up to about 1997, but this vehicle&#x27;s appearance bears only a vague resemblance to the Argonaut Raceaway. Rather, its beautifully finished boattail speedster body is more akin to a low-slung mid-1930s Duesenberg. This speedster may have been built on the &#x27;show&#x27; chassis; Blackhawk literature makes reference to a &#x27;240-MPH speedometer&#x27; and a chassis that is a &#x27;formidable feat of engineering&#x27;. As of 2005, the Blackhawk Museum was unaware of this car&#x27;s whereabouts. Two brief Facebook videos posted in 2017 show the boattail backing out of a shipping container in Japan and driving away.

<text>The Argonne was an American automobile manufactured from 1919 to 1920 by the Jersey City Machine Co. of Jersey City, New Jersey.

Only 24 were produced before the company folded. The prototype car was a sports roadster with an aluminum body crafted by the Schutte Body Co. of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It was powered by an inline-four Buda engine. A Rochester-Duesenberg power plant was also available. Production models included a roadster on a wheelbase, and some sources list an open Tourer model on a wheelbase.

The marque featured a sharply pointed radiator similar to that found on the Austro-Daimler.

<text>Lady Margaret Lee ( Wyatt; ) was an English courtier. She was a sister of the poet Thomas Wyatt and a friend of Queen Anne Boleyn, second wife of King Henry VIII of England. Historians have speculated that she may have been present during Boleyn&#x27;s execution.

==Family==
Margaret Wyatt was the daughter of Sir Henry Wyatt by Anne Skinner, the daughter of John Skinner of Reigate, Surrey. She had two brothers:

*Sir Thomas Wyatt, who married Elizabeth Brooke, the daughter of Thomas Brooke, 8th Baron Cobham, by Dorothy Heydon, daughter of Sir Henry Heydon and Elizabeth or Anne Boleyn, daughter of Sir Geoffrey Boleyn.
*Henry Wyatt, assumed to have died an infant.

==Life==

Margaret is best remembered for having been a companion of Anne Boleyn, whose family estates lay near the Wyatts&#x27; and who later employed Margaret as one of her ladies-in-waiting. A portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger shows a woman presumed to be Margaret at the age of thirty-four, and it is assumed that it was painted around 1540. It is therefore probable that Margaret was close to Anne in age, being born around 1506 (Anne&#x27;s date of birth is unknown, but is commonly thought to have been in 1501 or 1507).

Few question that there was some form of friendship between Lady Margaret and Queen Anne. There is also a strong tradition which states that Margaret&#x27;s sister, Mary, was also part of the Queen&#x27;s social circle and that Margaret&#x27;s brother, Thomas Wyatt, fell passionately in love with Anne in the 1520s. Another female favourite of the Queen&#x27;s was Lady Bridget Wingfield, who died while giving birth in 1534.

Margaret was one of Anne&#x27;s chief ladies-in-waiting, and accompanied her to Calais, France in 1532, where it is presumed Anne and Henry VIII made secret plans to marry in the immediate future. It is known that Anne had a lady-in-waiting who &quot;she loves as a sister&quot;, and it has been suggested that this lady was Margaret.

She was certainly part of the Queen&#x27;s circle of favourites. As Mistress of the Queen&#x27;s Wardrobe, she would presumably have played a leading part in the decadent social life at court in the mid-1530s, which was fuelled by the extravagance of Henry and Anne.

Lady Margaret was sent to attend her royal mistress in the Tower of London in May 1536 when the Queen was arrested on charges of adultery, treason and incest. She attended Anne on the scaffold on 19 May, and even received the last gift of a prayer book from her. Anne had written a short farewell inside the prayer book:
:&quot;Remember me when you do pray,
::that hope doth lead from day to day.&quot;

A sketch by the famed court artist Hans Holbein has been identified as being a sketch of a Queen Anne Boleyn when she was pregnant, but current research suggests that it might have been one of the Wyatt sisters — either Margaret or her sister, Mary.

Lady Margaret Lee is commemorated in &quot;Songs and Sonnets,&quot; also known as &quot;Tottel&#x27;s Miscellany,&quot; a poetry anthology published by the law printer Richard Tottel in 1557. The book contains poems written by Lady Margaret&#x27;s brother, Sir Thomas Wyatt, as well as poems by the Earl of Surrey, Nicholas Grimald and a number of anonymous poets. Grimald&#x27;s funeral elegy, &quot;An Epitaph of the Lady Margaret Lee&quot;, advises the reader, &quot;Man, by a woman learn, this life what we may call,&quot; and praises her &quot;blood, friendship, beauty, youth,&quot; and other qualities (no. 158, 1–2). Lady Margaret is one of several Tudor ladies memorialized in the volume.

==Marriage and issue==
About 6 July 1532 Margaret Wyatt married Sir Anthony Lee (d.1549), by whom she had four sons and five daughters:

*Sir Henry Lee.
*Robert Lee (died c.1598).
*Thomas Lee.
*Cromwell Lee (d.1601), who compiled an Italian-English dictionary.
*Anne Lee, who married Leonard Spenser of Naunton Hall in Rendlesham, Suffolk.
*Lettice Lee, who married Nicholas Cooke of Linstead, Suffolk.
*Katherine Lee, who married Gyles Symonds (died circa 1596) of Cley next the Sea, Norfolk.
*Joyce Lee, who married, on 29 November 1562, John Chenye, son of Sir Robert Chenye of Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire.
*Jane Lee, who married Peter Reade of Gimingham, Norfolk.

<doc id="857110" wikidata="Q190890" url="?curid=857110" title="Centered triangular number">
<text>A centered (or centred) triangular number is a centered figurate number that represents an equilateral triangle with a dot in the center and all its other dots surrounding the center in successive equilateral triangular layers.

This is also the number of points of a hexagonal lattice with nearest-neighbor coupling whose distance from a given point
is less than or equal to formula_1.

The following image shows the building of the centered triangular numbers by using the associated figures: at each step, the previous triangle (shown in red) is surrounded by a triangular layer of new dots (in blue).

==Properties==
*The gnomon of the &quot;n&quot;-th centered triangular number, corresponding to the (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-th triangular layer, is:

::formula_2

*The &quot;n&quot;-th centered triangular number, corresponding to &quot;n&quot; layers &quot;plus&quot; the center, is given by the formula:

::formula_3

*Each centered triangular number has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and the quotient (if positive) is the previous regular triangular number.

*Each centered triangular number from 10 onwards is the sum of three consecutive regular triangular numbers.

*For &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2, the sum of the first &quot;n&quot; centered triangular numbers is the magic constant for an &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot; normal magic square.

===Relationship with centered square numbers===
The centered triangular numbers can be expressed in terms of the centered square numbers:

==Lists of centered triangular numbers==
The first centered triangular numbers (&quot;C&quot;3,&quot;n&quot; &lt; 3000) are:

<doc id="857111" wikidata="Q176988" url="?curid=857111" title="Multilingual User Interface">
<text>Multilingual User Interface (MUI) enables the localization of the user interface of an application. 

MUI is provided by Microsoft as an integrated feature of its operating system Windows 11 down to Windows 2000 with some limitations in older versions. 

MUI is used for localizing flagship Microsoft products Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office and as an open technology can be used in any application that runs in a version of Windows that supports MUI. 

The core feature of MUI is the user-defined, system settings for preferred language that can be used/shared by all applications on a computer. The next most core feature is system functions (i.e. LoadString) that use this preference to load user interface assets at runtime from resources in the user&#x27;s preferred language. To be MUI-enabled, an application need only store user interface assets as language-specific resources and use LoadStrIng to load them at runtime. 

MUI also supports storing user interface assets as separate, single-language files which provides for development and deployment flexibility. This feature is optional. The resources can be stored in the application binary. 

MUI also provides system functions that allow for custom and extended localization behavior. 

== Overview ==
The MUI technology is integrated into the Windows OS and can be leveraged in an application by storing localizable assets as resources in a prescribed way and using MUI-enabled win32 functions to read the resources.

A relatively simple implementation of MUI in an application stores the strings of each language in a string-table resource of the binary file and uses the win32 function LoadString to load strings at runtime. No other MUI related configuration or code is required. The following optional capabilities of MUI can be implemented if desired:

* Store the resources of each language in a separate DLL in order to enable deployment/installation flexibility
* An application can use dedicated MUI functions to provide more control of localizable asset consumption such as using a language other than the system-defined user preference
* Localizable assets can be stored in a format other than resource
The design of MUI attempts to provide a common way to store application localization information that alleviates limitations of more traditional and monolithic designs for localization such as including all languages in the application logic files (i.e. resources). With MUI, the following deployment scenarios are possible:
* Add support for a language by installing only languages files -- without modifying application logic or other language files
* Add new features and fix bugs by installing only application logic files -- without modifying the installed language files

=== Terminology ===
The following MUI related terms are either used in or derived from the Microsoft documentation.

Language-neutral (LN): Describes something that conveys a meaning regardless of the languages of the viewer, such as an image without text or other localizable aspects

LN resource: a resource that is shared by and installed for all language versions of the application

LN file: Windows binary containing the application logic and language-neutral resources

Language-specific (LS): Describes something that has significantly different meaning based on the languages of the viewer. The most common LS items are interface strings but can be other items such as an image with text in it

LS resource file: A set of resources localized for one language; a.k.a. MUI file

=== Language Preferences ===
A language selection is stored by the system for the system (shared by all users and maybe used as default for a new user) and for each user. These selections can be modified by the user via the system Control Panel but cannot be modified by an application. 

These preferences control the language that the OS uses for UI elements. Applications can also use these preferences, and via MUI-enabled system functions (such as LoadString) the use is automatic and transparent (requires no MUI-specific code to use). But use of these preferences is optional and customizable. An application can be designed to ignore the language preferences. Or it may use them in ways other than that provided by MUI-enabled system functions. 

An application can use MUI functions to read language preferences -- that default to the user selection [assumed] and are a list of languages in preference order. These preferences are provided at the system, user, process and thread levels [assumed that changing at a higher level modifies the preferences for lower levels]. 

An application can modify these language preference lists (via SetThreadPreferredUILanguages and other functions) in order to influence the behavior of MUI. For example: 

LPCWSTR languageIdSpec = L&quot;en-US\0&quot;;
ULONG langCount = 1;
if (!SetThreadPreferredUILanguages(MUI_LANGUAGE_NAME, languageIdSpec, &amp;langCount))
 MessageBoxW(NULL, L&quot;Unable to set thread preferred UI language.&quot;, NULL, MB_ICONERROR);
=== Resource Storage ===
MUI provides support for localized resources stored in Windows binary (a.k.a. Win32 PE) files (DLL, EXE, SYS) -- usually DLL files. 

The resources for a language can either be stored in the application binary or in a MUI (a.k.a. LS) file -- one per language. For MUI to find resources, a MUI file must be in the same directory as its associated LN file and be named the same as the LN file plus &quot;.&quot;LCID&quot;.mui&quot;. For example, for LN file my-lib.dll, the MUI file for en-US would be named my-lib.dll.0409.mui.

String resources are coded as string table like so:
 LANGUAGE LANG_ENGLISH, SUBLANG_NEUTRAL
 STRINGTABLE
 BEGIN
 1 L&quot;message text&quot;
 END

=== Resource Retrieval ===
Several win32 functions that read application resources are MUI-enabled, including LoadString, FormatMessage, and LoadImage. 

Each function attempts to read a resource for a language as selected by global language preferences, from application resources or associated MUI files (co-located with LN file and following naming convention). Each uses the global language preferences to choose a language that is available. If loading the resource for the first preferred language fails either because the MUI file does not exist or the resource does not exist in the MUI file, the function will try the next preferred language and so on until all preferences have been tried. If load fails for all preferred languages, then tries the LN file.

The most commonly used function is LoadString which loads strings from a string-table resource. Example using LoadString:

wchar_t *resourceCharArray;
int resourceLength = LoadStringW(moduleHandle, resourceId, (LPWSTR)&amp;resourceCharArray, 0);
if (!resourceLength)
 MessageBoxW(NULL, L&quot;Unable to find resource.&quot;, NULL, MB_ICONERROR);
 return -1;

wchar_t *text = (LPWSTR)malloc((resourceLength + 1) * sizeof(wchar_t));
wcsncpy(text, resourceCharArray, resourceLength);
text[resourceLength] = L&#x27;\0&#x27;; // null terminate

This retrieves the address of the resource text character buffer which is not guaranteed to be null terminated. Then, this copies the characters to a new buffer and appends a null terminator. Another option is to have LoadString copy the string to a passed buffer, but that requires using a fixed-length buffer which has downsides like usually allocating more than needed or truncation if too short.

Oddly, MS documentation for LoadString does not mention its interaction with MUI -- use of language preference.

FormatMessage is also MUI-enabled. Its function reference page describes its interaction with the user&#x27;s language preference when parameter dwLanguageId is passed as 0. But FormatMessage reads from a &quot;message&quot; table, not a &quot;string&quot; table and as Raymond Chen says, &quot;nobody actually uses message tables&quot;.

=== Non-Resource Storage and Retrieval ===
MS documentation recommends storing UI assets as resources since MUI fully supports retrieving from this storage, but it notes that MUI supports any other file format, such as XML, JSON or flat text file. This implies that using the resource retrieval aspect of MUI is not required for an application to be MUI-enabled. An application can use its own, custom UI asset retrieval logic.

To be MUI-enabled, the application must use the system language preferences. The custom UI asset retrieval logic might optionally use the MUI function GetFileMUIPath to leverage the MUI file location and naming conventions.

=== Other Aspects ===
The MS MUI documentation describes the following concepts, but it is unclear how they relate to MUI and what value they offer:

* Resource Configuration File
* Registry String Redirection

== Implementing ==

Basic tasks to support/implement MUI:

* Use LoadString in the application code to read resources; it uses user preference, system settings to read resources that are in the language that is most preferred by the user based on availability
* Author resource source code (RC) for each language; recommended to store each language in a separate RC file
Upon completing the basic tasks, an application is MUI-enabled. But there are other features of MUI that an application can optionally take advantage of.

The basic tasks imply storing all languages in the resources of the application binary -- which means it is &quot;not&quot; language neutral. This structure provides all runtime localization benefits of MUI and simple, single-file deployment but does not allow for deployment flexibility that MUI provides. In order to take advantage of the deployment flexibility:

*Configure the application binary project to exclude all LS resources -- making it the LN file
*Configure project(s) to build each language to a resource DLL; named the same as the LN file + &quot;&quot;LCID&quot;.mui&quot; -- MUI files
*Deploy/install MUI files in same directory as the LN file

To store localized assets in formats other than resource, the application must implement a mechanism for reading assets at runtime based on the language preference system settings (see GetThreadUILanguage). In other words, the application loads UI assets based on the system language preference settings without using LoadString. The application might leverage the MUI file-per-language location and naming convention by using GetFileMUIPath.

== Advantages over Localized Version ==
The MUI technology was developed in response and as an improvement to &quot;localized versions&quot; -- an older technology for globalizing and deploying software packages. This section describes the differences and advantages of MUI over localized versions.

Windows localized via a MUI pack achieves the same goal as a localized version, but there are key differences. While both display menus and dialogs in the targeted language, only a localized version uses translated file and folder names. [what does this mean? some special folders are localizable (Documents, Downloads, ...) but a user created file/folder is not localizable (by the OS). Doesn&#x27;t a language pack localize the special folder names? What else could it do?]

A localized version of Windows translates the base operating system, as well as all included programs [what programs?], including file and folder names [so it does localize file/folder names. this contradicts above], objects names [what&#x27;s an object?], strings in registry [really? what strings?], and any other internal strings used by Windows into a particular language. Localized versions of Windows support upgrading from a previous localized version and user interface resources are completely localized, which is not the case for MUI versions of a product. [what is not the case for MUI?]

A MUI version does not contain translated administrative functions such as registry entries [registry entries are functions?] and items in Microsoft Management Console. 

One advantage of a MUI version is that each user of a computer can use a different language. For a localized version of the OS, this is not possible. It may be possible for localized applications but requires installing multiple versions; one for each language, and this may lead to application storage space and side-by-side installation issues. With MUI, the single version supports multiple languages, and the OS and applications use the user&#x27;s preferred language. Further, the same OS can host an application that uses any of the application&#x27;s supported languages which may be different than the OS selected language and even a language that&#x27;s not supported by the OS.

== History ==
MUI was introduced with Windows 2000 and is supported in each subsequent Windows release.

=== Windows 2000 and Windows XP ===
MUI products for these versions were available only through volume agreements from Microsoft. They were not available through retail channels. However, some OEMs distributed the product.

==== Languages in Windows XP ====
Up to Windows XP, MUI packs for a product are applied on top of an English version to provide a localized user experience. There are a total of 5 sets of MUI packs.

=== Windows Vista ===
Windows Vista enhanced MUI technology to separate the English resources from the application logic binary files. The application logic files are now language-neutral a.k.a. language-independent. In other words, the application logic files are no longer English-centric. This separation allows for changing languages completely without changing the core binaries of Windows, and to have multiple languages installed using the same application logic binaries. Languages are applied as language packs containing the resources required to localize part of or the entire user interface in Windows Vista.

MUI packs are available to Windows Vista Enterprise users and as an Ultimate Extras to Windows Vista Ultimate users.

Beginning with Windows Vista, the set of associated MUI APIs are also made available to developers for application development. [This allows anyone to use the MUI technology?]

=== Windows 7 ===
MUI is available to Windows 7 Enterprise and Ultimate edition users, as well as Windows Phone 7.

Beginning with Windows 7, Microsoft started referring to a &quot;MUI pack&quot; as a &quot;Language Pack&quot;; not to be confused with a Language Interface Pack (LIP).

=== Windows 8/8.1/RT ===
Beginning with Windows 8/RT, most editions of Windows are able to download and install all Language Packs, with a few exceptions:

* In Single Language editions of Windows, only one language pack is allowed to be installed, the same behavior as editions of Windows 7 and earlier that are not Enterprise or Ultimate.
* In OEM editions of Windows, the exact language packs that are preinstalled/available for download depend on the device manufacturer and country/region of purchase (and the mobile operator for devices with cellular connectivity). This is a mixture of a local-market feature and a feature for everyone everywhere. There may be multiple display languages preinstalled on the device by the manufacturer and/or wireless carrier, but each manufacturer and/or wireless carrier installs two different sets of languages: one set of preloaded languages and one set of languages that can be installed by the end user. This rule is currently used in Windows Phones as of Windows Phone 7 and PCs as of Windows 8 (since Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 share the same Windows NT kernel) and was later dropped in Windows 10 version 1803, but was later quietly reinstated as of Windows 10 version 1809. An end user could install a retail license on top of an OEM license by performing a clean install through the Media Creation Tool to circumvent the region locking and install any display language that they want.
**The Windows update process does not affect the currently installed display languages in any way, but it may give the end user access to newly released language packs made available by the OEM (PCs only). However, when installing a new feature update, it may change the display language back to the one set during the initial setup process. For example, if the Samsung ATIV Smart PC on AT&amp;T is upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 Anniversary Update (not necessarily done in one go), it will now be able to install Portuguese (Brazil), Vietnamese, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), and Japanese in addition to English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Korean (the last three languages can be downloaded by the end user at the time of its launch), just like with the Galaxy S8 series and the Verizon-based Galaxy Book.
**On the other hand, a Samsung Galaxy Book device does not support Afrikaans as a display language, because Samsung apps do not officially support Afrikaans. Furthermore, cellular variants of the Galaxy Book laptops sold in North America support fewer display languages than their Wi-Fi-only counterparts, just like on their smartphones.
**Certain language packs like English (Australia) and English (Canada) are only supported on the Xbox consoles and the Surface Duo.
**Some LIP packs require certain MUI packs (base languages) to be present or compatible. If that base language is not present or compatible, then that LIP cannot be installed on that device.

=== Windows 10 ===
Beginning with Windows 10 version 1803, Microsoft started using the term &quot;Local Experience Pack&quot; (LXP) in some places [store?] instead of the older term &quot;Language Pack&quot;, but they work the same way. In addition to installing via Windows Settings, these 110 LXPs are also available through the Microsoft Store (app and web); the latter enabling remote installation for consumer editions of Windows. As with all applications from the Microsoft Store, only the LXPs that are compatible with that Windows device are shown in the Microsoft Store app. 

An LXP is updated through the Microsoft Store; outside of the normal Windows update cycle.

== Supported languages ==
Supported languages by OS version is as follows:

=== PC ===


=== Mobile ===
The multilingual user interface for Windows Phones did not appear until version 7.0.
== Patent ==
The MUI technology is covered by an international patent titled &quot;Multilingual User Interface for an Operating System&quot;. The inventors are Bjorn C. Rettig, Edward S. Miller, Gregory Wilson, and Shan Xu.

<text>The Argus was a German automobile manufactured by &amp; Co from 1902 to 1904, from 1904 to 1906, and then from November 1906 to 1945.
The company was founded by Henri Jeannin in Berlin, and originally built copies of Panhard &amp; Levassor cars; they also featured P&amp;L engines, and most of the other components of the vehicles came from France. In 1903 the company began producing engines of its own design; Argus cars now had 2,380 cc two-cylinder engines, and 4,960 cc and 9,240 cc four-cylinder engines.

The company went on to produce marine and aero engines. In 1929 they briefly returned to car engines making some for Horch.

<doc id="857127" wikidata="Q8159" url="?curid=857127" title="Paul Bocuse">
<text>Paul François Pierre Bocuse (; 11 February 1926 – 20 January 2018) was a French chef based in Lyon known for the quality of his restaurants and his innovative approaches to cuisine. Dubbed &quot;the pope of gastronomy&quot;, he was affectionately nicknamed Monsieur Paul (Mister Paul). The Bocuse d&#x27;Or, a biennial world chef championship, bears his name.

After completing his formal education and fighting to liberate France, Bocuse enrolled in a culinary apprenticeship in Pollionnay with chef Eugénie Brazier. Under the guidance of some of the most skilled and experienced Mères from the Lyon area, he honed his skills in French cuisine. He then took over the family restaurant, L&#x27;Auberge du Pont de Collonges, to turn it into one of the most renowned restaurants in the world; from 1965, it held its 3-star rating in the Michelin Guide for a record 55 years.

Bocuse was one of the most prominent chefs associated with the then-emerging &quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot;, which is less opulent and calorific than the traditional &quot;cuisine classique&quot; and stresses the importance of fresh ingredients of the highest quality. However, Bocuse also criticised some &quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot; tendencies, stating &quot;&quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot; was nothing on the plate, everything on the bill&quot;. Bocuse claimed that Henri Gault first used the term to describe food prepared by Bocuse and other top chefs for the maiden flight of the Concorde airliner in 1969.

Bocuse inspired the character of chef Auguste Gusteau in the 2007 animated film &quot;Ratatouille&quot;, directed by Brad Bird, the plot line of which was also influenced by fellow chef Bernard Loiseau&#x27;s life story.

==Early years and liberation of France==
A turbulent student at school, Bocuse was put into an apprenticeship by his father Georges Bocuse with chef Claude Maret in Lyon at age 16, at his Restaurant de la Soierie. At 18, Bocuse joined the French Liberation Army as a volunteer. Severely wounded after being struck by an enemy bullet in fights with the German occupier in Alsace, he was taken in at an American infirmary, where American soldiers tattooed him a Gallic rooster on his left shoulder. He was decorated with the &quot;Croix de Guerre 1939–1945&quot;.

After the war, he joined Eugénie Brazier as one of her students. From the war, he said: &quot;Life can end at any second. So you have to work as if you were going to die at 100 and live as if you were going to die tomorrow.&quot;

==Contributions to French gastronomy==
Although associated with &quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot;, Bocuse would later say not seeing the point of &quot;peas cut into quarters&quot;, adding: &quot;For me, good cooking is when you lift the lid, it steams, it smells good and you can help yourself to seconds.&quot;

Bocuse made many contributions to French gastronomy both directly and indirectly, because he had numerous students, many of whom have become notable chefs themselves. One of his students was Austrian Eckart Witzigmann, one of four &quot;Chefs of the Century&quot; and chef at the first German restaurant to receive three Michelin stars. Since 1987, the Bocuse d&#x27;Or has been regarded as the most prestigious award for chefs in the world (at least when French food is considered), and is sometimes seen as the unofficial world championship for chefs. Bocuse received numerous awards throughout his career, including the medal of commandeur of the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

The Culinary Institute of America honoured Bocuse in their Leadership Awards Gala on 30 March 2011. He received the &quot;Chef of the Century&quot; award. In July 2012 the Culinary Institute of America announced in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that they would change the name of their Escoffier Restaurant to the Bocuse Restaurant, after a year-long renovation.

In 1975, he created &quot;soupe aux truffes&quot; (truffle soup) for a presidential dinner at the Élysée Palace. Since then, the soup has been served in Bocuse&#x27;s restaurant near Lyon as &quot;Soupe V.G.E.&quot;, VGE being the initials of former president of France Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing.

==Restaurants==
Bocuse&#x27;s main restaurant, L&#x27;Auberge du Pont de Collonges, is a luxury establishment near Lyon, which has been serving a traditional menu for decades. It was one of only 27 restaurants in France to receive a three-star rating in 2017 by the Michelin Guide. However, it lost its record-breaking 55-year long 3-star rating in the 2020 Michelin Guide, sparking controversy in the French culinary world. He also operated a chain of brasseries in Lyon, named Le Nord, L&#x27;Est, Le Sud and L&#x27;Ouest, each of which specialise in a different aspect of French cuisine.

Paul Bocuse&#x27;s son, Jérôme, manages the &quot;Les Chefs de France&quot; restaurant which the elder Bocuse co-founded with Roger Vergé and Gaston Lenôtre and is located inside the French pavilion at Walt Disney World&#x27;s EPCOT.

Bocuse was considered an ambassador of modern French cuisine. He was honoured in 1961 with the title Meilleur Ouvrier de France. He had been apprenticed to Fernand Point, a master of classic French cuisine. Bocuse dedicated his first book to him.

==Institut Paul Bocuse Worldwide Alliance==
In 2004, the Institut Paul Bocuse Worldwide Alliance was created. In 2014, the Alliance brought together students of 14 nationalities for a course in Lyon. Notable alumni include the Lebanese chef Tara Khattar.

==Death==
Bocuse died of Parkinson&#x27;s disease on 20 January 2018 at age 91 in Collonges-au-Mont-d&#x27;Or, north of Lyon, in the same room above his restaurant, L&#x27;Auberge du Pont de Collonges, in which he was born in 1926. His son Jérôme asked there not be a national tribute, stating it is not what his father would have wanted, remembering a &quot;simple&quot; man; President Emmanuel Macron recognised a &quot;mythical figure&quot; who represented &quot;French gastronomy in its generosity, its respect for traditions but also its inventiveness&quot;.

<text>George David Aiken (August 20, 1892 – November 19, 1984) was an American politician and horticulturist. A member of the Republican Party, he was the 64th governor of Vermont (1937–1941) before serving in the United States Senate for 34 years, from 1941 to 1975. At the time of his retirement, he was the most senior member of the Senate, a feat which would be repeated by his immediate successor Patrick Leahy.

As governor, Aiken battled the New Deal over its programs for hydroelectric power and flood control in Vermont. As a Northeastern Republican in the Senate, he was one of four Republican cosponsors of the Full Employment Act of 1946. Aiken sponsored the food allotment bill of 1945, which was a forerunner of the food stamp program. He promoted federal aid to education and sought to establish a minimum wage of 65 cents in 1947. Aiken was an isolationist in 1941 but supported the Truman Doctrine in 1947 and the Marshall Plan in 1948.

In the 1960s and 1970s, he steered a middle course on the Vietnam War, opposing Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s escalation and supporting Richard Nixon&#x27;s slow withdrawal policies. Aiken was a strong supporter of the small farmer. As acting chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee in 1947, he opposed high rigid price supports. He had to compromise, however, and the Hope-Aiken Act of 1948 introduced a sliding scale of price supports. In 1950, Aiken was one of seven Republican senators who denounced in writing the tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy, warning against those who sought &quot;victory through the selfish political exploitation of fear, bigotry, ignorance and intolerance.&quot;

==Early life==
George David Aiken was born in Dummerston, Vermont, to Edward Webster and Myra (née Cook) Aiken. In 1893, he and his parents moved to Putney, where his parents grew fruits and vegetables and his father served in local offices including school board member, select board member, and member of the Vermont House of Representatives. Aiken received his early education in the public schools of Putney, and graduated from Brattleboro High School in 1909. Aiken developed a strong interest in agriculture at an early age, and became a member of the Putney branch of the Grange in 1906. In 1912, he borrowed $100 to plant a patch of raspberries; within five years, his plantings grew to five hundred acres and included a nursery. From 1913 to 1917, Aiken grew small fruits in Putney with George M. Darrow as &quot;Darrow &amp; Aiken.&quot; In 1926, Aiken became engaged in the commercial cultivation of wildflowers. He published &quot;Pioneering With Wildflowers&quot; in 1933 and &quot;Pioneering With Fruits and Berries&quot; in 1936. He also served as president of the Vermont Horticultural Society (1917–1918) and of the Windham County Farm Bureau (1935–1936).

In 1914, Aiken married Beatrice Howard, to whom he remained married until her death in 1966. The couple had three daughters, Dorothy Howard, Marjorie Evelyn (who married Harry Cleverly), and Barbara Marion; and one son, Howard Russell. In 1967 Aiken married his longtime administrative assistant, Lola Pierotti. Lola Aiken remained active in Republican politics until her death in 2014 at age 102.

==Early political career==
Aiken served as a school board member in Putney from 1920 to 1937. A Republican, he unsuccessfully ran for the Vermont House of Representatives in 1922. In 1930, he ran successfully. He was reelected in 1932 and served from 1931 to 1935. As a state representative, he became known for his opposition to private power companies over the issue of dam construction. Aiken was elected as Speaker of the House in 1933, over the opposition of the Republican establishment. As Speaker, he shepherded the passage of the Poor Debtor Law, which protected people who could not pay their obligations during the Great Depression.

In 1934, Aiken won election as Lieutenant Governor of Vermont. During his 1935 to 1937 term, Democrats had achieved more representation in the Vermont Senate than they had previously, though with only seven senators as compared to 23 Republicans, they were still heavily in the minority. Aiken used his position on the senate&#x27;s Committee on Committees — the lieutenant governor, President pro tempore of the Vermont Senate, and a senator elected by the rest of the body — to ensure that Democrats were fairly represented on the senate&#x27;s committees. As a result of Aiken&#x27;s initiative, Democrats were represented on almost every committee, and constituted a majority on two. In addition, Aiken ensured that Elsie C. Smith, the state senate&#x27;s only female member, was fairly considered with respect to committee assignments; in fact, Senator Smith was appointed to more committees than any of her peers.

==Governor of Vermont==
In 1936, Aiken won election as governor, serving from 1937 to 1941. Aiken earned a reputation as a moderate to liberal Republican, supporting many aspects of the New Deal, but opposing its flood control and land policies. In his second term the governor launched attacks on electric utility companies, and sponsored a bill that made the Public Service Commission independent of the utilities for technical advice. To continue the effort to form a consumer-oriented PSC, he named the former head of the Vermont Farm Bureau as its chairman.

When only Vermont and Maine voted Republican in the 1936 presidential election, Aiken thought he was in a good position to exert national leadership in the GOP. He issued manifestos calling for a more liberal approach and sought national support. He wrote an open letter to the Republican National Committee in 1937 criticizing the party and claimed Abraham Lincoln &quot;would be ashamed of his party&#x27;s leadership today&quot; during a 1938 Lincoln Day address. During the 1940 presidential campaign, however, conservative Republicans favored Senator Robert Taft of Ohio, liberals were behind New York County District Attorney Thomas Dewey, and the media was enthusiastic for Wall Street tycoon Wendell Willkie, so Aiken&#x27;s nascent campaign went nowhere.

During his administration, Aiken reduced the state&#x27;s debt, instituted a &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; road-building program, and convinced the federal government to abandon its plan to control the Connecticut River Valley flood reduction projects. He also broke the monopolies of many major industries, including banks, railroads, marble companies, and granite companies. He also encouraged suffering farmers in rural Vermont to form co-ops to market their crops and get access to electricity.

He portrayed himself in populist terms as the defender of farmers and &quot;common folk&quot; against the Proctor family and other members of the conservative Republican establishment, and with Ernest W. Gibson and Ernest W. Gibson Jr. became recognized as a leader of Vermont&#x27;s progressive Republicans, which came to be known as the party&#x27;s Aiken-Gibson Wing. Aiken was also an opponent of the policies of Vermont&#x27;s large utilities and railroads; when Aiken ran for the U.S. Senate in 1940, the pro-business wing of the party endorsed Ralph Flanders. Aiken defeated Flanders in the GOP Senate primary in 1940 and was easily elected that fall to complete the remainder of Gibson&#x27;s term. He served until 1975, and was always reelected by large majorities.

==U.S. Senate==

Senator Ernest Willard Gibson died on June 20, 1940; on June 24, 1940, Aiken appointed Ernest W. Gibson Jr. to fill the vacancy pending a special election for the four years remaining on the senior Gibson&#x27;s term. The younger Gibson served as a caretaker Senator until January 3, 1941, but did not run in the election to fill the vacancy. He was succeeded by Aiken, who won the special election. Political observers assumed that the younger Gibson accepted the temporary appointment to facilitate Aiken&#x27;s election; knowing that Aiken desired to become a senator, he accepted the appointment and agreed not to run in a primary against Aiken, which another appointee might have done. Ernest Gibson Jr. was willing to fill the vacancy temporarily and then defer to Aiken because Gibson hoped to serve as governor. Aiken was elected on November 5, 1940, and took his seat in January, 1941. He was re-elected in 1944, 1950, 1956, 1962, and 1968. During his time in the Senate, he served in a number of leadership roles including chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in Executive Departments in the 80th Congress and the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry in the 83rd Congress.

He was a proponent of many spending programs such as Food Stamps and public works projects for rural America, such as rural electrification, flood control and crop insurance. He also had a great affection for the natural beauty of his home state, saying &quot;some folks just naturally love the mountains, and like to live up among them where freedom of thought and action is logical and inherent.&quot; His views were at odds with those of many Old Guard Republicans in the Senate.

The role of labor unions, or more exactly the federal role in balancing the rights of labor and management, was a central issue in the 1940s. Aiken stood midway between the pro-union Democrats and the pro-management Republicans. He favored settling labor disputes by negotiation, not in Congress and courts. He voted against the stringent Case labor bill promoted by conservative Republicans. They in turn blocked Aiken&#x27;s appointment to the Labor and Public Welfare Committee and persuaded conservative leader Robert A. Taft to chair it. Aiken spoke out in favor of unions but voted for Taft&#x27;s Taft Hartley Act of 1947, and for overriding President Truman&#x27;s veto. He argued that it was a lesser evil than the Case bill.

Aiken voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court, while Aiken did not vote on the Civil Rights Act of 1960. At first he supported civil rights but by the 1960s he took a more ambiguous position. He consistently favored civil rights legislation, from the Civil Rights Act of 1957 to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but usually with important qualifications and amendments. This ambiguity, which some called obstructionism, was criticized by militant civil rights groups and the NAACP.

Aiken took an ambivalent position on the Vietnam War (1965–1975), changing along with the Vermont mood. Neither a hawk nor a dove, he was sometimes called an &quot;owl.&quot; He reluctantly supported the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution of 1964 and was more enthusiastic in support of Nixon&#x27;s program of letting South Vietnam do the fighting using American money. Aiken is widely quoted as saying that the U.S. should declare victory and bring the troops home. His actual statement was:
:&quot;The United States could well declare unilaterally ... that we have &#x27;won&#x27; in the sense that our armed forces are in control of most of the field and no potential enemy is in a position to establish its authority over South Vietnam,&quot; and that such a declaration &quot;would herald the resumption of political warfare as the dominant theme in Vietnam.&quot;

He added: &quot;It may be a far-fetched proposal, but nothing else has worked.&quot;

His base in Vermont was solid; he spent only $17.09 on his last reelection bid. A north-south avenue on the west side of the public lawn at the Vermont State House has been named for him. He left office in 1975, succeeded by the first Democrat to represent Vermont in the Senate, Patrick Leahy. Leahy went on to become the Dean of the Senate, the title Aiken possessed when he left the chamber. Aiken and Leahy held the same Senate seat for more than 80 years combined, making them the back-to-back pair of Senators to hold the same seat for the longest. When Leahy retired at the end of the 117th Congress in January 2023, the two had held Vermont&#x27;s Class 3 seat for a combined 81 years, 11 months, and 24 days.

==Committee assignments==
==Retirement and death==
Aiken did not run for reelection in 1974. He resided in Putney until mid-1984, when his health began to fail and he moved to a nursing home in Montpelier. He died in Montpelier on November 19, 1984, and was buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Putney.

Bernie Sanders, who had interviewed Aiken for the Vermont Life magazine in 1973, said of him in 2006: &quot;I can’t say I have based my political work on his, but Aiken has always been a name and a person I’ve respected and admired. What I liked about him and what made him successful was his straightforwardness, his common sense, his down to earth-ness. He was clearly a man of the people.”

<text>John Henry Hemming (born January 5, 1935) is a historian, explorer, and expert on the Incas and indigenous peoples of the Amazon basin.

==Early life and education==
Hemming, was born in Vancouver on 5 January 1935. His father, Henry Harold Hemming, served in the First World War and was wary of a Second World War on the horizon. As a result, he sent John&#x27;s mother, journalist Alice Hemming, to Canada by way of the Panama Canal. John and his sister Louisa were brought back to London when he was two months old. He was educated in the United Kingdom at Eton College, in Canada at McGill University, and earned a doctorate at Oxford. He also became an honorary fellow of Magdalen College.

==Career==

In 1961, with fellow Oxford graduates Richard Mason and Kit Lambert, he was part of the Iriri River Expedition into unexplored country in central Brazil. The Brazilian mapping agency, IBGE, sent a three-man survey team to help map these unknown forests and rivers and gave the Expedition permission to name features it found. However, after four months, an unknown indigenous people found the group&#x27;s trail, laid an ambush, and killed Richard Mason with arrows and clubs. Mason was the last Englishman ever to be killed by a totally unknown and uncontacted tribe. His body was carried out and buried in the British cemetery in Rio de Janeiro. The tribe was contacted in 1973, and was called Panará: Hemming visited them in 1998.

His first book, &quot;The Conquest of the Incas&quot;, was published in 1970 and is still in print with two revisions. It won the Robert Pitman Literary Prize and the Christopher Award in New York. Hemming had spent the year 1960 travelling to every part of Peru, was for years chairman of the Anglo-Peruvian Society, and has been awarded Peru&#x27;s two highest civilian honours: El Sol del Peru (&#x27;The Sun of Peru&#x27;, South America&#x27;s oldest order of chivalry) and the Grand Cross of the Orden al Merito Publico (Order of Merit). He has also written, with the American photographer Edward Ranney, an account of Inca architecture of Peru, &quot;Monuments of the Incas&quot;, reissued in a revised edition in 2010. Among those whom he inspired and befriended is Vince Lee, a fellow Andean explorer and writer.

His experience on the Iriri River expedition led to a heightened interest in Brazilian indigenous peoples. On various expeditions he visited 45 tribes throughout Brazil – four of them (Surui, Parakana, Asurini and Galera Nambikwara) at the time that Brazilian teams made the first-ever face-to-face contact. Over the following 26 years he completed a three-volume history of the indigenous peoples and exploration of the Brazilian Amazonia: &quot;Red Gold&quot; (1978), which covers the period of 1500–1760; &quot;Amazon Frontier&quot; (1985), covering the period of 1760–1910; and &quot;Die If You Must&quot; (2004), which describes their changes during the 20th century. The three volumes add up to over 2,100 pages.

In 1975, John Hemming became director and secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, a post he held until 1996. He personally led the Maracá Rainforest Project in Brazil (1987–88) which, with 200 scientists and scientific technicians, became the largest research project in Amazonia organised by any European country – in partnership with Brazilian researchers from INPA (Amazon Research Institute) and [SEMA environment agency. Hemming was awarded the RGS&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Medal in recognition of his work on the Maracá project, as well as the Brazilian Ordem do Cruzeiro do Sul (Order of the Southern Cross) and medals from the Royal Scottish Geographical Society and the Boston Museum of Science (Bradford Washburn Medal).

In April 2008 his book, &quot;Tree of Rivers: The Story of the Amazon&quot;, was published by Thames and Hudson. It was described by Hugh Thomson in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; as a book that &quot;will stand as the definitive single-volume work on the subject.&quot; Another notable book was &quot;Naturalists in Paradise. Wallace, Bates and Spruce in the Amazon&quot; (2015).

==Personal life==

In 1979, John Hemming married Susan (Sukie) Babington Smith, daughter of Michael Babington Smith and granddaughter of Sir Henry Babington Smith. She worked for many years in The National Trust, became Director of Development and then Director of Corporate Affairs at the British Museum, and on retirement a trustee of English Heritage. She is the great-granddaughter of 9th Earl of Elgin on her father&#x27;s side and the great-great-granddaughter of the 4th Earl of Clanwilliam on her mother&#x27;s side. They have two children: publisher Beatrice (born 1981) and writer Henry Hemming.

==Honours==
In the 1994 New Year Honours, Hemming was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) by the British government. In August 2018, he was awarded the President&#x27;s Medal of the British Academy &quot;for his work in the field of the colonial history and ethnography of Brazil and Peru, and the promotion of the protection of endangered societies&quot;.

<text>Branislav Nušić (, ;  – 19 January 1938) was a Serbian playwright, satirist, essayist, novelist and founder of modern rhetoric in Serbia. He also worked as a journalist and a civil servant.

==Life==
Branislav Nušić was born Alkibijad Nuša (, ) in Belgrade on . His father, George Nousias (Thessaloniki, 1822 – Priština, 1916), was a Serbianized Aromanian merchant whose family had its roots in the village of Magarevo in then Ottoman Macedonia, while his mother, Ljubica (Brčko, 1839 – Belgrade, 1904), was a Serb homemaker from Bosnia, then under Austro-Hungarian rule.

Young Alkibijad completed his primary education in Smederevo, a port town along the Danube, before returning to Belgrade to complete his secondary education. In 1882, at the age of 18, he legally changed his name to Branislav Nušić. He subsequently enrolled in the Belgrade Higher School (later the University of Belgrade), graduating with a law degree in 1885. That year, at the age of 21, he was conscripted into the Royal Serbian Army. Nušić&#x27;s service coincided with the two-week-long Serbo-Bulgarian War of November 1885, which he witnessed first-hand as a Serbian corporal in western Bulgaria.

Nušić was quick to criticize the conduct of the Serbian Supreme Command during the war, which ended in a Bulgarian victory. He outlined his objections in the book &quot;Pripovetke jednog kaplara iz srpsko–bugarskog rata 1885&quot; (The Stories of a Corporal from the Serbo–Bulgarian War of 1885), which was published in 1886. He went on to spend one year&#x27;s study at the University of Graz in Austria-Hungary. In 1887, Nušić published a poem titled &quot;Dva raba&quot; (&quot;Two Servants&quot;), which ridiculed the Serbian King Milan for attending the funeral of an unpopular general&#x27;s mother rather than that of , an officer who died of wounds sustained while saving his regiment&#x27;s flag. Nušić was subsequently arrested, convicted of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; and sentenced to two year&#x27;s imprisonment. He served his sentence at a prison in Požarevac but was released after only one year due to good behaviour.

In 1889, shortly after his release from prison, Nušić entered the civil service as an official in Serbia&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Several years later, in 1893, he married Darinka Đorđević, the 17-year-old niece of the Serbian consul in Bitola, Dimitrije Bodi. The couple had three children, one of whom died in infancy. Between 1889 and 1900, Nušić worked as a clerk at the Serbian consulates to the Ottoman Empire in Bitola, Serres, Thessaloniki, Skopje, and Pristina. Despite his earlier anti-war rhetoric, Nušić became an enthusiastic supporter of using military means to force the Ottoman Empire out from the Balkans. In 1900, he received a post at the Ministry of Education. Shortly thereafter, he became the head dramaturgist of the National Theatre in Belgrade. In 1904, he was appointed head of the Serbian National Theatre in Novi Sad. In 1905, he left his new post and moved to Belgrade to work as a journalist. He also worked as an editor for various magazines and feuilletonist for &quot;Politika&quot;, writing under the pseudonym Ben Akiba.

Following Austria-Hungary&#x27;s annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 1908, Nušić led a series of anti-Habsburg demonstrations in Belgrade. He climbed a balcony at the National Theatre, railed against the &quot;plunder&quot; of Serbian lands by Austria-Hungary, and demanded immediate military action. He subsequently rode his horse into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to the consternation of Prime Minister Nikola Pašić. The popularity of Nušić&#x27;s works, as well as those of fellow dramatist Petar Kočić, increased dramatically following the annexation. In 1912, Nušić returned to Bitola as a civil servant. Macedonia was captured and annexed by Serbia following the First Balkan War, and in February 1913, Nušić was appointed prefect of Bitola. He was quickly forced to resign after consistently failing to adhere to the demands of the Black Hand and the ultra-nationalist guerilla bands that formed the backbone of the Royal Serbian Army&#x27;s occupation force. Despite this, he remained in Skopje, and helped establish the city&#x27;s first theatre in 1913. The outbreak of World War I brought further personal tragedies Nušić&#x27;s way; his son Strahinja was killed on the frontline while serving in the Serbian Army. Nušić lived in Skopje until November 1915, when Austria-Hungary, Germany and Bulgaria successfully invaded and occupied Serbia. He took part in the Serbian army&#x27;s retreat through Albania between November 1915 and February 1916. He lived in Italy, Switzerland and France until the end of the war.

Nušić returned to Serbia a broken man, devastated by the loss of his only son. He was appointed to be the first head of the Ministry of Education&#x27;s art department, serving alongside the writers Borisav Stanković and Stanislav Vinaver. He also became the first post-war director of the theatre in Skopje. He remained at this post until 1923. Afterwards, he was appointed head of the Sarajevo National Theatre. In Sarajevo, Nušić wrote &quot;Ramazanske noći&quot; (&quot;Nights of Ramadan&quot;) under the pseudonym Halil Delibašić. He returned to Belgrade in 1927. In Vienna, he acted in the film &quot;Paramount Review&quot; in 1930. Nušić became a member of the Serbian Royal Academy in 1933. Following &quot;The Bereaved Family&quot;&#x27;s 1935 premiere in Sofia, he received a medal from the Bulgarian state. He was also awarded Order of Saint Sava, Order of the White Eagle and Order of Prince Danilo I. Nušić died in Belgrade on 19 January 1938.

==Social criticism==

Nušić is more celebrated as a playwright than as a novelist. His incidental novels and journalistic &quot;feuilletons&quot; are not always moralistic or polished, but they are lively and amusing sketches of life. He is more prolific in historical drama and comedy.Nušić&#x27;s ability to blend humor with a biting critque of society ensures that his plays remain relevant and appreciated. Of his plays, the most popular are comedies &quot;The Cabinet Minister&#x27;s Wife&quot; (Госпођа министарка), &quot;A Suspicious Person&quot; (Сумњиво лице), &quot;A Member of the Parliament&quot; (Народни посланик), &quot;Bereaved Family&quot; (Ожалошћена породица), &quot;The Deceased&quot; (Покојник), and &quot;Doctor&quot; (Др).

Through his plays, Nušić presented Serbian society and the mentality of the middle class in small towns and counties. He brought to the stage not only the retailers, canton captains, semi-educated officers, and current and former ministers&#x27; wives, but also formerly distinguished and overly ambitious householders, their decadent sons, failed students, distinguished daughters of marriageable age, and greedy upstarts.

All-in-all he depicted the Serbian middle class and its morality, which managed to survive despite all the political and social reforms, newly formed educational system and cultural institutions. He also paid special attention to the social conditions of their origins, as they started out with unrealizable desires and insatiable appetites, the distorted family and marital relationships, misunderstandings and intolerance between fathers and sons, unfaithful husbands and wives, officers’ ignorance and corruption and unreal political ambitions. Nušić thus became not only a playwright, observer and interpreter of his time, but also an analyst of Serbian society and its mentality at a specific historical period.

<text>Dubs is the official live mascot of the University of Washington. Since Dubs I&#x27;s introduction in February 2009, every Dubs has led the football team onto the field during home games. The Huskies use an Alaskan Malamute as their live mascot because it is the &quot;largest and strongest of all Husky breeds.&quot;

== Background ==
The Washington Huskies have had 14 live mascots since 1922. The first of the live mascots was Frosty I (1922-30), adopted by the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He was followed by Frosty II (1930-36), Wasky I (1946-47), Wasky II (1947-54), Ski (1954-58), Denali (1958), King Chinook (1959-68), Regent Denali (1969-81), Sundodger Denali (1981-92), King Redoubt (1992-98), Prince Redoubt (1998), and Spirit (1999-2008).

Dubs II is the 14th official live mascot of the University of Washington. He is an Alaskan Malamute from Snohomish, Washington. Unlike other animal mascots, such as the University of Georgia&#x27;s bulldog Uga, each Dubs is from a separate family tree and is not related in order to prevent inbreeding. An exception was made after the sudden passing of the tenth live mascot King Redoubt during a heatwave a month before the 1998 football season, with his son Prince Redoubt succeeding him for the season.

Historically, the university has also hosted a long line of Alaskan Malamutes as mascots. The dogs were originally cared for by the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity; this arrangement was followed by a 49-year tradition (1959–2008) of care by the Cross family (a UW professor, followed by his son). The 14 official live mascots thus far are as follows:

* Frosty I (1922–30)
* Frosty II (1930–36)
* Wasky (1946–47)
* Wasky II (1947–53)
* Ski (1954–57)
* Denali (1958)
* King Chinook (1959–68)
* Regent Denali (1969–80)
* Sundodger Denali (1981–92)
* King Redoubt (1992–97)
* Prince Redoubt (1998)
* Spirit (1999–2008)
* Dubs (2009–2018)
* Dubs II (2018– )

== Dubs namesakes ==
* Dubs I (2009–18) – Started the Dubs mascot line. An Alaskan Malamute from Burlington, Washington. In late September 2008, the University of Washington announced an initiative to search for an appropriate name for its live mascot. A contest was launched online and fans were asked to submit their favorite name for the live Husky dog. More than 1,400 different nominations were received and a committee that consisted of campus and community representatives narrowed the field to a reasonable list of finalists. More than 20,000 votes were received in two rounds of online, with Dubs emerging victorious. In Fall 2018, UW Athletics hosted a “Passing of the Collar” ceremony where UW President Ana Mari Cauce removed the collar from Dubs I and placed it on Dubs II, signifying the official retirement of Dubs I. Dubs I passed away on April 3, 2021, aged 12. 
* Dubs II (2018 – present) – Began training alongside Dubs I during the Fall of 2018, he currently resides in Sammamish, Washington.

<doc id="857148" wikidata="Q35219" url="?curid=857148" title="Old Saxon">
<text>Old Saxon (), also known as Old Low German (), was a Germanic language and the earliest recorded form of Low German (spoken nowadays in Northern Germany, the northeastern Netherlands, southern Denmark, the Americas and parts of Eastern Europe). It is a West Germanic language, closely related to the Anglo-Frisian languages. It is documented from the 8th century until the 12th century, when it gradually evolved into Middle Low German. It was spoken throughout modern northwestern Germany, primarily in the coastal regions and in the eastern Netherlands by Saxons, a Germanic tribe that inhabited the region of Saxony. It partially shares Anglo-Frisian&#x27;s (Old Frisian, Old English) Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law which sets it apart from Low Franconian and Irminonic languages, such as Dutch, Luxembourgish and German.

The grammar of Old Saxon was fully inflected with five grammatical cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and instrumental), three grammatical numbers (, plural, and dual), and three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). The dual forms occurred in the first and second persons only.

==Characteristics==

===Relation with other West Germanic languages===
In the early Middle Ages, a dialect continuum existed between Old Dutch and Old Saxon, a continuum which has since been interrupted by the simultaneous dissemination of standard languages within each nation and the dissolution of folk dialects. Although they share some features, a number of differences separate Old Saxon, Old English, and Old Dutch. One such difference is the Old Dutch utilization of &quot;-a&quot; as its plural a-stem noun ending, while Old Saxon and Old English employ &quot;-as&quot; or &quot;-os&quot;. However, it seems that Middle Dutch took the Old Saxon a-stem ending from some Middle Low German dialects, as modern Dutch includes the plural ending &quot;-s&quot; added to certain words. Another difference is the so-called &quot;unified plural&quot;: Old Saxon, like Old Frisian and Old English, has one verb form for all three persons in the plural, whereas Old Dutch retained three distinct forms (reduced to two in Middle Dutch).

Old Saxon (or Old Low German) probably evolved primarily from Ingvaeonic dialects in the West Germanic branch of Proto-Germanic in the 5th century. However, Old Saxon, even considered as an Ingvaeonic language, is not a pure Ingvaeonic dialect like Old Frisian and Old English, the latter two sharing some other Ingvaeonic characteristics, which Old Saxon lacked.

===Relation to Middle Low German===
Old Saxon naturally evolved into Middle Low German over the course of the 11th and 12th centuries, with a great shift from Latin to Low German writing happening around 1150, so that the development of the language can be traced from that period.

The most striking difference between Middle Low German and Old Saxon is in a feature of speech known as vowel reduction, which took place in most other West Germanic languages and some Scandinavian dialects such as Danish, reducing all unstressed vowels to schwa. Thus, such Old Saxon words like () or ( – gen. pl.) became and .

==Phonology==
===Early developments===
Old Saxon did not participate in the High German consonant shift, and thus preserves stop consonants &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;k&quot; that have been shifted in Old High German to various fricatives and affricates. The Germanic diphthongs &quot;ai&quot;, &quot;au&quot; consistently develop into long vowels &quot;ē&quot;, &quot;ō&quot;, whereas in Old High German they appear either as &quot;ei&quot;, &quot;ou&quot; or &quot;ē&quot;, &quot;ō&quot; depending on the following consonant.

Old Saxon, alone of the West Germanic languages except for Frisian, consistently preserves Germanic after a consonant, e.g. (, , but ). Germanic umlaut, when it occurs with short &quot;a&quot;, is inconsistent, e.g. or &quot;to have&quot; (). This feature was carried over into the descendant-language of Old Saxon, Middle Low German, where e.g. the adjective () had the comparative forms and . Apart from the &quot;e&quot;, however, the umlaut is not marked in writing.

===Consonants===
The table below lists the consonants of Old Saxon. Phonemes written in parentheses represent allophones and are not independent phonemes.

* The voiceless spirants , , and gain voiced allophones (, , and ) when between vowels. This change is only faithfully reflected in writing for (represented with letters such as and ). The other two allophones continued to be written as before.
*Fricatives were devoiced again word-finally. Beginning in the later Old Saxon period, stops became devoiced word-finally as well.
* Most consonants could be geminated. Notably, geminated gave , and geminated probably gave ; Geminated resulted in .
* Germanic &quot;*h&quot; is retained as in these positions and thus merges with devoiced .

===Vowels===
Notes:

* Long vowels were rare in unstressed syllables and mostly occurred due to suffixation or compounding.

===Diphthongs===
Notes:

* The closing diphthongs and sometimes occur in texts (especially in Genesis), probably under the influence of Franconian or High German dialects, where they replace Old Saxon developments and (which evolved from Proto-Germanic and ).
* The situation for the front opening diphthongs is somewhat unclear in some texts. Words written with in the Heliand, the most extensive record of Old Saxon writing, are often found written variably with or even in most other texts, notably the later ones. The diphthong eventually merges into in almost every Middle Low German dialect.
* There also existed &#x27;long&#x27; diphthongs , and . These were, however, treated as two-syllable sequences of a long vowel followed by a short one, not proper diphthongs.

==Grammar==
===Morphology===
Unlike modern English, Old Saxon was an inflected language rich in morphological diversity. It kept five out of the six distinct cases of Proto-Germanic: the nominative, accusative, genitive, dative and (Vestigially in the oldest texts) instrumental.

Old Saxon also had three grammatical numbers (, and dual, and plural) and three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). The dual forms occurred in the first and second persons only and referred to groups of exactly two.

===Nouns===
Old Saxon nouns were inflected in very different ways following their classes. Here are the endings for , an a-stem masculine noun:

At the end of the Old Saxon period, distinctions between noun classes began to disappear, and endings from one were often transferred to the other declension, and vice versa. This happened to be a large process, and the most common noun classes started to cause the least represented to disappear. As a result, in Middle Low German, only the former weak n-stem and strong a-stem classes remained. These two noun inflection classes started being added to words not only following the historical belonging of this word, but also following the root of the word.

===Verbs===
The Old Saxon verb inflection system reflects an intermediate stage between Old English and Old Dutch, and further Old High German. Unlike Old High German and Old Dutch, but similarly to Old English, it did not preserve the three different verb endings in the plural, all featured as &quot;-ad&quot; (also &quot;-iad&quot; or &quot;-iod&quot; following the different verb inflection classes). Like Old Dutch, it had only two classes of weak verb, with only a few relic verbs of the third weak class (namely four verbs: &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;).

This table sums up all seven Old Saxon strong verb classes and the three weak verb classes:

It should be noticed that the third weak verb class includes only four verbs (namely &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;); it is a remnant of an older and larger class that was kept in Old High German.

===Syntax===
Old Saxon syntax is mostly different from that of modern English. Some were simply consequences of the greater level of nominal and verbal inflection – e.g., word order was generally freer. In addition:
*The default word order was verb-second, very close to that of modern Dutch or modern German.
*There was no &quot;do&quot;-support in questions and negatives.
*Multiple negatives could stack up in a sentence and intensify each other (negative concord), which is not always the case in modern English, modern Dutch, or modern German.
*Sentences with subordinate clauses of the type &quot;when X, Y&quot; (e.g. &quot;When I got home, I ate dinner.&quot;) did not use a &quot;wh-&quot;type conjunction, but rather used a &quot;th-&quot;type correlative conjunction (e.g. &quot;thô X, thô Y&quot; in place of &quot;when X, Y&quot;). The &quot;wh-&quot;type conjunctions were used only as interrogative pronouns and indefinite pronouns.
*Similarly, &quot;wh-&quot; forms were not used as relative pronouns (as in &quot;the man who saw me&quot; or &quot;the car which I bought&quot;). Instead, an indeclinable word &quot;the&quot; was used, often in conjunction with the definite article (which was declined for case, number and gender).

==Orthography==
Old Saxon comes down in a number of different manuscripts whose spelling systems sometimes differ markedly. In this section, only the letters used in normalized versions of the &quot;Heliand&quot; will be kept, and the sounds modern scholars have traditionally assigned to these letters. Where spelling deviations in other texts may point to significant pronunciation variants, this will be indicated.

In general, the spelling of Old Saxon corresponds quite well to that of the other ancient Germanic languages, such as Old High German or Gothic.

* and were both used for . However, it seems that, as in other West-Germanic dialects, when was followed by or , it had the pronunciation or . The letters and were preferred for the palatalisations, and even sometimes being rather used before , or for ( for &#x27;king&#x27;, modern ; for ; for ).
* represented or its allophone : &#x27;to bring&#x27;, &#x27;to say&#x27;, &#x27;way&#x27; (dative).
* seems, at least in a few dialects, to have had the pronunciation or at the beginning of a word, only when followed by or . Thus we find &#x27;year&#x27; and even &#x27;year&#x27;, the latter betraying a strong Old Frisian influence.
* represents and its allophone : &#x27;wood&#x27;, &#x27;night&#x27; (mod. ).

* represented , and between two vowels also .

* represented the vowels and , or the consonant ~ , which was denoted sporadically across manuscripts by either , , , , or &#x27;.
* was normally used to represent , predating the letter .
* only appeared in a few texts due to Old High German influence.

==Literature==

Only a few texts survive, predominantly baptismal vows the Saxons were required to perform at the behest of Charlemagne. The only literary texts preserved are &quot;Heliand&quot; and fragments of the Old Saxon Genesis. There is also:

* Beda homily ()
* &quot;Credo&quot; () → Old Saxon baptismal vow.
* Old Saxon Baptismal Vow ()
* Penitentiary ()
* &quot;Spurihalz&quot; () () 
* &quot;Wurmsegen&quot; () ( 
* Psalms commentary ()

==Text sample==
A poetic version of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in the form of the traditional Germanic alliterative verse is given in Old Saxon below as it appears in the &quot;Heliand&quot;.

<doc id="857149" wikidata="Q16156830" url="?curid=857149" title="List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Kingdom">
<text>The United States ambassador to the United Kingdom, formally the ambassador of the United States of America to the Court of St James&#x27;s is the official representative of the president of the United States and the American government to the monarch (Court of St. James&#x27;s) and government of the United Kingdom. The position was last held by Jane D. Hartley, who presented her credentials to Queen Elizabeth II on July 19, 2022.

The position is regarded as one of the most prestigious posts in the United States Foreign Service due to the &quot;special relationship&quot; between the United States and the United Kingdom. The ambassadorship has been held by various notable politicians, including five who would later become president: John Adams, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren and James Buchanan. However, the modern tendency of American presidents (of both parties) is to appoint keen political fundraisers from previous presidential campaigns, despite the importance and prestige of the office.

The ambassador and executive staff work at the American Embassy in Nine Elms, London. The official residence of the ambassador is Winfield House in Regent&#x27;s Park.

== Duties ==
The ambassador&#x27;s main duty is to present U.S. policies to the government of the United Kingdom and its people, as well as report British policies and views to the federal government of the United States. The ambassador serves as a primary channel of communication between the two nations and plays an important role in treaty negotiations.

The ambassador is the head of the United States&#x27; consular service in the United Kingdom. As well as directing diplomatic activity in support of trade, the ambassador is ultimately responsible for visa services and for the provision of consular support to American citizens in the UK and oversees cultural relations between the two countries.

=== Ministers (1785–1812) ===

 Independent 

 Democratic-Republican 

 Democrat 

 Whig

 Republican

John Adams is referred to as the first &quot;ambassador&quot;. He is also referred to as the first &quot;minister plenipotentiary&quot;. &quot;Plenipotentiary&quot; means &quot;having full power&quot;; a minister that has power to act for their country in all matters. 
=== Ministers (1815–1893) ===

Diplomatic relations with what had now become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland were restored after the War of 1812. The Congress of Vienna (1815) established a uniform system of diplomatic rank. Under that system, the highest rank of &quot;ambassador&quot; was a personal representative of a sovereign, and the next rank of &quot;minister&quot;, represented a government. As a republic, the United States maintained diplomatic relations with Britain at the rank of &quot;Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary&quot;. The rank was colloquially known as &quot;Minister&quot;, and the position continued to be referred to as &quot;United States Minister to Great Britain&quot;.

=== Ambassadors (1893–present) ===

Although France became a republic in 1870, the country continued to exchange ambassadors with other Great Powers. In 1893, the United States followed the French precedent and upgraded its relations with other Great Powers to the ambassadorial level. The United States Legation in London became the United States Embassy, and the United States Minister to Great Britain became the United States Ambassador to Great Britain.

<text>Wijhe () is a village in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is located in the municipality of Olst-Wijhe and is situated about 12 km south of Zwolle on the banks of the river IJssel.

Wijhe was a separate municipality until 2001, when it merged with Olst.

==History &amp; Sights==

The first written record of Wijhe dates from the year 960 as &quot;Wie.&quot; The village has a church built in the late-Gothic style, parts of which date from the 13th and 14th century. The windmill in the centre is still in working order. It was built in 1703 and is the oldest eight square mill in the province. To the north of Wijhe lies the hamlet of Herxen with a riverside nature reserve.

Wijhe has three estates: Hengevoorde containing a manor house, Het Nijenhuis with a castle and De Gelder. The last one is the private property of Baron De Vos van Steenwijk, but it is free for public access. Most of the De Gelder castle was destroyed during World War II.

<doc id="857160" wikidata="Q755524" url="?curid=857160" title="Athetosis">
<text>Athetosis is a symptom characterized by slow, involuntary, convoluted, writhing movements of the fingers, hands, toes, and feet and in some cases, arms, legs, neck and tongue. Movements typical of athetosis are sometimes called &quot;athetoid&quot; movements. Lesions to the brain are most often the direct cause of the symptoms, particularly to the
corpus striatum. This symptom does not occur alone and is often accompanied by the symptoms of cerebral palsy, as it is often a result of this physical disability. Treatments for athetosis are not very effective, and in most cases are simply aimed at managing the uncontrollable movement, rather than the cause itself.

==Signs and symptoms==
Athetosis can vary from mild to severe motor dysfunction; it is generally characterized by unbalanced, involuntary movements of muscle and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture. The associated motor dysfunction can be restricted to a part of the body or present throughout the body, depending on the individual and the severity of the symptom. One of the pronounced signs can be observed in the extremities in particular, as the writhing, convoluted movement of the digits. Athetosis can appear as early as 18 months from birth with first signs including difficulty feeding, hypotonia, spasm, and involuntary writhing movements of the hands, feet, and face, which progressively worsen through adolescence and at times of emotional distress. Athetosis is caused by lesions in several brain areas such as the hippocampus and the motor thalamus, as well as the corpus striatum; therefore children during the developmental age could possibly suffer from severe communication deficits such as speech impairment, hearing loss, and failed or delayed acquirement of sitting balance, although most people with athetosis have normal or near-normal intelligence.

==Causes==
Athetosis is a symptom primarily caused by the marbling, or degeneration of the basal ganglia. This degeneration is most commonly caused by complications at birth or by Huntington&#x27;s disease, in addition to rare cases in which the damage may also arise later in life due to stroke or trauma. The two complications of particular interest are intranatal asphyxia and neonatal jaundice.

===Asphyxia===
Asphyxia directly causes basal ganglia damage due to lack of oxygen and therefore, insufficient nutrient supply. The lesions caused by asphyxia are most prominent on the caudate nucleus and the putamen. However, a less-studied consequence of the resulting hypoxia is its effect on the concentrations of the neurotransmitter dopamine within the synapses of neurons in the basal ganglia. Hypoxia leads to an increase in the extracellular dopamine levels and therefore, an increase in the activity of the dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, this increase in extracellular concentration is not caused by an increase in the neurotransmitter synthesis, but instead on inhibiting its reuptake back into the neurons and glial cells. Therefore, there is an increased dopaminergic effect as dopamine remains in the synapse at higher concentrations leading to additional post-synaptic response. As a result, the uncontrollable writhing motions witnessed with athetosis deal with the over-activity of synapses within the basal ganglia.

===Neonatal jaundice===
Neonatal jaundice is the other chief complication that leads to the basal ganglia damage associated with this condition. Jaundice is caused by hyperbilirubinemia, or abnormally high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is usually bound to albumin immediately and sent to the liver. However, in neonatal jaundice, the concentration of bilirubin overwhelms that of albumin and some of the bilirubin remains unconjugated and can enter the brain through the blood–brain barrier. Normally bilirubin would not be able to diffuse across the blood–brain barrier, but in infants, the barrier is immature and has higher permeability. Bilirubin is toxic as it prevents the phosphorylation of many proteins, including synapsin I which binds vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. Therefore, it directly inhibits the exocytosis of neurotransmitters and severely hinders the synapses it affects. In autopsies of children who suffered from neonatal jaundice, chronic changes of neuronal loss, gliosis and demyelination were observed in the basal ganglia and more specifically within the globus pallidus.

===Thalamic stroke===
Another study was done where the onset of athetoid movement followed a thalamic stroke. The thalamus is part of a pathway that is involved with the cortical feedback loop in which signals from the cortex are relayed through the striatum, pallidus and thalamus before making it back to the cortex. The striatum receives excitatory inputs from the cortex and inhibits the pallidum. By doing so it frees the thalamus from pallidal inhibition allowing the thalamus to send excitatory outputs to the cortex. Therefore, the lesions to the thalamus or any other part of this feedback loop can result in movement disorders as they can alter the reactivity of one towards the other. Also, in a case of people with thalamic stroke, a majority suffered severe sensory deficits and ataxia. It is proposed that this loss of proprioception and the ensuing loss of synergic stabilization may also lead to abnormal movements, such as those dealt with in athetosis.

===Fahr&#x27;s syndrome===
==Treatments==
There are several different treatment approaches to dealing with athetosis. The most common methods are the use of drugs, surgical intervention, and retraining movements of the afflicted person. It is suggested that training a person to relearn movements can be helpful in select situations. Though, generally, this type of treatment will not work, in certain cases it can be found to be very helpful in treating the symptom of athetosis.

Drugs can also be used in the treatment of athetosis, however their collective effectiveness is not very convincing. There is not a single drug that is a standard among treatment. Many different medicines can be used, including:
* trihexyphenidyl
* benzatropine
* Curare, though not practical due to respiratory paralysis
* Tetrabenazine
* Haloperidol
* Thiopropazate
* Diazepam
Most instances of drug use where the symptoms seem to be lessened tend to be in more mild cases of athetosis.

Treatment by surgical intervention can obviously have the most immediate impact, again however, it is not a cure-all. In patients that have cerebral palsy as the cause of their athetosis, it has been demonstrated that a subthalamotomy tends to help relieve the extent of athetosis in approximately half of patients. Additionally, late 19th and early 20th century surgical accounts state that athetosis can be relieved by the removal of a part of the cerebral motor cortex or by cutting a part of the posterior spinal roots. Patients who undergo surgical treatment to relieve the athetosis often see significant improvement in the control of their limbs and digits. While surgery is often very beneficial in the short term and can produce near immediate results, in the long term it has been seen that its effects are not incredibly long lasting.

==Related disorders==

===Choreoathetosis===
Chorea is another condition which results from damage to the basal ganglia. Similar to athetosis, it results from mutations affecting the pallidum inhibition of the thalamus as well as increased dopaminergic activity at the level of the striatum. Considering the etiology of both disorders are fairly similar, it comes as no surprise that chorea and athetosis can and usually do occur together in a condition called choreoathetosis.

===Cerebral palsy===
Athetosis is a commonly occurring symptom in the disease cerebral palsy. Of all people with the disease, between 16% and 25% of them actually exhibit the symptom of athetosis. A component of this is the finding that most often the symptoms that involve athetosis occur as a part of choreoathetosis as opposed to athetosis alone.

It is also noteworthy that the presence of athetosis in cerebral palsy (as well as other conditions) causes a significant increase in a person&#x27;s basal resting metabolic rate. It has been observed that those who have cerebral palsy with athetosis require approximately 500 more Calories per day than their non-cerebral palsy non-athetoid counterpart.

===Pseudoathetosis===
Pseudoathetosis is a movement disorder, very similar to athetosis, in which the symptoms are not differentiable from those of actual athetosis, however the underlying cause is different. While actual athetosis is caused by damage to the brain, specifically in the basal ganglia, pseudoathetosis is caused by the loss of proprioception. The loss in proprioception is caused by damage to the area between the primary somatosensory cortex and the muscle spindles and joint receptors. Additionally, when observing an MRI, it can be seen that in the brain of a pseudoathetoid patient, lesions on the brain are not seen in the basal ganglia, the area that is oftentimes the cause of athetosis.

==Social implications==
Athetosis is characterized as a symptom that is present in many forms of central nervous system disorders that affect the body movement coordination, such as cerebral palsy. Children may struggle to engage in social communication, since the poor coordination of the tongue and mouth muscles can reduce their speech ability and hinder their social interaction to a greater degree. The caregivers of the affected children are encouraged to closely monitor their nutrition and growth and to provide them with hearing aids in order to relieve their symptoms as well as support their academic plans. A growing number of patients is shown to benefit from communication devices such as shorthand typing programs and computer speech devices, as well as simple picture boards.

Patients living with the disorder into their adulthood often have trouble being involved in daily activities such as eating, walking, dressing, as well as performing everyday tasks. They are consistently faced with challenges that limit their ability to live on their own. They are more reluctant to be involved in social activities and romantic relationships and more likely to develop poor self-esteem and self-image related to their physical limitations as well as cognitive disabilities, though such habitual thinking is shown to decline when they feel they are accepted and supported by their peers. Patients are also inclined to associate themselves with people who tend not to be engaged in physical activities, according to the September 2008 issue of &quot;Journal of Physical Activity and Health&quot;.

==History==
The first noted case of athetosis was discovered by W. A. Hammond and described in his book &quot;Diseases of the Nervous System&quot; in 1871. Hammond was also the person who created the term &quot;athetosis&quot;, Greek for &quot;without position&quot;. In his initial description of athetosis, the extent of the uncontrolled movement was limited to the fingers and toes. In association with this, he noted that the patients&#x27; calves and forearms were oftentimes flexed and that movements were generally slow. Over the period of time leading into the late 20th century, the definition of athetosis was expanded to include movements of the neck, tongue, face, and even the trunk. Along with the expansion of the symptoms came the recognition that it was a part of many medical conditions, including cerebral palsy and stroke.

==Research directions==
As athetosis is relatively difficult to treat, efforts are being made to help those with the condition live and perform tasks more effectively and more efficiently. One such example of work that has been recently undertaken is a project to help those affected with athetosis to use a computer with more ease. Software for the control of the computer uses joysticks that perform linear filtering to aid in control.

An additional possible treatment option for those afflicted with the symptom is neurostimulation. Studies have begun, and in cerebral palsy patients affected with dystonia-choreoathetosis, it has been demonstrated that neurostimulation has been an effective treatment in lessening symptoms in patients. There has not been a tremendous amount of experimentation, though, in this as a possible treatment option.

<doc id="857170" wikidata="Q2882301" url="?curid=857170" title="Cardiac action potential">
<text>Unlike the action potential in skeletal muscle cells, the cardiac action potential is not initiated by nervous activity. Instead, it arises from a group of specialized cells known as pacemaker cells, that have automatic action potential generation capability. In healthy hearts, these cells form the cardiac pacemaker and are found in the sinoatrial node in the right atrium. They produce roughly 60–100 action potentials every minute. The action potential passes along the cell membrane causing the cell to contract, therefore the activity of the sinoatrial node results in a resting heart rate of roughly 60–100 beats per minute. All cardiac muscle cells are electrically linked to one another, by intercalated discs which allow the action potential to pass from one cell to the next. This means that all atrial cells can contract together, and then all ventricular cells.

Rate dependence of the action potential is a fundamental property of cardiac cells and alterations can lead to severe cardiac diseases including cardiac arrhythmia and sometimes sudden death.
Action potential activity within the heart can be recorded to produce an electrocardiogram (ECG). This is a series of upward and downward spikes (labelled P, Q, R, S and T) that represent the depolarization (voltage becoming more positive) and repolarization (voltage becoming more negative) of the action potential in the atria and ventricles.

==Overview==

Similar to skeletal muscle, the resting membrane potential (voltage when the cell is not electrically excited) of ventricular cells is around −90 millivolts (mV; 1 mV = 0.001 V), i.e. the inside of the membrane is more negative than the outside. The main ions found outside the cell at rest are sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl−), whereas inside the cell it is mainly potassium (K+).

The action potential begins with the voltage becoming more positive; this is known as depolarization and is mainly due to the opening of sodium channels that allow Na+ to flow into the cell. After a delay (known as the absolute refractory period), the action potential terminates as potassium channels open, allowing K+ to leave the cell and causing the membrane potential to return to negative, this is known as repolarization. Another important ion is calcium (Ca2+), which can be found inside the cell in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) where calcium is stored, and is also found outside of the cell. Release of Ca2+ from the SR, via a process called calcium-induced calcium release, is vital for the plateau phase of the action potential (see phase 2, below) and is a fundamental step in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.

There are important physiological differences between the pacemaker cells of the sinoatrial node, that spontaneously generate the cardiac action potential and those non-pacemaker cells that simply conduct it, such as ventricular myocytes). The specific differences in the types of ion channels expressed and mechanisms by which they are activated results in differences in the configuration of the action potential waveform, as shown in figure 2.

=== Cardiac automaticity ===
Cardiac automaticity also known as autorhythmicity, is the property of the specialized conductive muscle cells of the heart to generate spontaneous cardiac action potentials. Automaticity can be normal or abnormal, caused by temporary ion channel characteristic changes such as certain medication usage, or in the case of abnormal automaticity the changes are in electrotonic environment, caused, for example, by myocardial infarction.

==Phases==

The standard model used to understand the cardiac action potential is that of the ventricular myocyte. Outlined below are the five phases of the ventricular myocyte action potential, with reference also to the SAN action potential.
===Phase 4===
In the ventricular myocyte, phase 4 occurs when the cell is at rest, in a period known as diastole. In the standard non-pacemaker cell the voltage during this phase is more or less constant, at roughly -90 mV. The resting membrane potential results from the flux of ions having flowed into the cell (e.g. sodium and calcium), the flux of ions having flowed out of the cell (e.g. potassium, chloride and bicarbonate), as well as the flux of ions generated by the different membrane pumps, being perfectly balanced.

The activity of these pumps serve two purposes. The first is to maintain the existence of the resting membrane potential by countering the depolarisation due to the leakage of ions not at the electrochemical equilibrium (e.g. sodium and calcium). These ions not being at the equilibrium is the reason for the existence of an electrical gradient, for they represent a net displacement of charges across the membrane, which are unable to immediately re-enter the cell to restore the electrical equilibrium. Therefore, their slow re-entrance in the cell needs to be counterbalanced or the cell would slowly lose its membrane potential.

The second purpose, intricately linked to the first, is to keep the intracellular concentration more or less constant, and in this case to re-establish the original chemical gradients, that is to force the sodium and calcium which previously flowed into the cell out of it, and the potassium which previously flowed out of the cell back into it (though as the potassium is mostly at the electrochemical equilibrium, its chemical gradient will naturally reequilibrate itself opposite to the electrical gradient, without the need for an active transport mechanism).

For example, the sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions are maintained by the sodium-potassium pump which uses energy (in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)) to move three Na+ out of the cell and two K+ into the cell. Another example is the sodium-calcium exchanger which removes one Ca2+ from the cell for three Na+ into the cell.

During this phase the membrane is most permeable to K+, which can travel into or out of cell through leak channels, including the inwardly rectifying potassium channel. Therefore, the resting membrane potential is mostly equal to K+ equilibrium potential and can be calculated using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation.

However, pacemaker cells are never at rest. In these cells, phase 4 is also known as the pacemaker potential. During this phase, the membrane potential slowly becomes more positive, until it reaches a set value (around -40 mV; known as the threshold potential) or until it is depolarized by another action potential, coming from a neighboring cell.

The pacemaker potential is thought to be due to a group of channels, referred to as HCN channels (Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated). These channels open at very negative voltages (i.e. immediately after phase 3 of the previous action potential; see below) and allow the passage of both K+ and Na+ into the cell. Due to their unusual property of being activated by very negative membrane potentials, the movement of ions through the HCN channels is referred to as the funny current (see below).

Another hypothesis regarding the pacemaker potential is the &#x27;calcium clock&#x27;. Calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum within the cell. This calcium then increases activation of the sodium-calcium exchanger resulting in the increase in membrane potential (as a +3 charge is being brought into the cell (by the 3Na+) but only a +2 charge is leaving the cell (by the Ca2+) therefore there is a net charge of +1 entering the cell). This calcium is then pumped back into the cell and back into the SR via calcium pumps (including the SERCA).

===Phase 0===
This phase consists of a rapid, positive change in voltage across the cell membrane (depolarization) lasting less than 2 ms in ventricular cells and 10–20 ms in SAN cells. This occurs due to a net flow of positive charge into the cell.

In non-pacemaker cells (i.e. ventricular cells), this is produced predominantly by the activation of Na+ channels, which increases the membrane conductance (flow) of Na+ (gNa). These channels are activated when an action potential arrives from a neighbouring cell, through gap junctions. When this happens, the voltage within the cell increases slightly. If this increased voltage reaches the threshold potential (approximately −70 mV) it causes the Na+ channels to open. This produces a larger influx of sodium into the cell, rapidly increasing the voltage further to around +50 mV, i.e. towards the Na+ equilibrium potential. However, if the initial stimulus is not strong enough, and the threshold potential is not reached, the rapid sodium channels will not be activated and an action potential will not be produced; this is known as the all-or-none law. The influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) through L-type calcium channels also constitutes a minor part of the depolarisation effect. The slope of phase 0 on the action potential waveform (see figure 2) represents the maximum rate of voltage change of the cardiac action potential and is known as dV/dtmax.

In pacemaker cells (e.g. sinoatrial node cells), however, the increase in membrane voltage is mainly due to activation of L-type calcium channels. These channels are also activated by an increase in voltage, however this time it is either due to the pacemaker potential (phase 4) or an oncoming action potential. The L-type calcium channels are activated more slowly than the sodium channels, therefore, the depolarization slope in the pacemaker action potential waveform is less steep than that in the non-pacemaker action potential waveform.

===Phase 1===
This phase begins with the rapid inactivation of the Na+ channels by the inner gate (inactivation gate), reducing the movement of sodium into the cell. At the same time potassium channels (called Ito1) open and close rapidly, allowing for a brief flow of potassium ions out of the cell, making the membrane potential slightly more negative. This is referred to as a &#x27;notch&#x27; on the action potential waveform.

There is no obvious phase 1 present in pacemaker cells.

===Phase 2===
This phase is also known as the &quot;plateau&quot; phase due to the membrane potential remaining almost constant, as the membrane slowly begins to repolarize. This is due to the near balance of charge moving into and out of the cell. During this phase delayed rectifier potassium channels (Iks) allow potassium to leave the cell while L-type calcium channels (activated by the influx of sodium during phase 0) allow the movement of calcium ions into the cell. These calcium ions bind to and open more calcium channels (called ryanodine receptors) located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum within the cell, allowing the flow of calcium out of the SR. These calcium ions are responsible for the contraction of the heart.

Calcium also activates chloride channels called Ito2, which allow Cl− to enter the cell. Increased calcium concentration in the cell also increases activity of the sodium-calcium exchangers, while increased sodium concentration (from the depolarisation of phase 0) increases activity of the sodium-potassium pumps. The movement of all these ions results in the membrane potential remaining relatively constant, with K+ outflux, Cl− influx as well as Na+/K+ pumps contributing to repolarisation and Ca2+ influx as well as Na+/Ca2+ exchangers contributing to depolarisation. This phase is responsible for the large duration of the action potential and is important in preventing irregular heartbeat (cardiac arrhythmia).

There is no plateau phase present in pacemaker action potentials.

===Phase 3===
During phase 3 (the &quot;rapid repolarization&quot; phase) of the action potential, the L-type Ca2+ channels close, while the slow delayed rectifier (IKs) K+ channels remain open as more potassium leak channels open. This ensures a net outward positive current, corresponding to negative change in membrane potential, thus allowing more types of K+ channels to open. These are primarily the rapid delayed rectifier K+ channels (IKr) and the inwardly rectifying K+ current, IK1.
This net outward, positive current (equal to loss of positive charge from the cell) causes the cell to repolarize. The delayed rectifier K+ channels close when the membrane potential is restored to about -85 to -90 mV, while IK1 remains conducting throughout phase 4, which helps to set the resting membrane potential

Ionic pumps as discussed above, like the sodium-calcium exchanger and the sodium-potassium pump restore ion concentrations back to balanced states pre-action potential. This means that the intracellular calcium is pumped out, which was responsible for cardiac myocyte contraction. Once this is lost, the contraction stops and the heart muscles relax.

In the sinoatrial node, this phase is also due to the closure of the L-type calcium channels, preventing inward flux of Ca2+ and the opening of the rapid delayed rectifier potassium channels (IKr).

==Refractory period==
Cardiac cells have two refractory periods, the first from the beginning of phase 0 until part way through phase 3; this is known as the absolute refractory period during which it is impossible for the cell to produce another action potential. This is immediately followed, until the end of phase 3, by a relative refractory period, during which a stronger-than-usual stimulus is required to produce another action potential.

These two refractory periods are caused by changes in the states of sodium and potassium channels. The rapid depolarization of the cell, during phase 0, causes the membrane potential to approach sodium&#x27;s equilibrium potential (i.e. the membrane potential at which sodium is no longer drawn into or out of the cell). As the membrane potential becomes more positive, the sodium channels then close and lock, this is known as the &quot;inactivated&quot; state. During this state the channels cannot be opened regardless of the strength of the excitatory stimulus—this gives rise to the absolute refractory period. The relative refractory period is due to the leaking of potassium ions, which makes the membrane potential more negative (i.e. it is hyperpolarised), this resets the sodium channels; opening the inactivation gate, but still leaving the channel closed. Because some of the voltage-gated sodium ion channels have recovered and the voltage-gated potassium ion channels remain open, it is possible to initiate another action potential if the stimulus is stronger than a stimulus which can fire an action potential when the membrane is at rest.

==Gap junctions==
Gap junctions allow the action potential to be transferred from one cell to the next (they are said to &quot;electrically couple&quot; neighbouring cardiac cells). They are made from the connexin family of proteins, that form a pore through which ions (including Na+, Ca2+ and K+) can pass. As potassium is highest within the cell, it is mainly potassium that passes through. This increased potassium in the neighbour cell causes the membrane potential to increase slightly, activating the sodium channels and initiating an action potential in this cell. (A brief chemical gradient driven efflux of Na+ through the connexon at peak depolarization causes the conduction of cell to cell depolarization, not potassium.) These connections allow for the rapid conduction of the action potential throughout the heart and are responsible for allowing all of the cells in the atria to contract together as well as all of the cells in the ventricles. Uncoordinated contraction of heart muscles is the basis for arrhythmia and heart failure.

==Channels==
Ion channels are proteins that change shape in response to different stimuli to either allow or prevent the movement of specific ions across a membrane. They are said to be selectively permeable. Stimuli, which can either come from outside the cell or from within the cell, can include the binding of a specific molecule to a receptor on the channel (also known as ligand-gated ion channels) or a change in membrane potential around the channel, detected by a sensor (also known as voltage-gated ion channels) and can act to open or close the channel. The pore formed by an ion channel is aqueous (water-filled) and allows the ion to rapidly travel across the membrane. Ion channels can be selective for specific ions, so there are Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl− specific channels. They can also be specific for a certain charge of ions (i.e. positive or negative).

Each channel is coded by a set of DNA instructions that tell the cell how to make it. These instructions are known as a gene. Figure 3 shows the important ion channels involved in the cardiac action potential, the current (ions) that flows through the channels, their main protein subunits (building blocks of the channel), some of their controlling genes that code for their structure, and the phases that are active during the cardiac action potential. Some of the most important ion channels involved in the cardiac action potential are described briefly below.

===HCN channels===

Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN channels) are located mainly in pacemaker cells, these channels become active at very negative membrane potentials and allow for the passage of both Na+ and K+ into the cell (which is a movement known as a funny current, If). These poorly selective, cation (positively charged ions) channels conduct more current as the membrane potential becomes more negative (hyperpolarised). The activity of these channels in the SAN cells causes the membrane potential to depolarise slowly and so they are thought to be responsible for the pacemaker potential. Sympathetic nerves directly affect these channels, resulting in an increased heart rate (see below).

===The fast sodium channel===

These sodium channels are voltage-dependent, opening rapidly due to depolarization of the membrane, which usually occurs from neighboring cells, through gap junctions. They allow for a rapid flow of sodium into the cell, depolarizing the membrane completely and initiating an action potential. As the membrane potential increases, these channels then close and lock (become inactive). Due to the rapid influx sodium ions (steep phase 0 in action potential waveform) activation and inactivation of these channels happens almost at exactly the same time. During the inactivation state, Na+ cannot pass through (absolute refractory period). However they begin to recover from inactivation as the membrane potential becomes more negative (relative refractory period).

===Potassium channels===
The two main types of potassium channels in cardiac cells are inward rectifiers and voltage-gated potassium channels.

Inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir) favour the flow of K+ into the cell. This influx of potassium, however, is larger when the membrane potential is more negative than the equilibrium potential for K+ (~-90 mV). As the membrane potential becomes more positive (i.e. during cell stimulation from a neighbouring cell), the flow of potassium into the cell via the Kir decreases. Therefore, Kir is responsible for maintaining the resting membrane potential and initiating the depolarization phase. However, as the membrane potential continues to become more positive, the channel begins to allow the passage of K+ &quot;out&quot; of the cell. This outward flow of potassium ions at the more positive membrane potentials means that the Kir can also aid the final stages of repolarisation.

The voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv) are activated by depolarization. The currents produced by these channels include the transient out potassium current &quot;I&quot;to1. This current has two components. Both components activate rapidly, but &quot;I&quot;to,fast inactivates more rapidly than &quot;I&quot;to, slow. These currents contribute to the early repolarization phase (phase 1) of the action potential.

Another form of voltage-gated potassium channels are the delayed rectifier potassium channels. These channels carry potassium currents which are responsible for the plateau phase of the action potential, and are named based on the speed at which they activate: slowly activating &quot;I&quot;Ks, rapidly activating &quot;I&quot;Kr and ultra-rapidly activating &quot;I&quot;Kur.

===Calcium channels===
There are two voltage-gated calcium channels within cardiac muscle: L-type calcium channels (&#x27;L&#x27; for Long-lasting) and T-type calcium channels (&#x27;T&#x27; for Transient, i.e. short). L-type channels are more common and are most densely populated within the T-tubule membrane of ventricular cells, whereas the T-type channels are found mainly within atrial and pacemaker cells, but still to a lesser degree than L-type channels.

These channels respond to voltage changes across the membrane differently: L-type channels are activated by more positive membrane potentials, take longer to open and remain open longer than T-type channels. This means that the T-type channels contribute more to depolarization (phase 0) whereas L-type channels contribute to the plateau (phase 2).

==Conduction system==

In the heart&#x27;s conduction system electrical activity that originates from the sinoatrial node (SAN) is propagated via the His-Purkinje network, the fastest conduction pathway within the heart. The electrical signal travels from the sinoatrial node, which stimulates the atria to contract, to the atrioventricular node (AVN), which slows down conduction of the action potential from the atria to the ventricles. This delay allows the ventricles to fully fill with blood before contraction. The signal then passes down through a bundle of fibres called the bundle of His, located between the ventricles, and then to the Purkinje fibers at the bottom (apex) of the heart, causing ventricular contraction.

In addition to the SAN, the AVN and Purkinje fibres also have pacemaker activity and can therefore spontaneously generate an action potential. However, these cells usually do not depolarize spontaneously, simply because action potential production in the SAN is faster. This means that before the AVN or Purkinje fibres reach the threshold potential for an action potential, they are depolarized by the oncoming impulse from the SAN This is called &quot;overdrive suppression&quot;. Pacemaker activity of these cells is vital, as it means that if the SAN were to fail, then the heart could continue to beat, albeit at a lower rate (AVN= 40-60 beats per minute,
Purkinje fibres = 20-40 beats per minute). These pacemakers will keep a patient alive until the emergency team arrives.

An example of premature ventricular contraction is the classic athletic heart syndrome. Sustained training of athletes causes a cardiac adaptation where the resting SAN rate is lower (sometimes around 40 beats per minute). This can lead to atrioventricular block, where the signal from the SAN is impaired in its path to the ventricles. This leads to uncoordinated contractions between the atria and ventricles, without the correct delay in between and in severe cases can result in sudden death.

===Regulation by the autonomic nervous system===
The speed of action potential production in pacemaker cells is affected, but not controlled by the autonomic nervous system.

The sympathetic nervous system (nerves dominant during the body&#x27;s fight-or-flight response) increase heart rate (positive chronotropy), by decreasing the time to produce an action potential in the SAN. Nerves from the spinal cord release a molecule called noradrenaline, which binds to and activates receptors on the pacemaker cell membrane called β1 adrenoceptors. This activates a protein, called a Gs-protein (s for stimulatory). Activation of this G-protein leads to increased levels of cAMP in the cell (via the cAMP pathway). cAMP binds to the HCN channels (see above), increasing the funny current and therefore increasing the rate of depolarization, during the pacemaker potential. The increased cAMP also increases the opening time of L -type calcium channels, increasing the Ca2+ current through the channel, speeding up phase 0.

The parasympathetic nervous system (nerves dominant while the body is resting and digesting) decreases heart rate (negative chronotropy), by increasing the time taken to produce an action potential in the SAN. A nerve called the vagus nerve, that begins in the brain and travels to the sinoatrial node, releases a molecule called acetylcholine (ACh) which binds to a receptor located on the outside of the pacemaker cell, called an M2 muscarinic receptor. This activates a Gi-protein (I for inhibitory), which is made up of 3 subunits (α, β and γ) which, when activated, separate from the receptor. The β and γ subunits activate a special set of potassium channels, increasing potassium flow out of the cell and decreasing membrane potential, meaning that the pacemaker cells take longer to reach their threshold value. The Gi-protein also inhibits the cAMP pathway therefore reducing the sympathetic effects caused by the spinal nerves.

==Clinical significance==

Antiarrhythmic drugs are used to regulate heart rhythms that are too fast. Other drugs used to influence the cardiac action potential include sodium channel blockers, beta blockers, potassium channel blockers, and calcium channel blockers.

<doc id="857172" wikidata="Q1823663" url="?curid=857172" title="Sophia Perovskaya">
<text>Sophia Lvovna Perovskaya (;  – ) was a Russian revolutionary and a member of the revolutionary organization &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot;. She helped orchestrate the assassination of Alexander II of Russia, for which she was executed by hanging.

==Life as a revolutionary==
Perovskaya was born in Saint Petersburg, into an aristocratic family who were the descendants by the marriage of Elizabeth of Russia. Her father, Lev Nikolaievich Perovsky, was the military governor of Saint Petersburg. Her grandfather, Nikolay Perovsky, was a governor of Taurida. She spent her early years in the Crimea, where her education was largely neglected, but where she began reading serious books on her own. After the family moved to Saint Petersburg, Perovskaya entered the Alarchinsky Courses, a girls’ preparatory program. Here she became friends with several girls who were interested in the radical movement. She left home at the age of sixteen over her father&#x27;s objections to her new friends. In 1871–1872, together with these friends, she joined the Circle of Tchaikovsky. In 1872–1873 and 1874–1877, she worked in the provinces of Samara, Tver, and Simbirsk. During this period, she received diplomas as a teacher and a medical assistant.

A prominent fellow member of the Circle of Tchaikovsky, Peter Kropotkin, said the following of Perovskaya:
In 1873, Perovskaya maintained several conspiracy apartments in Saint Petersburg for secret anti-tsarist propaganda meetings that had not been sanctioned by the authorities. In January 1874, she was arrested and placed in the Peter and Paul fortress in connection with the Trial of the 193. She was acquitted in 1877–1878. Perovskaya also took part in an unsuccessful attempt to free Ippolit Myshkin, a revolutionary and a member of Narodnaya Volya. In the summer of 1878, Perovskaya became a member of &quot;Zemlya i Volya&quot;, was soon arrested again, and banished to the Olonets Governorate. She managed to escape on her way to exile and went underground.

As a member of &quot;Zemlya I Volya&quot;, Perovskaya went to Kharkov in order to organize the liberation of political prisoners from the central prison. In the fall of 1879, she became a member of the Executive Committee and later a member of the administrative committee of &quot;Zemlya i Volya&quot;. Perovskaya propagandized among students, soldiers, and workers, took part in organizing the &quot;Worker&#x27;s Gazette&quot;, and maintained ties with political prisoners in Saint Petersburg. In November 1879 she took part in an attempt to blow up the imperial train on its way from Saint Petersburg to Moscow. The attempt failed. On her return to Saint Petersburg she joined &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot;.

==Assassination of Alexander II==
Perovskaya participated in preparing assassination attempts on Alexander II of Russia near Moscow (November 1879), in Odessa (spring of 1880), and Saint Petersburg (the attempt that eventually killed him, 1 March 1881). She was the closest friend and later the wife of Andrei Zhelyabov, a member of the executive committee of &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot;. Zhelyabov was to have directed the bombing attack, with the group of four bomb-throwers - Ignacy Hryniewiecki, Nikolai Kibalchich, Timofey Mikhailov, and Nikolai Rysakov. However, when Zhelyabov was arrested two days prior to the attack, Perovskaya took the role.

The night before the attack, Perovskaya helped assemble the bombs.

On Sunday morning, 13 March [1 March, Old Style], the bomb-throwers gathered at the group&#x27;s flat on Telezhnaya Street. At 9–10 AM, Perovskaya and Kibalchich each brought two missiles.
Perovskaya would later relate that, before heading to the Catherine Canal, she, Rysakov and Hryniewiecki sat in a confectionery store located opposite of the Gostiny Dvor, impatiently waiting for the right time to intercept Alexander II&#x27;s cavalcade. From there they parted ways and converged on the canal.

In the afternoon, the Tsar was returning by Catherine Canal in his carriage after watching the weekly military roll call. Perovskaya, by taking out a handkerchief and blowing her nose as a predetermined signal, dispatched the assassins to the canal.
When the carriage was close enough for an attack, Perovskaya gave a signal, and Rysakov threw the bomb under the Tsar&#x27;s carriage. The autocrat survived this first action because his carriage was bulletproof but the second bomb, thrown by Ignacy Hryniewiecki, dispatched him.

==Hanging==
Rysakov was captured, and while in custody, in an attempt to save his life, cooperated with the investigators. His testimony implicated the other participants, and the tsarist police apprehended Sophia Perovskaya, along with others, on 22 March. Rysakov established the identity of all prisoners. Although he knew many of them only by their party pseudonyms, he was able to describe the role they each had played.

Just before her trial, she wrote in a letter to her mother:
Perovskaya, along with the other conspirators were tried by the Special Tribunal of the Ruling Senate on 26–29 March and sentenced to death by hanging.

On the morning of 15 April [3 April, Old Style], the prisoners were transported to the parade grounds of the Semenovsky Regiment, where the execution was set to take place. They were all dressed in black prison uniforms, and on their chests hung a placard with the inscription: &quot;Regicide&quot;. Perovskaya, along with Mikhailov and Kibalchich, was placed on a cart that was drawn through the city by a pair of horses.
The correspondent of the London Times estimated that the execution was attended by a hundred thousand spectators. When priests ascended the gallows to give the last rites, the convicts almost simultaneously approached them and kissed the crucifix. Once the priests withdrew, Zhelyabov and Mikhailov approached Perovskaya and they kissed each other good-bye. Perovskaya had turned away from Rysakov.
Four other Pervomartovtsy, including Zhelyabov, were hanged with her.

Perovskaya was the first woman in Russia executed for a political crime.

== Legacy ==
Three decades after her death, Perovskaya would become the inspiration for the Japanese feminist Kanno Sugako, who was involved in a 1910 plan to assassinate the Emperor Meiji. Kanno was also executed by hanging.

In 2018 the &quot;New York Times&quot; published a belated obituary for Perovskaya.

== In literature ==
* Henry Parkes was inspired by her to write the poem, &quot;The Beauteous Terrorist&quot;. Reproduced in full in &quot;The Beauteous Terrorist and Other Poems by Sydney Electronic Text and Image Service.
* Moss, Walter G., &quot;Alexander II and His Times: A Narrative History of Russia in the Age of Alexander II, Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky&quot;. London: Anthem Press, 2002. Several chapters on Perovskaya. (available online )

<doc id="857183" wikidata="Q5442957" url="?curid=857183" title="Fen Rivers Way">
<text>The Fen Rivers Way is a long distance footpath that spans a distance of . It runs between the City of Cambridge and the town of King&#x27;s Lynn in West Norfolk. It follows the course of the River Cam and River Great Ouse across the Fenland landscape into the Wash. It provides a small part of European Long Distance Path E2 which goes from Nice to Galway.

==Description==
The Fenland landscape is a man-made environment constructed over many centuries. This fertile land is dominated by agriculture and is dissected by dykes, draining ditches, rivers and embankments. The walk gives walkers the opportunity to see the Fenland&#x27;s open landscape and skies that contribute to the character of the Fens. The walk has a number of points of historical and wildlife interest. The route passes close to five railway stations, offering opportunities for one-way walks of varying lengths.

==The route==
Starting from Cambridge, the route follows the River Cam with its banks and pastures fringed with weeping willow trees and out into the fens. The Cam Washes have been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest because of their rare and special habitats and wildlife. Within this SSSI, otters can sometimes be seen. Approximately north-east of Cambridge is Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve, where walkers will pass through the remains of a fragment of a Fenland wilderness of former times. Wicken Fen was the first nature reserve to be owned by the National Trust and has been in its care since 1899. Wicken Fen is a haven for birds, plants, insects and mammals. It can be explored by the traditional wide droves and lush green paths, including a boardwalk nature trail, giving access to several hides.

A little north of here, the River Cam joins the River Great Ouse. Next walkers approach the city of Ely. The magnificent Ely Cathedral and ancient city dominate the skyline for miles around. At the hamlet of Brandon Creek, the Great Ouse is joined by the River Little Ouse and the route enters the county of Norfolk.

The Great Ouse is now contained by flood banks and from these banks there are views of the surrounding countryside. Denver Sluice, being at the confluence of five watercourses, was first built across the river in 1651 as a focus of the flood defence system that protects the low lying Fens, although it had to be rebuilt after bursting in 1713. Nearby Denver Windmill is a fully restored 19th century windmill which lies on the path of the Roman Fen Causeway. The Ouse Washes are an internationally significant environment. Flooded in winter, they attract thousands of migrating wildfowl. From Denver the river is tidal, bringing with it subtle changes in scenery and habitat. Close by is the Relief Channel, the final link in the drainage system, completed in 1964. The two waterways meet at King&#x27;s Lynn, the historic port on the edge of the Wash where the footpath ends.

==Way markings==

The route is marked with a small circular badge with a blue eel logo.

In 1995, Cambridge&#x27;s local newspaper, &quot;The Cambridge Evening News&quot;, ran a competition for its children&#x27;s Saturday Club, to name the route and design the logo. The winning entry naming the walk &quot;Fen Rivers Way&quot; with an eel as the logo, was submitted by Alexander Hunt from Teversham.

==Further walks==
There are four smaller circular walks along the Fen Rivers Way.

<text>Argyll was a Scottish motor car marque manufactured from 1899 to 1932, and again from 1976 to around 1990.

==The original Argyll marque==
Alex Govan founded The Hozier Engineering Company in 1899, and it was at this factory that the first &quot;Argyll Voiturette&quot; was produced; copied from the contemporary Renault, it featured a 2¾ hp de Dion engine and shaft-drive. 1901 models had an upgraded engine of 5 hp; cars made in 1902 were upgraded even further, using 8 hp units. Soon there appeared a 10 hp twin with radiator tubes forming the sides of the hood; in 1904 the company introduced a range of Aster-engined cars with front-mounted radiators. One of these was a 10 hp of 1985 cc; others were fours of 3054 cc, 3686 cc, and 4849 cc. All cars featured Govan&#x27;s rather awkward gearbox, which had a T-shaped gate and separate reverse and change-speed levers. The company, by now named Argyll Motors Ltd. had now become Scotland&#x27;s biggest marque and soon moved from its premises in Bridgeton, Glasgow to a grand, purpose-built factory in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire. The Argyll Motor Works covered , had its own railway line, and was opened in 1906 by John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu. However, the new factory was never used to capacity, and the company began to decline after Govan&#x27;s death in 1907. It went into liquidation in 1908.

Production restarted in 1910, under a company now named Argylls Ltd., with a new range of cars including the famed &quot;Flying Fifteen&quot;, and a six-cylinder model. The 12/14 was widely sold as a taxi even being exported to New York. Four-wheel brakes designed by J.M. Rubury of Argyll and patented on 18 March 1910 by Henri Perrot and John Meredith Rubury (Patent number 6807) were available from 1911 on, and in 1912 the single Sleeve valve engine designed by company director Baillie P. Burt and J. P. McCollum began production; the entire range featured Burt-McCollum engines by 1914.

In May 1914, Argylls submitted two water-cooled 6-cylinder inline aero-engines to the British War Office as part of a contest to select new aircraft engines. During the competition one of the engines broke its crankshaft. The other engine completed a six hour run test at full load winning a £100 prize. Ultimately the type was not selected for production.

Argylls changed hands in 1914 and the Alexandria factory was sold to the Royal Navy for torpedo production. Car production was resumed on a small scale in the original Bridgeton works under the control of John Brimlow who had previously run the repair department. The first product from the new company was a revival of the pre-war 15·9 hp model, now with electric starter but few were sold. In 1922, it was joined by a 1½-litre sleeve valve model and in 1926 by the 12/40 sports.

The company made a final appearance at the London Motor Show in 1927 and the last cars were probably made in 1928 though still advertised until Argyll closed in 1932.

==The second Argyll era==

The name was re-used in 1976 by a new company who made a mid-engined sports car, the Argyll GT, in Lochgilphead, Scotland.

The new manufacturing company was founded by Bob Henderson. The new car was named after the original Argyll of 1898, in honour of a grandfather of one of the investors who worked in the Argyll factory at Alexandria.

The only model was the mid-engined Argyll GT (or &quot;Turbo GT&quot;), which was based on a sturdy box section chassis with space frame clothed in a fibreglass bodyshell made next door to the old Arrol-Johnston factory in Dumfries by Solway Marine. The 1976 prototype car featured a turbocharged Rover V8 engine. A version with a turbocharged Saab engine was also mooted, but none were built. The suspension came from the Triumph 2500 and the gearbox was a ZF 5-speed unit. By undoing ten bolts, the entire rear end, suspension, gearbox and engine came away.

A production version of the car, which made its debut in 1983, had a non-turbocharged version of the &quot;Douvrin&quot; Euro V6 as used by Renault, Peugeot and others, together with a Renault 30 transaxle. A turbocharged V8 of 3.5 - 4.2 litres, together with the ZF transmission, was an option, but none were built. Other engine options were the Lancia Beta engine and transmission, and a Buick V6 which had started out as a stillborn Indycar engine. A top speed of 160 mph (ca. 260 km/h) with the turbo V8 was claimed but never ratified. The quoted price at launch was £25-30,000, which was comparable to the contemporary Ferrari 308 GTB. Production capacity was stated to be twelve cars a year, but none were sold. The silver version used for the launch and publicity material belonged to the company accountant and was virtually never driven.

<text>Banish is an American brand of skincare products founded by Daisy Jing in 2013. The line of products includes oils, microneedling kits, vitamin C serums, exfoliating masks and other treatments for acne scarring.

==History==
Prior to founding the company, Banish founder Daisy Jing created a YouTube channel called &quot;The Acne Channel&quot;, where she uploaded videos about her experiences with acne. Jing initially planned to study Pre-Med at Duke University in order to become a dermatologist, before switching her major. After discovering microneedling and vitamin C treatments, she began creating her own skin products in her kitchen. She founded Banish on September 25, 2013. Banish was on the Inc. 5000 list in 2017. In 2019, Jing discussed the experiences that led to founding Banish in a TEDx talk at Georgia Tech.

==Products==
Banish sells a starter kit that contains a vitamin C serum and facial mist, pumpkin enzyme and charcoal exfoliating masks, and a moisturizer. Banish also sells a microneedling tool known as the Banisher 2.0. The Banisher 2.0 uses gold-plated titanium bristles for microneedling. There is also a Banish &quot;Fighter Gel&quot; made from green tea extract and aloe.

<doc id="857187" wikidata="Q7314221" url="?curid=857187" title="Representation theory of Hopf algebras">
<text>In abstract algebra, a representation of a [[Hopf algebra]] is a representation of its underlying associative algebra. That is, a representation of a Hopf algebra &quot;H&quot; over a field &quot;K&quot; is a &quot;K&quot;-vector space &quot;V&quot; with an action usually denoted by juxtaposition (that is, the image of is written &quot;hv&quot;). The vector space &quot;V&quot; is called an &quot;H&quot;-module.

== Properties ==
The module structure of a representation of a Hopf algebra &quot;H&quot; is simply its structure as a module for the underlying associative algebra. The main use of considering the additional structure of a Hopf algebra is when considering all &quot;H&quot;-modules as a category. The additional structure is also used to define invariant elements of an &quot;H&quot;-module &quot;V&quot;. An element &quot;v&quot; in &quot;V&quot; is invariant under &quot;H&quot; if for all &quot;h&quot; in &quot;H&quot;, , where &quot;ε&quot; is the counit of &quot;H&quot;. The subset of all invariant elements of &quot;V&quot; forms a submodule of &quot;V&quot;.

== Categories of representations as a motivation for Hopf algebras ==
For an associative algebra &quot;H&quot;, the tensor product of two &quot;H&quot;-modules &quot;V&quot;1 and &quot;V&quot;2 is a vector space, but not necessarily an &quot;H&quot;-module. For the tensor product to be a functorial product operation on &quot;H&quot;-modules, there must be a linear binary operation such that for any &quot;v&quot; in and any &quot;h&quot; in &quot;H&quot;,
: formula_1
and for any &quot;v&quot; in &quot;V&quot;1 ⊗ &quot;V&quot;2 and &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in &quot;H&quot;,
: formula_2
using sumless Sweedler&#x27;s notation, which is somewhat like an index free form of the Einstein summation convention. This is satisfied if there is a Δ such that for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; in &quot;H&quot;.

For the category of &quot;H&quot;-modules to be a strict monoidal category with respect to ⊗, formula_3 and formula_4 must be equivalent and there must be unit object &quot;ε&quot;&quot;H&quot;, called the trivial module, such that , &quot;V&quot; and are equivalent. 

This means that for any &quot;v&quot; in 
: formula_5 
and for &quot;h&quot; in &quot;H&quot;,
: formula_6

This will hold for any three &quot;H&quot;-modules if Δ satisfies 
: formula_7

The trivial module must be one-dimensional, and so an algebra homomorphism may be defined such that for all &quot;v&quot; in &quot;ε&quot;&quot;H&quot;. The trivial module may be identified with &quot;F&quot;, with 1 being the element such that for all &quot;v&quot;. It follows that for any &quot;v&quot; in any &quot;H&quot;-module &quot;V&quot;, any &quot;c&quot; in &quot;ε&quot;&quot;H&quot; and any &quot;h&quot; in &quot;H&quot;,
: formula_8

The existence of an algebra homomorphism &quot;ε&quot; satisfying 
: formula_9 
is a sufficient condition for the existence of the trivial module. 

It follows that in order for the category of &quot;H&quot;-modules to be a monoidal category with respect to the tensor product, it is sufficient for &quot;H&quot; to have maps Δ and &quot;ε&quot; satisfying these conditions. This is the motivation for the definition of a bialgebra, where Δ is called the comultiplication and &quot;ε&quot; is called the counit.

In order for each &quot;H&quot;-module &quot;V&quot; to have a dual representation &quot;V&quot; such that the underlying vector spaces are dual and the operation * is functorial over the monoidal category of &quot;H&quot;-modules, there must be a linear map such that for any &quot;h&quot; in &quot;H&quot;, &quot;x&quot; in &quot;V&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;V&quot;*,
: formula_10
where formula_11 is the usual pairing of dual vector spaces. If the map formula_12 induced by the pairing is to be an &quot;H&quot;-homomorphism, then for any &quot;h&quot; in &quot;H&quot;, &quot;x&quot; in &quot;V&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;V&quot;*,
: formula_13
which is satisfied if 
: formula_14 
for all &quot;h&quot; in &quot;H&quot;.

If there is such a map &quot;S&quot;, then it is called an &quot;antipode&quot;, and &quot;H&quot; is a Hopf algebra. The desire for a monoidal category of modules with functorial tensor products and dual representations is therefore one motivation for the concept of a Hopf algebra.

== Representations on an algebra ==
A Hopf algebra also has representations which carry additional structure, namely they are algebras.

Let &quot;H&quot; be a Hopf algebra. If &quot;A&quot; is an algebra with the product operation , and is a representation of &quot;H&quot; on &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;ρ&quot; is said to be a representation of &quot;H&quot; on an algebra if &quot;μ&quot; is &quot;H&quot;-equivariant. As special cases, Lie algebras, Lie superalgebras and groups can also have representations on an algebra.

<text>Thunder Bay is a bay in the U.S. state of Michigan on Lake Huron. The bay extends from North Point at to South Point at .

The city of Alpena lies at the mouth of the Thunder Bay River at . The entire bay lies within Alpena County, with Alpena Township in the north and Sanborn Township in the south.

Several islands in the bay are protected as part of the Michigan Islands National Wildlife Refuge. Thunder Bay Island lies just east of North Point outside the bay. The wildlife in the Bay&#x27;s waters are protected as part of the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary.

The name is the English translation of the French &quot;Anse du Tonnerre&quot;, which appears as early as the map of Franquelin in 1688. It was probably derived from the Native American name, as they believed that the Bay was peculiarly subject to thunder storms. The Thunder Bay Band of Chippewa and Ottawa, who called this bay home, merged with the Mackinac Bands of Chippewa and Ottawa Indians in the mid 1800s under Chief Way-ge-maw-waw-be.

There are a substantial number of shipwrecks in and around Thunder Bay. Diving is an important activity.

<doc id="857218" wikidata="Q217531" url="?curid=857218" title="STS-115">
<text>STS-115 was a Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station (ISS) flown by . It was the first assembly mission to the ISS after the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, following the two successful &quot;Return to Flight&quot; missions, STS-114 and STS-121. STS-115 launched from LC-39B at the Kennedy Space Center on September 9, 2006, at 11:14:55 EDT (15:14:55 UTC).

The mission is also referred to as ISS-12A by the ISS program. The mission delivered the second port-side truss segment (ITS P3/P4), a pair of solar arrays (2A and 4A), and batteries. A total of three spacewalks were performed, during which the crew connected the systems on the installed trusses, prepared them for deployment, and did other maintenance work on the station.

STS-115 was originally scheduled to launch in April 2003. The &quot;Columbia&quot; accident in February 2003 pushed the date back to August 27, 2006, which was again moved back for various reasons, including a threat from Tropical Storm Ernesto and the strongest lightning strike to ever hit an occupied shuttle launchpad.

==Crew==
===Crew notes===
Canadian Space Agency astronaut MacLean became the first Canadian to operate Canadarm2 and its Mobile Base in space as he was handed a new set of solar arrays from Ferguson and Burbank controlling the original Canadian robotic arm, the Canadarm. MacLean performed a spacewalk, becoming only the second Canadian, after Chris Hadfield to do so.

The mission patch worn on the clothing used by the astronauts of STS-115 was designed by Graham Huber, Peter Hui, and Gigi Lui, three students at York University in Toronto, Ontario, the same university that Steve MacLean attended. The students also designed Steve MacLean&#x27;s personal patch for this mission.

==Mission payloads==
The primary payload was the second left-side ITS P3/P4 Truss segment, a pair of solar arrays, and associated batteries.

===Mission objectives===
* Delivery and installation of two truss segments (P3 and P4)
* Delivery and deployment of two new solar arrays (4A and 2A)
* Perform three spacewalks to connect truss segments, remove restraints on solar arrays, and prepare the station for the next assembly mission by STS-116

NASA managers decided to move the STS-115 launch date forward to August 27 to obtain better lighting conditions to photograph the external tank. This occurred before with STS-31 and STS-82. The launch window was co-ordinated with the Soyuz TMA-9 launch in mid-September, which delivered a new ISS crew and fresh supplies to the station. The Soyuz spacecraft operationally did not dock to the station while the Space Shuttle was there.

The mission marks:
*147th NASA crewed space flight.
*116th space shuttle flight since STS-1.
*27th flight of &quot;Atlantis&quot;.
*91st post-&quot;Challenger&quot; mission.
*3rd post-&quot;Columbia&quot; mission.
*1st post-&quot;Columbia&quot; mission of &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

==Mission timeline==

===Launch preparations===
&quot;Atlantis&quot; was rolled out from the Orbiter Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) on July 24, 2006. It was lowered onto the mobile launcher platform on July 26 and rolled out to Pad 39B in the early morning hours of August 2. The rollout was scheduled for July 31, but a storm in the vicinity of the Kennedy Space Center resulted in a delay of two days from fears of the orbiter being hit by lightning, which could cause immeasurable damage.

On the weekend of August 5 to 6, 2006, engineers completed a &quot;flight readiness&quot; check of the shuttle&#x27;s main engines, which were deemed ready for launch. The crew arrived at the Kennedy Space Center August 7, 2006, for four days of launch rehearsals, including a practice countdown August 10.

Top NASA managers held a Flight Readiness Review (FRR) meeting August 15–16, 2006 to finalize the launch date. Foam loss from the external tank was a key issue at this meeting because on August 13, 2006, NASA announced there was an average amount of loss from the external tank of STS-121, the previous mission. &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s demise was due to a piece of foam, shed from its external tank, striking the shuttle&#x27;s left wing during launch and causing a hole that was breached during re-entry.
The meeting also discussed problems with the bolts securing the shuttle&#x27;s Ku-band antenna, which might not have been threaded correctly. The installation had been in place for several flights and hadn&#x27;t experienced any problems. At the end of the two-day meeting, NASA managers had decided to proceed with the launch on August 27, 2006. However, on August 18, 2006, NASA decided to replace the antenna bolts with &quot;Atlantis&quot; still on the launch pad. NASA had no procedure to replace these on the pad, but the work was nonetheless completed by August 20, without affecting the planned launch date.
On August 25, 2006, a direct lightning strike, the most powerful recorded at Kennedy Space Center, hit the lightning rod atop the launch pad. As a result, on August 26 the Mission Management Team ordered the mission postponed for at least 24 hours to assess damage. On August 27, the decision was made to postpone the launch for another 24 hours, making the earliest possible launch date August 29, 2006, still unassured that there was no damage from the lightning strike and taking into account the possible threat from Hurricane Ernesto.

On August 28, 2006, it was decided to postpone the launch and rollback &quot;Atlantis&quot; to the VAB after updated forecasts projected Hurricane Ernesto would regain its strength and pass closer to Kennedy Space Center than previously anticipated. NASA began rolling back the shuttle on August 29, 2006, in the late morning, but by early afternoon the decision was made to move &quot;Atlantis&quot; back to the launch pad (something that has never been done before) to weather out Tropical Storm Ernesto instead. The change came after weather forecasters determined that the storm wouldn&#x27;t hit Kennedy Space Center as forcefully as they once thought. Its peak winds were expected to be less than 79 mph (126 kilometers per hour), NASA&#x27;s limit for keeping the shuttle outdoors.

By the early morning of August 31, 2006, the storm had passed and inspection teams began a survey for damage to the launch facilities. Only three problems were discovered, all of which were simple repairs. A target date for launch was set for September 6 with the option to launch for another two days after NASA and Russian space managers agreed to extend the launch window by one day.
On the morning of September 3, 2006, the official countdown began at the T minus 43-hour mark, with about 30 hours of scheduled holds. In the early morning of September 6, 2006, engineers observed an apparent internal short when one of the three electricity producing fuel cells was powered up. When engineers couldn&#x27;t figure out the problem in time, the launch was scrubbed for the day to further analyze the fuel cell problem. Late Wednesday evening NASA managers decided that they would not attempt a launch on Thursday, and scheduled the next launch attempt for September 8, 2006. Originally they had ruled out September 9 as a potential launch date due to a conflict with the planned Russian Soyuz mission Soyuz TMA-9, which was scheduled to, and did, launch on September 18, 2006. This caused some news agencies to report that Friday as the last chance for a launch until October.

===September 8 (Launch attempt 1)===
On the morning of September 8, 2006, it was reported that one of the engine cut-off (ECO) sensors in the external tank had failed. About half an hour before the scheduled launch time, NASA announced it had decided to delay the launch for another 24 hours while the fuel was drained out of the external tank and the problem assessed. The sensor in question, ECO sensor No. 3, was proved to be faulty when it indicated that there was still liquid hydrogen in the external tank despite all of it being drained out. The other three ECO sensors correctly indicated a dry tank; and as long as they didn&#x27;t start to malfunction, NASA could allow a launch with three out of the four ECO sensors operational.

===September 9 (Flight day 1, Launch)===

On September 9, 2006, all the engine cut-off sensors were working properly, and following a flawless countdown, at 15:15 UTC (11:15 EDT), &quot;Atlantis&quot; lifted off the launch pad to the International Space Station. As &quot;Atlantis&quot; launched, the International Space Station was above the northern Atlantic Ocean, between Greenland and Iceland.

During the climb to orbit, Mission Control asked the crew to reconfigure a cooling system that apparently had ice build up. The reconfiguration cleared the system, called the Flash Evaporator System, and it operated normally. Temporary ice in that cooling unit is not uncommon and has occurred on previous missions.

Moments after main engine cutoff, 8.5 minutes after liftoff, Tanner and MacLean used hand-held video and digital still cameras to document the external tank after it separated from the shuttle. That imagery, as well as imagery gathered by cameras in the shuttle&#x27;s umbilical well where the tank was connected, was transmitted to the ground for review.

===September 10 (Flight day 2)===
:&quot;Day 2: Canadarm inspection animation&quot;
During their first full day in space, the crew thoroughly examined &quot;Atlantis&quot; with the Orbiter Boom Sensor System, the 15 meter (50-foot) long extension for the shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm. Pilot Chris Ferguson and mission specialists Dan Burbank and Steve MacLean performed a slow, steady inspection of the reinforced carbon-carbon panels along the leading edge of &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; starboard and port wings and the nose cap.

The crew worked ahead of schedule for most of the day readying the ship for docking and preparing for the mission&#x27;s three planned extra-vehicular activities (EVA). Mission specialists Joe Tanner and Heide Stefanyshyn-Piper checked out the spacesuits and tools that they, Burbank and MacLean used during spacewalks set for Days 4, 5, and 7. The spacewalks installed the girder-like P3/P4 truss, deploy new solar arrays, and prepare them for operation.

On the space station, Expedition 13 Flight Engineer Jeffrey Williams prepared the orbiting laboratory for &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; arrival on Day 3. He readied the digital cameras that was used to take high-resolution photos of the shuttle&#x27;s heat shield. With help from Commander Pavel Vinogradov, Williams pressurized the Pressurized Mating Adapter 2 at the end of the Destiny Laboratory Module, where &quot;Atlantis&quot; later docked. Vinogradov also prepacked equipment to be returned.

===September 11 (Flight day 3)===

:&quot;Day 3: Docking animation&quot;

Prior to docking, Jett flew &quot;Atlantis&quot; through an orbital back flip while stationed about 180 meters (600 feet) below the space station. The maneuver allowed the Expedition 13 crew to take a series of high-resolution photographs of the orbiter&#x27;s heat shield.

At about 10:46 UTC &quot;Atlantis&quot; docked with the International Space Station, and almost two hours later the hatch between them was opened, and the crew was welcomed aboard the station at 12:35 UTC.

:&quot;Day 3: Handoff animation&quot;

Following docking, Ferguson and Burbank attached the shuttle&#x27;s robotic Canadarm to the 17.5-ton P3/P4 truss, lifted it from its berth in the payload bay, and maneuvered it for handover to the station&#x27;s Canadarm2.

After hatch opening, MacLean and Expedition 13 Flight Engineer Jeff Williams then used the Canadarm2 to take the truss from the shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm. MacLean is the first Canadian to operate the Canadarm2 in space.

Tanner and Stefanyshyn-Piper began the &quot;camping out&quot; preparations in the Quest Airlock to prepare for a Day 4 spacewalk. The preparations are new pre-breathing measures on the part of NASA, to avoid decompression sickness, or &quot;the bends&quot;, by getting rid of some nitrogen in their bloodstreams. The preparations involve wearing oxygen masks and sleeping overnight in the airlock with the airlock at under 69 kPa (10 psi), to acclimate their bodies the low pressures they will encounter when wearing their spacesuits.

===September 12 (Flight day 4)===
:&quot;Day 4: Truss installation animation&quot;

Following the installation of the P3/P4 Truss to the ISS by the Canadarm2, Tanner and Stefanyshyn-Piper began their spacewalk to activate the truss at 09:17 UTC. During the EVA they installed power and data cables between the P1 &amp; P3/P4 trusses, released the P3/P4 truss&#x27; launch restraints and a number of other tasks to configure the truss for upcoming activities. The spacewalk was so successful that the astronauts carried out a number of tasks scheduled for later EVAs, with the eventual completion of the EVA at 15:43 UTC. A bolt, spring and washer assembly from a launch lock was lost during these extra activities and floated off into space.

Following the completion of the EVA, the station&#x27;s crew began preparing for Day 5&#x27;s spacewalk, with astronauts Burbank and MacLean entering the Quest Airlock for their &quot;camp out&quot; at 18:40 UTC, ready for the scheduled 09:15 UTC EVA.

===September 13 (Flight day 5)===
:&quot;Day 5: Activation of SARJ animation&quot;

On Day 5, the second spacewalk of the mission was conducted, this time by first-time spacewalkers Burbank and MacLean. They devoted the day to the final tasks required for activation of the Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ). The SARJ is an automobile-sized joint that will allow the station&#x27;s solar arrays to turn and point toward the sun. Burbank and MacLean released locks that had held the joint secure during its launch to orbit aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot;. As they worked, the spacewalkers overcame several minor problems, including a malfunctioning helmet camera, a broken socket tool, a stubborn bolt, and a bolt that came loose from the mechanism designed to hold it captive. The stubborn bolt required the force of both spacewalkers to finally remove it.

Burbank and MacLean spent 7 hours and 11 minutes outside the station, beginning their spacewalk at 09:05 UTC and completing it at 16:16 UTC. In addition to the SARJ work, they completed several &quot;get-ahead&quot; tasks during their time outside.

Engineers encountered a glitch during the four-hour activation and checkout of SARJ, and had temporarily delayed starting the deployment of the new solar arrays pending further work and checkout of the SARJ. The timeline allowed ample time to continue working on the problem during the night and still complete the deploy of the arrays on Thursday as scheduled.

===September 14 (Flight day 6)===
:&quot;Day 6: Solar array deployment animation&quot;
Day 6 continued the installation of the solar array. The unfurling of the solar panels themselves began a little behind schedule due to the problem encountered on Day 5 with SARJ. This problem was determined to be in the software, and a workaround was developed. The unfurling of the panels continued throughout the morning in stages to prevent the panels sticking, as they did during STS-97. It was noted by the crew that some panels were still sticking together, but this didn&#x27;t cause any problems. Although the installation has been completed, the solar arrays will not provide power to the station until the next shuttle mission, STS-116, scheduled for December 2006, when the station will undergo a major electrical system rewiring.

Other activities of Day 6 included a &quot;double walk off&quot; of the station&#x27;s Canadarm2 from its current location at the Mobile Base System to the Destiny Laboratory Module and the preparation for the mission&#x27;s third spacewalk. A number of interviews were also conducted later in the day, between Jett &amp; MacLean and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper &amp; students.

===September 15 (Flight day 7)===
Flight day 7 featured the third and final spacewalk of mission STS-115.
The start of the spacewalk was delayed after a circuit-breaker-like remote power controller (RPC) tripped, causing loss of power to the airlock&#x27;s depressurization pump. This was attributed to a momentary spike in the electric current of the depressurization pump. After assessing data to ensure the system had no short circuit, the breaker was reset and pump reactivated. Joe Tanner and Heide Stefanyshyn-Piper began their spacewalk at 10:00 UTC after a 45-minute delay

During the 6-hour and 42-minute spacewalk, the astronauts carried out numerous maintenance and repair tasks including removal of hardware used to secure the P3/P4 radiator during launch. Ground Flight Controllers subsequently unfurled the radiator, increasing the ability of the station to dissipate heat into space. Also, completed during this spacewalk was the retrieval of a materials exposure experiment from the outside of the ISS, maintenance on the P6 truss, installation of a wireless TV aerial and the replacement of the S1 truss&#x27; S-band antenna assembly.

A number of &quot;get-ahead&quot; tasks previously scheduled for future missions were also performed during this spacewalk. Near the end of the spacewalk, the astronauts carried out a test to evaluate using infrared video of the leading edge of &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; wing to detect debris damage.

After the spacewalk, the station&#x27;s mobile transporter was moved to a worksite on the P3 truss to inspect portions of that truss.

===September 16 (Flight day 8)===

Day 8 of STS-115, the last full day with Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; docked to the ISS, was mainly spent in preparation for the undocking procedures to occur in flight day 9. The crew spent the morning resting following their highly successful mission, and then began getting ready for the undocking by carrying out transfers of ISS equipment and science experiments onto &quot;Atlantis&quot; ready for the trip home.

The crews of Expedition 13 and STS-115 also took part in the traditional joint-crew news conference, with mission Commander Brent Jett commenting on the success of the mission and on the construction missions to follow:

&quot;All of the rest of the assembly missions are going to be challenging. We have similar payloads flying in the future. We are off to a good start on assembly. I think we can pass along a lot of the lessons to the future crews.&quot;

===September 17 (Flight day 9)===

Flight day 9 saw the end of STS-115&#x27;s tasks at the ISS as &quot;Atlantis&quot; undocked from the International Space Station at 12:50 UTC.

Following the traditional farewell ceremonies between Expedition 13 and STS-115, the hatch between &quot;Atlantis&quot; and the ISS was closed and locked at 10:27 UTC. Then, after a series of checks for leaks, &quot;Atlantis&quot; left the dock to begin its 360-degree flyaround of the expanded ISS to document the new configuration.

===September 18 (Flight day 10)===
The crew of STS-115 spent the morning of Flight Day 10 carrying out final inspections of &quot;Atlantis&quot;″ heat shield in preparation for re-entry on flight day 12.

Orbiting around behind the ISS, the crew used the Orbiter&#x27;s robotic arm and boom sensor system to make sure that no damage had been done to &quot;Atlantis&quot;″ nose and wing leading edges by micrometeoroids and other space junk. The crew spent the rest of this light duty day stowing equipment in preparation for re-entry and landing.

===September 19 (Flight day 11)===
During the morning of day 11, astronauts Jett and Ferguson tested &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; reaction control thrusters and practiced for landing using on-board computers. The thrusters will be used to position the shuttle during re-entry.

The crew also took some time for interviews, with Ferguson telling the media that everyone on board was looking forward to landing. &quot;I think we all, thus far, feel pretty good about the job that we did,&quot; Ferguson said. &quot;We are looking forward to a successful re-entry and landing sometime tomorrow.&quot;

Following the interviews, the crew continued their preparations for re-entry by stowing unnecessary equipment and other tasks prior to landing. However, the crew informed the Mission Control Center later in the day that, following the test of the reaction control system, an object was seen moving in a co-orbital path with the Orbiter. The astronauts spotted the object using an on-board TV camera, but unfortunately the resolution of the images was not high enough to identify the object.

The images were sent down to the MCC for further analysis by flight controllers, who were concerned about the possibility that the object may have come off &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and as such wished to identify the object. The most likely scenario was that the object was benign, such as ice or a piece of shimstock (observed earlier in the flight protruding from the heat shield) that may have shaken loose. However, the possibility remained that the object may be of critical importance, such as a tile from the Orbiter&#x27;s thermal protection system, and the Mission Control Center asked &quot;Atlantis&quot;″ crew to power up the shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm ready to reinspect the orbiter, and drew up plans for a series of tests which took place on flight day 12 to determine whether the shuttle was safe for re-entry. This extra inspection, added to poor weather forecasts predicted for the Shuttle Landing Facility for Wednesday, and the de-orbit burn and landing were delayed by a day.

===September 20 (Flight day 12)===
Following the discovery of a co-orbiting object on flight day 11, Flight Controllers spent the early hours of the morning using the Orbiter&#x27;s robotic arm to inspect the upper surface of &quot;Atlantis&quot;, with the astronauts on board the Orbiter spending the rest of the morning scanning the underside of the shuttle for any areas of concern. Following these scans, the crew received word from the Mission Control Center in Houston to use the orbiter boom sensor system to conduct more inspections of &quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; heat shield.

Following the review of these scans, together with an overnight analysis of the payload bay by Ground Flight Controllers, it was determined that there remained no safety issue with &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and Mission Controllers cleared the Orbiter for re-entry. This clean bill of health, added to a favorable weather forecast for the Shuttle Landing Facility for Thursday morning, permitted &quot;Atlantis&quot; to be cleared for a landing the next day.

The crew spent the remainder of the day in preparation for landing, packing up gear and stowing the Ku band antenna used for TV broadcasts. During the inspection, the crew was notified that the Soyuz TMA-9 spacecraft was docked with the ISS above, which carried the first half of the Expedition 14 crew.

===September 21 (Flight day 13 and landing)===

Flight day 13 was the last day of the mission, with the final re-entry procedures and landing taking place during the morning, and numerous debriefs and conferences in the afternoon. The landing process began hours before the actual landing at Kennedy Space Center. The process began with the APU prestart at 04:37 EDT, followed by the closing of the payload bay doors and sealing of the Orbiter at 04:45 EDT. &quot;Atlantis&quot;″ crew received the final &quot;Go&quot; for the prime re-entry window from Mission Control in Houston at 04:52 EDT. The crew then started the deorbit reorientation of the shuttle so that its engines faced in its direction of travel, meaning that by firing the engines for the deorbit burn &quot;Atlantis&quot; would slow down and begin its descent out of orbit.

The de-orbit burn was initiated at 05:15 EDT, lasting 2 minutes 40 seconds with two engines burning well throughout. The astronauts aboard the Orbiter were informed at 05:17 EDT that their burn was perfect, with no alterations required as &quot;Atlantis&quot; began her drop through the atmosphere above the Indian Ocean.

Following the deorbit burn, the crew of &quot;Atlantis&quot; began dumping excess propellant overboard, a process lasting 3 minutes, concluding at 05:26 EDT, with the Orbiter 55 minutes away from landing. Twenty-five minutes later, at 05:51 EDT, &quot;Atlantis&quot; began feeling the effects of the atmosphere at an altitude of approximately , and soon after began its &quot;roll reversal banking&quot; in order to bleed off most of the she was traveling at, ready for landing at less than . The ISS was positioned in such a way as to be above the reentry path taken by &quot;Atlantis&quot;, so the astronauts were able to observe the entire maneuver from above.

At 06:08 EDT, the downlink from the Shuttle was acquired by the MILA tracking station on Merritt Island, Florida, with GPS data beginning to be accepted by the Orbiter three minutes later. Ten minutes following the first detection of &quot;Atlantis&quot;, two sonic booms were heard at Kennedy Space Center as the Orbiter dropped below the sound barrier three minutes prior to touchdown. Commander Jett took control of &quot;Atlantis&quot; a minute later, and, with Kennedy Space Center Runway 33 in sight, began bringing his ship in for a landing.

&quot;Atlantis&quot;&#x27; main gear touched down at 06:21:30 EDT on Runway 33 at the Space Shuttle Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center, with the nose gear following 6 seconds later at 06:21:36 EDT, and, after launch, the Orbiter&#x27;s wheels came to a stop at 06:22:16 EDT, bringing mission STS-115 to an end.

The morning&#x27;s landing was considered a night landing as it took place about 48 minutes before sunrise, and as such was the 21st night landing for the Space Shuttle Program. It was the 63rd landing at Kennedy Space Center, as well as the 27th mission for &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

==Post flight==

While working on the &quot;Atlantis&quot; orbiter, NASA technicians discovered that one of the spacecraft&#x27;s radiator panels showed evidence of micrometeorite damage. A hole was observed which was reported to be about 2.7 mm (0.108 in) in diameter.

==Debris analysis==

NASA&#x27;s Mission Management Team conducted a detailed analysis of data from many sources including ground imagery, radar, shuttle inspections using the Canadarm and from the space station. By Day 2 they pinpointed a handful of launch debris events, and drew a preliminary conclusion that the effect was minimal. Later that day, NASA agency engineers decided that additional heat shield inspections were not required. The preceding only relates to debris shed immediately during or after launch, and not the debris observed on September 19, 2006.

Not mentioned was a large debris event during launch at 48 seconds near max Q. Because it happened on the ET side opposite the Orbiter, it was never a danger to the Shuttle. By the origin from near the top of the ET, it presents a new source of debris and is therefore of concern for further missions.

==Wake-up calls==
A tradition for NASA spaceflights since the days of Gemini, mission crews are played a special musical track at the start of each day in space. Each track is specially chosen, often by their family, and usually has special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

==Contingency mission==
STS-300 was the designation given to the Contingency Shuttle Crew Support mission which would have launched in the event Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; became disabled during STS-114 or STS-121. This rescue mission would have been a modified version of the STS-115 mission with the launch date being brought forward and the crew reduced.
STS-300 would have launched no earlier than August 17, 2006, and the crew for STS-300 would have been a four-person subset of the full STS-115 crew:
* Brent Jett, commander
* Christopher Ferguson, pilot and backup Remote Manipulator System (RMS) operator
* Joseph Tanner, mission specialist 1, Extravehicular 1 and prime RMS operator
* Daniel Burbank, mission specialist 2 and Extravehicular 2

<text>Wilfred Josephs (24 July 1927 – 17 November 1997) was an English composer.

==Life==
Born in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne, the fourth and youngest son of Russian and South Shields Jewish parents, Wilfred Josephs had his first musical studies in Newcastle with Arthur Milner, and showed early promise, but was persuaded by his parents to take up a &#x27;sensible&#x27; career. He subsequently became a dentist, qualifying as a Bachelor of Dental Surgery of the University of Durham in 1951. He later studied at the Guildhall School in London.

In 1963 his &quot;Requiem&quot;, a complete setting of the Hebrew Kaddish, written in memory of the Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust, won the first International Composing Competition of the City of Milan and La Scala – then the biggest musical award in the world, after which he gave up dentistry and became a full-time composer. The Requiem was performed by Nino Sanzogno in Milan, Maurice Handford for the BBC, Max Rudolf in Cincinnati, and Giulini in Chicago. A recording was made by David Measham for Unicorn Kanchana.

Josephs was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Music of Newcastle University in 1978. In October 1996, a concert of his works was given at Newcastle University in his presence. He died in London in 1997, leaving a wife, Valerie, and two daughters, Claudia and Philippa. The Wilfred Josephs Society continues to promote his works, the president of which was Sir Charles Mackerras.

==Works==
Wilfred Josephs was a prolific composer and his classical works include 12 symphonies, 22 concertos, overtures, chamber music, operas, ballets, vocal works – almost all of which had been written to commission. An exception was &quot;Requiescant pro defunctis&quot;, a string quartet composed as Josephs&#x27; personal response to newsreel footage of Auschwitz shown at the time of the Adolf Eichmann trial. This string quartet became the basis of the Kaddish Requiem.

Josephs is best remembered for composing the music for the television series &quot;The Great War&quot; (1964), &quot;Horizon (BBC TV series)&quot; 1964&#x27;, &quot;WPIX Chiller Theatre&quot;, 1965&quot; Theatre 625&quot; (1965), &quot;Talking to a Stranger&quot; (1966), &quot;Weavers Green&quot; (1966), &quot;W. Somerset Maugham&quot; (1969), &quot;Cider with Rosie&quot; (1971), &quot;The Guardians&quot; (1971) &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1976), &quot;Disraeli&quot; (1978), &quot;The Ghosts of Motley Hall&quot; (1976), &quot;Enemy at the Door&quot; (1978), &quot;The Voyage of Charles Darwin&quot; (1978), &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1980), &quot;The Brief&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Return of the Antelope&quot; (1986), as well as incidental music for &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (1967). His film scores include &quot;Cash on Demand&quot; (1961), &quot;Two Letter Alibi&quot; (1962), &quot;Fanatic&quot; (1965), &quot;The Deadly Bees&quot; (1966), &quot;Hostile Witness&quot; (1968), &quot;My Side of the Mountain&quot; (1969), &quot;Cry of the Banshee&quot; (1970), &quot;Dark Places&quot; (1973), &quot;Callan&quot; (1974), &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; (1974), &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; (1975), &quot;The Uncanny&quot; (1977), &quot;Martin&#x27;s Day&quot; (1985) and &quot;Mata Hari&quot; (1985).

In 1966, under the pseudonym Wilfred Wylam, Josephs composed the score for &quot;Man of Magic,&quot; a musical based on the life of magician Harry Houdini, with book by John Morley and Aubrey Cash. Produced by impresario Harold Fielding, the show opened at the Manchester Opera House on 22 October before transferring to the Piccadilly Theatre in London where it ran for 135 performances. 

His other notable works include an opera, &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1983), based on Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s novel, a ballet &quot;Cyrano&quot; (1991) and the &quot;Aelian Dances&quot;, based on Newcastle folk songs (the title is a reference to Newcastle&#x27;s Roman name), a music theatre piece in memory of his nephew, &quot;A Child of the Universe,&quot; Op. 80, and a children&#x27;s opera, &quot;Alice in Wonderland,&quot; Op. 144 (1985–1988).

<text>The Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) is a political party in West Bengal in India. The PDS was founded in February 2001 by former Communist Party of India (Marxist) leaders Saifuddin Choudhury and Samir Putatundu. The PDS was in opposition to the Left Front government in West Bengal.

==History==
The PDS was founded by Saifuddin Chaudhury on 21 February 2001. Samir Putatunda, who had been expelled from CPI(M), joined the new party.

==Alliances==
Initially there was speculation that the PDS would joint with the All India Trinamool Congress, or else that it would be a constituent of an anti-CPI(M) &quot;mahajot&quot; (broad front), but the link between Trinamool and the Hindu rightist Bharatiya Janata Party hindered such a development.

The PDS has formed relations with other pro-Congress leftist outfits, such as the Communist Marxist Party in Kerala and the United Communist Party of India. PDS participates in the Confederation of Indian Communists and Democratic Socialists.

==Elections==
Ahead of the West Bengal state assembly elections in 2001, the PDS had launched their own front. The PDS put up 98 candidates, who together got 219,082 votes (0.6% of the votes in the state). None of their candidates were elected.
Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2004, the PDS had joined hands with Congress, and put up two candidates supported by Congress.

==Organisation==
The flag of the PDS is a red flag with a red star in a white circle. 
The president of the PDS is Saifuddin Chaudhury, the general secretary is Samir Putatundu (formerly the CPI(M) South 24 Paraganas district secretary), and the treasurer is Subir Chaudhury.

The women&#x27;s organization of the PDS is called &quot;Paschim Banga Nari Sanghati Samiti&quot; (West Bengal Women&#x27;s United Association). The president of PBNSS is Kishwar Jahan.
The PDS publishes &quot;Natun Path&quot; (New Way).

<text>Armstrong Siddeley was a British engineering group that operated during the first half of the 20th century. It was formed in 1919 and is best known for the production of luxury vehicles and aircraft engines.

The company was created following the purchase by Armstrong Whitworth of Siddeley-Deasy, a manufacturer of luxury motor cars that were marketed to the top echelon of society. After the merge of companies, this focus on quality continued throughout in the production of cars, aircraft engines, gearboxes for tanks and buses, rocket and torpedo motors, and the development of railcars. Company mergers and takeovers with Hawker Aviation and Bristol Aero Engines saw the continuation of the car production which ceased in August 1960.

The company was absorbed into the Rolls-Royce conglomerate which was interested in the aircraft and aircraft engine business. Eventually, the remaining spares and all motor car interests were sold to the Armstrong Siddeley Owners Club Ltd, which now owns the patents, designs, copyrights and trademarks, including the name Armstrong Siddeley.

Considered &quot;an elegant car appropriate for royal use&quot;, the &quot;Armstrong Siddeley Saloon&quot; was used by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) during his 1930 tour of Uganda.

==History==

===Siddeley Autocar===

The Siddeley Autocar Company, of Coventry, was founded by John Davenport Siddeley (1866–1953) in 1902. Its products, made for him by a Vickers subsidiary, were heavily based on Peugeots using many Peugeot parts and fitted with English-built bodies. J. D. Siddeley was appointed London sales manager of Vickers Limited&#x27;s subsidiary Wolseley in early 1905 at the same time as Wolseley purchased the goodwill and patent rights of his Siddeley car. A few months later Herbert Austin left to form his own business and Siddeley was appointed general manager.

Without the consent of the Vickers brothers Siddeley added his own name to the Wolseley nameplate but it was dropped on his departure.

===Siddeley-Deasy===

In 1909, J. D. Siddeley resigned from Wolseley and in 1910, he took on management of The Deasy Motor Car Manufacturing Company, Limited. The shareholders were so pleased with his success in that post that on 7 November 1912 they unanimously agreed to change the company&#x27;s name to The Siddeley-Deasy Motor Car Company Limited. Siddeley&#x27;s name had been added to the product&#x27;s radiator earlier in 1912. His cars began to use the slogan &quot;As silent as the Sphinx&quot;, sporting a Sphinx as a bonnet mascot.

===Armstrong Siddeley===

In April 1919, Siddeley-Deasy was bought out by Armstrong Whitworth Development Company of Newcastle upon Tyne and in May 1919 became Armstrong Siddeley Motors Ltd, a subsidiary with J. D. Siddeley as managing director. In 1927, Armstrong Whitworth merged its heavy engineering interests with Vickers to form Vickers-Armstrongs. At this point, J. D. Siddeley brought Armstrong Siddeley and Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft into his control. In 1928, Armstrong Siddeley Holdings bought Avro from Crossley Motors. Also that year Siddeley partnered with Walter Gordon Wilson, inventor of the pre-selector gearbox, to create Improved Gears Ltd, which later became Self-Changing Gears – the gearbox that should be credited with enabling the marketing tagline &quot;Cars for the daughters of gentlemen&quot;.

Armstrong Siddeley manufactured luxury cars, aircraft engines, and later, aircraft. In 1935, J. D. Siddeley&#x27;s interests were purchased for £2 million by aviation pioneer Tommy Sopwith, owner of Hawker Aircraft, to form – along with the Gloster Aircraft Company and Air Training Services – Hawker Siddeley, a famous name in British aircraft production. Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft and Armstrong Siddeley Motors became subsidiaries of Hawker Siddeley, with Sopwith himself becoming the new chairman of Armstrong Siddeley Motors. At this time, there remained an &quot;unbroken business association&quot; between the Siddeley family and the Middleton-Joy family who were manufactures of Filtrate Oil and had enjoyed considerable success in car-racing rallies.

Armstrong Siddeley was merged with the aircraft engine business of Bristol Aeroplane Company (Bristol Aero Engines) to form Bristol Siddeley as part of an ongoing rationalisation under government influence of the British aircraft and aircraft engine manufacturers. Armstrong Siddeley produced their last cars in 1960. Bristol Siddeley and Rolls-Royce merged in 1966, the latter subsuming the former which remained for a while as an aircraft engine division within Rolls-Royce.

In June 1972, Rolls-Royce (1972) Ltd sold all the stock of spares plus all patents, specifications, drawings, catalogues and the name of Armstrong Siddeley Motors Ltd to the Armstrong Siddeley Owners Club Ltd. This meant that &quot;Armstrong Siddeley&quot; and &quot;A-S Sphinx Logo&quot; are trademarks and copyright of the Armstrong Siddeley Owners Club Ltd.

The &quot;Siddeley&quot; name survived a while longer in aviation, through Hawker Siddeley Aviation and Hawker Siddeley Dynamics. In 1977 they joined with others to become British Aerospace (BAe) which with further mergers is now BAE Systems.

==Products==

===Motor cars===

The first car produced from the union was a fairly massive machine, a 5-litre . A smaller 18 hp appeared in 1922 and a 2-litre 14 hp was introduced in 1923. 1928 saw the company&#x27;s first 15 hp six; 1929 saw the introduction of a 12 hp vehicle. This was a pioneering year for the marque, during which it first offered the Wilson preselector gearbox as an optional extra; it became standard issue on all cars from 1933. In 1930 the company marketed four models, of 12, 15, 20, and 30 hp, the last costing £1450.

The company&#x27;s rather staid image was endorsed during the 1930s by the introduction of a range of six-cylinder cars with ohv engines, though a four-cylinder 12 hp was kept in production until 1936.

In 1932 - or thereabouts, a line of special, rather more sporty designs was started which resulted in the Rally Tourer series. The aim was to help shake off the somewhat pedestrian image of what was in fact a rather advanced product. Of the 16 rally tourers built, many were used by the owners or senior directors, and were entered into various rallies, achieving some good results and making for good publicity. Only one of those 16 special cars is now known to exist: a 1933, Long-15 Rally Tourer which, according to the records, shared the same body as the 20 hp version (which had a slightly longer bonnet).

In 1933, the 5-litre six-cylinder Siddeley Special was announced, featuring a Hiduminium aluminium alloy engine; this model cost £950. Car production continued at a reduced rate throughout 1940, and a few were assembled in 1941.

The week that World War II ended in Europe, Armstrong Siddeley introduced its first post-war models; these were the Lancaster four-door saloon and the Hurricane drophead coupe. The names of these models echoed the names of aircraft produced by the Hawker Siddeley Group (the name adopted by the company in 1935) during the war. These cars all used a 2-litre six-cylinder (16 hp) engines, increased to 2.3-litre (18 hp) engines in 1949. From 1949 to 1952 two commercial variants of the 18 hp Whitleys were produced, primarily for export. The Utility Coupé was a conventional coupe utility style vehicle, while the Station Coupé was effectively a dual cab vehicle, although it still retained only two doors. However, it did have two rows of seating to accommodate up to four adults and the doors were larger to allow better access to the rear. From 1953 the company produced the Sapphire, with a 3.4-litre six-cylinder engine.

In 1956, the model range was expanded with the addition of the 234 (a 2.3-litre four-cylinder) and the 236 (with the older 2.3-litre six-cylinder engine). The Sapphire 346 sported a bonnet mascot in the shape of a sphinx with namesake Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire jet engines attached. The 234 and 236 Sapphires might have looked to some of marque&#x27;s loyal customers like a radical departure from the traditional Armstrong Siddeley appearance. However, in truth, they were simply too conservative in a period of rapidly developing automotive design. If the &quot;baby Sapphire&quot; heralded the beginning of the end for Armstrong Siddeley, it was because Jaguar had launched the unitary-construction 2.4 saloon in 1955, which was quicker, significantly cheaper, and much better-looking than the 234 and 236.

The last new model produced by Armstrong Siddeley was 1958&#x27;s Star Sapphire, with a 4-litre engine, and automatic transmission. The Armstrong Siddeley was a casualty of the 1960 merger with Bristol; the last car left the Coventry factory in 1960.

====Model list====
Cars produced by Armstrong Siddeley had designations that came from the tax horsepower rating of their engines.



A feature of many of their later cars was the option of an electrically controlled pre-selector gearbox.

====Clubs====

Like many British cars of this era, there are active owners&#x27; clubs supporting their continued use in several countries, e.g. the UK, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Germany. Armstrong Siddeley Owners Club Ltd has members worldwide and many members of the ASCC in Australia are resident overseas.

In the United Kingdom, ASOC publishes a monthly members magazine &quot;Sphinx&quot;. In Australia, the Armstrong Siddeley Car Club publishes &quot;Southern Sphinx&quot; six times a year. In the Netherlands, ASOC Dutch also publishes six times a year, and in New Zealand, Armstrong Siddeley Car Club in New Zealand Inc. publish &quot;Sphinx-NZ&quot; monthly.

===Aircraft engines===

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Armstrong Siddeley produced a range of low- and mid-power aircraft radial engines, all named after big cats. They also produced a tiny 2-cylinder engine called the Ounce, another name for the snow leopard, for ultralight aircraft.

The company started work on their first gas turbine engine in 1939, following the design pioneered at the Royal Aircraft Establishment by Alan Arnold Griffith. Known as the &quot;ASX&quot; for &quot;Armstrong Siddeley eXperimental&quot;, the original pure-turbojet design was later adapted to drive a propeller, resulting in the &quot;ASP&quot;. From then on, AS turbine engines were named after snakes. The Mamba and Double Mamba were turboprop engines, the latter being a complex piece of engineering with two side-by-side Mambas driving through a common gearbox, and could be found on the Fairey Gannet. The Python turboprop powered the Westland Wyvern strike aircraft. Further development of the Mamba removed the reduction gearbox to give the Adder turbojet.

Another pioneer in the production of the RAE engine design was Metrovick, who started with a design known as the Metrovick F.2. This engine never entered production, and Metrovick turned to a larger design, the Beryl, and then to an even larger design, the Sapphire. Armstrong Siddeley later took over the Sapphire design, and it went on to be one of the most successful 2nd generation jet engines, competing with the better-known Rolls-Royce Avon.

The company went on to develop an engine – originally for unmanned Jindivik target drones – called the Viper. This product was further developed by Bristol Siddeley and, later, Rolls-Royce and was sold in great numbers over many years. A range of rocket motors were also produced, including the Snarler and Stentor. The rocket development complemented that of Bristol, and Bristol Siddeley would become the leading British manufacturer of rocket engines for missiles.

===Diesel engines===

In 1946 Armstrong Siddeley produced their first diesel engines. They were medium-speed engines for industrial and agricultural use. Initially there was a single-cylinder engine producing at 900 rpm and a twin-cylinder version. Each cylinder had a capacity of 988 cm3 (60.2 cubic inches). The power output and speed was progressively increased. By the end of 1954 the single-cylinder engine was rated at at 1800 rpm and the twin-cylinder engine at the same speed. In 1955 the range was extended with the introduction of a 3-cylinder engine rated at .

The engines were built at Armstrong Siddeley&#x27;s factory at Walnut Street in Leicester until that factory closed in August 1957. Production was transferred to the factory of Armstrong Siddeley (Brockworth) Ltd in Gloucestershire and in 1958 to the factory of Petters Limited at Staines, Middlesex. The engines built by Petters were designated AS1, AS2 and AS3 to distinguish them from that company&#x27;s other products. Production ended in 1962 when Petters
introduced a replacement range of lightweight small high-speed air-cooled diesel engines.

In April 1958 the company obtained a licence to build the Maybach MD series high-speed diesel engines. Several hundred were built by Bristol Siddeley Engines Ltd after that company took over Armstrong Siddeley&#x27;s manufacturing activities in 1959.

<text>The equivalence principle is the hypothesis that the observed equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass is a consequence of nature. The weak form, known for centuries, relates to masses of any composition in free fall taking the same trajectories and landing at identical times. The extended form by Albert Einstein requires special relativity to also hold in free fall and requires the weak equivalence to be valid everywhere. This form was a critical input for the development of the theory of general relativity. The strong form requires Einstein&#x27;s form to work for stellar objects. Highly precise experimental tests of the principle limit possible deviations from equivalence to be very small.

== Concept ==

In classical mechanics, Newton&#x27;s equation of motion in a gravitational field, written out in full, is:
: inertial mass × acceleration = gravitational mass × gravitational acceleration 
Careful experiments have shown that the inertial mass on the left side and gravitational mass on the right side are numerically equal and independent of the material composing the masses. The equivalence principle is the hypothesis that this numerical equality of inertial and gravitational mass is a consequence of their fundamental identity.

The equivalence principle can be considered an extension of the principle of relativity, the principle that the laws of physics are invariant under uniform motion. An observer in a windowless room cannot distinguish between being on the surface of the Earth and being in a spaceship in deep space accelerating at 1&quot;g&quot; and the laws of physics are unable to distinguish these cases.

== History ==
By experimenting with the acceleration of different materials, Galileo determined that gravitation is independent of the amount of mass being accelerated.

Newton, just 50 years after Galileo, investigated whether gravitational and inertial mass might be different concepts. He compared the periods of pendulums composed of different materials and found them to be identical. From this, he inferred that gravitational and inertial mass are the same thing. The form of this assertion, where the equivalence principle is taken to follow from empirical consistency, later became known as &quot;weak equivalence&quot;.

A version of the equivalence principle consistent with special relativity was introduced by Albert Einstein in 1907, when he observed that identical physical laws are observed in two systems, one subject to a constant gravitational field causing acceleration and the other subject to constant acceleration, like a rocket far from any gravitational field. Since the physical laws are the same, Einstein assumed the gravitational field and the acceleration were &quot;physically equivalent&quot;. Einstein stated this hypothesis by saying he would:

In 1911 Einstein demonstrated the power of the equivalence principle by using it to predict that clocks run at different rates in a gravitational potential, and light rays bend in a gravitational field. He connected the equivalence principle to his earlier principle of special relativity:

Soon after completing work on his theory of gravity (known as general relativity) and then also in later years, Einstein recalled the importance of the equivalence principle to his work:
Einstein&#x27;s development of general relativity necessitated some means of empirically discriminating the theory from other theories of gravity compatible with special relativity. Accordingly, Robert Dicke developed a test program incorporating two new principles – the , and the – each of which assumes the weak equivalence principle as a starting point.

== Definitions ==
Three main forms of the equivalence principle are in current use: weak (Galilean), Einsteinian, and strong. Some proposals also suggest finer divisions or minor alterations.

=== Weak equivalence principle ===

The weak equivalence principle, also known as the universality of free fall or the Galilean equivalence principle can be stated in many ways. The strong equivalence principle, a generalization of the weak equivalence principle, includes astronomic bodies with gravitational self-binding energy. Instead, the weak equivalence principle assumes falling bodies are self-bound by non-gravitational forces only (e.g. a stone). Either way:

* &quot;All uncharged, freely falling test particles follow the same trajectories, once an initial position and velocity have been prescribed&quot;.
* &quot;... in a uniform gravitational field all objects, regardless of their composition, fall with precisely the same acceleration.&quot; &quot;The weak equivalence principle implicitly assumes that the falling objects are bound by non-gravitational forces.&quot;
* &quot;... in a gravitational field the acceleration of a test particle is independent of its properties, including its rest mass.&quot;
* Mass (measured with a balance) and weight (measured with a scale) are locally in identical ratio for all bodies (the opening page to Newton&#x27;s &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;, 1687).

Uniformity of the gravitational field eliminates measurable tidal forces originating from a radial divergent gravitational field (e.g., the Earth) upon finite sized physical bodies.

=== Einstein equivalence principle ===

What is now called the &quot;Einstein equivalence principle&quot; states that the weak equivalence principle holds, and that:

Here &quot;local&quot; means that experimental setup must be small compared to variations in the gravitational field, called tidal forces. The &quot;test&quot; experiment must be small enough so that its gravitational potential does not alter the result.

The two additional constraints added to the weak principle to get the Einstein form − (1) the independence of the outcome on relative velocity (local Lorentz invariance) and (2) independence of &quot;where&quot; (known as local positional invariance) − have far reaching consequences. With these constraints alone Einstein was able to predict the gravitational redshift. Theories of gravity that obey the Einstein equivalence principle must be &quot;metric theories&quot;, meaning that trajectories of freely falling bodies are geodesics of symmetric metric.

Around 1960 Leonard I. Schiff conjectured that any complete and consistent theory of gravity that embodies the weak equivalence principle implies the Einstein equivalence principle; the conjecture can&#x27;t be proven but has several plausibility arguments in its favor. Nonetheless, the two principles are tested with very different kinds of experiments.

The Einstein equivalence principle has been criticized as imprecise, because there is no universally accepted way to distinguish gravitational from non-gravitational experiments (see for instance Hadley and Durand).

=== Strong equivalence principle ===
The strong equivalence principle applies the same constraints as the Einstein equivalence principle, but allows the freely falling bodies to be massive gravitating objects as well as test particles.
Thus this is a version of the equivalence principle that applies to objects that exert a gravitational force on themselves, such as stars, planets, black holes or Cavendish experiments. It requires that the gravitational constant be the same everywhere in the universe and is incompatible with a fifth force. It is much more restrictive than the Einstein equivalence principle.

Like the Einstein equivalence principle, the strong equivalence principle requires gravity to be geometrical by nature, but in addition it forbids any extra fields, so the metric alone determines all of the effects of gravity. If an observer measures a patch of space to be flat, then the strong equivalence principle suggests that it is absolutely equivalent to any other patch of flat space elsewhere in the universe. Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity (including the cosmological constant) is thought to be the only theory of gravity that satisfies the strong equivalence principle. A number of alternative theories, such as Brans–Dicke theory and the Einstein-aether theory add additional fields.

=== Active, passive, and inertial masses ===
Some of the tests of the equivalence principle use names for the different ways mass appears in physical formulae. In nonrelativistic physics three kinds of mass can be distinguished: 
# Inertial mass intrinsic to an object, the sum of all of its mass–energy.
# Passive mass, the response to gravity, the object&#x27;s weight.
# Active mass, the mass that determines the objects gravitational effect.
By definition of active and passive gravitational mass, the force on formula_1 due to the gravitational field of formula_2 is:
formula_3
Likewise the force on a second object of arbitrary mass2 due to the gravitational field of mass0 is:
formula_4

By definition of inertial mass:formula_5if formula_6 and formula_7 are the same distance formula_8 from formula_9 then, by the weak equivalence principle, they fall at the same rate (i.e. their accelerations are the same).
formula_10

Hence:
formula_11

Therefore:
formula_12

In other words, passive gravitational mass must be proportional to inertial mass for objects, independent of their material composition if the weak equivalence principle is obeyed.

The dimensionless &quot;Eötvös-parameter&quot; or &quot;Eötvös ratio&quot; formula_13 is the difference of the ratios of gravitational and inertial masses divided by their average for the two sets of test masses &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.
formula_14
Values of this parameter are used to compare tests of the equivalence principle.

A similar parameter can be used to compare passive and active mass.
By Newton&#x27;s third law of motion:
formula_3
must be equal and opposite to
formula_16

It follows that:
formula_17

In words, passive gravitational mass must be proportional to active gravitational mass for all objects. The difference, 
formula_18
is used to quantify differences between passive and active mass.
== Experimental tests ==
=== Tests of the weak equivalence principle ===
Tests of the weak equivalence principle are those that verify the equivalence of gravitational mass and inertial mass. An obvious test is dropping different objects and verifying that they land at the same time. Historically this was the first approach – though probably not by Galileo&#x27;s Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment but instead earlier by Simon Stevin, who dropped lead balls of different masses off the Delft churchtower and listened for the sound of them hitting a wooden plank.

Isaac Newton measured the period of pendulums made with different materials as an alternative test giving the first precision measurements. Loránd Eötvös&#x27;s approach in 1908 used a very sensitive torsion balance to give precision approaching 1 in a billion. Modern experiments have improved this by another factor of a million.

A popular exposition of this measurement was done on the Moon by David Scott in 1971. He dropped a falcon feather and a hammer at the same time, showing on video that they landed at the same time.

Experiments are still being performed at the University of Washington which have placed limits on the differential acceleration of objects towards the Earth, the Sun and towards dark matter in the Galactic Center. Future satellite experiments – Satellite Test of the Equivalence Principle and Galileo Galilei – will test the weak equivalence principle in space, to much higher accuracy.

With the first successful production of antimatter, in particular anti-hydrogen, a new approach to test the weak equivalence principle has been proposed. Experiments to compare the gravitational behavior of matter and antimatter are currently being developed.

Proposals that may lead to a quantum theory of gravity such as string theory and loop quantum gravity predict violations of the weak equivalence principle because they contain many light scalar fields with long Compton wavelengths, which should generate fifth forces and variation of the fundamental constants. Heuristic arguments suggest that the magnitude of these equivalence principle violations could be in the 10−13 to 10−18 range.

Currently envisioned tests of the weak equivalence principle are approaching a degree of sensitivity such that &quot;non-discovery&quot; of a violation would be just as profound a result as discovery of a violation. Non-discovery of equivalence principle violation in this range would suggest that gravity is so fundamentally different from other forces as to require a major reevaluation of current attempts to unify gravity with the other forces of nature. A positive detection, on the other hand, would provide a major guidepost towards unification.

=== Tests of the Einstein equivalence principle ===
In addition to the tests of the weak equivalence principle, the Einstein equivalence principle requires testing the local Lorentz invariance and local positional invariance conditions.

Testing local Lorentz invariance amounts to testing special relativity, a theory with vast number of existing tests. Nevertheless, attempts to look for quantum gravity require even more precise tests. The modern tests include looking for directional variations in the speed of light (called &quot;clock anisotropy tests&quot;) and new forms of the Michelson–Morley experiment. The anisotropy measures less than one part in 10−20.

Testing local positional invariance divides in to tests in space and in time. Space-based tests use measurements of the gravitational redshift, the classic is the Pound–Rebka experiment in the 1960s. The most precise measurement was done in 1976 by flying a hydrogen maser and comparing it to one on the ground. The Global Positioning System requires compensation for this redshift to give accurate position values.

Time-based tests search for variation of dimensionless constants and mass ratios. For example, Webb et al. reported detection of variation (at the 10−5 level) of the fine-structure constant from measurements of distant quasars. Other researchers dispute these findings.

The present best limits on the variation of the fundamental constants have mainly been set by studying the naturally occurring Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor, where nuclear reactions similar to ones we observe today have been shown to have occurred underground approximately two billion years ago. These reactions are extremely sensitive to the values of the fundamental constants.

=== Tests of the strong equivalence principle ===
The strong equivalence principle can be tested by 1) finding orbital variations in massive bodies (Sun-Earth-Moon), 2) variations in the gravitational constant (&quot;G&quot;) depending on nearby sources of gravity or on motion, or 3) searching for a variation of Newton&#x27;s gravitational constant over the life of the universe

Orbital variations due to gravitational self-energy should cause a &quot;polarization&quot; of solar system orbits called the Nordtvedt effect. This effect has been sensitively tested by Lunar Laser Ranging experiments. Up to the limit of one part in 1013 there is no Nordtvedt effect.

A tight bound on the effect of nearby gravitational fields on the strong equivalence principle comes from modeling the orbits of binary stars and comparing the results to pulsar timing data. In 2014, astronomers discovered a stellar triple system containing a millisecond pulsar PSR J0337+1715 and two white dwarfs orbiting it. The system provided them a chance to test the strong equivalence principle in a strong gravitational field with high accuracy. If there is any departure from the strong equivalence principle, it is no more than two parts per million.

Most alternative theories of gravity predict a change in the gravity constant over time. Studies of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, analysis of pulsars, and the lunar laser ranging data have shown that &quot;G&quot; cannot have varied by more than 10% since the creation of the universe. The best data comes from studies of the ephemeris of Mars, based on three successive NASA missions, Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.
