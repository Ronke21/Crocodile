<text>Calystegia (bindweed, false bindweed, or morning glory) is a genus of about 25 species of flowering plants in the bindweed family Convolvulaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution in temperate and subtropical regions, but with half of the species endemic to California. They are annual or herbaceous perennial twining vines growing 1–5 m tall, with spirally arranged leaves. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, 3–10 cm diameter, white or pink, with (in most species) a sometimes inflated basal epicalyx.

The genus bears much similarity to a related genus &quot;Convolvulus&quot;, and is sometimes combined with it; it is distinguished primarily by the pollen being smooth, and in the ovary being unilocular.

Some of the species, notably &quot;Calystegia sepium&quot; and &quot;C. silvatica&quot;, are problematic weeds, which can swamp other more valuable plants by climbing over them, but some are also deliberately grown for their attractive flowers.

&quot;Calystegia&quot; species are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Bedellia somnulentella&quot; (recorded on &quot;C. sepium&quot;) and small angle shades.

The name is derived from two Greek words &quot;kalyx&quot; or &quot;kalux&quot;, &quot;cup&quot;, and &quot;stege&quot;, &quot;a covering&quot;, meaning &quot;a covering cup&quot;, this refers to the large bracts that cover the sepals.

<doc id="864869" wikidata="Q1043401" url="?curid=864869" title="Green-cheeked parakeet">
<text>The green-cheeked parakeet (Pyrrhura molinae), also sometimes known as the green-cheeked conure in aviculture, is a species of bird in subfamily Arinae of the family Psittacidae, the African and New World parrots. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The green-cheeked parakeet has six subspecies:

*&quot;P. m. flavoptera&quot; 
*&quot;P. m. molinae&quot; 
*&quot;P. m. phoenicura&quot; 
*&quot;P. m. hypoxantha&quot; 
*&quot;P. m. restricta&quot; 
*&quot;P. m. australis&quot; 
Subspecies &quot;P. m. hypoxantha&quot; was previously known as &quot;P. m. sordida&quot; and was sometimes treated as a separate species. However, by the principle of priority the older name &quot;hypoxantha&quot; replaced &quot;sordida&quot;. The green-cheeked parakeet has also been treated as conspecific with the maroon-bellied parakeet (&quot;P. frontalis&quot;).

The green-cheeked parakeet is most closely related to the maroon-bellied, pearly (&quot;P. lepida&quot;), and crimson-bellied (&quot;P. perlata&quot;) parakeets.

==Description==

The green-cheeked parakeet is long and weighs . The sexes are the same sizes. Adults of the nominate subspecies &quot;P. m. molinae&quot; are dull brown from forehead to nape and have green cheeks, ashy brown ear coverts, and a creamy white ring of bare skin around the eye. Their upperparts are green. Their chin, throat, and the sides of their neck are a scaly brown and whitish. Their belly is dull reddish and their lower flanks and vent area are green. Their wing is mostly green, with bluish flight feathers. Their tail is dull reddish. Immatures are similar to adults but without the red belly.

Subspecies &quot;P. m. phoenicura&quot; is green on the upper surface of its tail&#x27;s base. &quot;P. m. restricta&quot; has a blue collar, a blue tinge on its cheeks, and a smaller red belly patch than the nominate. &quot;P. m. hypoxantha&quot; has a paler crown and less distinct scaling on the breast than the nominate. &quot;P. m. australis&quot; is paler than the nominate and has a larger red belly patch. &quot;P. m. flavoptera&quot; is orange to red at the bend of the wing and on the carpal edge and is otherwise like the nominate.

A small number of individuals of &quot;P. m. hypoxantha&quot; have mostly yellow underparts.

==Distribution and habitat==

The subspecies of the green-cheeked parakeet are found thus:

*&quot;P. m. flavoptera&quot;, west-central Bolivia in southeastern La Paz and northwestern Cochabamba departments
*&quot;P. m. molinae&quot;, Bolivia between La Paz and Chuquisaca departments
*&quot;P. m. phoenicura&quot;, northeastern Santa Cruz Department in northeastern Bolivia and southwestern Mato Grosso in Brazil
*&quot;P. m. hypoxantha&quot;, eastern Santa Cruz Department in extreme eastern Bolivia, western Mato Grosso do Sul in southwestern Brazil, and northern Paraguay
*&quot;P. m. restricta&quot;, central Santa Cruz Department in east-central Bolivia
*&quot;P. m. australis&quot;, from southern Bolivia&#x27;s Tarija Department into northwestern Argentina as far as Tucumán Province

The green-cheeked parakeet inhabits lowland woodlands and forest (chiefly deciduous), secondary forest, and gallery forest in the lower elevations of the Pantanal and humid subtropical forest as high as .

==Behavior==
===Movement===

The populations of green-cheeked parakeet breeding in higher elevations move to lower ones in winter.

===Feeding===

The green-cheeked parakeet has a varied diet that, in the wild, consists of fruits, seeds, flowers and, to a lesser extent, nectar and leaves.

===Breeding===

The green-cheeked parakeet&#x27;s breeding season in Argentina includes February, but its season elsewhere has not been defined. It nests in tree cavities. In captivity the clutch size is four to six eggs, the incubation period is 22 to 25 days, both sexes incubate the clutch, and fledging occurs about seven weeks after hatch.

===Vocalization===

The green-cheeked parakeet&#x27;s flight calls &quot;comprise rather high-pitched notes with a grating quality and usually given in fast series, e.g. &quot;krree krree krree&quot;, but also single &quot;kuree&quot; notes.&quot; From a perch it &quot;utters high-pitched, more melodious notes, such as a bisyllabic &quot;rrekeet&quot; or &quot;keew&quot;.&quot; However, perched birds are often silent. Flocks in flight &quot;call frequently and simultaneously, producing a noisy, harsh and piercing chattering.&quot;

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the green-cheeked parakeet as being of Least Concern. It has a fairly large range but its population size is not known and is believed to be decreasing. No immediate threats have been identified. It is considered common in much of its range.

==In aviculture==
Green-cheeked parakeets are common in aviculture and are popular companion parrots. They are playful, affectionate and intelligent, known as having a &quot;big personality in a small body&quot;. They can learn to talk, albeit with a limited vocabulary and a gravelly voice. They like to be held (although some like it more than others) and can learn tricks such as lying on their backs, &quot;kissing&quot;, shaking, hanging upside down, minor tool use, and even can be potty trained. Green-cheeked parrots are not very loud at most times, so even an apartment dweller can enjoy their companionship. They are the quietest of the conures and can learn tricks and have a limited vocabulary, with extensive training. They can be prone to biting, particularly when young, but an owner can cure this behavior with patience and time.

When cared for properly, captive green-cheeked parakeets can live 25–30 years. However, their average lifespan in captivity is closer to 10 years, due to frequent neglect and/or an incorrect diet.

===Color variations===

In addition to the natural color forms, color varieties have been selectively bred in aviculture:
* &quot;Cinnamon&quot; are lime green and have a lighter, paler coloring. The head is tan and the tail feathers are a lighter maroon compared to normal green-cheeked parakeets.
* &quot;Yellow-sided&quot; have bright-colored breasts that graduate from red to yellow and dark gray heads. Rarely, they also possess a bright yellow feather on each side of the upper wing. This is a rare recessive character of which only one hatchling in approximately 10 clutches can be found to have. This feature often increases their value.
* &quot;Pineapple&quot; are a combination of the cinnamon and yellow-sided variations. They have a breast of bright colors, a tan head and lime green feathers on the back like a cinnamon green-cheeked parrot. The tail feathers are the same as a yellow-sided, providing a halo effect.
* &quot;Turquoise&quot; have a body with some blue-green and green feathers. The end of the wing feathers have a highly iridescent quality if left unclipped. The breast feathers are grayish and the tail feathers are gray.
* Green/red/blue apple varieties are less common, but have been seen.

<doc id="864875" wikidata="Q725390" url="?curid=864875" title="Oscar Gustave Rejlander">
<text>Oscar Gustave Rejlander (Stockholm, 19 October 1813 – Clapham, London, 18 January 1875) was a pioneering Victorian art photographer and an expert in photomontage. His collaboration with Charles Darwin on &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot; has assured him a position in the history of behavioural science and psychiatry.

== Biography ==

According to his naturalisation papers, Rejlander was born in Stockholm on 19 October 1813. He was the son of Carl Gustaf Rejlander, a stonemason and Swedish Army Officer. During his youth, his family moved to the Swedish-speaking community in Rauma, Grand Duchy of Finland (then part of Russia). In the 1830s, he relocated to England, initially settling in Lincoln, England. In the 1850s he abandoned his original profession as a painter and portrait miniaturist, apparently after seeing how well a photograph captured the fold of a sleeve.

He set up as a portraitist in the industrial Midlands town of Wolverhampton, probably around 1846. In the early 1850s he learned the wet-collodion and waxed-paper processes at great speed with Nicholas Henneman in London, and then changed his business to that of a photography studio. He undertook genre work and portraiture. Rejlander also produced nude studies, mainly for use as studies by painters, and later revealed that his early work was made with the aid of a local troupe of theatrical performers.
Rejlander undertook many experiments to perfect his photography, including combination printing, which he did not invent; however, he created more elaborate and convincing composite photographs than any prior photographer. He had articles feature in the &quot;Wolverhampton Chronicle&quot; newspaper, on 15 November 1854 an article called &quot;Improvement in Calotypes, by Mr. O.G. Rejlander, of Wolverhampton&quot; it suggests that by 1854 he was experimenting with combination printing from several negatives. He was a friend of photographer Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (better known by the pen name Lewis Carroll), who collected Rejlander&#x27;s work and corresponded with him on technical matters. Rejlander later created one of the best known and most revealing portraits of Dodgson. Like Dodgson, Rejlander&#x27;s work included many pictures of &quot;undraped&quot; children:

:&quot;The remarks of his contemporaries bear witness to both his attainments and to the influence which he exercised. Some of his critics were exuberant. Thus one speaks of his undraped children as being as &#x27;beautiful as those of Della Robbia, Flamingo, and Raphael.&#x27; Mr. H. Robinson, the immediate successor to Rejlander, who was also for many years a rival in seeking public applause for genre photography, calls the foregoing &#x27;wonderful pictures of nude children.&#x27;&quot;
Rejlander participated in the Paris Exhibition of 1855. In 1856 he made his best-known allegorical work, &quot;The Two Ways of Life&quot;. This was a seamlessly montaged combination print made of thirty-two images (akin to the use of Photoshop today, but then far more difficult to achieve) in about six weeks. First exhibited at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, the work shows a man being lured to paths of vice or virtue by good and bad angels. The image&#x27;s partial nudity, which showed real women as they actually appeared and not the idealised forms then common in Victorian art, was deemed &#x27;indecent&#x27; by some. Rejlander was also accused of using prostitutes as models, although Rejlander categorically denied this and no proof was ever offered. Reservations about the work subsided when Queen Victoria ordered a 10-guinea copy to give to Prince Albert. Victoria and Albert would go on to purchase three copies of the work, all of which are now lost.

Despite this royal patronage, controversy about &quot;The Two Ways of Life&quot; in Scotland in 1858 led to a secession of a large group from the Photographic Society of Scotland, the secessionists founding the Edinburgh Photographic Society in 1861. They objected to the picture being shown with one half of it concealed by drapes. The picture was also shown at the Birmingham Photographic Society with no such furor or censorship. However the Photographic Society of Scotland later made amends and invited Rejlander to a grand dinner in his honour in 1866, held to open an exhibition that included many of his pictures.

Rejlander moved his studio to Malden Road, London around 1862 and largely abandoned his early experiments with double exposure, photomontage, photographic manipulation and retouching. Instead, he became one of Britain&#x27;s leading portraitists, creating pictures with psychological charge. He became a leading expert in photographic techniques, lecturing and publishing widely, and sold work through bookshops and art dealers. He also found subject-matter in London, photographing homeless London street children to produce popular &#x27;social-protest&#x27; pictures such as &quot;Poor Joe&quot;, also known as &quot;Homeless&quot;.

Charles Lutwidge Dodgson visited Rejlander&#x27;s Malden Road studio in 1863. Carroll was in the process of relocating his studio and sought Rejlander&#x27;s advice regarding its design. Around 1863 Rejlander visited the Isle of Wight at the request of Julia Margaret Cameron and helped teach her photography.

Some of Rejlander&#x27;s images were purchased as drawing-aids by Victorian painters of repute, such as Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema. In 1871 he contributed photographs to Darwin&#x27;s classic treatise on &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Rejlander married Mary Bull in 1862, who was twenty-four years his junior. Mary had been his photographic model in Wolverhampton.

Rejlander became seriously ill from about 1874. He died in 1875 with several claims on his estate, and costly funeral expenses. The Edinburgh Photographic Society raised money for his widow on Rejlander&#x27;s death, and helped set up the Rejlander Memorial Fund. His grave is in Kensal Green Cemetery, and a new stone was placed there in 2012.

== Collections ==
Rejlander&#x27;s work is held in the permanent collections of many institutions worldwide, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Harvard Art Museums, the Clark Art Institute, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the Princeton University Art Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts St. Petersburg, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the National Media Museum, Bradford, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.

<doc id="864884" wikidata="Q1339143" url="?curid=864884" title="Empangeni">
<text>Empangeni is a town in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It is approximately 157 kilometres north of Durban, in hilly countryside, overlooking a flat coastal plain and the major harbour town of Richards Bay 16 kilometres away. The N2 freeway runs east from Empangeni intersecting John Ross Highway (R34) which connects Empangeni and Richards Bay.

The climate is sub-tropical with an average temperature of 28.4 °C in summer and 14.5 °C in Winter. The town is said, by local residents, to not have a real winter, as temperatures are seldom very low.

==History==
===Humble beginnings===
In 1851, the Norwegian Missionary Society established a mission station on the banks of the eMpangeni river. The river was named after the profusion of Mpange trees (&quot;Trema guineensis&quot;) growing along its banks. The mission was later moved to Eshowe, 61 kilometres north-west. In 1894 a magistracy was established. The Zululand Railway reached the town in January 1903 and linked the area to Durban and Eshowe. The government planted eucalyptus trees in 1905 as part of an experimental timber plantation. The plantation was a success and led to large scale planting along the coastal belt. In 1906 Empangeni became a village. Rapid expansion began when a sugar mill was erected at Felixton. The establishment of the Empangeni Sugar Mill set the area on the road to rapid development. Empangeni was officially proclaimed as a township on 15 January 1931 and declared a borough on 13 October 1960. 

===The reign of the Hammerman===
A small town, Empangeni made the headlines in the early 1980s for a very unfortunate reason. Serial killer Simon Mpungose was terrorising the citizens of Empangeni during his spree of violent murders. The 35-year-old Mpungose was given the name ‘Hammerman’ because he would break into homes in the dead of night and kill the occupants with a hammer before robbing them of their possessions. When he was brought to trial in November 1984, shortly after his arrest that same year, the Empangeni court was told that Mpungose attacked many other people during violent robberies, but never touched the children of his victims. During the trial Mpungose stated that he wanted to die as he had a hard life, complicated by the actions of people who did not understand his plight.

He sentenced him to hang, whereupon Mpungose threw his blue tracksuit into the public gallery, shouted, and threatened to expose his penis to the court before he was restrained with handcuffs. He was hanged a year later on Friday, 29 November 1985 in Pretoria.

===The Riots of 2021===
Empangeni was one of the town severely damaged during the riots and subsequent looting that broke out in parts of South Africa in July 2021. Many businesses did not reopen following the carnage. By 2024, most of the CBD has been repaired and rebuilt. Sanlam Centre which is a large shopping centre in the Empangeni CBD went through an extensive renovations in response to the damage caused by the riots and installed a fence along the perimeter of the centre&#x27;s parking lot incase of future events similar to the 2021 riots.

<doc id="864885" wikidata="Q1124975" url="?curid=864885" title="Richard Evans Schultes">
<text>Richard Evans Schultes (&quot;SHULL-tees&quot;; January 12, 1915 – April 10, 2001) was an American biologist, considered to be the father of modern ethnobotany. He is known for his studies of the uses of plants by indigenous peoples, especially the indigenous peoples of the Americas. He worked on entheogenic or hallucinogenic plants, particularly in Mexico and the Amazon, involving lifelong collaborations with chemists. He had charismatic influence as an educator at Harvard University; several of his students and colleagues went on to write popular books and assume influential positions in museums, botanical gardens, and popular culture.

His book &quot;The Plants of the Gods: Their Sacred, Healing, and Hallucinogenic Powers&quot; (1979), co-authored with chemist Albert Hofmann, the discoverer of LSD, is considered his greatest popular work: it has never been out of print and was revised into an expanded second edition, based on a German translation by Christian Rätsch (1998), in 2001.

==Early life and education==
Schultes was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 12, 1915. The son of a plumber, he grew up and was educated in East Boston. His interest in South America&#x27;s rain forests traced back to his childhood: while he was bedridden, his parents read him excerpts of &quot;Notes of a Botanist on the Amazon and the Andes,&quot; by the 19th-century English botanist Richard Spruce. He received a full scholarship to Harvard.

In 1933, Schultes entered Harvard University, where he planned to pursue medicine. However, that changed after he took Biology 104, &quot;Plants and Human Affairs,&quot; taught by orchidologist and Director of the Harvard Botanical Museum Oakes Ames. Ames became a mentor, and Schultes became an assistant in the Botanical Museum; his undergraduate senior thesis studied the ritual use of peyote cactus among the Kiowa of Oklahoma, obtaining a degree in biology in 1937. 

Continuing at Harvard under Ames, he completed his Master of Arts in biology in 1938 and his Ph.D. in botany in 1941. Schultes&#x27; doctoral thesis investigated the lost identity of the Mexican hallucinogenic plants teonanácatl mushrooms belonging to the genus &quot;Psilocybe&quot;, and ololiuqui, a morning glory species, in Oaxaca, Mexico. He received a fellowship from the National Research Council to study the plants used to make curare.

==Career==
The entry of the United States into World War II in 1941 saw Schultes diverted to the search for wild disease-resistant &quot;Hevea&quot; rubber species in an effort to free the U.S. from dependence on Southeast Asia&#x27;s rubber plantations which had become unavailable owing to Japanese occupation. 

In early 1942, as a field agent for the governmental Rubber Development Corporation, Schultes began work on rubber and concurrently undertook research on Amazonian ethnobotany, under a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship.

Schultes&#x27; botanical field-work among aboriginal American communities led him to be one of the first to alert the world about destruction of the Amazon rain-forest and the disappearance of its native people. He collected over thirty thousand herbarium specimens (including three hundred species new to Western science) and published numerous ethnobotanical discoveries including the source of the dart poison known as curare, now commonly employed as a muscle relaxant during surgery. He was the first non-native individual to academically examine ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic brew made out of &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot; vine in combination with various plants; of which he identified &quot;Psychotria viridis&quot; (Chacruna) and &quot;Diplopterys cabrerana&quot; (Chaliponga), both of which contained a potent short-acting hallucinogen, N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT). In his travels he lived with the indigenous peoples and viewed them with respect and felt that tribal chiefs were gentlemen; he understood the languages of the Witoto and Makuna peoples. He encountered dangers in his travels, including hunger, beriberi, repeated bouts of malaria, and near drowning.

Schultes became curator of Harvard&#x27;s Oakes Ames Orchid Herbarium in 1953, curator of Economic Botany in 1958, and professor of biology in 1970. His ever-popular undergraduate course on economic botany was noted for his Victorian demeanor, lectures delivered in a white lab coat, insistence on memorization of systematic botanical names, films depicting native ritual use of plant inebriants, blowgun demonstrations, and hands-on labs (using plant sources of grain, paper, caffeine, dyes, medicines, and tropical fruits). His composed and kindly persona and expressive eye gestures helped capture the imagination of the many students he inspired.

In 1959, Schultes married Dorothy Crawford McNeil, an opera soprano who performed in Europe and the United States. They had three children, Richard Evans Schultes II, and twins Alexandra Ames Schultes Wilson and Neil Parker Schultes. Schultes retired from Harvard in 1985. He was a member of King&#x27;s Chapel church in Boston. Despite his Germanic surname he was an anglophile. He would often vote for the Queen of the United Kingdom during presidential elections because he didn&#x27;t support the American Revolution.

==Influences==

Schultes was led to study psychoactive drugs by Heinrich Kluver, a leading scholar of this subject (personal communication from Schultes). This interest evolved by way of Schultes&#x27; field observations on peyote, studying the peyote cult among the Plains Indians in his travels with Weston LaBarre in the early 1930s (in 1938, LaBarre based &quot;The Peyote Cult&quot; on these travels and observations).

In Western culture, Schultes&#x27; discoveries influenced writers who considered hallucinogens as the gateways to self-discovery, such as Aldous Huxley, William Burroughs and Carlos Castaneda. Although he contributed to the psychedelic era with his discoveries, he personally disdained its proponents, dismissing drug guru and fellow Harvard professor Timothy Leary for being so little versed in hallucinogenic species that he misspelled the Latin names of the plants. When Burroughs described his ayahuasca visions as an earth-shaking metaphysical experience, Schultes famously replied, &quot;That&#x27;s funny, Bill, all I saw was colors.&quot;

Schultes&#x27; personal hero was Richard Spruce, a British naturalist who spent seventeen years exploring the Amazon rainforest.

Schultes, in both his life and his work, has directly influenced notable people as diverse as biologist E.O. Wilson, physician Andrew Weil, psychologist Daniel Goleman, poet Allen Ginsberg, ethnobotanist, conservationist and author Mark Plotkin, and authors Alejo Carpentier, Mary Mackey, and William S. Burroughs. Timothy Plowman, authority on the genus &quot;Erythroxylum&quot; (coca) and ethnobotanist, and Wade Davis were his students at Harvard.

==Distinctions==
Schultes received numerous awards and decorations including:

* Gold Medal from the Linnean Society of London (1992), the most prestigious prize in botany;
* Gold Medal from the World Wildlife Fund;
* Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1988);
* Boyaca Cross (Cruz de Boyacá) 1986, highest award from the government of the Republic Of Colombia.

Schultes is one of the leading characters in the prestigious Colombian film &quot;El abrazo de la serpiente&quot; (&quot;Embrace of the Serpent&quot;) (2015), directed by Ciro Guerra and critically acclaimed. The film depicts Schultes&#x27; search for a mysterious plant through the Amazon jungle, and he was played by actor Brionne Davis. The film specifically credits both his diaries and those accounts of an earlier Amazonian explorer, the German scientist Theodor Koch-Grünberg.

In 1962, botanist Harold E. Moore published &quot;Resia&quot;, which is a genus of flowering plants from South America, in the family Gesneriaceae and named in his honour. Then in 1977, botanist Hunz. published &quot;Schultesianthus&quot; which is also a genus of flowering plants from South America, but belonging to the family Solanaceae and also named in Moore&#x27;s honour.

<text>This article gives information on liberalism worldwide. It is an overview of parties that adhere to some form of liberalism and is therefore a list of liberal parties around the world.

==Introduction==
What constitutes a liberal party is highly debatable. In the list below, it is defined as a political party that adheres to the basic principles of political liberalism. This is a broad political current, including left-wing, centrist and right-wing elements. All liberal parties emphasise individual rights, but they differ in their opinion on an active role for the state. This list includes parties of different character, ranging from classical liberalism to social liberalism, conservative liberalism to national liberalism.

Several conservative and/or Christian-democratic parties, such as the British Conservative Party, Germany&#x27;s Christian Democratic Union and Spain&#x27;s People&#x27;s Party, are also considered to be neoliberal leaning or have strong liberal conservative and/or classical liberal factions, whereas some conservative parties, such as Poland&#x27;s Law and Justice and Hungary&#x27;s Fidesz, while favour more state intervention also support free market/free market solutions. Conversely, some social-democratic parties, such as the British Labour Party and the Italian Democratic Party, include liberal elements. Social liberalism and social conservatism are not mutually exclusive either, in fact some parties espouse socially liberal economic policies, while maintaining more socially conservative or traditionalist views on society: examples of this include Finland&#x27;s Centre Party (see also Nordic agrarian parties) and Ireland&#x27;s Fianna Fáil, both members of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party (ALDE Party). In the United States, the two major political forces, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, are to some extent, liberal (see Liberalism in the United States and Modern liberalism in the United States).

Many liberal parties are members of the Liberal International and/or one of its regional partners, such as the ALDE Party in Europe, the Liberal Network for Latin America and the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats. Generally, membership in these international organizations is an indication that that party is indeed liberal. However, other international organisations, such as the International Democrat Union and the Centrist Democrat International, and regional organisations, such as the European People&#x27;s Party, the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists, the European Democratic Party and the Christian Democrat Organization of America, also have liberal or liberal leaning parties as significant proportions of their membership.

Not all the parties using the &quot;Liberal&quot; or &quot;Freedom&quot; labels are actually liberal. Moreover, some parties, such as the Freedom Party of Austria, were originally liberal, but have since tilted toward a populist direction and abandoned most of the tenets of liberalism. Finally, some parties, such as the United States Republican Party, Australia&#x27;s Liberal Party or Norway&#x27;s Progress Party are liberal mainly from an economic point of view rather than a social point of view (see economic liberalism, libertarianism and right-libertarianism).

==International organizations of parties==
* Liberal International
* Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party
* Liberal Network for Latin America
* Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats
* Africa Liberal Network
* Arab Liberal Federation

==Parliamentary parties and other parties with substantial support==
:&quot;This list includes also parties that were represented in the last previous legislature and still exists as well as some banned or exiles parties (Cuba). Liberals might be active in other parties, but that is no reason to include a party.&quot;
:&quot;See the remarks above about the criteria. Minor parties are listed below&quot;

===Africa===
Liberalism is a relatively new current for Africa. Traditionally it only existed more or less in Egypt, Senegal and especially South Africa.
* : There are very few liberal political parties. Ahd 54 and the Algerian Natural Law Party may be considered liberal. The main Berber party, the Rally for Culture and Democracy () could be considered to embrace some liberal values.
* : the Liberal Democratic Party (, member LI) is a small liberal party.
* : the Rebirth Party of Benin (), might be considered a liberal party, but its exact profile is not available. The Cowry Forces for an Emerging Benin () are a centrist party alliance with liberal elements.
* : the Alliance for Democracy and Federation (), might be considered a liberal party, but its exact profile is not available.
* : the Movement for Democracy (, member CDI), is a liberal and Christian-democratic party
*: the Future of Congo (&quot;French: Avenir du Congo&quot;) is a liberal party of the current Prime Minister
* : the Free Egyptians Party (Hizb El Masriyin El Ahrar) and the New Wafd Party (Hizb al-Wafd-al-Jadid) could be considered &quot;liberal parties&quot;. The newest liberal party in Egypt is El-Ghad Party (Tomorrow&#x27;s Party) led by the opposition leader Ayman Nour . Also, the newly established Free Egyptians Party. &quot;See for more information: Liberalism in Egypt&quot;.
* : the National Democratic Union of Equatorial Guinea (, member LI) claims to be a liberal party.
* : the United Democratic Party, might be considered a liberal party, but its exact profile is not available.
* : the New Patriotic Party is a right of center liberal party that is unclear about its international affiliations.
* : the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (, member LI, ALN) and the Union of Republican Forces (, member LI, ALN) are the main opposition parties.
* : the Rally of the Republicans (, member LI, CDI) is the liberal, main government party.
* : the Orange Democratic Movement (observer LI) might be considered a liberal party.
* : the liberal character of the United Democratic Front is despite its membership of the LI disputable. The Democratic Progressive Party was formed in 2005 by President Bingu wa Mutharika after a dispute with the UDF. There were allegations that members of the former governing UDF did not adequately tackle corruption. It is unclear if the party will be ideological or personalist in style.
* : two center-right parties, the Constitutional Union () and the Popular Movement () are both member of the LI. However both are conservative in social issues, something abnormal for a true liberal party. The National Rally of Independents (observer LI, member ALN), founded in 1978 as a royalist party, is nowadays a liberal party.
* : the Liberal and Democratic Party of Mozambique () and the Social Liberal and Democratic Party () claim to be liberal parties, but both lost parliamentary representation.
* : the Senegalese Democratic Party (, member LI) is a liberal party with a strong personalist character. &quot;See for more information: Liberalism in Senegal. &quot;
* : the Seychelles National Party (observer LI) is a liberal party.
* : the People&#x27;s Movement for Democratic Change (member ALN, observer DUA) can be considered as a liberal party. It is the country&#x27;s third largest party but lost parliamentary representation in 2012.
* : the Democratic Alliance (member LI) is a liberal party. &quot;See for more information: Liberalism in South Africa. &quot;
* : the Liberal Party of Sudan (member ALN, AAFD) is a social-liberal party struggling for human rights and a social market economy.
* : the Civic United Front (), member LI) and the United Democratic Party, observer LI are liberal parties.
* : the Social Liberal Party (, observer LI) is a more or less liberal party.
* : the main opposition party, the United Party for National Development (observer LI) takes a liberal position in the political spectrum.
* : liberalism is not organized, but the left-leaning opposition Movement for Democratic Change includes liberals and social democrats opposed to the ruling ZANU–PF party.

===The Americas===
In many Latin American countries, liberalism and radicalism have been associated with generally left-of-center political movements such as Colombia&#x27;s Liberal Party, historically concerned mostly with effecting government decentralization and regional autonomy (liberals were influential in the total dissolution of at least two defunct countries, the United Provinces of Central America and Gran Colombia) and separation of church and state. At times, the anti-clerical and secularist stances promoted by Latin American liberals have resulted in limitations on the civil rights of clergy or others associated with the Church (as in Mexico, where law still prohibits priests from public office). Liberalism in North America has a different background.
* : the Radical Civic Union historically was a centrist progressive-liberal party, while nowadays it adheres to the Socialist International and its platform is a combination of liberal and social democratic ideas. The UCR&#x27;s long-time rivals have been Peronism and the Peronist-inspired Justicialist Party. Recreate for Growth had been a short lived attempt to form a market liberal party and has observer status in the Liberal International. This party was in alliance with conservative-liberal Republican Proposal. Also smaller parties, such as the Union of the Democratic Centre, the Progressive Democratic Party, the Liberal Party of Corrientes and the Democratic Party of Mendoza, adhere to conservative-liberal principles. On the libertarian side, stands the Liberal Libertarian Party (dissolved) and the Libertarian Party (now) whose focus is on free markets and individual rights.
* : the character of the Aruban Liberal Organization (Organisacion Liberal Arubiano) is not clear. The party lost parliamentary representation in the 2005 election.
* : the dominant party is the left of center liberal Progressive Liberal Party.
* : the Liberal Party was dominant until 1952. &quot;(Main article: Liberalism in Bolivia).&quot;
* : Liberalism (in a general, international acceptance) is represented only by the New Party (). There are no mainstream parties currently holding unambiguous liberal principles nor any members of the Liberal International. While at least three parties label themselves as &quot;liberal&quot;, the Liberal Front Party (Partido da Frente Liberal), actually renamed Brazil Union () in 2022, is a populist-conservative party.

* : the primary use of the term &quot;liberal&quot; is at some variance with European and worldwide usage. In the United States today, it is most associated with the definition of modern liberalism, which is a combination of social liberalism, public welfare and a mixed economy, which is in contrast to classical liberalism. In the Third Party System, the primary liberal groups (which by that point still meant classical liberal) were the Bourbon Democrats and the Liberal Republicans, the latter of which evolved into the Mugwumps; they both supported free trade and free markets, and opposed political corruption. By 1884, both groups had come to support the Democratic Party under the leadership of the liberal Bourbon Grover Cleveland. However, when William Jennings Bryan took over the Democratic Party, there was a substantial move towards populism and progressivism; the last hurrah of the Bourbons was the nomination of Alton Parker in 1904. Despite this, most Democrats, including Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, continued to call themselves liberals, framing social liberal ideas as positive liberties, in contrast to the negative liberties that can only be avoided through a lack of government intervention. Starting in the 1980s, the conservatives and modern liberals began to adopt more classically-liberal economic perspectives through fusionism and the Third Way respectively. Today, the Democratic Party is sometimes identified as the liberal party within the broader definition of liberalism thus putting it in contrast with most other parties listed here. Democrats advocate for more social freedoms, affirmative action, and a mixed economy (and therefore modern liberalism). The Republican Party experiences a somewhat fractured economic viewpoint with some members supporting strong free-market and libertarian views (and therefore economic liberalism) and others championing pro-business and economic nationalist stances, though both sectors typically mix their fiscal views with strong aspects of social conservatism. The Libertarian Party is the third largest political party in the United States, (though still only getting 1–2% of the vote in congressional elections), and particularly centers itself on free markets and individual liberty, which is more in line with classical liberalism. &quot;(Main article: Liberalism in the United States and Modern liberalism in the United States)&quot;

The Liberal Party was re-founded in 1989 and has several councillors in Britain, but no parliamentary representation.
** : the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland (member LI, ALDE) was formed in 1970 as a non-ideological cross-community party. &quot;(Main article Liberalism in the United Kingdom)&quot;

===Oceania===
Liberalism has a strong tradition in both Australia and New Zealand.
* : the Liberal Party of Australia is considered to be centre-right, and largely the bastion of liberalism in Australia. Within the Liberal Party, there is a fusion of liberal and conservative views, a tradition which began by the party&#x27;s predecessors in the early 20th century. The fusion has led to the party having a big tent membership, bound by an anti-Labor position. Many would argue that this party is a classical liberal party and that the perception of what liberalism is has changed, not the Liberal Party (which promotes the free market approach). Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a member of the Liberal Party, said that his party is &quot;not a conservative party&quot;. The term &quot;small-l liberal&quot; generally refers to someone who champions civil liberties and progressive causes such as reconciliation with Indigenous Australians. These views are represented strongly within the broad Liberal Party, as well as in parties such as the Australian Democrats, which began its life as a group of social-liberals disaffected with the Liberal Party. The Libertarian Party is a classical liberal and libertarian party. &quot;(Main article: Liberalism in Australia).&quot;
* : the liberal Democratic Party is one of the two major parties opposing the nationalist Cook Islands Party.
* : the People&#x27;s Alliance, FijiFirst and the Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA) are all liberal parties. FijiFirst is centrist while the People&#x27;s Alliance and SODELPA are centre-right.
* : there is no longer a pure liberal party, as in the past the Liberal Party was the first organised political party, and the Liberal Government from 1891 to 1912 was responsible for many reforms. Similarly to Australia, this party merged with more conservative and free market forces to form the National Party of New Zealand, in order to oppose the advancement of the democratic socialist New Zealand Labour Party. &quot;Liberalism&quot; nowadays refers to a support for individual liberties and limited government. The term is generally used with a reference to a particular policy area, e.g. &quot;market liberalism&quot; or &quot;social liberalism&quot;. Unqualified liberalism is less common; in its extreme form it is known by the American term &quot;libertarianism&quot;. The left of centre New Zealand Democratic Party took a more or less progressive liberal position in the spectrum, but lost popular support. ACT New Zealand is a classical liberal or libertarian party. &quot;(Main article: Liberalism in New Zealand).&quot;
* : the Solomon Islands Liberal Party considered itself a liberal party.

<doc id="864921" wikidata="Q1406758" url="?curid=864921" title="Finial">
<text>A finial (from &#x27;, end) orhip-knob is an element marking the top or end of some object, often formed to be a decorative feature.

In architecture, it is a small decorative device, employed to emphasize the apex of a dome, spire, tower, roof, or gable or any of various distinctive ornaments at the top, end, or corner of a building or structure. A finial is typically carved in stone. Where there are several such elements they may be called pinnacles. The very top of a finial can be a floral or foliated element called a bouquet.

Smaller finials in materials such as metal or wood are used as a decorative ornament on the tops or ends of poles or rods such as tent-poles or curtain rods or any object such as a piece of furniture. These are frequently seen on top of bed posts or clocks. Decorative finials are also commonly used to fasten lampshades, and as an ornamental element at the end of the handles of souvenir spoons. The charm at the end of a pull chain (such as for a ceiling fan or a lamp) is also known as a finial.

== In architecture ==

=== On roofs ===
Decorative roof-finials are a common feature of Malaysian religious and residential architecture. In Malacca, Malaysia, there are 38 mosques with traditional roof finials, with layered and crown-shaped designs, which are known as &quot;Makhota Atap Masjid&quot;. On mosques built after the 20th century, these finials have been replaced by &quot;bulbous domes&quot;. Other terms for roof finials include: &quot;Tunjuk Langit&quot; and &quot;Buah Buton&quot; (East Coast) as well as &quot;Buah Gutung&quot; (Kelantan and Terengganu). The &quot;Makhota Atap Masjid&quot; finials are made of mixed concrete, and the &quot;Buah Buton&quot; are made of wood.

In Japanese architecture, &quot;chigi&quot; are finials that were used atop Shinto shrines in Ise and Izumo and the imperial palace.

In Java and Bali, a rooftop finial is known as &quot;mustaka&quot; or &quot;kemuncak&quot;.

In Thailand finials feature on domestic and religious buildings. Hti is a kind of finial found on Burmese Buddhist temples and pagodas. On Buddhist stupas, the layered umbrella (Skt. &quot;chhatra&quot;; Pali: &quot;chhatta&quot;) tiers have cosmological significance as representing the realms of heavens or the trunk of a cosmic tree. Even the stupa itself (comparatively smaller) can be a finial to a Stupa or other Buddhist religious structure.

The kalasha is a finial on Hindu temples. In the Dravidian style of temple architecture, the kalasha is placed on top of a dome with an inverted lotus flower shape in between. There may also be lotus petals at the top, before the kalasha narrows to a single point, or bindu.

There are two guldastas, or finials, per facade at Humayun&#x27;s Tomb. 

Finials are decorative elements in a variety of American domestic architectural styles, including French colonial, Georgian, Victorian, and Romanesque Revival.

Roof finials can be made from a variety of materials including clay, metal, or wood.

A folklore tradition in the eastern United States portrays finials as discouraging witches on broomsticks from landing locally.

=== Flagpoles ===

A &quot;ball-style&quot; finial is often mounted to the top of a stationary flagpole. The United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard employ a variety of different finials depending on the flag in question, the Marines and Coast Guard deferring to the Navy&#x27;s protocols.

== On furniture ==

=== Bed posts and curtain rods ===
Public garden or park railings often end in finials, and wooden posts tend to have turned wood finials. Turned wood finials are used on various pieces of furniture. While the purpose of finials on bed posts is mostly decorative, they serve a purpose on curtain rods, providing a way to keep a curtain from slipping off the end of a straight rod.

Curtain rod finials can be seen to act much like a barometer of public taste. Many designs hark back to the Gothic and Neogothic of architectural finials, while other contemporary finials reflect minimalist, Art Nouveau, and other traditional styles of decor. The use of different materials is as wide as the range of designs with brass, stainless steel, various woods, and aluminum being employed with a variety of finishes such as &#x27;satin steel&#x27; and &#x27;antique brass&#x27;. The durability, strength, and machinability of modern alloys have lent themselves to increasingly intricate and dazzling designs.

== Use as headgear ==
During the various dynasties in China, a finial was worn on the tops of the hats civil or military officials wore during formal court ceremonies. The finial was changed to a knob for other daily usage (including semi-formal ceremonies). The Pickelhaube is a Central European military helmet with a finial topped by a spike.

<doc id="864925" wikidata="Q2359533" url="?curid=864925" title="Tsuki">
<text>derives from the verb , meaning &quot;to thrust&quot;. The second syllable is accented, with Japanese&#x27;s unvoiced vowels making it pronounced almost like &quot;ski&quot; (but preceded by a &quot;t&quot; sound). In Japanese martial arts and Okinawan martial arts, &quot;tsuki&quot; is used to refer to various thrusting techniques.

==Tsuki in Karate==


In karate and its variants, the term &quot;tsuki&quot; is used as a part of a compound word for any one of a variety of thrusting techniques (usually punches). It is never used as a stand-alone term to describe a discrete technique. For example, &quot;gyaku seiken chudan-tsuki&quot;, more commonly referred to as &quot;chudan-tsuki&quot; (段突), refers to a mid-level (&quot;chudan&quot;) punch (&quot;tsuki&quot;) executed with the rear (&quot;gyaku&quot;) arm. Note that in a compound word, where &quot;tsuki&quot; does not come first, its pronunciation and writing changes slightly due to rendaku, and it is pronounced as &quot;zuki&quot; (and is sometimes transliterated that way).

===Performing a Choku-Tsuki (Straight Punch) in Karate===

The &quot;choku-tsuki&quot; (直突き) – straight punch—is a basic karate technique. It is performed by closing the hand in a fist. Target contact is made with the first two knuckles of the fore-fist, with the fist rotated slightly, both externally and downwards, so as to align the wrist directly behind the first two knuckles. For a right &quot;choku-tsuki&quot;, the right fist is chambered at a preparatory position, at the hips or by the ribs, with the palm side of the fist pointed upwards. At the same time, the left arm is extended in front of the left hip. To perform the &quot;choku-tsuki&quot; technique, the right fist is thrust forward in a direct path toward the target, with the elbow directly behind the fist and tracing the fist&#x27;s path. At the same time, the left fist is pulled back to a chambered position at the hip or at the rib cage. The extending fist remains palm up until the last two inches of the punch, during which it rotates to face down. The elbow remains pointed down, since allowing the elbow to rotate to the side or upwards exposes it to injury from either self-inflicted hyperextension, or from a stiff block by the opponent. Ideally, the fist contacts the target in a vertical to a 45 degree rotated position, with the rest of the fist&#x27;s rotation taking place following initial contact.

Karate gives special emphasis to the withdrawing hand – &quot;hikite&quot; (引き手) – which pulls back as the thrusting arm punches. Practitioners are advised to pay as much attention to the pullback action as to the extension of the main punch. Different karate styles will have slightly different pullback chambering positions, varying from as low as on top of the hip, to as high as the armpit.

A straight punch executed from a front stance (zenkutsu-dachi) is called &quot;gyaku-tsuki&quot; (逆突き, reverse punch) if the advanced leg and fist are on opposite sides, or &quot;oi-tsuki&quot; (追い突き, forward punch or lunge punch) if the leg and fist are on the same side.

===Tsuki Power Generation===

The mechanism of power generation in thrusting techniques varies with karate style. Various karate styles and, in particular, Okinawan karate, emphasize the use of the entire body to generate the power that is delivered through the punch. This can include sequencing the activation of muscles, from lower body to upper body, to create a &quot;wave&quot; of power. In those styles, the body is typically well aligned and relaxed throughout the strike. On the other hand, Japanese karate styles, such as Shotokan, emphasize the movement of the hips as the main mean for generating power: The hips twist as the withdrawing (non-punching) &quot;hikite&quot; arm is pulled back while the punching arm is pushed forward, and the karateka is taught to tense the whole body and to push down his or her rear leg as the punch makes contact.

===Other Examples of Tsuki Techniques===

Other examples of basic &quot;tsuki&quot; techniques in karate include the following:

* &quot;Age-tsuki&quot; (上げ突き), rising punch
* &quot;Kagi-tsuki&quot; (鉤突き), hook punch
* &quot;Mawashi-tsuki&quot; (回し突き), roundhouse punch
* &quot;Morote-tsuki&quot; (双手突き), augmented punch using both hands
* &quot;Jun-tsuki (&quot;順突き&quot;), &quot;punch with the lead arm when stationary or moving back/away 
* &quot;Tate-tsuki&quot; (立て突き), vertical fist punch into the middle of the chest (short-range)
* &quot;Ura-tsuki&quot; (裏突き), upside-down fist punch into solar plexus area (short-range)
* &quot;Yama-tsuki&quot; (山突き) or &quot;Rete-zuki&quot;, two-level double punch (combination of &quot;ura-zuki&quot; and jodan oi zuki)

==Tsuki in Aikido and Aiki-jo==
In aikidō, choku-zuki (straight punch, as described above) is a basic thrusting attack from which throwing and pinning skills are taught. However, because in most aikidō schools the straight punch is the predominant punch from which defensive techniques are taught, there is little need to differentiate it from any other punch. Thus, it is shortened and simply called tsuki.

In the &quot;aiki-jō&quot; practiced in some systems of aikido and utilizing a four-foot wooden staff (&quot;jō&quot;), &quot;tsuki&quot; is used literally as part of the name of numerous thrusting techniques with the jō. With the student standing in hidari katate-gamae, the weapon is lifted to the right hand, which slides to the bottom end of the weapon. The student shuffle steps forward (suri-ashi) and the right hand pushes the weapon for the strike, allowing it to slide in the left hand, and coming to rest with the left hand gripping the jō one third the distance from the bottom end. Picture striking a billiard ball with a cue stick, except both hands grip the jō with palms down, and thumbs forward.

==Tsuki in Kendo==

&quot;Tsuki&quot; is one of the five target areas (&quot;datotsu-bui&quot;) in &quot;kendo&quot; (along with &quot;men&quot;, &quot;do&quot;, &quot;hidari kote&quot; and &quot;migi kote&quot;). It is a thrust of the point of the &quot;shinai&quot; to the throat. The target area (&quot;datotsu-bui&quot;) for &quot;tsuki&quot; is the &quot;tsuki-bu&quot;, a multi-layered set of flaps, attached to the &quot;men&quot; (helmet) that protects the throat.

&quot;Tsuki&quot; is most often done with a two handed grip () and less often with only the left hand (). 

&quot;Tsuki&quot; is often disallowed for younger and lower graded players in free practice and in competition (&quot;shiai&quot;) due to the higher risk of injury, as a missed &quot;tsuki&quot; attack can hit the opponent’s unprotected neck and hurt his or her windpipe. 

While variants of &quot;tsuki&quot; exist in other martial arts, in &quot;kendo&quot; it has no variants—the target is always the same.

Unlike most other martial arts that use this term, in &quot;kendo&quot;, &quot;tsuki&quot; is a comprehensive term for both the movement and the target. Unlike with other strikes in kendo, the &quot;kiai&quot; for this strike is not the name of the target (the neck, or &quot;kubi&quot;) but rather the name of the attack (&quot;tsuki&quot;).

<text>Ushas (Vedic Sanskrit: , , nominative singular उषास्) is a Vedic goddess of dawn in Hinduism. She repeatedly appears in the Rigvedic hymns, states David Kinsley, where she is &quot;consistently identified with dawn, revealing herself with the daily coming of light to the world, driving away oppressive darkness, chasing away evil demons, rousing all life, setting all things in motion, sending everyone off to do their duties&quot;. She is the life of all living creatures, the impeller of action and breath, the foe of chaos and confusion, the auspicious arouser of cosmic and moral order called the Ṛta in Hinduism.

Ushas is the most exalted goddess in the &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, but not as important or central as the three male Vedic deities Agni, Soma, and Indra. She is on par with other major male Vedic deities. She is portrayed as a beautifully adorned young woman riding in a golden chariot or a hundred chariots, drawn by golden red horses or cows, on her path across the sky, making way for the Vedic sun god Surya, who is referred either as her husband or her son. Some of the most beautiful hymns in the Vedas are dedicated to her. Her sister is &quot;Nisha&quot; or &quot;Ratri&quot;, the deity of night.

== Etymology ==
Vedic &quot;&quot; is derived from the word &quot;uṣá&quot; which means &quot;dawn&quot;. This word comes from Proto-Indo-Iranian (&quot;ušā&quot; in Avestan), which in turn is from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*h₂éusōs&quot; (&quot;dawn&quot;), and is related to &quot;ēṓs&quot; in Greek and &quot;aušrà&quot; in Lithuanian. It is also the basis for the word &quot;east&quot; in Indo-European traditions, state Mallory and Adams.

&quot;Uṣás&quot; is an &quot;s&quot;-stem, i.e. the genitive case is &#x27;, whereby it connotes &quot;dawn goddess&quot; in Indo-European languages. Ushas is related to the Proto-Indo-European goddess &#x27;. Her cognates in other Indo-European pantheons include the Greek goddess Eos, the Roman goddess Aurora, the Lithuanian goddess Aušrinė, and the English goddess Ēostre (OE: ēastre), whose name is probably the root of the modern English word &quot;Easter.&quot;

==Description==
Ushas is the prominent goddess of dawn in the Vedas. She is depicted as the one who imbues life to all beings, as the &quot;life of all life&quot; and &quot;breath of all breaths&quot;, according to Jones and Ryan. She is revered as the deity who revivifies earth each day, drives away the chaos and the darkness, sets all things in motion, sends all living beings to do their duties in the Vedas.

Ushas is the most important goddess in the Vedic literature, but she is not as important as the three central male deities named Agni, Soma, and Indra. She is mentioned in far fewer hymns than these three, but at least as much as all other male and female deities in the Vedas.

=== Rigveda ===
Ushas is mentioned in numerous hymns of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. Forty of its hymns are dedicated to her, while her name appears in other additional hymns. She is thanked for and petitioned for driving away darkness in hymns 7.78, 6.64 and 10.172; bringer of light urged by Surya in hymn 3.61, and the chaser of evil demons in hymn 8.47. The Rigvedic hymn 1.48 describes her as drawn in a hundred chariots, revealed by the daily arrival of light, one who sets all motion to life and all life to motion, rousing people off to their duties. She is revered for giving strength in hymn 1.44, to Ṛta in hymn 3.61 and 7.75, and participating in daily restoration of order and fighting chaotic forces that threaten the world in hymn 1.113.

Ushas is described in Vedic texts as riding in a shining chariot drawn by golden-red horses or cows, a beautiful maiden bedecked with jewels, smiling and irresistibly attractive, who brings cheer to all those who gaze upon her. She dispels darkness, reveals treasures and truths that have been hidden, illuminates the world as it is. Hymn 6.64 associates her with wealth and light, while hymn 1.92 calls her the &quot;mother of cows&quot; and one, who like a cow, gives to the benefit of all people. Hymn 1.113 calls her &quot;mother of the gods&quot;, while hymn 7.81 states her to be the mother of all living beings who petition her. She is the goddess of the hearth, states hymn 6.64. She symbolizes reality, is a marker of time and a reminder to all that &quot;life is limited on earth&quot;. She sees everything as it is, and she is the eye of the gods, according to hymns 7.75–77.

She is variously mentioned as the sister of Ratri (night), Aditya and one who goes about her ways closely with deities Savitri and Surya. She is also associated with Varuna (sky, water) and Agni (fire).

In RV 6.64.1-2 (trans. Jamison), Ushas is invoked as follows:

Vedic:
&lt;poem&gt;
 1. &quot;úd u śriyá uṣáso rócamānā ásthur apā́ṃ nórmáyo rúśantaḥ&quot;
 &quot;kr̥ṇóti víśvā supáthā sugā́ny ábhūd u vásvī dákṣiṇā maghónī&quot;
 2. &quot;bhadrā́ dadr̥kṣa urviyā́ ví bhāsy út te śocír bhānávo dyā́m apaptan&quot;
 &quot;āvír vákṣaḥ kr̥ṇuṣe śumbʰámānóṣo devi rócamānā máhobhiḥ&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

English translation:

&lt;poem&gt;
 1. The shining Dawns have arisen for splendor, glistening like the waves of the waters.
 She makes all pathways, all passages easy to travel. She has appeared— the good priestly gift, the bounteous one.
 2. Auspicious, you have become visible; you radiate widely. Your flare, your radiant beams have flown up to heaven.
 You reveal your breast as you go in beauty, goddess Dawn, shining with all your might. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

In the &quot;family books&quot; of the &quot;Rig Veda&quot; (e.g. RV 6.64.5), Ushas is the divine daughter—a &quot;&quot; —of &quot;Dyaus Pita&quot; (&quot;Sky Father&quot;).

&lt;poem&gt;
 5. Convey (it)—you who as the unsurpassable one with your oxen convey the boon at your pleasure, Dawn,
 you who are a goddess, o Daughter of Heaven. Become worthy to be seen with your munificence at the early invocation!
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Contemporary reverence ==
The revered Gayatri mantra, states George Williams, remains a daily reminder of Ushas in contemporary Hinduism.

According to Sri Aurobindo, Ushas is &quot;the medium of the awakening, the activity and the growth of the other gods; she is the first condition of the Vedic realisation. By her increasing illumination the whole nature of man is clarified; through her [mankind] arrives at the Truth, through her he enjoys [Truth&#x27;s] beatitude.&quot;

Ushas is regionally worshipped during the festival of Chhath Puja, in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (India), and in Nepal.

<doc id="864950" wikidata="Q5448022" url="?curid=864950" title="Figure of Insensitivity">
<text>Figure of Insensitivity (F of I) is an inverse scale of measure of the impact sensitivity of an explosive substance. In this particular context the term &#x27;Insensitivity&#x27; refers to the likelihood of initiation/detonation by impact, friction, electrostatic discharge, application of flame, etc. It is a quantitative measure of the level of stimulus required to cause explosive decomposition. 

The figure of insensitivity is determined from impact testing, typically using a drop-weight tower. In this test, a small sample of the explosive is placed on a small steel anvil which is slotted into a recess in the base of the drop tower. A cylindrical, 1 kilogram steel weight (mounted inside a tube to accurately guide its descent to the impact point in the centre of the anvil) is then dropped onto the test specimen from a measured height. The specimen is monitored both during and after this process to determine whether initiation occurs. This test is repeated many times, varying the drop height according to a prescribed method. Various heights are used, starting with a small distance (e.g. 10  cm) and then progressively increasing it to as high as 3 metres. The series of drop heights and whether initiation occurred are analysed statistically to determine the drop height which has a 50% likelihood of initiating the explosives. The intention of these tests is to develop safety policies/rules that will govern the design, manufacturing, handling and storage of the explosive and any munitions containing it.

A reference standard sample of RDX is currently used to calibrate the drop tower, so that the drop height to produce 50% likelihood of initiation in this material is measured and recorded. The drop height required to initiate other explosives can then be related to the RDX standard so that a ready comparison of impact sensitivity between different explosives can be made. By convention, explosives having a 50% initiation drop height equal to that of RDX are given a F of I of 80.

The scale was originally defined using TNT as the reference standard, with TNT having, by definition, an F of I of exactly 100. On this original scale, RDX yielded an F of I of around 80. Following World War II, when more complex explosive compositions replaced pure TNT as the most common energetic component of weapon systems, RDX was adopted as the reference standard.

Sensitivity should not be confused with &quot;Sensitiveness&quot; which is a measure of how easy it is to detonate an explosive. In this context an explosive with more sensitiveness requires a smaller detonator or gayne to detonate it.

<doc id="864956" wikidata="Q210081" url="?curid=864956" title="Walters Art Museum">
<text>The Walters Art Museum is a public art museum located in the Mount Vernon neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. Founded and opened in 1934, it holds collections from the mid-19th century that were amassed substantially by major American art and sculpture collectors, including William Thompson Walters and his son Henry Walters. William Walters began collecting when he moved to Paris as a nominal Confederate loyalist at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, and Henry Walters refined the collection and made arrangements for the construction what ultimately was Walters Art Museum. 

Admission to the museum is free.

==History==
After allowing the Baltimore public to occasionally view his father&#x27;s and his growing added collections at his West Mount Vernon Place mansion during the late 1800s, Henry Walters arranged for an elaborate stone palazzo-styled structure to be built for this purpose in 1905–1909, located a block south of the Walters mansion on West Monument Street/Mount Vernon Place, on the northwest corner of North Charles Street at West Centre Street.

The mansion and gallery were also just south and west of the landmark Washington Monument in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, just north of the downtown business district and northeast of Cathedral Hill. Upon his 1931 death, Henry Walters bequeathed the entire collection of then more than 22,000 works, the original Charles Street Gallery building, and his adjacent townhouse/mansion just across the alley to the north on West Mount Vernon Place to the City of Baltimore, &quot;for the benefit of the public&quot;. The collection includes masterworks of ancient Egypt, Greek sculpture and Roman sarcophagi, medieval ivories, illuminated manuscripts, Renaissance bronzes, Old Master European and 19th-century paintings, Chinese ceramics and bronzes, Art Deco jewelry, and ancient Near East, Mesopotamian, or ancient Middle East items. Dorothy Miner became its first Keeper of Manuscripts in 1934 and held the post until her death in 1973.

In 2000, &quot;The Walters Art Gallery&quot; changed its long-time name to &quot;The Walters Art Museum&quot; to reflect its image as a large public institution and eliminate confusion among some of the increasing out-of-state visitors. The following year, &quot;The Walters&quot; (as it is often known locally) reopened its original main building after a dramatic three-year physical renovation and replacement of internal utilities and infrastructure. The Archimedes Palimpsest was on loan to the Walters Art Museum from a private collector for conservation and spectral imaging studies.

Starting on October 1, 2006, the museum was enabled to make admission free to all, year-round, as a result of substantial grants given by Baltimore City and the surrounding suburban Baltimore County arts agencies and authorities. In 2012, &quot;The Walters&quot; released nearly 20,000 of its own images of its collections on a Creative Commons license, and collaborated in their upload to the world-wide web and the Internet on Wikimedia Commons. This was one of the largest and most comprehensive such releases made by any museum.

==Permanent collection==

===Ancient art===
The Walters&#x27; collection of ancient art includes examples from Egypt, Nubia, Greece, Rome, Etruria and the Near East. Highlights include two monumental 3,000-pound statues of the Egyptian lion-headed fire goddess Sekhmet on long-term loan from the British Museum; the Walters Mummy; alabaster reliefs from the palace of Ashurnasirpal II; Greek gold jewelry, including the Greek bracelets from Olbia on the shores of the Black Sea; the Praxitelean Satyr; a large assemblage of Roman portrait heads; a Roman bronze banquet couch, and marble sarcophagi from the tombs of the prominent Licinian and Calpurnian families.

===Art of the ancient Americas===
In 1911, Henry Walters purchased almost 100 gold artifacts from the Chiriqui region of western Panama in Central America, creating a core collection of ancient American native art. Through subsequent gifts of art and loans, the museum has added works, mostly in pottery and stone, from Mexico, Central America and South America, including pieces from the Mesoamerican Olmec, Aztec, and Maya cultures, as well as the Moche and Inca peoples of South America.

===Asian art===
Highlights of the Asian art collection assembled earlier by Baltimorean father and son collectors William T. and Henry Walters include Japanese arms and armor, and Chinese and Japanese porcelains, lacquers, and metalwork. Among the museum&#x27;s outstanding works of Asian art is a late-12th- or early-13th-century Cambodian bronze of the eight-armed Avalokiteshvara, a Tang dynasty earthenware camel, and an intricately painted Ming dynasty wine jar. The museum owns the oldest surviving Chinese wood-and-lacquer image of the Buddha (late 6th century AD). It is exhibited in a gallery dedicated solely to this work.

The museum holds one of the largest and finest collections of Thai (Siam/Thailand) bronze, scrolls, and banner paintings in the world.
===Islamic art===
Islamic art in all media is represented at the Walters. Among the highlights are a 7th-century carved and hammered silver bowl from Iran, (ancient Persia); a 13th-century candlestick made of copper, silver, and gold from the Mamluk era in Egypt; 16th-century mausoleum doors decorated with intricate wood carvings in a radiating star pattern; a 17th-century silk sash from the Mughal Empire in India; and a 17th-century Turkish tile with an image of the Masjid al-Haram (&quot;Great Mosque of Mecca&quot;), the center of Islam in Mecca, (modern Saudi Arabia).
The Walters Museum owns an array of Islamic manuscripts. These include a 15th-century Koran from northern India, written at the height of the Timurid Empire; a 16th-century copy of the &quot;Khamsa of Nizami by Amir Khusraw, illustrated by a number of famous artists for the Emperor Akbar; and a Turkish calligraphy album by Sheikh Hamadullah Al-Amasi, one of the greatest calligraphers of all time. Walters Art Museum, MS W.613 contains five Mughal miniatures from an important &quot;Khamsa of Nizami&quot; made for the Emperor Akbar; the rest are in London, Great Britain.

===Medieval European art===
Henry Walters assembled a collection of art produced during the Middle Ages in all the major artistic media of the period. This forms the basis of the Walters&#x27; medieval collection, for which the museum is best known internationally. Considered one of the best collections of medieval art in the United States, the museum&#x27;s holdings include examples of metalwork, sculpture, stained glass, textiles, icons, and other paintings. The collection is especially renowned for its ivories, enamels, reliquaries, early Byzantine silver, post-Byzantine art, illuminated manuscripts, Georgian illuminated Gospel manuscript, and the largest and finest collection of Ethiopian Orthodox Church art outside Ethiopia.

The Walters&#x27; medieval collection features unique objects such as the Byzantine agate Rubens Vase that belonged to the painter Rubens (accession no. 42.562) and the earliest-surviving image of the &quot;Virgin of Tenderness&quot;, an ivory carving produced in Egypt in the 6th or 7th century (accession no. 71.297). Sculpted heads from the royal Abbey of St. Denis are rare surviving examples of portal sculptures that are directly connected with the origins of Gothic art in 12th-century France (accession nos. 27.21 and 27.22). An ivory casket covered with scenes of jousting knights is one of about a dozen such objects to survive in the world (accession no. 71.264).

Many of these works are on display in the museum&#x27;s galleries. Works from the medieval collection are also frequently included in special touring exhibitions, such as &quot;Treasures of Heaven&quot;, an exhibition about relics and reliquaries that was on view at the Cleveland Museum of Art in (Cleveland, Ohio), the Walters Art Museum, and the British Museum in London in 2010–11.

Works in the medieval collection are the subject of active research by the curatorial and conservation departments of the museum, and visiting researchers frequently make use of the museum&#x27;s holdings. In-depth technical research carried on these objects is made available to the public through publications and exhibitions, as in the case of the Amandus Shrine (accession no. 53.9), which was featured in a small special exhibition titled &quot;The Special Dead&quot; in 2008–09.
There are also Late Medieval devotional Italian paintings by these painters at the Walters: Tommaso da Modena, Pietro Lorenzetti, Andrea di Bartolo (&quot;Resurrection&quot;), Alberto Sotio, Bartolomeo di Tommaso (&quot;Death of Saint Francis&quot;), Naddo Ceccarelli, Master of Saint Verdiana, Niccolo di Segna (&quot;Saint Lucy&quot;), Orcagna, Olivuccio di Ciccarello, Master of Panzano Triptych and Giovanni del Biondo.

===Renaissance, Baroque and 18th-century European art===
The collection of European Renaissance and Baroque art features holdings of paintings, sculpture, furniture, ceramics, metal work, arms and armor. The highlights include Hugo van der Goes&#x27; &quot;Donor with Saint John the Baptist&quot;, Heemskerck&#x27;s &quot;Panorama with the Abduction of Helen Amidst the Wonders of the Ancient World&quot;, El Greco&#x27;s &quot;Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata&quot;, Giambattista Pittoni&#x27;s &quot;Sacrifice of Polyxena&quot;, the &quot;Madonna of the Candelabra&quot;, from the studio of Raphael, Veronese&#x27;s &quot;Portrait Of Countess Livia da Porto Thiene and her Daughter Porzia&quot;, El Greco&#x27;s &quot;Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata&quot;, Bernini&#x27;s &quot;bozzetto&quot; of &quot;Risen Christ&quot;, Tiepolo&#x27;s &quot;Scipio Africanus Freeing Massiva&quot;, and &quot;The Ideal City&quot; attributed to Fra Carnevale. The museum has one of ten surviving examples of the Sèvres pot-pourri vase in the shape of a ship from the 1750s and 1760s.

===19th-century European art===
William and Henry Walters collected works by late-19th-century French academic masters and Impressionists. Highlights of the collection include &quot;Odalisque with Slave&quot; by Ingres (a second version); Claude Monet&#x27;s &quot;Springtime&quot;; Alfred Sisley&#x27;s panoramic view of the Seine Valley; and Édouard Manet&#x27;s realist masterpiece, &quot;The Café Concert&quot;.

Henry Walters was particularly interested in the courtly arts of 18th-century France. The museum&#x27;s collection of Sèvres porcelain includes a number of pieces that were made for members of the Royal Bourbon Court at Versailles Palace outside of Paris. Portrait miniatures and the examples of goldsmiths&#x27; works, especially snuffboxes and watches, are displayed in the Treasury, along with some exceptional 19th- and early-20th-century works. Among them are examples of Art Nouveau-styled jewelry by René Lalique, jeweled objects by the House of Fabergé, including two Russian Imperial Easter eggs, and precious jewels by Tiffany and Co. of New York City.

The Walters&#x27; collection presents an overview of 19th-century European art, particularly art from France. From the first half of the century come major paintings by Ingres, Géricault, and Delacroix. William Walters stayed in Paris with his family during the Civil War, because of his notorious Southern-leanings, and he soon developed a keen interest in contemporary European painting. He either commissioned directly from the artists or purchased at auctions such major works by the Barbizon masters, including Jean-François Millet and Henri Rousseau; the academic masters Jean-Léon Gérôme and Lawrence Alma-Tadema; and even the modernists Monet, Manet and Sisley.
==Drawings==
==Buildings==

===Charles Street – Old Main Building (1905–1909)===

Henry Walters&#x27; original gallery was designed by architect William Adams Delano and erected between 1904 and 1909, facing South Washington Place (at the northwest corner with West Centre Street) and attached by an overhead bridge/passageway across the back alley from his adjacent townhouse/mansion to the north on West Mount Vernon Place (facing the Washington Monument to the northeast). Its exterior was inspired by the Renaissance-revival-style Hôtel Pourtalès in Paris and its interior was modeled after the 17th-century &quot;Collegio dei Gesuiti&quot; (now the Palazzo dell&#x27;Università) built by the Balbi family for the Jesuits in Genoa. The arts of the Renaissance and Baroque periods, French decorative arts of the 18th and 19th centuries, and manuscripts and rare books are now exhibited in this palazzo-style structure.

===Centre Street Annex Building (1974)===
Designed by the Boston firm of Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson &amp; Abbott, in the &quot;Brutalist&quot; poured-concrete style prevailing in the 1960s, (one of the few others in the region of this extremely modernistic style in the city – such as the recently razed Morris A. Mechanic Theatre in downtown Charles Center on the southwest corner of Charles and Baltimore Streets from 1967), this annex building (which has several horizontal lines paralleled with features in the 1909 structure) to the west along West Centre Street and rear of the original main gallery, extending to Park Avenue, opened in 1974. It was substantially altered in 1998–2001 by another firm of Kallmann McKinnell and Wood, Architects, to provide a four-story glass atrium, with a suspended staircase at the juncture between the older and newer buildings with a new entrance lobby along Centre Street. The new lobby, which also provides easier ground-level handicapped access along with enhanced security provisions for both collections and visitors is also providing a café, an enlarged museum and gift store and a reference library. The ancient, Byzantine, medieval, Ethiopian, and 19th-century European collections are housed in this building, with its large display walls and irregular corridors and galleries. Also here is the museum&#x27;s famed art conservation laboratory, which is one of the oldest in the country.
===Hackerman House (1850/1991)===

This Greek Revival style townhouse/mansion, one of the most elaborate in the city, was designed by famed local architect John Rudolph Niernsee (1814–1885), and erected between 1848 and 1850 for John Hanson Thomas, was long regarded as the most &quot;elegant&quot; house along Mount Vernon Place or Washington Place. It sits on the southwest corner of the circle surrounding the Washington Monument and was later owned by the families Jencks and Gladding (and the house has been known as the Thomas-Jencks-Gladding Mansion). Considered in its premiere landmark municipal location to be used for Baltimore City&#x27;s Official Mayor&#x27;s Residence (similar to other major American cities mayor&#x27;s mansions such as Gracie Mansion in a river-front park on New York City&#x27;s east side of Manhattan, facing the East River), when it was briefly acquired by the city in the late 1950s and then being considered to be razed for an unfortunately poorly-conceived and planned northern expansion of the Gallery engendered local preservationists&#x27; protests before being finally re-sold to the Gladding family of a well-known public-spirited local Chevrolet auto dealership, who promised to restore and preserve the noted mansion.

Among the original owning family of the Thomas&#x27;s distinguished guests of the mid-19th century were the Prince of Wales (eldest son of Queen Victoria), the future King Edward VII (reigned 1901–1910); and General Lajos Kossuth (1802–1894), the then famous Hungarian freedom fighter, president of an early, brief Hungarian republic, veteran of the European Revolutions of 1847–1848 and the &quot;Father of modern Hungary&quot;. Since the mid-1980s when, the Thomas-Jencks-Gladding Mansion was reacquired by the city under Mayor William Donald Schaefer (1921–2011), who served the city from 1971 to 1987, and future governor of Maryland (1987–1995) from the Gladding family with a donation by the mayor&#x27;s friend and local businessman Willard Hackerman, and transferred to the purposes of &quot;The Walters&quot;. Since additional renovations with the addition of a connecting gallery with domed skylight and corridor constructed through the top of the old rear carriage house/garage to the south end of the house, and across the east–west alley to the old 1909 Main Building&#x27;s north side. Reopened in 1991, the newly renamed &quot;Hackerman House&quot; has been devoted to The Walters&#x27; recently expanded holdings of Asian art. As &quot;Thomas-Jencks-Gladding House&quot;, the building was designated a Baltimore City Landmark in 1975.

== Anti-Labor Hostility ==

Throughout 2021, director Julia Marciari-Alexander, advised by union-busting law firm Shaw Rosenthal LLP, refused to meet with Walters employees, stalling the advance of a wall-to-wall unionization effort. In October 2021, when directed by the Baltimore City Council and Comptroller Bill Henry to meet with employees and allow a vote on unionization, Marciari-Alexander refused, claiming that meeting with her employees constitutes interference. It was later stated that if the unionization effort was successful, workers would be represented by AFSCME Council 67, which would also represent workers at Baltimore Museum of Art and Enoch Pratt Free Library.

<doc id="864959" wikidata="Q754278" url="?curid=864959" title="Atemi">
<text>In Japanese martial arts, the term designates blows or strikes to the body, as opposed to twisting of joints, strangleholds, holding techniques and throws. Atemi can be delivered by any part of the body to any part of the opponent&#x27;s body. They can be percussive or use &quot;soft&quot; power. Karate is a typical martial art focusing on percussive atemi. The location of nerve and pressure points, such as might be used for certain acupressure methods, also often informs the choice of targets for atemi (see kyusho).

Some strikes against vital parts of the body can kill or incapacitate the opponent: on the solar plexus, at the temple, under the nose, in the eyes, genitals, or under the chin. Traditional Japanese martial arts (the ancestors of judo, jujutsu, and aikido) do not commonly practice atemi, since they were supposed to be used on the battlefield against armoured opponents. However, there are certain exceptions.

Atemi can be complete techniques in and of themselves, but are also often used to briefly break an opponent&#x27;s balance (see kuzushi) or resolve. This is the predominant usage of atemi in aikido. A painful but non-fatal blow to an area such as the eyes, face, or some vulnerable part of the abdomen can open the way for a more damaging technique, such as a throw or joint lock. Even if the blow does not land, the opponent can be distracted, and may instinctively contort their body (e.g., jerking their head back from a face strike) in such a way that they lose their balance.

The development of atemi techniques arises from the evolution of the Japanese martial arts, in particular jujutsu. Early styles of jujutsu from Sengoku-era Japan were created as a means of unarmed combat for a samurai who had lost his weapons on the battlefield. The purpose of jujutsu was to disarm the opponent and use their own weapon against them. As such, strikes to the body were limited as the intended victim would have been wearing extensive body armour. However, in later styles of jujutsu from Edo-period Japan empty-handed strikes to the body became more common as full-scale military engagement began to decline. This meant that the jujutsu practitioner&#x27;s opponent would not have been wearing armour and the vital points that form the crux of atemi-waza were more exposed.

==Atemi waza in original judo==

Kodokan judo as designed by Jigoro Kano also contained &quot;atemi waza&quot; (当て身技) or body-striking techniques from the several jujitsu styles that inspired Kano, which, however, were excluded from its sports competition repertoire, which limits itself to throws (&quot;nage waza&quot;) and holds (&quot;kansetsu waza&quot;). Although taught within self-defense, kata and sometimes used within informal randori, striking techniques are forbidden in the sport judo competitions rules.

<text>Knin () is a city in the Šibenik-Knin County of Croatia, located in the Dalmatian hinterland near the source of the river Krka, an important traffic junction on the rail and road routes between Zagreb and Split. Knin rose to prominence twice in history, as the capital of both the medieval Kingdom of Croatia and briefly of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina within the newly independent Republic of Croatia for the duration of Croatian War of Independence from 1991 to 1995.

==Etymology==
The name is likely derived from the Illyrian &quot;Ninia&quot;. According to an alternative explanation, offered by Franz Miklosich and Petar Skok, the name - derived from a Slavic root &quot;*tьn-&quot; (&quot;to cut&quot;, &quot;to chop&quot;) - means &quot;cleared forest&quot;. The medieval names of Knin include ; ; . The Latin name is still used as a titular episcopal see, the Diocese of Tinum.

==History==
===Ancient===

The area consisting of today&#x27;s Knin, or more specifically, the Spas hill, has been inhabited since the Stone Age.
In the vicinity of today&#x27;s Knin was once a town called Burnum, which served as a Roman military camp in the 1st century BC.

===Middle Ages===
The original settlement grew atop the Spas hill in the earliest history and which later formed the castle of Knin. The first church, a monastery dedicated to Saint Bartholomew, was built during the time of Trpimir I in the 9th century in Kapitul (south-east from Knin Castle, where the later bishopric was located). It was later expanded or rebuilt by a certain Duke of Croatia, probably Svetoslav, during the reign of king Stephen Držislav of Croatia in the 10th century.

Knin is first mentioned in the 10th-century work &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; as the centre of the Knin county (županija), and as one of the populated towns in Croatia. Around 1040, at the behest of the Croatian kings, a seat of the royal bishop was established in the nearby royal village of Biskupija (Kosovo), in the church of Saint Mary. The first &quot;bishop of the Croats&quot; is named &quot;Marko Giudice&quot;, and he and his successors were attached to the royal court as preachers and king&#x27;s &quot;special bishops&quot; until 1102.

Knin became a more permanent royal residence of king Demetrius Zvonimir around 1080. Because of this, it has led to Knin being known as the &quot;City of Croatian Kings&quot; or &quot;Zvonimir&#x27;s City&quot; (&quot;Zvonimirov grad&quot;) in recent times. In the following decade, during the succession crisis, the city was the permanent residence of a local lord Petar Snačić, who contested the crown of Croatia until his defeat by king Coloman of Hungary in 1096. At that point, it came into possession of the Hungarian Arpad dynasty, and since then, it ceased to be a permanent royal residence but remained as a political and administrative center of the kingdom. The parish church dedicated to king Saint Stephen is thought to have been built during this period.
 
In 1178, it is for the first time mentioned as &quot;civitates&quot; (city) in a contemporary local source. Due to the extinction of the local ruling dynasty, the Croatian bishop moved his see to Knin itself, after which he started calling himself the Bishop of Knin. This precipitated the construction of a new cathedral, which was initiated in 1203 by the son of the Duke of Knin, Dobroslav in Kapitul.

The city was visited by Queen Maria Laskarina, the daughter of the Byzantine Emperor and wife of king Béla IV of Hungary, together with her retinue of nobles and a great number of soldiers in 1261 in order to introduce her son to the Croatian nobility and to negotiate their oath in recognizing him as the designated duke (herceg). In 1264, the first case of judicial function in the city was mentioned and during this time, Knin was the seat of both the Croatian ban, and the duke, who acted as a semi-independent ruler with close connection to the king and whose chancellor had been the bishop of Knin. Between 1270 and 1272, the new cathedral was consecrated on the orders of the Knin bishop Nicholas. The cathedral is described as being &quot;magnificent&quot; and &quot;solemn&quot; by subsequent documents. By this point, a new town had already developed outside the castle complex. A market square (forum) was for the first time mentioned in the second half of 13th century.

The transition from 13th to 14th century was marked in the rise of the Šubić noble family, whose members likely made Knin one of the seats within their realm. According to the 19th century Franciscan friar and historian Donato Fabianich, the monastery of Saint Catherine was founded around this time by the Knin nobility which were first settled there by Mladen Šubić. Their rule over Knin came to an end at the Battle of Bliska in 1322, after which the Angevin king Charles Robert arrived in the city and imprisoned the former lord Mladen II Šubić of Bribir. Upon the departure of the king to Hungary, the noble Ivan Nelipić quickly seized Knin, and from there expelled the king&#x27;s men from Croatia. Thus, these territories &quot;de facto&quot; continued to remain outside the monarchy, and the Nelipić noble family made Knin their permanent seat and ruled their territories as &quot;Princes of Knin&quot;.

After successfully warring against their enemies, the Dalmatian cities and nobility under Juraj II Šubić of Bribir (who was imprisoned in the castle&#x27;s dungeons), as well as the royal forces commanded by the Slavonian ban Mikac Prodanić, their rule came to an end when Louis I of Hungary personally led an army to re-establish royal power over Knin in 1345. During this time it became known that the castle consisted of two major parts, administered by two castellans and which was populated by houses and baths, a palace with a main hall used previously by the Nelipić&#x27;s to sign an alliance with the Republic of Venice and to enforce customs on imports to the city. An annual trade fair, on Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s day is known to have taken place in the settlement below since at least the 1360s and was regularly attended by the merchants from the Dalmatian cities. It is known that Knin&#x27;s also burg housed a significant colony of merchants originating from these cities which also gives insight into its commercial importance. A supreme judicial body for the whole of Croatia was formed, composed of Croatian nobility, and was located on the castle grounds. A chapel dedicated to Saint Bartholomew located within the cathedral was the place of notary of the Knin See. There the noble Ivan Nelipić (son of Vladislava) had reaffirmed his rights to the estates and lands in Cetina during his stay in the city.

Using the dynastic instability in the neighboring lands, the city came into the hands of the Bosnian king Tvrtko I during the year of 1388. The previous bishop had likely been expelled, where the Ragusan Mihailo took his place, and was also given the office of the king&#x27;s chancellor. These actions provoked a retaliation of king Sigismund, whose armies besieged Knin in September 1390. The city, along with other territories were returned to Sigismund in 1393. Upon his return from the disastrous battle of Nicopolis in 1396, the king spent a month in Knin to consolidate his holdings and state affairs of Dalmatia and Croatia, issuing various decrees together with his ban Nikola Gorjanski. In 1401, the city was besieged by the Bosnian king Stephen Ostoja, who encamped in the adjacent Knin field (Kninsko polje), and remained there until the following year. The newly crowned king Ladislaus of Naples attained support from the castellan of Knin and issued his first decree there in 1403.

Because of frequent harassment, the citizens of Knin had to pay tribute to the duke Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, and for a short while, the city seemed to have been directly under his rule. The presence of Franciscans is for the first time mentioned in the 15th century, which were located in the old Saint Mary&#x27;s church and monastery in the city. Apart from them, other religious buildings are mentioned such as the church of the Holy Spirit.

Its strategic position played an important role in many wars and power changes – the Republic of Venice often reflected on its importance as a key castle and the main entrance to Dalmatia, which it attempted to obtain during the 15th century. During these years both the city, the ban and his dignitaries played a crucial role in the struggle for dominance over the coastal cities with Venice. In 1430 Knin and the Church of St. Bartolomeo in Kapitul were the centre of the &quot;Union and Brotherhood of the Croats&quot; (), a congregation of Croatian nobles formed by 12 counties of Croatia in order to &quot;preserve the fame and old customs of the Croatian Kingdom&quot;.

It was in 1420 that the Nelipić noble family again regained their former role in Croatia with the emergence of Ivaniš Nelipić, which again distanced these territories from the crown. These possessions were later acquired after Ivaniš&#x27;s death in 1435 by Anž of the House of Frankopan through the marriage with the Nelipić nobles. Knin and the surrounding possessions were restored to the crown upon Anž&#x27;s death in 1437. In 1454 an attempt between the Bosnian king and the Venetians was made to acquire the city, which was referenced as &quot;capital and foremost place of Croatia&quot; in their letters.

During the reign of king Matthias Corvinus, the bishops of Knin were selected as the king&#x27;s principal orators abroad in collecting the help needed against the invading Ottoman Empire. The bishop was thus first secretly involved at the pope to solicit financial aid for Matthias&#x27; military campaign. The city&#x27;s distant surroundings quickly became a target for Ottoman raids. As the raids were becoming more frequent, one of them reached Knin, where a Franciscan monastery has been recorded to have been destroyed in 1469.

In 1493, the first direct attempt of siege by the Ottomans was undertaken, which was followed by ban John Corvinus and his deputies invading and pillaging the Ottoman territories from the city. The Republic of Venice started to financially support the city&#x27;s defences in fear for its possessions in Dalmatia. In 1501, three Ottoman spies were caught and imprisoned by the vice-ban. They were sent by the Sanjak-bey of Bosnia, and had infiltrated Knin posing as friars that were on their way to sell vestments to the market. They were to investigate the situation in the Zadar surrounding.

The last major conflict around Knin before the truce was in September 1502 when 2,000 Ottoman cavalrymen looted the area. On 20 August 1503 King Vladislaus II concluded a 7-year peace treaty with Sultan Bayezid II. The armistice was generally respected by all sides, during which Knin&#x27;s defensive positions were strengthened in 1504. A period of severe famine started in 1505 that affected entire Dalmatia. In 1510 the plague halved Knin&#x27;s population.
In 1510 around 1,000 Ottoman Akıncı raided the countryside of Knin. There had been word that viceban of Croatia was captured on that occasion. Baltazar Baćan (), viceban of Slavonia, together with forces from the Zagreb Bishopry, managed to lift the siege of Knin in January 1513. Next year in February the Ottomans laid siege on Knin with 10,000 men from the Sanjak of Bosnia, but were unable to take the city and lost 500 troops. Knin&#x27;s burg and outskirts were burned on this occasion. These clashes left Knin devastated and there was no news about the city for five years. Local population was decimated by war, hunger, plague and migration to safer places, and its economy was hindered by the seizure of crops and livestock. Due to Knin&#x27;s strategic value, King Louis II responded to requests from captains of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica and promised reinforcements of 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalrymen. However, it is unlikely that these forces arrived to the endangered towns.

On 29 May 1522 after the final siege of the Knin castle, it fell to the Ottoman Empire, and Croats left the town in large numbers. The Ottomans repopulated the town with new inhabitants from Bosnia.

===Ottoman and Venetian period===

The bishops who held the title no longer resided in Knin after it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1522. It was initially part of the Sanjak of Kilis, later the centre of the Sanjak of Kırka, was founded in 1574. By 1540, Ottomans massively populated area between Skradin and Knin with Vlachs.
It was briefly captured by Venice in 1648 during Cretan War. After Venice captured the district in 1688, the Bishop of Šibenik was appointed to administer the diocese, which was united in 1828 to Šibenik. The bishopric is today the titular see of Tinum.

A century and a half later, on 11 September 1688, it was captured by the Venetian Republic. Subsequently, the Croatian population partially returned and the Franciscans built a monastery and a church there in 1708. Ottomans aimed to retake Knin during Ottoman-Venetian War, but their siege was repulsed in 1715.

===Habsburg era===

Knin passed on to the Habsburgs together with Dalmatia in 1797 according to the Treaty of Campo Formio. After the Peace of Pressburg in 1805, the French Empire gained the city and incorporated it into the Illyrian Provinces in 1809. By 1813, the Austrians regained control over the town. By the end of the 19th century, as a part of the Habsburg domain of Dalmatia, Knin grew steadily, becoming an important commercial as well as road and railway center. In 1867, Knin became a part of Dalmatia – a territorial entity within Cisleithania.

===Modern===
====Kingdom of Yugoslavia and World War II====
After the First World War, Knin became a part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs in 1918, which after a brief Italian military occupation subsequently became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (named Kingdom of Yugoslavia after 1929). Previously only connected with rail to Šibenik and Split (with narrow gauge to Drvar and Prijedor as well), in 1925 Lika railway connected Knin with Zagreb and north in general. It gradually became a busy rail hub; already in 1927 a total of 58,000 passengers departed Knin rail station.

In World War II, Knin was in the so-called second Italian occupation zone, administered by the civilian authorities of the collaborationist Independent State of Croatia led by the fascist Ustaša regime, but with heavy Italian military presence. The Italians also relied heavily on local ethnic Serb militias (Chetniks) to maintain order and suppress partisan resistance. In April 1943, Đujić&#x27;s Chetniks set up a prison and execution site in the village of Kosovo (today Biskupija), near Knin. Thousands of local civilians, (both Croats and even Serb Anti-Fascists) including women and children, as well as captured Partisans, were held and mistreated at this prison, while hundreds of prisoners (as many as over 1,000) were tortured and killed at an execution site near a ravine close to the camp. While visiting the village of Kninsko Polje, local warlord Branko Bogunović said: &quot;There is no salvation for the Croats, and there is no need for them to run because they cannot escape, there is no Croatian state, nor will it be, and all Croats need to be slaughtered.&quot;
The entire area was the scene of the Croatian genocide campaign against the local Serb population. The Ustaša regime declared Knin the county seat of Bribir and Sidraga. After the Italian surrender in September 1943, German forces became the main factor in the region. As the war progressed and partisan forces liberated most of Dalmatia, with Germans pulling out and retreating northwards, Axis and partisan forces pitted against each other in Knin in a major battle in early December 1944. The 8th Dalmatian Corps sought to destroy the German, Ustaše and Chetnik formations in North Dalmatia and the city of Knin. With around 50,000 troops involved and more than 7,000 casualties on all sides, the Partisans liberated Knin on 9 December. Five Knin natives who fought in partisan ranks were proclaimed People&#x27;s Heroes: Miro Višić, Jošo Durbaba, Boško Žunić, Stevo G. Opačić and Stevo S. Opačić.

====Socialist Yugoslavia====
Between 1945 and 1990, Knin saw rapid industrialization and modernization, becoming a centre of a wider region. Una railway was opened in 1948 and Knin-Zadar railway in 1967, making Knin train station one of the most important and busiest hubs in Croatia.

====Croatian War of Independence====
On 8 July 1989, a large Serb nationalist rally was held in Knin, during which banners threatening Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army intervention in Croatia, as well as Chetnik iconography was displayed. From October 1990, eight months before Croatia declared independence (25 June 1991) from Yugoslavia, Knin became the main stronghold for the Serbs in the Knin region, eventually becoming the capital city of the unrecognized self-declared Republic of Serbian Krajina in 1991. The leaders of Krajina were Knin locals: Milan Martić and Milan Babić, both convicted for ethnic cleansing of Croats and other non-Serbs from Krajina by ICTY. Widespread acts of murder and violence, detention and intimidation became pervasive throughout the RSK territory from 1992 to 1995. During that time 93.9% of Croats were expelled from the town and municipality of Knin. Knin camp was a detention camp run by the Krajina Serbian Army, that held Croatian detainees, soldiers and civilians, from 1991 until 1992, during the Croatian War of Independence. Former prisoners testified that they were arrested by Serb paramilitary forces and then deported into Knin camp. The detainees were beaten, mistreated and humiliated. Serbs held the town until Croatian forces captured it during Operation Storm on 5 August 1995. The date is today marked as a Victory Day in Croatia.
In February 2015, during the Croatia–Serbia genocide case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) dismissed the Serbian lawsuit claim that Operation Storm constituted genocide ruling that Croatia did not have the specific intent to exterminate the country&#x27;s Serb minority, though it reaffirmed that serious crimes against Serb civilians had taken place. Fleeing civilians and people remaining in United Nations protected areas were subject to various forms of harassment, including military assaults and acts by Croatian civilians. On 8 August, a refugee column was shelled. Human Rights Watch reported, in 1996, that the vast majority of the abuses were committed by Croatian forces. These abuses, which continued on a large scale even months after Operation Storm, included summary executions of elderly and infirm Serbs who remained behind and the wholesale burning and destruction of Serbian villages and property. Executions of civilians took place in and around the town of Knin.

The majority of the population had already fled by the time the Croatian Army took control of Knin. At the end of the war, Knin&#x27;s demographic composition changed greatly with the influx of Croat refugees from Bosnia and former Croat militia members. They replaced, to a great extent, those Serbs who fled during Operation Storm. In 2015, Amnesty International report that Croatian Serbs continued to face discrimination in public sector employment and the restitution of tenancy rights to social housing vacated during the war.

==Geography==

Knin is located in the northern Dalmatian region of Croatia, 56 kilometres east of the coastal town of Šibenik, at .

The original Roman settlement developed on the foothills of the Dinaric Alps. It was on these foothills that the Knin Fortress was built. The source of the Krka river begins on the outskirts of the town.

==Climate==

Knin has a modified Mediterranean climate (Cfa, nearing the border with Csa) with hot dry summers and cool winters. Although the city is only some 50 km (31 mi) from the Adriatic Sea, an arm of the Mediterranean, the proximity of the Dinaric Alps to the north alters its climate. Knin is particularly known for its hot summers: temperatures reaching 40 °C (104 °F) are not uncommon in July and August. The January average temperature is about 4 °C and in August is about 24 °C

==Demographics==

According to 2021 census data, the population in Knin municipality was 11,755 and in town proper 8,317. 29.8% of population is of the age of 60 or older, while 18.6% of population is 20 or younger. Croatian Bureau of Statistics estimated the population of Knin municipality on 31 December 2020 to stand at 11,286. This represents a steep decline: ten years earlier, in the 2011 census, Knin municipality had a population of 15,388, while Knin (town, proper) had a population of 10,493. In the 2001 census, the population of Knin was 15,190 (whole municipality) with 11,128 in town proper. Ethnically, Croats formed the majority with 76.45% while the population share of Serbs stood at 20.8%.

Knin has recently seen a steep population decline, not least due to high emigration rates, especially since Croatia joined the EU in 2013 and its citizens consequently face few to no work and immigration restrictions. Elementary school student population in Knin (ages 6 to 14) has sharply declined by 29% between 2013 and 2019. Knin&#x27;s population is also in more flux than that of other Croatian cities given that it has a major refugee problem: both with a large number of Croats from neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina who immigrated there post-1995 and Serbs from Knin who are still refugees in Bosnia-Herzegovina or Serbia. Immigrant Croats form the majority in the city with only a scattered Serb presence in the surrounding villages.

===Demographic history===
Before the Croatian War of Independence 87% of the population of the municipality and 79% of the city were Serbs. During the war, most of the non-Serb population was displaced from Knin, while in the last days of the war most of the Serbs left Knin, fearing incoming Croatian forces. In February 2015, during the Croatia–Serbia genocide case, the judgment of the International Court of Justice stated that it is not disputed that a substantial part of the Serb population fled that region as a direct consequence of the military actions. The Croatian authorities were aware that the operation would provoke a mass exodus; they even to some extent predicated their military planning on such an exodus, which they considered not only probable, but desirable. As a consequence of the war and population displacement, Knin municipality population has nearly halved between 1991 and 2001 (from 23 to 15 thousand).

====Knin (municipality)====
Besides the town of Knin itself, Knin municipality today consists of following settlements: Golubić, Kninsko Polje, Kovačić, Ljubač, Oćestovo, Plavno, Polača, Potkonje, Radljevac, Strmica, Vrpolje and Žagrović. The data below and in the population graph is based on current municipality, since in the past Knin municipality often changed its borders.

====Knin (town)====
The town of Knin had a small population compared to its surroundings until the aftermath of World War II. Just 15% of population of municipality lived in Knin proper; neighbouring Plavno, Oćestovo and Polača had basically the same or even larger population than Knin. With increased urbanisation and industrialization in post-WWII socialist era (1945-1991), Knin urban population rapidly increased from 2,600 to 12,300. At that point, more than a half of municipality&#x27;s population lived in the town of Knin. After 1991, due to the war and population displacement, as well as transition shock and deindustrialization, population has been steadily declining.

The 1857 data show that 75.55% of the town&#x27;s population was Roman Catholic. According to the Austrian Census held in 1900, the town of Knin had 1,302 residents. In 1910 the town had 1,270 citizens. After 1945, with urbanization and modernization, Knin attracted much of the countryside population which was overwhelmingly Serbian Orthodox. As a consequence, ethnic/religious composition of town changed as well. Intermarriages and a desire to straddle the divide between the communities resulted at one point in a substantial part of the population declaring themselves as Yugoslavs rather than either Croats or Serbs (22% in 1981 census).
Population of the town from 1830 to 2011, based on religion, language and ethnicity was as follows:



==Archeology==
The recently discovered Roman town &quot;Burnum&quot; is 18 km away from Knin in direction of Kistanje. There are the remains of the biggest amphitheater in Dalmatia built in 77 AD, during the rule of Emperor Vespasian which could host 8,000 people.

The nearby villages Biskupija and Kapitul are extremely interesting archeological sites from the 10th century where many remains of medieval Croatian culture are found including churches, graves, decorations, and epigraphs.

==Sport==

The most successful sports in Knin lately have been track and field and martial arts. The latter is particularly popular with two taekwondo clubs active. Matea Jelić, Knin native (*1997) started practicing taekwando in Knin and later became 2020 Olympic champion in 67 kg. Track and field club &quot;Sv. Ante&quot; (St. Anthony) in Knin boasts Croatian 100m and 200m sprint as well as long jump national champion, Marko Čeko, who also won the Hanžeković memorial in 2020 in men&#x27;s long jump.

The main football club in Knin is NK Dinara, formed in 1913. NK Dinara&#x27;s colours were black and white until 2005 when the club changed its colours to red, white and blue. NK Dinara plays in the 4th, lowest division in Croatia, Šibenik-Knin County League (1. Županijska liga Šibensko-kninska).

Knin has a sports association which was formed in 1998. Basketball is also popular in Knin with an amateur women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s club playing in lower tiers. The Croatian National basketball team has played a match in Knin. They played against Israel in 1999 where Croatia won the match 78:68. Other sports played in Knin are rugby, handball, volleyball, kickboxing, karate, tennis and taekwondo.

In 2007 the Croatia national rugby union team beat an Irish Barbarians side to win their first ever trophy, the St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Cup organised by Alan Moore in Knin.

==Transport==
The most important intercity roadway in Knin is the Croatian state route D1. The route makes for easy access of Knin from the major coastal city of Split. The section of D1 from Knin to A1 highway will be upgraded to the expressway level in following years (with B1 expressway).
Knin is also an important railway junction as the railroads from the rest of Dalmatia and its cities of Zadar, Split and Šibenik pass through Knin, going north to the capital city of Croatia, Zagreb, via M604 railway. There are four lines meeting in Knin station: to Perković (and then to Split or Šibenik), to Zadar, to Ogulin (and onwards to Karlovac, Zagreb) and to Martin Brod (and Bihać, Sisak, Zagreb). Only the former three lines offer passenger transport. The latter route, Knin-Bihać-Zagreb, passes through Bosnian territory, crossing the border many times, thus it is not used for passenger transport since the beginning of the war in 1991. However, it is the shortest route between Knin and Zagreb, and as such was electrified in 1984 (the catenary being subsequently destroyed by war operations in the early 1990s). Electrification had started from Yugoslav inland towards the coast and had only reached Knin, so today the Knin station sidings are equipped with overhead catenary, but lines leaving the town are not.

<text>Skradin is a small town in the Šibenik-Knin County of Croatia. It is located near the Krka river and at the entrance to the Krka National Park, from Šibenik and from Split. The main attraction of the park, Slapovi Krke, is a series of waterfalls, the biggest of which, Skradinski buk, was named after Skradin.

==History==
During Antiquity, the city was known as &quot;Scardon&quot; and &quot;Scardona&quot;, a name attested in the writings of Strabo and Procopius (), Pliny the Elder () and Ptolemy ().

Before the Roman conquest, the settlement was Illyrian, with the particularity of having the locally recurring suffix &quot;-ona&quot;. The prevailing theory links the root of the Illyrian toponym to a term meaning &quot;steep&quot;, as a derivation of &quot;*sko/ard(h)-&quot;, and it has been compared with the Scardus mountains in southern Illyria. After an initial development in Vulgar Latin in the form &quot;-una&quot;, the Illyrian suffix was reflected in South Slavic as &quot;-in&quot;. The survival of several of such toponyms in the area (e.g. Solin from Salona, Labin from Albona etc) points to the continuation of Illyrian settlements since ancient times. Another, more peripheral, theory says the root of the name might be related to that of the Scordisci, a Celtic or Illyrian tribe. Though initially located in present-day Eastern Slavonia and Syrmia, the Scordisci might have been allied with the local tribe of the Dalmatae, as mercenaries, which would explain their presence in Dalmatia.

After the Roman conquest, Skradin became an administrative and military centre of the region, and was mentioned as a municipium in 530. It was destroyed during the Migration Period, and had by the 9th century been settled by Croats.

During the 10th century, it was one of the fortified towns in Croatia, as the centre of the Skradin županija.

===Skradin under Šubić rule===

In the late 13th and early 14th centuries, Skradin flourished as the capital of the Šubić bans, Paul I and Mladen II. The Šubić&#x27;s built the Turina fortress on the hill overlooking the Skradin harbor. They elevated the settlement below the fortress to a free city, at which point it also became a commune, and was granted its own statute and administration. They further enriched the city by constructing several richly-endowed monasteries which housed the Dominicans, Franciscans and other Christian orders.

===Decline and Ottoman conquest===

Skradin was conquered by the Ottomans in 1522 and remain part of the Ottoman Empire until 1684, with a few interruptions. During the Ottoman–Venetian wars, the town was devastated and subsequently relocated.

In October 1683, some uskoks from Venetian Dalmatia, mainly Morlachs from Ravni Kotari, rose up against the Sanjak-bey of Klis and took Skradin and several other border towns which had been deserted by their Ottoman Muslim population, who was fearing an attack by the Morlachs. The Venetians finally took Skradin in 1684 and the town recovered under their rule, during the 18th century, becoming the center of a municipality in 1705.

Later, it was occupied by Napoleon as part of the French Empire, then Austria-Hungary.

In time it lost its importance as the centre of the region, which shifted to Šibenik, and so it stagnated - the Diocese of Skradin was abandoned in 1828.

<text>Ust-Izhora () is a municipal settlement in Kolpinsky District of the federal city of St. Petersburg, Russia, situated at the confluence of the Izhora and Neva Rivers, and is roughly equidistant to St. Petersburg and Shlisselburg, Russia, from both the Gulf of Finland in the west and Lake Ladoga in the northeast. Population: 

The settlement is believed to mark the location of the Battle of the Neva (July 15, 1240), when weak forces led by Prince Alexander Yaroslavich of Novgorod defeated the Swedes here, and prevented them from advancing farther south into Ingria. The chronicles tell of a &quot;great battle,&quot; in which Alexander&#x27;s men stormed and sank three Swedish ships, and Alexander himself wounded Birger, the Swedish commander.

Following this victory on the Neva, the prince was renamed Alexander Nevsky. The Russian Orthodox Church eventually canonized him, and he is now the patron saint of Saint Petersburg. A church was built on the bank of the Neva in 1799 to commemorate the famous battle. Close by the church are two monuments honoring Alexander Nevsky, in whose memory the church is dedicated.

<text>The Bosnia Vilayet (Serbo-Croatian: Bosanski vilajet/Vilajet Bosna) was a first-level administrative division (vilayet) of the Ottoman Empire, mostly comprising the territory of the present-day state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with minor parts of modern Montenegro. It bordered Kosovo Vilayet to the south. Before the administrative reform in 1867, it was called the Bosnia Eyalet. In the late 19th century it reportedly had an area of .

It effectively ceased to exist as an Ottoman province after the Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, although it formally existed for thirty more years until 1908, despite being governed by Austria-Hungary. This excluded Old Herzegovina, which was ceded to the Principality of Montenegro in 1878. In 1908, during the Bosnian Crisis, Austria-Hungary formally annexed it into its own territory.

<text>The Emperor&#x27;s Mosque (Bosnian: &quot;Careva džamija&quot;/&quot;Царева џамија&quot;, Turkish: &quot;Hünkâr Camii&quot;) is an important landmark in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, being the first mosque to be built (1457) after the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia. It is the largest single-subdome mosque in Bosnia and Herzegovina, built in the classical Ottoman style of the era.

It was built by one Isaković-Hranušić who dedicated it to the Sultan, Mehmed the Conqueror, the conqueror of Constantinople. Considered one of the most beautiful mosques of the Ottoman period in the Balkans, the mosque features a roomy interior and high quality decorative details, such as the mihrab.

==History==
The original mosque was built in the mid-15th century. Damaged and totally destroyed by the end of that century, it was rebuilt in 1565 and dedicated this time to Suleiman the Magnificent.

The first mosque was made of wood and significantly smaller than the existing building that was built in 1565. Side rooms were added in 1800 and connected to the central prayer area in 1848. Between 1980 and 1983, the painted decorations in the interior of the mosque were conserved and restored. The burial ground (graveyard) beside the Emperor&#x27;s Mosque contains the graves of viziers, mullahs, muftis, sheikhs, the employees in the Emperor&#x27;s Mosque, along with other prominent figures living in Sarajevo.

The mosque was damaged during World War II but mostly in the wars during the 1990s, and renovation work was completed in 2020.

The first settlements in Sarajevo were built around the mosque with the residence of the Sultan&#x27;s representatives than being built next to the mosque. Isa-bey also built a hammam (public bath) and a bridge that led directly to the mosque. This bridge was disassembled during the Austro-Hungarian government and rebuilt just a few meters upstream where it still exists today.

On the other side of the river, he built a caravanserai. For the financing of these facilities, Isa-bey left a heritage of many shops, land and properties.

<text>The Izhora (, ), also known as the Inger, is a left tributary of the Neva on its run through Ingria in northwestern Russia from Lake Ladoga to the Gulf of Finland. The Izhora flows through Gatchinsky and Tosnensky Districts of Leningrad Oblast as well as through Pushkinsky and Kolpinsky Districts of the federal city of Saint Petersburg. The settlement of Ust-Izhora (lit. &quot;mouth of Izhora&quot;) is situated at the confluence of Izhora and Neva, halfway between Saint Petersburg and Shlisselburg. The towns of Kommunar and Kolpino are located on the Izhora as well. The river is noted as the farthest Swedish forces ever reached between the Viking Age and the Time of Troubles.

The length of the Izhora is , and the area of its drainage basin is . The river draws its water mainly from natural groundwater springs, snow melt, and rain water. The river has a sustainable underground water supply in both summer and winter, never drying up or freezing through.

The source of the Izhora is located on the Izhora Plateau at the village of , northwest of the town of Gatchina. The Izhora flows to the east, passes at the northern outskirts of Gatchina, and east of Kommunar enters Tosnensky District. There, for a short stretch it makes the border between Saint Petersburg (north) and Leningrad Oblast (south), returns to the oblast and gradually turns north. In Kolpino, the Izhora enters the federal city of Saint Petersburg. There, it flow north and joins the Neva in the settlement of Ust-Izhora.

The drainage basin of the Izhora includes the northern parts of Gatchinsky and Tosnensky Districts, as well as some areas within Saint Petersburg.

<text>Neroli Susan Fairhall (26 August 1944 – 11 June 2006) was a New Zealand athlete, who was the first paraplegic competitor in the Olympic Games.

==Biography==
Born in Christchurch in 1944, Fairhall took up archery following a motorbike accident that paralysed her from the waist down, ending her previous athletic career.

Fairhall won gold when archery was first introduced to the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane in 1982.

She finished in 35th place at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. Fairhall was the first paraplegic to compete in the Olympic Games.

Fairhall was a multiple national champion and won medals and held titles at the Paralympics, IPC-Archery World Championships and many international tournaments. She participated in four Summer Paralympics, in 1972, 1980, 1988, and 2000. At her first Paralympic Games she competed in track and field athletics. At the 1980 Games, she took part in both athletics and archery, winning a gold medal in the latter sport. At the 1988 and 2000 Paralympics she competed in archery only.

In the 1983 New Year Honours, Fairhall was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to archery and the disabled. She continued to coach at her Christchurch archery club after retiring from shooting. She died on 11 June 2006, aged 61, due to illness arising from her disability.

<doc id="864998" wikidata="Q983334" url="?curid=864998" title="Khamsing Srinawk">
<text>Khamsing Srinawk (, , ) is a writer from the Isan region of Thailand. He writes under the pen name Lao Khamhom (, ). He was named a National Artist in Literature in 1992 and is best known for his satirical short stories published in his 1958 collection &quot;Fa Bo Kan&quot; (, ) [&#x27;The Sky is No Barrier&#x27;]. Benedict Anderson argues that Khamsing is the best known short story writer in Thailand.

==Early life==
Born 25 December 1930 in Bua Yai District of Thailand&#x27;s northeastern Nakhon Ratchasima Province, Khamsing was raised on a farm in the countryside. Khamsing read heavily during his childhood and was encouraged in his studies by his uncle, a Buddhist monk, and other members of his family.

He was the sixth of seven children by his parents Suay and Kham Srinawk. After completing schooling in the local Bua Yai government school, he traveled to Bangkok and simultaneously enrolled in the faculty of journalism at Chulalongkorn University and the faculty of economics at Thammasat University. Unable to afford room and board, Khamsing lived in a Buddhist temple in Bangkok while attending night classes and working part time as a journalist until he was overcome with illness and forced to drop out of school. As a journalist, he served as a political reporter and feature writer. He saw journalism as a way to improve society. The first paper he worked for was &quot;Naew Na&quot;. Newspapers were Khamsing&#x27;s entry to the literary world of Bangkok and he would use these connections to begin publishing his work. His personal farm in Pak Chong District, Nakhon Ratchasima, became a refuge in times of crisis or government suppression of intellectuals, especially in the late-1950s and on his return from exile in the early-1980s. The farm produced corn, cotton, and milk using &quot;modern&quot; methods. It also may have added a mystique to Khamsing&#x27;s persona as one who could shift between rural and urban contexts seamlessly. More importantly, his farm in later years became a place for young writers to come to learn the craft. From Bangkok, Khamsing took a job with the state forestry service, working in the far north as a forest ranger for three years (1953–1956). Herbert Phillips, who knew Khamsing, said that it was a time when the author &quot;thrived – psychologically, physically, and as a reader and writer.&quot; On his return to Bangkok, he worked for a Cornell anthropology research project with Phillips and others. He took odd jobs as a traveling sewing machine salesman. He even briefly opened his own publishing house named Kwian Thong (&#x27;Golden Oxcart&#x27;).

==Publication of &quot;Fa Bo Kan&quot;==
A year after his stint in the forestry service, Khamsing began publishing short stories in the newspaper &quot;Piyamit&quot; () [&#x27;Dear Friend&#x27;]. Other publications where his work appeared include: &quot;Chiwit&quot;, &quot;Sangkhommasat Parithat&quot;, &quot;Khwan Chai&quot; and &quot;Chatturat&quot;. This corresponded with the relatively free press Thailand enjoyed during the years 1955–1958. Due to the political power-struggle between CIA-backed Phao Sriyanond and Pentagon-supported Sarit Thanarat, Thai writers and intellectuals were free to express their ideas. This atmosphere of free press quickly evaporated after the 16 September 1957 coup that drove Phao and Plaek Pibulsonggram into exile. Anderson argues that Khamsing&#x27;s &quot;Fa Bo Kan&quot;, a collection of many of his stories originally published in &quot;Piyamit&quot;, best symbolizes this period of intellectual freedom. Shortly after the publication of &quot;Fa Bo Kan&quot;, Sarit seized power and established an absolute regime. Sarit&#x27;s regime reinstated strict censorship, ending the period of free thought through imprisonment, exile, and execution of Thai intellectuals, writers, and progressives. This crackdown on progressives and the independent press forced Khamsing to abandon writing for a number of years, during which time he returned to Nakhon Ratchasima to his farm.

==Travels abroad and return==
In 1967–1968 Khamsing was awarded a Time-Life grant to visit the US. He spent the year working with the publishing house. On his way back to Thailand he visited France, Germany, Israel, and the Ivory Coast, apparently as an official guest studying literary and agricultural activities. He was able to lecture at several universities on his work and contemporary Thai literature. After his return to Thailand, Suchat Sawatsi invited him to contribute regularly to &quot;Sangkhommasat Parithat&quot; () [&#x27;Social Science Review&#x27;]. These articles, many of which were concerned with social injustice in rural Thailand, were compiled in a 1975 publication known as &quot;Kamphaeng&quot; (, ) [&#x27;Walls&#x27;]. Suchat, along with Sulak Sivaraksa rediscovered the work of Khamsing after a visit to his farm, which led to the republication of &quot;Fa Bo Kan&quot; and his writing was disseminated in magazines of university literary clubs.

In 1970 Khamsing was married to Prawee. They would subsequently have three daughters together.

==Political action and exile==
Khamsing continued writing and working on his farm in Nakhon Ratchasima until the beginning of the 1973 student democracy movement. After the military and police crackdown on student demonstrations at Thammasat University on 14 October 1973, Khamsing became politically active and was elected vice-chairman of the Socialist Party of Thailand. It is said that on two occasions in the early-1970s, Khamsing sold off many of his milking cows to finance unsuccessful campaigns for election to Thai parliament. In 1975 a Committee for the Revision of Textbooks in the Ministry of Education sought to revise the school curriculum to emphasize the role of average people in society. As a result, on 17 May a new reading list for Mathayom Suksa 4 and 5 was published in Sayam Rat which made the work of Khamsing, along with fifteen others, part of the mandatory reading.

After the Thammasat University massacre of 6 October 1976, Khamsing fled with many others to the jungle, eventually making his way to Laos. His work was banned by the incoming government. Several months later, in 1977 he went into exile with his family to Sweden after a disagreement with the Communist Party of Thailand. In Sweden he was made a member of the Swedish Association of Writers and was able to promote his work in Europe. While in exile, he went on a lecture tour in the US. He also began again working on his first novel &quot;Maeo&quot; (, ) [&#x27;Cat&#x27;], which is a metaphor for Thailand itself. Khamsing first began working on &quot;Maeo&quot; after the events of 14 October 1973, but he manuscript was lost in the turmoil of 1976. Eventually, the novel was published in 1983 after Khamsing returned to Bangkok in 1981.

==Influence on Thai literature==
Even though he is not a prolific author, Khamsing is credited with starting a shift in Thai literary style and focus. While the majority of Thai literature before the 20th century was dominated by royal and elite authors writing for the kingdom&#x27;s gentry, Khamsing&#x27;s divergence from typical Thai literary subject matter created the concept of the Thai peasant as hero. By giving voice to the common peasant, often in the vernacular in the village setting, Khamsing&#x27;s writings, most notably &quot;Fa Bo Kan,&quot; worked to democratize Thai literature. In his works, Khamsing has depicted the plight of the Thai peasant, and in so doing, seek social justice and the betterment of Thai society in general. His writing is seen as a preeminent example of the &quot;life as art&quot; movement advocated by Jit Phumisak. His work has been listed as among the best in a century of the Thai short story. In 1992 the National Cultural Commission, with royal support, awarded him the title &quot;National Artist of Thailand in Literature,&quot; including a stipend for life. His work is now featured in the national school curriculum. His work has been translated into nine languages, including English, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Japanese, Singhalese, Malay, German, and French. His English translators have included Michael Smythes, Herbert Phillips, and Domnern Garden.

In May 2011, Khamsing added his name to what has come to be called the &quot;Thai Writers&#x27; Manifesto&quot;, a petition signed by 359 Thai writers and academics calling for drastic revisions to Thailand&#x27;s lèse majesté laws (Article 112 of current Thai Criminal Code), under which numerous Thai and others have been jailed.

<text>Kannur () is one of the 14 districts along the west coast in the state of Kerala, India. The city of Kannur is the district headquarters and gives the district its name. The old name, Cannanore, is the anglicized form of the Malayalam name &quot;Kannur&quot;. Kannur district is bounded by Kasaragod District to the north, Kozhikode district to the south, Mahé district to the southwest and Wayanad District to the southeast. To the east, the district is bounded by the Western Ghats, which forms the border with the state of Karnataka (Kodagu district). The Arabian Sea lies to the west. Paithalmala is the highest point in Kannur District (1,372m). Enclosed within the southern part of the district is the Mahé district of the Union Territory of Puducherry. The district was established in 1957.

Kannur Municipal Corporation is the sixth-largest urban local body in the state and Kannur Cantonment is the only Cantonment Board in Kerala. Indian Naval Academy at Ezhimala is the Asia&#x27;s largest, and the world&#x27;s third-largest, naval academy. Muzhappilangad beach is the longest Drive-In Beach in Asia and is featured among the top 6 best beaches for driving in the world in BBC article for Autos. Kannur district is home to some forts which include St. Angelo Fort, and Tellicherry Fort. Thalassery town in the district is known for the Thalassery pepper.

Kannur is the sixth-most urbanised district in Kerala, with more than 50% of its residents living in urban areas. Kannur has an urban population of 1,640,986, which is the second largest in Kerala after Ernakulam district. It was part of the Malabar District under the Madras province during the British Raj.

==Formation==
Following the formation of the state of Kerala in 1956, the erstwhile Malabar District was divided into three: Kannur District, Kozhikode district, and Palakkad district. On 1 November 1980, the North Wayanad Taluk of Kannur district was separated to form Wayanad district. Again in 1984, Kasaragod and Hosdurg Taluks were separated to form Kasargod district.

==History==

===Pre-history and Ancient Era===
The earliest evidence of human habitation in the district are rock-cut caves and megalithic burial sites of the Neolithic age. The Taliparamba-Kannur-Thalassery area abounds in rock-cut caves, dolmens, burial stone circles and menhirs, all of megalith. Kannur was the seat of powerful kingdom based at Ezhimala in the Sangam period (1st–5th century CE). The ancient port of &quot;Naura&quot;, which is mentioned in the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; as a port somewhere north of Muziris is identified with Kannur.

The kingdom of Ezhimala had jurisdiction over two &quot;Nadu&quot;s - The coastal &quot;Poozhinadu&quot; and the hilly eastern &quot;Karkanadu&quot;. According to the works of Sangam literature, &quot;Poozhinadu&quot; consisted much of the coastal belt between Mangalore and Kozhikode. &quot;Karkanadu&quot; consisted of Wayanad-Gudalur hilly region with parts of Kodagu (Coorg). It is said that Nannan, the most renowned ruler of Ezhimala dynasty, took refuge at Wayanad hills in the 5th century CE when he was lost to Cheras, just before his execution in a battle, according to the Sangam works.

===Early Middle Ages===
Ezhimala kingdom was succeeded by Mushika dynasty in the early medieval period, most possibly due to the migration of Tuluva Brahmins from Tulu Nadu. The &quot;Mushika-vamsha Mahakavya&quot;, written by Athula in the 11th century, throws light on the recorded past of the Mushika Royal Family up until that point. The Indian anthropologist Ayinapalli Aiyappan states that a powerful and warlike clan of the Bunt community of Tulu Nadu was called &quot;Kola Bari&quot; and the Kolathiri Raja of Kolathunadu was a descendant of this clan. The Kolathunadu (Kannur) Kingdom at the peak of its power, reportedly extended from Netravati River (Mangalore) in the north to Korapuzha (Kozhikode) in the south with Arabian Sea on the west and Kodagu hills on the eastern boundary, also including the isolated islands of Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea.

An Old Malayalam inscription (Ramanthali inscriptions), dated to 1075 CE, mentioning king Kunda Alupa, the ruler of Alupa dynasty of Mangalore, can be found at Ezhimala (the former headquarters of Mushika dynasty) near Kannur. The Arabic inscription on a copper slab within the Madayi Mosque in Kannur records its foundation year as 1124 CE. In his book on travels (&quot;Il Milione&quot;), Marco Polo recounts his visit to the area in the mid 1290s. Other visitors included Faxian, the Buddhist pilgrim and Ibn Batuta, writer and historian of Tangiers.

===Late Middle Ages===

Until the 16th century CE, the Kasargod town was known by the name &quot;Kanhirakode&quot; (may be by the meaning, &#x27;The land of &quot;Kanhira&quot; Trees&#x27;) in Malayalam. The Kumbla dynasty, who swayed over the land of southern Tulu Nadu wedged between Chandragiri River and Netravati River (including present-day Taluks of Manjeshwar and Kasaragod) from &quot;Maipady Palace&quot; at Kumbla, had also been vassals to the Kolathunadu, before the Carnatic conquests of Vijayanagara Empire. The Kumbla dynasty had a mixed lineage of Malayali Nairs and Tuluva Brahmins. They also claimed their origin from Cheraman Perumals of Kerala. Francis Buchanan-Hamilton states that the customs of Kumbla dynasty were similar to those of the contemporary Malayali kings, though Kumbla was considered as the southernmost region of Tulu Nadu. Just like other contemporary kings of Kerala in the medieval period, The powerful Kolathu Raja also came under the influence of Zamorin later. The Kolathunadu in the late medieval period emerged into independent 10 principalities i.e., Kadathanadu (Vadakara), Randathara or Poyanad (Dharmadom), Kottayam (Thalassery), Nileshwaram, Iruvazhinadu (Panoor, Kurumbranad etc., under separate royal chieftains due to the outcome of internal dissensions. The Nileshwaram dynasty on the northernmost part of Kolathiri dominion, were relatives to both Kolathunadu as well as the Zamorin of Calicut, in the early medieval period.
===Colonial era===
Kannur was an important trading center in the 12th century with active business connections with Persia and Arabia. The port at Kozhikode held the superior economic and political position in medieval Kerala coast, while Kannur, Kollam, and Kochi, were commercially important secondary ports, where the traders from various parts of the world would gather. Kannur served as the British military headquarters on India&#x27;s west coast until 1887. In conjunction with her sister city, Tellicherry, it was the third-largest city on the western coast of British India in the 18th century after Bombay and Karachi. The Arakkal kingdom had right over the city of Kannur and Laccadive Islands in the late medieval period.

The Portuguese arrived at Kappad Kozhikode in 1498 during the Age of Discovery, thus opening a direct sea route from Europe to India. The St. Angelo Fort at Kannur was built in 1505 by Dom Francisco de Almeida, the first Portuguese Viceroy of India. The Dutch captured the fort from the Portuguese in 1663. They modernized the fort and built the bastions Hollandia, Zeelandia, and Frieslandia that are the major features of the present structure. The original Portuguese fort was pulled down later. A painting of this fort and the fishing ferry behind it can be seen in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. The Dutch sold the fort to the king Ali Raja of Arakkal in 1772. The British conquered it in 1790 and used it as one of their major military stations on the Malabar Coast.

During the 17th century, Kannur was the capital city of the only Muslim polity in the Far-South of India – Arakkal – who also ruled the Laccadive Islands in addition to the city of Kannur. Arakkal Kingdom and Chirakkal kingdom were two vassal kingdoms based in the city of Kannur. The island of Dharmadom near Kannur, along with Thalassery, was ceded to the East India Company as early as 1734, which were claimed by all of the &quot;Kolattu Rajas&quot;, &quot;Kottayam Rajas&quot;, &quot;Mannanar&quot; and &quot; Arakkal Bibi&quot; in the late medieval period, where the British initiated a factory and English settlement following the cession. In 1761, the British captured Mahé, and the settlement was handed over to the ruler of Kadathanadu. The British restored Mahé to the French as a part of the 1763 Treaty of Paris. In 1779, the Anglo-French war broke out, resulting in the French loss of Mahé. In 1783, the British agreed to restore to the French their settlements in India, and Mahé was handed over to the French in 1785.

During the British Raj, Kannur was part of the Madras province in the Malabar District. Initially the British had to suffer local resistance against their rule under the leadership of Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja, who had popular support in Thalassery-Wayanad region. The municipalities of Kannur and Thalassery were formed on 1 November 1866 according to the Madras Act 10 of 1865 (Amendment of the Improvements in Towns act 1850) of the British Indian Empire, along with the municipalities of Kozhikode, Palakkad, and Fort Kochi, making them the first modern municipalities in the modern state of Kerala.

This confluence of culinary cultures is best seen in the preparation of most dishes. &quot;Kallummakkaya&quot; (mussels) curry, &quot;irachi puttu&quot; (&quot;irachi&quot; meaning meat), &quot;parottas&quot; (soft flatbread), &quot;Pathiri&quot; (a type of rice pancake) and &quot;ghee&quot; rice are some of the other specialties. The characteristic use of spices is the hallmark of the cuisine—black pepper, cardamom and clove are used profusely.

The Kerala version of biryani, popularly known as &quot;kuzhi mandi&quot; in Malayalam is another popular item, which has an influence from Yemen. Various varieties of &quot;biriyanis&quot; like Thalassery &quot;biriyani&quot;, and Kannur &quot;biriyani&quot;, are prepared here.
The snacks include &quot;unnakkaya&quot; (deep-fried, boiled ripe banana paste covering a mixture of cashew, raisins and sugar), &quot;pazham nirachathu&quot; (ripe banana filled with coconut grating, molasses or sugar), &quot;muttamala&quot; made of eggs, &quot;chatti pathiri&quot;, a dessert made of flour, like a baked, layered &quot;chapati&quot; with rich filling, &quot;arikkadukka&quot;, and more.

==Kuttiattoor Mango==
Kuttiattoor mango is popular and traditional cultivar of Kuttiattoor and neighbouring panchayats of Kannur district. Kuttiattoor mango received Geographical Indication (GI) tag from the GI registry at Chennai. The distinctiveness of Kuttiattoor mango is aided by the combination of specific environmental conditions of the area of its cultivation and varietal characters. Even though it is popularly known as Kuttiattoor mango, it is also known as ‘Nambiar mānga’, ‘Kannapuram mānga’, ‘Kunjimangalam mānga’ and ‘Vadakkumbhagam mānga’ in small pockets of Kannur district.

Other departments, including Engineering and Dentistry, were established sequentially, forming the university as it is known today. Now KNU operate PPE programme.

== Administration ==
As of November 20, 2021, Won-hwa Hong is the university&#x27;s President. He graduated from the KNU Department of Architecture and acquired master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees at Waseda University in Japan. The university has three vice presidents: Vice President for Academic Affairs, Vice President for External Affairs, and Vice President for Research &amp; University-Industry Cooperation. Additionally, there are about ten deans overseeing various administrative areas, including Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, Strategy &amp; Finance, Research &amp; Industry Collaboration, International Affairs, Admissions, External Cooperation, Information &amp; Technology, Education Reform, and Graduate School Policy. The Office of General Administration handles personnel, budget, and facilities management.

== Symbols ==
The symbolic animal of Kyungpook National University is the &#x27;Hobanwoo (칡소),&#x27; a traditional Korean bull with a striped tiger-skin pattern. In June 2014, after conducting a public contest and a preference survey among students, faculty, and alumni, the university ultimately chose &#x27;Hobanwoo&#x27; as its official symbol.

<doc id="865062" wikidata="Q737917" url="?curid=865062" title="Duduk">
<text>The duduk ( ; ) or tsiranapogh (, meaning &quot;apricot-made wind instrument&quot;), is a double reed woodwind instrument made of apricot wood originating from Armenia. Variations of the Armenian duduk appear throughout the Caucasus, the Balkans, and the Middle East, including Bulgaria, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kurdistan, Turkey, and Iran. Duduk, Balaban, and Mey are almost identical, except for historical and geographical differences.

It is commonly played in pairs: while the first player plays the melody, the second plays a steady drone called &quot;dum&quot;, and the sound of the two instruments together creates a richer, more haunting sound. The unflattened reed and cylindrical body produce a sound closer to the English horn than the oboe or bassoon. Unlike other double reed instruments like the oboe or shawm, the duduk has a very large reed proportional to its size.

UNESCO proclaimed the Armenian duduk and its music as a Masterpiece of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2005 and inscribed it in 2008. Duduk music has been used in a number of films, most notably in &quot;The Russia House&quot; and &quot;Gladiator&quot;.

==Etymology==
There have been two published lines of thinking on the origins of the word.

Both the Russian book &quot;Musical Instruments Encyclopedia&quot; (Музыкальные инструменты. Энциклопедия) and American book &quot;Musical Instruments, A Comprehensive Dictionary&quot; give an ultimate origin of the name as Persian, the word &quot;tutak&quot;. 

In Armenia, the instrument is also known as &quot;tsiranapogh&quot; ().

This instrument is not to be confused with the northwestern Bulgarian folk instrument of the same name (see below, Balkan duduk). Similar instruments used in other parts of Western Asia are the &quot;mey&quot; and &quot;balaban&quot;.

==Overview==

The duduk is a double reed instrument with ancient origins, having existed since at least the fifth century, while there are Armenian scholars who believe it existed more than 1,500 years before that. The earliest instruments similar to the duduk&#x27;s present form are made of bone or entirely of cane. Today, the duduk is exclusively made of wood with a large double reed, with the body made from aged apricot wood.

The particular tuning depends heavily on the region in which it is played. An eight-hole duduk (not counting the thumb hole on the lower side) can play ten successive notes of a diatonic scale with simple fingering, or sixteen consecutive notes of a chromatic scale by half-covering holes. For example, an A duduk can play all the notes from F♯ to the A more than an octave higher. (Another reference gives different information.) By using the lips to &quot;bend&quot; notes and partially covering holes any pitch in this range can be produced, as required for Oriental music. The instrument&#x27;s body has different lengths depending upon the range of the instrument and region. The reed (Armenian: , &quot;eġegn&quot;), is made from one or two pieces of cane in a duck-bill type assembly. Unlike other double-reed instruments, the reed is quite wide, helping to give the duduk both its unique, mournful sound, as well as its remarkable breathing requirements. The duduk player is called &quot;dudukahar&quot; () in Armenian.

The performers use air stored in their cheeks to keep playing the instrument while they inhale air into their lungs. This &quot;circular&quot; breathing technique is commonly used with all the double-reed instruments in the Middle East.

Duduk &quot;is invariably played with the accompaniment of a second &quot;dum duduk&quot;, which gives the music an energy and tonic atmosphere, changing the scale harmoniously with the principal duduk.&quot;

Armenian musicologists cite evidence of the duduk&#x27;s use as early as 1200 BC, though Western scholars suggest it is 1,500 years old. Variants of the duduk can be found in Armenia and the Caucasus. The history of the Armenian duduk music is dated to the reign of the Armenian king Tigran the Great, who reigned from 95 to 55 B.C. According to ethnomusicologist Dr. Jonathan McCollum, the instrument is depicted in numerous Armenian manuscripts of the Middle Ages, and is &quot;actually the only truly Armenian instrument that&#x27;s survived through history, and as such is a symbol of Armenian national identity ... The most important quality of the duduk is its ability to express the language dialectic and mood of the Armenian language, which is often the most challenging quality to a duduk player.&quot;

==Balkan duduk==
While &quot;duduk&quot; most commonly refers to the double reed instrument described on this page, there is a very similar instrument played in northwestern Bulgaria. This is a blocked-end flute known as a kaval, resembling the Serbian frula, or kavalče in a part of Macedonia, and as duduk in northwest Bulgaria. Made of maple or other wood, it comes in two sizes: and (duduce). The blocked end is flat.

==In popular culture==

The sound of the duduk has become known to wider audiences through its use in popular film soundtracks. Starting with Peter Gabriel&#x27;s score for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;, the duduk&#x27;s archaic and mournful sound has been employed in a variety of genres to depict such moods. Djivan Gasparyan played the duduk in &quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;Syriana&quot;, and &quot;Blood Diamond&quot;, among others. It was also used extensively in &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. In the TV series &quot;&quot;, its computer-altered sound was given to the fictitious &quot;Tsungi horn&quot;, most notably played by Iroh and often being featured in the show&#x27;s soundtrack. With many of the members who worked on now working on &quot;The Dragon Prince&quot;, the duduk regularly appears in its soundtrack as well. The sound of the duduk was also used in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; for a lullaby which Mr. Tumnus plays on a fictitious double flute and in the theme song of the Dothraki clan during the TV adaptation &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

Armenia&#x27;s entry in the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest, &quot;Apricot Stone,&quot; featured Armenian musician Djivan Gasparyan playing the duduk.

<text>Isabelle of Orléans-Braganza (Isabelle Marie Amélie Louise Victoire Thérèse Jeanne; 13 August 1911 – 5 July 2003) was the consort of the Orléanist pretender to the French throne, Henri, Count of Paris, and the daughter of Pedro de Alcântara, Prince of Grão-Pará, pretender to the throne of the Empire of Brazil.

==Early life==

Born on 13 August 1911, Isabelle Marie Amélie Louise Victoire Thérèse Jeanne of Orléans-Braganza was the eldest daughter of &quot;Dom&quot; Pedro de Alcântara, Prince of Grão-Pará, erstwhile heir to the throne of the Empire of Brazil, and his wife, Countess Elisabeth Dobrzensky of Dobrzenicz. Her father was the eldest son of Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, the elder daughter and heiress of Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, and Prince Gaston of Orléans, Count of Eu, grandson of Louis Philippe I, the &quot;citizen king&quot; of the French. Isabelle was born in a pavilion on the grounds of the Château d&#x27;Eu, her paternal grandfather&#x27;s home in the town of Eu in the Seine-Maritime department of France in Normandy. She was named after her paternal grandmother, the Princess Imperial.

In 1891, Dom Pedro de Alcântara became Prince Imperial of Brazil to royalists when his mother became claimant to the throne upon the death of the emperor in exile. In 1908, he renounced his succession rights, and those of his descendants, to marry Bohemian noblewoman Countess Elisabeth Dobrzensky of Dobrzenicz. Though his mother withheld dynastic consent, his parents attended his wedding. However, with the agreement of the Duke of Orléans, Head of the House of Orléans to which he belonged paternally, he and his descendants retained the right to use the title Prince/ss of Orléans-Braganza.

After the deaths of her maternal grandparents, Isabelle&#x27;s parents moved from the &quot;Pavillon des Ministres&quot; on the castle grounds into the main &quot;Chateau&quot;. They spent the winter months in a townhouse in Boulogne-sur-Seine. In 1924, her father&#x27;s cousin, Prince Adam Czartoryski, placed at the family&#x27;s disposal, apartments in the palatial &quot;Hôtel Lambert&quot; on the Île Saint-Louis in Paris, where Isabelle and her siblings undertook their studies. The family travelled extensively and much of Isabelle&#x27;s youth was spent visiting her maternal relatives at their large estate at Chotěboř, Czechoslovakia, Attersee, Austria, and Goluchow, Poland. With her father, Isabelle visited Naples, Constantinople, Rhodes, Smyrna, Lebanon, Syria, Cairo, Palestine and Jerusalem.

In 1920, Brazil lifted the law of banishment against its former dynasty and invited them to bring home the remains of Pedro II, although Isabelle&#x27;s grandfather, the Count of Eu, died at sea during the voyage. But after annual visits over the next decade, her parents decided to repatriate their family to Petropolis permanently, where Isabelle attended day school at Notre-Dame-de-Sion while the family took up residence at the old imperial Grão Pará Palace. Until then, Isabelle was privately educated by governesses and tutors.

==Marriage==
Isabelle first met her third cousin, Prince Henri of Orléans, heir to the Head of the House of Orléans, in 1920 at the home of the Duchess of Chartres, Henri&#x27;s grandmother who was also a cousin of both of Isabelle&#x27;s grandparents. In the summer of 1923, Henri was a guest at the &quot;Chateau d&#x27;Eu&quot;, at which time Isabelle, aged 12, resolved that she would one day marry him. However, he took no apparent notice of her at the wedding of his sister, Anne, to the Duke of Aosta at Naples in 1927. During a visit to his parents&#x27; home, the &quot;Manoir d&#x27;Anjou&quot; in Brussels, over Easter 1928, Henri began to show interest in Isabelle, and still more at a family reunion in July 1929.

Henri proposed to Isabelle on 10 August 1930 while taking part in a hunt at Count Dobržensky&#x27;s Chotěboř home. The couple kept their engagement a secret until a family gathering at Attersee later that summer, but were obliged by the Duke of Guise to wait until Henri finished his studies at Louvain University before the betrothal was officially announced 28 December 1930.

On 8 April 1931, Isabelle and Henri were married at Palermo Cathedral; she was 19, and he was 22. The wedding was held in Sicily, since the law of banishment against the heirs of France&#x27;s former dynasties had not yet been abrogated. The two families selected Palermo because Henri&#x27;s family owned a palace there, which had been the location of three earlier weddings. The wedding gave rise to several royalist demonstrations, and the road leading to the cathedral was lined with hundreds of visitors from France who viewed Henri as the rightful heir to the French throne. He was greeted with such cries as &quot;Vive le roi, Vive la France&quot; along with other monarchist cries and songs. These supporters were joined by 1,200 guests including members of the bride and groom&#x27;s families, along with representatives of other royal dynasties.

==Later life==

Henri became pretender to the throne of France upon the death of his father, the Duke of Guise, in 1940. In 1947, Henri and Isabel&#x27;s family took up residence at the &quot;Quinta do Anjinho&quot;, an estate in Sintra, on the Portuguese Riviera. In 1950, the law of banishment was repealed and the family moved to Paris. With five of their children they took part in the ship tour organized by King Paul of Greece and Queen Frederica in 1954, which became known as the &quot;Cruise of the Kings&quot; and was attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe.

Isabelle, called &quot;Madame&quot;, and her husband used the French Royal coat of arms. She survived her late husband by four years.

<doc id="865067" wikidata="Q16984980" url="?curid=865067" title="Hot water crust pastry">
<text>Hot water crust is a type of pastry used for savoury pies, such as pork pies, game pies, scotch pies and more rarely, steak and kidney pies. Hot water crust is traditionally used for producing hand-made pies.

As the name suggests, the pastry is made by heating water, melting the fat in it, bringing the mixture to a boil, and finally incorporating the flour. This can be done by beating the flour into the mixture in the pan, or by kneading on a pastry board. Either way, the result is a hot and rather sticky paste that can be used for hand-raising: shaping by hand, sometimes using a dish or bowl as an inner mould. The moulded crust retains its shape as it cools, and is prepared for baking with a filling and additional layer of pastry crust on top. Hand-raised hot water crust pastry does not produce a neat and uniform finish, as there will be sagging during the cooking of the filled pie. This is generally accepted as the mark of a hand-made pie. It is possible, however, to bake the pastry in a mould, as with other pies.

The pastry is often used to make pork pies or other heavy fillings, as, compared to other types of pastry, a hot water crust allows even very wet fillings to be held in.

<text>ISO/IEC 8802-5 is a joint ISO/IEC standard that defines Token Ring access methods and physical layer specifications. The ISO/IEC 8802-5:1998 standard, part of the Local and Metropolitan Area Network (LAN) series, aligns with the ISO/IEC Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference Model, focusing on the physical and data link layers. Its primary goal is to facilitate seamless interconnection of data processing equipment through a LAN employing the token-passing ring access method. The standard delineates the frame format, encompassing delimiters, addressing, and priority stacks. Additionally, it outlines the medium access control (MAC) protocol, supplemented by finite state machines and state tables, accompanied by algorithmic descriptions. The physical layer (PHY) functionalities, such as symbol encoding/decoding, symbol time, and latency buffering, are clearly defined. The standard elucidates the services offered by MAC to station management (SMT) and the reciprocal services provided by PHY to both SMT and MAC. Specifically tailored for commercial and light industrial applications, the LAN standard establishes guidelines for 4 and 16 Mbit/s shielded twisted pair attachments, including the medium interface connector (MIC). Notably, while token ring LANs in home and heavy industrial settings are not precluded, their consideration was not central to the standard&#x27;s development. The document includes a Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS) proforma in its annex.

<text>Mary E. Sawyer (c. 1846–1902), better known as Mollie Monroe, was an American old west woman who was known for crossdressing and for her liaisons with multiple men.

Monroe fell in love with a man as a teenager. Both her family and her boyfriend&#x27;s family agreed that the couple was too young to marry, and the man was sent away. Monroe then decided to go after her boyfriend, disguised as a man and calling herself Sam Brewer. Her search ended in sadness, when she discovered her boyfriend had been murdered by a gang during a bar brawl. Monroe then swore to avenge his death, crossing virtually every city from Utah to northern Mexico. She failed to find her boyfriend&#x27;s killers, and became an alcoholic.

Around 1870, she met George Monroe, a well known and rich miner. Mollie and George Monroe married and settled in Wickenburg, Arizona, where they mined together. In 1874, they moved to Prescott, Arizona. George Monroe had discovered a water spring there. He turned it into a resort and named it &quot;Monroe Springs&quot;. The attraction drew many tourists from around the country.

Mollie Monroe was also a gambler. Apart from her alcoholism, her gambling addiction also led her to lose a considerable amount of money, once selling a gold mine she had discovered for around $2,500 dollars, then gambling the money away in about a week.

Despite her addictions, Monroe enjoyed helping needy people, such as prostitutes, lone women and their children. Legend has it that once she met a woman and her children; having been told by the woman that her husband went to town for supplies three days before and had not returned, she went searching for the man, and found him in a bar. She then led him out of the bar, tied him to her horse and dragged him all the way back to his house, staying overnight to make sure he wouldn&#x27;t leave the house again.

A newspaper report also told of her saving the lives of 20 army men when attacked by Apaches. According to the article, she had left the men to look for items to cook with, and when she returned, she noticed that the army men were surrounded by Apache, and that two army men had already been killed. She and her friend, Texas Johnson, fired shots into the air, and the Apaches ran, according to the news.

Mollie Monroe was despised by most of Prescott&#x27;s high society women, for what they viewed as &quot;manly manners&quot; and, as a popular publication of the time said, &quot;morals that are dissolute&quot;.

In 1877, she was found wandering across the streets of Peeples Valley by a policeman named Ed Bowers. Brought to trial, she was found to be insane on May 9 and sent to a sanitarium in Stockton, California.
Along the way to Stockton, she and Bowers were attacked by thieves. Other than Bowers losing a watch and some 450 dollars, the lawman and Monroe came out unscathed from the attack.
Mollie Monroe&#x27;s times at the California asylum did not go without controversy: she tried burning the building once, causing her to be sent to San Quentin jail. Once there, she forged a friendship with former Arizona governor A.P.K. Safford (after whom the city of Safford, Arizona is named). Many viewed this as an attempt by Mollie to get out of San Quentin.

In 1887, she was sent to a new asylum built in Phoenix. In 1895, she escaped the asylum, and was found four days later. With only a few crackers and a bottle of water taken to support herself, she was found bleeding and in bad overall health.

Her health, troubled by her alcohol problems, continued to decline, and in 1902, she died in the Phoenix asylum.

<doc id="865082" wikidata="Q253893" url="?curid=865082" title="Ice house (building)">
<text>An ice house, or icehouse, is a building used to store ice throughout the year, commonly used prior to the invention of the refrigerator. Some were underground chambers, usually man-made, close to natural sources of winter ice such as freshwater lakes, but many were buildings with various types of insulation.

During the winter, ice and snow would be cut from lakes or rivers, taken into the ice house, and packed with insulation (often straw or sawdust). It would remain frozen for many months, often until the following winter, and could be used as a source of ice during the summer months. 

The main application of the ice was the storage of foods, but it could also be used simply to cool drinks, or in the preparation of ice cream and sorbet desserts. During the heyday of the ice trade, a typical commercial ice house would store of ice in a and building.

==History==
A cuneiform tablet from 1780 BCE records the construction of an icehouse by Zimri-Lim, the King of Mari, in the northern Mesopotamian town of Terqa, &quot;which never before had any king built.&quot; In China, archaeologists have found remains of ice pits from the 7th century BCE, and references suggest that these were in use before 1100 BCE. 

Alexander the Great stored snow in pits dug for that purpose around 300 BCE. In Rome, in the 3rd century CE, snow was imported from the mountains, stored in straw-covered pits, and sold from snow shops. The ice that formed in the bottom of the pits sold at a higher price than the snow on top.

===Persia===


By 400 BCE, Persian engineers were building yakhchāls in the desert. The structure used evaporative cooling, radiative cooling, solar chimney, and diurnal heat reservoir techniques to store ice, food, and sometimes make ice. Water was often channeled from a qanat to a yakhchāl, where it freezes when the conditions were right. The most common structures have a conical shape above ground with a subterranean storage space, shade walls, and ice pool. Many that were built centuries ago remain standing.

==Modern times==
=== United Kingdom ===
The ice house was introduced to Britain in the 1600s. James I commissioned the first modern ice house in 1619 in Greenwich Park and another in Hampton Court in 1625–6. The Hampton Court ice house (or snow conserve) was a brick-lined well, which was deep and wide. A timber building with a thatched roof covered it. In 1660 Charles II had one built in London&#x27;s upper St James&#x27;s Park (now Green Park).

Various types and designs of ice house exist but British ice houses were commonly brick-lined, domed structures, with most of their volume underground. Ice houses varied in design depending on the date and builder, but were usually conical or rounded at the bottom to hold melted ice. They usually had a drain to take away the melt-water. It is recorded that the idea for ice houses was brought to Britain by travellers who had seen similar arrangements in Italy, where peasants collected ice from the mountains and used it to keep food fresh inside caves. Ice houses were also known as &quot;ice wells&quot;, &quot;ice pits&quot; or &quot;ice mounds&quot;. 

Game larders and venison larders were sometimes marked on Ordnance Survey maps as ice houses. Bruce Walker, an expert on Scottish Vernacular buildings, has suggested that relatively numerous and usually long-ruined ice houses on country estates have led to Scotland&#x27;s many legends of secret tunnels.

During the 18th century there was an increase in the construction of ice houses often at large manor houses and their estates.

Ice was often imported into the UK from Scandinavia until the 1920s, although from around 1900 the import of ice declined sharply owing to the development of factories in the UK where ice was made artificially. Usually, only large mansions had purpose-built buildings to store ice. Many examples of ice houses exist in the UK, some of which have fallen into disrepair.

Good examples of 19th-century ice houses can be found at Ashton Court, Bristol; Albrighton, Bridgnorth; Aynhoe Park, Northamptonshire; Deddington Manor, Grendon, Warwickshire; and at Christchurch Mansion, Ipswich, Suffolk; Petworth House, Sussex; Danny House, Sussex; Ayscoughfee Hall, Spalding; Rufford Abbey, Eglinton Country Park in Scotland; Parlington Hall in Yorkshire and Croxteth Hall Liverpool; Burghley House, Stamford and Moggerhanger Park, Moggerhanger, Bedfordshire. 

An unusual example of an ice house that was converted from a redundant brick springhead can be found in the former grounds of Norton House, Midsomer Norton, Somerset. The largest surviving ice house in the UK is the Tugnet Ice House in Spey Bay. It was built in 1830, and used to store ice for packing salmon caught in the River Spey before transportation to market in London.

During the Second World War (between 1939 and 1945) old ice houses found new uses. Although some were used to store ice and food, others, because they were often underground and well built, became air raid shelters.

In 2018, the very large Park Crescent West ice well was discovered in Park Crescent, London. It was created for Samuel Dash in the early 1780s for commercial use before the building of the John Nash crescent was begun in 1806. This ice house is deep, and wide, and is only a few metres away from the Jubilee line on the London Underground. Originally used for the storage of local ice taken from the River Thames in the winter months, it was taken over in the 1820s by the ice merchant William Leftwich, who used it for storing imported ice from the frozen lakes of Norway.

A pair of commercial ice wells has been preserved in London, beneath what is now the London Canal Museum at King&#x27;s Cross. They are around 30 feet in diameter and were originally 42 feet deep. They were built in 1857 and 1863 by the Swiss entrepreneur Carlo Gatti.

===Ireland ===
In 1985, a passage was discovered beneath Ardgillan Castle in Co. Dublin, Ireland. This passage was found to be the ice house that had been known to exist on the grounds, but whose location had not been rediscovered until this date. There are other ice houses still surviving in Ireland, for example on the Woodstock Estate near Inistioge, Co. Kilkenny and at the former Rockingham Estate in Boyle, Co. Roscommon, now accessible at Lough Key Forest Park.

===United States===

Ice houses allowed a trade in ice that was a major part of the early economy of the New England region of the United States, which saw fortunes made by people who transported ice in straw-packed ships to the southern states and throughout the Caribbean Sea. Most notable was Frederic Tudor (known as Boston&#x27;s &quot;Ice King&quot;) who formed the Tudor Ice Company in the early 19th century. In winter months, ice was chipped from a lake surface and often dragged by sled to the ice house. In summer months, icemen delivered it to residences in ice-wagons; the ice would then be stored in an icebox, which was used much like a modern refrigerator.
As home and business refrigeration became more commonplace, ice houses fell into disuse, and the home ice delivery business declined until it had virtually disappeared by the late 1960s. Smaller ice houses, often no more than a sawdust pile covered by a makeshift roof or tarpaulin, continued to be maintained for storing ice for use in local events such as fairs. Today, most ice for daily consumption is made in a home freezer, while bulk ice is manufactured, distributed and sold like other retail commodities. At least two icehouses are still operated traditionally, as a tourist attractions in New England, and DuPage County, Illinois.

==== Texas and the American South ====
In Texas, former ice houses are a cultural tradition. Ice merchants diversified to sell groceries and cold beer, serving as early convenience stores and local gathering places. The widespread 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores in the U.S., first known as U-Tote&#x27;m Stores, developed from ice houses operated by ice manufacturers, like the Southland Ice Manufacturing Company, in Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio in the 1930s. Southland was not the only company in the Southern United States to develop a convenience-store corporation from an ice business. Munford Inc. of Atlanta began in the early 20th century by vending both ice and coal from mule-drawn wagons, as the Atlantic Ice and Coal Company. By the 1970s, Munford, Inc. was operating a large chain of convenience stores with the name Majik Market (the company was sold in 1988 and filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1990).

In some parts of Texas, especially from San Antonio and the Texas Hill Country down to the Mexican border, ice houses functioned as open-air bars, with the word &quot;icehouse&quot; becoming a colloquialism for an establishment that derives the majority of its income from the sale of cold beer. The distinction between South Texas ice houses and ice houses of other parts of the state and the South has been connected to the Catholicism of the region, a deeper-rooted Mexican culture, and the influence of German immigrants.

<doc id="865087" wikidata="Q180347" url="?curid=865087" title="Z-Cars">
<text>Z-Cars or Z Cars (pronounced &quot;zed cars&quot;) was a British television police procedural series centred on the work of mobile uniformed police in the fictional town of Newtown, based on Kirkby, near Liverpool. Produced by the BBC, it debuted in January 1962 and ran until September 1978.

The series differed sharply from earlier police procedurals. With its less-usual Northern England setting, it injected a new element of harsh realism into the image of the police, which some found unwelcome.

&quot;Z-Cars&quot; ran for 801 episodes, of which fewer than half have survived. Regular stars included: Stratford Johns (Detective Inspector Barlow), Frank Windsor (Det. Sgt. Watt), James Ellis (Bert Lynch) and Brian Blessed (&quot;Fancy&quot; Smith). Barlow and Watt were later spun into a separate series &quot;Softly, Softly&quot;.

==Origin of the title==

The title comes from the radio call signs allocated by Lancashire Constabulary. Lancashire police divisions were lettered from north to the south: &quot;A&quot; Division (based in Ulverston) was the detached part of Lancashire at the time around Barrow-in-Furness, &quot;B&quot; Division was Lancaster, and so on (see Home Office radio). The TV series took the non-existent signs Z-Victor 1 and Z-Victor 2. The title does not, as sometimes suggested, come from the cars used, Ford Zephyr and Ford Zodiac. The Zephyr was the standard traffic patrol car used by Lancashire and other police forces, while the Zodiac was only used for specialist tasks such as traffic duty. Also, the term &quot;Z-car&quot; was used by British newspaper publishing companies to refer to any type of police vehicle.

==Concept and principal characters==
&quot;Z Cars&quot; as an idea came to creator Troy Kennedy Martin as he listened to police messages on his radio while trying to relieve the boredom of being ill in bed with mumps. It was set in the fictional Newtown, loosely based on the real-life modern suburb of Kirkby, one of many housing estates that had sprung up across Britain in the post-war years, and its ageing neighbour Seaport.

The stories revolve around pairs of officers patrolling that week. Riding on changing social attitudes and television, the social realism, with interesting stories, garnered popularity for &quot;Z Cars&quot;. It was initially somewhat unpopular with real-life police, who disliked the sometimes unsympathetic characterisation of officers. Being set in Northern England helped give &quot;Z Cars&quot; a regional flavour when most BBC dramas were set in Southern England. It directly challenged the BBC&#x27;s established police drama &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, which at that point had been running for seven years but which some considered &#x27;cosy&#x27;.

The one character present throughout the entire run (though not in every episode) was Bert Lynch, played by James Ellis (though John Phillips as Det. Chief Supt. Robins reappeared sporadically during the show&#x27;s run – by the end of the series he had become Chief Constable). Other characters in the early days were Stratford Johns (Det. Chief Inspector Barlow), Frank Windsor (Det. Sgt. Watt), Robert Keegan (Sgt. Blackitt), Joseph Brady (PC &quot;Jock&quot; Weir), Brian Blessed (&quot;Fancy&quot; Smith) and Jeremy Kemp (Bob Steele). Also in 1960s episodes as David Graham was Colin Welland, later a screenwriter. Other British actors who played regular roles in the early years included Joss Ackland. Although he played no regular role in the series, future Monkee Davy Jones appeared in three episodes, and 1963 saw two future well-known faces join the regulars – Leonard Rossiter played DI Bamber in eight episodes, and John Thaw, later known for his roles in &quot;The Sweeney&quot; and &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, appeared in four as a detective constable who had to leave the force because he had a &quot;glass head&quot; – he could not drink alcohol when socialising and mixing with the criminal fraternity, very much part of a detective&#x27;s job.

==Episodes==

&quot;Z-Cars&quot; ran for 801 episodes.

The original run ended in 1965; Barlow, Watt and Blackitt were spun off into a new series &quot;Softly, Softly&quot;. When the BBC was looking for a twice-weekly show to replace a series of failed &#x27;soaps&#x27; (one example being &quot;United!&quot;), &quot;Z Cars&quot; was revived. The revival was produced by the BBC&#x27;s serials department in a twice-weekly soap opera format of 25-minute episodes, and only James Ellis and Joseph Brady remained from the original show&#x27;s run. It was shown from March 1967, both 25-minute segments each week comprising one story.

It ran like this until the episode &quot;Kid&#x27;s Stuff&quot; (broadcast on 30 March 1971), shown as a single 50-minute episode for the week, proved the longer format would still work. Thereafter, &quot;Z Cars&quot; was shown in alternating spells of either two × 25 minute episodes or the single 50-minute episode each week over the next 16 months. This arrangement ended with the showing of the final two-parter, &quot;Breakage&quot; (Series 6, parts 74 and 75, on 21 and 22 August 1972 respectively), after which the series returned permanently to a regular pattern of one 50-minute episode per week.

===Lost episodes===
Like many series of its era, &quot;Z-Cars&quot; is incomplete in the archives. The period 1962–65 is reasonably well represented; though with big gaps. With the 1967–71 sixth series, when the programme was shown almost every week, material becomes more patchy still. Of the 416 episodes made for this series, only 108 survive: a few episodes each from 1967, 1969, and 1970, but there are no surviving episodes from 1968 or 1971. About 40% of the total 801 episodes are preserved.

The original series was one of the last British television dramas to be screened as a live production. With videotaping becoming the norm and telerecording a mature method of preserving broadcasts, the practice of live broadcasting drama productions was rare by the time the programme began in 1962. Going out &quot;live&quot; was a preference of the series&#x27; producer David Rose, who felt it helped immediacy and pace and gave it an edge. As a result, episodes were still not being pre-recorded as late as 1965. Most were videotaped for a potential repeat, although the tapes – costed as part of a programme&#x27;s budget – were normally wiped for re-use. The transfer of a live or videotaped programme to film greatly enhanced its chances of surviving.

In the 1980s, the telerecording of the pilot episode &quot;Four of a Kind&quot; was returned to its writer Allan Prior by an engineer. He had taken it home to preserve it because his children had enjoyed the programme and as a result he could not bring himself to destroy it. This and two other early editions were released on a BBC Video in 1993. Two further episodes were returned in 2004 after turning up in a private collection; there have been other occasional returns of individual early episodes in more recent years.

The return of the 50-minute format into regular use coincided with an increase in the survival rate, and all episodes from the 1975–1978 period are preserved in the archives. BBC Archive Treasure Hunt was a drive to seek out missing episodes and is still open to information regarding missing editions of lost BBC television programmes. British vintage television enthusiast organisation Kaleidoscope is also interested in the recovery of lost television shows, regardless of their original maker or broadcaster.

==Theme music==
The &quot;Z-Cars&quot; theme tune was arranged by Fritz Spiegl and his then wife, composer Bridget Fry, from the traditional Liverpool folk song &quot;Johnny Todd&quot;. It was released on record in several versions in 1962. Johnny Keating&#x27;s version (Piccadilly Records, 7N.35032) sold the best, reaching No. 8 on the Record Retailer chart and as high as No. 5 on some UK charts, whilst the Norrie Paramor Orchestra&#x27;s version, on Columbia DB 4789, peaked at No. 33. A vocal version of the theme, using the original ballad&#x27;s words, was released by cast member James Ellis on Philips Records PB 1230; this missed the charts.

The song in Spiegl and Fry&#x27;s arrangement is used as an anthem by English football clubs Everton and Watford, playing as the teams enter the pitch for their home games, at Goodison Park and Vicarage Road respectively. It is also used for similar purposes at the Borough Park home of Workington A.F.C.

The tune has also been used as music for the hymn &quot;Father, Hear the Prayer We Offer&quot;.

==After &quot;Z-Cars&quot;==
&quot;Softly, Softly&quot;, a 1965 spin-off, focused on the regional crime squad, and ran until 1969, when it was again revised and became &quot;Softly, Softly: Task Force&quot;, running until 1976. The character of Barlow (Stratford Johns) was one of the best-known figures in British television in the 1960s and 1970s. He was given several seasons of his own solo series, &quot;Barlow at Large&quot; (later &quot;Barlow&quot;) which ran from 1971 to 1975. Barlow joined Watt (Frank Windsor) for the 1973 serial &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;. The serial&#x27;s success led to a further spin-off titled &quot;Second Verdict&quot; in which Barlow and Watt looked into unsolved cases and unsafe convictions.

Windsor made a final appearance as Watt in the last episode of &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, &quot;Pressure&quot;, in September 1978, with Robins (John Phillips), the detective chief superintendent from the original series who had risen to chief constable. Jeremy Kemp, Brian Blessed, Joseph Brady and Colin Welland also appeared, though not as their original characters.

==Recognition==
In a 2000 poll to find the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century conducted by the British Film Institute, &quot;Z-Cars&quot; was voted 63rd. It was also included in television critic Alison Graham&#x27;s alphabetical list of 40 &quot;all-time great&quot; TV shows published in &quot;Radio Times&quot; in August 2003.

<doc id="865091" wikidata="Q171708" url="?curid=865091" title="Coat of arms of Finland">
<text>The coat of arms of Finland is a crowned lion on a red field, the right foreleg replaced with an armoured human arm brandishing a sword, trampling on a sabre with the hindpaws. The Finnish coat of arms was originally created around the year 1580.

== Background ==
=== The lion in Finnish heraldry ===
The heraldic lion is quite common in Western Europe, and several European countries incorporate it into their national coats of arms. In Nordic heraldry, the lion is first found in the coat of arms of Denmark in the later part of the 12th century.

Starting in the 13th century, the territory of today&#x27;s Finland was gradually incorporated into the Swedish kingdom, and this coincided with the period when coats of arms first came into use in northern Europe. The first known use of the lion in Sweden was on the royal seals of Erik Knutsson (died 1216) and Erik Eriksson (1216–50), who used two and three lions on their seal, respectively. The first king of the House of Bjälbo, Valdemar Birgersson (1239–1302), also used 3 lions on his seal (&quot;Figure 2&quot;).

=== Finland as a duchy ===


Bengt Birgersson, the first duke of Finland (1254–1291; duke from 1284 until 1291), and Valdemar Magnusson, the second duke of Finland (died 1318; duke from 1302 until 1317), both used the later Bjälbo coat of arms, which was a crowned lion rampant with three bends sinister, the main difference being that Valdemar&#x27;s arms had the field strewn with hearts (&quot;Figure 3&quot;). This version of the arms was quite similar to the modern coat of arms of Finland, but the lion did not yet brandish any weapon.

== Creation ==

When John III assumed the title of &quot;Grand Duke of Finland and Karelia&quot;, shortened to Grand Duke of Finland in 1577 (or soon thereafter), the lion became closely associated with Finland through the grand-ducal coats of arms (&quot;Figure 5&quot;). The grand-ducal coat of arms is thought to have resulted out of a combination of the &quot;Göta lion&quot; (originating from the &quot;Folkunga&quot; lion) and the arms of Karelia (&quot;Figure 6&quot;). The result was that the lion brandishes one weapon and treads on another.


The best-known version of the grand-ducal coat of arms is found on the tomb of Gustavus I (1523–60) in the Uppsala cathedral (&quot;Figure 5&quot;). It has been suggested that either Duke John himself, or his brother Eric XIV, was leading the design work on the heraldic signs on the tomb. Neither statement can be confirmed, but it is known that Eric XIV showed an interest in heraldry. The monument was commissioned from Guillaume Boyen (Willem Boy), a Flemish architect and sculptor who had worked in Sweden. He started on the task in Antwerp in 1562, completing it 10 years later; however, the tomb was not in place in Uppsala until the early 1580s, and the finishing work lasted until 1591. In addition to the royal arms of Sweden and those of Finland, the arms of the 11 provinces are depicted. From Finland they include North and South Finland, as well as Tavastia and Karelia. The work of Willem Boy is of exceptional quality, which is perhaps explained by the fact that lions were a dominant feature in the heraldry of Flanders, and he would therefore have had a great deal of exposure to it before receiving the commission for the tomb of Gustavus I.

The earliest known blazon from this period states that the arms of Finland represents &quot;A crowned lion of gold holding a sword in the right forepaw and trampling with both hindpaws on a Russian sabre (&quot;ryssesabel&quot;), surrounded by nine silver roses in a red field, over the shield a golden crown with a red cap&quot;. As both King Gustavus I and his son, John III, were involved in lengthy wars with Russia, it should come as no surprise that this was a central element in the arms of both the Grand Duchy of Finland, and in that of the coat of arms of the Finnish province of Karelia (&quot;Figure 6&quot;), which symbolizes the struggle between East and West.

The purpose of the nine roses remains unknown, but are now mostly considered to be decorative only. They have sometimes been claimed to represent the nine historical provinces of Finland, but this hypothesis has not found support among prominent scholars. The number of towns in the nominal &quot;Grand Duchy of Finland and Karelia&quot; in 1580 was also nine, but no known historical research provides support for a link between the number of roses and the number of towns in Finland in 1580.

== Evolution ==

=== Swedish era ===
During the following centuries, the arms of Finland were to appear in different versions of varying artistic quality, and it was only in the late 19th century when the Uppsala lion was again taken into use as the prototype for the coat of arms of Finland.

The lion experienced several changes during the 17th century. In the funeral banner of Charles X Gustavus (in 1660) it can be seen treading on the sabre with all three free paws; in drawings by Elias Brenner (in the &quot;Suecia antique et hodierna&quot; by Erik Dahlberg, printed in 1716), it is pictured with a double tail (&quot;queue fourchée&quot;) and with an almost walking posture.

===Grand Duchy of Finland ===

After Finland was transformed into a grand duchy (as a consequence of the Swedish–Russian War of 1808–1809), Elias Brenner&#x27;s version of the lion was chosen by the authorities as the model for the new coat of arms of the Grand Duchy of Finland, an autonomous part of the Russian Empire. The blazon in the decree of 26 October 1809 states: &quot;The shield has a red field, strewn with roses of silver, on which a golden lion with a crown of gold, standing on a silver saber, which it grasps with the left forepaw while holding in the right forepaw an upright sword&quot;. Obviously, any interpretation of the lion as &quot;trampling on a Russian sabre&quot; had been lost at this point in time.

During the reform of official Russian heraldry in 1857, the lion was again changed on the initiative of Baron Bernhard Karl von Köhne. The blazon states: &quot;On a red field strewn with silver roses a crowned lion of gold, holding in the right forepaw an upright sword and in the left one a curved sword on which it rests with the right hindpaw&quot;. The main changes were that the lion had started to resemble a dog rather than a lion, and the crown on top of the shield had been changed to an arched crown without a cap, and with a small Russian eagle on the rim. The sword in the right forepaw had shrunk in size, to the point of resembling a dagger rather than a sword (&quot;Figure 8&quot;).

During the years when the Russian emperors pursued a policy of Russification (1899–1905 and 1908–1917), the use of the arms of Finland increased significantly, and eventually became popular in the broader population.

The director of the Finnish National Archives, Karl August Bomansson (1827–1906), made the first significant study on the arms of Finland in modern times. He restored the appearance of the arms in 1886, so that it closely resembled the &quot;Uppsala lion&quot;. However, there was a slight deviation on how the lion tramples on the saber, and the arched crown with the imperial eagle in the &quot;von Köhne&quot; version was replaced with a crown similar to that of a German princely crown. This version of the arms was subsequently used in the early years of Finnish independence.

=== Early independence ===
During the 1920s and 1930s, the national arms became the subject of some controversy, and the debate centered on whether the lion should be replaced with a bear, which had an important place in the national folklore. Already in 1557, the bear had emerged as the emblem of &quot;Finnia Septentrionalis&quot; (&quot;North Finland&quot;, at the time roughly the same as Satakunta and northern Southwest Finland) and continues to be used as the coat of arms of Satakunta. However, outside Finland, the bear was usually regarded as a symbol of Russia. The debate was however not settled, and throughout most of the 20th century, versions of the arms were used that closely adhered to the &quot;Uppsala lion&quot;.

In 1936, a state committee suggested a compromise that Finland should have a &quot;greater&quot; and a &quot;smaller&quot; coat of arms. The greater coat of arms was proposed to have two bears as supporters of the arms (&quot;Figure 9&quot;), with a base of spruce twigs and with the motto &quot;vapaa, vankka, vakaa&quot; (&quot;free, firm, steadfast&quot;). This would have given the bear a place in the national heraldry, but the design was never confirmed, nor was this version of the arms taken into use.

=== Today ===

The blazon of the national coat of arms was finally settled in 1978, when the law of 26 May 1978 (381/78) described the coat of arms as follows: &quot;On a red field, a crowned lion, the right forepaw replaced with an armoured hand brandishing a sword, trampling on a saber with the hindpaws, the lion, crowned and armed, the weapons hilted and the armour garnished gold, the blades and the armour silver, the field strewn with nine roses of silver&quot;. (This is, however, a direct translation from Finnish; the heraldic blazon would be &quot;Gules, a lion crowned Or rampant striking with a sword Argent on his armoured dexter arm, trampling on a sabre Argent; surmounted with nine roses Argent&quot;)

The coat of arms appears on the Finnish state flag. The Finnish lion is also used in a wide variety of emblems of different state authorities, often modified to depict the duties of the unit or the authority. On the other hand, the Finnish municipalities and regions usually use heraldic motifs drawn from elsewhere, leaving the lion for state use (exceptions exist, such as the Coat of arms of Jakobstad). The Finnish lion also appears as an armed force&#x27;s generals&#x27; rank insignia and in the navy as part of an officer&#x27;s rank insignia.

<doc id="865092" wikidata="Q284199" url="?curid=865092" title="International Association of Universities">
<text>The International Association of Universities (IAU) is a membership-led non-governmental organization working in the field of global higher education. It has more than 600 members in over 130 countries, including institutions, organizations, affiliates, and associates in higher education. The IAU was created under and is an official associate partner of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). 

== Mission ==
Following the IAU&#x27;s 15th General Conference, the IAU proclaims four priorities to advance the mission of development in higher education. These include leadership, sustainable development, internationalization, and digital transformation. 

==History==
As a result of the aftermath of World War II and the emergence of the Cold War, there was a renewed need for global cooperation. Cooperation within global higher education became a driving issue to rebuild and strengthen the world. Thus, a formal proposition of the International Association of Universities was discussed at a UNESCO General Conference in the year 1947. Three years after, the IAU held its first General Conference in Nice, France. Over the decades, the IAU has played a key role in promoting global collaboration among universities, addressing issues in higher education, and advancing sustainable development. Following the first General Conference, key events included releasing two publications that formalized the standards and goals for the organization as well as the creation of international research committees in the 1960s.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, IAU expanded its vision by addressing and discussing arising problems, increasing partnerships, and releasing more publications. In the 1990s, the IAU recognized the importance of releasing policy statements as a form of discussion for current concerns, addressing issues like sustainable development and academic freedom.

In the 2000s, the IAU increased its focus on internationalization, launching global reports, advisory services, and global forums. It also embraced digital transformation, creating online platforms for outreach to higher education institutions. First presented in 2016 and up until today, the IAU prioritizes leadership, sustainable development, internationalization, and digital transformation. 

==Governance structure==
The IAU operates under a member representative governance system designed to foster international cooperation in higher education. The General Conference, composed of representatives from institutional members and organizational members, is the supreme decision-making body. It convenes at least once every four years, determining IAU’s general policy, electing the President and Administrative Board, and addressing themes of global relevance in higher education. This gathering also serves as a forum for fostering diversity and solidarity in global higher education. The Administrative Board, comprising the President, Secretary-General, and members from diverse nations, meets annually to implement the General Conference’s decisions, manage the budget, and oversee the Secretariat. Supporting the Administrative Board is the Executive Committee, composed of the President, four regional Vice-Presidents, and the Secretary-General. Meeting twice yearly, this committee acts on behalf of the Administrative Board, guiding the agenda and preparing its meetings. The IAU President as well as all Administrative Board positions are election based and are served in four year terms. Executive Committee positions are appointed by the President with confirmation by the Administrative Board. The Secretariat, based in UNESCO’s Paris headquarters, executes the association’s programs, manages its daily operations, and serves as a hub for information and advisory services. 

== Membership ==
The IAU counts over 600 members in over 130 countries worldwide. These members span diverse geographical regions and focus on collaboration, knowledge exchange, and innovation in higher education. There are four different member classes within the IAU including institutions, organizations, affiliates, and associates. The majority of the organizations&#x27; membership is occupied by higher education institutions. There are a variety of benefits that members of the IAU utilize including networking opportunities, resources for development, and being actively involved in both organizational and global decision making. Access to benefits alters with member status. Each member category has a specific admission criteria and application process. To become a member institution of the an application must be submitted and accepted given that the institution aligns with the mission and meets a set of characteristic requirements. Becoming a member organization is open to associations and networks of higher education institutions. Affiliate membership is offered for those organizations that align with the IAUs mission but do not meet certain characteristic admission criteria. Individuals who have expertise in higher education can apply for associate membership. There is a financial requirement annually which varies depending on member class and origin country income. 

== Programs and initiatives ==
In its 2023 annual report, the IAU outlines an agenda focusing on thematic priorities to address global challenges and foster development in higher education. 

=== Leadership ===
The IAU prioritizes leadership that enables institutions to strategically address challenges and foster social progress. A high developed IAU program includes the year-long Executive Leadership Program, which equips current and emerging university leaders with skills to address pressing administrative, ethical, and societal issues. This program utilizes in person sessions and online learning, incorporating ten thematic modules. 

=== Sustainable Development ===
The IAU offers research and collaboration to support its alignment with the United Nations 2030 Agenda&#x27;s Sustainable Development Goals. The IAU&#x27;s Higher Education and Research for Sustainable Development (HESD) Cluster, promotes collaboration among universities worldwide to advance specific sustainable development goals. The IAU actively engages with UNESCO and other organizations to enhance sustainability in education. The IAU leads research projects like the Global Survey on HESD and pilot programs to gather information that can be utilized in sustainable development. 

=== Internationalization ===
The IAU advocates for inclusive and ethical internationalization in higher education. This is presented through a variety of methods including the 6th Global Survey on Internationalization, collecting insights from institutions across 110 countries to assess global and regional trends. Partnerships like the Future of Internationalization Partnership and Network of International Education Associations focus on understanding evolving dynamics and fostering global dialogue. Initiatives like an Online Diploma on Internationalization Management target regional and global stakeholders. 

=== Digital Transformation ===
The IAU understands the progression of technology and offers a framework to utilize technology to enhance access and quality in education. Recent initiatives include developing an Open Science Expert Group which supports the adoption of UNESCO’s Open Science principles and discussions exploring the impact of unprecedented technologies like artificial intelligence. The IAU relaunched its connection-based program, the Institutional Site Visits Program, which fosters peer learning around innovative digital practices.

<doc id="865100" wikidata="Q861304" url="?curid=865100" title="Steak and kidney pie">
<text>Steak and kidney pie is a popular British dish. It is a savoury pie filled principally with a mixture of diced beef, diced kidney (which may be beef, lamb, veal, or pork) and onion. Its contents are generally similar to those of steak and kidney puddings.

==History and ingredients==
In modern times the fillings of steak and kidney pies and steak and kidney puddings are generally identical, but until the mid-19th century the norms were steak puddings and kidney pies. &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life in London and Sporting Chronicle&quot;, 1826, records a large dish of kidney pies in the window of a baker near Smithfield, and ten years later a kidney-pie stand outside what is now the Old Vic, emitting sparks every time the vendor opened his portable oven to hand a hot kidney pie to a customer.

&quot;Rump Steak and Kidney Pie&quot; was served in a Liverpool restaurant in 1847, and in 1863 a Birmingham establishment offered &quot;Beef Steak and Kidney Pie&quot;. But until the 1870s kidney pies are far more frequently mentioned in the newspapers, including one thrown at a policeman during an affray in Knightsbridge in 1862, and an assault case in Lambeth in 1867 when a customer attacked a waitress for bringing her a beef pie instead of a kidney one. By the mid-1870s steak and kidney pies were as often mentioned as kidney ones. Both appeared in verse of the period:
&lt;poem&gt;
 You say you are too sad to eat!
 Just hand your plate and try
 This steak and kidney pie, my love–
 This steak and kidney pie.
 From &quot;Fun&quot;, 1875
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
 I&#x27;ve eaten as much as a man could eat,
 I&#x27;ve gone through a very remarkable feat;
 From the twopenny tart to the kidney pie,
 I&#x27;ve swallowed as much as I could, have I.
 From &quot;The Zoo&quot; (1875), by B. C. Stephenson and Arthur Sullivan
&lt;/poem&gt;
According to the cookery writer Jane Grigson, the first published recipe for the combination of steak and kidney was in 1859 in Mrs Beeton&#x27;s &quot;Household Management&quot;. Beeton used it in a pudding rather than a pie. She had been sent the recipe by a correspondent in Sussex in south-east England, and Grigson speculates that it was until then a regional dish, unfamiliar to cooks in other parts of Britain.

Beeton suggested that steak and kidney could be &quot;very much enriched&quot; by the addition of mushrooms or oysters. In those days oysters were the cheaper of the two: mushroom cultivation was still in its infancy in Europe and oysters were still commonplace. In the following century Dorothy Hartley (1954) recommended the use of black-gilled mushrooms rather than oysters, because long cooking is &quot;apt to make [oysters] go hard&quot;.

Neither Beeton nor Hartley specified the type of animal from which the kidneys were to be used in a steak and kidney recipe. Grigson (1974) calls for either veal or ox kidney, as does Marcus Wareing. Other cooks of modern times have variously specified lamb or sheep kidney (Marguerite Patten, Nigella Lawson and John Torode), ox kidney (Mary Berry, Delia Smith and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall), veal kidney (Gordon Ramsay), either pork or lamb (Jamie Oliver), and either ox, lamb or veal kidneys (Gary Rhodes).

==Cooking and variations==

Some versions are full, or &quot;double-crust&quot;, pies, in which the cooking dish is lined with pastry before the meat mixture is added, after which a pastry top is put over it. In other versions the meat is put straight into the dish, with only a pastry lid. In either case, a pie funnel is often used to stop the top crust sinking into the meat mixture during baking. Some recipes call for puff pastry; others for shortcrust. In some the meat is cooked before going into the pie; in others it goes in raw. In addition to the steak and kidney, the filling typically contains carrots and onions, and is cooked in one or more of beef stock, red wine and stout. 

The steak and kidney pie is found in numerous regional variants. In the West Country clotted or double cream may be poured into the pie through a hole in the pastry topping just before serving. The Ormidale pie from the Scottish Highlands is flavoured with a teaspoon each of Worcestershire sauce, vinegar and tomato sauce. In East Yorkshire sliced potatoes are substituted for kidneys and the dish is called meat and pot pie. In the English Midlands, Northern England and Scotland oysters or mushrooms or both are often added; in Scotland this variant is known as Musselburgh pie.

== Popular culture ==
Among the various vernacular names for steak and kidney pie are Kate and Sidney pie, snake and kiddy pie, and snake and pygmy pie. Eric Partridge dates the first of these to around 1880.
A substantial part of the plot of P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s 1963 comic novel &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot; hinges on the disruptive allure of a magnificent steak and kidney pie for a young man whose fiancée has decreed that he must turn vegetarian.

<doc id="865104" wikidata="Q727715" url="?curid=865104" title="Book of hours">
<text>Books of hours () are Christian prayer books, which were used to pray the canonical hours. The use of a book of hours was especially popular in the Middle Ages, and as a result, they are the most common type of surviving medieval illuminated manuscript. Like every manuscript, each manuscript book of hours is unique in one way or another, but most contain a similar collection of texts, prayers and psalms, often with appropriate decorations, for Christian devotion. Illumination or decoration is minimal in many examples, often restricted to decorated capital letters at the start of psalms and other prayers, but books made for wealthy patrons may be extremely lavish, with full-page miniatures. These illustrations would combine picturesque scenes of country life with sacred images. 

Books of hours were usually written in Latin (they were largely known by the name until &quot;book of hours&quot; was relatively recently applied to them), although there are many entirely or partially written in vernacular European languages, especially Dutch. The closely related primer is occasionally considered synonymous with books of hours a medieval &quot;horae&quot; was referred to as a &quot;primer&quot; in Middle English but their contents and purposes could deviate significantly from the simple recitation of the canonical hours. Tens of thousands of books of hours have survived to the present day, in libraries and private collections throughout the world.

The typical book of hours is an abbreviated form of the breviary, which contains the Divine Office recited in monasteries. It was developed for lay people who wished to incorporate elements of monasticism into their devotional life. Reciting the hours typically centered upon the reading of a number of psalms and other prayers. 

A typical book of hours contains the Calendar of Church feasts, extracts from the Four Gospels, the Mass readings for major feasts, the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the fifteen Psalms of Degrees, the seven Penitential Psalms, a Litany of Saints, an Office for the Dead and the Hours of the Cross. Most 15th-century books of hours have these basic contents. The Marian prayers (&quot;I beseech thee&quot;) and (&quot;O undefiled one&quot;) were frequently added, as were devotions for use at Mass, and meditations on the Passion of Christ, among other optional texts. Such books of hours continue to be used by many Christians today, such as the Catholic “Key of Heaven” prayer books, the Agpeya of Coptic Christianity or The Brotherhood Prayer Book of Lutheranism.

==History==
The book of hours has its ultimate origin in the Psalter, which monks and nuns were required to recite. By the 12th century this had developed into the breviary, with weekly cycles of psalms, prayers, hymns, antiphons, and readings which changed with the liturgical season. Eventually a selection of texts was produced in much shorter volumes and came to be called a book of hours. During the latter part of the thirteenth century the Book of Hours became popular as a personal prayer book for men and women who led secular lives. It consisted of a selection of prayers, psalms, hymns and lessons based on the liturgy of the clergy. Each book was unique in its content though all included the Hours of the Virgin Mary, devotions to be made during the eight canonical hours of the day, the reasoning behind the name &#x27;Book of Hours&#x27;.
Many books of hours were made for women. There is some evidence that they were sometimes given as a wedding present from a husband to his bride. Frequently they were passed down through the family, as recorded in wills. Until about the 15th century paper was rare and most books of hours consisted of parchment sheets made from animal skins.

Although the most heavily illuminated books of hours were enormously expensive, a small book with little or no illumination was affordable much more widely, and increasingly so during the 15th century. The earliest surviving English example was apparently written for a laywoman living in or near Oxford in about 1240. It is smaller than a modern paperback but heavily illuminated with major initials, but no full-page miniatures. By the 15th century, there are also examples of servants owning their own Books of Hours. In a court case from 1500, a pauper woman is accused of stealing a domestic servant&#x27;s prayerbook.

Very rarely the books included prayers specifically composed for their owners, but more often the texts are adapted to their tastes or gender, including the inclusion of their names in prayers. Some include images depicting their owners, and some their coats of arms. These, together with the choice of saints commemorated in the calendar and suffrages, are the main clues for the identity of the first owner. Eamon Duffy explains how these books reflected the person who commissioned them. He claims that the &quot;personal character of these books was often signaled by the inclusion of prayers specially composed or adapted for their owners.&quot; Furthermore, he states that &quot;as many as half the surviving manuscript Books of Hours have annotations, marginalia or additions of some sort. Such additions might amount to no more than the insertion of some regional or personal patron saint in the standardized calendar, but they often include devotional material added by the owner. Owners could write in specific dates important to them, notes on the months where things happened that they wished to remember, and even the images found within these books would be personalized to the owners—such as localized saints and local festivities. 

By at least the 15th century, the Netherlands and Paris workshops were producing books of hours for stock or distribution, rather than waiting for individual commissions. These were sometimes with spaces left for the addition of personalized elements such as local feasts or heraldry.

The style and layout for traditional books of hours became increasingly standardized around the middle of the thirteenth century. The new style can be seen in the books produced by the Oxford illuminator William de Brailes who ran a commercial workshop (he was in minor orders). His books included various aspects of the Church&#x27;s breviary and other liturgical aspects for use by the laity. &quot;He incorporated a perpetual calendar, Gospels, prayers to the Virgin Mary, the Stations of the Cross, prayers to the Holy Spirit, Penitential psalms, litanies, prayers for the dead, and suffrages to the Saints. The book&#x27;s goal was to help his devout patroness to structure her daily spiritual life in accordance with the eight canonical hours, Matins to Compline, observed by all devout members of the Church. The text, augmented by rubrication, gilding, miniatures, and beautiful illuminations, sought to inspire meditation on the mysteries of faith, the sacrifice made by Christ for man, and the horrors of hell, and to especially highlight devotion to the Virgin Mary whose popularity was at a zenith during the 13th century.&quot; This arrangement was maintained over the years as many aristocrats commissioned the production of their own books.

By the end of the 15th century, the advent of printing made books more affordable and much of the emerging middle-class could afford to buy a printed book of hours, and new manuscripts were only commissioned by the very wealthy. The &quot;Kitab salat al-sawai&quot; (1514), widely considered the first book in Arabic printed using moveable type, is a book of hours intended for Arabic-speaking Christians and presumably commissioned by Pope Julius II.

==Decoration==

As many books of hours are richly illuminated, they form an important record of life in the 15th and 16th centuries as well as the iconography of medieval Christianity. Some of them were also decorated with jewelled covers, portraits, and heraldic emblems. Some were bound as girdle books for easy carrying, though few of these or other medieval bindings have survived. Luxury books, like the &quot;Talbot Hours&quot; of John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, may include a portrait of the owner, and in this case his wife, kneeling in adoration of the Virgin and Child as a form of donor portrait. In expensive books, miniature cycles showed the &quot;Life of the Virgin&quot; or the Passion of Christ in eight scenes decorating the eight &quot;Hours of the Virgin&quot;, and the Labours of the Months and signs of the zodiac decorating the calendar. Secular scenes of calendar cycles include many of the best known images from books of hours, and played an important role in the early history of landscape painting.

From the 14th century decorated borders round the edges of at least important pages were common in heavily illuminated books, including books of hours. At the beginning of the 15th century these were still usually based on foliage designs, and painted on a plain background, but by the second half of the century coloured or patterned backgrounds with images of all sorts of objects, were used in luxury books.

Second-hand books of hours were often modified for new owners, even among royalty. After defeating Richard III, Henry VII gave Richard&#x27;s book of hours to his mother, who modified it to include her name. Heraldry was usually erased or over-painted by new owners. Many have handwritten annotations, personal additions and marginal notes but some new owners also commissioned new craftsmen to include more illustrations or texts. Sir Thomas Lewkenor of Trotton hired an illustrator to add details to what is now known as the &quot;Lewkenor Hours&quot;. Flyleaves of some surviving books include notes of household accounting or records of births and deaths, in the manner of later family bibles. Some owners had also collected autographs of notable visitors to their house. Books of hours were often the only book in a house, and were commonly used to teach children to read, sometimes having a page with the alphabet to assist this.

Towards the end of the 15th century, printers produced books of hours with woodcut illustrations, and the book of hours was one of the main works decorated in the related metalcut technique.

==The luxury book of hours==
In the 14th century the book of hours overtook the psalter as the most common vehicle for lavish illumination. This partly reflected the increasing dominance of illumination both commissioned and executed by laymen rather than monastic clergy. From the late 14th century a number of bibliophile royal figures began to collect luxury illuminated manuscripts for their decorations, a fashion that spread across Europe from the Valois courts of France and the Burgundy, as well as Prague under Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and later Wenceslaus. A generation later, Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy was the most important collector of manuscripts, with several of his circle also collecting. It was during this period that the Flemish cities overtook Paris as the leading force in illumination, a position they retained until the terminal decline of the illuminated manuscript in the early 16th century.

The most famous collector of all, the French prince John, Duke of Berry (1340–1416) owned several books of hours, some of which survive, including the most celebrated of all, the &quot;Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry&quot;. This was begun around 1410 by the Limbourg brothers, although left incomplete by them, and decoration continued over several decades by other artists and owners. The same was true of the &quot;Turin-Milan Hours&quot;, which also passed through Berry&#x27;s ownership.

By the mid-15th century, a much wider group of nobility and rich businesspeople were able to commission highly decorated, often small, books of hours. With the arrival of printing, the market contracted sharply, and by 1500 the finest quality books were once again being produced only for royal or very grand collectors. One of the last major illuminated book of hours was the &quot;Farnese Hours&quot; completed for the Roman Cardinal Alessandro Farnese in 1546 by Giulio Clovio, who was also the last major manuscript illuminator.

<text>Stover are the leaves and stalks of field crops, such as corn (maize), sorghum or soybean that are commonly left in a field after harvesting the grain. It is similar to straw, the residue left after any cereal grain or grass has been harvested at maturity for its seed. It can be directly grazed by cattle or dried for use as fodder. Stover has attracted some attention as a potential fuel source, and as biomass for fermentation or as a feedstock for cellulosic ethanol production. Stover from various crops can also be used in mushroom compost preparation.

The word &quot;stover&quot; derives from the English legal term &quot;estovers&quot;, referring to the right of tenants to cut timber.

<doc id="865117" wikidata="Q211062" url="?curid=865117" title="Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry">
<text>The &#x27; (; ), or &#x27;, is an illuminated manuscript that was created between and 1416. It is a book of hours, which is a Christian devotional book and a collection of prayers said at canonical hours. The manuscript was created for John, Duke of Berry, the brother of King Charles V of France, by Limbourg brothers Paul, Johan and Herman. The book is now MS 65 in the Musée Condé, Chantilly, France. 

Consisting of a total of 206 leaves of very fine quality parchment, in height by in width, the manuscript contains 66 large miniatures and 65 small. The design of the book, which is long and complex, has undergone many changes and reversals. Many artists contributed to its miniatures, calligraphy, initials, and marginal decorations, but determining their precise number and identity remains a matter of debate. Painted largely by artists from the Low Countries, often using rare and costly pigments and gold, and with an unusually large number of illustrations, the book is one of the most lavish late medieval illuminated manuscripts. The work was created in the late artistic phase of the International Gothic style.

When the Limbourg brothers and their sponsor died in 1416 (possibly victims of plague) the manuscript was left unfinished. It was further added upon in the 1440s by an anonymous painter, who many art historians believe was Barthélemy d&#x27;Eyck. In 1485–1489, it was brought to its present state by the painter Jean Colombe on behalf of the Duke of Savoy. It was acquired by the Duc d&#x27;Aumale in 1856.

After three centuries in obscurity, the Très Riches Heures gained wide recognition in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, despite having only very limited public exposure at the Musée Condé. Its miniatures helped to shape an ideal image of the Middle Ages in the collective imagination, often being interpreted to serve political and nationalist agendas. This is particularly true for the calendar images, which are the most commonly reproduced. They offer vivid representations of peasants performing agricultural work as well as aristocrats in formal attire, against a background of remarkable medieval architecture.

==Historical context==
The &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the book of hours in Europe took place from 1350 to 1480; the book of hours became popular in France around 1400 (Longnon, Cazelles and Meiss 1969). At this time many major French artists undertook manuscript illumination.

===Duke of Berry===
John, Duke of Berry, is the French prince for whom the &quot;Très Riches Heures&quot; was made. Berry was the third son of the future king of France, John the Good, and the brother and uncle of the next two kings. Little is known of Berry&#x27;s education, but it is certain that he spent his adolescence among arts and literature (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). The young prince lived an extravagant life, necessitating frequent loans. He commissioned many works of art, which he amassed in his Saint Chapelle mansion. Upon Berry&#x27;s death in 1416, a final inventory was done on his estate that described the incomplete and unbound gatherings of the book as the &quot;très riches heures&quot; (&quot;very rich[ly decorated] hours&quot;) to distinguish it from the 15 other books of hours in Berry&#x27;s collection, including the Belles Heures (&quot;beautiful hours&quot;) and Petites Heures (&quot;little hours&quot;) (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988).

===Provenance===
The Très Riches Heures has changed ownership many times since its creation. The gatherings were certainly in Berry&#x27;s estate on his death in 1416, but after this little is clear until 1485. A good deal is known about the lengthy and messy disposal of Berry&#x27;s goods to satisfy his many creditors, which was disrupted by the insanity of the king and the Burgundian and English occupation of Paris, but there are no references to the manuscript. It seems to have been in Paris for much of this period, and probably earlier; some borders suggest the style of the Parisian Bedford Master&#x27;s workshop, and works from the 1410s to the 1440s by the Bedford workshop — later taken over by the Dunois Master — use border designs from other pages, suggesting that the manuscript was available for copying in Paris.

Duke Charles I of Savoy acquired the manuscript, probably as a gift, and commissioned Jean Colombe to complete the manuscript around 1485–1489. Sixteenth-century Flemish artists imitated the figures or entire compositions found in the calendar (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). The manuscript belonged to Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy (1480–1530), Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1507 to 1515 and again from 1519 to 1530. She was the second wife of Charles&#x27; son in law. 

After this its history is unknown until the 18th century, when it was given its present bookbinding with the arms of the Serra family of Genoa, Italy.

It was inherited from the Serras by Baron Felix de Margherita of Turin and Milan. The French Orleanist pretender, Henri d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Aumale, then in exile at Twickenham near London, bought it from the baron in 1856. On his return to France in 1871 Aumale placed it in his library at the Château de Chantilly, which he bequeathed to the Institut de France as the home of the Musée Condé.

===Recent history===
When Aumale saw the manuscript in Genoa he was able to recognize it as a commission of Berry, probably because he was familiar with a set of plates of other manuscripts of Berry published in 1834, and subsidized by the government of the duke&#x27;s father, King Louis Philippe I. Aumale gave the German art historian Gustav Friedrich Waagen breakfast and a private view of the manuscript at Orleans House, just in time for a 10-page account to appear in Waagen&#x27;s &quot;Galleries and Cabinets of Art in Great Britain&quot; in 1857, so beginning its rise to fame. He also exhibited it in 1862 to the members of the Fine Arts Club.

The connection with the &quot;très riches heures&quot; listed in the 1416 inventory was made by Léopold Victor Delisle of the Bibliothèque nationale de France and communicated to Aumale in 1881, before being published in 1884 in the &quot;Gazette des Beaux-Arts&quot;; it has never been seriously disputed. The manuscript took pride of place in a three-part article on all of Berry&#x27;s manuscripts then known, and was the only one illustrated, with four plates in heliogravure. However the manuscript was called the &quot;Grandes Heures du duc de Berry&quot; in this, a title now given to another manuscript, based on its larger page size. The name &quot;Heures de Chantilly&quot; was also used in the next decades.

A monograph with 65 heliogravure plates was published by Paul Durrieu in 1904, to coincide with a major exhibition of French Gothic art in Paris where it was exhibited in the form of 12 plates from the Durrieu monograph, as the terms of Aumale&#x27;s bequest forbade its removal from Chantilly. The work became increasingly famous, and increasingly reproduced. The first colour reproductions, using the technique of photogravure, appeared in 1940 in the French art quarterly &quot;Verve&quot;. Each issue of this lavish magazine cost three hundred francs. In January 1948, the very popular American photo-magazine &quot;Life&quot; published a feature with full-page reproductions of the 12 calendar scenes, at a little larger than their actual size but at very low-quality. Catering to American sensibilities of the time, the magazine censored one of the images by retouching the genitals of the peasant in the February scene. The Musée Condé decided in the 1980s, somewhat controversially, to remove the manuscript completely both from public display and scholarly access, replacing it with copies of a complete modern facsimile. Michael Camille argues that this completes the logic of the reception history of a work that has almost entirely become famous through reproductions of its images, with the most famous images having been seen in the original by only a very small number of people.

==Artists==
There has been much debate regarding the identity and number of artists who contributed to the Très Riches Heures.

===The Limbourg brothers===
In 1884, Léopold Delisle correlated the manuscript with the description of an item in an inventory drawn up after Berry&#x27;s death: &quot;several gatherings of a very rich book of hours [&quot;très riches heures&quot;], richly historiated and illuminated, that Pol [Paul] and his brothers made&quot;. Delisle&#x27;s resulting attribution to Paul de Limbourg and his two brothers, Jean and Herman, &quot;has received general acceptance and also provided the manuscript with its name.&quot;

The three Limbourg brothers had originally worked under the supervision of Berry&#x27;s brother, Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, on a Bible Moralisée and had come to work for Berry after Philip&#x27;s death. By 1411, the Limbourgs were permanent members of Berry&#x27;s household (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). It is also generally agreed that another of Berry&#x27;s books of hours, the Belles Heures, completed between 1408 and 1409, can also be attributed to the brothers. It is thought that the Limbourg contribution to the Très Riches Heures was between about 1412 and their deaths in 1416. Documentation from 1416 was found indicating that Jean, followed by Paul and Herman, had died. Jean de Berry died later that year (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). Apart from the main campaign of illumination, the text, border decorations, and gilding were most likely executed by assistants or specialists who remain unknown.

The choice of castles in the calendar is one factor in the dating of the brothers&#x27; contribution. The Château of Bicêtre, just outside Paris, was one of Berry&#x27;s grandest residences, but does not appear in the calendar. It seems likely that this was because no image had been created by October 1411, when a large mob from Paris looted it and set it on fire in the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War. However the châteaux at Dourdan (April) and Étampes (July) are both shown, although Berry lost them to the Burgundians at the end of 1411, with Étampes being badly damaged in the siege.

===Jean Colombe===
Folio 75 of the Très Riches Heures includes Duke Charles I of Savoy and his wife. The two were married in 1485 and the Duke died in 1489, implying that it was not one of the original folios. The second painter was identified by Paul Durrieu as Jean Colombe, who was paid 25 gold pieces by the Duke to complete certain canonical hours (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988).
There were some miniatures which were incomplete and needed filling in, for example, the foreground figures and faces of the miniature illustrating the Office of the Dead, known as the &quot;Funeral of Raymond Diocrès&quot;.

There are other subtle differences between the miniatures created by the Limbourgs and Colombe. Colombe chose to set large miniatures in frames of marble and gold columns. His faces are less delicate, with more pronounced features. He also used a very intense blue paint that is seen in the landscape of some miniatures. Colombe is worked in his own style without attempting to imitate that of the Limbourgs (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). In folio 75 he followed the Limbourgs by including a depiction of one of his patron&#x27;s castles in the Duchy of Savoy in the landscape background.

===The Intermediate Painter===
The &quot;intermediate painter&quot;, also called the Master of the Shadows, as shadows are an element of his style, is often thought to be Barthélemy van Eyck (strictly the miniaturist known as the Master of René of Anjou, who is now normally identified with the documented painter Barthélemy van Eyck) who would probably have been at work in the 1440s. Other scholars put his work as early as the 1420s, though there is no documentation for this. At any rate, the intermediate artist is assumed to have worked on the manuscript sometime between 1416 and 1485. Evidence from the artistic style, as well as the details of costume, suggests that the Limbourgs did not paint some of the calendar miniatures. Figures in the miniatures for January, April, May, and August are dressed in styles from 1420. The figures strolling in October are dressed in a sober fashion indicative of the mid-fifteenth century. It is known that the gatherings fell into hands of King Charles VII after Berry&#x27;s death, and it is assumed that the intermediate painter is associated with his court (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988).

Catherine Reynolds, in an article of 2005, approached the dating of the &quot;intermediate painter&quot;&#x27;s work through the borrowings from it visible in the work of other Parisian illuminators, and placed it in the late 1430s or at the start of the 1440s. This is inconveniently early for what she describes as the &quot;generally accepted&quot; identification with Barthélemy van Eyck, and in any case she detects a number of stylistic differences between van Eyck and the &quot;intermediate painter.&quot; Jonathan Alexander sees no stylistic need to hypothesize an intermediate painter at all.
===Attribution of the calendar miniatures===
The artists of the calendar miniatures have been identified as follows (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988):
*January: Jean
*February: Paul
*March: Paul and Colombe
*April: Jean
*May: Jean
*June: Paul, Jean, Herman, and Colombe (?)
*July: Paul
*August: Jean
*September: Paul and Colombe
*October: Paul and Colombe (?)
*November: Colombe
*December: Paul

Pognon gives the following breakdown of the main miniatures in the Calendar, using more cautious stylistic names for the artists:
* January: the courtly painter
* February: the rustic painter
* March: the courtly painter (landscape) and the Master of the Shadows (figures)
* April: the courtly painter
* May: the courtly painter
* June: the rustic painter
* July: the rustic painter
* August: the courtly painter
* September: the rustic painter (landscape)? and the Master of the Shadows (figures)
* October: the Master of the Shadows
* November: Jean Colombe
* December: the Master of the Shadows

In addition Pognon identifies the &quot;pious painter&quot; who painted many of the religious scenes later in the book during the initial campaign. The &quot;courtly&quot;, &quot;rustic&quot; and &quot;pious&quot; painters would probably equate to the three Limbourg brothers, or perhaps other artists in their workshop. There are alternative analyses and divisions proposed by other specialists.

==Function==
A breviary consists of a number of prayers and readings in a short form, generally for use by the clergy. The book of hours is a simplified form of breviary designed for use by the laity where the prayers are intended for recital at the canonical hours of the liturgical day. Canonical hours refer to the division of day and night for the purpose of prayers. The regular rhythm of reading led to the term &quot;book of hours&quot;.(Cazelles and Rathofer 1988)

The book of hours consists of prayers and devotional exercises, freely arranged into primary, secondary and supplementary texts. Other than the calendar at the beginning, the order is random and can be customized for the recipient or region. The Hours of the Virgin were regarded as the most important, and therefore subject to the most lavish illustration. The Très Riches Heures is rare in that it includes several miracles performed before the commencement of the passion (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988).

==Calendar gallery==
Fuller descriptions are available at a University of Chicago website.
==Technique==
===Vellum===
The parchment or vellum used in the 206 folios is fine quality calfskin. All bi-folios are complete rectangles and the edges are unblemished and therefore must have been cut from the centre of skins of sufficient size. The folios measure 30 cm in height by 21.5 cm in width, although the original size was larger as evidenced by several cuts into the miniatures. The tears and natural flaws in the vellum are infrequent and almost go unnoticed (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988).

===Illustrations===
The ground colors were moistened with water and thickened with either gum Arabic or tragacanth gum. Approximately ten shades are used besides white and black. The detailed work required extremely small brushes and probably a lens (Longnon, Cazelles and Meiss 1969).

==Contents==
The contents of the book are typical of those of a book of hours, though the quantity of illumination is extremely unusual.

*The Calendar: Folios 1–13
::A generalized calendar (not specific to any year) of church feasts and saints&#x27; days, often illuminated with representations of the Labours of the Months, is a usual part of a book of hours, but the illustrations of the months in the &quot;Très Riches Heures&quot; are exceptional and innovative in their size, and the best known element of the decoration of the manuscript. Up to this point any scenes of the labours had been smaller images on the same page as the calendar text, though later 15th-century calendars often adopted the Limbourg&#x27;s innovation of a full-page miniature, though most had smaller pages than here. They were also unprecedented in mostly showing one of the duke&#x27;s castles in the background. They are filled with details of the delights and labors of the months, from the Duke&#x27;s court to his peasants, a counterpart to the prayers of the hours. Each illustration is surmounted with its appropriate hemisphere showing a solar chariot, the signs and degrees of the zodiac, and numbering the days of the month and the martyrological letters for the ecclesiastic lunar calendar. Each month of the calendar is allotted an opening of two pages, on the righthand page the calendar listing notable feast days and on the left the miniature. January is the largest miniature in the calendar and includes the Duke of Berry at a New Year’s Day feast (Longnon, Cazelles and Meiss 1969).

::Several of the miniatures depict the Duke, fields or castles he owned, and places he visited. This shows the personal function of the book of hours, as it is customized to suit the patron (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988).

::The September miniature was almost certainly painted in two phases: first, the upper section with the sky and château was painted in the middle of the fifteenth century, around 1438–1442, in the time of René d’Anjou and Yolande d’Aragon; then the lower scene of grape-picking was completed by Jean Colombe from a sketch left by his predecessor. In general, artists started with the background, then painted in the characters before finishing with their faces.

::In the foreground, it is grape-picking time. The woman in a white and red apron looks pregnant. Other young peasants are picking the purple bunches, while one of them is tasting the grapes. A further character holding a basket is walking towards a mule which is carrying two panniers. The grapes are being loaded either into the mules&#x27; panniers or into the vats on the cart pulled by two oxen.

::In the background stands the Château de Saumur with its chimneys and weathervanes decorated with golden fleurs-de-lys. It was built by Louis II d&#x27;Anjou then given to his wife Yolande d’Aragon, the mother of King René and mother-in-law of Charles VII, over whom she had a considerable sway. The presence of this château can be explained by the important role played by Yolande in the early years of the reign of Charles VII and by how much the king enjoyed staying there. On the left, behind the enceinte, stands a clock-tower, the chimneys of the kitchens and a gate leading to a drawbridge. A horse is coming out and a woman with a basket on her head is on her way in.

::In front of the château, between the vines and the moat can be seen a tilting ground surrounded by palisades, where tournaments were held.

::The architectural design of the château draws the gaze up towards the dreamily poetic volutes. The towers conceal their protective nature beneath festive trappings, redolent of fabulous adventures in the forests of Arthurian legends and suggestive of the presence of God in His creation. As François Cali put it: &quot;These extravagant towers are a dream landscape with constellations of canopies, pinnacles, gables and arrows, with their crockets fluttering against the light.&quot;

::In the middle of the grape pickers, a character is showing his behind. This intentionally grotesque touch contrasts with the extraordinary elegance of the château. Jean Colombe&#x27;s peasants lack the dignity they have in the other miniatures.
*Anatomical Zodiac Man: Folio 14
::The Anatomical Zodiac Man concludes the calendar. The twelve signs of the zodiac appear over the corresponding anatomical regions. It contains Berry&#x27;s coat of arms of three fleurs-de-lis on a blue background. Such an image appears in no other book of hours, but astrology was one of Berry&#x27;s interests, and several works on the subject were in Berry&#x27;s library. The two figures are sometimes regarded as male and (looking out at the viewer) female, but Pognon finds both &quot;strangely hermaphrodite&quot;, and intentionally so.

*Readings from the Gospels: Folios 17–19
*Prayers to the Virgin: Folios 22–25
*Fall of Man: Folio 25
::This part is represented in four stages within the same miniature. The Fall of Man is thought to have been by Jean de Limbourg and was to belong to a series of miniatures not originally intended for the Très Riches Heures.

*Hours of the Virgin Matins: Folios 26–60
::Illustrated with a cycle of the Life of the Virgin, with the page showing the &quot;Rest on the Flight to Egypt&quot; by Jean Colombe.

*Psalms: Folio 61–63
::The illustrations for the psalms employ a literal interpretation of the text that is rare for the late medieval period (Manion 1995).

*The Penitential Psalms: Folio 64–71
::This section begins with the &quot;Fall of the Angels&quot;, which bears a lot of similarity to a panel painting by a Sienese painter dating from 1340 to 1348, now at the Louvre (Longnon, Cazelles and Meiss 1969). The Limbourgs may have known this work. This miniature has been identified as not originally intended for the Très Riches Heures. The final opening has a double-page image of the &quot;Procession of Saint Gregory&quot; that surrounds the text columns, with depictions of the skyline of Rome.

*Hours of the Cross: Folios 75–78
::In this section Christ is depicted as the Man of Sorrows, exhibiting wounds and surrounded by instruments of the passion. This is a common iconographic type in fourteenth-century manuscripts (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988).

*Hours of the Holy Ghost: Folios 79–81
*Office of the Dead: Folios 82–107
::Colombe painted all the miniatures of this section, other than “Hell”, which was painted by a Limbourg brother. “Hell” is based on a description from a thirteenth-century Irish monk Tundal (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). This miniature may not have been originally intended for the manuscript. Meiss and subsequent writers have argued that the full-page miniatures that codicological data show were inserted on single leaves were not originally designed for the Très Riches Heures (including the &quot;Anatomical Man&quot;, folio 14v; &quot;The Fall&quot;, folio 25r; the &quot;Meeting of the Magi&quot;, folio 51v; the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;, folio 52r; the &quot;Presentation&quot;, folio 54v; the &quot;Fall of the Rebel Angels&quot;, folio 64v; &quot;Hell&quot;, folio 108r; the &quot;Map of Rome&quot;, folio 141v). Margaret Manion, however, has suggested that, &quot;although the subjects are handled in an innovative manner, they fit within the context of the prayerbook and could well have been part of a developing collaborative plan.&quot;

::The funeral image shows a reputed incident at the funeral of Raymond Diocres, a famous Parisian preacher, when in the middle of his Requiem Mass he was said to have lifted up his coffin lid, and announced to the congregation &quot;I have been condemned to the just judgement of God&quot;.

*Short Weekday Offices: Folios 109–140
::The &quot;Presentation of the Virgin&quot; takes place in front of Bourges Cathedral, in Berry&#x27;s ducal capital (Longnon, Cazelles and Meiss 1969).

*Plan of Rome: Folio 141
*Hour of the Passion: Folio 142–157
*Masses for the Liturgical Year: Folios 158–204
::Folio 201 depicts the martyrdom of Andrew the Apostle. The Duke of Berry was born on Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day, 1340; consequently this miniature was of great importance to him (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988).

==Stylistic analysis==
The Limbourg brothers had artistic freedom but worked within a framework of the religious didactic manuscript. Several artistic innovations by the Limbourg brothers can be noticed in the Très Riches Heures. In the October miniature, the study of light was momentous for Western painting (Cazelles and Rathofer 1988). People were shown reflected in the water, the earliest representation of this type of reflection known thus far. Miniature scenes had new informality, with no strong framing forms at the edges. This allowed for continuity beyond the frame of view to be vividly defined. The Limbourgs developed a more naturalistic mode of representation and developed portraiture of people and surroundings. Religious figures do not inhabit free open space and courtiers are framed by vegetation. This is reminiscent of a more classical representation (Longnon, Cazelles and Meiss 1969). Some conventions used by the Limbourgs, such as a diaper background or the portrayal of night, were influenced by artists such as Taddeo Gaddi. These conventions were transformed completely into the artist&#x27;s unique interpretation (Longnon, Cazelles and Meiss 1969).

Manion offers a stylistic analysis of the psalter specifically. The psalters offer a systematic program of illuminations corresponding to the individual psalms. These images are linked together, but are not in the numerical order of the psalter. This emphasizes the idea of the abbreviated psalter, where each psalm is illustrated once (Manion 1995). The miniatures are not modeled on any specific visual or literary precedence when compared with other fourteenth century psalters. The manuscript offers a literal interpretation of the words and lacks a selection of more personal prayers. This emphasizes the didactic use of the book of hours (Manion 1995).

==Restoration and exhibition==
In 2023, a process of restoring the manuscript was launched with the Centre de recherche et de restauration des musées de France. A preliminary study was carried out using ultraviolet, infrared and raking light photographs, as well as hyperspectral and microscopic imaging, in order to analyze the condition of the book but also to provide information on the stages of its creation. These initial analyses made it possible to note the poor condition of the 18th century binding. This is why the first notebooks will be unbound in order to proceed with their restoration. 

This undertaking will make it possible to present these notebooks flat for the first time, and in particular the calendar folios, at a major exhibition in 2025 at the Château de Chantilly, also bringing together the other books of hours of the Duke of Berry.

<text>Nevada State University (NSU), formerly Nevada State College, is a public college in Henderson, Nevada, United States. It is part of the Nevada System of Higher Education and opened on September 3, 2002, as Nevada&#x27;s first state college. The university is a designated Minority Serving Institute, Hispanic Serving Institution, and Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Institution. Its main campus is located on a site in the southern foothills of Henderson.

==History==

In 1999, the Nevada Legislature created the Advisory Committee to Examine Locating a 4-Year State College in Henderson, Nev. In December 1999, the Nevada Board of Regents approved the establishment of Nevada State College.

In February 2000, the committee recommended the new institution be named Nevada State College at Henderson. The committee members determined Henderson should be part of the official name as they felt additional state colleges would be created in the state. Later that month, the Henderson City Council, after having evaluated several potential sites, voted to locate Nevada State College northeast of Lake Mead Drive and Boulder Highway that was to be part of The LandWell Company&#x27;s Provenance master-planned community. In March, James Rogers, owner of several television stations and later chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education, agreed to chair the college&#x27;s foundation.

Opponents of the creation of Nevada State College feared at the time that its creation would take resources from UNLV. However, proponents of the college argued the &quot;proposed college would be up to $3,000 cheaper than educating them at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The savings would come from smaller salaries for professors, who would teach four classes (per semester), rather than the three or fewer taught by UNLV professors.&quot;

In April 2000, the Board of Regents voted 8–3 to begin negotiations for the Boulder Highway / Lake Mead site despite some concerns that the site was near a permanent toxic waste storage facility. The original site of the college, first proposed in 2000 and on approximately 300 acres northeast of Lake Mead Drive and Boulder Highway near downtown Henderson raised environmental concerns as it was approximately one mile from a toxic waste storage facility, which prompted the Nevada Board of Regents in 2001 to select the college&#x27;s present day site located west of U.S. Highway 95 in what was once the Wagon Wheel Industrial Park. In June 2000, the Regents requested $5.2 million for start-up costs for the campus and $7 million for instruction costs for its first cohort of students in 2002-03 as well as $43.5 million for capital construction which was to include a library. Nevada Gov. Guinn&#x27;s 2001-2003 executive budget, which was developed later in 2000, reduced the Regents&#x27; request by recommending &quot;$22.8 million in state funding, 6.8 million to open it to 1,000 full-time students in the fall of 2002, and $16 million to help construct the first campus building.&quot;

Nevada State College opened in 2002. The college acquired accreditation, moved with its master plan for a campus, and its first permanent building, the Liberal Arts and Sciences building, opened in August 2008. In 2008 Nevada State College launched a campus-wide recruitment and retention initiative. Between the Spring 2009 and Spring 2010 semesters, Nevada State College increased enrollment by over 20%, to over 2,600 students.

Among the different educational institutions of the NHSE, the largest 2009 budget cuts by the state legislature were for Nevada State College at 24.1%. Neighboring College of Southern Nevada had its budget cut by only 4.9%. Students protested the cuts which left student services understaffed and about 25% of the university&#x27;s teaching and administrative positions vacant in 2008. The Nevada System of Higher Education faced a $900 million budget deficit and there were proposals to close down Nevada State College along with other NHSE programs and schools.

DeRionne Pollard became Nevada State University&#x27;s eighth president on August 16, 2021. She was the first Black female president within the Nevada System of Higher Education.

In March 2023, the Nevada Legislature introduced legislation to change the school&#x27;s name from Nevada State College to Nevada State University. The legislation passed that June; the name change took effect on July 1, 2023.

==Campus==
Nevada State University&#x27;s site is located at the base of the McCullough mountain range in the southeastern corner of Henderson. The site was conveyed from the Bureau of Land Management to the city of Henderson in November 2002 as part of the Clark County Conservation of Public Lands and Natural Resources Act of 2002.

The college opened its first permanent building, the Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences Building, on its 509-acre site in August 2008. The building has faculty offices, labs and seven classrooms. The building includes SMART classroom technologies which allow professors to use a wide array of audio and visual teaching techniques, and scientific equipment for educational use.

In addition to the Liberal Arts and Sciences Building, NSU has also opened the Bob and Allison Kasner Academic Building (formerly known as Nursing, Science, and Education) along with the James E. and Beverly Roger&#x27;s Student Center. The future Christenson Education Building and the Student Village dorm buildings are currently under construction. NSU currently leases the Dawson building on Nevada State Dr. which was originally the only building when the college opened, and purchased the J. Russell and Carol Raker Student Success Center on Paradise Hills Dr. which contains the financial aid office and student advising. NSU no longer leases two auxiliary buildings in downtown Henderson on Water Street.

In 2010, the Nevada Board of Regents approved the college&#x27;s campus master plan, which calls for the development of roughly six million square feet of academic, residential, retail, and cultural space by full campus build-out in order to accommodate 25,000-30,000 students.

==Academics==
NSU offers one Master&#x27;s degree, the Master of Education in Speech Language Pathology, and many bachelor&#x27;s degree programs. In the Fall of 2008, Nevada State College launched Nevada&#x27;s first bachelor of science degree in the education of the deaf and hard of hearing. The program addresses the deaf culture and its integration of deaf students into specific subject areas. The college&#x27;s academic programs are housed in one of three schools: the School of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences, the School of Education, and the School of Nursing.

Nevada State College also partners with Touro University to accommodate students in Occupational Therapy. Through the partnership, students complete three years of their bachelor&#x27;s degree in Occupational Therapy Science at Nevada State College, then transfer to Touro University for the final two years.

===Accreditation===
When it originally opened, Nevada State College operated under the accreditation of the University of Nevada, Reno. In 2011, Nevada State College received independent accreditation at the baccalaureate degree level from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities.

==Athletics==

As of November 2024, Nevada State University was actively planning to launch a fully-fledged athletics program, to be funded through a proposed student fee. If approved by the state Board of Regents, the funds from the proposed fee would be used to fund a campus athletics and recreation center and the launch of two initial sports, women&#x27;s flag football and men&#x27;s track and field.

<text>In geometry, Euler&#x27;s rotation theorem states that, in three-dimensional space, any displacement of a rigid body such that a point on the rigid body remains fixed, is equivalent to a single rotation about some axis that runs through the fixed point. It also means that the composition of two rotations is also a rotation. Therefore the set of rotations has a group structure, known as a &quot;rotation group&quot;.

The theorem is named after Leonhard Euler, who proved it in 1775 by means of spherical geometry. The axis of rotation is known as an Euler axis, typically represented by a unit vector ê. Its product by the rotation angle is known as an axis-angle vector. The extension of the theorem to kinematics yields the concept of instant axis of rotation, a line of fixed points.

In linear algebra terms, the theorem states that, in 3D space, any two Cartesian coordinate systems with a common origin are related by a rotation about some fixed axis. This also means that the product of two rotation matrices is again a rotation matrix and that for a non-identity rotation matrix one eigenvalue is 1 and the other two are both complex, or both equal to −1. The eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue is the axis of rotation connecting the two systems.

==Euler&#x27;s theorem (1776)==

Euler states the theorem as follows:
Theorema.
&quot;Quomodocunque sphaera circa centrum suum conuertatur, semper assignari potest diameter,&quot;
&quot;cuius directio in situ translato conueniat cum situ initiali.&quot;
or (in English):
When a sphere is moved around its centre it is always possible to find a diameter whose direction in the displaced position is the same as in the initial position.
===Proof===

Euler&#x27;s original proof was made using spherical geometry and therefore whenever he speaks about triangles they must be understood as spherical triangles.

====Previous analysis====
To arrive at a proof, Euler analyses what the situation would look like if the theorem were true. To that end, suppose the yellow line in Figure 1 goes through the center of the sphere and is the axis of rotation we are looking for, and point is one of the two intersection points of that axis with the sphere. Then he considers an arbitrary great circle that does not contain (the blue circle), and its image after rotation (the red circle), which is another great circle not containing . He labels a point on their intersection as point . (If the circles coincide, then can be taken as any point on either; otherwise is one of the two points of intersection.) 

Now is on the initial circle (the blue circle), so its image will be on the transported circle (red). He labels that image as point . Since is also on the transported circle (red), it is the image of another point that was on the initial circle (blue) and he labels that preimage as (see Figure 2). Then he considers the two arcs joining and to . These arcs have the same length because arc is mapped onto arc . Also, since is a fixed point, triangle is mapped onto triangle , so these triangles are isosceles, and arc bisects angle .


====Construction of the best candidate point====
Let us construct a point that could be invariant using the previous considerations. We start with the blue great circle and its image under the transformation, which is the red great circle as in the Figure 1. Let point be a point of intersection of those circles. If ’s image under the transformation is the same point then is a fixed point of the transformation, and since the center is also a fixed point, the diameter of the sphere containing is the axis of rotation and the theorem is proved.

Otherwise we label ’s image as and its preimage as , and connect these two points to with arcs and . These arcs have the same length. Construct the great circle that bisects and locate point on that great circle so that arcs and have the same length, and call the region of the sphere containing and bounded by the blue and red great circles the interior of . (That is, the yellow region in Figure 3.) Then since and is on the bisector of , we also have .

====Proof of its invariance under the transformation====
Now let us suppose that is the image of . Then we know and orientation is preserved, so must be interior to . Now is transformed to , so . Since is also the same length as , then and . But , so and . Therefore is the same point as . In other words, is a fixed point of the transformation, and since the center is also a fixed point, the diameter of the sphere containing is the axis of rotation.

====Final notes about the construction====
Euler also points out that can be found by intersecting the perpendicular bisector of with the angle bisector of , a construction that might be easier in practice. He also proposed the intersection of two planes:

*the symmetry plane of the angle (which passes through the center of the sphere), and
*the symmetry plane of the arc (which also passes through ).

:Proposition. These two planes intersect in a diameter. This diameter is the one we are looking for.

:Proof. Let us call either of the endpoints (there are two) of this diameter over the sphere surface. Since is mapped on and the triangles have the same angles, it follows that the triangle is transported onto the triangle . Therefore the point has to remain fixed under the movement.

:Corollaries. This also shows that the rotation of the sphere can be seen as two consecutive reflections about the two planes described above. Points in a mirror plane are invariant under reflection, and hence the points on their intersection (a line: the axis of rotation) are invariant under both the reflections, and hence under the rotation.

Another simple way to find the rotation axis is by considering the plane on which the points , , lie. The rotation axis is obviously orthogonal to this plane, and passes through the center of the sphere.

Given that for a rigid body any movement that leaves an axis invariant is a rotation, this also proves that any arbitrary composition of rotations is equivalent to a single rotation around a new axis.

==Matrix proof==
A spatial rotation is a linear map in one-to-one correspondence with a rotation matrix that transforms a coordinate vector into , that is . Therefore, another version of Euler&#x27;s theorem is that for every rotation , there is a nonzero vector for which ; this is exactly the claim that is an eigenvector of associated with the eigenvalue 1. Hence it suffices to prove that 1 is an eigenvalue of ; the rotation axis of will be the line , where is the eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.

A rotation matrix has the fundamental property that its inverse is its transpose, that is
:formula_1
where is the identity matrix and superscript T indicates the transposed matrix. 

Compute the determinant of this relation to find that a rotation matrix has determinant ±1. In particular,
:formula_2

A rotation matrix with determinant +1 is a proper rotation, and one with a negative determinant −1 is an &quot;improper rotation&quot;, that is a reflection combined with a proper rotation.

It will now be shown that a proper rotation matrix has at least one invariant vector , i.e., . Because this requires that , we see that the vector must be an eigenvector of the matrix with eigenvalue . Thus, this is equivalent to showing that .

Use the two relations
:formula_3
for any matrix A and
:formula_4
(since ) to compute
:formula_5

This shows that is a root (solution) of the characteristic equation, that is,
:formula_6

In other words, the matrix is singular and has a non-zero kernel, that is, there is at least one non-zero vector, say , for which
:formula_7

The line for real is invariant under , i.e., is a rotation axis. This proves Euler&#x27;s theorem.
==Equivalence of an orthogonal matrix to a rotation matrix==
Two matrices (representing linear maps) are said to be equivalent if there is a change of basis that makes one equal to the other. A proper orthogonal matrix is always equivalent (in this sense) to either the following matrix or to its vertical reflection:
:formula_8

Then, any orthogonal matrix is either a rotation or an improper rotation. A general orthogonal matrix has only one real eigenvalue, either +1 or −1. When it is +1 the matrix is a rotation. When −1, the matrix is an improper rotation.

If has more than one invariant vector then and . &quot;Any&quot; vector is an invariant vector of .

===Excursion into matrix theory===
In order to prove the previous equation some facts from matrix theory must be recalled.

An matrix has orthogonal eigenvectors if and only if is normal, that is, if . This result is equivalent to stating that normal matrices can be brought to diagonal form by a unitary similarity transformation:
:formula_9
and is unitary, that is,
:formula_10
The eigenvalues are roots of the characteristic equation. If the matrix happens to be unitary (and note that unitary matrices are normal), then
:formula_11
and it follows that the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix are on the unit circle in the complex plane:
:formula_12
Also an orthogonal (real unitary) matrix has eigenvalues on the unit circle in the complex plane. Moreover, since its characteristic equation (an th order polynomial in ) has real coefficients, it follows that its roots appear in complex conjugate pairs, that is, if is a root then so is . There are 3 roots, thus at least one of them must be purely real (+1 or −1).

After recollection of these general facts from matrix theory, we return to the rotation matrix . It follows from its realness and orthogonality that we can find a such that:
:formula_13
If a matrix can be found that gives the above form, and there is only one purely real component and it is −1, then we define formula_14 to be an improper rotation. Let us only consider the case, then, of matrices R that are proper rotations (the third eigenvalue is just 1). The third column of the matrix will then be equal to the invariant vector . Writing and for the first two columns of , this equation gives
:formula_15
If has eigenvalue 1, then and has also eigenvalue 1, which implies that in that case . In general, however, as
formula_16 implies that also formula_17 holds, so formula_18 can be chosen for formula_19. Similarly, formula_20 can result in a formula_21 with real entries only, for a proper rotation matrix formula_14. 
Finally, the matrix equation is transformed by means of a unitary matrix,
:formula_23
which gives
:formula_24
The columns of are orthonormal as it is a unitary matrix with real-valued entries only, due to its definition above, that formula_25 is the complex conjugate of formula_19 and that formula_21 is a vector with real-valued components. The third column is still formula_28 , the other two columns of are perpendicular to . We can now see how our definition of improper rotation corresponds with the geometric interpretation: an improper rotation is a rotation around an axis (here, the axis corresponding to the third coordinate) and a reflection on a plane perpendicular to that axis. If we only restrict ourselves to matrices with determinant 1, we can thus see that they must be proper rotations. This result implies that any orthogonal matrix corresponding to a proper rotation is equivalent to a rotation over an angle around an axis .

==Equivalence classes==
The trace (sum of diagonal elements) of the real rotation matrix given above is . Since a trace is invariant under an orthogonal matrix similarity transformation,
:formula_29
it follows that all matrices that are equivalent to by such orthogonal matrix transformations have the same trace: the trace is a &quot;class function&quot;. This matrix transformation is clearly an equivalence relation, that is, all such equivalent matrices form an equivalence class. 

In fact, all proper rotation rotation matrices form a group, usually denoted by SO(3) (the special orthogonal group in 3 dimensions) and all matrices with the same trace form an equivalence class in this group. All elements of such an equivalence class &quot;share their rotation angle&quot;, but all rotations are around different axes. If is an eigenvector of with eigenvalue 1, then is also an eigenvector of T, also with eigenvalue 1. Unless , and are different.

==Applications==
===Generators of rotations===
Suppose we specify an axis of rotation by a unit vector , and suppose we have an infinitely small rotation of angle about that vector. Expanding the rotation matrix as an infinite addition, and taking the first order approach, the rotation matrix is represented as:

: formula_30

A finite rotation through angle about this axis may be seen as a succession of small rotations about the same axis. Approximating as where is a large number, a rotation of about the axis may be represented as:

:formula_31

It can be seen that Euler&#x27;s theorem essentially states that &quot;all&quot; rotations may be represented in this form. The product is the &quot;generator&quot; of the particular rotation, being the vector associated with the matrix . This shows that the rotation matrix and the axis–angle format are related by the exponential function.

One can derive a simple expression for the generator . One starts with an arbitrary plane (in Euclidean space) defined by a pair of perpendicular unit vectors and . In this plane one can choose an arbitrary vector with perpendicular . One then solves for in terms of and substituting into an expression for a rotation in a plane yields the rotation matrix which includes the generator .

:formula_32

To include vectors outside the plane in the rotation one needs to modify the above expression for by including two projection operators that partition the space. This modified rotation matrix can be rewritten as an exponential function.

:formula_33

Analysis is often easier in terms of these generators, rather than the full rotation matrix. Analysis in terms of the generators is known as the Lie algebra of the rotation group.

===Quaternions===
It follows from Euler&#x27;s theorem that the relative orientation of any pair of coordinate systems may be specified by a set of three independent numbers. Sometimes a redundant fourth number is added to simplify operations with quaternion algebra. Three of these numbers are the direction cosines that orient the eigenvector. The fourth is the angle about the eigenvector that separates the two sets of coordinates. Such a set of four numbers is called a quaternion.

While the quaternion described above does not involve complex numbers, if quaternions are used to describe two successive rotations, they must be combined using the non-commutative quaternion algebra derived by William Rowan Hamilton through the use of imaginary numbers.

Rotation calculation via quaternions has come to replace the use of direction cosines in aerospace applications through their reduction of the required calculations, and their ability to minimize round-off errors. Also, in computer graphics the ability to perform spherical interpolation between quaternions with relative ease is of value.

==Generalizations==
In higher dimensions, any rigid motion that preserves a point in dimension or is a composition of at most rotations in orthogonal planes of rotation, though these planes need not be uniquely determined, and a rigid motion may fix multiple axes. Also, any rigid motion that preserves linearly independent points, which span an -dimensional body in dimension or , is a single plane of rotation. To put it another way, if two rigid bodies, with identical geometry, share at least points of &#x27;identical&#x27; locations within themselves, the convex hull of which is -dimensional, then a single planar rotation can bring one to cover the other accurately in dimension or .
A rigid motion in three dimensions that does not necessarily fix a point is a &quot;screw motion&quot;. This is because a composition of a rotation with a translation perpendicular to the axis is a rotation about a parallel axis, while composition with a translation parallel to the axis yields a screw motion; see screw axis. This gives rise to screw theory.

<text>Hydrozincite, also known as zinc bloom or marionite, is a white carbonate mineral consisting of Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6. It is usually found in massive rather than crystalline form.

It occurs as an oxidation product of zinc ores and as post mine incrustations. It occurs associated with smithsonite, hemimorphite, willemite, cerussite, aurichalcite, calcite and limonite.

It was first described in 1853 for an occurrence in Bad Bleiberg, Carinthia, Austria and named for its chemical content.

<doc id="865158" wikidata="Q5375137" url="?curid=865158" title="Ena Sharples">
<text>Ena Sharples (also Schofield) is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, played by Violet Carson. She appeared in the first episode, broadcast on 9 December 1960, and stayed with the show until 2 April 1980.

==Development==
Ena was the widowed caretaker of the Glad Tidings Mission Hall and spent much of her time criticising the activities and loose morals of the street&#x27;s other residents. One of the main characters during the 1960s, she was featured less regularly in the 1970s due to the declining health of actress Violet Carson and was written out in 1980. Almost always wearing a double-breasted overcoat and hairnet, she spent much of her free time in the serial&#x27;s early years with her two cronies, Martha Longhurst (Lynne Carol) and Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant), in the snug bar of local pub The Rovers Return Inn, drinking milk stout. Ena particularly criticised Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix), who she believed had loose morals. In turn, Elsie strongly disliked Ena for her seemingly incessant gossip and desire to know about the private lives of others, and the two confronted each other frequently.

The final episode featuring Ena was broadcast on 2 April 1980. It attracted little media or public attention, as the producers intended for her to continue in the serial and the character was merely going to stay with a friend, Henry Foster, in St Annes while her flat in Coronation Street was being renovated. However, all subsequent storylines involving Ena had to be scrapped owing to Carson developing symptoms of pernicious anemia and becoming too ill to appear.

Carson died on Boxing Day 1983 at the age of 85. No further mention of Ena was made, and it was assumed she had moved to St Annes permanently. The first reference to her after this was in the 1985 spin-off video &quot;The Jubilee Years&quot; when Ken Barlow revealed that Ena died &quot;a couple of years ago&quot;, placing her death around the same time as that of Carson&#x27;s. The first mention of Ena&#x27;s death in the show itself was on 27 November 1989, during a scene in the Rovers Return when Deirdre says to builder Maurice Jones: &quot;Ena Sharples would be turning in her grave.&quot;

In 2010, a short online video titled &quot;Ken: A Life on the Street&quot; reiterated that she was no longer alive when Ken Barlow (William Roache) told his grandson Simon (Alex Bain) that she was &quot;long dead now&quot;. This is available as an extra on the &quot;Tram Crash&quot; DVD, released in 2011.

==Storylines==

===Backstory===
Ena Schofield was born in Weatherfield on 24 November 1899. She had two elder siblings, Alice Raynold (née Schofield) (1885–1965) and Tom Schofield (d. 1973). During her school days Ena met Martha Hartley (Lynne Carol) and Minnie Carlton (Margot Bryant), establishing lifelong friendships. An attentive student with a strong Christian upbringing, Ena became devoted to her religion and developed a firm belief in the importance of rules, regulations and morals. She also quickly learned to be self-sufficient, taking on factory work when she was only eleven.

In 1915, Ena became engaged to Phil Moss, nephew of Gladys Arkwright, her mentor at the Glad Tidings Mission Hall. However, he enlisted for military service in the Great War and was killed in battle, devastating Ena. In 1914, Ena had become friends with Albert Tatlock after Dinky Low, a local boy Ena had a crush on, asked her to write to Albert. Ena and Albert became close enough that he would stay with her family while on leave but, when he asked her if she wanted to be more than friends, she declined, stating that she was still mourning Phil. Around 1917, Ena met Alfred Sharples, who had been sent home because of a leg injury. There was an instant chemistry, but Ena was upset to learn he was already married, and broke contact with him. When the war ended Alfred and Ena met up again and he told her that his marriage had been in name only – he&#x27;d had to marry the daughter of someone his father had owed money to. Alfred also informed Ena that his wife had recently died, so Ena decided to give him another chance. Ena married Alfred in 1920 and they had three children: Vera, Madge and Ian. Ian died after only two days and Alfred died in 1937 during the Depression, leaving Ena a widow with two children. As Vera and Madge grew up Ena alienated them through her judgemental and frequently interfering nature – a point of much contention for Ena. Madge and her mother became almost completely estranged after Madge emigrated in 1950.

===1960–1980===
In 1960, Ena was in conflict with the Mission&#x27;s new lay preacher Leonard Swindley (Arthur Lowe), who objected to her frequenting the Rovers. Ena collapsed due to the stress but walked out of hospital to return to her post so that Martha Longhurst (Lynne Carol), who had taken on her responsibilities while she recovered, could not steal her job. In 1961, Ena was sacked for spreading a rumour that Coronation Street was being demolished, which turned out to be untrue. Swindley was forced to rehire her when a suitable replacement could not be found (Ena had bribed the other candidates to turn the job down). Still unhappy with the working conditions, however, Ena walked out of the job later in the year and moved in with Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant), with Albert Tatlock (Jack Howarth) briefly taking on the caretaker position. She was eventually offered her job back.

Ena had a health scare in 1962 when she suffered a minor stroke, brought on by hypostatic pneumonia. She quickly regained her speech and mobility, but the following year was diagnosed with arteriosclerosis. Despite her willingness to gossip Ena was very guarded about her private life, and berated Martha for discussing her health problems with Ena&#x27;s daughter, Vera Lomax (Ruth Holden).

Later that year Ena&#x27;s great nephew, Tom Schofield (David Holliday), visited her and invited her to her brother&#x27;s home in the US for an extended stay. Ena jumped at the chance to go abroad for the first time and meet the family she never knew she had. Upon her return, Ena was horrified to see the Mission converted into a Community Centre, with social worker Ruth Winter (Colette O&#x27;Neil) employed there full-time. She quit upon hearing the news and moved in with Minnie at No.5. Despite being out of work, Ena was soon occupied with other problems as Vera came to stay, having separated from her husband Bob Lomax. Vera had debts to pay but not the money to pay them, so Ena gave her the money – even though it was all her savings. A disoriented Ena was later caught accidentally stealing from a supermarket. In court Ena pleaded not guilty, but refused to give her age when questioned, saying only that she was over 21. She was subsequently fined 40 shillings. To offset her money problems Ena took on the job of live-in housekeeper at No.9 for Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson) although, when the Community Centre at the Mission closed down, Ena moved back into the vestry.

Vera came to stay again later in 1966, claiming to be ill. Ena did not believe her until she spoke to Vera&#x27;s doctor, who said that Vera had a brain tumour and had just a month to live; however, Vera had not yet been told that her condition was terminal. Ena watched her daughter decline over several weeks until she died in Ena&#x27;s bed in January 1967.

The Mission was closed permanently a year later, when it was demolished along with the factory to make way for a block of two-storey maisonettes. Ena was offered a place at an old people&#x27;s nursing home, which she unsurprisingly declined, choosing to lodge with her old friend Henry Foster at St. Annes after briefly living with Minnie; nevertheless, when the maisonettes were built Ena moved into No.6, a purpose-built OAP ground floor flat. Ena was pleased, as it occupied the exact spot where the vestry had been.

In 1969, Ena became bored with the maisonette and moved into a flat above Ernest Bishop&#x27;s (Stephen Hancock) camera shop. With Glad Tidings gone, Ena&#x27;s closest place of worship was the Victoria Street Mission, and she kept close tabs on the comings and goings there. She was delighted in 1970 to meet young Tony Parsons (David Hill), who shared her passion for the harmonium. Recognising his talent, Ena made him her protégé and gave him lessons, while seeing about getting him a scholarship.

When the maisonettes were demolished in 1971, one of the buildings which replaced them was a community centre. Despite her age, Ena was determined to secure the position of caretaker, and scared off her competitor Hetty Thorpe (Margery Withers) by warning her about the violence in the area. With no-one else to take the job, Ena was selected for the job, and she moved into a flat adjacent to the centre. Ena&#x27;s age and ability to do the work was a constant concern to the council. A co-caretaker was foisted on her (none other than Albert Tatlock), though she insisted on being called &quot;senior caretaker&quot;. In 1973, Ena suffered two heart attacks, but refused to move away as she wanted to die in the street. When she disappeared with the centre&#x27;s keys at Christmas, preventing the children from getting any presents, Ena assumed she would be sacked and left to stay with Henry Foster in St. Annes. However, she was allowed to keep her job.

Later in the 1970s, Ena alternated between Weatherfield and St. Anne&#x27;s. Her friends gradually left her life – Martha had died in 1964 and Minnie left in 1976 to live at Whaley Bridge with their old friend Handel Gartside (Harry Markham). In 1977, Councillor Tattersall (George Waring) tried to sack Ena so that his niece could take her job, but Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley) fought on Ena&#x27;s behalf. The Lomaxes offered to house Ena in Hartlepool, but she declined. In 1980, Ena dumped herself on Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix) and later Albert, while the flat was being redecorated. Angered by the lack of progress that prevented her from moving back into her home, she left to stay in St. Annes, unsure about whether or not to return to Coronation Street.

Ena was never seen in Weatherfield again, and all subsequent references to her were in the past tense. In 1989, Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) said that, due to recent events in Coronation Street, &quot;Ena Sharples would be turning in her grave&quot;, confirming that she had died by this time.

==Reception==
In a book written about &quot;Women and Soap Opera&quot;, Ena was described as &quot;brusque and uncompromising, refusing to adjust to the changing times&quot;. Ena has also been described as &quot;a &quot;Coronation Street&quot; prototype, a strong, bossy woman&quot;. 
In an interview, Violet Carson described Ena as &quot;the eternal busybody, the rock of ages; when things are going well, she is the old bag, when things are going wrong, she is the first one they turn to&quot;, in another interview she said that &quot;children were not frightened of Mrs. Sharples&quot;, Violet Carson said &quot;children will come and hold Mrs. Sharples&#x27; hand&quot;.
Actor Michael Melia has claimed in an interview that he thought the character of Ena was &quot;the most forbidding face on the street. A harridan in a hairnet with a surly expression that could stop a grown man in his tracks.&quot;

<doc id="865161" wikidata="Q696028" url="?curid=865161" title="Joseph Daul">
<text>Joseph Alexander Daul (born 13 April 1947) is a French politician who served as President of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) from 2013 to 2019. He previously served as Leader of the EPP Group in the European Parliament from 2007 to 2014 and a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from France from 1999 until 2014. He is a member of The Republicans, part of the EPP.

Daul had previously come to prominence as the chairman of the European Parliament&#x27;s powerful Committee on Agriculture, a position he was elected to on 23 July 2004, and previously, from 2002, as chairman of the Conference of Committee Chairmen. He has been mayor of Pfettisheim (Bas-Rhin) since 1989, and is an officer of the Agricultural Order of Merit, knight of the National Order of Merit and knight of the Legion of Honour. In addition to French, he speaks standard German and Alsatian, the Alemannic variety of German spoken in his native Alsace.

== Early life ==
Daul comes from a large family (six brothers and sisters) and at the age of 20 he took over a small family farm of 7 ha which he has since managed with his wife and, for the last few years, his son. While the operation has grown to 75 ha, it is still family run and specialises in beef production and the cultivation of sugar beet. 

== Career in national politics ==
Daul became active in the agricultural trade union movement, through the Centre National des Jeunes Agriculteurs (CNJA – National Centre for Young Farmers). He completed his professional training and general education and in 1976 he was appointed national Vice-Chairman of the CNJA with responsibility for European affairs. Daul also became a member of the Committee of Professional Agricultural Organisations (COPA) and of the European Economic and Social Committee in Brussels.

At the age of 35 he continued his trade union activities beyond the youth sector and combined his professional life as a farmer with positions of responsibility at a regional, (professional organisations, cooperatives, Chamber of Agriculture), national and European levels.

In 1997, when the &#x27;mad cow&#x27; crisis arose, he was chair of the National Federation of Beef Producers in France and of the &#x27;beef&#x27; group in Europe. These activities, together with his experience as mayor of his town (1000 inhabitants) led to a more active role in politics when, in 1999, he was asked to represent the farming and rural communities on the RPR list under Nicolas Sarkozy. Daul also became deputy mayor in his home town, vice-president of the Community of Councils and chairman of the Strasbourg Abattoir Management Cooperative (160 employees).

== Member of the European Parliament ==

After having been elected in 1999, Daul joined the then EPP-ED Group, now EPP Group. Daul became a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, appointed chairman in January 2002.

In 2002, Daul was appointed chairman of the Conference of Committee Chairmen, which is responsible for co-ordinating &#x27;horizontal&#x27; issues affecting the 20 parliamentary committees and for preparing the draft agenda for the plenary part-sessions. As part of the reform of the European Parliament, the Conference put forward proposals for making its work more efficient. Daul also co-chaired, together with the committee chairmen concerned, the hearings of the Commissioners and transmitted the conclusions to the President of the European Parliament.

Finally, in 2005 and 2006, he and Socialist MEP Richard Corbett were Parliament&#x27;s representatives for a new round of negotiations with the Council and Commission on comitology, giving Parliament, for the first time, the right to block the adoption of Commission implementing measures.

The &#x27;Lisbon Strategy&#x27; Group headed by Daul explored questions of employment and in this capacity Daul co-chaired two meetings in 2005 and 2006 between the European Parliament and the national parliaments. As a member of the European Parliament Delegation for the WTO negotiations, Daul formed part of the European Parliament delegation to the ministerial conferences in Seattle (1999), Doha (2001) and Cancun (2003). He was involved in the preparatory work for the ministerial conferences by regularly meeting ambassadors in Geneva to represent the position of the European Parliament.

In January 2007, he was elected chairman of the EPP Group. He remains member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and substitute member of the Committee on International Trade and of the Delegation to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. He is also chairman of the European Parliamentary Association (EPA).

On 12 November 2013, Daul was elected president of the European People&#x27;s Party, succeeding the late Wilfried Martens, while also remaining chairman of the EPP Group in the European Parliament. However, he decided not to run again in the European elections in 2014 and to leave his position as Chairman of the EPP Group in the European Parliament to dedicate all his time to his new function. He was re-elected as President of the EPP at the Madrid Congress in October 2015. In 2019, he was succeeded by Donald Tusk.

Among other honours, Daul is an &quot;Officier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot;, &quot;Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre National du Mérite&quot; and &quot;Officier du Mérite Agricole&quot;.

== Controversy ==
Daul was under investigation for misuse of public funds in France. He was part of an inquiry into the diversion of €16 million (£10.6 million) of agricultural money in the 1990s that has also ensnared three former agriculture ministers. He was placed under investigation in 2004 for allegedly diverting money to finance the farmers&#x27; union, the FNSEA, and to pay his own staff. He was not accused of benefiting personally but of &quot;complicity and concealment of the abuse of public funds&quot;. On 8 August 2007, the court had, however, asked that all charges against him be dropped, stating that the cases made against him did not require legal punishment.
