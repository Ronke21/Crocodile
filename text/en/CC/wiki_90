<text>Blind Idiot God is an American instrumental rock trio formed in 1982 in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, by guitarist Andy Hawkins, bassist Gabriel Katz and drummer Ted Epstein. The phrase &quot;blind idiot god&quot; comes from horror writer H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s description of the god Azathoth. Their often improvisational musical style combines influences from punk rock, noise music, 20th-century classical music, heavy metal, dub, free jazz, and funk. They are currently based in New York City and have often collaborated with musicians Bill Laswell and John Zorn.

Their self-titled debut album, &quot;Blind Idiot God&quot;, was issued by SST Records in 1987 and was well received critically. Brian Olewnick described it as &quot;an extraordinary debut [...] the three musicians exhibited startling originality and impressive technique both on their instruments and in the depth and style of their compositions&quot;. With bassist Bill Laswell handling production duties, &quot;Undertow&quot; was released in 1988 and was followed by &quot;Cyclotron&quot; in 1992. Ted Epstein left the band in 1996 and the remaining members put Blind Idiot God on hiatus as they searched for his replacement.

In 2001, Blind Idiot God reunited after roughly a decade of inactivity, with Tim Wyskida (of Khanate) replacing Epstein. Between 2008 and 2010, Blind Idiot God recorded the material at studios in New Jersey; Barber Shop; and Orange Sound that would comprise their fourth album, &quot;Before Ever After&quot;. Gabriel Katz departed in 2012 and was replaced by New York veteran bassist Will Dahl, making Andy Hawkins the only original member still performing in the band. &quot;Before Ever After&quot; was released on February 24, 2015, with the new lineup performing three live shows in New York to coincide with the release. In 2017, The band announced that they would be re-issuing their back catalog on multiple formats and that they had started work on a new album.

== History ==

===Early years (1982–1986)===
Blind Idiot God was formed in 1982 in St. Louis, Missouri when its members were teenagers. Before adopting free jazz and dub influences, they essentially played hardcore punk, with their songs being roughly one minute in length. During this time, they socialized within the St. Louis hardcore scene, including members of Drunks with Guns and Ultraman. After failing to find a vocalist that shared their musical aspirations, the band opted to continue as an instrumental outfit. Their first live performance came in September 1983 at a basement party. After playing the first song of their set, a reggae version of &quot;Hava Nagila&quot;, they were interrupted by the police who shut the party down after receiving complaints from the neighbors. After hearing their self-produced cassette demo, Greg Ginn of Black Flag signed them to SST Records, and the band moved to Brooklyn in 1986.

===Debut album and critical acclaim (1987–1988)===
The band began searching for a producer who would be willing to work with their mixture of noise, dub and heavy metal. Originally, Hawkins wanted to enlist the aid of British producer Adrian Sherwood, known for his work with numerous reggae groups as well as his contributions to the industrial hip hop ensemble Tackhead. In January 1987, Blind Idiot God entered B.C. Studios to record with producer Martin Bisi, who they had met through composer Bill Laswell. Their debut album, the eponymously titled &quot;Blind Idiot God&quot;, was released on SST Records in 1987 and received critical acclaim. While categorized as heavy metal and noise rock, the music made use of distortion techniques while hinting at free jazz and European classical music influences, with its final three tracks ostensibly belonging to the dub genre. The virtuosity of the band&#x27;s players was praised in an article for &quot;Electronic Musician&quot;, which said &quot;Andy Hawkins&#x27; guitar dips and swirls, chases its tail, and ultimately screams its existence, while Ted Epstein and Gabriel Katz lend form and substance on bass and drums respectively. At 19, 20, and 21, the trio is young enough to dazzle with potential. Jazz, heavy metal, reggae, art music - B.I.G. has elements of all of these, yet establishes their very own recipe.&quot;

===Underground success and second album (1988–1992)===
The success of Blind Idiot God&#x27;s first album coupled with powerful live performances earned them recognition in underground music circles. The band soon began collaborating with avant-garde composer and saxophonist John Zorn. Zorn contacted the band after attending one of their performances at CBGB&#x27;s and professed his enthusiasm for their work along with his desire to collaborate with the group. The band joined him onstage on numerous occasions to perform improvised music, Zorn compositions and even in his John Coltrane cover band &quot;Ascension&quot; which featured infamous 2 minute versions of Coltrane compositions like A Love Supreme and Ascension.

The Blind Idiot God&#x27;s second album &quot;Undertow&quot; was issued the following year by Enemy Records and produced by Bill Laswell. The style remained similar to what had been represented on the band&#x27;s debut, with excursions into dub territory interposing bludgeoning noise rock. Noted musical departures included the heavy metal/funk hybrid &quot;Alice in My Fantasies&quot;, a George Clinton cover, and &quot;Purged Specimen&quot;, a short piece composed for them by John Zorn that also featured him on alto saxophone. Praising the Blind Idiot God&#x27;s knack for memorable melodies and rapid tempo-changes combined with Laswell&#x27;s production, EAR Magazine declared &quot;Undertow&quot; superior to their debut and &quot;as addictive as a pot of strong coffee.&quot;

===Third album and hiatus (1992–1996)===
Released four years later, the band&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Cyclotron&quot; was seen by some as lackluster due to the reliance on ideas previously explored and absence of distinct experimentation. In 1993, Blind Idiot God and Henry Rollins wrote and recorded the title song for the movie &quot;Freaked&quot;, marking the first and only time the band collaborated with a vocalist. The entire band performed on Praxis&#x27; album &quot;Sacrifist&quot;, released in 1993.

After Cyclotron was released, the members began pursuing their own separate musical endeavors. Andy Hawkins began a solo guitar project named Azonic, under which he released &quot;Halo&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Skinner&#x27;s Black Laboratories&quot; with Justin Broadrick of Godflesh in 1995. Gabriel Katz collaborated with Bill Laswell on &quot;Dub Terror Exhaust&quot;, for which he composed music and contributed bass parts. In 1996, Ted Epstein left the band to pursue other interests. Unwilling to continue without a drummer, the remaining members placed Blind Idiot God on hiatus.

===Return and new album (2001–present)===
Drummer Tim Wyskida, known for his work in Khanate, joined in 2001 and Blind Idiot God began work on their fourth studio album. However, setbacks and delays occurred as Gabriel Katz encountered problems with tendinitis and hearing loss. The line-up finally began performing in a live setting in 2006, playing a series of well-received gigs in New York City. In 2012, Gabriel Katz left the band and was replaced by Will Dahl.

In 2013, three newly recorded tracks appeared in the HBO documentary &quot;Downloaded&quot;, a film by Alex Winter detailing the history of Napster. It marked the first time new material by Blind Idiot God had been made available to the public in over twenty years. The band&#x27;s fourth full-length album, an accumulation of thirteen years worth of recorded material, was announced in 2014. Titled &quot;Before Ever After&quot;, it was the debut release of Indivisible Music, a label founded by Andy Hawkins. &quot;Before Ever After&quot; was issued on vinyl on February 24, 2015, followed by a Compact Disc release on April 6, 2015.

On April 13, 2016 the Blind Idiot God embarked on their &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot; tour, which marked the band&#x27;s first live shows outside of the United States. Concurrent with their tour, &quot;Before Ever After&quot; was reissued for worldwide distribution. In 2017, the band announced the re-issue of their second album &quot;Undertow&quot;. Set to be released on October 13, the newly remastered release is to include two versions of &quot;Freaked&quot;, a collaboration with former Black Flag vocalist Henry Rollins and Blind Idiot God&#x27;s sole composition to feature vocals. They also announced plans to re-issue &quot;Cyclotron&quot;.

== Musical style ==
Though at its core heavy metal, Blind Idiot God&#x27;s music is informed by punk rock, dub, and classical music composers, notably György Ligeti, Krzysztof Penderecki and Igor Stravinsky. In a 1997 &quot;Guitar Player&quot; interview, Hawkins explained one reason he drew inspiration from classical music was to use more advanced harmony: &quot;When I listen to a lot of metal and hard rock, I think &#x27;Great Intensity! Boring chords!&#x27;&quot; The band&#x27;s music also heavily drew from free jazz, with its members citing Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane as being early musical influences. Former drummer Ted Epstein has also commented on the role funk music plays in his music, saying &quot;something that has been with me since I was 15 or 16 is the idea of funk as a concept, the syncopation and the push/pull thing that exists in funk, embodied in Funkadelic, Grandmaster Flash, Sly and the Family Stone, and The Meters.&quot; Comparisons have also been made to Blue Cheer, Last Exit, the Sex Pistols, Glenn Branca and Jimi Hendrix. In reviewing the band&#x27;s debut, a critic of &quot;Electronic Musician&quot; noted that &quot;if you took original Hendrix multi-track tapes, wiped the vocals off, and handed them to Scientist, the reggae dub-mixer, the result might sound like B.l.G.&quot;

Since its inception, Blind Idiot God&#x27;s music has been entirely instrumental, with its members stating their unanimous disinterest with incorporating vocals into their arrangements. Andy Hawkins has explained &quot;when you hear a voice, it usually has such a distinct emotional quality to it. It speaks in a whole different kind of way then the music does, so it just interferes with what we are trying to do musically.&quot; However, during the early nineties the band expressed a desire to form a separate project that integrated vocals into their music.

===Legacy===
Filmmaker and actor Alex Winter is a long-time admirer of Blind Idiot God, having used their music in his debut feature film &quot;Freaked&quot; and again in his 2013 documentary &quot;Downloaded&quot;. In 2014 he described them as &quot;one of the most revered and influential bands to come out of the SST era [...] they are as great and bold today, as ever.&quot; Former Black Flag vocalist Henry Rollins professed himself as being a fan of their work and felt honored in having collaborated with them.

<text>An aircraft safety card is a document instructing passengers on an aircraft about the procedures for dealing with various emergency conditions that might arise during the flight.

==General information==

The safety cards are usually provided by airlines on all commercial flights, usually located in the back of the seat in front of each passenger, or alternatively a placard on the back of seats. Pre-flight safety demonstrations, either conducted by the flight attendants or through a video presentation, instruct passengers to familiarize themselves with the safety cards prior to take-off. 

The cards are frequently laminated or made of plastic and contain instructions that are specific to the model of the airplane in which they are found. The contents are usually in the form of pictures, graphically illustrating such procedures as buckling the seat belts, bracing for impact in an airplane crash, dealing with depressurization, opening the emergency exit door or inflating life rafts in the event of a water landing. The graphic representation allows the cards to be accessible to those speaking a different language from the flight attendants, as well as to children and illiterate passengers. Braille cards are also offered on many mainstream airlines.

==Collectibles==
Aircraft safety cards are a collectible item among the aviation enthusiast community since they are a reflection of an airline, an aircraft type, a culture, and a historical period. Safety cards are collected from civil and military aircraft, rare cards have been known to fetch over US$1,000 at auction.

<text>Under Tsar Nicholas II (reigned 1894–1917), the Russian Empire slowly industrialized while repressing opposition from the center and the far-left. During the 1890s Russia&#x27;s industrial development led to a large increase in the size of the urban middle class and of the working class, which gave rise to a more dynamic political atmosphere. Because the state and foreigners owned much of Russia&#x27;s industry, the Russian working class was comparatively stronger and the Russian bourgeoisie comparatively weaker than in the West.

During the 1890s and early 1900s, bad living- and working-conditions, high taxes, and land hunger gave rise to more frequent strikes and agrarian disorders. By 1914, 40% of Russian workers were employed in factories of 1,000 workers or more (32% in 1901). 42% worked in businesses of 100 to 1,000 workers and 18% in businesses of 100 workers or fewer (in 1914, the United States had equivalent figures of 18%, 47% and 35%, respectively).

Politically, anti-establishment forces organized into competing parties, although political parties were not legalized until the October Manifesto was issued in 1905. The liberal elements among the industrial capitalists and nobility, who believed in peaceful social reform and a constitutional monarch, founded the Constitutional Democratic party or &quot;Kadets&quot; in 1905. The socialist parties included the Socialist Revolutionaries (SRs, founded in 1900) and the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party (RSDRP, founded in 1898). The workers in major cities revolted in 1905 with widespread strikes and mutinies. The Tsar barely kept control, and was forced to initiate reforms, promising an elective parliament (the &quot;Duma&quot;) in the October Manifesto. However, the Tsar then dissolved the &quot;Duma&quot; in 1906. He turned to Peter Stolypin (Prime Minister from 1906 to 1911) to help reform the huge, but sluggish, economy.

Nicholas II&#x27;s foreign policy centred on an alliance with France and involved increased meddling in Balkan affairs. Russia proclaimed a role for itself as military protector of Orthodox Christians, notably those in Serbia. Efforts to expand Russian power in the Far East led to a short war with Japan in 1904–1905, which ended in humiliating defeat for St Petersburg. The Russians entered into World War I in 1914, but military losses and the pressures of a failing war-time economy led liberal elements to conduct the February Revolution in 1917 as radicals like Vladimir Lenin were funded by Germany to launch a coup, largely working through soviets in the factories and in the army. Deciding that it could not continue the war and hold onto its revolutionary gains, the new Soviet government made a separate peace with Germany, signing away 150,000km2 of Russian land in the Treaty of Breast-Litovsk.

==Alliance with France, 1894–1914==

The central development in Russian foreign policy was to move away from Germany and toward France. Russia had never been friendly with France, and remembered the wars in the Crimean and the Napoleonic invasion; it saw Paris as a dangerous front of subversion and ridiculed the weak governments there. France, which had been shut out of the entire alliance system by Bismarck, decided to improve relations with Russia. It lent money to the Russians, expanded trade, and began selling warships after 1890. Meanwhile, after Bismarck lost office in 1890, there was no renewal of the Reinsurance treaty between Russia and Germany. The German bankers stopped lending to Russia, which increasingly depended on Paris banks. In 1894 a secret treaty stipulated that Russia would come to the aid of France if France was attacked by Germany. Another stipulation was that in a possible war against Germany, France would immediately mobilize 1.3 million men, while Russia would mobilize 700,000 to 800,000. It provided that if any one or more of the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria, Italy) mobilized their reserves in preparation for war, then both Russia and France would mobilize theirs. &quot;The mobilization is the declaration of war,&quot; the French chief of staff told Tsar Alexander III in 1892. &quot;To mobilize is to oblige one&#x27;s neighbor to do the same.&quot; This set up the tripwire for July 1914. George F. Kennan argues that Russia was primarily responsible for the collapse of Bismarck&#x27;s alliance policy in Europe, and starting the downward slope to the First World War. Kennan blames poor Russian diplomacy centered on its ambitions in the Balkans. Kennan says Bismarck&#x27;s foreign policy was designed to prevent any major war even in the face of improved Franco-Russian relations. Russia left Bismarck&#x27;s Three Emperors&#x27; League (with Germany and Austria) and instead took up the French proposal for closer relationships and a military alliance.

==Imperialism in Asia and the Russo-Japanese War==


Russia gained room to maneuver in Asia because of its friendship with France and the growing rivalry between Britain and Germany. By 1895 Germany was competing with France for Russia&#x27;s favour, and British statesmen hoped to negotiate with the Russians to demarcate spheres of influence in Asia. This situation enabled Russia to intervene in northeastern Asia after Japan&#x27;s victory over China in 1895. In the negotiations that followed, Japan was forced to make concessions in the Liaotung Peninsula and Port Arthur in southern Manchuria. The next year, Sergei Witte used French capital to establish the Russo-Chinese Bank. The goal of the bank was to finance the construction of a railroad across northern Manchuria and thus shorten the Trans-Siberian Railway. Within two years, Russia had acquired leases on the Liaotung Peninsula and Port Arthur and had begun building a trunk line from Harbin in central Manchuria to Port Arthur on the coast. At the same time Great Britain occupied Wei-Hai-Wei, and Germany Kiaochao.

In 1900, China reacted to foreign encroachments on its territory with an armed popular uprising, the Boxer Rebellion. Russian military contingents joined forces from Europe, Japan, and the United States to restore order in northern China. A force of 150,000 Russian troops occupied Manchuria to secure its railroads. After the suppression of the rebellion, Russia did not withdraw its troops from Manchuria. Consequently, friction grew between Russia and Japan, and the latter opened hostilities at Port Arthur in January 1904, without any formal declaration of war.

In counterpoint to the Japanese strategy of gaining rapid victories to control Manchuria, Russian strategy focused on fighting delaying actions to gain time for reinforcements to arrive via the long Trans-Siberian railway. In January 1905, after several unsuccessful attacks which cost them 60,000 troops killed and wounded and an eight-month siege, the Japanese captured Port Arthur. In March, the Japanese forced the Russians to withdraw north of Mukden, but were unable to pursue the Russians because Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties. Because strategically the possession of the city meant little, the final victory was dependent on the navy. In May, at the Tsushima Straits, the Japanese destroyed Russia&#x27;s last hope in the war, a fleet assembled from the navy&#x27;s Baltic and Mediterranean squadrons. Theoretically, Russian army reinforcements could have driven the Japanese from the Asian mainland, but revolution at home and diplomatic pressure forced the tsar to seek peace. Russia accepted mediation by United States president Theodore Roosevelt, ceded southern Sakhalin Island to Japan, and acknowledged Japan&#x27;s ascendancy in Korea and southern Manchuria.

==Influence of agriculture==
Russia&#x27;s systems for agricultural production influenced the attitudes of peasants and other social groups to reform against the government and promote social changes. “At the beginning of the twentieth century, agriculture constituted the single largest sector of the Russian economy, producing approximately one-half of the national income and employing two-thirds of Russia’s population”. This illustrates the tremendous role peasants played economically; thus making them detrimental to the revolutionary ideology of the populist and social democrats. At the end of the 19th century, Russian agriculture as a whole was the worst in Europe. The Russian system of agriculture lacked capital investment and technological advancement. Livestock productivity was notoriously backwards and the lack of grazing land such as meadows forced livestock to graze in fallow uncultivated land. Both the crop and livestock system failed to be adequate to withstand the Russian winters. During the Tsarist rule, the agricultural economy diverged from subsistence production to production directly for the market. Along with the agricultural failures, Russia had a rapid population growth, railroads expanded across farmland, and inflation attacked the price of commodities. Restrictions were placed on the distribution of food and ultimately lead to famines. Agricultural difficulties in Russia limited the economy, influencing social reforms and assisting the rise of the Bolshevik party.

==Revolution and counterrevolution, 1905–1907==

The Russo-Japanese War accelerated the rise of political movements among all classes and the major nationalities, including propertied Russians. By early 1904, Russian liberal activists from the zemstva and from the professions had formed an organization called the Union of Liberation. In the same year, they joined with Finns, Poles, Georgians, Armenians, and Russian members of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party to form an alliance against autocratic rule.

The revolution of 1905, an unprecedented empire-wide social and political upheaval, was set in motion by the violent suppression on January 22 (Bloody Sunday) in St. Petersburg of a mass procession of workers, led by the radical priest Georgiy Gapon, with a petition for the tsar. Bloody Sunday was followed, nationwide, by workers’ and students’ strikes, street demonstrations, spates of vandalism and other periodic violence, assassinations of government officials, naval mutinies, nationalist movements in the imperial borderlands, and anti-Jewish pogroms and other reactionary protest and violence. In a number of cities, workers formed Soviets, or councils. At the end of the year, armed uprisings occurred in Moscow, the Urals, Latvia, and parts of Poland. Activists from the zemstva and the broad professional Union of Unions formed the Constitutional Democratic Party, whose initials lent the party its informal name, the Kadets. Some upper-class and propertied activists called for compromise with opposition groups to avoid further disorders.

The outcome of the revolution was contradictory. In late 1905, Nicholas agreed, somewhat reluctantly, to issue the so-called October Manifesto, which promised Russia a reformed political order and basic civil liberties for most citizens. New fundamental laws in 1906 established the legislative State Duma, or parliament, but also restricted its authority in many ways — not least of which was the complete lack of parliamentary control over the appointment or dismissal of cabinet ministers. Trade unions and strikes were legalised, but police retained extensive authority to monitor union activities and to close unions for engaging in illegal political activities. Press freedom was guaranteed.

Those who accepted the new arrangements formed a center-right political party, the Octobrists. Meanwhile, the Kadets held out for a truly responsible ministerial government and equal, universal suffrage. Because of their political principles and continued armed uprisings, Russia&#x27;s leftist parties were undecided whether to participate in the Duma elections, which had been called for early 1906. At the same time, rightist factions actively opposed the reforms. Several new monarchist and protofascist groups also arose to subvert the new order. Nevertheless, the regime continued to function through the chaotic year of 1905, eventually restoring order in the cities, the countryside, and the army. In the process, terrorists murdered hundreds of officials, and the government executed much greater number of terrorists. Because the government had been able to restore order and to secure a loan from France before the first Duma met, Nicholas was in a strong position that enabled him to replace Witte with the much more conservative Pyotr Stolypin.

The First Duma was elected in March 1906. The Kadets and their allies dominated it, with the mainly nonparty radical leftists slightly weaker than the Octobrists and the nonparty center-rightists combined. The socialists had boycotted the election, but several socialist delegates were elected. Relations between the Duma and the Stolypin government were hostile from the beginning. A deadlock of the Kadets and the government over the adoption of a constitution and peasant reform led to the dissolution of the Duma and the scheduling of new elections. In spite of an upsurge of leftist terror, radical leftist parties participated in the election, and, together with the nonparty left, they gained a plurality of seats, followed by a loose coalition of Kadets with Poles and other nationalities in the political center. The impasse continued, however, when the Second Duma met in 1907.

==Stolypin and Kokovtsov governments==

In June 1907, The Tsar dissolved the Second Duma and promulgated a new electoral law, which vastly reduced the electoral weight of lower-class and non-Russian voters and increased the weight of the nobility. This political coup (Coup of June 1907) had the desired short-term result of restoring order. New elections in the autumn returned a more conservative Third Duma, which Octobrists dominated. Even this Duma quarreled with the government over a variety of issues, however, including the composition of the naval staff, the autonomous status of Finland, the introduction of zemstva in the western provinces, the reform of the peasant court system, and the establishment of workers&#x27; insurance organizations under police supervision. In these disputes, the Duma, with its appointed aristocratic-bureaucratic upper house, was sometimes more conservative than the government, and at other times it was more constitutionally minded. The Fourth Duma, elected in 1912, was similar in composition to the third, but a progressive faction of Octobrists split from the right and joined the political center.

Stolypin&#x27;s boldest measure was his peasant reform program. It allowed, and sometimes forced, the breakup of communes as well as the establishment of full private property. Stolypin hoped that the reform program would create a class of conservative landowning farmers loyal to the Tsar. Most peasants did not want to lose the safety of the commune or to permit outsiders to buy village land, however. By 1914 only about 10 percent of all peasant communes had been dissolved. Nevertheless, the economy recovered and grew impressively from 1907 to 1914, both quantitatively and through the formation of rural cooperatives and banks and the generation of domestic capital. By 1914 Russian steel production equaled that of France and Austria-Hungary, and Russia&#x27;s economic growth rate was one of the highest in the world. Although external debt was very high, it was declining as a percentage of the gross national product, and the empire&#x27;s overall trade balance was favorable.

In 1911 Stolypin was assassinated by Dmitry Bogrov whilst watching an opera. Finance Minister Vladimir Kokovtsov replaced him. The cautious Kokovtsov was very able and a supporter of the tsar, but he could not compete with the powerful court factions that dominated the government.

Historians have debated whether Russia had the potential to develop a constitutional government between 1905 and 1914. The failure to do so was partly because the tsar was not willing to give up autocratic rule or share power. By manipulating the franchise, the government obtained progressively more conservative, but less representative, Dumas. Moreover, the regime sometimes bypassed the conservative Dumas and ruled by decree.

==Active Balkan policy, 1906–1913==
Russia&#x27;s earlier Far Eastern policy required holding Balkan issues in abeyance, a strategy Austria-Hungary also followed between 1897 and 1906. Japan&#x27;s victory in 1905 had forced Russia to make deals with the British and the Japanese. In 1907 Russia&#x27;s new foreign minister, Aleksandr Izvol&#x27;skiy, concluded agreements with both nations. To maintain its sphere of influence in northern Manchuria and northern Persia, Russia agreed to Japanese ascendancy in southern Manchuria and Korea, and to British ascendancy in southern Persia, Afghanistan, and Tibet. The logic of this policy demanded that Russia and Japan unite to prevent the United States from establishing a base in China by organizing a consortium to develop Chinese railroads. After China&#x27;s republican revolution of 1911, Russia and Japan recognized each other&#x27;s spheres of influence in Inner Mongolia. In an extension of this reasoning, Russia traded recognition of German economic interests in the Ottoman Empire and Persia for German recognition of various Russian security interests in the region. Russia also protected its strategic and financial position by entering the informal Triple Entente with Britain and France, without antagonizing Germany.

In spite of these careful measures, after the Russo-Japanese War Russia and Austria-Hungary resumed their Balkan rivalry, focusing on the Kingdom of Serbia and the provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which Austria-Hungary had occupied since 1878. In 1881 Russia secretly had agreed in principle to Austria&#x27;s future annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. But in 1908, Izvol&#x27;skiy consented to support formal annexation in return for Austria&#x27;s support for revision of the agreement on the neutrality of the Bosporus and Dardanelles—a change that would give Russia special navigational rights of passage. Britain stymied the Russian gambit by blocking the revision, but Austria proceeded with the annexation. Then, backed by German threats of war, Austria-Hungary exposed Russia&#x27;s weakness by forcing Russia to disavow support for Serbia.

After Austria-Hungary&#x27;s annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia became a major part of the increased tension and conflict in the Balkans. In 1912 Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, and Montenegro defeated the Ottoman Empire in the First Balkan War, but the putative allies continued to quarrel among themselves. Then in 1913, the alliance split, and the Serbs, Greeks, and Romanians defeated Bulgaria in the Second Balkan War. Austria-Hungary became the patron of Bulgaria, which now was Serbia&#x27;s territorial rival in the region, and Germany remained the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s protector. Russia tied itself more closely to Serbia than it had previously. The complex system of alliances and Great Power support was extremely unstable; among the Balkan parties harboring resentments over past defeats, the Serbs maintained particular animosity toward the Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In June 1914, a Serbian terrorist assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, which then held the Serbian government responsible. Austria-Hungary delivered an ultimatum to Serbia. Serbia submitted to the first 2 of 3 cases of the ultimatum; the last one, which was rejected, demanded Serbia allow 100,000 Austrio-Hungarian troops to occupy their country. After Serbian rejection of the third clause of the ultimatum, Austria-Hungary responded forcefully. Russia supported Serbia. Once the Serbian response was rejected, the system of alliances began to operate automatically, with Germany supporting Austria-Hungary and France backing Russia. When Germany invaded France through Belgium as dictated by the Schliffen Plan, the conflict escalated into a world war and they were not prepared.

==Russia at war, 1914–1916==
At the outbreak of the war, Tsar Nicholas yielded to pressure and appointed Grand Duke Nicholas as commander in chief of the Russian armies. The Grand Duke, a cousin of the tsar, was competent but had no part in formulating the strategy or appointing commanders.

In the initial phase of the war, Russia&#x27;s offensives into East Prussia drew enough German troops from the western front to allow the French, Belgians, and British to stop the German advance. One of Russia&#x27;s two invading armies was almost totally destroyed, however, at the disastrous Battle of Tannenberg—the same site at which Lithuanian, Polish, and Moldovan troops had defeated the German Teutonic Knights in 1410. Meanwhile, the Russians turned back an Austrian offensive and pushed into eastern Galicia, the northeastern region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Russians halted a combined German-Austrian winter counteroffensive into Russian Poland, and in early 1915 they pushed more deeply into Galicia. Then in the spring and summer of that year, a German-Austrian offensive drove the Russians out of Galicia and Poland and destroyed several Russian army corps. In 1916 the Germans planned to drive France out of the war with a large-scale attack in the Verdun area, but a new Russian offensive against Austria-Hungary once again drew German troops from the west. These actions left both major fronts stable and both Russia and Germany despairing of victory—Russia because of exhaustion, Germany because of its opponents&#x27; superior resources. Toward the end of 1916, Russia came to the rescue of Romania, which had just entered the war, and extended the eastern front south to the Black Sea.

Wartime agreements among the Allies reflected the Triple Entente&#x27;s imperialist aims and the Russian Empire&#x27;s relative weakness outside Eastern Europe. Russia nonetheless expected impressive gains from a victory: territorial acquisitions in eastern Galicia from Austria, in East Prussia from Germany, and northeastern Anatolia from the Ottoman Empire, which joined the war on the German side; control of Constantinople and the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits; and territorial and political alteration of Austria-Hungary in the interests of Romania and the Slavic peoples of the region. Britain was to acquire the middle zone of Persia and share much of the Arab Middle East with France; Italy—not Russia&#x27;s ally Serbia—was to acquire Dalmatia along the Adriatic coast; Japan, another ally of the Entente, was to control more territory in China; and France was to regain Alsace-Lorraine, which it had lost to Germany in the Franco-Prussian War, and to have increased influence in western Germany.

==Fatal weakening of tsarism==

The onset of World War I exposed the weakness of Nicholas II&#x27;s government. A show of national unity had accompanied Russia&#x27;s entrance into the war, with defense of the Slavic Serbs the main battle cry. In the summer of 1914, the Duma and the zemstva expressed full support for the government&#x27;s war effort. The initial conscription was well organized and peaceful, and the early phase of Russia&#x27;s military buildup showed that the empire had learned lessons from the Russo-Japanese War. But military reversals and the government&#x27;s incompetence soon soured much of the population. German control of the Baltic Sea and German-Ottoman control of the Black Sea severed Russia from most of its foreign supplies and potential markets. In addition, inept Russian preparations for war and ineffective economic policies hurt the country financially, logistically, and militarily. Inflation became a serious problem. Because of inadequate material support for military operations, the War Industry Committees were formed to ensure that necessary supplies reached the front. But army officers quarreled with civilian leaders, seized administrative control of front areas, and refused to cooperate with the committee. The central government distrusted the independent war support activities that were organized by zemstva and cities. The Duma quarreled with the war bureaucracy of the government, and center and center-left deputies eventually formed the Progressive Bloc to create a genuinely constitutional government.

After Russian military reversals in 1915, Nicholas II went to the front to assume nominal leadership of the army, leaving behind his German-born wife, Alexandra, government and Duma.

While the central government was hampered by court intrigue, the strain of the war began to cause popular unrest. Since 1915 high food prices and fuel shortages caused strikes in some cities. Workers, who had won the right to representation in sections of the War Industries Committee, used those sections as organs of political opposition. The countryside also was becoming restive. Soldiers were increasingly insubordinate, particularly the newly recruited peasants who faced the prospect of being used as cannon fodder in the inept conduct of the war.

The situation continued to deteriorate. Increasing conflict between the tsar and the Duma weakened both parts of the government and increased the impression of incompetence. In early 1917, deteriorating rail transport caused acute food and fuel shortages, which resulted in riots and strikes. Authorities summoned troops to quell the disorders in Petrograd (as St. Petersburg had been called since September 1914, to Russianize the Germanic name). In 1905 troops had fired on demonstrators and saved the monarchy, but in 1917 the troops turned their guns over to the angry crowds. Public support for the tsarist regime simply evaporated in 1917, ending three centuries of Romanov rule.

<text>In criminal law, a sentence is the punishment for a crime ordered by a trial court after conviction in a criminal procedure, normally at the conclusion of a trial. A sentence may consist of imprisonment, a fine, or other sanctions. Sentences for multiple crimes may be a concurrent sentence, where sentences of imprisonment are all served together at the same time, or a consecutive sentence, in which the period of imprisonment is the sum of all sentences served one after the other. Additional sentences include intermediate, which allows an inmate to be free for about 8 hours a day for work purposes; determinate, which is fixed on a number of days, months, or years; and indeterminate or bifurcated, which mandates the minimum period be served in an institutional setting such as a prison followed by street time period of parole, supervised release or probation until the total sentence is completed.

If a sentence is reduced to a less harsh punishment, then the sentence is said to have been mitigated or commuted. Rarely, depending on circumstances, murder charges are mitigated and reduced to manslaughter charges. However, in certain legal systems, a defendant may be punished beyond the terms of the sentence, through phenomena including social stigma, loss of governmental benefits, or collectively, the collateral consequences of criminal charges.

Statutes generally specify the highest penalties that may be imposed for certain offenses, and sentencing guidelines often mandate the minimum and maximum imprisonment terms to imposed upon an offender, which is then left to the discretion of the trial court. However, in some jurisdictions, prosecutors have great influence over the punishments actually handed down, by virtue of their discretion to decide what offenses to charge the offender with and what facts they will seek to prove or to ask the defendant to stipulate to in a plea agreement. It has been argued that legislators have an incentive to enact tougher sentences than even they would like to see applied to the typical defendant since they recognize that the blame for an inadequate sentencing range to handle a particularly egregious crime would fall upon legislators, but the blame for excessive punishments would fall upon prosecutors.

Sentencing law sometimes includes cliffs that result in much stiffer penalties when certain facts apply. For instance, an armed career criminal or habitual offender law may subject a defendant to a significant increase in their sentence if they commit a third offence of a certain kind. This makes it difficult for fine gradations in punishments to be achieved.

==History==
The earliest use of the term with this meaning was in Roman law, where it indicated the opinion of a jurist on a given question, expressed in written or in oral &quot;responsa&quot;. It might also refer to the opinion of senators that was translated into the &quot;&quot;. Finally, it might also refer to the decision of the bench in both civil and penal trials, as well as the decision of the &quot;arbiters&quot; in arbitration.

In modern Latin systems, the sentence is mainly the final act of any procedure in which a judge or body of judges is called upon to express their evaluation. It can therefore be issued in practically any field of law requiring a function of evaluation of something by a judge or judging body.

==Classification==
Sentences are variously classified depending on
*the legal field, or kind of action, or system it refers to:
**civil, penal, administrative, canon, sentence.
**sentences of mere clearance, of condemnation, of constitution.
*the issuing body, typically a monocratic judge or a court, or other figures that receive a legitimation by the system.
*the jurisdiction and the legal competence single judges, courts, tribunals, appeals, supreme courts, constitutional courts, meant as the various degrees of judgement and appeal.
*the content:
**partial, cautelar, interlocutory, preliminar &quot;, definitive sentences.
**sentence of &#x27; discharge or &#x27; briefly &quot;, also for other meanings condemnation. The sentences of condemnation are also classified by the penalty they determine:
***sentence of reclusion,
***sentence of fee,
***&quot;&quot;, sentence that impose a determined action or a series of action as a penalty for the illegal act. This kind of sentence became better developed and remained in wider use in common law systems.

==Philosophies==
The sentence meted out depends on the philosophical principle used by the court and what the legal system regards as the purpose of punishment. The most common purposes of sentencing are:
*Retribution
*Deterrence of the individual or of others
*Denunciation
*Incapacitation
*Rehabilitation
*Reparation

In England and Wales, section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 has specified that in cases involving those over 18, courts should have regard to punishment of the offenders retribution, deterrence, reform and rehabilitation, protection of the public, and reparation to persons affected by their offences.

==Process==
Usually, the sentence comes at the end of a process in which the presiding judge or judges have been enabled to evaluate whether the conduct in question complies or does not comply with the law, and which aspects might be breaches of which specific legislation. Depending on jurisdiction, the stages leading up to the sentence may vary, and the sentence may be challenged by both parties up to a given degree of appeal. If appealed against, the sentence issued by the highest appellate court to which the case is admitted becomes the definitive sentence. The sentence usually has to be publicly announced; and, in most jurisdictions, has to be justified through an explanation of the juridical reflections and evaluations that lie behind it.

Even a definitive sentence can be annulled in exceptional circumstances, usually predetermined within the jurisdiction in question. Most such cases arise from irregularities found in the judicial process after sentence has been passed. The most extreme examples arise in criminal cases, when conclusive proof of innocence comes to light after sentence has been passed, leading to the sentence&#x27;s annulment.

In most jurisdictions, under double jeopardy legislation, the definitive sentence is unique, in the sense that (except for appeal hearings) no individual can be judged or sentenced more than once for the same actions.

In many jurisdictions, sentences are a source of law, in that they represent an authoritative interpretation of the law in concrete cases.

The sentence is typically determined by a judge and/or jury, and is issued in the name or on behalf of the superior authority of the state.

<text>In linguistics and grammar, a sentence is a linguistic expression, such as the English example &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.&quot; In traditional grammar, it is typically defined as a string of words that expresses a complete thought, or as a unit consisting of a subject and predicate. In non-functional linguistics it is typically defined as a maximal unit of syntactic structure such as a constituent. In functional linguistics, it is defined as a unit of written texts delimited by graphological features such as upper-case letters and markers such as periods, question marks, and exclamation marks. This notion contrasts with a curve, which is delimited by phonologic features such as pitch and loudness and markers such as pauses; and with a clause, which is a sequence of words that represents some process going on throughout time.
A sentence can include words grouped meaningfully to express a statement, question, exclamation, request, command, or suggestion.

== Typical associates ==

=== Clauses ===
A sentence is typically associated with a clause. A clause can either be a &quot;clause simplex&quot; or a &quot;clause complex&quot;. A clause simplex represents a single process going on through time. A clause complex represents a logical relation between two or more processes and is thus composed of two or more clause simplexes.

A clause (simplex) typically contains a predication structure with a subject noun phrase and a finite verb. Although the subject is usually a noun phrase, other kinds of phrases (such as gerund phrases) work as well, and some languages allow subjects to be omitted. In the examples below, the subject of the outmost clause simplex is in italics and the subject of &quot;boiling&quot; is in square brackets. There is clause embedding in the second and third examples.
: &quot;[Water]&quot; boils at 100 degrees Celsius.
: &quot;It&quot; is quite interesting &quot;that [water] boils at 100 degrees Celsius&quot;.
: &quot;The fact that [water] boils at 100 degrees Celsius&quot; is quite interesting.

There are two types of clauses: &quot;independent&quot; and &quot;non-independent&quot;/&quot;interdependent&quot;. An independent clause realises a speech act such as a statement, a question, a command or an offer. A non-independent clause does not realise any act. A non-independent clause (simplex or complex) is usually logically related to other non-independent clauses. Together, they usually constitute a single independent clause (complex). For that reason, non-independent clauses are also called &quot;interdependent&quot;. For instance, the non-independent clause &quot;because I have no friends&quot; is related to the non-independent clause &quot;I don&#x27;t go out&quot; in &quot;I don&#x27;t go out, because I have no friends&quot;. The whole clause complex is independent because it realises a statement. What is stated is the causal nexus between having no friend and not going out. When such a statement is acted out, the fact that the speaker doesn&#x27;t go out is already established, therefore it cannot be stated. What is still open and under negotiation is the reason for that fact. The causal nexus is represented by the independent clause complex and not by the two interdependent clause simplexes.

See also copula for the consequences of the verb &quot;to be&quot; on the theory of sentence structure.

== Classification ==

=== By structure ===
One traditional scheme for classifying English sentences is by clause structure, the number and types of clauses in the sentence with finite verbs.
* A &quot;simple sentence&quot; consists of a single independent clause with no dependent clauses.
* A &quot;compound sentence&quot; consists of multiple independent clauses with no dependent clauses. These clauses are joined together using conjunctions, punctuation, or both.
* A &quot;complex sentence&quot; consists of one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.
* A &quot;compound–complex sentence&quot; (or &quot;complex–compound sentence&quot;) consists of multiple independent clauses, at least one of which has at least one dependent clause.

=== By function or speech act ===
Sentences can also be classified based on the speech act which they perform. For instance, English sentence types can be described as follows:
* A declarative sentence makes a statement or assertion:
** &quot;You are my friend.&quot;
* An interrogative sentence raises a question:
** &quot;Are you my friend?&quot;
* An imperative sentence makes a command:
** &quot;Be my friend!&quot;
* An exclamative or exclamatory sentence raises an exclamation:
** &quot;What a good friend you are!&quot;

The form (declarative, interrogative, imperative, or exclamative) and meaning (statement, question, command, or exclamation) of a sentence usually match, but not always. For instance, the interrogative sentence &quot;Can you pass me the salt?&quot; is not intended to express a question but rather to express a command. Likewise, the interrogative sentence &quot;Can&#x27;t you do anything right?&quot; is not intended to express a question on the listener&#x27;s ability, but rather to make an exclamation about the listener&#x27;s lack of ability, also called a rhetorical question.

=== Major and minor sentences ===
A major sentence is a &quot;regular&quot; sentence; it has a subject and a predicate, e.g. &quot;I have a ball.&quot; In this sentence, one can change the persons, e.g. &quot;We have a ball.&quot; However, a minor sentence is an irregular type of sentence that does not contain a main clause, e.g. &quot;Mary!&quot;, &quot;Precisely so.&quot;, &quot;Next Tuesday evening after it gets dark.&quot; Other examples of minor sentences are headings, stereotyped expressions (&quot;Hello!&quot;), emotional expressions (&quot;Wow!&quot;), proverbs, etc. These can also include nominal sentences like &quot;The more, the merrier.&quot; These mostly omit a main verb for the sake of conciseness but may also do so in order to intensify the meaning around the nouns.

Sentences that comprise a single word are called word sentences, and the words themselves sentence words.

== Length ==
The 1980s saw a renewed surge in interest in sentence length, primarily in relation to &quot;other syntactic phenomena&quot;.

One definition of the average sentence length of a prose passage is the ratio of the number of words to the number of sentences.
The textbook &quot;Mathematical Linguistics&quot;, by András Kornai, suggests that in &quot;journalistic prose the median sentence length is above 15 words&quot;.
The average length of a sentence generally serves as a measure of sentence difficulty or complexity. In general, as the average sentence length increases, the complexity of the sentences also increases.

Another definition of &quot;sentence length&quot; is the number of clauses in the sentence, whereas the &quot;clause length&quot; is the number of phones in the clause.

Research by Erik Schils and Pieter de Haan by sampling five texts showed that two adjacent sentences are more likely to have similar lengths than two non-adjacent sentences, and almost certainly have a similar length when in a work of fiction. This countered the theory that &quot;authors may aim at an alternation of long and short sentences&quot;.
Sentence length, as well as word difficulty, are both factors in the readability of a sentence; however, other factors, such as the presence of conjunctions, have been said to &quot;facilitate comprehension considerably&quot;.

<text>The first USS &quot;Wickes&quot; (DD-75) was the lead ship of her class of destroyers in the United States Navy during World War I, later transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Montgomery&quot;. She has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name &quot;Montgomery&quot;.

== United States Navy service ==

&quot;Wickes&quot; was laid down on 26 June 1917 at Bath, Maine, by the Bath Iron Works. The ship was launched on 25 June 1918; sponsored by Miss Ann Elizabeth Young Wickes, the daughter of Dr. Walter Wickes, a descendant of Lambert Wickes. The destroyer was commissioned on 31 July 1918.

=== World War I ===

After an abbreviated shakedown, &quot;Wickes&quot; departed Boston on 5 August and arrived at New York City on 8 August. Later that day, she sailed for the British Isles, escorting a convoy of a dozen merchantmen. After shepherding her charges across the Atlantic, &quot;Wickes&quot; was detached from the convoy to make a brief stop at Queenstown, Ireland, on 19 August. Underway again the following day, the warship sailed for the Azores to pick up passengers and United States-bound mail at Ponta Delgada before continuing on to New York.

&quot;Wickes&quot; subsequently escorted convoys off the northeast coast of the United States. She departed New York on 7 October, bound for Nova Scotia; but, during the voyage north, her crew was hit by influenza. Soon after the ship&#x27;s arrival at Halifax, 30 men—including the commanding officer—were hospitalized ashore.

Soon the outbreak of flu in &quot;Wickes&quot; abated, but bad luck seemed to dog the destroyer. She departed New York at 1748 on 23 October, screening ahead of the armored cruiser &quot;Pueblo&quot; and escorting a convoy of merchant vessels. At 2104, &quot;Wickes&quot; sighted an unidentified ship to port on a collision course. She immediately changed her course and switched on her lights. When the oncoming ship failed to give way, the destroyer ordered full speed astern and went to general quarters. At 2110, only six minutes after the initial sighting, the unidentified ship&#x27;s bow smashed into &quot;Wickes&quot; port billboard. The stem of the stranger cut through the destroyer&#x27;s keel and caused extensive damage forward. There were no personnel casualties; and the flood was contained by a key bulkhead which held fast. In this case of &quot;hit and run&quot; on the high seas, the assailant remained unknown, since she scraped the destroyer&#x27;s port side and steamed off into the night. Stopping engines at 2112, &quot;Wickes&quot; crew took stock of the damage and put about for the New York Navy Yard, where she arrived at 0453 on 24 October.

While the ship was undergoing repairs there, the signing of the armistice on 11 November 1918 stilled the guns of World War I. President Woodrow Wilson sailed for Europe in the transport ; and &quot;Wickes&quot; served as part of the escort screen for the President&#x27;s ship, departing from New York on 4 December 1918, bound for Brest, France.

=== 1918–22 ===

&quot;Wickes&quot; subsequently cruised to northern European ports in late 1918-—calling at Hamburg and Stettin, Germany; and Harwich, England. During this European cruise, while mooring at Hamburg on 3 March 1919, the destroyer collided with the German merchantman &quot;Ljusne Elf&quot;. After repairs, the destroyer shifted to Brest in June and from there escorted &quot;George Washington&quot; as that transport carried President Wilson back home to the United States.

After celebrating the 4 July 1919 off the Atlantic coast, &quot;Wickes&quot; and her sisters sailed for the Pacific, transiting the Panama Canal on 24 July 1919 with the mass movement of the ships from Atlantic to Pacific. Later in that year, Commander William F. Halsey took command of the ship, after an overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard. Halsey, who would win fame in World War II, later stated in his memoirs that &quot;Wickes&quot; was &quot;the best ship I ever commanded; she was also the smartest and the cleanest.&quot; As flagship for Destroyer Division 10, &quot;Wickes&quot; operated off the west coast into 1922, conducting the usual target practices and exercises. As a wave of peacetime austerity swept over the United States, the Navy felt the &quot;pinch&quot; of decreased expenditures and the widespread antimilitary sentiment which cropped up in the aftermath of World War I. Accordingly, &quot;Wickes&quot; was decommissioned and placed in reserve at San Diego, California, on 15 May 1922.

=== 1923–40 ===

The destroyer lay out of commission for eight years. Recommissioned on 26 April 1930, &quot;Wickes&quot; shifted to the Atlantic and was based at New York. She operated off the eastern seaboard, making training cruises with Naval Reserve detachments from the 3d Naval District embarked. From 3 to 18 February 1931, the ship visited Tampa, Florida, for the Florida State Fair and Gasparilla Pirate Festival, before she shifted to Mobile, Alabama, to take part in Mardi Gras observances. In November, the busy destroyer visited Bridgeport, Connecticut, to participate in the Armistice Day observances on the 11th. During January and February 1932, the destroyer was attached to the Special Service Squadron operating in Central American waters and qualified for the Second Nicaraguan Campaign Medal. In April 1932, two years after being recommissioned, &quot;Wickes&quot; reported for duty with Rotating Reserve Squadron 20 and subsequently shifted back to the Pacific.

From 1933 to 1937, &quot;Wickes&quot; operated out of San Diego, commanded by Lt. Comdr. Ralph U. Hyde, (&#x27;17), with Lt. Milton E. Miles as Exec. Decommissioned on 6 April 1937, the destroyer remained in reserve only a short time because of the increase of tension in Europe and the Far East. Fighting broke out in Poland on 1 September 1939 as German forces invaded that country and thus triggered British and French assistance to Poland. World War II was on.

President Franklin Delano Roosevelt promptly directed that the Navy establish a &quot;Neutrality Patrol&quot; off the eastern seaboard, in the approaches to the Panama Canal and Guantánamo Bay, and at the two entrances to the Gulf of Mexico. To help patrol these stretches of sea, the Navy quickly reactivated 77 destroyers and light minelayers.

&quot;Wickes&quot; was recommissioned on 30 September 1939. Over the ensuing month, the destroyer was fitted out while moored at the destroyer base alongside . Early in November, she shifted to the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, for drydocking. After returning to San Diego on 21 November, &quot;Wickes&quot; departed the west coast on 27 November, bound for Panama in company with her division, Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 64. En route, she fueled from the oiler and arrived at Balboa, Panama, on 6 December. Transiting the canal the next day, the destroyer arrived at the Naval Operating Base (NOB), Key West, Florida, on 11 December and commenced neutrality patrol duty.

&quot;Wickes&quot; and her sister ships patrolled alternately in the Yucatán Channel between the east coast of Cuba and the Yucatán Peninsula and in the passage between Florida and the west coast of Cuba. They shadowed belligerent merchantmen and warships of the British and Commonwealth navies searching for German freighters or passenger ships caught in or near American coastal waters by the outbreak of war.

On her first patrol, &quot;Wickes&quot; spotted a cruiser—possibly or (her log is not specific here)—at 1058 on 14 December. The destroyer shadowed the cruiser, changing courses and speeds to conform to the other ship&#x27;s movements, until well after nightfall. Anchored off Port Everglades, Florida, just before Christmas of 1939, &quot;Wickes&quot; noted the British destroyer maintaining a diligent patrol off the Florida coast between 23 and 25 December.

&quot;Wickes&quot; returned to Key West on 30 December but enjoyed barely enough time to refuel and provision before she got underway again on 2 January 1940. She maintained a patrol off the Yucatán Peninsula for a week before returning to Key West on 9 January. Shifting to Guantánamo Bay soon thereafter, &quot;Wickes&quot; exercised with larger units of the Atlantic Squadron from 24 to 26 January before proceeding with DesDiv 64 for Puerto Cabello, Venezuela on 26 January. Arriving the following day, the ships commenced a three-day port visit.

After leaving Puerto Cabello, &quot;Wickes&quot; and her division mates visited St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, before joining DesDiv 65 at St. Eustatius, Dutch West Indies, on 6 February. The next day, these two divisions rendezvoused with the cruiser and DesDiv 82; together with DesDivs 61 and 83 and the heavy cruiser , these ships formed the &quot;Antilles Detachment&quot; of the Atlantic Squadron. After formation steaming and exercises, &quot;Wickes&quot; arrived back at Guantánamo Bay on 9 February before shifting to NOB Key West on the 14th.

In late February, &quot;Wickes&quot; again patrolled the Florida Straits, visiting the Dry Tortugas in the course of her operations. At the end of March, she sailed on the Yucatán Patrol. Returning to Key West on 8 April, &quot;Wickes&quot; maneuvered alongside the destroyer at the fuel pier there. The two ships touched and broke off the propeller guard from &quot;Twiggs&quot; which punctured a small hole above &quot;Wickes&quot; waterline. The damage was minor, and the destroyer returned to sea shortly thereafter to conduct short range battle practice off Key West before undertaking another stint on the Yucatán Patrol in mid-April.

From late April through mid-June, &quot;Wickes&quot; visited San Juan, Puerto Rico, and St. Thomas. She departed from the latter port on 1 July to join the battleships , , and that afternoon and conducted simulated torpedo attacks upon them at night. &quot;Wickes&quot; then operated out of San Juan for the remainder of the month.

Meanwhile, in Europe, the situation facing the British had materially worsened. The devastating German &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; had carried the Low Countries before it and knocked France out of the war. British destroyer forces had suffered terribly in the ill-fated Norwegian campaign and in the evacuation from Dunkirk. Moreover, German U-boats had taken their toll in their operations against British convoys. With Italy&#x27;s entry into the war in the summer of 1940, the British were faced with another long lifeline to defend in the Mediterranean.

==Transfer to Britain==

Prime Minister Winston Churchill appealed to President Roosevelt for assistance; and, during the summer of 1940, an agreement was worked out between the United States and Great Britain. In return for 50 &quot;overage&quot; American destroyers transferred to the Royal Navy, the United States received leases, for a duration of 99 years, on strategic base sites stretching from Newfoundland to British Guiana.

Accordingly, 50 ships were picked for transfer— &quot;Wickes&quot; among them. After her last Caribbean tour, the destroyer returned to Key West on 24 July. She shifted to Galveston, Texas, on 27 July for an overhaul at Todd&#x27;s Drydock Company and remained there through August.

&quot;Wickes&quot; departed Galveston in company with the destroyer , on 22 September, touched briefly at Key West, and arrived at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, on 26 September. On 9 October, &quot;Wickes&quot; departed Hampton Roads with DesDiv 64 and stopped at the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, Rhode Island, soon thereafter. The ships transited the Cape Cod Canal, en route to Provincetown, Massachusetts, and after stopping there briefly, pushed on for Halifax Nova Scotia, where they arrived on 16 October.

As part of the fifth group of destroyers transferred to the British and Canadians, &quot;Wickes&quot; was visited by Prime Minister Mackenzie King of Canada and Rear Admiral Ferdinand L. Reichmuth, USN, the Commander, Destroyers, Atlantic Fleet, on 19 October, during the indoctrination period for the prospective British crew. On 23 October 1940, &quot;Wickes&quot; was turned over to the Royal Navy. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 8 January 1941.

=== As HMS &quot;Montgomery&quot; ===

She was commissioned simultaneously on 23 January under the White Ensign as HMS &quot;Montgomery&quot; (G95).

The destroyer underwent further fitting out and familiarisation before departing Canadian waters on 1 November, bound for the British Isles. En route, &quot;Montgomery&quot; and the other of her sister ships in company swept through the scene of the one-sided naval engagement between the armed merchant cruiser and the German &quot;pocket battleship&quot; . This action had occurred on 5 November when the German warship attacked a convoy escorted by the erstwhile merchant steamship. &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; had interposed herself between the raider and the convoy, allowing the latter to escape while being herself sunk. &quot;Montgomery&quot; found nothing, however, and after searching briefly for the German &quot;pocket battleship&quot;—with orders to shadow by day and attack by night—arrived at Belfast, Northern Ireland, on 11 November.

Shifting to Plymouth, England, a week later, &quot;Montgomery&quot; was allocated to the Western Approaches command and based at Liverpool. During the course of one of her early patrols, &quot;Montgomery&quot; rescued 39 survivors from the motor tanker &quot;Scottish Standard&quot; which had been torpedoed and sunk by the on 21 February 1941. Disembarking the rescued mariners on 24 February, &quot;Montgomery&quot; resumed her Western Approaches patrols soon thereafter.

The flush-decker underwent repairs at Barrow-in-Furness from April to September and was later assigned to the 4th Escort Group. &quot;Montgomery&quot; was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original 4-inch/50-caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of hedgehog. Based now at Greenock, the destroyer operated between the British Isles and Canadian ports through the end of 1941. On 13 January 1942, the Panamanian-registered steamer SS &quot;Friar Rock&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Four days later, &quot;Montgomery&quot; picked up seven survivors from that ship.

In February 1942, &quot;Montgomery&quot; came under the aegis of the Western Local Escort Force at Halifax. Later in 1942, the destroyer was loaned to the Royal Canadian Navy before she sailed south and underwent repairs at the Charleston Navy Yard which lasted into the following year 1943. Resuming her coastwise convoy escort operations in February 1943, &quot;Montgomery&quot; rescued survivors of the torpedoed &quot;Manchester Merchant&quot;— sunk by on 25 February 1943, off Cape Race.

The destroyer remained with the Western Local Escort Force into late 1943, operating out of Halifax. On 12 December 1943, she assisted the Bowater-Lloyd Paper Co. barge &quot;Spruce Lake&quot; and, on 27 December, departed Halifax for the British Isles, carrying the surviving crew members from the torpedoed British destroyer which had been sunk by on 24 December.

Arriving in England soon thereafter, &quot;Montgomery&quot; was placed in reserve in the River Tyne on 23 February 1944. Removed from the &quot;effective list&quot;—the British equivalent of the United States Navy&#x27;s &quot;Navy List&quot; – the veteran flush-decker was subsequently broken up for scrap in the spring of 1945 shortly before the end of the war in Europe.

<doc id="870354" wikidata="Q3978541" url="?curid=870354" title="History of Russia (1855–1894)">
<text>In 1855, Alexander II began his reign as Tsar of Russia and presided over a period of political and social reform, notably the emancipation of serfs in 1861 and the lifting of censorship. His successor Alexander III (r. 1881–1894) pursued a policy of repression and restricted public expenditure, but continued land and labour reforms. This was a period of population growth and significant industrialization, though Russia remained a largely rural country.

Political movements of the time included the Populists (&quot;Narodniki&quot;), anarchists and Marxists. A revolutionary organization called People&#x27;s Will (&quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot;) assassinated Alexander II. Another current of thought was embodied in the Slavophiles, who opposed modernization and Westernization.

Russia continued to expand its empire, occupying the Caucasus, Tashkent and Samarkand. In foreign affairs, the period began with the conclusion of the Crimean War. Russian policy brought it into conflict with other European powers, in particular Austria-Hungary, as it sought to extend influence over the European portions of the receding Ottoman Empire and regain naval access to the Black Sea. This culminated in a successful war with the Ottoman Empire in 1877–1878, followed by the Treaty of San Stefano and Congress of Berlin in 1878 by which an independent Bulgaria came into being and by acquisition of former Ottoman territories in the South Caucasus. Russia joined Germany and Austria-Hungary in the League of the Three Emperors, but friction continued with both partners over Bulgaria. The alliance with Germany came to an end in 1890.

==Economic development==

Russia&#x27;s population growth rate from 1850 to 1910 was the fastest of all the major powers except for the United States. Between 1850 and 1900, Russia&#x27;s population doubled, but it remained chiefly rural well into the twentieth century.

The proclamation law of 1861 freed the peasants from dependence on the landowners and granted them all the land, previously worked by the peasants for their own use. Agriculture remained in the hands of peasants, who together constituted about four-fifths of the rural population, and former landowners. By the end of 19th century, Russia was the largest producer and exporter of cereals in the world. Owing to the development of agriculture, Russia gradually assumed a more important position in the world trade.

Industrial growth was significant, although unsteady, and in absolute terms it was not extensive. Russia&#x27;s industrial regions included Moscow, the central regions of European Russia, Saint Petersburg, the Baltic cities, Russian Poland, some areas along the lower Don and Dnepr rivers, and the southern Ural Mountains. By 1890 Russia had about 32,000 kilometers of railroads and 1.4 million factory workers, most of whom worked in the textile industry. Between 1860 and 1890, annual coal production had grown about 1,200 percent to over 6.8 million tons, and iron and steel production had more than doubled to 2 million tons per year. The state budget had more than doubled, however, and debt expenditures had quadrupled, constituting 28 percent of official expenditures in 1891.

==Reforms and their limits==
Tsar Alexander II, who succeeded Nicholas I in 1855, was a man of a liberal disposition, who saw no alternative but to implement change in the aftermath of the Disastrous performance of the Army, the economy and the government during Crimean War. Alexander initiated substantial reforms in education, the government, the judiciary, and the military.

In 1861 he proclaimed the emancipation of 20 million privately held serfs. Local commissions effected emancipation by giving land and freedom to the serfs. The land allotted to the peasants was bought from the owners with the State&#x27;s assistance. The government issued bonds to the landowners for this purpose and collected redemption payments from the peasants at the rate of 5% of the total cost yearly. The government had envisioned that the 50,000 former landlords who possessed estates of more than 1.1 km would thrive without serfs and would continue to provide loyal political and administrative leadership in the countryside. The government also had expected that peasants would produce sufficient crops for their own consumption and for export sales, thereby helping to finance most of the government&#x27;s expenses, imports, and foreign debt.

Reforms of local government closely followed emancipation. In 1864 most local government in the European part of Russia was organized into provincial and district elected self-government (&quot;zemstvos&quot;), which were made up of representatives of all classes and were responsible for local schools, public health, roads, prisons, food supply, and other concerns. In 1870 elected city councils, or &quot;duma&quot;, were formed. Dominated by property owners and constrained by provincial governors and the police, the &quot;zemstva&quot; and &quot;duma&quot; raised taxes and levied labor to support their activities.

In 1864 Alexander II implemented the great judicial reform. In major towns, it established courts with juries. In general, the judicial system functioned effectively, but the government lacked the finances and cultural influence to extend the court system to the villages, where traditional peasant justice continued to operate with minimal interference from provincial officials. The Russian judicial system was modelled after contemporary French and German law. Each case had to be decided on its merits and not on precedents. This approach remained in place ever since.

Other major reforms took place in the educational and cultural spheres. Censorship, which had stifled opinion under Nicholas, was greatly relaxed, and public opinion found a voice. This greatly facilitated the government&#x27;s effort to eradicate corruption, red tape and inefficiency. Universities had gained autonomy. The Government encouraged education: it was during Alexander&#x27;s reign that the education of the peasant masses started on a vast scale. The central government attempted to act through the zemstva to establish uniform curricula for elementary schools.

In the financial sphere, Russia established the State Bank in 1866, which put the national currency on a firmer footing. The Ministry of Finance supported railroad development, which facilitated vital export activity, but it was cautious and moderate in its foreign ventures. The ministry also founded the Peasant Land Bank in 1882 to enable enterprising farmers to acquire more land. The Ministry of Internal Affairs countered this policy, however, by establishing the Nobles&#x27; Land Bank in 1885 to forestall foreclosures of mortgages.

The reform of the military service (1874) was the last of the principal reforms in Alexander&#x27;s II reign. The Franco-Prussian War demonstrated the necessity of building a modern army. The old system of long term service (25 years) for a limited number of recruits was abandoned, as being too heavy a burden for the people and as providing practically no reserves. The new conscription system, which provided for a short term of active service followed by several years in the reserve, was introduced by Dmitry Milyutin in 1874. It was drawn on democratic lines, calling to the colours all young men of 21 without distinction of class. Exemption was only granted to young men who were the sole breadwinners of their families. It also gave the army a role in teaching many peasants to read and in pioneering medical education for women.

Alexander&#x27;s far reaching policy, however, did not bring political peace to Russia. In 1881 revolutionaries assassinated Alexander II.

His son Alexander III (r. 1881–1894) initiated a period of political counterreform. He strengthened the security police, reorganizing it into an agency known as the Okhrana, gave it extraordinary powers, and placed it under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Dmitriy Tolstoy, Alexander&#x27;s minister of internal affairs, instituted the use of land captains, who were noble overseers of districts, and he restricted the power of the zemstvos and the dumas. Alexander III assigned his former tutor, conservative Konstantin Pobedonostsev, to be the procurator of the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church and Ivan Delyanov to be the minister of education. In their attempts to &quot;save&quot; Russia from &quot;modernism,&quot; they revived religious censorship, persecuted non-Orthodox and non-Russian populations, fostered anti-Semitism, and suppressed the autonomy of the universities. Their attacks on liberal and non-Russian elements alienated large segments of the population. The nationalities, particularly Poles, Finns, Latvians, Lithuanians, and Ukrainians, reacted to the regime&#x27;s efforts to Russify them by intensifying their own nationalism. Many Jews emigrated or joined radical movements. Secret organizations and political movements continued to develop despite the regime&#x27;s efforts to quell them.

Alexander III put strict economizing into practice; the civil list of the Imperial family was reduced, and estimates for the army, navy and civil service were cut down considerably. This allowed the introduction of a series of financial reforms which tended to ameliorate the condition of the peasantry: the poll tax was abolished in 1886, a law was passed to accelerate legal transfer of the land allotted to the peasants in 1861, the payments due from them for this land were greatly reduced, Crown lands were made available for leasing or purchase to the peasants on advantageous terms, and great stretches of Crown lands in Eastern Russia and Siberia were opened for peasant emigration and resettlement.

Labour legislation was first introduced in 1882 with the creation of the inspectorate of factories (in charge of health and life saving regulations), the regulation of working hours and the limitation of female and juvenile labor.

Alexander&#x27;s financial reforms prepared the way for the introduction of gold standard, which was carried out in the first years of his successor&#x27;s reign (1897). He also continued a policy of intensive railway building. Here the greatest event was the laying down of the Trans-Siberian Railway in 1891.

During the second half of the 19th century, a faction of so-called &quot;Slavophiles&quot; emerged in intellectual circles. They were convinced that Peter the Great had made a mistake in trying to modernize and Westernize the country and that Russia&#x27;s salvation lay in the rejection of Western ideas. Slavophiles believed that while the West polluted itself with science, atheism, materialism, and wealth, they should return to a simple peasant-based society centered on the Orthodox faith. The government rejected these ideas since it felt the need for rapid modernization.

It followed that Russia, despite being a polyglot empire with dozens of nationalities and languages, was anything but friendly to the nationalistic aspirations of minorities. Poles fared especially badly since they had been enemies for centuries and because they had revolted in 1830 and 1863. As Russian industrialization progressed, Poland fared quite well, but other areas like Ukraine remained backward, a problem worsened by the clumsy land reforms of Alexander II. Jews in Russia proper and Ukraine were subject to bad (and worsening) discrimination, especially since they were associated with either Poles or with revolutionary movements. Most of the latter were also highly nationalistic and oblivious to the minority problem. Even the Bolsheviks were clueless until after they had taken power in 1917.

Despite industrialization, Russia was still overwhelmingly rural and backward at the start of World War I. Moscow and Saint Petersburg were the only cities with any significant industry. Since most workers were fresh off the farm and totally uneducated, the main impetus of revolution came from middle-class college graduates frustrated at the inefficiency of Russian society.

Thus (with heavy foreign investment and technical assistance), Russia managed to achieve at least a veneer of industrialization by 1914. Along with this came all of the abuses already encountered in the West such as child labor and unsafe working conditions. But while Britain, the US, Germany, and others were eventually able to rid themselves of those problems, Russia found it much more difficult due to inadequate infrastructure and (especially) the lack of an honest, educated bureaucracy. During the latter years of the 19th century, revolutionary groups of all flavors proliferated, some of which sought to reject modernity altogether and turn the clock back to the Middle Ages.

==Foreign affairs after the Crimean War==

After the Crimean War, Russia pursued cautious and well-calculated foreign policies. Russia was hurt by the Treaty of Paris (1856), which had demilitarized the Black Sea and deprived Russia of the southern strip of Bessarabia, which controlled access to the Danube River. The treaty gave the West European powers, not Russia, the duty of protecting Christians living in the Ottoman Empire. The first phase of Alexander II&#x27;s foreign policy had the primary goal of regaining Russian naval access to the Black Sea. Russian statesmen viewed Britain and Austria (redesignated as Austria-Hungary in 1867) as opposed to that goal, so foreign policy concentrated on good relations with France, Prussia, and the United States.

Following the Crimean War, Russia revived its expansionist policies. Russian troops first moved to gain control of the Caucasus region, where the revolts of Muslim tribesmen—Chechens, Circassians, and Dagestanis—had continued despite numerous Russian campaigns in the nineteenth century. Once the forces of Aleksandr Baryatinsky had captured the legendary Chechen rebel leader Shamil in 1859, the army resumed the expansion into Central Asia that had begun under Nicholas I. The capture of Tashkent was a significant victory over the Kokand Khanate, part of which was annexed in 1866. By 1867 Russian forces had captured enough territory to form the Guberniya (Governorate General) of Turkestan, the capital of which was Tashkent. The Bukhara Khanate then lost the crucial Samarkand area to Russian forces in 1868. To avoid alarming Britain, which had strong interests in protecting nearby India, Russia left the Bukhoran territories directly bordering Afghanistan and Persia nominally independent. The Central Asian khanates retained a degree of autonomy until 1917.

Russia followed the United States, Britain, and France in establishing relations with Japan, and, together with Britain and France, Russia obtained concessions from China consequent to the Second Opium War (1856–1860). Under the Treaty of Aigun in 1858 and the Treaty of Beijing in 1860, China ceded to Russia extensive trading rights and regions adjacent to the Amur and Ussuri rivers and allowed Russia to begin building a port and naval base at Vladivostok.
As part of the foreign policy goals in Europe, Russia initially gave guarded support to France&#x27;s anti-Austrian diplomacy. A weak Franco-Russian entente soured, however, when France backed a Polish uprising against Russian rule in 1863. Russia then aligned itself more closely with Prussia by approving the unification of Germany in exchange for a revision of the Treaty of Paris and the remilitarization of the Black Sea. These diplomatic achievements came at a London conference in 1871, following France&#x27;s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. After 1871 Germany, united under Prussian leadership, was the strongest continental power in Europe. In 1873 Germany formed the loosely knit League of the Three Emperors with Russia and Austria-Hungary to prevent them from forming an alliance with France. Nevertheless, Austro-Hungarian and Russian ambitions clashed in the Balkans, where rivalries among Slavic nationalities and anti-Ottoman sentiments seethed.

In the 1870s, Russian nationalist opinion became a serious domestic factor in its support for liberating Balkan Christians from Ottoman rule and making Bulgaria and Serbia quasi-protectorates of Russia. From 1875 to 1877, the Balkan crisis escalated with the rebellion in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and insurrection in Bulgaria, which the Ottoman Turks suppressed with such great cruelty that Serbia, but none of the West European powers, declared war. In early 1877, Russia came to the rescue of beleaguered Serbia when it went to war with the Ottoman Empire of 1877–1878. Within one year, Russian troops were nearing Constantinople, and the Ottomans surrendered. Russia&#x27;s nationalist diplomats and generals persuaded Alexander II to force the Ottomans to sign the Treaty of San Stefano in March 1878, creating an enlarged, independent Bulgaria that stretched into the southwestern Balkans. Another significant result of the 1877–78 Russo-Turkish War in Russia&#x27;s favour was the acquisition from the Ottomans of the provinces of Batum, Ardahan, and Kars in the South Caucasus, which were transformed into the militarily administered regions of Batum Oblast and Kars Oblast. To replace Muslim refugees who had fled across the new frontier into Ottoman territory the Russian authorities settled large numbers of Christians from an ethnically diverse range of communities in Kars Oblast, particularly the Greek Orthodox Georgians and Caucasus Greeks, and Christian but mainly non-Orthodox Armenians, all of whom hoped to achieve their own regional ambitions on the back of the Russian Empire. When Britain threatened to declare war over the terms of the Treaty of San Stefano, an exhausted Russia backed down. At the Congress of Berlin in July 1878, Russia agreed to the creation of a smaller Bulgaria. Russian nationalists were furious with Austria-Hungary and Germany for failing to back Russia, but the Tsar accepted a revived and strengthened League of the Three Emperors as well as Austro-Hungarian hegemony in the western Balkans.

Russian diplomatic and military interests subsequently re-focussed on Central Asia, where Russia had quelled a series of uprisings in the 1870s, and Russia incorporated hitherto independent emirates into the empire. Britain renewed its concerns in 1881 when Russian troops occupied Turkmen lands on the Persian and Afghan borders, but Germany lent diplomatic support to Russian advances, and an Anglo-Russian war was averted. Meanwhile, Russia&#x27;s sponsorship of Bulgarian independence brought negative results as the Bulgarians, angry at Russia&#x27;s continuing interference in domestic affairs, sought the support of Austria-Hungary. In the dispute that arose between Austria-Hungary and Russia, Germany took a firm position toward Russia while mollifying the tsar with a bilateral defensive alliance, the Reinsurance Treaty of 1887 between Germany and Russia. Within a year, Russo-German acrimony led to Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s forbidding further loans to Russia, and France replaced Germany as Russia&#x27;s financier. When Wilhelm II dismissed Bismarck in 1890, the loose Russo-Prussian entente collapsed after having lasted for more than twenty-five years. Three years later, Russia allied itself with France by entering into a joint military convention, which matched the dual alliance formed in 1879 by Germany and Austria-Hungary.

==Russia and the U.S Civil War==
===Russia rejects the Anglo-French Intrigues for interference===
The clouds of world war gathered densely over the planet. Russell and Gladstone, now joined by Napoleon III, continued to demand aggressive meddling in US affairs. This outcome was avoided because of British and French fears of what Russia might do if they continued to launch bellicose gestures against the Union. On 29 October 1862 there occurred in St. Petersburg an extremely cordial meeting of Russian Foreign Minister Alexander Gorchakov with US chargé d&#x27;affaires Bayard Taylor, which was marked by a formal Russian pledge never to move against the US, and to oppose any attempt by other powers to do so. Taylor reported these comments by Gortchakov to the State Department: &quot;You know the sentiments of Russia. We desire above all things the maintenance of the American Union as one indivisible nation. We cannot take any part, more than we have done. We have no hostility to the Southern people. Russia has declared her position and will maintain it. There will be proposals of intervention [by Britain and France]. We believe that intervention could do no good at present. Proposals will be made to Russia to join some plan of interference. She will refuse any intervention of the kind. Russia will occupy the same ground as at the beginning of the struggle. You may rely upon it, she will not change. But we entreat you to settle the difficulty. I cannot express to you how profound an anxiety we feel – how serious are our fears.&quot;

The &quot;Journal de St.-Pétersbourg&quot;, the official gazette of the Tsarist government, denounced the Anglo-French intervention plan against the US, which had been inspired by Russell. This article helped prevent a wider war: the British cabinet, informed of the Russian attitude by telegraph, voted down Russell&#x27;s aggressive project. Russell made his last bid to swing the British cabinet in favor of a policy of interference together with Napoleon III against the Union on 12 November 1862, but he was unable to carry the day, and this turned out to be his last chance for the year.

US Secretary of State William H. Seward thought that if the Anglo-French were to assail the Union, they would soon find themselves at war with Russia as well. He wrote to John Bigelow early in the war: &quot;I have a belief that the European State, whichever one it may be, that commits itself to intervention anywhere in North America, will sooner or later fetch up in the arms of a native of an oriental country not especially distinguished for amiability of manners or temper.&quot;

===Adams to Russell: &quot;superfluous to point out this means war===
The summer of 1863, despite the news of Gettysburg and Vicksburg, was marked by another close brush with US-UK war. It was on 5 September 1863 that US Ambassador Charles Francis Adams Sr. told British Foreign Secretary Lord Russell that if the &quot;Scorpion&quot;-class ironclads – powerful warships capable of breaking the Union blockade which were then under construction in England – were allowed to leave port, &quot;It would be superfluous in me to point out to your Lordship that this is war.&quot; Lord Russell had to pause, and then backed off entirely. The &quot;Scorpion&quot;-class ships were put under surveillance by the British government on 9 September, and finally seized by the British government in mid-October, 1863. They never fought for the Confederacy.

A revolt against Russian domination of Poland, incited by the British, started in 1863 and lasted into late 1864. Crook points out that it was Lord Russell who told British Ambassador to the US Lord Lyons in March 1863 that the Polish issue had the potential to create a Russo-American common front and thus revolutionize world power relations, evidently to the detriment of London. Such a prophecy was coherent with the then-fashionable ideas of Alexis de Tocqueville about Russia and America as the two great powers of the future.

===Russian fleets in New York and San Francisco===
The most dramatic gestures of cooperation between the Russian Empire and the United States came in the autumn of 1863, as the Laird rams crisis hung in the balance. On 24 September, the Russian Baltic fleet began to arrive in New York harbor. On 12 October, the Russian Far East fleet began to arrive in San Francisco. The Russians, judging that they were on the verge of war with Britain and France over the British-fomented Polish insurrection of 1863, had taken this measure to prevent their ships from being bottled up in their home ports by the superior British fleet. These ships were also the tokens of the vast Russian land armies that could be thrown in the scales on a number of fronts, including the northwest frontier of India; the British had long been worried about such an eventuality. In mid-July 1863, French Foreign Minister Édouard Drouyn de Lhuys was offering London the joint occupation of Poland by means of invasion. But the experience of the Confederate commerce raiders had graphically illustrated just how effective even a limited number of warships could be when they turned to commerce raiding, which is what the Russian naval commanders had been ordered to do in case of hostilities. The Russian admirals had also been told that, if the US and Russia were to find themselves at war with Britain and France, the Russian ships should place themselves under Lincoln&#x27;s command and operate in synergy with the US Navy against the common enemies. It is thus highly significant that the Russian ships were sent to the United States.

===Navy Secretary Gideon Welles: &quot;God Bless the Russians&quot;===
Coming on the heels of the bloody Union reverse at Chickamauga, the news of the Russian fleet unleashed an immense wave of euphoria in the North. It was this moment that inspired the later verses of Oliver Wendell Holmes, one of the most popular writers in America, for the 1871 friendship visit of the Russian Grand Duke Alexis:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Bleak are our shores with the blasts of December, / Fettered and chill is the rivulet&#x27;s flow; / Thrilling and warm are the hearts that remember / Who was our friend when the world was our foe. ... Fires of the North in eternal communion, / Blend your broad flashes with evening&#x27;s bright star; / God bless the Empire that loves the Great Union; / Strength to her people! Long life to the Czar!&quot; &lt;/poem&gt;

The Russians, as Clay reported to Seward and Lincoln, were delighted in turn by the celebration of their fleets, which stayed in American waters for over six months as the Polish revolt was quelled. The Russian officers were lionized and feted, and had their pictures taken by the famous New York photographer Matthew Brady. When an attack on San Francisco by the Confederate cruiser &quot;Shenandoah&quot; seemed to be imminent, the Russian admiral there gave orders to his ships to defend the city if necessary. There were no major Union warships on the scene, so Russia was about to fight for the United States. In the event, the Confederate raider did not attack. Soon after the war, Russia sold Alaska to the United States, in part because they felt that an influx of Americans searching for gold was inevitable, and in part to keep the British from seizing control of this vast region. Lincoln&#x27;s Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles wrote in his diary, &quot;The Russian fleet has come out of the Baltic and is now in New York, or a large number of the vessels have arrived…. In sending them to this country at this time there is something significant.&quot; Welles was fully justified in his famous concluding words, &quot;God bless the Russians!&quot;. This exceedingly cordial Russo-American friendship set the tone of much nineteenth-century historiography

==Revolutionary movements==

Alexander II&#x27;s reforms, particularly the lifting of state censorship, fostered the expression of political and social thought. The regime relied on journals and newspapers to gain support for its domestic and foreign policies. But liberal, nationalist, and radical writers also helped to mold public opinion in opposition to tsarism, to private property, and to the imperial state. Because many intellectuals, professionals, peasants, and workers shared these opposition sentiments, the regime regarded the publications and the radical organizations as dangerous. From the 1860s through the 1880s, Russian radicals, collectively known as &quot;Populists&quot; (&quot;Narodniki&quot;), focused chiefly on the peasantry, whom they identified as &quot;the people&quot; (&quot;narod&quot;).

The leaders of the Populist movement included radical writers, idealists, and advocates of terrorism. In the 1860s, Nikolai Chernyshevsky, the most important radical writer of the period, posited that Russia could bypass capitalism and move directly to socialism. His most influential work, &quot;Что делать?&quot; (&quot;What Is to Be Done?&quot;, 1863), describes the role of an individual of a &quot;superior nature&quot; who guides a new, revolutionary generation. Other radicals such as the incendiary anarchist Mikhail Bakunin (1814–1876) and his terrorist collaborator, Sergey Nechayev (1847–1882), urged direct action. The calmer Petr Tkachev (1844–1886) argued against the advocates of Marxism, maintaining that a centralized revolutionary band had to seize power before capitalism could fully develop. Disputing his views, the moralist and individualist Petr Lavrov (1823–1900) made a call &quot;to the people&quot;, which hundreds of idealists heeded in 1873 and 1874 by leaving their schools for the countryside to try to generate a mass movement among the &quot;narod&quot;. However, The Populist campaign failed when the peasants showed hostility to the urban idealists and the government began to consider nationalist opinion more seriously.

The radicals reconsidered their approach, and in 1876 they formed a propagandist organization called &quot;Land and Liberty&quot; (Zemlya i volya), which leaned toward terrorism. This orientation became stronger three years later, when the group renamed itself the &quot;People&#x27;s Will&quot; (Narodnaya Volya), the name under which the radicals carried out the assassination of Alexander II in 1881. In 1879 Georgi Plekhanov formed a propagandist faction of &quot;Land and Liberty&quot; called &quot;Black Repartition&quot; (Черный передел, &quot;Chernyi Peredel&quot;), which advocated redistributing all land to the peasantry. This group studied Marxism, which, paradoxically, was principally concerned with urban industrial workers. The People&#x27;s Will remained underground.

<doc id="870356" wikidata="Q952651" url="?curid=870356" title="Mile high club">
<text>The mile high club is slang for people who have had sexual intercourse on board an aircraft during flight. While this usually refers to sexual acts in an airliner lavatory (for privacy), a sexual act anywhere on a plane in flight would fit the term. The actual height of the aircraft at the time the act takes place is not relevant; sexual activity in a plane flying 10 feet off the ground would still qualify.

An alleged explanation for wanting to perform the act is the supposed vibration of the plane. Some also theorize that people who engage in the act have had personal fantasies about pilots, flight attendants, or other aircraft crew, or a fetish about planes themselves, a type of mechanophilia. For others, the appeal of joining the mile-high club is the thrill of doing something taboo and the thrill of the risk of being discovered, as well as the thrill of simply engaging in sexual intercourse thousands of feet above the earth.

==History==
An early reference to the concept is found in the betting book for Brooks&#x27;s, a London gentlemen&#x27;s club. The 1785 entry (only two years after the first successful balloon ascent by Étienne Montgolfier) reads: &quot;Ld. Cholmondeley has given two guineas to Ld. Derby, to receive 500 Gs whenever his lordship fucks a woman in a Balloon one thousand yards from the Earth.&quot; There is no further indication whether the bet was paid, or how any claim would be validated.

During the First World War, German ace Oswald Boelcke was disciplined by superiors for taking a nurse up in the cockpit of his fighter, allegedly becoming the first person to qualify as a member of the club (although the claim is dubious, considering the cramped cockpit space and the pilot requirement to constantly keep hands and feet on the control stick and rudder pedals; others maintain it was a simple joyride).

Pilot/engineer Lawrence Sperry and socialite Dorothy Rice Sims have been described as the first persons to engage in sex while flying in an airplane; the two flew in an autopilot-equipped Curtiss Flying Boat near New York in November 1916. 

The American National Transportation Safety Board reported on a 1991 incident in which sexual activity was at least partly responsible for the fatal crash of a Piper PA-34.

In November 2007, the BBC reported a story headlined &quot;Airline Bans A380 Mile-High Club&quot;. The Airbus A380 allows double beds to be installed in the first-class cabin, but Singapore Airlines&#x27; cabins are not soundproof; shortly after installing the new seats/beds, the airline requested that first-class travelers respect other passengers.

==Reported instances==
Some incidents of people attempting sexual activity on planes have been reported in the media:
* Richard Branson, the British billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the Virgin Group, including Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Australia, claimed that he joined the mile-high club at age 19 (c. 1969) in the plane&#x27;s lavatory. Afterwards, he found out that his partner in the act was married, and the two had no relationship beyond the encounter in the plane.
* In October 1999, two passengers of an American Airlines flight from Dallas to Manchester were arrested after engaging in &quot;sex acts&quot; in front of other passengers in the business class section of the aircraft. Both lost their jobs after the press storm following the incident.
* A 2005 British Airways flight from London to Jamaica diverted to Bermuda when a couple on board, who had possibly been intoxicated even before consuming more beer and wine on the plane, threatened flight attendants after they told them to return to their seats when the attendants found Fitzgerald giving a lap dance to Blake in a crew jump seat; ultimately, the two were physically confined to their seats. The two claimed later they had already had sex twice in the aircraft lavatory before their return to the UK. Blake was sentenced to prison and Fitzgerald was sentenced to community service.
* In late 2006, a couple was arrested in part for refusing to stop overt sexual activity on a flight in a case that received widespread media attention. The couple&#x27;s lawyer claimed that the couple were not engaging in sexual activity, but that the man was sick and resting his head on the woman&#x27;s lap.
* In 2007, British actor Ralph Fiennes was embroiled in scandal after having sex with a Qantas flight attendant on a flight from Sydney to Mumbai. After initial denials, it was established that they had had sex in the plane&#x27;s lavatory, after which the flight attendant was suspended and later terminated.
* On a Virgin flight in February 2007, Danish co-founder of the Skype application, Janus Friis, openly had sex with Christina Knudsen, Roger Moore&#x27;s stepdaughter, when travelling to the Academy Awards show.

==Legality==
The BBC ran an article investigating whether sex on a plane was legal. Their conclusion was that it would depend on many factors, such as whether or not the act occurred in sight of others. If British law applied, for example, it may constitute sex in a lavatory to which the public has access, contrary to Sexual Offences Act 2003 s.71, with a maximum 6-month term of imprisonment.

Also, for international flights, the law could vary depending on departure and destination cities and the nation of the carrier airline, as well as the country of registration of the aircraft, and possibly the citizenship of the people involved.

In January 2011, the United Kingdom&#x27;s aviation regulator body, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), refused to recertify Mile-High Flights, an air charter company located in Gloucestershire, for allowing its passengers to have sex while in-flight.

==Charter flights==
Some commercial enterprises cash in on people&#x27;s interest in joining the &quot;club&quot; by offering special charter flights designed for the purpose. Starting in 2014, a North Las Vegas Airport-based charter company called Love Cloud began operating flights specifically for the purpose using a pair of Cessna 414 aircraft.

<text>Georgi Nikolov Delchev (; ; 4 February 1872 – 4 May 1903), known as Gotse Delchev or Goce Delčev (&quot;Гоце Делчев&quot;), was a prominent Macedonian Bulgarian revolutionary (komitadji) and one of the most important leaders of what is commonly known as the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), active in the Ottoman-ruled Macedonia and Adrianople regions, as well as in Bulgaria, at the turn of the 20th century. Delchev was IMRO&#x27;s foreign representative in Sofia, the capital of the Principality of Bulgaria. As such, he was also a member of the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee (SMAC), participating in the work of its governing body. He was killed in a skirmish with an Ottoman unit on the eve of the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie uprising.

Born into a Bulgarian family in Kilkis, then in the Salonika vilayet of the Ottoman Empire, in his youth he was inspired by the ideals of earlier Bulgarian revolutionaries such as Vasil Levski and Hristo Botev, who envisioned the creation of a Bulgarian republic of ethnic and religious equality, as part of an imagined Balkan Federation. Delchev completed his secondary education in the Bulgarian Men&#x27;s High School of Thessaloniki and entered the Military School of His Princely Highness in Sofia, but at the final stage of his study, he was dismissed from it as an alleged socialist. Then he returned to Ottoman Macedonia and worked as a Bulgarian teacher, and immediately became an activist of the newly-found revolutionary movement in 1894.

Although considering himself to be an inheritor of the Bulgarian revolutionary traditions, he opted for Macedonian autonomy. Also for him, like for many Macedonian Bulgarians, originating from an area with mixed population, the idea of being &#x27;Macedonian&#x27; acquired the importance of a certain native loyalty, that constructed a specific spirit of &quot;local patriotism&quot; and &quot;multi-ethnic regionalism&quot;. He maintained the slogan promoted by William Ewart Gladstone, &quot;Macedonia for the Macedonians&quot;, including all different nationalities inhabiting the area. Delchev was also an adherent of incipient socialism. His political agenda became the establishment through revolution of an autonomous Macedono-Adrianople supranational state into the framework of the Ottoman Empire, as a prelude to its incorporation within a future Balkan Federation. Despite having been educated in the spirit of Bulgarian nationalism, he revised the Organization&#x27;s statute, where the membership was allowed only for Bulgarians. In this way he emphasized the importance of cooperation among all ethnic groups in the territories concerned in order to obtain political autonomy.

Delchev is considered a national hero in Bulgaria and North Macedonia. Because his autonomist ideas have stimulated the subsequent development of Macedonian nationalism, in the latter it is claimed he was an ethnic Macedonian revolutionary. Thus, Delchev&#x27;s legacy has been disputed between both countries. Nevertheless, some researchers think that behind IMRO&#x27;s idea of autonomy a reserve plan for eventual incorporation into Bulgaria was hidden. Per some of his contemporaries and Bulgarian academic sources, Delchev supported Macedonia&#x27;s incorporation into Bulgaria as another option too. Other researchers find the identity of Delchev and other IMRO figures to be open to different interpretations.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===
He was born to a large family on 4 February 1872 (23 January according to the Julian calendar) in Kılkış (Kukush), then in the Ottoman Empire (today in Greece), to Nikola and Sultana. He was christened as Georgi. By the mid-19th century, Kılkış was populated predominantly with Macedonian Bulgarians and became one of the centers of the Bulgarian national revival. During the 1860s and 1870s it was under the jurisdiction of the Bulgarian Uniate Church, but after 1884 most of its population gradually joined the Bulgarian Exarchate. As a student, Delchev studied first at the Bulgarian Uniate primary school and then at the Bulgarian Exarchate junior high school. He also read widely in the town&#x27;s chitalishte (community cultural center), where he was impressed with revolutionary books, and was especially imbued with thoughts of the liberation of Bulgaria. In 1888 his family sent him to the Bulgarian Men&#x27;s High School of Thessaloniki, where he organized and led a secret revolutionary brotherhood. Delchev also distributed revolutionary literature, which he acquired from the school&#x27;s graduates who studied in Bulgaria. Bulgarian students graduating from high school were faced with few career prospects and Delchev decided to follow the path of his former schoolmate Boris Sarafov, entering the military school in Sofia in 1891. He became disappointed with life in Bulgaria, especially the commercialized life of the society in Sofia and with the authoritarian politics of the prime minister Stefan Stambolov, accused of being a dictator.

Delchev spent his leaves from school in the company of emigrants from the Macedonian region. Most of them belonged to the Young Macedonian Literary Society. One of his friends was Vasil Glavinov, a leader of the Macedonian-Adrianople faction of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party. Through Glavinov and his comrades, he came into contact with different people, who offered a new form of social struggle. In June 1892, Delchev and the journalist Kosta Shahov, a chairman of the Young Macedonian Literary Society, met in Sofia with the bookseller from Thessaloniki, Ivan Hadzhinikolov. Hadzhinikolov disclosed at this meeting his plans to create a revolutionary organization in Ottoman Macedonia. They discussed together its basic principles and agreed fully on all scores. Delchev explained that he had no intention of remaining an officer and promised after graduating from the Military School, he would return to Macedonia to join the organization. In September 1894, only a month before graduation, he was expelled for his socialist sympathies. He was given the possibility to enter the Army again by re-applying for a commission, but he refused. Afterwards he returned to Macedonia to become a teacher and set up secret committees, based on Vasil Levski&#x27;s example. At that time, the revolutionary organization commonly known as Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) was in its early stages of development, forming its committees around the Bulgarian Exarchate schools.

=== Teacher and revolutionary ===

In Ottoman Thessaloniki, IMRO was founded in 1893, by a small band of anti-Ottoman Macedono-Bulgarian revolutionaries, including Hadzhinikolov. The earliest known statute of the Organization calls it &quot;Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees&quot; (BMARC). It was decided at a meeting in Resen in August 1894 to preferably recruit teachers from the Bulgarian schools as committee members. In 1894, Delchev became a teacher in an Exarchate school in Štip, where he met another teacher, Dame Gruev, who was also a leader of the newly established local committee of the IMRO. Gruev told him about the existence of the Organization. Delchev impressed Gruev with his honesty and joined the Organization immediately, gradually becoming one of its main leaders. After this, Gruev concentrated his attention on Štip, while Delchev attempted to win over the surrounding villages. It is unknown how many active members the Organization had from 1893 to 1897. Despite his and Gruev&#x27;s efforts, the number of members grew slowly. Delchev travelled during the vacations throughout Macedonia and established and organized committees in villages and cities. In this period, he adopted Ahil (Archilles) as his &quot;nom de guerre&quot;. Delchev also established contacts with some of the leaders of the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee (SMAC). Its official declaration was a struggle for the autonomy of the Macedonian and Adrianople regions. However, as a rule, most of SMAC&#x27;s leaders were officers with stronger connections with the governments, waging terrorist struggle against the Ottomans in the hope of provoking a war and thus Bulgarian annexation of both areas. In late 1895 he arrived in Bulgaria&#x27;s capital Sofia from the name of the &quot;Bulgarian Central Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Revolutionary Committee&quot; to prevent any foreign interference in its work. In 1896, he advocated for the establishment of a secret revolutionary network, that would prepare the population for an armed uprising against the Ottoman rule, based on Levski&#x27;s example. After spending the next school year (1895/1896) as a teacher in the town of Bansko, in May 1896 he was arrested by the Ottoman authorities as a person suspected of revolutionary activity and spent about a month in jail. Delchev participated in the Thessaloniki Congress of the IMRO in 1896. The Central Committee was placed in Thessaloniki. He, along with Petrov, wrote the new organization&#x27;s statute, which divided Macedonia and Adrianople areas into seven regions, each with a regional structure and secret police, following the Internal Revolutionary Organization&#x27;s example. Afterwards, Delchev gave his resignation as a teacher and in the same year, he moved back to Bulgaria.

=== Revolutionary activity as part of the leadership of the Organization ===
From 1896 to 1902, he was a representative of the Foreign Committee of the IMRO in Sofia. Gyorche Petrov joined him as a representative in March 1897. At that time the Organization was largely dependent on the Bulgarian state and army assistance, that was mediated by him and Petrov. Delchev envisioned independent production of weapons and traveled in 1897 to Odessa, where he met with Armenian revolutionaries Stepan Zorian and Christapor Mikaelian to exchange terrorist skills and especially bomb-making. That resulted in the establishment of a bomb manufacturing plant in the village of Sabler near Kyustendil in Bulgaria. The bombs were later smuggled across the Ottoman border into Macedonia. In 1898 the Organization decided to create permanent acting armed bands (&quot;chetas&quot;) in every district, with Delchev as their leader.

He was the first to organize and lead a band into Macedonia with the purpose of robbing or kidnapping rich Turks. This activity of his had variable success. His experiences demonstrate the weaknesses and difficulties which the Organization faced in its early years. In 1900, he resided for a while in Burgas, where Delchev organized another bomb manufacturing plant, whose dynamite was used later by the Boatmen of Thessaloniki. After the assassination of the Romanian newspaper editor Ștefan Mihăileanu in July, who had published unflattering remarks about the Macedonian affairs, Bulgaria and Romania were brought to the brink of war. At that time Delchev was preparing to organize a detachment which, in a possible war to support the Bulgarian army by its actions in Northern Dobruja, where a compact Bulgarian population was available. From 1901 to 1902, he made an important inspection in Macedonia, touring all revolutionary districts there. He also led the congress of the Adrianople revolutionary district held in Plovdiv in April 1902. Afterwards Delchev inspected IMRO&#x27;s structures in the Central Rhodopes. The inclusion of the rural areas into the organizational districts contributed to the expansion of the Organization and the increase in its membership, while providing the essential prerequisites for the formation of its military power, at the same time having Delchev as its military advisor (inspector) and chief of all internal revolutionary bands.

After 1897 there was a rapid growth of secret officers&#x27; brotherhoods, whose members by 1900 numbered about a thousand. Much of the brotherhoods&#x27; activists were involved in the revolutionary activity of the IMRO. He was among the main supporters of their activities. Delchev aimed also for better coordination between IMRO and the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee. For a short time in the late 1890s Bulgarian lieutenant Boris Sarafov, who was a former schoolmate of Delchev became its leader, as he was promoted as a candidate by him and Petrov. IMRO delegates Delchev and Petrov became by rights members of the leadership of the Supreme Committee in May 1899 and so the IMRO even managed to gain &quot;de facto&quot; control of the SMAC. Until 1901, the two organizations had close cooperation. General Ivan Tsonchev and other fellow officers organized a faction against Delchev and Petrov. The relations between IMRO and SMAC deteriorated and in March 1901, he and Petrov sent a circular to local committee leaders of the internal organizations, denouncing the attempt of SMAC to seize the direction of IMRO. They ordered the termination of all relations with it, as well as ordered all local committees to refuse any transition of any armed group which did not have a pass signed by him or Petrov, and their weapons to be seized.

The primary question regarding the timing of the uprising in Macedonia and Thrace implicated an apparent discordance not only between the SMAC and SMARO, but also among SMARO&#x27;s leadership. At the Thessaloniki Congress of January 1903, where Delchev did not participate, an early uprising was debated and it was decided to stage one in May 1903. This led to fierce debates among the representatives at the Sofia SMARO&#x27;s Conference in March 1903. By that time two strong tendencies had crystallized within the SMARO. The right-wing majority was convinced that if the Organization would unleash a general uprising, Bulgaria would be provoked to declare war on the Ottoman Empire and after the subsequent intervention of the Great Powers the Ottoman Empire would collapse. Delchev opposed the plan for a mass uprising, instead supporting terrorist tactics and guerilla tactics such as the Thessaloniki bombings of 1903. Finally, he had no choice but to agree to that course of action, at least managing to delay its start from May to August. Delchev also convinced the SMARO leadership to transform its idea of a mass rising involving the civil population into a rising based on guerrilla warfare. Towards the end of March 1903, Delchev with his detachment destroyed the railway bridge over the Angista river, aiming to test the new guerrilla tactics. Following that he set out for Thessaloniki to meet with Dame Gruev after his release from prison in March 1903. Delchev met with Gruev in late April, and they discussed the decision of starting the uprising. After the meeting, he left for Serres, with the intention of holding a regional congress to lay out his plans for the uprising.

=== Death and aftermath ===




On 28 April, the Bulgarian anarchist group Boatmen of Thessaloniki started terrorist attacks in the city. As a consequence martial law was declared in the city and many Ottoman soldiers and &quot;bashibozouks&quot; were concentrated in the Salonika vilayet. This increased tension led eventually to the tracking of Delchev&#x27;s &quot;cheta&quot; and his subsequent death. Delchev and his &quot;cheta&quot; arrived in the village of Banitsa on 2 May for a meeting with Dimo Hadzhidimov, soon after a skirmish followed in which he was killed on 4 May 1903, with a shot to the chest, by Ottoman troops led by his former schoolmate Hussein Tefikov. It occurred presumably after betrayal by local villagers, as rumors asserted. Thus the Macedonian liberation movement lost its most important organizer and ideologist, on the eve of the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising. He was recognized as &quot;the most capable and most honest Komitadji&quot; by missionaries. After being identified by the local authorities in Serres, the bodies of Delchev and his comrade, Dimitar Gushtanov, were buried in a common grave in Banitsa. Following the skirmish, more than 500 arrests were made in various districts of Serres and 1,700 households petitioned to return to the Patriarchate. Soon afterwards SMARO, aided by SMAC, organized the uprising against the Ottoman Empire, which after initial successes, was defeated with many casualties. Two of his brothers, Mitso and Milan were also killed fighting against the Ottomans as militants in the SMARO &quot;chetas&quot; of the Bulgarian voivodas Hristo Chernopeev and Krstjo Asenov in 1901 and 1903, respectively. The Bulgarian government later granted a pension to their father Nikola, because of the contribution of his sons to the freedom of Macedonia. During the Second Balkan War of 1913, Kilkis, which had been annexed by Bulgaria in the First Balkan War, was taken by the Greeks. Virtually all of its pre-war 7,000 Bulgarian inhabitants, including Delchev&#x27;s family, were expelled to Bulgaria by the Greek Army. During Balkan Wars, when Bulgaria was temporarily in control of the area, Delchev&#x27;s remains were transferred to Xanthi, then in Bulgaria. After Western Thrace was ceded to Greece in 1919, the relic was brought to Plovdiv and in 1923 to Sofia, where it rested until after World War II. During World War II, the area was taken by the Kingdom of Bulgaria again and Delchev&#x27;s grave near Banitsa was restored. In May 1943, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of his death, a memorial plaque was set in Banitsa, in the presence of his sisters and other public figures.

The first biographical book about Delchev was issued in 1904 by his friend and comrade in arms, the Bulgarian poet Peyo Yavorov. The most detailed biography of Delchev in English was written by English historian Mercia MacDermott called &quot;Freedom or Death: The Life of Gotse Delchev&quot;, published in 1978 and translated into Bulgarian in 1979.

== Views ==
The international, cosmopolitan views of Delchev could be summarized in his proverbial sentence: &quot;I understand the world solely as a field for cultural competition among the peoples&quot;. Per MacDermott, his saying presupposes a world without political and economic conflicts and one which has a very high degree of mutual friendship and co-operation on an international level. In the late 19th century the anarchists and socialists from Bulgaria linked their struggle closely with the revolutionary movements in Macedonia and Thrace. Thus, as a young cadet in Sofia Delchev became a member of a left-wing circle, where he was influenced by modern Marxist and Bakunin&#x27;s ideas. His views were formed also under the influence of the ideas of earlier anti-Ottoman fighters as Levski, Botev, and Stoyanov, who were among the founders of the Bulgarian Internal Revolutionary Organization, the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee and the Bulgarian Secret Central Revolutionary Committee, respectively. Later he participated in the Internal Organization&#x27;s struggle as a well-educated leader.

According to Mercia MacDermott, he was the co-author of BMARC&#x27;s statute. Developing his ideas further in 1902 he took the step, together with other left-wing functionaries, of changing its nationalistic character, which determined that members of the organization could be only Bulgarians. The new supra-nationalistic statute renamed it to &quot;Secret Macedono-Adrianopolitan Revolutionary Organization&quot; (SMARO), which was to be an insurgent organization, open to all Macedonians and Thracians regardless of nationality, who wished to participate in the movement for their autonomy. This scenario was partially facilitated by the Treaty of Berlin (1878), according to which Macedonia and Adrianople areas were given back from Bulgaria to the Ottomans, but especially by its unrealized 23rd. article, which promised future autonomy for unspecified territories in European Turkey, settled with Christian population. His main goal, along with the other revolutionaries, was the implementation of Article 23 of the treaty, aimed at acquiring full autonomy of Macedonia and the Adrianople. Delchev, like other left-wing activists, vaguely determined the bonds in the future common Macedonian-Adrianople autonomous region on the one hand, and on the other between it, the Principality of Bulgaria, and &quot;de facto&quot; annexed Eastern Rumelia. Even the possibility that Bulgaria could be absorbed into a future autonomous Macedonia, rather than the reverse, was discussed. Per Bulgarian academic sources and his contemporaries, Delchev supported Macedonia&#x27;s eventual incorporation into Bulgaria, or its inclusion into a future Balkan Confederative Republic. According to American historian Dennis P. Hupchick, he firmly opposed Macedonia&#x27;s incorporation into Bulgaria. Despite his Bulgarian loyalty, he was against any chauvinistic propaganda and nationalist disputes. For militants such as Delchev and other leftists that participated in the national movement retaining a political outlook, national liberation meant &quot;radical political liberation through shaking off the social shackles&quot;. According to him, no outside force could or would help the Organization and it ought to rely only upon itself and only upon its own will and strength. He thought that any intervention by Bulgaria would provoke intervention by the neighboring states as well and could result in Macedonia and Thrace being torn apart. That is why the peoples of these two regions had to win their own freedom, within the frontiers of an autonomous Macedonian-Adrianople state.

== Legacy ==
=== Cold war period ===
In 1934 the Comintern gave its support to the idea that the Macedonian Slavs constituted a separate nation. Prior to World War II, this view on the Macedonian issue had been of little practical importance. However, during the war these ideas were supported by the pro-Yugoslav Macedonian communist partisans, who strengthened their positions in 1943, referring to the ideals of Gotse Delchev. After the Red Army entered the Balkans in late 1944, new communist regimes came into power in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. In this way their policy on the Macedonian Question was committed to the Comintern policy of supporting the development of a distinct ethnic Macedonian consciousness. The region of Macedonia was proclaimed as the connecting link for the establishment of a future Balkan Communist Federation. The newly established Yugoslav People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia, was characterized as the natural result of Delchev&#x27;s aspirations for autonomous Macedonia.

Initially, the Macedonian communists questioned the extent of Delchev&#x27;s alleged Macedonian national consciousness. Macedonian communist leader Lazar Koliševski proclaimed him as &quot;...one Bulgarian of no significance for the liberation struggles...&quot;. In 1946, communist activist Vasil Ivanovski acknowledged that Delchev did not have a clear view of a &quot;Macedonian national character&quot;, but stated that his struggle made the free and autonomous Macedonia a possibility. On 7 October 1946, under pressure from Moscow, as part of the policy to foster the development of Macedonian national consciousness, Delchev&#x27;s remains were transported to Skopje. On 10 October, the bones were enshrined in a marble sarcophagus in the yard of the church &quot;Sveti Spas&quot;, where they have remained since. Delchev&#x27;s name became part of the anthem of SR Macedonia - &quot;Today over Macedonia&quot;. According to Mishe Karev, a nephew of Nikola Karev, after the Tito–Stalin split in 1948, the Macedonian communist elite discussed the idea of scrapping Delchev&#x27;s name from the anthem of the country and proclaiming him a Bulgarian, but this idea was declined.

After realizing that the Balkan collective memory had already accepted the heroes of the Macedonian revolutionary movement as Bulgarians, Macedonian communist authorities exerted efforts to claim Delchev for the Macedonian national cause. Aiming to enforce the belief that Delchev was an ethnic Macedonian, all documents written by him in standard Bulgarian were translated into standard Macedonian and presented as originals. As a result, Delchev was declared an ethnic Macedonian hero and Macedonian school textbooks began even to hint at Bulgarian complicity in his death. In the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria, before 1960, Delchev was given mostly regional recognition in Pirin Macedonia. Afterwards, orders from the highest political level were given to reincorporate the Macedonian revolutionary movement as part of the Bulgarian historiography and to prove the Bulgarian credentials of its historical leaders. Since 1960, there have been long unproductive debates between the ruling Communist parties in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia about the ethnic affiliation of Delchev. Delchev was described in SR Macedonia not only as an anti-Ottoman freedom fighter, but also as a hero, who had opposed the aggressive aspirations of the pro-Bulgarian factions in the liberation movement. The claims on Delchev&#x27;s Bulgarian self-identification, thus were portrayed as a recent Bulgarian chauvinist attitude of long provenance. Nonetheless, the Bulgarian side made in 1978 for the first time the proposal that some historical personalities (e.g. Gotse Delchev) could be regarded as belonging to the shared historical heritage of the two peoples, but that proposal did not appeal to the Yugoslavs.

=== Post-communism ===

Delchev is regarded in Bulgaria and North Macedonia as a national hero. His ethnic identity has continued to be disputed in North Macedonia, serving as a point of contention with Bulgaria. Some attempts were made for the joint celebration of Delchev between both countries. Bulgarian diplomats were also attacked when honoring Delchev by Macedonian nationalists in 2012. On 2 August 2017, the Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his Macedonian colleague Zoran Zaev placed wreaths at the grave of Delchev on the occasion of the 114th anniversary of the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising. Zaev expressed an interest to negotiate about Delchev. A joint commission on historical issues was also formed in 2018 to resolve controversial historical readings, including the dispute about Delchev&#x27;s ethnic identity, which has been unresolved. The Association of Historians in North Macedonia came out against the calls for a joint celebration of Delchev, seeing them as a threat to Macedonian national identity. Per Macedonian historian Dragi Gjorgiev, the myth of Delchev is so significant among ethnic Macedonians that it is more important than documents, books, and pieces written by historians. Macedonian philosopher Katerina Kolozova opined that Bulgaria should not negotiate regarding his self-identification, seeing him as important for the national myths of Bulgaria and North Macedonia.

Per anthropologist Keith Brown and political scientist Alexis Heraclides, the identity of Delchev and other IMRO figures is &quot;open to different interpretations&quot;, that are incompatible with the views of modern Balkan nationalisms. His memory is honored especially in the Bulgarian part of Macedonia and among the descendants of Bulgarian refugees from other parts of the region, where he has been regarded as one of the greatest revolutionary leaders. His name appears also in the national anthem of North Macedonia: &quot;Denes nad Makedonija&quot; (Today over Macedonia). There are two towns named in his honor: Gotse Delchev in Bulgaria and Delčevo in North Macedonia. There are also two peaks named after Delchev: &quot;Gotsev Vrah&quot;, the summit of Slavyanka Mountain, and &quot;Delchev Vrah&quot; or Delchev Peak on Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands in Antarctica, which was named after him by the scientists from the Bulgarian Antarctic Expedition. The Goce Delčev University of Štip in North Macedonia carries his name too. Many artifacts related to Delchev&#x27;s activity are stored in different museums across Bulgaria and North Macedonia.

During the time of SFR Yugoslavia, a street in Belgrade was named after Delchev. In 2015, Serbian nationalists covered the signs with the street&#x27;s name and affixed new ones with the name of the Chetnik activist Kosta Pećanac. They claimed that Delchev was a Bulgarian and his name has no place there. Though in 2016 the street&#x27;s name was changed officially by the municipal authorities to &quot;Maršal Tolbuhin&quot;. Their motivation was that Delchev was not an ethnic Macedonian revolutionary, but a leader of an anti-Serbian organization with a pro-Bulgarian orientation.

In Greece the official appeals from the Bulgarian side to the authorities to install a memorial plaque on his place of death are not answered. The memorial plaques set periodically by Bulgarians afterwards have been removed. Bulgarian tourists have been restrained occasionally from visiting the place.

On 4 February 2023, on the 151st anniversary of the birth of the revolutionary, both the Macedonian and Bulgarian side paid their respects at the St. Spas Church in Skopje separately, while the delegation of North Macedonia declined the offer to jointly lay wreaths proposed by the Bulgarian delegation. Many Bulgarian citizens who wanted to attend the event were held for hours at the border due to a claimed malfunction of the border system. However, problems with the admission of the Bulgarians continued even after the processing of their documents. As a result, many Bulgarian citizens and journalists were prevented from crossing. Three citizens were detained, fined and banned from entering the country for 3 years, due to attempting to physically assault policemen. According to their lawyer, two of them were apparently beaten. Bulgaria officially reacted sharply to these events.

<text>Listed in the table below are the insignia—emblems of authority—of the British Army. Badges for field officers were introduced in 1810 and the insignia was moved to the epaulettes in 1880. On ceremonial or parade uniforms these ranks continue to be worn on the epaulettes, either as cloth slides or as metal clips, although on the modern &#x27;working dress&#x27; (daily uniform) they are usually worn as a cloth slide on the chest. Although these insignia apply across the British Army there is variation in the precise design and colours used and it can take some time to become familiar with them all.

Officers in the ranks of lieutenant and second lieutenant are often referred to as subalterns and these and captains are also referred to as company officers. Brigadiers, colonels, lieutenant colonels and majors are field officers. All above these are considered to be of general officer rank.

The rank of Field Marshal has become an honorary/ceremonial rank; the last active officer to be promoted to the rank was in 1994.

== History of rank insignia ==

=== General officers ===

Before 1767, there were no definite badges for Field Marshals and general officers. In 1767, the British Army issued an order to distinguish Field Marshals (once the rank was established in 1813) and different graded General officers by the combination of chevron-shaped ess pattern laces on the sleeve.
* Field Marshal: Evenly spaced six laces.
* General: Evenly spaced four laces.
* Lieutenant General: Six laces in threes.
* Major General: Four laces in twos.
* Brigadier General: Three laces. Upper twos were in pair.

During the Napoleonic wars, field marshals wore oak-leaf embroidered collar and cuff; and shoulder cord instead of previous pattern. It was continued until the end of 1830.

At the beginning of 1831, new rank distinction was ordered for field marshals and general officers.
* Field Marshal: Cross baton and wreath designed device was on epaulettes and buttons were evenly spaced .
* General: Cross baton and sword with crown designed device on the epaulettes and buttons were evenly spaced.
* Lieutenant General: Cross baton and sword with crown designed device on the epaulettes and buttons were in threes.
* Major General: Cross baton and sword with crown designed device on the epaulettes and buttons were in twos.
* Brigadier General: No device on the epaulettes and buttons were in two.

After the Crimean War (30 January 1855), the War Office ordered different rank badges for British general, staff officers and regimental officers. It was the first complete set of rank badges to be used by the British Army.
* Field Marshal: Two rows of one inch wide oak-leaf designed lace on the collar with crossed baton above the wreath in silver.
* General: Two rows of one inch wide oak-leaf designed lace on the collar with Crown and star in silver.
* Lieutenant General: Two rows of one inch wide oak-leaf designed lace on the collar with Crown in silver.
* Major General: Two rows of one inch wide oak-leaf designed lace on the collar with Star in silver.
* Brigadier-general: Two rows of half inch wide staff pattern lace on the collar with Crown and star in silver.

In 1868, brigadier-generals were ordered to wear the same collar as other General officers, but no device in the collar.

In 1880, the War Office ordered to move rank badges from collar to shoulder.
* Field Marshal: Crossed batons above the wreath of oak-leaf. On the top of the wreath a crown.
* General: Crossed baton and sword with Crown and star.
* Lieutenant General: Crossed baton and sword with Crown.
* Major General: Crossed baton and sword with Star.
* Brigadier General: Crossed baton and sword.

Due to the expansion of the Army during World War I, there were a very large number of general officers, whose numbers were very disproportionate to the other Allied Armies, and had the effect of reducing the status of all British Generals. There were talks and proposal to address the number of general officers without abolishing the rank, but it was found that this would produce a number of issues and was considered impracticable. In 1920 it was promulgated in Army Order 545 of 1920 to abolish the rank of Brigadier General and substitute in its place the ranks Colonel Commandant (commander of a brigade or training school) and Colonel-on-the-Staff (staff officer, usually appointed Directors, Deputy Director etc. at the War Officer and in India), effective from 1 January 1921. The rank badges of Colonel Commandant and Colonel on the staff were identical to each other, consisting of a crown and three stars. After difficulties arose for those who previously held the rank of brigadier-general; Earl Curzon stated that: &quot;…British Military Attaches at foreign capitals who at present hold the rank of Brigadier-General…will lose precedence and prestige and will have to yield in both respects to foreign officers…&quot;. The Secretary of State refused to make an exception for Military Attaches, on the advice of the Army Council. However, following this, difficulties arose in India, as in the minds of the Indian personnel commanders of brigades had lost prestige, as the term Colonel conveys the command of battalions. In 1926 Formal consent by the King to substitute Colonel Commandant with Brigadier was given, however after further issues were raised, the matter was reopened and on reconsideration it was decided to abolish the title of Colonel-on-the-Staff also. Accordingly, on 1 June 1928, the temporary rank of brigadier was reinstated, and the titles of Colonel Commandant and Colonel-on-the-Staff were abolished. The Army Order stated,&quot;Officers holding the temporary rank of brigadier will have precedence of, and command over all other colonels. Among them- selves they will take precedence according to their permanent rank. They will wear the same dress (including rank badges) as at present prescribed for colonels commandant and colonels on the staff.&quot;Brigadiers have held the same rank insignia, of the Colonel Commandant and Colonels-on-the-Staff since 1928.

=== Regimental officers ===
Initially company and field rank insignia did not appear on officers&#x27; uniforms. In 1791 the War Office ordered officers to wear different graded epaulettes and wings to distinguish regimental officer ranks (Colonel to Ensign/ Cornet). This was ordered only for line infantry officers. According to the Army Order, 
* Field officers (Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel and Major) wore epaulettes on both shoulders. 
* Company officers (Captain, Captain-Lieutenant, Lieutenant and Ensign / 2nd Lieutenant) of centre companies wore a single epaulette on right shoulder only. 
* Grenadier and Light companies Captain and Subalterns wore wings on both shoulders.

In 1795, a special pattern of epaulettes was ordered for Fusiliers and Light Infantry officers. Field officers of those regiments wore epaulettes over wings. Company officers wore wings.

In February 1810, an order was issued by the War Office to distinguish Field officer ranks. The following devices were introduced in the epaulettes:
* Colonel: Crown and Garter star 
* Lieutenant Colonel: Crown
* Major: Garter star

These badges were issued for all infantry regiments except the Foot Guards. In 1815, badges for Foot Guards were ordered. In Foot Guards regiments, all Field Officers were equivalent to the Colonels of line infantry regiments. Captains were equivalent to Lieutenant Colonels, Lieutenants were equivalent to Majors and Ensigns were equivalent to Captains of Battalion companies.
* Field Officers: Crown and star (Grenadier Guards and Coldstream Guards used the Garter star, and Scots Fusilier Guards used the Thistle star).
* Captain: Crown
* Lieutenant: Star
* Ensign: No device. (Ensigns of the Grenadier Guards wore epaulettes on both shoulders, but the Ensigns of the other two regiments wore a single epaulette on the right shoulder.)

In 1829, epaulettes and wings were standardised by maintaining the badges of rank issued in 1810 and 1815. According to the order, epaulettes of all regular infantry regiments and foot guards regiments would be in gold and other regiments were in silver. All officers including field and company officers wore epaulettes and wings on both shoulders. The epaulettes over wings system was abolished. Different graded officer wore different sized bullion to distinguish themselves from other.
* Colonel: Epaulette bullions were three and half inches in length. Insignia was a Crown and a Bath star.
* Lieutenant Colonel: Epaulette bullions were three and half inches in length. Insignia was a Crown.
* Major: Epaulette bullions were three inches in length. Insignia was a Bath star.
* Captain of Battalion company: Epaulette bullion were two and half inches in length. No insignia device.
* Subaltern of Battalion company: Epaulette bullion were two inches in length. No insignia device.
* Captain of Flank companies: Wings bullions were one and quarter inches in length and half inches in wide.
* Subalterns of Flank companies: Wings bullions were one and quarter inches in length and quarter inches in wide.

In January 1855, at the end of the Crimean War, the War Office abolished all epaulette and wing rank badges. New rank badges were introduced in the collar. It was first time that a complete set of rank badges was used by the British Army.
* Colonel: Two rows of half inch laces in collar with Crown and Bath star.
* Lieutenant Colonel: Two rows of half inch laces in collar with Crown.
* Major: Two rows of half inch laces in collar with Bath star. 
* Captain: One row of half inch lace on the top of collar with Crown and Bath star.
* Lieutenant: One row of half inch lace on the top of collar with Crown.
* Ensign/Sub Lieutenant: One row of half inch lace on the top of collar with Bath star.

In April 1880, rank badges were moved from collar to shoulder and officers of all regiments wore the following rank badges.
* Colonel: Crown and two Bath stars.
* Lieutenant Colonel: Crown and one Bath star.
* Major: Crown.
* Captain: Two Bath stars.
* Lieutenant: One Bath star.
* Second Lieutenant: No device.
In May 1902, rank badges were moved to sleeve&#x27;s cuff and company-grade officer badges were slightly modified:
* Captain: Three Bath stars.
* Lieutenant: Two Bath stars.
* Second Lieutenant: One Bath star.

In 1919, a new order was issued by the Horse Guards office—all Guards officers would wear special star badges. 
* Grenadier Guards: Garter star.
* Coldstream Guards: Garter star.
* Scots Guards: Thistle star.
* Irish Guards: Shamrock star
* Welsh Guards: Garter star.

During World War I, some officers took to wearing tunics with the rank badges on the shoulder, as the cuff badges made them too conspicuous to snipers. This practice was frowned on outside the trenches but was given official sanction in 1917 as an optional alternative, being made permanent in 1920, when the cuff badges were abolished.

=== Historical insignia ===

== Historical ranks ==
* Captain-general (c. 17th century): a full general.
* Sergeant-major-general (c. 17th century): shortened to major general.
* (Lieutenant-)Colonel Commandant (c. 19th century): most senior commanding rank in artillery bataillons and regiments, but sometimes also in cavalry (especially when the latter was stationed in India).
* Captain-lieutenant (c. 17th &amp; 18th century): the lieutenant of the first company in a regiment, whose captaincy was held by the regimental colonel. On promotion to full captain, the period in this rank was treated as having been a full captain for pay and pension purposes, since he effectively commanded the company.
* Ensign: lowest subaltern rank in infantry regiments; replaced in 1871 by second lieutenant, but still used to refer to second lieutenants in some Guards regiments.
* Cornet: cavalry equivalent of ensign replaced in 1871 by second lieutenant, but still used to refer to second lieutenants in some cavalry regiments, including the Blues and Royals and The Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars.

<text>&quot;Other ranks&quot; (ORs) is the term used to refer to all ranks below officers in the British Army and the Royal Marines. It includes warrant officers, non-commissioned officers (&quot;NCOs&quot;) and ordinary soldiers with the rank of private or regimental equivalent. Officers may, in speaking, distinguish themselves from those &quot;in the ranks&quot;.

== History ==

During the 18th century corporals might indicate their ranks with a knot with cord loops on their right shoulder and, from 1768, an epaulette instead. Sergeants had clothing that was of slightly better quality and wore lace trim on their hats and uniforms. Infantry sergeants were armed with fusils (grenadier companies, from 1769), halberds or, from 1792 until 1830, with spontoons. They, as well as their counterparts in cavalry and artillery, were also permitted sashes of crimson wool, with a single stripe of facing colour following the clothing regulations of 1727. Whereas it remained vague as to whether the sash was to be worn over the shoulder or around the waist, it was clarified in 1747 that sergeants had to wear their sashes around the waist. From 1768, the sergeant&#x27;s waist sash had stripes of facing colour one (until 1825) resp. three (until 1845); in regiments with red or purple facings the sergeant&#x27;s sash had white stripes or remained plain crimson. Sergeants of highland regiments wore their sashes over the left shoulder and tied at the right hip in the same manner as the officers. Beginning from the same year, sergeants wore a pair of silk epaulettes with fringe while sergeant-majors had a pair of gold or silver laced epaulettes with bullion fringe.

The chevrons worn by many non-commissioned officers are based on heraldic devices and their current use originates from 1802. As today, sergeants wore three chevrons, point downwards, on the upper arm, and corporals wore two, with sergeant-majors and quarter-master-sergeants then having four. Whereas corporals and sergeants discarded their silk epaulettes by now, sergeant-majors continued to wear their metal epaulettes along with their new chevrons for a while. Lance corporal, at the time, not a rank but an appointment is historically known as &quot;chosen man&quot; and carrying extra pay for privates holding it, were given a single chevron a few years later, and later in the century, the lance-sergeant appeared, wearing three chevrons. The infantry rank of colour sergeant was created in 1813 as a reward for senior sergeants with one allowed per company. He was allowed to wear a badge consisting of a regimental colour supported by two crossed swords. All insignia were worn on the right sleeve.

The Royal Artillery had the special rank of bombardier below the corporal, and both he and the acting bombardier wore one chevron. The Royal Engineers and Army Ordnance Corps also had an additional rank of second corporal, who wore one chevron. On full-dress tunics, badges in white or gold lace were worn only on the right arm, but on service dress jackets, badges in worsted embroidery were worn on both arms. In February 1918 the acting bombardier was renamed lance-bombardier, and the full bombardier gained a second chevron in 1920 replacing the rank of corporal in the RA. Second corporals also disappeared at that time (the second corporal had been an actual rank, whereas lance-corporal was private acting in the rank of corporal).

The pre-war infantry rank of colour sergeant had generally given way to the ranks of company sergeant-major and quartermaster-sergeant in 1914 when the four-company organization was introduced. Both of these ranks, their squadron, and battery equivalents, and staff-sergeants in other arms, wore three chevrons and a crown, although, in 1915 company, battery, squadron, and troop sergeant-majors became warrant officers class II (by Army Order 70) and thereafter wore a single large crown, without any chevrons, on each forearm. The designation of warrant officer classes was in Roman rather than Arabic numerals until the latter half of the 20th century.

Regimental quartermaster-sergeants wore four chevrons on the lower sleeve, point upwards, with an eight-pointed star above, but adopted the crown when they too became warrant officers class II in 1915. In their case, however, the crown was surrounded by a wreath. Regimental sergeant-majors, who before the Boer War had worn four chevrons with a crown, were given in 1902 the badge of a single large crown on the lower arm but adopted a small version of the Royal arms in its place in 1915 when they became warrant officers class I.

Certain senior grades of warrant officer were also peculiar to the specialist branches, which ranked above regimental sergeant-majors. These were the conductors of the Army Ordnance Corps and the first-class staff sergeant-majors of the Army Service Corps and the Army Pay Corps. They also wore a large crown, surrounded by a wreath, on the lower arm, although in 1918 this was replaced by the Royal Arms within a wreath. The RA also had its master gunners in three classes, but these were technical specialists and not normally seen in the field. The Royal Arms within a wreath is the badge of rank for a conductor, the most senior of all WO1 appointments, confined to the Royal Logistic Corps and held by fewer than twenty people as of 2004.

From 1938, there was also a rank of warrant officer class III. The only appointments held by this rank were platoon sergeant major, troop sergeant major, and section sergeant major. The WOIII wore a crown on his lower sleeve. The rank was placed in suspension in 1940 and no new appointments were made, but it was never officially abolished. From 1938 to 1947 all WOII ranks wore the crown in wreath rank now worn by regimental quartermaster sergeants.

The grades of lance-sergeant and lance-corporal were not strictly ranks but were appointments, held by selected corporals and privates, and usually carrying extra pay. The appointment was made by the man&#x27;s commanding officer and could be taken away by him for disciplinary reasons, unlike full sergeants and corporals who could only be demoted by order of a court-martial. It is only since 1961 that lance-corporal has been a separate rank in its own right, and the appointment of lance-sergeant was discontinued in 1946, except in the Foot Guards and Honourable Artillery Company (and its equivalent, lance-corporal of the horse, in the Household Cavalry).

== Ranks ==
=== General rank information ===
== Variants ==
As most units in the British Army have long traditions (some dating as far back as the 1600s) some variation has developed in the terminology and insignia used for non-commissioned ranks, most notably in the Foot Guards and Household Cavalry. Many units do not use the rank &quot;Private&quot;, using instead:

* &quot;Trooper&quot; in many regiments with a cavalry tradition and in the Special Air Service
* &quot;Airtrooper&quot; in the Army Air Corps
* &quot;Sapper&quot; in the Royal Engineers
* &quot;Craftsman&quot; in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers
* &quot;Guardsman&quot; in the Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards, Scots Guards, Irish Guards, Welsh Guards and the London Guards
* &quot;Gunner&quot; in the Royal Artillery and Royal Horse Artillery
* &quot;Fusilier&quot; in the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, Royal Welsh and The Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland
* &quot;Rifleman&quot; in The Rifles and the Royal Gurkha Rifles 
* &quot;Kingsman&quot; in the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment
* &quot;Signaller&quot; in the Royal Signals
* &quot;Ranger&quot; in the Royal Irish Regiment, London Irish Rifles and the Ranger Regiment
* &quot;Highlander&quot; in The Highlanders, 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland
* &quot;Drummer&quot;, &quot;Trumpeter&quot;, &quot;Bugler&quot;, &quot;Piper&quot; and &quot;Musician&quot; in various military bands and musicians in other units

The Royal Artillery and RHA also use the ranks Lance Bombardier and Bombardier instead of Lance Corporal and Corporal, while The Rifles use the spelling &quot;Serjeant&quot; in place of &quot;Sergeant&quot;.

=== Foot Guards and Honourable Artillery Company ===


=== Household Cavalry ===
The Household Cavalry maintains the old cavalry tradition of having no rank of sergeant, which was originally an infantry rank only. It has its own peculiar set of insignia and ranks with the following equivalents:

Similarly, warrant officer appointments are different, with, for example, &quot;regimental corporal major&quot; being used in place of regimental sergeant major. Uniquely, NCOs and warrant officers of the Household Cavalry do not wear any insignia on their full dress uniforms (although officers do). Rank is indicated by a system of aiguillettes.

=== Cavalry regiments ===
In several cavalry regiments including the 1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards and the Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars, NCOs holding the rank of lance corporal wear two stripes. Full corporals are distinguished by the addition of a cypher above their two stripes in dress uniforms.

Staff sergeants in an appointment as squadron quartermaster sergeant in the cavalry, sometimes wear four stripes with a crown and are referred to as &quot;sergeant major&quot;. The term &quot;mister&quot; is confined to WO2s.

== Spelling ==
The spelling &quot;serjeant&quot; is sometimes seen. This was the official spelling in the British Army and Royal Marines, although not the Royal Air Force, until the 1930s and appeared in such publications as King&#x27;s Regulations and the Pay Warrant, which defined the various ranks. In common usage, the modern spelling &quot;sergeant&quot; was already more usual, as in the volumes of the Official History which began to appear in the 1920s. Serjeant-at-Arms is a title still held by members of the security staff in the Houses of Parliament. The old spelling is also retained by The Rifles, as successor to the Royal Green Jackets and The Light Infantry, which also used it.

== Timeline of changes ==

== Historical ranks ==
* Sergeant-major: equivalent to the current regimental sergeant major, a warrant officer class 1
* Company sergeant-major: now an appointment of warrant officer class 2
* Quartermaster sergeant: can now be a regimental quartermaster sergeant (warrant officer class 2) or a company quartermaster sergeant (staff sergeant). In the technical corps, a WO2 can also be an AQMS (Artificer Quartermaster Sergeant), TQMS (Technical ...), or SQMS (Squadron ... )
* Warrant officer class III: a short-lived rank used between 1938 and 1940, holding the appointment of platoon sergeant major, troop sergeant major, or section sergeant major.
* Colour sergeant: gave way to staff sergeant over the years before the First World War although colour sergeant exists today in the Royal Marines, equivalent to a staff sergeant in the Army, and is still used to refer to all staff sergeants in infantry regiments and the Honourable Artillery Company.
* Lance sergeant: appointment originally given to corporals acting in the rank of sergeant, discontinued in 1946 except in the Foot Guards, Honourable Artillery Company, and some cadet units.
* Second corporal: Royal Engineers and Army Ordnance Corps rank until 1920, equivalent to lance-corporal but a substantive instead of an acting rank.
* Bombardier: until 1920, when it became equivalent to corporal, a rank in the Royal Artillery equivalent to a second corporal.
* Acting bombardier: appointment originally given to a Royal Artillery gunner acting in the rank of bombardier, discontinued in 1918 and replaced by lance-bombardier.
* Chosen man: was a rank primarily found in the Rifle Brigade denoting a marksman and/or leadership material. Became lance corporal in the early 19th century.

<doc id="870373" wikidata="Q1403157" url="?curid=870373" title="WMS Industries">
<text>WMS Industries, Inc. was an American electronic gaming and amusement manufacturer in Enterprise, Nevada. It was merged into Scientific Games in 2016. WMS&#x27;s predecessor was the Williams Manufacturing Company, founded in 1943 by Harry E. Williams. However, the company that became WMS Industries was formally founded in 1974 as Williams Electronics, Inc.

Williams initially was a manufacturer of pinball machines. In 1964, Williams was acquired by jukebox manufacturer Seeburg Corp. and reorganized as Williams Electronics Manufacturing Division. In 1973, the company branched out into the coin-operated arcade video game market with its &quot;Pong&quot; clone &quot;Paddle Ball&quot;, eventually creating a number of video game classics, including &quot;Defender&quot;, &quot;Joust&quot;, and &quot;.&quot; In 1974, Williams Electronics, Inc. was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Seeburg, which changed its name to Xcor International in 1977. Williams Electronics was spun out as an independent company in 1981.

In 1987, the company went public as WMS Industries, Inc. using a shortened version of its name which it also selected for its stock ticker symbol. In 1988, it acquired Bally/Midway, the amusement games division of Bally Manufacturing, which had decided to focus on its casino operating and manufacturing businesses. The video game operations were consolidated under the Midway name, while pinball machines continued to use the Williams and Bally names. After a string of arcade successes by Midway, WMS acquired Tradewest in 1994 to allow the company to publish its own home ports of arcade games directly, instead of licensing them to other publishers. Midway Games was taken public in 1996, and fully spun-off in 1998.

WMS created a subsidiary, WMS Gaming, for manufacturing gambling equipment in 1991. Beginning with video lottery terminals, the division introduced its first slot machines in 1994 and became a major player in the business. It closed its pinball division on October 25, 1999 after the Pinball 2000 concept that integrated a PC screen into the pinball game via a semi-reflective glass failed to meet sales expectations. In 2013, WMS became a wholly owned subsidiary of Scientific Games. In 2016, WMS was merged into Scientific Games, which renamed itself Light &amp; Wonder in 2022.

==Early history==

Stanford engineering graduate Harry Williams entered the coin-operated amusement industry in 1933 and helped popularize several important pinball innovations such as the tilt mechanism, electrically-powered scoring holes, and the ability to win a free play by achieving a certain score. After working for a succession of companies including Pacific Amusement Manufacturing, Rock-Ola, and Exhibit Supply, he went into business with Lyndon Durant in 1942 under the name United Manufacturing. After a break with Durant, Williams founded the Williams Manufacturing Company in 1943 at 161 West Huron Street in Chicago, Illinois. The first seven products were a fortune-telling machine called &quot;Selector Scope&quot; (1944), two electro-mechanical (EM) games, &quot;Periscope&quot; (1944) and &quot;Liberator&quot; (1944), a novelty called &quot;Zingo&quot; (1944), a pinball conversion called &quot;Flat-Top&quot; (1945), another EM arcade game, &quot;Circus Romance&quot; (1945) and a second pinball conversion called &quot;Laura&quot; (1945). The two pinball conversions (Flat-Top &amp; Laura) were built by purchasing older pinball machines made by other companies and changing artwork and other elements on the playfield. The lack of raw materials during World War II made the manufacture of new machines difficult and expensive. The first all original amusement device made by Williams was a flipperless pinball machine called &quot;Suspense&quot; (1946). During the late 1940s and early 1950s, Williams continued to make pinball machines and the occasional bat-and-ball game. In 1950, Williams produced &quot;Lucky Inning&quot;, their first pinball machine to have its bottom flippers facing inward in the modern manner.

In 1948, Williams sold 49% of his company to a Philadelphia distributor named Sam Stern, who became a vice president and took over much of the day-to-day running of the company. In 1959, Stern orchestrated a buyout of Williams by Consolidated Sun Ray, a New York retail conglomerate that operated drug stores and discount houses, which renamed the company the Williams Electronic Manufacturing Corporation. Harry Williams left after the buyout, though did occasional work for the company. The last game he designed for Williams was also one of the last electromechanical games, &quot;Rancho&quot; (1977).

In 1961, Stern bought Williams back from Consolidated Sun Ray. Three years later, the company was acquired by the Seeburg Corporation, which also purchased United Manufacturing. The two amusement companies were consolidated under the Williams name, but moved into the United factory. Sam Stern continued to run the amusement business, which was renamed Williams Electronics in 1967.

In 1962, &quot;3 Coin&quot; became the best selling Williams machine with 1,100 units sold. One year later, &quot;Skill Pool&quot; sold 2,250 units. In 1964 Williams was purchased by the Seeburg Corporation. Its 1966 pinball machine &quot;A-Go-Go&quot;, with its avant-garde 60s theme, sold a record 5,100 units. Early Williams pinball machines often included innovative features and pinball firsts, such as mechanical reel scoring and the &quot;add-a-ball&quot; feature for locations that didn&#x27;t allow game replays. By 1967, pinball was in the middle of its so-called &quot;golden age&quot;, and the number of pinball units that sold began to increase dramatically. Popular Williams pinballs included &quot;Shangri-La&quot; (1967), &quot;Apollo&quot; (1967), &quot;Beat Time&quot; (1967), &quot;Smart Set&quot; (1969), &quot;Gold Rush&quot; (1971), and &quot;Space Mission&quot; (1976).

==Golden age of arcade games==
Taking note of Atari, Inc.&#x27;s success with &quot;Pong&quot; in 1972, Williams decided to enter the fledgling coin-operated arcade video game industry. After preliminary negotiations with Magnavox, it subcontracted the Magnetic Corporation of America to create its first arcade video game &quot;Paddle-Ball&quot;. In 1974, the company was reincorporated as Williams Electronics, Inc. In 1980, Seeburg, facing bankruptcy, sold Williams to Louis Nicastro, who, with his son Neil, would take the company public and run it for over two decades.

Williams developed its own breakthrough hit with the release of 1981&#x27;s &quot;Defender&quot;, whose gameplay, horizontal scrolling, and dynamic color influenced many subsequent games. It was followed by a sequel in the same year, &quot;Stargate&quot;, and a group of popular and influential titles: &quot;Joust&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Sinistar&quot;, and the licensed &quot;Moon Patrol&quot;. With the exception of &quot;Sinistar&quot;, these were widely ported to home systems by external developers and publishers including Atari.

After &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; popularized LaserDisc video games in 1983, Williams created the LaserDisc/computer graphics hybrid racing game &quot;Star Rider&quot; which lost, or contributed to a loss of, $50 million for the company.

In 1988, Williams acquired Bally/Midway, the consolidated amusement games subsidiary of longtime competitor Bally Manufacturing, which left the business to concentrate on casinos. Midway saw strong sales in the early 1990s with a number of successful arcade games, including &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and &quot;NBA Jam&quot;. In 1994, the company acquired Tradewest, which it renamed Williams Entertainment, to publish home ports of Midway arcade games. Two years later, WMS acquired Atari Games from Time Warner. That same year, all video game operations were consolidated under Midway, with Atari Games becoming Midway Games West and Williams Entertainment becoming Midway Home Entertainment, while all pinball rights remained with WMS under the Williams brand.

==Solid state pinball==
Williams&#x27; first solid-state machines produced in 1976 were prototype runs based on electromechanical games; &quot;Aztec&quot; (1976) and &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. Williams continued to release new electromechanical pinball machines through October 1977, when they released their last, &quot;Wild Card&quot;. From November 1977, Williams released solid-state pinball games exclusively, beginning with their first solid state production model &quot;Hot Tip&quot; (1977), which sold 4,903 units (the electromechanical version previously released in June sold 1,300 units). From the late 1970s through the 1980s, Williams released numerous innovative pinball games, such as &quot;Gorgar&quot; (1979, the first pinball featuring a synthetic voice), &quot;Firepower&quot; (1980), &quot;Black Knight&quot; (1980, the first featuring multiple levels), &quot;Jungle Lord&quot; (1981), &quot;Space Shuttle&quot; (1984), &quot;Comet&quot; (1985), &quot;High Speed&quot; (1986), &quot;Pin*Bot&quot; (1986), &quot;F-14 Tomcat&quot; (1987), &quot;Cyclone&quot; (1988), and &quot;Taxi&quot; (1988).

From 1989 through the mid 1990s, a resurgence of pinball during which machines transitioned to dot-matrix displays, Williams had a string of hits including &quot;Black Knight 2000&quot;, &quot;FunHouse&quot;, &quot;The Machine: Bride of Pin-Bot&quot;, &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, &quot;Fish Tales&quot;, and &quot;The Getaway: High Speed II&quot;.

In 1992, the company produced the licensed &quot;The Addams Family&quot; pinball game based on &quot;The Addams Family&quot; movie (1991) under the Bally label. &quot;The Addams Family&quot; sold 20,270 units, a record that still stands today. In 1993, the company produced &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, which sold 15,235 units. After 1993, though still the market leader, Williams never came close to matching these sales numbers. Williams won the American Amusement Machine Association&#x27;s 1995 Manufacturer of the Year award. &quot;Medieval Madness&quot;, produced in 1997, often tops the list as the greatest pinball machine of all time.

In 1999, Williams made one last attempt to revitalize pinball sales with its &quot;Pinball 2000&quot; machines that integrated pinball with computer graphics on embedded raster-scan displays. The innovation did not pay off, as the manufacturing expenses exceeded the prices that the market would bear, and that same year, WMS left pinball to focus on slot machine development.

==Focus on gambling machines==
As the pinball industry declined, WMS invested in the hotel industry, successfully taking public and then spinning off its hotel subsidiary, WHG Resorts, in 1996 (which was later taken private and acquired by Wyndham International).

===First slot machines===
WMS entered the reel-spinning slot machine market in 1994, and its products have helped to move the industry trend away from generic mechanical slot machines and toward games that incorporate familiar intellectual properties. For more than a century beginning in the late 1800s, mechanical slot machine reels employed limited themes: card suits, horseshoes, bells and stars, varieties of fruit, black bars and the Liberty Bell. WMS&#x27;s video gaming roots would prove to be its strength when, in 1996, it introduced its first hit casino slot machine, &quot;Reel &#x27;em In&quot;, a &quot;multi-line, multi-coin secondary bonus&quot; video slot machine. WMS followed this with a number of similar successful games like &quot;Jackpot Party&quot;, &quot;Boom&quot; and &quot;Filthy Rich&quot;. Meanwhile, by 1996, WMS had transferred all of the copyrights and trademarks in its video game library to Midway, including &quot;Defender&quot;, &quot;Stargate&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Joust&quot; and &quot;Smash TV&quot;, as it took Midway public and finally spun it off in 1998. With the closing of its pinball division in 1999, WMS focused entirely on the gaming machine industry. During the 1990s, that industry grew as additional states permitted casino gambling and video lottery games and as Native American tribes built gaming casinos.

By 2001, WMS introduced its very successful &quot;Monopoly&quot;-themed series of &quot;participation&quot; slots, which the company licenses or leases to casinos, instead of selling the games to the casinos. The company&#x27;s participation games have included machines based on such well-known entertainment-related brands as &quot;Men in Black&quot;, &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, Clint Eastwood, &quot;Powerball&quot;, &quot;Green Acres&quot;, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, &quot;Top Gun&quot;, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Clue&quot;. Some of these games are networked within casinos and even between multiple casinos so that players have a chance to win large jackpots based on the total amount of play received by all of the machines in the network. These branded games proved popular with players and profitable for WMS, as the net licensing revenues and lease fees generated by each game have exceeded the profit margins of its games for sale. Other recent games include &quot;Brazilian Beauty&quot; and &quot;Hot Hot Super Jackpot&quot;. WMS Industries acquired a second subsidiary, Netherlands-based gaming company Orion Financement Company B.V., in July 2006.

From fiscal year 2006 to 2011 the company&#x27;s revenues grew from $451 million to $783 million, respectively, and its net income reached $113 million in 2010. The company&#x27;s revenues decreased to $690 million in 2012.

=== Later products, technology, business ===
WMS continued to produce video gaming machines and, to a smaller extent, reel-spinning slots, for sale and for lease to casinos in the U.S., selected foreign markets and state lotteries. Some of WMS&#x27;s product designs reflected the changing demographics of its industry. Younger players raised on video games often seek more challenging experiences, both physical and mental, than do women age 55 to 65 – the traditional audience for slot machines. Accordingly, some of the company&#x27;s machines incorporate surround sound, flat-panel display screens and animated, full-color images.

WMS also manufactured the G+ series of video reel slots, the Community Gaming family of interconnected slots, as well as mechanical reels, poker games, and video lottery terminals. WMS began to offer online gaming in 2010 to persons over 18 years old in the UK and in 2011 in the US at www.jackpotparty.com. In 2012, WMS partnered with Large Animal Games to incorporate several of WMS&#x27;s slot machine games into a cruise ship-themed Facebook game application titled &quot;Lucky Cruise&quot;. By playing games and enlisting Facebook friends&#x27; help, players can accumulate &quot;lucky charms&quot; (instead of money). The game play is similar to playing a slot machine but includes a &quot;light strategy component&quot;. In 2012, the company introduced gaming on mobile devices and focused its efforts on expanding its online game offerings. For casinos, it introduced &quot;My Poker&quot; video poker games.

WMS technologies included:
* Transmissive Reels gaming platform, which employs video animation that is displayed around, over and seemingly interactively with mechanical reels. The technology is based on the CPU-NXT2 operating platform.
* Operating Platforms: CPU-NXT2 incorporates an Intel Pentium IV class processor, up to 2 gigabytes of random-access memory, an ATI 3-D graphics chip-set, and a 40 gigabyte hard disk drive. The CPU-NXT3 operating platform was introduced in 2012 for participation games and new cabinets.
* Cabinets: The Bluebird2 gaming cabinet, which includes a dual 22-inch widescreen, high-definition displays, Bose speakers, and an illuminated printer and bill acceptor, was introduced in 2008. The Blade and Gamefield xD cabinets were introduced in 2013.

Approximately 70% of WMS&#x27;s revenues in 2010 were derived from U.S. customers. Its design facilities at the time were in Chicago, Illinois. It had other facilities and offices across the United States and international development and distribution facilities located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, China, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Africa, Spain and the United Kingdom and an online gaming center in Belgium.

===Williams Interactive===
In 2012, WMS acquired Sweden-based Jadestone Group AB and then Iowa-based Phantom EFX, which, later that year, became part of a new subsidiary, Williams Interactive. The subsidiary was formed to serve the online gaming industry. At the same time, the company launched its Facebook social casino game Jackpot Party Casino. Later that year, Betsson and Unibet online casinos entered multi-year agreements with Williams Interactive to provide &quot;premium video slot games as Jackpot Party, Zeus or Reel &#x27;Em In ... to their registered players (more than 12 million customers)&quot;. In 2014, EveryMatrix, partnered with Williams Interactive to offer online slot content from Williams Interactive.

== Acquisition by Scientific Games ==
WMS merged with Scientific Games in October 2013, becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Scientific Games. Scientific Games paid $1.5 billion for WMS, and WMS shareholders received $26.00 per share. The following year, Scientific Games also acquired Bally Technologies, the successor to the original Bally Manufacturing&#x27;s slot machine operations. In 2016, WMS was reorganized and fully merged into Scientific Games. In 2022, Scientific Games spun off its namesake lottery terminal operations and took the name Light &amp; Wonder. WMS is retained as a brand of L&amp;W, along with Bally and Shuffle Master.

<doc id="870375" wikidata="Q5147398" url="?curid=870375" title="Collins River">
<text>The Collins River is a stream in the east-central portion of Middle Tennessee in the United States. It is a tributary of the Caney Fork, and is part of the Cumberland, Ohio and Mississippi watersheds. The river drains the scenic Savage Gulf area, located just below the river&#x27;s source, and empties into Great Falls Lake at Rock Island State Park.

The Collins River passes through Grundy and Warren counties. McMinnville, Altamont, Gruetli-Laager and Beersheba Springs are among the communities located within its watershed. The Savage Gulf section of the Collins River has been designated a &quot;scenic river&quot; by the State of Tennessee.

==Course==

The Collins River rises near the town of Palmer atop the Cumberland Plateau, where the Middle Prong Collins River (which descends from a nearby ridge) joins Mill Creek (which flows northward from Palmer). Flowing northwestwardly, the Collins passes under State Route 399 (Barkertown Road) before entering Savage Gulf, a scenic gorge where the river gradually descends 800 feet to the Highland Rim. The town of Beersheba Springs straddles the edge of the Plateau overlooking the river valley. State Route 56 crosses the Collins twice as it follows the river&#x27;s valley out of the gorge.

Crossing into Warren County, the river veers northward along a meandering route, passing under State Route 8 (Harrison Ferry Road) and State Route 127 (Shellsford Road). Just east of McMinnville, the river absorbs its key tributary, Barren Fork, and passes under U.S. Route 70S. After winding its way northward for several miles, the river eventually turns eastward, passing under State Route 288 (Hennessee Bridge Road) as it enters the slack waters of Great Falls Lake.

At Rock Island State Park, the river enters an oxbow bend, nearly joining the Caney Fork before abruptly turning southward, then eastward, then northward again before finally emptying into the Caney Fork just upstream from Great Falls Dam. The oxbow creates a peninsula that contains much of the state park. Two bridges — an older truss bridge no longer in use, and a newer bridge that carries State Route 287 — cross the mouth of the Collins River.

==Watershed==

The Collins River watershed covers , and drains parts of Warren, Grundy, Van Buren, Sequatchie, Coffee, and Cannon counties. The watershed contains of streams and 69 lake acres. Over half the watershed is forested, and just over a third is used for either pastures or row crops.

The upper parts of the river along the Cumberland Plateau flow along Pennsylvanian-era siltstone, shale and sandstone. Along the river&#x27;s Highland Rim portion, Mississippian-era limestone is more common. Karst features such as sinkholes and caves are not uncommon in this area. One of the state&#x27;s largest caves, Cumberland Caverns, is located within the Collins watershed.

The Barren Fork empties into the Collins east of McMinnville. Other tributaries include Big Creek and Savage Creek, which join the river at Savage Gulf, Hills Creek and Scott Creek, which empty into the Collins just north of the Warren-Grundy line, and Charles Creek, which empties into the river downstream from McMinnville.

==History==
During the late 18th century, the Old Kentucky Road, which roughly followed an old Indian path, crossed the Collins River at Shells Ford, near modern McMinnville. A string of other commonly used fords were located just above the mouth of the river, including Flat Shoals Ford, near modern Campaign. Reed&#x27;s Ferry, later known as Black&#x27;s Ferry, operated near the modern U.S. Highway 70S crossing throughout much of the 19th century.

In the late 19th century, businessman Asa Faulkner constructed a wooden bridge across the mouth of the river as part of his Falls City development. Around 1900, Warren County built four bridges over the river: the Hennessee Bridge (approximately 8 miles above the river&#x27;s mouth), the Lusk Bridge (near McMinnville), and Martin&#x27;s Ferry Bridge and Harrison&#x27;s Ferry Bridge, both located on the upper part of the river. A flood in late March 1902 destroyed Faulkner&#x27;s bridge and two of the county&#x27;s bridges– the Hennessee and the Lusk– along with bridges over Barren Fork and Charles Creek.

The Tennessee Electric Power Company built the truss bridge which still spans the mouth of the river as part of its Great Falls Dam project in 1916, and rebuilt and raised the bridge in the mid-1920s. The current vehicle bridge, which runs adjacent to the truss bridge, was built by the Tennessee Department of Transportation in the 1980s.

==Recreation==

Most of the Collins River was designated a &quot;scenic river&quot; as part of the state&#x27;s Scenic Rivers Program. The lower of the river were removed from this designation in 1983, however, and the scenic designation now applies only to the upper parts of the river at Savage Gulf.

A scientific state natural area now protects the Savage Gulf area. This area is also part of South Cumberland State Park. The Collins Gulf Trail at Savage Gulf follows a portion of the river as it descends from the Cumberland Plateau.

The lower portion of the Collins River is part of Great Falls Lake, the reservoir created by Great Falls Dam near the river&#x27;s confluence with the Caney Fork. The oxbow peninsula between the Collins and Caney Fork is part of Rock Island State Park. Part of the Collins River Trail, maintained by the park, passes along the wooded embankment above the shore of the river along this peninsula.

The Collins River is one of the few rivers in Tennessee with a good population of muskie (muskellunge). Muskie were stocked in various watersheds throughout Tennessee, including the Collins River from 1982 through 2006.

<text>USS &quot;La Vallette&quot; (DD-448) was a World War II-era in the service of the United States Navy. She was the second Navy ship named after Rear Admiral Elie A. F. La Vallette.

&quot;La Vallette&quot; was laid down 27 November 1941 by Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Kearny, New Jersey; launched 21 June 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Lucy La Vallette Littel, great-granddaughter of Rear Admiral LaVallette; and commissioned 12 August 1942.

==History==
After training and escort duty in the Caribbean and Atlantic, &quot;La Vallette&quot; departed New York 16 December 1942 for the Panama Canal and Pacific duty.

===Battle of Rennell Island===

Her first contact with the enemy came on 29 January 1943, at about 19:00 when she sighted a formation of 11 to 13 Japanese bombers, in three close formation sections 12 miles west of her position. The aircraft were identified as &quot;Bettys&quot; carrying out strafing and torpedo runs. One torpedo was reported as passing astern and the USS was hit by two torpedoes, causing heavy damage and bringing her to a dead stop, necessitating her being taken in tow. &quot;La Vallette&quot; claimed to have shot down three aircraft using her 5-inch guns.

The following day, the damaged &quot;Chicago&quot;, was attacked again, 34 miles south of Rennell Island by a group of 11 Bettys at an altitude of 500 feet, from the ship&#x27;s port beam. The starboard section of aircraft attacked &quot;La Vallette&quot;, two aircraft were claimed shot-down and her 20mm and 40mm guns had three aircraft approaching from the starboard section under fire, two of which passed over the ship in flames. Five others passed about 600 yards from her port side, with two more reported to be on fire. Five torpedoes were dropped and as the ship swung left, a torpedo hit the destroyer in her forward engine room, killing 22 of her crew and causing heavy damage. The USS Chicago was sunk, as a result of four more torpedo hits.

Following this action, &quot;La Vallette&quot; was towed to Espiritu Santo by the , arriving on 3 February 1943.

Once repaired, &quot;La Vallette&quot; left 6 August for Pearl Harbor, where she joined a carrier force for a strike on Marcus Island 31 August before returning to patrol duty in the Solomon Islands. On the nights of 1 and 2 October, she spotted Japanese barges off Kolombangara, of which she claimed four sunk and two damaged. &quot;La Vallette&quot; carried out escort and screening assignments during the Gilbert landings, and strikes against Kwajalein and Wotje atolls. Brief repairs at San Francisco followed, after which she returned to the South Pacific.

===Later actions===
On 1 February 1944, she took part in the preinvasion bombardment of Roi, part of the Kwajalein complex, in April she shelled Aitape, and on 2 July supported the landings on Noemfoor, off New Guinea. Constant patrol and escort duties were performed between these actions.

Assigned to escort convoys during the first assaults on the Philippines, &quot;La Vallette&quot; had already left Leyte Gulf with a convoy to replenish her stores at Hollandia before the Battle of Leyte Gulf, returning to the Philippines by 5 December. She covered five more landings in the Philippines during December and January 1945, then joined the screen for minesweepers clearing Manila Bay. On 14 February in Mariveles Bay.

&quot;La Vallette&quot; was badly damaged by a mine, leaving six dead and 23 wounded, she was towed to drydock at Subic Bay, then sailed for Hunters Point Navy Yard where she was fully repaired. On 7 August she sailed for San Diego, California, decommissioned 16 April 1946 and entered the Reserve Fleet, where she remained until 1969. In 1974 she was sold to Peru, cannibalized for spare parts for the other Fletcher Class destroyers of the Peruvian Navy and her hull sold for scrap.

==Honors==
&quot;La Vallette&quot; received 10 battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Headstones is a Canadian punk-influenced rock band that was formed in Kingston, Ontario in 1989, broke up in 2003, and then reunited in 2011. Consisting of vocalist Hugh Dillon, guitarist Trent Carr, bassist Tim White, keyboardist Steve Carr and Jesse Labovitz on drums, and a reputation for high energy, &#x27;more rock less super shock&#x27; stage presence, and interaction with the audience, they frequently draw capacity crowds at mid-sized venues. Their songwriting tackles many serious and controversial topics. Between 1996 and 2016, Headstones were among the top 150 best-selling Canadian artists in Canada and among the top 35 best-selling Canadian bands in Canada.

==History==
The band signed to MCA Records in 1992. They released their debut album in June 1993, which was entitled &quot;Picture of Health&quot;. with original drummer Mark Gibson, who left the band after touring in support of the release. Dale Harrison was recruited for the follow-up &quot;Teeth &amp; Tissue&quot; in 1995. To promote the album, the band went on a two-month, 44-city tour. In 1996, the Headstones received Juno Award nominations for Best Group and Best Rock Album. In 1997, the band released their next album, &quot;Smile &amp; Wave&quot;. Three years later, &quot;Nickels for Your Nightmares&quot; was released, and both Carr and Harrison became fathers, while Dillon recovered from drug addiction.

The band released a compilation album, &quot;Greatest Fits&quot;, in 2001. In 2002, the band signed with MapleMusic, and released their next album, &quot;The Oracle of Hi-Fi&quot;. In September 2003, the band announced on their website that they had broken up, citing personal and professional causes.

Dillon started a new band, the Hugh Dillon Redemption Choir, whose debut album &quot;The High Co$t of Low Living&quot; was released in June 2005. Dillon has found success in acting, appearing in several films, including &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot;, &quot;Dance Me Outside&quot;, &quot;Trailer Park Boys: The Movie&quot;, &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot; and the TV series, Mayor of Kingstown&quot;Durham County&quot;, , &quot;Flashpoint&quot; and &quot;Continuum.&quot; In addition, their song &quot;Come On&quot; was featured in the videogame &quot;Triple Play 2002&quot;, and was also the theme for the Canadian version of the sketch comedy show, &quot;Comedy Inc.&quot;

White went on to become a music producer and composer for television and film, and also had a successful career as a voice actor, becoming the voice of such brands Nissan, Purolator, Advil, Toyota, Mr Clean and more 

===Reunion===
Headstones reunited for four shows in February 2011, and eight more in December: two in Vancouver and one each in Edmonton, Calgary, Toronto, London, Guelph, Peterborough and Niagara Falls, New York.

After reforming the band and getting back onstage, the Headstones went back into the studio to record a new album. Released in 2013, &quot;Love + Fury&quot; was crowdfunded through PledgeMusic, before being released by Universal Music. The album garnered the band their first top 10 album, and #1 hit single &quot;Long Way to Neverland&quot;. This was in followed in 2014 with another crowd-funded album, the acoustic covers collection &quot;One in the Chamber Music&quot;. The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Little Army,&quot; was released on June 2, 2017 on Known Accomplice, an imprint of Cadence Music Group. It includes the hit single &quot;Devil&#x27;s on Fire&quot;. With this release the band gave their fans an exclusive behind the scenes look into the making of the album, in real time.

A remastered edition of &quot;Picture of Health&quot; with bonus tracks was released in October 2018. On March 15, 2019, the band released a cover of Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s &quot;The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;. Their next album, &quot;PeopleSkills&quot;, was released by Known Accomplice on October 25, 2019, and is the band&#x27;s first full album to be released on vinyl. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Leave It All Behind&quot;, reached number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Canada Rock chart. The band&#x27;s newest album, &quot;Flight Risk&quot;, was released on October 14, 2022.

<text>The Keystone B-5 is a light bomber made by the Keystone Aircraft company for the United States Army Air Corps in the early 1930s. The B-5A was a Keystone B-3A with Wright Cyclone rather than Pratt &amp; Whitney engines.

==Design and development==
Three B-3A (LB-10A) were reengined with Wright R-1750-3 radial engines and were redesignated Y1B-5. The Army Air Corps changed the design of the last 27 LB-10As on order, replacing the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1690 radial engines with the Wright R-1750-3. The Pratt &amp; Whitney-powered aircraft were designated B-3A, and the Wright-powered aircraft became B-5A. They provided the backbone of the U.S. bomber force from then to 1934.

==Operational history==
B-5A were first line bombers of the United States for the period between 1930 and 1934. Afterwards, they remained in service primarily as observation aircraft until the early 1940s.

==Variants==
;LB-14
:Designed as LB-10 with 575 hp (429 kW) Pratt &amp; Whitney GR-1860 engines; three ordered, but redesigned with 525 hp (392 kW) Wright R-1750-3 engines and delivered as the Y1B-5.
;Y1B-5
:Three pre-production aircraft redesignated from LB-14 before delivery.

<text>The is one of the cabinet-level ministries of the Japanese government. The ministry was named the until 2001. The Ministry is headed by the , who is a member of the Cabinet and is typically chosen from members of the Diet by the Prime Minister.

The ministry&#x27;s history dates back to the 6th century in ancient Japan. After the Meiji Restoration, the Ministry of Finance was established. The ministry&#x27;s power over banking supervision was split to the newly established Financial Services Agency in 1990s. In the last decades, the ministry has been criticized for its frequent scandals and attempted censorship.

== Overview ==

The Ministry originated in the 6th century, when the was established as a state treasury in ancient Japan. When a modern system of government was introduced after the Meiji Restoration, the was established as a government body in charge of public finance and monetary affairs. It is said that new ministry employees are subtly reminded that the Ōkura-shō predates by some 1269 years when the new Constitution was imposed on the nation by the U.S. occupation forces in 1947.

The Ministry has long been regarded as the most powerful ministry in the Japanese government. After various financial scandals revealed in the 1990s, however, the Ministry lost its power over banking supervision to a newly established Financial Services Agency. It also lost most of its control over monetary policy to the Bank of Japan when the Diet passed a new Bank of Japan Law in 1998. In addition, it lost its ancient Japanese name when it was renamed the in January 2001, although its English name remained the same.

In financial markets, the Ministry is famous for its active foreign exchange policy. Its top civil servant on the international side, Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs, is often quoted in the financial press. Former Vice Minister Eisuke Sakakibara was known as &quot;Mr Yen&quot;, whereas his successors Haruhiko Kuroda and Zenbei Mizoguchi were often referred to as &quot;Mr. Asian Currency&quot; and &quot;Mr. Dollar&quot;, respectively.

The ministry has been criticized for attempting to stop major media networks from broadcasting negative informations against the ministry, mainly by hounding newspapers and others until a mistake is found in the declaration of incomes, whether it is a minor one or not. Among the newspapers and other media networks affected by this action are Chunichi Shimbun, Sankei Shimbun, Kyodo News, and more. Following the 2024 Japanese general election, criticisms against the ministry skyrocketed, mainly due to the ministry hesitating to pass a proposal by the Democratic Party For the People to reduce the income taxes. The ministry was compared to the Aum Shinrikyo on the internet, with the ministry nicknamed &quot;Zaimu Shinrikyo&quot; on social media platforms. Several protests calling for the dissolution of the ministry in front of the ministry were held from February 21, 2025. The protests, initially at the size of around a thousand spread across cities, with organizers holding protests in regional cities such as Fukuoka and Takamatsu. The lack of initial media attention towards this protest compared to others was criticized on the internet. The protests themselves received mixed reactions, with Hiroyuki Nishimura describing the protests as &quot;a waste of time, money, and power&quot;, criticizing the protests&#x27; lack of force to cause any changes. Nishimura cited French protests in the interview, referring to how buildings were torched during protests.

== Organizational structure ==

The Ministry is organized in six bureaus that provide the overall functions of the ministry:
* Minister&#x27;s Secretariat
* Budget Bureau
* Tax Bureau
* Customs and Tariff Bureau
* Financial Bureau
* International Bureau

==Independent Administrative Institutions==

==Incidents==

*In March 2018 Toshio Akagi, an employee of the ministry&#x27;s Kinki Local Finance Bureau, committed suicide after being forced to tamper with documents related to the sale of government owned land to school operator Moritomo Gakuen, a transaction defended by the ministry despite the resulting scandal. His wife began collecting signatures online for a petition to investigate the truth about Akagi&#x27;s suicide. , she had gathered around 290,000 signatures.

<doc id="870393" wikidata="Q1626025" url="?curid=870393" title="Homer Hickam">
<text>Homer Hadley Hickam Jr. (born February 19, 1943) is an American author, Vietnam War veteran, and a former NASA engineer who trained the first Japanese astronauts. His 1998 memoir &quot;Rocket Boys&quot; (also published as &quot;October Sky&quot;) was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller and was the basis for the 1999 film &quot;October Sky&quot;. Hickam&#x27;s body of written work also includes several additional best-selling memoirs and novels, including the &quot;Josh Thurlow&quot; historical fiction novels, his 2015 best-selling &quot;Carrying Albert Home: The Somewhat True Story of a Man, his Wife, and her Alligator&quot; and in 2021 the sequel to &quot;Rocket Boys&quot; titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Blow Yourself Up: The Further Adventures and Travails of the Rocket Boy of October Sky.&quot; His books have been translated into many languages.

== Early life and education ==
Homer H. Hickam Jr. is the second son of Homer Sr. and Elsie Gardener Hickam (née Lavender). He was born and raised in Coalwood, West Virginia, and graduated from Big Creek High School in 1960. He and friends Roy Lee Cooke (born December 25, 1941), Sherman Siers (June 15, 1942 – September 11, 1976), Jimmy O&#x27;Dell Carroll (born June 30, 1942), Willie &quot;Billy&quot; Rose, and Quentin Wilson (November 21, 1942 – August 30, 2019) became amateur rocket builders and called themselves The Big Creek Missile Agency (BCMA). After many generations of designs, they qualified for the 1960 National Science Fair and won a gold and silver medal in the area of propulsion.

=== Virginia Tech and Skipper ===
Hickam attended Virginia Tech in 1960 and joined the school&#x27;s Corps of Cadets. In his junior year, he and a few classmates designed a cannon for football games and school functions. They named the cannon &quot;Skipper&quot; in honor of President John F. Kennedy. Skipper was cast out of brass collected from the cadets and has become an icon for Virginia Tech. Hickam graduated in 1964 with a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial engineering.

== Career ==
=== Military service (1964–1970) ===
Hickam served six years in the U.S. Army and was honorably discharged at the rank of captain in 1970. He served in the Vietnam War in 1967 and 1968 as a first lieutenant and combat engineer with C Company, 704th Maintenance Battalion, 4th Infantry Division. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, Army Commendation Medal, and Army Meritorious Unit Commendation ribbon.

=== USAAMC and NASA (1971–1998) ===
Following his separation from the service, Hickam worked as an engineer for the United States Army Aviation and Missile Command from 1971 to 1978, assigned to Huntsville. Between 1978 and 1981, he was an engineer for the 7th Army Training Command in Germany.

Hickam began employment with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration at Marshall Space Flight Center in 1981 as an aerospace engineer. His specialties included training astronauts in regard to science payloads and extra-vehicular activities (EVA). Additionally, Hickam assisted at the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator as a diver where astronaut crews trained for numerous Spacelab and Space Shuttle missions, including the Hubble Space Telescope deployment, the first two Hubble repair missions, Spacelab-J (with the first Japanese astronauts), and the Solar Max repair mission. Prior to his retirement from NASA in 1998, Hickam was the payload training manager for the International Space Station program.

=== Literary career (1969–present) ===
Hickam began writing in 1969 after returning from serving in the Vietnam War. His first writings were magazine stories about scuba diving and his time as a scuba instructor. Then, having dived in many of the wrecks involved, he wrote about the battle against the U-boats along the American east coast during World War II. This resulted in his first book, &quot;Torpedo Junction&quot;, a military history published in 1989 by the Naval Institute Press.

His second book, the memoir &quot;Rocket Boys&quot;, started as an article &quot;The Big Creek Missile Agency&quot; in &quot;Air and Space magazine&quot;. In 1998 Delacorte Press published an expanded version of the memoir as a book, the story of his life as the son of a coal miner in Coalwood, West Virginia. &quot;Rocket Boys&quot; has since been translated into numerous languages and released as an audiobook and electronic book. Among its many honors, it was selected by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of its &quot;Great Books of 1998&quot; and was an alternate &quot;Book-of-the-Month&quot; selection for both the Literary Guild and the Book of the Month Club. &quot;Rocket Boys&quot; was also nominated by the National Book Critics Circle as Best Biography of 1998. In February 1999, Universal Studios released its critically acclaimed film &quot;October Sky&quot;, based on &quot;Rocket Boys&quot; (The title &quot;October Sky&quot; is an anagram of &quot;Rocket Boys&quot;). In an interview, Hickam has said of the movie that it was &quot;fine for what it is, a low-budget feel-good movie, but sadly missed the best parts of my memoir. Still, the world needs feel-good movies and it has done a good job of encouraging young people to go after their dreams.&quot; He has since co-written a musical play entitled &quot;Rocket Boys the Musical&quot;, which, according to Homer Hickam, tells a story closer to the one in his book.

Hickam&#x27;s first fiction novel was &quot;Back to the Moon&quot; (1999), which was released as a hardcover, audiobook, and eBook. It has also been translated into Chinese. It is a techno-thriller and a romantic novel, telling the story of a team of &quot;spacejackers&quot; who commandeer a space shuttle.

&quot;The Coalwood Way&quot;, a memoir of Hickam&#x27;s hometown, was published a year later by Delacorte Press and is referred to by Hickam as &quot;not a sequel but an equal&quot;. His third Coalwood memoir, a true sequel, was published in October 2001. It is entitled &quot;Sky of Stone&quot;. One more book about Coalwood was published in 2002, a self-help/inspirational tome entitled &quot;We Are Not Afraid: Strength and Courage from the Town That Inspired the #1 Bestseller and Award-Winning Movie October Sky&quot;.

In 2021, Hickam published a final sequel to &#x27;Rocket Boys&quot; titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Blow Yourself Up: The Further Adventures and Travails of the Rocket Boy of October Sky.&quot; The memoir covered the 40 years after the Rocket Boys era including building the iconic cannon at Virginia Tech while a student there, his military service including time as a Lieutenant in the 4th Infantry Division in Vietnam, becoming a scuba instructor, diving on ship wrecks, his recovery efforts of drowned passengers on a river boat in the Tennessee River, his early writing career, working for NASA and training the first Japanese astronauts, being on the Hubble Space Telescope repair crew training team, negotiating with the Russians for the International Space Station, exploring and suffering decompression sickness on the remote Honduran island of Guanaja, writing &#x27;Rocket Boys&#x27; and advising the director and producer on set of the movie October Sky and his relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal and the other actors in the film.

After his memoir series, Hickam began his popular &quot;Josh Thurlow&quot; series, set during World War II. The first of the series was &quot;The Keeper&#x27;s Son&quot; (2003), set on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The series continued with &quot;The Ambassador&#x27;s Son&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Far Reaches&quot; (2007), both set in the South Pacific. His next novel was &quot;Red Helmet&quot; (2008), a love story set in the present-day Appalachian coalfields and dedicated to &quot;Mine Rescue Teams Everywhere.&quot; In 2010, he co-authored &quot;My Dream of Stars&quot; (2010) with Anousheh Ansari, a multi-millionaire Iranian-American who became the world&#x27;s first female commercial astronaut. Hickam, an avid amateur paleontologist, also wrote &quot;The Dinosaur Hunter&quot;, a novel set in Montana published by St. Martin&#x27;s in November 2010.

He also published a young-adult science-fiction thriller trilogy set on the moon, known as the Helium-3 series. It included the titles &quot;Crater&quot;, &quot;Crescent&quot;, and &quot;The Lunar Rescue Company&quot;.

In 2015, Wm Morrow/HarperCollins published his best-selling &quot;Carrying Albert Home: The Somewhat True Story of a Man, His Wife, and Her Alligator&quot;, which has since been published in 17 languages and won many awards.

===Other activities===
In May, 2013, Hickam opposed a zero tolerance policy at Bartow High School which resulted in the expulsion of a student whose science experiment had caused a small explosion.

In 2013, Hickam was appointed to the Alabama Space Science Exhibition Commission (ASSEC) that oversees the activities of Space Camp and the U.S. Space and Rocket Center museum and other activities in Huntsville, Alabama. He served as chairman of the commission in 2019, the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.

In 2016, Hickam sued Universal Studios for fraud and breach of contract over rights to his &quot;Rocket Boys&quot; sequels, including &quot;The Coalwood Way&quot;, &quot;Sky of Stone&quot;, &quot;We Are Not Afraid&quot;, and &quot;Carrying Albert Home&quot;. The lawsuit was settled in 2017 to Hickam&#x27;s satisfaction. A lawsuit in federal court was initiated in 2017 for alleged copyright infringement by the Marriott Theatre in Lincolnshire, Illinois, and its writers and composers of &quot;Rocket Boys the Musical&quot;, Hickam&#x27;s musical play based on his memoir &quot;Rocket Boys&quot;.

In February, 2018, Hickam was appointed by Vice President Mike Pence to serve as a member of the Users Advisory Group of the National Space Council, which had been re-established by President Donald Trump in June 2017.

== Honors ==
In 1984, Hickam was presented with Alabama&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award for heroism shown during a rescue effort of the crew and passengers of a sunken paddleboat in the Tennessee River. Because of this award, Hickam was honored in 1996 by the United States Olympic Committee to carry the Olympic Torch through Huntsville, Alabama, on its way to Atlanta.

In 1999, the governor of West Virginia issued a proclamation in honor of Hickam for his support of his home state and his distinguished career as both an engineer and author and declared an annual &quot;Rocket Boys Day&quot;.

In 2000, the Virginia Tech junior class selected Hickam as the namesake for the Virginia Tech class of 2002 ring collection, the &quot;Homer Hickam Collection&quot;.

In 2007, Hickam was awarded an honorary doctorate in Literature from Marshall University. That same year, he received the Distinguished Achievement Award from Virginia Tech.

In 2010, Hickam received the Audie Murphy Patriotism Award at the Spirit of America Festival.

In 2013, Hickam won the Clarence Cason Award from the University of Alabama for his non-fiction writing.

In 2014, Hickam won the Appalachian Heritage Writer&#x27;s Award at Shepherd University.

In 2023, Hickam was presented with the Vietnam Veterans of America&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2024, Hickam was named the 2024 Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Distinguished Alumni, at a ceremony on March 28th at the Corps Leadership &amp; Military Science Building on the Virginia Tech campus.

<doc id="870399" wikidata="Q1192100" url="?curid=870399" title="Set cover problem">
<text>The set cover problem is a classical question in combinatorics, computer science, operations research, and complexity theory. 

Given a set of elements (henceforth referred to as the universe, specifying all possible elements under consideration) and a collection, referred to as , of a given subsets whose union equals the universe, the set cover problem is to identify a smallest sub-collection of whose union equals the universe. 

For example, consider the universe, and the collection of sets In this example, is equal to 4, as there are four subsets that comprise this collection. The union of is equal to . However, we can cover all elements with only two sets: , see picture, but not with only one set. Therefore, the solution to the set cover problem for this and has size 2.

More formally, given a universe formula_1 and a family formula_2 of subsets of formula_1, a set cover is a subfamily formula_4 of sets whose union is formula_1. 

* In the set cover decision problem, the input is a pair formula_6 and an integer formula_7; the question is whether there is a set cover of size formula_7 or less.
* In the set cover optimization problem, the input is a pair formula_6, and the task is to find a set cover that uses the fewest sets.

The decision version of set covering is NP-complete. It is one of Karp&#x27;s 21 NP-complete problems shown to be NP-complete in 1972. The optimization/search version of set cover is NP-hard. It is a problem &quot;whose study has led to the development of fundamental techniques for the entire field&quot; of approximation algorithms.

== Variants ==
In the weighted set cover problem, each set is assigned a positive weight (representing its cost), and the goal is to find a set cover with a smallest weight. The usual (unweighted) set cover corresponds to all sets having a weight of 1.

In the fractional set cover problem, it is allowed to select fractions of sets, rather than entire sets. A fractional set cover is an assignment of a fraction (a number in [0,1]) to each set in formula_2, such that for each element &quot;x&quot; in the universe, the sum of fractions of sets that contain &quot;x&quot; is at least 1. The goal is to find a fractional set cover in which the sum of fractions is as small as possible. Note that a (usual) set cover is equivalent to a fractional set cover in which all fractions are either 0 or 1; therefore, the size of the smallest fractional cover is at most the size of the smallest cover, but may be smaller. For example, consider the universe and the collection of sets The smallest set cover has a size of 2, e.g. But there is a fractional set cover of size 1.5, in which a 0.5 fraction of each set is taken. 

==Linear program formulation==
The set cover problem can be formulated as the following integer linear program (ILP).

For a more compact representation of the covering constraint, one can define an incidence matrix &quot;formula_11&quot;, where each row corresponds to an element and each column corresponds to a set, and &quot;formula_12&quot; if element e is in set s, and &quot;formula_13&quot; otherwise. Then, the covering constraint can be written as formula_14.

Weighted set cover is described by a program identical to the one given above, except that the objective function to minimize is formula_15, where formula_16 is the weight of set formula_17.

Fractional set cover is described by a program identical to the one given above, except that formula_18 can be non-integer, so the last constraint is replaced by formula_19.

This linear program belongs to the more general class of LPs for covering problems, as all the coefficients in the objective function and both sides of the constraints are non-negative. The integrality gap of the ILP is at most formula_20 (where formula_21 is the size of the universe). It has been shown that its relaxation indeed gives a factor-formula_20 approximation algorithm for the minimum set cover problem. See randomized rounding#setcover for a detailed explanation.

== Hitting set formulation ==
Set covering is equivalent to the hitting set problem. That is seen by observing that an instance of set covering can
be viewed as an arbitrary bipartite graph, with the universe represented by vertices on the left, the sets represented by vertices on the
right, and edges representing the membership of elements to sets. The task is then to find a minimum cardinality subset of left-vertices that has a non-trivial intersection with each of the right-vertices, which is precisely the hitting set problem.

In the field of computational geometry, a hitting set for a collection of geometrical objects is also called a stabbing set or piercing set.

== Greedy algorithm ==

There is a greedy algorithm for polynomial time approximation of set covering that chooses sets according to one rule: at each stage, choose the set that contains the largest number of uncovered elements. This method can be implemented in time linear in the sum of sizes of the input sets, using a bucket queue to prioritize the sets. It achieves an approximation ratio of formula_23, where formula_24 is the size of the set to be covered. In other words, it finds a covering that may be formula_25 times as large as the minimum one, where formula_25 is the formula_27-th harmonic number:
formula_28

This greedy algorithm actually achieves an approximation ratio of formula_29 where formula_30 is the maximum cardinality set of formula_31. For formula_32dense instances, however, there exists a formula_33-approximation algorithm for every formula_34.

There is a standard example on which the greedy algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of formula_35.
The universe consists of formula_36 elements. The set system consists of formula_7 pairwise disjoint sets 
formula_38 with sizes formula_39 respectively, as well as two additional disjoint sets formula_40,
each of which contains half of the elements from each formula_41. On this input, the greedy algorithm takes the sets
formula_42, in that order, while the optimal solution consists only of formula_43 and formula_44.
An example of such an input for formula_45 is pictured on the right.

Inapproximability results show that the greedy algorithm is essentially the best-possible polynomial time approximation algorithm for set cover up to lower order terms
(see Inapproximability results below), under plausible complexity assumptions. A tighter analysis for the greedy algorithm shows that the approximation ratio is exactly formula_46.

== Low-frequency systems ==

If each element occurs in at most sets, then a solution can be found in polynomial time that approximates the optimum to within a factor of using LP relaxation.

If the constraint formula_47 is replaced by formula_48 for all in formula_2 in the integer linear program shown above, then it becomes a (non-integer) linear program . The algorithm can be described as follows:
# Find an optimal solution for the program using some polynomial-time method of solving linear programs.
# Pick all sets for which the corresponding variable has value at least 1/ in the solution .

== Inapproximability results ==

When formula_50 refers to the size of the universe, showed that set covering cannot be approximated in polynomial time to within a factor of formula_51, unless NP has quasi-polynomial time algorithms. Feige (1998) improved this lower bound to formula_52 under the same assumptions, which essentially matches the approximation ratio achieved by the greedy algorithm. established a lower bound
of formula_53, where formula_54 is a certain constant, under the weaker assumption that Pformula_55NP.
A similar result with a higher value of formula_54 was recently proved by . showed optimal inapproximability by proving that it cannot be approximated to formula_57 unless Pformula_58NP.

In low-frequency systems, proved it is NP-hard to approximate set cover to better than formula_59.
If the Unique games conjecture is true, this can be improved to formula_60 as proven by .

 proves that set cover instances with sets of size at most formula_61 cannot be approximated to a factor better than formula_62 unless Pformula_58NP, thus making the approximation of formula_64 of the greedy algorithm essentially tight in this case.

== Weighted set cover ==
Relaxing the integer linear program for weighted set cover stated above, one may use randomized rounding to get an formula_65-factor approximation. Non weighted set cover can be adapted to the weighted case.

== Fractional set cover ==

<text>&#x27;, also known as &#x27; or Fushimi-Momoyama Castle, is a Japanese castle located in Fushimi Ward, Kyoto.

Fushimi Castle was constructed from 1592 to 1594 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi at the end of the Sengoku period as his retirement residence. Fushimi Castle was destroyed in the 1596 Keichō–Fushimi earthquake and rebuilt before eventually being demolished in 1623 and its site later used for the tomb of Emperor Meiji. The current Fushimi Castle is a replica constructed in 1964 near the original site in Fushimi.

The Azuchi–Momoyama period of Japanese history partially takes its name from Fushimi Castle.

== History ==

Construction of the original Fushimi Castle begun in 1592, the year after Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s retirement from the regency, and was completed in 1594. Twenty provinces provided workers for the construction, which numbered between 20,000 and 30,000.
Though bearing the external martial appearance of a castle, the structure was intended as a retirement palace for Hideyoshi, and was furnished and decorated as such. It is particularly famous for its Golden Tea Room, in which both the walls and the implements were covered in gold leaf. The castle was intended to be the site for Hideyoshi&#x27;s peace talks with Chinese diplomats seeking an end to the Seven-Year War in Korea, but an earthquake destroyed the castle entirely only two years after its completion.
It was rebuilt soon afterwards, and came to be controlled by Torii Mototada, a vassal of Tokugawa Ieyasu. In 1600, the castle fell in a famous and significant siege by Ishida Mitsunari. Torii, in a celebrated act of honor and bravery, defended the castle for eleven days, delaying Ishida&#x27;s forces and allowing his lord Tokugawa time to build his own army. This had a profound effect on the Battle of Sekigahara that came soon afterwards, and which marked the final victory of Tokugawa Ieyasu over all his rivals.
In 1623, the castle was dismantled, and many of its rooms and buildings were incorporated into castles and temples across Japan. Several temples in Kyoto, such as Yōgen-in (養源院), Genkō-an (源光庵), and Hōsen-in (宝泉院), have a blood-stained ceiling that had been the floor of a corridor at Fushimi Castle where survivors of Torii&#x27;s garrison had committed &quot;seppuku&quot; after the castle&#x27;s defenses were breached.

In 1912, the tomb of Emperor Meiji was built on the original site of the castle. The castle was not rebuilt until 1964, when a replica was created very nearby and primarily in concrete. The new structure served as a museum of the life and campaigns of Hideyoshi, and as the main attraction of a small theme park called &quot;Castle Land&quot;, but was closed to the public in 2003. The castle grounds, however, were reopened in 2007.

<text>A justice ministry, ministry of justice, or department of justice, is a ministry or other government agency in charge of the administration of justice. The ministry or department is often headed by a minister of justice (minister for justice in a very few countries) or a secretary of justice. In some countries, the head of the department may be called the [[attorney general]], for example in the United States. Monaco is an example of a country that does not have a ministry of justice, but rather a Directorate of Judicial Services (head: Secretary of Justice) that oversees the administration of justice. Vatican City, a country under the sovereignty of the Holy See, also does not possess a ministry of justice. Instead, the Governorate of Vatican City State (head: President of the Governorate of Vatican City State), the legislative body of the Vatican, includes a legal office.

Depending on the country, specific duties may relate to organizing the justice system, overseeing the public prosecutor and national investigative agencies (e.g. the American Federal Bureau of Investigation), and maintaining the legal system and public order. Some ministries have additional responsibilities in related policy areas such as overseeing elections, directing the police, law reform, and administration of the immigration and citizenship services. Some nations separate the duties of the ministry of justice from responsibility for the prosecution of criminal cases, such that the duties of an attorney general or similar officer reside in a separate office. Sometimes the prison system is separated into another government department called Corrective Services.

<doc id="870413" wikidata="Q931243" url="?curid=870413" title="Ernest Ranglin">
<text>Ernest Ranglin (born 19 June 1932) is a Jamaican guitarist and composer who established his career while working as a session guitarist and music director for various Jamaican record labels, including Studio One and Island Records. Ranglin played guitar on many early ska recordings and helped create the rhythmic guitar style that defined the form. He has worked with Theophilus Beckford, Jimmy Cliff, Monty Alexander, Prince Buster, the Skatalites, Bob Marley and the Eric Deans Orchestra. Ranglin is noted for a chordal and rhythmic approach that blends jazz, mento and reggae with percussive guitar solos incorporating rhythm &#x27;n&#x27; blues and jazz inflections.

==Early life==
Ernest Ranglin was born in Manchester, Jamaica. His family moved to Kingston, where he attended the Providence Primary School, Kingston Senior School and Bodin College. Ranglin&#x27;s introduction to music was through two uncles who both played guitar. Initially a self-taught guitarist, he received some tutoring on how to sight-read from a violin player named Tommy Tomlins. At the age of 15, Ranglin joined the Val Bennett Orchestra, which was followed by a period of employment with the Eric Deans Orchestra. While performing locally with these orchestras, Ranglin was introduced to the jazz pianist Monty Alexander, which led to a lifelong friendship as well as numerous musical collaborations.

==Career==
During the 1950s, Ranglin played guitar on calypso and mento releases, some of which were recorded for the tourist market. The 1958 albums &quot;The Wrigglers Sing Calypso at the Arawak&quot; as well as &quot;Jamaica Fabulous Island in the Sun - Denzil Laing and the Wigglers Sing Again&quot; (Kalypso FR 1002) recorded at Federal Studio are representative of the type of calypso floor show that Jamaican bands performed at hotels (some of the tracks from the original albums are included on the 2010 CD release &quot;Jamaica - Mento 1951–1958&quot;). He was employed as a guitarist by the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation (JBC) between the years 1958 and 1965, with public radio broadcasting (radio services had been established earlier with the first broadcast transmitted in November 1939) commencing in 1959 and television broadcasting commencing in 1963. Ranglin also played with Cluett Johnson&#x27;s studio band Clue J and the Blues Blasters; recording several tracks for Coxsone Dodd at Federal Studios, including the Theophilus Beckford hit &quot;Easy Snapping&quot; (recorded in 1956 and released in 1959), which he arranged and played guitar on. Ranglin also played on the Beckford tracks &quot;Jack and Jill Shuffle&quot; and &quot;Shuffling Jug&quot;. 

===1960s===
In 1962, the James Bond film &quot;Dr. No&quot; was being shot in Jamaica and Ranglin was hired by Carlos Malcolm, music director for JBC, to compose music for some of the scenes set in Jamaica. Ranglin was also the bassist on many early Prince Buster hits, including the 1963 ska release &quot;Wash Wash&quot; - a situation that arose from his contractual obligations to Federal Records, which barred him from appearing as a named guitarist on recordings not made or licensed by them. In 1963, Ranglin played guitar on and arranged &quot;My Boy Lollipop&quot;, which was sung by Millie Small, who had recently been signed to Blackwell&#x27;s Island label. &quot;My Boy Lollipop&quot; (a cover version of a song written by Robert Spencer of the doo-wop group the Cadillacs and originally recorded by Barbie Gaye in 1956) became a worldwide hit after being released by Island on licence to Fontana in March 1964. Ranglin was also employed by Duke Reid as an A&amp;R man for Reid&#x27;s Treasure Isle label as well as fulfilling the same role for the labels Federal (owned and operated by Ken Khouri, who recorded and produced Ranglin&#x27;s 1965 &quot;Guitar in Ernest&quot; album) and Gay Feet. His solo releases during this period saw him return to his jazz roots with the albums &quot;Wranglin&quot; (1964) and &quot;Reflections,&quot; (1965) both issued by Island. He was also involved with Merritone, a subsidiary record label started by Federal.

In 1964, Ranglin was in London with Blackwell, who was enquiring if it would be possible for Ranglin to play at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club. Initially the manager of Ronnie Scott&#x27;s was reluctant to agree but eventually allowed Ranglin to sit-in with the house band. The reception the audience gave to his performance overcame any reservations that the manager may have had and Ranglin was invited to become the venue&#x27;s resident guitarist. He stayed for nine months, backing numerous guest artists as well as appearing onstage with the Ronnie Scott Quartet and Quintet. In 1964, a live set was recorded at the club which was released on the Fontana label as &quot;The Night Is Scott And You&#x27;re So Swingable&quot; in 1966. Ranglin&#x27;s tenure at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s brought him to the attention of UK Jazz audiences with the &quot;Melody Maker&quot;′s readers duly voting Ranglin into first place in the guitar category of the paper&#x27;s 1964 Reader&#x27;s Jazz Poll. Upon his return to Jamaica he found himself once again doing A&amp;R and session work for Federal (musical director from 1965 to 1972) and Coxsone. He was involved in the recording of the Wailers&#x27; track &quot;It Hurts to Be Alone&quot; released on the Coxsone label in Jamaica and subsequently released in the UK (1965) by Island records. Ranglin was also music director for the recording of The Melodians&#x27; song &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot;. The closing years of the sixties found Ranglin working with the Jamaican producers Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry and Clancy Eccles; both of whom were instrumental in developing and establishing the new genre of reggae. Ranglin played on the Eccles-produced &quot;Say What You&#x27;re Saying&quot; (1967) by Eric &quot;Monty&quot; Morris, which he cites as one of the earliest records to feature reggae drumming.

===1970s to present===
In 1973, Ranglin was awarded the Order of Distinction by the Jamaican government for his contribution to music. Ranglin frequently recorded Latin/Caribbean-infused jazz with Monty Alexander during this period, most notably the album &quot;Rass!&quot; (1974). Ranglin also toured with Jimmy Cliff in the dual role of music director/guitarist, which resulted in the 1976 album release &quot;In Concert: The Best of Jimmy Cliff&quot;. Ranglin was the lead guitarist on the Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry recording sessions at Black Ark Studios for the &quot;Heart of the Congos&quot; (1977) album by the Congos.

In 1982, he moved to Florida, where he continued to record as well as taking the opportunity to perform more regularly at jazz festivals. In 1991, Ranglin&#x27;s nephew Gary Crosby formed the group Jazz Jamaica; Ranglin and Jazz Jamaica performed together at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s in October 2009 as part of the club&#x27;s anniversary concert series. In 1998, he signed to Chris Blackwell&#x27;s newly formed Palm Pictures label and released &quot;In Search of the Lost Riddim&quot;. That same year he played with Spearhead on &quot;I Got Plenty &#x27;o Nuthin&quot;, which was released on the Red Hot Organization compilation album &quot;Red Hot + Rhapsody&quot;. The albums &quot;E.B.@Noon&quot; and &quot;Modern Answers to Old Problems&quot; were released in 2000, followed by &quot;Grooving&quot; in 2001. In 2002 Ranglin was awarded an Honorary Doctorate Degree from the University of the West Indies for his outstanding contribution to the development of music in Jamaica. In 2006 he was the subject of a documentary &quot;Roots Of Reggae: The Ernest Ranglin Story&quot; produced and written by Arthur Gorson. In 2008, Ranglin was inducted into the Jamaican Music Hall of Fame by the Jamaica Association of Vintage Artistes and Affiliates (JAVAA). In November 2015, Ranglin announced that he would be retiring from the music business with a farewell tour in the summer of 2016. The tour featured musicians including Tony Allen, Courtney Pine, Ira Coleman, Cheikh Lô and Alex Wilson.

Ranglin was honoured with the Order of Jamaica in the 2021 National Honours and Awards on Jamaica’s 59th Anniversary of Independence.

In 2021 and 2022, he recorded the album &quot;Two Colors&quot; with saxophonist/producer Dean Fraser, which was released in May 2022.

<text>Endsieg (), a German term translating to &quot;final victory,&quot; emerged prominently during World War II as a central concept within Nazi ideology. 

==Meaning and purpose==
Coined by Nazi leaders, notably Adolf Hitler, it embodied the notion of an ultimate, decisive triumph for the Nazi regime. Propaganda and rhetoric utilized this term extensively to sustain morale, inspire followers, and maintain the perception of inevitable success, despite challenging circumstances and mounting losses.

The concept of &quot;Endsieg&quot; permeated Nazi propaganda, projecting an image of an assured, imminent victory to the German population and Nazi supporters. It served as a motivational tool to boost morale, invoking a sense of determination and commitment among soldiers and civilians alike.

Hitler&#x27;s speeches and propaganda machinery heavily emphasized the idea of &quot;Endsieg,&quot; portraying it as an ideological necessity and an ultimate goal towards which all efforts should be directed. The term was associated with the vision of a future where Nazi Germany emerged as the unparalleled, dominant power, achieving complete control and authority over Europe and possibly beyond.

==Nazi decline and final references to &quot;Endsieg&quot;==
However, the reality of the military situation contradicted this illusionary portrayal. As the war progressed, the tide turned against the Axis powers. Military defeats, logistical challenges, and the increasing strength of the Allied forces led to a gradual decline in Nazi Germany&#x27;s position. Despite Hitler&#x27;s insistence on the concept of &quot;Endsieg,&quot; the devastating losses suffered by Germany&#x27;s military, the economic strain, and the Allied advancements questioned the feasibility of such a conclusive victory.

The Battle of Stalingrad in 1942–43, one of the pivotal turning points, marked a significant setback for the Germans. The subsequent series of defeats, coupled with the Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944, underscored the vulnerability of the Axis powers.

As the war progressed, the Allied forces gained momentum, slowly but steadily pushing back the Axis powers on multiple fronts. The military campaigns in Europe and the Pacific demonstrated the increasing strength and unity among the Allied nations.

Ultimately, the war culminated in the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany in May 1945. The dream of an &quot;Endsieg&quot; was shattered, as Germany faced defeat and occupation by Allied forces. Joseph Goebbels still spoke about &quot;Endsieg&quot; as late as March 1945.

<text>The first USS &quot;Philip&quot; (DD–76) was a in the United States Navy during World War I, later transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Lancaster&quot;. She was named for John Woodward Philip.

==As USS &quot;Philip&quot;==
&quot;Philip&quot; was laid down by the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, 1 September 1917; launched 25 July 1918; sponsored by Mrs. Barrett P. Philip; and commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard 24 August 1918. The vessel was named for Admiral John Woodward Philip, captain of the battleship during the blockade and battle of Santiago, Cuba in 1898.

After being fitted out at Boston, &quot;Philip&quot; reported to Commander Squadron Two, Cruiser Force, 1 September 1918, to escort convoy HX–47 across the Atlantic, returning from Buncrana, Ireland, under orders of Commander, U.S. Destroyer Forces operating in European waters. She was flagship of Submarine Hunting Group stationed at the Coast Guard Station, Cold Spring, Cape May, New Jersey, 28 September – 11 October. She steamed to Europe with convoy HX–54 which sailed 27 October but returned to New York, 20 November.

&quot;Philip&quot; supported the trans-Atlantic flight of the NC-1, NC-3, and NC-4, 11 – 19 May 1919. With other fleet units, she had a part in Army experimental firing at Fort Hancock, New York. She then had orders to duty with Squadron 4, Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet, and reported at San Diego Destroyer Base 2 August. During the next month she cruised to Pearl Harbor, and thereafter took part in division maneuvers, fleet movements and tactical exercises, cruising the west coast of the United States, South America, and Panama Canal Zone, having special duty as assigned until 29 May 1922 when &quot;Philip&quot; was placed out of commission.

When recommissioned 25 February 1930, after her overhaul and reconditioning, &quot;Philip&quot; was attached to Destroyer Squadrons, Battle Fleet, and conducted maneuvers and gunnery practice for the Reserve Force in the San Diego area. On 3 November she arrived at Corinto, Nicaragua, en route to the East Coast to join the Training Squadron, arriving New York Navy Yard 6 December. For the instruction of NROTC classes in the year 1931, she made many departures from Staten Island for the New England coast, Bermuda operating area, and Naval Operating Base, Hampton Roads, Tangier Sound and Quantico, Virginia, before returning to New York. On 22 December she departed New York to join the Special Service Squadron which operated in the vicinity of Panama, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, for the protection of American interests. Upon being detached &quot;Philip&quot; entered Mare Island Navy Yard, and from 9 May to 30 July 1932 operated in reduced commission with Destroyer Squadron 20, Rotating Reserve.

At her base in San Diego, from 18 August, &quot;Philip&quot; operated with Destroyer Division 6, Squadron 2, Battle Fleet, engaging in intensive division training, tactics and torpedo practice, at times operating with Aircraft Battle Force. From December 1933 to July 1934 she was in reduced status as before, later serving successively with Submarine Division 12 and with Cruisers Scouting Force, and with other destroyer divisions.

In July – August 1934 &quot;Philip&quot; visited Alaskan ports, and made preparations for the Presidential Fleet Review held at San Diego in September – October 1935. Among her many duties, &quot;Philip&quot; annually participated in fleet problems, engaged in squadron and fleet tactics, acting at times as plane guard for carriers.

She decommissioned at Destroyer Base, San Diego, 2 April 1937, and recommissioned 30 September 1939 for duty with Division 64, Atlantic Squadron, which operated on neutrality patrol in the vicinity of Key West, Florida. She arrived there 11 December, and early the next year as a unit of the Antilles Detachment, she visited Dutch Indies and Venezuelan ports, as well as Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, St. Eustatius, Dry Tortugas, San Juan, Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, Culebra Island, and acted as submarine escort to the Canal Zone.

==As HMS &quot;Lancaster&quot;==
Departing Key West for New York Navy Yard 23 July 1940, she was overhauled and following trials arrived at Newport, Rhode Island, en route to Halifax, Nova Scotia. There she was decommissioned 23 October 1940 and turned over to British authorities in the ships for bases exchange, and renamed HMS &quot;Lancaster&quot; in the Royal Navy. Her name was struck from the Navy List 8 January 1941.

As &quot;Lancaster&quot;, she served as a convoy escort in the Royal Navy during World War II, and was reduced to reserve in July 1945.

<text>Daphnomancy is a form of pyromancy whereby the future is predicted by burning bay laurel leaves. A loud crackling from the fire is a positive omen, whereas silence is a negative one.

==History and etymology==
&quot;Daphno&quot; is thought to be a tribute to Daphne, an ancient Greek nymph turned into the first laurel tree by Apollo. Originally, the leaves were selected from the sacred grove of Apollo, but as time moved on the practice of daphnomancy spread to pre-Christian era Rome and Greece and was thought to be commonly practiced by augurs of both empires.

The original grove from which the Romans took their laurel branches withered in 68 AD, which contemporary augurs associated with Nero&#x27;s death.

<text>The Keystone B-6 was a biplane bomber developed by the Keystone Aircraft company for the United States Army Air Corps.

==Design and development==
In 1931, the United States Army Air Corps received five working models (Y1B-6s) of the B-6 bomber. The &quot;Y1B-&quot; designation, as opposed to a &quot;YB-&quot; designation, indicates funding outside normal fiscal year procurement. Two of these were redesignations of LB-13s; three were re-engined B-3As. The Air Corps placed an order for 39 production models on 28 April 1931, with deliveries between August 1931 and January 1932.

At the same time, an order was placed for 25 B-4As, the same aircraft but mounting Pratt &amp; Whitney engines instead of Wright Cyclones. Despite their lower sequence number, the B-4As would be delivered last. These were the last canvas-and-wood biplane bombers ordered by the Air Corps.

The performance of the B-6A varied little from the Martin NBS-1 ordered in 1921. Its successor, the monoplane bomber, had a hard time getting accepted. The Douglas Y1B-7 and Fokker XB-8 were originally designed as high-speed reconnaissance aircraft.

==Operational history==

The B-6A together with B-5A were front line bombers of the United States for the period between 1930 and 1934. Afterwards, they remained in service primarily as observation aircraft until the early 1940s.

B-6 aircraft were used, along with many other Army Air Corps planes, as mail planes in what became the Air Mail scandal of 1934.

On December 27, 1935, six B-6 bombers of the 23rd Bomb Squadron based in Hawaii dropped bombs to divert lava flow from the volcano Mauna Loa away from the port of Hilo.

With the residents of Virginia′s Tangier Island and Maryland′s Smith Island facing starvation after a severe winter storm and with ships unable to reach the islands due to heavy ice in the Chesapeake Bay, an Army Air Corps 49th Bomb Squadron B-6A made a one-hour, 54-mile (87-km) flight from Langley Field, Virginia, to Tangier Island on 9 February 1936 to drop of supplies in parcels to the islanders, flying at an altitude of not more than . On 10 February, the squadron&#x27;s B-6As made four similar fights to Tangier Island and one to Smith Island. The flights followed a supply flight to Tangier Island by the Goodyear Blimp &quot;Enterprise&quot; on 2 February 1936. After the success of the B-6A flights, the 49th Bomb Squadron flew additional flights to drop supplies to the islands using 13 Martin B-10B bombers.

==Variants==
;LB-13
:Seven aircraft ordered but delivered as the Y1B-4 and Y1B-6 with different engine installations.
;Y1B-6
:Two pre-production aircraft and three converted B-3As, as the LB-10 but with two Wright R-1820-1 engines.
;B-6A
:Production version of the Y1B-6, 39 built.

<doc id="870445" wikidata="Q16152341" url="?curid=870445" title="United States congressional delegations from Colorado">
<text>Since Colorado became a U.S. state in 1876, it has sent congressional delegations to the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives, beginning with the 44th United States Congress. Prior to statehood, the Colorado Territory sent non-voting delegates to the House of Representatives from 1861 to 1876. Each state elects two senators to serve for six years, and members of the House to two-year terms. Each state elects two senators to serve for six years in general elections, with their re-election staggered. Prior to the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, senators were elected by the Colorado General Assembly. Each state elects a varying number of, but at least one, member of the House, depending on population, to two-year terms. Colorado has sent eight members to the House in each congressional delegation since the 2020 United States Census.

A total of 80 people have served Colorado in the House and 37 have served Colorado in the Senate. The first of seven women to serve Colorado in Congress was Pat Schroeder, who served in the House from 1973 to 1996. The first and only African-American to have served Colorado in Congress is Joe Neguse.

The current dean, or longest-serving member, of the Colorado delegation is Representative Diana DeGette of the , who has served in the House since 1997. She is the second-longest serving member of Congress in Colorado history, only behind Edward T. Taylor, who served in the House from 1909 to 1941. Henry M. Teller, who served more than 30 years in the Senate, is the longest-serving senator in Colorado history.

==Current delegation==
Colorado&#x27;s current congressional delegation to the consists of two senators, both of whom are Democrats, and eight representatives comprising four Democrats and four Republicans.

The state of Colorado gained an beginning in 2023. The current dean of the Colorado delegation is Representative Diana DeGette of the , who has served in the House since 1997.

The Cook Partisan Voting Index (CPVI) is a measure of how strongly partisan a state is. It measures the party leaning (Democratic or Republican) and the number of percentage points more partisan than the national average. For instance, R+4 would mean the state voted four percentage points more Republican than the national average. As of 2022, the CPVI ranked Colorado&#x27;s 1st, 2nd, 6th, and 7th districts as leaning Democratic, and the 3rd, 4th, and 5th districts as leaning Republican. The 8th district is ranked as even. As a state, Colorado is ranked as leaning Democratic, with a score of D+4.

== United States Senate ==
Two senators from Colorado, Henry M. Teller and Ken Salazar, have also served as the United States Secretary of the Interior, under the Arthur administration and Obama administration respectively. Salazar is currently serving as the United States ambassador to Mexico under the Biden administration. Many senators from Colorado, including John F. Shafroth and Edwin C. Johnson, also served as the governor of Colorado. Some have also been at the forefront of national politics during their careers, including Eugene Millikin, who served as the chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, and Gary Hart, who finished second in the 1984 Democratic Party presidential primaries and was considered a frontrunner in the 1988 Democratic Party presidential primaries.

Senators are elected every six years depending on their class, with each senator serving a six-year term, and elections for senators occurring every two years, rotating through each class such that each election, around one-third of the seats in the Senate are up for election. Colorado&#x27;s senators are elected in classes II and III. Currently, Colorado is represented in the Senate by Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper.




== United States House of Representatives ==
Many representatives from Colorado have played important roles in the House of Representatives, including by chairing congressional committees. For instance, Wayne N. Aspinall chaired the United States House Committee on Natural Resources from 1959 to 1973, and Edward T. Taylor chaired the United States House Committee on Appropriations for more than three terms. Taylor was also influential in the passing of the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, which is named after him. Others took on important roles later in their careers, such as John F. Shafroth, who later became the governor of Colorado and a senator from Colorado known for his influence over the passing of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Seven women have served Colorado in the House, the first being Pat Schroeder, and the first and only African-American to have served Colorado in the House is Joe Neguse.

Each district uses a popular vote to elect a member of Colorado&#x27;s delegation in the House of Representatives. Districts are redrawn every ten years, after data from the US Census is collected. From 1861 to 1876, Colorado sent a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives; when it became a state in 1876, it had one seat in the House. Since then, its representation in the House has grown along with its population. Since 2023, Colorado has had eight congressional districts drawn according to the results of the 2020 United States Census.

<doc id="870454" wikidata="Q6579411" url="?curid=870454" title="Nakoruru">
<text>is a fictional character in the &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; (&quot;Samurai Spirits&quot; in Japan) series of fighting games by SNK. She is one of the series&#x27; best known and most popular characters alongside its main protagonist Haohmaru, and was introduced in the original &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; in 1993. Nakoruru is a good-hearted, young Ainu shrine maiden who loves nature and fights evil with the help of her hawk sidekick Mamahaha. She has a younger sister named Rimururu and an aggressive, and bloodthirsty darker side alter-ego known as Rera. As one of SNK&#x27;s popular mascot characters, Nakoruru has also appeared in many other games and other media.

==Appearances==

===&quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; games===
Nakoruru is featured as a player character in most game entries in the &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; series. She is also playable in various mobile spin-off titles, such as endless runner &quot;Samurai Shodown Slash,&quot; action game &quot;Samurai: Rougetsuki Densetsu,&quot; and rising simulation &quot;Maid by Iroha&quot;. In the series, Nakoruru is a gentle and shy teenage girl serving Mother Nature as a shamanic priestess of the Ainu religion, born on Hokkaido island in 1771. Despite her usually pacifistic ways, she became a Kamui warrior of her peaceful village Kamuikotan (神居古潭) after the death of her idolized father, and continues to fulfill this role throughout the series, fighting evil, often alongside the character Haohmaru. She is killed in the second game in the series, sacrificing herself to restore the balance of nature. She eventually merges her soul with Gaia and becomes &quot;the holy spirit who wanders through time&quot; in a form that resembles a koro-pok-guru.

In &quot;Samurai Shodown: Warriors Rage&quot;, the spirit of Nakoruru is an unplayable story mode character, but its PocketStation mini game is centered around her. She also featured as a non-player character mentor to the protagonist in the spin-off game, &quot;Nakoruru: Ano Hito kara no Okurimono&quot;, a 2001 visual novel adventure game which takes place between the first two games in the series.

Nakoruru fights with a treasured ceremonial makiri (a type of Ainu dagger or short sword sometimes known as &quot;Ainu kodachi&quot;) called the Chichi-ushi (チチウシ, Father Bull). Depending on the form, she is aided by either a mountain hawk-eagle named Mamahaha (ママハハ, in her &quot;Slash&quot; form) or a cross between Hokkaido wolf and Siberian wolf named Shikuru (シクルゥ, in her &quot;Bust&quot; form), also having other animal friends. Her powers include communicating with nature, fueling her blade with ki energy, ability to reflect a projectile back to its sender using her cloak, and healing wounds with the power of nature. American ninja Galford D. Weller is in love with her. The endings for &quot;Samurai Shodown VI&quot; revealed that Nakoruru and an alter-ego of Galford traveled the world together.

===&quot;The King of Fighters&quot; games===
In &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series, Nakoruru has appeared in a playable capacity in multiple games in the series in various non-canon roles. She also appeared as a non-playable character in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94 Re-Bout&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters 2000&quot; (as a Special Striker for Yuri Sakazaki), &quot;The King of Fighters 2002: Unlimited Match&quot;, and &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot; (in the Japan stage and in the Android/iOS versions as a tutorial instructor).

Nakoruru made her canonical playable debut in &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;, as the leader of the &quot;Another World Team.&quot; Nakoruru senses a new terrible evil known as Verse arriving through rifts in space and time. Nakoruru travels to the present and teams up with other characters to defeat Verse. Nakoruru returns as a playable character in &quot;SNK All-Star&quot;, in which she and other characters from games set in the past awaken in the modern world and must team up with character Kyo Kusanagi in a fight to seal away the &quot;King of Fighters&quot; series antagonist Orochi.

===Other video games ===
Nakoruru is playable in the fighting games &quot;Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000&quot; (as an unlockable secret character), &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2&quot;, &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium&quot; (as rival of Capcom&#x27;s Morrigan Aensland), &quot;Neo Geo Battle Coliseum&quot;, &quot;SNK Gals&#x27; Fighters&quot;, and &quot;SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy&quot;. She is also playable in various SNK games such as &quot;Neo Geo Tennis Coliseum&quot;, &quot;Quiz King of Fighters&quot;, and &quot;The Rhythm of Fighters.&quot;

Nakoruru has also made collaboration event appearances in many portable and mobile games, including &quot;AFK Arena&quot;, &quot;Dai Shingeki RPG! Sister Quest&quot;, &quot;Dark Avenger X&quot;, &quot;Granblue Fantasy&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters All Star&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Story: Brave Legion&quot;, &quot;Kal Kal Kal All Together&quot;, &quot;Kotatsu Mikuni Kansai Senki&quot;, &quot;Might &amp; Magic: Elemental Guardians&quot;, &quot;The Samurai Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Honor of Kings&quot; (&quot;Wangzhe Rongyao&quot;), &quot;Yamato Chronicle&quot;, and &quot;You Are the Hero!.&quot; In &quot;Blade Smash&quot; she was redesigned as a ninja, while in &quot;Lost Saga&quot; she was made optionally male as well female.

Nakoruru is furthermore a non-player character in the dating sims &quot;Days of Memories: Oedo Love Scroll&quot; and &quot;Kaze Maiu Miyako de Tsukamaete!&quot;, and has a cameo of Rera as Nakoruru in &quot;Sekai de Ichiban Atsui Fuyu&quot;. She appears in cards in &quot;SNK Dream Battle&quot; and &quot;SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters DS&quot;. She also appears as a spirit in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, where a Mii Fighter costume based on her is available as downloadable content.

=== Other appearances ===
Nakoruru appears in an anime film &quot;Samurai Shodown: The Motion Picture&quot; and in an anime OVA miniseries &quot;&quot; (as titular lead character) and &quot;Samurai Spirits 2: Asura-Zanmaden&quot; (appearing along with Rera in both OVAs), also making a cameo in &quot;Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture&quot; (in a cosplay of Reiko Chiba), as well as in a number of manga releases (including as a co-protagonist of Kyoichi Nanatsuki and Yuki Miyoshi&#x27;s adaptation of the first &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot;, which was serialized in the West in an American magazine &quot;Game On!&quot;). She is also featured in several of the series&#x27; drama CDs and is a member in SNK&#x27;s character image band, Band of Fighters, starring in her own character image CD.

Nakoruru further shows up in pachinko slot machine systems, including prominently in &quot;Samurai Spirits&quot; and especially &quot;Samurai Spirits Oni (Nakoruru)&quot;. She has dozens of figurines made in her image, and even a life-size figure, also being featured in various other merchandise such as T-shirts, and in an American collectible card game &quot;Universal Fighting System&quot;. Keeping in key with her nature-loving persona, Nakoruru was used as a mascot for SNK&#x27;s environmental awareness campaigns conducted together with city administrations in Mitaka and Kyoto in 1994. In 2007, SNK Playmore also created a social action program for children using Nakoruru and the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; star Terry Bogard as their mascots. An image of praying Nakoruru was used to support the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami relief fund-raising.

==Design and gameplay==
The series&#x27; creator Yasushi Adachi chose &quot;the two flagship characters&quot; Haohmaru and Nakoruru as the characters that best sum up the series, with Nakoruru being &quot;a main character in the storyline who has to fight for her life and her destiny, and sacrifices herself in the end to preserve an important cause,&quot; and thus representing &quot;some of the most important &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; themes.&quot; The idea for the character came from a modern Japanese perception of the indigenous Ainu people of Hokkaido, being depicted as revering nature and peacefully coexisting with it. Before the &quot;Samurai Spirit&quot; project began, one of Nakoruru&#x27;s creators had thought that &quot;one day Ainu women should have a first-class appearance&quot; in a video game as he thought they have had received too little attention and representation in modern media.

Her costume design was based on Ainu clothing (in two main versions depending on the length of her skirt) and she was supposed to mix a concept of a &quot;petite girl with a lovely appearance and personality&quot; with an &quot;innovative&quot; character performance of commanding a hawk companion in battle. Although Nakoruru was not directly modeled after any particular existing character, Hilda from &quot;The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun&quot; and Kamui from &quot;The Dagger of Kamui&quot; helped her conception process. The girl that appears during Nakoruru&#x27;s entrances in &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; is one of her childhood friends introduced in &quot;Nakoruru: Ano Hito kara no Okurimono&quot;, Manari. Nakoruru was notably the first fighting game character brought back to life following her demise and one of the first who used a sidekick character in gameplay.

Nakoruru is a rather petite girl that is 153 cm tall. An alternate, palette swap version of her with tanned skin, different colors of hair and eyes, and a bigger chest is the Bust Nakoruru (羅刹ナコルル, &quot;Rasetsu Nakoruru&quot;) or EX Nakoruru, a recurring &quot;Easter egg&quot; type character that eventually evolved into Rera. Popularly known as , she is a crueler and cockier version of Nakoruru, more violent about fulfilling her mission to protect nature, and her companion is Shikuru the wolf. In the 1999 anime film &quot;Samurai Spirits 2: Asura Zanmaden&quot;, Rera tries to support her host in giving up fighting for a while, but eventually she understands Nakoruru in what has to be done to help Shiki. Nakoruru leaves to help Shiki, but not before Rera warns her that if she doesn&#x27;t succeed, she will kill her host. Rera later appears at the end of the film telling Nakoruru to be safe on her journey. In the fan service oriented fighting game &quot;SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy&quot;, Nakoruru appears as default in a &quot;sexy vampire&quot; costume with a bat as her animal, while in &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; she can be dressed up in a modern schoolgirl uniform of the &quot;Kamuikotan Private High School&quot;.

To compensate for Nakoruru&#x27;s short weapon range, players must rely on her speed to punish their opponents&#x27; mistakes. Nakoruru&#x27;s strengths lie in her air supremacy (including aerial throws) and ability to jump around the sides of the screen. She can also recover from her moves a little quicker than other characters, making it easier for her to hit-and-run during fights. To balance her out with the rest of the cast, her attack strength is slightly weaker than most fighters. Her move set usually incorporates slightly longer ranged attacks that project her or her animal companions to her foes so her attack range is not limited to her sword. Since &quot;Samurai Shodown II&quot;, she can also reflect projectiles with the move &quot;Kamui Ryusei&quot;. Mamahaha can be used by the player to attack opponents in a diagonal aerial attack, acting as Nakoruru&#x27;s projectile and anti-air defense. The player may also command Nakoruru to use him as a mount for a limited time. Whilst she is in the air, players can command the pair to hover higher, drop, or use Nakoruru to attack foes; she may do so normally from Mamahaha&#x27;s height or players may choose to drop her in a swirl attacking motion or use a diagonal nosedive attack. Her moves&#x27; names are written in Hokkaido Ainu.

Prior to &quot;Samurai Shodown V Special&quot;, Nakoruru and Rimururu have been the series&#x27; two characters notable for being immune to the Fatality-like bloody killing moves. In &quot;Samurai Shodown: Edge of Destiny&quot;, Mamahaha does not appear in fights except in special moves. The presence of monkeys in Nakoruru&#x27;s stage in the original &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; was a mistake of the background designer Tomoaki Fukui which confused many fans as there are no monkeys on Hokkaido. There have been attempts to add Nakoruru into the series &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; already during the 1990s: a &quot;Samurai Spirits Team&quot; was originally scheduled to participate in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot; as Nakoruru was intended to team up with Galford and Haohmaru.

==Reception and analysis==

Nakoruru has frequently been described as being among the most popular characters associated with SNK since her debut, with her popularity stemming from her design, motifs, and her Ainu heritage. Variations of the character have been introduced in the series since, which has caused many debates over which one is the most popular. The character has been well-received worldwide, becoming especially popular in Japan. According to &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; producer Yasuyuki Oda, this was a surprise, as no one at SNK had expected her to be as popular as she was. Nakoruru was added to 2016&#x27;s &quot;KOF XIV&quot; due to her enduring popularity. Her popularity also resulted in some people in Japan becoming more interested in the modern Ainu people. She was named the best character of 1993 by the magazine &quot;Gamest&quot;, and she was also voted the most popular female character by male readers of &quot;Neo Geo Freak&quot; in 1997. Nakoruru became particularly popular among cosplayers, and in doujinshi fan-works. Nakoruru&#x27;s hawk, Mamahaha, was regarded as a &quot;defining moment&quot; of &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot;, with staff citing it as an early example of a &quot;satellite character,&quot; which they considered innovative in fighting games.

Nakoruru&#x27;s ties to the culture of the Ainu people were described by the book as being an example of appropriation, with Nakoruru&#x27;s popularity among fans being at odds with the struggles the Ainu people face. They additionally criticized Nakoruru as an example of how the Ainu were characterized as &quot;something permanently located in the past,&quot; as well as how she was repeatedly &quot;fetishized&quot; in multiple forms of media, such as doujinshi. &quot;Christina M. Spiker, in the &quot;Journal of Anime and Manga Studies&quot;, analyzed Nakoruru&#x27;s role in shaping the image of the Ainu people in popular culture. She argued that Nakoruru&#x27;s popularity led to the spread of misinformation about the Ainu, especially through her portrayal in the shôjo genre, which distanced her from her Ainu roots. Spiker also critiqued the character&#x27;s fetishization in doujinshi productions, emphasizing that while Nakoruru introduced Ainu culture to a broader audience, her depiction reinforced harmful stereotypes.&quot;

<text>The Gaelic College (), formally The Royal Cape Breton Gaelic College (), is a non-profit educational institution located in the community of St. Anns, Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, along the Cabot Trail. Founded in 1938, its focus has been on the perpetuation of Highland Scottish Gaelic culture.

==History==
&quot;Colaisde na Gàidhlig&quot;, The Gaelic College, was founded in 1938 by Presbyterian minister the Reverend A.W.R. MacKenzie, opening in a one-room log building on land in St. Ann&#x27;s.
In September 2011, former Premier of Nova Scotia Rodney MacDonald was named president of the college. In December 2013, to recognize the 75th anniversary of the college&#x27;s founding, its name was changed to &quot;The Royal Cape Breton Gaelic College&quot; (&quot;Colaisde Rìoghail na Gàidhlig&quot;) after Elizabeth II, the reigning Canadian monarch, granted permission for use of the prefix &quot;royal&quot;, as requested to the federal Cabinet by the college&#x27;s board of directors. However some, including Allan MacMaster, Member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly for Inverness, objected to the name change as offensive to Nova Scotians descended from Highlanders who had had to leave Scotland because of the Highland Clearances. In response Kirk McRae, the Acting Chair of the Gaelic College, said it was &quot;just an honour of name, it doesn&#x27;t take away what the goals are of the college ... that is to grow the Gaelic culture.&quot; The Chairman of the Monarchist League of Canada, Robert Finch, characterized the prefix as &quot;a Canadian honour distinct from history&#x27;s disputes between English and Scots.&quot; In March 2014, the board of governors decided to discontinue day-to-day use of the &quot;royal&quot; prefix.

In 2021, the college announced the opening of a new Gaelic-medium school at its satellite campus, &quot;Beinn Mhabu&quot; (Mabou Hill College) – the first of its kind in North America. The satellite centre will also host a Gaelic-language internet radio station, as well as artists, and will provide courses accredited by Cape Breton University.

==Mission==
The institution&#x27;s mission is:
&quot;To promote, preserve and perpetuate through studies in all related areas: the culture, music, language, arts, crafts, customs and traditions of immigrants from the Highlands of Scotland.&quot;
The early years of the college&#x27;s history were dedicated to the instruction of the Scottish Gaelic language, which, in the 1930s, was under significant threat of dying out. It had once been spoken by over 100,000 Nova Scotians until the advent of modern transport and communications in the early 20th century began to force English assimilation in the agrarian economies of Cape Breton Island and Nova Scotia.

Today, the organization has a broader mandate to preserve the culture of the Scottish Highlanders, who settled in the area. Thousands of students from all over North America and around the world attend both summer sessions and courses held throughout the year. The college is also home base for organizations like the Cape Breton Fiddlers&#x27; Association and the annual Celtic Colours International Festival.

==Program==
The college&#x27;s curriculum covers the following:
* Gaelic language
* Gaelic song
* Gaelic history
* Gaelic storytelling
* Gaelic drama
* Highland bagpiping
* Cape Breton fiddling
* Cape Breton piano accompaniment
* Guitar accompaniment
* Cape Breton step dance
* Scottish highland dance
* Bodhrán
* Celtic harp
* Tin Whistle
* Celtic weaving and textiles

<text>Patrol Squadron 10 (VP-10) is a United States Navy Patrol Squadron based at Naval Air Station Jacksonville in Jacksonville, Florida, United States. It is nicknamed the &quot;Red Lancers&quot; and is equipped with the Boeing P-8A Poseidon. It is the third squadron to be designated VP-10. The first VP-10 was redesignated VP-2D15 on 21 September 1927 and the second VP-10 was redesignated VP-25 on 1 July 1939.

==History==

===1951-1990===
*February – June 1954: VP-10 deployed to various locations in the Caribbean area during the Guatemala coup d&#x27;état and a tense revolutionary atmosphere in Central America. Detachments were located at Lajes Field, Azores, Roosevelt Roads Naval Station San Juan, Puerto Rico, NAS Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and NAS Key West, Florida.
*October 1954: VP-10 deployed to NAS Keflavik, Iceland. During the period of Icelandic patrols, the squadron was tasked with conversion from the P2V-5 to the newer P2V-5F, which necessitated sending crews to Burbank, California, to pick up the replacement aircraft at the factory. The transition was completed prior to the return of the squadron to NAS Brunswick in January 1955. 
*1957: VP-10 deployed to NAS Argentia, Newfoundland. During the deployment the squadron participated in the annual exercise Operation Springboard at Roosevelt Roads. Before returning to home base in late 1957, the squadron flew to Thule Air Base, Greenland, to collect valuable information on the location and movement of ice formations in the northeast areas of Canada and Greenland. 
*July 1958: VP-10 was split into two detachments. One detachment deployed to Iceland with six aircraft to plot the ice coverage over the Denmark Strait. During the deployment the detachment visited Norway, Denmark, Holland, England, Germany and French Morocco. The second detachment flew to Lebanon and provided support during the Lebanon Crisis. Following the end of the crisis, they visited Spain, Morocco, Italy, Greece, Libya and Malta. 
*February 1959: A three-aircraft detachment visited Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile. A second detachment of three aircraft visited Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Dutch Guyana. The flights were intended to bolster the faltering democratic governments of South American allies with a demonstration of U.S. military power and the &quot;long reach&quot; of Navy patrol squadrons.
*September 1960: VP-10 conducted a &quot;Hurrivac,&quot; flying to Battle Creek, Michigan, to escape Hurricane Donna. At the end of the month, a part of the squadron deployed to NAS Argentia, Newfoundland, for one week to assist the fleet in Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercises.
*6–29 January 1961: VP-10 conducted a split deployment with six aircraft deployed to Naval Station Rota, Spain, and five aircraft to Keflavik, Iceland. On 27 Jan 1961, the Rota detachment received an unusual request from the Portuguese government to assist in the search for &quot;Santa Maria&quot;, a hijacked Portuguese liner. The detachment operated briefly from the Isle DeSal in the Cape Verde Islands from 27 to 29 January 1961, before Portuguese authorities captured the ship.
*7 November 1961: A VP-10 P2V-5F Neptune flying on ASW patrol crashed into the ocean with the loss of all 11 crewmen. 
*10 October 1962: VP-10 deployed a four-aircraft detachment to Lajes Field in support of the Cuban Quarantine.
*13 April 1963: VP-10 flew SAR flights in an attempt to locate the missing nuclear submarine . After several hours of searching, a squadron aircraft spotted an oil slick at 41°43&#x27;N 64°57&#x27;W and radioed the position to surface vessels involved in the search. Remote submersible cameras located the wreckage, but all hands were lost.
*30 January 1966: VP-10 deployed to NAS Keflavik, relieving VP-21. A detachment of the squadron also deployed to NAS Argentia. VP-10 was the first patrol squadron on that station with the P-3A Orion. The squadron transitioned to the newer P-3B upon return from deployment in June.
*13 January 1967: VP-10 deployed to NAS Keflavik with five of its new P-3Bs. Four other crews deployed to Puerto Rico to take part in the annual Operation Springboard exercises at Roosevelt Roads. Upon completion, three aircraft deployed to Lajes Field, while the fourth rejoined the squadron at NAS Keflavik.
*15 March 1974: The squadron lost P-3B, BuNo. 152749, in a crash at sea from NAS Brunswick, Maine. The crash resulted in the death of all five crew members and ended the squadron&#x27;s record of 95,232 accident-free flying hours.
*9 August 1978: VP-10 deployed to NAS Bermuda, during which the squadron received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for its achievements in tracking Soviet submarines.
*January – September 1980: The squadron began receiving the updated P-3C UII aircraft at the rate of one per month. The squadron&#x27;s P-3Bs were transferred to fleet reserve squadrons.
*2 January 1980: A detachment of P-3B Orions of VP-10 deployed to NS Rota, flew photoreconnaissance missions to locate areas damaged by an earthquake which struck the Azores the day before, killing some 50 people and injuring another 500.
*26 July 1981: VP-10 deployed to NAS Keflavik. During the deployment the squadron was engaged in operation Ocean Venture against numerous friendly &quot;targets.&quot; One of the players in the exercise turned out to be a Soviet Papa-class submarine that had wandered into the area while trying to conduct surveillance of the NATO surface activities. The successful exposure of the submarine and the squadron&#x27;s general performance during the deployment earned VP-10 a Meritorious Unit Commendation from the Secretary of the Navy.
*25 October – 2 November 1983: VP-10 provided several aircraft and crews for patrols in the vicinity of Grenada during the U.S. Invasion of Grenada.
*13 September 1989: A VP-10 P-3C Orion deployed on anti-drug patrol in the Puerto Rico operating area spotted a suspicious ship in the offshore waters of the Dominican Republic. Authorities were notified and the suspects were caught on the beach from Santo Domingo attempting to off-load 2,930 pounds of pure cocaine.
*1 June 1991: VP-10 deployed to NAS Sigonella, Sicily and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The deployment had originally been planned for the Caribbean, but two factors changed those plans abruptly at the last moment: the disestablishment of VP-44 and Operation Desert Storm.

===1990-2015===
* January - July 1993: Deployed to NAS Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico in support of counter-drug operations in the Caribbean. 
* August 1994 - February 1995: Deployed to NAS Sigonella, Sicily in support of NATO operations Sharp Guard and Deny Flight in the Adriatic Sea related to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. 
* In 1996, VP-10 transitioned to the P-3C Update III. After completing transition to the P-3C Aircraft Improvement Program (AIP) in late 1998, the squadron deployed to the European theater of operations in support of the Kosovo War and were the first to conduct P-3 overland strike operations.
* In the 2000s, VP-10 deployed multiple times in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, and more recently, maritime security and anti-piracy operations in support of Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa.
* In 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended that Brunswick Naval Air Station be closed and the squadron be moved to Naval Air Station Jacksonville. The squadron completed the home port change in December 2009 following their return from a combined Central and Africa Command deployment.

===2015 - present===

* March 2015: The squadron started the transition to the P-8A Poseidon, their first transition in 50 years.
* September 2015: VP-10 completed the transition to the P-8A and completed a 12-month Fleet Readiness Training Plan in preparation for an upcoming deployment to United States Seventh Fleet.
* September 2016: The Red Lancers departed Jacksonville on their inaugural P-8A deployment to United States Seventh Fleet. The squadron provided critical intelligence through Maritime Domain Awareness, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, and Anti-Submarine Warfare flights. In the span of six months, VP-10 detached to 16 different locations, conducted over 652 sorties, and flew over 3,600 hours in the Pacific theater.
* 2017: During their inter-deployment Fleet Response Training Plan (FRTP) training period, the Lancers conducted numerous operational detachments. In the Fall of 2017, Lancers flew P-8&#x27;s on Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) missions in Texas, Florida and U.S. Virgin Islands after Hurricanes Harvey, Maria, and Irma. During the same time, VP-10 also surged aircraft and crews to support TASW operations in Europe. In November, VP-10 sent an aircraft and personnel to Argentina to help search for the stricken submarine ARA San Juan. That effort led to a Meritorious Unit Citation for the squadron. 
* 2018: VP-10 deployed to the United States Sixth Fleet Area of Responsibility, flying nearly 5,000 hours while conducting ASW, ISR, CSG support, Theatre Security and Cooperation, and numerous NATO and Allied exercises in over a dozen detachments to 9 countries. VP-10 was awarded the 2018 Battle Effectiveness Award.

<text>The first USS &quot;Woolsey&quot; (DD-77) was a in the United States Navy during World War I. She was named for Melancthon Taylor Woolsey.

==History==
&quot;Woolsey&quot; was laid down on 1 November 1917 at Bath, Maine, by the Bath Iron Works. The ship was launched on 17 September 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Elise Campau Wells. The destroyer was commissioned on 30 September 1918, Lieutenant Commander Frederick V. McNair, Jr. in command.

After trials out of Bath and outfitting at the Boston Navy Yard and the Newport Torpedo Station, &quot;Woolsey&quot; headed for New York on 9 October to join the battleship before sailing for Europe. On 13 October, she and &quot;Virginia&quot; departed New York harbor in the screen of Convoy HX 52. After a relatively uneventful voyage, the convoy was turned over to a British escort force on 22 October. &quot;Woolsey&quot; then set course for Buncrana, located in the far northern portion of Ireland, and arrived there on 23 October. Two days later, she departed Buncrana and stood down the Irish Sea en route to Ponta Delgada in the Azores. After fueling at Ponta Delgada on 30 October, the destroyer continued her voyage home and reentered New York on 5 November. After about a month at New York, during which time hostilities ended under the armistice of 11 November, &quot;Woolsey&quot; left New York on her way back to Europe to join the American naval contingent assigned there for postwar duty. She arrived in Brest, France on 20 December and reported for duty to the Commander, Naval Forces Europe.

For the next seven months, she performed various missions for the United States&#x27; naval establishment in Europe. Her primary mission consisted of runs between Brest and ports in southern England – notably Plymouth and Southampton – transporting passengers and mail. On 11 March 1919, she was one of the four American destroyers to escort into Brest when that ship arrived with President Woodrow Wilson embarked. After a four-month return to cross-channel runs between England and France, &quot;Woolsey&quot; was honored a second time when she was assigned duty as one of &quot;George Washington&quot;″s escorts for President Wilson&#x27;s return voyage to the U.S. from the Versailles peace conference. She departed Brest late in June 1919 in company with &quot;George Washington&quot; and arrived in Hampton Roads on 8 July.

Ten days later, &quot;Woolsey&quot; put to sea again bound for a new assignment – the Pacific Fleet. She reached Panama on 24 July, transited the Panama Canal, and headed for maneuvers in the Hawaiian Islands. At the completion of those maneuvers, she returned to the continental United States at San Diego. On 31 May 1920, the destroyer was placed out of commission at the Mare Island Navy Yard – probably for an extensive because she was recommissioned again on 20 October. For the remainder of her relatively brief career, &quot;Woolsey&quot; operated with the Pacific Fleet along the western coast of North America. While operating off the Pacific coast of Panama near Coiba Island early on the morning of 26 February 1921, &quot;Woolsey&quot; was cut in half during a collision with the merchant ship SS &quot;Steel Inventor&quot; and sank. There were 100 survivors, 17 injured, and 16 killed. Only one body was recovered. Survivors were rescued by her sister ship, .

<doc id="870493" wikidata="Q1081894" url="?curid=870493" title="Space Ace">
<text>Space Ace is a LaserDisc video game produced by Bluth Group, Cinematronics and Advanced Microcomputer Systems (later renamed RDI Video Systems). It was unveiled in October 1983, just four months after the &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; game, followed by a limited release in December 1983 and then a wide release in Spring 1984. Like its predecessor, it featured film-quality animation played back from a LaserDisc.

The gameplay is similar to &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;, requiring the player to move the joystick or press the fire button at key moments in the animated sequences to govern the hero&#x27;s actions. There is also the occasional option to either temporarily have the character transform into his adult form or remain as a boy with different styles of challenge.

The arcade game was a commercial success in North America, but was unable to achieve the same level of success as &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;. It was later ported to a number of home systems.

== Gameplay ==

Like &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;, &quot;Space Ace&quot; is composed of numerous individual scenes, which require the player to move the joystick in the right direction or press the fire button at the right moment to overcome the various hazards Dexter/Ace faces. &quot;Space Ace&quot; introduced a few gameplay enhancements, most notably selectable skill levels and multiple paths through several of the scenes. At the start of the game, the player could select one of three skill levels: &quot;Cadet&quot;, &quot;Captain&quot; or &quot;Space Ace&quot; for easy, medium and hard respectively; only by choosing the toughest skill level could the player see all the sequences in the game (only around half the scenes are played on the easiest setting). A number of the scenes had &quot;multiple choice&quot; moments when the player could select how to act, sometimes by deciding which way to turn in a passageway, or by choosing whether or not to react to the on-screen &quot;ENERGIZE&quot; message and transform back into his Ace form. Most scenes also have separate, horizontally flipped versions. Dexter usually progresses through scenes by avoiding obstacles and enemies, but Ace goes on the offensive, attacking enemies rather than running away; although Dexter does occasionally have to use his pistol on enemies when it is necessary to advance. An example can be seen in the first scene of the game, when Dexter is escaping from Borf&#x27;s robot drones. If the player presses the fire button at the right moment, Dexter transforms temporarily into Ace and can fight them, whereas if the player chooses to stay as Dexter, the robots&#x27; drill attacks must be dodged instead.

== Plot ==
&quot;Space Ace&quot; follows the adventures of the dashing hero Dexter, better known as &quot;Ace&quot;. Ace is on a mission to stop the villainous Commander Borf, who is seeking to attack Earth with his &quot;Infanto Ray&quot; to render Earthlings helpless by reverting them into infants. At the start of the game, Ace is partially hit by the Infanto Ray, which reverts him into an adolescent, and Borf kidnaps his female sidekick Kimberly, who thus becomes the game&#x27;s damsel in distress. It is up to the player to guide Ace, in his adolescent form of Dexter, through a series of obstacles in pursuit of Borf, in order to rescue Kimberly and prevent Borf from using the Infanto Ray to conquer Earth. However, Dexter has a wristwatch gadget which optionally allows him to &quot;ENERGIZE&quot; and temporarily reverse the effects of the Infanto-Ray, to turn him back into Ace for a short time and overcome more difficult obstacles in a heroic manner. The game&#x27;s attract mode introduces the player to the story via narration and dialogue.

== Voices ==
* Will Finn as Dexter/Baby Borf
* Jeff Etter as Ace
* Lorna Cook as Kimberly
* Don Bluth as Borf/Aliens/Dark Side Dexter/Dark Side Ace
* Michael Rye as Narrator

== Development ==
The animation for &quot;Space Ace&quot; was produced by the same team that tackled the earlier &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;, headed by ex-Disney animator Don Bluth. To keep the production costs down, the studio again chose to use its staff to provide voices for the characters rather than hire actors (one exception is Michael Rye, who reprises his role as the narrator of the attract sequence in &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;). Bluth himself provides the (electronically altered) voice of Commander Borf. In an interview about the game, Bluth stated that had the studio been able to afford more professional actors, he thought Paul Shenar would have been more suitable for the role of Borf than himself. The game&#x27;s animation features some rotoscoping, wherein models were built of Ace&#x27;s spaceship &quot;Star Pac&quot;, his motorcycle, and the tunnel in the game&#x27;s dogfight sequence, then filmed and traced over to render moving animated images with very realistic depth and perspective.

The game&#x27;s budget was $2.5 million.

=== Format ===
&quot;Space Ace&quot; was made available to distributors in two different formats: a dedicated cabinet, and a conversion kit that could be used to turn an existing copy of &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; into a &quot;Space Ace&quot; game. Early version #1 production units of the dedicated &quot;Space Ace&quot; game were actually issued in &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; style cabinets. The latter version #2 dedicated &quot;Space Ace&quot; units came in a different, inverted style cabinet. The conversion kit included the &quot;Space Ace&quot; laserdisc, new EPROMs containing the game program, an additional circuit board to add the skill level buttons, and replacement artwork for the cabinet. The game originally used the Pioneer LD-V1000 or PR-7820 laserdisc players, but an adaptor kit now exists to allow Sony LDP series players to be used as replacements if the original player is no longer functional.

== Ports ==
Numerous versions of &quot;Space Ace&quot; were created for home computers and game systems, most of which attempted to mimic the arcade version&#x27;s lushly animated hand-drawn footage, with varying degrees of success. Along with the floppy disk-based versions for Amiga, Apple IIGS, Atari ST, MS-DOS and Macintosh, ReadySoft issued a CD-ROM version featuring downsampled video for MS-DOS and Macintosh which preserved almost all of the original laserdisc content. A sequel, &quot;Space Ace II: Borf&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, was created and shipped on floppy disk for the aforementioned computer platforms mixing new animation with scenes from the original game that were left out of the previous version due to large file sizes.

In 1991, Leland Corporation released a slightly updated version of &quot;Space Ace&quot; in the form of a conversion kit for the then recently released &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair II: Time Warp&quot;. The updated version added more complicated moves (including diagonal moves), and dropped the easier skill levels, meaning only the &quot;Ace&quot; (difficult) level could be played.

In 1993, &quot;Space Ace&quot; was released for the Philips CD-i (Compact Disc Interactive). It was later released on the Sega CD in 1994.

&quot;Space Ace&quot; was also released for the SNES by Absolute Entertainment in 1994 under the same name. However, since a SNES cartridge has limited storage, it ended up being a top-down perspective action game with levels based on the scenes from the original. In order to see the credits, the player must get an &quot;Ace&quot; rank on every level, meaning that they must have near-perfect accuracy and collect all the disks found throughout the game.

&quot;The Dragon&#x27;s Lair Deluxe Pack&quot; released by Digital Leisure in 1997 featured &quot;Space Ace&quot; along with both arcade &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; games. They also released a version of &quot;Space Ace&quot; on DVD that could be played on most DVD players, although it lacked the skill level select of the arcade version, and also played somewhat differently (if the player made a mistake on the arcade version they simply picked up again roughly where they left off, whereas the DVD version made the player replay the entire scene from the beginning).

DAPHNE, an emulator for laserdisc based games, can emulate both the original and 1991 versions. It requires the ROM files plus the original laserdisc to run. Alternatively, an MPEG-2 video stream and Ogg Vorbis audio stream can be substituted for the laserdisc. These streams can be generated from the original laserdisc or from Digital Leisure&#x27;s DVD.

As with &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;, a comic book miniseries incorporating elements from both the game and its &quot;Saturday Supercade&quot; version (such as Ace randomly changing into Dexter and back, instead of &quot;energizing&quot; back into Ace) was released in 2003 by Crossgen Publishing.

In the December 2003 issues of &quot;PSW&quot; (&quot;PlayStation World&quot;) and &quot;XBW&quot; (&quot;Xbox World&quot;), a free disk was given away with the magazine featuring &quot;Space Ace&quot; on one side (accompanied by trailers for similar games), and trailers for upcoming games on the other.

In May 2009, the game was made available on iOS.

In October 2010, &quot;Space Ace&quot; appeared on Wii as part of the &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair Trilogy&quot;, which also features &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; and &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair II: Time Warp&quot;. It was later released as DSiWare in North America on December 6 and in the PAL region on December 31.

The PlayStation 3 port by Digital Leisure was released through the PlayStation Network on February 22, 2011.

An Android port of the game was released on December 28, 2012, via Google Play.

In August 2013, the game was made available through Steam.

In July 2015, Rebecca Heineman released the source code from a reverse engineered Apple IIGS version (dating back from 1990) on GitHub.

There is a compilation sold on the PlayStation Store also called &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair Trilogy&quot;, which contains the original &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;, &quot;Space Ace&quot;, and &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair II: Time Warp&quot; as a set.

&quot;Space Ace&quot; appeared on Nintendo Switch as part of the &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair Trilogy&quot; (a possible port of the Wii release), which also features &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; and &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair II: Time Warp&quot; in January 2019.

An NES version of &quot;Space Ace&quot; was developed, but never released.

In July/August 2022, Brutal Deluxe developed and released an improved version of the existing Space Ace port, as well a new port of Space Ace II: Borg&#x27;s Revenge, for the Apple IIGS (the latter reportedly completed in 1991 by ReadySoft, but never released)

== Reception ==
In the United Kingdom, it was the top-selling CD-i game in April 1994.

The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the CD-i version a 7.75 out of 10. They described it as a &quot;pixel perfect&quot; conversion of the arcade game, though they criticized that the game lacks replay value.

In their review of the Sega CD version, &quot;GamePro&quot; gave the game an overall score of 3.9 out of 5, remarking that the game &#x27;unfortunately highlights the color bleeding of the Sega CD&#x27;, but praised the story, voicing, and music, and concluded &quot;&quot;Space Ace&quot; is great for animation buffs or gamers who enjoyed &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave the Sega CD version two out of five stars, criticizing the game&#x27;s story as &quot;juvenile&quot; and the gameplay as &#x27;overly limited&#x27;: &quot;The only way to beat any of the game&#x27;s 13 stages is to play through it over and over until your reactions are automatic. You could surely train a monkey to do the same thing&quot;.

A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave the PC version two out of five stars, commenting that &quot;Don Bluth&#x27;s LaserDisc classic remains an entertaining cartoon attached to the antithesis of interactivity. ... &quot;Space Ace&quot; does manage to come out looking and sounding almost exactly like the original arcade adventure, but in the end, that&#x27;s not necessarily a good thing&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the game a B− and wrote that &quot;&quot;Space Ace&quot; is part of a unique genre of CD games, the so-called decision point disc, in which, instead of controlling your character&#x27;s every movement, you respond to specific threats. But &quot;Space Ace&quot; is a mixed blessing at best. It features terrific Don Bluth animation and an amusing plot involving the evil Commander Borf and his Infanto Ray. On the other hand, thanks to very tricky timing, it&#x27;s such a frustrating experience you may want to turn the disc into a Frisbee&quot;. Power Unlimited reviewed the cd-i version and game the game a 91% summarizing: &quot;In this eye-catching interactive cartoon you do not control a character, but the course of events. However, you have to be almost supernaturally fast, because you hardly have time to make a choice. Unique, but only suitable for speed freaks.&quot;

== Legacy ==
=== Sequel ===
Space Ace II: Borf&#x27;s Revenge is a continuation of the home computer version of &quot;Space Ace&quot;, mostly featuring content that could not fit in available storage space on said version. It was released for Amiga, Atari ST, MS-DOS and Macintosh in 1991. An Apple IIGS port was also completed, but never released (detailed IIGS loading instructions appear in the manual for the other ports).
A new Apple IIGS conversion was developed and released by Brutal Deluxe in 2022, based on the DOS version.

=== Other media ===
A short-lived cartoon series based on &quot;Space Ace&quot; was produced in 1984 as part of the &quot;Saturday Supercade&quot; cartoon block (which was composed of animated shorts based on then-current video games) with Ace voiced by Jim Piper, Dexter voiced by Sparky Marcus, Kimberly voiced by Nancy Cartwright, and Commander Borf voiced by Arthur Burghardt. Twelve &quot;Space Ace&quot; episodes were produced.

<doc id="870501" wikidata="Q1185745" url="?curid=870501" title="The Xindi">
<text>&quot;The Xindi&quot; is the 53rd episode of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, the first episode of the third season. It first aired on September 10, 2003, on UPN. The episode was written by executive producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, and directed by Allan Kroeker.

Set in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;, registration NX-01. Beginning with this episode, season three of &quot;Enterprise&quot; features an ongoing storyline following an attack on Earth by previously unknown aliens called the Xindi at the end of season two. In this episode, the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; attempt to track down the location of the Xindi homeworld by asking a lone Xindi enslaved in a mining colony. After being tricked by the mining foreman, Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) and Commander Charles &quot;Trip&quot; Tucker III (Connor Trinneer) escape with the Xindi, with assistance from Lieutenant Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating) and the ship&#x27;s new Military Assault Command Operations (MACO) team.

&quot;The Xindi&quot; saw the first appearance of several new sets, as well as a new costume for Sub-Commander T&#x27;Pol (Jolene Blalock). The episode saw a large number of guest stars, including several who would recur several more times during the third season such as Major Hayes played by Steven Culp, Tucker Smallwood as the Xindi-Primate Councilor and Randy Oglesby as Degra. The episode received ratings of 2.6/5 percent according to Nielsen Media Research, and was watched by 4.1 million viewers. &quot;The Xindi&quot; received a mixed reception from critics, who praised the increase of action promised for the season by this episode but criticised elements such as the writing and the MACOs.

==Plot==
As &quot;Enterprise&quot; travels deeper into the Delphic Expanse, a secret council of aliens discuss what to do with the lone human spaceship. Meanwhile, Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) directs &quot;Enterprise&quot; to a mining penal colony within the Expanse. He then strikes a deal with the mine&#x27;s foreman (Stephen McHattie): in exchange for a half-liter of liquid platinum, Archer and Commander Charles &quot;Trip&quot; Tucker III (Connor Trinneer) will be allowed to meet a Primate worker named Kessick (Richard Lineback).

Archer requests the coordinates of Xindus, the Xindi homeworld, from Kessick (who reveals that he is one of five Xindi species). But the alien refuses to help unless Archer helps him escape. Archer declines, but he soon learns that the foreman had ulterior motives, since he has ordered three warships to overpower &quot;Enterprise&quot; and enslave his crew. Kessick claims to know how to escape the mine, but asks for Archer&#x27;s help in return for guiding the Starfleet officers. Archer reluctantly agrees, and Kessick leads him and Tucker through the mine&#x27;s sewage removal system. However, the group is soon detected in a conduit, and the foreman floods the system with plasma in an effort to kill them. They narrowly escape being killed, but quickly fall into the hands of the mine&#x27;s security forces.

Meanwhile, Sub-Commander T&#x27;Pol (Jolene Blalock) persuades Lieutenant Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating) to allow the newly assigned MACOs (Military Assault Command Operations) to attempt an extraction. Led by him, they perform remarkably well in combat, and manage to rescue Archer, Tucker, and Kessick. &quot;Enterprise&quot; then leaves orbit just as the warships arrive. Kessick dies, but not before providing coordinates for the Xindi homeworld. When the ship reaches this position, there is nothing but a 120-year-old field of space debris.

== Character development ==

&quot;Vulcan Neuro-Pressure&quot; becomes a routine &quot;Enterprise&quot; activity beginning with this episode and provides the structure for the ongoing development of the &quot;Trip&#x27;Pol&quot; (Trip + T&#x27;Pol) relationship, further sexualizing both actor Blalock and her character T&#x27;Pol as she appears topless alone in the same room with Trip. As noted previously, Trip can&#x27;t sleep because he is haunted by his sister&#x27;s death. Quantum anomalies from The Expanse (which will be explored throughout Season 3 in general and in the next episode in particular) are disturbing T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s ability to sleep as well. Vulcan Neuro-Pressure (VNP) can release mental stresses and allow sleep probability to increase. Because of these weaknesses, the two agree to &quot;treat&quot; each other.

==Production==
The episode followed up on the plot introduced in the final instalment of the second season in which a probe from an unknown alien species attacks Earth. A number of new sets and costumes were required, with preparations beginning for some departments up to three weeks before filming began. One change which was made was a new outfit for T&#x27;Pol, with costume tests taking place a week in advance of filming. The redesign was due to studio executives wanting the show to appeal more to the 18–49 male demographic. The production team looked to emulate the mid-series boost that the introduction of Seven of Nine provided on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. Kate O&#x27;Hara of &quot;New York Magazine&quot; later chided in reference to the change, &quot;Women of the future will certainly choose to wear tight, uncomfortable, skin-tight catsuits!&quot;

&quot;The Xindi&quot; was seen as a new pilot by executive producers Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, who also wrote the episode. Braga said: &quot;We were re-establishing an &quot;Enterprise&quot; that was going to be a little bit different this year, so we had to think of it in those terms.&quot; They felt the best way to do this was to immediately reveal the Xindi to the audience, and to give the MACOs something to do in order to introduce them. He called it a &quot;big episode&quot; as they sought to set up the rest of season. The shoot began on June 26, 2003, taking nine days instead of the usual seven to complete. One of the special effects used ground Styrofoam, which had been dyed blue and processed through a wood chipper, to represent the mineral Trellium-D. The Styrofoam particles stuck to the actors&#x27; shoes and costumes and ended up being spread throughout the Paramount lot where the series was filmed. It would turn up in unexpected places on set for the rest of the series, and was found in among the sets as they were being dismantled after the end of season four.

===Guest cast===
&quot;The Xindi&quot; featured several actors who would reappear throughout the season. These included the MACO marines under the command of Major Hayes, played by Steven Culp, in his first of five episodes. At the time of his appearance in &quot;The Xindi&quot;, he felt that he did not have any characterisation to work with. During the production of his second episode, &quot;The Shipment&quot;, Culp read an article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; about a troubled youth who joined the military and in serving in the Iraq War had found himself. After discussing it with the director, this became the basis for the character. Daniel Dae Kim made his first of three appearances as Corporal Chang; he had previously appeared as Gotana-Retz in the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Blink of an Eye&quot;. Nathan Anderson had previously appeared as Namon in the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Nemesis&quot;; he made one further appearance as Sergeant Kemper in the following episode, &quot;Anomaly&quot;.

Other actors included the members of the Xindi council. As with Kim and Anderson, Tucker Smallwood had already appeared on &quot;Voyager&quot;, as Admiral Bullock in the episode &quot;In the Flesh&quot;. He appeared as his Xindi character nine times during the third season of &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Randy Oglesby, who played Degra, was another &quot;Voyager&quot; alumnus. He had appeared as Kir in the episode &quot;Counterpoint&quot;. Rick Worthy had appeared as several different characters in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, including an appearance in the 1998 film &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot;. As well as Kornan in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Soldiers of the Empire&quot;, he too had appeared in &quot;Voyager&quot;, but in two roles; first as the androids 3947 and 122 in &quot;Prototype&quot; and then as Noah Lessing in &quot;Equinox&quot;. In addition, making a return to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise was Stephen McHattie, who had previously appeared as the Romulan senator Vreenak in the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;The Xindi&quot; was first aired in the United States on UPN on September 10, 2003. According to Nielsen Media Research, it received a 2.6/5 percent share among adults. This means that it was seen by 2.6 percent of all households, and 5 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was estimated that &quot;The Xindi&quot; was watched by 4.1 million viewers. The following episode, &quot;Anomaly&quot;, received the same rating but the viewer number increased by 200,000.

Robert Bianco reviewed &quot;The Xindi&quot; for &quot;USA Today&quot;, giving it two out of four stars. He said that while the Xindi storyline &quot;does promise to provide more action and excitement&quot;, some of the alterations &quot;smack[ed] of desperation&quot;. He called T&#x27;Pol &quot;Seven of Vulcan&quot;, and said the main issue with the series was the &quot;subpar&quot; writing. In this episode, he felt that Tucker was written so poorly that Trineer seemed like he was overacting to compensate for it.
Rob Owen of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; described the new season as &quot;less boring&quot;, he appreciated the faster pace than most episodes &quot;but it does trip over itself&quot;, but criticized the incomprehensible aliens and ridiculous seduction scene between T&#x27;Pol and Trip.

&quot;IGN&quot; gave it one out of five, and said it was &quot;like watching a television episode made up of all the things from the &#x27;Stuff We&#x27;ve Tried That Doesn&#x27;t Work on &quot;Star Trek&quot;″ list.&quot; Criticism was directed at the introduction of the MACOs, which were described as &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; clones, and at the modification to the theme tune. The Xindi themselves were described as &quot;bad &quot;Farscape&quot; knock offs&quot;, and the reviewer said that they set a poor tone for the rest of the season. &quot;Aint It Cool News&quot; gave it 2.5 out of five, and wrote: &quot;This is easily the most mundane and haphazardly constructed of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; season openers.&quot; Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation said she was of a &quot;double mind&quot; about &quot;The Xindi&quot; as there were both good and bad elements. She praised the action sequences, the make-up and McHattie as the alien foreman. Green enjoyed the twist at the end with the Xindi homeworld being already destroyed, and felt that the Xindi species could be interesting if developed well. She wondered if the writers had learned at all from past mistakes, as the show was still not doing a good job with the dramatic tension among characters. She said the guest Xindi was given &quot;more personality, wit and depth than any of these new semi-regulars&quot; and feared the MACO&#x27;s would not get the character development they would need, as it still had not happened for Mayweather after two seasons.

==Novelization==
&quot;The Xindi&quot; was adapted as a novel in conjunction with the preceding episode, &quot;The Expanse&quot;, by J.M. Dillard. Entitled &quot;The Expanse&quot;, the book was published by Pocket Books in trade paperback format in October 2003.

==Home media release==
The first home media release of &quot;The Xindi&quot; was as part of the season three DVD box set, released in the United States on September 27, 2005. The Blu-ray release of &quot;Enterprise&quot; was released on January 7, 2014.

<doc id="870505" wikidata="Q839262" url="?curid=870505" title="Xidan">
<text>Xidan (Chinese: ; Pinyin: Xīdān) is a major traditional commercial area in Beijing, China. It is located in the Xicheng District.

The Xidan commercial district incorporates the Xidan Culture Square, North Xidan Street, as well as many supermarkets and department stores. The Xidan Cultural Square is the largest venue for cultural events with shopping nearby in downtown Beijing.

==Area==
Xidan occupies around 80 hectares (197.7 Acres) within the Xicheng District.

==Name==

The name Xidan (literally, &quot;West Single&quot;) came from the paifang that existed on one of the streets there. In this context, the name &quot;Xidan&quot; refers to the single () paifang that existed on the west side () of the city.

The paifang was rebuilt in 2008, and now stands at the Xidan Culture Square.

==History==


Xidan began to develop in the Ming Dynasty as an area alongside the passage for traders from Southwestern China to enter Beijing. Restaurants and shops were eventually built for these merchants. Eventually, as the Western part of the city became the residential area for officials, Xidan became a commercial area. The location of several government agencies when Beijing was under the administration of the Republic of China also helped Xidan&#x27;s economic growth.

The area began to experience massive growth in the 1950s, as the population of Beijing began to move westwards. By the 1970s, Xidan, along with Qianmen and Wangfujing, became the three major commercial areas in Beijing.

Currently, the area is known throughout Beijing as a shopping area. Many malls and department stores have stores within the area, the oldest of which is the China branch of the Taiwanese department store Chungyo.

Xidan is also home to Lingjing Alley, which, at 32m (34 yards), is considered to be the broadest hutong in Beijing.

===Xidan Wall===

Xidan Wall, also called Democracy Wall, is a long brick wall on Xidan Street. Erected in 1978, the event is generally recognized as the beginning of the Beijing Spring. Xidan Wall played a significant role in the democracy movement in Beijing during the summer of 1979. It was at that time where the wall received a significant number of posters that criticized China&#x27;s leaders. Even an award-winning Canadian journalist John Fraser put up his own &quot;dazibao,&quot; whose notice about a lost gold signet ring that concluded in vague political sentiment bizarrely resulted in his addressing the 1979 summer masses in Tiananmen Square. However, by December 1979, Beijing&#x27;s municipal government banned the posting of wall posters on Xidan Wall in an attempt to curtail the democracy movement. The municipal government instead allowed allow posters on a site within Yuetan Park, a small park located in Beijing, but required registration with the city and an agreement to be &quot;held responsible for political and legal implications of their messages.&quot; Eventually, the most widely regarded poster writer for Xidan Wall, Wei Jingsheng, was sent to prison.

==Transportation==

The area is served by Xidan station, which is an interchange between Line 1 and Line 4 of the Beijing Subway system. In addition, many Beijing Bus lines serve the area.

==Government and infrastructure==
The Chinese Ministry of Education is headquartered in , Xidan.

==Education==
Beijing Xidan Primary School (S: 北京市西单小学, P: &quot;Běijīng Shì Xīdān Xiǎoxué&quot;) serves Xidan. The school&#x27;s predecessor was a private school, Jiemin Primary School (洁民小学), established in 1934. The Ministry of Education took control in 1953. In 1958 Jiemin merged with Xidan Toutiao Primary School (西单头条小学) and Baimiao Primary School (白庙小学). The school received its current name in August 2002.

==Future==

The Chinese Government has targeted Xidan in its 11th Five Year Plan, which is scheduled to conclude by 2010, with a stated mission of improving the area&#x27;s environment, as well as diversifying the genre of stores that open in the area. Portions of the plan were already completed in the run up to the 2008 Olympic Games.

<text>LaGrange College is a private college in LaGrange, Georgia. Founded in 1831 as a female educational institution, LaGrange is the oldest private college in Georgia. It is affiliated with the United Methodist Church and offers more than 55 academic and pre-professional programs, including graduate degrees in education.

==History==

On December 26, 1831, the charter for LaGrange Female Academy was granted by the Georgia Legislature. Most of the Creek Indians had been removed from the LaGrange area six years before and relocated to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. At the time, the only other college in the state was Franklin College, now the University of Georgia.

The college began as a women&#x27;s academy (high-school level), housed in a large white building down the street from where the current campus was developed. A few years later, in 1851, the institution moved to its present location on &quot;the Hill,&quot; the highest geographical point in the city of LaGrange.

In 1847, the school was renamed as LaGrange Female Institute, and the charter was amended to allow the school the power to confer degrees. The name was changed to LaGrange Female College in 1851, with the adoption of a four-year curriculum.

The Georgia Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church South took ownership of the college in 1856. Today, it is an institution of the North Georgia Conference of the United Methodist Church.

As discussions continued about admitting men, LaGrange Female College became LaGrange College in 1934. In 1953, the institution&#x27;s Board of Trustees officially made it coeducational.

The size of the campus doubled in 1992 thanks to the donation of land and facilities from the Callaway Foundation, which included Callaway Auditorium, Callaway Education Building, six tennis courts, two softball fields, sites for Cleaveland Baseball Field and the soccer field, and a swimming pool that was converted into Charles D. Hudson Natatorium in 1995.

==Academics==

The college offers more than 55 academic and pre-professional programs. Students may earn a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music, and a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. A Master of Arts degree in Teaching, a Master of Education degree in Curriculum and Instruction, and a Specialist in Education degree in Curriculum and Instruction also are offered.

LaGrange operates on the modified (4-1-4) semester system for day classes, which provides for fall and spring semesters, separated by a January Interim Term. There is an evening session during the regular year and in the summer. In addition, LaGrange College began offering online courses in the Spring 2013 term.

===Servant Scholars Program===
Begun in the fall of 2012, the Servant Scholars Program is exclusively for juniors and seniors who have demonstrated high academic achievement, engagement, and leadership on campus. Living and serving locally, these students partner in building a stronger and healthier community.

The program is housed in the newly renovated Broad Street Apartments, a local landmark built in 1936 and located halfway between the campus and downtown LaGrange. Among the only apartments in the city at the time, they filled a vital housing gap and provided a first home for many families.

After falling into disrepair, the apartments were purchased by Callaway Foundation, Inc., in December 2009. The foundation funded their renovation, and the work was completed by Batson-Cook Co. of West Point. The property was turned over to the college in the spring of 2012.

===Evening classes===
Students enrolled in Business Administration or Human Development programs normally attend classes on Monday through Thursday evenings. Students may enroll in September, January, or March. Students in the above programs also may earn a minor in Sociology, Psychology or Human Resource Management.

Transfer students with 60 hours of acceptable credit are eligible to apply for enrollment in the Degree Completion Programs in Public Health or Health and Human Services. Classes in the 23-month cohort programs are scheduled one night per week.

Evening College offers four degrees:
* Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration
* Bachelor of Arts in Health and Human Services
* Bachelor of Arts in Human Development
* Bachelor of Arts in Public Health

===Accreditation===
LaGrange College is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Business Administration, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Master of Education, Master of Arts in Teaching, the Specialist in Education degree in Curriculum and Instruction, and the Master of Arts in Organizational Leadership.

LaGrange College is also approved by the United Methodist University Senate. It has membership in the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities and the Georgia Foundation for Independent Colleges.

LaGrange College&#x27;s teacher education (undergraduate and graduate) programs are accredited by the Georgia Professional Standards Commission to recommend candidates for certification in the areas of early childhood, middle grades or secondary education.

The Bachelor of Science in Nursing program is accredited by the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission.

The undergraduate programs in business administration, business management, and accounting are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP).

==Campus==
The LaGrange campus blends historic and contemporary buildings on roughly 120 acres in the heart of LaGrange, Georgia.

===Smith Hall===

Smith Hall, also known as College Home, is the oldest building on the campus. The main portion of the building was constructed in 1860 of handmade brick formed from local clay. Smith Hall served as a hospital for wounded soldiers during the Civil War. An addition was built in 1887. Smith Hall was named in memory of Mrs. Oreon Mann Smith, wife of former college president Rufus Wright Smith, who served from 1885 until he died in 1915. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 26, 1982.

A major renovation was completed in 1989 at a cost of more than $2.5 million. The building now houses offices, classrooms, and seminar rooms. It is located at coordinates | ///dimes.dividends.schoolwork.

===Other campus structures===
Broad Street Apartments
Originally constructed in 1936 and fully renovated in 2012, the Broad Street Apartments, located two blocks east of the main campus and presented to the college as a gift from the Callaway Foundation, Inc., now house the Servant Scholars Program.

Callaway Auditorium
Built in 1941, Callaway Auditorium was originally designed as a multipurpose venue. It served in that capacity for more than half a century. Though versatile, the facility was severely limited in its ability to provide an accommodation that was greatly needed by the community and LaGrange College: an acoustically pleasing music performance venue. The demand for such a facility was satisfied in 2005 with the auditorium&#x27;s transformation into a state-of-the-art concert hall.

Callaway Education Building
Built in 1965, renovated in 1994, and given a $2 million, 17,000-square-foot addition in 2006, the building houses the music program, offices of intercollegiate and intramural athletics, offices of health and physical education, a weight room, an athletic training room, and a football locker room.

Cason J. Callaway Science Building
Built in 1972, this three-story brick building provides for instruction in biology, chemistry, math, and physics.

Fuller E. Callaway Academic Building
Completed in 1981 and renovated in 2000, the Fuller E. Callaway Academic Building houses the History, Political Science, and Psychological Science programs and the Department of Nursing.

The Chapel
The materials used in the construction of the Chapel in 1965 link it with Christian worship in LaGrange and other parts of the world. Included in the structure are two stained glass windows made in Belgium more than 100 years ago; a stone from the temple of Apollo at Corinth, Greece; a stone from the Benedictine Monastery in Iona, Scotland; and a stone from St. George&#x27;s Chapel in Windsor, England.
Lamar Dodd Art Center
Completed in 1982 and fully renovated and modernized in 2011, this building provides a physical environment and the equipment needed for art instruction as well as gallery space for the college&#x27;s art collection. The building is named in honor of the late Lamar Dodd, a Georgia artist who grew up in LaGrange and whose paintings won international recognition.

Frank and Laura Lewis Library
January 2009 saw the opening of the 45,000-square-foot Frank and Laura Lewis Library at LaGrange College. Named for two former librarians, the facility includes numerous small-and-large-group study rooms; a 24-hour study room with a coffee bar/snack bar area; an auditorium; a multi-media classroom; a multi-media production center; student and faculty research carrels; and state-of-the-art audio-visual equipment.

The print and electronic collections in the library support the curriculum and general information needs of students and faculty. Included are more than 200,000 printed and electronic books, an excellent reference collection, a large DVD and CD collection, and numerous full-text databases for all academic disciplines. Notable digital collections include JSTOR, Project Muse, the Archive of Americana, the Burney 17th and 18th Century British Newspapers, the London Times Digital Archives, PsycArticles, MathSciNet, ATLAS Religion Database, CINAHL, ReferenceUSA, Access World News, plus many more in addition to the various databases available through GALILEO.

Price Theater
Completed in 1975, this building features a 280-seat proscenium theater with 36 fly lines, eight electrics (including four beam positions over the auditorium), and a hydraulic orchestra pit. It also houses the Theatre Arts program, including faculty offices, a scenery workshop, dressing rooms, a costume shop, an actors&#x27; lounge, and a Black Box Theatre.

Sunny Gables Alumni House
Built by Mary and Julia Nix in 1925, Sunny Gables Alumni House is an outstanding example of early 20th-century Tudor Revival architecture. Designed by P. Thornton Marye, it is now part of the National Register of Historic Places&#x27; Vernon Road Historic District. This multipurpose facility serves as the permanent home for alumni. The facility extends entertainment space to the college&#x27;s constituents for specific programming purposes.

Turner Hall
Built in 1958 (not long after the institution became co-educational), this three-story brick building was first used to provide campus housing for men, and later, women. In 2003, the structure was renovated and enlarged. The Mabry Gipson Student Center features large and small meeting rooms, a student grill, and the Jones Zone on the first two floors. Student housing on the third floor is known as the William H. Turner Jr. Residence Hall.

==Student life==
LaGrange offers more than 50 student groups as part of its living/learning experience. Many students also participate in service efforts, Greek life, and spiritual life activities.

Overseen by Athletics, intramurals provide opportunities for recreation and competition among members of the campus community. Teams representing campus organizations and independents compete in organized tournaments and events throughout the year. Competitive events include flag football, volleyball, basketball, softball, dodge ball and Ultimate Frisbee. Special awards are presented to the men and women&#x27;s groups with the highest participation rates and best records of the entire year. In addition, male and female &quot;Athletes of the Year&quot; are selected.

Many opportunities are available for recreational use of the facilities in the LaGrange College Aquatics Complex: recreational swimming and lap swimming all year round in the indoor pool, as well as water aerobics or aqua exercise classes (non-credit). Students also enjoy the use of a weight-training room and a fitness area.

===Spiritual life===
Growing out of its history of service and its connection to the United Methodist Church, the college offers several opportunities for students, faculty, and staff members to celebrate life and explore God&#x27;s intention for human living through intellectual, social, and spiritual growth. The college employs two ministers to help students, faculty and staff to deepen their understanding of their faith as they engage in free intellectual inquiry.

==Athletics==

LaGrange College is a member of NCAA Division III and the Collegiate Conference of the South (CCS), formed in July 2022 by an amicable split of the previously 19-member USA South Athletic Conference. The college&#x27;s nickname is Panthers and its colors are red and black. Intercollegiate teams compete in women&#x27;s soccer, basketball, cross country, volleyball, softball, swimming, lacrosse, and tennis; and men&#x27;s baseball, football, lacrosse, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming, and tennis.

<text>:

The city of Atlanta, Georgia is made up of 243 neighborhoods officially defined by the city. These neighborhoods are a mix of traditional neighborhoods, subdivisions, or groups of subdivisions. The neighborhoods are grouped by the city planning department into 25 neighborhood planning units (NPUs). These NPUs are &quot;citizen advisory councils that make recommendations to the Mayor and City Council on zoning, land use, and other planning issues&quot;. There are a variety of other widely recognized named areas within the city. Some are officially designated, while others are more informal.

==Other areas==

In addition to the officially designated neighborhoods, many other named areas exist. Several larger areas, consisting of multiple neighborhoods, are not formally defined but commonly used. Most notable are Buckhead, Midtown, and Downtown. Other smaller examples exist, such as Little Five Points, which encompasses parts of three neighborhoods. Some of these regions may overlap, such as West Midtown, an area which includes several neighborhoods on the west side of the larger Midtown area.

Some of these areas are connected with community groups such as Midtown Alliance or Community improvement districts (CIDs) such as the Buckhead CID. While those organizations often have an associated definition of the areas they represent, those definitions may not be the same as the common usage. Less formally, some areas of the city are referred to by compass directions, such as Southwest Atlanta.

<text>William Winant (born 1953) is an American percussionist.

In addition to his work in contemporary classical music—notably performing Lou Harrison&#x27;s compositions—Winant has worked in a variety of genres, including noise rock, free improvisation and jazz. Notable collaborators include Glenn Spearman, Thurston Moore, Sonic Youth, Mr. Bungle (with whom he toured in support of their albums &quot;Disco Volante&quot; and &quot;California&quot;), Secret Chiefs 3, &quot;Mondo Cane&quot; and Oingo Boingo. A member of the Abel-Steinberg-Winant Trio, he has also frequently collaborated with John Zorn. He received a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award (2016).

Winant attended the California Institute of the Arts for a couple of years before dropping out to go tour with Oingo Boingo. He later received an undergraduate degree from York University before pursuing graduate work at Mills College in Oakland, California, where he is currently a faculty member. He also gives percussion lessons and teaches the percussion ensemble at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

<text>The Hunters Point Avenue station is a station on the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway. Located at 49th Avenue (formerly Hunters Point Avenue) and 21st Street in the intersections of Hunters Point and Long Island City, Queens, it is served by the train at all times and the &lt;7&gt; train during rush hours in the peak direction.

== History ==

As part of its development, what is now the Flushing Line was extended one stop East, from Vernon–Jackson Avenues, which opened in 1915, to Hunters Point Avenue on February 15, 1916. Later that year it would again be extended to Court Square–23rd Street station.

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The IRT routes were given numbered designations in 1948 with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The route from Times Square to Flushing became known as the 7. In 1949, the New York City Board of Transportation announced that the Flushing Line platforms would be lengthened to 11 IRT car lengths; the platforms were only able to fit nine 51-foot-long IRT cars beforehand. The platforms at the station were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. However, nine-car trains continued to run on the 7 route until 1962, when they were extended to ten cars.

== Station layout ==

This station is the easternmost (railroad north) underground station on the Flushing Line until the northbound terminal station (Flushing – Main Street). The tunnel portal is at the eastern end of the station. Just outside the portal is a diamond crossover linking the two tracks.

This station has two tracks and two side platforms. Its architecture is in an Italianate design of brown color. Tilework includes a trimline with &quot;HP&quot; tiles on it and name tablets reading &quot;HUNTERS POINT AVE.&quot; in gold serif font. The platform columns also have a trim line with &quot;HP&quot; tiles below them.

===Exits===

This station has one fare control area above the platforms and tracks near the north end. Two staircases from each platform go up to a waiting area/crossover, where a turnstile bank and several exit–only turnstiles provide access to and from the station. Outside fare control, there is a token booth and one staircase going up to the north side of 49th Avenue with 21st Street several hundred yards to the west. Two other staircases to the east go up to the north side of the same street and is near the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Hunterspoint Avenue station.

On October 29, 1982, a public hearing was scheduled concerning the planned closure of the entrance leading to the southeast corner of 49th Avenue and 21st Street as part of the New York City Transit Authority&#x27;s Station Modernization Program.

<text>Bulletism is an artistic process that involves shooting ink at a blank piece of paper. The result is a type of ink blot. The artist can then develop images based on what is seen. Salvador Dalí named this technique. Leonardo da Vinci, suggested that &quot;just as one can hear any desired syllable in the sound of a bell, so one can see any desired figure in the shape formed by throwing a sponge with ink against the wall.&quot;

<text>Gangte is an ethnic group residing predominantly in the Indian state of Manipur, as well as in parts of Mizoram, Assam, and Myanmar. Also part of the larger Zo people, and are recognized as a tribe in both Manipur and under the Indian Constitution. As of , their global population is estimated to be approximately 40,000. Their primary settlements in India are located in Churachandpur district of Manipur and in neighboring states, including Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Assam. The Gangtes predominantly use the Meitei language as their second language (L2).

==Naming System==
The Gangtes utilize a distinct naming system designed to preserve their history and ancestry, especially given the absence of written historical records. Grandparents name their grandchildren using the last syllable of their own names—e.g., Thangmang leads to Manglun, which becomes Lunkholal, which turns into Lalminlun, etc. Grandfathers name grandsons and grandmothers name granddaughters. The firstborn son and daughter typically are named after the paternal grandparents, while the secondborn children are named after the maternal grandparents. This system is prevalent among many of the Zo peoples.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department initially charged nine members of the group with 17 felony counts, but &quot;the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office declined to file charges against four youths, dropping 15 charges, concluding that the sexual encounters had occurred with the consent of the girls.&quot; National media attention of the case soon followed, and several members of the group went on talk shows to discuss the Spur Posse and its sexual values. Eventually, prosecutors controversially dropped all but one charge. One member of the group was convicted with lewd conduct with a minor under the age of 14 and spent less than a year in the Dorothy Kirby Center, a juvenile detention center in Commerce, CA.

== Members ==
The Spur Posse had an estimated membership of 20 to 30 individuals of the &quot;town&#x27;s best-looking, most-popular teen-agers.&quot; Only a handful have publicly claimed or have been identified as members of the Spur Posse:

* Dana Belman
* Kristopher Belman
* Christopher Albert
* Jimmy Rafkin
* Billy Shehan
* Christopher Russo
* Lonnie Rodriguez
* Kevin Howard
* Jeff Howard
* Shad Blackman
* Eric Richardson
* Mike Weber
* Dana Kawamura
* Ronnie Breceda

== Background ==

Dana Belman, a varsity football player and linebacker on Lakewood High School&#x27;s football team, initiated the creation of the clique, Spur Posse, in 1990. The group initially consisted of 14 members of the high school&#x27;s football team who would congregate after school to play basketball wearing San Antonio Spurs caps, naming themselves after their favorite team. The group&#x27;s leaders, brothers Dana and Kristopher Belman, devised a scoring system as a &quot;source of friendly competition among members&quot; that awarded &quot;one point for penetration, only one point allowed for each girl.&quot; One member, Billy Shehan, claimed to be the top scorer of the group, with 66 sexual encounters. Several of the Spurs were star athletes, &quot;powerful young men worshiped by peers and parents,&quot; who liked parties, football games and girls.

In March 1993, seven young women, including an 11-year-old, filed complaints against members of the Spur Posse, accusing them of sexual misconduct and assault over the span of 5 months in 1992. The Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department arrested eight youths and one 18-year-old, Kristopher Belman, for &quot;17 felony counts of rape, unlawful intercourse and related charges.&quot; According to investigators, &quot;the gang victimized perhaps scores of young women, using persuasion and threats to score &#x27;points&#x27; in their long-running game of conquests.&quot; One victim, a 16-year-old girl, told an investigator that &quot;a Spur had removed her clothes in a park during a sexual encounter, then refused to give them back until she had sex with other Spurs. She said her clothing was returned only after she screamed. She believes the commotion prevented a gang rape.&quot; Another victim had an abortion after being &quot;forced to have sex with several boys.&quot;

Members, friends and family of the Spur Posse defended themselves as a nonviolent group. Defenders of the group claimed that all their sexual encounters were consensual, calling one of the accusers &quot;a liar and a slut.&quot; The Los Angeles District Attorney office declined to file 15 of the 17 charges, pursuing only one of the boys &quot;for allegedly having sex with a 10-year-old girl.&quot; The district attorney&#x27;s office claimed that they could not prove the other charges, &quot;saying that the matter was a &quot;social&quot; problem better left to churches, schools and parents to handle.&quot; The other eight members were released less than a week later. Only one youth was convicted for lewd conduct with a minor under the age of 14, and served less than a year in a juvenile detention center for the crime. Kris Belman was charged with &quot;the alleged molestation of a 13-year-old girl&quot; but &quot;charges were dropped after he completed the informal probation.&quot; District Attorney, Sandy Buttitta, in a written statement wrote, &quot;Our conclusion is that there is no credible evidence of forcible rape involving any of these boys...Although there is evidence of unlawful sexual intercourse, it is the policy of this office not to file criminal charges where there is consensual sex between teen-agers...The arrogance and contempt for young women which have been displayed, while appalling, cannot form the basis for criminal charges.”

== In the media ==
When allegations against the Spur Posse came to light, a media frenzy surrounded the case. Members of the Spur Posse were invited to talk shows, interviewed for publications, and placed on covers of magazines. Appearances on national TV included The Jenny Jones Show, Night Talk With Jane Whitney, Maury, Nightline, The Montel Williams Show, Dateline, The Phil Donahue Show, Inside Edition and Home Show. They appeared on the front page of the New York Times and Newsweek and posed for Sassy, a teen girl&#x27;s magazine, and Penthouse. The local paper listed upcoming television appearances, under headlines as the Posse Premiere and The Spur Posse on TV.

TV show producers vied for the Spur Posse&#x27;s attention and plied them with paid trips to NYC. Billy Shehan reported to Newsweek that a senior staffer from Night Talk With Jane Whitney took them to a strip bar, Goldfingers, in a limo. The Maury Povich Show &quot;wooed the boys by sending them out for the evening with four young women from the program&#x27;s staff.&quot; When asked why they would be compelled to appear on TV, Billy Shehan, said &quot;You gotta get your image out there. It&#x27;s all about building that image on a worldwide basis.&quot; Many of the Spurs hoped that the exposure would offer them opportunities into acting, modeling, radio and comedy.

Some members of the group sought representation by talent agencies, but failed to secure any deals. Several agents said that they wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable profiting off alleged sexual assault crimes of minors. Jill Holwager, an agent of United Talent Agency, said, &quot;I would be using my skills to make these guys a lot of money and make them really famous, and I thought that was wrong.&quot;

== Public reaction ==

The scandal divided the community of Lakewood, with some condemning the actions of the group and others claiming that the situation was blown out of proportion. After the nine members were released from arrest, they returned to a &quot;hero&#x27;s welcome at school.&quot; Some students, both male and female, supported the Spurs&#x27; claim of innocence, saying that their accusers were &quot;willing participants who sought status by sleeping with athletes.&quot; A 15-year-old freshman girl remarked, “There are so many girls out there who want to sleep with these guys. They are so fine. They wouldn’t have to rape anyone.”

Detractors of the group were outraged when charges were dropped by the district attorney. Around 200 parents attended a meeting to condemn the Spur Posse claiming that &quot;the clique had terrorized the community, picking fights with male classmates and raping and threatening female students in a pattern that has escalated since the arrests.&quot; At the time, many of the parents of the accused Spurs were unperturbed by the accusations. Donald Belman, after the release of his son, Kristopher, from custody, said &quot;Nothing my boy did was anything any red-blooded American boy wouldn&#x27;t do at his age.&quot; Dottie Belman told a reporter, &quot;Those girls are trash,&quot; referring to the accusers. Diane Hurst, mother of a Spur, thought it was &quot;sad for the girls that they have such low self-esteem that they would do this...it&#x27;s a testosterone thing.&quot;

Under the glare of public scrutiny, Lakewood &quot;became identified with rampant promiscuity and familial dysfunction&quot; and gained the moniker of &quot;Rapewood&quot;. The sway the group had over the town prompted a larger discussion about sexual harassment and misogyny in American schools. The media characterized the behavior of the group as fueled by the sexual revolution of the &#x27;90s, &quot;aided and abetted by MTV and Hollywood violence.&quot; Rev. Ginny Wagener, executive director of the South Coast Ecumenical Council, did not view the Spurs as an isolated incident, stating that &quot;society promotes male dominance and sexual promiscuity. It&#x27;s in the culture.&quot; There was a pervasive &quot;boys will be boys&quot; mentality in the Spur Posse&#x27;s defense, that young men are &quot;incapable of bringing either responsibility or humanity to their sexual activity.&quot; One columnist, Clarence Page, wondered if the members of the Spur Posse were black, would they &quot;be viewed less with wonderment and titillation than with dismay, horror, embarrassment and lofty talk about &#x27;pathologies,&#x27; &#x27;the underclass&#x27; and responsibilities, personal and societal.&quot; Families of the Spur Posse were middle-class and privileged, and their values could not be &quot;blamed on poverty or discrimination.&quot; &quot;Misguided values&quot; allowed the Spur Posse to operate without fear of consequences through victim blaming of young women.

== Aftermath ==
Victims reported that they notified school officials of threats &quot;for months and walk the campus hallways in constant fear.&quot; In a news conference, Gloria Allred &quot;fired a warning shot at school officials by suggesting that they knew about at least one rape charge in December but took no action.&quot; Lakewood High Principal Mike Escalante said that students were being offered various options such as schedule changes or transfers. School officials also planned assemblies and forums to educate students about date rape and sexual harassment.

Burglary charges against a member of the Spur Posse surfaced as a result of the sexual allegations. After being invited to the homes of junior high school girls, authorities said Belman &quot;entered the girls’ parents’ bedroom and took credit cards, which he used&quot; in June 1992. Authorities also claimed that Belman stole 21 guns from a residence during a party. Belman and Christopher Russo were arrested in Las Vegas after attempting to use the stolen credit cards and detained again in December 1993 for forging checks. Dana Belman was sentenced to 10 years in prison for 13 burglary and fraud convictions in 1994.

A member of the Spur Posse was targeted in a racially motivated attack by a white supremacist group, Fourth Reich Skinheads. According to the prosecution, a juvenile set off a pipe bomb on one of the homes of a Spur member, &quot;chosen because it was owned by a black man, while the Spur Posse member allegedly was picked because he is part Mexican and part Asian.&quot;

Members of the group and some of their families were shunned by their community, unable to find employment because of their infamy and continued to have run-ins with the law. Christopher Albert, a member of the Spur Posse, was &quot;killed during rowdy Fourth of July celebrations in Huntington Beach&quot; in 1995. Albert was fatally shot by Esteban Quiroz during an argument. In 1996, Spur Posse members Dana Kawamura and Ronnie Breceda &quot;were arrested in connection with the near fatal stabbing of a young man at a New Year’s Eve party in Seal Beach. Kawamura and Breceda have been charged with attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon.&quot; Mike Weber spent time in jail for assault with a deadly weapon.

== In culture ==
Joan Didion wrote a celebrated article about the Spur Posse, titled &quot;Trouble in Lakewood&quot;, published as part of the &quot;Letter from California&quot; column in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on July 26, 1993. The article was also included in a different form in her 2003 book, &quot;Where I Was From&quot;. Didion&#x27;s essay detailed the dark side of California suburbia tying moral decay to the deterioration of economic opportunities. Gustavo Arellano, in an essay for The Los Angeles Times, writes that Didion &quot;unmasks the misogyny and racial animus of Lakewood’s white population.&quot;

The Spur Posse was covered at length in Susan Faludi&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;, including their formation, their fame and appearance on talk shows, and the aftermath. HBO planned to adapt the book &quot;into an anthology of one or perhaps two films dramatizing the stories of some of the men depicted in the book&quot; in 1999.

&quot;The X Files&quot; mentions the group in an episode, &quot;Red Museum.&quot; Fox Mulder, played by David Duchovny, says &quot;I think the Spur Posse just rode into town&quot; after seeing a group of hostile teenagers. Dana Scully, played by Gillian Anderson, later quips, &quot;kinda hard to tell who&#x27;s the villain without a score card.&quot;

In 1995, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; broadcast an episode, &quot;Performance&quot;, based upon the case.

The group was mentioned in Spin Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Soy Un Perdedor: The 50 Worst Moments of the ’90s&quot;.

The main villains in the 1999 horror film, &quot;The Rage: Carrie 2,&quot; were based on the Spur Posse.

Spur Posse is mentioned in the Bratmobile song Brat Girl.

A made for TV movie, &quot;Restless Virgins&quot;, recalls Spur Posse&#x27;s &quot;sex for points&quot; system that aired on Lifetime in 2013.

<text>The Vernon Boulevard–Jackson Avenue station (often informally referred to as Vernon–Jackson station; formerly Vernon–Jackson Avenues station) is a station on the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway, and the westernmost station on the Queens portion of the line. It is served by the 7 train at all times and the &lt;7&gt; train rush hours in the peak direction. Although there is a nearby intersection of Vernon Boulevard and Jackson Avenue, the station is located one block north of that intersection, on 50th Avenue, between Vernon Boulevard and Jackson Avenue, both of which have entrances to the station.

== History ==
The Dual Contracts were formalized in early 1913, specifying new lines or expansions to be built by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT). The Dual Contracts involved opening the Steinway Tunnel as part of the new Flushing subway line. The route was to go from Times Square in Manhattan, passing through the tunnel to Long Island City in Queens, then continuing toward Flushing from there. The tunnel, with trolley loops on both the Manhattan and Queens sides, had sat unused since 1907, when test runs had been performed in the then-nearly-complete tunnel. The Queens trolley loop was near Vernon Avenue (now Vernon Boulevard) in Long Island City.

The Vernon–Jackson Avenues station opened on June 22, 1915, as a terminal for shuttle trains going into Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel until the line was extended to Hunters Point Avenue on February 5, 1916. A westerly extension of the Manhattan-bound platform opened for service on December 20, 1923.

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The IRT routes were given numbered designations in 1948 with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The route from Times Square to Flushing became known as the 7. In 1949, the New York City Board of Transportation announced that the Flushing Line platforms would be lengthened to 11 IRT car lengths; the platforms were only able to fit nine 51-foot-long IRT cars beforehand. The platforms at the station were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. However, nine-car trains continued to run on the 7 route until 1962, when they were extended to ten cars.

In 1981, the MTA listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system.

===1997 station agent murder===
In 1997, this station was the site of a night station agent being killed for subway tokens. The result of this incident was a change in policy where night station agents do not have to empty the turnstiles after the evening station agent leaves unless police, a supervisor, or another employee is present (and that is left to the option of the station agent). Since the introduction of the MetroCard, this process remains the same. Two armed NYCT guards clear the vending machines.

==Station layout==


This underground station has two side platforms and two tracks. A black wall separates the two tracks for most of the station.

Both platforms have a line of yellow columns along their edges. Most of these are normal I-beam columns, but in the middle of the platforms, cream colored arches, which is also the color of the station&#x27;s ceiling, starting at about four feet off the ground support a short section of the columns. The platform walls have a mosaic gold and brown trim line on top while the name tablets are mosaic white with white text reading &quot;Vernon-Jackson Ave&#x27;s&quot; (erroneous if the use is considered in the possessive context, but it can also be considered as a contractional form of the plural) on a brown background and gold and brown border. There are also a few directional signs to the station&#x27;s fare control areas reading &quot;Vernon Ave&quot; or &quot;Jackson Ave&quot; with an arrow beneath.

===Exits===
Each platform has two same-level fare control areas and there are no crossovers or crossunders connecting the platforms. The full-time fare control areas are just west of the middle of the platforms, though only the Manhattan-bound platform still has a token booth. Each area has a small regular turnstile bank and two staircases to the street, the northeast corner of Vernon Boulevard and 50th Avenue for the Manhattan-bound platform and the southwest corner for the Flushing-bound platform. The southern staircase&#x27;s steel fencing does not have the standard black sign saying what station this is and what trains serve it.

Each platform also has a larger, unstaffed fare control on their extreme east (railroad north) ends. On the Manhattan-bound platform, a wide, but short staircase goes up to some High Entry/Exit Turnstiles that lead to two street stairs, one to each northern corners of 50th Avenue and Jackson Avenue. This entrance at one time had a part-time token booth and regular turnstiles. The Flushing-bound platform has a similar arrangement with short staircase to a wide intermediate landing with a full-height turnstile at each corner. Outside the turnstiles is a single street stair, each going up to each southern corners of 50th Avenue and Jackson Avenue.

<text>XIII (&quot;Thirteen&quot;) is a Belgian graphic novel series about an amnesiac who seeks to discover his past. It was created by writer Jean Van Hamme and artist William Vance. It is currently being written by Yves Sente and Youri Jigounov. The storyline of the first five volumes was adapted into a video game in 2003, also titled &quot;XIII&quot;, with a remake being released in 2020. A Canadian television film based on the series, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2008. It was followed in 2011 by two seasons of a TV series, each 13 episodes, called &quot;&quot;.

==Main characters==

*XIII: The title character suffers from total amnesia. He soon discovers that he is suspected of the assassination of President William Sheridan. Throughout the albums he tries to regain his memory and to find out the true facts surrounding the assassination of the president. Although his memory does not return, he gradually learns more about who he is. His real name is Jason Mullway. However, because he was adopted at a young age (after the death of his mother and the disappearance of his father) by Jonathan MacLane, a cousin of his father Sean Mullway, he officially bears the name Jason MacLane.

*General Benjamin (Ben) Carrington: He holds a senior military position in the Pentagon. He is convinced that XIII is innocent and he helps him regain his memory.

*Jones: She is Carrington&#x27;s assistant and she was also trained by him. As a permanent partner, she supports XIII everywhere. She is a skilled pilot, both for airplanes and helicopters. While she is still a lieutenant in the first stories, she has now risen to the rank of colonel.

*Mongoose: XIII&#x27;s arch-enemy is an assassin who fears nothing. Initially they call him Schreiner, because he is an apprentice to a Berlin carpenter, this is revealed in &quot;XIII Mystery&quot;: The Mongoose. He was hired by Number I to kill XIII. XIII lost his memory due to a bullet from the Mongoose.

*Colonel Amos: He had to solve the murder of William Sheridan and first suspected XIII, who was able to escape. After it became clear to him that XIII was innocent, he helped him instead of arresting him.

*Wally Sheridan: US President. His brother William was murdered by Steve Rowland on behalf of Number I.

*Betty Barnowski: a -now former- soldier who met XIII during an undercover mission and who has helped him regularly since then.

*Marquis De Préseau: an old, friendly French aristocrat who often comes to XIII&#x27;s aid. Through XIII he met Betty Barnowski, with whom he has been in a relationship ever since.

*Felicity Brown: a dangerous opportunist who does not shy away from violence to get her way. Rather coincidentally, her path crosses that of XIII several times, and they get in each other&#x27;s way.

*Stephen G. Dundee: Appears only in the 13th album. It is remarkable that he plays a role in both XIII and another comics series, Largo Winch.

==Volumes 1–5==
The series begins with a amnesiac man awakening to find himself washed ashore in the East Coast. The only clues to his past are a tattoo of the Roman numerals &quot;XIII&quot; on his collarbone and a photo of himself with a woman, who is identified as Kim Rowland, widow of US Army captain Steve Rowland. Volumes 1 through 5 deal with &quot;XIII&quot; searching for his identity and past. He finds himself hunted by a contract killer, the &quot;Mongoose&quot;, who works for a mysterious organization known as XX, which aims to mount a coup against the US government. XIII is rescued from XX&#x27;s assassins by Colonel Amos of the FBI, who confronts XIII with video evidence that shows XIII assassinating the President.

In the second volume, XIII is captured by General Carrington and his aide, Lieutenant Jones. Carrington confirms that XIII is Rowland, and further explains that Rowland was a member of a special operations unit called Special Assault and Destroying Sections (SPADS). Carrington had been commander of SPADS when Rowland was supposedly killed in action two years earlier. Because XIII&#x27;s amnesia prevents him from identifying who sponsored the President&#x27;s assassination, Amos lets him go. XIII reunites with his father and his uncle, but they are both murdered by XIII&#x27;s young, gold-digging stepmother Felicity, who frames him after harming herself. XIII escapes the police with Carrington&#x27;s help and meets Kim, an XX member known as &quot;XVII&quot;, who reveals that XIII is not Steve Rowland. XIII is arrested by the police and Kim disappears. XIII is found guilty for the murders and sent to a maximum security prison.

The third volume finds Amos, still pursuing his investigation, realizing that XIII was a body double for the real Steve Rowland. Amos requests Carrington&#x27;s help to identify people who have been trained as top-level special operators and match XIII&#x27;s physique; Amos&#x27;s aim is to discover XIII&#x27;s true identity. Carrington provides the papers of about twenty people. One, named Ross Tanner, has been missing for two years. Amos decides to leave XIII in prison to have his amnesia treated. The treatment fails, and the Mongoose tries to have XIII killed in the prison. Carrington helps XIII break out.

Volume four begins with Amos finding that Carrington had invented the Tanner identity and suspecting him of being part of the conspiracy to kill the President. XIII, under the name of Ross Tanner, has been hidden by Carrington in a SPADS training facility in the fictitious Latin American country of San Miguel. Amos continues to delve into the files and learns that Rowland was murdered shortly after the assassination. Amos now assumes that Rowland was the real assassin, and is confused about XIII&#x27;s real role, but he exposes Judge Allenby, the head of the investigation, as one of the conspirators. Amos interrogates Allenby, who is killed by the Mongoose&#x27;s assassin; Amos himself is rescued by Kim. Meanwhile, a female SPADS Sergeant named Betty Barnowsky reveals to XIII that she saw Rowland in Eastown after his alleged death, in the company with SPADS Colonel Seymour McCall. XIII, Barnowsky, and Jones escape an assassination attempt by McCall but end up lost in the San Miguel jungle.

Kim takes Amos to Carrington and National Intelligence Director Carl Heideger, who reveal that, after faking his death in the helicopter crash, Rowland contacted Kim and forced her to be a member of the conspiracy. Kim, not sharing the conspiracy&#x27;s ideology, and herself a former secret agent, secretly alerted her former boss, Heideger. Despite having this information, however, Heideger was unable to prevent the assassination of the President. Rowland was shot by the Mongoose, but he escaped, mortally wounded, and died shortly after telling Kim what had happened. Heideger and Carrington then came up with a plan to make XX believe that Rowland had survived, hoping to attract the Mongoose&#x27;s killers, arrest them, and follow their trail to the conspirators. They sourced a man named Jason Fly who was transformed into a Rowland double, but soon after, Fly disappeared, when he was shot and lost his memory, just before the story began. Kim is also revealed to be Carrington&#x27;s daughter.

At the start of volume five, XIII, Jones, and Barnowsky kidnap the Marquis de Préseau, a rich French land owner in San Miguel, to steal his jet to fly back to the US. Meanwhile, Carrington and Heideger have been arrested by the conspirators as they prepare to take over the country during a large-scale military exercise. XIII and the women meet with Amos, who brings them into contact with Walter Sheridan, brother of the assassinated President and himself a candidate for presidency.

Sheridan helps XIII infiltrate the military&#x27;s center of operations, and, together with President Galbrain, manage to stop the conspiracy at the last moment. The entire conspiracy group, with the exception of the illustrious Number I, has been either killed or captured. Walter is elected President, and Kim remains missing for reasons unknown. At the end of the story, XIII believes he has found his old identity as Jason Fly and is prepared to continue his life normally, even if his memories have not yet returned.

==Volumes 6–8==
In the following volumes, XIII takes up the investigation about his past. Volumes six and seven bring XIII to Greenfalls, a snowy town in the Rocky Mountains, where the story revolves around the fate of his father in the McCarthian 1950s. XIII learns that his father, Jonathan Fly, was murdered by the local Klansmen after they found out Fly&#x27;s real identity was Jonathan McClane, a &quot;red&quot; journalist who had to flee after suffering under McCarthy&#x27;s witch hunt. The Mongoose still tracks XIII with the blessing of McClane&#x27;s assassins, but XIII evades the manhunt, gets justice for the murder of his father and manages to arrest the Mongoose, who reveals that he was on Number I&#x27;s boat when he shot the bullet that made XIII amnesic, but divulges no further information about Number I. The story ends with XIII finally finding his true identity as Jason McClane.

In volume eight, XIII is approached by President Sheridan to become a special agent and is charged with finding Number I. The Mongoose escapes from custody. XIII tracks down Kim, guessing that she stayed in hiding because she knows Number I&#x27;s identity. He discovers that one of the boats close to the spot where he was found amnesic is Sheridan&#x27;s yacht. Meanwhile, Jones investigates further and discovers that Kim had a love child with Sheridan. After passing on this information to XIII, they become convinced that Sheridan was in fact Number I, and used the XX to have his brother killed and propel himself to the Presidency. Sheridan had the child kidnapped to force Kim to marry Rowland, to betray Jason when Heideger&#x27;s plan threatened to expose him as Number I, and have him lured onto his yacht where XIII was shot by the Mongoose. After trying to release Kim from an island where they believe she is sequestered, XIII and Jones, along with Kim, are caught by the Mongoose, who sinks Sheridan&#x27;s yacht with an explosive. XIII only manages to rescue Jones, and Kim is presumed dead.

XIII finally faces Sheridan, who has been exposed as Number I. XIII has no evidence or witness against him, however. Sheridan does not assassinate XIII to avoid a new investigation that might expose him, and XIII and Jones leave the country.

==Volumes 9–13==
In the following volumes, the action takes place in and around Costa Verde, a small fictional nation in Central America where XIII is led to believe he once led a revolution under the identity of &quot;El Cascador&quot;, although El Cascador is supposedly dead. XIII gets involved with revolutionary Maria de los Santos, who claims to have been his wife. In the tenth volume, after freeing her from a prison from which she was awaiting execution, she confirms that he is her husband.

During the revolution, XIII meets an Irish-American expat, Sean Mullway, who claims to be XIII&#x27;s real father and confirms that XIII is Jason McClane. The history of XIII&#x27;s Irish descent is revealed, and XIII learns that his mother was the sister of NSA Director Giordino, who accidentally murdered her. The Giordinos are revealed to be a Mafia family. At the end of the volume, XIII is offered amnesty by the US ambassador, who explains that XIII&#x27;s help is needed; Carrington has apparently gone insane.

In volume twelve, the corrupt President Sheridan is kidnapped by Carrington, who has learned that Sheridan ordered his daughter Kim&#x27;s death. Carrington and Amos have XIII and Jones capture the Mongoose to get further evidence against Sheridan. In a televised &quot;trial&quot;, Sheridan is revealed to the American public as Number I, with XIII and the Mongoose testifying. In the aftermath of the event, Sheridan kills the Mongoose, and Giordino accidentally kills Sheridan.

Volume thirteen, &quot;The XIII Mystery: The Investigation&quot;, is a special issue, where two journalists retrace the first twelve issues, clarifying and expanding the storyline.

==Volumes 14–20==
While in exile in Costa Verde, XIII and Mullway attempt to find a treasure hidden by their ancestors somewhere in Mexico. Giordino, meanwhile, fabricates evidence claiming that XIII is Seamus O&#x27;Neill, an IRA operative who trained under Fidel Castro. As O&#x27;Neill, XIII is wanted by the US government, but he again manages to escape. He also survives an assassination attempt by Irina Svetlanova, who has taken over the Mongoose&#x27;s operation. After many setbacks, the treasure is found and then lost again. Meanwhile, Giordino is removed from duty by the new President, who has received evidence from XIII and Mullway revealing that Giordino is not only connected to the Mafia but also that he killed Sheridan.

Volumes eighteen and nineteen are the last written by Van Hamme. Volume eighteen, &quot;The Irish Version&quot;, was drawn by Jean Giraud, otherwise known as Mœbius. It features as a story within the story, and it is referred to as part of the plot along with &quot;The XIII Mystery&quot; in volume nineteen &quot;The Last Round&quot;. This is the prequel to the initial story arc, and it resolves all mysteries surrounding XIII&#x27;s identity.

XIII has learned his identity, but his memories still have not returned. He seeks medical treatment to uncover them in volume twenty, but &quot;Mayflower Day&quot;, a secret organization, schemes to keep XIII from unblocking his memory, because of yet another secret in his past.

== A Journey Through Exile and Deception ==
While in exile in Costa Verde, XIII and his trusted ally Mullway embark on a perilous quest to recover a treasure hidden by their ancestors somewhere in Mexico. This journey is fraught with challenges, as fate throws curveballs at every turn. Meanwhile, the enigmatic Giordino manipulates the narrative by fabricating evidence that casts XIII as Seamus O&#x27;Neill—an IRA operative who honed his skills under Fidel Castro. This false identity not only makes XIII a target of the US government but also leads to a dramatic escape and survival against all odds.

The tension escalates when Irina Svetlanova, now in command of the Mongoose operation, orchestrates a high-stakes assassination attempt. Despite these relentless threats, XIII manages to dodge danger repeatedly, underscoring his resilience and resourcefulness.

== The Elusive Treasure and Hidden Agendas ==
Amid numerous setbacks, the long-sought treasure is finally discovered—only to be lost again soon after. The twists and turns in the treasure hunt echo the chaotic nature of XIII’s world, where nothing is quite as it seems.

As the political landscape shifts, Giordino’s past misdeeds catch up with him. Evidence surfaces linking him not only to the Mafia but also implicating him in the murder of Sheridan. This development forces the new President to remove Giordino from his position, adding yet another layer of complexity to the plot.

== The Final Chapters by Van Hamme and the Artistic Touch of Mœbius ==
Volumes eighteen and nineteen stand as the final contributions from writer Van Hamme. Volume eighteen, titled &quot;The Irish Version&quot;, is uniquely drawn by Jean Giraud—better known as Mœbius. This installment features a &quot;story within a story,&quot; blending the narrative of XIII with an embedded prequel that is further developed in volume nineteen, &quot;The Last Round&quot;. This clever narrative device not only enriches the backstory but also resolves longstanding mysteries about XIII’s true identity.

Even though XIII learns who he is, his memories remain fragmented. In volume twenty, his desperate search for medical treatment to unlock his lost memories is thwarted by Mayflower Day, a secret organization with its own hidden agenda. Their efforts to keep his past concealed hint at even deeper secrets waiting to be unraveled.

==Popularity==
&quot;XIII&quot; was released in 1984 as a serial in the popular &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine, and it was popular among Spirou readers. The first three episodes were released as a single hardcover volume by Dargaud the same year. This continued for later issues, and, by the time of the eighth issue, &quot;Thirteen to One&quot;, sales of the hardcover had reached 140,000 copies. Promotion for the series included a special draw by the French national lottery in 2000 with 1,500,000 tickets and a €13,000 grand prize.

The plot of the game is an adaptation of the first five volumes of the comic series. A sequel, titled &quot;XIII ²: Covert Identity&quot;, was released as a side-scrolling platform game for mobile phones by Gameloft in October 2007.

In November 2011, Anuman Interactive released an adventure game based on the series, titled &quot;&quot;.

In April 2019, Microids announced a remake of the 2003 game, developed by PlayMagic Ltd for multiple current-gen platforms. It released on November 10, 2020. Due to the remake&#x27;s poor reception, Microids replaced PlayMagic with the French studio Tower Five to &quot;rework the entire game&quot;, with the improved version released on September 13, 2022 as a free update.

A &quot;XIII&quot; 2-part TV mini-series called &quot;&quot; and starring Val Kilmer and Stephen Dorff was shown on French premium television channel Canal+ in October 2008.

In 2011, a TV series called &quot;&quot; aired in Canada and France, which is a continuation of the 2008 mini-series. It starred Stuart Townsend and Aisha Tyler. The first season followed the storyline constructed in the aftermath of Volume 5, concentrating on XIII&#x27;s past as in the comics while the second season develops beyond the plot of all the existing materials with an original story arc unrelated to the source material.

<text>Perfect Dark Zero is a first-person shooter developed by Rare and published by Microsoft Game Studios. It was released as a launch title for the Xbox 360 video game console in 2005. The game is part of the &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; series and a prequel to the original &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;. The story of the game follows Joanna Dark, a bounty hunter working with her father and a computer hacker, as she joins the Carrington Institute agency to prevent a rival corporation from gaining possession of an ancient artifact which endows individuals with superhuman powers.

&quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; features a campaign mode consisting of 14 missions that can be played solo or co-operatively, and a multiplayer mode where a maximum of 32 players can compete against each other in numerous types of deathmatch and objective-based games. Both the co-operative and multiplayer modes support split screen, system link, and the Xbox Live online service. The game was under development for five years and was originally intended to be released for the GameCube and later the Xbox. During development, several intended features were canceled so that the game could meet the Xbox 360 launch.

Upon release, &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; sold more than one million copies worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its graphics and numerous multiplayer modes. However, some critics felt that the game did not meet expectations, criticising single-player aspects such as its story and voice acting. After its release, the game was supported with downloadable content, expanding its multiplayer mode with new maps and new types of computer-controlled bots. In 2015, the game was included in the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; video game compilation for Xbox One.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; is a first-person shooter where players control the player character mostly from a first-person perspective. The combat features mechanics such as an evasive dodge roll and a cover system in which the gameplay switches to a third-person perspective, allowing the player to aim strategically without taking damage and be more aware of the surroundings. Players cannot jump but have the ability to automatically climb obstacles as long as they can reasonably reach them. It is also possible to climb ladders. When doing so the camera shifts into a third-person perspective. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. The health can recharge a bit if the player steps out of the line of fire for a few seconds, but it may not necessarily refill completely depending on how much damage the player took.

Players can only carry a limited number of weapons since the inventory features a 4-slot system in which single hand-held pistols usually take a weapon slot, whereas heavy weapons like sniper rifles or rocket launchers can take up to three weapon slots. The player&#x27;s movement speed is also altered by the weight of the weapon the player is currently holding. Besides the primary function, all of the weapons in &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; have one or two additional function modes that generally grant the player with special abilities. For example, the Shockwave Rifle features an X-ray function which allows the player to see enemies through walls, while the Plasma Rifle has a cloak function that renders the player character invisible to enemies at the cost of its battery charge. Some weapons also feature more unorthodox secondary functions. For instance, the Laptop Gun can be deployed as a sentry gun, while the SuperDragon assault rifle can launch bouncing grenades.

===Campaign===
The campaign is divided into 14 missions in which the player plays as Joanna Dark. Each mission has a number of objectives that the player must complete in order to progress. To advance to the next mission, the player must complete all primary objectives, and if Joanna is killed or fails an objective, the player has to start the mission again. Missions also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player&#x27;s overall completion score. Some objectives require the player to use numerous high-tech gadgets. For example, a device called Datathief allows the player to hack into electronic devices, while another called Loctopus can be used to open locked doors. Stealth is an important element of the gameplay, as the player is often given the freedom to kill enemies without being detected by sneaking up behind them. Unlike the original &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, every mission contains a single checkpoint at which the player may restart if Joanna is killed or loses beyond that checkpoint. However, checkpoints are progressively removed at higher difficulty settings. There are four difficulty settings on which a mission can be played: Agent, Secret Agent, Perfect Agent, and an extra one called Dark Agent, which becomes available once the player completes the entire game on Perfect Agent. As the player plays on higher difficulties, the game adds more objectives and makes enemies tougher to increase the challenge.

The game also provides a co-operative mode where two players may play through the game&#x27;s campaign together via split screen, system link, or through the Xbox Live online service. In co-operative mode, the missions are slightly altered to suit both players. For instance, some doors may require two players to open them. Additionally, in certain missions, the second player can occasionally start far away from the main player and takes over an allied character that is computer-controlled in the single player campaign. The respawn procedure is also altered substantially, as if one player dies, the other has to find and revive the partner&#x27;s corpse to bring it back to life.

===Multiplayer===
In addition to the campaign mode, &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; features a multiplayer mode where a maximum of 32 players may compete in numerous types of deathmatch and objective-based games via split screen, system link, or Xbox Live. There are two main modes with their own options: DeathMatch and DarkOps. DeathMatch is a standard game type where players spawn in rooms, collect weapons that are available on the map, and continue to the actual map. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from Killcount or Team Killcount, where the goal is to kill as many opposing players as possible, to objective-based games such as Capture the Flag and Territorial Gains. DarkOps is a slower-paced and team-only game type where weapons must be purchased from a player&#x27;s stock of credits and credits are earned by killing enemies and completing objectives. Scenarios in this mode include Eradication, where the last team with any members left alive wins; Infection, where players score points by either infecting others or surviving infection; Sabotage, where the team that causes the most damage to the other team&#x27;s property wins; and Onslaught, where one team must defend a base while the other has to attack it.

Players can either choose to play a ranked Deathmatch or DarkOps, where they will be matched with other players using a system called TrueSkill Matchmaking, or they may choose a player match where they can choose their game from a list of player-hosted games. Like the original &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, these games can be highly customized and can also include computer game bots. Features such as their difficulty and behavior can be changed to match player preference. For example, the Judge bot always attacks leading players with the highest kills score. Players can also issue commands to them as long as they are on their respective team, such as follow or hold position, and set waypoints for them to walk to. The game includes by default six different maps and each has two variants; the only change is the placement of the bases. Most of the maps are large ones, ideal for 32 players at once, with small variants for 4-16 player games.

==Plot==
&quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; is set in an alternate 2020, where a large percentage of the world is controlled by corporations. The most notable of these are dataDyne, headed by Zhang Li, and the Carrington Institute, headed by Daniel Carrington. The player is cast as Joanna Dark, a bounty hunter working with her father Jack and computer hacker Chandra Sekhar. The team is after Nathan Zeigler, an independent researcher who has been captured by a Hong Kong triad leader named Killian. Joanna and her father rescue Zeigler, but Killian manages to escape. Zeigler explains that Killian was trying to obtain his research, which contains information about a dangerous weapon. As Zeigler refuses to go anywhere without his research, Joanna is sent to retrieve it from a case in a nearby safe house. Zeigler then takes a device called a neurodrive from the case and uses it to implant his research data into Jack&#x27;s mind. Before dying to his injuries, which were inflicted by Killian, Zeigler tells Joanna and her father that they must find a scientist named Dr. Eustace Caroll.

While trying to escape, Joanna and Jack are attacked by a dataDyne assault team assisted by Killian in a dropship. Joanna manages to kill Killian and escape with Chandra, but Jack is captured by dataDyne. Joanna learns that her father has been taken to a mansion in China, where Zhang Li lives. Joanna infiltrates the mansion and finds her father in a cell. He has been tortured, and begins speaking gibberish to her, an aftereffect of the neurodrive. The pair fight their way out of the complex, but their extraction is interrupted by Zhang Li&#x27;s daughter, Mai Hem, who kills Jack before Joanna escapes in a hovercraft. Joanna and Chandra decide to pursue Zeigler&#x27;s lead and seek out Dr. Caroll, who works aboard a research platform on the Pacific Ocean. Upon meeting with Joanna, Dr. Caroll uses a neurodrive to extract Zeigler&#x27;s data from Joanna&#x27;s memory, which she gained when she rescued her father. Chandra then shoots Dr. Caroll, revealing that she decided to join dataDyne because Zhang Li had made her a large offer. A team of Carrington Institute agents saves Joanna, but Chandra ultimately escapes with the data.

When Joanna agrees to join the Carrington Institute to stop dataDyne, Carrington explains that Zeigler had been working on an algorithm capable of decoding extraterrestrial glyphs at a dig site in South America. Traveling to Peru, Joanna learns that the glyphs are leading dataDyne to search for an ancient artefact which acts as a power source for the Graal, a device which endows individuals with superhuman powers. Joanna plants a tracking device on the artefact before sneaking aboard a dataDyne dropship. The dropship takes her to Africa, where Zhang Li has located the Graal buried under the African sands. As the Carrington Institute starts an offensive on dataDyne, Joanna rescues several Carrington Institute agents before avenging her father&#x27;s death by killing Mai Hem. She then infiltrates an arena and faces off against Zhang Li, who dispatches Chandra after using the Graal. After Joanna defeats Zhang Li in a final battle, Carrington commends her efforts, saying she did &quot;Perfect&quot;.

==Development==
Development of &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; began on the GameCube with a very small team of roughly ten people. At the time, Nintendo had a 49% stake in Rare, making the company a Nintendo second-party developer. According to lead designer Chris Tilston, &quot;it was basically prototyping, finding out where we could go and how we could get there&quot;. When Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002, the project was transferred to the Xbox console and the game&#x27;s multiplayer mode was redesigned for Xbox Live online play. Tilston revealed that at one point they got to 50 players online simultaneously, but the graphics &quot;just couldn&#x27;t handle it&quot;. Since the initial version of the game pushed the original Xbox hardware &quot;pretty hard&quot;, the project was ultimately transferred to the Xbox successor, the Xbox 360. Tilston revealed that the original Xbox version was &quot;about 12 months away&quot; from completion when the shift occurred.

Initially, the game had a heavy anime style and Joanna Dark received many alterations throughout the development process. Lead Art Director Wil Overton explained that they &quot;wanted to bring her back in line with the way Rare do things. [...] We sorta wanted to stylize her up a bit and make her more iconic&quot;. However, the designers ultimately decided to tone down the styling of the game a bit. The Xbox 360 gave the developers more possibilities to include what they always wanted and allowed them to create the game&#x27;s co-operative mode, which was one of the first that could be played via Xbox Live. Designing the co-operative mode over Xbox Live was very challenging for the developers. According to Duncan Botwood, who was responsible for most of the multiplayer, &quot;it was quite an effort to put it in, to be honest. You have to cater for a number of eventualities you just don&#x27;t get normally. We think we pulled it off, and because we pulled it off, other people might feel inspired to put the effort in, and we think that&#x27;s a good thing&quot;.

&quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; is also one of the first games that uses Havok&#x27;s HydraCore physics engine, which was specifically designed for multi-core video game systems like the Xbox 360. The game&#x27;s renderer engine employs more advanced graphic technologies than was possible in the previous console generation, including parallax mapping, ambient occlusion, subsurface scattering, and high dynamic range. The soundtrack of the game was primarily composed by David Clynick, who worked with Grant Kirkhope on the original Nintendo 64 game&#x27;s score. New York-based group MorissonPoe contributed two songs to the score—the opening theme song &quot;Glitter Girl (Evil Side)&quot; and the closing credits theme &quot;Pearl Necklace&quot;—while DJs Kepi and Kat composed the game&#x27;s nightclub theme.

The cover mode was designed to enhance the stealth aspect of the game and the third-person perspective was needed to allow players to see the character they were playing. The idea of bringing the game into a total third-person perspective was rejected as the shooting &quot;works better&quot; in first-person view, explained Tilston. Developers decided not to include a jumping function since they felt it goes against the nature of the genre. Botwood pointed out that it can &quot;look damn stupid when you see other players doing it&quot;. For this reason, the team implemented moves such as climbing obstacles or, more specifically, the combat roll, which makes players harder to hit since it breaks the game&#x27;s auto-aim lock. The transition between first and third-person view with some moves took a lot of work so that they did not become disorientating. A first-person roll was implemented at one time, but it was ultimately dropped.

Because &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; was intended to be an Xbox 360 launch title, the last stage of development was very challenging and several features had to be canceled so that the game could meet the launch deadline. The number of players in multiplayer matches had to be reduced from 50 to 32, and a &quot;dataDyne TV&quot; mode that would have allowed players to upload and watch multiplayer matches over Xbox Live was eventually rejected. Final development for the Xbox 360 was very rushed. The order was given to produce the discs five days before the Microsoft certification was complete. Rare later stated they felt very confident they would pass, but it was a significant risk producing 700,000 disks if a bug turned up. According to Botwood, &quot;very few people believed we could make launch, but everything came together in time and it was out there for day one&quot;.

The actual development of the game took five years overall to complete and spanned three platforms: the GameCube, the Microsoft Xbox and the Xbox 360. Tilston remarked that, throughout the course of development, the team noticed how the video game industry had evolved as computing and graphics power increased, and how earlier games like &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; where their development costs were minimal could easily be profitable with a few programmers. Tilston also revealed that the team behind &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; was composed of roughly 25 people for most of the project, which was &quot;ridiculously&quot; small compared to Xbox 360 generation standards where there are 100 or 200 people working on a team. Despite this, &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot;, from a development cost, made four times its money back.

==Marketing and release==

&quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; was first hinted at Nintendo Space World in August 2000, where a brief demo showed a 3D real-time render of Joanna Dark. Some reports further suggested the development of the game with Rare applying to trademark the names &quot;After Dark&quot;, &quot;Perfect Dark Evolution&quot; and the phrase &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot;. At E3 2001, Nintendo advertised the title &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; on a list of upcoming GameCube releases, but the list was quickly removed. In January 2002, it was reported that &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; was delayed until at least 2004 due to internal team problems at Rare. When Rare was purchased by Microsoft in September 2002, several images of Joanna Dark were released, but few other official announcements were made in the following years.

In May 2005, one of the rewards in the OurColony viral marketing campaign for the Xbox 360 console was a new image of Joanna Dark. At the official unveiling of the Xbox 360, it was announced that &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; would be a launch title for the new system in the fall of 2005. A demo was shown at E3 2005 shortly afterwards. Prior to its release, Microsoft arranged a deal with Tor Books to produce novels set in the &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; universe. A six-issue comic book series written by Eric Trautmann and illustrated by Cold FuZion Studios was also announced. Around the same time, Joanna Dark made an appearance on the cover of &quot;FHM&quot; magazine. An official soundtrack album featuring a selection of music from the game was produced by Nile Rodgers and released on November 8, 2005 through Sumthing Else Music Works.

&quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; was first released in North America on November 22, 2005 . The game was playable at the Xbox 360 Zero Hour Launch event, alongside Rare&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and Activision&#x27;s &quot;Call of Duty 2&quot;. The European release followed on December 2, 2005, while the Japanese version was released on December 10, 2005. In Europe, Microsoft organized a party by simulating an apartment as Joanna&#x27;s home, where several journalists could play the Xbox 360. During the Japanese launch weekend, &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; became the second best-selling Xbox 360 game with roughly 15,000 units sold, behind Namco&#x27;s &quot;Ridge Racer 6&quot;. Standard and limited collector&#x27;s editions of the game were made available for purchase. The collector&#x27;s edition included a disc with behind-the-scenes content, a black metal game case, a special edition comic booklet that sets the scene for the game, and one of nine holographic collectible cards. As of October 2006, &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; had sold more than one million copies worldwide, eventually joining Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Platinum Hits&quot; game selection.

In 2015, &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; was released as a backward-compatible game for the Xbox One and included in the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; compilation. In 2019, the game was enhanced for the Xbox One with higher resolutions, faster frame rates, and improved textures.

===Downloadable content===
When the game was released, new multiplayer scenarios and a Counter-Operative mode similar to that of the original &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; were originally intended to be released as downloadable content. Game designer Duncan Botwood later clarified that it was unlikely to happen due to technical issues. According to him, &quot;It would have required much groundwork to be laid in the core AI code, which meant that it was unlikely to be available as downloadable content post-release&quot;. He also remarked that the Counter-Operative mode was planned during the development of the game, but the idea was ultimately discarded due to the pressure to cut planned content. In May 2006, an auto-update was made available on Xbox Live, responsible for fixing some bugs and adding new multiplayer options to the game. The bug fixes included code to prevent an ongoing problem where players could walk through the air, an issue where some weapons could make use of rapid fire, and a map-exiting glitch, among others. The new multiplayer options provided seven new bot types and the ability to use bots in DarkOps matches, since bots had only one AI variant and were only available in DeathMatch scenarios when the game was released.

A playable demo of the game was made freely available on the Xbox Live Marketplace shortly afterwards. The demo included one campaign mission that could be played in solo mode or co-operatively, and a new multiplayer map. A multiplayer map pack, called Perfect Dark Zero Map Pack One, was released on June 7, 2006, containing the demo&#x27;s new multiplayer map as well as three other new maps to add to the game&#x27;s original six. Unlike the original maps, the new maps only have one variant instead of two. On October 31, 2006, Rare revealed a special platinum edition of &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot;, featuring the first map pack and two additional maps as extras. The two new maps were later released for free in a pack called Perfect Dark Zero Map Pack Two. These maps are updated versions of the Felicity and Ruins maps from the original &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;. The pack was released on November 1, 2006 for Gold Members and on November 8, 2006 for Silver Members.

==Reception==
&quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Writing for &quot;GameSpot&quot;, Greg Kasavin felt that &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; &quot;champions the Xbox 360 with its excellent assortment of single and multiplayer game types, as well as its incredible good looks and dynamic, intense action&quot;. He concluded that the game &quot;delivers just about everything you could hope for from a first-person shooter&quot;. Charles Onyett of &quot;IGN&quot; praised the game&#x27;s replay value, but also criticised single-player aspects such as the weak artificial intelligence of enemies, commenting that &quot;they never display any advanced assault tactics&quot;.

The graphics were highlighted positively. Kasavin was impressed with the amount of lighting and motion blur effects, and noted that the &quot;excellent character animation helps make the guns feel as powerful as they look&quot;. Bryn Williams of &quot;GameSpy&quot; considered the graphics as a &quot;stunning look at what the 360 hardware is capable of&quot;, but also admitted that the animation &quot;is a little too slow and sometimes creates an unwelcome sense of cartoonishness&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; credited the attractive gun models, explosions, and sprawling vistas, but felt that some areas such as the South American Ruins can unnecessarily look too shiny. The game&#x27;s audio was said to feature &quot;heavy-hitting weapon effects [and] fantastic, moody soundtrack that gives each mission its own pulsing rhythms&quot;.

The game&#x27;s weapons were very well received. &quot;Edge&quot; praised their weight, stating that each weapon encourages strategic play with their secondary functions. Critics generally agreed that the roll and cover system worked well and that they did not feel overpowered, but some criticised the fact that players need to be in a specific spot to use the cover mode. Reviewers considered the story and voice acting to be weak. &quot;IGN&quot; said that it is almost impossible not to notice how &quot;laughably bad it is&quot;, and that many plot twists are presented then never resolved, but also admitted that it does not really factor into the gameplay. &quot;GameCritics&quot; reviewer Mike Bracken commented: &quot;It&#x27;s always sad when there&#x27;s voice acting in a game and I find myself being embarrassed for the voice actors&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;GameSpot&quot; added that the weapon sound effects and musical score &quot;easily drown this out&quot;.

Publications judged the co-op aspect of the game well. Kristan Reed of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; praised the fact that the missions were &quot;designed with co-op in mind&quot;. He noted that, for example, the third level &quot;has Joanna providing cover fire for her father Jack as he hops from one point of the level to the next. In the single player campaign Jack&#x27;s [computer-controlled], but co-op lets you take direct control of his actions, making the experience a much more engaging affair all-round&quot;. Multiplayer matches of &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; were widely well received. &quot;GameSpot&quot; stated that &quot;the excellent weapon selection, flexibility of options, high-quality maps, and smooth online performance ... make for a rock-solid competitive shooter&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; stated similar pros, calling it &quot;enormous&quot;. &quot;1Up.com&quot; reviewer Che Chou also praised the multiplayer, but observed that &quot;constantly roll-dodging to avoid enemy fire at close range [...] combined with the exceptionally slow movement speed of your character [...] can occasionally be highly frustrating for beginners&quot;.

Despite solid reviews, numerous publications remarked that &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; did not meet expectations. According to &quot;GameCritics&quot;, &quot;it took Rare a whole console generation to do it [...] and the wait wasn&#x27;t really worth it&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; found the game underwhelming, reviewing it under the tagline &quot;Don&#x27;t believe the hype&quot;. In a positive review, &quot;GameSpy&quot; praised &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; for doing many things well, but acknowledge that it was not a killer-app. &quot;Edge&quot; said that the game &quot;falls short&quot;, especially when compared to &quot;&quot;, a successful first-person shooter that was released as a launch title for the original Xbox. At the 2005 Spike Video Game Awards, &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; was nominated for Best Original Score and Best First Person Action, while Joanna Dark was nominated for Cyber Vixen of the Year. At &quot;IGN&quot;″s Best of 2005 awards, &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; won Best Offline Multiplayer Game and Best Xbox Live Game in the Xbox 360 categories, and was nominated for Best First-Person Shooter, also in the Xbox 360 categories. Similarly, at &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Best of 2005 awards, the game was nominated for Best Original Music, Best Multiplayer Game, Best Shooter, and Best Xbox 360 Game.

<doc id="870586" wikidata="Q421721" url="?curid=870586" title="Acetamide">
<text>Acetamide (systematic name: ethanamide) is an organic compound with the formula CH3CONH2. It is an amide derived from ammonia and acetic acid. It finds some use as a plasticizer and as an industrial solvent. The related compound &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylacetamide (DMA) is more widely used, but it is not prepared from acetamide. Acetamide can be considered an intermediate between acetone, which has two methyl (CH3) groups either side of the carbonyl (CO), and urea which has two amide (NH2) groups in those locations. Acetamide is also a naturally occurring mineral with the IMA symbol: Ace.

==Production==
===Laboratory scale===
Acetamide can be produced in the laboratory from ammonium acetate by dehydration:
: [NH4][CH3CO2] → CH3C(O)NH2 + H2O

Alternatively acetamide can be obtained in excellent yield via ammonolysis of acetylacetone under conditions commonly used in reductive amination.

It can also be made from anhydrous acetic acid, acetonitrile and very well dried hydrogen chloride gas, using an ice bath, alongside more valuable reagent acetyl chloride. Yield is typically low (up to 35%), and the acetamide made this way is generated as a salt with HCl.

===Industrial scale===
In a similar fashion to some laboratory methods, acetamide is produced by dehydrating ammonium acetate or via the hydration of acetonitrile, a byproduct of the production of acrylonitrile:
: CH3CN + H2O → CH3C(O)NH2

==Uses==
Acetamide is used as a plasticizer and an industrial solvent. Molten acetamide is good solvent with a broad range of applicability. Notably, its dielectric constant is higher than most organic solvents, allowing it to dissolve inorganic compounds with solubilities closely analogous to that of water. Acetamide has uses in electrochemistry and the organic synthesis of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and antioxidants for plastics. It is a precursor to thioacetamide.

==Occurrence==
Acetamide has been detected near the center of the Milky Way galaxy. This finding is potentially significant because acetamide has an amide bond, similar to the essential bond between amino acids in proteins. This finding lends support to the theory that organic molecules that can lead to life (as we know it on Earth) can form in space.

On 30 July 2015, scientists reported that upon the first touchdown of the &quot;Philae&quot; lander on comet 67/P surface, measurements by the COSAC and Ptolemy instruments revealed sixteen organic compounds, four of which – acetamide, acetone, methyl isocyanate, and propionaldehyde – were seen for the first time on a comet.

In addition, acetamide is found infrequently on burning coal dumps, as a mineral of the same name.

<doc id="870593" wikidata="Q540289" url="?curid=870593" title="Baked Alaska">
<text>Baked Alaska, also known as Bombe Alaska, &quot;omelette norvégienne, omelette surprise,&quot; or &quot;omelette sibérienne&quot; depending on the country, is a dessert consisting of ice cream and cake topped with browned meringue. The dish is made of ice cream placed in a pie dish, lined with slices of sponge cake or Christmas pudding, and topped with meringue. After having been placed in the freezer, the entire dessert is then placed in an extremely hot oven for a brief time, long enough to firm and caramelize the meringue but not long enough to begin melting the ice cream. Another common method of browning the meringue is to torch the dessert, sometimes even lighting it on fire for presentational purposes.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;baked Alaska&quot; was supposedly coined in 1876 at Delmonico&#x27;s, a restaurant in New York City, to honor the acquisition by the United States of Alaska from the Russian Empire in March 1867. However, the restaurant&#x27;s original recipe was called &quot;Alaska Florida&quot; (suggesting extremes of cold and heat), not &quot;Baked Alaska&quot;.

The dish is also known as an &quot;omelette à la norvégienne,&quot; or &quot;Norwegian omelette&quot;, which similarly refers to the cold climate of Norway. During the Paris World&#x27;s Fair in 1867, the chef of the Grand Hôtel decided to create a &quot;scientific dessert&quot; by using Benjamin Thompson&#x27;s discovery of the low thermal conductivity of egg whites. Thompson lived in Bavaria at the time of his discovery, and as the chef thought Bavaria was in Norway, he decided to name the dish &quot;Norwegian omelette&quot;.

==Variations==
In 1969, the recently invented microwave oven enabled the Hungarian gastrophysicist Nicholas Kurti to produce a reverse baked Alaska (also called a &quot;Frozen Florida&quot;)—a frozen shell of meringue filled with hot liquor.

A variation called Bombe Alaska calls for some dark rum to be splashed over the baked Alaska. The whole dessert is flambéed while being served.

Flame on the iceberg is a popular dessert in Hong Kong that is similar to baked Alaska. The dessert is an ice cream ball in the middle of a sponge cake, with cream on the top. Whisky and syrup are poured over the top and the ball set alight before serving. Decades ago, the delicacy was served only in high-end hotels, but today it is commonly served in many Western restaurants and even in some &quot;cha chaan teng&quot;.

<text>Kannauj (Hindustani pronunciation: ) is an ancient city, administrative headquarters and a municipal board or Nagar Palika Parishad in Kannauj district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The city&#x27;s name is an evolved form of the classical name &quot;Kanyakubja&quot;. During the ancient Vedic period, it was the capital city of the Panchala Kingdom during the reign of king Vajrayudha. In the medieval era, it formed the core of the Kingdom of Kannauj and was ruled by multiple successive royal families.

It was also known as &quot;Mahodaya&quot; during the time of Mihira Bhoja. It is situated 104 kilometres west of the state capital, Lucknow.

Kannauj is famous for distilling of scents and perfumes. It is known as &quot;India&#x27;s perfume capital&quot; and is famous for its traditional Kannauj Perfume, a government protected entity. This industry is threatened by the rise of perfumes made from chemicals, rather than using attar, made from the petals of flowers grown in this area.

==History==
===Early history===
Archaeological discoveries show that Kannauj was inhabited by the Painted Grey Ware and Northern Black Polished Ware cultures, -600 BCE and -200 BCE, respectively. Under the names of Kuśasthala and Kanyakubja, it is mentioned as a well-known town in the Hindu Epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, and by the grammarian Patanjali (). The early Buddhist literature mentions Kannauj as Kannakujja, and refers to its location on the trade route from Mathura to Varanasi and Rajgir.

Kannauj may have been known to the Greco-Roman civilization under the name of Kanagoja or Kanogiza, which appears in &quot;Geography&quot; by Ptolemy (). It was also visited by the Chinese Buddhist travellers Faxian and Xuanzang in the fifth and seventh centuries CE, respectively.

During the decline of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century, the Maukhari dynasty of Kannauj – who had served as vassal rulers under the Guptas - took advantage of the weakening of central authority, broke away and established control over large areas of northern India.

Under the Maukharis, Kannauj continued to grow in importance and prosperity. It became the greatest city of Northern India under Emperor Harsha (r. 606 to 647 CE) of the Vardhana dynasty, who made it his capital. Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang visited India during the reign of Harsha, and described Kannauj as a large, prosperous city with many Buddhist monasteries. Harsha died with no heir, resulting in a power vacuum until Maharaja Yashovarman seized power as the ruler of Kannauj.

===The Kannauj Triangle===

Kannauj became a focal point for three powerful dynasties, namely the Gurjara Pratiharas (r. 730-1036 CE), Palas (r. 750-1162 CE) and Rashtrakutas (r. 753-982 CE), between the 8th and 10th centuries. The conflict between the three dynasties has been referred to as the Tripartite struggle by many historians.
There were initial struggles but ultimately the Gurjara Pratiharas succeeded in retaining the city. The Gurjara-Pratiharas ruled Avanti (based at Ujjain), which was bounded to the South by the Rashtrakuta Empire, and the Pala Empire to the East. The Tripartite struggle began with the defeat of Indrayudh at the hands of Gurjara-Pratihara ruler Vatsaraja (r. 780-800 CE). The Pala ruler Dharampala (~770-821 CE) was also keen to establish his authority at Kannauj, giving rise to a struggle between Vatsaraja and Dharmapala, in which Dharmapala was defeated. Taking advantage of the chaos, the Rastrakuta ruler Dhruva Dharavarsha (r. 780–793 CE) surged northwards, defeated Vatsaraja, and took Kannauj for himself, completing the furthest northern expansion by a South Indian ruler.

When the Rashtrakuta ruler Dhruva Dharavarsha advanced back to the south, Dharampala was left in control of Kannauj for some time. The struggle between the two northern dynasties of Palas and Gurjara Pratiharas continued: the Pala&#x27;s vassal Chakrayudha (Dharmapala&#x27;s nominee for Ujjain) was defeated by the Pratihara Nagabhata II (r. 805–833 CE), and Kannauj was again occupied by the Gurjara Pratiharas. Dharmapala tried to take control of Kannauj but was defeated badly at Moongher by the Gurjara Pratiharas. However, Nagabhata II was in turn soon defeated by the Rashtrakuta Govinda III (r. 793–814 CE), who had initiated a second northern surge. An inscription states that Chakrayudha and Dharmapala invited Govinda III to war against the Gurjara Pratiharas, but Dharmapala and Chakrayudh both submitted to the Govinda III, in order to win his sympathy. After this defeat, Pratihara power degenerated for some time. After the death of Dharampala, Nagabhata II regained hold over Kannuaj and made it the capital of the Gurjara Pratihara Empire. During this period, the Rashtrakutas were facing some internal conflicts, and so they, as well as the Pala Empire, did not contest this. Thus Gurjara Pratiharas became the greatest power in Northern India after occupying Kannauj (9th century CE).

===Medieval times===
Famous Pir-e-Kamil, Hazrat Pir Shah Jewna Al-Naqvi Al-Bokhari was also born in Kannauj in 1493 in the reign of King Sikandar Lodi. He was a descendant of Jalaluddin Surkh-Posh Bukhari and his father Syed Sadar-ud-din Shah Kabeer Naqvi Al Bukhari was a great saint and was also among the advisors of King Sikandar Lodhi. Shah Jewna migrated to Shah Jeewna (a town named after him) now in Pakistan. Shah Jewna’s colonized towns in Kannauj :- Siray-e-Miran, Bibiyan Jalalpur, Makhdumpur, Lal Pur (associated with the name of Saint Sayyed Jalaluddin Haider Surkh Posh Bukhari or Lal Bukhari). His descendants still present in various parts of India and Pakistan.
In Hindu epics, Kannauj or Kanyakubja was the capital of Amavasu the son of Pururavas and an ancestor of Rigvedic sage Vishwamitra. 

In Classical India, it served as the center of imperial Indian dynasties. The earliest of these was the Maukhari dynasty, and later, Emperor Harsha of the Vardhana dynasty. The city later came under the Gahadavala dynasty, and under the rule of Govindachandra, the city reached &quot;unprecedented glory&quot;. Kannauj was also the main place of war in the Tripartite struggle between the Gurjara-Pratihara, the Palas and the Rashtrakutas.
Kannauj was clearly the wealthiest city in early Medieval India at large and the country all around Kannauj was called Āryāvarta.
It seems likely that Kannauj and Middle country was the place of origin of majority of migrating Brahmins throughout the medieval centuries.

In 1010 A.D. Mahmud of Ghazni saw Kannauj as a &quot;City which raised its head to skies which in strength and structure might justly boast to have no equals&quot;.

Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni captured Kanauj in 1018. Chandradeva founded the Gahadvala dynasty with its capital at Kannauj around 1090. His grandson Govindachandra &quot;raised Kannauj to unprecedented glory.&quot; Muhammad Ghori advanced against the city, and in the Battle of Chandwar of 1193 killed Jayachandra.

Alberuni has referred to &quot;Kannoj&quot; as the key geographical point to explain marching distances to other Indian cities. The &quot;glory of Imperial Kannauj&quot; ended with Iltutmish&#x27;s conquest.

Sher Shah Suri defeated Humayun at the Battle of Kannauj on 17 May 1540.

===Colonial period===

During early English rule in India, the city was spelled Cannodge by them. The has been constantly associated with the development of city of Kannauj by the travellers and writers of the period. A ghat (), a Sarai (for the free stay of travellers and merchants) and various metalled roads were built by the Nawab which also bear his name.

Different spellings that are used to refer to Kannauj, apart from the official Kannauj, are: Cannodge, Kannauj, Kannoj, Kinnouge, Qannauj and Qannawj. The British who visited Kannauj in the later part of 19th century mostly referred to it as Kanauj (notice the single &quot;n&quot;). George Forster spells it Kinnouge. Alexander Cunnigham wrote its spelling as Kanoj.

Changes in when flower crops bloom due to climate change are affecting the industry of perfumes made from natural sources, like attar from roses.

<text>Rockwoods Reservation is a state forest and wildlife conservation area in St. Louis County, Missouri. It was established in 1938, making it one of the oldest Missouri Department of Conservation areas.

Being located close to a major urban area and in a rapidly developing suburban area increases its significance as a nature reserve. Rockwoods supports a diverse array of native plant and animal life and contains geologically interesting rock formations and ecologically important springs and caves. Rockwoods Reservation is not a pristine wilderness untouched by human hands, however; remnants of extensive former limestone, clay and gravel quarrying operations are hidden in the dense second growth hardwood forest. Most of the original forest was clearcut to feed lime kilns.

Rockwoods Reservation adjoins St. Louis County&#x27;s Greensfelder County Park to the south, which itself abuts the state&#x27;s Rockwoods Range Conservation Area. Taken together, these three parcels constitute a contiguous green belt of almost . The Greenrock Trail is a hiking trail that crosses all three areas with one terminus in Rockwoods Reservation.

There are six trails in Rockwoods Reservation:
*Wildlife Habitat Discovery Trail 
*Rock Quarry Trail - 
*Trail Among the Trees - 
*Lime Kiln Trail - 
*Green Rock Trail - of the trail&#x27;s 
*Turkey Ridge Trail -

<text>The , also referred to as the for short, is the seat of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, which governs the special wards, cities, towns, and villages that constitute the Tokyo Metropolis.

Located in Shinjuku ward, the building was designed by architect Kenzo Tange. It consists of a complex of three structures, each taking up a city block. The tallest of the three is the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building No.1, a tower 48 stories tall that splits into two sections at the 33rd floor. The building also has three levels below ground. The design of the building was meant to resemble an integrated circuit, while also evoking the look of a Gothic cathedral. It is the tallest city hall in the world.

The other two buildings in the complex are the eight-story Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly Building (including one underground floor) and Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building No. 2, which has 37 stories including three below ground.

The two panoramic observation decks, one in each tower on floor 45 ( high), are free of charge to the public and contain gift shops and cafes. The two observation decks are open between 9:30 and 22:00 on alternating days.

==History==
The building was designed by Kenzo Tange and finished in December 1990 at the expense of ¥157 billion (about US$1 billion) of public money. It replaced the old city hall at Yūrakuchō, which was built in 1957 and also designed by Tange, which is now the site of the Tokyo International Forum.

At , it was the tallest building by roof height in Tokyo until 2007, when the Midtown Tower was completed.

In February 2024, the building was recognized by the Guinness World Records for having the world&#x27;s largest projection mapping display.

<doc id="870607" wikidata="Q3091392" url="?curid=870607" title="Federalism in Quebec">
<text>Federalism in Quebec (French: &quot;Fédéralisme au Québec&quot;) is concerned with the support of confederation in regards to the federal union of Canada: that is, support for the principles and/or political system of the government of Canada (status quo). This issue has been summarized as revolving around the concepts of Quebec remaining within Canada and opposition to the desires of Quebec sovereigntists.

Throughout the sovereignty debate Quebec nationalist sentiment has swung between the federalist and sovereigntist options, with many Quebec nationalists willing to be a part of a Canadian federation with a more decentralized government. Quebecer anglophones and allophones have been overwhelmingly opposed to Quebec&#x27;s secession.

Supporters of independence point to their belief that Quebec is a nation due to its unique history, shared major language and common heritage. Opponents of sovereignty generally believe it to be a dangerous idea due to the political, financial, personal and economic ties between Quebecers and other Canadians. Some see it as being unnecessary due to Canada&#x27;s multicultural and bilingual national character, as well as the strong status of the French language and culture in Quebec. Opponents to Québécois nationalism point to the fact that Quebec is just as ethnically diverse as the rest of Canada and therefore is divisible by different ethnic and language groups, or point to the shared Francophone heritage of the ROC (Rest of Canada). Many federalists believe that Canada comprises many nations in the cultural and ethnic, non-political sense; and that Quebec can be divided into just as many nations as Ontario or British Columbia.

Most major federal political parties, including the Liberal Party of Canada, the Conservative Party of Canada, the New Democratic Party and the Green Party of Canada support maintaining the status quo with Quebec remaining part of Canada. The Bloc Québécois is the sole sovereigntist federal party with seats in the House of Commons. Two provincial political parties, the Coalition Avenir Québec and the Quebec Liberal Party, support different ideas about Quebec&#x27;s political status within Canada; the former wants to make Quebec an autonomous province within Canada, while the latter, like its former national parent party, supports maintaining the status quo with Quebec remaining part of Canada.

== Historical context ==

The idea that the Province of Quebec should remain a part of the Canadian Confederation is based on a variety of historical and cultural justifications, principally centred on the composition of Canadian culture prior to Confederation in 1867. The Federalist view of Canadian history suggests that Canada as a nation is intrinsically tied to the Canadian people, a product of imperial synthesis. The realities of colonial-era life for French and British settlers was heavily influenced by local considerations, such as climate, geography and established Aboriginal societies. The economic realities of New France required a cooperative relationship with these already established societies, and the French were more than willing to do so, recognizing some 39 sovereign Aboriginal nations as strategic partners and allies at the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701. In effect, this singular event best represents proto-Canadian Federalism, and would serve as a model for later political developments. After the Seven Years&#x27; War, the British colonial authority administering the newly created Province of Quebec decided to leave many socio-cultural institutions in place, such as the Catholic Church, French Civil Law, the Seigneurial System, and perhaps most importantly, the traditional agrarian lifestyles and languages of the early Habitants, the first Canadiens. In this sense, Canada was spared the cultural hegemony of the British Empire and was not assimilated. The British were quick to recognize that the French Monarchy and elites were quick to abandon New France, and that a resentment had been growing against imperial domination. The Ancien Régime administration was cognizant of the development of a new culture many years before The Conquest, and decided against pursuing any more involvement in the economically unsustainable colony. Under British administration, the influx of new capital as a result of the migration of Loyalists into Upper Canada, the Maritimes and the Eastern Townships and the threat of a newly independent and militaristic United States, all led to substantial development for the colony. It is during this period that Quebec and Montreal became the economic focal point of the new colony, and a strong proponent of a new national identity. During the Rebellions of 1837, Canadian federalists, such as Louis-Joseph Papineau, Wolfred Nelson and William Lyon MacKenzie fought with the British colonial government for enhanced representation, among other grievances.

== Ideological branches ==
While the usual denomination for all followers is simply &quot;federalist&quot;, two main branches can be sketched out.

=== Quebec nationalist federalism and autonomism ===

Federalist Quebec nationalists defend the concept of Quebec remaining within Canada, while pursuing greater autonomy and national recognition for Quebec within the Canadian federation. This approach to national unity has a long tradition within Canadian federalism that in some respects can be traced back to the compromises of the 19th century that were essential to the unification of Upper and Lower Canada and eventually Confederation.

The &quot;Union Nationale&quot; under Maurice Duplessis (1930s to 1950s) was nationalist without explicitly calling for independence, prior to the arrival of Daniel Johnson, Sr. as leader. The &quot;Parti libéral du Québec&quot; represented a progressive, left-leaning variety of federalist nationalism throughout the Lesage and Bourassa eras (1960s to 1990s). However, since the failures of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords, and the 1995 Quebec referendum on independence, the party has had no defining plan for official national recognition, albeit in general the Party has taken many stances in favour of autonomy and self-determination.

Recently, the Université de Montréal political philosopher Charles Blattberg has put forward a series of arguments aimed at integrating Québécois nationalism within a renewed Canadian federalism, one that recognizes Canada&#x27;s multi-national character.

The centre-right, autonomist and Quebec nationalist Coalition Avenir Québec or CAQ, led by former PQ cabinet minister Francois Legault, is now opposed to sovereignty but takes a moderate nationalist approach to identity and favours strongly a primary role for Quebec in its internal affairs. Its predecessor, the more radical right of centre, economic liberal, Action démocratique du Québec, or ADQ, of Mario Dumont took a similar stance after abandoning Quebec sovereignty to favouring of making Quebec of granting political autonomy status within Canada while remaining Quebec nationalists.

More recently at the federal level, the New Democratic Party of Canada moved in the direction of asymmetrical federalism under former leaders Jack Layton and Tom Mulcair, both Quebec natives. This included opposition to the Clarity Act (the Sherbrooke Declaration, which brought the NDP in line with position of the Quebec Liberal Party), and support for enhancing French language rights. Within the Liberal Party of Canada former Prime Minister Paul Martin also supported asymmetrical federalism, albeit he was in favour of the Clarity Act. For the most part though, the federal Liberals are associated with symmetrical federalism.

On the Right, former the Progressive Conservative Party leader and prime minister Joe Clark (who also opposed the Clarity Act), and some Quebec figures within the modern Conservative Party of Canada have also taken a stance in favour of greater autonomy for Quebec within Canada.

Notable asymmetrical federalists have included Tom Mulcair, Jack Layton, Jean Charest, Philippe Couillard, Francois Legault, Paul Martin, Joe Clark, Robert Bourassa, Brian Mulroney, Claude Ryan, and Jean Lesage.

=== &quot;Status-quo&quot; federalism ===
Currently, governmental oversight is shared amongst a federal legislature and a number of legislatures whose power is distributed as per the Constitution.

Federalists in favour of the status quo, or symmetrical federalists, also defend Quebec remaining within Canada; however, they support the status quo division of powers between Ottawa and Quebec City and the current Constitution. Current Liberal Party leader and Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau at one point suggested that gaining Quebec&#x27;s signature to the Constitution was not a priority, putting him at odds with many past federalists from his home province.

This strain of Canadian federalism is strictly against reopening the Constitution and supports policies of shared and exclusive provincial jurisdiction in areas such as taxation, healthcare and immigration. They defend the federal government occasionally encroaching on areas that Quebec governments (both federalist and sovereigntist) consider their rightful jurisdiction. In general, federalists of this school of thought are opposed to officially recognising Quebec as a &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;distinct society&quot; within Canada, and support the Clarity Act (legislation introduced by the Chrétien government, essentially giving the federal government the right to establish a &quot;clear majority&quot; threshold for any sovereignty referendum at its own discretion and after the fact - this is opposed by the Quebec Liberal Party).

Notable symmetrical federalists have included Pierre Trudeau, Jean Chrétien, Stéphane Dion and Justin Trudeau.

Although this strain of uncompromising, centralising Canadian federalism is most often associated with the Liberal Party of Canada and the political tradition of Pierre Trudeau, it also has adherents from other parties and across the political spectrum.

===Related Terms===
In French, fédération can be defined as: 
(1) a methodical approach of defining a set of types in regards to complex realities, applied to state organization.

a grouping of various associations, unions, parties, and clubs. It can also be used as synonym for federal state.

In English, federalism has been defined as a &quot;mode of political organization that unites separate states or other polities within an overarching political system in such a way as to allow each to maintain its own fundamental political integrity&quot;.

This compromise as political system has been called a “quasi-federal concept”, as well as described as a &quot;post-nation&quot; state.

==Federalist parties==

===Represented in the Parliament of Canada===
* Liberal Party of Canada
* Conservative Party of Canada 
* New Democratic Party

===Represented in the National Assembly of Quebec===
* Quebec Liberal Party – They have alternated in power with the sovereigntist PQ since the 1970s. The Party disaffiliated itself from the Liberal Party of Canada in 1960. For decades it has acted as a broad tent for federalists from across the political spectrum. Important leaders have included Jean Lesage, Claude Ryan, Robert Bourassa, Jean Charest and Philippe Couillard
* Coalition Avenir Québec – Currently government party in Quebec, originally formed by members of the PQ and Liberal Party, wishing to move past the National Question, the CAQ is now officially opposed to sovereignty albeit it supports a significant degree of autonomy. Its founding leader François Legault is a former member of the Parti Québécois and former sovereigntist, and its ideology is generally speaking fiscally conservative and Quebec autonomist. In the 2018 election, his party won a majority.

<text>Eugenio Rolando Martínez Careaga (alias Musculito, July 8, 1922 – January 30, 2021) was a member of the anti-Castro movement in the early 1960s, and later was one of the five men recruited by G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt in 1972 for the Memorial Day weekend Watergate burglary at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington, D.C. He later worked as a real estate agent.

Weeks after the initial break-in, on June 17, 1972, the men were arrested by District of Columbia Police inside DNC headquarters during what they said was a second entry into the building to correct problems with the first break-in. Martinez and the others were convicted in the ensuing Watergate scandal. The others were Frank Sturgis, Virgilio Gonzalez, Bernard Barker and James McCord. After completing his 15 month prison term, Martinez was pardoned by President Ronald Reagan in 1983. Martínez was the only person aside from Nixon to receive a pardon for his role in the scandal.

On August 31, 2016, the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained CIA internal documents, through a FOIA request, that stated Martinez was a paid asset of the Agency at the time of the break-in. Although his connection to the Agency was acknowledged, until this release the CIA had maintained that his service had ended and he no longer had an association with the Agency for at least two years prior to the incident at the Watergate Hotel. He died on January 30, 2021, at his daughter&#x27;s home in Minneola, Florida at the age of 98. He would be the last living person of The original Watergate Seven that burglarized the Democratic National Committee.

==In popular culture==
Martinez was portrayed in &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, the 1976 film retelling the events of the Watergate scandal, by Dominic Chianese.

The 2012 novel &quot;The Cassandra Project&quot; () by Jack McDevitt and Mike Resnick, set in 2019 and correctly predicting that Martinez would be the last surviving Watergate burglar at that time, has him divulge to a character that the true purpose of the Watergate burglary was to obtain the notebook of another character (supposedly a close friend of both John Ehrlichman and Larry O&#x27;Brien) relating to discoveries made by a secret moon landing, and the DNC wiretaps were a diversion.

Martinez is a minor character in &quot;Harlot&#x27;s Ghost&quot;.

<doc id="870613" wikidata="Q3246710" url="?curid=870613" title="Propulsor">
<text>A propulsor is a mechanical device that gives propulsion. The word is commonly used in the marine vernacular, and implies a mechanical assembly that is more complicated than a propeller. The Kort nozzle, pump-jet and rim-driven thruster are examples.

An example propulsor is shown in the accompanying picture. It has a shroud which cuts down on blade-tip cavitation and radiated noise. It also has a rotor element and a stator. The stator concentrates the thrust in axial direction and reduces energy wasted in the tangential flow (therefore eliminating torque on the hull). The number of blades in the rotor and stator will typically be two different prime numbers to avoid standing waves. The blades in the rotor or the stator may be angled to further reduce noise. The physical design and layout is very much similar to a single-stage axial-flow compressor.

==Other propulsors==
===Voith Schneider===
The Voith Schneider Propeller, also known as a cycloidal drive is a specialized marine propulsion system. It is highly maneuverable, being able to change the direction of its thrust almost instantaneously. It is widely used on tugs and ferries.

From a circular plate, rotating around a vertical axis, a circular array of vertical blades (in the shape of hydrofoils) protrude out of the bottom of the ship. Each blade can rotate itself around a vertical axis. The internal gear changes the angle of attack of the blades in sync with the rotation of the plate, so that each blade can provide thrust in any direction, very similar to the &quot;collective pitch control&quot; and &quot;cyclic&quot; in a helicopter.

===Azimuth thruster===

An azimuth thruster is a configuration of ship propellers placed in pods that can be rotated on the horizontal plane, making a rudder unnecessary. These give ships better maneuverability than a fixed propeller and rudder system.

===Magnetohydrodynamic drive===
A magnetohydrodynamic drive or MHD propulsor is a method for propelling seagoing vessels using only electric and magnetic fields with no moving parts, using magnetohydrodynamics. The working principle involves electrification of the propellant (gas or water) which can then be directed by a magnetic field, pushing the vehicle in the opposite direction. Although some working prototypes exist, MHD drives remain impractical and exist mostly in the world of science fiction. A magnetohydrodynamic drive was featured in the 1990 film &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, differing from the pump jet propulsion system featured in the Tom Clancy novel &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; upon which the movie was based.

<doc id="870619" wikidata="Q314801" url="?curid=870619" title="Hal Holbrook">
<text>Harold Rowe Holbrook Jr. (February 17, 1925 – January 23, 2021) was an American actor. He first received critical acclaim in 1954 for a one-man stage show that he developed called &quot;Mark Twain Tonight!&quot; while studying at Denison University. He won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play in 1966 for his portrayal of Twain. He continued to perform his signature role for more than 60 years, retiring the show in 2017 due to his failing health. Throughout his career, he also won five Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on television and was nominated for an Academy Award for his work in film.

Holbrook made his film debut in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;The Group&quot; (1966). He later gained international fame for his performance as Deep Throat in the 1976 film &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;. He played Abraham Lincoln in the 1974 miniseries &quot;Lincoln&quot; and 1985 miniseries &quot;North and South&quot;. He also appeared in films such as &quot;Magnum Force&quot; (1973), &quot;Julia&quot; (1977), &quot;Capricorn One&quot; (1977), &quot;The Fog&quot; (1980), &quot;Creepshow&quot; (1982), &quot;Wall Street&quot; (1987), &quot;The Firm&quot; (1993), &quot;Hercules&quot; (1997) and &quot;Men of Honor&quot; (2000).

Holbrook&#x27;s role as Ron Franz in Sean Penn&#x27;s &quot;Into the Wild&quot; (2007) earned both an Academy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. In 2009, he received critical acclaim for his performance as recently retired farmer Abner Meecham in the independent film &quot;That Evening Sun&quot;. He also portrayed Francis Preston Blair in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Lincoln&quot; (2012).

In 2003, Holbrook was honored with the National Humanities Medal by President George W. Bush.

==Early life==
Harold Rowe Holbrook Jr. was born on February 17, 1925, in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Aileen (née Davenport) Holbrook (1905–1987), a vaudeville dancer, and Harold Rowe Holbrook Sr. (1902–1982).

Holbrook and his two older sisters were abandoned by their parents when he was two years old. The three children were raised by their paternal grandparents, first in Weymouth, Massachusetts, and later in the Cleveland suburb of Lakewood, Ohio. He graduated from Culver Military Academy (now part of the Culver Academies) and then from Denison University, where an honors project about Mark Twain led him to develop the one-man show for which he became best known, a series of performances called &quot;Mark Twain Tonight!&quot;. He also studied acting at HB Studio in New York City.

From 1942 through 1946, Holbrook served in the United States Army in World War II, achieving the rank of staff sergeant; he was stationed in Newfoundland, where he performed in theater productions such as the play &quot;Lady Precious Stream&quot;.

==Career==
===&quot;Mark Twain Tonight!&quot;===

Holbrook&#x27;s first solo performance as Twain was at Lock Haven State Teachers College in Pennsylvania in 1954. Ed Sullivan saw him and gave 31-year-old Holbrook his first national exposure on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on February 12, 1956. Holbrook was also a member of the Valley Players (1941–1962), a summer-stock theater company based in Holyoke, Massachusetts, which performed at Mountain Park Casino Playhouse at Mountain Park. He joined The Lambs Club in 1955, where he began developing his one-man show. He was a member of the cast for several years and performed &quot;Mark Twain Tonight!&quot; as the 1957 season opener. The State Department even sent him on a European tour, which included pioneering appearances behind the Iron Curtain.

In 1959, Holbrook first played the role off-Broadway. Columbia Records recorded an LP of excerpts from the show.
Holbrook performed in a special production for the 1964/1965 New York World&#x27;s Fair for the Bell Telephone Pavilion. Jo Mielziner created an innovative audio-visual ride experience and used Holbrook&#x27;s acting talents on 65 different action screens for &quot;The Ride of Communications&quot; with the movie itself known as &quot;From Drumbeats to Telstar&quot;.

In 1967, &quot;Mark Twain Tonight!&quot; was presented on television by CBS and Xerox, and Holbrook received an Emmy for his performance. Holbrook&#x27;s Twain first played on Broadway in 1966, and again in 1977 and 2005; Holbrook was 80 years old during his final Broadway run, older (for the first time) than the character he was portraying. Holbrook won a Tony Award for the performance in 1966. Until Holbrook retired in 2017, aged 92, &quot;Mark Twain Tonight!&quot; toured the country, which amounted to over 2,100 performances. This included one of his first performances in the spring of 1962 and one of his last in September 2014, at his high-school&quot; alma mater&quot; in Indiana.

===Success===
In 1964, Holbrook played the role of the Major in the original production of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Incident at Vichy&quot;. In 1968, he was one of the replacements for Richard Kiley in the original Broadway production of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, although he had limited singing ability. In 1966, Holbrook starred opposite Shirley Booth in the acclaimed CBS Playhouse production of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;.

Holbrook co-starred with Martin Sheen in the controversial and acclaimed 1972 television film &quot;That Certain Summer&quot;. Around that same year, Holbrook appeared in a television public service announcement (PSA) commissioned by the Ad Council; aimed at the parents of college students planning to study abroad, the PSA sees Holbrook in a jail cell, warning viewers to inform their children of the penalties for drug abuse in countries outside the US. In 1973, Holbrook appeared as Lieutenant Neil Briggs, the boss and rival of Detective &quot;Dirty&quot; Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) in &quot;Magnum Force&quot;, an &quot;obsessively neat and prim fanatic&quot; who supports the obliteration of San Francisco&#x27;s criminals and who is the leader of a rogue group of vigilante officers.

In 1976, Holbrook won acclaim for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in a series of television specials based on Carl Sandburg&#x27;s acclaimed biography. He won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for the 1970 series &quot;The Bold Ones: The Senator&quot;. He was also famous for his role as the enigmatic Deep Throat (whose identity was unknown at the time) in the film &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, and Commander Joseph Rochefort in the World War II battle film &quot;Midway&quot;. In 1977, he starred in the World War II film &quot;Julia&quot;, and the British-American thriller film &quot;Capricorn One&quot;.

In 1979, Holbrook starred with Katharine Ross, Barry Bostwick, and Richard Anderson in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Murder by Natural Causes&quot;. He appeared in various mini-series, including &quot;George Washington&quot; (1984), &quot;North and South&quot; (1985/1986) and &quot;Dress Gray&quot; (1986), and continued performing in theatrical productions, such as &quot;King Lear&quot;. Holbrook was the narrator on the Ken Burns documentary &quot;Lewis &amp; Clark: The Journey of the Corps of Discovery&quot; in 1997.

From 1986 to 1989, Holbrook had a recurring role as Reese Watson on &quot;Designing Women&quot;, opposite his wife Dixie Carter. Over a short period between 1988 and 1990, Holbrook directed four episodes of the series. Holbrook also had a major role on the sitcom &quot;Evening Shade&quot; throughout its entire run.
Early on in his career, Holbrook worked onstage and in a television soap opera, &quot;The Brighter Day&quot;.

Holbrook&#x27;s film roles during the 1980s and 1990s include a priest in &quot;The Fog&quot; (1980), a professor in &quot;Creepshow&quot; (1982), senior stock broker in &quot;Wall Street&quot; (1987), a neighborly lawyer in &quot;Fletch Lives&quot; (1989), senior partner of a corrupt law firm in &quot;The Firm&quot; (1993), and the voice of Amphitryon, the adoptive father of Hercules, in the Disney animated film &quot;Hercules&quot; (1997).

In 1999, Holbrook was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame. A year later, Holbrook appeared in&quot; Men of Honor&quot;, where he portrayed a racist and hypocritical officer who endlessly tries to fail an African-American diver trainee. Holbrook played the role of Albie Duncan in two episodes of &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

He appeared as the host in the documentary &quot;The Seventh Day: Revelations From The Lost Pages of History&quot; (2005).

===Later career===
He appeared in Sean Penn&#x27;s critically acclaimed film &quot;Into the Wild&quot; (2007) and received an Oscar nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role at the 80th Academy Awards. At the time, this rendered Holbrook, at age 82, the oldest nominee in Academy Award history in the Best Supporting Actor category. Holbrook was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for his work in the film. From late August through mid-September 2007, he starred as the narrator in the Hartford Stage production of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Our Town&quot;, a role he had once played on television.
Holbrook appeared with wife Dixie Carter in &quot;That Evening Sun&quot;, filmed in East Tennessee in the summer of 2008. The film, produced by Dogwood Entertainment, is based on a short story by William Gay. &quot;That Evening Sun&quot; premiered in March 2009 at South By Southwest, where it received the Audience Award for Narrative Feature and a special Jury Prize for Ensemble Cast. Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; hailed Hollbrook&#x27;s performance in the film as a &quot;career-highlight star turn as an irascible octogenarian farmer who will not go gentle into that good night&quot;. &quot;That Evening Sun&quot; also was screened at the 2009 Nashville Film Festival, where Holbrook was honored with a special Lifetime Achievement Award, and the film itself received another Audience Award.

Holbrook appeared as a featured guest star in a 2006 episode of the HBO series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and the &quot;NCIS&quot; episode &quot;Escaped&quot;. On April 22, 2010, Holbrook signed on to portray Katey Sagal&#x27;s character&#x27;s father on the FX original series&quot; Sons of Anarchy&quot; for a four-episode arc in their third season, as well as appearing in additional fifth episode in the final season. He also had a multiple-episode arc on &quot;The Event&quot;, an American television series on NBC, appearing in the 2010–2011 season.

In 2011, Holbrook appeared in &quot;Water for Elephants&quot;. In 2012, Steven Spielberg cast Holbrook to play Francis Preston Blair in &quot;Lincoln&quot;. His subsequent film roles were in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Promised Land&quot; (2012), the animated film &quot;&quot; (2014), and in the minor role as Whizzer in the drama film &quot;Blackway&quot; (2016). In 2014, Holbrook was the subject of Scott Teems&#x27; documentary &quot;Holbrook/Twain: An American Odyssey&quot; depicting Holbrook&#x27;s long-lasting career portraying Twain. It was premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival that same year.

In 2016, Holbrook was cast as Red Hudmore and appeared in the final season of &quot;Bones&quot; on January 17, 2017. On March 23, 2017, he appeared on an episode on &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; playing a retired thoracic surgeon whose wife is a patient, and on &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; later in the year.

In September 2017, after six decades of playing the role of Mark Twain, Holbrook announced his retirement from &quot;Mark Twain Tonight!&quot; Holbrook indicated that he would like to continue working on movies and television.

==Personal life==
Holbrook was married three times and had three children. He married a Newfoundlander, Ruby Elaine Johnston, in 1945 and they had two children. They divorced in 1965. In 1966, he married Carol Eve Rossen. They had one child and they divorced in 1983.

Holbrook married actress and singer Dixie Carter in 1984 and the couple remained married until Carter&#x27;s death from endometrial cancer on April 10, 2010. Holbrook appeared as a recurring character on Carter&#x27;s TV series, &quot;Designing Women&quot;.

Holbrook said of his home in McLemoresville, Tennessee, that it had the &quot;feel&quot; of the Mark Twain House in Hartford, Connecticut, and that there was no other place to which he felt so ideally suited. He also had a residence in Beverly Hills, California. Holbrook had a recurring role on his wife&#x27;s hit sitcom &quot;Designing Women,&quot; appearing in nine episodes between 1986 and 1989 as Carter&#x27;s on-screen significant other. In 2011, Holbrook&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Harold: The Boy Who Became Mark Twain&quot;, was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux.

In October 2016, Holbrook wrote a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot; defending actor director Nate Parker over his alleged 1999 rape of a woman and Parker&#x27;s controversial film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. He urged others to &quot;move on&quot; from Parker&#x27;s past and to view the film, which was &quot;an exceptional piece of artistry and a vital portrait of our American experience&quot;.

=== Political views ===
Holbrook occasionally criticized the politicization of religion. He was a registered independent, but leaned towards the liberal end of the U.S. political spectrum. He criticized the Republican Party while Barack Obama was in office.

In 2016, he castigated then-Republican candidate Donald Trump for not having &quot;the maturity to run the country&quot;. Holbrook praised Senator Bernie Sanders as the only politician who does not &quot;say what they think might get them elected&quot; and praised his honesty.

=== Death ===
Holbrook died at his home in Beverly Hills on January 23, 2021, at age 95; no cause was made public. He was buried in McLemoresville Cemetery in McLemoresville, Tennessee, alongside his wife, Dixie Carter.

==Legacy==
In 2003, President George W. Bush honored Holbrook with a National Humanities Medal for &quot;charming audiences with the wit and wisdom of Mark Twain as Twain&#x27;s outlook never fails to give Holbrook a good show to put on&quot;.

The local community of McLemoresville, hometown of his wife Dixie Carter, constructed the Dixie Theatre for Performing Arts in nearby Huntingdon, Tennessee, which features the Hal Holbrook Auditorium. Upon his retirement from his Mark Twain persona, the &quot;HuffPost&quot; wrote that Holbrook was &quot;the man who has done more to keep Mark Twain on people&#x27;s minds than anyone else&quot;.

<text>The Report of the Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, commonly known as the Cox Report after Representative Christopher Cox, is a classified U.S. government document reporting on the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s covert operations within the United States during the 1980s and 1990s. The redacted version of the report was released to the public on May 25, 1999.

==Committee created by the U.S. House of Representatives==
The report was the work product of the Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. This special committee, created by a 409–10 vote of the U.S. House of Representatives on June 18, 1998, was tasked with the responsibility of investigating whether technology or information was transferred to the People&#x27;s Republic of China that may have contributed to the enhancement of the nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles or to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction.

A similar investigation had already begun in the U.S. Senate under the leadership of Senator Fred Thompson (Republican-Tennessee). Thompson had opened his hearings on China&#x27;s influence in America&#x27;s 1996 presidential and congressional elections 11 months earlier (on July 8, 1997).

The Chairman of the committee was Republican Rep. Christopher Cox of California, whose name became synonymous with the committee&#x27;s final report. Four other Republicans and Democrats served on the panel, including Representative Norm Dicks, who served as the ranking Democratic member. The committee&#x27;s final report was approved unanimously by all 9 members. The redacted version of the report was released to the public May 25, 1999.

==Major allegations==
The Cox Report contained five major allegations about China and nuclear weapons.
* China stole design information regarding the United States&#x27; seven most advanced thermonuclear weapons.
* These stolen secrets enabled the PLA to accelerate the design, development and testing of its own nuclear weapons.
* China&#x27;s next generation of nuclear weapons would contain elements of stolen U.S. design information and would be comparable in effectiveness to the weapons used by the United States.
* Small warheads based on stolen U.S. information could be ready for deployment in 2002 also enabling China to integrate MIRV technology on its next generation of missiles.
* These thefts were not isolated incidents, but rather the results of decades of intelligence operations against U.S. weapons laboratories conducted by the Ministry of State Security. In addition, the report described the illegal activity likely persisted despite new security measures implemented as a result of the scandal.

While several groups, including the People&#x27;s Republic of China, contend that the Report is overstated or inaccurate, its authors and supporters maintain that its gist is undeniable. The report&#x27;s basic findings were as follows, quoted from the above document&#x27;s opening summary:

==Reactions==
===U.S. Government===
The Cox Report&#x27;s release prompted major legislative and administrative reforms. More than two dozen of the Select Committee&#x27;s recommendations were enacted into law, including the creation of a new National Nuclear Security Administration to take over the nuclear weapons security responsibilities of the United States Department of Energy. At the same time, no person has ever been convicted of providing nuclear information to the PRC, and the one case that was brought in connection to these charges, that of Wen Ho Lee, fell apart.

In response to the allegations contained in the report, the CIA appointed retired U.S. Navy Admiral David E. Jeremiah to review and assess the report&#x27;s findings. In April 1999, Admiral Jeremiah released a report backing up the Cox Report&#x27;s main allegation that stolen information had been used to develop or modernize Chinese missiles and/or warheads.

===PRC Government===
The Chinese government called all allegations &quot;groundless&quot;.

===Academia===
Richard L. Garwin remarked that stolen information regarding the W-70 and W-88 warhead would not appear to directly impair U.S. national security since to develop weapons based on this technology would require a massive investment in resources and not be in their best strategic interests with regard to their nuclear program.

An assessment report that was published by Stanford University&#x27;s Center for International Security and Cooperation said that the language of the Cox report &quot;was inflammatory and some allegations did not seem to be well supported.&quot;

===Related prosecutions===
Two of the U.S. companies named in the report – Loral Space and Communications Corp. and Hughes Electronics Corp. – were later successfully prosecuted by the federal government for violations of U.S. export control law, resulting in the two largest fines in the history of the Arms Export Control Act. Loral paid a $14 million fine in 2002, and Hughes paid a $32 million fine in 2003.

==Timeline==
*June 1995, &quot;Walk-in&quot; agent gives CIA officers classified Chinese document detailing American nuclear designs.
*July 1995, CIA director, Energy Secretary, and chief of staff learn of nuclear espionage for first time.
*October 31, 1995, FBI agents learn of nuclear thefts.
*November 1995, National Security Advisor to the President learns of Chinese nuclear espionage.
*Late 1995, Energy Dept. agents discover theft of nuclear designs while analyzing nuclear tests by China.
*April 1996, Assist. National Security Advisor, Defense Sec., Attorney General, FBI director learn of nuclear thefts.
*July 1997, President learns of Chinese nuclear espionage from National Security Advisor.
*December 1999, four Stanford University professors release a report rebutting the Cox Commission, noting that &quot;...facts are wrong and a number of conclusions are, in our view, unwarranted.&quot;

<text>Denison University is a private liberal arts college in Granville, Ohio, United States. One of the earliest colleges established in the former Northwest Territory, Denison University was founded in 1831. It was first called the Granville Literary and Theological Institution, later took the name Granville College, and, in the mid-1850s, was renamed Denison University, in honor of a key benefactor. The college enrolled 2,300 students in fall 2023 and students choose from 65 academic programs.

The college&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic teams compete in the North Coast Athletic Conference, fielding 26 varsity teams in the NCAA Division III. Denison is a member of the Five Colleges of Ohio and the Great Lakes Colleges Association.

==History==
On December 13, 1831, John Pratt, the college&#x27;s first president and a graduate of Brown University, inaugurated classes at the Granville Literary and Theological Institution. Situated on a farm south of the village of Granville; it was the second Baptist college west of the Allegheny mountains after Georgetown College, which was founded in 1829. While rooted in theological education, the institution offered students the same literary and scientific instruction common to other colleges of the day. The first term included 37 students, 27 of whom hailed from Granville; nearly half of these students were under fifteen years of age. The school&#x27;s first Commencement, which graduated three classics majors, was held in 1840.

In 1845, the institution, which at this point was male-only, officially changed its name to Granville College. In 1853, William S. Denison, a Muskingum County farmer, pledged $10,000 toward the college&#x27;s endowment. Honoring an earlier commitment, the trustees accordingly changed the name of the institution to Denison University. They also voted to move the college to land then available for purchase in the village of Granville.

In the years leading up to the Civil War, many students and faculty members at Denison University became deeply involved in the anti-slavery movement. Asa Drury, the chair of Greek and Latin studies, became the leader of a local anti-slavery society. Bancroft House, now a residential hall, served as a stop on the Underground Railroad for refugee slaves.

The roots of coeducation at Denison University began in 1832 with the establishment of the Granville Female Seminary, founded a year before Oberlin College launched the first coeducational college in the United States. The seminary was superseded by the Young Ladies&#x27; Institute, founded in 1859. The Young Ladies&#x27; Institute was renamed Shepardson College for Women in 1886. Shepardson College was fully incorporated into Denison University after a transitional phase in 1927.

In 1887, Denison inaugurated a master&#x27;s program, with resident graduates pursuing advanced studies in the sciences. In 1926, the board of trustees formalized a new curriculum that made Denison University an exclusively undergraduate institution.

In the wake of Shepardson College&#x27;s incorporation, Denison University enlarged its campus. In 1916, the college hired the Frederick Law Olmsted &amp; Sons architectural firm. The resulting &quot;Olmsted Plan&quot; laid a foundation for expansion that has remained the guiding aesthetic for subsequent growth. Expansion during this period included the acquisition of land to the north and east, the relocation of Shepardson College to the east ridge of College Hill, and the development of a new men&#x27;s quadrangle beyond the library.

While the college&#x27;s origins were rooted in theological education, Denison University has been a non-sectarian institution since the 1960s. By 2005, the college reached its present size of approximately 2,250 students.

==Campus==
The campus size is about . This includes a biological reserve just east of campus, where professors of sciences, such as geology and biology, can hold class. The Denison Golf Club at Granville, an 18-hole course designed by Donald Ross, is just from the academic campus and was donated to the university in 2014. In 2013, the university purchased and renovated the historic Granville Inn.

The first building in the &quot;Greater Denison&quot; plan, Swasey Chapel, was built at the center of the campus. The chapel seats 990 and plays host to notable campus events such as baccalaureate services, lectures, concerts, and academic award convocations.

There are 18 academic buildings on campus. Doane Administration Building, one of the oldest buildings on campus, and Burton Morgan are also on academic quad (spill-over academic building), but they serve administrative purposes. The Bryant Arts Center opened in August 2009. Also on the fine arts quad is Doane Dance Building, Burton Music, Cinema MIX Lab, Burke Performance and Recital Hall, and the Michael D. Eisner Center for the Performing Arts, completed in 2019.

Doane Library today houses more than 500,000 books and bound periodicals.

Swasey Observatory, which opened in June 1910, houses a 9-inch refracting telescope as well as two 8-inch reflecting telescopes.
The campus landscape was designed by the Olmsted Brothers firm. &quot;Greater Denison&quot; was designed based on a layout of quadrangles throughout upper campus, designed to mirror the building functions. This was envisioned to help foster a sense of community among campus groups.

==Students==
As of the 2023–24 school year, 2,300 students are enrolled at Denison, with a gender distribution of 49 percent male students and 51 percent female students. They come from all 50 states, Washington, DC; and 79 countries, with 78% from out-of-state. A full-time faculty of 292 professors makes the student-to-faculty ratio 9:1.

Thirteen percent of students are first-generation college students, and 37% are multicultural students. Denison was cited by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2014 as one of America&#x27;s &quot;Most Economically Diverse Top Colleges.&quot; In that list, Denison is ranked at No. 11 in the list of the nation&#x27;s top colleges and universities.

With an endowment stated at over $1 billion in 2023, the endowment per student is over $400,000. While the university will &quot;meet 100% of all demonstrated need,&quot; the annual cost of attending is $83,400 for the 2024–2025 academic year. Denison awards nearly $70 million in financial aid each year.

===Admissions===
Denison University is one of the few universities that guarantees it will meet the financial needs of all admitted students (including international students). The university is need-blind for domestic applicants.

In the admission season for fall 2023 entry, there were more than 14,500 applicants, with 17% of the applicant pool receiving offers to become members of the Class of 2027. Recent trends show an expanding interest from international student populations, with application submissions increasing from 2,447 in 2019 to 3,255 in 2021. Enrollment among international students has also increased during this period, from 97 newly enrolled international students to 131 over the three-year span. Among freshman students who committed to enrolling in Fall 2021, composite SAT scores for the middle 50% ranged from 1330 to 1550, while composite ACT scores for the middle 50% ranged from 30 to 35. Denison practices test-optional admissions. Consequently, the SAT and ACT information reported is not based on the entire student body and instead reflects the middle 50% of only those students who opted to provide their test scores. In Fall 2021, 76% of enrolled freshmen were in the top 10% of their high school classes. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; categorizes Denison as &quot;most selective&quot;. Roughly 15 percent of the incoming class are admitted through athlete recruits. Denison University implements the holistic review admissions process. In addition to the standard results, extracurricular activities, awards, honors, character, community contributions, enthusiasm, specialties, etc. are criteria that are factored into the application process.

In January 2021, Denison University announced it has been selected as a QuestBridge partner college, becoming one of 48 universities in the country to be part of the program.

== Rankings ==

Denison was ranked tied for 36th in U.S. liberal arts colleges and 4th for “Most Innovative Schools” by the 2025 U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Colleges Ranking. The college also received an “A” overall grade from Niche, who also placed them as the 2nd best liberal arts college in Ohio. Denison&#x27;s websites states they were ranked 43rd in “Smartest Liberal Arts Colleges in America” by Business Insider.

==Student life==
Denison is a strictly residential campus that features a mixture of historic and contemporary buildings. The Homestead at Denison University is a non-traditional housing option.

===Student organizations and involvement===
Denison University is home to over 160 campus organizations with more than 600 students in leadership positions.

The Denison Campus Governance Association (DCGA) is the Denison student governing body, in which all students are members. The DCGA Student Senate is the primary representative body of students on Denison&#x27;s campus, and it has been involved in various student initiatives: from postponing quiet hours in the fall of 2007 to drafting the Code of Academic Integrity adopted in the fall of 2009 to encouraging the University President to sign onto the Presidents&#x27; Climate Commitment.

Denison Community Association (DCA) is student-led and operated umbrella organization for student service committees. In 2015, 86% of students participated in community service.

Founded in 1857, &quot;The Denisonian&quot; is the student-run newspaper and oldest student organization on campus and prints ten issues per semester as well as online at denisonian.com.

&quot;The Bullsheet&quot; is a student-run publication for news, humor and community dialog that is printed daily and delivered to campus buildings. It was founded in 1979 to combat student apathy, and it remains central to campus culture by providing an open forum for free speech.

===Fraternity and sorority life===
There are 19 nationally recognized fraternal organization on campus, governed by four councils. As of 2023, 35% of students join a fraternity or sorority.

===Traditions and folklore===
D-Day, the successor to the college&#x27;s old Scrap Day, is a celebration of the entire college, put on once a year by the University Programming Council (UPC).

Kirtley Mather, Class of 1909, named the tallest peak in Alaska&#x27;s Aleutian Peninsula &quot;Mt. Denison.&quot; In 1978, a group of students, professors, and alumni successfully scaled the mountain—a feat repeated nearly 20 years later by another Denison group.

Denison has one of the few remaining college cemeteries.

== Arts ==
Students can major or minor in theatre, music, visual art, studio art, art history, dance, or cinema. Denison also hosts a variety of annual festivals and series including The Vail Series, The Beck Series, The Tutti Festival, and The Bluegrass Festival.

The Vail Series began in 1979 as the result of a financial gift from Mary and Foster McGaw in honor of Jeanne Vail, class of 1946. Michael Morris, who previously worked as the executive director of the Midland Theatre, Newark, Ohio, was appointed to be the director of the program in 2014. According to an article by the Newark Advocate, The Vail Series is an &quot;acclaimed visiting artist program&quot; where artists are encouraged to both perform and interact with students. Tickets to the Vail Series are free to students. Former performers include Yo-Yo Ma, Itzhak Perlman, Renée Fleming, Wynton Marsalis, Jessye Norman, and Chris Thile and Edgar Meyer among others. In 2014, the university announced that ETHEL will become their first ensemble-in-residence. They performed their multimedia concert &quot;Documerica&quot; on campus during the spring of 2016 and received honorary degrees from the college at the commencement ceremony in 2017.

The Beck Series is associated with the creative writing program at Denison, and it brings a variety of authors to campus to read their work and interact with students. Former visitors include Pulitzer Prize winner Eudora Welty, National Book Award winner Alice Walker, Playwright and Oscar-winning screenwriter Tom Stoppard, Orange is the New Black author, Piper Kerman, and W. S. Merwin among others.

The Tutti Festival is a semi-annual festival that features original works of music, art, dance, poetry, fine arts, and theater by professors, students, and visiting artists.

The college hosts an annual free Bluegrass Festival. This weekend-long celebration includes multiple concerts, instrument workshops, and jam sessions.

The campus radio station, WDUB a.k.a. The Doobie, features 24-hour programming and broadcasts both online at www.doobieradio.com. The station was notably featured in American Eagle stores across the country through the summer of 2009. The Doobie was also ranked by &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; as one of the best college radio stations in the nation.

In 2016, Denison renovated and opened the Denison Art Space in Newark as part of the Thirty-One West development in Downtown Newark.

==Athletics==

Denison is a member of the NCAA Division III and the North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC) since the conference&#x27;s formation in 1984. As a part of the 10-member conference Denison boasts a league-record 11 Dennis M. Collins Awards which is given to the NCAC school that performs best across the conference&#x27;s 23 sponsored sports: 11 for men and 12 for women. Denison additionally has 45 club and intramural sports. Denison won nine consecutive All-Sports Awards between 1997–1998 and 2005–2006. Denison&#x27;s remaining two awards were earned in 1985–86 and 2008–2009.

In 2001, the Denison Women&#x27;s Swimming and Diving team captured the school&#x27;s first NCAA Division III national championship by breaking Kenyon College’s streak of 17-consecutive national championships. Following this, the Denison Men&#x27;s Swimming and Diving team defeated Kenyon to capture the 2011 NCAA National Title by 1 point ending the Lords&#x27; 31-year streak of championships. Denison men won the national title in 2015–2016 and in 2017–2018.

In both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming and diving, Denison has posted 47 consecutive top-10 finishes at the NCAA Division III championships. During that span, Denison has placed either second or third, nationally, 26 times.

Denison alumnus Woody Hayes (Class of ’35) spent three seasons as the head football coach at Denison (1946–48). In 1947 and 1948 he guided the Big Red to undefeated seasons.

In 1954, Keith Piper took over as the head football coach, a position he would remain in for 39 seasons. Piper won a school record, 200 games and in 1985 he guided the program to their first 10–0 season with his antique single-wing offense. Denison qualified for the NCAA Division III playoffs that season before falling to Mt. Union in the opening round.

Women&#x27;s basketball at Denison has emerged as a national contender under head coach Sara Lee. Denison&#x27;s 2010–11 squad completed the first 28–0 regular season in women&#x27;s basketball in the NCAC and have advanced to the NCAA Division III Tournament for the seventh time in school history and their sixth time out of the last seven seasons.

The Denison men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse programs have had their share of conference and national success. The two programs have combined for 28 NCAA Division III tournament berths. In 1999 and 2001 the Denison men&#x27;s lacrosse team advances to the semifinal (Final 4) of the NCAA Division III Tournament [10] and most recently, in 2009, the Big Red advanced to the national quarterfinals of the NCAC Tournament before falling to Gettysburg.

In 2008, the Denison women&#x27;s tennis team advanced to the NCAA semifinals, eventually winning the consolation match to place third overall, marking the program&#x27;s best national finish. That same year the doubles team of sophomore Marta Drane and freshman Kristen Cobb advanced to the championship match of the Division III Doubles championship before falling to Brittany Berckes and Alicia Menezes of Amherst in the finals.

The Denison women&#x27;s soccer team advanced to the NCAA quarterfinals for the second time in school history in 2010. The previous appearance occurred in 2005. Overall the program has qualified for the NCAA Tournament 14 times.

In 2019, Denison was one of the first NCAA universities to participate in the organization&#x27;s LGBTQ OneTeam Program, which launched in fall 2019.

Denison boasts 49 NCAA postgraduate scholars and 87 Academic All-Americans.
